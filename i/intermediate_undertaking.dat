Because of the extreme lability of the isolated, functional molybdenum cofactor, direct cofactor replacement therapy is not feasible, and a search for stable biosynthetic <b>intermediates</b> was <b>undertaken.</b> From studies of cocultured fibroblasts from affected individuals, two complementation groups were identified. Coculture of group A and group B cells, without heterokaryon formation, led to the appearance of active sulfite oxidase. Use of conditioned media indicated that a relatively stable, diffusible precursor produced by group B cells {{could be used to}} repair sulfite oxidase in group A recipient cells. Although the extremely low levels of precursor produced by group B cells preclude its direct characterization, studies with a heterologous, in vitro reconstitution system suggest that the precursor that accumulates in group B cells is the same as a molybdopterin precursor identified in the Neurospora crassa molybdopterin mutant nit- 1, and that a converting enzyme is present in group A cells which catalyzes an activation reaction analogous to that of a converting enzyme identified in the Escherichia coli molybdopterin mutant ChlA 1...|$|R

The teacher had expressed her aspirations that interventions such as this would encourage more students to <b>undertake</b> <b>intermediate</b> and advanced mathematics courses in senior secondary Years. The study collected data on student perceptions about their learning experiences including perceptions about mathematics as a subject domain, engagement with the activities, development of algebraic understanding, and the quality of discourse within the classroom. This study found that the students valued the classroom discourse much more than they did the normal mathematics learning experiences. These findings have implications for in-service and pre-service teacher education. Introduction and Backgroun...|$|R

The C 3 species Panicum rivulare Trin. had few organelles in bundle sheath cell profiles (2 chloroplasts, 1. 1 mitochondria, and 0. 3 peroxisomes per cell section) compared to an average of 10. 6 chloroplasts, 17. 7 mitochondria, and 3. 2 peroxisomes per bundle sheath cell profile for three C 3 -C 4 species, Panicum milioides Nees ex Trin., Panicum decipiens Nees ex Trin. and Panicum schenckii Hack. However, two other C 3 species, Panicum laxum Sw. and Panicum hylaeicum Mez, contained about 0. 7, 0. 5, and 0. 3 as many chloroplasts, mitochondria, and peroxisomes, respectively, as in bundle sheath cell profiles of the C 3 -C 4 species. Chloroplasts and mitochondria in bundle sheath cells were larger than those in mesophyll cells for the C 4 species Panicum prionitis Griseb. and the C 3 -C 4 species, but in C 3 species the organelles were similar in size or were smaller in the bundle sheath cells. The C 3 -C 4 species and P. laxum and P. hylaeicum exhibited an unusually close association of organelles in bundle sheath cells with mitochondria frequently surrounded in profile by chloroplasts. The high concentrations in bundle sheath cells of somewhat larger organelles than in mesophyll cells correlates with the reduced photorespiration of the C 3 -C 4 species...|$|R

Molecules that inhibit the immune response by blocking a specific signaling pathway involved in T-cell activation have proven to be useful biochemical tools. Pateamine A, a potent immunosuppressant isolated from the Mycale sp. sponge, specifically inhibits an intercellular step of the T-cell receptor signal transduction pathway leading to 1 L- 2 production. The large scale synthesis of pateamine A <b>intermediates</b> was therefore <b>undertaken</b> in order to generate substantial quantities of the natural product and synthetic intermediates to be used in preparation of derivatives useful for putative cellular receptor isolation and structure activity studies. A 2, 4 -DNB pateamine A hybrid has been successfully synthesized for use in cellular receptor isolation studies. Molecular mechanics studies using Cerius II software were performed and these studies in conjunction with preliminary structure-activity data led to a binding/scaffolding hypothesis.

40|$|The {{focal point}} {{of this study is}} to examine the {{efficiency}} of utilization on intermediate input, particularly in terms of resources and non resources-based industries in the Malaysian manufacturing sector. Since relative efficiency can determine how well an input performed, our main interest rest on whether there exist any discrepancy between the performance of domestic and imported <b>intermediate</b> input. To <b>undertake</b> such analysis, we employ the basic table of input and output matrices derived from various publications of the Malaysian Input-Output Tables, which covers the period of 1983 to 2005. The input-output coefficients of domestic and imported inputs were then simulated by using commodity technology model, notwithstanding the conventional technical coefficient methods. The former method is expected to give a more reasonable result, which is hoped to overcome criticism of the latter. It is anticipated that three main findings might be gained from this study, especially in terms of whether these resources were sourced from either local’s or foreign’s. Firstly, non resources‐based industries have shown that the used of both inputs have a higher percentage of sub-sectors improved. Secondly, resource-based industries show high percentage of productivity improve in imported input used; while domestic input utilization have rather a low percent during the study. Thirdly, the number of industries that is efficient in utilizing imported input more higher, both, in resources and non resources-based industries. Although these imperative findings bring to a close match between the two different inputs, it is clear that imported inputs of resources and non resources-based industries are more productive than domestic inputs...|$|R

The focus is on long-term climate projections designed to 1) quantify the climate change commitment of different radiative forcing trajectories and 2) explore the extent to which climate change is reversible on human time scales. All commitment simulations follow the four representative concentration pathways (RCPs) and their extensions to year 2300. Most EMICs simulate substantial surface air temperature and thermosteric sea level rise commitment following stabilization of the atmospheric composition at year- 2300 levels. The meridional overturning circulation (MOC) is weakened temporarily and recovers to near-preindustrial values in most models for RCPs 2. 6 - 6. 0. The MOC weakening is more persistent for RCP 8. 5. Elimination of anthropogenic CO 2 emissions after 2300 results in slowly decreasing atmospheric CO 2 concentrations. At year 3000 atmospheric CO 2 is still at more than half its year- 2300 level in all EMICs for RCPs 4. 5 - 8. 5. Surface air temperature remains constant or decreases slightly and thermosteric sea level rise continues for centuries after elimination of CO 2 emissions in all EMICs. Restoration of atmospheric CO 2 from RCP to preindustrial levels over 100 - 1000 years requires large artificial removal of CO 2 from the atmosphere and does not result in the simultaneous return to preindustrial climate conditions, as surface air temperature and sea level response exhibit a substantial time lag relative to atmospheric CO 2...|$|R
40|$|In 1964 Cedric Price {{unveiled}} his Potteries Thinkbelt, {{an attack}} on a series of new universities then being built on greenfield sites all around England. Rather than being bound by its locality and the immutability of the education model it offered, Price’s university of the future was imagined as a mobile learning resource, accommodated within the rolling stock of a declining Midlands railway line and able to move 20, 000 students at a time while reinvigorating previously stagnant local industry, housing and infrastructure. With one project, therefore, Price not only reimagined what a university could look like but, more radically still, challenged the way architects traditionally worked by inverting notions of reuse and reinvention (R & R). Inspired by this iconoclasm, <b>Intermediate</b> 5 will <b>undertake</b> a design experiment without the use of an architectural brief. And in doing so question with both more abandon and more rigour the component parts of a traditional architectural brief – programme, site, context, type, function, etc. Our goal is to escape from the routine use of worn-out architectural categories, and in the process free design from precisely those things that are traditionally understood to constrain it. This in turn calls for a repositioning of the idea of constraint itself, and hopefully, like Price, will see the ascendency of the social objectives of building and the city. The unit’s other key referent will be OuLiPo, the loose gathering of French writers and thinkers including Georges Perec and Raymond Queneau, whose work, like that of Price, was defined as much by the constraints it established as those it subverted. Following OuLiPo, the output of the unit will develop from a constrained piece of writing, but will also take in composite drawing and physical modelling, forming a three-dimensional portfolio of moving parts. Each of these parts will examine an existing syste...|$|R
40|$|High-spin (S = 2) iron(IV) {{species are}} rare but {{increasingly}} recognized as reactive intermediates {{in the catalytic}} cycles of several nonheme iron enzymes. A question of some interest, therefore, concerns how much higher in energy the low-spin (S = 1) state is for these species. With the use of density functional theory (DFT) and high-level ab initio calculations [CASPT 2 and CCSD(T) ], we have attempted {{to answer this question}} for the so-called Collins complex, a square-pyramidal Fe-IV complex with a tetraamido-N equatorial ligand set, a chloride axial ligand, and an S = 2 ground state. The calculations suggest that relative to the ground state, the low-spin state is higher in energy by at least 0. 3 eV and possibly as much as 0. 7 eV. Using DFT calculations, a broad quantum chemical survey of high-spin (FeO) -O-IV <b>intermediates</b> was also <b>undertaken.</b> A key finding is that the Fe-O distance and O spin population are quite similar across all mononuclear (FeO) -O-IV species studied, regardless of the heme versus non-heme environment and of the S = 1 versus 2 spin state, reflecting the essential similarity of the Fe(d(pi)) -O(p(pi)) orbital interactions in all the species studied. However, the spin density profiles of high-spin (FeO) -O-IV species, currently believed to be known only as a nonheme iron enzyme (TauD) intermediate, are predicted to be very different from that of Collins' high-spin Fe-IV complex. Our calculations further suggest that with the help of sterically hindered ligands such as 6 -me(3) -tpa, {{it might be possible to}} generate synthetic high-spin (FeO) -O-IV models of the unique TauD intermediate. Finally, our calculations confirm the aptness of describing the [(6 -me(3) -tpa) Fe-III(mu-O) (2) Fe-IV(6 -me(3) -tpa) ](3 +) cation as a flexible diamond core and indicate the presence of a fairly discrete high-spin (FeO) -O-IV unit within the dinuclear core.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Identifying the antecedents of export performance is critical for researchers, due to the many benefits of exporting for firms and nations. Many researchers have, thus, devoted their research efforts to identifying export performance antecedents. Export marketing adaptation and firm level export market orientation (or EMO) have emerged as two critical export performance predictors. However, two important research questions remain unexamined. The first is whether firms ought to pursue heterogeneous levels of marketing adaptation across ventures in order to boost venture performance, and whether {{the answer to this}} question is contingent upon internal firm resources which support adaptation (namely EMO) and upon the environments faced across ventures. The second question concerns what the total amount (i. e. quantity) of export marketing adaptation firms should undertake in order to boost firm export performance is, and whether {{the answer to this question}} depends on internal firm resources supporting adaptation (more specifically, EMO) and on the overall export environments faced by firms. Underpinned by a contingent approach to the study of business performance, this study set out to answer to such questions, via developing and testing two conceptual models. The models were tested using data collected from British exporting companies. The findings of the first model indicate that marketing adaptation across ventures becomes increasingly beneficial for venture performance (directly in the case of sales performance and indirectly in the case of profit performance) as EMO rises and as the levels of environmental differences across ventures increase. Results of the second model suggest that, under greater levels of EMO, firm export sales performance attains its highest values when the firm practices either very low or very high levels of marketing adaptation quantity. Also, under greater levels of EMO, firm export sales performance is increasingly reduced the more the firm deviates from extreme (low/high) marketing adaptation quantities. Additionally, as the firm s export environments become more heterogeneous, the firm benefits increasingly more from pursuing either very low or very high marketing adaptation quantity levels (with sales performance being maximized when the firm pursues very high levels of marketing adaptation quantity), and the reductions in firm export sales performance accruing from <b>undertaking</b> <b>intermediate</b> marleting adaptation quantity levels are increasingly higher. Findings also suggest that enhancing marketing adaptation quantity is beneficial for firm export profit performance up to an optimal point. The returns brought by additional increments in marketing adaptation quantity are increasingly smaller as marketing adaptation quantity increases. Beyond an optimal point, additional increments in marketing adaptation quantity diminish firm export profit performance. The marketing adaptation quantity-firm export profit performance link was not found to be moderated directly neither by EMO nor by firm export environmental differences. EMO was found to have a positive impact on firm export sales and profit performance...|$|R
40|$|The International Institute of Biological Control (IIBC) is {{a nonprofit}} {{organization}} which aims to support the development of biological control and integrated pest management worldwide. Since its establishment in 1927 IIBC has provided a unique service, through research, training {{and the provision of}} advice and information. IIBC is an institute of CAB International, an intergovernmental organization comprising 36 member countries, which provides services to agriculture, forestry, human health and the management of natural resources through provision of information and associated technical services. IIBC headquarters and project activities in the UK are located at Silwood Park, Ascot. A purpose-built facility completed in 1988, the new building includes constant temperature rooms and a quarantine unit c equipped for work on insects and pathogens. Together with the quarantine greenhouse opened in 1986, this has greatly expanded the institute's capacity to <b>undertake</b> <b>intermediate</b> quarantine of biological control agents being moved from one tropical region to another. The new building houses the IIBC Training and Information Unit and the CABI Library Services Centre, and provides facilities for visiting research workers and trainees. The principal activity of IIBC is to undertake research and development projects on contract for governments, international and bilateral development agencies, research foundations and commercial interests in agriculture. To carry this out the institute operates through seven bases around the world, most of them linked to leading national research institutes. IIBC staff from over 13 countries advise on over 80 separate projects a year. Their experts are available to advise on pest ecology; biology of natural enemies, their production, handling, shipment and release for classical biological control. Staff can also advise on the preparation of proposals which may range from research on techniques and the feasibility of applying biological controls, to the implementation of biological control and integrated pest management programmes. IIBC undertakes investigations on conservation of natural enemies of insect and other arthropod pests and weeds. Current research programmes include: · Characterization screening and supply of insects and pathogens for control of major pasture weeds and weeds in environmentally sensitive areas. · Research on the natural enemies of pests of temperate and tropical foresty. · Integrated pest management implementation programmes in vegetables, cotton, coffee and rice. · Development of a fungal pesticide for control of locusts and grasshoppers in Africa. · Investigations on the control of pests of cassava, sweet potato and Irish potato for the Eastern and Southern Africa Root Crops Research Network. Transfer of technology {{is an important part of}} the activities of IIBC and short courses are given on biological control and pest management, which are conducted at the institutes own field stations or at collaborating institutions in developing countries. Customized, illustrated manuals are prepared for training courses, as well as special self-training packages. Recently, IIBC has begun to work with national programmes and FAO on the development of training materials for farmers, to help them discover and appreciate the role of natural enemies in their crops. In addition to providing training courses, IIBC cooperates with universities in Europe, Africa, Asia and Latin America to support degree-level training in biological control, and to organize bench training in specialized techniques for scientists and technicians sponsored by their own institutions or through training grants. In 1993 IIBC established its Training Information and Policy Support group (TIPS) to meet the diversifying demand for training and information on biological control. TIPS is expanding IlBC's current activities to include information materials and training for non-specialists, in forms such as handbooks, posters and concise summaries of key areas of biological control activity. It will place particular emphasis on information useful to the development of national and international policy in biological control and IPM. Developing and implementing biological control is frequently constrained by lack of information on the identity of natural enemies, their biology, evaluation, production and use. IIBC makes available information on all aspects of biological control with the backing of the CAB ABSTRACTS database. Its Information Unit at Silwood Park also has the resources of an unrivalled plant protection library and access to specialist knowledge from staff at the other CAB International institutes and collaborating institutes. IIBC compiles its own abstract journal, Biocontrol News and Information, which comprehensively surveys biological control research on a quarterly basis, and provides critical reviews and a regular news section. IIBC also maintains a global database of biological control introductions against insect pests, which practitioners consult. Where identification of natural enemies is required, IIBC depends on CABI's biosytematic institutes: the International Institute of Entomology (IIE), International Institute of Parasitology (IIP) and International Mycological Institute (IMI). These Institutes provide a worldwide service for the identification of pests and natural enemies, particularly to developing countries. To do this, they draw upon some of the most extensive collections of insects, pathogens and nematodes in the world. Beyond identifications, the biosystems institutes produce guides and computerized keys to pests and natural enemies, monitor the global movements of exotic pests and undertake biochemical research into the taxonomy of difficult groups. To reach as wide an audience as possible, and to inform the public on environmentally sound options in pest management, IIBC also promotes biological control through the printed media, radio, film and television, and assists in the development of schools' curricula.
