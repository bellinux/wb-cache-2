5|$|A rigid {{structure}} {{called the}} plica mediana or lytta {{runs from the}} front to the back, {{down the center of}} the sublingua to give <b>it</b> <b>support.</b> The plica mediana is usually made of cartilage and attaches the sublingua to the underside of the tongue. In lemuriforms, the sublingua mostly consists of two plicae fimbriatae (singular: plica fimbriata), which run along the sides of the plica mediana and end in comb-like serrated edges that are hardened with keratin. The plicae fimbriatae move freely over a limited range. The plica sublingualis, which is found in all primates, but is particularly small in lemuriforms, attaches the tongue and sublingua to the floor of the mouth. Tarsiers have a large but highly generalized sublingua, but their closest living relatives, monkeys and apes, lack one.|$|E

40|$|This study {{analyses}} how the <b>IT</b> <b>supported</b> international outsourcing {{of software}} production process is executed. We present essential ideas and theoretical background for our study through an in-depth literature {{review in the}} areas of subcontracting, outsourcing, international outsourcing, information technology (IT) and international software production. The literature review reveals the limitations of research on <b>IT</b> <b>supported</b> international outsourcing of software production process. Three research questions arise in this context. (1) What are the phases of the <b>IT</b> <b>supported</b> international outsourcing process and how these phases are executed? (2) What are the major activities in each phase of the international outsourcing process and how these activities are managed? (3) What are the performance measures and expected outcomes of each phase? The study addresses these research questions (1) by conceptualising a framework on <b>IT</b> <b>supported</b> international outsourcing of software production in the light of diffusion of innovation theory and relevant literature in the fields of outsourcing, software production and IT and (2) by conducting an empirical investigation. This study reports the results of an empirical research focusing on the <b>IT</b> <b>supported</b> international outsourcing process of software production through a single case study. Different issues associated with the conceptual framework of <b>IT</b> <b>supported</b> international outsourcing process of software production have been classified and analysed based on our empirical findings. The major contribution of this framework is to help companies to understand, improve and systematise the <b>IT</b> <b>supported</b> international outsourcing process of software 3 production...|$|R

500|$|Two turrets were mounted fore in a superfiring pair, {{while the}} other three were mounted aft of the main superstructure, all on the centerline. The {{placement}} of the rear gun turrets proved problematic. Capps placed the rear superfiring turret, Number 3, closest amidships. Since it represented the greatest weight borne by the ship's structure due to its tall barbette, this placement would allow <b>it</b> <b>support</b> by {{the greatest amount of}} underwater volume available. The other two rear turrets, Numbers 4 and 5, were placed level and back to back. This arrangement was detrimental in two ways. First, Number 3 could not fire astern with Number 4 trained forward, which left only the two 12" [...] guns of Number 5 to do so. Second, because the engine room was situated between Numbers 3 and 4, steam lines ran from the boiler rooms amidships around the ammunition magazine for Number 3 turret to the engine room. These lines, it was later found, had the potential to heat the powder in the magazine and degrade its ballistics. This design flaw was also prevalent in several British dreadnoughts but was considered inescapable by naval designers on structural grounds.|$|E
500|$|POJ was {{initially}} not well supported by word-processing applications {{due to the}} special diacritics needed to write <b>it.</b> <b>Support</b> has now improved and there are now sufficient resources to both enter and display POJ correctly. Several input methods exist to enter Unicode-compliant POJ, including OpenVanilla (OS X and Microsoft Windows), the cross-platform Tai-lo Input Method released by the Taiwanese Ministry of Education, and the Firefox add-on Transliterator, which allows in-browser POJ input. When POJ was first used in word-processing applications it was not fully supported by the Unicode standard, thus necessitating work-arounds. One employed was encoding the necessary characters in the [...] "Private Use" [...] section of Unicode, but this required both the writer and the reader to have the correct custom font installed. Another solution was to replace troublesome characters with near equivalents, for example substituting [...] for [...] or using a standard [...] followed by an interpunct to represent [...] With the introduction into Unicode 4.1.0 of the combining character COMBINING DOT ABOVE RIGHT (U+0358) in 2004, all the necessary characters were present to write regular POJ {{without the need for}} workarounds. However, even after the addition of these characters, there are still relatively few fonts which are able to properly render the script, including the combining characters. Some of those which can are Charis SIL, DejaVu, Doulos SIL, Linux Libertine, and Taigi Unicode.|$|E

The organization criticized the health system's dependency on insurance companies and the idea that the United States would unilaterally grant independence, arguing that operating in a frame that fell outside their comfort zone was the path to follow. The EPB then claimed that a series of robberies and attacks against independentist figures including Rafael Cancel Miranda were attempts to intimidate the movement by [...] "those that control the system". The organization also distanced themselves from a man that called the police superintendent, airport and the mail offices and self-identified as a Machetero, citing that they are a [...] "revolutionary organization and not terrorists like the FBI", citing that that [...] "attempts to discredit [...] would not result in desperate actions" [...] and that they would continue with the usual methodical approach. The EPB also expresses <b>it</b> <b>support</b> for worker's unions and opposed the privatization of places of sociocultural interest and recreation, watersources and beaches, as well as deforestation and expropriation. The organization warned that a recent influx of FBI agents could have the independence movement as a target and requested cooperation from its counterparts, despite strategic and philosophical differences.|$|E
