Healthy children (n = 494) {{were randomly assigned to}} receive low-lactose milk with a low calcium content of similar to 50 mg/d (LC; n = 124), a regular calcium content of similar to 440 mg/d (RC group; n = 126), regular calcium with 5 x 10 (8) CFU/d Lactobacillus casei CRL 431 (casei; n = 120), or regular calcium with 5 x 10 (8) CFU/d Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 (reuteri; n = 124). Growth, anemia, and <b>iron</b> and zinc <b>status</b> were assessed before and after the intervention.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Jundiaí, Southeastern Brazil, in 2000. Venous blood samples collected from 95 pregnant women and from their umbilical cord and used for the determination of complete blood count, serum iron, total iron-binding capacity, serum ferritin, zinc protoporphyrin, and transferrin saturation. Women were classified into three groups: anemic, iron deficient and non-iron deficient. Statistical analysis included the Tukey-HSD test, Pearson's correlation coefficient and multiple linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Among pregnant women, 19 % were anemic (97. 9 % mildly anemic and 2. 1 % moderately anemic) and 30. 5 % were iron deficient. No significant difference was seen in mean values of any parameter studied between newborns in the three groups (p> 0. 05).

Socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, feeding practices, nutritional status (height-for-age and body mass index-for-age), and serum ferritin and hemoglobin concentrations were evaluated. Multiple linear regression analysis was carried out to evaluate factors independently associated with <b>iron</b> nutritional <b>status</b> (hemoglobin and ferritin), considering α= 0. 05 as the significance level. Results The prevalence of anemia and iron deficiency was (34) 9. 52 % and (11) 11. 00 %, respectively. The factors independently associated with anemia were younger child age, low maternal education, low height-for-age Z-scores, and children of single and separated mothers or widows.

40|$|Iron is an {{essential}} nutrient for growth of photosynthetic microorganisms such as cyanobacteria and algae. Iron is required for proteins involved in the important processes of carbon and nitrogen assimilation. Low concentrations of iron in cultures or natural waters can lead to iron limitation which affects many aspects of algal metabolism. In natural waters, iron limitation can have effects on the patterns and rates of primary productivity. The cellular content of certain proteins can be affected by media iron concentrations. Methods have been used that assay components of the cell as an indirect measure of <b>iron</b> nutritional <b>status.</b> For example, spectroscopy can be performed to determine the cellular concentration of iron-containing proteins involved in photosynthesis. Organisms grown in media that imitate natural conditions, or organisms collected from their natural habitat are usually dilute. Methods that assay <b>iron</b> nutritional <b>status</b> such as spectroscopy and column chromatography require large sample sizes which are difficult to obtain from natural samples. In addition, methods that utilize techniques such as immunology or radioactive labelling are complex and time-consuming. These considerations led to the necessity of developing a technique that would be simple, rapid and effective on dilute samples. The method developed here utilized fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC), which fulfilled these requirements. A complete analysis could be done within {{two to three hours}} with minimal sample treatment. The FPLC was simple to operate and was effective on a sample containing less than 100 μg of protein. Some photosynthetic organisms, when iron-depleted, can produce the flavin-containing protein flavodoxin (Flv). This protein substitutes for the iron-containing protein ferredoxin (Fd) in Fd-dependent reactions such as the light-induced reduction of NADP. The FPLC technique identified and quantified, in relative terms, Fd and Flv in the cell. Optical spectroscopy was used to verify FPLC retention time assignments. The results illustrated how the FPLC could be used to observe the changes in relative Fd and Flv content as a function of media iron concentration in cultures of the cyanobacterium Anabaena grown in the laboratory. It was found that Fd content decreased and Flv content increased with decreasing media iron concentration. In addition, samples of the cyanobacterium Trichodesmium collected from the ocean near Barbados were analyzed using FPLC to assay relative Fd and Flv content. By analogy with Anabaena, Fd and Flv retention times were identified. Using this technique conclusions could be drawn regarding the changing <b>iron</b> nutritional <b>status</b> of Trichodesmium in its natural habitat...|$|R

Methods: We measured <b>iron</b> <b>status,</b> brain function with event-related potentials (ERP) during a memory task, and memory performance in 4 - 6 month old infants. Results: Serum ferritin (sFt), but not hemoglobin was associated with an attenuated ERP response to novel versus familiar stimuli.

The study involved 32 pregnant women who were between 8 to 14 weeks gestation and 20 to 35 years of age. They were followed through pregnancy and their infants were followed until three months of age. Three-day dietary records, a questionnaire and a blood sample were completed at the initial visit (8 to 14 weeks gestation). Six of the nutrients analyzed were consumed in amounts less than the Recommended Dietary Allowances: iron 77 %, magnesium 58 %, zinc 51 %, vitamin B 6 65 %, folacin 30 % and pantothenic acid 89 %. Use of a prenatal vitamin/mineral supplement was beneficial in increasing most of these nutrients to within acceptable range. Zinc was not included in the supplement and thus remained at 51 % of the RDA. Magnesium was increased to 80 % of the RDA. Nutrient intakes were very similar to the USDA Nationwide Food Consumption Survey for pregnant women (1985). Mean <b>iron</b> <b>status</b> of the subjects was within acceptable range.

Women (18 - 28 y) non-smokers without chronic disease, anemia, pregnancy, and/or irregular menstrual cycles were randomly assigned to either a soy (n= 31) or an animal food (n= 32) group. Blood and urine samples and 3 -d dietary records were collected prior to and after intervention. At baseline, <b>iron</b> and zinc <b>status,</b> biochemical markers of bone, and thyroid hormones were not different between two groups. After intervention, no significant changes were observed in hemoglobin, transferrin saturation, serum iron, ferritin, or transferrin receptor concentrations, as well as the transferrin receptor-ferritin index. Intervention significantly decreased plasma zinc (5 yg/dl in each group) but not serum alkaline phosphatase (soy vs. animal food group: 1. 1 vs. 1. 2 IU/L) concentrations. Soy intake slightly increased (1. 5 U/L) bone-specific alkaline phosphatase concentration, with the change being significantly different from the animal food group (- 0. 7 U/L).

To examine this question, we performed an experiment with barley (Hordeum vulgare) plants under iron-limiting and iron-sufficient growth conditions. Plants were grown in an iron-limiting soil in root box microcosms. One-half of the plants were treated with foliar iron every day to inhibit phytosiderophore production and to alter root exudate composition. After 30 days, the bacterial communities associated with different root zones, including the primary root tips, nonelongating secondary root tips, sites of lateral root emergence, and older roots distal from the tip, were characterized by using 16 S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) fingerprints generated by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Our results showed that the microbial communities associated with the different root locations produced many common 16 S rDNA bands but that the communities could be distinguished by using correspondence analysis. Approximately 40 % of the variation between communities could be attributed to plant <b>iron</b> nutritional <b>status.</b> A sequence analysis of clones generated from a single 16 S rDNA band obtained at all of the root locations revealed that there were taxonomically different species in the same band, suggesting that the resolving power of DGGE for characterization of community structure at the species level is limited. Our results suggest that the bacterial communities in the rhizosphere are substantially different in different root zones and that a rhizosphere community may be altered by changes in root exudate composition caused by changes in plant <b>iron</b> nutritional <b>status...</b>|$|R
40|$|Effective iron supplementation {{does not}} happen in {{isolation}} Dear Sir: Recently, Ridwan et at (1) addressed the effectiveness of weekly and daily iron supplementation in pregnancy “under conditions similar to the ongoing antenatal care program, ” and Yip (2) addressed the general question of effectiveness of antenatal iron-supplementation programs. The population in Ridwan et al’s study was iron depleted, considering that> 60 % had hemoglobin concentrations < 1 10 g/L and between 30 % and 50 % had depleted iron reserves. This precluded the inclusion of unsupplemented control subjects. Their results illustrate the following: 1) Prepregnancy <b>iron</b> nutritional <b>status</b> was important be-cause from data in Tables 2 and 4, the mean end hemo...|$|R
