25|$|Tai Fu Tai Mansion (大夫第) in San Tin was {{probably}} built in 1865 in {{the reign of}} the Qing Dynasty. It is a richly embellished residence situated on a spacious ground, with a large open space in the front and a garden at the back. The whole compound is surrounded by a green-brick wall. It is a fine example of traditional Chinese dwellings of the scholar-gentry class and <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>one</b> of the most elegant buildings throughout the territory.|$|E
25|$|Not {{directly}} on the street but {{a short distance away}} on one of the side streets stands the Palazzo Belgioioso, one of the masterpieces of Milan's Neoclassical architecture. The building <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>one</b> of the finest examples of the Neoclassical citizens' residences and was a haunt of Milan's intellectuals. It was designed in 1772 by Giuseppe Piermarini who in this instance abandoned the sober and austere style of early Neoclassicism, building an imposing and highly decorated mansion which dominates the street. Here too, the most lavishly decorated part of the facade is the slightly protruding central section with a series of four giant columns, an entablature and a tympanum enclosed by pilasters. The ground floor is finished in rusticated bugnato ashlar, the first floor, separated from the second with bas-reliefs of heraldic symbols, has windows crowned with garlands and decorative mouldings. Some of the rooms still have period decorations, the most famous of which are the gallery decorated with frescoes by Martin Knoller and stuccos by Giocondo Albertolli. Rinaldo's room, also decorated by Knoller, was inspired by Torquato Tasso's epic poem Jerusalem Delivered.|$|E

Tentatively naming the first planet [...] "Oceanus", he placed their respective distances at 42, 56 and 72 AU from the Sun. He gave no indication as to how he determined their existence, and no known searches were mounted to locate them.|$|E

Although rebuilt to approximately the original proportions, the transitional detail between the square belfry and the conical spire was unfortunately eliminated. Also regrettable [...] is the recent replacement of the original wood-paneled entrance doors [...] The future of our finest Greek Revival church is uncertain [...] Destruction would be a loss to the entire community." ...|$|E
500|$|A [...] "Refugee Camp Mix" [...] of [...] "Blood on the Dance Floor" [...] {{appeared}} on Jackson's video collection, HIStory on Film, Volume II and Michael Jackson's Vision. The original song would later {{appear on the}} Number Ones DVD, which contained previously unreleased [...] scenes. Furthermore, Paterson recorded an unreleased, alternate version of the music video, shot with an 8 mm camera. Writer David Noh, described it as, [...] "grainy, overexposed, and sexy as shit". According to Paterson, [...] "Michael loved it, but Sony hated it and refused to release it". The New York Times described the United States promotional effort for the Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix campaign as [...] "subdued", creating [...] "hardly a sound" [...] and [...] "perplexing to {{many people in the}} industry". Jackson's label Epic Records, refuted allegations they were not promoting the album sufficiently, saying, [...] "We are completely behind the album... Michael <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>one</b> of our superstars and is treated as such... We just went into this one with our global hats on". The New York Times acknowledged that promotion was stronger internationally, where Jackson had more commercial force and popularity.|$|E

500|$|Musician and ambient music pioneer Brian Eno has {{praised the}} album and said, {{regarding}} the song [...] "Soon", that [...] "t {{set a new}} standard for pop.

[...] Robert Smith of The Cure discovered Loveless after a period of almost exclusively listening to [...] "disco, or Irish bands like the Dubliners" [...] as a means of avoiding his contemporaries, and said, [...] " [...] was the first band I heard who quite clearly pissed all over us, and their album Loveless <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>one</b> of my all-time three favourite records. It's the sound of someone [...] who is so driven that they're demented. And the fact that they spent so much time and money on it is so excellent." [...] Billy Corgan of The Smashing Pumpkins told Spin, [...] "It's rare in guitar-based music that somebody does something new [...] At the time, everybody was like, 'How the fuck are they doing this?' And, of course, it's way simpler than anybody would imagine." [...] Trey Anastasio of jam band Phish believed that [...] "Loveless [...] the best album recorded in the '90s", and wanted his band to cover the album in its entirety for a Halloween show. Robert Pollard of indie rock band Guided by Voices acknowledged the album as a source of inspiration, noting, [...] "Sometimes when I want to write lyrics, I'll listen to Loveless. Because of the way the vocals are buried, you can almost listen to the songs as if they're instrumental pieces." [...] Loveless has also been said by Jim DeRogatis to have been a considerable influence on British band Radiohead.|$|E

2500|$|King {{has called}} Richard Matheson [...] "the author who {{influenced}} me most as a writer". In a current edition of Matheson's The Shrinking Man, King is quoted: [...] "A horror story {{if there ever}} was one...a great adventure story—it <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>one</b> of that select handful that I have given to people, envying them the experience of the first reading." [...] Ray Bradbury is another influence, with King himself stating [...] "without Ray Bradbury, there is no Stephen King".|$|E
2500|$|King {{acknowledges}} {{the influence of}} Bram Stoker, particularly on his novel Salem's Lot, which he envisioned as a retelling of Dracula.

2500|$|Jordan's raucous {{recordings}} {{were also}} notable {{for their use}} of fantastical narrative. This is perhaps best exemplified on the freewheeling party adventure [...] "Saturday Night Fish Fry", a two-part 1950 hit that was split across {{both sides of a}} 78-rpm record. It is arguably one of the earliest American recordings to include all the basic elements of classic rock and roll (obviously exerting a direct influence on the subsequent work of Bill Haley), and it <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>one</b> of the first widely popular songs to use the word rocking in the chorus and to prominently feature a distorted electric guitar.|$|E
2500|$|On {{behalf of}} Jesus Freak Hideout, Michael Weaver opines [...] "Disciple {{is back in}} a big way with Attack. There really isn't much to pick apart...

[...] Mark Rice forecasts [...] "There is very little to dislike about Attack,... nothing to get upset about."

The concept of observing a subject from different points {{in space and time}} simultaneously (multiple or mobile perspective) [...] "to seize it from several successive appearances, which fused into a single image, reconstitute in time" [...] was also developed by Metzinger in his 1911 article, and to some extent in an article entitled Note sur la peinture, published in Pan, 1910.

2500|$|In 1959, Connery {{landed a}} leading role in Robert Stevenson's Walt Disney Productions film Darby O'Gill and the Little People (1959) {{alongside}} Albert Sharpe, Janet Munro, and Jimmy O'Dea. The film is a tale about a wily Irishman and his battle of wits with leprechauns. Upon the film's initial release, A. H. Weiler of the New York Times praised the cast (save Connery whom he described as [...] "merely tall, dark, and handsome") and thought the film an [...] "overpoweringly charming concoction of standard Gaelic tall stories, fantasy and romance.". In his book The Disney Films, film critic and historian Leonard Maltin stated that, [...] "Darby O'Gill and the Little People is not only one of Disney's best films, but <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>one</b> of the best fantasies ever put on film." [...] He also had prominent television roles in Rudolph Cartier's 1961 productions of Adventure Story and Anna Karenina for BBC Television, in the latter of which he co-starred with Claire Bloom.|$|E

2500|$|Like {{the other}} players in the Heartbreakers, Campbell avoids the virtuoso {{approach}} to playing, preferring to have his work {{serve the needs of}} each song. Guitar World magazine noted [...] "there are only a handful of guitarists who can claim to have never wasted a note. Mike Campbell <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>one</b> of them". He is a highly melodic player, often using two or three-strings-at-a-time leads instead of the more conventional one-at-a-time approach. [...] "People have told me that my playing sounds like bagpipes," [...] he muses. [...] "I'm not exactly sure what that means." [...] His estimation of his own style is typically modest: [...] "I don't think people can really top Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton as far as lead guitar goes. I like my playing to bring out the songs." [...] Like Tench, he is heavily involved in constructing the arrangements for the Heartbreakers' tunes. And also like Tench, he prefers rawness to polish in the studio and onstage.|$|E
