50|$|The ALX400 {{was also}} a big hit with Dublin Bus of Ireland, which ordered 658 between 2000 and 2006. 648 of them were fitted on Volvo B7TL chassis, AV 1-448 (AV means Alexander Volvo) were Volvo B7TL chassis, and AX 449-648 were on B7TL MKII chassis. During 2003 an order was placed for 10 TransBus Trident/ALX 400 {{versions}} known as DT 1-10 to compare against the AV class {{with a view to}} splitting future orders. Most of these featured 76 seat single <b>door</b> <b>bodies</b> although there were various seating capacities for on a small minority used and rail/airport services. Summerhill based AV 116-130 were built with dual <b>door</b> <b>bodies</b> for use on the Airlink services.|$|R
50|$|Other body {{types that}} soon became {{available}} were a Torpedo style two <b>door</b> “Touring” <b>body,</b> a “Roadster” and a two-door “Limousine” (sedan/saloon).|$|R
50|$|The four seat, two <b>door</b> <b>body</b> {{was made}} of steel and {{aluminium}} panel fitted over a wood and aluminium frame. The doors were rear hinged, an arrangement that got the name of suicide doors. Changes during the model life were minimal: however, the bonnet line was slightly lowered for 1948 when the car also acquired stoneguards on the leading edges of its rear wings.|$|E
50|$|The four-door Pathfinder was {{introduced}} in October 1989 to enhance the Pathfinder's market appeal, but the overall vehicle length and wheelbase were not extended to accommodate the rear doors. At its introduction to North America, 1985 to 1989 Pathfinders came with a two-door body. In early 1990 it became only a four door. Some US 1990 Pathfinders came with the two <b>door</b> <b>body,</b> but they are rare.|$|E
50|$|The {{final design}} had four seats. The engine was a {{two-cylinder}} air-cooled boxer 854 cc {{with a power}} rating of 18 HP at 3500 RPM. The engine, gear-box and half-axles were of unitary construction. The simple two <b>door</b> <b>body</b> had a timber frame. Although it was made purely to test different design ideas, it had good handling and could easily reach speeds of 80 km/h.|$|E
5000|$|After World War II, the use {{of suicide}} doors was mostly limited to rear doors of four-door sedans. The best-known use of suicide doors on post-World War II American {{automobiles}} was the Lincoln Continental 4 door convertibles and sedans (1961-1969) and Ford Thunderbird 1967-1971 four-door sedans. [...] The British Rover P4 cars also used rear suicide doors until their demise in 1964. German Goggomobil saloons and coupes had two <b>door</b> <b>bodies</b> with suicide <b>doors,</b> until these were changed to front-hinged in 1964.|$|R

50|$|In 1983 Marian Bublewicz {{became a}} driver of {{official}} FSO Rally Team, using such cars as Polonez 2000 Rally and Polonez 2000 Turbo. Marian was very hard-working {{and had a}} habit of spending as much time on training as he could so OBRSO (FSO Development Division) constructed special Polonez training car based on 3 <b>door</b> <b>body</b> with fiberglass parts like in 2000 Turbo but with much cheaper, modified 1.5 OHV engine and smaller dog-cluth gearbox instead of 2.0 DOHC turbocharged engine with more expensive transmission.In 1987 Bublewicz won Polish Championship behind the wheel of Polonez 2000 Rally and {{it was the last time}} when this car was used by FSO Rally Team. Since 1988 Bublewicz changed make and started using private Mazda 323 4WD because A group Polonez 1.5C Turbo was not competitive enough.|$|E
50|$|The Equipe GT was Bond's first four-wheel car, {{a sports}} car, with {{fibreglass}} two <b>door</b> <b>body.</b> Essentially {{it was a}} Triumph Herald chassis cab, complete with bulkhead, windscreen and doors, with the Triumph Spitfire 1147 cc engine. The doors had slightly revised glass, to accommodate the fibreglass, fastback roof and rear assembly. The Herald's forward hingeing bonnet was replaced with a revised version giving an excellent, clean sportscar-like appearance. This {{was replaced by the}} GT4S model in 1964, offering 4 seats, and an opening boot lid. In front, the beautiful Italianate bonnet styling was somewhat compromised by the addition of the quad headlights from the Reliant Scimitar, flanking a cut-down version of the original Herald grille. A bonnet scoop was also added. A 1296cc engine was introduced in 1967.During the life of this car, it was not uncommon to see Triumph Heralds modified by the fitting of a Bond Equipe bonnet, as all the side body lines matched perfectly. Less common were Bond Equipes, bizarrely fitted with Herald front ends.|$|E
5000|$|In {{development}} from February 1996 to December 1999, the Generation IV minivans {{were based on}} the Chrysler RS platform and featured a larger body frame with modified headlights and taillights. Design work by Brandon Faurote was approved in January 1997 and reached production approval in October 1997. Unveiled at the 2000 North American International Auto Show (NAIAS) on Monday, January 10, 2000, the RS minivans were released for sale in August 2000. The release was part of a promotional tie-in with Nabisco, which unveiled their new [...] "Mini Oreos" [...] inside the van during the unveiling. The first vans rolled off the line at the Windsor Assembly Plant on July 24.The RS minivans were sold as the Dodge Caravan, Chrysler Voyager and Chrysler Town & Country, in 4 <b>door</b> <b>body</b> styles. The Caravan was available in a long wheelbase model, called the Grand Caravan, while the Chrysler Voyager was a short wheelbase model with base levels of equipment and the Town & Country was only available with a long wheelbase and was the highest end model. The U.S. and Canadian market Chrysler Voyager was originally intended to be a Plymouth, but became a Chrysler with the discontinuation of the Plymouth brand in 2000. This model was also exported, while the Town & Country was exported as a high-level model of the Voyager. Export models had the platform designation RG.|$|E

5000|$|The Ford Aspire {{was sold}} in North America from 1993 to 1997. It was the {{replacement}} for the Ford Festiva. It was the first car in its class to have dual airbags standard and antilock brakes optional. It came in two and four <b>door</b> <b>body</b> styles, both hatchbacks. The two door was available in base and SE trim while the four door was only available in base trim. The SE model offered a sporting package that consisted of fog lights, rear spoiler, alloy wheels, blue face instrument cluster with tachometer, and upgraded interior trim. The Aspire had very few options for the base model: cassette player, automatic transmission, rear defrost and wiper, alloy wheels, and a comfort and convenience package that had several minor interior upgrades. Due to slow sales the SE model was dropped after 1995 along {{with all of its}} optional equipment. The base model also lost its optional alloy wheels and rear wiper, making the Aspire a true [...] "stripper" [...] of a car. The performance with the five-speed was acceptable but the automatic was slower with 0-60 times at 16.2 seconds. Power steering was only available with the five-door automatic. The Aspire was given a facelift in 1997 with redesigned front and rear bumpers, a new radio, and new seat facings. In August 1997, Ford announced the Aspire would be discontinued due to slow sales. The last one rolled off the assembly line on September 26, 1997.|$|E

50|$|The true Minx {{replacement}} was the Isuzu Bellett. Introduced in June 1963, the Bellett {{was actually}} slightly {{smaller than the}} Minx, and the styling was much more low-slung. The Bellett was available in “Standard”, “DeLuxe” and “Sport” variants, with both 2 and 4 <b>door</b> <b>bodies</b> and came with a 1471 cc petrol motor or an 1800cc diesel. At the same time Isuzu released the Bellett Express estate with 1300 cc and 1500 cc engines. The Bellett Express, while looking completely different from the Hillman Express, had similar features like two doors, side hinged tailgate and sliding rear passenger windows. Isuzu did not drop the Minx {{as soon as the}} Bellett was introduced; they continued to produce it until mid-1964.|$|R
