40|$|The rapid {{development}} of Web technologies has driven a broad implementation of network-based {{applications in the}} financial industry, as well as resulted {{in a variety of}} cyber risks throughout the domain. As one of the risk management solutions, cybersecurity insurance (CI) is an alternative solution for dealing with cybersecurity risk in the financial industry by transferring some of the risk burden to an insurance company. It has become a popular approach for compensating some of the financial loses of cybersecurity events. ^ However, the cost of cybersecurity insurance also leads to a heavy financial burden, which also affects risk mitigations when it is applied. The major problem is the difficulty of maximizing insurance returns by selecting insured items in terms of their demands under the certain financial budget. ^ The problem of the research is to find an adaptive approach for financial service institutions to achieve an efficient and effective cybersecurity risks transfer by using cybersecurity insurance under a firm financial budget. The difficulties address few aspects, including understanding cyber incidents and their threats levels, cognizing the relationships between cyber incidents, cybersecurity <b>insurance</b> <b>items,</b> and making decisions on selecting <b>insurance</b> <b>items</b> considering both financial costs and insurance demands. ^ To address the issues above, this dissertation concentrates on the problem of maximizing the cybersecurity insurance returns in terms of the available funds. ^ The main contributions of this work are threefold; First, we perform feasibility study starting with proposing a novel secure big data cyber incident analytics framework based on the survey, which is designed to produce a strategy map for implementing cybersecurity insurance under a certain financial constraint; second, we develop an approach using cyber incident classification for ontology-based knowledge representation, which is supported by semantic cyber incident classification model; finally, we create a new approach of risk prediction model based on decision tree method for information classification. ^ The research solves the problem of cybersecurity insurance plan generation by developing a cost reduction strategy with Greedy algorithm run through two rounds of greedy to obtain cost effective plan with higher cyber risk weight. We implement experimental evaluations to prove the effectiveness and performances and the results show that our proposed framework and models are feasible for practical deployments. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: This study {{examined}} attitudes about research, {{knowledge of the}} research process, reasons for and satisfaction with participation in a dental clinical trial {{as a function of}} demographic characteristics. Materials and methods: 180 adults were invited to complete a 47 -item survey at the completion of a 10 -week dental product study at a Midwestern academic dental center. Seven demographic items included gender, race/ethnicity, age, education, household income, location of usual dental care, and dental <b>insurance.</b> Forty <b>items</b> assessed: attitudes about research; knowledge of the research process; perception of the study team; perceived risks/benefits; health perceptions; and general satisfaction with the study. Results: 176 participants completed the questionnaire for a 98 % response rate. African Americans were more likely to attribute Fate/God as more important to their health and their willingness to participate in research than whites, and more likely to report non-supportive social norms when compared to whites and other groups. Individuals in the 45 – 59 age group were less likely to attribute financial reimbursement as a motivator for their participation in research compared to all other age groups. Individuals with less education rated Fate/God attitudes as important to their research participation, reported lower autonomy for participation, and reported less supportive social norms compared to those with some college education. Participants in the four income categories showed significant differences in reasons for participation and desire for free care. Conclusion: Motivations for participation of a Midwestern population of research subjects are dependent on age, ethnicity, belief in Fate/God, education, social norms and income...|$|R

If the pawnshop owner believes that the local market for used laptops is saturated (overloaded with used laptops), they may fear that they will only get $100 for the laptop if they have to unload it to a wholesaler. With that figure in mind as the expected revenue, the pawnshop owner has to factor in the overhead costs of the store (rent, heat, electricity, phone connection, yellow pages advertisement, website costs, staff costs, <b>insurance,</b> alarm system, <b>items</b> lost when they are confiscated by police, etc.), and a profit for the business. As such, the customer who comes in with this laptop that they paid $1000 for when it was new may be offered as little as $50 by the pawnshop owner, who is taking into account all of the risk and cost factors.|$|R

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the validity of}} a questionnaire designed to measure the satisfaction of users of health services, using multiple tests of construct validity. Members of 2 health insurance plans in Geneva (Switzerland) answered a mailed questionnaire in 1992 (n = 1007) and 1993 (n = 1424). Response rates were 82 %, participants were 18 - 44 years old in 1992. The questionnaire included 22 questions on satisfaction with medical care received during the past 12 months. Most items were adapted from the Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire. Four dimensions of satisfaction were measured: satisfaction with physician services (8 items), communication (8 items), access (4 <b>items)</b> and <b>insurance</b> services (2 <b>items).</b> Reliability (Cronbach's [alpha]) was satisfactory for the 2 former dimensions ([alpha] = 0. 81 and 0. 82 respectively), but lower than desired for the 2 latter ([alpha] = 0. 63 and 0. 49 respectively). Participants who gave positive open-ended comments had satisfaction scores 0. 7 - 1. 2 standard deviation units higher than participants who gave negative comments. Satisfaction scores were weakly correlated with satisfaction with private life, which indicates that the instrument did not simply measure a general tendency to be satisfied. Participants who said that care received in 1993 was worse than care received in 1992 (retrospective assessment) experienced a decrease in satisfaction scores between 1992 and 1993 (prospective assessment). Most validation procedures provided independent but partial evidence for {{the validity of the}} instrument.

40|$|The article {{presents}} complex, systematic  {{study of the}} political aspects of human trafficking. Today human trafficking gained the grand scale of its spreading and it has affected almost all European countries and their neighboring regions. Nowadays {{there are a lot}} of kinds and forms of human exploitation. Although slavery was abolished in 1957, today human exploitation is still widespread both in traditional form and in more modern ones. So «trading in personality» is the feature of the economy of the late XX century. The expediency of analysis of the negative impacts of globalization and illegal immigration in the context of the problem is identified. Globalization has engrossed almost all spheres of human life nowadays and has affected not only economic, political and social processes but also those ones which are connected with activity of criminal groups giving them transboundary nature. Very often human trafficking is confused with illegal migration since both phenomena are connected with shadow economy and they constantly fuel corruption, money laundering, hindering economic and democratic development of society. Human traffickers use illegal migration and people smuggling for providing more profits because they don’t need to spend significant money on documents production, legalization, <b>insurance</b> and other <b>items</b> required by law. The negative international results of human trafficking are researched by the author. Namely, problems of governance organization that are created by powerful criminal groups of human traffickers and smugglers, mass stay of a significant number of non­citizens in the country; formation of the negative international image of the origin, destination or transit country as the state which is unable to counter effectively illegal migration and human trafficking...|$|R
40|$|Banks have {{risks in}} {{providing}} bank loans to the debtor; therefore bank requires collateral to grant loans. The collateral of moving objects {{given by the}} debtor must follow the transfer of ownership on trust to the bank in accordance on Law No. 42 Year 1999 on Fiduciary Guarantee. This intends to obtain legal certainty of guarantees execution, hence {{the execution of the}} collateral can be completed easitly. This study employs a descriptive method, intended to provide the data as complete as possible about the execution process of collaterals and the actions. This will be executed by PT. BPR Armindo Kencana Batu when the collaterals completely destroyed or lost. Source of data were secondary data which were obtained from a second souerce or not from the original source. Secondary data could from the data presented in the formbof tables. Graphs, etc. Data collection were taken from documentation, meanwhile the data were analyzed by using qualitative descriptive method. This study aimed at investigating the execution process of fiduciary guarantee object done by PT. BPR Armindo Kencana Batu. In addition, it also intended to know the way in solving the loans problem and determining the actions of PT. BPR Armindo Kencana Batu in case the collateral was destroyed or lost. The results of this study revealed that the execution of the collateral is the last effort of bank in case the debtor of bank was default. The executions were done by three ways; they were the execution with the sale by the hand, the execution with the sale of fiduciary powers, and lastly the execution with the execulator title. Execution by the execulator title were used if the debtor has less good intention to pay off all of its obligations. The next results on the bank acts when fiduciary guarantee was destroyed or lost/ scorch were by registrating the collateral to the insurance institution since the first item received by the bank. Along with the <b>insurance</b> when the <b>items</b> were lost or destroyed, therefore banks can claim against the insurance institution to get compensation for lost destroyed collateral...|$|R
40|$|Questions in {{development}} economics often {{focus on the}} poor’s limited access to capital and, in particular, on their high interest rate for borrowing. Despite this high price for capital, many poor households borrow substantial amounts for production and consumption. This situation suggests that the poor have access to very productive investment opportunities and face periods {{when they have a}} very strong desire to consume more than their current income. This brief explores the role of microfinance in paying for unexpected consumption expenditures. Motivated by high borrowing costs among the poor, a large number and wide variety of organizations have made efforts to expand the availability of credit and decrease interest rates. Microfinance organizations are one prominent example, and loans are often also provided by banks, moneylenders, family, friends, and other local associations. Households also finance major expenditures using cash savings, funds from rotating savings groups, the sale or pawning of household <b>items,</b> <b>insurance</b> or entitlement programs, or gifts. Indeed, financial diaries show that the poor simultaneously use a large number of formal and informal financial instruments. It is not clear whether this large number of financial instruments represents an economic success or failure. Assuming that the poor are not simply tricked, each of these instruments is fulfilling some demand that is not met by the other instruments. This reflects a great deal of adaptability in creating and adopting different instruments, but it also reflects the limited capabilities of each particular instrument individually. Even when each source can supply only a limited amount of capital, borrowers often do not use them to the fullest extent possible, despite seemingly substantial overlap in the services provided by each instrument. Encouraging the creation of new financial instruments to cover unmet demands is a patchwork solution to these problems. It would be useful to understand what underlying rigidities prevent some products from substituting for others. Such an understanding would both help in developing new instruments and potentially allow for more direct corrections to the underlying financing challenges faced by the poor. For example, for unexpected consumption expenditures, there is an inherent importance in having fast access to funds. If a household member experiences a sudden illness, accident, or pregnancy complication, receiving immediate hospital care will often require substantial upfront payments. Microfinance clients may be able to obtain funds on a regular schedule for business investments, but not necessarily for immediate health expenditures. 2020 Vision Focus; BriefPRIFPRI 1; GRP 4; 2020 MTI...|$|R
40|$|The {{reform of}} work unit (Danwei) system since 1980 s has {{substantially}} influenced spatial structure {{as well as}} people's life style in urban China. How to understand the great transformation of work unit system {{is very important to}} disentangle the socio-economic restructuring processes of Chinese cities. In this paper, we explained the origin, function and transformation of work unit system through literature study and enterprise interview, then we analyze the implication of work unit system reform, as one aspect of institutional changes in China, to people's daily life and urban spatial structure. There has been increasing interests in work unit system and its transformation. The earliest work came from sociological perspective, which has focused on such topics as the origin of work unit and its political-economic background, its organizational structures and power balance, multiple functions of a typical work unit, as well as the dependence of individuals to the work unit. In other words, sociologists pay more attention on the mechanism of work unit system, especially the control and dependence among the state, work unit and individual. Geographers, however, first noticed the role of work unit system through their studies on the urban spatial restructuring. Work unit system and its reform are regarded as the main constraints as well as impetus of the transformation of urban land use and social space. However, up to the present, many studies still remained rather descriptive. In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework of work unit studies, while arguing that geographers should and are able to combine the two approaches. Work unit system is a series of institutions and systems of production organization and social control based on work units, which includes two main systems: personnel administration system and welfare system. The former includes authorized staff administration system, employment system, wage system, and employee evaluation and training system. The latter includes housing welfare system, collective consumption system, entertainment welfare system, subsidy system, and social security welfare system. Thus, work unit becomes the "cell" of urban society in China, which not only controls resource allocation and production organization, but is responsible to the social control and social welfare. A work unit is more of a "whole community" than merely a factory or a administrative organization. Work unit system has experienced great transformation since the adoption of the reform and open policy. One fundamental change was the breakdown of the "whole community" of Danwei. Market mechanism was introduced into social production sphere. The organization of work units has gradually been marketized to meet the requirement of market competition. Therefore, social welfare system was gradually separated from work units, i. e. it has been socialized and marketized too. Work units are no longer responsible to the provision of housing, health <b>insurance</b> or other <b>items</b> of social welfare. The reform aimed at work unit system has been one main impetus of the transformation of people's life style and daily life space. Within work unit system, people not only work in Danwei, live in the dwellings allocated as a type of welfare within the Danwei compound (Dayuan). Thus, not only the social relationship, but also the daily life is constrained within Danwei compound. Since the reform, however, individual's dependence to Danwei and work unit system has been weakened. With the breakdown of work unit system, urban residents now have more freedom in choosing jobs and residence. Consequently, job mobility and residential mobility both have been increasing. Home-work relationship has also been greatly shifted, due to the relocation of job opportunities and residences, from home-work proximity to increasingly long-distance commuting. Besides, people's activity space {{is becoming more and more}} extended from work unit compound (Dayuan). For example, our empirical studies on individual shopping space and leisure space have reveal the expansion and differentiation of residents'daily activity spaces of urban China. Urban morphology also experienced substantial restructuring process accompany with the breakdown of work unit system. Urban expansion is now more generated and influenced by urban redevelopment, the construction of industrial parks and residential communities, contrary to the significance of the Danwei construction before the reform. Consequently to the expansion and diversification of people's commuting space, housing search space, and activity space (such as shopping space and leisure space), major cities in China has been facing substantial restructuring. In addition, there has been a more and more apparent trend of urban socio-spatial stratification based on residential location. In the end, we argue that work unit system, although weaken, is still an important factor, to some extent, in urban China, which we call "the concealment of Danwei system". In some cities, residents still expect a "whole community" of Danwei, and Danwei is still the main source of welfare of them. Therefore, work unit system, as well as its transformation continues to be one main perspective of understanding urban China, which requires further studies...|$|R
