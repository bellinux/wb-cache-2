40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>epimestrol</b> (5 mg every 6 hours for 5 days) on basal levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), {{prolactin}} (Prl), estradiol, progesterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, {{and on the}} response to LH-releasing hormone (LH-RH) and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) stimulation, were studied in 18 cases of secondary amenorrhea and oligomenorrhea of hypothalamic-pituitary origin, in three cases of anorexia nervosa, in two cases of long-lasting progestin-induced amenorrhea, and in one case of precocious menopause. The results in the first 18 patients indicate that <b>epimestrol</b> treatment induces {{a significant increase in}} LH and Prl levels after 24 hours, while the FSH increase becomes significant only after 4 days of therapy. Twelve hours after discontinuation of treatment, all three hormone levels decreased significantly to values similar to the basal levels, while the pituitary response to LH-RH indicated a much more marked LH secretion than before treatment. A second test, performed 36 hours after the last drug administration, again showed a significantly higher LH response than that found under basal conditions. No significant variations were observed in the FSH response to LH-RH, nor in the Prl response to TRH. These data suggest that <b>epimestrol</b> interferes {{at the level of the}} centers responsible for Prl and gonadotropin secretion in the manner of a weak estrogen...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the effects of estrogens and androgens on hypothalamic beta-endorphin (beta-EP) concentrations. Intact or castrated female rats were chronically (2 weeks) treated with estrogen (estradiol benzoate) and/or antiestrogens (clomiphene, cyclophenil or <b>epimestrol),</b> and with androgens (dihydrotestosterone or dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate) and/or antiandrogen (cyproterone acetate). A group of rats treated with vehicle were studied as comparison. The beta-EP concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay on acidic extracts of rat hypothalami. The administration of clomiphene and cyclophenil significantly reduced hypothalamic beta-EP concentrations in intact rats, while both drugs or estradiol benzoate increased the peptide concentration in castrated rats. Both intact and castrated rats treated with <b>epimestrol</b> showed hypothalamic beta-EP concentrations higher than vehicle treated rats. The estradiol-induced increase of beta-EP was not changed by the concomitant administration of antiestrogens. The administration of dihydrotestosterone significantly decreased beta-EP concentrations in both intact and castrated female rats, while the treatment with dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate only slightly decreased beta-EP levels in intact female rats. The cyproterone acetate-chronically treated rats showed higher beta-EP concentrations than vehicle-treated rats and these changes were reversed by the concomitant addition of dihydrotestosterone or dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate. These results showed that estrogens play a positive role while androgens negatively influence the hypothalamic beta-EP concentrations in female rats, supporting the view that central beta-EP might be a target of gonadal steroid feedback signals...|$|E
