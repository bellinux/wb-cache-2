5|$|Although {{described}} as a satellite terminal, the terminal building is connected by an above-ground corridor to Terminal 2. Departures {{take place on the}} lower deck (similar to the A380 boarding lounges currently in use at Gates 9 and 11), with arrivals streamed on to the <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> to connect with the current <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> arrivals deck. All gates including 18 and 20 are now handling passengers.|$|E

5|$|At {{some point}} in the 18th century, {{possibly}} in 1753, the upper and lower halves of the tower were divided into two separate areas. The spiral staircase from the ground floor kitchen to the upper floors, holding the records, was removed, and a window on the <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> was turned into a doorway so that the upper floors could be accessed from the neighbouring house. A fire-resistant stone vaulted ceiling was installed in on the <b>first</b> <b>floor,</b> possibly also in 1753 at a cost of £350.|$|E

5|$|Bodily {{and spiritual}} needs were {{balanced}} symmetrically within the mansion: the kitchen (16) and the chapel (7) were both large two-storied halls, {{rising from the}} semi-basement to the <b>first</b> <b>floor.</b> This design not only provided a great and lofty space, but also allowed the servants to worship in the chapel without leaving the service floor, while their employers would worship from a private gallery, complete with fireplace, overlooking the chapel on the <b>first</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Escalier Murat (Murat Staircase) is {{the main}} {{staircase}} in the palace, linking the ground and <b>first</b> <b>floors.</b>|$|R
5|$|Several {{types of}} {{irregular}} construction styles {{were incorporated into}} the building that contributed to its mass and strength not being uniform throughout the structure. These differences in strength allowed damage to be concentrated {{in one or more}} areas rather than being distributed equally and reduced the building's ability to sustain the tremors. Two of the irregularities of the building were the end shear walls that stopped below the second floor and the <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> carrying its load via square support columns. The result of the design was that the <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> was less stiff than the upper floors, and during the earthquake the building sustained uneven damage distribution, a condition that may have led to the complete collapse of the building in a larger earthquake. Because of its failure at the foundation and <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> level, the building was considered a total loss and was ultimately demolished.|$|E
5|$|The State Apartments {{form the}} {{major part of}} the Upper Ward and lie along {{the north side of the}} quadrangle. The modern {{building}} follows the medieval foundations laid down by Edward III, with the ground floor comprising service chambers and cellars, and the much grander <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> forming the main part of the palace. On the <b>first</b> <b>floor,</b> the layout of the western end of the State Apartments is primarily the work of architect Hugh May, whereas the structure on the eastern side represents Jeffry Wyatville's plans.|$|E
5|$|The central {{chimney stack}} exists, but the {{back-to-back}} fireplaces have been blocked. The staircase may have originally been located {{to one side}} of the back-to-back fireplaces, but no evidence of this remains. There are two rooms on the upstairs floor, the southern one having been partitioned, plus an additional two rooms in the attic complete with modern fittings. The <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> and attic was used as a flat, with a kitchen, living room and office on the <b>first</b> <b>floor,</b> and two bedrooms in the attic. The roof is thought to be from around 1800 but has subsequently been strengthened.|$|E

50|$|The {{accommodation}} {{within this}} extension comprises the principal staircase providing access between {{the ground and}} <b>first</b> <b>floors</b> only. Access to the garret above this was via an inserted doorway within {{the west side of}} the roof-slope over the east wing. It is assumed that the doorway within the roof slope was added in conjunction with this southwest extension. It is probable that the corridors on the ground and <b>first</b> <b>floors</b> were added as part of this extension creating good circulation between all the rooms on the ground and <b>first</b> <b>floors.</b> Such an arrangement would have modernised the house, instead of separate means of access within separate wings, greater access and efficiency was achieved, facilitating the movement of staff throughout the building as well as the family and their guests.|$|R
5|$|The {{community}} center, {{opening in}} 2016 {{in the same}} space, was designed by architectural firm Peter F. Gaito & Associates. It holds a meeting room and kitchen on the <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> and an oculus opening on the full-length second floor, which is intended for presentations, exhibits, reading, studying, and computer usage. The community center also has a backup generator for use as an emergency broadcast and a warming and cooling center. It can hold 80 people on its <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> and 110 on its second, and has movable furniture and a large television on each floor to accommodate a variety of programming.|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} castle {{centred on}} a stone tower-keep, measuring 60 feet by 24 feet (18 m by 7 m) internally and 54 feet (16 m) tall, with four round corner-towers. The tower-keep had eight-foot (2.4 m) thick walls made from Lias Oolite ashlar stone and was designed around three floors. The corner towers had conical roofs and prominent machicolations. The ground floor of the tower-house included the kitchen and other service areas. The functions {{of the first and}} second floors are uncertain; one theory is that the <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> was another service area, with the hall on the second floor; another approach argues that the <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> formed the hall, and the second floor living accommodation; a minority view proposes that the <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> was an armoury. The third floor was used as living accommodation for the owning family. The original design had a number of windows and fireplaces on the upper floors, but the hall would have been relatively dark and the stairs were inconveniently narrow.|$|E
5|$|The wooden stairs {{leading to}} the <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> {{replaced}} an earlier stone staircase, the remains {{of which can be}} seen protruding from the walls. The front room on the <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> had previously been partitioned, but the larger space was created when the new front wall was added to the building. Its roof has arched braced wooden trusses. The rear room still has the remains of a large fireplace, however, the chimney was blocked when the downstairs fireplace was installed.|$|E

5|$|As of 2012 {{the ground}} and top floors of the main house, {{together}} with the adjacent wings, are used as accommodation for the elderly. The reception rooms of the <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> {{are open to the}} public at advertised times, and are entered by the original stairway on the south front; they contain paintings and furniture collected by the Leicester family. Some items in the collection had formerly been displayed on this floor, whilst others were moved from elsewhere in the house. The <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> may also be hired for weddings, meetings, and conferences. It is managed by a trust, which is supported by a group of Friends and by volunteers.|$|E
5|$|At 9:30pm Sgt David Pengelly led {{the unit}} into Broadwater Farm to protect firemen who had earlier been {{forced out of}} the estate's Tangmere block, where a fire had started in the Centra Supermarket on the <b>first</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|E
5|$|Below {{the tower}} is an Italianate building. On {{the ground floor}} was the Scarlet Drawing Room and a {{vestibule}} with an annexe which housed a kitchen and offices. The <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> held the Crimson Drawing Room, sanctuary and library.|$|E

5|$|From November 1984 to June 1987 the DeKalb County Courthouse {{underwent}} {{an interior}} restoration, which {{was completed in}} time for the sesquicentennial celebration for DeKalb County. The restoration, at an approximate cost of $100,000, was undertaken by Conrad Schmitt Studios of New Berlin, Wisconsin. The modern front doors to the courthouse hide the original, beveled glass front doors from view. Once inside the modern doors, the nonfunctional original doors can be seen, standing wide open, to be admired; each door weighs several hundred pounds. Past the doors, in the building's main lobby, is the large, marble staircase to the second floor. The staircase, as well as the lobby's wainscoting, is done in gray Tennessee marble. Most of the <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> is original to the building, including the hexagonal marble flooring, stained glass windows and two original, <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> courtrooms. The plasterwork along the walls and ceilings of the lobby is ornately decorated.|$|E
5|$|Having {{served for}} many years as Moore's Coleridge Cottage Inn, the {{building}} was acquired for the nation in 1908, and the following year it was {{handed over to the}} National Trust. On 23 May 1998, following a £25,000 appeal by the Friends of Coleridge and the National Trust, two further rooms on the <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> were opened.|$|E
