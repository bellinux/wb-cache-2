50|$|A {{number of}} {{chelators}} of divalent cations have different fluorescence spectra in the bound and unbound states. Chelators for Ca2+ are well established, have high {{affinity for the}} cation, and low interference from other ions. Mg2+ chelators lag behind and the major <b>fluorescence</b> <b>dye</b> for Mg2+ (mag-fura 2) actually has a higher affinity for Ca2+. This limits the application of this dye to cell types where the resting level of Ca2+ is < 1 μM and does not vary with the experimental conditions under which Mg2+ is to be measured. Recently, Otten et al. (2001) have described work into {{a new class of}} compounds that may prove more useful, having significantly better binding affinities for Mg2+. The use of the fluorescent dyes is limited to measuring the free Mg2+. If the ion concentration is buffered by the cell by chelation or removal to subcellular compartments, the measured rate of uptake will give only minimum values of km and Vmax.|$|E
