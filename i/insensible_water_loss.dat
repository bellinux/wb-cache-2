40|$|The shuttle crew {{wears the}} Advanced Crew Escape Spacesuit (ACES) to protect {{themselves}} from cabin decompression and to support bail out during landing. ACES is cooled by a liquid-cooled garment (LCG) that interfaces to a heat exchanger that dumps heat into the cabin. The ACES outer layer is made of Gore-Tex(Registered TradeMark), permitting water vapor to escape while containing oxygen. The crew can only lose heat via <b>insensible</b> <b>water</b> <b>losses</b> and the LCG. Under nominal landing operations, the average cabin temperature rarely exceeds 75 F, which is adequate for the ACES to function. Problem A rescue shuttle will need to return 11 crew members if the previous mission suffers a thermal protection system failure, preventing it from returning safely to Earth. Initial analysis revealed that 11 crew members in the shuttle will increase cabin temperature at wheel stop above 80 F, which decreases the ACES ability to keep crew members cool. Air flow in the middeck of the shuttle is inhomogeneous and some ACES may experience much higher temperatures that could cause excessive thermal stress to crew members. Methods A ground study was conducted to measure the cooling efficiency of the ACES at 75 F, 85 F, and 95 F at 50 % relative humidity. Test subjects representing 5, 50, and 95 percentile body habitus of the astronaut corps performed hand ergometry keeping their metabolic rate at 400, 600, and 800 BTU/hr for one hour. Core temperature was measured by rectal probe and skin, while inside and outside the suit. Environmental chamber wall and cooling unit inlet and outlet temperatures were measured using high-resolution thermistors (0. 2 C). Conclusions Under these test conditions, the ACES was able to protect the core temperature of all test subjects, however thermal stress due to high insensible losses and skin temperature and skin heat flow may impact crew performance. Further research should be performed to understand the impact on cognitive performance...|$|R
40|$|Literature {{from the}} past 168 years has been {{filtered}} to provide a unified summary of the regional distribution of cutaneous <b>water</b> and electrolyte <b>losses.</b> The former occurs via transepidermal water vapour diffusion and secretion from the eccrine sweat glands. Daily <b>insensible</b> <b>water</b> <b>losses</b> for a standardised individual (surface area 1. 8 m 2) will be 0. 6 – 2. 3 L, with the hands (80 – 160 g. h− 1) and feet (50 – 150 g. h− 1) losing the most, {{the head and neck}} losing intermediate amounts (40 – 75 g. h− 1) and all remaining sites losing 15 – 60 g. h− 1. Whilst sweat gland densities vary widely across the skin surface, this same individual would possess some 2. 03 million functional glands, with the highest density on the volar surfaces of the fingers (530 glands. cm− 2) and the lowest on the upper lip (16 glands. cm− 2). During passive heating that results in a resting whole-body sweat rate of approximately 0. 4 L. min− 1, the forehead (0. 99 mg. cm− 2. min− 1), dorsal fingers (0. 62 mg. cm− 2. min− 1) and upper back (0. 59 mg. cm− 2. min− 1) would display the highest sweat flows, whilst the medial thighs and anterior legs will secrete the least (both 0. 12 mg. cm− 2. min− 1). Since sweat glands selectively reabsorb electrolytes, the sodium and chloride composition of discharged sweat varies with secretion rate. Across whole-body sweat rates from 0. 72 to 3. 65 mg. cm− 2. min− 1, sodium losses of 26. 5 – 49. 7 mmol. L− 1 could be expected, with the corresponding chloride loss being 26. 8 – 36. 7 mmol. L− 1. Nevertheless, there can be threefold differences in electrolyte losses across skin regions. When exercising in the heat, local sweat rates increase dramatically, with regional glandular flows becoming more homogeneous. However, intra-regional evaporative potential remains proportional to each local surface area. Thus, {{there is little evidence that}} regional sudomotor variations reflect an hierarchical distribution of sweating either at rest or during exercise...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the discontinuous ventilation cycle (DVC) observed in many insects, including all ants described to date, is an adaptation to reduce respiratory <b>water</b> <b>loss.</b> To test this hypothesis, it is necessary to measure respiratory <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> as a percentage of total <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> and to estimate what sustained rates of <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> would be in the absence of spiracular control. We used two independent techniques to measure real-time <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> rates in female alates of Pogonomyrmex rugosus. The first measured water vapor emission and CO 2 production simultaneously using dual-wavelength infrared absorbance analysis (DWIRAA). The second measured <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> gravimetrically. Real-time measurement allowed the separation of cuticular <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> rates (interburst) from <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> rates during the ventilation phase (burst) of the DVC. Cuticular permeability of P. rugosusfemale alates was only 27 ngh 21 cm 22 Pa 21, one-third of that reported for workers of the same species and the lowest yet reported for ants. Partly because of this low cuticular permeability, respiratory <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> represented a greater percentage of overall <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> (13 %) than has generally been reported for other insects. The DWIRAA and gravimetric techniques gave equivalent results. Peak rates of <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> during the burst phase were 2. 8 -fold higher than cuticular <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> rates alone (7. 68 mgg 21 h 21 versus 2. 77 mg 21 h 21 at 25 ˚C). This is a conservative estimate of <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> rates in the absence of spiracular control. Contrary to findings in certain other insects that suggest a negligible role for respiratory <b>water</b> <b>loss,</b> we find that, in an insect that employs the DVC and has low cuticular permeability, overall <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> rates rise several-fold in the absence of direct spiracular control. Our findings lend strong support to the water conservation hypothesis for the role of the DVC. In at least some insects, respiratory <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> rates can reach magnitudes significant enough, relative to other routes of <b>water</b> <b>loss,</b> for strong selective pressure to act on them...|$|R

Hypernatremia can result from untreated <b>insensible</b> <b>water</b> <b>loss,</b> leading to possible cere-bral complications. A new type of fiber used in the Jostra Quadrox D oxygenator has recently been approved for use in the United States of America.

This research compared gravimetric <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> (extimated with load cells) of four containerized landscape tree species with <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> estimated with TDPs. Over a 66 day period, an experiment compared <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> of three established, 5. 0 cm (2 in) caliper poplar (Populus nigra 2 ̆ 7 Italica 2 ̆ 7) trees in 75 -liter (20 gal) containers on load cells to TDP estimated <b>water</b> <b>loss.</b> Each tree had a single 30 mm (1. 2 inch) TDP inserted into the trunk at four heights above soil level (15, 30, 45, and 60 cm (6, 12, 18, and 24 in, respectively)). Data revealed TDP estimated <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> was less than load cell estimated <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> regardless of TDP height, but TDP estimated <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> at the 30 cm height was closes to actual load cell estimated tree <b>water</b> <b>loss.</b> Over the next three years, similar sized Bradford pear (Pyrus calleryana 2 ̆ 7 Bradford 2 ̆ 7), English oak (Quercus robur x Q. bicolor 2 ̆ 7 Asjes 2 ̆ 7), poplar (Populus deltoides 2 ̆ 7 Siouxland 2 ̆ 7), and sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua 2 ̆ 7 Rotundiloba 2 ̆ 7) trees in containers were placed on load cells and one 30 mm TDP was placed into the trunk of each tree 30 cm above soil level.

40|$|Respiratory <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> in insects is a {{controversial}} topic. Whilst earlier studies considered respiratory transpiration a significant component of overall <b>water</b> <b>loss,</b> {{to the extent}} that it was thought to be responsible not only for the evolution of discontinuous gas exchange cycles (DGCs) but also for variation in DGC patterns, later work repeatedly questioned its importance. In particular, investigations of the proportional contribution of respiratory transpiration to total <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> in species showing DGCs suggested that respiratory transpiration was unlikely to be important in these species. In turn, these studies have been criticized on analytical grounds. In this study we investigated variation in cuticular and respiratory <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> rates in five Scarabaeus dung beetle species, all of which show discontinuous gas exchange cycles, to ascertain the significance of respiratory <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> using modern analytical techniques. In particular, we determined whether there is variation in <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> rates amongst these beetles, whether both respiratory and cuticular <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> rates contribute significantly to variation in the former, and whether metabolic rate variation and variation in the duration of the DGC periods contribute significantly to variation in respiratory <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> rate. Total <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> rate varied such that species from arid areas had the lowest rates of <b>water</b> <b>loss,</b> and both cuticular and spiracular transpiration contributed significantly to variation in overall <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> rate. Moreover, variation in metabolic rate and in the duration of the DGC periods contributed significantly to variation in respiratory <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> rate. By contrast, examination of proportional <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> revealed little other than that it varies between 6. 5 % and 21 %, depending on the species and the temperature at which it was examined.

40|$|Dehydration {{with aging}} is {{attributed}} to decreased urine concentrating ability and thirst. We further investigated by comparing urine concentration and water balance in 3, 18 and 27 month old mice, consuming equal amounts of water. During water restriction, 3 month old mice concentrate their urine sufficiently to maintain water balance (stable weight). 18 month old mice concentrate their urine as well, but still lose weight (negative water balance). 27 month old mice do not concentrate their urine as well and lose even more weight than the 18 month old mice, indicating a larger negative water balance. Negative water balance in older mice is accompanied by increased vasopressin excretion, providing further evidence of dehydration. All 3 groups maintain water balance while consuming only the water in gel food containing 56 % water. However, both older groups excrete a smaller volume of urine of higher osmolality, indicating greater extra urinary water loss. Since their feces also contain less water, the excess water lost by the older mice apparently is through other routes, presumably insensible loss through the respiratory tract and skin. The greater <b>insensible</b> <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> occurs {{at an earlier age}} (18 months) than decreased urine concentrating ability (27 months).

A method for determining the rate of water diffusion through isolated human skin from various sites of the body and through the toe nails was described by Burch and Winsor (2). The constituents of skin responsible for inhibition of water transfer have largely been neglected since the work of Unna (3); the manner in which transfer of water through skin is altered by certain physical states of the environment has also received little attention. It has been proposed that inhibition to the transfer of water is localized mainly in the superficial layers of the epidermis, stratum lu cidum (4), and stratum corneum (2). The present study was undertaken to in vestigate these problems further and more particularly to observe aspects of (a) the relation of diffusion of water through dead human skin to variations in e...|$|E

40|$|The {{relationships}} between plasma colloid osmotic pressure (COPp) and interstitial fluid volume (IFV) {{as well as}} postoperative fluid balance were investigated in a prospective study involving 53 patients undergoing elective abdominal aortic reconstruction. The patients were divided into four groups according to pre- and postoperative blood replacement and fluid therapy programs whereby a continuum of postoperative COPp-values between 33 and 16 mmHg was obtained. Measurements were done before the operation and on days 1 and 4 after surgery. After surgery, COPp below 20 mmHg led to increased IFV. On day 1, COPp was linearly correlated to {{the total amount of}} fluid retained during the day of operation. A positive fluid balance of 3 L on this day ensured unchanged extracellular fluid volume (ECV). Of the 3 L, 1. 5 L was <b>insensible</b> <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> and 1. 5 L had moved into the cells. On day 4 after surgery, COPp below 22 mmHg was associated with increased plasma volume.

40|$|Graduation date: 1971 Presentation date: 1970 - 11 - 09 An {{investigation}} was undertaken {{to determine the}} role that temperature might play in limiting {{the distribution of the}} mountain beaver, Aplodontia rufa. A field study was carried on from August, 1965, through August, 1966, in the coast mountains of Benton County, Oregon, and consisted of measuring the annual temperature cycle of the burrows in conjunction with air temperatures taken at a height of six cm above the soil surface. A laboratory study was conducted {{to determine the effects of}} ambient temperature on body temperature, metabolic rate, thermal conductance, <b>insensible</b> <b>water</b> <b>loss,</b> and heart rate. The burrow system was characterized by a cool and stable microclimate. The temperature above the soil showed a maximum annual fluctuation of 40. 5 °C, the temperature within the burrows varied 18. 3 °C, with a weekly variation in burrow temperature of not more than 4 °C. Annual range in mean burrow temperature was from 2 ° to 14 °C. The mean body temperature of Aplodontia, over an ambient temperature range of from 4 ° to 290 °C was 37. 60 °C. Free-living animals had a mean body temperature of 38. 0 °C. Hyperthermia began at ambient temperatures above 29 °C and a lethal body temperature of approximately 42 °C was reached after a two hour exposure to temperatures between 32 ° and 35 °C. Aplodontia lacked a thermoneutral zone and minimal metabolic rates were recorded at high ambient temperatures when the animals were hyperthermic. Under conditions of heat stress, mean metabolicrateswere 65 percent of the values predicted by Kleiber's equation. These animals were lethargic, their respiration rates decreased to as low as 18 per minute with minimal heart rates between 60 and 100 beats per minute. The mean minimal recorded heart rates, based on body weight, were 38 percent of that predicted. Aplodontia had a minimal thermal conductance of 0. 195 cal/g/hr/°C which could only be increased by a factor of 1. 84. Winter animals had an effective insulation L. 23 times that of summer animals. This raised the lower critical temperature of summer animals by 4 °C (19 ° to 23 °C). Aplodontia required a six degree thermal gradient to dissipate its minimal heat production. <b>Insensible</b> <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> could only be increased by a factor of 2. 3 over the ambient temperature range of 12 ° to 31. 5 °C. At the latter ambient temperature, evaporative heat loss accounted for only 22 percent of Aplodontia's total heat loss. The results of this investigation indicated that high environmental temperatures may act as an important limiting factor in the distribution of the mountain beaver which lacks adequate mechanisms to avoid heat stress...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{objective}} {{was to determine the}} effects of agility exercise on dogs of different skill levels with respect to urinary eicosanoids, urinary 15 F 2 t -isoprostane (lipid peroxidation marker) and hematological/biochemical changes in plasma. Fifteen adult dogs had blood and urine samples obtained prior to, immediately and 4 -hours following an agility exercise. Results Hematocrit, red blood cells (RBC), albumin, and hemoglobin increased following exercise, with greatest increases correlating to increased skill group (novice, intermediate, masters); at 4 -hours post-exercise, hematocrit, RBC, and hemoglobin were decreased. Phosphorus increased following exercise with the greatest increase in novice and intermediates. Plasma lactate increased 3. 6 -fold in masters, 3. 2 -fold in intermediates, and 1. 2 -fold in novice dogs. Urine thromboxane B 2 (TXB 2) more than tripled 4 -hours post-exercise while 6 -keto prostaglandin F 1 α (PGF 1 α, prostacyclin metabolite), prostaglandin E 2 metabolites (13, 14 -dihydro- 15 -keto-prostaglandin A 2 and 13, 14 -dihydro- 15 -keto-prostaglandin E 2), and 13, 14 -dihydro- 15 -keto prostaglandin F 2 α were unaffected as determined by a competitive enzyme immunoassay and standardized by division with urine creatinine. Urine 15 F 2 t -isoprostane increased insignificantly. Conclusions Alterations in the plasma post-exercise were likely due to hemoconcentration from <b>insensible</b> <b>water</b> <b>loss,</b> splenic contraction and sympathetic stimulation while 4 -hours later autohemodilution reduced RBC parameters. Elevations in plasma lactate and urinary TXB 2 correlated with advanced skill level/speed of the dogs. </p...|$|E
