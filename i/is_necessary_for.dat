5|$|A 2006 {{retrospective}} study of 14,564 Medicare recipients showed that warfarin use {{for more than}} one year was linked with a 60% increased risk of osteoporosis-related fracture in men; there was no association in women. The mechanism was thought to be a combination of reduced intake of vitamin K, which <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>for</b> bone health, and inhibition by warfarin of vitamin K-mediated carboxylation of certain bone proteins, rendering them nonfunctional.|$|E
5|$|As {{described}} previously, {{the molecules}} that underlie LTP {{can be classified}} as mediators or modulators. A mediator of LTP is a molecule, such as the NMDA receptor or calcium, whose presence and activity <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>for</b> generating LTP under nearly all conditions. By contrast, a modulator is a molecule that can alter LTP but is not essential for its generation or expression.|$|E
5|$|Before {{a person}} can be {{detained}} under the ISA, the President must be satisfied that such detention <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>for</b> the purposes of national security or public order. This is a precondition for the valid exercise by the Minister for Home Affairs of the power to order the detention. The detention order is supplemented by section 74 of the ISA which empowers the police to arrest and detain any person pending enquiries without a warrant under section 8.|$|E

5|$|Boron <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>for</b> plant growth, but {{an excess}} of boron is toxic to plants, and occurs {{particularly}} in acidic soil. It presents as a yellowing from the tip inwards of the oldest leaves and black spots in barley leaves, {{but it can be}} confused with other stresses such as magnesium deficiency in other plants.|$|E
5|$|His later {{writings}} show {{no change}} in his fundamental positions. Other elements in Zwingli's theology would lead him to deny that baptism {{is a means of}} grace or that it <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>for</b> salvation. His defence of infant baptism was not only a matter of church politics, but was clearly related to the whole of his theology and his profound sense of unity of the church.|$|E
5|$|In {{fish and}} other wildlife, {{selenium}} <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>for</b> life, but toxic in high doses. For salmon, the optimal concentration of selenium is about 1 microgram selenium per gram of whole body weight. Much below that level, young salmon die from deficiency; much above, they die from toxic excess.|$|E

5|$|Migration {{in birds}} is highly labile and is {{believed}} to have developed independently in many avian lineages. While it is agreed that the behavioral and physiological adaptations necessary for migration are under genetic control, some authors have argued that no genetic change <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>for</b> migratory behavior to develop in a sedentary species because the genetic framework for migratory behavior exists in nearly all avian lineages. This explains the rapid appearance of migratory behavior after the most recent glacial maximum.|$|E
5|$|One example {{superalloy}} is Inconel 718, {{consisting of}} roughly 50% nickel, 18.6% chromium, 18.5% iron, 5% niobium, 3.1% molybdenum, 0.9% titanium, and 0.4% aluminium. These superalloys are used, for example, in advanced air frame {{systems for the}} Gemini program. Another niobium alloy {{was used for the}} nozzle of the Apollo Service Module. Because niobium is oxidized at temperatures above 400°C, a protective coating <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>for</b> these applications to prevent the alloy from becoming brittle.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scholars}} {{have indicated that}} Sholay contains homosocial themes. Ted Shen describes the male bonding shown in the film as bordering on camp style. Dina Holtzman, in her book Bollywood and Globalization: Indian Popular Cinema, Nation, and Diaspora, states that the death of Jai, and resultant break of bonding between the two male leads, <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>for</b> the sake of establishing a normative heterosexual relationship (that of Veeru and Basanti).|$|E

5|$|While Star Trek {{in general}} {{features}} few overt references to religion, {{there is a}} clear recognition that a laying aside of past hurts <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>for</b> peace, similar to the concept of shalom in Judaism. Shatner regretted that Kirk's angst at being outmoded was minimized in the final print. A scene where Spock asks Kirk if they have grown so old and inflexible they have outlived their usefulness had two meanings: it was as much Nimoy asking Shatner as it was their characters.|$|E
5|$|Zirconium {{is a good}} nuclear fuel-rod {{cladding}} metal, {{with the}} desirable properties of a very low neutron capture cross-section and good chemical stability at high temperatures. However, because of hafnium's neutron-absorbing properties, hafnium impurities in zirconium would cause it to be far less useful for nuclear-reactor applications. Thus, a nearly complete separation of zirconium and hafnium <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>for</b> their use in nuclear power. The production of hafnium-free zirconium is the main source for hafnium.|$|E

A proposed dive profile <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>for</b> effective dive planning, both for estimating the required breathing gas composition and quantities, for planning decompression, and for choosing suitable diving equipment and other logistical aspects.|$|E
