Cytogenetic abnormalities have served to define relatively homogeneous subsets of malignant <b>hemopathies</b> which are not evident from morphological and other available markers. Cytogenetic findings have been demonstrated to be powerful indicators in predicting clinical course and outcome in patients and in guiding their management. Given the significant progress made in the treatment of malignant <b>hemopathies,</b> it is very important to identify parameters which may be used to predict whether patients will respond favorably to standard therapies or if they are unlikely to do so and require alternative strategies, such as bone marrow transplantation. Cytogenetic studies have also provided important insights into the understanding of malignant transformation processes. In a number of recurring chromosome translocations characteristic of leukemias and lymphomas the genes that are located at the breakpoints have been identified. Molecular analysis has revealed that alteration in expression of these genes or in the properties of the encoded proteins resulting from the rearrangements plays an integral part in malignant transformation. Studies of clonality have suggested that several chromosome abnormalities may arise in pluripotent hemopoietic stem cells, whereas others may originate in cells of more restricted lineage. The author focuses first on the implications of the karyotype in the diagnosis and the prognosis of myeloproliferative syndromes, acute leukemias and myelodysplastic syndromes, then on the interest of describing new clinical-cytogenetic associations.

However, the occurrence of erythema nodosum in malignant <b>hemopathy</b> had rarely been reported. Case report: A 42 year-old woman presented with a four week history of recurrent multiple painful erythematous nodules developed on the lower limbs associated with arthralgia of the ankles and fever. The clinical features of skin lesions with contusiform color evolution allowed establishing the diagnosis of EN. No underlying cause was found. The skin lesions were improved with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and colchicine. Three months later, the patient consulted for recurrence of EN associated with fever, inflammatory polyarthralgia and hepatosplenomegaly. The peripheral blood count revealed pancytopenia. A bone marrow examination confirmed the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia type 2. Initiation of chemotherapy was followed by the complete disappearance of skin lesions of EN.

40|$|Normal adult hemopoiesis orginates in {{pluripotent}} stem cells; {{among the}} early differentiated descendents of such cells are progenitors {{committed to the}} erythropoietic, granulopoietic, or megakaryocytic pathways of myeloid differentiation.

Certain diseases of hemopoiesis also originate in pluripotent stem cells; these include chronic myeloblastic leukemia, acute myeloblastic leukemia, polycythemia vera, and idiopathic myelofibrosis—the clonal <b>hemopathies.</b> The hypothesis is advanced that the distribution of cell classes among patients with clonal <b>hemopathies</b> is determined both by the differentiation potential of each pluripotent stem cell maintaining an abnormal clone and by random events occurring during clonal expansion.

40|$|The haematopoietic {{stem cell}} (HSC) has been first {{described}} in the mouse and now identify in human as well. Exposed to a cocktail of growth factor, this HSC can self re-new and/or differentiate into the three lineages {{we have in the}} peripheral blood. These HSC are of major importance in the clinics since they can be used for some marrow (or stem cell) transplantation, and lead to the cure of a number of malignant and non malignant <b>hemopathies.</b> We have today three sources of HSC: the bone marrow, the mobilized peripheral blood stem cell and the cord blood. Bone marrow used to be the classical source of HSC after harvesting by aspirations in the iliac crest. However, this approach is now supplanted by the recovery of HSC in peripheral blood using a cell separation after four days of G-CSF administration. These are several advantages of this technique, but the most important one is the more rapid hematopoietic recovery after transplantation, reducing the risk of infection and transfusion. A recent source of HSC is the umbilical cord blood. At the moment of delivery, the cord blood is extremely enriched in HSC due to the migration of these cells from the liver to the bone marrow stroma, where they will persist after birth. We have learned that the marrow stroma display {{a major role in the}} regulation of hematopoiesis and the pathogenesis of several malignant <b>hemopathies</b> can be explained by disturbance in the function of stromal cell. We have particularly studied the patho-genesis of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.

40|$|International audienceThrombopoietin (TPO) via {{signaling}} {{through its}} cognate receptor MPL {{is a key}} cytokine involved in the regulation of megakaryocyte differentiation leading to platelet production. Mature megakaryocytes are polyploid cells that have arrested DNA replication and cellular proliferation but continue sustained protein synthesis.

Some recommendations are provided for the major subtypes of lymphomas including the antitumoral treatment and primarily the optimal supportive care. Recent findings All the recent literature data converge {{to say that the}} approach of an older patient with a malignant <b>hemopathy</b> is a multistep procedure. This process comprises the appraisal of life expectancy of the patient with or without the disease, the prognostic factors of the tumor, the functional, physiological and cognitive functions evaluation, the socio-economical environment and the patient's expectancy in terms of quality of life. Major progresses have been achieved in the management of diffuse large B cell lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma in patients up to 80 and above 80 years old. Summary With all these information in hands, the hematologist will decide if the treatment's objective is the standard treatment with optimal supportive care (fit patients), tailor-made adapted chemotherapy (unfit patients) or preservation of quality of life (frail patients).

Methods: We comprehensively reviewed the cases of invasive Trichosporon infection reported in the literature from 1994 (date of taxonomic modification) to 2015. Data from antifungal susceptibility testing (AST) studies were also analyzed. Results: Two hundred and three cases were retained and split into four groups: <b>hemopathy</b> (n= 79), other immunodeficiency conditions (n = 41), miscellaneous (n= 58) and newborns (n= 25). Trichosporon asahii was the main causative species (46. 7 %) and may exhibit cross-resistance to different antifungal classes. The unfavorable outcome rate was at 44. 3 %. By multivariate analysis, breakthrough infection (OR 2. 45) was associated with unfavorable outcome, whilst the use of an azole-based therapy improved the prognosis (OR 0. 16). Voriconazole-based treatment was associated with favorable outcome in hematological patients (73. 6 % vs. 41. 8 %; p= 0. 016).

Five deaths were from neoplasia (acute erythroleukemia, brain tumor, cancer of lung, paranasal cavity, esophagus).

Out of the 31 controls, 12 had died from 4 to 23 years after the CA study. Three deaths were from neoplasia (two lung cancer, one brain tumor). Even if this is a small sample, the results suggest a higher risk of cancer for the benzene-exposed cohort, who had persistently high CA rates in lymphocytes.

40|$|Complex {{chromosomal}} rearrangements in malignant <b>hemopathies</b> frequently remain unclarified {{because of}} paucity of material for further fluorescence {{in situ hybridization}} analyses and/or lack of suitable probes. Chromosome microdissection (MD) can be an adequate approach to elucidate chromosome aberrations unrecognizable by conventional karyotyping. We applied MD in two patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and unidentified chromosome changes at karyotype. Microdissection of a ring chromosome in an AML-M 5 case revealed 21 q polysomy. In an AML-M 4 case, MD of an add(15 p) disclosed a t(8; 15) with over-representation of both 8 q 22 and 8 q 24 bands. YAC probes were helpful in showing duplication of the ETO gene at 8 q 22, and amplification of C-MYC, at 8 q 24. status: publishe...|$|R

In 29 % of 950 consec-utive patients’sera, SP 1 concentrationsexceeded 1 p. g/L-in sarcoma (six of six), in malignanthemopathies(101 / 127, 80 %) suchas myeloma(20 / 26, 92 %) and acute myeloblastic leukemia(23 / 27, 90 %), and in variousother typesof cancer (11 / 19, 58 %) except for bronchialepithelioma,whichdid not lead to any significantincrease of SP 1 in the five patients examined. The concentrationof SP 1 was also frequently increasedin patientswith Crohn’sileitis(28 / 43, 65 %) butnot in patientswith other inflammatorydisorders. Additional Keyphrases: cancer “marker ” of malignancy malignant <b>hemopathies.</b> radloimmunoassay compared Among placental proteins, pregnancy-specific-g 1 yco-protein (SP 1), 2 {{a product of the}} syncytiotrophoblast (1 - 3), is considered as a marker of malignancy, not only of the trophoblast such as hydatidiform moles and chorioepithe-lioma (4, 5) but also of many other tissues. Increased serum SP 1 has been found in nonseminomatous germ cell tumors of the testis (6, 7), in multiple myeloma, and in carcinoma of the uterine cervix (8), breast, bronchus, and ovary (9). Adapting a new technique called Particle Counting Im-munoAssay (PAcIA) (10) to measurement of SP 1, we ob-served that this protein increased particularly frequently in malignant <b>hemopathies</b> and, surprisingly, in Crohn’s ileitis, but not in chronic inflammatory disorders such as rheuma-toid diseases. Here we briefly describe the technical aspects of the assay of SP 1 by PACIAand discuss the results obtained in a retrospective study of about 1000 sera consecutively received in our laboratory for analysis of serum proteins...|$|R
40|$|For severe aplastic anemia {{and several}} {{malignant}} <b>hemopathies</b> allogeneic {{bone marrow transplantation}} is the only treatment with curative potential. This {{is the case for}} chronic myelogenous leukemia, the myelodysplastic syndromes and probably multiple myeloma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. It seems also the best therapeutic option for young adults who suffer from acute leukemia and for whom an adequate family donor is available. We review here the main complications of the procedure. Their better knowledge and the way to prevent and to treat them has decreased the mortality and morbidity of this treatment which is mostly successful when applied on patients in the early phase of their disease. Recently, the availability of HLA typed registered volunteers has extended the applicability of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for those patients who lack adequate familial donors.
