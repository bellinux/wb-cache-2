5000|$|Dear Sir, In your esteemed {{journal of}} 1 August, page 207, {{you write that}} the KAISER FRIEDRICH has been {{withdrawn}} by the Norddeutscher Lloyd from service {{and returned to her}} builders. This not being the fact, I request you kindly to rectify it, in the next issue of your esteemed journal, according to the following data: - The KAISER FRIEDRICH was the property of the firm of F. Schichau, and in spite of her built as a high speed passenger steamer, requiring a good quality of coal, the Norddeutscher Lloyd mostly gave her a very <b>inferior</b> <b>coal</b> - besides, many of the stokers had no previous experience. Under these circumstances it could not give surprise that the KAISER FRIEDRICH was not able to develop her full speed, and {{there was no other way}} for the firm of F. Schichau but to withdraw its steamer and give her into other hands. The KAISER FRIEDRICH will make her next voyages under the flag of the Hamburg America Line. Reiterating to you in advance my best thanks for this rectification,I remain, dear Sir,Yours very respectfully F. Schichau ...|$|E

40|$|Within stamp-charged coke {{making a}} {{large volume of}} coal is {{compacted}} to one single coal cake before entering the coke oven chamber. This is done by means of several falling stampers in a stamping machine having a mould nearly of the oven’s dimensions. Producing a high quality coke also from <b>inferior</b> <b>coals</b> requires a cake density of approximately 80 % of the coal density. Besides that the industrial stamp-charging process demands a minimum mechanical strength of the coal cake to move it from the stamping mould into the oven chamber without failure. Densification and the build up of cake strength were investigated earlier in stamping tests using a micro-stamping device [1 - 2]. The quantities derived from these tests (as e. g. cake density or porosity) represent average values for the entire cake. Statements describing the local compaction state at different heights are difficult to achieve without destructing the cake. In order to gain better insight into the densification process and the inner structure of the coal cake a computational model based on the discrete element method, DEM, {{has been set up}} using 2 and 3 -dimensional simulation software. The stamper’s position and velocity as well as the force acting on the stamper were monitored and the model’s response was compared against measurement data from laboratory stamping tests. It was possible to reproduce the force and displacement pattern of the stamper in response to the visco-elastic properties of the cake using standard DEM bonding and contact models. Furthermore, the rearrangement of particles in response to the compaction by the stamper was tracked by calculating their displacement at the point the stamper hit the coal surface. The latter can also be used as indicators of particle deformation or breakage. By defining control points at different heights the particle displacement, stress and strain rates, porosity could be studied at different heights. Godkänd; 2012; 20121214 (andbra...|$|R

2500|$|India has the world's 4th largest coal reserves. In India, coal is {{the bulk}} of primary energy {{contributor}} with [...] 56.90% share equivalent to 411.9 Mtoe in 2016. India is the third top coal producer in 2013 with 7.6% production share of coal (including lignite) in the world. Top five hard and brown coal producing countries in 2013 (2012) are (million tons): China 3,680 (3,645), United States 893 (922), India 605 (607), Australia 478 (453) and Indonesia 421 (386). However, India ranks fifth in global coal production at 228 mtoe (5.9%) in 2013 when its <b>inferior</b> quality <b>coal</b> tonnage is converted into tons of oil equivalent. Coal-fired power plants account for 59% of India's installed electricity capacity. After electricity production, coal is also used for cement production in substantial quantity. In 2013, India imported nearly 95 Mtoe of steam coal and coking coal which is 29% of total consumption {{to meet the demand}} in electricity, cement and steel production. Pet coke availability, at cheaper price to local coal, is replacing coal in cement plants.|$|R

40|$|Due to {{increasing}} price and economic pressures, {{there is a}} need to minimise coke consumption. The lesser amount of coke used has indirectly set higher standards for coke quality and led to a wish for even more knowledge about its function in the blast furnace. Over the last 20 years, coke quality has been strongly dictated by the so- called CSR value because it was believed that a higher CSR leads to improvement in productivity and more stable operation. Due to lack of suitable coals, often cokes are made from <b>coals</b> with relatively <b>inferior</b> <b>coals</b> leading to coke with lower values of the so-called CRI indicia. Because of this, there was an indirect focus on cokes with lower CRI values. Therefore, this thesis will address some of the important issues of coke strength and focus on changes occurring with coke when it passes through a blast furnace. The main aim of this study is to understand the degradation mechanisms and reactivity changes of coke in order to investigate the factors that affect coke quality. Cokes excavated from LKAB's Experimental Blast Furnace (EBF) are used as a basis for the research. Two campaigns with similar coke (low CRI/high CSR) but different blast furnace injection material have been studied. The coke is supplied from SSAB Tunnplåt Luleå AB. Physical and chemical properties of cokes samples from the EBF were measured. Evolution of coke properties particularly carbon structure and alkali uptake were related to CO 2 reactivity as well as coke behaviour (e. g. CSR/abrasion). In addition to this, a trial with very high CRI coke was studied. On the basis of this study, following conclusions were made. The order of carbon structure and concentration of alkali species were increased and these were the most notable changes in the coke properties as it passed through shaft to the cohesive zone of the EBF. The degree of graphitisation was increased while amorphous carbon content was decreased in the hotter zones of the EBF. A linear correlation between the height of the carbon crystallite (Lc) values and the coke bed temperature was established to demonstrate the strong effect of temperature on the carbon crystallite value (Lc) of coke in the EBF. The alkali concentration of coke increased with increasing temperature of the coke bed such that most of the alkali content was evenly distributed in the bulk of the coke rather than in the periphery of the coke matrix. The CO 2 reactivity of coke was found to increase during progressive movement of the coke from shaft to cohesive zone of the EBF, and was related to the catalytic effect of increased alkali concentration in coke. The deterioration of coke quality in the EBF, particularly coke strength (CSR) and abrasion propensity (I drum test), was related to coke graphitisation, alkalization and reactivity to demonstrate the strong effect of the coke graphitisation on the propensity of coke degradation. Differential Thermal Analysis indicated that reactions with CO 2 are enhanced as coke descends through the EBF. In addition, a trial period with poor coke quality was studied by extensive sampling. The results from this study gave the following additional conclusions: Comparison between high and poor quality coke indicate structure to be connected with alkali uptake, reaction with CO 2 and degradation. Isotropic coke carbon components are more resistant than anisotropic components when passing through the EBF. Both cokes develop a more ordered structure as they descend through the EBF.

40|$|Conventional {{system of}} {{open cast mining}} of coal in India {{involves}} drilling, blasting and crushing which causes adverse impact on environment. It creates requirement of more machineries and manpower, ultimately cost of mining coal increases. Due to presence of villages near the mines, blasting is restricted as a result huge amount of coal is blocked. Quality of coal has great concern in our country {{because most of the}} <b>coal</b> seams contain <b>inferior</b> quality of <b>coal</b> due to drift origin. Government legislation also prohibits the dispatch of coal for more than 1000 Km if coal contains more than 36 % ash. The introduction of surface miner under these conditions is capable to solve the above mentioned problems. It enables the operator of mine to ensure selective mining of coal as a result quality of coal improves. The multiplicity of thinner seams which are unworkable in conventional system of opencast mining becomes workable and the total reserve of non-renewable source of fossil fuel increases. It reduces cost of production as a result total profit of a mine increases...|$|R
