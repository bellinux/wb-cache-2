5|$|Beginning with {{statehood}} in 1859, {{the court}} had just four justices, one for each judicial district in the state.

Each justice was assigned one district, and then all justices would <b>gather</b> <b>at</b> set intervals to confer on appeals, which would occur at least once per year and were authorized to meet more frequently if needed. On appeals, the justice who presided over the lower court case would not participate in the proceedings.|$|E
