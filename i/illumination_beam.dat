50|$|In {{addition}} {{there was}} no evidence of laser interferences between the guiding laser and the irradiation laser. The guiding laser, at a wavelength of 650 nm, hits the mirror on the back of the conducting cantilever from vertical trajectory and is reflected away from the cantilever towards the position sensitive photodetector (PSPD). The <b>illumination</b> <b>beam,</b> on the other hand, travels from underneath the sample platform and is reflected into position by the reflecting mirror. The angle of the mirror plate ensures that the beam does not extend past the sample surface.|$|E
50|$|The {{conductive}} AFM tip {{was easily}} aligned over the reflected <b>illumination</b> <b>beam.</b> The laser {{spot in the}} sample {{was reported to be}} 1mm in size and can be found using the AFM recording device. A convenience of this technique is that laser alignment is only necessary for imaging in the z-direction because the photocurrents are mapped in this direction. Therefore, normal AFM/c-AFM can be implemented for analysis in the x and y directions.The instrumental module proposed by Lee et al. produced spot sizes from the illumination laser of 1 mm in thicknesses. Recent applications have altered Lee’s design in order to decrease spot size while simultaneously increasing the intensity of this laser. Recent instrumentation has replaced the angled mirror with an inverted microscope and a neutral density filter. In this device the x and y piezos, illumination laser and inverted microscopy are confined underneath the sample substrate, while the z-piezo remains above the conductive cantilever. In the applications of Ginger et al. a neutral-density filter is added to increase laser attenuation and the precision of laser alignment is enhanced by the addition of the inverted microscope.|$|E
50|$|A typical LEEM setup {{consists}} of (see figure):1. Electron gun, {{used to generate}} electrons by way of thermionic or field emission from a source tip. In thermionic emission, electrons escape a source tip (usually made of LaB6) by resistive heating and application of an electric field to effectively lower the energy needed for electrons to escape the surface. Once sufficient thermal vibrational energy is attained electrons may overcome this electrostatic energy barrier, allowing them to travel into vacuum and accelerate down the lens column to the gun potential (because the lenses are at ground). In field emission, rather than heating the tip to vibrationally excite electrons from the surface, the source tip (usually tungsten) is sharpened to a small point such that when large electric fields are applied, they concentrate at the tip, lowering the barrier to escape the surface as well as making tunneling of electrons from the tip to vacuum level more feasible. 2. Condenser/illumination optics, used to focus electrons leaving the electron gun and manipulate and/or translate the illumination electron beam. Electromagnetic quadrupole electron lenses are used, the number of which {{depends on how much}} resolution and focusing flexibility the designer wishes. However, the ultimate resolution of LEEM is usually determined by that of the objective lens.3. <b>Illumination</b> <b>beam</b> aperture allows researchers to control the area of the specimen which is illuminated (LEEM’s version of electron microscopy’s “selected area diffraction”, termed microdiffraction) and is located in the beam separator on the illumination side.4. Magnetic beam separator, needed to resolve the illuminating and imaging beam (while in turn spatially separating the optics for each). There has been much development on the technology of electron beam separators; the early separators introduced distortion in either the image or diffraction plane. However, IBM recently developed a hybrid prism array/nested quadratic field design, focusing the electron beams {{both in and out of}} the plane of the beampath, allowing for deflection and transfer of the image and diffraction planes without distortion or energy dispersion.5. Electrostatic immersion objective lens, used to form a real image of the sample by way of a 2/3-magnification virtual image behind the sample. The uniformity of the electrostatic field between the objective lens and specimen, limited by spherical and chromatic aberrations larger than those of any other lenses, ultimately determines the overall performance of the instrument.6. Contrast aperture, located in the center on the projector lens side of the beam separator. In most electron microscopies, the contrast aperture is introduced into the back focal plan of the objective lens (where the actual diffraction plane lies). However, this is not true in the LEEM, because dark-field imaging (imaging of nonspecular beams) would not be possible because the aperture has to move laterally and would intercept the incident beam for large shifts. Therefore, researchers adjust the excitation of the objective lens so as to produce an image of the diffraction pattern in the middle of the beam separator and choose the desired spot intensity to image using a contrast aperture inserted there. This aperture allows scientists to image diffraction intensities that may be of particular interest (dark field).7. Illumination optics are employed to magnify the image or diffraction pattern and project it onto the imaging plate or screen.8. Imaging plate or screen, used to image the electron intensity so that we can see it. This can be done many different ways including, phosphorescent screens, imaging plates, CCDs, among others.|$|E

This has the potential to adaptively reconfigure the light sheet geometry to improve the optical sectioning of specific biological features, rather than the thicker sectioning of several features at once across a larger observation field-of-view.

In each case our solution concerns the assessment and improvement of optical imaging quality. The three instruments are as follows: The {{first is a}} portable transmission microscope which is able to correct for artificially induced aberrations using adaptive optics (AO). The specimens and the method of introducing aberrations into the optical system can be altered to simulate the performance of AO-correction in both astronomical and biological imaging. We present the design and construction of the system alongside before-and-after AO-correction images for simulated astronomical and biological images.

The focal region of the beam was made as small as possible and then matched to the shape of curved features within a biological specimen by using a spatial light modulator (SLM) to alter the light sheet focal length throughout the vertical span of the sheet.
