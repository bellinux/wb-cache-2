50|$|A <b>drilling</b> <b>jumbo</b> {{consists}} of one, {{two or three}} rock drill carriages, sometimes a platform, which the miner stands on to load the holes with explosives, clear {{the face of the}} tunnel or else. The carriages are bolted onto the chassis, which supports also the miners cabin and of course the engine. Modern drilling jumbos are relatively large, there are however smaller ones for use in cramped conditions. Whereas modern jumbos usually fitted with rubber tyres and diesel powered, there are also exist variants with steel wheels, to ride on rails and even single carriaged sled-mounted ones. Electric power is also common, historical jumbos were powered by compressed air. Electricity and compressed air produce of course no exhaust gases, which is preferable if work is done in smaller tunnels where good ventilation is difficult.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the physical/mechanical characteristics of typical selected mining tasks and the energy expenditure required for their performance. The study comprised two phases designed to monitor and record the typical activities that miners perform and to measure the metabolic energy expenditure and thermal responses during the performance of these activities under a non-heat stress environmental condition (ambient air temperature of 25. 8 °C and 61 % relative humidity with a wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) of 22. 0 °C). Six common mining jobs were evaluated in 36 miners: (1) production <b>drilling</b> (<b>jumbo</b> drill) (n = 3), (2) production ore transportation (load-haul dump vehicle) (n = 4), (3) manual bolting (n = 9), (4) manual shotcrete (wet/dry) (n = 3), (5) general services (n = 8) and, (6) conventional mining (long-hole drill) (n = 9). The time/motion analysis involved the on-site monitoring, video recording, and mechanical characterization of the different jobs. During the second trial, continuous measurement of oxygen consumption was performed with a portable metabolic system. Core (ingestible capsule) and skin temperatures (dermal patches) were recorded continuously using a wireless integrated physiological monitoring system. We found that general services and manual bolting demonstrated the highest mean energy expenditure (331 ± 98 and 290 ± 95 W, respectively) as well as the highest peak work rates (513 and 529 W, respectively). In contrast, the lowest mean rate of energy expenditure was measured in conventional mining (221 ± 44 W) and manual shotcrete (187 ± 77 W) with a corresponding peak rate of 295 and 276 W, respectively. The low rate of energy expenditure recorded for manual shotcrete was paralleled by the lowest work to rest ratio (1. 8 : 1). While we found that production drilling had a moderate rate of energy expenditure (271 ± 11 W), it was associated with the highest work to rest ratio (6. 7 : 1) Despite the large inter-variability in energy expenditure and work intervals among jobs, only small differences in average core temperature (average ranged between 37. 20 ± 0. 22 to 37. 42 ± 0. 18 °C) were measured. We found a high level of variability in the duration and intensity of tasks performed within each mining job.

40|$|The {{drill and}} blast {{excavation}} method {{is the most}} commonly used method for tunnel construction in Norway. In D&B the results from blasting can be evaluated through several factors, such as pull percentage, vibration level and contour quality. The main goal of the thesis was to analyze excavation with a special focus {{on the quality of the}} achieved contour and the influence of the applied initiation system. The analysis was performed based on results from the Bjørnegård tunnel, which was a part of the E 16 Sandvika-Wøyen, Norwegian infrastructural project. Tunnel excavation analysis was done by an estimation of the drilling accuracy and measurement results from scanning. Data for the thesis was collected from one tunnel tube from twelve rounds in total: seven of which used standard non-electric detonators and five used electronic detonators. The assumption was that the use of the electronic detonators as an initiation system has the potential for better contour quality. Special accuracy of the drilling was required for the test. The analysis was divided into two parts. The first part was focused on the analysis of drilling accuracy. For the evaluation of the results, MWD data from the <b>drilling</b> <b>jumbo</b> was used. Local coordinates from the drilling rig were used for the estimation of the spacing and length of the drilling holes, while global coordinates were used for the start and end position of the holes in comparison to the theoretical contour. The second part focused on the analysis of the results from the tunnel scanning, which provided information about theoretical and actual contour length, theoretical and overblast area and distances from the theoretical to the actually blasted contour. Scanning analysis was based on an evaluation of the ratio of actual contour length to planned contour length (RCL), ratio of actual blasted to planned area(RBA), overbreak and Tunnel Contour Quality Index (TCI). Analysis of the drilling results showed no significant difference between the accuracy of the drilling in the non-electric rounds compared to the test rounds. Estimation of the spacing and length of the contour holes presented a difference of 1 % and 3 % respectively. Results of the calculation of the starting position of the holes indicated a decrease of the accuracy of the placement of the hole in accordance to the theoretical profile. The special requirement of a maximum 10 cm distance from the theoretical contour of the starting position of the holes was fulfilled for 13 % of the holes drilled in the test rounds. Evaluation of the scanning results showed that results from non-electric and electronic detonators rounds were similar, and no improvement of the tunnel quality was calculated. Tunnel Contour Quality Index (TCI) for both data sets was similar and estimated as average...|$|E
40|$|The {{drill and}} blast (D&B) method is {{applied in the}} {{excavation}} {{of a wide range}} of underground spaces, such as tunnels, rock caverns and mines. It has been progressing rapidly to reduce construction time and cost with the introduction of more effective and accurate hydraulic and computerized drilling jumbos, higher capacity of loading and transport equipment, and more advanced explosives and detonating systems. Especially, the development of technology in the <b>drilling</b> <b>jumbo</b> and measuring equipment made it possible for tunneling engineers to perform more sophisticated and comfortable operations by the feedback from recorded data. The result from blasting in a drill and blast tunnel is generally evaluated through pull percentage (the ratio of actual pull length to drilled length per round), the level of induced vibration and noise, and quality of the excavated contour. Among these, the quality of the contour, which means the condition of the tunnel perimeter, may be characterized by overbreak/underbreak and contour roughness. Many researchers have been performing various experiments and studies to optimize contour quality since it is directly related to construction time and cost as well as management costs in unlined water tunnels. In addition to studies on the mechanisms which determine contour quality, another important subject with regards to contour quality is to establish ways to be able to quantify and characterize it for more detailed analyses. However, there has not been any concept developed for this purpose, although some indices to evaluate the result of a tunnel blasting or ways to reduce overbreak have been proposed. Hence, this thesis presents an index, TCI (Tunnel Contour Quality Index) to evaluate the contour quality of traffic tunnels or underground spaces. TCI is defined as a fraction form consisting of one constant for range adjustment, three elements and three weights for the elements. Each element consists of one correction factor and one parameter: either total overbreak, the ratio of contour length (RCL) or longitudinal overbreak variation for considering increased cross sectional area, increased contour length and the variation of the increased area in the longitudinal direction respectively. RCL can be estimated by total overbreak and deviation difference (average difference of deviation between two neighboring measured points in a tunnel section). TCI is classified into TCIT for the evaluation of an entire tunnel or more than five blasting rounds, and TCIR for the evaluation of only one or each blasting round. In addition, the index for head loss used for a water tunnel, where the increase in cross sectional area results in the decrease of head loss, is also suggested. The effects of drilling and rock mass on contour quality were analyzed, with the help of drilling information produced automatically from computerized drilling jumbos and software, on the basis of field investigations. The result shows that when total overbreak is classified, according to the causes, into the overbreak by starting position of the contour hole, the overbreak by look-out and the overbreak by other factors, the three causes account for approximately 40 % : 50 % : 10 % of total overbreak respectively, for the Q-value range between 1 and 100. Overbreak by other factors, deviation difference and longitudinal overbreak variation generally decrease with higher Q-value or RBS (Relative Block Size, RQD / Jn, Jn : rating for the number of joint sets), although the correlation between them is quite low. And the smallest overbreak by other factors and deviation difference were found when the joint orientation was between 30 ° and 0 °, and between 60 ° and 90 ° respectively, to the left of the tunnel excavation direction. Estimation models for total overbreak and deviation difference are suggested on the basis of rock mass quality (Q-value or RBS) and drilling conditions that are given from drilling logs. In the end, TCI can be estimated with the models prior to blasting. The estimation models for shotcrete and muckpile volume are suggested using the models as well. To check the effect of TCI on construction time, the existing simulation tool based on the NTNU (Norwegian University of Science and Technology) construction time estimation models has been upgraded so that it is able to estimate the construction time including rock support, in an Excel spreadsheet. Construction time and advance rate were analyzed with the variation of Q-value for seven sizes of a road tunnel, using the software. It is found that the decrease of TCIR by 10 units results in an increase of 5. 2 % in cycle time. The study may be divided into three parts in general, for which different approaches have been applied; The first part describes the definition of TCI, and has been performed on the basis of a literature study, schematic analysis, site investigations and assumptions. The second part focuses on the analysis of major factors affecting TCI, as well as the estimation models for TCI, shotcrete volume and muckpile volume. The analysis was made based on site investigations and a statistical approach. The third part describes the effects of TCI on construction time, based upon the definition of TCI as well as upgraded construction time estimation models. Lastly, to make TCI into a more effective index for the evaluation of contour quality, analyses on TCI distribution according to various types of tunnels are necessary. Based on the distribution, a guideline or specification as well as the weights of TCI having scientific grounds need to be provided for the better management of tunnel contour quality.

40|$|AbstractMOIL is {{producing}} annually around 1. 13 million tones of manganese ore. It operates 7 underground and 3 opencast mines {{in the state}} of Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. The underground mines are operated at shallow to moderate depths. Asia's largest and oldest underground manganese mine is being operated by MOIL at Balaghat, Madhya Pradesh. Horizontal cut and fill mining with passive timber square set support has been replaced with advanced technique of pre-mining support by Cable bolting for reinforcement underground structures. The change in technology has enabled to transform the manual post filling of rock to hydraulic sand stowing operation in all the underground mines of the MOIL. With the available underground stopes, the panel working has been started with phased mechanization.

Conventional mining methods will be used for the shaft sinking phase of the ES project. The ES will be comprised of surface support facilities, a 1480 -ft-deep circular shaft lined with concrete to a finished inside diameter of 12 ft, lateral excavations and test installations extending up to 200 ft from the shaft, and long lateral borings extending up to 2300 ft from the shaft. The estimated time for sinking the shaft to a total depth of about 1480 ft and completing the lateral excavations and borings is about two years. The major underground development planned for the primary test level at a depth of 1200 ft consists of the equivalent of 1150 ft of 15 - by 15 -ft drift.

40|$|Development {{drilling}} {{is used in}} {{underground mining}} to create access tunnels. A common method involves using a drilling rig, known as a <b>jumbo,</b> to <b>drill</b> holes {{into the face of}} a tunnel. <b>Jumbo</b> <b>drill</b> rigs have two or more articulated arms with drills as end-effectors, that extend outwards from a vehicle. Once drilled, the holes are charged with explosives and fired to advance the tunnel. There is an ongoing imperative within the mining industry to reduce development times and reducing time spent drilling is seen as the best opportunity for achieving this. Notwithstanding that three-boom jumbos have been available for some years, the industry has maintained a preference for using jumbo rigs with two drilling booms. Three-boom machines have the potential to reduce drilling time by as much as one third, but they have proven difficult to operate and, in practice, this benefit has not been realized. The key difficulty lies in manoeuvering the booms within the tight confines of the tunnel and ensuring sequencing the drilling of holes so that each boom spends maximum time drilling. This thesis addresses the problem of optimally sequencing multi-boom <b>jumbo</b> <b>drill</b> rigs to minimize the overall time to drill a blast hole pattern, taking into account the various constraints on the problem including the geometric constraints restricting motion of the booms. The specific aims of the thesis are to: ² develop the algorithmic machinery needed to determine minimum- or near-minimum-time drill assignment for multi-boom jumbos which is suitable for "real-time" implementation; ² use this drill pattern assignment algorithm to quantify the benefits of optimal drill pattern assignment with three-boom jumbos; and ² investigate the management of unplanned events, such as boom breakdowns, and assess the potential of the algorithm to assist a human operator with the forward planning of drill-hole selection. <b>Jumbo</b> <b>drill</b> task assignment is a combinatorial optimization problem. A methodology based around receding horizon mixed integer programming is developed to solve the problem. At any time the set of drill-holes available to a boom is restricted by the location of the other booms as well as the tunnel perimeter. Importantly these constraints change as the problem evolves. The methodology builds these constraints into problem through use of a feasibility tensor that encodes the moves available to each boom given configurations of other booms. The feasibility tensor is constructed off-line using a rapidly exploring random tree algorithm. Simulations conducted using the sequencing algorithm predict, for a standard drill-hole pattern, a 10 - 22 % reduction in drilling time with the three-boom rig relative to two-boom machines. The algorithms developed in this thesis have two intended applications. The first is for automated <b>jumbo</b> <b>drill</b> rigs where the capability to plan drilling sequences algorithmically is a prerequisite. Automated drill rigs are still some years from being a reality. The second, and more immediate application is in providing decision support for drill rig operators. It is envisaged that the algorithms described here might form the basis of a operator assist that provides guidance on which holes to drill next with each boom, adapting this plan as circumstances change...|$|R

Exposure to FTV can lead to vibration white feet/toes resulting in blanching of the toes, and tingling and numbness in the feet and toes. OBJECTIVESThe objectives are 1) to review {{the current state of}} knowledge of the health risks associated with foot-transmitted vibration (FTV), and 2) to identify the characteristics of FTV and discuss the associated risk of vibration-induced injury. PARTICIPANTSWorkers who operated locomotives (n = 3), bolting platforms (n = 10), <b>jumbo</b> <b>drills</b> (n = 7), raise drilling platforms (n = 4), and crushers (n = 3), participated. METHODSA tri-axial accelerometer was used to measure FTV in accordance with ISO 2631 - 1 guidelines. Frequency-weighted root-mean-square acceleration and the dominant frequency are reported. Participants were also asked to report pain/ache/discomfort in the hands and/or feet. RESULTSReports of pain/discomfort/ache were highest in raise platform workers and <b>jumbo</b> <b>drill</b> operators who were exposed to FTV in the 40 Hz and 28 Hz range respectively. Reports of discomfort/ache/pain were lowest in the locomotive and crusher operators who were exposed to FTV below 10 Hz. These findings are consistent with animal studies that have shown vascular and neural damage in exposed appendages occurs at frequencies above 40 Hz. CONCLUSIONSOperators exposed to FTV at 40 Hz appear to be at greater risk of experiencing vibration induced injury.

40|$|Research shows miners can {{be exposed}} to foot-transmitted {{vibration}} (FTV) when operating various pieces of underground mining equipment, and case reports suggest workers are experiencing symptoms {{similar to those of}} hand-arm vibration syndrome in their feet. A field study was conducted to measure and document FTV exposure associated with operating underground mining equipment, and probable health risks were determined based on both ISO 2631 - 1 (1997) for WBV and ISO 5349 - 1 (2004) for HAV. Seventeen participating operator’s also reported musculoskeletal discomfort. Seventeen male participants ranging between 24 - 61 years of age, with an average height and mass of 175. 0 cm and 88. 2 kg volunteered for the study. Seventeen pieces of equipment were tested; 1 locomotive, 1 crusher, 9 bolter drills (4 scissor platforms, 2 Maclean, 2 Boart/basket, and 1 RDH), and 6 <b>jumbo</b> <b>drills.</b> Including all seventeen pieces of underground mining equipment, the vibration acceleration ranged from 0. 13 - 1. 35 m/s 2 with dominant frequencies between 1. 25 - 250 Hz according to ISO 2631 - 1. According to ISO 5349 - 1 vibration acceleration ranged from 0. 14 - 3. 61 m/s 2 with dominant frequencies between 6. 3 - 250 Hz. Furthermore, the magnitude of FTV measured on the <b>jumbo</b> <b>drills</b> with grated platforms (# 5 and # 6) was less than FTV measured from the <b>jumbo</b> <b>drills</b> with, solid metal surfaces. Additionally, twelve of the seventeen equipment operators indicated a complaint of discomfort in their lower body (specifically {{at the level of the}} knee or lower). The health risk analysis based on ISO 2631 - 1 indicated that one operator (bolter drill # 9) was exposed to vibration above the criterion value, while the health risk analysis based on ISO 5349 - 1 indicated iv that two operators (<b>jumbo</b> <b>drill</b> # 1 and bolter drill # 1) were exposed to vibration above the criterion value. Operators reported very severe or severe discomfort; however, the same operators were not the operators of the equipment with FTV exposure levels above the ISO standards, leaving evidence to suggest that the standards are not properly assessing injury risk to vibration exposure via the feet. Future research is needed to develop a standard specific for FTV and to determine the link between early musculoskeletal injury reporting and the onset of vibration white foot. To do so, a better understanding of the biodynamic response of the foot to FTV is needed. A laboratory study was conducted to 1) measure and document transmissibility of FTV from (a) floor-to-ankle (lateral malleolus), and (b) floor-to-metatarsal, during exposure to six levels of vibration (25 Hz, 30 Hz, 35 Hz, 40 Hz, 45 Hz, and 50 Hz) while standing, and 2) to determine whether independent variables (vibration exposure frequency, mass, arch type) influence transmissibility (dependent variable) through the foot. A two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted. There was a significant interaction between transmissibility location and exposure frequency (λ = 0. 246, F (5, 25) = 15. 365, p = 0. 0001). There were significant differences in mean transmissibility between the ankle and metatarsal at 40 Hz [t(29) = 4. 116, p = 0. 00029], 45 Hz [t(29) = 6. 599, p = 0. 00000031], and 50 Hz [t(29) = 8. 828, p = 0. 000000001]. The greatest transmissibility at the metatarsal occurred at 50 Hz and at the ankle (lateral malleolus) transmissibility was highest from 25 - 30 Hz, indicating the formation of a local resonance at each location. v Future research should focus on identifying resonance frequencies at different locations on the feet. This information is needed to develop an exposure guideline to help protect workers from exposure to FTV, and to develop personal protective equipment capable of attenuating harmful FTV exposure frequencies.

40|$|Engineering noise {{controls}} are the preferred {{solution to a}} noise problem because they address noise sources directly. Administrative controls and personal protective equipment should be explored as secondary solutions. Basic noise controls include barriers and sound-absorbing materials. A barrier is a solid obstacle that is somewhat impervious to sound and that interrupts the direct path from the sound source to the receiver. For the best reduction in sound level, the barrier should be: 1. placed {{as close as possible}} to either the source or receiver; 2. assembled to be as tall and wide as practical so it extends well beyond the direct source-receiver path; and 3. constructed of a material that is solid and airtight. Sound-absorbing treatments reduce reflections and the resulting echoes and reverberation. Usually, these materials are porous. Compared to high frequency sounds, low frequency sounds are more difficult to absorb with materials and to block with barriers. Therefore, it is important to know the frequency content for a particular noise problem. The effectiveness of barriers and absorptive materials as noise controls on mining equipment was tested during field studies. Following are some of the key findings. 6. 1 Haul Trucks: The use of absorptive materials in the operator's area of tested haul trucks had very little effect on sound levels underground. Sound level reductions were on the order of 1 dB(A). Most of the sound reaches the operator via the direct path from the noise source to the operator. In addition, noise reflects from the walls to the operator station. Open cabs allow the direct and reflected sound to enter the operator station. Therefore, a large reduction in sound levels from installing sound-absorbing material at the operator station is not expected. 6. 2 Load-Haul-Dumps (LHDs) : A fully enclosed environmental cab can provide 20 dB(A) or more of noise reduction. If a fully enclosed cab is impractical, a partial cab can provide useful protection as long as the openings face away from the primary noise sources. A partial cab with three sides and a top was found to provide more than 10 dB(A) of noise reduction. Both full and partial cabs should have similar results on other underground equipment. When installing a retrofit cab, it is wise to contact the original equipment manufacturer to ensure that the integrity of the falling object protective structure (FOPS) is not compromised. 6. 3 <b>Jumbo</b> <b>Drills</b> and Bolters: When applying noise control treatments, care should be taken to use the right product for the job. The 0. 5 -inch-thick rubber conveyor belt mats used to cover the electric-motor-powered hydraulic pumps on the <b>jumbo</b> <b>drills</b> and bolters were effective at reducing noise because the heavy rubber is a barrier material, which is the correct choice for the application. Rubber is usually not the best material to use for a barrier, but in this case it was effective. On bolter 2, the electric motor and hydraulic pumps were covered with sound-absorbing material. In this instance, the treatment had almost no effect on the noise from the electric motor and hydraulic pumps because sound-absorbing material makes a poor barrier. Sound-absorbing material is most effective when it is used at a reflective surface. The cover should have been constructed using a barrier lined with sound-absorbing material to surround the electric motor and hydraulic pumps. Prior to developing noise controls for a source, the significance of this source should be considered relative to other noise sources on a machine. In this case, the sound level with the electric motor and hydraulics operating was 85 dB(A) whereas noise due to drilling and bolting is about 100 dB(A). In this case, the noise due to the electric motor and hydraulic pumps is insignificant. Windshields on <b>jumbo</b> <b>drills</b> and bolters reduced the sound level at the operator's station during the drilling/bolting cycle up to 3 dB(A). The noise generated from drilling and bolting is relatively high frequency in nature. Therefore, the windshield provides an effective barrier. Gaps between and around sections of the windshield should be sealed for the most effective noise control. In addition, wrapping a windshield around the operator station improves the noise reduction by forcing drilling/bolting noise to travel further around the windshield to get to the operator. In addition, this helps block noise reflected from the rib from reaching the operator. 6. 4 Lessons Learned: Through evaluating different noise controls on underground machinery, NIOSH researchers discovered several findings. Both the effective and ineffective treatments rendered valuable information. 1. Although it is tempting to use sound-absorbing materials for noise controls because they are inexpensive and simple to attach to existing surfaces, sound barriers were always more effective in the examples NIOSH studied for this report. 2. Windshields and environmental cabs can be highly effective noise controls, especially for high frequency noise. 3. Plugging gaps in machine panels and windshields with a material that creates an airtight seal can greatly enhance the noise reduction benefits of existing barriers. 4. Gaps in barriers compromise noise control effectiveness. 5. When openings in enclosures are necessary, a partial enclosure can provide some benefit. Enclosures should be lined with an absorptive material thick enough to absorb the dominant sound frequencies. Openings to let air in and out of the enclosure should have lined ducts with multiple bends to absorb sound and to force it to follow a circuitous pathway before exiting the enclosure. In order to reduce noise-induced hearing loss from work-related noise exposure, mine workers, union representatives, mine managers, equipment manufacturers, NIOSH, and MSHA must work in partnership to successfully construct and implement new and better noise controls. To ensure the success of a noise control program, appropriate materials must be applied and the noise sources treated must be significant in terms of the worker's daily noise exposure.
