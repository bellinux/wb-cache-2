25|$|Poppy {{seeds are}} {{sometimes}} referred to by their Yiddish name, spelled either mun or mon (written מאָן), which comes from the German word for poppy, Mohn, as used in Mohnbrötchen. American chef John Mitzewich suggests a recipe {{for what he calls}} “San Francisco-Style Bagels”. His recipe yields bagels flatter than New York-style bagels, characterized by a rough-textured crust. An everything bagel may include such toppings as poppy seeds, sesame seeds, onion flakes, caraway seeds, <b>garlic</b> <b>flakes,</b> pretzel salt, and pepper.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Mi Goreng" [...] ("stir fry") {{range of}} instant noodles by Indomie, {{based on the}} Indonesian dish Mie goreng, entered the market in 1983 and are {{distributed}} in North America, Europe, Africa, Australasia and various regions in Asia. The brand flavours are sold in varying weight packets, around 85 g, and contain two sachets of flavourings. The first sachet has three segments and carries the liquid condiments: sweet soy sauce, chilli sauce, and seasoning oil with <b>garlic</b> <b>flakes.</b> The other sachet has two segments for dry seasoning powder and flake of fried shallot. In some regions, Indomie Mi goreng is also available in jumbo (120 gram) packs.|$|E
50|$|When the Doctor and Speedwell {{find more}} bodies, they notice {{there appears to}} be two {{different}} styles of killing, some for feeding, and some were just in the way. They see a man hole, and beyond they run into the killer — the vampire Nessican who had killed Valentine. Speedwell shoots him, but to no effect as only severing the spinal column would kill a vampire. Nessican attacks the Doctor and succeeds in drinking some of his blood, but the Doctor had eaten some <b>garlic</b> <b>flakes</b> which kill the vampire. On hearing a description of a woman who fled the bar, the Doctor recognises who it is and realises she is the second killer.|$|E
50|$|Atho is {{a variant}} of Burmese noodles.It is made from thick round noodles, {{shredded}} cabbage and onion garnished with tamarind, salt, fried onions, chili <b>flakes,</b> <b>garlic</b> and Monosodium glutamate (rarely) with hot soup poured over the cooked Burma noodles. It is of Burmese origin and served by Burmese refugees working as vendors in Chennai.|$|R
50|$|Korean cuisine {{is largely}} based upon rice, vegetables, and meats. Traditional Korean meals are noted {{for the number}} of side dishes (banchan) that {{accompany}} steam-cooked short-grain rice. Kimchi is served often, sometimes at every meal. Commonly used ingredients include sesame oil, doenjang (fermented bean paste), soy sauce, salt, <b>garlic,</b> ginger, pepper <b>flakes</b> and gochujang (fermented red chili paste).|$|R
5000|$|Chimichurri (...) or chimmichurri is an {{uncooked}} sauce {{used for}} grilled meat; {{it comes in}} a green version (chimichurri verde) and a red version (chimichurri rojo) and seems to come from Argentinian cuisine. It is made of finely chopped parsley, minced garlic, vegetable oil, oregano, and white vinegar. In Uruguay, the dominant flavoring is parsley, <b>garlic,</b> red pepper <b>flakes,</b> and fresh oregano.|$|R
5000|$|An [...] "everything" [...] bagel is {{essentially}} a normal bagel, {{with the addition of}} multiple toppings to enhance the flavor. Poppy seeds, sesame seeds, onion flakes, caraway seeds, <b>garlic</b> <b>flakes,</b> pretzel salt, and pepper, are all popular toppings that most vendors use on an everything bagel. The everything bagel inspired other bread creations with similar toppings, such as everything bagel chips, everything croissants, everything rolls, everything roti, everything fusilli, and everything hot dog buns. It is offered by many bakeries and fast casual restaurants such as Au Bon Pain and Panera. Attardo notes that [...] "everything" [...] in this context is not to be interpreted as implying infinite recursion: It consists a bagel covered with every topping/flavoring used on the bagels. The scope of everything is clearly limited. Consider that if the everything label were taken literally, these bagels would be very strange indeed, since they should include every object in the universe, including those very bagels as well, ad infinitum. Here the affordance of BAGEL delimits the universal quantifier to things that people put on bagels and that go well together.Most likely the bagel is vegan. The mechanism whereby the delimitation is achieved is of some interest. BAGEL affords being cooked (first boiled and then baked), being eaten, and being covered/baked with spices/condiments. These affordances interact interestingly, because since the bagels are made to be eaten, only tasteful combinations of flavors can be accepted (a blueberry/onion bagel would not be very appetizing to the average American) and a fortiori no inedible toppings may be used, or objects that would not fit in an oven (which rules out “galaxy” bagels—a seriously “everything” bagel would need to include our galaxy, at the very least). Michael Preston, executive director of the Florida Consortium of Metropolitan Research Universities, notes that in life, the only time it is possible to have everything is on a bagel.|$|E
40|$|Studies {{were carried}} out to {{evaluate}} the effect of storage period and different packaging material {{on the quality of}} <b>garlic</b> <b>flakes</b> dried by convective-cum-microwave (CCM) and fluidized-cum-microwave (FCM) hybrid drying. <b>Garlic</b> <b>flakes</b> were packaged and stored in high density polyethylene (HDPE), low density polyethylene (LDPE) and laminated aluminium foil for 3 months under ambient conditions. Samples were investigated to observe for change in rehydration ratio, colour, physiological loss in weight...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} sous vide fish and assess the influence of time and temperature on the pasteurization process through quality parameters. The raw material (tambaqui fillets) and the sous vide underwent physical, physicochemical, and microbiological analyses. A sauce was prepared containing soy sauce, water, horseradish and <b>garlic</b> <b>flakes.</b> The product's pasteurization parameters of time and temperature were defined according to a 22 central composite rotatable design (CCRD), and the dependent variables were water holding capacity (WHC) and instrumental texture aiming at obtaining high WHC values for the product to maintain the desired juiciness. The microbiological analysis required by legislation have indicated that the fish fillets and sous vide were within de standard. The values of total coliforms found in the samples (fillets and sous vide) analyzed were below the critical level of 10 ² CFU/g. The counts of sulphite-reducing clostridia and psychrotrophic and mesophilic bacteria on plates in the samples were < 1 x 10 CFU/g. In conclusion, temperature was the most important factor in the pasteurization process, significantly contributing to the quality of the final product. The mathematical models proposed were considered predictive for each response. 201...|$|E
50|$|In Chennai, India a dish {{referred}} to as atho or athoke {{is a mixture of}} noodles, shredded cabbage and onions garnished with tamarind, salt, fried onions, chili <b>flakes,</b> <b>garlic</b> and ajinomoto (rarely). It is of Burmese origin and served by Burmese refugees working as vendors in Chennai. It may be a version of khauk swe thoke and is described as being golden and gooey.|$|R
50|$|In most Thai restaurants, diners {{will have}} access to a {{selection}} of Thai sauces (nam chim) and condiments, either brought to the table by wait staff or present at the table in small containers. These may include: phrik nam pla/nam pla phrik (fish sauce, lime juice, chopped chilies and <b>garlic),</b> dried chili <b>flakes,</b> sweet chili sauce, sliced chili peppers in rice vinegar, Sriracha sauce, and even sugar. With certain dishes, such as khao kha mu (pork trotter stewed in soy sauce and served with rice), whole Thai peppers and raw garlic are served in addition to the sour chili sauce. Cucumber is sometimes eaten to cool the mouth with particularly spicy dishes. They often feature as a garnish, especially with one-dish meals. The plain rice, sticky rice or the khanom chin (Thai rice noodles) served alongside a spicy Thai curry or stir fry, tends to counteract the spiciness.|$|R
