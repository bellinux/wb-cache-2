5|$|The {{great white}} shark {{was one of the}} many {{amphibia}} originally described by Linnaeus in the landmark 1758 10th edition of his Systema Naturae, its first scientific name, Squalus carcharias. Later, Sir Andrew Smith gave it Carcharodon as its <b>generic</b> <b>name</b> in 1833, and also in 1873. The <b>generic</b> <b>name</b> was identified with Linnaeus' specific name and the current scientific name, Carcharodon carcharias, was finalized. Carcharodon comes from the Ancient Greek words karcharos, which means sharp or jagged, and odous, which means tooth.|$|E
50|$|A generic domain is a {{name that}} defines a general category, rather than a {{specific}} or personal instance, for example, {{the name of an}} industry, rather than a company name.

5|$|In his 1821 A Natural Arrangement of British Plants, Samuel Frederick Gray {{introduced}} the <b>generic</b> <b>name</b> Micromphale, including the species Micromphale collariatum, {{which was based}} on William Withering's 1796 Merulius collariatus. In 1946 Alexander H. Smith and Rolf Singer proposed to conserve the name Marasmius over Micromphale; the latter had nomenclatorial priority as it was published first. The <b>generic</b> <b>name</b> Marasmius, with M.rotula as the lectotype species, was later conserved at the 1954 Paris Congress on Botanical Nomenclature. M.rotula is also the type species of section Marasmius within the genus. This grouping of species is characterized by inamyloid flesh, a cap cuticle with broom cells (finger-like projections common to Marasmius species) ornamented with numerous warts, gills usually attached to a collar surrounding the stem, and the presence of black rhizomorphs on the stem.|$|E

5|$|Apeomyoides savagei was {{described}} as a new genus and species by Kent Smith, Richard Cifelli, and Nicholas Czaplewski in 2006. The <b>generic</b> <b>name,</b> Apeomyoides, adds the Greek suffix -ides, indicating similarity, to the name of the related genus Apeomys, while the specific name, savagei, honors Donald E. Savage for his work on fossil mammals and for assistance to Smith. In the same paper, these scientists argued in favor of apeomyine affinities for Arikareeomys.|$|E
5|$|Hatzegopteryx {{was named}} in 2002 by French {{paleontologist}} Eric Buffetaut, and Romanian paleontologists Dan Grigorescu and Zoltan Csiki. The <b>generic</b> <b>name</b> {{is derived from}} the Hatzeg (or Hațeg) basin of Transylvania, where the bones were found, and from Greek pteryx (ἡ πτέρυξ, -υγος (also ἡ πτερύξ, -ῦγος), or 'wing'. The specific name thambema {{is derived from the}} Greek for 'terror, monster' (τό θάμβημα, -ήματος), in reference to its huge size.|$|E

5|$|In 1891, German {{botanist}} Otto Kuntze {{challenged the}} <b>generic</b> <b>name</b> Banksia L.f., {{on the grounds}} that the name Banksia had previously been published in 1775 as Banksia J.R.Forst & G.Forst, referring to the genus now known as Pimelea. Kuntze proposed Sirmuellera as an alternative, republishing B.aemula as Sirmuellera serratifolia. The challenge failed, and Banksia L.f. was formally conserved.|$|E
5|$|In 1932, British {{paleontologist}} Guy Pilgrim described {{two species}} from the Miocene {{of what is}} now India and Pakistan, Sivanasua palaeindica from Chinji (Pakistan) and Sivanasua himalayensis from Haritalyangar (India). He attributed both to Sivanasua, a carnivoran genus otherwise known from Europe. The next year, American scientist G. Edward Lewis described the new genus and species Indraloris lulli from Haritalyangar, which he provisionally allocated to the family Lorisidae. The <b>generic</b> <b>name,</b> Indraloris, combines the name of the god Indra with the <b>generic</b> <b>name</b> Loris, and the specific name, lulli, honors Richard Swann Lull, at the time director of the Peabody Museum of Natural History. It was not until 1968 that American anthropologist Ian Tattersall noted that Pilgrim's Sivanasua species had been misidentified; he suggested that Sivanasua himalayensis was probably the same as Indraloris lulli, but left the affinities of Sivanasua palaeindica open. Tattersall, who also described additional material of Indraloris, continued to regard the animal as a lorisid.|$|E
5|$|Its <b>generic</b> <b>name,</b> Cleptornis, {{is derived}} from the Ancient Greek kleptes, a robber or thief, and ornis, a bird. This is not a {{reference}} to any aspect of the golden white-eye's behaviour, but to the old French name of the Mariana Islands, les Îles des Voleurs, or Robbers' Islands. The specific epithet marchei refers to the French explorer and writer Antoine-Alfred Marche, who procured the original specimens.|$|E

In 1890, Karl Moritz Schumann created the new genus Zygocactus, transferring Epiphyllum truncatum to Zygocactus truncatus. Although he later placed it back in Epiphyllum, abandoning Zygocactus, the <b>generic</b> <b>name</b> Zygocactus continued to be widely used.|$|E
5|$|The Hyogo Unga is the <b>generic</b> <b>name</b> for {{the network}} of five canals located along the {{southern}} coast of Hyogo and Nagata Wards, facing Osaka Bay.

They were first planned in the 1870s and completed in December 1899.|$|E
5|$|The <b>generic</b> <b>name</b> is a {{combination}} of the Latin prefix semi, meaning half, and noun cassis, meaning helmet. The specific name of this taxon, granulata, is derived from the Latin noun grana meaning grain. Here it is used in the diminutive form, meaning granulated, or covered in granules, i.e. small grains or pellets, referring to the shell sculpture.|$|E

However, most knights and mounted men-at-arms rode smaller horses known as coursers and rounceys.

5|$|A major {{disruption}} to Banksia nomenclature {{occurred in}} 1891, when Otto Kuntze challenged Banksia L.f. {{on the grounds}} that Johann Reinhold Forster and his son Georg had already penned the name Banksia to describe a different genus of plant, and hence Banksia J.R.Forst & G. Forst took precedence and rendered Banksia L.f. (i.e. as used by Linnaeus) invalid. Kuntze transferred all Banksia taxa to the new name Sirmuellera; thus B.dentata became Sirmuellera dentata (L.f.) Kuntze. Kuntze's challenge failed, as did a similar challenge by James Britten in 1905. Britten proposed the <b>generic</b> <b>name</b> Isostylis, republishing B.dentata as Isostylis dentata (L.f.) Britten. In 1940 Banksia L.f. was formally conserved against future challenges.|$|E
5|$|Andreacarus voalavo {{was named}} in 2007 by Ashley Dowling, Andre Bochkov, and Barry OConnor {{on the basis}} of 15specimens found on an {{individual}} of the rodent Voalavo gymnocaudus that was collected in 1994 in the Anjanaharibe-Sud Reserve in northern Madagascar. The specific name, voalavo, is taken from the <b>generic</b> <b>name</b> of the type host. Voalavo gymnocaudus, the only known host, is only found in the Anjanaharibe-Sud and Marojejy massifs of the Malagasy Northern Highlands. A.voalavo is closely related to Andreacarus gymnuromys and Andreacarus eliurus, found on other Malagasy rodents. They are members of the genus Andreacarus, which currently includes 11 species found on rodents and other small mammals in Madagascar and mainland Africa.|$|E
