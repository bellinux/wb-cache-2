50|$|The {{case went}} before the Ontario Court (General Division) where the judge agreed with the Ministry of Labour and allowed the former {{employees}} to be paid. However, the Ontario Court of Appeal overturned the ruling and restored the Trustee's decision. The Ministry sought leave to appeal from the Court of Appeal judgment but discontinued its application. Following the <b>discontinuance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>appeal,</b> the Trustee paid a dividend to Rizzo's creditors, thereby leaving significantly less funds in the estate. Subsequently, the appellants, five former employees of Rizzo, moved to set aside the discontinuance, add themselves as parties to the proceedings, and requested and were granted an order granting them leave to appeal.|$|E
