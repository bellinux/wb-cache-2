5|$|Beer {{contains}} ethyl alcohol, {{the same}} chemical that {{is present in}} wine and distilled spirits and as such, beer consumption has short-term psychological and physiological effects on the user. Different concentrations of alcohol {{in the human body}} have different effects on a person. The effects of alcohol depend on the amount an <b>individual</b> <b>has</b> drunk, the percentage of alcohol in the beer and the timespan over which the consumption took place, the amount of food eaten and whether an <b>individual</b> <b>has</b> taken other prescription, over-the-counter or street drugs, among other factors. Drinking enough to cause a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.03%-0.12% typically causes an overall improvement in mood and possible euphoria, increased self-confidence and sociability, decreased anxiety, a flushed, red appearance in the face and impaired judgment and fine muscle coordination. A BAC of 0.09% to 0.25% causes lethargy, sedation, balance problems and blurred vision. A BAC from 0.18% to 0.30% causes profound confusion, impaired speech (e.g., slurred speech), staggering, dizziness and vomiting. A BAC from 0.25% to 0.40% causes stupor, unconsciousness, anterograde amnesia, vomiting (death may occur due to inhalation of vomit (pulmonary aspiration) while unconscious) and respiratory depression (potentially life-threatening). A BAC from 0.35% to 0.80% causes a coma (unconsciousness), life-threatening respiratory depression and possibly fatal alcohol poisoning. As with all alcoholic drinks, drinking while driving, operating an aircraft or heavy machinery increases the risk of an accident; many countries have severe criminal penalties against drunk driving.|$|E

5|$|Huntington's {{disease has}} {{autosomal}} dominant inheritance, meaning that an affected individual typically inherits one {{copy of the}} gene with an expanded trinucleotide repeat (the mutant allele) from an affected parent. Since penetrance of the mutation is very high, {{those who have a}} mutated copy of the gene will have the disease. In this type of inheritance pattern, each offspring of an affected <b>individual</b> <b>has</b> a 50% risk of inheriting the mutant allele and therefore being affected with the disorder (see figure). This probability is sex-independent.|$|E
5|$|If an {{individual}} feels Vairagya (detachment from the world), the Jabala Upanishad maintains that no preconditions apply, and the <b>individual</b> <b>has</b> the spiritual right to renounce immediately. This principle in the Jabala Upanishad was cited by medieval-era {{scholars such as}} Adi Shankara, Vijñāneśvara, Sureśvara, and Nilakantha as the Vedic basis that makes renunciation {{an individual}} choice and right. This choice {{has been referred to}} as a Vikalpa by the later scholars, which the society and state must respect. The Jabala Upanishad concurred with some Dharmasastras on the right to renounce and lead a monastic life, but its views contradicted others such as those in Manusmriti verses 6.35–37. The text fed a debate on the right of the individual, and medieval Hindu scholars relied on and sided with the Jabala Upanishad.|$|E
5|$|Some insects use parthenogenesis, {{a process}} in which the female can {{reproduce}} and give birth without having the eggs fertilized by a male. Many aphids undergo a form of parthenogenesis, called cyclical parthenogenesis, in which they alternate between one or many generations of asexual and sexual reproduction. In summer, aphids are generally female and parthenogenetic; in the autumn, males may be produced for sexual reproduction. Other insects produced by parthenogenesis are bees, wasps and ants, in which they spawn males. However, overall, most individuals are female, which are produced by fertilization. The males are haploid and the females are diploid. More rarely, some insects display hermaphroditism, in which a given <b>individual</b> <b>has</b> both male and female reproductive organs.|$|E

5|$|The {{doctrine}} of legitimate expectation originates from common law principles of fairness. English courts developed this doctrine largely to encourage good administration and prevent abuses by decision-makers. Generally, the courts will grant {{judicial review of}} an administrative decision based on an individual's legitimate expectation if a public authority has made a representation to the individual within its powers. The <b>individual</b> <b>has</b> {{to show that the}} representation was a clear and unambiguous promise, an established practice or a public announcement. This is largely a factual inquiry.|$|E
5|$|The {{strength}} of research support for each recommendation varies; {{some of the}} more robustly researched and supported recommendations include the negative effects of noisy sleep environments, alcohol consumption in the hours before sleep, engaging in mentally difficult tasks before sleep, and trying too hard to fall asleep. There is a lack of evidence for the effects of certain sleep hygiene recommendations, including getting a more comfortable mattress, removing bedroom clocks, not worrying, and limiting liquids. Other recommendations, such as the effects of napping or exercise, have a more complicated evidence base. The effects of napping, for example, seem to depend on the length and timing of napping, in conjunction with how much cumulative sleep an <b>individual</b> <b>has</b> had in recent nights.|$|E
5|$|Clinical data alone may be {{sufficient}} for {{a diagnosis of}} MS if an <b>individual</b> <b>has</b> had separate episodes of neurological symptoms characteristic of the disease. In those who seek medical attention after only one attack, other testing is needed for the diagnosis. The most commonly used diagnostic tools are neuroimaging, analysis of cerebrospinal fluid and evoked potentials. Magnetic resonance imaging {{of the brain and}} spine may show areas of demyelination (lesions or plaques). Gadolinium can be administered intravenously as a contrast agent to highlight active plaques and, by elimination, demonstrate the existence of historical lesions not associated with symptoms at the moment of the evaluation. Testing of cerebrospinal fluid obtained from a lumbar puncture can provide evidence of chronic inflammation in the central nervous system. The cerebrospinal fluid is tested for oligoclonal bands of IgG on electrophoresis, which are inflammation markers found in 75–85% of people with MS. The nervous system in MS may respond less actively to stimulation of the optic nerve and sensory nerves due to demyelination of such pathways. These brain responses can be examined using visual- and sensory-evoked potentials.|$|E

5|$|Medullary bone tissue (endosteally derived, ephemeral, {{mineralization}} located {{inside the}} medulla {{of the long}} bones in gravid female birds) {{has been reported in}} at least one Allosaurus specimen, a shin bone from the Cleveland-Lloyd Quarry. Today, this bone tissue is only formed in female birds that are laying eggs, as it is used to supply calcium to shells. Its presence in the Allosaurus <b>individual</b> <b>has</b> been used to establish sex and show it had reached reproductive age. However, other studies have called into question some cases of medullary bone in dinosaurs, including this Allosaurus individual. Data from extant birds suggested that the medullary bone in this Allosaurus individual may have been the result of a bone pathology instead. However, with the confirmation of medullary tissue indicating gender in a specimen of Tyrannosaurus, {{it may be possible to}} ascertain whether or not the Allosaurus in question was indeed female.|$|E
5|$|The {{doctrine}} of legitimate expectation in Singapore protects both procedural and substantive rights. In administrative law, a legitimate expectation generally arises when {{there has been}} a representation of a certain outcome by the public authorities to an individual. To derogate from the representation may amount to an abuse of power or unfairness. The {{doctrine of}} legitimate expectation as a ground to quash decisions of public authorities has been firmly established by the English courts. Thus, where a public authority has made a representation to an individual who would be affected by a decision by the authority, the <b>individual</b> <b>has</b> a legitimate expectation to have his or her views heard before the decision is taken. Alternatively, an individual may also have a legitimate expectation to a substantive right. The recognition of substantive legitimate expectations is somewhat controversial as it requires a balancing of the requirements of fairness against the reasons for any change in the authority's policy. This suggests the adoption of a free-standing proportionality approach, which has been said not to apply in administrative law.|$|E
5|$|Those with {{epilepsy}} are {{at about}} twice {{the risk of being}} involved in a motor vehicular collision and thus {{in many areas of the}} world are not allowed to drive or only able to drive if certain conditions are met. In some places physicians are required by law to report if a person has had a seizure to the licensing body while in others the requirement is only that they encourage the person in question to report it themselves. Countries that require physician reporting include Sweden, Austria, Denmark and Spain. Countries that require the individual to report include the UK and New Zealand and the physician may report if they believe the <b>individual</b> <b>has</b> not already. In Canada, the United States and Australia the requirements around reporting vary by province or state. If seizures are well controlled most feel allowing driving is reasonable. The amount of time a person must be free from seizures before they can drive varies by country. Many countries require one to three years without seizures. In the United States the time needed without a seizure is determined by each state and is between three months and one year.|$|E

5|$|Those with {{epilepsy}} or seizures {{are typically}} denied a pilot license. In Canada if an <b>individual</b> <b>has</b> {{had no more}} than one seizure, they may be considered after five years for a limited license if all other testing is normal. Those with febrile seizures and drug related seizures may also be considered. In the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration does not allow those with epilepsy to get a commercial pilot license. Rarely, exceptions can be made for persons who have had an isolated seizure or febrile seizures and have remained free of seizures into adulthood without medication. In the United Kingdom, a full national private pilot license requires the same standards as a professional driver's license. This requires a period of ten years without seizures while off medications. Those who do not meet this requirement may acquire a restricted license if free from seizures for five years.|$|E
