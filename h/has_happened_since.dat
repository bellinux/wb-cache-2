5|$|Several Michigan {{school records}} were broken or tied in the blowout win. The Wolverines' 727 yards of total offense {{set a new}} team record; the 442 total {{offensive}} yards {{in the first half}} alone also set a team record. Their 57-point win tied the second-biggest margin of victory for them since 1950, and tied for the eighth-largest margin of victory in school history. The 49 first half points was the team's second highest ever. The 28 point first quarter also tied a school record. Because of the effectiveness of the offense, the team did not punt the ball once, the first time this <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>since</b> 1978.|$|E
5|$|Construction for the Independência (officially Estádio Raimundo Sampaio) {{started in}} 1947 in {{preparation}} for the 1950 FIFA World Cup, during which its first match was played. Originally the property of the State Government of Minas Gerais, ownership was transferred to Sete de Setembro FC in 1965, when the Mineirão was built, and the property passed to América in 1997, when it absorbed Sete de Setembro. Before the Mineirão, the stadium was the largest in Belo Horizonte — holding up to 30,000 people — and was preferred by Atlético over the older and smaller Antônio Carlos stadium. After the Mineirão's construction, however, Atlético did not use the Estádio do Horto (as it is also known) for decades, except for a brief spell in the late 1990s. The stadium was renovated in 2012, while the Mineirão was closed, having its capacity reduced to 23,018. In that year, Atlético announced a deal with BWA Arenas, the stadium manager. The club signed a contract to use the Independência as its home ground for 10 years, which <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>since</b> then, except in important and high-attendance matches.|$|E

25|$|The Second Test in the Australian cricket team's tour of India {{in early}} 2001 was a Test match played over five days at Eden Gardens in Kolkata from 11–15 March 2001.

25|$|In 1965, {{both the}} Major League All-Star Game and the World Series were played at Metropolitan Stadium, {{one of the}} few times that {{coincidence}} <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>since</b> the former event was inaugurated in 1933. (Game 7 of that year's World Series drew 50,596 fans to the Met, the only time a baseball crowd exceeded 50,000 and the biggest-ever attendance for baseball at the stadium.) The Vikings hosted the 1969 NFL Championship Game at the stadium.|$|E
25|$|Everything that <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>since</b> has {{therefore}} {{been planned}} by God to help humanity overcome this initial mishap and achieve spiritual maturity. The {{world has been}} intentionally designed by God as a difficult place, where human beings are forced to make moral decisions, as only in this way can they mature as moral agents. Irenaeus likens death to the big fish that swallowed Jonah: {{it was only in}} the depths of the whale's belly that Jonah could turn to God and act according to the divine will. Similarly, death and suffering appear as evils, but without them we could never come to know God.|$|E

500|$|None of the Mono Craters {{near the}} lake show {{the effects of}} wave erosion, but a hill at the {{southern}} end of the field shows what Israel Russell called a [...] "beach line". The present elevation of this beach line is the level of the Mono Lake high stand before the formation of the northern Mono Craters, plus any surface deformation that <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>since</b> that time. Stream-rounded stones are found on the volcanoes, and were lifted up as the volcanoes grew. Although glaciers were present throughout the Sierra Nevada, they did not reach as far down as the Mono Craters.|$|E

2500|$|Kinney {{said that}} there are lyrics on the album that deal with {{original}} vocalist Layne Staley. He elaborated, [...] "There's not a day that goes by that I don't think of him. And there's a lot to address, with all of that stuff coming to the forefront. A lot <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>since</b> 1995; a lot has happened in our lives and we've never talked about it or discussed it publicly. So some of that is what's addressed here. That's the way we operate, it's about what really happened in life. We're not really the fast cars and chicks songs. It's basically what's happened in life, but a lot <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>since</b> the last record. And it's on this record." [...] The title track, [...] "Black Gives Way to Blue", was written as a tribute to Staley. Regarding the lyrics to other specific songs, Cantrell said the first single from the album, [...] "A Looking in View", [...] "basically speaks to any number of things that keep you balled up inside." [...] The second single, [...] "Check My Brain", features lyrics dealing with Cantrell's move from Seattle to Los Angeles in 2003. The third single, [...] "Your Decision", contains lyrics about [...] "surviving pain and choosing to live." [...] Cantrell also denied a popular misconception that the song [...] "Private Hell" [...] is about Layne Staley. He stated that the song is in fact about himself breaking up with a girl that he loved a lot and he [...] "wasn't man enough to go through with it". But Cantrell also pointed out that there's {{a lot of things in}} the song that aren't specifically about that and other people can relate to.|$|E
