5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{exited the}} west coast of Africa and emerged <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Ocean on September11. After tracking westward for five days, the wave entered the Caribbean Sea on September16. Convection steadily increased in both coverage and intensity, and by September19, the system reached the southwestern Caribbean Sea. Satellite imagery and surface observations indicated that Tropical Depression Nine formed at 1800UTC on September19, while located 50miles (80km) north-northwest of San Andres Island.|$|E

5|$|After {{crossing}} into Virginia, Jeanne transitioned into an extratropical cyclone by September 29 near Washington, D.C. In Wilmington, Delaware, {{the storm}} spawned an F2 tornado. Across the Mid-Atlantic and New England, {{moisture from the}} storm produced light to heavy rainfall, with totals of over 7inches (175mm) near Philadelphia and Nantucket. Subsequent to becoming extratropical, the remnants of Jeanne turned eastward, exited <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Ocean, and merged with a cold front.|$|E
5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the Review, Admiral Graf Spee returned to Spain for a fourth non-intervention patrol. Following fleet manoeuvres and a brief visit to Sweden, the ship conducted a fifth and final patrol in February 1938. In 1938, KzS Hans Langsdorff took command of the vessel; she conducted a series of goodwill visits to various foreign ports throughout the year. These included cruises <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic,</b> where she stopped in Tangier and Vigo. She also participated in extensive fleet manoeuvres in German waters. She was part of the celebrations for the reintegration of the port of Memel into Germany, and a fleet review in honour of Admiral Miklós Horthy, the Regent of Hungary. Between 18 April and 17 May 1939, she conducted another cruise <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic,</b> stopping in the ports of Ceuta and Lisbon. On 21 August 1939, Admiral Graf Spee departed Wilhelmshaven, bound for the South Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|Deutschland {{spent the}} {{majority}} of 1938 and 1939 conducting training maneuvers {{with the rest of}} the fleet and making goodwill visits to various foreign ports.

5|$|Many major {{ports and}} {{positions}} were incorporated <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Wall, receiving heavy fortifications. Hitler ordered all positions {{to fight to}} the end, and some of them remained in German hands until Germany's unconditional surrender. Several of the port fortresses were resupplied by submarines after being surrounded by Allied Forces. The defenders of these positions included foreign volunteers and Waffen-SS troops.|$|E
5|$|Moving east-southeast into {{southern}} Middlesex County, it continued producing severe winds (gusting up to 90mph; 145km/h) and very heavy rain. Another tornado touched down very briefly in Norfolk County, {{followed by two}} more brief touchdowns in Plymouth County near 5:30PM. The storm then weakened, but still managed to produce 60mph (95km/h) winds on Cape Cod, before finally moving out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> and dissipating.|$|E

His 1st watch officer on this patrol was Oberleutnant zur See August Maus, 2nd watch officer was Lauzemis. Merten did not sink any ships on this patrol.|$|R
5|$|Not long afterwards, the Kriegsmarine {{launched}} Operation Rheinübung. The Bismarck {{and heavy}} cruiser Prinz Eugen set out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> from Norway. Their target was the Atlantic Convoys. During the later {{stage of the}} Bismarck operation, a Catalina of No. 209 Squadron RAF spotted the vessel, just 650 miles short of his destination port of Brest, France. It relayed {{the message to the}} British Fleet, enabling Fairey Swordfish aircraft to intercept. An 818 Naval Air Squadron FAA aircraft piloted by Sub-Lieutenant John Moffat hit the Bismarck with a torpedo on its stern, jamming its rudder gears, which eventually led to its sinking. Prinz Eugen had been detached prior to Bismarck last battle. Despite her discovery by Coastal Command's aircraft further south, she escaped to Brest on 1 June. Rheinübung was the last attempt by a Kriegsmarine surface ship to breakout <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic.</b>|$|E

50|$|Additionally, it {{has been}} found from a {{separate}} study that a freshwater flux of 0.53 Sv <b>into</b> <b>the</b> North <b>Atlantic</b> Ocean in <b>the</b> absence of an existing thermohaline circulation could reduce North Atlantic Deep Water production by 95% in about a century. Large fluxes such as this are capable of cooling the oceans and climate on a large scale.

5|$|The {{outbreak}} {{was expected}} to continue into October 19 east of the Appalachians, however, extensive cloud cover prevented any significant severe storms from developing although several wind reports were reported in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Massachusetts.

5|$|The {{precursor}} to Hurricane Donna brought severe weather to the Dakar area of Senegal. Air France Flight AF343, which was flying from Paris, France to Abidjan, Ivory Coast, attempted {{to land at}} the Léopold Sédar Senghor International Airport as a layover. However, due to squally weather, the plane instead crashed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Ocean, killing all 63people on board. Heavy rainfall was also reported in Cape Verde on August30.|$|E
5|$|U-43 sailed from Wilhelmshaven on 13 May 1940 and out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic.</b> Her first attack {{took place}} on 28 May, {{south-west}} of Land's End, when she fired a torpedo at the British merchant ship Alca. She missed, and then opened fire with her deck gun. The armed ship returned fire, but neither vessel made any hits; the U-boat broke off the attack.|$|E

5|$|A {{hurricane}} {{was located}} in the central Gulf of Mexico on September 9, potentially the same hurricane as the previous storm. It tracked generally eastward toward the coast of Florida, with its hurricane intensity estimation based on two ship reports. At about 0000UTC on September 12, it moved ashore near Clearwater, Florida as a minimal hurricane, with an estimated minimum barometric central pressure of 985mbar. Accelerating east-northeastward while crossing the state, the cyclone emerged <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Ocean as a weakened tropical storm before regaining hurricane status on September 13. Later that day, it was last observed about 250mi (400km) east-southeast of Cape Hatteras.|$|E
5|$|A {{moderately}} strong hurricane with {{winds of}} 105mph (165km/h) was first spotted on October 6 east of Jamaica. Passing {{a short distance}} south of the island, the hurricane tracked northwestward and brushed the Yucatán Peninsula before turning north-northeastward into the Gulf of Mexico. Late on October 9, it made landfall a short distance east of Apalachicola, Florida at peak winds with an estimated pressure of 969mbar. Rapidly weakening to tropical storm status, the cyclone continued northeastward and emerged <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Ocean from North Carolina on October 11. Later that day, it was last observed about 250mi (400km) southeast of Cape Cod.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} depression developed just offshore {{the west coast}} of Africa on September6. The depression strengthened into a tropical storm later that day, shortly before passing south of the Cape Verde Islands. Further intensification was slow and halted by late on September7. However, about 48hours later, the storm resumed strengthening and became a Category1 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. The system reached Category4 intensity before striking Guadeloupe on September12. Around midday on September13, the storm strengthened into a Category5 hurricane, peaking with maximum sustained winds of 160mph (268km/h). About six hours later, the system made landfall in Puerto Rico; it was the only recorded tropical cyclone to strike the island as a Category5. After emerging <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic,</b> the storm weakened slightly, falling to Category4 intensity. It began crossing through the Bahamas on September16. Early on September17, the storm made landfall near West Palm Beach, Florida, with winds of 145mph (235km/h). While crossing Florida, the system weakened significantly, falling to Category1 intensity late on September17. It curved north-northeastward and briefly re-emerged <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> on September18, but soon made another landfall near Edisto Island, South Carolina, with winds of 85mph (140km/h). Early on the following day, the system weakened to a tropical storm and became extratropical over North Carolina hours later.|$|E
