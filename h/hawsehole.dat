25|$|On {{her third}} {{international}} sailing, Suomen Joutsen left Helsinki on 1 November 1933 {{and headed to}} the Mediterranean, where she visited the ports of Marseille, Alexandria and Naples. While heading towards Gibraltar {{on her way to the}} Atlantic, an English steam ship tauntingly offered to tow the Finnish full rigged ship which was sailing slowly close to the wind. However, shortly afterwards the wind changed its direction and Suomen Joutsen overtook the steamer with a towing line hanging from the stern <b>hawsehole,</b> offering to provide assistance for the slower ship. After stopping briefly at the Canary Islands, the ship crossed the Atlantic and arrived in Haiti on 10 March 1934 after 25 days of sailing. The return voyage began six days later. On 6 April, while in the middle of the Northern Atlantic, Suomen Joutsen was hit by hurricane-force winds that caused the ship to list almost 56 degrees. She survived the worst storm of her career without major damage and arrived in Helsinki on 16 May 1934.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Hawsehole</b> is a {{nautical}} {{term for}} a small hole in the hull of a ship through which hawsers may be passed. Also known as a cat hole. In the (British) Royal Navy, an officer who {{had served as a}} seaman before being promoted was said to have [...] "come in through the hawsehole." ...|$|E

5000|$|Besides the raked, paired masts, {{the other}} {{distinctive}} {{feature of the}} bugeye is the mounting of the bowsprit. This was mounted between paired hawsepieces and knightheads, and terminated in a large vertical post called the [...] "samson post", upon which the anchor windlass was also typically mounted. The hawsepieces projected above the deck and, with the prominent <b>hawseholes,</b> are thought possibly to be {{the origin of the}} name [...] "bugeye".|$|R
5|$|After {{consultation}} with Admiralty, Adams {{took advantage of}} this freedom to make four substantive changes to the Tartar design. The ship's wheel was moved from behind the mizzen mast to before it to improve the helmsman's line of sight. The tiller was also relocated, from an exposed position on the quarterdeck to a safer location belowdecks and near the stern. The vessel's <b>hawseholes</b> were relocated from the lower to the upper deck to allow additional storage space inside the hull. Finally, {{in recognition of the}} vessel's likely role in chasing small enemy craft, the leading pair of gunports were moved from the sides of the vessel to the bow in order to form a battery of chase guns.|$|R
50|$|With manning costs netted out on Erickson's balance sheet, {{the ships}} {{continued}} {{to return a}} paper profit. However Erickson was under no illusions as to the long term profitability of his venture, which depended on ignoring the depreciation on his ships and a shrinking supply of sound hulls and rigs. The company would use their profits to diversify into steam after World War II. While the shipping companies of Erickson and F. Laeisz gradually turned to steam, {{the next generation of}} captains were climbing up the <b>hawsehole</b> and taking command of their own vessels, redefining sail training as a purely educational endeavour with trainees as the cargo.|$|E

5000|$|To [...] "cut and run" [...] {{was defined}} by Englishman David Steel in 1794 as [...] "to cut the cable and make sail instantly, without waiting to weigh anchor". He further {{described}} the practice as [...] "quick but very expensive" [...] but sometimes necessary, such as when the anchor is hooked on rocks and cannot be retrieved, in bad weather, when the anchor is on lee shore and the ship {{is in danger of}} embayment, or when one must quickly escape or pursue an enemy; instead of cutting the anchor by axe at the <b>hawsehole,</b> Steel offered an alternate method of slipping the anchor cable if time permitted, a method he felt wiser than cutting as it potentially prevented loss of anchor and cable. An alternate origin comes from the practice on square rig ships to furl the sails stopped to the yards with ropeyarns so that the yarns may be cut to let the sails fall unfurled should an urgent need to sail arise. The phrase was in use by the early 1700s, and Oxford English Dictionary cited the earliest printed usage of the phrase to The Boston News-Letter in 1704.|$|E
6000|$|The skipper, as his wont was, {{gave the}} order in a stern tone of command, and {{resigned}} the tiller to Grummidge, who came aft at the moment. The men saw with surprise that a heavy squall was bearing down on them from the eastward. Mutiny flew, as it were, out at the <b>hawseholes,</b> while discipline re-entered by the cabin windows. Even Big Swinton was cowed for the moment. It {{may be that the}} peculiar way in which Paul Burns eyed him and toyed with the handspike had some effect on him. Possibly he was keenly alive to the danger which threatened them. At all events, he went to work like the rest! ...|$|R
50|$|The {{lower part}} of the bow of the vessel, instead of being made solid as usual, is {{composed}} of two iron flaps, each hinged at the top, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2. When closed, the outer surfaces of these flaps correspond to the general shape of the bow, and, when the torpedo machinery is not being worked, they are kept down in their places by means of chains attached to them near their lower edges, and passing in through a pair of hawsepipes situated between the flaps. Each chain, after entering its hawsepipe, is attached to an iron rod, these rods passing into the vessel through stuffing-boxes at the inner ends of the hawsepipes. From the inner ends of these rods chains are led, over guide pulleys, to the ends of a winch, situated as shown in Figs. 2 and 3, and by means of this winch, which is worked by hand, the flaps can be closed when required. The opening of the flaps is effected by the arrangements shown in Figs. 1 and 4, from which it will be seen that each flap has a chain attached to its outside, and that these chains, after being led up over guide pulleys supported by brackets placed {{at the level of the}} gunwale, are crossed and then led down through <b>hawseholes</b> in the deck to the winch below. The chains for opening, in fact, form continuations of those for closing the flaps, or vice versa.|$|R
60|$|There {{is but one}} solitary tenant in the chicken-coop, once a gay and dapper young cock, bearing him so bravely {{among the}} coy hens. But look at him now; there he stands, moping all the day long on that {{everlasting}} one leg of his. He turns with disgust from the mouldy corn before him, and the brackish water in his little trough. He mourns no doubt his lost companions, literally snatched from him one by one, and never seen again. But his days of mourning will be few; for Mungo, our black cook, told me yesterday that the word had at last gone forth, and poor Pedro’s fate was sealed. His attenuated body will be laid out upon the captain’s table next Sunday, and long before night will be buried, with all the usual ceremonies, beneath that worthy individual’s vest. Who would believe {{that there could be}} any one so cruel as to long for the decapitation of the luckless Pedro; yet the sailors pray every minute, selfish fellows, that the miserable fowl may be brought to his end. They say the captain will never point the ship for the land so long as he has in anticipation a mess of fresh meat. This unhappy bird can alone furnish it; and when he is once devoured, the captain will come to his senses. I wish thee no harm, Peter; but as thou art doomed, sooner or later, to meet the fate of all thy race; and if putting a period to thy existence is to be the signal for our deliverance, why—truth to speak—I wish thy throat cut this very moment; for, oh! how I wish to see the living earth again! The old ship herself longs to look out upon the land from her <b>hawseholes</b> once more, as Jack Lewis said right the other day when the captain found fault with his steering.|$|R
