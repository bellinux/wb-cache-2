5|$|Square {{released}} Final Fantasy Tactics Advance for the Nintendo Game Boy Advance in 2003. The game {{setting and}} engine {{are similar to}} the ones of its predecessor, however the characters and plot are notably different; the cast of characters <b>is</b> <b>considerably</b> smaller, and the plot <b>is</b> <b>considerably</b> simpler. Additionally, Final Fantasy Tactics Advance has a shorter main campaign, but more side missions and a secret campaign {{at the end of the}} game.|$|E

5|$|Adult {{specimens}} have {{a moderately}} flared, posteriorly protruding outer lip, which <b>is</b> <b>considerably</b> thickened and completely devoid of marginal spikes or plicae. The body whorl is roundly swollen at the shoulder, {{with a few}} anterior spiral grooves. The shell has a medium-to-high cone-shaped spire, with at least five delicately furrowed whorls.|$|E
5|$|As {{a college}} town, Flagstaff's {{population}} <b>is</b> <b>considerably</b> more educated than the U.S. average. 89.8% {{of the population}} has a high school diploma or higher, while the national average is 80.4%. 39.4% {{of the population has}} a bachelor's degree or higher, compared to the national average of 24.4%.|$|E
5|$|The Moon's {{appearance}} <b>is</b> <b>considerably</b> more complex. Its motion, {{like the}} Sun, is between two limits — known as lunistices rather than solstices. However, its travel between lunistices <b>is</b> <b>considerably</b> faster. It takes a sidereal month to complete its cycle {{rather than the}} year-long trek of the Sun. This is further complicated as the lunistices marking {{the limits of the}} Moon's movement move on an 18.6 year cycle. For slightly over nine years the extreme limits of the moon are outside the range of sunrise. For the remaining half of the cycle the Moon never exceeds the limits of the range of sunrise. However, much lunar observation was concerned with the phase of the Moon. The cycle from one New Moon to the next runs on an entirely different cycle, the Synodic month. Thus when examining sites for lunar significance the data can appear sparse due the extremely variable nature of the moon. See Moon for more details.|$|E

5|$|The camera's {{resolution}} is two-and-a-half {{times higher than}} the handheld's screens. However, their resolution <b>is</b> <b>considerably</b> lower than contemporaneous digital cameras and mobile phones. This was done to help keep their price reasonable and to maintain a preferable response time for viewing photos in quick session, particularity since numerous applications will use them.|$|E
5|$|The mean {{strontium}} {{content of}} ocean water is 8mg/l. At a concentration between 82 and 90 µmol/l of strontium, the concentration <b>is</b> <b>considerably</b> {{lower than the}} calcium concentration, which is normally between 9.6 and 11.6mmol/l. It is nevertheless much {{higher than that of}} barium, 13μg/l.|$|E
5|$|Views on the {{evolutionary}} {{position of the}} monkey-flower species have changed. It was long considered {{to be in the}} family Scrophulariaceae, but is now placed in Phyrmaceae, primarily on the basis of DNA evidence. The genus Phryma (comprising only a single species), for which the family is named, <b>is</b> <b>considerably</b> different in morphology from all of the monkey-flowers.|$|E

5|$|Caversham's 2006 {{population}} was 5,058. The suburb {{has a slightly}} higher proportion of elderly residents than the Otago average, with 15.8% of residents aged 65 and over. It also has a considerably higher proportion of residents of Māori and Pacific island descent than the Otago average (10.3% and 4.4% respectively). Caversham also has nearly twice the average Otago proportion of one-parent families (26.5%). Ownership of and access to home telecommunications (such as the internet) and to private motor vehicles <b>is</b> <b>considerably</b> lower than the Otago average.|$|E
5|$|For {{a general}} system, states are {{typically}} not pure, but instead are represented as statistical mixtures of pure states, or mixed states, given by density matrices: self-adjoint operators of trace {{one on a}} Hilbert space. Moreover, for general quantum mechanical systems, {{the effects of a}} single measurement can influence other parts of a system {{in a manner that is}} described instead by a positive operator valued measure. Thus the structure both of the states and observables in the general theory <b>is</b> <b>considerably</b> more complicated than the idealization for pure states.|$|E
5|$|Muslim {{women also}} {{generally}} wear similar dresses as the Hindu women. However, the one {{difference is that}} the tunic they wear <b>is</b> <b>considerably</b> shorter, just touching the knee. They don a small vest called a angi, worn beneath the bodice. A small shirt or kurta is also common. Hindu men wear an angrakha, long tunic that touches the knees. A cloth waist-band and tight fitting pajama and a small pagri (top hat) worn on top of the head completes their ensemble.|$|E

5|$|NSB {{operates}} a commuter rail service from Bergen with two hourly departures to Arna, plus fourteen daily departures to Voss, of which {{up to six}} continue to Myrdal. Rolling stock is the Class 69 multiple units. The first part to Arna represents {{an important part of}} the public transport in Bergen, since the rail direct line through the mountain Ulriken <b>is</b> <b>considerably</b> faster than driving around.|$|E
5|$|Neon gives a {{distinct}} reddish-orange glow {{when used in}} low-voltage neon glow lamps, high-voltage discharge tubes and neon advertising signs. The red emission line from neon also causes the well known red light of helium–neon lasers. Neon is used in some plasma tube and refrigerant applications but has few other commercial uses. It is commercially extracted by the fractional distillation of liquid air. Since air is the only source, it <b>is</b> <b>considerably</b> more expensive than helium.|$|E
5|$|Portishead has a {{population}} of 22,000, an increase of over 3,000 since the figure of 17,130 recorded in the 2001 census, with a growth rate of 40 per cent, which <b>is</b> <b>considerably</b> in excess of surrounding towns. As the result of a house-building programme, a further 8,000people are expected to settle in the area over the next few years, making Portishead one of the largest towns in North Somerset.|$|E

50|$|As the photocontrast channel {{provides}} effective head-on engagement ability, {{firing range}} against an approaching target can <b>be</b> <b>considerably</b> {{longer than the}} maximum ranges listed above, likewise maximum firing range would <b>be</b> <b>considerably</b> less than the maximum range of target destruction against a receding target. Definition of range and effective ceiling for MIM-72 is unknown and the figures are therefore not directly comparable.|$|R
5|$|The magma {{intrusion}} rate below Uturunku <b>is</b> <b>considerably</b> {{larger than}} the magma output of the Pleistocene volcano, being comparable to the magma flux of historic eruptions and estimates of magma generation rates in local caldera forming magma chambers. Evidence {{for the formation of}} such a magma chamber is elusive but might be hidden by the deformation activity of the APVC melt generation zone. Uturunku may be developing into a supervolcano, and a caldera forming super-eruption may occur there; this possibility has resulted in international media attention.|$|E
5|$|The plot of Days of Ruin <b>is</b> <b>considerably</b> darker than, and {{unrelated}} to, {{the plots}} of previous games. Almost 90% of humanity {{has been killed}} off following devastating meteor strikes which have destroyed much of civilization and caused a massive dust cloud to blot out the sun, preventing photosynthesis and thereby preventing the growing of crops. Scattered survivors pick through the wreckage, and the remnants of several military superpowers patrol the ravaged landscape, some factions protecting the innocent while the others prey upon them.|$|E
5|$|The {{valley of}} Darby Creek <b>is</b> <b>considerably</b> {{narrower}} in its upper reaches, but widens out as it approaches the Delaware River. Numerous {{reaches of the}} creek have been armored with boulders or riprap. Upstream of the tributary Cobbs Creek, the stream's channel is sinuous and the creek flows through a narrow valley bordered by low, steep hills. From Cobbs Creek downstream to its mouth, the creek is in a tidal flat.|$|E
