25|$|The COW gun {{mounting}} in {{the nose}} was of Westland design, and allowed the gun to be trained over a wide arc. It supported the gun on the apex of a pyramidal structure, that was asymmetric to allow the gunner to {{have easy access to}} the weapon. This structure was fixed on a rotating base, which also provided the gunner with a rotating platform to stand on. The gunner could train the mount by turning a <b>hand</b> <b>gear,</b> or push on a pedal to engage a brake that locked the mount in its position. The elevation and depression of the gun were accomplished by the muscle power of the gunner. As the large ammunition clip of the COW gun prevented sighting over the barrel, a sight was installed to its left. The gun is reported to have been successfully fired in the air, also when trained to the side.|$|E
2500|$|A {{powerful}} steam windlass {{was situated}} {{forward on the}} shelter deck for working the anchors, which were arranged to be stowed in hawse pipes, and two large capstans were fitted aft on the shelter deck for warping purposes. A combined steam and hand steering engine was also located aft, and this was controlled by a telemotor gear from the navigating bridge. There was also a powerful steering gear situated forward, the purpose of which was to operate a bow rudder so as to facilitate the quick turning and manoeuvring of the vessel when entering or leaving port.For the stern rudder there was a combined steam and <b>hand</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Two-Point-Six {{replaced}} the Riley Pathfinder as Riley's top-line automobile {{when it was}} announced on 23 August 1957. While its predecessor retained the renowned Riley 4 cylinder twin cam, cross flow engine, Riley suspension and gearbox with its almost unique right <b>hand</b> <b>gear</b> lever, the Two-Point-Six was virtually identical to the Wolseley Six-Ninety Series III. It featured both monotone and duotone paintwork, as did the last of the Pathfinders.|$|E

Its original <b>hand</b> <b>gear</b> change was replaced with a foot change not long after, and this is still fitted to the bike. Spring-heeled Jack remained a regular at the factory as it was apparently owned by Charles Udall of the Velocette Development Department until it was purchased and used for daily transport, despite still not having a kick start, by Fred Teague.|$|E
50|$|The Class 10 was of an {{extremely}} advanced {{design for the}} day. At 7 ft long, the firebox was somewhat shorter than usual practice, but much wider at 6 ft. It had a rocking firegrate with a drop grate at the front. The rocking grate was operated by a small steam cylinder of 4 in bore and 6 in stroke, arranged under the footplate. This arrangement became standard practice on all new locomotives, except on those equipped with mechanical stokers where it was found preferable to divide the grate into sections which could be shaken separately by <b>hand</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|E
25|$|On 23 August 2008, AIRES Flight 051 {{sustained}} substantial damage {{following the}} collapse of the right <b>hand</b> main landing <b>gear</b> on landing at Barranquilla-Ernesto Cortissoz Airport (BAQ), Colombia. None of the 31 occupants were injured. The Bombardier Dash 8-301, registered HK-3952, operated on an international flight from Curaçao-Hato International Airport (CUR). The approach and landing were normal, touching down about 770 metres past the threshold of runway 23.

5000|$|The Velocette KTT is {{a racing}} British {{motorcycle}} made by Velocette. The most significant {{variant of the}} Model K series of overhead camshaft Velocette motorcycles, the TT designation indicated the machine was intended for racing, and was an early example of a 'production racer' (although KTTs could be ordered as road-legal machines). [...] The Velocette KTT was notable for having the first positive-stop foot gear change on a motorcycle. As well as being significant improvement for racing, this quickly replaced the difficult <b>hand</b> <b>gear</b> change lever and became the standard for almost all motorcycles to this day.|$|E

50|$|The 680 {{engine was}} fitted into a diamond-type frame with Brampton forks. Martinsyde had to {{overcome}} problems with components before their new range could be launched, initially under the trade name of Martinsyde-Newman until the third partner Newman left the company. Newman was also involved in manufacturing and designing the Ivy (motorcycles). The motorcycle twin had a <b>hand</b> <b>gear</b> change and a three-speed gearbox built under licence from AJS. The Martinsyde’s engine was very flexible and became popular for off-road trials competition, where the singles quickly gained a reputation for reliability, at Brooklands, where Martinsyde won the team award in 1922, and the Scottish Six Days Trial.|$|E

50|$|The natural design {{progression}} from the Lotec was the Pullman combination motorcycle. The heavy but economic Mini engine lent itself {{to having a}} sidecar attached for long distance touring. The first Austel Pullman prototype appeared in 1987 with a Mini 850cc engine, shaft drive, solenoid operated handlebar mounted gear change, drum brakes, Austel 8 spoke steel wheels and leading link anti dive front forks. The production models were revised to have 1300cc engines, full duplex frame with box section swing arm, twin front disc brakes with single rear disc and a front-mounted radiator. With the sidecar attached it was then {{possible to have a}} manual gearbox with <b>hand</b> <b>gear</b> stick although this meant the gear selection was rotated 90 degrees due the engine being positioned longitudinally in the frame. The sidecar choice was down to the customer and could be fitted with a fuel tank in the boot for greater capacity and a dummy tank on the bike that could be removed easily for engine maintenance. No two Austel motorcycles were ever the same due to design developments and customer requirements.|$|E
5000|$|Based on the Velocette KSS, the KTT was {{developed}} as a production racer specifically for the challenging Isle of Man TT course, which {{was the most important}} road race in the world at the time. [...] A racing version of the Model K was built by Percy and Eugene Goodman, sons of the Velocette founder Johannes Gutgemann, in 1925 and after twelve months of development secured Velocette their first TT win in 1926. Alec Bennett was the winner with Gus Kuhn and Fred Povey finishing in the first nine to give the factory the team prize. Further work on KTT led to the first positive-stop foot gear change on a motorcycle in 1928. Other makers had modified the hand change for foot operation but none had designed a mechanism which could change gears up or down with a single movement, and return the shift lever to its original position. As well as being significant improvement for racing, this quickly replaced the <b>hand</b> <b>gear</b> change lever and became the standard for almost all motorcycles to this day.|$|E

The exhaust of the inner cylinders on the front power unit passed to the smokebox via a similar ball-and-socket joint, installed close to the universal joint. The exhaust of the rear power unit's cylinders escaped through the auxiliary chimney in the coal bunker.|$|R

5000|$|According to The Engineer of 1890:The Agenoria has upright {{cylinders}} working half-beams, {{thus reducing}} {{the stroke of}} the pistons to the cranks. The cylinders are 7 ½ in. diameter, with a stroke of 3 ft. There is a parallel motion to the piston-rod, and the feed pump is worked {{from one of the}} half-beams. The fire is within a large tubular boiler, branching into two tubes, with the chimney {{at the end of the}} boiler, the barrel of which is 10ft. long and 4ft. diameter. The excentrics for driving the slides are loose on the axle, with a clutch to drive either way, and there is <b>hand</b> <b>gear</b> to the valves to cause the axle to turn half round to bring the right clutch into action. The exhaust steam is discharged into the chimney, but it does not necessarily follow that it acted as a steam blast. Indeed, the great height given to the chimney can have no other object than to create the required draught. The driving wheels are 4 ft. diameter, and there are coupling rods to the front wheels, which are provided with springs.|$|E
5000|$|In 1905 the Stevens Motor Manufacturing Company built a V-twin {{motorcycle}} {{powered by}} a JA Prestwich Industries Ltd motor, with leading-link front forks and a swinging fork at the rear. [...] A new company, A J Stevens & Co (AJS), was founded in 1909 to manufacture motorcycles and at the 1912 London Motorcycle show they launched the 698cc side valve AJS Model D. Featuring cylinders at 50 degrees and chain drive to a three speed countershaft gearbox with a <b>hand</b> <b>gear</b> change, the original engines had quickly removable cylinder heads but after problems with oil leaks a more permanent head was specified for 1913. [...] The side valve engine was lubricated by a 'total loss' system operated by a hand pump. Ignition was achieved with a Splitdorf Magneto and the fuel system featured an Amac automatic carburettor. The silencer was made from cast aluminium and the frame was a tubular 'diamond' construction, with Brampton bi-flex front forks, which had an unusual two way movement, and quickly detachable wheels. The sidecar version of the Model D proved particularly successful and became so popular that AJS {{were not able to}} meet demand.|$|E

40|$|Wildhaber-Novikov gears having {{circular}} flanks {{hold out}} a very promising {{future in the}} field of gearing for power transmission in very heavily loaded machineries. In order to optimize the profile parameters of these gears, a photoelastic investigation was carried out. Models of Wildhaber-Novikov gears made of photoelastic material, Araldite-D, were used in the investigation. Included were the models with various profile radii and fillet radii at different pressure angles. The flank and bending stresses of these gears were determined in each case and were compared with those of involute gears. From this investigation, it was concluded that the load-carrying capacity of circular-arc gears is 3. 5 times that of involute gears. It was found that with profile radius up to 1. 5 module, the bending stresses of these gears are lower than those of corresponding involute gears, under identical conditions of loading. It was observed that high pressure angles, when used for Wildhaber-Novikov gears having comparatively smaller profile radii, produce high flank stresses. Gears with larger profile radii, at smaller pressure angles were seen to have a high value for the ratio of flank stress to the bending stress. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>gears</b> with smaller profile radii, at higher pressure angles, were observed to have a smaller value for this ratio of stresses...|$|R
