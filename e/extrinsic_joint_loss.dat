40|$|The {{effects of}} current {{athletic}} footwear on lower extremity biomechanics are unknown. The {{aim of this}} study was to examine the changes, if any, that occur in peak lower extremity net joint moments while walking in industry recommended athletic footwear. Sixty-eight healthy young adults underwent kinetic evaluation of lower extremity <b>extrinsic</b> <b>joint</b> moments while walking barefoot and while walking in current standard athletic footwear matched to the foot mechanics of each subject while controlling for speed. A secondary analysis was performed comparing peak knee <b>joint</b> <b>extrinsic</b> moments during barefoot walking to those while walking in three different standard footwear types: stability, motion control, and cushion. 3 -D motion capture data were collected in synchrony with ground reaction force data collected from an instrumented treadmill. The shod condition was associated with a 9. 7 % increase in the first peak knee varus moment, and increases in the hip flexion and extension moments. These increases may be largely related to a 6. 5 % increase in stride length with shoes associated with increases in the ground reaction forces in all three axes. The changes from barefoot walking observed in the peak knee joint moments were similar when subjects walked in all three footwear types. It is unclear to what extent these increased joint moments may be clinically relevant, or potentially adverse. Nonetheless, these differences should be considered in the recommendation as well as the design of footwear in the future...|$|R

40|$|AbstractEndothelin 1 (Edn 1) {{signaling}} promotes ventral {{character to}} the facial skeleton. In zebrafish edn 1 mutants, the ventral jaw structures are severely reduced and fused to their dorsal counterparts, with a <b>loss</b> of <b>joints</b> that normally form at an intermediate dorsalâ€“ventral position. Loss of function at another locus, sturgeon, also yields <b>joint</b> <b>losses,</b> but only mild {{reductions in the}} ventral jaw structures. We show that sturgeon encodes one of two orthologs of Furin present in zebrafish, and that both furin genes may function partially redundantly to activate Edn 1 signaling. Supporting this hypothesis, early expression of edn 1 -dependent genes is downregulated in sturgeon (furinA) mutants. Later in development, expression of most of these genes recovers to near wild-type levels in furinA mutants but not in edn 1 mutants. The recovery explains the less severe furinA mutant skeletal phenotype and suggests that late gene expression is dependent on a critical level of Edn 1 signaling not present in the more severe edn 1 mutants. However, expression defects in the intermediate joint-forming domains in both mutants persist, explaining the <b>joint</b> <b>losses</b> observed later in both mutants. We further show that in both mutants the arches fail to correctly undergo ventral elongation before skeletogenesis begins and propose a model in which this failure is {{largely responsible for the}} loss of an Edn 1 -dependent compartmentation of the arch into the intermediate and ventral domains...|$|R

40|$|We {{suggest a}} general {{approach}} to quantification {{of different types}} of uncertainty in regression tasks performed by deep neural networks.

Unlike in many standard uncertainty quantification methods, the targets are not assumed to be sampled from an a priori given probability distribution. We analyze how the hyperparameters affect the learning process and, additionally, show that our method even allows for better predictions compared to standard neural networks without uncertainty counterparts. Finally, we show that a particular case of our approach is the mean-variance estimation given by a Gaussian network...|$|R

We then propose a <b>joint</b> <b>loss</b> to predict a spatial quantile and its exceedance region. The optimal predictor is obtained by minimizing the posterior expected loss given the process parameters, which we achieve by simulated annealing. Various predictors are compared through simulation.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} optimal prevention {{expenditures in}} a situation of multiple correlated risks. We focus on probability reduction (self-protection). This renders correlation endoge-nous so that we measure dependence as the relative deviation of the probability of <b>joint</b> <b>losses</b> from the uncorrelated case. If prevention concerns only one risk, introducing a negatively correlated exogenous risk increases the level of prevention expenditures. If prevention expen-ditures may be invested for both risks, a substitution effect arises due to the competition for resources. Under decreasing returns on self-protection we find that increased dependence in-creases overall prevention expenditures, but not necessarily prevention expenditures for each risk due to differences in prevention efficiency. Similar results are found when considering the impact of more severe losses. We derive policy implications from our results...|$|R

The long dorsal sacroiliac joint ligaments run in an oblique vertical direction while the short (interosseous) runs perpendicular from just behind the articular surfaces of the sacrum to the ilium and functions to keep the sacroiliac joint from distracting or opening.
