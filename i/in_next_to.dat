500|$|The Jesuits {{quickly learned}} the {{languages}} of their subjects, which eased the missionary work {{and contributed to the}} success of the missions. Although initially each mission were conceived as home to one specific tribe, numerous tribal families lived in the Chiquitania, and often were gathered <b>in</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> each other on the same mission. According to a report from 1745, of the 14,706 people living in the missions, 65.5% spoke Chiquitano, 11% Arawak, 9.1% Otuquis, 7.9% Zamucos, 4.4% Chapacura and 2.1% Guaraní. It should, however, be understood that by this time most of the inhabitants of these missions spoke Chiquitano as a second language. Such ethnic diversity is unique among the Jesuit missions in America. Reflecting the view of the colonial powers, the Jesuit records only distinguished between Christian and non-Christian Indios. Eventually Gorgotoqui, the formal name for language spoken by the Chiquitano tribe, became the lingua franca of the mission settlements, and the numerous tribes were culturally united in the Chiquitano ethnic group. By 1770, within three years of the expulsion of the Jesuits, Spanish authorities instituted a new policy of forced [...] "castilianization" [...] or [...] "Hispanicization" [...] of the language, thereby causing the number of speakers of native languages to decline.|$|E

And I still would lean toward no government and not so many rules, except for traffic lights and things like this. I really believe in traffic regulations." [...] Lynch continued to state that [...] "I don't know if there even is a Libertarian party. They wouldn't have a prayer of getting anywhere. So I'm a Democrat now. And I've always been a Democrat, really. But I don't like the Democrats a lot, either, because I'm a smoker, and I {{think a lot of the}} Democrats have come up with these rules for non-smoking." ...|$|E

2500|$|When Sammartino {{was about}} 51 years old, he was {{involved}} in a backstage fight with a former football player. Six men were backstage at a wrestling show in an area that was restricted, and when Sammartino spotted the men, he told them that if security saw them in this area, they might get in trouble. Dave [...] "Rooster" [...] Fleming, a former CFL player with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, stuck his hand out to Sammartino. When Sammartino went to shake his hand, Fleming began to squeeze hard, and Sammartino asked him what he was doing, to which Fleming replied, [...] "You're nothing but a washed up old man". Sammartino responded, [...] "Not too washed up to take care of you". Upon hearing that, Fleming took a swing at Sammartino, but Sammartino blocked it and knocked him down with a punch. Sammartino soon found himself fighting the other five men at once. At this time, The Iron Sheik was in the showers after his match and heard the commotion. He immediately jumped <b>in</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> Sammartino and the two wrestlers proceeded to [...] "clean house".|$|E

6000|$|Such is the {{universal}} law, which no man can ever outwit, and {{with regard to}} the railroad even we may say it is as broad as it is long. To make a railroad round the world available to all mankind is equivalent to grading the whole surface of the planet. Men have an indistinct notion that if they keep up this activity of joint stocks and spades long enough all will at length ride somewhere, <b>in</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> no time, and for nothing; but though a crowd rushes to the depot, and the conductor shouts [...] "All aboard!" [...] when the smoke is blown away and the vapor condensed, it will be perceived that a few are riding, but the rest are run over--and it will be called, and will be, [...] "A melancholy accident." [...] No doubt they can ride at last who shall have earned their fare, that is, if they survive so long, but they will probably have lost their elasticity and desire to travel by that time. This spending of the best part of one's life earning money in order to enjoy a questionable liberty during the least valuable part of {{it reminds me of the}} Englishman who went to India to make a fortune first, in order that he might return to England and live the life of a poet. He should have gone up garret at once. [...] "What!" [...] exclaim a million Irishmen starting up from all the shanties in the land, [...] "is not this railroad which we have built a good thing?" [...] Yes, I answer, comparatively good, that is, you might have done worse; but I wish, as you are brothers of mine, that you could have spent your time better than digging in this dirt.|$|E
60|$|We made no halt, but {{passing the}} crowd {{collected}} on the lawn, {{we went through the}} gateway, and only came to a stand when we had reached the centre of the court. As all the arrangements had been previously made, {{the next step was to}} inter the body. I knew that General Littlepage had often officiated on such occasions, and a request to that effect was made to him, through Tom Bayard. As for myself, I said not a word to any of my own family, begging them to excuse me until I had seen the last offices performed to the remains of my friend. In half an hour all was ready, and again the solemn procession was resumed. As before, Susquesus and Jaap led the way, the latter now carrying a shovel, and acting in the capacity of a sexton. The Indian bore a flaming torch of pine, the darkness having so far advanced as to render artificial light necessary. Others of the party had these natural flambeaux also, which added greatly to the solemnity and impressiveness of the scene. General Littlepage preceded the corpse, carrying a prayer-book. Then followed the bearers with the coffin, the horses being now dismissed. Dus, veiled in black from head to foot and leaning on Frank, appeared as chief mourner. Though this was not strictly in conformity with real New York habits, yet no one thought the occasion one on which to manifest the customary reserve of the sex. Everybody in or near the Nest, females as well as males, appeared to do honor to the memory of Chainbearer, and Dus came forth as the chief mourner. Priscilla Bayard, leaning on the arm of her brother Tom, edged herself <b>in</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> her friend, though they had not as yet exchanged a syllable together; and, after all was over, Pris. told me it was the first funeral she had ever attended, or the first time she had ever been at a grave. The same was true of my grandmother, my mother, and both my sisters. I mention this lest some antiquarian, a thousand years hence, might light on this manuscript, and mistake our customs. Of late years, the New Englanders are introducing an innovation on the old usage of the colony; but, among the upper real New York families, women do not even now attend funerals. In this respect, I apprehend, we follow the habits of England, where females of the humbler classes, as I have heard, do, while their superiors do not appear on such occasions. The reason of the difference between the two is very easily appreciated, though I limit my statements to what I conceive to be the facts, without affecting to philosophize on them.|$|E
