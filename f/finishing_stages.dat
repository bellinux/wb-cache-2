Sparks announced that she is also no longer with her previous label, RCA Records. Sparks stated her single was due {{by the end of the}} year, with an album release in 2015. Sparks stated that she and her label were picking the first single, first look, and deciding on the album name.|$|E
25|$|In {{the rest}} of Europe the {{production}} of a similar sized vessel could often take months. This large production capacity was a result of the massive number of people that the Arsenal employed, almost 16,000, and the streamlining of production within the Arsenal itself. Production was divided into 3 main stages: framing, planking and cabins, and final assembly. Each stage employed its own workers who specialized in that particular stage of production as well as using standardized parts to produce an almost assembly-line process. The Arsenal often kept up to 100 galleys in different stages of production and maintenance. That way, once a galley was launched, another could be immediately put into the <b>finishing</b> <b>stages</b> of production. The layout of the Arsenal itself was modified to enable minimal handling of materials during the stages of production. The Arsenal also saw the use of standardized, interchangeable parts.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, Gilmour {{began to think}} that his musical talents were being underused by Pink Floyd, so in 1978 he {{channelled}} his ideas into the eponymous solo album, David Gilmour, which showcased his guitar playing and songwriting skills. Music written during the <b>finishing</b> <b>stages</b> of the album, but too late to be used, was incorporated into a song by Waters, which became [...] "Comfortably Numb", which was included on The Wall. The negative atmosphere surrounding the creation of The Wall album and subsequent film, compounded by The Final Cuts virtually being a Roger Waters solo album, led Gilmour to produce his second solo album, About Face, in 1984. He used it to express his feelings about a range of topics, from the murder of John Lennon to his relationship with Waters. He has since admitted that he also used the album to distance himself from Pink Floyd. He toured Europe and the US along with support act the Television Personalities, who were promptly dropped from the line-up after Dan Treacy unwisely revealed Syd Barrett's address on stage. Mason also made a guest appearance on the UK leg of the tour, which despite some cancellations eventually turned a profit. When he returned from touring, Gilmour played guitar with a range of artists, and also produced the Dream Academy, who had a US top ten hit with [...] "Life in a Northern Town" [...] in 1986.|$|E

40|$|The {{interest}} {{in reducing the}} incidence of food-borne diseases, such as salmonellosis caused by pork is increasing. All stages in the pork supply chain can take preventive and reductive measures to decrease the Salmonella prevalence. But {{it is necessary to}} have insight in the effect of these measures on the final prevalence of contaminated carcasses. In this way imposing expensive but ineffective measures can be avoided. In {{order to be able to}} obtain such evaluations, a stochastic state-transition model is designed. Five stages are included (from piglet to carcass) and two risk-profiles are formulated for each stage: high-risk and low-risk. Scenario studies with the model indicate that all stages may contribute to an increased food safety. The impact of the multiplying stage is limited, because the animals may recover during the <b>finishing</b> <b>stage.</b> Recovery after the <b>finishing</b> <b>stage</b> is not possible, although the transport and lairage can prevent further transmission. At the slaughterhouse the number of contaminated carcasses is highly determined by the prevalence of the supplied animals and the risk profile. Measures in the <b>finishing</b> <b>stage</b> are effective in the reduction of Salmonella in pork, but may be cancelled out if the following stages do not take preventive and reductive measures...|$|R

50|$|The {{structure}} is entirely glass-reinforced plastic mostly with synthetic foam cores.
