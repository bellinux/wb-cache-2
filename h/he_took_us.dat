His predecessor as captain, Craig Conroy, cited Iginla's experience and leadership for his decision to relinquish the captaincy.

2500|$|After the Restoration of the English monarchy in 1660, John Sayer, {{a member}} St Peter's {{congregation}} was appointed chief cook to King Charles II.

In 1661, Pepys wrote [...] "...I went with Captain Morrice at his desire into the King's Privy Kitchen to Mr. Sayres, the Master Cook, and there {{we had a good}} slice of beef or two to our breakfast, and from thence <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>us</b> into the wine cellar where, by my troth, we were very merry, and I drank too much wine, and all along had great and particular kindness from Mr. Sayres, but I drank so much wine that I was not fit for business." [...] Upon his death in 1682, John Sayer left £1000 in his will {{for the construction of a}} row of almshouses on Berkhamsted High Street, containing twelve rooms for the habitation of six poor widows.
