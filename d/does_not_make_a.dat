5|$|New {{purchases}} {{of the game}} are provided with a one-time use card granting access code that unlocks the game's Cerberus Network, an online downloadable content and news service that enables bonus content for the game. However, users who bought the game used {{would have to pay}} for the Cerberus Network separately if they wanted access to the new content. This policy allows publishers to combat the used-game market; companies like GameStop have allowed costumers to sell used games back to the retailer so that the company can resell them at a small discount to other customers, but the publisher <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> profit. BioWare online development director Fernando Melo revealed that 11% of all Mass Effect 2s downloadable content revenue came from the Cerberus Network. The policy attracted criticism from some of the fan community, who have criticized downloadable content as being overpriced and an incentive for developers to leave items out of the initial release.|$|E

25|$|According to al-Kindi, {{the goal}} of metaphysics is the {{knowledge}} of God. For this reason, he <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> clear distinction between philosophy and theology, because he believes they are both concerned with the same subject. Later philosophers, particularly al-Farabi and Avicenna, would strongly disagree with him on this issue, by saying that metaphysics is actually concerned with being qua being, and as such, the nature of God is purely incidental.|$|E

25|$|All Jewish {{religious}} movements {{agree that}} a person may be a Jew either by birth or through conversion. According to halakha, a Jew by birth must be born to a Jewish mother. Halakha states that {{the acceptance of the}} principles and practices of Judaism <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> person a Jew. But, those born Jewish do not lose that status because they cease to be observant Jews, even if they adopt the practices of another religion.|$|E
25|$|Some Christians, both lay and clergy, {{live in a}} form of consecrated life, {{rather than}} in marriage. This {{includes}} {{a wide range of}} relationships, from monastic (monks and nuns), to mendicant (friars and sisters), apostolic, secular and lay institutes. While many of these also serve in some form of ministry, above, others are in secular careers, within or without the Church. Consecrated life - in and of itself - <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> person a part of the clergy or a minister of the Church, nor even one of its employees.|$|E
25|$|Usually, {{estrogen}} {{replacement therapy}} {{is used to}} spur the growth of secondary sexual characteristics {{at the time when}} puberty should onset. While very few women with Turner Syndrome menstruate spontaneously, estrogen therapy requires a regular shedding of the uterine lining ("withdrawal bleeding") to prevent its overgrowth. Withdrawal bleeding can be induced monthly, like menstruation, or less often, usually every three months, if the patient desires. Estrogen therapy <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> woman with nonfunctional ovaries fertile, but it {{plays an important role in}} assisted reproduction; the health of the uterus must be maintained with estrogen if an eligible woman with Turner Syndrome wishes to use IVF (using donated oocytes).|$|E

25|$|The rock-haunting {{ringtail}} possum lives {{exclusively in}} rocky outcrops and prefers areas with large boulders and deeply fissured rock. It uses the crevices to hide by just sticking its {{head into the}} crevice with the body exposed. It is strictly nocturnal; it only moves out of it sheltered rock crevices to climbing trees to feed at night. It <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> nest and has been observed occasionally to be sleeping in well protected rock ledges during the day. This suggests {{a high level of}} adaptation to a terrestrial existence. Indicators of a reduction in arboreal adaptation are shorter legs, shorter claws, shorter tail and a slightly longer snout.|$|E
25|$|A {{study by}} Chung et al. (2006) {{focused on how}} the {{responses}} of spinal cord injury post-traumatic stress varied depending on age. The researchers tested different age groups including young adults, middle-aged, and elderly; the average age was 25, 48 and 65 for each group respectively. After the study, they concluded that age <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> difference on how spinal cord injury patients respond to the traumatic events that happened. However, they did mention that age did {{play a role in}} the extent to which the external locus of control was used, and concluded that the young adult group demonstrated more external locus of control characteristics than the other age groups to which they were being compared.|$|E
25|$|Although {{antiretroviral}} {{therapy has}} helped {{to improve the quality}} of life of people living with HIV, there is still a need to explore other ways to further address the disease burden. One such potential strategy that was investigated was to add interleukin 2 as an adjunct to antiretroviral therapy for adults with HIV. A Cochrane review included 25 randomized controlled trials that were conducted across six countries. The researchers found that interleukin 2 increases the CD4 immune cells, but <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> difference in terms of death and incidence of other infections. Furthermore, there is probably an increase in side-effects with interleukin 2. The findings of this review do not support the use of interleukin 2 as an add-on treatment to antiretroviral therapy for adults with HIV.|$|E

25|$|A player {{must make}} their own move before {{offering}} a draw, and must not stop their own clock and start their opponent's clock before they have made the offer. If a player <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> move before offering a draw, the opponent can request a move before considering the draw offer (which cannot be retracted). No conditions may be attached to a draw offer. If a player claims a draw {{according to the rules}} of chess, the player is allowed to stop both clocks and record the draw claim as long as his or her opponent agrees to the claim. If the opponent disputes the draw claim the director may be called to come to a conclusion. If the claim is found to be correct, the game is drawn. Once a player has made a move from a position eligible for a draw, they lose their rights to claim a draw in that position.|$|E
25|$|The graphic {{timetable}} is a two-dimensional {{image of the}} train journeys. Time is displayed horizontally from midnight XII o'clock to midnight XII o'clock. The stations along the journey, from Zug and Lucerne to Chiasso, Locarno and Luino are displayed vertically. The first scheduled train, an express train with 1st, 2nd and 3rd class carriages, leaves Bellinzona at 03:17am. The train with the number55 {{is powered by a}} steam locomotive and, according to the timetable, <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> scheduled stop at Giubiasco, Rivera-Bironico and Taverne. Arrival at Lugano is scheduled at 04:09am, from where it leaves again at 04:14am. In 1899 the entire train journey from Bellinzona to Lugano was scheduled to be 52minutes. Today(2017), the same journey on one of the EC trains takes 27 minutes. The illustrations shows that between Giubiasco and Rivera Bironico trains do not pass each other as in 1899 this was, as mentioned in the paragraph above, a single track line. This information can thus be drawn form both, the stations' track layout and the {{graphic timetable}}. Also visible on the graphic timetable is the fact that between Osogna and Biasca, trains however do pass each other along their journeys, it being a double-track line. Further, the Arth-Rigi-Bahn's trains (nowadays Rigi Railways), are also listed in the Gotthard railways' timetable. The timetable's scale is 15mm/hour horizontally and 1.75mm/km vertically.|$|E

500|$|The North Circular Road (officially the A406 and {{sometimes}} known as simply the North Circular) is a [...] ring road around Central London in England. It runs from Chiswick {{in the west}} to Woolwich in the east, and connects the various suburbs in the area, including Ealing, Willesden, Wembley, Southgate, Tottenham, Woodford and Barking. Together with its counterpart, the South Circular Road, it forms a ring road through the Outer London suburbs.

500|$|In 1811, Mälzel {{brought the}} Turk to Milan for a {{performance}} with Eugène de Beauharnais, the Prince of Venice and Viceroy of Italy. Beauharnais enjoyed the machine {{so much that he}} offered to purchase it from Mälzel. After some serious bargaining, Beauharnais acquired the Turk for 30,000 francs – three times what Mälzel had paid – and kept it for four years. In 1815, Mälzel returned to Beauharnais in Munich and asked to buy the Turk back. Two versions of how much he had to pay exist, eventually working out an agreement. One version appeared in the France Letter Palamede.

On being asked to join Salem, and hearing the description of her role, Lawless said that she thought [...] "that sounds like {{a great deal of}} fun" [...] and connected it to her childhood listening to horror stories and watching horror films. She agreed to be in the series in part because of her appreciation of its writing. The New York Times Neil Genzlinger felt that the decision to hire Lawless was based on her status as [...] "one of television’s most cult-inspiring actresses" [...] and the plan to expand on the series' over-the-top horror elements.|$|E
