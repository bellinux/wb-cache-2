40|$|A generic {{theory for}} the {{frequency}} and temperature effects on the characteristic evolution of polar nanoregions (PNRs) is essential for improving and optimizing the design of relaxor-based piezoelectric and electrocaloric cooling devices. Pauli's master equation was used to deduce analytical expressions for both the polarization dynamics and frequency-tunable susceptibility dispersions of relaxors.

40|$|The complex domain {{structure}} in ferroelectrics {{gives rise to}} electromechanical coupling, and its evolution (via domain switching) results in a time-dependent (i. e. viscoelastic) response. Although ferroelectrics are used in many technological applications, most do not attempt to exploit the viscoelastic response of ferroelectrics, mainly {{due to a lack}} of understanding and accurate models for their description and prediction. Thus, the aim of this thesis research is to gain better understanding of the influence of domain evolution in ferroelectrics on their dynamic mechanical response. There have been few studies on the viscoelastic properties of ferroelectrics, mainly {{due to a lack of}} experimental methods. Therefore, an apparatus and method called Broadband Electromechanical Spectroscopy (BES) was designed and built. BES allows for the simultaneous application of dynamic mechanical and electrical loading in a vacuum environment. Using BES, the dynamic stiffness and loss tangent in bending and torsion of a particular ferroelectric, viz. lead zirconate titanate (PZT), was characterized for different combinations of electrical and mechanical loading frequencies throughout the entire <b>electric</b> displacement <b>hysteresis.</b> Experimental results showed significant increases in loss tangent (by nearly an order of magnitude) and compliance during domain switching, which shows promise as a new approach to structural damping. A continuum model of the viscoelasticity of ferroelectrics was developed, which incorporates microstructural evolution via internal variables and associated kinetic relations. For the first time, through a new linearization process, the incremental dynamic stiffness and loss tangent of materials were computed throughout the entire <b>electric</b> displacement <b>hysteresis</b> for different combinations of mechanical and electrical loading frequencies.

By combining piezoelectric and highly magnetostrictive thin films, the potentialities of these materials increase. In this paper we report the fabrication of SmFe 2 and PZT thin films and the investigation of their properties. First of all, a ~ 400 nm thin SmFe film was deposited on top of Si/SiO 2 substrate by magnetron sputter deposition. Afterwards, a 140 nm Pt bottom electrode was sputtered {{on top of the}} SmFe film forming a bottom electrode. Spin coating was employed for the deposition of the 150 nm thin PZT layer. A PZT solution with 10 %Pb excess was utilized for this fabrication step. Finally, circular Pt top electrodes were sputtered as top electrodes. This paper focuses on the microstructure of the individual films characterized by X-Ray diffractometer (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A piezoelectric evaluation system, aixPES, with TF 2000 E analyzer component was used for the <b>electric</b> <b>hysteresis</b> measurements of PZT thin films and a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) was employed for the magnetic characterization of the SmFe.

BLSF thin films can be applied to ferroelectric random access memories because of their durable fatigue-free properties and lead-free composition. We will briefly introduce epitaxial thin films grown on a variety of substrates. Because of the difficulty in growing single crystals of sufficient size to characterize the ferroelectric behavior in specific crystal growth directions, we will characterize epitaxially grown thin films to obtain basic information about the anisotropic switching behavior, which is important for evaluating the performance of emerging materials. We will then discuss the fiber-textured growth on the (111) Pt-covered Si substrates of SrBi 2 Ta 2 O 9 and Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 thin films. Because we expect that the spread crystal orientation will affect the bit-to-bit errors, we believe that the fiber-textured growth and the characterization technique for the deposited film orientation are interesting from a practical standpoint. Another specific challenge of thin film growth is the growth of a-axis-(polar axis) -oriented films. a-/b-axis-oriented films are characterized both crystallographically and by <b>electric</b> <b>hysteresis</b> loop. The hysteresis performance was in accordance with the volume fraction of the a/b domains; however, no evidence for 90 degrees switching of the b domain by an external electric field was obtained.

After a short description of the piezoelectric properties, we will conclude with a summary and the future prospects of BLSF thin films for research and applications.

We report the results of pulsed electrical conduction measurements in epitaxial magnetite thin films. We show that while the high- to low-resistance transition is driven by <b>electric</b> field, the <b>hysteresis</b> observed in $I-V$ curves results from Joule heating in the low resistance state. The shape of the hysteresis loop depends on pulse parameters, and reduces to a hysteresis-free "jump" of the current provided thermal relaxation is rapid compared to the time between voltage pulses. A simple relaxation time thermal model is proposed that captures the essentials of the hysteresis mechanism. Comment: 7 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
40|$|The pre-cracked parallel-plate {{capacitor}} {{model is}} further developed to study analytically {{the effect of}} electrostatic tractions induced by Maxwell stress and piezoelectricity on the fracture behavior of a piezoelectric material under mechanical and/or electric loading. The {{results indicate that the}} Maxwell stress and piezoelectricity induced tractions are independent and dependent on the direction of an applied <b>electric</b> field, respectively. <b>Hysteresis</b> loops in the curves of crack opening (or closing) versus applied mechanical strain and in the curves of crack opening (or closing) versus applied electric field occur under positive fields much easier than negative fields due to the piezoelectricity. Because of the potential presence of hysteresis loops, the fracture criterion must be composed of two parts: the energy release rate must exceed a critical value and the mechanical load must be higher than the critical value for crack opening.
