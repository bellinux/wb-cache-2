5|$|The Nagato {{class was}} {{equipped}} with a unique heptapodal (seven-legged) mast designed to maximize rigidity for range-finding purposes and survivability under shellfire. It consisted of a thick vertical leg in the center surrounded by six outer legs. The central leg was {{large enough to accommodate}} an electric elevator running between the foretop and main <b>deck.</b> <b>In</b> November 1944, the tops of Nagatos mainmast and funnel were removed to improve the arcs of fire for her anti-aircraft guns.|$|E

5|$|Defence against torpedo boats was {{provided}} by eight QF 6-pounder guns, although the exact type of gun is not known. Four of these were mounted on the main <b>deck</b> <b>in</b> casemates {{on the sides of}} the hull and suffered from the same problems as the six-inch guns. Hood also mounted a dozen QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns mounted in the superstructure and fighting tops. Like her sisters, the ship was fitted with seven 18-inch Torpedo tubes. Two of these were mounted in the bow below the waterline, four were placed in the sides of the hull, two on each broadside, and one in the stern. These last five tubes were all above water. She also was fitted with a plough-shaped underwater ram.|$|E
5|$|For {{self-defence}} against enemy warships, Eagle {{had nine}} BL Mk XVII 6-inch guns, three at the stern and six along {{both sides of}} the ship. The ship carried 200 rounds per gun. Two of her five QF Mk V 4-inch AA guns were positioned on the flight <b>deck</b> <b>in</b> front of the island while a third was behind the island. The remaining two guns were mounted on top of the island, one between the two funnels, and each gun was provided with 150 rounds.|$|E

5|$|Later in the decade, Portland {{upgraded}} City Hall {{by adding}} fire sprinklers and smoke detectors. In 1973, the sandstone exterior was cleaned and sealed to prevent moisture from eroding the fragile stone. It was {{later learned that}} this process was harmful as the silicon coating sealed the moisture inside the rock. In 1974, City Hall {{was added to the}} National Register of Historic Places. The following year the rooftop penthouse was converted into an employee break room that included an outdoor <b>deck.</b> <b>In</b> 1978, the city constructed a wheelchair ramp to provide access to the handicapped.|$|E
5000|$|Banana {{discharge}} used {{to start}} at 0800 on Monday, using a system of continuous-belt elevators that were dropped down the hatches and she was, thus, able to discharge all decks concurrently to the shore. There were four cargo <b>decks</b> <b>in</b> the forward two hatches and three <b>decks</b> <b>in</b> the aft two hatches. Discharging generally finished by Tuesday night or Wednesday morning; then outward passenger baggage was loaded on Wednesday, the ship sailing for Trinidad/Jamaica/Bermuda on Wednesday afternoon or evening.|$|R

5|$|Munitions and {{ammunition}} handling is accomplished using a Babcock designed highly mechanised weapons handling system (HMWHS). This {{is a first}} naval application of a common land-based warehouse system. The HMWHS moves palletised munitions from the magazines and weapon preparation areas, along track ways and via several lifts, forward and aft or port and starboard. The tracks can carry a pallet to magazines, the hangar, weapons preparation areas, and the flight <b>deck.</b> <b>In</b> a change from normal procedures the magazines are unmanned, the movement of pallets is controlled from a central location, and manpower is only required when munitions are being initially stored or prepared for use. This system speeds up delivery and reduces {{the size of the}} crew by automation.|$|E
5|$|On 30 September 1922, Tokiwa {{began her}} {{conversion}} into a minelayer at the Sasebo Naval Arsenal. To accommodate her 200–300 mines, her rear 8-inch gun turret removed, {{as were the}} six 6-inch guns on the main <b>deck.</b> <b>In</b> addition, the number of light guns was reduced to two 12-pounders, although two 8cm/40 3rd Year Type anti-aircraft (AA) guns were added. These modifications were completed in March 1924. The ship's stern suffered substantial damage in an accidental explosion in Saiki Bay on 1 August 1927 when fuzed mines were being disarmed. One mine detonated and then several others followed, killing 35 crewmen and wounding 65. Tokiwa {{was assigned to the}} reserve fleet after repairs.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} end of World War I, the number of 50-caliber 76mm guns was reduced to 13, all mounted on the turret tops, and six new 40-caliber 76-millimeter {{anti-aircraft}} (AA) guns were installed abreast the aft funnel. In addition two license-built 2-pounder AA guns were mounted on the forecastle <b>deck.</b> <b>In</b> 1925–26 the foremast was replaced by a four-legged mast, which was moved forward of the funnels, the rangefinders were upgraded, and the ship was equipped to handle a Macchi M.18 seaplane mounted on the center turret. Around that same time she was equipped with a fixed aircraft catapult on the port side of the forecastle.|$|E

5|$|The Venus Express probe {{has shown}} through stellar {{occultation}} that the atmospheric haze extends much further {{up on the}} night side than the day side. On the day side the cloud deck has a thickness of 20km and extends up to about 65km, whereas on the night side the cloud <b>deck</b> <b>in</b> {{the form of a}} thick haze reaches up to 90km in altitude—well into mesosphere, continuing even further to 105km as a more transparent haze. In 2011, the spacecraft discovered that Venus has a thin ozone layer at an altitude of 100km.|$|E
5|$|The {{mesosphere}} of Venus can {{be divided}} into two layers: the lower one between 62–73km and the upper one between 73–95km. In the first layer the temperature is nearly constant at 230K (−43°C). This layer coincides with the upper cloud <b>deck.</b> <b>In</b> the second layer temperature starts to decrease again reaching about 165K (−108°C) at the altitude of 95km, where mesopause begins. It is the coldest part of the Venusian dayside atmosphere. In the dayside mesopause, which serves as a boundary between the mesophere and thermosphere and is located between 95–120km, temperature increases to a constant—about 300–400K (27–127°C)—value prevalent in the thermosphere. In contrast, the nightside Venusian thermosphere is the coldest place on Venus with temperature as low as 100K (−173°C). It is even called a cryosphere.|$|E

5|$|The {{surviving}} soldiers mustered and awaited their officers' orders.

The women and children were placed in the ship's cutter, which lay alongside. Two other boats were manned, but one was immediately swamped and the other could not be launched due to poor maintenance and paint on the winches, leaving only three boats available. The two large boats, with capacities of 150 men each, were not among them.|$|E
