25|$|<b>Ingrown</b> eyelashes (distichiasis) {{occur in}} some curly-coated breeds, {{but they are}} not {{particularly}} common in PWDs. <b>Ingrown</b> eyelashes will rub the eye causing extensive corneal ulcerations. The condition is minor so long as it is not ignored, and can be surgically treated if necessary.|$|E
25|$|The {{treatment}} of an <b>ingrown</b> toenail partly {{depends on its}} severity.|$|E
25|$|Surgical {{treatment}} for an <b>ingrown</b> nail {{is carried out}} by a podiatrist, a foot and ankle specialist. This is typically an in-office procedure requiring local anesthesia and special surgical instruments. The surgical approach is {{the removal of the}} offending part of the nail plate known as a wedge resection. If the <b>ingrown</b> toenail recurs despite this treatment, destruction of the sides of the nail with chemicals or excision is done; this is known as a matrixcestomy. Antibiotics may be used after the procedure but are not recommended, as they may delay healing. Surgical {{treatment for}} <b>ingrown</b> nails is more effective at preventing the nail from regrowing inwards compared to non-surgical treatments.|$|E
25|$|The {{common opinion}} is that the nail enters inside the paronychium, but an <b>ingrown</b> toenail can simply be {{overgrown}} toe skin. The condition starts from a microbial inflammation of the paronychium, then a granuloma, which results in a nail buried inside of the granuloma. While <b>ingrown</b> nails can occur in the nails of both the hands and the feet , they occur most commonly with the toenails.|$|E
25|$|A true <b>ingrown</b> toenail {{is caused}} by the actual {{penetration}} of flesh by a sliver of nail.|$|E
25|$|Hair removal {{can cause}} some issues: skin inflammation, minor burns, lesions, scarring, <b>ingrown</b> hairs, bumps, and {{infected}} hair follicles.|$|E
25|$|The body hair of {{surgical}} patients may be removed before surgery. In the past {{this may have}} been achieved by shaving, but that is now considered counter-productive, so clippers or chemical depilatories may be used instead. The shaving of hair has sometimes been used in attempts to eradicate lice or to minimize body odor due to accumulation of odor-causing micro-organisms in hair. Some people with trichiasis find it medically necessary to remove <b>ingrown</b> eyelashes. Shaving against the grain can often cause <b>ingrown</b> hairs.|$|E
25|$|Predisposition, such as {{abnormally}} shaped nail beds, nail deformities {{caused by}} diseases or a genetic susceptibility, increases {{the chance of}} an <b>ingrown</b> nail, but the ingrowth cannot occur without pressure from a shoe.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms of an <b>ingrown</b> nail include pain {{along the}} margins of the nail (caused by hypergranulation that occurs around the {{aforementioned}} margins), worsening of pain when wearing tight footwear, and sensitivity to pressure of any kind, even the weight of bedsheets. Bumping of an affected toe can produce sharp and even excruciating pain as the tissue is punctured further by the nail. By {{the very nature of the}} condition, <b>ingrown</b> nails become easily infected unless special care is taken early to treat the condition by keeping the area clean. Signs of infection include redness and swelling of the area around the nail, drainage of pus and watery discharge tinged with blood. The main symptom is swelling at the base of the nail on the ingrowing side (though it may be both sides).|$|E
25|$|Shoes {{causing a}} {{bunching}} of the toes in the developmental {{stages of the}} foot (frequently in people under 21), which can cause the nail to curl and dig into the skin. This is particularly the case in ill-fitting shoes that are too narrow or too short, but any toed shoes may cause an <b>ingrown</b> nail.|$|E
25|$|One study {{compared}} {{patients with}} <b>ingrown</b> toenails to healthy controls {{and found no}} difference in the shape of toenails between those of patients and of the control group. The study suggested that treatment should not be based on the correction of a non-existent nail deformity. <b>Ingrown</b> toenails are caused by weight-bearing (activities such as walking, running, etc.) in patients that have too much soft skin tissue on the sides of their nail. Weight bearing causes this excessive amount of skin to bulge up along the sides of the nail. The pressure on the skin around the nail results in the tissue being damaged, resulting in swelling, redness and infection. Many treatments are directed at the nail itself and often include partial or full removal of the healthy nail. However, failure to treat the cutaneous condition can result in a return of the ingrowth and a deformity or mutilation of the nail.|$|E
25|$|Other {{exterior}} injuries include cuts {{caused by}} toenails piercing adjacent toes. This {{can be prevented}} by keeping toe nails cut short and filed smooth. Also, calluses may form on the bottoms and sides of the feet, which can crack open. This can be helped {{by the use of}} gel pad protectors on specific problem spots or using pads to surround the toes. <b>Ingrown</b> nails can result from ill-fitting shoes.|$|E
500|$|For their part, America's {{professional}} health associations (notably the American Medical Association and American Psychiatric Association) {{came out}} in favour of the bill. There was some initial opposition from the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, a small and extremely conservative body which opposed socialized medicine; Dr. L. S. Sprague of Tucson, Arizona said in its March 1956 newsletter that the bill widened the definition of mental health to cover [...] "everything from falling hair to <b>ingrown</b> toenails". However, the association modified its position after {{it became clear that}} the AMA took the opposite view.|$|E
500|$|Wordplay is a {{key element}} in Wodehouse's writing. This can take the form of puns, such as in Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit, when Bertie is {{released}} after a night in the police cells, and says that he has [...] "a pinched look" [...] about him. Linguistic confusion is another humorous mechanism, such as in Uncle Dynamite when Constable Potter says he has been [...] "assaulted by the duck pond." [...] In reply, Sir Aylmer, confusing the two meanings of the word [...] "by", asks: [...] "How the devil can you be assaulted by a duck pond?" [...] Wodehouse also uses metaphor and mixed metaphor to add humour. Some come through exaggeration, such as Bingo Little's infant child who [...] "not only has the aspect of a mass murderer, but that of a mass murderer suffering from an <b>ingrown</b> toenail", or Wooster's complaint that [...] "the rumpuses that Bobbie Wickham is already starting may be amusing to her, but not to the unfortunate toads beneath the harrow whom she ruthlessly plunges into the soup." [...] Bertie Wooster's half-forgotten vocabulary also provides a further humorous device. In Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit Bertie asks Jeeves [...] "Let a plugugly like young Thos loose in the community with a cosh, and you are inviting disaster and... what's the word? Something about cats." [...] Jeeves replies, [...] "Cataclysms, sir?" ...|$|E
500|$|On January 13, 2009, Mota {{returned}} to the Dodgers upon signing a one-year contract. His second stint with the Dodgers {{got off to a}} bad start, as he posted a 9.00 ERA in his first 15 games of the season. However, his statistics improved when he compiled a 0.26 ERA over his next 29 games to lower his season ERA to 2.92. From June 24 through July 29, Mota gave up no runs in 17 games ( [...] consecutive innings pitched). However, he had a 4.97 ERA over his next 13 games. On August 4, in a 17–4 victory over Milwaukee, Mota was ejected after he hit Brewers first baseman Prince Fielder with a pitch (in retaliation for Chris Smith hitting Manny Ramirez a few innings earlier, according to Dodgers catcher Russell Martin). After the game, Fielder attempted to gain entry into the Dodgers' clubhouse to confront Mota but was stopped by teammates. Both Mota and Fielder were fined by Major League Baseball for their actions. On August 31, Mota was placed on the disabled list with an <b>ingrown</b> toenail to make room for Ronnie Belliard on the roster. He was reactivated on September 14. However, after posting a 5.40 ERA in his final four games of the year, he was left off the Dodgers' playoff roster. He finished the season with a 3–4 record and a 3.44 ERA (his lowest since 2004) in 61 games. On November 6, he filed for free agency.|$|E
2500|$|Mild to {{moderate}} cases are often treated conservatively {{with warm water}} and epsom salt soaks, antibacterial ointment {{and the use of}} dental floss. If conservative treatment of a minor <b>ingrown</b> toenail does not succeed, or if the <b>ingrown</b> toenail is severe, surgical treatment may be required. A [...] "gutter splint" [...] may be improvised by slicing a cotton-tipped wooden applicator diagonally to form a bevel and using this to insert a wisp of cotton from the applicator head under the nail to lift it from the underlying skin after a foot soak.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} digit to become <b>ingrown</b> {{is the big}} toe, but {{ingrowth}} can occur on any nail. <b>Ingrown</b> nails can be avoided by cutting nails straight across; not along a curve, not too short and no shorter than the flesh around it. Footwear that is too small or too narrow, or with too shallow of a [...] "toe box", will exacerbate any underlying problem with a toenail. Sharp square corners may be uncomfortable and cause snagging on socks. Proper cutting leaves {{the leading edge of}} the nail free of the flesh, precluding it from growing into the toe. Filing of the corner is reasonable. Some nails require cutting of the corners far back to remove edges that dig into the flesh; this is often done as a partial wedge resection by a podiatrist. <b>Ingrown</b> toe nails can be caused by injury, commonly blunt trauma in which the flesh is pressed against the nail causing a small cut that swells. Injury to the nail can cause it to grow abnormally, making it wider or thicker than normal, or even bulged or crooked.|$|E
2500|$|An <b>ingrown</b> nail (also {{known as}} onychocryptosis from [...] ὄνυξ (onyx, [...] "nail") + κρυπτός (kryptos, [...] "hidden") or unguis incarnates) {{is a common}} form of nail disease. It is an often painful {{condition}} in which the nail grows so that it cuts into one or {{both sides of the}} paronychium or nail bed.|$|E
2500|$|From {{the early}} 1900s to the 1970s {{it was used}} as a soap, known as {{carbolic}} soap. Concentrated phenol liquids are commonly used for permanent treatment of <b>ingrown</b> toe and finger nails, a procedure known as a chemical matrixectomy. The procedure was first described by Otto Boll in 1945. Since that time it has become the chemical of choice for chemical matrixectomies performed by podiatrists. [...] Phenol is also used as a preservative in some vaccines.|$|E
2500|$|Once in Kentucky {{he raised}} his adopted son alone, joined a local Methodist Church, and for nine years worked at an {{elementary}} school as a volunteer and instructional assistant. [...] In 2005 Sparkman began part-time work with the United States Census Bureau and studied education with Western Governors University, an online college. In 2007, after medical treatment of an <b>ingrown</b> toe nail, Sparkman's doctor identified a cyst which led to his diagnosis of Stage-3 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cancer. [...] He continued teaching while receiving chemotherapy treatments from November 2007 to March 2008, during which time he completed his academic coursework and was invited {{to speak at the}} commencement ceremony at Western Governors University in Salt Lake City, Utah. [...] After graduation he pursued a position as a middle school math teacher.|$|E
2500|$|A less {{widely used}} {{treatment}} for <b>ingrown</b> toenails is nail bracing. Nail braces work by gently lifting {{the sides of}} the toenail and eventually retraining the nail to grow to a flatter shape over time. The total time needed for the nail to be reshaped is one full nail growth or about 18 months. [...] There are two main types of nail braces: adhesive and hooked. Adhesive nail braces are generally made of a thin strip of composite material that is glued {{to the top of the}} nail. The strip naturally tries to return to a flat state and lifts the edges of the nails in the process. Hooked nail braces consist of a hook (usually made of dental wire) placed under either side of the nail with some type of tensioning system pulling the hooks together.|$|E
2500|$|According to the National Cancer Institute, the {{aluminium}} acetates {{are used}} topically in humans as antiseptic agents, which also cause body tissues to shrink. [...] Its astringency property {{is also used}} for treating Mortellaro disease in hoofed animals such as cattle. [...] Aluminium acetate promotes healing of infected skin and also assists with inflammation, itching, and stinging. [...] The Food and Drug Administration has approved it for use for [...] "temporary relief of minor skin irritations due to ... 'poison ivy,' 'poison oak,' 'poison sumac,' 'insect bites,' 'athlete's foot,' or 'rashes caused by soaps, detergents, cosmetics, or jewelry.'" [...] For these applications, over-the-counter preparations such as Burow's solution are typically used, while diluted forms are used as gargles for conditions like aphthous ulcers of the mouth, including with amino acid additives to improve palatability and taste. [...] The most common use of Burow's solution is in treating ear infections including otomycosis, though it is generally not as effective as clotrimazole in these fungal infections. [...] Topical astringent powder Domeboro contains aluminium sulfate tetradecahydrate, , and calcium acetate monohydrate, , and forms an aluminium acetate solution similar to Burow's solution when dissolved. [...] Domeboro solutions in warm water {{can be used in}} cases of <b>ingrown</b> toenails, to reduce irritation and contain any infection which might be present.|$|E
