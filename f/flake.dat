A Bronze Age barbed and tanged arrowhead was found in a nearby field.|$|E
5|$|A {{snowflake}} is {{a single}} ice crystal that has achieved a sufficient size, and may have amalgamated with others, then falls through the Earth's atmosphere as snow. Each <b>flake</b> nucleates around a dust particle in supersaturated air masses by attracting supercooled cloud water droplets, which freeze and accrete in crystal form. Complex shapes emerge as the <b>flake</b> moves through differing temperature and humidity zones in the atmosphere, such that individual snowflakes differ in detail from one another, but may be categorized in eight broad classifications and at least 80 individual variants. The main constituent shapes for ice crystals, from which combinations may occur, are needle, column, plate and rime. Snowflakes appear white in color despite being made of clear ice. This is due to diffuse reflection of the whole spectrum of light by the small crystal facets.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{the rolling}} bearing, the <b>flaking</b> caused by rolling contact fatigue is {{classified}} into two types: surface originated <b>flaking</b> and subsurface originated <b>flaking.</b> It {{has been recognized}} that marked microstructural change can occur in subsurface originated <b>flaking</b> due to rolling contact fatigue. But there are few reports in surface originated <b>flaking</b> about microstructural change. In this study, surface originated <b>flaking</b> caused by rolling contact fatigue was investigated based on microstructural change. Thrust ball bearing and radial ball bearing was used for fatigue test. Simulation of dent originated <b>flaking</b> was carried out using the bearing with artificial dent. Another fatigue test subjected to surface originated <b>flaking</b> was done under shortage of oil film thickness lubrication condition. Microstructural change was measured by X-ray Diffractmetry (XRD) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) during fatigue testing. Microstructure of bearing steel used for fatigue test is consisted of martensite with small amount of retained austenite. XRD measurement reveals that the half peak width of martensite and volume fraction of retained austenite decreasing with increasing testing time, {{and the amount of}} decrease in these parameter were small in the surface originated <b>flaking</b> compared with subsurface originated <b>flaking</b> when the specimens were <b>flaking.</b> This suggests that surface originated <b>flaking</b> occurs in spite of mild microstructural change. TEM observation about the surface originated <b>flaking</b> shows plastic flow in the surface layer. Especially, it was confirmed that partial recrystallization occurs in the fatigue test under shortage of oil film thickness lubrication condition. But it was also confirmed that degree of recrystallization is lower in the surface originated <b>flaking</b> than subsurface one, and this reasonably explains XRD result. From these results, it was cleared that recrystallizaiton of martensite is differ in degree but not in kind between surface originated <b>flaking</b> and subsurface originated <b>flaking...</b>|$|R
40|$|Escalating {{costs of}} natural gas and {{electrical}} utilities have greatly increased the cost of <b>flaking</b> grain for feedlots. Energy demand for <b>flaking</b> is inversely related to bulk density of <b>flaked</b> grain; the lighter, more highly processed <b>flakes</b> typically require longer steaming times and greater roll pressures, which ultimately decreases mill. Corn is most commonly <b>flaked</b> to a density of about 28 lb/bushel, and published research results indicate that levels less than 28 lb/bushel afford no further advantage with respect to animal performance. Little information is available concerning the relative feed value of grains <b>flaked</b> to heavier bulk densities. <b>Flaking</b> grains to heavier bulk densities could {{make it possible to}} increase mill throughput and reduce energy costs associated with <b>flaking.</b> In this study, our objective was to evaluate milling efficiency and cattle performance when grains were <b>flaked</b> to densities of 28, 32, and 36 lb/bushel...|$|R

5|$|By {{the sixth}} or seventh day, all the skin lesions have become pustules. Between seven and ten days the pustules matured and reached their maximum size. The pustules were sharply raised, {{typically}} round, tense, and {{firm to the}} touch. The pustules were deeply embedded in the dermis, giving them {{the feel of a}} small bead in the skin. Fluid slowly leaked from the pustules, {{and by the end of}} the second week the pustules deflated, and started to dry up, forming crusts (or scabs). By day 16–20 scabs had formed over all the lesions, which have started to <b>flake</b> off, leaving depigmented scars.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} group 8 elements, {{ruthenium}} and osmium, iron exists {{in a wide range}} of oxidation states, −2 to +7, although +2 and +3 are the most common. Elemental iron occurs in meteoroids and other low oxygen environments, but is reactive to oxygen and water. Fresh iron surfaces appear lustrous silvery-gray, but oxidize in normal air to give hydrated iron oxides, commonly known as rust. Unlike the metals that form passivating oxide layers, iron oxides occupy more volume than the metal and thus <b>flake</b> off, exposing fresh surfaces for corrosion.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium is a {{transuranic}} radioactive {{chemical element}} with symbol Pu and atomic number 94. It is an actinide metal of silvery-gray appearance that tarnishes {{when exposed to}} air, and forms a dull coating when oxidized. The element normally exhibits six allotropes and four oxidation states. It reacts with carbon, halogens, nitrogen, silicon and hydrogen. When exposed to moist air, it forms oxides and hydrides that can expand the sample up to 70% in volume, which in turn <b>flake</b> off as a powder that is pyrophoric. It is radioactive and can accumulate in bones, which makes the handling of plutonium dangerous.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the popcorn}} industry, a popped kernel of corn {{is known as}} a [...] "flake." [...] Two shapes of <b>flakes</b> are commercially important. [...] "Butterfly" [...] or [...] "snowflake" [...] <b>flakes</b> are {{irregular}} in shape and have a number of protruding [...] "wings". [...] "Mushroom" [...] <b>flakes</b> are largely ball-shaped, with few wings. Butterfly <b>flakes</b> are regarded as having better mouthfeel, with greater tenderness and less noticeable hulls. Mushroom <b>flakes</b> are less fragile than butterfly <b>flakes</b> and are therefore often used for packaged popcorn or confectionery, such as caramel corn. The kernels from a single cob of popcorn may form both butterfly and mushroom flakes; hybrids that produce 100% butterfly <b>flakes</b> or 100% mushroom <b>flakes</b> exist, the latter developed only as recently as 1998. Growing conditions and popping environment can also affect the butterfly-to-mushroom ratio.|$|R

5|$|There is no {{evidence}} that a prehistoric settlement occupied the site before the arrival of the Romans. However, Stone Age activity has been recorded in the area. Two Mesolithic flints and a flint <b>flake</b> as well as a Neolithic scraper have been discovered. A shard of late Bronze Age pottery has also been found in situ.

5|$|Etty {{had used}} {{experimental}} techniques to make The Sirens and Ulysses, using a strong glue as a paint stabiliser which caused the paint to dry hard and brittle, and to <b>flake</b> off once dry, a problem {{made worse by}} the painting's large size causing it to flex whenever it was moved. From the moment it was complete it began to deteriorate. After it was exhibited at the 1857 Art Treasures Exhibition it was considered in too poor a condition for public display, and it was placed in long-term storage in {{the archives of the}} Royal Manchester Institution and its successor, the Manchester Art Gallery. In the mid 20th century {{there were a number of}} unsuccessful attempts to repair The Sirens and Ulysses, but an attempt to clean the painting unintentionally damaged the paint further.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{entered the}} Americas through Beringia, and {{evidence}} documents {{their interactions with}} Columbian mammoths. Tools made from Columbian mammoth remains have been discovered in several North American sites. At Tocuila, Mexico, mammoth bones were quarried 13,000 years ago to produce lithic flakes and cores. At the Lange-Ferguson Site in South Dakota, the remains of two mammoths were found with two 12,800-year-old cleaver choppers made from a mammoth shoulder blade; the choppers {{had been used to}} butcher the mammoths. At the same site, a <b>flake</b> knife made from a long mammoth bone was also found wedged against mammoth vertebrae. At Murray Springs, archaeologists discovered a 13,100-year-old object made from a mammoth femur; the object is thought to be a shaft wrench, a tool for straightening wood and bone to make spear-shafts (the Inuit use similar tools).|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{photoluminescence}} study of single-layer MoS 2 <b>flakes</b> on SiO 2 surfaces. We {{demonstrate that the}} luminescence peak position of <b>flakes</b> prepared from natural MoS 2, which varies by up to 25 meV between individual as-prepared <b>flakes,</b> can be homogenized by annealing in vacuum, which removes adsorbates from the surface. We use HfO 2 and Al 2 O 3 layers prepared by atomic layer deposition to cover some of our <b>flakes.</b> We clearly observe a suppression of the low-energy luminescence peak observed for as-prepared <b>flakes</b> at low temperatures, indicating that this peak originates from excitons bound to surface adsorbates. We also observe different temperature-induced shifts of the luminescence peaks for the oxide-covered <b>flakes.</b> This effect stems from the different thermal expansion coefficients of the oxide layers and the MoS 2 <b>flakes.</b> It indicates that the single-layer MoS 2 <b>flakes</b> strongly adhere to the oxide layers and are therefore strained.

40|$|The {{coercivity}} of isotropic Dy-coated Nd-Fe-B <b>flakes</b> was {{enhanced by}} crystallization and simultaneous diffusion of Dy from their surfaces. Amorphous Dy-coated Nd-Fe-B <b>flakes</b> were crystallized by heating them to 923 K 2 over a 2 min period followed by rapid cooling. During crystallization, the Dy {{on the surface}} diffused into the <b>flakes.</b> This low-temperature rapid annealing produced <b>flakes</b> with fine grains and the Dy diffusion enhanced their coercivity. The coercivity after crystallization increased with increasing Dy layer thickness, although the remanence decreased when the layer thickness exceeded 3 μm. Thick coatings of over 6 μm resulted {{in the formation of}} DyFe 2, which degraded the magnetic properties of the crystallized <b>flakes.</b> <b>Flakes</b> with a 3 -μm-thick coating exhibited excellent magnetic properties after annealing: They had a coercivity of 1880 kA/m and a remanence of 78 emu/g.

5|$|In May 1843, Etty was one {{of eight}} artists chosen by Prince Albert to paint frescoes {{on the theme of}} Milton's Comus for a new {{pavilion}} being built in the grounds of Buckingham Palace. Etty was unhappy with his selection, as fresco was a medium with which he had no experience, but reluctantly did so, choosing to paint on the theme of Circe and the Sirens Three. The result was a disaster. Etty found himself unable to retouch or alter his existing work, as any freshly applied paint would <b>flake</b> away from the existing paint layer, and the lunette shape of the panel left Etty with a large empty space above the central figures. Etty's fresco was deemed unsalvageable, and although he offered to paint a replacement on the theme of Hesperus he was rejected, and William Dyce was commissioned to paint a replacement fresco. Etty was paid only a token £40 fee.|$|E
5|$|Marshmallow fluff, {{one of the}} {{two main}} {{ingredients}} of a Fluffernutter, was invented in the early 20th century. Archibald Query invented a creation he called Marshmallow Creme in Somerville, Massachusetts, in 1917, while Amory and Emma Curtis of Melrose, Massachusetts, invented Snowflake Marshmallow Creme in 1913. During World War I, Emma Curtis published a recipe for the Liberty Sandwich, which consisted of peanut butter and Snowflake Marshmallow Creme on oat or barley bread. The recipe was published in a promotional booklet sent to Curtis' customers in 1918 and may be the origin of the Fluffernutter sandwich. Earlier labels and booklets published by the Curtises suggested combining Snow <b>Flake</b> Marshmallow Creme with peanut butter or eating it on sandwiches with chopped nuts or olives.|$|E

5|$|During investigations, {{which usually}} take place before or in between trial sessions, the player gathers {{information}} and evidence {{by talking to}} characters such as their client, witnesses, and the police. The player is able to move around a cursor to examine various things in the environment. By using a menu, the player can move to different locations, examine evidence, and present evidence to other characters; by showing certain pieces of evidence to some witnesses, the player can get access to new information. In the game's fifth case, created for the DS version and used in all subsequent releases, the player is able to examine evidence more closely, rotating it to view it from all sides and zooming in or out on it using touchscreen controls; they are also able to move a cursor to investigate specific parts of the evidence. The fifth case also features forensics tests that the player can use at crime scenes to find clues: the player can spray luminol by tapping areas they want to examine on the touch screen, which makes the player able to see otherwise invisible blood stains; and they can touch the touch screen to apply aluminum <b>flake</b> powder in order to search for finger prints. After applying it, they can blow into the microphone to reveal the prints. Once the player has gathered enough evidence, the investigation section ends.|$|E
