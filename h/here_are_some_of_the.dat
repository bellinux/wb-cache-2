2500|$|Offenbach did {{not live}} to see his opera performed. He died on 5 October 1880, four months before its premiere, but after {{completing}} the piano score and orchestrating the prologue and first act. As a result, different editions of the opera soon emerged, some bearing {{little resemblance to the}} authentic work. The version performed at the opera's premiere was by Ernest Guiraud, who completed Offenbach's scoring and wrote recitatives. Over the years new editions have continued to appear, though the emphasis, particularly since the 1970s, has shifted to authenticity. In this regard a milestone was the Michael Kaye edition of 1992, but then additional authentic music was found and published in 1999. In 2011, two competing publishing houses – one French, one German – were to release a joint edition reflecting and reconciling the research of recent decades. <b>Here</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> edition [...] "variables" [...] that have been circulating since Offenbach died: ...|$|E
