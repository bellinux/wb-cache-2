The serpentine set includes a vertical serpentine deflection element and a horizontal serpentine deflection element. These deflection elements are identical and are interdigitatedly and orthogonally disposed relative to each other, for forming a central transmission passage, through which the electron beam passes and is deflected by the deflection field to minimize drift space signal distortion. The shielding frame includes a plurality of <b>ground</b> <b>blocks</b> and forms an internal serpentine trough within these <b>ground</b> <b>blocks</b> for housing the serpentine set.

5000|$|In 1856-57 an {{improvement}} over speculum mirrors was invented when Karl August von Steinheil and Léon Foucault introduced the process of depositing an ultra thin layer of silver on the front surface (first surface) of a <b>ground</b> <b>block</b> of glass. Silvered glass mirrors were a vast improvement since silver reflects 90 percent of the light that hits it and is much slower to tarnish than speculum. Silver coatings can also {{be removed from the}} glass, so a tarnished mirror could be resilvered without changing the delicate precision polished shape of the glass substrate. Glass is also more thermally stable than speculum metal, allowing it to hold its shape better through temperature changes. This marked the end of the speculum-mirror reflecting telescope, with the last large one, the Great Melbourne Telescope with its 122-cm (48-inch) mirror, being completed in 1867. The era of the large glass-mirror reflector had begun, with telescopes such as Andrew Ainslie Common's 1879 36 inch (91 cm) and 1887 60 inch (152 cm) reflectors built at Ealing, and the first of the [...] "modern" [...] large glass mirror research reflectors, 60 inch (150 cm) Mount Wilson Observatory Hale telescope of 1908, and the 100 inch (2.5 m) Mount Wilson Hooker telescope in 1917.|$|E

40|$|Cross wind {{analysis}} {{is one of}} the important safety measures for rail vehicle certification. The objective {{of this study is to}} identify which vehicle certification ground setup, true flat ground (TFG) or single track ballast and rail (STBR) represents a more realistic ground setup with atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) wind inlet and also to represent an embankment scenario. A streamlined high speed train ICE 3 and a conventional Regional train are taken for the analysis to represent both categories. CFD is used as a tool for calculations. The best practice recommended by the AeroTRAIN project is used for the CFD approach. The {{analysis is}} done for various configurations including STBR, TFG, embankments, ground roughness, moving ground, non-moving <b>ground,</b> <b>block</b> profile inlet, ABL inlet, model scale and full scale setups. The Regional train shows higher roll moment coefficient about lee rail (Cmx,lee) compared to the ICE 3 train, whereas the ICE 3 train has a higher lift force coefficient than the Regional train. STBR setup shows a higher force and moment coefficient compared to TFG. The STBR setup represents the more realistic setup of moving rough ground with ABL wind inlet and also the realistic embankment scenario...|$|E
40|$|Excess global {{elemental}} sulphur (So) production {{has resulted in}} a decrease in its price. As a result, many companies, such as Syncrude Canada Ltd., have resorted to above ground storage alternatives. Geochemical reactions in these above ground blocks produce elevated concentrations of H 2 SO 4 (acid). This acid can have potentially deleterious effects on the environment. As such, these blocks will require long-term (500 years) monitoring and maintenance. Presently the So is removed from the product stream, piped in a molten state, and poured over a low permeability liner in thin lifts. As the So cools and undergoes crystal structure change it fractures, creating preferential flow passages which are potentially highly conductive. An understanding of the liquid conductivity (Kl) of the block and knowledge regarding the spatial and temporal distribution of acid (H 2 SO 4) within these blocks is required. In this thesis, gas pumping tests were conducted on an above <b>ground</b> <b>block</b> to determine the gas flow rates within the block and to indirectly determine the Kl of the block. Measurements of the relative humidity (RH) in the block were used to observe changes in stored acid concentrations with time and location. The results of the gas conductivity (Kg) testing showed that the block is anisotropic and is highly conductive in both the horizontal and vertical directions. Cross hole tests appeared to produce the most representative estimates of Kg due to the negation of turbulence that arises {{in the vicinity of the}} borehole. The choice of gas used in the analysis had negligible effect on the resulting Kl in contrast to choice of liquid, which resulted in larger variations in Kl. The Kl was a maximum when the liquid was pure water and decreased with increasing acid strength. The geometric mean of the resulting cross hole Kl values was 2 x 10 - 3 m s- 1 (pure water). RH measurements were observed to fluctuate with depth and increased following precipitation. The resulting minimum pH observed within the block occurred at depths of 3 and 7 meters below the surface of the So block and increased with depth. The arithmetic mean pH value based on the daily averaged RH measurements was - 1. 7...|$|E
