40|$|OBJECTIVE: Previous {{studies have}} {{reported}} an overlap between gastroesophageal reflux symptoms, functional dyspepsia (FD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the prevalence of FD and IBS in gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and the effect on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). MATERIAL AND METHODS: FD and IBS prevalence and HRQoL were assessed by means of questionnaires in 215 referred and 48 non-referred (non-care-seeking) GERD patients, proven with 24 -h pH-metry. HRQoL in 131 matched controls was used for comparison. RESULTS: In this group of GERD patients 25 % had FD (Dutch general population 13 - 14 %), 35 % had IBS (Dutch general population 0. 6 - 6 %) and 5 % had both FD and IBS. Only 35 % had neither FD nor IBS. Among referred GERD patients, the prevalence of FD and IBS was higher (p= 0. 002 versus non-referred). Compared with controls, GERD patients without FD/IBS <b>had</b> <b>lower</b> HRQoL scores on only one of the nine SF- 36 subscales (p <or= 0. 001); GERD+FD patients <b>had</b> <b>lower</b> scores on six subscales (p <or= 0. 0005); GERD+IBS patients <b>had</b> <b>lower</b> scores on eight subscales (p < 0. 0005) and GERD+FD+IBS patients <b>had</b> <b>lower</b> scores on seven subscales (p <or= 0. 001). Compared with patients with GERD only, GERD+FD patients <b>had</b> <b>lower</b> scores on five subscales (p <or= 0. 001); GERD+IBS patients <b>had</b> <b>lower</b> scores on eight subscales (p < 0. 0005) and GERD+FD+IBS patients <b>had</b> <b>lower</b> scores on six subscales (p <or= 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with proven GERD, FD and IBS are more prevalent than in the general population. This prevalence is higher among care-seeking GERD patients. Only those GERD patients with concomitant FD/IBS <b>have</b> a much <b>lower</b> HRQoL. This suggests that in GERD, when properly treated, HRQoL is affected mainly by concomitant functional disorders and not by GERD itsel...|$|R

The city of New York determined that the cooling potential per area was highest for street trees, followed by living roofs, light covered surface, and open space planting.
