500|$|Well, <b>I</b> <b>{{actually}}</b> <b>had</b> the idea, I {{wrote the}} story {{about what it is}} actually like to be in the Service, and it does take a lot of physical strength, but now that I've been through it – and even just for the three days I was there, [...] a lot of mental strength. We used only Marines, no actors or actresses. We used all of the Marine's equipment and they were so lovely to us, I always have fun even though it's a lot of work. Even though I was sore and exhausted, I was so educated on people in the service, who I've always respected but the stuff they go through, and the kind of loyalty they possess, it's very communal, and community. Not to sound weird, but it seems like the heart of America. Seriously, the heart.|$|E
500|$|Media {{portrayals of}} Naomi Watts' and Laura Elena Harring's views of their onscreen {{relationships}} were varied and conflicting. Watts {{said of the}} filming of the scene, [...] "I don't see it as erotic, though maybe it plays that way. The last time I saw it, <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>had</b> {{tears in my eyes}} because I knew where the story was going. It broke my heart a little bit." [...] However, in another interview Watts stated, [...] "I was amazed how honest and real all this looks on screen. These girls look really in love and it was curiously erotic." [...] While Harring was quoted saying, [...] "The love scene just happened in my eyes. Rita's very grateful for the help Betty's given [...] so I'm saying goodbye and goodnight to her, thank you, {{from the bottom of my}} heart, I kiss her and then there's just an energy that takes us [...] Of course I have amnesia so I don't know if I've done it before, but I don't think we're really lesbians." [...] Heather Love agreed somewhat with Harring's perception when she stated that identity in Mulholland Drive is not as important as desire: [...] "who we are does not count for much—what matters instead is what we are about to do, what we want to do." ...|$|E
500|$|Film critic Aniruddha Guha of Daily News and Analysis {{described}} Mukerji's {{performance in}} the 2011 film No One Killed Jessica as [...] "one of her best performances till date". The film (co-starring Vidya Balan) was Mukerji's first commercial success since Ta Ra Rum Pum, and was especially noted for being a success {{despite the absence of}} a prominent male actor. The film was a semi-biographical thriller based on the Jessica Lal murder case in which Mukerji played the fictional character of Meera Gaity, a foul-mouthed television journalist who is deeply involved with the case. To promote the film, she reprised the role of Gaity on the C.I.D. television series. In an interview with The Telegraph she said, [...] "It was such a different role to portray. It wasn't a role that was typical of a Hindi film heroine. Meera was more like a hero. It was a character that actually took the story forward. [...] Meera made a lot of things happen. It wasn't something that I had ever done before. <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>had</b> to play a man!" [...] Certain critics, however, were critical of her performance, including Anupama Chopra of NDTV, who called her role, [...] "the fatal, false note in No One Killed Jessica," [...] arguing that [...] "the character is written superficially and Rani's portrayal of her is equally banal. It's all about externals. She argues a lot and proudly labels herself a bitch but her hair stays perfectly in place and in the end, she even gets to do a super-hero-like slow motion walk." [...] Nonetheless, the role earned her several awards and nominations, including a third Best Supporting Actress trophy at Filmfare.|$|E

Torvalds explains, In {{many ways}} you can just see git as a filesystem it's content-addressable, {{and it has a}} notion of versioning, but I really really designed it coming at the problem from the viewpoint of a filesystem person (hey, kernels is what I do), and <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>have</b> absolutely zero interest in creating a traditional SCM system.|$|R

We got along, and we were kind of friendly, and actually, after I met her the first time, she asked me if I wanted to be her band leader. But the Nazz had just signed a record contract and I couldn't skip out on the band, even though it was incredibly tempting." ...|$|E

So they’re the ones who actually approached me, would I like to write a fictionalized account of all the characters in Port Charles from Spinelli’s point of view. I don’t think <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>have</b> the imagination to pitch the idea to them. They came to me and it took off from there." ...|$|R
2500|$|Becker and Fagen {{began playing}} in local groups. One such group, {{known as the}} Don Fagen Jazz Trio, the Bad Rock Group and later the Leather Canary, {{included}} future comedy star Chevy Chase on drums. They played covers of songs by the Rolling Stones ("Dandelion"), Moby Grape ("Hey Grandma"), and Willie Dixon ("Spoonful"), {{as well as some}} original compositions. Terence Boylan, another Bard musician, remembered that Fagen took readily to the beatnik life while attending college: [...] "They never came out of their room, they stayed up all night. They looked like ghosts— black turtlenecks and skin so white that it looked like yogurt. Absolutely no activity, chain-smoking Lucky Strikes and dope." [...] Fagen himself would later remember it as [...] "probably the only time in my life that <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>had</b> friends." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November, Gillan {{revealed}} that the film was undergoing reshoots. That February, {{it was reported that}} the film had scored a perfect 100 in test screenings, the highest for any Marvel Studios film. The Hollywood Reporter noted this score could not necessarily be compared to any non-Marvel movies due to Marvel's specific testing process that selects its audience [...] "from a more select pool of recruits, what it terms 'friends and families screenings'". In March 2017, Gunn {{revealed that}} Michael Rosenbaum would appear in the film, and that Gunn would provide reference for Baby Groot's dancing [...] "in a much bigger way [...] <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>had</b> to do like a full day's worth of dancing to get Groot's dance down this time. Last time it was me in front of an iPhone, and this time it's me dancing on a huge soundstage and shooting it from five different angles." [...] Fred Raskin and Craig Wood returned from the first film to serve as editors. On scenes that were cut from the film, Gunn said Nathan Fillion, who had had a voice cameo in the first film, was going to appear as Simon Williams in a sequence that would have shown several movie posters for films starring Williams, including films in which he portrays Arkon and Tony Stark. Gunn chose Williams for Fillion's cameo because he wanted Fillion to have a bigger role in the MCU at some point and so didn't want to give him a role that could prevent him from taking a more substantial one later. Gunn still considered Fillion's cameo canon to the MCU, despite it being cut. He also confirmed that Close's scenes had been cut from the film, because it felt like he [...] "was trying to cram Nova Prime into the second movie as opposed to having it happen organically." ...|$|E

5000|$|The band {{once again}} {{produced}} {{themselves for the}} third album, Moth & Rust, released in 1999. According to the band, this record became more of a lyrical than musical an exploration. [...] "Previous CDs have been either therapy for the songwriter or fun lyrical meanderings. This... {{is the first time}} <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>have</b> a message toward the listener," [...] songwriter Stef Loy explained, [...] "Now I’m trying purposely to give the listener something to think about." [...] The albums' title and primary message were taken from Matthew 6:19-20. The album is themed on philosophical and spiritual points such as the decline of morality and absolutes, and hidden dangers in the American Dream.|$|R
2500|$|Bill Donohue, {{president}} of the Catholic League, in a critical review that appeared in 1996 wrote: [...] "If this sounds like nonsense, well, it is." [...] Though he admired Hitchens generally {{as a writer and}} [...] "provocateur", Donohue has said that Hitchens was [...] "totally overrated as a scholar ... sloppy in his research". Donohue released a book to coincide with Saint Teresa's canonization, entitled [...] "Unmasking Mother Teresa's Critics". In an interview, Donohue said, [...] "Unlike Hitchens, who wrote a 98-page book with no footnotes, no endnotes, no bibliography, no attribution at all, just 98 pages of unsupported opinion, I have a short book too. But <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>have</b> more footnotes than I have pages in the book. That’s because I want people to check my sources." ...|$|R

Another was afraid {{it was going to}} rain, and his umbrella had a hole in it. Everybody had an excuse.

[...] Moverman has maintained that everything in the 1980s portions actually happened based on conversations he had had with Ledbetter, with a few exceptions being some topics of conversation spoken by the character Wilson in the film - they derived from Moverman's research but were unknown to have happened in real life.|$|R
