50|$|Fresh thyme is {{commonly}} sold in bunches of sprigs. A sprig {{is a single}} stem snipped from the plant. It is composed of a woody stem with paired leaf or flower clusters ("leaves") spaced 1/2 to 1 in apart. A recipe may measure thyme by the bunch (or fraction thereof), or by the sprig, or by the tablespoon or teaspoon. <b>Dried</b> <b>thyme</b> is widely used in Armenia in tisanes (called urc).|$|E
50|$|Most {{regions in}} the Middle East use spices. Typically, a stew will include {{a small amount of}} cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, cumin, and coriander. Black pepper is common, and chili peppers are used occasionally, {{especially}} as a separate sauce or as a pickle. Parsley and mint are commonly used both in cooking and in salads. Thyme and thyme blends (za'atar) are common in Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Palestine, and a mixture of <b>dried</b> <b>thyme</b> and sumac (crushed sour berries) is a common breakfast item with oil and bread. Sumac is also sprinkled over grilled meat. Garlic is common to many dishes and salads.|$|E
5000|$|Za'atar (Arabic: زعتر [...] ), “thyme”, manaqish bi'l za'tar). The {{most popular}} form of manakish uses za'atar (ground <b>dried</b> <b>thyme,</b> oregano, {{marjoram}} {{or some combination}} thereof, mixed with toasted sesame seeds, salt, and other spices such as sumac) as a topping. The zaatar is mixed {{with olive oil and}} spread onto the dough before baking it in the oven. It is a favorite breakfast preparation in Levantine cuisine. It is also served by Levantine cooks as part of a mezze, or as a snack with a glass of mint tea and feta cheese on the side. Popular also in the Arabian Peninsula, it was likely introduced there by Palestinians making the pilgrimage to Mecca.|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to use the <b>dry</b> <b>thyme</b> leaves as source of nonhaeme iron and evaluate the effects of calcium, phosphorus and calcium + phosphorus on nonhaeme iron absorption and haematogenic characteristics in rats. Thirty adult male albino rats, weighing 150 ± 5 g were divided into five groups. The first group fed basal diet, the second group fed thyme diet, the third group fed thyme diet + calcium, the fourth group fed thyme diet + phosphorus and the fifth group fed thyme diet + calcium + phosphorus. All groups fed experimental diets for six weeks. Hemoglobin (Hb), haematocrit (Ht), red blood cell (RBC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), serum iron (SI), serum ferritin (SF), total iron–binding capacity and transferrin saturation were determined at the beginning and the at end of the experiment. Iron in diet, Fe intake, Fe feces and Fe absorption were also evaluated. The results indicated that the lowest Fe absorption was observed in rats fed the thyme diet + calcium and thyme diet + calcium + phosphorus. Supplementation the thyme diet with calcium or calcium + phosphorus decreased the values of Hb, Ht, RBC, SI and SF. However, supplementation the thyme diet with phosphorus did not affect in Ht, RBC and MCV but Hb, SI and SF increased. The results suggest that supplementation the diet with calcium or calcium + phosphorus interfere with iron absorption...|$|R
5000|$|Za'atar as a {{prepared}} condiment is generally made with ground <b>dried</b> <b>thyme,</b> oregano, marjoram, {{or some combination}} thereof, mixed with toasted sesame seeds, and salt, though other spices such as sumac might also be added. Some commercial varieties also include roasted flour. Traditionally, housewives throughout the Fertile Crescent, Iraq, and the Arabian peninsula made their own variations of za'atar, which was unknown in North Africa. In Morocco, za'atar mix consumption is sometimes seen as a trait of families with Andalusian roots, such as many inhabitants of Fez. Recipes for such spice mixtures were often kept secret, and not even shared with daughters and other relatives. This general practice is cited by Western observers of Middle Eastern and North African culinary cultures as one reason for their difficulties in determining {{the names of the}} different spices used.|$|E
40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} the effects of using thyme on iron and iron related hematological parameters elite athletes. The subject group of the research was composed of 12 male wrestlers who have competed in various age categories of Turkish National Team and who were still competent for the medal in Turkey Championships. The subjects, {{all of whom have}} been carrying out actively, for at least 2 months, their applicable exercises were subjected to the thyme loading session without any interference in their training sessions. Each person was offered after meals, three times a day for duration of 35 days total, thyme tea which had been brewed 1 gram <b>dried</b> <b>thyme</b> in boiled water of 150 cm 3 for ten minutes. Before and after the thyme loading period, blood samples were collected and analyzed the levels of Hemoglobin (HGB), Erythrocyte (RBC), Ferritin (F), Transferrin (T) Serum Iron (SI) and Iron Binding Capacity (IBC) was accomplished by means of the brand OLYPUS AU 640 hemacytometer. The amount of Transferrin Saturation (TS) was calculated using the formula, SI X 100 /IBC. In this study it was observed that the applicable levels were within, before and after thyme loading, the normal clinical values. However, a significant decrease, after 4 -week thyme loading, for the concentration levels of HGB, RBC and SI (p< 0. 05) and a significant increase for the level of IBC (p< 0. 01) were identified. As a result, it was observed that the thyme which has been known for its numerous benefits has, besides its positive effects, some adverse effects on the iron status in the sportsmen. Therefore, supplemental iron loading, coupled with giving beverages such as tea, green tea, thyme, etc. all containing catechin as active substance might be required for the performance sportsmen...|$|E

40|$|Background: Because of {{increasing}} resistance to current antibiotics, many {{attempts have been}} made by the researchers to find new compounds of plant derivatives as substitute for non-effective antibiotics. This research was performed to study the antibacterial properties of aquatic and alcoholic extracts of thyme on the clinical and standard strains of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli. Material and methods: After <b>drying,</b> the <b>thyme</b> leaves were added to ethanol 85 º and distilled water separately. Then the compounds of plant were extracted by distillation method. The antibacterial properties of extracts were investigated by tube dilution method in broth media. By using different concentrations of the extracts, MIC & MBC were determined and equal amounts of these concentrations were added to excavated wells in Mueller – Hinton agar. Then the mean diameter of growth inhibition zones for extracts and strains were compared. Results: Certain concentrations of the alcoholic extract showed significant antibacterial effect. Alcoholic extract with 0. 780 mg/ml showed growth inhibitory effect and bactericidal effect on strains, whereas the aquatic extract didn’t show any effect on the given strains. Conclusion: Some of the concentrations of the alcoholic extract showed pronounced antibacterial activity on the strains of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli but it is necessary to do more studies on its antibacterial effects...|$|R
