Black numerals are {{displayed}} on a plain white shield, usually with a black border {{near the edge of}} the sign, although this differs from sign to sign, especially on highway overheads. Single- and double-digit state highway numbers are posted on standard square sign panels, while three-digit (and three- and four-character alternate such as 28A) numbers are displayed on <b>elongated</b> <b>panels.</b> State route shields on freeways, such as Route 24 and Route 128 have the same design, but are usually much larger in size for easier viewing at highway speeds.|$|R
