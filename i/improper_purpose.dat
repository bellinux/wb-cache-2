5|$|A further {{example of}} an {{executive}} decision invalidated by <b>improper</b> <b>purpose</b> {{can be seen from}} Congreve v. Home Office (1976). In that case, the Home Secretary, who had the power to revoke television licences, purported to revoke the licences of people who had pre-empted a rise in licence fees by buying a licence at the old rate before the date when the fees were due to go up, even though their old licences had not yet expired. The court held that this was an improper exercise of the Home Secretary's discretionary powers. His power to revoke could not be used to raise revenue, and therefore this power had been used for the wrong purpose.|$|E
5|$|In cases falling {{under the}} second sub-heading, a public {{authority}} has satisfied all the factual and legal conditions required for exercising a statutory power conferred upon it, but nevertheless may have acted illegally {{by doing so}} in a manner contrary to administrative law rules. The grounds of review available under this heading include the authority acting in bad faith, acting {{on the basis of}} no evidence or insufficient evidence, making an error of material fact, failing to take into account relevant considerations or taking into account irrelevant ones, acting for an <b>improper</b> <b>purpose,</b> fettering one's discretion, and not fulfilling a person's substantive legitimate expectations.|$|E

25|$|Conceptually, {{taking an}} {{irrelevant}} consideration {{into account in}} a decision may be equivalent to deciding for an <b>improper</b> <b>purpose.</b> In Hanks v.

25|$|The {{ground of}} failing {{to take into account}} {{relevant}} considerations and taking into account irrelevant ones may overlap with other grounds of judicial review such as deciding for an <b>improper</b> <b>purpose</b> and irrationality.

25|$|In Singapore, a broad {{approach}} has been taken towards the determination of whether a decision-maker has exercised its power for an <b>improper</b> <b>purpose.</b> In Public Prosecutor v. Pillay M.M. (1977), the respondent was charged for having driven his car into a restricted zone established under the Singapore Area Licensing Scheme without having paid the requisite fee for doing so, contrary to the Motor Vehicles (Restricted Zone and Area Licences) Rules 1975 which had been issued by the Minister for Communications pursuant to the Road Traffic Act. The respondent argued that the Rules were invalid as the Act only empowered the Minister to make rules to regulate road traffic, and not to collect fees. The High Court held that the Minister had not exceeded the statutory power given {{to him as the}} main purpose of the rules he had imposed was consistent with the objective of the Act, that is, to regulate traffic on the roads. Collecting fees from drivers entering the restricted zone was merely incidental to this purpose. Hence, in Singapore it appears that a decision-maker does not act unlawfully if it exercises a statutory power for a purpose that is incidental to the legislative purpose.|$|E

He also argued that since the Minister and the President, acting on advice of the Cabinet, had acted in bad faith and for <b>improper</b> <b>purposes,</b> they had acted {{outside the scope of}} the powers conferred by the ISA. Hence, the acts and decisions were null and void.|$|R

25|$|The {{basic duty}} of the {{receiver}} was to realise value for the floating charge holder, although all preferential debts, or those with priority, {{would have to be}} paid. For other unsecured creditors, the possibility of recovering money was remote. The floating owed no duty to other creditors with regard to the timing of the appointment of a receiver, even if it could have an effect on negotiations for refinancing the business. It was accepted that a receiver had a duty to act only for the proper purpose of realising debts, and not for some ulterior motive. In Downsview Nominees Ltd v First City Corp Ltd, a company had given floating charges to two banks (Westpac first, and First City Corp second). The directors, wishing to install a friendly figure in control asked Westpac to assign its floating charge to their friend Mr Russell, who proceeded to run the business with further losses of $500,000, and refused to pass control to First City Corp, even though they offered the company discharge of all the money owed under the first debenture. The Privy Council advised that Mr Russell, as administrative receiver, had acted for an <b>improper</b> <b>purpose</b> by refusing this deal. A further case of breach of duty occurred in Medforth v Blake where the administrative receiver of a pig farm ignored the former owner's advice on how to get discounts on pig food of £1000 a week. As a result, larger debts were run up. Sir Richard Scott VC held this was a breach of an equitable duty of exercising due diligence. However, a more general duty to creditors was tightly constrained, and general liability for professional negligence was denied to exist. In Silven Properties Ltd v Royal Bank of Scotland a receiver of a property business failed to apply for planning permission on houses that could have significantly raised their value, and did not find tenants for the vacant properties, before selling them. It was alleged that the sales were at an undervalue, but the Court of Appeal held that the receiver's power of sale was exercisable without incurring any undue expense. Everything was subordinate to the duty to the receiver to realise a good price. In this respect, an administrator is not capable of disregarding other creditors, at least in law. One {{of the reasons for the}} partial abolition of administrative receivership was that after the receiver had performed his task of realising assets for the floating charge holder, very little value was left in the company for other creditors because it appeared to have fewer incentives to efficiently balance all creditors' interests. Ordinarily, once the receiver's work was done, the company would go into liquidation.|$|E
500|$|A UK case {{in which}} <b>improper</b> <b>purpose</b> as a ground of {{judicial}} review was considered was Wheeler v. Leicester City Council (1985). Leicester City Council banned a rugby club, Leicester Football Club, from using one of its recreation grounds because some members of the club had taken part in a tournament in South Africa. At that time, the Government of South Africa practised apartheid, and the Council had a policy not to support this. However, the club members who travelled to South Africa, while not agreeing with apartheid, believed that the social barriers created by apartheid could be broken down by maintaining sporting links with the country. The club members had not acted unlawfully by choosing to participate in the tournament, and neither had the club by permitting them to do so. Lord Templeman said that: ...|$|E

25|$|Administrative law is {{the area}} of law {{concerning}} the control of powers exercised by the government. It functions to regulate decision-making processes by public authorities with regard to maintaining basic standards of fairness and legality. Administrative law in Singapore originates from and shares many similarities with administrative law in the United Kingdom. In general, claims for judicial review in administrative law fall under three broad categories– illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety. Instances of illegality fall under two main headings: whether the authority was empowered {{to make the decision}} in question, and whether it properly exercised its discretion to make that decision. Grounds for illegality under the first heading include simple ultra vires, and errors as to precedent facts. The second heading includes grounds of judicial review such as making decisions on the basis of insufficient evidence or errors of material fact, failing to take into account relevant considerations and taking into account irrelevant ones, making decisions for <b>improper</b> <b>purposes,</b> fettering of discretion, and failing to fulfil legitimate expectations.|$|R
