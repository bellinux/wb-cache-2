40|$|Through the {{institute}} of public procurement a considerable volume of financial resources is allocated. It is therefore in the interest <b>of</b> <b>contracting</b> entities to seek ways of how to achieve an efficient allocation of resources. Some public contract-awarding entities, along with some public-administration authorities in the Czech Republic, believe {{that the use of}} a single evaluation criterion (the lowest bid price) results in a more efficient tender for a public contract. It was found that contracting entities in the Czech Republic strongly prefer to use the lowest bid price criterion. Within the examined sample, 86. 5 % of public procurements were evaluated this way. The analysis of the examined sample <b>of</b> public <b>contracts</b> proved that the choice of an evaluation criterion, even the preference of the lowest bid price criterion, does not have any obvious impact on the final cost <b>of</b> a public <b>contract.</b> The study concludes that it is inappropriate to prefer the criterion of the lowest bid price within the evaluation <b>of</b> public <b>contracts</b> that are characterised by their complexity (including public contracts for construction works and public service <b>contracts).</b> The findings <b>of</b> the Supreme Audit Office related to the <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> public <b>contracts</b> indicate that when using the lowest bid price as an evaluation criterion, a public contract may indeed be tendered with the lowest bid price, but not necessarily the best offer in terms of supplied quality. It is therefore not appropriate to use the lowest bid price evaluation criterion to such an extent for the purpose of evaluating work and services. Any improvement to this situation requires a corresponding amendment to the Law on Public Contracts and mainly a radical change in the attitude of the Office for the Protection of Competition towards proposed changes, as indicated within the conclusions and recommendations proposed by this study...|$|R

Furthermore, the buyer also should check the mortgages records and the maritime lien records to prevent any damages or loss subject to the legal issue of the ship which occurred before the delivery of the ship.

5000|$|The [...] "Dual Policy" [...] and [...] "native policy" [...] both {{required}} {{the creation and}} maintenance of resources for African development. The Report said that this {{should be the first}} duty of the government of each territory: only after this should any surplus be used to promote immigrant enterprises. The Commissioners considered that the first requirement was for indigenous communities to have sufficient land to maintain a reasonable living standard using traditional agriculture methods. This land should be reserved for the African population and protected from encroachment by immigrants. They also thought it was necessary to deal with land tenure, and anticipated a change from communal landholding to individual tenure. The Commission also considered labour issues, demanding a limit on the recruitment of more than a fixed percentage if workers as migrant labour and insisting on the <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> work <b>contracts</b> and conditions. After considering the need to promote African development, the Commission reviewed the options for federation or closer union. It rejected any idea of an immediate formal federation in favour of increased regional co-operation. The Report envisaged the creation of a Central Executive Authority who would at first be a High Commissioner relying on existing administrative structures and later a Governor-General supported by an administrative Secretariat. This Central Authority would exercise a more effective supervisory and co-ordinating control on policy matters than was possible from London. The Commissioners emphasised the success of their recommendations depended on the relaxation of Colonial Office control of local legislatures, although Colonial Office officials would still set-out the main lines of policy. They proposed an initial period in which Kenya, Uganda and Tanganyika would co-operate, using the existing East African Governors’ Conference (which had been formed in 1926) and its secretariat to advise the Central Authority. In a second stage, representatives from Zanzibar, Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia would join and the Governor-General’s Secretariat would be strengthened. The Commission suggested that the local legislatures would remain and that no central legislature would be created.|$|R
