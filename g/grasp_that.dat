500|$|Secord's {{criticism}} {{may have}} been a little extreme. The Department of Defense had created the 7th/13 Air Force at Udon in November 1965 {{for the express purpose of}} conducting the air war in Laos. According to historian Timothy Castle, Sullivan relegated the Air Force commander and his staff [...] "to the status of clerks hired to carry out his airpower decisions." [...] The unconventional arrangement bred frustration and the 7th/13th constantly harped about the use of its air assets in northern Laos. There was constant criticism over the use of air power [...] "serving targets" [...] or utilizing modern fighter-bombers as [...] "long-range artillery." [...] It was very difficult for the Air Force to <b>grasp</b> <b>that</b> a guerrilla force did not fight like a conventional army.|$|E
500|$|Brand {{had been}} told by the Jewish Agency by return cable that [...] "Chaim" [...] would meet him in Istanbul. Convinced of the {{importance}} of his mission, he believed this was Chaim Weizmann, president of the World Zionist Organization, later the first president of Israel. In fact the man who had arranged to meet him was Chaim Barlas, head of the Istanbul group of Zionist emissaries. Not only was Barlas not there, but there was no entry visa waiting for Brand, and he was threatened with arrest and deportation. Brand saw this as the first betrayal by the Jewish Agency. Bauer argues that Brand, then and later, failed to <b>grasp</b> <b>that</b> the Jewish Agency was powerless. That his passport was in the name of Eugen Band would have been enough to cause the confusion.|$|E
500|$|Scholars have {{differed}} on {{the issue}} of what is to be made of Mr. Dooley and the often bizarre things Dunne placed in his mouth: whether Dooley is intended to believe that he is a cousin of Admiral Dewey, or that [...] "Mack" [...] (as he calls President McKinley) has actually said the seemingly unlikely things that the barkeeper relates. Walter Blair, in his 1942 volume on American humor, considered Mr. Dooley too much of a provincial innocent to <b>grasp</b> <b>that</b> referring to the president so familiarly might be a [...] Many Dooley pieces commence [...] "I see by the papers", that is, the newspapers Dooley subscribes to for his customers to read and which the bartender peruses at slack times, constituting a major source of information for him. Blair contended that Dooley knows only what he reads in the Evening Post and other papers, and gullibly believes quotations he has heard without attribution from his customer Hogan were made up by that bookish patron. Dunne wrote in 1898 that Dooley [...] "reads the newspapers with solemn care, heartily hates them, and accepts all they print for the sake of drowning Hennessy's rising protests against his logic".|$|E

500|$|Stephen Holden of The New York Times {{referred}} to the film as [...] "Alternately gripping and laughable" [...] and that [...] "The scenes of gore and destruction are even more spectacular than Hong Kong's fog-shrouded skyline". Variety gave a positive review, describing the film as an [...] "extremely violent and superbly made actioner demonstrates the tight <b>grasp</b> <b>that</b> director John Woo has on the crime meller genre". Kathleen Maher of The Austin Chronicle praised the film stating that it [...] "defies all categorization but demands comparisons, if only to prove that there's never been anything like this before." [...] Hal Hinson of The Washington Post wrote a positive review, describing the film as [...] "like eating popcorn, but it's not just any old brand; it's escape-velocity popcorn, popcorn with a slurp of rocket fuel... ideas overreach themselves with such a virile swagger that they border on comedy. With excess like this you can't help but laugh. This is a rush of a movie". The Christian Science Monitor gave the film a mixed review, stating that [...] "This violent Hong Kong thriller has more psychological depth than most of its kind, but ultimately seems like a pointless exercise in style".|$|E
500|$|Borscht is {{associated}} with and claimed by several ethnic groups, especially Ukrainians, Russians, Poles, Lithuanians and Ashkenazi Jews, as their own national or ethnic dish and cultural icon. Such claims are not necessarily mutually exclusive, as the soup's history predates the emergence in Eastern Europe of modern nation states with their ever-shifting borders. Borscht, {{in the words of}} Burlakoff, [...] "is perfectly suited to a global culture." [...] He describes it as [...] "a global phenomenon", in which [...] "local variants are so numerous and diverse that it is hard sometimes for a non-specialist to <b>grasp</b> <b>that</b> any single example of it is something that is part of a unified tradition." [...] In his view, borscht [...] "is an almost perfect example of... 'glocalization' – a phenomenon that is global in distribution but reflective of local needs and ways in its variants and adaptation;... a highly localized product that became globalized, and in the process adapted to conditions other than the original ones." [...] However, according to Irina Perianova, a Russian linguist and anthropologist, [...] "people tend to be very proprietal about their food and proud of it." [...] Perianova offers competing Russian and Ukrainian views on the origin and ingredients of borscht as an example of [...] "a common connection between culinary and territorial claims", which results in the culinary area turning into [...] "a battlefield generating and proliferating all kinds of myths." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{many books}} and {{articles}} produced by the Workmans are [...] "still useful" [...] according to Mason, especially for their photographs and illustrations, but their maps are [...] "deceptive and not always reliable". One assessment states that although the Workmans excelled at describing meteorological conditions, glaciology, and how high altitudes affected human health and fitness, they were poor topographers. [...] The Workmans {{were some of the}} first mountaineers to <b>grasp</b> <b>that</b> the Himalaya were the place for the ultimate climbing challenge and their explorations helped evolve mountaineering from strenuous recreation into a serious, regulated competitive sport. According to Isserman, Weaver and Molenaar, [...] "that the Workmans were intrepid explorers and climbers none could possibly doubt, but they were also aggressive self-promoters who in their eagerness for recognition and honors sometimes exaggerated the originality and significance of what they had done." [...] In their final assessment, Isserman, Weaver and Molenaar say [...] "they had logged more miles and climbed more peaks than anyone to date; they had produced five sumptuously illustrated and widely read expedition volumes; and by simple virtue of her sex Fanny of course had set an invaluable Himalayan precedent. But the Workmans were not great mountaineers. At their best they were vigorous and competent patrons who followed capably in the hard-won steps of their Italian guides." [...] However, in his chapter on Workman, Pauly writes that [...] "the few recent accounts of Fanny Workman have tended to slight or belittle her achievements, but contemporaries, unaware of the far greater accomplishments to come, held the Workmans in high regard." [...] They were the first Americans to explore the Himalaya in depth and break the British monopoly over Himalayan mountaineering.|$|E

Montgomery bitterly resented this change, although it had been agreed before the D-Day invasion. The British journalist Mark Urban writes that Montgomery seemed unable to <b>grasp</b> <b>that</b> as {{the majority of the}} 2.2 million Allied soldiers fighting against Germany on the Western Front were now American (the ratio was 3:1) that it was politically unacceptable to American public opinion to have Montgomery remain as Land Forces Commander as: [...] "Politics would not allow him to carry on giving orders to great armies of Americans simply because, in his view, he was better than their generals".|$|E

No one could understand that. I don't think guys in the locker room could <b>grasp</b> <b>that</b> he wanted to be to himself – you know, quiet. If you didn't understand him and didn't know what he was about, it always kept people in suspense."

In an interview with Sweater, Björk said: [...] "It amazes me that people still can't <b>grasp</b> <b>that</b> live element of it." [...] Regarding {{the beat of the}} song, engineer Markus Dravs stated it [...] "is very much a Mark Bell beat interpretation of her. The idea of it being a Boleric beat was hers, but we tried different versions and I think it was Mark in the end {{who came up with the}} idea of just doing it on a 909. Then we all had a go on the filtering and played around with the decay of each individual drum." ...|$|E
2500|$|Military {{historian}} John Bourne {{wrote that}} this was not the case. Haig, although not familiar with technological advances, encouraged their use. He also rejected claims that Haig was a traditionalist and focused only on cavalry tactics. Cavalry represented less than three percent of the BEF in France by September 1916, whilst the British were the most mechanised force in the world by 1918, supported by the world's largest air force. The Tank Corps was the world's first such force and some 22,000 men served in it during the war. The Royal Artillery grew by 520 percent and the engineers who implemented combined arms tactics grew by 2,212 percent. Bourne wrote that this hardly demonstrates a lack of imagination. Other historians, notably John Keegan, refused to accept that the British Army underwent a 'learning curve' of any sort; despite this example, Bourne wrote that there [...] "is little disagreement among scholars {{about the nature of the}} military transformation". Popular [...] "media opinion" [...] had failed to <b>grasp</b> <b>that</b> under Haig, the British Army adopted a very modern style of war in 1918, something that was very different from 1914, 1916 and 1917.|$|E

2500|$|By doing this, Hegelian critics accuse Kierkegaard {{of using}} the {{dialectic}} to disprove the dialectic, which seems somewhat contradictory and hypocritical. However, Kierkegaard would not claim the dialectic itself is bad, only the Hegelian premise that the dialectic {{would lead to a}} harmonious reconciliation of everything, which Hegel called the Absolute. Kierkegaard stated this most clearly in his book The Concept of Anxiety, Dogmatics must not explain hereditary sin but rather explain it by presupposing it, like that vortex about which Greek speculation concerning nature had so much to say, a moving something that no science can <b>grasp.</b> <b>That</b> such is the case with dogmatics will readily be granted if once again time is taken to understand Schleiermacher’s immortal service to this science. He was left behind long ago when men chose Hegel. Yet Schleiermacher was a thinker in the beautiful Greek sense, a thinker who spoke only of what he knew. Hegel, on the contrary, despite all his outstanding ability and stupendous learning, reminds us again and again by his performance {{that he was in the}} German sense a professor of philosophy on a large scale, because he a tout prix [...] must explain all things.

2500|$|Okereke responded {{critically}} to {{comments made}} by Liam and Noel Gallagher of Oasis in early 2007. Liam called Bloc Party [...] "A band off of University Challenge", while Noel dismissed them as [...] "indie shit". In retaliation, Okereke stated, [...] "I think Oasis are the most overrated and pernicious band of all time. They had a totally negative and dangerous impact upon the state of British music. They have made stupidity hip. They claim to be inspired by The Beatles but, and this saddens me, they have failed to <b>grasp</b> <b>that</b> The Beatles were about constant change and evolution. Oasis are repetitive Luddites." [...] Ironically, when Oasis cancelled their headlining set at the Rock-en-Seine festival near Paris in August 2009 (the concert where the Gallagher brothers clashed backstage, which resulted in Oasis splitting up), it was Okereke who announced to the crowd that Oasis had cancelled their slot during Bloc Party's set, sarcastically declaring the breakup to be a shame. He dedicated their track [...] "Mercury" [...] to the Oasis fans [...] "who really, really wanted to see those inbred twins," [...] referring to the Gallagher brothers after announcing to the crowd [...] "so I guess by default, we are headlining!" ...|$|E
2500|$|John – {{the illicit}} {{son of the}} Director and Linda, born and reared on the Savage Reservation ("Malpais") after Linda was unwittingly left behind by her errant lover. John ("the Savage", as he is often called) is an {{outsider}} both on the Reservation—where the natives still practice marriage, natural birth, family life and religion—and the ostensibly civilised World State, based on principles of stability and shallow happiness. He has read nothing but the complete works of William Shakespeare, which he quotes extensively, and, for the most part, aptly, though his allusion to the [...] "Brave New World" [...] (Miranda's words in The Tempest) takes on a darker and bitterly ironic resonance as the novel unfolds. John is intensely moral according to a code {{that he has been}} taught by Shakespeare and life in Malpais but is also naïve: his views are as imported into his own consciousness as are the hypnopedic messages of World State citizens. The admonishments of the men of Malpais taught him to regard his mother as a whore; but he cannot <b>grasp</b> <b>that</b> these were the same men who continually sought her out despite their supposedly sacred pledges of monogamy. Because he is unwanted in Malpais, he accepts the invitation to travel back to London and is initially astonished by the comforts of the World State. However, he remains committed to values that exist only in his poetry. He first spurns Lenina for failing {{to live up to his}} Shakespearean ideal and then the entire utopian society: he asserts that its technological wonders and consumerism are poor substitutes for individual freedom, human dignity and personal integrity. After his mother's death, he becomes deeply distressed with grief, surprising onlookers in the hospital. He then ostracizes himself from society and attempts to purify himself of [...] "sin" [...] (desire), but is finally unable to do so and hangs himself in despair.|$|E

Taking into account these properties, we propose a method for generating such a variety of good <b>grasps</b> <b>that</b> {{can be used for}} the accomplishment of many different tasks. Grasp synthesis is formulated as a single constrained optimization problem, generating <b>grasps</b> <b>that</b> are feasible for the hand’s kinematics by minimizing the norm of the joint torque vector of the hand ensuring grasp stability.

The modular approach to robotic grasping aims to understand human grasping behavior in order to replicate grasping and skilled in-hand movements with an artificial hand using simple, robust, and flexible modules. In this work, the design of modular grasping devices capable of adapting to different requirements and situations is investigated. A novel algorithm that determines effective modular configurations to get efficient grasps of given objects is presented. The resulting modular configurations are able to perform effective <b>grasps</b> <b>that</b> a human would consider “stable”. Related simulations were carried out to validate {{the efficiency of the}} algorithm. Preliminary results show the versatility of the modular approach in designing grippers...|$|R
