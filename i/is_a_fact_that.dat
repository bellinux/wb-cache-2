5|$|Gernot Wilhelm saw no {{ground for}} Richter's {{assumption}} concerning {{the identification of}} the Nuhaššite monarch with the Qaṭanean king. This identification rests on the theory that Qatna belonged geographically to the region of Nuhašše, but no solid evidence supports this assumption, and the Shattiwaza treaty between the Hittites and Mitannians clearly mentioned Qatna as a different realm from Nuhašše during the first Syrian war when the Nuhaššite king ruled. If Qatna was part of the Nuhaššite kingdom, its submission to the Hittites would not have been mentioned separately in the treaty. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Qatna was ruled by Idanda during the first war and the Hittite documents do not mention a change of rulers in Qatna made by Šuppiluliuma, leaving no reason to suspect that Idanda ascended the throne {{as a result of the}} war. Jacques Freu likewise rejected Richter's hypothesis. Citing different arguments, he concluded that Adad-Nirari of Nuhašše was a contemporary of Idanda, the successor of the Qaṭanean Adad-Nirari.|$|E

Indeed, the random detection of lung cancer in the early stage (stage 1) in the x-ray image is difficult.

25|$|Since {{we started}} from an {{arbitrary}} partition {{and ended up}} {{as close as we}} wanted to either zero or one, it is false to say that we are eventually trapped near some number , so this function is not Riemann integrable. However, it is Lebesgue integrable. In the Lebesgue sense its integral is zero, since the function is zero almost everywhere. But this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> is {{beyond the reach of the}} Riemann integral.|$|E

25|$|New New Trade Theory {{analyses}} individual {{enterprises and}} plants {{in an international}} competitive situation. The classical trade theory—i.e., the Heckscher–Ohlin model—has no enterprises in mind. The new trade theory treats enterprises in an industry as identical entities. New New Trade Theory gives focus on the diversity of enterprises. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> some enterprises engage in export and some that do not. Some enterprises invest directly in the foreign country {{in order to produce}} and sell in that country. Some other enterprises engage only in export. Why does this kind of differences occur? New New Trade Theory tries to find out the reasons of these well observed facts.|$|E
25|$|Bicycle {{historian}} David V. Herlihy {{documents that}} Lallement {{claimed to have}} created the pedal bicycle in Paris in 1863. He had seen someone riding a draisine in 1862 then originally {{came up with the}} idea to add pedals to it. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> he filed the earliest and only patent for a pedal-driven bicycle, in the US in 1866. Lallement's patent drawing shows a machine which looks exactly like Johnson's draisine, but with the pedals and rotary cranks attached to the front wheel hub, and a thin piece of iron over the top of the frame to act as a spring supporting the seat, for a slightly more comfortable ride.|$|E
25|$|The {{term was}} invented by Peter Stephen Du Ponceau, who {{considered}} polysynthesis, as characterized by sentence words and noun incorporation, {{a defining feature of}} all Native American languages. This characterization was shown to be wrong, since many indigenous American languages are not polysynthetic, but it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> polysynthetic languages are not evenly distributed throughout the world, but more frequent in the Americas, Australia, Siberia, and New Guinea; however, there are also examples in other areas. The concept became part of linguistic typology with the work of Edward Sapir, who used it as one of his basic typological categories. Recently, Mark C. Baker has suggested formally defining polysynthesis as a macro-parameter within Noam Chomsky's principles and parameters theory of grammar. Other linguists question the basic utility of the concept for typology since it covers many separate morphological types that have little else in common.|$|E

25|$|Foster, who {{is known}} by the Essex fans as Fozzy, is often {{regarded}} as the best wicket keeper in the game. In July 2011 Alec Stewart described him as the best pure wicket-keeper in the world. This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> is underlined by his ability {{to stand up to}} the stumps to many quick bowlers with consistency and excellence, and for his athleticism standing back. However, he has been overlooked by England selectors as a possible result of perceived mediocre batting, with Matt Prior, Steven Davies and Jos Buttler being preferred. Foster's batting is reliant on cuts, pulls and sweeps. In all forms of cricket, Foster uses the reverse sweep effectively. Foster usually bats at seven for Essex in all forms. He once hit 5 sixes off of the first five balls of a Scott Borthwick over vs Durham in a Pro40, but missed out on the elusive sixth when Borthwick bowled a leg-side wide.|$|E
25|$|According to an {{inscription}} {{found in the}} Santa Cruz church, its consecration took place in year 738 and was presided by a vates called Asterio. The word vates is uncommon in Catholic documents and epitaphs, where the word presbyterus (for Christian priests) is preferred. On the other hand, vates was used in Latin to denote a poet with clairvoyance powers {{and according to the}} Ancient Greek writers Strabo, Diodorus Siculus, and Posidonius, the vates (ουατεις) were also one of three classes of Celtic priesthood, the other two being the druids and the bards. Some historians think that Asterio held a religious office which combined elements of the pagan and Christian religions, while others think he may be linked to the Brythonic refugees that settled in Britonia (Galicia) in the 6th century: The Parrochiale Suevorum (an administrative document of the Kingdom of the Suebi) tells that the lands of Asturias belonged to the Britonian see, and it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> some features of the Celtic Christianity penetrated in Northern Spain, like the Celtic tonsure which was condemned by the Visigoth bishops who assisted to the Fourth Council of Toledo.|$|E
25|$|Minna also {{obtained}} {{a position at}} the Riga theater, and they lived in Riga for two years until Wagner lost his post in January 1839. He then decided on a wild scheme to evade his creditors: He and Minna together with their dog Robber would flee across the nearby Russian border and board a ship bound for London and then travel on to Paris, where Wagner expected that his new opera Rienzi would make his fortune. Minna made her last stage appearance in Riga on April 18 {{in the title role}} of Schiller's Maria Stuart. It was her income from this appearance that paid for their flight from Riga to London and Paris. On July 10, they made the illegal border crossing safely, despite the risk of being shot by border guards, but on 14 July they were in a wagon which overturned, crushing Minna. Nathalie later claimed that Minna suffered a miscarriage as a result. While there is no other evidence for this claim, it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Minna bore Wagner no children. Minna and Wagner set sail from Pillau on the Thetis and ran into a storm which led them to berth in a Norwegian fjord. They only arrived in London after a terrifying 24-day journey for a trip that should normally have taken 8 days. After a week recovering in London, they took a steamer to Paris.|$|E

It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the singular n-simplices of X whose images {{are contained in}} either A or B generate all of the homology group H'n(X). In other words, H'n(A + B) is isomorphic to H'n(X). This gives the Mayer–Vietoris sequence for singular homology.|$|E
500|$|Although {{both were}} {{committed}} O.T.O. members, Northrup's usurpation of Helen's role led to {{conflict between the}} two sisters. The reactions of Parsons and Helen towards Northrup were markedly different. Parsons told Helen to her face that he preferred Northrup sexually: [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> I can do nothing about. I am better suited to her temperamentally – we get on well. Your character is superior. You are a greater person. I doubt that she would face what you have with me – or support me as well." [...] Some years later, addressing himself as [...] "You", Parsons told himself that his affair with Northrup (whom he called Betty) marked a key step in his growth as a practitioner of magick: [...] "Betty served to affect a transference from Helen at a critical period ... Your passion for Betty also gave you the magical force needed at the time, and the act of adultery tinged with incest, served as your magical confirmation in the law of Thelema." ...|$|E

5000|$|However, Peter Fahy, {{spokesman}} of race {{issues for}} the Association of Chief Police Officers, noted that the media as a whole tended to under-report the racist murders of white people, stating [...] "it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> harder to get the media interested where murder victims were young white men".|$|R

[...] The swing bridge sitting right in the middle of the channel was severe hazard.

2500|$|The Tea House, {{also known}} as the [...] "Tea Haus," [...] because its façade evokes German {{architectural}} [...] motifs, was originally a gazebo built by the Lawrence family on a small rock hill on the north lawn of their estate. After being saved by a student petition from a demolition that was called for by architect Philip Johnson in 1960, it was converted to an enclosed building with large windows and a fireplace that now houses a café selling a variety of teas and baked goods. While it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the building housed the office of history faculty member Charles Trinkaus from the 1950s through 1970, {{there seems to be no}} evidence to support the persistent campus rumor that the Tea House was once the office of long-time faculty member Joseph Campbell.|$|E
