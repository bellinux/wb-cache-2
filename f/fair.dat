Critics had typically questioned whether art fairs with narrow geographic scope like 1:54 highlight or ostracize minority artists. A gallery owner from Seattle saw the <b>fair</b> as a route for further integration into larger markets. Artnet Davis expressed distaste at the art <b>fair</b> trend of lumping artists by their geographic region and generalizing trends based on its parts, but nonetheless considered important 1:54's representation of Africa. Critics initially noted the fair's lack of African gallery representation, but cited justification including the African art scene's nascent state and the continent's history of political instability, which affects both overseas trade and gallery security. At the 2015 New York show, reviewers noted elements including the predominantly white gallery exhibition staff and the marquee display of a popular artist at a <b>fair</b> for marginal artists.|$|E

40|$|In {{the process}} of curves and {{surfaces}} <b>fairing</b> with multiresolution analysis, <b>fairing</b> accuracy {{will be determined by}} final <b>fairing</b> scale. On the basis of Dyadic wavelet <b>fairing</b> algorithm (DWFA), arbitrary resolution wavelet <b>fairing</b> algorithm (ARWFA), and corresponding software, accuracy control of multiresolution <b>fairing</b> was studied for the uncertainty of <b>fairing</b> scale. Firstly, using the idea of inverse problem for reference, linear hypothesis was adopted to predict the corresponding wavelet scale for any given <b>fairing</b> error. Although linear hypothesis has error, it can be eliminated by multiple iterations. So faired curves can be determined by a minimum number of control vertexes and have the best faring effect under the requirement of accuracy. Secondly, in consideration of efficiency loss caused by iterative algorithm, inverse calculation of <b>fairing</b> scale was presented based on the least squares fitting. With the increase of order of curves, inverse calculation accuracy becomes higher and higher. Verification results show that inverse calculation scale can meet the accuracy requirement when fitting curve is sextic. In the whole <b>fairing</b> process, because there is no approximation algorithm such as interpolation and approximation, faired curves can be reconstructed again exactly. This algorithm meets the idea and essence of wavelet analysis well...|$|R
