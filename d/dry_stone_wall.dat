25|$|A <b>dry</b> <b>stone</b> <b>wall</b> {{crosses the}} summit 15 metres {{to the west}} and this runs north to south to the {{adjoining}} fells of High Pike (south) and Hart Crag (north). The highlight of the summit view is obtained by walking {{to the edge of the}} crags and looking down into Dovedale.|$|E
25|$|A small cairn {{marks the}} summit, {{balanced}} on a tilted slab of rock, with crags {{a few yards}} distant to west and north. A corner in the <b>dry</b> <b>stone</b> <b>wall</b> {{is a couple of}} minutes walk away southward. The view {{from the top of the}} fell is best to the north and west with Borrowdale and the Langstrath valley and the fells around them being well seen.|$|E

25|$|On {{the coastal}} plain 20km to Alula's east are found ruins of an ancient {{monument}} in a platform style. The structure is formed by a rectangular <b>dry</b> <b>stone</b> <b>wall</b> that is low in height; the space in between is filled with rubble and manually covered with small stones. Relatively large standing stones are also positioned on the edifice's corners. Near the platform are graves, which are outlined in stones. 24 m by 17 m in dimension, the structure is the largest {{of a string of}} ancient platform and enclosed platform monuments exclusive to far northeastern Somalia.|$|E
25|$|To {{the east}} lies Thirlmere across a moorland of small hillocks. The final descent is steep, falling down conifer clad slopes to the reservoir. To {{the south of}} Thirlmere is its feeder valley of Wythburndale, which rises eastward to its source below Greenup Edge. Above Wythburndale Ullscarf {{displays}} a near continuous line of crags, the principal faces being Castle Crag and Nab Crags. A series of low tops crown the edge above Nab Crags, one of them bearing a prominent stone structure visible from the valley below. This is marked 'beacon' on OS maps, but {{is in fact a}} very short length of <b>dry</b> <b>stone</b> <b>wall.</b> It was set up some decades ago to replace a vandalised beacon cairn.|$|E
25|$|Ascents of Grange Fell can {{be started}} from Rosthwaite, Grange in Borrowdale or Watendlath. The Rosthwaite to Watendlath {{bridleway}} can be utilised to its highest point before striking northerly {{to the summit}} of Brund Fell following a high <b>dry</b> <b>stone</b> <b>wall</b> {{for much of the}} way. The climb from Grange goes through the picturesque deciduous woodland {{at the foot of the}} fell and skirts round Greatend Crag before reaching King's How and is ranked as one of the loveliest short walks in the Lake District. The two principal summits of Brund Fell and King's How should both be climbed by any visitor to the fell and they are linked by an undulating path through the hillocks.|$|E

Public works projects relied on the labour of the 'Royal Twenty Centres' supplied by the under the Unemployment Relief Commission. The public works projects included rebuilding the <b>dry</b> <b>stone</b> <b>wall</b> and moat of Fort Frederick; the physics building extension, the connection from the Fort Frederick dormitory to the new Yeo mess building, the new wing of the hospital, a new garage, road work, levelling the grounds at RMC for new football fields and a new running track.

25|$|Only {{several hundred}} yards from the site of the Merry Maidens lies a Bronze age burial chamber, Cruk Tregyffian, that was {{discovered}} (and unfortunately damaged) during widening of the adjacent B3315 road. The circular barrow is composed of stone uprights decorated with cupmarks, dry stone walling and four capstones. Although the original decorated stone has been removed to Truro museum to protect it against weathering, a replica now sits in its place. Further east along the B3315 road, and only a mile from Lamorna, lies the Boleigh Fogou, considered {{to be one of the}} best remaining monuments of its kind in Cornwall. Built in the Iron age, the purpose of fogous (derived from the Cornish word for cave) is not known. It has been speculated, however, that they could have been used for food storage or for religious ceremonies. The fogou at Boleigh is extensive and has a large entranceway that leads to a long passage with classic <b>dry</b> <b>stone</b> <b>wall</b> and lintel construction. A low doorway just inside the entrance leads to a much narrower and lower passage that turns ninety degrees left after a few metres. After the turn the passage continues for a metre or two before ending; there is a modern metal support grille set into the roof above this section.|$|E

The wooden box was abandoned in favour of allowing the rampart to slope down to the ditch, but to provide protection the rampart would probably have been surmounted by a <b>dry</b> <b>stone</b> <b>wall</b> made from flint.

40|$|This essay {{focuses on}} how a method of documenting <b>dry</b> <b>stone</b> <b>walls</b> in the {{landscape}} can be created. This paper seeks to answer which different principles one can take in to account when documenting dry stonewalls in the landscapes. The <b>dry</b> <b>stone</b> <b>walls</b> inherit different characteristics depending on {{where they can be}} found in the landscape, such as in or beside a field of crops, in a meadow or in the forest. That is dependent on a continual disturbing in the vegetation to prevent it from overgrowing. The <b>dry</b> <b>stone</b> <b>walls</b> are an evidence of the historical and culture forming of the modern day landscape. Whom whiteout documentation will be lost as the as the countryside changes.

2500|$|Sion {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} pre-historic sites in Europe. [...] The alluvial fan of Sionne, the rocky slopes above the river and, to a lesser extent, Valeria and Tourbillon hills have been settled nearly continuously since antiquity. [...] The oldest trace of human settlement comes from 6200 BC during the late Mesolithic. [...] Around 5800 BC early Neolithic farmers from the Mediterranean settled in Sion. [...] The settlements remained small until about 4500 BC, during the middle Neolithic, when the number of settlements increased sharply. [...] To support the population increase, farming and grazing spread throughout the valley. [...] They also began burying their dead in Chablandes-type stone burial cists with engraved anthropomorphic stelae. [...] The individual graves changed at the beginning of the third Millennium BC in large, <b>dry</b> <b>stone</b> <b>wall</b> communal tombs (such as the Dolmen of Le Petit-Chasseur). [...] During the Beaker culture period in the second half of the third Millennium, dolmens were built once again, but they were smaller and had no podium. [...] Stelae continued to be carved, though these were rich with geometric patterns and sometimes built out of old dolmen. [...] At the beginning of the Early Bronze Age (around 2300 BC) the last stelae were erected.|$|E
