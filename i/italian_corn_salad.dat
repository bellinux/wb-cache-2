Optimisation of the growing system can lead to higher yield and/or improved nutritional value of the product. Selenium (Se) is an essential element for animal and humans, with quite a narrow range between deficiency and toxicity, whereas it is assumed beneficial for plants. In the present study, two cultivars (Gala and Baron) of <b>corn</b> <b>salad</b> (Valerianella locusta (L.)

Effects on yield, nitrate content, and accumulation of sulfur (S) and S-containing amino acids and Se and Se-containing amino acids were studied.

At 10 μm selenate, Se-cysteine and Se-methionine were produced, without affecting non-protein thiols or cysteine and methionine contents. At the higher Se supply, sulfate accumulated in the leaves with a parallel decrease in the amount of S-amino acids and a rise in the relative amount of Se-amino acids.

40|$|In recent years, {{increasing}} numbers of outbreaks caused by the consumption of vegetables contaminated with human pathogenic bacteria were reported. The application of organic fertilizers during vegetable production {{is one of the}} possible reasons for contamination with those pathogens. In this study laboratory experiments in axenic and soil systems following common practices in organic farming were conducted to identify the minimal dose needed for bacterial colonization of plants and to identify possible factors like bacterial species or serovariation, plant species or organic fertilizer types used, influencing the success of plant colonization by human pathogenic bacteria. Spinach and <b>corn</b> <b>salad</b> were chosen as model plants and were inoculated with different concentrations of Salmonella enterica sv.

In addition to PCR- and culture-based detection methods, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was applied in order to localize bacteria on or in plant tissues. Our results demonstrate that shoots were colonized by the pathogenic bacteria at inoculation doses as low as 4 x 10 CFU/ml in the axenic system or 4 x 105 CFU/g in the soil system. In addition, plant species dependent effects were observed. Spinach was colonized more often and at lower inoculation doses compared to <b>corn</b> <b>salad.</b> Differential colonization sites on roots, depending on the plant species could be detected using FISH-CLSM analysis. Furthermore, the transfer of pathogenic bacteria to plants via organic fertilizers was observed more often and at lower initial inoculation doses when fertilization was performed with inoculated slurry compared to inoculated manure. Finally, it could be shown that by introducing a simple washing step, the bacterial contamination was reduced in most cases or even was removed completely in some cases...|$|R

40|$|Soil-less {{cultivation}} of horticultural crops represents a fairly recent innovation to traditional agriculture which has several advantages including higher water-use efficiency. When plants are grown with this system, their roots {{come in contact}} with nutrients solely via the hydroponic solution. Although its beneficial effects have been widely demonstrated, silicon (Si) is mostly omitted from the composition of nutrient solutions. Therefore, the objective {{of this study was to}} assess the beneficial effect of Si addition to hydroponic solution on quali-quantitative aspects of edible production of two cultivars of <b>corn</b> <b>salad</b> (Valerianella locusta (L.) Laterr.) grown in soil-less floating system. Impacts on shelf life of this food were also studied. Results show that the supply of Si increased the edible yield and the quality level reducing the nitrate concentration in edible tissues. This result might be attributed to changes either in the metabolism (such as the nitrate assimilation process) or to the functionality of root mechanisms involved in the nutrient acquisition from the outer medium. In fact, our results show for the first time the ability of Si to modulate the root activity of nitrate and Fe uptake through, at least in part, a regulation of gene expression levels of the proteins involved in this phenomenon. In addition, the presence of Si decreased the levels of polyphenoloxidase gene expression at harvest and, in post-harvest, slowed down the chlorophyll degradation delaying leaf senescence and thus prolonging the shelf life of these edible tissues. In conclusion, data showed that the addition of Si to the nutrient solution can be a useful tool for improving quali-quantitatively the yield of baby leaf vegetable <b>corn</b> <b>salad</b> as well as its shelf life. Since the amelioration due to the Si has been achieved only with one cultivar, the recommendation of its inclusion in the nutrient solution does not exclude the identification of cultivars suitable for this cultivation system and the comprehension of agronomical and environmental factors which could limit the Si benefit...|$|R

Under normal conditions, plants have a low content of zeaxanthin. The aim {{of this study was to}} increase the zeaxanthin content in green vegetables by post harvest treatments. Efficient conditions for activation of the endogenous enzyme system generating zeaxanthin was established and included incubation at low pH (2. 5 - 5. 5), with the membrane permeable acetic acid/acetate buffer at room temperature or above for 30 min or more. Typically more than 20 -fold increase in zeaxanthin content was obtained for spinach, <b>corn</b> <b>salad,</b> parsley, basil, lemon balm and peas.

Pot experiments with <b>corn</b> <b>salad,</b> spinach and maize revealed that the acclimatized strain 7 NSK 2 showed a more pronounced beneficial effect (from 13 to 32 %) on plant growth than the non-acclimatized strain (from 7 to 19 %).

40|$|Background: Unbalanced {{nutrient}} availability causes disequilibrated plant growth, which {{can result in}} a worsening of harvested product quality, such as high nitrate content in edible tissues. To cope with this problem, improved knowledge of the mechanisms involved in nutrient acquisition and regulation is necessary. For this purpose the responses of acquisition mechanisms of N, Fe and S were studied as a function of Fe and S availability using two <b>corn</b> <b>salad</b> cultivars grown hydroponically, considering also aspects related to N metabolism. Results: The results showed that an increase in Fe or S availability enhanced nitrate uptake and assimilation, which in turn increased biomass production of leaves with lower nitrate content. In particular, high S availability exerted a positive effect (gene expression and functionality) both on the uptake and metabolism of N and on Fe acquisition mechanisms. Conclusion: The data presented here show close interactions between N, S and Fe, highlighting that relevant improvements in yield and quality from soilless culture might also be obtained through appropriate adjustments of {{nutrient availability}}. In this respect, concerning the role of S in the acquisition mechanisms of N and Fe and in N metabolism, its level of availability should be taken into high consideration for equilibrated plant growth...|$|R
40|$|The nickel update from {{different}} soils and Ni-bondings {{has been compared}} with chemical soil extraction. NiCl_ 2 proved to be most available, followed by an artificially Ni-enriched sludge. The Ni-uptake from industrial sludges and filter dust, {{as well as from}} geogeneously Ni-containing soils, was very low. Wheat, barley, rapeseed and mustard absorbed little Ni and did not exhibit toxicity symptoms. Spinach, lettuce carrots, kohlrabi and oats accumulated higher Ni-amounts and reacted with yield depressions. Bush beans, radish and <b>corn</b> <b>salad</b> showed especially high Ni-concentrations and were visibly damaged. Rye gras took up equally much Ni but did not suffer from its toxicity. Regarding the natural Ni of many soils, the present limit value of 50 mg/kg is unnecessarily low, but nonetheless can not be increased due to the toxicity of anthropogeneous Ni-contamination. Extractants with pronounced dissolution capacity reflect the Ni-availability as poorly as the total Ni-contents do. The same also applies for buffered solutions because of their changing the pH-status during the extraction. Only salt solutions are able to indicate the actual plant availability, although even there the extraction values have to be corrected to some exent. (orig.)
