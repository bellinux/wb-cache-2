Food succulence is important in grasshopper diets, and mosses and lichens may provide a means of withstanding the aridity and drought of the Mackenzie Basin.|$|E
40|$|Extended Abstract: The short-tailed {{albatross}} (Phoebastria albatrus), one {{of three}} northern hemisphere albatrosses, is listed as an endangered species under the U. S. Endangered Species Act. The species is known to breed in only two locations. The main colony, where 80 % of the birds breed, is located on a <b>fluvial</b> <b>outwash</b> plain of an active volcanic island, Torishima, {{off the coast of}} Japan. The other known breeding site is in the Senkakus, an island chain claimed by Japan, Taiwan, and mainland China, which may contain notable oil reserves. Short-tailed albatrosses are very much at home in the ocean; in fact, after fledging, they remain at sea for 5 – 6 years before returning to land to breed. The mature birds develop a white head and golden cape; younger birds go through various darker plumage phases. Available evidence indicates that there were millions of short-tailed albatrosses up until the late 1800 s. By many accounts, they were the most numerous albatross species in the North Pacific. Between 1885 and 1903, an estimated 5 million birds were harvested from the breeding colony on Torishima. The birds were harvested for their feathers and fat, their bodies were used for fertilizer, and their eggs were collected for food. By 1949, there were no short-tailed albatrosses breeding at any historically known sites, and the species was believed to be extinct...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{assertion}} by many early and more recent New Zealand glacial workers, {{that the high}} catchment rainfall and low seasonality in New Zealand create unique glacial sedimentary and geomorphic processes. Specifically the thesis examines the nature of glacial sedimentology and geomorphology in South Island, New Zealand focussing on the Rakaia Valley, {{as most of the}} early studies that suggested a distinct New Zealand process environment were based on South Island, East Coast glacial valleys. The thesis provides insights into glacial processes operating at glacial termini of late Quaternary glaciers in this region. The primary findings are as follows: Glacial terminus landforms (moraines) and sediments are described in two eastern (Rakaia and Ashburton Lakes) and one western (Waiho) valley of South Island. There are three main types of landforms 1) outwash head, 2) push moraines and 3) ice-contact fans. Outwash heads and push moraines have been identified before in New Zealand, but ice-contact fans have not. The spatial relationships between the three landforms can be complex especially where there is a fluctuating glacier terminus. Outwash heads are the dominant landform, with ice-contact fans deposited at a stationary terminus with channelised meltwater and push moraines preserved during retreat accompanied with outwash head incision. Both ice-contact fans and push moraines are prone to reworking into the outwash head. Supraglacial material comprises a small cap on the moraines and is usually insignificant in this system. The nature of past glacier termini can be gained from detailed study of these three landform relationships and their sediment record. The dominance of glacifluvial processes at the glacier terminus {{is a reflection of the}} low seasonality, abundant catchment rainfall, coupled with a large sediment supply. Preservation and deposition of the push moraines and ice-contact fans are controlled by glacifluvial processes on an outwash head, which in turn are controlled by the mass balance of the glacier. Sedimentology, stratigraphy and facies architecture were examined in the lower Rakaia Valley and elsewhere. The main environments recorded by these sediments are largely proglacial lacustrine and <b>fluvial</b> including 1) <b>outwash</b> gravels, with deposition of a sequence of glacier-fed, Gilbert-type deltas deposited over buried ice at Bayfield Cliff, 2) lacustrine silts and sands, 3) sub-aqueous ice-contact fans, 4) sub-aqueous mass flow deposits, and 5) supraglacial melt out material. These glacilacustrine facies are widespread during both retreats and advances. Sub-aqueous deltas are the primary ice terminus form, in this mid-valley lacustrine setting, which record termini advance and retreats. Syn- and postdepositional deformation of lacustine facies are also common as a result of pushing and overriding from the fluctuating glacier termini. Buried ice is also widespread and many of these deposits display evidence of disruption of sedimentation by its meltout. This implies that stagnant tongues of ice were often buried by outwash and lacustrine sediments. From the sediments and geomorphology described in this thesis, two main glacier terminus settings in New Zealand valleys are apparent A) when the glacier terminus is on or abutting its outwash fan-head, or B) when the glacier terminus is within its trough. Both the geomorphic and edimentological findings allow a better understanding of New Zealand glacial chronologies. Firstly, the sedimentology permits the identification of many more advances and retreats than are recorded in surface sediments. At Rakaia Valley, facies record six significant advances and retreats and many more small oscillations over the last 200 000 years. The geomorphic understanding and high resolution mapping has identified many more ice termini in the valleys than were previously recognised and allow the insights into ice margin behaviour through time. This includes the changing location of outwash heads and glacial troughs, with a migration up-valley since the OIS 6 advance/s, in the Rakaia Valley. The glacier overran its outwash head to reach its LGM position, and subsequently retreated slowly over about 10, 000 years, back to its outwash head. It then changed to a calving margin and continued retreating but with no terminal moraines preserved, only lateral features. The research in this thesis has contributed to greater understanding of the New Zealand glacial system. Although low seasonality and large volumes of meltwater do play a role, and equally important control in New Zealand valleys is that of tectonics in terms of delivering huge sediment supply. This sediment supply enables large outwash head and fans to accumulate, which allow large stable lakes to form during glacier recession. The data and interpretations from this thesis will underpin the development of a New Zealand glacial land system, of which other valleys such as the Himalayas have. This land system development is important for understanding the temperate, high sediment yield glacial environment end member...|$|R
40|$|This Sheet Description {{describes}} the geology of the Sweihan and Remah 1 : 100 000 scale geological map. The Sweihan and Remah district covers 2780 km 2 east of Abu Dhabi. Over 700 observation points were made throughout the district. Pre-Quaternary bedrock comprises Miocene conglomerate of the Barzaman Formation which probably underlies the entire area. It is poorly exposed in roughly east-west trending inter-dune areas {{and in a}} number of excavations in the northwest and eastern parts of the area. Over almost the entire area, the Barzaman Formation is overlain by deposits of the Quaternary (Pleistocene) Hili Formation, which is up to at least 20 m thick in places. Three facies of the Hili Formation were mapped; coarse fluvial channel gravels, fluvial sands, and siltstones (overbank deposits). They represent a complex <b>fluvial</b> <b>outwash</b> system draining from the Hajar Mountains in the east. As such, they tend to fine distally to the southwest, where the majority of the fluvial sands and siltstone/mudstones occur. They locally contain intercalated aeolian sand beds which were blown in from the north-west. Quaternary carbonate-cemented aeolianites of the Ghayathi Formation are well-developed in the north western corner of the district. These represent fossil seif dune systems which locally form the cores to fields of modern pale carbonate-dominated low dunes. The Quaternary deposits are overlain by various modern dune sands (Rub al Khali Formation) with various morphologies, mapped as dune ridges, locally culminating in star dunes, and barchanoid low dune fields. Interdune areas, floored either by Miocene or Quaternary rocks typically have continental sabkha veneers and, adjacent to the dune fields, thin sand veneer...|$|E
40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the author. © 1986 Dr. Philip Edward O'BrienThis study investigates the sedimentology and geochemistry of Permian glacial sediments cropping out in the Bacchus Marsh and Derrinal areas in central Victoria and in the subsurface beneath the Cainozoic Murray Basin in Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia. Facies analysis of the Bacchus Marsh Formation, based on a critical review of literature on glacial sedimentary processes and environments, identifies the following major facies groups: 1. Subglacial tillites deposited beneath wet-based ice. Some of these tillites exhibit structures indicative {{of a number of}} subglacial processes such as frictional lodgement of large clasts, subglacial bed deformation, subglacial meltwater flow and subglacial size sorting of clasts. Other subglacial tillites are essentially structureless. 2. Bedded diamictites to sandstones deposited predominantly by ice-rafting of debris into standing water. 3. <b>Fluvial</b> <b>outwash</b> sandstone and conglomerate facies that are finer-grained than typical proglacial outwash facies. 4. Deltas and subaqueous outwash fans vary from sandy sediments deposited by proglacial and subglacial streams to coarse, poorly sorted complexes deposited as debris aprons close to the ice front. Abundant underflow deposits suggest that less than normal marine salinities prevailed in these water bodies, even if they were arms of the sea. 5. Supraglacial tillites consisting of sandy diamictites to pebble conglomerates. Facies in the thickest sequence in the Bacchus Marsh area suggests that the area was covered by a major ice mass at least 8 times. Minor glacial advances took place during predominantly ice-free periods. The Derrinal Formation consists of a basal unit of predominantly subglacial tillite deposited in shallow glacially excavated valleys overlain by a complex of subglacial and supraglacial facies deposited by about 8 minor advances of a small ice tongue. Facies relationships {{in this part of the}} sequence are confused by intense deformation of the sediment pile during the melting of buried ice and dewatering of saturated diamictons. A major ice advance then overwhelmed the area depositing thick subglacial tillite. The Urana Formation, beneath the Murray Basin, is dominated by marine ice-rafted diamictite and mudstone. Rhythmically bedded siltstone and claystone, sediment gravity-flow deposits, traction-current deposits, and, possibly, subglacial tillites are also present. Facies assemblages in some drill holes indicate areas that were never covered by grounded glacial ice. Sedimentological and palaeontological evidence suggests that the Urana Formation was deposited towards the end of the glaciation. Ice motion indicators and ice sheet limits inferred from the facies assemblages in the Urana Formation are used to estimate the thickness of the ice over central Victoria during glacial maxima. These estimates support the conclusion drawn from the facies analysis that the ice was a large ice sheet. Comparisons of ice movement directions for central Victoria and formerly adjacent parts of Gondwana suggest that a large ice sheet was centred in North Victorialand. Major and some trace elements analyses of the clay component of marine and non-marine diamictites were used to test a number of methods of distinguishing marine from nonmarine glacial diamictites. None of the methods were clearly successful because sediment detrital mineralogy dominates the geochemical composition though V/Cr ratios may be useful in some circumstances. Open Acces...|$|E
40|$|Dans le Bassin parisien pendant l'Eocène et l'Oligocène, on dénombre vingt-deux discontinuités issues d'émersions {{correspondant}} aux périodes de bas-niveaux marins. La présence de fleuves est décelée dans les prismes de bordure de plate-forme et dans les prismes de haut niveau, remobilisant des stocks sableux anciens à partir des anticlinaux actifs et des bordures du bassin. Ainsi, indépendamment du volume disponible pour les sédiments, se succèdent des séquences dominées soit par des formations détritiques, soit par des formations carbonatées. La plate-forme parisienne a enregistré toutes les variations eustatiques connues, bien que les mouvements tectoniques syn-sédimentaires locaux puissent influencer fortement les conditions de sédimentation. Mieux encore, la plate-forme parisienne a subi des fluctuations marines d'ordre supérieur de très courte durée qui, si elles sont retrouvées dans d'autres domaines, pourront être attribuées à des phénomènes eustatiques. The Paris Basin (Map 1) is {{a classic}} example of a stable platform such as has been known throughout the World for a long time now. Aside from the Bartonian and Priabonian, all Eocene and Oligocene stages have been defined in the form of the following four international stratotypes : Sparnacian, Cuisian, Lutetian and Stampian. It should also be noted that the substages of the Bartonian (Auversian, marinesian) and the Ludian, the equivalent of the Priabonian, are also Parisian. Even though gaps have recently been redefined (C. Pomerol, 1989), though the correlations between the different formations in the basin and those of the surrounding areas (D. Curry, 1967; et al. 1969, 1978; C. Pomerol, 1977; C. Cavelier, 1979; C. Cavelier and C. Pomerol, 1986) have now been determined, and though the worldwide eustatic sea level curve was partly plotted with the help of stratotype sections (B. U. Haq et al., 1988), the Eocene and Oligocene sequence analysis of the paris Basin has as yet only been roughly sketched out. The survey was not based on seismic profiles because the Parisian Tertiary series outcrop. Therefore, our analysis is based on field observations and the abundant bibliography dealing with the Paris Basin. Recent dating of different depositional systems for each sequence is mainly due to the determining of Wetzelliaceae (J. J. Châteauneuf and C. Gruas-Cavagnetto, 1968; J. J. Châteauneuf, 1980), calcareous nannofossils (M. P. Aubry, 1983, 1985; E. Steurbaut, 1988), Characea (J. Riveline, 1984), mollusca and mammalia (C. Cavelier, 1979, 1987). We propose a time section (Plate 1 and Figs. 1 to 21) and a paleogeographic map (Maps 2 to 18) for each depositional sequence. There are 22 unconformities corresponding to large sedimentation gaps during the Eocene and Oligocene (Plate 1). They are the results of emersions and correspond to low sea levels when the sediments were situated solely in lowstand prograduring wedges or on the Shelf margin wedge but rarely present in the Paris Basin [Sequences 1 (Fig. 1), 3 (Fig. 3), 19 (Fig. 19) and 20 (Fig. 20) ]. These unconformities, bounded by depositional sequences, are often confused with transgressive surfaces on the Paris shelf and are usually revealed by erosional surfaces as well as by the presence of paleolkarsts, paleosols, eolian reworking or sandstone diagenesis. Unconformities at the Thanetian-Sparnacian, upper Cuisian-Terminal Cuisian, Cuisian-Lutetian, Mrinesian-Ludian, Ludian-Stampian and Stampian-Chattian boundaries can be recognized from the Type 1 (Plate 1). In the Paris Basin, these unconformities are major ones separating most of the stratotypic sequences. The other sequences are reparated by a Type 2 unconformity with local subaerial erosion on the edges of the Paris Gulf or on the entire area of the basin (Sequences 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17, 18, 19 and 20) depending on the eustatic fall and the subsidence. The presence of rivers, mainly issuing from the South and East of the basin, can be detected on the shelf margin wedges and in the highstand prograding wedges. However, there are no real paleovalleys underneath the unconformities, but at most an irregular surface that usually bears witness not to continental erosion but to gullying linked to the ensuing transgression. Formations subjected to erosion during lowstand periods are often quite unconsolidated. The paleoreliefs built up during emersion were easily leveled by the ensuing transgression. Likewise, outside of the tectonically active areas in the basin during the Eocene and Oligocene (Pays de Bray, Orxois dome, Rémarde anticline, Meudon anticline), which sometimes form islands (Maps 2 to 18), transgressions occurred in the rest of the basin onflat surface or one with residual reliefs of decimetric size. Like in some current drainage systems, it can be supposed that the most deeply indented paleovalleys are situated near the shelf edge during lowstand, periods. This would imply their probable existence well west of the Paris Basin near the continental slope of the werstern English Channel. An analysis of the lithology of the different depositional systems within the sequences shows an alternation or coexistance of sandy or clayey clasting sedimentation and purely carbonate sedimentation. The origin of the Parisian Tertiary sandstones has been recognized as having come successively from former Mesozoic (A. Blondeau et al., 1964) and Cenozoic (J. Riveline-Bauer, 1970; C. Lorenz et al., 1984) sandy sources. The remobilization of these sources was mainly linked to the episodic uplifting of anticlines (Pays de Bray and Artois regions mainly) and of basin edges, providing a source for coastal sedimentation with continental sandy or clayey influxes brought in by rivers in the South and the Champagne region (Maps 2 to 18). Thus, apart from the volume available for the sediments (accomodation), sequences succeeded one another in time while being dominated either by highly clastic formation or by essentially carbonate formations. The case of the Meretrix rustica limestones in the Vexin region, which are contemporary with the Auvers sandstones, is an exemplary one (Fig. 9, Map 10). The regions sheltered from sandy influxes (the Vexin region at the time was a marginal marine domain backed up against a chalky hinterland and isolated from the main gulf by the Pays de Bray Island and the Sables d'Auversoffshore bars) could at the same time gather in a purely carbonate sedimentation. These same limestones east of Vexin become calcareous sandstones associated with Auvers sandstones. A sequence analysis of the Eocene-Oligocene in the Paris Basin also reveals that the Soisson lignites were deposited in the midst of an upper highstand systems tract and then were marked at the level of the paleosols by the presence of a late highstand systems tract (Fig. 1, Map 2). Initially, they were in a coastal plain environment associated with prograding coastal deltaic systems and then with <b>fluvial</b> <b>outwash</b> plains. On the contrary, the Epernay lignites belong to a late lowstand wedge (Fig. 3, Map 4) and indicated the presence of palustrine environment between the emerged areas and the oyster lagoons, which themselves were sheltered by offshore bars present in the aggrading Laon sands. Elsewhere, when the gypsums in the Paris Basin are of marine origine [Lutetian gypsums (Figs. 6 and 7), fourth, third and second Gypsum Masses (Figs. 14, 15 and 16) ], they belong to an early highstand systems tract. However, the first Gypsum Mass and the Marabet Bank, which are of continental origin, are part of a late highstand systems tract (Figs. 16 and 17). The great central subsidence of the basin at that time left a log of space available, but the slight subsidence of the edges, especially in the NW, and the great lowering of the sea level served to isolate a very thick continental evaporitic basin in the depocenter area. The depositional sequences thus described show, on the whole, a very close correlation with the eustatic sea level curve (B. U. Haq et al., 1988) since this curve was plotted, among others, from stratotype sections. The Parisian platform underwent all the eustatic variations known on a worldwide scale, even though some local synsedimentary tectonic movements (A. Blondeau et al., 1964, C. Pomerol, 1967; R. Wyns, 1978; C. Cavelier and C. Pomerol, 1979; C. Mégnien, 1980; C. Lorenz, 1984) may have strongly influence the conditions of sedimentation (Maps 2 to 18), revealing moreover the persistance during this entire period of active tectonic structures such as the Pays de Bray, and also the migration of the depocenter in the Paris Basin for each depositional sequence. Better yet, the Parisian platform underwent marine fluctuations lasting very briefly and which, if they are found in other stable domains, may be attributed to eustatic sea level phenomena...|$|E
