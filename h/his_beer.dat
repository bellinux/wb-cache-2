5|$|Anne Whittle (Chattox) {{was accused}} {{of the murder of}} Robert Nutter. She pleaded not guilty, but the {{confession}} she had made to Roger Nowell was read out in court, and evidence against her was presented by James Robinson, who had lived with the Chattox family 20 years earlier. He claimed to remember that Nutter had accused Chattox of turning <b>his</b> <b>beer</b> sour, and that she was commonly believed to be a witch. Chattox broke down and admitted her guilt, calling on God for forgiveness and the judges to be merciful to her daughter, Anne Redferne.|$|E
25|$|As to Squire Western, he {{was seldom}} {{out of the}} sick-room, unless when he was engaged either in the field or over his bottle. Nay, he would {{sometimes}} retire hither to take <b>his</b> <b>beer,</b> {{and it was not}} without difficulty that he was prevented from forcing Jones to take <b>his</b> <b>beer</b> too: for no quack ever held his nostrum to be a more general panacea than he did this; which, he said, had more virtue in it than was in all the physic in an apothecary's shop.|$|E

25|$|Ten {{years after}} establishment, on 19 May 1769 Guinness {{exported}} <b>his</b> <b>beer</b> (he had ceased ale brewing by then) {{for the first}} time, when {{six and a half}} barrels were shipped to England. The business expanded by adopting steam power and further exporting to the English market. On the death of Benjamin Guinness in 1868 the business was worth over £1 million, and the brewery site had grown from about 1 acre to over 64 acres. In 1886 his son Edward sold 65 percent of the business by a public offering on the London Stock Exchange for £6 million.|$|E
25|$|Like {{most other}} things in Wolfe's life, <b>his</b> <b>beer</b> {{drinking}} is bound by ritual. Seated at his desk, Wolfe presses the button twice to ring for beer, and Fritz delivers the bottles unopened; Wolfe uncaps the bottles himself, using an 18-carat gold bottle opener {{given to him by}} a satisfied client. He never drinks directly from the bottle, but instead pours the beer into a glass and lets the foam settle to an appropriate level before drinking. He keeps the gold opener in the center drawer of his desk, where he also keeps the bottlecaps as a means of tracking his daily/weekly consumption.|$|E

25|$|Kaiō won {{his first}} top {{division}} tournament championship in May 2000 from the komusubi rank, defeating yokozuna Takanohana and three ōzeki and losing just one bout to Akebono. It was the first top division yūshō by a wrestler from Tomozuna stable since Tachiyama in 1916. He attributed his victory partly to cutting down on <b>his</b> <b>beer</b> consumption. Set a target of eleven wins by the Japan Sumo Association for promotion to ōzeki in the following tournament in July 2000, he achieved the necessary total {{on the final day}} and his promotion was confirmed a few days later. He was 28 years of age, and the 44 tournaments it took him to reach ōzeki from his top division debut was the second slowest ever. Nevertheless, he went on to maintain the rank for eleven years, eventually becoming the oldest ōzeki {{since the start of the}} Shōwa era in 1926, and also the longest serving, in terms of number of tournaments, a record he holds jointly with Chiyotaikai.|$|E
500|$|In 1994, the group's lyrics {{shifted to}} Christian themes, {{starting}} with the album Faith. Andrew Hamlin describes the lyrics of Faith as having [...] "caught Ivey mid-capitulation. He wanted Jesus in his life but he also wanted <b>his</b> <b>beer,</b> his pot, his television, and his lust." [...] During the release of Faith, Ivey stated that Basehead's fourth studio album, In the Name of Jesus, would feature even more Christian-oriented lyrics than Faith. Regarding the lyrics of In the Name of Jesus, Hamlin writes that [...] "chanting praises leaves the Basehead mastermind without his characteristic wit, and he lacks the energetic exhortations that often lift gospel performers above sameness in material." [...] Regarding dc Basehead, Hamlin wrote that the album's lyrics were [...] "miles in some direction or other from any stereotyped Christian rock bin." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1865, Olympia brewer Isaac Wood {{imported}} some hop roots {{from the}} United Kingdom, hopeful {{that they would}} do well in the Pacific Northwest. As hops, used to flavor beer, were not then grown locally, the cost of transport from Britain or New York made <b>his</b> <b>beer</b> expensive, and he hoped Puget Sound-area farmers would grow hops and supply him. [...] He was a friend of Jacob Meeker, and gave him the roots to grow. Jacob passed some of them on to Ezra. The plants grew extremely well, {{and at the end of}} the season, the Meekers earned $185 from selling Wood the crop. Such a sum was rarely seen in the Puyallup Valley at that time, and a hop-growing boom promptly began. Ezra Meeker, with his head start, was able to repeatedly expand operations, he eventually had [...] of hop-growing lands. He also built one of the first hop-drying kilns in the valley. For years Meeker supplied Portland brewer Henry Weinhard.|$|E

Nick lies to Dot that he had promised to send money to Sandy {{on the condition that}} she named their daughter Dorothy after her grandmother, so that Dot will trust him and bond with his daughter; Dot does not know Dotty's real name. After spending the night, Dotty begs Dot to let them stay longer. Dot soon discovers that Nick is unemployed and he and Dotty have been living rough. Nick says he will either put Dotty into care or sell her to Dot. After serious consideration, she buys Dotty to get her away from Nick. Dotty learns that Dot has left all her money to Dotty in her will, and tells Nick. They plan to kill Dot to inherit the money, and trick her into thinking she is suffering from dementia. Eventually, Dotty is told by Nick to give Dot an overdose of her medication, but, Dotty has {{had a change of heart}} and gives the pills to Nick in <b>his</b> <b>beer.</b> When Nick learns of Dotty's double-crossing, he drags her to the café and holds everyone inside hostage. [...] Dotty escapes along with most of the others, but the café explodes, and in the commotion, Nick escapes. Dot suspects Dotty may be just as evil as Nick, so plants some tablets on the kitchen table whilst Dotty has her back turned. Dot leaves the room and spies on Dotty, who ignores the tablets.|$|E

2500|$|The first novel, Fer-de-Lance, {{introduces}} Wolfe as {{he prepares}} to change his habits. With Prohibition at an end, he can stop buying kegs of bootleg beer and purchase it legally in bottles. Fritz brings in samples of 49 different brands for him to evaluate, from which he ultimately selects Remmers as his favorite.

[...] She lived there several years with her daughters, Mary Banning (1871–1956) and Lucy Banning (1876–1929). The enormous old structure made a charming home, which was cut up into suitable parlors and bedrooms and elegantly furnished, with a fine view.

"That Maxwell {{should spend}} his efforts upon a romanticized, {{literary}} past {{is no less}} legitimate than the preoccupation of a Chirico with long sad vistas in towns that never were.

2500|$|In {{comparison}} to the sickly hopeless denizens of Gin Lane, the happy people of Beer Street sparkle with robust health and bonhomie. [...] "Here all is joyous and thriving. Industry and jollity go hand in hand". The only business that is in trouble is the pawnbroker: Mr Pinch lives in the one poorly maintained, crumbling building in the picture. In contrast to his Gin Lane counterpart, the prosperous Gripe, who displays expensive-looking cups in his upper window (a sign of his flourishing business), Pinch displays only a wooden contraption, perhaps a mousetrap, in his upper window, while he is forced to take <b>his</b> <b>beer</b> through a window in the door, which suggests his business is so unprofitable as to put the man in fear of being seized for debt.

The MPs intercepted the soldiers on Station Road, the only route back to the base. What happened next is disputed: two black soldiers who were not involved in the violence claimed that the MPs threatened the soldiers, shouting [...] "By God men, come on!", while a British Special Constable who was nearby said the MPs were initially peaceful and stopped to talk to Adams who was drinking in the road.|$|E
2500|$|Until January 2006 an Avro Vulcan bomber ( [...] XL391) was on static {{external}} display {{close to the}} entrance to the airport. XL391's last operational role was at Ascension Island during the Falklands conflict in 1982, however, it only flew as a backup aircraft and never actually went to the Falklands. It was put up for sale in October 2004 on eBay and purchased by Manchester pub landlord Chris Ollerenshaw (for £15,102.03) who had intentions to transport it to his pub and display it in <b>his</b> <b>beer</b> garden. However, after finding out that the condition of the aircraft was so poor that moving it would be extremely challenging and that it would cost over £20,000 in addition to the reported £1000 a week storage charge, Mr Ollerenshaw pulled out of the deal and later relinquished ownership of the plane back to the airport. The Vulcan was then sold on for scrap for £4,800 and was scrapped and completely removed from the site on 12 January 2006.|$|E
