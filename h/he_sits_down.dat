5|$|The film {{centers on}} the Dixon family, in {{particular}} Alan Dixon, who has recently received his driver's license and is eager to begin driving a car. When local police officer Hal Jackson visits the Dixons and learns that Alan's license has arrived, <b>he</b> <b>sits</b> <b>down</b> and tells Alan ways to drive safely and avoid getting into accidents. Although the film is fictional, a real family served as {{the inspiration for the}} film's scenario. During production, assistance was provided by staff of the National Safety Council, along with the Idaho State Police and the Colorado State Patrol.|$|E
5|$|Steve, the host, {{presents}} {{the audience with}} a puzzle involving Blue, the animated dog... To help the audience unlock the puzzle, Blue leaves behind a series of clues, which are objects marked {{with one of her}} paw prints. In between the discovery of the clues, Steve plays a series of games — mini-puzzles — with the audience that are thematically related to the overall puzzle... As the show unfolds, Steve and Blue move from one animated set to another, jumping through magical doorways, leading viewers on a journey of discovery, until, {{at the end of the}} story, Steve returns to the living room. There, at the climax of the show, <b>he</b> <b>sits</b> <b>down</b> in a comfortable chair to think — a chair known, of course, in the literal world of Blue's Clues, as the Thinking Chair. He puzzles over Blue's three clues and attempts to come up with the answer.|$|E
25|$|Everybody {{has left}} Mars {{to go to}} Earth, except Walter Gripp—a single miner {{who lives in the}} {{mountains}} and does not hear of the departure. At first excited by his find of an empty town, he enjoys himself with money, food, clothes, and movies. He soon realizes he misses human companionship. One night he hears a telephone ringing in someone's home, and suddenly realizes that someone else is alive on Mars. Missing the call, and several others, <b>he</b> <b>sits</b> <b>down</b> with a phone book of Mars and starts dialing at A.|$|E

6000|$|He {{then stood}} {{silent for a}} moment, having {{finished}} that task; but yet <b>he</b> did not <b>sit</b> <b>down.</b> Why, oh, why does <b>he</b> not <b>sit</b> <b>down?</b> why, O Undy, does he thus stand, looking at {{the surface of the}} table on which he is leaning? ...|$|R
60|$|Go! He laughed outright. Never! <b>He</b> would <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> {{under that}} fortress, and some day {{he meant to}} scale the walls. Like John Paul Jones, {{he had not yet}} begun to fight. But <b>he</b> did not <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> just yet, because Cynthia {{remained}} standing.|$|R
25|$|The wild {{worship of}} {{lawlessness}} and the materialist worship of law {{end in the}} same void. Nietzsche scales staggering mountains, but he turns up ultimately in Tibet. <b>He</b> <b>sits</b> <b>down</b> beside Tolstoy {{in the land of}} nothing and Nirvana. They are both helpless – one because he must not grasp anything, and the other because he must not let go of anything. The Tolstoyan's will is frozen by a Buddhist instinct that all special actions are evil. But the Nietzscheite's will is quite equally frozen by his view that all special actions are good; for if all special actions are good, none of them are special. They stand at the crossroads, and one hates all the roads and the other likes all the roads. The result is – well, some things are not hard to calculate. They stand at the cross-roads.|$|E
25|$|Aschenbach boards a gondola for Venice {{and sings}} of its beauty. He realises and mocks his own {{resemblance}} to the Elderly Fop. Upon seeing the Polish family ahead of him, Aschenbach follows distractedly. Tadzio detaches himself from the family and waits for Aschenbach, who turns away when the boy looks directly at him. Aschenbach is pleased to notice that Tadzio does not betray his follower's presence to his mother. Alone again, Aschenbach buys strawberries from a street seller, but finds them musty and over-ripe. <b>He</b> <b>sits</b> <b>down,</b> tired and ill, and bitterly mocks himself ("Self-discipline your strength... All folly, all pretence"). He recites a paraphrase of Plato's dialogue between the old philosopher Socrates and the boy Phaedrus, speaking the parts of both man and boy. The subject of the dialogue is the paradoxical, dangerous relationship between the artist and his subject.|$|E
25|$|Having said that, {{he moves}} the log a little forward and throws a coin into the fire. The {{woman of the}} house puts a woolen blanket on the polazniks back, and seats him on a low stool by the fireplace. In the moment when <b>he</b> <b>sits</b> <b>down,</b> they try to pull away the stool beneath him, {{as if to make}} him fall on the floor. The polaznik goes out into the yard, and throws grain inside a circle made with the rope with which Christmas straw has been tied, calling chickens. When they gather in the circle he catches a rooster, whose head is then cut off by him or the head of {{household}} on the house's threshold. The rooster will be roasted on a wooden spit as part of Christmas dinner. The polaznik usually stays for dinner with the family. He receives a gift {{in the form of a}} round cake with an embedded coin, and a towel, shirt, socks, or some other useful thing.|$|E
60|$|In vain did <b>he</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> {{and hold}} fast. Some power took {{possession}} of him which forced him first {{to stretch out}} his arm {{and pick up the}} cigar-box containing the hand of Ma-Mee, and next drew him from the friendly shelter of the deal boards that were about the boat.|$|R

500|$|We sense his untrustworthy nature {{immediately}} when <b>he</b> <b>sits</b> <b>down</b> {{beside the}} boys at a football game and doesn't understand it, despite the boys' best efforts to explain. When he does grasp something, you know it. [...] "I onnerstand pairfectly," [...] he says. Later he adds genially, [...] "I haf you vhere I vant you now!" [...] Can't quite place the accent? It's foreign. Twenty-five chapters are not enough {{to solve the mystery}} of his nationality.|$|E
500|$|As Boris {{explains}} that the Pharaoh was oblivious that Moses himself was actually a Hebrew, Chas enters the attic, looking for the kids, and becomes locked in {{with the rest of}} them. <b>He</b> <b>sits</b> <b>down</b> and listens as Boris continues: years later, Boris says, Moses stood up for an abused Hebrew slave (imagined as Chuckie), and was outed as a Hebrew. The episode then pictures Tommy as Moses fleeing to the desert, where he becomes a shepherd and forgets about Egypt and the Pharaoh, until the voice of God calls to him from a burning bush, telling him that he must free the Hebrews from slavery.|$|E
500|$|A week later, Tom lies in bed, {{smoking and}} writing. Gerri enters the room, {{and it is}} {{revealed}} that Tom has left his job. She has been rehearsing in Portsmouth and says she left him dozens of messages, but Tom thinks he lost his phone. The pair fight over Migg, who is still living with Tom. Later still, the flat is a mess, and Tom is unkempt and drinking heavily. He has no messages on his phone and no post. <b>He</b> <b>sits</b> <b>down</b> to play Scrabble with Migg, and it is revealed that it is Tom's birthday. The two argue about washing up, and Migg says that Tom has [...] "no right" [...] to judge him. Tom storms out of the room, and Migg flicks through birthday cards he has hidden from Tom, saying [...] "Thank you, Grandma!" [...] and taking the £10 that Tom's grandmother sent. The house and Tom have deteriorated further when Stevie comes to visit. He has brought Tom vouchers for The Body Shop. Stevie invites Tom out for dinner, but he declines. Stevie leaves, and Tom settles down with Migg on the sofa.|$|E

2500|$|When Luke sits on Jay's [...] "Ludlum's" [...] (his e-reader) Jay {{opens the}} cover and the glass tinkles into his lap, he says [...] "not fair, it's not fair." [...] This {{references}} the original Twilight Zone episode [...] "Time Enough at Last". In the episode there is an antisocial man with bad vision and very thick glasses who wants {{nothing more than to}} be completely alone so he can read his books. One day there is a disaster that kills everyone but him, and one of the only buildings left standing is the library. <b>He</b> <b>sits</b> <b>down</b> to read to his heart's content, but his glasses fall off and hit the ground, he picks them up to put them on and the glass from the lens falls tinkling on to his lap. <b>He</b> <b>sits</b> <b>down</b> and says [...] "it isn't fair, it just isn't fair." ...|$|E

While Don jokes about the dreadful teacher they had, he and Charlie realize {{why it was so}} important to their mother. At the end of [...] "Running Man", Don comes home and finds the sheet music his mother wrote on the table. <b>He</b> <b>sits</b> <b>down</b> and starts playing, hesitantly at first, as Charlie and Alan listen from the garage.|$|E

2500|$|So {{reads the}} {{pantomime}} scenario; {{what follows is}} Gautier's review of the piece:... the sight of this pantomime has filled our soul with melancholy. [...] What! [...] Pierrot, from whom of old one borrowed a pen—"to write a word"—and who loaned it so willingly, having {{not the least bit}} of interest in it himself, has been reduced by the misery of the times to making it run from morning to night over musty old documents! ... Pierrot! no longer daring to wear his white blouse and his wide trousers! [...] Pierrot in a black suit! [...] And what a black suit! threadbare, tight, curled at the cuffs with age, its seams blackened with ink: a perfect poem of respectable misery! [...] —When <b>he</b> <b>sits</b> <b>down,</b> what pitiful angles his knees make! [...] How pointed his elbows are! [...] What a black gaze is in that pale and flour-covered face! [...] This is what has become of the joyous Pierrot of the pantomime. [...] Pierrot has a profession; Pierrot is employed. [...] He has been made to realize that a century as serious as our own will not suffer the idle!Gautier's remark about Legrand's black suit says something else about the mime: that he was as comfortable in character costume (Deburau initiated the practice) as he was in the garb of Pierrot. [...] About this Gautier was ambivalent: the [...] "truthfulness" [...] of Legrand's acting was unprecedented, but how welcome it was for the spectator still enchanted by the fantasy of Deburau's stage was a valid question: [...] "By virtue of the verisimilitude of his acting," [...] writes Gautier, [...] " [...] turns the fantastic type into a human character whose white face comes as a surprise. [...] He often even abandons the linen blouse and trousers, retaining only the plaster mask, in order to represent beings that are more real." [...] The [...] "realism" [...] of Legrand's pantomime marked a dramatic—and, for some, a disturbing—turn in the fortunes of Pierrot.|$|E
