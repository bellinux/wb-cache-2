500|$|In July 2013, NuScale {{announced}} {{an effort to}} study and demonstrate NuScale reactors in the western United States, called Program WIN (Western Initiative for Nuclear), with plans to build the first NuScale-based power plant in the western United States by 2024. In November 2014, NuScale announced it was building what {{is expected to be}} the first SMR in the US in Idaho. The plant is for the Carbon <b>Free</b> <b>Power</b> Project with Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems. [...] The company submitted designs to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in January 2017, and if approved hopes to complete its first plant in 2026.|$|E
2500|$|A {{potentially}} powerful {{means to}} reduce household energy consumption {{is to provide}} convenient real-time feedback to users so they can change their energy using behavior. Recently, low-cost energy feedback displays have become available. A study using a consumer-readable meter in 500 Ontario homes by Hydro One showed an average 6.5% drop in total electricity use when compared with a similarly sized control group. Hydro One subsequently offered <b>free</b> <b>power</b> monitors to 30,000 customers based {{on the success of}} the pilot. [...] Projects such as Google PowerMeter, take information from a smart meter and make it more readily available to users to help encourage conservation.|$|E

The cavity completely pierced {{the substance of the}} wall. Nothing but the paper on the other side prevented eye or hand from penetrating into the next room.|$|E

60|$|The town of Hillsborough, in 1829, gave Franklin Pierce {{his first}} public honor, by electing him its {{representative}} in the legislature of the state. His whole service in that body comprised four years, in the two latter {{of which he was}} elected Speaker by a vote of one hundred and fifty-five against fifty-eight for other candidates. This overpowering majority evinced the confidence which his character inspired, and which, during his whole career, it has invariably commanded, in advance of what might be termed positive proof, although the result has never failed to justify it. I still recollect his description of the feelings with which he entered on his arduous duties--the feverish night that preceded his taking the chair--the doubt, the struggle with himself--all ending in perfect calmness, full self-possession, and <b>free</b> <b>power</b> of action when the crisis actually came.|$|E
6000|$|Octavio. My son! {{of those}} old narrow {{ordinances}} [...] Let us not hold too lightly. They are weights [...] Of priceless value, which oppressed mankind [...] Tied to the volatile will of their oppressors. [...] For always formidable was the league [...] 65 [...] And partnership of <b>free</b> <b>power</b> with free will. [...] The way of ancient ordinance, though it winds, [...] Is yet no devious way. Straight forward goes [...] The lightning's path, and straight the fearful path [...] Of the cannon-ball. Direct it flies and rapid, [...] 70 [...] Shattering that it may reach, and shattering what it reaches. [...] My son! the road the human being travels, [...] That on which blessing comes and goes, doth follow [...] The river's course, the valley's playful windings, [...] Curves round the corn-field and the hill of vines, [...] 75 [...] Honouring the holy bounds of property! [...] And thus secure, though late, leads to its end.|$|E
60|$|The wise only possess ideas; {{the greater}} part of mankind are possessed by them. Robinson Crusoe was not {{conscious}} of the master impulse, even because it was his master, and had taken, as he says, full possession of him. When once the mind, in despite of the remonstrating conscience, has abandoned its <b>free</b> <b>power</b> to a haunting impulse or idea, then whatever tends to give depth and vividness to this idea or indefinite imagination, increases its despotism, and in the same proportion renders the reason and free will ineffectual. Now, fearful calamities, sufferings, horrors, and hair-breadth escapes will have this effect, far more than even sensual pleasure and prosperous incidents. Hence the evil consequences of sin in such cases, instead of retracting or deterring the sinner, goad him on to his destruction. This is the moral of Shakspeare's 'Macbeth', and the true solution of this paragraph,--not any overruling decree of divine wrath, but the tyranny of the sinner's own evil imagination, which he has voluntarily chosen as his master.|$|E
