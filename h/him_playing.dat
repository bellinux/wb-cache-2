5|$|Among {{the musicians}} who {{were quick to}} spot Saint-Saëns's talent were the composers Gioachino Rossini, Hector Berlioz and Franz Liszt, and the {{influential}} singer Pauline Viardot, who all encouraged him in his career. In early 1858 Saint-Saëns moved from Saint-Merri to the high-profile post of organist of La Madeleine, the official church of the Empire; Liszt heard <b>him</b> <b>playing</b> there and declared him the greatest organist in the world.|$|E

5|$|Outside cricket, Gilchrist is an {{ambassador}} for the charity World Vision in India, {{a country in}} which he is popular due to his cricketing achievements, and sponsors a boy whose father has died. He was approached in early 2005 by the US baseball franchise, the Boston Red Sox, with a view to <b>him</b> <b>playing</b> for them when his cricket career ended. However, he was selected for the 2007 Cricket World Cup and announced his retirement from Test and One-Day cricket in early 2008.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{came through}} the youth ranks at Chesterfield, who had {{originally}} spotted <b>him</b> <b>playing</b> local football. He broke into the first-team squad in 2001 and made his debut a year later. He was forced to undergo knee surgery in 2005 and has suffered several injuries during his career. He was loaned out to Lincoln City in 2008 and was released by Chesterfield after seven seasons at the club, after which he moved down to play in non-League football with Gainsborough Trinity, York City, Mansfield Town, Lincoln City, F.C. Halifax Town, Wrexham, Guiseley and Alfreton Town.|$|E
5|$|The Kids Are Alright {{was also}} {{completed}} in 1979. It was a retrospective of the band's career, directed by Jeff Stein. The film included {{footage of the}} band at Monterey, Woodstock and Pontiac, and clips from the Smothers Brothers' show and Russell Harty Plus. Moon had died one week after seeing the rough cut with Daltrey. The film contains the Shepperton concert, and an audio track of <b>him</b> <b>playing</b> over silent footage of himself {{was the last time}} he ever played the drums.|$|E

5|$|The voice cast {{was heavy}} with {{television}} situation-comedy {{stars of the}} time: Flik was voiced by Dave Foley (from NewsRadio), Princess Atta was voiced by Julia Louis-Dreyfus (from Seinfeld), Molt was voiced by Richard Kind (from Spin City), Slim was voiced by David Hyde Pierce (from Frasier) and Dim was voiced by Brad Garrett (from Everybody Loves Raymond). Joe Ranft, member of Pixar's story team, played Heimlich the caterpillar {{at the suggestion of}} Lasseter's wife, Nancy, who had heard <b>him</b> <b>playing</b> the character on a scratch vocal track.|$|E
5|$|A few teams {{expressed}} interest in St. Louis. He chose to sign with the Tampa Bay Lightning as he believed {{they were the most}} likely to give <b>him</b> <b>playing</b> time in the NHL. He made his debut with the team on October 6, 2000. He struggled at first, failing to score a goal in the first six weeks of the season and again found himself out of the lineup at times. Realizing that he was at a career crossroads, St. Louis abandoned the changes to his game that his NHL coaches had impressed on him, trusting his own instincts. He scored his first goal of the season in late November, and finished the season with 18 goals and 40 points – 34 of which came after December 1.|$|E
5|$|Back in the League, Hollis took Charsley's {{place in}} goal, as {{customary}} in the latter's absence. The heavy ground did not suit the visitors, Grimsby Town, and the Small Heath forwards' hard-working combination play brought them victory by eight goals to three. The following week, the Coventry Road ground hosted benefit matches for striking ironplate-workers. Around 1,500 spectators watched a match between tinplate- and ironplate-workers' elevens, {{followed by a}} second between teams raised by former Aston Villa captain Archie Hunter, whose poor health prevented <b>him</b> <b>playing,</b> and the recently retired Small Heath forward Eddy Stanley, who led his team to a 9–3 victory. Small Heath went into March with a four-point lead over Darwen, each club having only two League games left to play, but the former's goal average was so much superior that Sheffield United, in third place, ten points behind with five games in hand, were the only team still able to overhaul them.|$|E

50|$|A 19-year-old typist at {{the time}} of the incident, Steinhagen had {{developed}} an obsession with Waitkus after seeing <b>him</b> <b>play</b> as first baseman with the Chicago Cubs. According to a 1949 Time magazine article, she had seen <b>him</b> <b>play</b> in 1946, although John Theodore's 2002 biography of Waitkus indicates she later told her doctor she first saw Waitkus on April 27, 1947.|$|R
5|$|Birmingham {{also had}} doubts over their selection. Captain Len Boyd had {{for some time}} been {{suffering}} from a debilitating back problem, and relied on injections to keep <b>him</b> <b>playing.</b> He missed five of the last seven games of the season, but was passed fit on the Wednesday before the game. Fellow wing half Roy Warhurst had injured his thigh in the sixth-round match and played no further part in the season, while Badham, who damaged an ankle {{three weeks before the}} final, travelled on the Thursday {{with the rest of the}} team to their base in Twyford, Berkshire. Jeff Hall was struggling with a virus. When manager Turner announced his team on the eve of the match, Boyd took Warhurst's position at left-half, Badham, who had proved an able deputy in the semi-final, was omitted, and the inexperienced 22-year-old Johnny Newman came in on the right.|$|E
5|$|Having been {{in their}} youth schemes {{since the age of}} 10, Campbell signed for the Manchester United Academy on 1 July 2004. He made an {{immediate}} impact, scoring 14 goals in 22 starts for the Under-18s in the 2004–05 season. His performances for the youth team also led to <b>him</b> <b>playing</b> five times for the reserves, for whom he scored once. He signed his first professional contract with Manchester United on 22 March 2006, and he was named as a substitute for Roy Keane's testimonial match at Old Trafford on 9 May 2006, in which he was a 75th minute replacement for Kieran Richardson. Later that summer, he scored his first goal for the club after coming on as a substitute for Wayne Rooney in a friendly against Macclesfield Town.|$|E
5|$|Having {{been turned}} down by several {{professional}} clubs, including Newcastle United, Sunderland, Derby County and Southport, Bruce {{was about to start}} work as an apprentice plumber at the Swan Hunter dockyard when he was offered a trial by Third Division club Gillingham, whose manager Gerry Summers had seen <b>him</b> <b>playing</b> for Wallsend in an international youth tournament. He travelled down to Kent with another player from the Wallsend club, Peter Beardsley, but although Gillingham signed Bruce as an apprentice, they turned Beardsley away. At the time Bruce was playing as a midfielder, but he was switched to the centre of defence by the head of Gillingham's youth scheme, Bill Collins, whom Bruce cites as the single biggest influence on his career.|$|E

5|$|In 1980 Byard was {{the subject}} of a short {{documentary}} film, Anything for Jazz, which featured <b>him</b> <b>playing,</b> teaching and with his family. By the 1980s his main instrument remained the piano, and he still played both alto and tenor saxophones, but he had stopped playing the other instruments that he used to use professionally – bass, drums, guitar, trombone, and trumpet, although he still taught all of them. In the same period, he was often heard in New York playing solo, in duos, or in trios. In 1988 he played with a band founded by Mingus' widow to perform the bassist's compositions – the Mingus Big Band. Byard played and recorded with a former student of his, Ricky Ford, from 1989 to 1991, and continued to play and teach during the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|In July 2008, it was {{announced}} that Grint would star in the drama film Cherrybomb with Robert Sheehan and Kimberley Nixon. Grint found shooting this film very different from the Harry Potter films since he had to adjust to doing a dozen scenes per day. Grint's character Malachy, a worker at Belfast goes to great lengths to impress his boss's daughter, with whom he is infatuated. This film, like his next project, would involve <b>him</b> <b>playing</b> violent roles. Despite premiering at the 2009 Berlin International Film Festival, the film was initially unable to find a distributor. An online campaign by Grint's fans was credited with helping to secure a deal for distribution in the UK in 2010.|$|E
5|$|McNichol {{was born}} in Kilmarnock, Ayrshire. His father, Danny, {{died when he was}} five, so McNichol and seven {{siblings}} were raised by their mother, Catherine. He attended St Joseph's School in Kilmarnock, and started work as a messenger boy for a local draper's shop when he left school. His shop work stopped <b>him</b> <b>playing</b> football on Saturdays, but he was able to play some midweek football for Junior club Hurlford United. When he was taken on at the local bus garage as an apprentice motor mechanic, he became available on Saturdays as well. Hurlford paid him ten shillings a game, nearly as much as his apprentice's wages. During the Second World War, McNichol was called up to the Fleet Air Arm as a mechanic, but was able to play friendly matches for Inverness-based club Clachnacuddin. Because of the number of professional players stationed around the country, such matches were played at a fairly high standard.|$|E

5|$|Mustafizur was {{selected}} by Lahore Qalandars in the Pakistan Super League. The BCB was reluctant to let <b>him</b> <b>play</b> there. However, the issue was resolved when Rahman got a shoulder injury in early 2016, thus preventing <b>him</b> from <b>playing</b> in the PSL.|$|R

5|$|Selected by the Portland Winter Hawks of the Western Hockey League (WHL) 33rd {{overall in}} the 2005 Canadian Hockey League (CHL) Import Draft, Hansen moved to North America and joined the club for the 2005–06 season. Hansen's {{proficiency}} in English {{played a part in}} Winter Hawks general manager Ken Hodge selecting him. Canucks management also wanted <b>him</b> <b>playing</b> major junior in order to better his transition to the more physical North American style of play. Becoming the first Danish player to compete in the WHL, Hansen scored at a point-per-game pace, leading all rookies with 64 points. He continued his scoring pace in the playoffs with 13 points in 12 games as Portland was eliminated in the second round.|$|E
5|$|A leading {{member of}} the Yorkshire team which {{achieved}} {{a high level of}} success in the time he played, Macaulay was a volatile character who played aggressively. He left a job at a bank to become a professional cricketer, making his first-class debut aged 23 as a fast bowler. Meeting limited success, he altered style to deliver off spin in addition to his pace bowling. This proved so effective that he was chosen to play for England in Test matches. However, his perceived poor attitude towards the game, and an unsuccessful match in the 1926 Ashes probably prevented <b>him</b> <b>playing</b> more Tests. His form slumped following injuries in the late 1920s, but a recovery in the early 1930s led to a recall by England, although he broke down in his second match back. Another injury in 1934 made cricket difficult for him and his first-class career ended in 1935, although he continued playing club cricket until the Second World War. A pilot officer in the Royal Air Force, he died of pneumonia on active service in the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|During the war Hirst, {{along with}} Rhodes and their team-mate Schofield Haigh, {{worked in a}} munitions factory in Huddersfield. Hirst and Rhodes were paid by Yorkshire to play in war-time cricket matches on {{a certain number of}} Saturdays. Hirst played in the Bradford League, and became known among cricketers for {{accepting}} minimal fees from financially struggling clubs. When first-class cricket restarted in 1919, Hirst resumed playing for Yorkshire. In the first match of the season he hit an aggressive unbeaten 180 against MCC, to secure a draw for the county; he followed this with two more centuries in {{the first two weeks of}} the season. Although his form later faltered, he played some substantial innings in difficult circumstances and ended the season with 1,441 runs at an average of 38.94. He bowled infrequently, taking 18 wickets at 29.27. During this season, Hirst accepted the position of coach at Eton College. In the last match of the season, at Scarborough, he was given a warm reception by the crowd, who did not expect to see <b>him</b> <b>playing</b> for Yorkshire again. However, he appeared on occasions during the school holidays in the next two seasons, although he did not score any centuries, did not average more than 24 with the bat and took only 21 wickets in total. At the end of the 1921 season Hirst retired as a Yorkshire player, and made what was expected to be his final first-class appearance in a Scarborough Festival match, in which he captained the Players against the Gentlemen. On the last day of the match, Hirst's 50th birthday, he took the final two wickets to secure victory for his side. The crowd gathered outside the pavilion and demanded to see him; he gave a farewell speech, and was moved by the reception given to him.|$|E
