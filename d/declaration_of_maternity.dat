40|$|This {{article is}} {{dedicated}} to the phenomenon <b>of</b> representation <b>of</b> <b>maternity</b> as a branch of research using theoretical developments of the brightest representative of the postmodern school, the French scholar J. Kristeva. The author studies the possibility of considering the phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>maternity,</b> addressing gender’s theories and concepts of feminist’s thought, and their interpretations through the «active» nature <b>of</b> <b>maternity.</b> The problem <b>of</b> <b>maternity</b> was addressed both by the ancient Greek’s thinkers as Plato of modern and postmodern scientists using philosophical approaches and attitudes. Among the various theories and concepts which are related to the study <b>of</b> <b>maternity</b> as a phenomenon the attention is attracted the views of by J. Kristeva, the philosopher and psychoanalyst, representatives of post-structuralism. In philosophical understanding <b>of</b> <b>maternity,</b> Kristeva uses psychoanalysis, semiotics, linguistics, etc., in which Kristeva skillfully integrates her own theoretical developments. The article is focused on the author’s judgment that the relevance of studying the phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>maternity</b> is due to those social challenges of the beginning of the XXI century, which {{led to the formation of}} new institutional currents in the studies <b>of</b> <b>maternity</b> and new processes of reflective thinking, which are based on studying discourses and narratives in the parent’s relationships...|$|R
40|$|PurposeTo discuss {{cultural}} {{safety and}} critique the provision <b>of</b> culturally appropriate <b>maternity</b> services to remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women in Australia. ProcedureThe literature and policies around ‘culture’ and ‘cultural safety’ are discussed {{and applied to}} the provision <b>of</b> <b>maternity</b> services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women in remote areas of Australia. FindingsThe current provision <b>of</b> <b>maternity</b> services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women, particularly those living in remote Australia, appears largely inadequate. The provision <b>of</b> culturally safe <b>maternity</b> care requires health system reform at all levels including: the individual practitioner response; the educational preparation of practitioners; the delivery <b>of</b> <b>maternity</b> services {{and the development of}} policy at local, state and national level. This paper considers the changes that can be made from the individual practitioner through to the design and implementation <b>of</b> <b>maternity</b> services. Principal conclusionsCultural safety provides a useful framework to improve the delivery <b>of</b> <b>maternity</b> services to remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women and their families...|$|R
40|$|The bachelor's thesis "The Current State <b>of</b> <b>Maternity</b> Leave and the Labour Market in the United States: Goals and Reality" {{deals with}} a model <b>of</b> <b>maternity</b> leave in the United States. This model {{can be seen as}} very unique in many ways, {{especially}} due to its form and problematic historical development. The United States {{was one of the last}} industrialized countries codifying a certain form <b>of</b> <b>maternity</b> leave. The result was defined as an unpaid gender neutral maternity leave, a part of a broader policy concept called a family leave. The thesis explores the formation of the current state <b>of</b> <b>maternity</b> leave in the United States and its goals which compares to the actual reality of the present labour market situation. The thesis discovers that the initially declared objectives weren't met. The current state <b>of</b> <b>maternity</b> leave is very exclusive. It also reinforces inequality based on race, gender and family income in relation to the labour market...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Primary {{maternity}} {{care services}} are globally provided according to various organisational models. Two models {{are common in}} Finland: a maternity health clinic and an integrated maternity and child health clinic. The {{aim of this study}} was to clarify whether there is a relation between the organisational model <b>of</b> the <b>maternity</b> health clinics and the utilisation <b>of</b> <b>maternity</b> care services, and certain maternal and perinatal health outcomes. Methods: A comparative, register-based cross-sectional design was used. The data of women (N = 2741) who had given birth in the Turku University Hospital area between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2009 were collected from the Finnish Medical Birth Register. Comparisons were made between the women who were clients <b>of</b> the <b>maternity</b> health clinics and integrated maternity and child health clinics. Results: There were no clinically significant differences between the clients <b>of</b> <b>maternity</b> health clinics and integrated maternity and child health clinics regarding the utilisation <b>of</b> <b>maternity</b> care services or the explored health outcomes. Conclusions: The organisational model <b>of</b> the <b>maternity</b> health clinic does not impact the utilisation <b>of</b> <b>maternity</b> care services or maternal and perinatal health outcomes.

For the interpretation of the results, {{it is important to note}} that the variable is bounded upward. Until 1986, the maximum duration of leave was 6 months by law; in 1988, it was extended to 12 months, in 1990 to 18 months, and since 1991, it has been 3 years. The interesting feature <b>of</b> <b>maternity</b> leave is that within the maximum period <b>of</b> <b>maternity</b> leave, the parent has the right to return to the same firm (job protection).|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} analyze the {{implementation}} <b>of</b> <b>maternity</b> insurance at district health office in Buol regency in 2012. This study was a qualitative study using case study approach. The samples {{in this study were}} the parties involved in the implementation <b>of</b> <b>maternity</b> insurance at district health office in Buol regency and at the health center. The sampling was conducted by purposive sampling technique with a sample size of 23 people. The results showed that during the phase of funding: the distribution of funds were lately paid i. e. at the end of 2012; the amount of service rates was 25 % deductions for service providers; and for fund management, {{it was found that the}} process of verification of the claimed file was very difficult. During the phase of care benefits package in terms of availability of health care, providers became an obstacle in the implementation <b>of</b> the <b>maternity</b> insurance. During the phase of indicator of success in terms of supervision, there was a lack of supervision from the program manager <b>of</b> <b>maternity</b> insurance that opened some problems in the implementation <b>of</b> <b>maternity</b> insurance in Buol district. From this study it can be concluded that the phase of funding, benefits package services, and indicators of success still need attention. This study suggests the District Government of Buol to re-visit the policy decisions regarding the amount of fees that had been set for the implementation <b>of</b> the <b>maternity</b> insurance. To make maternity insurance to be implemented optimally, the midwives need to perform additional services that can be implemented well. Buols district health offices is expected to optimize the implementation <b>of</b> <b>maternity</b> insurance by improving the mechanism of disbursement of verification process and increasing the supervision by the program manager <b>of</b> <b>maternity</b> insurance. And for service providers in order to implement the procedures <b>of</b> <b>maternity</b> insurance proccess, they should take into account the condition of the community served.

30|$|The {{existing}} empirical literature {{addressing the}} effects <b>of</b> <b>maternity</b> leave uses quasi-experimental evidence, cross-sectional evidence and quantitative macro evidence.

Our paper addresses all three questions in a unified model and then shows the effects of moving from a US minimal maternity leave provision to a more generous provision similar to policies observed in Scandinavia.|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{relationship}} between the length <b>of</b> <b>maternity</b> leave and the physical and psychological health of the family. Using a reform of the parental leave scheme in Denmark that increased the number of weeks of leave with full benefit compensation, we estimate the effect of the length <b>of</b> <b>maternity</b> leave on a range of health indicators including the number of hospital admissions for both mother and child and the probability of the mother receiving antidepressants. The reform led to an increase in average post-birth <b>maternity</b> leave <b>of</b> 32 days. We find limited evidence that the increase in the length <b>of</b> <b>maternity</b> leave matters for child or maternal health outcomes and thus we complement the existing evidence on maternity leave expansions that tends to find limited effects on children's later developmental, educational, and labor market outcomes.

40|$|Using {{correspondence}} testing, {{we investigate}} whether gender access gap in job interviews {{is due to}} different effects of present or future family responsibilities on expected productivity {{of male and female}} job applicants or if it is due to a taste for discrimination. We have sent job applications of three pairs of candidates to the same job advertisements in the French financial sector. Using three pairs of applicants, we compare the effect on the gender access gap to job interviews of a high probability of maternity/paternity (1); high family responsibilities (2); neither risk <b>of</b> <b>maternity</b> or family responsibility (3). Within each pair, the applicants' characteristics are similar except for their gender. We find significant discrimination against women with a high probability <b>of</b> <b>maternity</b> for highly qualified administrative jobs. In the other cases, unequal treatment between genders is not significant. So, controlling for female probability <b>of</b> <b>maternity,</b> we find no significant unequal treatment between genders. We conclude that female employment suffers more from their probability <b>of</b> <b>maternity</b> (and their anticipated career interruptions) than family responsibilities alone. So, statistical discrimination due to female probability <b>of</b> <b>maternity</b> exists on the French labour market. An appropriate economic policy may correct it by reducing firms' cost due to maternity leave. Field experiment; hiring discrimination. ...|$|R
