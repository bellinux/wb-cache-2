5|$|In 1848–49 a cholera {{epidemic}} killed 14,601 {{people in}} London and overwhelmed the burial system completely. Bodies were left stacked in <b>heaps</b> awaiting burial, and even relatively recent graves were exhumed {{to make way}} for new burials.|$|E
5|$|Lead rakes, the spoil <b>heaps</b> {{of ancient}} mining activity, form another {{distinctive}} habitat in the White Peak, supporting {{a range of}} rare metallophyte plants, including the spring sandwort (Minuartia verna; also known as leadwort), alpine pennycress (Thlaspi caerulescens) and mountain pansy (Viola lutea).|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} step, a sorted array {{is created by}} {{repeatedly}} removing the largest element from the <b>heap</b> (the root of the <b>heap),</b> and inserting it into the array.

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} new {{abstraction}} method for <b>heap</b> structures {{that is based}} on hyperedge replacement grammars. We use labeled hypergraphs as abstract representation of <b>heap</b> structures. A given hypergraph replacement grammar induces a set of concrete <b>heap</b> structures from a hypergraph. Our technique allows to abstract and concretize the <b>heap</b> partially. Thus the <b>heap</b> parts of high entropy can be left concrete while we abstract from those <b>heap</b> parts that are of a regular shape maintaining structural information. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{most current}} implementations, memory {{allocations}} and deallocations are performed by user-level library code which keeps <b>heap</b> meta-data (<b>heap</b> structure information) and the application’s <b>heap</b> data stored in an interleaved fashion {{in the same}} address space. Such implementations are inherently unsafe: they allow attackers to use application’s vulnerabilities (e. g. lack of heap-based buffer over-flow checking) to corrupt its <b>heap</b> meta-data in order to execute malicious code or cause denial-of-service. In this dissertation, we propose an approach where <b>heap</b> meta-data and <b>heap</b> data are protected separately. Our first solution exploits existing inter-process protection mechanisms through <b>Heap</b> Server, a separate process that maintains <b>heap</b> meta-data {{on behalf of the}} application and runs in parallel with it. To perform memory allocation and deallocation, the application sends requests to the Server, which responds to the requests and updates the meta-data. Since the <b>heap</b> meta-data is kept in the <b>Heap</b> Server’s address space, attacks on the application can no longer corrupt it. <b>Heap</b> Server is directly implementable in current systems because it does not requir...|$|R

40|$|These notes {{discuss the}} classic {{implicit}} <b>heap</b> data structure [1, 2]. A <b>heap</b> (or priority queue) is a data structure {{that contains a}} set of items, each with a realvalued key, and that supports (at least) the following operations: • make-heap: return a new, empty <b>heap.</b> • insert(x, H) : insert item x, with predefined key, into <b>heap</b> H. • find-min(H) : return an item in <b>heap</b> H of minimum key. • delete-min(H) : delete from <b>heap</b> H an item of minimum key, and return it; return null if the <b>heap</b> is empty. An implicit <b>heap</b> is an implementation of a <b>heap</b> consisting of a complete binary tree whose nodes contain the <b>heap</b> items, one node per item. The items are arranged in <b>heap</b> order: every node contains an item with a key no smaller than the key of the item in its parent, {{if it has a}} parent. Thus the root contains an item of minimum key, so a find-min takes O(1) time. We number the nodes level-by-level: the root is node 1, its children are nodes 2 and 3, the childre...|$|R

The name Brownhills, however, is not recorded before the 17th century. The most popular suggestion for the origin of the name is that it refers to the early mining spoil <b>heaps</b> which dotted the area.|$|E

5|$|Several {{methods are}} used to {{separate}} potassium salts from sodium and magnesium compounds. The most-used method is fractional precipitation using the solubility differences of the salts at different temperatures. Electrostatic separation of the ground salt mixture is also used in some mines. The resulting sodium and magnesium waste is either stored underground or piled up in slag <b>heaps.</b> Most of the mined potassium mineral ends up as potassium chloride after processing. The mineral industry refers to potassium chloride either as potash, muriate of potash, or simply MOP.|$|E
40|$|Researchers have {{proposed}} many tools and techniques that work by traversing the <b>heap,</b> including checkpointing sys-tems, <b>heap</b> profilers, <b>heap</b> assertion checkers, and dynamic software updating systems. Yet building a <b>heap</b> traversal for C remains difficult, {{and to our}} knowledge extant services have used their own application-specific traversals. This paper presents C-strider, a framework for writing C <b>heap</b> traversals and transformations. Writing a basic C-strider ser-vice requires implementing only four callbacks; C-strider then generates a program-specific traversal that invokes the callbacks as each <b>heap</b> location is visited. Critically, C-strider is type aware—it tracks types as it walks the <b>heap,</b> so every callback is supplied with the exact type of the as-sociated location. We used C-strider to implement <b>heap</b> se-rialization, dynamic software updating, <b>heap</b> checking, and profiling, and then applied the resulting traversals to several programs. We found C-strider requires little programmer effort, and the resulting services are efficient and effective. 1...|$|R

5|$|At {{the start}} of the War of the First Coalition Tarrare joined the French Revolutionary Army. With {{military}} rations unable to satisfy his large appetite, he would eat any available food from gutters and refuse <b>heaps</b> but his condition still deteriorated through hunger. Suffering from exhaustion, he was hospitalised and became the subject of a series of medical experiments to test his eating capacity, in which, among other things, he ate a meal intended for 15 people in a single sitting, ate live cats, snakes, lizards and puppies, and swallowed an eel whole without chewing. Despite his unusual diet, he was of normal size and appearance, and showed no signs of mental illness other than what was described as an apathetic temperament.|$|E
5|$|Chastened by this experience, {{he agreed}} to submit to any {{procedure}} that would cure his appetite, and was treated with laudanum, tobacco pills, wine vinegar and soft-boiled eggs. The procedures failed, and doctors could not keep him on a controlled diet; he would sneak {{out of the hospital}} to scavenge for offal in gutters, rubbish <b>heaps</b> and outside butchers' shops, and attempted to drink the blood of other patients in the hospital and to eat the corpses in the hospital morgue. After being suspected of eating a toddler he was ejected from the hospital. He reappeared four years later in Versailles suffering from severe tuberculosis, and died shortly afterwards, following a lengthy bout of exudative diarrhoea.|$|E

40|$|<b>Heap</b> Space Analysis for Java Bytecode This article {{presents}} a <b>heap</b> space analysis for (sequential) Java bytecode. The analysis generates <b>heap</b> space cost relations which define at compile-time the <b>heap</b> consumption {{of a program}} {{as a function of}} its data size. These relations can be used to obtain upper bounds on the <b>heap</b> space allocated during the execution of the different methods. In addition, we describe how to refine the cost relations, by relying on escape analysis, in order {{to take into account the}} <b>heap</b> space that can be safely deallocated by the garbage collector upon exit from a corresponding method. These refined cost relations are then used to infer upper bounds on the active <b>heap</b> space upon methods return. Example applications for the analysis consider inference of constant <b>heap</b> usage and <b>heap</b> usage proportional to the data size (including polynomial and exponential <b>heap</b> consumption). Our prototype implementation is reported and demonstrated by means of a series of examples which illustrate how the analysis naturally encompasses standard data-structures like lists, trees and arrays with several dimensions written in object-oriented programming style...|$|R
5|$|One of {{the writers}} who most enchanted Hańska was the French novelist Honoré de Balzac. After laboring in pseudonymous obscurity for ten years, Balzac {{published}} Les Chouans (The Chouans) in 1829.

Hańska was intrigued by the glowing portrayal of the female protagonist, driven by true love to protect the object of her desire. She also enjoyed Balzac's Physiologie du mariage (The Physiology of Marriage), also published in 1829, which <b>heaps</b> satirical scorn on husbands and celebrates the virtue of married women.|$|E
5|$|Through his {{involvement}} with the Design and Industries Association Holden met Frank Pick, {{general manager of the}} Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL). Holden at the time had no experience in designing for transport, but this would change through his collaboration with Pick. In 1923, Pick commissioned Holden to design a façade for a side entrance at Westminster tube station. This was followed in 1924 with an appointment to design the UERL's pavilion for the British Empire Exhibition. Also in 1924, Pick commissioned Holden to design seven new stations in south London for the extension of the City and South London Railway (now part of the Northern line) from Clapham Common to Morden. The designs replaced a set by the UERL's own architect, Stanley <b>Heaps,</b> which Pick had found unsatisfactory. The designs reflect the simple modernist style he was using in France for the war cemeteries; double-height ticket halls are clad in plain Portland stone framing a glazed screen, each adapted to suit the street corner sites of most of the stations. The screens feature the Underground roundel made up in coloured glass panels and are divided by stone columns surmounted by capitals formed as a three-dimensional version of the roundel. Holden also advised <b>Heaps</b> on new façades for a number of the existing stations on the line and produced the design for a new entrance at Bond Street station on the Central London Railway.|$|E
5|$|Following this incident, Tarrare {{was desperate}} to avoid further {{military}} service, {{and returned to the}} hospital, telling Percy that he would attempt any possible cure for his appetite. Percy treated him with laudanum without success; further treatments with wine vinegar and tobacco pills were likewise unsuccessful. Following these failures, Percy fed Tarrare large quantities of soft-boiled eggs, but this also failed to suppress his appetite. Efforts to keep him on any kind of controlled diet failed; he would sneak out of the hospital to scavenge for offal outside butchers' shops and to fight stray dogs for carrion in gutters, alleys and rubbish <b>heaps.</b> He was also caught several times within the hospital drinking from patients undergoing bloodletting, and attempting to eat the bodies in the hospital mortuary. Other doctors believed that Tarrare was mentally ill and pressed for him to be transferred to a lunatic asylum, but Percy was keen to continue his experiments and Tarrare remained in the military hospital.|$|E
