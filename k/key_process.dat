5|$|Natural {{selection}} acts on the phenotype, or {{the observable}} characteristics of an organism, but the genetic (heritable) basis of any phenotype {{that gives a}} reproductive advantage may become more common in a population. Over time, this process can result in populations that specialise for particular ecological niches (microevolution) and may eventually result in speciation (the emergence of new species, macroevolution). In other words, natural selection is a <b>key</b> <b>process</b> {{in the evolution of}} a population. Natural selection can be contrasted with artificial selection, in which humans intentionally choose specific traits, whereas in natural selection there is no intentional choice.|$|E

40|$|The idea of process-managed {{organization}} strives {{after the}} situation when all {{processes in the}} organization {{are linked to the}} customer needs as directly as possible. Thus, the general classification of processes in the organization distinguishes mainly between: • <b>Key</b> <b>processes,</b> i. e. those processes in the organization which are linked directly to the customer, covering the whole business cycle from expression of the customer need to its satisfaction with the product / service. • Supporting processes, which are linked to the customer indirectly- by means of <b>key</b> <b>processes</b> which they are supporting with particular products / services. Such a view of the behavior of the organization {{is quite different from the}} traditional one. Mainly, the <b>key</b> <b>processes</b> represent an unusual view of communications and collaboration within the organization. In traditionally managed organizations the organization structure reflects just the specialization of work; it is static and hierarchical. The concept of <b>key</b> <b>processes</b> brings the necessary dynamics to the system – <b>key</b> <b>processes</b> often change according to the customer needs, while supporting ones are relatively stable (the nature of the work is relatively independent o...|$|R

500|$|Weber {{described}} many ideal {{types of}} public administration and government in his masterpiece Economy and Society (1922). His critical {{study of the}} bureaucratisation of society {{became one of the}} most enduring parts of his work. It was Weber who began the studies of bureaucracy and whose works led to the popularisation of this term. Many aspects of modern public administration go back to him and a classic, hierarchically organised civil service of the Continental type is called [...] "Weberian civil service". As the most efficient and rational way of organising, bureaucratisation for Weber was the key part of the rational-legal authority and furthermore, he saw it as the <b>key</b> <b>process</b> in the ongoing rationalisation of the Western society.|$|E

40|$|The {{modelling}} of {{the decision-making}} in the <b>key</b> <b>processes</b> {{of the modern}} industrial organizations requires methods and tools adapted to their complexity. This is why we propose to use and organize the concept of multi-grid developed {{within the framework of}} GRAI method. We identify initially the <b>key</b> <b>processes</b> developed in the situations of industrial management. Then we present the concept of the GRAI grids and multi-grids and the various modes of organization of the grids. We end to a reflexion on the way of articulating these modes to model the most complex industrial structures, such as the supply chains. We illustrate our paper with a complex industrial example in which the informational and decisional exchanges of customer-supplier type are important. We conclude on the more complex mode called “interrelated multi-grids ” adapted to the modelling of the <b>key</b> <b>processes</b> pointed out in the paper.
