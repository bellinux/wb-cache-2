40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} SAR as a <b>dosimetric</b> <b>quantity</b> for EMF bioeffects, {{and identify}} ways {{for increasing the}} precision in EMF dosimetry and bioactivity assessment. METHODS: We discuss the interaction of man-made electromagnetic waves with biological matter and calculate the energy transferred to a single free ion within a cell. We analyze the physics and biology of SAR and evaluate the methods of its estimation. We discuss the experimentally observed non-linearity between electromagnetic exposure and biological effect. RESULTS: WE FIND THAT: a) The energy absorbed by living matter during exposure to environmentally accounted EMFs is normally well below the thermal level. b) All existing methods for SAR estimation, especially those based upon tissue conductivity and internal electric field, have serious deficiencies. c) The only method to estimate SAR without large error is by measuring temperature increases within biological tissue, which normally are negligible for environmental EMF intensities, and thus cannot be measured. CONCLUSIONS: SAR actually refers to thermal effects, while {{the vast majority of}} the recorded biological effects from man-made non-ionizing environmental radiation are non-thermal. Even if SAR could be accurately estimated for a whole tissue, organ, or body, the biological/health effect is determined by tiny amounts of energy/power absorbed by specific biomolecules, which cannot be calculated. Moreover, it depends upon field parameters not taken into account in SAR calculation. Thus, SAR should not be used as the primary <b>dosimetric</b> <b>quantity,</b> but used only as a complementary measure, always reporting the estimating method and the corresponding error. Radiation/field intensity along with additional physical parameters (such as frequency, modulation etc) which can be directly and in any case more accurately measured on the surface of biological tissues, should constitute the primary measure for EMF exposures, in spite of similar uncertainty to predict the biological effect due to non-linearity...|$|E

Resumo Objective: Aiming at {{contributing to the}} knowledge on doses in computed tomography (CT), this study has the objective of determining <b>dosimetric</b> <b>quantities</b> associated with pediatric abdominal CT scans, comparing the data with diagnostic reference levels (DRL). Materials and Methods: The study was developed with a Toshiba Asteion single-slice CT scanner and a GE BrightSpeed multi-slice CT unit in two hospitals. Measurements were performed with a pencil-type ionization chamber and a 16 cm-diameter polymethylmethacrylate trunk phantom. Results: No significant difference was observed in the values for weighted air kerma index (CW), but the differences were relevant in values for volumetric air kerma index (CVOL), air kerma-length product (PKL,CT) and effective dose. Conclusion: Only the CW values were lower than the DRL, suggesting that dose optimization might not be necessary. However, PKL,CT and effective dose values stressed that there still is room for reducing pediatric radiation doses.

However, this notion is not rigorously defined, and its definition would require the somewhat arbitrary choice of specified energy cut-off values for different types of particles.

In the millimeter-wave frequencies, the <b>dosimetric</b> <b>quantity</b> for human exposure to electromagnetic fields changes from the specific absorption rate to incident power density.

The power density averaged over one squarecentimeter in free space and the peak temperature elevation in tissue at 28 GHz have good correlation. The peak temperature elevation indicated by the power density averaged one square-centimeter also agrees well with the peak temperature elevation induced by the plane waves.

40|$|Abstract–Modern {{radiation}} protection {{is based on}} the principles of justification, limitation, and optimisation. Assessment of radiation risks for individuals or groups of individuals is, however, not a primary objective of radiological protection. The implementation of the principles of limitation and optimisation requires an appropriate quantification of radia-tion exposure. The International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) has introduced effective dose as the principal radiological protection quantity to be used for setting and controlling dose limits for stochastic effects in the regulatory context, and for the practical implementation of the optimisation principle. Effective dose is the tissue weighted sum of radiation weighted organ and tissue doses of a reference person from exposure to external irradiations and internal emitters. The specific normalised values of tissue weighting factors are defined by ICRP for individual tissues, and used as an approximate age- and sex-averaged representation of the relative contribution of each tis-sue to the radiation detriment of stochastic effects from whole-body low-linear energy transfer irradiations. The rounded values of tissue and radiation weighting factors are chosen by ICRP on the basis of available scientific data from radiation epidemiology and radiation biology, and they are therefore subject to adjustment as new scientific infor-mation becomes available.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the dosimetric {{characteristics of a}} two-dimensional (2 D) diode array detector irradiated with passively scattered proton beams. Materials and Methods: A diode array detector, MapCHECK (Model 1175, Sun Nuclear, Melbourne, FL, USA) was characterized in passive-scattered proton beams. The relative sensitivity of the diodes and absolute dose calibration were determined using a 250 MeV beam. The pristine Bragg curves (PBCs) measured by MapCHECK diodes were {{compared with those of}} an ion chamber using a range shift method. The water-equivalent thickness (WET) of the diode array detector’s intrinsic buildup also was determined. The inverse square dependence, linearity, and other proton <b>dosimetric</b> <b>quantities</b> measured by MapCHECK were also compared with those of the ion chambers. The change in the absolute dose response of the MapCHECK as a function of accumulated radiation dose was used as an indicator of radiation damage to the diodes. 2 D dose distribution with and without the compensator were measured and compared with the treatment planning system (TPS) calculations. Results: The WET of the MapCHECK diode’s buildup was determined to be 1. 7 cm. The MapCHECK-measured PBC were virtually identical to those measured by a parallel-plate ion chamber for 160, 180, and 250 MeV proton beams. The inverse square results of the MapCHECK were within ± 0. 4 % of the ion chamber results. The linearity of MapCHECK results was within 1 % of those from the ion chamber as measured in the range between 10 and 300 MU. All other <b>dosimetric</b> <b>quantities</b> were within 1. 3 % of the ion chamber results. The 2 D dose distributions for non-clinical fields without compensator and the patient treatment fields with the compensator were consistent with the TPS results. The absolute dose response of the MapCHECK was changed by 7. 4 % after an accumulated dose increased by 170 Gy. Conclusions: The MapCHECK is a convenient and useful tool for 2 D dose distribution measurements using passively scattered proton beams.

The design methodology aims at a well-matched system with a maximized power-transfer efficiency for mid-range applications. The system consists of two identical resonant coils driven by high-quality factor loops. The proposed design criteria allows obtaining maximum achievable transfer efficiency and impedance matching at any defined distance without any external matching circuits connected to the driven loops. For validation purposes, a printed WPT system at 10 MHz is fabricated targeting 1 -m distance between the transmitting and receiving sides. Its performances in terms of reflection and transmission coefficients, as well as in terms of generated electric and magnetic fields, have been characterized numerically and experimentally. The impact of human body presence on the system has also been investigated observing the splitting in two frequencies of the common resonant frequency of the coils.

STPR vary only little with depth except close to the total range of the ion and they can be accurately approximated with an analytical formula. The amplitude of the FCF depends on the non-elastic nuclear interactions and it is unity if these interactions are turned off in the simulation. Fluence corrections are of the order of a percent becoming more pronounced for larger depths resulting in dose difference of the order of 5 % around 25 cm. The same order of magnitude is observed for SOBP. Conclusions. We conclude that for ions with small total range (zw-eq ≤ 3 cm) dosimetry without applying FCF could in principle be performed in phantoms of materials other than water without a significant loss of accuracy. However, in clinical high-energy ion beams with penetration depths zw-eq ≥ 3 cm, where accurate positioning in water is not an issue, absorbed dose measurements should be directly performed in water or accurate values of FCF need to be established. © 2011 Informa Healthcare...|$|E
40|$|Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is {{a popular}} imaging {{modality}} due to its ability to provide excellent soft tissue contrast without exposure to ionizing radiation. It {{can be used for}} temperature monitoring (thermometry) as well as for assessing the biochemistry in vivo (MRS). This dissertation focuses separately on the development, application and quantitation issues of these two aspects of MRI. ^ Radiofrequency (RF) -induced tissue heating is a concern in MRI. The <b>dosimetric</b> <b>quantity</b> for monitoring RF heating is the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) defined as the RF power absorbed per unit mass of tissue. A novel approach for imaging SAR from absolute temperature images obtained using a paramagnetic lanthanide complex-Thulium 1, 4, 7, 10 -tetraazacyclododecane- 1, 4, 7, 10 -tetrakis (methylene phosphonate) (TmDOTP 5 -) was developed. The effects of a bare-ended, insulated conductor in a phantom were investigated by 3 D SAR imaging. 3 D SAR maps were also generated using a high SAR sequence while varying the pulse duration. The high spatial resolution SAR maps correctly identified the local SAR rise near the wire end and also revealed increasing SAR with increasing pulse duration in the high SAR sequence, as expected. These results demonstrate the potential of MR thermometry with paramagnetic lanthanide complexes for evaluating safety of implants, medical devices as well as different pulse sequences. The second part of the thesis is dedicated to the technique of measuring in vivo levels of the neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) using MRS. GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain which is involved in the control of fine movement and balance. GABA MRS with spectral editing was performed and GABA was quantified using custom fitting parameters in the tool LCModel to measure changes in movement disorders - particularly Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease (PD) and sleep bruxism. Higher levels of thalamic GABA were detected in PD with correlation to disease severity indicating the possibility to use GABA MRS as a biomarker for PD progression. On the other hand, in the bruxers, lower levels of GABA correlating with higher levels of glutamate in the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex were detected indicating disturbances in the GABAergic and glutamatergic pathways. ^ Lastly, since GABA quantification is a much discussed topic in literature with no one, clear and best approach, an effort was made to compare some popular fitting approaches in LCModel. Semi-synthetic simulated GABA spectra were used to test the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of methods, all of which handled the baseline and macromolecules in the GABA spectra differently. Overall, the approaches using a fully flexible baseline ranked best in the tested aspects. ...|$|E
40|$|The overall aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{increase}} our knowledge of relevant exposure parameters when discussing possible health implication from exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF), especially effects that might occur at non-thermal levels. In this thesis an effort is made to broaden the exposure assessment and to take the exposure time into account and combine it with the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) and the field parameters (electric and magnetic field strength) to approach a dose concept. In {{the first part of}} the thesis self-reported subjective symptoms among mobile phone users were studied. As a basis for this an epidemiological study among mobile phone users was completed with the main hypothesis that users of the digital transmission system GSM experience more symptoms than users of the older analogue NMT transmission system. The hypothesis was falsified, but an interesting side finding was that people with longer calling time per day experienced more symptoms than people with shorter calling time per day. The time-aspect (long duration phone call etc.) was also found to be relevant for the occurrence of symptoms in association with mobile phone use as well as duration of symptoms. The new suggested <b>dosimetric</b> <b>quantity</b> Specific Absorption per Day (SAD), in which both calling time per day as well as the measured SAR 1 g are included showed a stronger association to the prevalence of some of the symptoms, such as dizziness, discomfort and warmth behind the ear compared to both CT and SAR 1 g alone. In the second part whole body exposure conditions were considered. Methods to measure the induced current were examined in an experimental study, where different techniques were compared in different grounding conditions. The results were used in a study of operators of RF plastic sealers (RF operators) where the health status as well as the exposure were studied. The results showed that RF operators are a highly exposed group, which was confirmed by the fact that 16 out of 46 measured work places exceeded the ICNIRP guidelines. Headaches were found to be associated with the mean value of the time integrated E-field during a weld (E-weld) and the warmth sensations in the hands (warm hands) with the time integrated E-field exposure during one day (E-day). The general findings in this thesis indicated that time should be included in the exposure assessment when studying non-thermal effects such as subjective symptoms in connection with RF exposure. The thesis proposes two different methods for doing this, namely timeintegrated exposure [V/m x t and A/m x t] and dose [J/kg]...|$|E
40|$|EVIDOS (‘evaluation of {{individual}} dosimetry in mixed neutron and photon radiation fields') is an European Commission (EC) -sponsored project that aims at {{a significant improvement}} of radiation protection dosimetry in mixed neutron/photon fields via spectrometric and dosimetric investigations in representative workplaces of the nuclear industry. In particular, new spectrometry methods are developed that provide the energy and direction distribution of the neutron fluence from which the reference <b>dosimetric</b> <b>quantities</b> are derived and compared to the readings of dosemeters. The final results of the project will be a comprehensive set of spectrometric and dosimetric data for the workplaces and {{an analysis of the}} performance of dosemeters, including novel electronic dosemeters.

40|$|The goal of Total Skin Electron Therapy (TSET) is {{to deliver}} a uniform dose to the patient's entire skin to a limited depth while sparing the body organs. Due to the {{laborious}} commissioning process, {{it is helpful to}} use the Monte Carlo (MC) method for the procedure and treatment planning. Calculations of <b>dosimetric</b> <b>quantities</b> were performed with EGSnrc/BEAM MC codes {{as well as with the}} fast MC code XVMC. The linac model for a 6 MeV Varian CL 21 EX accelerator was established by measuring the electron focal spot size with a slit camera. Using this measured focal spot value in our proposed divergent beam model, an improved result for large field profiles can be achieved. Measured PDDs and profiles under standard set-up and TSET conditions were compared to MC calculations. Overall, satisfactory results were obtained except for simulations with an additional scattering filter, suggesting the composition, density and dimensions of the filter need to be confirmed...|$|R
40|$|Ionizing {{radiation}} exposures {{and associated}} <b>dosimetric</b> <b>quantities</b> are evaluated for the 11 -year solar cycle ending in 1986. Solar flare fluences for the 55 largest flares occurring during the cycle are superimposed on the Galactic cosmic ray flux. Published summaries of flare {{data from the}} Interplanetary Monitoring Platform (IMP) - 7 and IMP- 8 satellites are used that include flares whose integrated fluences are greater than 10 to the 7 th protons/sq cm for energies in excess of 10 MeV. A standard cosmic ray environment model for ion flux values at solar minimum and maximum is invoked with an assumed sinusoidal variation between the lower and upper limits. The radiation shielding analysis is carried out for equivalent water-shield thicknesses between 2 and 15 g/sq cm. Results are {{expressed in terms of}} cumulative incurred dose equivalents for deep-space missions lasting between 3 months and 3 years. It was found that medium-to-large flare contributions are of greatest importance for the shorter term missions, while the Galactic component dominates for the longer duration missions...|$|R
