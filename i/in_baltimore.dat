5|$|In {{the late}} 18th century, Americans like William Billings were {{establishing}} a bold, new style of vocal performance, markedly distinct from European traditions. John Cole, an important publisher and tune collector <b>in</b> <b>Baltimore,</b> known for pushing a rarefied European outlook on American music, responded with the tunebook Beauties of Psalmody, which denigrated the new techniques, especially fuguing. Cole continued publishing tunebooks up to 1842, and soon began operating his own singing school. Besides Cole, Baltimore {{was home to}} other major music publishers as well. These included Wheeler Gillet, who focused on dignified, European-style music like Cole did, and Samuel Dyer, who collected more distinctly American-styled songs. The tunebooks published <b>in</b> <b>Baltimore</b> included instructional notes, using {{a broad array of}} music education techniques then common. Ruel Shaw, for example, used a system derived from the work of Heinrich Pestalozzi, interpreted by the American Lowell Mason. Though the Pestalozzian system was widely used <b>in</b> <b>Baltimore,</b> other techniques were tried, such as that developed by local singing master James M. Deems, based on the Italian solfeggi system.|$|E
5|$|Local music <b>in</b> <b>Baltimore</b> can {{be traced}} back to 1784, when concerts were advertised in the local press. These concert {{programs}} featured compositions by locals Alexander Reinagle and Raynor Taylor, as well as European composers like Frantisek Kotzwara, Ignaz Pleyel, Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf, Giovanni Battista Viotti and Johann Sebastian Bach. Opera first came to Baltimore in 1752, with the performance of The Beggar's Opera by a touring company. It was soon followed by La Serva Padrona by Giovanni Battista Pergolesi, the American premier of that work, and the 1772 performance of Comus by John Milton, performed by the American Company of Lewis Hallam. This was soon followed by the creation of the first theatre <b>in</b> <b>Baltimore,</b> funded by Thomas Wall and Adam Lindsay's Maryland Company of Comedians, the first resident theatrical company in the city, which had been established despite a ban on theatrical entertainment by the Continental Congress in 1774. Maryland was the only state to so openly flout the ban, giving special permission to the Maryland Company in 1781, to perform both <b>in</b> <b>Baltimore</b> and Annapolis. Shakespearean and other plays made up the repertoire, often with wide-ranging modifications, including the addition of songs. The managers of the Maryland Company had some trouble finding qualified musicians to play in the theatre's orchestra. The Maryland Company and the American Company performed sporadically <b>in</b> <b>Baltimore</b> until the early 1790s, when the Philadelphia Company of Alexander Reinagle and Thomas Wignell began dominating, based out of their Holliday Street Theater.|$|E
