5|$|Fearing the {{approaching}} Jin army, Song emperor Huizong planned to retreat south. The emperor deserting the capital {{would have been}} viewed {{as an act of}} capitulation, so court officials convinced him to abdicate. There were few objections. Rescuing an empire <b>in</b> <b>crisis</b> from destruction was more important than preserving the rituals of imperial inheritance. In January 1126, {{a few days before the}} New Year, Huizong abdicated in favor of his son and was demoted to the ceremonial role of Retired Emperor. The Jurchen forces reached the Yellow River on January 27, 1126, two days after the New Year. Huizong fled Kaifeng the next day, escaping south and leaving the newly enthroned emperor Qinzong (r. 1126–1127) in charge of the capital.|$|E

5|$|HenryIII's reign was <b>in</b> <b>crisis</b> in 1258. He had {{recently}} suffered defeat in Wales, there were agricultural problems {{leading to a}} famine, and relations with the pope were worsening. Discontent amongst England's magnates led Henry to promise reform, but under continued pressure his authority disintegrated. A royal council of fifteen magnates was formed in June that year, {{and the rule of}} the country transferred from the king to the council. With foreign help Henry's reign was restored in 1261 as the council were reluctant to start a civil war. Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester, raised a rebellion. In 1264 civil war broke out between those loyal to the king and the baronial forces led by de Montfort.|$|E

5|$|In December 1917 the Bolsheviks {{were under}} intense {{pressure}} from the Germans to conclude peace negotiations at Brest-Litovsk, and Russia Bolshevism was <b>in</b> <b>crisis,</b> with a demoralized army {{and the fate of}} the October Revolution in doubt. Lenin calculated that the Bolsheviks could hold central parts of Russia but had to give up some peripheral territories, including Finland in the geopolitically less important north-western corner. As a result, Svinhufvud and his senate delegation won Lenin's concession of sovereignty on 31 December 1917.|$|E
40|$|PUPROSE OF THE STUDY: This thesis {{studies the}} {{persistence}} of bank performance <b>in</b> <b>crises,</b> and whether some banks are inclined to perform more weakly <b>in</b> <b>crises</b> than others. Specifically, {{the objective is to}} study whether a European bank's stock return <b>in</b> the Russian <b>crisis</b> of 1998 can explain its stock return and probability of failure <b>in</b> the financial <b>crisis</b> of 2007 - 2009. Moreover, this thesis also examines which attributes are present in those banks that performed badly <b>in</b> both <b>crises.</b> DATA AND METHODS: The sample includes 164 publicly listed companies; all the banks, financial services companies, life and nonlife insurance companies that existed both in July 1998 and in July 2007 in Thomson Reuters Datastream and that are based in one of the 16 Western European countries presented in Table 3. All sample companies are referred to as banks. I acquire stock price data from Thomson Reuters Datastream and for accounting information I use Thomson Reuters Worldscope. I gather merger data from Securities Data Company (SDC) and LexisNexis. I search the news and the annual reports of banks for information about state aid, nationalization and causes for delisting. The hypotheses are tested by estimating ordinary least squares (OLS) and logit regressions. RESULTS: The results of this thesis do not support the hypothesis that banks that perform weakly <b>in</b> <b>crises</b> have a built-in trait in their risks culture and/or their business model that makes them vulnerable <b>in</b> <b>crises.</b> I do not find evidence that European banks' stock return <b>in</b> the <b>crisis</b> of 1998 explain their stock return or increase their probability of failure <b>in</b> the financial <b>crisis.</b> Specifically, I find that a bank's weak (good) performance <b>in</b> the financial <b>crisis</b> is explained by the bank's higher (lower) systematic risk and higher (lower) ex-ante measure of systemic risk prior to the financial crisis. I also find that banks from countries with a current account surplus (deficit) performed better (worse) <b>in</b> the financial <b>crisis.</b> Banks with higher leverage, a lower book-to-market ratio and a higher market capitalization had a higher probability of failure <b>in</b> the financial <b>crisis.</b> Furthermore, I find that the banks that were in the bottom group <b>in</b> both <b>crises</b> had more idiosyncratic risk before the crisis of 1998 than other banks, whereas, they exhibited more systematic and systemic risk before the financial crisis than other banks. This finding shows that bottom performers are associated with different attributes prior to each crisis...|$|R

40|$|The 1991 Persian Gulf War is a “most likely” {{case for}} several crisis {{decision-making}} models. It commanded presidential attention, arose when bureaucrats were fighting over post-Cold War budgets, and evoked the strong organizational {{cultures of the}} U. S. Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines. We use this case to assess the contexts, decision stages, and issue areas <b>in</b> which alternative <b>crisis</b> models have the most explanatory power. We find that presidents are most powerful in agenda setting, choosing among options, crises, and high-politics issues. Bureaucratic politics diminishes <b>in</b> <b>crises</b> and best explains the behavior of mid-level careerists, the formulation of options, and the shaping of post-war budgets. Most striking, even <b>in</b> <b>crises</b> organizational cultures strongly shape tactical military decisions, choices among weapons systems, and the willingness of officials to risk their careers {{on behalf of their}} organizations' values. Overall, these findings argue for greater attention to the influence of organizational cultures <b>in</b> <b>crises...</b>|$|R
5|$|In the 1980s, {{the sector}} was <b>in</b> <b>crisis,</b> {{characterized}} by low investment, poor cost recovery and poor service quality {{in most of}} the country. As a result, the government decided to break up INSFOPAL {{at the end of the}} 1980s and to devolve the responsibility for service provision back to the municipalities after four decades, except for some cases like the Valle de Cauca department, where the regional companies continued providing the services. Furthermore, the institutional responsibility for the sector was transferred from the Ministry of Health to the Ministry of Economic Development. This change was not only an administrative change, but it introduced a different focus and perspective to the sector.|$|E

5|$|The Empathic Civilization: The Race to Global Consciousness in a World <b>in</b> <b>Crisis</b> is a 2010 non-fiction {{book written}} by Jeremy Rifkin. It connects the {{evolution}} of communication and energy development in civilizations with psychological and economic development in humans. Rifkin considers the latest phase of communication and energy regimes—that of electronic telecommunications and fossil fuel extraction—as bringing people together on the nation-state level based on democratic capitalism, {{but at the same}} time creating global problems, like climate change, pandemics, and nuclear proliferation. Rifkin extrapolates the observed trend into the future, predicting that Internet and mobile technology along with small-scale renewable energy commercialization will create an era of distributed capitalism necessary to manage the new energy regime and a heightened global empathy that can help solve global problems.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the Vietnam War, Lê Duẩn took an {{aggressive}} posture. He saw attack {{as the key}} to victory. When the North finally won the war in 1975, Lê Duẩn and his associates were overly optimistic about the future. The Second Five-Year Plan (1976–1980) was a failure and left the Vietnamese economy <b>in</b> <b>crisis.</b> Vietnam was then headed by a gerontocracy (in which the rulers are much older than the average adult). Vietnam became internationally isolated during Lê Duẩn's rule. In 1979 the country had invaded Kampuchea and ousted Pol Pot, fought a war with China and became dependent on Soviet economic aid. Lê Duẩn died in July 1986 and was succeeded by Trường Chinh.|$|E

5|$|By {{the second}} half of the twentieth century, the declining {{population}} trend had gone into reverse. Increasing numbers of retired people were arriving to make their home in the tranquil surroundings, and after the Beacham Commission in the 1960s, the British government realised that the rural way of life in parts of Wales was <b>in</b> <b>crisis,</b> and started to react. Through government initiatives and local actions, opportunities in tourism, rural crafts, specialist food shops, farmers' markets and added-value food products began to emerge. However, in 2011, at 3.1%, Ceredigion still had one of the highest proportions of its population working in agriculture, forestry and fishing, close behind such other places as Orkney and Shetland.

5|$|Each of {{the core}} {{economic}} functions, consumption, production, and investment, have become highly globalized in recent decades. While consumers increasingly import foreign goods or purchase domestic goods produced with foreign inputs, businesses continue to expand production internationally to meet an increasingly globalized consumption in the world economy. International financial integration among nations has afforded investors the opportunity to diversify their asset portfolios by investing abroad. Consumers, multinational corporations, individual and institutional investors, and financial intermediaries (such as banks) are the key economic actors within the global financial system. Central banks (such as the European Central Bank or the U.S. Federal Reserve System) undertake open market operations {{in their efforts to}} realize monetary policy goals. International financial institutions such as the Bretton Woods institutions, multilateral development banks and other development finance institutions provide emergency financing to countries <b>in</b> <b>crisis,</b> provide risk mitigation tools to prospective foreign investors, and assemble capital for development finance and poverty reduction initiatives. Trade organizations such as the World Trade Organization, Institute of International Finance, and the World Federation of Exchanges attempt to ease trade, facilitate trade disputes and address economic affairs, promote standards, and sponsor research and statistics publications.|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between journalism and PR {{has long been}} discussed within communication science. However, the impact of crisis situations on that relationship has rarely {{become part of the}} discussion. Therefore, the aim of the study is to describe the relations between journalism and PR specifically under crisis conditions. Embedded into the intereffication approach, the empirical study is based on qualitative interviews with the heads of corporate communication of Germany’s leading stock listed companies and the editors-in-chief of Germany’s leading newspapers. Results show, that crises evoke organisational changes in communication and editorial departments. Moreover, <b>in</b> <b>crises,</b> journalists work around prescribed terminologies and take information provided by PR only as basic information. While personal relationships gain relevance for PR, for journalists they become less relevant <b>in</b> a <b>crisis.</b> Journalists intensify and widen their research instead in order to gain exclusive material. Our study for the first time offers a multidimensional examination of media relations <b>in</b> <b>crises</b> both, on the level of actions and on the level of organisation. Findings provide new input for a theoretical development of the intereffication model and help practitioners find guidelines for sophisticated media relations <b>in</b> <b>crises...</b>|$|R
