40|$|The goal of {{this project}} is to {{demonstrate}} the overlooked influences of <b>fraternal</b> <b>societies</b> {{in the development of}} early American towns. This paper uses the agricultural town of Orange, California as a case study as a means to demonstrate how individuals who belonged to these <b>fraternal</b> <b>societies</b> have made important contributions to Orange???s growth. The values, characteristics, and expectations that <b>fraternal</b> <b>societies</b> have instilled in their members have had a significant influence on the ways in which its prominent members contributed to Orange???s economy and local community. This thesis highlights individuals from Orange???s beginnings and how their involvement in <b>fraternal</b> <b>societies</b> has helped shape Orange???s character. While there are a multitude of factors that {{contribute to the development of}} early American towns, this study tries to demonstrate the hidden fraternal forces that have long been overlooked by American historians. The concepts of fraternalism such as brotherhood, community, responsibility and ethics are all explored as pivotal aspects of the development of Orange. This paper attempts to continue the historical conversation and identify a clear connection between <b>fraternal</b> <b>societies</b> and development in Orange. The evidence used to make this connection includes primary sources such as town directories, society records and rosters, and early local newspapers. These sources help to make the connection between prominent members of society and their involvement in <b>fraternal</b> <b>societies.</b> Orange???s <b>fraternal</b> structure is complicated, and yet nearly invisible to the layperson. This paper includes original studies of specific societies in Orange including the Freemasons, the Odd Fellows, and the Ancient Order of United Workmen...|$|R
