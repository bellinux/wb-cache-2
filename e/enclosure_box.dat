40|$|A vacuum {{thermoforming}} machine works by heating a clamped polymer sheet and then engaging the tooling {{to form the}} desired shape when the plastic is at the proper temperature. The current {{vacuum thermoforming}} machine in the Trine University Plastics Lab possesses a single top‐side heater. With the current setup, thicker materials will be scorched on the material’s top side and while the bottom side is not heated enough. In order for thicker materials {{to be used by}} the machine and heated effectively, a second bottom‐side heater is needed. Since an off the shelf solution is not feasible, the second heater must be designed and fabricated. Before fabrication of the secondary thermoforming heater, several analyses were conducted to ensure that the heater would function within the necessary operating parameters. Using thermal simulation software, the designed heater <b>enclosure</b> <b>box</b> was tested to ensure that the correct thermal flow was provided as needed. Material properties were then applied to the CAD files and finite element analysis software was used to ensure that the new heating enclosure and track system would be structurally sound. Although variations of the heating enclosure setup were taken into account as part of these analyses, the results favored mirroring the existing heater layout with some adjustments. Instead of sixteen individual horizontal coils like in the top heater, three coils with three bends each were used. Testing showed that the same watt density could be achieved with only three coils using this design. The new heater was also made thinner in order to allow for more space for the mold. The heater tray was insulated {{in order to protect the}} mold which rests underneath and also for safety purposes.

40|$|With {{the growing}} {{popularity}} of Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) as a competitive sport, questions regarding the dynamic response and properties of MMA gloves arise. High-energy impacts from punches are very similar to boxing yet MMA competition requires the use of 4 oz fingerless glove, compared to the larger full <b>enclosure</b> <b>boxing</b> glove. This work assessed the kinetic properties and strike dynamics of MMA gloves and compared findings with traditional boxing gloves. Gloves mounted on a molded fist were impacted repetitively on an instrumental anvil designed for impact, over a 5 hour period resulting in 10, 000 continuous and consistent strikes. Kinetic data from impacts were sampled {{at the beginning of the}} data collection and subsequently every 30 minutes (every 1, 000 strikes). MMA gloves produced 4 - 5 times greater peak force and 5 times faster load rate compared to the boxing glove. However, MMA gloves also showed signs of material fatigue, with peak force increasing by 35 % and rate of loading increasing by 60 % over the duration of the test. Boxing glove characteristics did deteriorate but to a lesser extent. In summary, the kinetic properties of MMA glove differed substantially from the boxing glove resulting in impacts characterized by higher peak forces and more rapid development of force. Material properties including stiffness and thickness play a role in the kinetic characteristics upon impact, and can be inferred to alter injury mechanisms of blunt force trauma...|$|R

5000|$|Delay boxes improve {{starting}} line reaction time accuracy for drivers. Delay boxes {{do not do}} this autonomously. Driver interaction is still required to launch the vehicle and driver skill is still required to achieve a favorable reaction time.

General dark storage in light tight <b>enclosures</b> and storage <b>boxes</b> is always advised for individual items.
