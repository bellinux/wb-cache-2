500|$|On 3 November 2010, the Los Angeles Times {{released}} an extended clip of Harry leaving the Burrow {{to find the}} Horcruxes, titled [...] "No One <b>Else</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Going</b> <b>to</b> Die for Me". On 4 November, a new clip {{was released from the}} Harry Potter Facebook page, titled [...] "The Seven Potters". Two more clips were released over the next two days, including a scene depicting a café attack and another taking place in Malfoy Manor.|$|E
500|$|Asked if {{he thought}} Bowyer could still win the {{championship}} after this setback, Stewart argued, [...] "It's possible for sure. The biggest {{thing is going to}} be going to the race track and having that stress of not having his crew chief, not having his car chief and those are two key people on a race weekend... I can promise you that Childress has the resources to cover this... it's definitely possible, but everyone <b>else</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have to have trouble." [...] Bowyer did not lose the victory title for the race itself; NASCAR vice president of competition Robin Pemberton commented, [...] "We don't consider taking away the win. If you ask some, they would consider a 150-point penalty with only nine races to go in the Chase a pretty hefty penalty." ...|$|E
500|$|Preparing for {{the episode}} was {{physically}} difficult {{for some of}} the cast members, most of whom had little experience singing and dancing. They spent three months in voice training. Two choreographers worked with Whedon and the cast on dance sequences. Michelle Trachtenberg (Dawn), who is trained in ballet, requested a dance sequence in lieu of a significant singing part, and Alyson Hannigan (Willow), according to Whedon, begged him not to give her many lines. Sarah Michelle Gellar (Buffy) told the BBC that [...] "It took something like 19hours of singing and 17hours of dancing in between shooting four other episodes" [...] and she was so anxious about singing that she [...] "hated every moment of it". When Whedon suggested using a voice double for her, however, she said, [...] "I basically started to cry and said, 'You mean someone <b>else</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do my big emotional turning point for the season?' In the end, it was an incredible experience and I'm glad I did it. And I never want to do it again." [...] Davies was so impressed with Hinton Battle's performance on Broadway in The Wiz that he asked Battle to play the demon Sweet. Battle, a three-time Tony-winner, wore prosthetic make-up {{for the first time to}} give him a demonic red face. Sweet was portrayed as [...] "slick", smooth and stylish; in contrast, most demons on the series were designed to be crude and ugly. The set for The Bronze was used frequently throughout the series, but stairs were built from the stage to maximize floor space for Battle's dance.|$|E

5000|$|The new ending starts {{shortly after}} Ryman kicks Georgia, Shaun, and Rick {{out of the}} Sacramento event, and diverges with the virus dart hitting Shaun instead of Georgia. Georgia and Rick retreat inside the van to post their {{findings}} on Tate and the conspiracy, while Shaun dies defending them from the outbreak. Georgia confronts and kills Tate, then commits suicide a week later, unable {{to live in a}} world without Shaun. The perspective changes to Rick's, broken and alcoholic, as he organizes the Masons' funerals. He notes that the conspiracy may not have ended with Tate, but [...] "someone <b>else</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have to save the world next time." ...|$|R
60|$|Tessa obeyed with a tranquillising {{sense that}} life <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{something}} quite new, and that Tito {{would be with}} her often. All who remember their childhood remember the strange vague sense, when some new experience came, that everything <b>else</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> changed, and {{that there would be}} no lapse into the old monotony. So the bit of coral was hung beside the tiny bag with the scrap of scrawled parchment in it, and Tessa felt braver.|$|R
2500|$|Julie Salamon {{has written}} that De Palma {{has been accused of}} being [...] "a perverse misogynist" [...] by critics. De Palma has responded to accusations of {{misogyny}} by saying: [...] "I'm always attacked for having an erotic, sexist approach---chopping up women, putting women in peril. I'm making suspense movies! What <b>else</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> happen to them?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In a {{separate}} {{review in the}} St. Petersburg Times, Steve Persall did not view the film in high regard. [...] Persall noted that although Peter Alexander stated the film was a [...] "warning against the influence of religious cults," [...] and not based on Scientology specifically, he thought that [...] "The Profit is a rant against Hubbard and Scientology, {{no matter how many}} cults the filmmakers claim to have researched and incorporated into the story." [...] Persall expressed frustration when Alexander did not answer specific questions about his inspiration and influences used in the film, citing concerns that: [...] "the evil empire will jump all over whoever <b>else</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> show it next." [...] Though the review was not favorable, Persall wrote that the film would have been a more powerful piece as a truthful documentary, and not a parody, writing: [...] "The Profit would make a stronger statement if Alexander used his Scientology experience to produce a documentary or a no-holds-barred version of Hubbard's life that calls him Hubbard." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, Anne Rice has {{consistently}} and aggressively prevented fan fiction based {{on any of}} her fictional characters (mostly those from her famous Interview with the Vampire and its sequels in The Vampire Chronicles). She, along with Anne McCaffrey (whose stance has been changed by her son, Todd McCaffrey, since her death) and Raymond Feist, have asked to have any fiction related to their series removed from FanFiction.Net. George R.R. Martin, who was selected by Time magazine {{as one of the}} [...] "2011 Time 100" [...] and is most famous for his epic fantasy series, A Song of Ice and Fire, is also strongly opposed to fan fiction, believing it to be copyright infringement and a bad exercise for aspiring writers. Sharon Lee and Steve Miller, creators of the Liaden universe, strongly oppose fan fiction written in their universe, Lee saying that [...] "Nobody <b>else</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> get it right. This may sound rude and elitist, but honestly, it's not easy for us to get it right sometimes, and we've been living with these characters... for a very long time." ...|$|E

50|$|Products {{and ideas}} {{of this time}} did not go far. The Portfolio drive (a 3 in form factor model, {{developed}} with JT Storage) was a flop, as was the SDX hard disk to CD-ROM interface. WDC's drives started to slip further behind competing products, and quality began to suffer; system builders and PC enthusiasts who used to recommend WD above all <b>else,</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the competition, particularly Maxtor, whose products had improved significantly by the late 1990s.|$|R
2500|$|The novel [...] "allowed him to exorcise {{some of his}} demons, mostly {{centered}} on {{his relationship with his}} father, which was stormy and sometimes violent." [...] Carr will not reveal specific details of his family history, but he has said, [...] "It's safe to assume that I know something about family violence...." [...] and he told New York magazine, [...] "I'm the only kid in my family who never tried to kill himself...I kind of figured somebody <b>else</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> kill me anyway." ...|$|R
2500|$|Show creator Jason Rothenberg said he {{and others}} {{involved}} with the series were aware of Debnam-Carey while casting Clarke in 2014; although the chance for her to portray Clarke never materialized, her name was brought up while casting Lexa. He called the casting a [...] "no-brainer"; she did not audition for the role, but was rather offered it. At the time, Debnam-Carey was also being considered {{for the role of}} Alicia Clark on Fear the Walking Dead. [...] "That's always a concern when you have an actor in your show that is popping—that someone <b>else</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> grab them and make them a series regular if you don't. That's kind of what happened in this case," [...] stated Rothenberg, who considered Debnam-Carey's performance on The 100 [...] "amazing". He added, [...] "You know we can't compete on some level with the cache of a franchise like that, with the numbers." [...] Debnam-Carey was allowed to continue work on both shows. [...] Rothenberg said he {{would have done the same}} had it been the other way around, with creators asking to borrow one of his actors, and he would have done his best to make the situation work.|$|E
2500|$|Sandé {{said the}} key to a {{successful}} song was simplicity. The singer pointed out that she could never have used songs which she wrote when she was 17 because she made the songs too complicated; saying there were too many words and parts to the track. She stated that the key feature to a classical song was keeping the [...] "melody simple" [...] and having big [...] "lyric effective", which was much easier said than actually done. Sandé said that another important key to a good song when songwriting is using [...] "honesty" [...] and [...] "raw emotion" [...] as the best way to write. She said that if she attempts to write something which is [...] "too smart" [...] the creative process will not work for her. [...] "Kill the Boy" [...] {{was one of the first}} ideas that came to Sandé's head. If she has to work on a song longer than a day, she will not go back to it because it won't work. She went on to say if it was to work, the idea for the song would be almost instant. Sandé said that all her songs are about world peace and political issues. She is the same person since gaining the record deal with Virgin Records, and they are the same songs which she planned for the album before gaining the deal. She said that a lot of people didn't see the potential in the songs or in her, but once she gained the record deal, she gained more confidence. [...] "When you get knocked back so much you kind of learn to believe in yourself, stand up for yourself, because you can bet that nobody <b>else</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do it." ...|$|E

5000|$|In 2006 Shapiro, with Aisha Bain and Jen Marlowe, {{released}} Darfur Diaries. Filmmakers {{explored the}} history of the conflict in Darfur and interviewed refugees and displaced persons, particularly victimized women and children. Shapiro explained his interest in a Democracy Now interview, saying: [...] "Just looking around and seeing what I had been doing in the Occupied Territories, the recent film I had done in Iraq, I realized that if nobody <b>else</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do it, then it's incumbent upon us as individuals to try to do whatever we could." ...|$|R
5000|$|In a 2009 interview, lead vocalist Panther stated, [...] "We {{basically}} {{gathered up}} all of our good friends from the local rock bands of Murfreesboro, tied ourselves together, and tried to walk. And somehow it worked. At the time, we noticed a void in rock and roll. A hole that could only really be filled with grown men and women painting up like robots and playing some fierce and furious rock music based on a 1980s video game. We were fairly certain no one <b>else</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> fill that hole. But, by God, it's filled now. You can thank us later." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What shall I go as?" [...] was the {{universal}} cry. Garrets {{were taken by}} storm, cherished relics were teased out of old ladies' lavendered chests (happy she who saw them again!), hats were made into boots, gowns into doublets, cloaks into hose, Sunday bonnets despoiled of their plumage, silken cauliflowers sown broadcast over the land, and cocked-up caps erected in every style of architecture, while [...] "Tag, Rag, and Bobtail" [...] drove a smashing business, and everybody knew what everybody <b>else</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> and solemnly vowed they didn't--which transparent falsehood was the best joke of the whole.|$|R

60|$|It was {{the eldest}} Arlington girl's quite audible remark that pa could have eaten two helpings of pudding {{while he had}} been talking, that caused Mr. Arlington to lose the thread of his discourse. To put it quite bluntly, what Mr. Arlington meant to say was this: He had {{never wanted to be}} a farmer--at least not in the beginning. Other men in his position, having {{acquired}} competency by years of self-sacrificing labour, would have retired to a well-earned leisure.
