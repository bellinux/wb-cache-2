5|$|The Depression of the 1930s exposed glaring {{weaknesses}} in federal-provincial financial arrangements. Canada's poorer provinces <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> {{to cope with}} widespread poverty and hunger while the federal government resisted taking full responsibility for unemployment relief. By 1937, conditions had become so desperate that the provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan faced bankruptcy. Finally, in August 1937, Prime Minister King appointed the Royal Commission on Dominion-Provincial Relations, popularly known as the Rowell-Sirois Commission. According to biographer Stephen Henderson, Macdonald {{played an important role}} in shaping the Commission's final recommendations.|$|E
5|$|The 26th Infantry's initial {{attack on}} 13 October {{provided}} important insight {{on the nature}} of the fighting; American infantry had been ambushed by German defenders using sewers and cellars, forcing the advancing American infantry to clear each opening before continuing down streets, while Sherman tanks <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> to maneuver to suppress enemy fire. German civilians were cleared as the 26th Infantry advanced; no Germans were allowed to remain in the Americans' rear. Success in Aachen was measured by the number of houses captured, as the advance proved to be sluggish; in order to cope with the thick walls of the older buildings in the city, the 26th Infantry Regiment used howitzers at point blank range to destroy German fortifications. The howitzer created passageways that allowed infantrymen to advance from building to building without having to enter the city's streets, where they could be pinned down by enemy fire. Sherman tanks were ambushed, as they entered intersections, by concealed German anti-tank guns. Soon thereafter, American tanks and other armored vehicles would advance cautiously, often shooting buildings ahead of the accompanying infantry to clear them of possible defenders. Pinned on the surface by Allied aircraft, German infantrymen would use sewers to deploy behind American formations to attack them from the rear. German resistance was fierce, as they launched small counterattacks and used armor to halt American movements.|$|E

They can go from first to second in 2.9 seconds; and no pitcher catcher combination in baseball could throw from here to there to tag second in 2.9 seconds, it was always 3, 3.1, 3.2. So actually, the runner that can make the continuous, regular move like Rickey's can't be thrown out, and he's proven it." ...|$|R
5|$|The Honduras Packet {{reached the}} Black River in November 1822. Bemused {{to find a}} country rather {{different}} from the Sketchs descriptions, and no sign of St Joseph, the emigrants set up camp on the shore, assuming that the Poyaisian authorities would soon contact them. They sent numerous search parties inland; one, guided by natives who recognised the name St Joseph, found some long-forgotten foundations and rubble. Hall quickly came to the private conclusion that MacGregor must have duped them, but reasoned that announcing such concerns prematurely would only demoralise the party and cause chaos. A few weeks after their arrival, {{the captain of the}} Honduras Packet abruptly and unilaterally sailed away amid a fierce storm; the emigrants found themselves alone apart from the natives and two American hermits. Comforting the settlers with vague assurances that the Poyaisian government would find them if they just stayed where they were, Hall set out for Cape Gracias a Dios, hoping to make contact with the Mosquito king or find another ship. Most of the emigrants <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> to believe that the Cazique had deliberately misled them, and posited that blame must lie elsewhere, or that there must have been some terrible misunderstanding.|$|E
5|$|In the {{planning}} for Operation Mars in November, the division {{was given a}} leading role in the 20th Army's assault. Alongside the 247th Rifle Division, and supported by the 80th and 240th Tank Brigades, the 331st was tasked to cross the mostly-frozen Vazuza River between Trostino and Pechora, to take German strong points at Zevalovka and Prudy. On the second day, the second German defensive position would be taken. Following this the division would cross the railroad between Rzhev and Sychyovka, and reduce the German strong point at Khlepen. In the event, on November 25, the division successfully forced the river line and took Prudy, but was halted by heavy fire from Khlepen. The 247th had made greater progress and the rest of the 331st reinforced that bridgehead. Overnight, the front commander, General I.S. Konev, decided to try to pass a mobile reserve force through this scant lodgement to complete the breakthrough. The following day the two rifle divisions continued to struggle to expand the bridgehead, but with little success. The tanks and cavalry of the reserve managed to tear a hole in the defenses and get into the enemy rear, but the infantry <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> to follow. The gains made by the 331st over the following days were negligible. For most of the remainder of the operation the division held the left flank of its army, recovering from its losses. In the period from November 25 to December 18 the division lost 597 men killed, 1,445 wounded, and 106 missing-in-action, for a total of 2,148 casualties.|$|E

25|$|In March 1825, a four {{thousand}} strong British force {{supported by a}} flotilla of gun boats attacked Danubyu.

25|$|Early on 21 July, Wayne bombarded the {{blockhouse}} {{with his}} four cannons, but {{an hour later}} there were no discernible results. After being peppered with accurate fire from the blockhouse, the American soldiers from the 1st and 2nd Pennsylvania Regiments became impatient. Despite their officers' attempts to stop them, the soldiers dashed forward through the abatis {{to the base of}} the stockade. Once there, they <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> to break into the defensive works, and were forced to retreat.|$|E
25|$|In the end, the mixed-calibre heavy {{armament}} proved unsuccessful, as gunnery officers <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> {{to distinguish}} between 12-inch (305-mm) and 9.2-inch shell splashes, making fire control impractical. This finding further pushed the navies {{of the world to}} move to all-big-gun dreadnought battleship designs. Indeed, an all-big-gun design had been considered for the Lord Nelsons in January 1905, but their design was too far advanced by then to be changed, and the all-big-gun layout had to await HMS Dreadnought.|$|E

25|$|Parliament {{suffered}} chronic {{difficulties in}} obtaining sufficient manpower, and <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> {{to fill the}} quotas they had set. The Army was a deeply unpopular profession, one contentious issue being pay. A Private infantryman was paid a wage of just 8d. per day, the same pay as for a New Model Army infantryman, 130 years earlier. The rate of pay in the army was insufficient to meet the rising costs of living, turning off potential recruits, as service was nominally for life.|$|E

However, not all mutilated animals display these anomalies, and those that do have slightly different anomalies from one another. On account of the time between death and necropsy, and a lack of background information on specific cattle, investigators have often <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> to determine if these variations are connected to the animals' deaths or not.|$|E

25|$|After {{their initial}} claim of {{copyright}} infringement in the Linux kernel, The SCO Group started their SCOsource initiative, which sells licenses of SCO's claimed copyrighted software, other than OpenServer and Unixware licenses.

However, many individuals have <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> to buy such a license from SCO. SCO says that participants of the SCOsource initiative are not liable for any claims that SCO makes against Linux users.|$|E
25|$|The {{perception}} that Boris needed correction due to Mussorgsky's poverty of technique prompted Rimsky-Korsakov to revise it after his death. His edition supplanted the composer's Revised Version of 1872 in Russia, and launched the work abroad, remaining the preferred edition for some 75 years (see Versions by Other Hands {{in this article}} for more details). For decades, critics and scholars pressing {{for the performance of}} Mussorgsky's own versions fought an often losing battle against the conservatism of conductors and singers, who, raised on the plush Rimsky-Korsakov edition, <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> to adapt to Mussorgsky's comparatively unrefined and bleak original scores.|$|E
25|$|However, Ben Ali's {{innovative}} tack did {{not work}} out well. Subsequently, An-Nahda claimed to have run strongly in the 1989 elections, giving it the appearance of being unfair; official results gave the RCD every seat in the legislature. Ben Ali subsequently banned Islamist political parties and reportedly jailed as many as 8,000 activists. At the same time, Ben Ali ran unopposed in Tunisia's first presidential election since 1972. At the time, prospective presidential candidates {{had to get the}} endorsements of 30 political figures.

25|$|The {{timing of}} the {{authorisation}} was unfortunate, as on 10 May 1866 the banking firm of Overend, Gurney and Company suspended payments, having {{run out of money}} to discharge its liabilities, and the surrounding financial turmoil provoked a massive failure of the availability of investment money. The company <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> to secure the necessary capital, and the start of construction was much delayed. In fact nothing was done for several years, and as the authorising Act specified a time limit, it was necessary to obtain a further Act allowing an extension of time. This was the Wye Valley Railway Act of 16 June 1871.|$|E
25|$|However, Liechtenstein's column soon {{appeared}} from the south. Liechtenstein {{pointed out that}} the existing truce did not apply to him and demanded an immediate surrender. Coutard thereupon capitulated at 5:00 PM. The French sappers had <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> to demolish the sturdily-built Regensburg bridge. The intact bridge later played a key factor in the escape of Charles' army. In two days of fighting, the French lost 11 officers and about 200 soldiers killed and wounded, plus 1,988 captured. Austrian losses were 73 dead, 220 wounded, and 85 missing for a total of 378 casualties. During the struggle the French captured 75 troops and one color, all of which were recovered.|$|E

Also that year, a mortally ill King Ferdinand made him a Grand Officer of the Order of the Star of Romania. Again touring Germany {{with a series of}} conferences (1926), Tzigara also spoke at Radio Berlin, making his debut in radio programming.
