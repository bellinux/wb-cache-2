Blige, [...] "The One". It premiered on VEVO on April 12, 2010. In an exclusive with Rap-Up, when asked about how the connection came about, Mandler said, [...] "I’m {{a big fan of}} Drake and I was really excited when he called me about doing it, and really put a lot into making it special and capturing what I think is an image he hasn’t had yet. Here’s a guy whose lyrical presence does not equal his visual presence yet, by any means. That’s something that he and I spoke a lot about. He felt strongly that nobody had really captured him, and some of the videos that had been done were less iconic than he would like to be represented as." [...] On Drake and the song he said, [...] "It’s so refreshing that he’s confident, but he’s not arrogant. I think that dimensionality is so important in a genre that is very one note with words like “bravado” and “swagger” and “arrogance” and “promiscuity.” Here’s a guy that’s finally putting a duality to the words and saying, “Yeah, I have all that and I do all that, but I’m also somebody that’s asking, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> should be doing with my life?" [...] When asked of the concept of the [...] "Over" [...] video, Mandler said that it was something that would not be expected. Mandler explained, [...] "Drake and I were very conscious about trying to push the limits and trying to push things forward. He came to me because he wanted to throw away the conventions of a medium, and take chances and be daring and take certain themes that are relevant to him and try to visualize them in not the obvious way".|$|E

60|$|I do not forget, of course, {{that all}} these visible walls and towers are but the battlements and pinnacles of a buried city, or of many buried cities. I do not forget that such {{buildings}} have foundations that are to us almost like fossils; the gigantic fossils of some other geological epoch. Something may be said later of those lost empires whose very masterpieces are to us like petrified monsters. From this height, after long histories unrecorded, fell the forgotten idol of the Jebusites, on that day when David's javelin-men scaled the citadel and carried through it, in darkness behind his coloured curtains, the god whose image had never been made by man. Here was waged that endless war between the graven gods of the plain and the invisible god of the mountain; from here the hosts carrying the sacred fish of the Philistines were driven back to the sea from which their worship came. Those who worshipped on this hill {{had come out of}} bondage in Egypt and went into bondage in Babylon; small as was their country, there passed before them almost the whole pageant of the old pagan world. All its strange shapes and strong almost cruel colours remain in the records of their prophets; whose lightest phrase seems heavier than the pyramids of Egypt; and whose very words are like winged bulls walking. All this historic or pre-historic interest may be touched on in its turn; but I am not dealing here with the historic secrets unearthed by the study of the place, but with the historic associations aroused by the sight of it. The traveller is in the position of that famous fantastic who tied his horse to a wayside cross in the snow, and afterward saw it dangling from the church-spire of what had been a buried city. But here the cross does not stand as it does {{on the top of a}} spire; but as it does on the top of an Egyptian obelisk in Rome,-- where the priests have put a cross on the top of the heathen monument; for fear it should walk. I entirely sympathise with their sentiment; and I shall try to suggest later why I think that symbol the logical culmination of heathen as well as Christian things. The traveller in the traveller's tale looked up at last and saw, from the streets far below, the spire and cross dominating a Gothic city. If I looked up in a vision and saw it dominating a Babylonian city, that blocked the heavens with monstrous palaces and temples, I should still think it natural that it should dominate. But the point here <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> saw above ground was rather the Gothic town than the Babylonian; and that it reminded me, if not specially of the cross, at least of the soldiers who took the cross.|$|E

6000|$|I thanked him, {{and shut}} the door behind me {{definitely}} on the era of examinations. But that time I did not walk on air, as on the first two occasions. I walked across the hill of many beheadings with measured steps. It was a fact, I said to myself, that I was now a British master mariner beyond a doubt. It was not that I had an exaggerated sense of that very modest achievement, with which, however, luck, opportunity, or any extraneous influence could have had nothing to do. That fact, satisfactory and obscure in itself, had for me a certain ideal significance. It was an answer to certain outspoken scepticism and even to some not very kind aspersions. I had vindicated myself from what had been cried upon as a stupid obstinacy or a fantastic caprice. I don't mean to say that a whole country had been convulsed by my desire to go to sea. But for a boy between fifteen and sixteen, sensitive enough, in all conscience, the commotion of his little world had seemed a very considerable thing indeed. So considerable that, absurdly enough, the echoes of it linger to this day. I catch myself in hours of solitude and retrospect meeting arguments and charges made thirty-five years ago by voices now forever still; finding things to say that an assailed boy could not have found, simply because of the mysteriousness of his impulses to himself. I understood no more than the people who called upon me to explain myself. There was no precedent. I verily believe mine was the only case of a boy of my nationality and antecedents taking a, so to speak, standing jump out of his racial surroundings and associations. For you must understand that there was no idea of any sort of [...] "career" [...] in my call. Of Russia or Germany there could be no question. The nationality, the antecedents, made it impossible. The feeling against the Austrian service was not so strong, and I dare say {{there would have been no}} difficulty in finding my way into the Naval School at Pola. It would have meant six months' extra grinding at German, perhaps; but I was not past the age of admission, and in other respects I was well qualified. This expedient to palliate my folly was thought of--but not by me. I must admit that in that respect my negative was accepted at once. That order of feeling was comprehensible enough to the most inimical of my critics. I was not called upon to offer explanations; but the truth <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had in view was not a naval career, but the sea. There seemed no way open to it but through France. I had the language, at any rate, and of all the countries in Europe it is with France that Poland has most connection. There were some facilities for having me a little looked after, at first. Letters were being written, answers were being received, arrangements were being made for my departure for Marseilles, where an excellent fellow called Solary, got at in a round about fashion through various French channels, had promised good-naturedly to put le jeune homme in the way of getting a decent ship for his first start if he really wanted a taste of ce metier de chien.|$|E

It is the kernel of the matter. All else, however important, is of a subordinate nature.

50|$|Peter's febrile attempt, {{similar to}} The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock's, begins with his posing a logical and poetical {{argument}} to his intended and then failing to thrust home his conclusion. Peter's unlikely {{approach is a}} frontal assault on the poor woman’s virtue::: JUST as my fingers on these keys :: Make music, so the self-same sounds :: On my spirit make a music too.:: Music is feeling then, not sound; :: And thus it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> feel,:: Here in this room, desiring you, :: Thinking of your blue-shadowed silk, :: Is music.::::(Part I)If she falls for this line, her intellectual defenses need fortifying. Quince’s argument commits a fallacy of undistributed middle. Restating his argument, one can say, “My fingers on these keys make music, which is sounds that in turn make music on my spirit. (Music makes sounds which make music inside me.) And inside me are feelings, so music must be feelings, not sounds. Thus, since my feeling for you is desire, my desire must be music.” Presumably, Peter considers music praiseworthy, so he tries to ally his desire with it.|$|E

We therefore have decided to move him to indefinite probation and waive the Chase requirement. He has fully complied with our reinstatement program during his suspension and the health care expert who conducted his evaluation recommended his immediate return. We have made it very clear to Kurt Busch our expectations for him moving forward, which includes participation in a treatment program and full compliance with all judicial requirements {{as a result of his}} off-track behavior." [...] A statement released by NASCAR executive vice-president Steve O'Donnell, relating to Kurt Busch's reinstatement. The entry list for the CampingWorld.com 500 was released on Monday, March 9, 2015 at 10:16 a.m. Eastern time. Forty-seven drivers were entered for the race, but was reduced to 46 after Ron Hornaday, Jr. and The Motorsports Group withdrew from the event. This was further reduced to 45 after Reed Sorenson's RAB Racing Toyota withdrew. Team owner Robby Benton stated that the team had [...] "no need to chase points" [...] and that [...] "after missing Las Vegas, it made sense to skip Phoenix and take the added time to better prepare for California". All 45 who were entered at Las Vegas, except for Ryan Blaney, Ty Dillon and Michael McDowell, were entered for Phoenix. The only car with a different driver was Tanner Berryhill - making his Sprint Cup début - driving in place of Mike Wallace in the No. 66 Premium Motorsports Chevrolet. Alex Kennedy was named the driver of the No. 33 Hillman-Circle Sport LLC Chevrolet. On Wednesday, March 11, NASCAR reinstated Kurt Busch and cleared him to return to active driving. As a result, he retook his No. 41 Chevrolet that has been driven by Regan Smith the last three races. In a statement, Busch stated that he understood [...] "why NASCAR needed to take the action that it did", while also stating that [...] "the important factor <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was accused of was a complete fabrication, and I never wavered through this whole process because of the confidence in the truth, and I had the support from Gene Haas and everybody at SHR, and that's where my focus has been".|$|E
5000|$|... "Peter Quince at the Clavier" [...] is a poem from Wallace Stevens's {{first book}} of poetry, Harmonium.The poem was first {{published}} in 1915 in the [...] "little magazine" [...] Others: A Magazine of the New Verse (New York), edited by Alfred Kreymborg. I Just as my fingers on these keys Make music, so the self-same sounds On my spirit make a music, too. [...] Music is feeling, then, not sound; And thus it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> feel, Here in this room, desiring you, [...] Thinking of your blue-shadowed silk, Is music. It is like the strain Waked in the elders by Susanna: [...] Of a green evening, clear and warm, She bathed in her still garden, while The red-eyed elders, watching, felt [...] The basses of their beings throb In witching chords, and their thin blood Pulse pizzicati of Hosanna.II In the green water, clear and warm, Susanna lay. She searched The touch of springs, And found Concealed imaginings. She sighed, For so much melody. [...] Upon the bank, she stood In the cool Of spent emotions. She felt, among the leaves, The dew Of old devotions. [...] She walked upon the grass, Still quavering. The winds were like her maids, On timid feet, Fetching her woven scarves, Yet wavering. [...] A breath upon her hand Muted the night. She turned-- A cymbal crashed, And roaring horns.III Soon, with a noise like tambourines, Came her attendant Byzantines. [...] They wondered why Susanna cried Against the elders by her side; [...] And as they whispered, the refrain Was like a willow swept by rain. [...] Anon, their lamps' uplifted flame Revealed Susanna and her shame. [...] And then, the simpering Byzantines, Fled, with a noise like tambourines.IV Beauty is momentary in the mind — The fitful tracing of a portal; But in the flesh it is immortal. [...] The body dies; the body's beauty lives, So evenings die, in their green going, A wave, interminably flowing. So gardens die, their meek breath scenting The cowl of Winter, done repenting. So maidens die, to the auroral Celebration of a maiden's choral. [...] Susanna's music touched the bawdy strings Of those white elders; but, escaping, Left only Death's ironic scrapings. [...] Now, in its immortality, it plays On the clear viol of her memory, And makes a constant sacrament of praise. It is a [...] "musical" [...] allusion to the apocryphal story of Susanna, a beautiful young wife, bathing, spied upon and desired by the elders. The Peter Quince of the title is the character of one of the [...] "mechanicals" [...] in Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. Stevens' poem titles are not necessarily a reliable indicator of the meaning of his poems, but Milton Bates suggests that it serves as ironic stage direction, the image of [...] "Shakespear's rude mechanical pressing the delicate keyboard with his thick fingers" [...] expressing the poet's self-deprecation and betraying Stevens's discomfort with the role of [...] "serious poet" [...] in those early years.|$|E

40|$|This essay {{examines}} interconnections between "race" {{and economic}} inequality in the United States, {{focusing on the}} case of African-Americans.

My view <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> call reward bias (unfair treatment of persons in formal economic transactions based on racial identity) is now a less significant barrier to the full participation by African-Americans in U. S. society than is what I will call development bias (blocked access to resources critical for personal development but available only via non-market-mediated social transactions). By making these points in the specific cultural and historical context of the black experience in U. S. society, I hope to contribute to a deeper conceptualization of the worldwide problem of race and economic marginality. ...|$|E
