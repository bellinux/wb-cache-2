25|$|Lessons {{learned during}} {{the early part of}} the Pacific War showed the superiority of the Bofors 40 mm gun to other {{anti-aircraft}} weapons. By the end of the war, all Colossus-class ships had swapped all their other weapons for Bofors in single <b>and</b> twin <b>mountings,</b> <b>and</b> the Majestic design had been modified to carry 30 of the guns: 18 single <b>mountings,</b> <b>and</b> 6 twin <b>mountings.</b> The number of Bofors carried by the Light Fleets was reduced after the war, with British ships carrying only eight.|$|R

50|$|By 1909 Coventry Ordnance Works had establishments, {{as well as}} at Coventry, at Scotstoun for {{manufacture}} of ordnance and gun equipment; for cordite shell loading and explosive magazines at Cliffe; and a gun-proving ground with a land range of 22,000 yards at Boston and was handling an order for 12 inch mountings of one of the new battleships. While to that time the works had been manufacturing the smaller sizes of Naval Guns <b>and</b> <b>Mountings</b> as well as Guns, Gun carriages, Ammunition and other military accessories, they had already extended their works since 1906 and had begun the {{manufacture of}} Guns and Turrets up to the largest sizes for both Battleships and Cruisers for the Admiralty. At Scotstoun a new factory had been built with a wet dock, pits and machinery for the erection and transhipping of the heaviest guns <b>and</b> <b>mountings</b> <b>and</b> hydraulic barbettes of the firm's own design but it was unused until 1911.

50|$|Often the veils, ribbons <b>and</b> <b>mountings,</b> or rods {{have been}} lost.

50|$|During {{this period}} there were between 40 and 60 {{workshops}} with founders, gilders, silverers, and chasers in Paris. The founders usually made a wax model from a draft {{and from this}} wax model a negative plaster cast was made, which could be reproduced more often. Then using this plaster cast a mould was made, in which the bronze was cast. By combining figures <b>and</b> <b>mountings</b> several versions of one design were produced.|$|R

However, this complicated the supply of ammunition in the field, and was replaced in 1944 by the Sexton, which was designed and mostly manufactured in Canada (some 2/3 of ordnances <b>and</b> <b>mountings</b> were imported from the UK due to limited Canadian production capacity) and mounted the 25-pounder on a Ram or Grizzly tank chassis.|$|R
