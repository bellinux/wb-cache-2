The villagers spread the news across the region, and John Geoffrey, a local bailiff, rode between Brentwood and Chelmsford, {{rallying}} support. On 4 June, the rebels gathered at Bocking, where their future plans seem to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>discussed.</b> The Essex rebels, possibly {{a few thousand}} strong, advanced towards London, some probably travelling directly and others via Kent.

Chris Buffa felt that the stereotypes could be considered offensive while Giant Bomb's Ryan Davis felt that there was nothing legitimately offensive.|$|E

5|$|The PTC's {{response}} to the strike was anemic and was interpreted by some contemporary observers and later historians as tacitly supporting the strike. Arthur Mitten, chairman of the company's Industrial Relations Division, stopped by the Luzerne carbarn and asked the workers to return to work. Subsequently, he suggested that WMC temporarily suspend the non-discrimination order, and even brought a pile of freshly printed fliers with a suspension announcement to the WMC offices. However, the WMC officials refused to approve suspension of the FEPC order and Mitten's suspension fliers were not distributed. On the morning of August 1, PTC officials immediately shut down the high-speed lines, even before the strike had spread, and instructed the company supervisors to stop selling tickets. The PTC left its carbarns open, which allowed the strikers to use the carbarns as rallying points and coordinating centers for their activities. The company also cancelled the regularly scheduled meeting of its executive committee, where the {{response to}} the strike could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>discussed,</b> and refused to join the TWU in a radio broadcast urging the strikers to return to work.|$|E
