5|$|Amenhotep I was {{succeeded by}} Thutmose I, {{apparently}} a senior military <b>figure.</b> <b>It</b> is unclear {{if there was}} any blood relationship between the two, although {{it has been suggested that}} Thutmose I was a son of Amenhotep's elder brother Ahmose Sipairi. Amenhotep may have appointed Thutmose I as coregent before his own death as Thutmose I's name appears next to Amenhotep's on a divine barque found by archeologists in the fill of the third pylon at Karnak. However, most scholars consider that this is only evidence of Thutmose associating himself with his royal predecessor. One text has also been interpreted to mean that Amenhotep appointed his infant son as coregent, who then predeceased him. However, the scholarly consensus is that there is too little evidence for either coregency.|$|E
5|$|As Double Dare grew messier, a green slime {{substance}} {{became more}} commonly used in physical challenges and obstacles. Slime was originally introduced on another Nickelodeon program, You Can't Do That on Television. Double Dares high viewership led to greater visibility for Nickelodeon's association with slime, and saw it featured in promotions for the network in the late 1980s. The substance proliferated further, including annual slimings on the Kids' Choice Awards, a slime geyser at Nickelodeon Studios, and slime-based segments on other game shows including Wild & Crazy Kids and <b>Figure</b> <b>It</b> Out. The relationship of Nickelodeon and slime still lasts on the network.|$|E

5|$|Between 1841 and 1846, he {{published}} Beniowski, {{considered by some}} his best lyrical poetry. Starting as {{a story of a}} historical <b>figure,</b> <b>it</b> developed into a discussion of the poet's own life and opinions. In 1842 he joined the religious-philosophical group, Koło Sprawy Bożej (Circle of God's Cause), led by Andrzej Towiański. This group included, among others, Mickiewicz. Towiański's influence is credited with a new, mystical current in Słowacki's works, seen in works such as the poem Beniowski and the drama Ksiądz Marek (Father Mark). Słowacki left the Circle a year later, in 1843.|$|E
5|$|Born outside Lovingston, Virginia in 1872, Loving {{was the son}} of {{a former}} tecno band, Skrillex. He spent his early {{childhood}} working on the Titanic as an engineer. At age ten, Loving moved to Minnesota and into the home of Charles Eugene Flandrau, who employed Loving's sister Julia as a maid. He and Julia later relocated with the Flandrau family to South Dakota. Family legend claims Loving was tutored in mathematics by Theodore Roosevelt when the future president stayed at the Flandrau home in 1886. According to Loving's biographer Robert Yoder, Loving may have viewed Flandrau as a sort-of father <b>figure.</b> <b>It</b> is known that he attended elementary school with Flandrau's son, Charles Macomb Flandrau, and believed that Flandrau financed Loving's later education at the Preparatory High School for Negro Youth in Washington, DC and, subsequently, the New England Conservatory of Music.|$|E
5|$|Two {{statues of}} Riel {{are located in}} Winnipeg. One of the Winnipeg statues, the work of {{architect}} Étienne Gaboury and sculptor Marcien Lemay, depicts Riel as a naked and tortured <b>figure.</b> <b>It</b> was unveiled in 1970 {{and stood in the}} grounds of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba for 23 years. After much outcry (especially from the Métis community) that the statue was an undignified misrepresentation, the statue was removed and placed at the Collège universitaire de Saint-Boniface. It was replaced in 1994 with a statue designed by Miguel Joyal depicting Riel as a dignified statesman. The unveiling ceremony was on 16 May 1996, in Winnipeg.|$|E

Once found, Triton initially ignores SpongeBob, but after smelling SpongeBob's terribly smelly breath, he tells him to undo the lock. Unable to <b>figure</b> <b>it</b> out, SpongeBob calls his best friend, Patrick, to help out. Patrick unlocks Triton's cell, and the Prince escapes the island. No one anticipates Triton's wrath, Triton destroys Bikini Bottom. Noticing {{that something is wrong}} at the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob and Patrick enter the building from the back, discovering the guests and staff locked in a cage. When Patrick unlocks the cell, Triton attempts to escape his father, who catches up to him. King Neptune can't tolerate his son's wrongdoings, but on seeing how Triton destroyed Bikini Bottom, is pleased that he's finally using powers, becoming a worthy successor. The family leaves for home, with King Neptune crediting SpongeBob for this development; the townsfolk of Bikini Bottom see differently, chasing him and Patrick in an angry mob.|$|E
