6000|$|But it {{is obvious}} that if it is only right for a man to spend money on that which he can truly and {{thoroughly}} enjoy, the doctrine applies with equal force to the rich and to the poor, to the man who has amassed many thousands {{as well as to the}} youth precariously beginning life. And it may be asked, Is not this merely preparing misers, who are not the best of company? But the principle was this: that which a man has not fairly earned, and, further, that which he cannot fully enjoy, does not belong to him, but is a part of mankind’s treasure which he holds as steward on parole. To mankind, then, it must be made profitable; and how this should be done is, once more, a problem which each man must solve for himself, and about which none has a right to judge him. Yet there are a few considerations which are very obvious and may here be stated. Mankind is not only the whole in general, but every one in particular. Every man or woman is one of mankind’s dear possessions; to his or her just brain, and kind heart, and active hands, mankind intrusts some of its hopes for the future; he or she is a possible well-spring of good acts and source of blessings to the race. This money which you do not need, which, in a rigid sense, you do not want, may therefore be returned not only in public benefactions to the race, but in private kindnesses. Your wife, your children, your friends stand nearest to you, and should be helped the first. There at least there can be little imposture, for you know their necessities of your own knowledge. And consider, if all the world did as you did, and according to their means <b>extended</b> <b>help</b> in the circle of their affections, there would be no more crying want in times of plenty and no more cold, mechanical charity given with a doubt and received with confusion.

50|$|The {{history of}} the Presentation Convent Higher Secondary School Srinagar begins with Maharaja Hari Singh’s imploring the then Catholic Church Head of Kashmir to implore the Presentation Sisters of Rawalpindi to launch a school here in Srinagar. They acceded to the request and three sisters - Mother M. Peter Conway, Sr. M. Annunciatia and Sr. Xavier - came here and rented a {{bungalow}} at Boulvard Srinagar adjacent to pleasant world famous Dal Lake and opened a school which they named as Presentation Convent. They made it operational on the 17th of March, 1936 but in the beginning, the students were foreigners only especially Britishers residing in Srinagar. This school was almater of Maharaja Hari Singh’s son as well and all teachers then were Europeans only. It had in the beginning mostly children of European family, on its rolls, who were residing in Srinagar. Those who joined it were very lucky for they had true English ambience around them throughout. Hence, catching or picking the language was very easy. The number of the local students was initially very less but it grew {{with the passing of}} time and a patch of land was rented on the beautiful banks of River Jhelum where a fresh building was constructed and later was thrown open on the 9th of June, 1939 by Maharaja Hari Singh himself. It was in 1947 that the school was closed for some months due to the political disturbance and the partition seconded by the tribal invasions. However, it was soon restarted by 1964 and the number of students reached 800. Unfortunately, in 1965, a devastating fire razed down literary the whole new structure to ashes and as such the school was made functional in a three storeyed youth hostel by the Government. The Government came to its rescue and <b>extended</b> <b>help</b> in rebuilding a fresh structure on the devastated site. Since then the school has grown heavily and has emerged as the best centre of education for girls. Today, it is senior secondary institute and has dedicated itself fully towards the spread of English education across the state especially in the valley.|$|E
50|$|HISTORY OF DR. G.D. ALAM:Dr. G.D. Alam {{was born}} in 1937 and educated at Government College Tamman Campbelpur (Now Attock) and at the Government College, Lahore. He did his M.Sc in Physics under the well known Nuclear Scientist late Professor Rafi Muhammad Chaudhri of Government College. Even in his studies he showed great skill in {{experimental}} science and doing things with his own hands. Finding this quality, Professor Chaudhri {{put him on the}} M.Sc thesis for utilizations of the 1.2 Mev cock roft Walton accelerator, then recently installed nuclear machine of great importance the only one in Pakistan. This accelerator was installed at the well known Atomic Laboratory, the High Tension Lab. of the Government College. Dr. G.D. Alam showed great experimental skill in this work and Professor Chaudhri was great admirer of his experimental acumen.After M.Sc Dr. Alam did a brief lecturing in Physics at the Murray College Sialkot and rightly was picked up by Dr. I.H.Usmani in early 1962 to provide him advanced training in U.K. under the Colombo Plan Scholarship. Dr. Alam completed his Ph.D in Atomic Physics under Professor J.B. Hasted at the University College, London in 1967. His work on the development of atomic ion sources as his Ph.D research was extensively referred by other scientists in this field and particularly in the famous book of Professor Hasted written on the subject of Atomic Collisions.On return from his higher studies in 1967, Dr. G.D. Alam was posted at PINSTECH in the Nuclear Physics Division and was assigned the work on Fission Physics being carried out at the newly installed 5MW Swimming Pool Research Reactor. These experiments required again a great skill in experimental Nuclear Physics and Dr. G.D. Alam did these experiments with great enthusiasm. He spent a year at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory under the bilateral agreement between PINSTECH and ORNL. He returned to Pakistan in 1970 and worked for some more years at PINSTECH as Group Leader of the Fission Group of the Nuclear Physics Divisions. He was then called to an important project on Uranium-Enrichment in 1976 started by the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission which later became an independent project under the management of Dr. A.Q. Khan. Other scientists from PINSTECH were sent to this project including Dr. J.A.Mirza, Mr. Anwar Ali, Dr. F.H.Hashmi and several others {{from time to time in}} these early years of the project.Dr. G.D. Alam worked along with the other scientist mostly sent by PINSTECH, selflessly and with a dedication where the working time was of no consideration. His team worked day and night for several years and played a major role in the setting up and operation of the centrifuges for uranium - enrichment. By early eighties Dr. G.D. Alam had set up successful results and his team was the first to establish the enrichment of uranium done through the machines which they had set up. It was indeed an historic contribution by this team to the success of the project for uranium enrichment and in the process a large number of technicians and scientists who worked with his team gained a very useful experience and although Dr. G.D. Alam had to return to PAEC because of certain departmental differences, but the trained manpower and the operating centrifuges he left behind were a great scientific/engineering contributions to the uranium enrichment project now well known as A.Q.Khan Research Laboratories.His contribution to this project has not been properly recognized. While a number of scientists and engineers were awarded civil awards in recognition of their efforts to this project, but the silent hero of the project whose contribution was fundamental at the crucial stages of this project remained unrewarded.On return to PAEC, Dr. G.D. Alam was posted as Head of the Computer Division where he worked hard to expand the computer facilities to the scientific users as well as <b>extended</b> <b>help</b> to the many operations of the nuclear equipment through computer control. His versatile genius always extending hand to many scientists at PINSTECH for solving the computer problems. At the time the project of renovating the electronics of the 5MW reactor was in the offering. Dr. G.D. Alam offered himself to take up this gigantic job of complete setting up the control system of the reactor. This was done successfully in collaboration with Dr. Aijaz Karim so well, that the reactor has been operating so well with this control system since 1986.Dr. G.D. Alam was then called to head the technical company (Pvt.) Ltd by the name of M/S Al-Technique Corporation which is being run by the Board of Governors with PAEC Chairman as its head. The company has the main units of sterilization of medical products through gamma radiation and the laboratory for testing of soil particularly for nuclear power plants. Both these units are being run at Lahore on commercial lines.This is where Dr. G.D. Alam retired as Executive Director of this Corporation. Dr. G.D. Alam’s versatility is evident from the variety of technical organizations where he made so successful contributions which will be remembered for long time to come. His personality as a man of versatility is also reflected in the wit he often showed with great laughter with appropriate jokes suited to the occasion. On his retirement ceremony, Dr. N.M. Butt the former Director General of PINSTECH, a class fellow of Dr. G.D. Alam of the Government College days and having in constants interaction with Dr. G.D. Alam throughout the year till his retirement amply testified to the versatility of his great experimentalist who took great pleasure by plunging his hands into the experiments and instruments here in. He has died peacefully in 2000. His services will be long remembered in Pakistan Nuclear History.|$|E
