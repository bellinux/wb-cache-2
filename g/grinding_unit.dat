A typical industrial mill is composed of a cylindrical metallic drum that usually contains steel spheres.

40|$|The grain <b>grinding</b> {{business}} <b>unit</b> {{is needed}} by the farmer to process the harvest but also in particular, it creates air pollution from its dusty materials. The worker or operator has a potential risk of being contaminated by the dusty materials and lungs vital capacity reduction. This research is aimed to analyze {{the effects of the}} grain grinding polluting dust to wards the lungs vital capacity of workers at Abiansemal in Badung District. This research is sort of an analytical observation with cross sectional design. The number of chosen samples is 32 workers with a total sampling method among 16 grain <b>grinding</b> business <b>units.</b> The data resources is a primary data which obtained using questionnaire, the measurement and observation include: the worker's characteristic (working term, age, and height), dust value, breath frequency and lungs vital capacity. The data is analyzed using regression statistic. The result of the research indicates that the amount of dust at the grain <b>grinding</b> business <b>unit</b> is around 10, 0079 - 11, 6151 mg/m 3, working term is one to 44 years, age 22 - 62, and height 155 - 175 cm, the condition of the grinding room is 93, 75 % does not meet the ventilation standard, 100 % is not provided with dust control tool, 97, 75 % does not provide mask and 93, 75 % is situated in a housing are. The conclusion of the research is that dust level, working term and height in particular has a significant correlation with lungs vital capacity (p 0, 05). The higher level of dust makes the higher lungs vital capacity reduction, the longer working term makes the lower lungs vital capacity and the taller of workers height. indicates the higher workers lungs vital capacity. The impact of dusty materials of grain <b>grinding</b> business <b>unit</b> towards the workers is the decreasing of workers lungs vital capacity by the disorder of lungs restriction function (65, 62 %). It is suggested to the business owner to conduct technical controls. Workers are strongly recommended to put on mask, have sufficient nutrition supplies and workers with the age over 40 years should not work in j:his area. For the health department of Badung District should implement any efforts of K 3, and for other relevant departments which take a part in giving recommendation must consider a requirement to make it outside the housing area. </p...|$|R
5000|$|On a {{vertical}} band knife machine usually a narrow width band knife blade is used, {{the most common}} width being 10mm. The length of the band knife blade depends on the supplier of the band knife machine. The dimensions are indicated on a small metal tag pasted or riveted on the machine. The vertical machine band knife blade is most commonly a [...] "double bevel, double edge DBDE" [...] execution to enable cutting while advancing the table and also while retracting the work table, while as the [...] "double bevel, single edge DBSE" [...] execution cuts only in one direction.

40|$|Pounded yam {{is one of}} {{the staple}} in Africa. Unfortunately its {{traditional}} method of preparation is still time and energy consuming with low production output. A faster method of preparing instant yam flour with less energy requirement is therefore needed. A brief report on the design and development of yam flour processing system is hereby presented. The preliminary design of the system was done, followed by a detailed design to determine the specifications of the component parts. The slicing unit is made of six stainless blades which slice the yam tuber into smaller sizes of 2 mm thickness. The system has efficient drying and <b>grinding</b> <b>units.</b> The machine makes an average of 2 slices per second. An output efficiency of 82 per cent was achieved. It was observed that the size of chips affected the drying rate. Boiling of the yam chips was found to prolong drying time. This is because cooked yam dices have dense structure resulting from partial or complete gelatinization of starch granules. It is thus recommended that yam chips should not exceed 5 mm in thickness and should not be cooked to avoid prolonged drying. Of course the drying chamber should be insulated...|$|R
