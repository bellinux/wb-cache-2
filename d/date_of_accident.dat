40|$|Background and Aim: Undercounting is {{a common}} problem in {{surveillance}} systems and registries. One of the procedures {{has been used for}} assessing sensitivity of a surveillance system or completeness of a registry is capture-recapture method. The objective {{of the present study was}} to estimate the number of deaths due to road traffic injuries applying capture-recapture method and using three data sources: police, legal medicine organization and hospital. Material and Methods: All of the deaths due to traffic injuries occurred within Kerman district in the year 2000 were derived from police, Shahid Bahonar hospital and Kerman legal medicine data sources. Matching cases between the lists was based on three characteristics: first name, family name and <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>accident.</b> Loglinear model was used for statistical analysis. Results: The total number of identified cases was 471; the best fitted loglinear model estimated the actual  number of deaths as 596 (CI 95 %: 543 - 686). Based on Iranian Statistical Center estimates, the population of Kerman district in the year 2000 has been 644673; so the cause-specific mortality rate of traffic injuries is estimated as 92 (CI 95 %: 84 - 107) per 100, 000 population. Therefore the proportion of deaths registered in police, legal medicine and Shahid Bahonar hospital are 16 %, 58 % and 48 % respectively. The coverage of total deaths (471) is about 79 %. Conclusion: The findings showed that none of the data sources had enough coverage of all deaths due to traffic injuries. Capture-recapture estimates can help for obtaining better estimates...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIM: The study {{aimed to}} assess the {{frequency}} of head and face injuries in motorcyclists who had an accident {{and to find out}} the relationship between helmet use and frequency of these injuries. METHODS: A cross-sectional study with multi-stage sampling method provides data on the injured motorcyclists with road accidents. Data came from a registration form which has documented information of each injured person who had a road accident and hospitalized in the biggest hospital of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Iran (Al-Zahra). All the registration forms were surveyed for hospitalization period, treatment costs, severity of injury, and <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>accident</b> during 2010 (n = 1626). Later, among the list of injured motorcyclists during the last 3 months of the registration form, 125 cases were randomly selected and interviewed by phone regarding occurrence of the head and face injuries and whether wearing helmet during the accident. Confidence intervals (CI), Chi-square, and Phi and Cramer’s correlation coefficient were applied. The ethical approval was provided. RESULTS: Accident by motorcycle was 31. 0 % of all road accidents. The frequency of motorcycle accidents was higher in the autumn and among 21 - 25 year olds. The mean period of hospitalization was 4. 3 days and the mean of hospital costs was about 9000000 Rials [about 8200 United States dollar (USD), in 2010]. Of motorcyclist, 35. 0 % reported they were helmeted when they had the accident. The frequency of head and face injuries was 51. 0 % among all the injured motorcyclists, 22. 0 % and 78. 0 % among the helmeted and non-helmeted motorcyclists, respectively (P = 0. 009, r = - 0. 267). CONCLUSION: Motorcycle accidents comprise a large number of road accidents and cause substantial morbidity and financial impact for the community members. Head and face injuries are the most common trauma in motorcyclists, and the injury rate is higher among non-helmeted motorcyclists.

Methods: An observational, retrospective study was undertaken by the analysis of secondary data in a sample universe comprehending 768 autopsy reports of individuals aged 19 years or older who were fatal victims of external causes in 2005. The following variables were analyzed: gender, age group, time and <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>accident,</b> intention inflicted by the act (whether intentional or not), and the cause of death.
