25|$|The BP {{oil spill}} in the Gulf of Mexico {{affected}} Florida's number one industry, which is tourism. The lack of a relief well prevented company officials from shutting down the leak immediately. Instead, it took months to drill a new relief well, while millions of <b>gallons</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> gushed into the Gulf each week. In response, Grayson introduced the Emergency Relief Well Act, which would require that an emergency relief well be drilled {{at the same time}} as any new exploratory well.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in the 18th century, {{northern}} elephant seals were hunted extensively, {{almost to}} extinction {{by the end}} of the 19th century, being prized for oil made from their blubber, and the population may have fallen as low as only 20 individuals. In 1874, Charles Melville Scammon recorded in Marine Mammals of the Northwestern Coast of America, that an 18-ft-long bull caught on Santa Barbara Island yielded 210 <b>gallons</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil.</b> They were thought to be extinct in 1884 until a remnant population of eight individuals was discovered on Guadalupe Island in 1892 by a Smithsonian expedition, who promptly killed seven of the eight for their collections. The elephant seals managed to survive, and were finally protected by the Mexican government in 1922. Since the early 20th century, they have been protected by law in both Mexico and in the United States. Subsequently, the U.S. protection was strengthened after passage of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, and numbers have now recovered to over 100,000.|$|E
25|$|The first horrea {{were built}} in Rome {{towards the end of}} the 2nd century BC, with the first known public horreum being {{constructed}} by the ill-fated tribune Gaius Gracchus in 123 BC. The word came to be applied any place designated for the preservation of goods; thus it was often used refer to cellars (horrea subterranea), but it could also be applied to a place where artworks were stored, or even to a library. Some public horrea functioned somewhat like banks, where valuables could be stored, but the most important class of horrea were those where foodstuffs such as grain and olive oil were stored and distributed by the state. Rome's insatiable demands for foodstuffs meant that the amount of goods that passed through some of the city's horrea was immense, even by modern standards. The artificial hill of Monte Testaccio in Rome, which stands behind the site of the Horrea Galbae, is estimated to contain the remains of at least 53 million olive oil amphorae in which some 6 billion litres (1.58 billion <b>gallons)</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> were imported.|$|E

25|$|When a 8m (26ft) long whale was sighted, chalupas (chaloupes in French, {{and later}} shallops in English) were sent out, each manned by a steersman, five oarsmen, and a harpooner. The whale was harpooned {{and forced to}} tow a wooden drogue or drag, which was used to tire the whale. Once exhausted, the whale was lanced and killed. If {{darkness}} fell upon the crews before they returned, those ashore would light signal fires at the vigías to guild {{them back to the}} station. The whales were brought alongside a wharf or cutting stage, where they were flensed. The blubber was tried out, cooled, and poured into barricas – casks of oak that held 55 <b>gallons</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil.</b> These casks were towed out to the ship by a boat, where they were stored in the hold. When a full cargo had been obtained, either during the right whale season, or, more often during the later bowhead season, many of the larger ships sailed to Pasaia to discharge their cargoes; they also fitted out of the same port. Pasaia was preferred by both French and Spanish Basques because of its deep-water entrance and the excellent shelter it provided from Biscay storms.|$|E

500|$|The {{huge numbers}} of broken amphorae at Monte Testaccio {{illustrate}} the enormous demand for oil of imperial Rome, which {{was at the time}} the world's largest city with a population of at least one million people. It has been estimated that the hill contains the remains of as many as 53million olive oil amphorae, in which some 6billion litres (1.3billion imperial gallons/1.6billion U.S. <b>gallons)</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> were imported. Studies of the hill's composition suggest that Rome's imports of olive oil reached a peak {{towards the end of the}} 2nd century AD, when as many as 130,000 amphorae were being deposited on the site each year. The vast majority of those vessels had a capacity of some from this it has been estimated that Rome was importing at least 7.5million liters (1.6million imperial gal/2million U.S. gal) of olive oil annually. As the vessels found at Monte Testaccio appear to represent mainly state-sponsored olive oil imports, it is very likely that considerable additional quantities of olive oil were imported privately.|$|E
500|$|The record-breaking {{rainfall}} in Guam produced severe {{flooding and}} numerous landslides throughout the island. A total of 57 homes were destroyed and another 624 were damaged. Crop damages {{on the island}} amounted to $500,000 {{with most of the}} farmers reporting total crop losses. One person died after being swept away along a flooded road. Total property damages totaled to $6million. Most of the damage on Rota resulted from flooding and high seas. The port on the island suffered $1million in damages and crop losses amounted to $500,000. The same day that Tingting made its closest approach to Guam, a 19-year-old was swept off a reef and drowned in rough seas produced by the typhoon. [...] On Tinian and Saipan, unlike Guam and Rota, most of the damage was a result of the winds. A total of 4 homes were destroyed and 24 others sustained major damage on Tinian while another 4 were destroyed, 81 sustained major damage, and another 101 were affected on Saipan. Schools on the two islands sustained a combined $92,737 in damages. At Saipan's port, an oil tanker sank, spilling thousands of <b>gallons</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> into the water.|$|E

500|$|Before {{setting out}} on the South Pole journey, Scott had made {{arrangements}} intended to help the polar party home, {{with the use of}} dogs. Meares, who was expected to have returned to Cape Evans by 19 December, had been instructed that in late December or early January he should transport to One Ton Depot [...] "Five XS rations , 3 cases of biscuit, 5 <b>gallons</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> and as much dog food as you can conveniently carry". If this mission could not be carried out by dogs, then [...] "at all hazard" [...] a man-hauling team was to carry the XS rations to the depot. Meares had been further instructed that in about the first week in February, depending on news received from returning units, he should set out, with dogs, with a view to meeting the returning polar party between latitudes 82° or 82°30' on about 1 March. The objective of these orders was to hasten the party back to Cape Evans before Terra Nova left, so that news of the polar conquest could be carried immediately to New Zealand. Scott placed greater emphasis on the former journey than on the latter: [...] "Whilst the object of your third journey is important, that of the second is vital".|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, on 4 February, Mackay and {{his group}} (Murray and Beuchat, joined by seaman Stanley Morris) {{announced}} they were leaving the next day, to seek land. Mackay presented Bartlett with a letter dated 1 February that began: [...] "We, the undersigned, in consideration of the present critical situation, desire to make an attempt to reach the land." [...] The letter requested appropriate supplies, and concluded by emphasising that the journey was on their own initiative and absolving Bartlett from all responsibilities. Bartlett allocated them a sledge, a tent, six <b>gallons</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil,</b> a rifle and ammunition and food for 50 days. They left on 5 February; the last sighting {{of them was a}} few days later, by Chafe and the Inuit, returning from their abortive trip to Herald Island. They found Mackay's party struggling to make headway, with some of their provisions lost and clothing and other equipment discarded to lighten their load. Beuchat in particular was in a distressed state, nearly delirious and in the throes of hypothermia. However, the party refused assistance and rejected Chafe's pleas that they return with him to Shipwreck Camp. Thereafter the only hint of their fate was a sailor's scarf belonging to Morris, later found buried in an ice floe. It was assumed that the four had either been crushed by the ice, or had fallen through it.|$|E

60|$|BOOK II. (Octavo), CHAPTER II. (Black Fish).--I {{give the}} popular fishermen's names {{for all these}} fish, for {{generally}} they are the best. Where any name happens to be vague or inexpressive, I shall say so, and suggest another. I do so now touching the Black Fish, so called because blackness is the rule among almost all whales. So, call him the Hyena Whale, if you please. His voracity is well known and from the circumstance that the inner angles of his lips are curved upwards, he carries an everlasting Mephistophelean grin on his face. This whale averages some sixteen or eighteen feet in length. He is found in almost all latitudes. He has a peculiar way of showing his dorsal hooked fin in swimming, which looks something like a Roman nose. When not more profitably employed, the sperm whale hunters sometimes capture the Hyena whale, {{to keep up the}} supply of cheap oil for domestic employment-- as some frugal housekeepers, in the absence of company, and quite alone by themselves, burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous wax. Though their blubber is very thin, some of these whales will yield you upwards of thirty <b>gallons</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil.</b>|$|E
6000|$|But as {{you come}} nearer to this great head {{it begins to}} assume {{different}} aspects, according to your point of view. If you stand on its summit and look at these two f-shaped spout-holes, you would take the whole head for an enormous bass viol, and these spiracles, the apertures in its soundingboard. Then, again, if you fix your eye upon this strange, crested, comblike incrustation {{on the top of}} the mass--this green, barnacled thing, which the Greenlanders call the [...] "crown," [...] and the Southern fishers the [...] "bonnet" [...] of the Right Whale; fixing your eyes solely on this, you would take the head for the trunk of some huge oak, with a bird's nest in its crotch. At any rate, when you watch those live crabs that nestle here on this bonnet, such an idea will be almost sure to occur to you; unless, indeed, your fancy has been fixed by the technical term [...] "crown" [...] also bestowed upon it; in which case you will take great interest in thinking how this mighty monster is actually a diademed king of the sea, whose green crown has been put together for him in this marvellous manner. But if this whale be a king, he is a very sulky looking fellow to grace a diadem. Look at that hanging lower lip! what a huge sulk and pout is there! a sulk and pout, by carpenter's measurement, about twenty feet long and five feet deep; a sulk and pout that will yield you some 500 <b>gallons</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> and more.|$|E
