5|$|During the {{production}} of his previous directorial venture Kites (2010), the director Anurag Basu wrote a two-page short story which was later developed to the script of Barfi!. The film script that Basu wrote alternated between two time periods, and he retained the nonlinear narrative structure. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> script required a 30-year time span for the characters' love to grow and thus set {{the backdrop of the}} film in the 1970s.|$|E

5|$|Sato {{estimated}} the game's budget at US$3–5 million. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> development team {{intended to make}} Silent Hill a masterpiece rather than a traditional sales-oriented game, and that they opted for an engaging story, which would persist over time – similar to successful literature.

He argued this was the type of error that Conley would have made, rather than Frank, as Conley was a sweeper and not a Cornell-educated manager like Frank.|$|E
5|$|William Edward Forster, Chief Secretary for Ireland made {{it clear}} in a {{communication}} with the proprietor of the Dublin Daily Express {{that he would not}} allow an armed expedition of hundreds of men, as the committee was planning, and that 50 unarmed men would be sufficient to harvest the crops. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> government would consider it their duty to protect this group. On 10 November 1880, the relief expedition consisting of one contingent from County Cavan and one from County Monaghan left for County Mayo.

5|$|Writing {{after all}} seven books had been published, Graeme Davis {{regarded}} Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets as the weakest of the series, and {{agreed that the}} plot structure {{is much the same}} as in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.

However, as its singles attained radio airplay and Miguel toured in its promotion, the album became a sleeper hit and helped him garner an audience and commercial standing. He also garnered a following with his fervent concert performances. After Jive was shut down and absorbed by RCA Records, Miguel acquired a new marketing team to develop himself {{as more than a}} typical urban artist, having felt pigeonholed into being marketed as one by Jive. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> experience of balancing creativity and business sense on his first album made him more confident in his approach on Kaleidoscope Dream.|$|E
5|$|After the tender, 80 {{employees}} {{were transferred to}} the subsidiary, including the director, chartered engineer Arne Fosen. To the press <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> increased efficiency in the organization was related to a small administration, {{and being able to}} use uniform trains. Previously both locomotive-hauled trains, as well as Class 70 and Class 69 trains had been used. Following the PSO, NSB Anbud would operate nine Class 69g trains, which are somewhat smaller than the locomotive-hauled and Class 70 trains. These would be owned by NSB, but rented by the subsidiary. The ministry would pay for a NOK 40 million overhaul of the stock. Representatives from the labor union said they feared for the flexibility of NSB, since 80 {{employees were}} now bound up in serving only a single line. Margareth Nordby replaced Fosen as director in August.|$|E
5|$|Both in 1991 {{and years}} later, Špegelj criticised Tuđman's {{decision}} to disregard his advice {{to attack the}} JNA barracks earlier than Septemberspecifically during the Ten-Day War in Slovenia in JuneJuly 1991. Špegelj said that an earlier move, preempting deterioration of the strategic situation in Croatia, would best serve Croatian defensive needs. Furthermore, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> JNA {{would be unable to}} respond in force because it would need two months to mobilise the required forces and that all prerequisites for a decisive victory against the JNA were met. Tus thought that Tuđman kept postponing the blockade because of the pressure applied by the international community against confrontation with the JNA. Zdravko Tomac, deputy prime minister of a national unity government in Croatia at the time, and later an opposition leader, stated that while Špegelj's view was militarily correct, Tuđman's position was politically better. Kadijević conversely said that the JNA would have fared better if Croatian forces had confronted it earlier because the JNA's capabilities declined during the summer of 1991.|$|E
