5|$|After <b>hearing</b> <b>from</b> Whitlam, Kerr called Fraser. According to Fraser, Kerr {{asked him}} whether he, if {{commissioned}} Prime Minister, could secure supply, would immediately thereafter advise a double-dissolution election, and would refrain from new policies and investigations of the Whitlam Government pending the election. Fraser stated that he agreed. Kerr denied the exchange took place via telephone, though both men agree those questions were asked {{later in the day}} before Kerr commissioned Fraser as Prime Minister. According to Kerr, Fraser was supposed to come to Yarralumla at 1.00pm.|$|E
5|$|During his labors {{to sustain}} the {{provisional}} government, Johnson's lack of <b>hearing</b> <b>from</b> his family weighed heavily upon him. The only family member {{with whom he had}} contact was his son Madison ("Matty"), who had joined John Hunt Morgan's cavalry. Johnson admired and respected Morgan, and was pleased that his son had chosen to serve under him. In 1862, he requested by letter that his wife send their fifteen-year-old son Junius to serve in the Confederate Army. Despite Johnson's protestations that he would ensure his son's safety, his wife refused this request.|$|E
5|$|In April 10, 2015 Marylin Zuniga, {{a teacher}} at Forest Street Elementary School in Orange, New Jersey, was {{suspended}} without pay after asking her students to write letters to Abu-Jamal, who fell ill in prison due to complications from diabetes, without approval from the school or parents. Some parents and police leaders denounced her actions. On the other hand, community members, parents, teachers, and professors expressed their support and condemned Zuniga's suspension. Scholars and educators nationwide including Noam Chomsky, Chris Hedges and Cornel West among others signed a letter calling for her immediate reinstatement. On May 13, 2015 The Orange Preparatory Academy board voted to dismiss Marylin Zuniga after <b>hearing</b> <b>from</b> her and several of her supporters.|$|E

5|$|It is {{believed}} that initial investigations into the treatment of Afghan detainees sparked investigations into Canada's elite military unit, Joint Task Force 2 (JTF2). The first investigation, named Sand Trap, examined allegations that a JTF2 member {{was involved in the}} 2006 shooting death of an Afghan who was surrendering. No charges were laid {{at the conclusion of the}} investigation. However, a larger investigation called Sand Trap II began <b>hearing</b> <b>from</b> witnesses in May 2009 regarding allegations of JTF2 members witnessing United States armed forces killing an unarmed man. This investigation is still being conducted by the Canadian Forces National Investigation Service, and it has led to calls for civilian oversight of JTF2.|$|E
5|$|Mose Wright {{stayed on}} his front porch for twenty minutes waiting for Till to return. He did {{not go back to}} bed.

After <b>hearing</b> <b>from</b> Wright that he would not call the police because he feared for his life, Curtis Jones placed a call to the Leflore County sheriff, and another to his mother in Chicago. Distraught, she called Emmett's mother Mamie Till Bradley. Wright and his wife Elizabeth drove to Sumner, where Elizabeth's brother contacted the sheriff.|$|E
5|$|On 12 November 2012, Gorrostieta Salazar {{was driving}} her {{daughter}} to school in Morelia at around 8:30a.m. when a vehicle ran them off the road. Two armed men descended from their vehicle and forced {{her out of her}} car as onlookers watched. Gorrostieta Salazar pleaded with her abductors to let her daughter go unharmed, and then agreed to go with the kidnappers. The family of the former mayor initially thought it was a ransom kidnapping. After not <b>hearing</b> <b>from</b> Gorrostieta Salazar or her abductors for two days, they notified the police. On 15 November, police identified the body after farm workers from the rural community of San Juan Tararameo in Cuitzeo found the corpse on their way to work.|$|E

5|$|On 15 November 2004, Shaftesbury's Nice-based lawyer, Thierry Bensaude {{reported}} him missing, {{after being}} contacted by his girlfriend, Orche. The peer divided {{his time between}} the Riviera and a home in Hove, East Sussex. He had been due to return home on 10 November. After not <b>hearing</b> <b>from</b> Shaftesbury in a week, they remained concerned when he failed {{to return to his}} rented flat in Adelaide Crescent, Hove. Bensaude and Orche both expressed fears for his safety. Shaftesbury had been taking legal action in relation to the theft of some family antiques and artwork. Some friends and acquaintances mentioned that he had complained of money problems, so they surmised that his disappearance may {{have had something to do}} with the theft and financial loss.|$|E

When Ed arrives, Scully tells him that they found blood in his neighbor's apartment and that it was likely his.

5|$|In 1963, Wilder {{was cast}} in {{a leading role in}} Mother Courage and Her Children, a {{production}} starring Anne Bancroft, who introduced Wilder to her boyfriend (and later husband) Mel Brooks. A few months later, Brooks mentioned that he was working on a screenplay called Springtime for Hitler, for which he thought Wilder would be perfect in the role of Leo Bloom. Brooks elicited a promise from Wilder that he would check with him before making any long-term commitments. Months went by, and Wilder toured the country with different theatre productions, participated in a televised CBS presentation of Death of a Salesman, and was cast for his first role in a film—a minor role in Arthur Penn's 1967 Bonnie and Clyde. After three years of not <b>hearing</b> <b>from</b> Brooks, Wilder was called for a reading with Zero Mostel, who was to be the star of Springtime for Hitler and had approval of his co-star. Mostel approved, and Wilder was cast for his first leading role in a feature film, 1968's The Producers.|$|E

5|$|The Decepticons {{learn from}} NSA Chief Galloway that Megatron is buried {{deep in the}} Laurentian Abyss. Starscream {{disables}} the Deep-6 aircraft carriers that guard Megatron's remains in the Laurentian Abyss, allowing the Decepticons {{to gain access to}} Megatron's remains. Megatron is revived, and the Decepticons return to the east coast. Megatron disables Optimus Prime and has Starscream destroy a museum that Sam entered, but he is not among the ruins. They learn he was transported to Cairo, Egypt via a space bridge created by Jetfire. Megatron arrives on the outskirts of Cairo and engages Autobots in combat.

Victorious, he begins plans to form an army of new Decepticons.|$|E
5|$|Zack {{had only}} a small role in the {{original}} Final Fantasy VII. He is first mentioned by name in Gongaga, his hometown, where his parents are oblivious as to what became of him after he left to join SOLDIER, and are worried for his safety after not <b>hearing</b> <b>from</b> him for years. It {{is at this point}} that Aerith explains Zack was her first love. Cloud later realizes that some of his memories and even aspects of his personality were actually Zack's, and not his own. Flashbacks reveal that both Zack and Cloud battled Sephiroth after he burned the town of Nibelheim upon discovering he {{was the result of a}} scientific experiment. After Cloud defeated Sephiroth, both Zack and Cloud were taken to be used in experiments by Shinra. Eventually, Zack woke up and was able to escape with a semi-conscious Cloud to the city Midgar, but on the edge of the city, he was gunned down by Shinra troops. While Zack's and Cloud's flashback escape is optional in the North American and European releases of Final Fantasy VII and the Japanese International version, it was originally planned to be shown once Cloud discovered the results of Shinra's experiments.|$|E
5|$|In 1097, the Crusader armies {{assembled}} at Constantinople having {{traveled in}} groups eastward through Europe. Alexios I, who had requested only some western knights {{to serve as}} mercenaries to help fight the Seljuk Turks, blockaded these armies {{in the city and}} would not permit them to leave until their leaders swore oaths promising to restore to the Empire any land formerly belonging to it that they might conquer on the way to Jerusalem. The Crusaders eventually swore these oaths, individually rather than as a group. In return, Alexios gave them guides and a military escort. The Crusaders were however exasperated by Byzantine tactics, such as negotiating the surrender of Nicaea from the Seljuks while it was still under siege by the Crusaders, who hoped to plunder it to help finance their journey. The Crusaders, feeling betrayed by Alexios, who was able to recover a number of important cities and islands, and in fact much of western Asia Minor, continued on their way without Byzantine aid. In 1098, when Antioch had been captured after a long siege and the Crusaders were in turn themselves besieged in the city, Alexios marched out to meet them, but, <b>hearing</b> <b>from</b> Stephen of Blois that the situation was hopeless, he returned to Constantinople. The Crusaders, who had unexpectedly withstood the siege, believed Alexios had abandoned them and considered the Byzantines completely untrustworthy. Therefore, they regarded their oaths as invalidated.|$|E

5|$|The {{novel is}} set in the American South in the 1930s, during the time of Prohibition and Jim Crow laws that legalized racial {{segregation}} in the South. It begins with the journey of Lena Grove, a young pregnant white woman from Doane's Mill, Alabama, who is trying to find Lucas Burch, the father of her unborn child. He has been fired from his job at Doane's Mill and moved to Mississippi, promising to send word to her when he has a new job. Not <b>hearing</b> <b>from</b> Burch and harassed by her older brother for her illegitimate pregnancy, Lena walks and hitchhikes to Jefferson, Mississippi, a town in Faulkner's fictional Yoknapatawpha County. There she expects to find Lucas working at another planing mill, ready to marry her. Those who help her along her four-week trek are skeptical that Lucas Burch will be found, or that he will keep his promise when she catches up with him. When she arrives in Jefferson, Lucas is there, but he has changed his name to Joe Brown. Looking for Lucas, sweet, trusting Lena meets shy, mild-mannered Byron Bunch, who falls in love with Lena but feels honor-bound to help her find Joe Brown. Thoughtful and quietly religious, Byron is superior to Brown in every way but his shyness prevents him from revealing his feelings to Lena.|$|E
