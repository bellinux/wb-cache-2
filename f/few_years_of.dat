However, provided that they do choose dual VET, higher performers accumulate more <b>years</b> <b>of</b> training.|$|R

50|$|Women with <b>fewer</b> than 12 <b>years</b> <b>of</b> {{education}} {{are at high}} risk of underutilizing or lacking access to adequate prenatal care services. Oftentimes, Black and Hispanic pregnant women have <b>fewer</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> formal education, which sparks a domino effect of consequences related to prenatal care. A lack of formal education results in less knowledge about pregnancy appropriate prenatal healthcare as a whole, fewer job opportunities, and a lower level of income throughout their adult life.|$|R

5|$|The {{concept of}} {{evolution}} was widely accepted in scientific circles within a <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> {{the publication of}} Origin, but the acceptance of natural selection as its driving mechanism was much less widespread. The four major alternatives to natural selection in the late 19th century were theistic evolution, neo-Lamarckism, orthogenesis, and saltationism. Alternatives supported by biologists at other times included structuralism, Georges Cuvier's teleological but non-evolutionary functionalism, and vitalism.|$|E
5|$|The rise {{to power}} of the Bolsheviks marked the turning point for the {{newspaper}} however, as the new government enacted increasingly repressive measures against the publication of dissident literature and against anarchist agitation in general, and after a <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> low-profile publishing, the Golos Truda collective was finally expunged by the Stalinist regime in 1929.|$|E
5|$|A {{minority}} of Vietnamese are also {{followers of the}} Cao Đài faith which was introduced in 1927. The Cao Đài faith attracted both Vietnamese and Cambodian adherents within the first <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> its founding, but a royal decree which outlawed the religion and efforts by Cambodian nationalists to prosecute Khmer adherents led to Cao Dai being observed solely by Vietnamese from the 1930s onwards. A Cao Đài temple was built in Mao Tse Tung Boulevard in 1937, and in the 1960s there were about 70,000 adherents in Cambodia. Cao Đài was outlawed during the Khmer Republic and Khmer Rouge regimes, but regained official recognition in 1985 and has about 2,000 adherents in 2000.|$|E

5|$|After a <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> {{unsteady}} peace, in 1648 the Second English Civil War broke out, {{this time}} with Charles' Royalist supporters joined by Scottish forces. The Parliamentary navy was based in the Downs, protected by the nearby Henrician castles, but by May a Royalist insurrection was underway across Kent. Sandown Castle declared for the King, and the soldier and former naval captain Major Keme then convinced the garrisons at Deal and Walmer to surrender. Sandgate Castle probably joined the Royalists as well. With both the coastal fortresses and the navy now under Royalist control, Parliament feared that foreign forces might be landed along the coast, or military aid sent to the Scots.|$|E
5|$|After {{teaching}} at the University of Washington from 1910 to 1912, Morgan completed a Ph.D. in chemistry at the University of Chicago in 1914. Stieglitz supervised her dissertation. She {{may have been the}} only married woman to have received a Ph.D. in chemistry in the first <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> the 20th century. Despite the fact that married women were not generally welcome on university faculties (female professors were usually expected to resign when they married), Stieglitz agreed to write a recommendation letter for Morgan for a position at the University of Illinois. Stieglitz noted in his letter that the university should overlook Morgan's marital status because her husband was ill at the time.|$|E

Shortly after {{the departure}} of the Mayflower, Governor Carver suddenly died. William Bradford was elected to replace him and went on to lead the colony through much of its formative years.|$|E
40|$|This paper discuses the {{influence}} of librarians 2 ̆ 7 <b>years</b> <b>of</b> working experience and sources of acquisition of ICTs 2 ̆ 7 knowledge and skills. The study is based on 169 librarians working in thirteen university libraries in the universities of six states located in the South-South zone of Nigeria. The purpose of the paper {{is to find out}} if <b>years</b> <b>of</b> working experience has an effect on librarians 2 ̆ 7 sources/means of acquisition of ICT knowledge and skills. The questionnaires used were answered by two categories of librarians. Those with longer <b>years</b> <b>of</b> experience – 16 years and above and those with <b>fewer</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> working experience. It was concluded that librarians with <b>fewer</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> working experience explore means of acquiring ICTs knowledge and skills more than librarians with more <b>years</b> <b>of</b> working experience. It was recommended that librarians with longer <b>years</b> <b>of</b> working experience develop more interest in sources through which they can acquire ICT knowledge and skills...|$|R

5|$|Born into {{a wealthy}} Georgia family, Chivers became {{interested}} in poetry at a young age. After he and his first wife separated, he received a medical degree from Transylvania University but focused his energy on publishing rather than medicine. In addition to submitting poems to various magazines and journals, Chivers published several volumes of poetry, including The Lost Pleiad in 1845, as well as plays. Edgar Allan Poe showed {{an interest in the}} young poet and encouraged his work. Chivers spent the last <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> his life defending the reputation of Poe, who had died in 1849, though he also thought Poe had been heavily influenced by his own poetry.

40|$|This study {{examined}} caregiver {{criminal and civil}} court outcomes 26 years following treatment for serious and violent juvenile offenders who participated in either a family-based treatment (multisystemic therapy, MST) or individual therapy (IT). Results showed that for caregivers in the MST condition, the rates of arrests for felonies and misdemeanors, respectively, were 97 % and 66 % lower than for caregivers in the IT condition. In addition, caregivers in the MST condition were sentenced to 70 % <b>fewer</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> incarceration and 98 % <b>fewer</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> probation. Furthermore, caregivers in the MST condition were 52 % {{less likely to be}} involved in a civil suit reflecting family instability.

His rival John MacBride had been executed {{for his role in}} the 1916 Easter Rising, so Yeats hoped that his widow might remarry. His final proposal to Maud Gonne took place in mid-1916. Gonne's history of revolutionary political activism, as well as a series of personal catastrophes in the previous <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> her life—including chloroform addiction and her troubled marriage to MacBride—made her a potentially unsuitable wife and biographer R.F.
