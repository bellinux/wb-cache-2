These mechanisms are: the effect of corona discharge on the electric field strength at the surface, the influx of fog into the cleared volume by turbulent diffusion, and the increase in supersaturation as liquid water is removed, activating haze particles, and thus generating more fog.

40|$|A new brute-force {{method of}} warm <b>fog</b> <b>dispersal</b> is described. The method uses large volume {{recycled}} water sprays to create curtains of falling drops {{through which the}} fog is processed by the ambient wind and spray induced air flow. Fog droplets are removed by coalescence/rainout. The efficiency of the technique depends upon the drop size spectra in the spray, the height to which the spray can be projected, the efficiency with which fog laden air is processed through the curtain of spray, and {{the rate at which}} new fog may be formed due to temperature differences between the air and spray water. Results of a field test program, implemented to develop the data base necessary to assess the proposed method, are presented. Analytical calculations based upon the field test results indicate that this proposed method of warm <b>fog</b> <b>dispersal</b> is feasible. Even more convincingly, the technique was successfully demonstrated in the one natural fog event which occurred during the test program. Energy requirements for this technique are an order of magnitude less than those to operate a thermokinetic system.

As coun- tries asked for an improvement in CBRNE [1] defense, many national and international efforts {{have been put in}} place to face new risks related to terrorism. In particular, as a major complication, the traditional RDDs based on radioactive isotopes of cesium and cobalt recently evolved towards more sophisticated devices based on transuranics, [2]. As a matter of fact, transuranic RDDs are not so easily detectable as the traditional ones by means of gamma spectrometry, due to complexity of their photon spectra and low photon emission rates. Since September 2013, ENEA, the Italian National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic Development, was involved in the EDEN (End-user DEmo for cbrNe) Demonstration Project within the European framework [3], whose primary target has been to face the CBRNE risks in EU Member States through research, technologi- cal development of new tools, and related experimental demonstrations. At ENEA Casaccia Research Center, the Nuclear Material Characteri- zation and Radioactive Waste Management Laboratory is proposing the Neutron Active Interrogation system (NAI) as a convenient technical solution to find transuranic-based RDDs hidden inside suspected pack- ages.
