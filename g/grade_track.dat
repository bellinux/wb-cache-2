50|$|The stadium {{was built}} in 1971 between C.E. King Middle school and C.E. King high school. In 1999, voters in Sheldon ISD passed a $97 million bond which {{included}} plans for new restrooms, ticket booths, and concession stands. In 2004 the stadium renovations were completed, resulting in improved access for handicapped persons. The bleachers kept the original -beam design, but the metallic stands were replaced with concrete ones which allowed for less restrictive seating space.In 2010, the stadium was once again updated to include professional <b>grade</b> <b>track</b> and field materials. The track was widened to 8 tracks and the surface was replaced with a 13mm thick synthetic surface composed of the Conipur SW system from BASF. In addition, the field grass was replaced with Desso D-Vision artificial turf. The home side bleachers also upgraded to include 22 inch wide theatre seats. The theatre seats are reserved for football season ticket buyers, those who make a one-time lifetime payment, and those who pay an extra fee at admission. The scoreboard was also upgraded to include a video board with action replay ability.|$|E
5000|$|In {{conjunction}} with major ongoing upgrades and expansions {{being made to}} the Port of Oakland {{in order to better}} accommodate the rapidly growing North American trade with Asia and the Pacific, the cooperation of UP, the Port's principal rail partner, has been sought to [...] "construct a second track and raise tunnel clearances over Donner Pass for container trains linking California {{with the rest of the}} country." [...] This would likely require either a new parallel tunnel next to Tunnel 41 or the replacement of the summit section of Track 1 between the Norden complex and Shed 47; either would increase capacity and effectively eliminate delays currently caused by having to run all east and west bound traffic between Norden and Shed 47 over a single track. (To fully eliminate bottleneck delays the now single track 7.1 mi section between Switch 9 (MP 171.9) at Emigrant Gap and Shed 10 (MP 179.0) west of Cisco would likely also have to be restored to double track.) Improvements were completed on the Sierra grade in November 2009, including increasing 18,000 lineal feet of tunnel clearances in 15 restricted tunnels between Rocklin and Truckee and upgrading 30 miles of signals to CTC, although the original Donner Pass <b>grade</b> (<b>Track</b> 1) was not restored. Since then trains of full-height (20 ft 2 inch) double-stack container cars have run over Donner Pass; some tunnels on Track 2 between Bowman and Colfax were not enlarged, so stack trains in both directions must use the older, tunnel-free Track 1 between those points.|$|E
40|$|Being {{involved}} in bullying episodes {{can provide a}} threat for healthy youth development. Studies find that being victimized results in a multitude of psychomatic problems, such as depression (Slee, 1995). Being a bully can result in some serious health-related consequences as well. Bullies are shown to be as vulnerable to feelings of depression as victims (Slee, 1995). Moreover, bullies have a poorer psychosocial functioning than others (Haynie et al., 2001), resolving conflicts mostly by aggression (Bosworth, Espelage, & Simon, 1999). Bully/victims - a third group {{of students who are}} both bully and victim - are considered to be an especially high-risk group (Haynie et al., 2001), being most likely to be confronted with depression, problem behavior, and poor social and emotional adjustment (Haynie et al., 2001). While such psychosomatic and emotional consequences of taking part in bullying episodes have been adequately investigated in previous research, studies on the social outcomes have been scarcer (Demaray & Malecki, 2003). Research on these social outcomes has focused mostly on peer relations (Hodges & Perry, 1999; Demanet, 2008; Rodkin & Hodges, 2003), parental relations (Stevens, De Bourdeaudhuij, & Van Oost, 2002), or school belonging and alienation of students {{involved in}} bullying episodes (Kochenderfer & Ladd, 1996). However, these studies do not investigate a comprehensive set of outcomes, investigating peers, parents, and schools simultaneously (for a notable exception, see Demaray and Malecki, 2003). Moreover, relationships of bullies, victims, and bully/victims with teachers are underexposed in previous research. In the proposed study, we investigate whether non-involved students, bullies, victims, and bully/victims hold different relations with peers, teachers, parents, and the school. We consider an elaborate set of outcomes, namely the number of friendships students have, feelings of attachment they have with peers and parents, the support they receive from teachers, and their belonging to school. Our study extends this line of research by focusing on an extensive dataset of 11, 872 students in 85 schools, representative for the Flemish situation (Flanders is the northern, Dutch-speaking part of Belgium), whereas previous research mainly focused on data in one school (Demaray and Malecki, 2003). Furthermore, this study adds to the growing literature on bully/victims, a group of students that has largely been neglected in the past (Veenstra et al., 2005), but is increasingly recognized as an important group to focus on in relation to health-related outcomes (Demaray & Malecki, 2003; Veenstra et al., 2005). Lastly, research on bullying behaviour has mainly focused on univariate analyses (Veenstra et al., 2005), which possibly does not account for covariates or intermediate relationships. We account for this by taking account of possible covariates of bully status, such as gender, <b>grade,</b> <b>track</b> attended, and SES. While focusing on the Flemish situation, our study is valuable for international audiences, being the only study to date to cover this question on such an extensive data set and elaborate set of outcomes. Hence, this study can provide directions for research in other European and non-European countries. Methodology or Methods: The data were part of the Flemish Educational Assessment (FlEA), gathered in the 2004 – 2005 school year in 85 Flemish secondary schools. We have data on 11, 872 students, and the data set is representative for the Flemish situation. We determined whether there are significant differences between the non-involved, bullies, victims, and bully/victims with respect to their number of friendships, social standing, peer and parental attachment, perceived teacher support, and general school belonging. To do so, we performed one-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) with the bonding measures as dependent variables. To investigate whether the differences between the bullying groups are not due to covariates, we controlled additionally for a number of variables, namely gender, <b>grade,</b> <b>track</b> attended, and socio-economic status. Subsequently, we performed post-hoc tests on the controlled means of the bullying groups to examine the between-group differences in more detail. For this, we used the Bonferonni procedure, as this reduces Type I-errors and keeps the overall p value to. 05. Conclusions, Expected Outcomes or Findings Our results show that there are indeed important differences between the different groups of students on the bonding measures. Those not involved in bullying situations, either as a bully, victim, or bully/victim, feel most closely connected to their peers, their teachers, their parents, and the school environment. However, they are surpassed by bullies with regard to their number of friendships and social standing within the school, which shows that bullying is an acceptable strategy for many students. Bullies, furthermore, are overall better off than victims and bully/victims, with regard to their teacher support, parental attachment, and school belonging. Victims, then, score on every indicator of social attachment lower than bullies, being especially deprived of peer popularity. However, in comparison to the non-involved, bullies, and victims, bully/victims have the lowest overall attachment to significant others, feeling least attached to their peers and parents, perceiving to receive least teacher support, and feeling least at home at school. However, they do not differ from any of the other groups with regard to peer popularity. References: Bosworth, K., Espelage, D. L., & Simon, T. R. (1999).
