25|$|The Drillers {{came out}} of the gate smoking, {{rattling}} off five straight wins right out of the gate. As a team that had always prided itself on playing defense first, now had also developed a potent offense rolling three full lines. Particularly of notice in this newfound offensive stroke was the play of Nikola Vignjevic. A phenomenally gifted player, his performance in the first season (with the Drillers) was often <b>hit</b> <b>and</b> <b>miss,</b> but come his second season his play was inspired and gave the Drillers the playmaker they long needed up front. Another player that drastically stepped up his game for the 99/00 season was Vignjevic's line mate Rick Titus, always a tenacious defender, he too became a force in the offensive end to the surprise of many.|$|E
500|$|This {{episode was}} {{generally}} well received by critics. Abby West of Entertainment Weekly stated that [...] "one {{of the many}} things I love about the show is how current it is. I love the pop-culture references, like Losts Dharma Initiative, Deal or No Deal, and that soon-to-be classic SNL/Chronicles of Narnia sketch. IGN's Brian Zoromski said that although the episode had [...] "a few <b>hit</b> <b>and</b> <b>miss</b> moments", it [...] "was a very well done episode that carried through on three main storylines" [...] and [...] "began and ended beautifully". Aaron from eTV Review said that even if it [...] "wasn’t as good as last week’s episode", it was still [...] "another great one".

2500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mixed reviews from television critics. Erich Asperschlager of TV Verdict wrote: [...] "It’s {{no secret that}} The Simpsons isn’t {{what it used to}} be. The past few seasons have been hit or miss, but once in a while an episode comes along that reminds me why I’ve kept watching. 'Lisa the Drama Queen' is one of those episodes." [...] Robert Canning of IGN commented: [...] "It's been argued that Lisa episodes of The Simpsons are basically <b>hit</b> <b>and</b> <b>miss.</b> In my opinion, the boring, unfunny Lisa episodes far outweigh the classic Lisa episodes. 'Lisa the Drama Queen' was one of those episodes that fell into the boring majority. There were a number of reasons for this— too many song montages, for one— but ultimately it boiled down to the uninspired storyline. Worst episode of the Simpsons ever." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2003 Richardson began filming on {{his return}} to the big screen, {{directing}} Christian Slater and Neve Campbell in , which was released in December 2004. The film was a return to the universe of Comic Strip films The Strike and GLC, where Hollywood remakes and distorts events from British historical events and portrayed Winston Churchill as a gun toting U.S. G.I. similar to Bruce Willis. [...] Phillip French writing in the Observer called it [...] "a <b>hit</b> <b>and</b> <b>miss</b> affair" [...] Peter Bradshaw in the Guardian gave it three stars and said [...] "It's wildly uneven and very broad, but there are some laughs in Peter Richardson's Comic Strip fantasy of Churchill's real life as a kickass action hero." [...] However Nev Peirce on the BBC's website panned the film, saying [...] "Sadly, Peter Richardson suffers the fate of many satirists; in trying to mock bad films, he's simply made a bad film" [...] The film grossed £148,326 on its opening weekend across 170 screens in the UK ...|$|E
2500|$|Game Informer {{gave the}} game {{a score of}} 8 of 10, praising some of its new {{features}} like the Super Easy mode, but criticizing the soundtrack as <b>hit</b> <b>and</b> <b>miss,</b> and a bit repetitive if the player {{does not have any}} downloaded songs. Jack DeVries of IGN gave the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions a 7.0/10, calling the presentation [...] "adorable" [...] and [...] "just so damn cute", but still thinks of this game as [...] "half a game for the full price" [...] mainly because of the reduced soundtrack. The Wii version fared less well, receiving a 5.5/10, due to [...] "terrible looks" [...] and [...] "hard to read text." [...] In contrast, the DS version scored an impressive 8.4 from IGN's Craig Harris, who praised it as feeling fresh and new compared to the console versions. GameTrailers gave the game 7.9 criticising the lack of previous features such as online play, and called the Lego presentation superficial, saying the purchase decision will lie squarely on the song preferences. The game has sold approximately 600,000 units by March 2010.|$|E

2500|$|The batting captain {{is allowed}} seven minutes of rolling before his innings and Freddie Brown {{asked for the}} heavy roller to press down the wicket and {{take some of the}} demons out of it. In those days the Woolloongabba still used an old heavy roller drawn by a horse called Dobbin. As it had to be unhitched and led round after each pull of the roller over the pitch, most of the seven minutes was wasted and Brown didn't get much of the rolling he asked for. This was of great {{importance}} as if he had insisted on seven minutes actual rolling instead of messing about at either end the wicket would have been much less dangerous and England would have had less time to bat out before stumps. Though as Bill O'Reilly pointed out the time limits were devised when horse-drawn rollers were the norm and mechanical rollers were unheard of. Initially it made no difference as Reg Simpson was bowled first ball by a full toss from Ray Lindwall (2/21). The veteran England scorer Bill Ferguson was using his famous Ferguson Charts to record the details of each innings; how many runs a batsman had scored, how many balls, how many minutes, how many boundaries, etc. when Simpson was out one wag called out [...] "How long Bill, and how many fours?" [...] which produced a roar of laughter from the press box that astonished the crowd. Cyril Washbrook (6) and John Dewes (9) were determined to see out the day with dead bats and the wicket showed no signs of danger, but Sam Loxton took a superb catch {{to get rid of the}} Lancastrian off Lindwall. Jack Iverson was called up to bowl his first Test over 27 minutes before stumps and had Trevor Bailey in all kinds of trouble as his poked and prodded and could have been out five or six times in the mystery spinner's maiden over. Dewes was bowled by Keith Miller and with one over from Iverson remaining, Alec Bedser came out and immediately appealed against the bad light, but was turned down as he had yet to face a ball. He holed out to Neil Harvey off Iverson, Bailey gave a simple catch to Bill Johnston and Godfrey Evans ran out his fellow wicket-keeper Arthur McIntyre when he called for an unnecessary third run. Brown had fed in nightwatchman after nightwatchman in order to save Hutton, Compton and himself for the next day, but the Man from Pudsey still had to come out at 30/6 to survive the last two balls of an extraordinary day. When asked for his opinion that night Hutton said they might win [...] "if the others will stay till lunch and it doesn't rain again". It didn't rain again, but needing 163 to win with only four wickets in hand there was no room for mistakes. In the morning Brown, the umpires and a stopwatch ensured that England got their full 10 minutes rolling at the start of the day, which took nearly half an hour to complete. Evans (5) helped Hutton add 16 runs before he was caught by Loxton off Bill Johnston (2/30). Denis Compton came to the crease, but lasted one ball as he departed like Evans [...] "c Loxton, b Johnston". Brown came in at number 10 and held on grimly as Hutton peeled off 3 boundaries, though in the end the captain made 17 of their 29 runs together before he became Loxton's fourth victim when he was caught off Iverson (4/43). Doug Wright was the last man in at 77/9 and his batting tended to be a <b>hit</b> <b>and</b> <b>miss</b> affair which rarely reached double figures. Hutton (62 not out) farmed the bowling ruthlessly, making 43 of the 45 runs added for the last wicket. Wright managed to hold a straight bat up to the few balls he was left to face until the last four balls from Iverson before lunch. He kept out the first three, but spooned the last to Ray Lindwall at square leg and the match was over. The 12,000 strong crowd gave Hutton an heroic ovation and after lunch he replied to the congratulations showered on him with by admitting that [...] "with a bit of luck I'd have won the game".|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Modern {{application}} specific system-on-chip plat-forms allow customization of caches. Such flexibility {{enables the}} designers {{to identify the}} suitable cache configurations through design space exploration of caches. Trace-driven simulation is widely used to obtain the cache <b>hits</b> <b>and</b> <b>misses</b> for design space exploration. However, simulation is normally slow. Meanwhile, as the embedded system moves toward cache hierarchies with multi-level caches, such expanded design space leads to extremely long simulation time. In this paper, we propose a rapid design space exploration technique for two-level unified caches. Given the application trace, our technique determines the cache <b>hits</b> <b>and</b> <b>misses</b> for multiple cache configurations in a single pass. Our exploration technique adopts a novel LRU linked list data structure, lookup tables, and search algorithms to effectively improve the exploration time. Experimental results indicate that our analysis is 7 – 239 X times faster compared to the fastest known design space exploration technique, in estimating cache <b>hits</b> <b>and</b> <b>misses</b> for popular embedded benchmarks.

We present an algorithm to compute the {{sensitivity of}} a replacement policy. We have implemented this algorithm in a tool called RELACS that can handle a large class of replacement policies including LRU, FIFO, PLRU, and MRU. Sensitivity properties obtained with RELACS demonstrate that the execution history can have a strong impact on the number of cache <b>hits</b> <b>and</b> <b>misses</b> if FIFO, PLRU, or MRU is used.
