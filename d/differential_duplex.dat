40|$|The terbenzimidazoles are a {{class of}} {{synthetic}} ligands that poison the human topoisomerase I (TOP 1) enzyme and promote cancer cell death. It has been proposed that drugs of this class act as TOP 1 poisons by binding to the minor groove of the DNA substrate of TOP 1 and altering its structure {{in a manner that}} results in enzyme-mediated DNA cleavage. To test this hypothesis, we characterize and compare the binding properties of a 5 -phenylterbenzimidazole derivative (5 PTB) to the d(GA 4 T 4 C) 2 and d(GT 4 A 4 C) 2 duplexes. The d(GA 4 T 4 C) 2 duplex contains an uninterrupted 8 -bp A⋅T domain, which, on the basis of x-ray crystallographic data, should induce a highly hydrated “A-tract” conformation. This duplex also exhibits anomalously slow migration in a polyacrylamide gel, a feature characteristic of a noncanonical global conformational state frequently described as “bent. ” By contrast, the d(GT 4 A 4 C) 2 duplex contains two 4 -bp A⋅T tracts separated by a TpA dinucleotide step, which should induce a less hydrated “B-like” conformation. This duplex also migrates normally in a polyacrylamide gel, a feature further characteristic of a global, canonical B-form duplex. Our data reveal that, at 20 °C, 5 PTB exhibits an ≈ 2. 3 kcal/mol greater affinity for the d(GA 4 T 4 C) 2 duplex than for the d(GT 4 A 4 C) 2 duplex. Significantly, we find this sequence/conformational binding specificity of 5 PTB to be entropic in origin, an observation consistent with a greater degree of drug binding-induced dehydration of the more solvated d(GA 4 T 4 C) 2 duplex. By contrast with the <b>differential</b> <b>duplex</b> affinity exhibited by 5 PTB, netropsin and 4 ′, 6 -diamidino- 2 -phenylindole (DAPI), two AT-specific minor groove binding ligands that are inactive as human TOP 1 poisons, bind to both duplexes with similar affinities. The electrophoretic behaviors of the ligand-free and ligand-bound duplexes are consistent with 5 PTB-induced bending and/or unwinding of both duplexes, which, for the d(GA 4 T 4 C) 2 duplex, is synergistic with the endogenous sequence-directed electrophoretic properties of the ligand-free duplex state. By contrast, the binding to either duplex of netropsin or DAPI induces little or no change in the electrophoretic mobilities of the duplexes. Our results demonstrate that the TOP 1 poison 5 PTB binds differentially to and alters the structures of the two duplexes, in contrast to netropsin and DAPI, which bind with similar affinities to the two duplexes and do not significantly alter their structures. These results are consistent with a mechanism for TOP 1 poisoning in which drugs such as 5 PTB differentially target conformationally distinct DNA sites and induce structural changes that promote enzyme-mediated DNA cleavage...|$|E
50|$|Fibre channel {{electrical}} {{signals are}} sent over a <b>duplex</b> <b>differential</b> interface. This usually consists of twisted-pair cables with a nominal impedance of 75 ohms (single-ended) or 150 ohms (differential). This {{is a genuine}} differential signalling system so no ground reference is carried through the cable, except for the shield. Signalling is AC-coupled, with the series capacitors located at the transmitter end of the link.|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} component of protein–DNA recognition is the charge neutralization of DNA backbone phosphates and subsequent protein-induced DNA bending. Replacement of phosphates by neutral methylphosphonates has previously {{been shown to be}} a model for protein-induced bending. In addition to bending, the neutralization process may change the inherent flexibility of the DNA—a feature never before tested. We have developed a method to measure the <b>differential</b> flexibility of <b>duplex</b> DNA when methylphosphonate substitutions are made and find that the local flexibility is increased up to 40 %. These results imply that backbone-neutralization-dependent DNA flexibility augments DNA-binding motifs in protein–DNA recognition processes...|$|R
40|$|High-throughput DNA sensors {{capable of}} {{detecting}} single-base mismatches {{are required for}} the routine screening of genetic mutations and disease. A new strategy for the electrochemical detection of single-base mismatches in DNA has been developed based upon charge transport through DNA films. Double-helical DNA films on gold surfaces have been prepared and used to detect DNA mismatches electrochemically. The signals obtained from redox-active intercalators bound to DNA-modified gold surfaces display a marked sensitivity {{to the presence of}} base mismatches within the immobilized <b>duplexes.</b> <b>Differential</b> mismatch detection was accomplished irrespective of DNA sequence composition and mismatch identity. Single-base changes in sequences hybridized at the electrode surface are also detected accurately. Coupling the redox reactions of intercalated species to electrocatalytic processes in solution considerably increases the sensitivity of this assay. Reporting on the electronic structure of DNA, as opposed to the hybridization energetics of single-stranded oligonucleotides, electrochemical sensors based on charge transport may offer fundamental advantages in both scope and sensitivity...|$|R
