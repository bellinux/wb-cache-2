5|$|As older {{problems}} are solved, more complexities are being introduced, like adding additional parts to an engine. Interaction {{of these new}} parts, or niches, create emergent properties, like time-saving office devices (e.g. email, mobile computers, etc.) make communication more efficient but also expand the network of contacts and {{increase the amount of}} time spent on such duties. Homer-Dixon relates this to complexity theory explaining that as new niches are filled there is a synergistic burst of simplicity. However, this can also lead to less control or freedom as emergent properties are created, like a new <b>government</b> <b>program</b> leading to a sprawling bureaucracy. Information theory is touched upon relating the amount of information required to describe a system and the degree of that system's complexity. Chaos theory is used to describe how small changes can lead to widely varying results and path dependence.|$|E
5|$|Several {{government}} buildings in Alamogordo were {{constructed by the}} Works Progress Administration, a <b>government</b> <b>program</b> created in 1935 {{in response to the}} Great Depression. These include the Otero County Administration Building at 1101 New York Avenue, a Pueblo style building originally constructed as the main U.S. Post Office in 1938. The building is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The main entrance portico features frescoes by Peter Hurd completed in 1942. The Post Office moved out in 1961, and the building was used by a succession of Federal agencies and was known as the Federal Building. The last Federal agency to occupy it was the United States Forest Service who used it as the headquarters of the Lincoln National Forest until October 2008, when that agency moved to a newly constructed building.|$|E

40|$|One common {{view is that}} a {{majority}} of <b>government</b> <b>programs</b> persist beyond their useful lifespans giving the impression that once installed, <b>government</b> <b>programs</b> are ‘immortal’. However, termination of <b>government</b> <b>programs</b> is an essential element in the policy making process. Several factors determine the projected lifespan of a program, and a program may be effectively terminated using several mechanisms. An analysis of the Recovery Audit Contracting program, a program designed to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse in the Medicare and Medicaid systems, shows that watchdog programs are inherently more prone to termination than other types of <b>government</b> <b>programs.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{election}} bulletins and <b>government</b> <b>programs</b> of the Justice Party, Motherland Party and Justice and Development Party {{who formed}} governments alone between {{the years of}} 1961 - 2012, are investigated {{in the context of}} pledges about forests and forestry. For this purpose, especially Grand National Assembly of Turkey’s archive, election brochures and websites are used in the study. As a result of the study, it is seen that Justice Party represented the pledges in the election bulletins into the <b>government</b> <b>programs</b> with partial changes, Motherland Party represented the pledges in the election bulletins into the <b>government</b> <b>programs</b> exactly and Justice and Development Party mentioned about forests as natural resources in the election bulletins by not entering into details, as detailed aims were stated in the Government Action Plans. In conclusion, there is coherence between election bulletins and <b>government</b> <b>programs</b> of these three Parties. Therefore, it is important to create awareness about forests in every segment of society from electors to politicians in order to avoid adverse effects of promises in suchlike election bulletins and <b>government</b> <b>programs</b> on forest...|$|R

Legislation was passed to allow the state to participate in Social Security and worker's unemployment programs. Additionally, he was most active in pursuing federal jobs and created the administrative framework necessary for Indiana {{to participate in the}} Works Progress Administration programs. More than 75,000 Hoosiers were working in the <b>government</b> <b>program</b> before he left office.

25|$|Romney’s initial {{emergency}} {{budget proposal}} {{for fiscal year}} 2003 called for $343 million in immediate funding cuts, necessitating layoffs of state employees and cuts in aid to cities and towns for public safety and education. He explained in a televised address, “There's no time to restructure state government or remake state programs. On such an emergency timetable, there's just time for cuts.” He also proposed cuts in state expenditures for Medicaid, the <b>government</b> <b>program</b> providing {{health care for the}} poorest state residents. The cuts included caps in payments to medical providers (one example being through limiting payments for hospital stays to 20 days, no matter how sick the patient), increased stringency of the criteria for Medicaid eligibility, and rationing of access to higher-priced medications for Medicaid patients. Some 36,000 Massachusetts residents lost their Medicaid eligibility. The 2003 emergency budget revision proposal also included funding cuts affecting public colleges and universities, treatment for schizophrenic and other mentally ill patients, and various other social services.|$|E
