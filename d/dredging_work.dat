5|$|Water {{quality in}} the river can be {{affected}} by <b>dredging</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Environment Agency is {{responsible}} for monitoring water quality on the river and its tributaries, which have been divided into seventeen separate water bodies. In 2013, seven water bodies were assessed as having good quality and ten as being moderate. The reasons for not achieving good status included pollution from waste water, pollution from agriculture and physical modifications. The physical modifications include <b>dredging</b> <b>work</b> on the lower reaches, near the junction with the Parrett to increase the channel flow to reduce flooding. The use and storage of the dredged material in bank restoration may also have an impact. In 1998 improvements were sought to treatment works and surface water outfalls to improve water quality. A vegetable washing plant on the Chelston stream at Wellington was also identified {{as a source of}} pollution. The waters of the Upper Tone have been classified as having good ecological status, whereas the section from Wellington to Taunton and downstrean of Taunton are rated as moderate.|$|E
5|$|Downriver of the Hells Canyon is the Lower Snake River Project, {{authorized}} by the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1945, which {{was created by the}} U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to create a navigable channel on the Snake River from its mouth to the beginning of Hells Canyon. These dams are, in downstream order: Lower Granite Lock and Dam, Little Goose Lock and Dam, Lower Monumental Lock and Dam, and Ice Harbor Lock and Dam. <b>Dredging</b> <b>work</b> was also done throughout the length of the navigation channel to facilitate ship passage. These dams form a cascade of reservoirs with no stretches of free-flowing river in between. Immediately below Ice Harbor Dam is Lake Wallula, formed by the construction of the McNary Dam on the Columbia River. (McNary Dam {{is not part of the}} Lower Snake River Project.) Above Lower Granite Dam, the river channel from Lewiston to Johnson Bar, just below Hells Canyon, is also maintained for jet-boats as this section is too rugged for ships. These dams have been proposed for removal, and if they were to be removed, it would be the largest dam removal project ever undertaken in the United States. The removal has been proposed on the grounds that it would restore salmon runs to the lower Snake River and the Clearwater River and other smaller tributaries. Idaho's Snake river once teemed with sockeye salmon. However, there are almost no wild sockeye salmon left in the river due to a number of factors.|$|E

50|$|The main {{improvements}} {{were never}} carried out, however some <b>dredging</b> <b>works</b> were implemented in 1857 near the Den Point following complaints from mariners. In 1865 yet further <b>dredging</b> <b>works</b> were carried out, and a groyne 330 yards long was later built out from abreast of Ferry Point to arrest sand. Spratt also published {{a plan of}} the revolving movements of the sands at the Exmouth Bar.|$|R

The Port Admiral Hotel's original ground floor now forms part of its basement. The last major reclamation was of the Glanville Reserve in 1892.|$|E

By June 1879 the ship had been completely refitted for deep sea sounding and <b>dredging</b> <b>work.</b> Under the command of John Pillsbury from 1884-1889 the ship intensified Gulf Stream work with current measurements using his device, sounding lines from shore to beyond the current, temperatures and biological sampling.|$|E
25|$|The {{construction}} of Fremantle Harbour was probably O'Connor's greatest personal triumph, as {{his proposal to}} build the harbour within {{the entrance to the}} Swan River was contrary to previous expert advice that this was impracticable and that the construction would require constant <b>dredging.</b> <b>Work</b> commenced in 1892 in removing a limestone bar and sand shoals {{at the mouth of the}} Swan River and was successfully completed in 1903. On 4 May 1897 the first ocean-going steamer, the Sultan, berthed at South Quay (renamed Victoria Quay on 26 July 1901 in honour of the late Queen Victoria).

25|$|The creek's {{watershed}} {{was heavily}} urbanized after World War II, altering the runoff and discharge patterns. Increased runoff into Boeing Creek during rainy weather has caused more intense erosion and sediment transport, {{leading to the}} build-up of sediment in Hidden Lake. In the 1970s heavy rains flushed enough sediment down the creek to completely fill Hidden Lake, which became a meadow. Subsequently, King County Surface Water Division began efforts to control stormwater runoff in Boeing Creek's watershed. In 1996 <b>dredging</b> <b>work</b> restored Hidden Lake. On January 1, 1997, a winter storm created a large sinkhole which ruptured sewer lines on 175th Street, resulting in the Hidden Lake being filled with sediment again. The lake was dredged and restored again. The city of Shoreline budgets money for dredging Hidden Lake as needed and continues to seek a long-term solution {{to the problems of}} increased storm surge runoff, erosion, and sedimentation.|$|E
500|$|During {{the winter}} {{flooding}} of 2013–14 on the Somerset Levels, the River Tone overflowed at new year, during {{the rain and}} storms from Storm Dirk, with many residents asking for the Environment Agency to resume river dredging. On 24 January 2014, {{in light of the}} continued flooded extent of the Somerset Moors and forecast new rainfall as part of the winter storms of 2013–14 in the United Kingdom, both Somerset County Council and Sedgemoor District Council declared a major incident, as defined under the Civil Contingencies Act 2004. As a result of the extensive flooding <b>dredging</b> <b>work</b> was carried out.

In May 1940, it was decided that the uncompleted battleship had to be sent to a safer place in Britain or in French Africa, beyond the Luftwaffe's range. The ship was afloat in the fitting-out basin; however, this was separated from the navigational channel by an earth dam. When it appeared that the Battle of France {{was on its way to}} be won by the Wehrmacht by late May, work on dredging the earth dam was begun in order to be ready to leave at a high tide on 20 June. Half the propulsion machinery (boilers and turbines) was fitted to be worked when necessary. On 18 June, as the German Panzer divisions were approaching, the commanding officer was ordered to be ready to leave immediately for Casablanca or to scuttle the ship.

6000|$|On {{the coasts}} of the British Islands, Forbes distinguishes four zones or regions, the Littoral (between tide marks), the Laminarian (between lowwater-mark and 15 fathoms), the Coralline (from 15 to 50 fathoms), and the Deep sea or Coral region (from 50 fathoms to beyond 100 fathoms). But, in the deeper waters of the Aegean Sea, between the shore and a depth of 300 fathoms, Forbes {{was able to make}} out no fewer than eight zones of life, in the course of which the number and variety of forms {{gradually}} diminished until, beyond 300 fathoms, life disappeared altogether. Hence it appeared as if descent in the sea had much the same effect on life, as ascent on land. Recent investigations appear to show that Forbes was right enough in his classification of the facts of distribution in depth as they are to be observed in the Aegean; and though, at the time he wrote, one or two observations were extant which might have warned him not to generalize too extensively from his Aegean experience, his own <b>dredging</b> <b>work</b> was so much more extensive and systematic than that of any other naturalist, that it is not wonderful he should have felt justified in building upon it. Nevertheless, so far as the limit of the range of life in depth goes, Forbes' conclusion has been completely negatived, and the greatest depths yet attained show not even an approach to a [...] "zero of life":-- ...|$|E
