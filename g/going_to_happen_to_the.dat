60|$|CAPTAIN SHOTOVER [yielding]. Take care: I am in my dotage. Old men are dangerous: it doesn't {{matter to}} them what is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> world.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you will}} {{acknowledge}} certain things it will save us all much time, of which at present {{we have little}} to spare. Those things are that knowing what was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> commission, you tried to avoid accompanying it. Is that true?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Bah!" [...] {{interrupted}} the doctor, without stopping {{for an instant}} the idle swinging movement of his legs. [...] "Self-flattery. Food for that vanity which makes the world go round.

60|$|No, he had not. But {{he confessed}} {{that for years}} and years he had been in love with that cabinet. And anyhow what was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> things? The world was greatly {{exercised}} by that problem. He turned slightly his beautifully groomed white head so as to address Mr. Blunt directly.|$|E
60|$|It will need, I think, some careful thought {{thoroughly}} {{to understand}} this text. Our Lord in it calls the Pharisees and Sadducees hypocrites; because, though they could use their common sense and experience to judge of the weather they would not use them to judge of {{the signs of the}} times; of what was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Jewish nation.|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{grandmother}} was a gypsy," [...] he ses, [...] "and it's in the family. Things that are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>'appen</b> <b>to</b> people I know {{come to me}} in dreams, same as pore Bill's did. It's curious to me sometimes when I look round at you chaps, seeing you going about 'appy and comfortable, and knowing all the time 'orrible things that is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>'appen</b> <b>to</b> you. Sometimes it gives me the fair shivers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Between ourselves,' confided Psmith, 'I'm dashed if I know what's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> me. I am the thingummy of what's-its-name.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wonder what}} is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> that gentleman," [...] said Mr. Ormsby, glancing at Endymion, and {{speaking}} to Mr. Cassilis.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] I answered. [...] "I {{knew nothing}} of what was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> commission, though I feared something, having but just saved my friends there"--and I pointed to the Prinsloos--"from death {{at the hands of}} Dingaan. I did not wish to {{accompany}} it for another reason: that I had been married on the day of its starting to Marie Marais. Still, I went after all because the General Retief, who was my friend, asked me to come, to interpret for him." ...|$|E
60|$|Are we just {{drifting}} into {{an unknown}} darkness {{in all these}} matters with blind leaders of our blindness? Or cannot {{a lot of these}} things be figured out by able and intelligent people? I put it to you that they can. That it is a reasonable and proper thing to ask our statesmen and politicians: what is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> world? What sort of better social order are you making for? What sort of world order are you creating? Let them open their minds to us, let them put upon permanent record the significance of all their intrigues and manoeuvres. Then as they go on we can check their capacity and good faith. We can establish a control at last that will rule presidents and kings.|$|E
60|$|But the vulgar comic {{papers are}} so subtle and true {{that they are}} even prophetic. If {{you really want to}} know what is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> future of our democracy, do not read the modern sociological prophecies, do not read even Mr. Wells's Utopias for this purpose, though you should {{certainly}} read them if you are fond of good honesty and good English. If you want to know what will happen, study the pages of Snaps or Patchy Bits as if they were the dark tablets graven with the oracles of the gods. For, mean and gross as they are, in all seriousness, they contain what is entirely absent from all Utopias and all the sociological conjectures of our time: they contain some hint of the actual habits and manifest desires of the English people. If we are really to find out what the democracy will ultimately do with itself, we shall surely find it, not in the literature which studies the people, but in the literature which the people studies.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's a side-issue. The {{main point}} is to put this thing through. Then we can think about what is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> me." ...|$|R

6000|$|The great {{pleasure}} {{of all was}} a grand stag-hunt, got up for the diversion of the French ambassadors, {{who had come to}} treat for the espousals of the infant Princess Mary with the baby [...] "Dolphyne." [...] Probably these illustrious personages did not get half the pleasure out of it that the Antelope party had. Were they not, by special management of a yeoman pricker who had recognised in Stephen a kindred spirit, and had a strong admiration for Mistress Randall, placed where there was the best possible view of hunters, horses, and hounds, lords and ladies, King and ambassadors, in their gorgeous hunting trim? Did not Stephen, as a true verdurer's son, interpret every note on the horn, and predict just what was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> edification of all his hearers? And when the final rush took place, did not the prentices, with their gowns rolled up, dart off headlong in pursuit? Dennet entertained some hope that Stephen would again catch some runaway steed, or come to the King's rescue in some way or other, but such chances did not happen every day. Nay, Stephen did not even follow up the chase to the death, but left Giles to do that, turning back forsooth because that little Jasper thought fit to get tired and out of breath, and could not find his way back alone. Dennet was quite angry with Stephen and turned her back on him, when Giles came in all glorious, at having followed up staunchly all day, having seen the fate of the poor stag, and having even beheld the King politely hand the knife to Monsieur de Montmorency to give the first stroke to the quarry! ...|$|E
6000|$|For {{my third}} {{instance}} I would step from a matter {{as small as}} three market towns and the grazing of a few thousand head of sheep to a matter {{as big as the}} world. What is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> shipping of the world after this war? The Germans, with that combination of cunning and stupidity which baffles the rest of mankind, have set themselves to destroy the mercantile marine not merely of Britain and France but of Norway and Sweden, Holland, and all the neutral countries. The German papers openly boast that they are building up a big mercantile marine that will start out to take up the world's overseas trade directly peace is declared. Every such boast receives careful attention in the British press. We have heard a very great deal about the German will-to-power in this war, but there is something very much older and tougher and less blatant and conspicuous, the British will. In the British papers there has appeared and gained a permanent footing this phrase, [...] "ton for ton." [...] This means that Britain will go on fighting until she has exacted and taken over from Germany the exact equivalent of all the British shipping Germany has submarined. People do not realise that a time may come when Germany will be glad and eager to give Russia, France and Italy all that they require of her, when Great Britain may be quite content to let her allies make an advantageous peace and herself still go on fighting Germany. She does not intend to let that furtively created German mercantile marine ship or coal or exist upon the high seas--so long as it can be used as an economic weapon against her. Neither Britain nor France nor Italy can tolerate anything of the sort.|$|E

50|$|Observing the happenings in the Chola country, {{a genuine}} Poojari(Priest) {{there in the}} temple guessed that {{something}} bad is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> country. He advised the other priests to be genuine, {{but they did not}} listen. So he started performing Velvi (ritual) towards Thirumal. Since he didn't appear before him he ought to destroy himself jumping into the fire of Velvi. So for his rescue, Thirumal appeared before him and the priest told about the unusual activities of the other priests. Thirumal advised them to go to Thiruvananthapuram. He added that it is no more good time for Chola Kingdom and so {{we have to go to}} Thiruvananathapuram. So he advised the priest to be prepared for that.|$|E
5000|$|Gracie and Auney’s {{attempt to}} {{maintain}} Cherokee culture through storytelling roles has {{in a sense}} failed, or caused a gap, in generations because at this point, the Cherokee are so far removed from their original customs that the next generation (or Lucie) cannot identify with the stories. Lucie says on page 58 that she “knew no Indian princesses, no buckskin, no feathers, no tomahawks.” She {{goes on to say}} that she tried to see the women in her life as Indians but that she can’t. Her lack of understanding the stories further complicates her identity as she has no first hand experience with tradition but at the same time is too far gone to get it back. Bell introduces a sense of worry in the text by making the reader question “well what is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> next generation?” ...|$|E

5000|$|Voit Zerbe (Brian Doyle-Murray) {{plays a key}} role, as a {{developer}} who wants to run Jack and Ernest off their property so he can build a massive high-end casino on the beach {{as part of a}} deal he's making with two business partners - one Swiss, the other Arab. To do that, he uses the help of the local prime minister Solomon Gundy (Adolph Caesar) and the prime minister's men to cause trouble and get Club Paradise to close [...] "legally." [...] Jack and Ernest {{go so far as to}} sneak aboard Zerbe's yacht to provide some [...] "useful intelligence" [...] for Governor Hayes by finding out what is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> future of Saint Nicholas. They skin dive to the yacht (not before Jack brings a helium tank instead of an oxygen tank) where they are captured by local police and thrown in jail. When Prime Minister Gundy's strong arm tactics don't work, he orders a military takeover of the island. Ernest builds up a resistance force, and St. Nicholas is soon threatened with the possibility of civil war, which is averted at the last minute with assistance from Jack and Governor Hayes. When Gundy's takeover fails, Zerbe and his partners leave Saint Nicholas and head for the Cayman Islands. Jack is then inspired to create a new tagline for the club: [...] "Club Paradise: Your Hot Spot for Fun With Guns in the Sun." ...|$|E
40|$|As {{this is my}} last {{editorial}} as your editor, I {{thought it}} would be appropriate to range a bit more widely. To wit, what’s <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> system under which we all earn our living? Despite the undeniable fact that most of us feel we’re “doing good, ” there is great dis-content among politicians, journalists, and policy wonks about the functioning {{of the health care system}} in the United States. Even among the general public there is discontent, although paradoxically most (not all!) feel the system works well for them. Actually, this is worldwide. The British worry about the National Health Service, of which they are inordinately proud. Other Europeans are forever tinkering with their national systems. Even the Canadians think their sys-tem is poorly responsive and inadequately funded, bu...|$|E
40|$|Abstract In {{this article}} we analyze two {{different}} perceptions of border inside Europe. On the one hand, we have the perception idealized by the European Union as an international organization, which believes that states benefit more from cooperation and dilution of borders in a common space than from keeping its borders {{as a symbol of}} its sovereignty. On the other hand, we have the European member states, taken individually, with particular interests and goals that, given the threat of illegal immigration, which is currently felt in the large-scale Europe, adopt a realistic perception of the border, and look at each territory as a space that needs protection from external threats. Following this argument, we reason that the current construction of walls in several European countries reflects the rebirth of a realistic perception of the border, and this is one more challenge for Europe regarding its unity and solidarity. Is this the end of the Schengen Agreement? What is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> European project if each state unilaterally adopts a strategy to deal with illegal immigration and refugees that are coming to Europe? Can immigration lead to a retrocession of the EU idealist significance of border...|$|E
