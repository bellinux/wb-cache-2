40|$|Kane's (1984) Crawler System for {{satellite}} retrieval {{is enhanced}} by incorporating out-of-plane as well as in-plane motion. It is shown that a fixed length deployed tether applies stabilizing restoring forces to the payload during retrieval phase, and in effect, significantly reduces both the in-plane equilibrium <b>hangoff</b> angles and the build-up of in-plane and out-of-plane swinging. These Crawler System characteristics suggest that a simpler control system can be utilized and that significantly faster deployment and retrieval scenarios are possible without compromising safety...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{serves as}} a preparatory study for a new concept in {{subsurface}} towing proposed by Acergy Norway. 3 different mathematical methods for determining the most important dynamics occurring during a subsurface towing operation is therefore discussed and compared. The 3 models examined is a simple mass-spring system with forced excitations implemented in Matlab (chapter 6), a multibody time domain simulation in SIMO (chapter 7) and a model test for verification of results (chapter 9). The accuracy of the relatively simple hand calculations is discussed and compared to experimental values in chapter 10. The {{first part of this}} thesis includes a description of different concepts for transportation of subsea templates to installation site. Transportation by subsurface towing instead of using a barge can reduce operational costs if the dimensions of the structure require a heavy-lift vessel. Also risk related to pendulum motions in air is reduced, and subsurface towing is therefore of great interest to marine contractors. The most significant parameters to check by hand calculations in a subsurface towing operation is natural frequencies and modes of the dynamic system, and also estimates of the maximum/minimum loads lifting wires and slings. Since simple hand calculation models are of interest in early concept studies, formulas for these values are derived in chapter 6. These formulas are also found in (DNV Recommended practice H 103, 2009). SIMO is a time domain simulation program for multibody systems, which allows export of station keeping forces and connecting force mechanism (lifting wire and slings). Based on a system description file provided by Acergy Norway, a suitable model of the Gjøa ITS subsea template is made, and positioned 50 [m] below the moonpool <b>hangoff</b> point. Multiple analyses with different sea conditions and towing velocities have been done in SIMO to determine the feasibility and best practice of a subsurface towing operation. In addition, a towing tank experiment was performed in Marine Cybernetics towing tank at Tyholt in Trondheim. A detailed model of the Gjøa ITS was made in 2008, and numerous previous experiments have been conducted (e. g Solaas(2008) and Eilertsen(2008)) which provided valuable information and reduced the required amount of work in planning a model experiment. In the experiment the template was towed with a vertical oscillator to simulate the vessel translation in head sea and forces were measured in the lifting wire. These model experiments were made for various environmental conditions, and compared to the numerical models previously described. A correct representation of the towing arrangement in SIMO provides a relatively inexpensive model for further dynamic analysis of the system. A heave compensation device can easily be implemented in SIMO when the model of the vessel and template is correctly represented and can therefore be of valuable importance when designing a new conceptual hangoff-structure. </p...|$|E
40|$|A {{floating}} {{production system}} (FPS) {{consists of a}} floating structure, a mooring system, anchors and risers. Such systems enable production for larger ocean depths. Risers are vertical pipes used for transportation of production fluids between the seabed and the production unit. FPS and its components are presented and discussed in this thesis. Using an FPS entails certain challenges; risers, for instance, need other properties than for fixed structures, as they will hang from the floating unit, and {{must be able to}} absorb vessel movement. FPS is also a good option in remote areas with little infrastructure, as for the Barents Sea. When operating in arctic areas, additional challenges connected to the environment must be considered. In this thesis, challenges such as darkness, low temperatures and ice issues are identified and categorised. The Goliat field is the first operating field to start production of oil in arctic areas. At this field, a circular Floating Production, Storage and Offloading (FPSO) unit operates, and it is equipped with flexible risers. A model of this circular FPSO is modeled as a uniform cylinder with a draught of 32. 2 metres. A 644 metre long steep wave flexible riser is modelled to span between the platform and the seabed in the 400 metre deep water. A parameter study is performed to investigate the influence on the riser response. The analyses are performed in RILFEX, a software utilized for static and dynamic analysis of slender marine structures. The varying parameters are the current profile, the riser diameter and the drag coefficient. An analysis for varying horizontal offset of the platform, relative to the riser's touch down point (TDP) on the seabed, is also performed. The platform position that results in lowest effective tension in the riser, is 250 metres away from TDP. For this case, the riser also has lowest response amplitude. Analyses are performed for three current profiles, uniform current, linear current and no current. It is found that by increasing the current, curvature near the riser top decreases. The case where linear current is applied, the largest tension in the riser occurs. Current variation also leads to change in the vertical displacement. For the case with no current, the riser top has a larger displacement in the negative z-direction, compared to the cases when current is applied. The next parameter subject to change is the diameter, and three cases were studied. For increasing diameter, the weight is also increased, and the additional buoyancy due to increased volume, does not even out the added weight. As a consequence, some results might be affected more by the weight change, rather than by the change of diameter. Regarding curvature and tension, the two risers with largest diameter and weight behaves similarly, compared to the smallest riser. The two largest diameters experience larger tension and have less curvature at the <b>hangoff,</b> which corresponds with the additional weight. The last parameter that was studied was the drag coefficient. For variation in diameter and drag, the displacement in vertical direction is only slightly affected near the riser top. As it is the riser properties that are changed, rather than external loading, the vessel motion is not significantly affected. The vertical displacement of the riser is affected more by change of riser properties at positions further from the vessel...|$|E
