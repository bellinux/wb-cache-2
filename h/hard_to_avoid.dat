As Scully speaks to Mulder on her cellphone while driving her car, a woman appears on a crosswalk. Scully brakes <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> hitting the woman. As she does so, she narrowly avoids colliding with a diesel truck. She realizes that, had the woman not stepped in her path, the truck would have killed her. When she later arrives {{at the house of}} Azar, she observes that Scully is going through a personal crisis and tries to offer her guidance, but Scully is dismissive.|$|E

50|$|A {{contributing}} factor to deer-vehicle collisions, as preventable {{as it is}} prevalent, {{is the time of}} day at which motorists travel through deer habitation. During the daytime, motorists can more easily see and avoid hitting deer. At night, most especially during the dusk and dawn hours, deer are much <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> see, and therefore <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> hitting.|$|R
50|$|Luigi, Mario's brother {{from the}} Super Mario Bros. series was {{introduced}} in version 2.0. Luigi uses his gameplay from Super Mario Bros.

25|$|According to the Hurt Report, most {{motorcycle}} {{riders in}} the United States would over-brake and skid {{the rear wheel}} and under-brake the front when trying <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> a collision. The ability to countersteer and swerve was essentially absent with many motorcycle operators. The often small amount of initial countersteering input required to get the bike to lean, which may {{be as little as}} 0.125 seconds, keeps many riders unaware of the concept.|$|E
25|$|Biocides {{need not}} be {{poisonous}} to humans, because they can target metabolic pathways absent in humans, leaving only incidental toxicity. For instance, the herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid is a mimic of a plant growth hormone, which causes uncontrollable growth leading {{to the death of}} the plant. Humans and animals, lacking this hormone and its receptor, are unaffected by this, and need to ingest relatively large doses before any toxicity appears. Human toxicity is, however, <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> with pesticides targeting mammals, such as rodenticides.|$|E
25|$|Paolo's madrigals combine Italian and French notation, {{and show}} {{considerable}} {{influence of the}} Avignon mannerist school of the ars subtilior in their complex and intricate rhythmic patterns; however {{most of them are}} for only two voices, a conservative choice. The ballate are more progressively done overall; most are for three voices, and are lyrical, melodic, but yet use some of the extreme rhythmic intricacies of the ars subtilior school. The influence of Landini, <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> for any Florentine composer late in the 14th century, is evident both in the madrigals and the ballate.|$|E
50|$|The Spectrum {{version of}} the game, like all the titles since Dizzy 3, has both 48k and 128k {{versions}} packaged. The 128k version features richer graphics and animation, extended dialogue and a background music track. Besides that, the acid raindrops in it are <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> due <b>to</b> a different animation sequence.|$|R

50|$|Living {{close to}} humans, the Key deer has {{little of the}} natural fear of man shown by most of their larger {{mainland}} relatives. The deer are often found in residents' yards and along roadsides where plants and flowers grow. This often results in car-to-deer collisions, as the deer are more active (and <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid)</b> at night. It is not unusual to see them at dusk and dawn.|$|R
25|$|Contrastingly {{in other}} Asian cultures, {{especially}} for families in South Asia and the Far East, family honor depends on other {{factors such as}} education. Academic success of a student {{is seen as a}} source of pride and honor for the Asian family. Therefore, both the Asian student and the parents work <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> academic failure which brings shame to the family. In the past, honor in East Asia was also linked to success in the battlefield. In Japan, for example, ritualized suicide practices such as harakiri were committed by Japanese samurai for centuries {{in the event of a}} defeat in battle. Instead of being captured or living with the shame of defeat, harakiri was committed in order to preserve the honor of their families.|$|E

Among the vessels escorting Iowa on this trip was the destroyer [...] which was involved in several mishaps, the most serious of which involved a torpedo drill which went awry when a torpedo from William D. Porter discharged from its tube and headed toward Iowa. On being warned, Iowa turned <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> being hit by the torpedo and the torpedo detonated in the ship's wake. Iowa was unhurt and trained her main guns on William D. Porter, concerned that the smaller ship may have been involved in some sort of assassination plot.|$|E

500|$|Show {{scriptwriter}} Mark Catley, {{who wrote}} the third standalone episode [...] "Holby Sin City", received negative criticism about the episode from fans, expressing their displeasure at the episode. Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy labelled [...] "Holby Sin City" [...] as [...] "one of the show's most divisive episodes ever." [...] The show faced further criticism following the broadcast of episode forty-three, which featured a patient crash his lorry after blacking out while driving. The character was diagnosed with narcolepsy, but refused to tell the DVLA about his diagnosis. The storyline was compared to the real-life 2014 Glasgow bin lorry crash, with four similarities made between the fictional crash and the real-life crash, and described as [...] "deeply unfortunate". A BBC spokesperson said, [...] "We would never knowingly imitate a real life event. Parallels can be drawn with many of our storylines. However, {{with the amount of}} stories that we tell of characters in extreme situations, it is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> dramatising situations that can occasionally be reminiscent of real life events".|$|E

In each locale, the obstacles get <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> and time taken to complete each course becomes higher. Common obstacles include vertical pistons, swinging hammers, trampolines, swinging ropes, metal climbing chains, conveyor belts of varying speed and direction, collapsing floors, levitation platforms, and water balloons. Players with an Xbox Live membership may compare times with friends or play head-to-head against online opponents.|$|R

He made his Olympic debut at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy, placing 11th in the Nordic combined, 4th in the sprint, and 5th in the team event.
