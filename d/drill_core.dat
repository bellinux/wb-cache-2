500|$|In 1997, {{workers of}} an oil {{platform}} of the Snorre oil field, located at {{the northern end of}} the North Sea, were drilling through sandstone for oil exploration when they stumbled on a fossil they believed to be plant material. The <b>drill</b> <b>core</b> containing the fossil was extracted from [...] below the seafloor. Martin Sander and Nicole Klein, palaeontologists of the University of Bonn, analysed the bone microstructure and concluded that the rock preserved fibrous bone tissue from a fragment of a limb bone belonging to Plateosaurus, making it the first dinosaur found in Norway. Plateosaurus material has also been found in the Fleming Fjord Formation of East Greenland.|$|E
2500|$|The Temagami Mining and Milling Company {{operated}} a concentrating plant and worked two shafts, one open cut and one adit from 1905 to 1908. A former railway siding, known as Grey's siding, {{was used to}} ship ore away from the mine site. The shipped ore averaged [...] of gold per ton. Analysis of <b>drill</b> <b>core</b> data ranged from trace to [...] of gold per ton and from trace to [...] of silver per ton. Ore was hoisted by skip then dumped into a Blake jaw crusher at the concentrating plant. It was then dried, passed through roll crushers and elevated to trommels for sizing. The oversized ore passed down through a fine roll crusher. After the reduced ore fragments passed through roll crushers, it was then put through three Kriem air separators in the mill. The ore concentrates from these separators were drawn off and bagged for shipping. A [...] long and [...] wide arsenic vein was also mined during this period. All of the mining infrastructure was subsequently destroyed by a forest fire and operations were not renewed. There are no data available on how much the mine produced. Since the closure of Big Dan, the adit and shafts have been flooded. Remains of the former concentrating plant are also present.|$|E

50|$|HSS <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> {{are made}} from High Speed Steel material. These are most popular <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> or annular cutters in market. HSS <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> are cheaper for smaller {{diameter}} i.e 40 mm. The biggest advantage of HSS <b>core</b> <b>drill</b> {{is its ability to}} re-sharpen. Unlike TCT <b>core</b> <b>drills,</b> HSS <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> re-sharpened and used with good efficiency until the desirable length is remaining. HSS <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> have longer service life, high heat resistance: the charecteristics of HSS <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> is that <b>drilling</b> with these <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> can be done without the use of excessive force.|$|R
50|$|The {{types of}} <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> are {{categorized}} by the material used to manufacture them: Primarily a metal <b>core</b> <b>drill</b> {{is made from}} High Speed Steel and Tungsten Carbide Tips. So commercially the types of <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> are HSS <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> and TCT <b>core</b> <b>drills.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The KGS {{provides}} {{a variety of}} information related to {{oil and gas production}} through the KGS website, the Data Resources Library and <b>Drill</b> <b>Core</b> Library in Lawrence, and the Wichita Well Sample Library, which collects, archives, and loans cuttings samples from more than 130,000 wells drilled in Kansas. Data on Kansas oil and gas production are available through the KGS interactive oil and gas field map. In support of the [...] sequestration and enhanced oil recovery project, the Data Resources Library added a large quantity of new oil and gas records and data to its online database, and the <b>Drill</b> <b>Core</b> Library added important new collections to its inventory.|$|E
50|$|The mineral {{has been}} {{recently}} reported from <b>drill</b> <b>core</b> in Lonar lake in Buldhana district, Maharashtra, India.

5000|$|The IODP/ODP - Kernlager / Bremen Core Repository (BCR) at the University of Bremen has a {{collection}} of 140 km of <b>drill</b> <b>core</b> from the Ocean Drilling Program with 190,000 individual pieces, which are stored in a 1.100m ² large cold storage at 4 °C.|$|E
50|$|TCT <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> {{are made}} from Tungsten Carbide {{material}} on their tips. Tungsten carbide is a very hard material and supposed {{to be one of}} the hardest materials made by man. TCT <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> are more expensive then HSS <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> but are faster and easy to make bigger holes. There are also different types in TCT <b>core</b> <b>drills.</b> TCT <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> are cheaper for bigger diameter i.e. above 41 mm. They are very efficient for cutting hard material. The chances of tip breakage in TCT <b>core</b> <b>drill</b> is more compared to HSS <b>Core</b> <b>drills.</b> TCT <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> has a disadvantage that it can not be reground. Once the TCT <b>core</b> <b>drill</b> is damaged it has to be thrown away, it can not be re used like the HSS <b>core</b> <b>drills.</b> It is always recommended by manufacturers to use TCT <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> only for larger diameter and for very hard material, while giving priority to HSS <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> because of its price and re-sharpening advantages.|$|R
50|$|A Standard TCT <b>core</b> <b>drill</b> has {{tungsten}} carbide tips. These types of <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> {{are now available}} in vast range of diameter, for up to 150 mm. These are popularly used <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> on magnetic <b>core</b> <b>drilling</b> machines. These <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> are popularly used to drill materials like railway tracks, structural steel, stainless steel, cast iron, etc.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Core</b> <b>drills</b> used {{in metal}} are called annular cutters. <b>Core</b> <b>drills</b> used for {{concrete}} are generally called Diamond <b>Core</b> <b>Drills</b> and are water cooled. [...] For <b>drilling</b> masonry, carbide <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> can be used.|$|R
50|$|It was {{discovered}} in November 2006, in <b>drill</b> <b>core</b> from the Jadar Valley (Јадар) in Serbia, from which it is named. The find was located 10 km southwest of the Cer mountain. It was confirmed as a new mineral after scientists at the Natural History Museum in London and the National Research Council of Canada conducted tests on it. Exploration geologists from Rio Tinto Exploration discovered the mineral as small rounded nodules in <b>drill</b> <b>core,</b> and after being unable to match it with previously known minerals enlisted the expertise of Chris Stanley, from the Natural History Museum, who later described it as being unique to mineralogy. Findings were originally located in the villages of Jarebice and Slatina and later in Draginac.|$|E
5000|$|Gaylussite is {{the mineral}} has been {{recently}} reported from <b>drill</b> <b>core</b> in Lonar lake. [...] Gaylussite is a carbonate mineral, a hydrated sodium calcium carbonate, formula Na2Ca(CO3)2·5H2O. It occurs as translucent, vitreous white to grey to yellow monoclinic prismatic crystals. It is an unstable mineral which dehydrates in dry air and decomposes in water.|$|E

50|$|Borisodon is an extinct genus of eutherians which {{existed in}} what is now Kazakhstan during the Turonian age. It was {{described}} by J. David Archibald and Alexander Averianov in 2012, as a new genus for the species Sorlestes kara, which was originally described by Nessov in 1993. The type specimen was a mandible (CCMGE 101/12455), discovered at Near Ashchikol' Lake, <b>drill</b> <b>core.</b> Borisodon was a tree-climbing insectivore.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the type location in the Sandy mine in New Mexico, {{it has been reported}} from Coat-an-Noz, Cotes-du-Nord, France; in <b>drill</b> <b>core</b> from the North Sea; from Klatovy, Czech Republic; Ishimskaya Luka, northern Kazakhstan; the Slyudyanka complex, Sayan Mountains, near Lake Baikal region of Russia and the Yamoto mine, Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan. It is also found in the metalliferious black shales of the Korean Peninsula.|$|E
50|$|The {{calculation}} {{has taken}} place in 1995 which makes it 24 years after the branch broke off the tree. They estimated that it took four years for the tree to reach chest height and which sets the minimum age of the tree at 266. However, a part of the <b>drill</b> <b>core</b> was missing so the researchers estimated that the tree was probably a hundred to a hundred and fifty years older.|$|E

5000|$|Established in 1974 by the USGS, in {{cooperation}} with the Rocky Mountain Association of Geologists, the CRC was designed as a permanent free-access core repository. Its goal was to rescue rock cores threatened with disposal or destruction, which continues today with the recent rescue of the Denver Basin <b>drill</b> <b>core</b> from Castle Pines North, Colorado. During the 1990s the CRC staff provided onsite core processing services to active scientific drilling programs.|$|E

The rocks are almost entirely known from <b>drill</b> <b>core</b> and only exposed in outcrop near Spavinaw, Mayes County, Oklahoma {{and parts of the}} Saint Francois Mountains in Washington County, Missouri. The terrane is composed almost exclusively of essentially unaltered intrusive granites and volcanic rhyolite and rhyolite tuffs.|$|E
5000|$|Tookoonooka was {{discovered}} using seismic data collected during routine petroleum exploration and first {{reported in a}} publication in 1989, with proof of the impact theory coming from the discovery of shocked quartz in <b>drill</b> <b>core.</b> Estimates of the crater diameter range from 55 km to 66 km. The impact occurred during deposition of the Cretaceous Cadna-owie Formation, the age of which is variously estimated at being between 123-133 Ma, or 115-112 Ma. Tookoonooka is associated with several small oil fields.|$|E
