5|$|Spedding {{developed}} an <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> method of separating and purifying {{rare earth elements}} using <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> resins, and later used <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> to separate isotopes of individual elements, including hundreds of grams of almost pure nitrogen-15. He published over 250 peer-reviewed papers, and held 22 patents in his own name and jointly with others. Some 88 students received their Ph.D. degree under his supervision.|$|E
5|$|High-quality {{hydrochloric}} acid {{is used in}} the regeneration of <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> resins. Cation exchange is widely used to remove ions such as Na+ and Ca2+ from aqueous solutions, producing demineralized water. The acid is used to rinse the cations from the resins. Na+ is replaced with H+ and Ca2+ with 2 H+.|$|E
5|$|Dysprosium {{was first}} {{identified}} in 1886 by Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran, {{but it was}} not isolated in pure form until the development of <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> techniques in the 1950s. Dysprosium has relatively few applications where it cannot be replaced by other chemical elements. It is used for its high thermal neutron absorption cross-section in making control rods in nuclear reactors, for its high magnetic susceptibility in data storage applications, and as a component of Terfenol-D (a magnetostrictive material). Soluble dysprosium salts are mildly toxic, while the insoluble salts are considered non-toxic.|$|E
40|$|The {{photosensitivity}} of {{a commercial}} phosphate glass (Schott IOG-I), which is doped with Er 3 + ions and has been <b>ion</b> <b>exchanged</b> with Ag+ <b>ions,</b> was examined using nanosecond 248 nm excimer laser radiation. Grating structures were inscribed in the untreated and <b>ion</b> <b>exchanged</b> Er doped IOG-l glass by employing phase mask interference in contact mode. The dependence of ultravioiet induced refractive index changes upon the <b>ion</b> <b>exchanged</b> Ag+ concentration {{and the number of}} ultraviolet pulses was studied using diffraction efficiency measurements. Refractive index changes in untreated glasses are of the order of 10 - 5, whereas for silver <b>ion</b> <b>exchanged</b> samples they reach ~ 2. 0 x 10 - 3, for ultraviolet exposures of 30000 pulses of 400 mJ/cm 2 energy density. Measurements of the absorption spectra of exposed and unexposed samples were carried out in order to reveal absorption bands and illustrate photosensitivity mechanisms. Furthermore, energy dispersive spectrum microanalysis and scanning electron microscopy of the exposed <b>ion</b> <b>exchanged</b> glass samples reveal that ultraviolet radiation induces migration of the Ag+ ions towards the areas of high energy density...|$|R
40|$|Three {{types of}} nickel metal {{catalyst}} supported on silica gel {{have been prepared}} using impregnation, <b>ion</b> <b>exchanged</b> sodium hydroxide and <b>ion</b> <b>exchanged</b> ammonia methods, in order to investigate the influence of preparation methods on metal dispersion and their activities for amination of ethanol. All the catalyst samples had a nominal nickel loading of 5 % (w/w). After preparation, the catalysts were activated by a drying stage followed by calcination and reduction. The result of transferring the nickel salt to the support phase {{has shown that the}} impregnation method was the most efficient, and the least efficient being the <b>ion</b> <b>exchanged</b> sodium hydroxide method. The results from the carbon monoxide chemisorption studies showed that the nickel is poorly dispersed(2 %) in the impregnated sample, and highly dispersed(20 %) in the <b>ion</b> <b>exchanged</b> sample prepared by the ammonia method. The dispersion was lower(6 %) for the catalyst prepared by the sodium hydroxide method due to the formation of sodium nickel silicates which were difficult to reduce. The amination of ethanol over these catalysts was found to take place at 503 OK with methane being formed as a byproduct. The <b>ion</b> <b>exchanged</b> sample prepared by the ammonia method gave the highest yield(57 %) of ethylamine although its specific activity/m 2 nickel metal(4 x 10 - 7) was similar to the sample prepared by the impregnation method. The retained sodium in the <b>ion</b> <b>exchanged</b> sodium hydroxide catalyst poisoned metal sites for ethanol amination...|$|R

5|$|Lithium {{isotopes}} fractionate substantially {{during a}} wide variety of natural processes, including mineral formation (chemical precipitation), metabolism, and <b>ion</b> <b>exchange.</b> Lithium ions substitute for magnesium and iron in octahedral sites in clay minerals, where 6Li is preferred to 7Li, resulting in enrichment of the light isotope in processes of hyperfiltration and rock alteration. The exotic 11Li is known to exhibit a nuclear halo. The process known as laser isotope separation can be used to separate lithium isotopes, in particular 7Li from 6Li.|$|E
5|$|Ytterbium is {{separated}} from other rare earths either by <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> or by reduction with sodium amalgam. In the latter method, a buffered acidic solution of trivalent rare earths is treated with molten sodium-mercury alloy, which reduces and dissolves Yb3+. The alloy is treated with hydrochloric acid. The metal is extracted from the solution as oxalate and converted to oxide by heating. The oxide is reduced to metal by heating with lanthanum, aluminium, cerium or zirconium in high vacuum. The metal is purified by sublimation and collected over a condensed plate.|$|E
5|$|A more {{detailed}} procedure adopted at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory was as follows: the initial mixture of actinides is processed with <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> using lithium chloride reagent, then precipitated as hydroxides, filtered and dissolved in nitric acid. It is then treated with high-pressure elution from cation exchange resins, and the berkelium phase is oxidized and extracted {{using one of}} the procedures described above. Reduction of the thus-obtained berkelium(IV) to the +3 oxidation state yields a solution, which is nearly free from other actinides (but contains cerium). Berkelium and cerium are then separated with another round of ion-exchange treatment.|$|E
30|$|The Na- 50 (MCM- 41 /ZSM- 5) {{samples were}} {{subsequently}} exchanged with Cr 3 + ions, again with 1  g solid in 40  ml solution of 0.1  M Cr(NO 3) 2. The chromium <b>ion</b> <b>exchanges</b> were done under stirring at 50  °C for 3  h. The pH control was employed throughout all <b>ion</b> <b>exchanges</b> and the pH value was {{adjusted to the}} desired range (5 – 6) by adding MeNH 2 (40  wt % in water) before introducing the solid. The final solid was recovered by filtration, washed several times with de-ionised water and dried (150  °C, 5  h) before being analysed by various characterisations. The chromium-exchanged composite material obtained is denoted by Cr-(50 -MCM- 41 /ZSM- 5).|$|R
30|$|The {{overall results}} {{indicate}} that under identical experimental conditions, as compared to Duolite ARA- 9366 B resins, Purolite NRW- 5010 resins shows higher percentage of <b>ions</b> <b>exchanged.</b> Thus, Purolite NRW- 5010 resins show superior performance over Duolite ARA- 9366 B resins under identical operational parameters.|$|R
50|$|In 2014 a {{rechargeable}} magnesium battery {{was reported}} utilising a <b>ion</b> <b>exchanged,</b> olivine type MgFeSiO4 cathode with a bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide/triglyme electrolyte - the cell showed {{a capacity of}} 300mAh/g with a voltage of 2.4V. MgMnSiO4 has also been investigated as a potential Mg2+ insertion cathode.|$|R
5|$|Further {{separation}} {{was carried}} out {{in the presence of a}} citric acid/ammonium buffer solution in a weakly acidic medium (pH≈3.5), using <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> at elevated temperature. The chromatographic separation behavior was then unknown for the element 97, but was anticipated by analogy with terbium (see elution curves). First results were disappointing as no alpha-particle emission signature could be detected from the elution product. Only the further search for characteristic X-rays and conversion electron signals resulted in the identification of a berkelium isotope. Its mass number was uncertain between 243 and 244 in the initial report, but was later established as 243.|$|E
5|$|It is {{relatively}} {{difficult to separate}} ytterbium from other lanthanides due to its similar properties. As a result, the process is somewhat long. First, minerals such as monazite or xenotime are dissolved into various acids, such as sulfuric acid. Ytterbium can then be separated from other lanthanides by <b>ion</b> <b>exchange,</b> as can other lanthanides. The solution is then applied to a resin, which different lanthanides bind in different matters. This is then dissolved using complexing agents, and due to {{the different types of}} bonding exhibited by the different lanthanides, it is possible to isolate the compounds.|$|E
5|$|Uranium ore is mined {{in several}} ways: by open pit, underground, in-situ leaching, and {{borehole}} mining (see uranium mining). Low-grade uranium ore mined typically contains 0.01 to 0.25% uranium oxides. Extensive measures must {{be employed to}} extract the metal from its ore. High-grade ores found in Athabasca Basin deposits in Saskatchewan, Canada can contain up to 23% uranium oxides on average. Uranium ore is crushed and rendered into a fine powder and then leached with either an acid or alkali. The leachate is subjected to one of several sequences of precipitation, solvent extraction, and <b>ion</b> <b>exchange.</b> The resulting mixture, called yellowcake, contains at least 75% uranium oxides U3O8. Yellowcake is then calcined to remove impurities from the milling process before refining and conversion.|$|E

5|$|Water used in {{the steam}} cycle is taken from the local mains water, {{supplied}} by Northumbrian Water. Up to 300,000 tons of mains water per year is {{used in the}} station, however it has to be cleaned of impurities before use. This is done at an on site water treatment plant that uses a process of <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> to remove impurities such as silica and control PH levels so as to avoid boiler tube corrosion. This treated water is used to make superheated steam in the coal-fired boilers, that will turn the turbines before being recovered in the condenser and reused.|$|E
5|$|Crushed {{minerals}} {{are treated}} with hot concentrated sulfuric acid to produce water-soluble sulfates of rare earths. Thorium precipitates out of solution as hydroxide and is removed. After that the solution is treated with ammonium oxalate to convert rare earths into their insoluble oxalates. The oxalates are converted to oxides by annealing. The oxides are dissolved in nitric acid that excludes {{one of the main}} components, cerium, whose oxide is insoluble in HNO3. Several rare earth metals, including lutetium, are separated as a double salt with ammonium nitrate by crystallization. Lutetium is separated by <b>ion</b> <b>exchange.</b> In this process, rare-earth ions are sorbed onto suitable ion-exchange resin by exchange with hydrogen, ammonium or cupric ions present in the resin. Lutetium salts are then selectively washed out by suitable complexing agent. Lutetium metal is then obtained by reduction of anhydrous LuCl3 or LuF3 by either an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal.|$|E
5|$|Samarium is {{not found}} free in nature, but, like other rare earth elements, is {{contained}} in many minerals, including monazite, bastnäsite, cerite, gadolinite and samarskite; monazite (in which samarium occurs at concentrations of up to 2.8%) and bastnäsite are mostly used as commercial sources. World resources of samarium are estimated at two million tonnes; they are mostly located in China, US, Brazil, India, Sri Lanka and Australia, and the annual production is about 700 tonnes. Country production reports are usually given for all rare-earth metals combined. By far, China has the largest production with 120,000 tonnes mined per year; it {{is followed by the}} US (about 5,000tonnes) and India (2,700tonnes). Samarium is usually sold as oxide, which at the price of about 30USD/kg is one of the cheapest lanthanide oxides. Whereas mischmetal – a mixture of rare earth metals containing about 1% of samarium – has long been used, relatively pure samarium has been isolated only recently, through <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> processes, solvent extraction techniques, and electrochemical deposition. The metal is often prepared by electrolysis of a molten mixture of samarium(III) chloride with sodium chloride or calcium chloride. Samarium can also be obtained by reducing its oxide with lanthanum. The product is then distilled to separate samarium (boiling point 1794°C) and lanthanum (b.p.3464°C).|$|E
40|$|Hierarchical SAPO- 34 with {{incorporated}} copper {{was tried}} synthesised both through a dry gel conversion and a hydrothermal method. Crystalline copper incorporated hierarchical SAPO- 34 was not obtained through these directions. However, the hydrothermal method provided crystalline SAPO- 34 {{and the degree}} of uniformity concerning mesoporosity was determined by N 2 - physisorption (BET). The crystalline SAPO- 34 was <b>ion</b> <b>exchanged</b> with copper(II) nitrate and copper(II) tetraamine in order to determine activity for NO conversion in HC-SCR. For comparison, a conventional microporous SAPO- 34 and mesoporous SBA- 15 was <b>ion</b> <b>exchanged</b> as well in order to compare the effect of porosity.

Here, the conventional Cu-SAPO- 34 was found to be more active than the hierarchical Cu-SAPO- 34, whereas the hierarchical Cu-SAPO- 34 had similar conversion as the mesoporous SBA- 15. Ex Situ XAS spectroscopy was performed in order to tell differences of the local environment for copper before and after HC-SCR for the hierarchical Cu-SAPO- 34. In addition, the conventional SAPO- 34 and the mesoporous SBA- 15 were also analysed Ex Situ pre reaction.
