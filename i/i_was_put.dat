5|$|I {{must confess}} that, like many others, I {{did not come}} painlessly to the Natural History. For years <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>put</b> off by the aura of {{sanctity}} and bluffness which seemed to surround it. It {{was the kind of}} book presented on prize-giving days, and I saw it as a work, in all senses, of the old school. Even when I eventually came to read it, I cannot say my opinion changed dramatically. I could not cope at first with its rambling disorder, its sudden plunges into thickets of taxonomic Latin, and, for a while, I failed to notice the feeling behind the often dispassionate prose.|$|E
25|$|The opulent Cappella dei Principi, an idea {{formulated}} by Cosimo <b>I,</b> <b>was</b> <b>put</b> into effect by Ferdinand I de' Medici. It {{was designed by}} Matteo Nigetti, following some sketches tendered to an informal competition of 1602 by Don Giovanni de' Medici, the natural son of Cosimo I, Grand Duke of Tuscany, which were altered in the execution by the aged Buontalenti. A true expression of court art, it {{was the result of}} collaboration among designers and patrons.|$|E
25|$|The {{connection}} between Follo and Hurumlandet was originally {{served by the}} Drøbak–Storsand Ferry, a service operated by Bilferjen Drøbak–Hurum. Planning of the ferry service commenced in 1939 and its first ferry, Leif 1, serve the crossing until 1954. It was then replaced with Drøbaksund, which was itself replaced with the larger Drøbaksund II in 1968. The company took over the Svelvik–Verket Ferry, which connects Hurumlandet to Vestfold, in 1971. Drøbaksund <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>put</b> into service in 1978 and Drøbaksund III in 1985. From 1993 it was supplemented with Hurumferja, hence the service having two ferries. The ferry had a daily traffic of 320 vehicles in 1980.|$|E

25|$|Shamshi-Adad I (c. 1754 BC – c. 1721 BC), son of Ila-kabkabu, {{inherited}} the throne in Terqa {{from his father}} c. 1785 BC. Shamshi-Adad I was forced to flee to Babylon while Naram-Suen of Eshnunna attacked Ekallatum c. 1761 BC. Shamshi-Adad I conquered Assur, took over the long-abandoned town of Shekhna in north-eastern Syria, converted it into {{the capital city of}} his Upper Mesopotamian Empire, renamed it to Shubat-Enlil, and emerged as the first Amorite king of Assyria c. 1754 BC. Shamshi-Adad I placed his sons in key geographical locations and gave them responsibility to look over those areas. While he remained in Šubat-Enlil, his eldest son, Ishme-Dagan <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>put</b> on the throne of Ekallatum.|$|E
25|$|During her imprisonment, Maria Luisa and her {{children}} were stripped of their rights to the Spanish crown by the Cádiz Cortes, on 18 March 1812, because she was under Napoleon's control. Her rights were not restored until 1820. The former Queen of Etruria wrote in her Memoirs:I was {{for two years and}} a half in that monastery and one year without seeing or talking to anybody. I was not allowed to write or receive news not even from my own son. I had been in the convent for eleven months already when my parents came with my son to Rome on 16 June 1812. I was hoping to be released immediately after their arrival, but I was wrong, instead of diminishing the rigor of my imprisonment <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>put</b> under stricter orders.|$|E
500|$|McCall {{was picked}} for England and Scotland under-21 sides {{on the same}} day in 1984, and chose to join the England under-21 squad for their game against Turkey. However he was only picked as a {{substitute}} and the referee blew the final whistle, with McCall waiting to come on. He later told Scottish newspaper Glasgow Herald, [...] "I felt it was a mistake almost from the start. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>put</b> on the bench and they tried to bring me on with a minute to go. But I took my time re-tying my boots and generally warming up and luckily didn't get on, otherwise that would have been that." [...] Since he had not actually played for England, McCall was still eligible for Scotland. He eventually switched allegiances to the latter, for whom he qualified through his father. He made his Scotland debut at under-21 level in March 1988, ironically against England. McCall made one more appearance for Scotland under 21s, against France in 1990.|$|E

500|$|He {{looked through}} the Yellow Pages for jobs and played at bar mitzvahs for $125; he later said [...] " [...] was glad to do it." [...] Weinberg became the live drummer for 10,000 Maniacs in 1992 after their drummer Jerry Augustyniak was injured five days before a five-week tour. He went after that {{assignment}} once he heard it was open and later said, [...] "I lived on a bus and had a roommate. Not exactly like the E Street Band, but I loved it. It reminded me that I am a drummer and I'm good. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>put</b> here to play the drums. To {{turn my back on}} that ability was wrong." [...] He played at the January 1993 inauguration of Bill Clinton. Weinberg auditioned in 1993 to be the principal drummer on the Broadway show The Who's Tommy, but was selected instead as the second substitute. Despite the very low pay, Weinberg was nevertheless happy: [...] "I'd buried drumming so far into my psyche. I felt I'd resurrected it." [...] Of Springsteen's work, Weinberg felt [...] "that I would never get to play these songs again." ...|$|E

He was 30 years younger than West, and later changed his name to Paul Novak. He soon moved in with her, and their romance continued until West's death in 1980 at age 87.

2500|$|While at Idaho, Lightfoot also {{excelled in}} the classroom, {{which was the}} {{opposite}} of what had been occurring at the high school and junior college levels. He did not miss a single class in his three years and graduated on time. Years later, he had this retrospective on the change: [...] "I was not dumb, just lazy and spoiled. [...] <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>put</b> on probation at Idaho and they would have kicked me out of there if I screwed up even once. [...] Basketball was everything to me and it was my out, so I gave it all I had and buckled down in school." ...|$|E

2500|$|Chase J. Nielsen, {{one of the}} U.S. airmen {{who flew}} in the Doolittle raid {{following}} the attack on Pearl Harbor, was subjected to waterboarding by his Japanese captors. At their trial for war crimes following the war, he testified [...] "Well, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>put</b> on my back {{on the floor with}} my arms and legs stretched out, one guard holding each limb. The towel was wrapped around my face and put across my face and water poured on. They poured water on this towel until I was almost unconscious from strangulation, then they would let up until I'd get my breath, then they'd start over again... I felt more or less like I was drowning, just gasping between life and death." [...] In 2007, Senator John McCain claimed that the United States military hanged Japanese soldiers for waterboarding American prisoners of war during World War II. A minimal sentence for Japanese soldiers convicted of waterboarding American soldiers was 15 years.|$|E

2500|$|In 2007, Gibbons and {{his wife}} Dawn {{purchased}} [...] {{of land in the}} ranch country near Lamoille, Nevada, approximately 20 miles South of Elko, Nevada. The land belonged to former Nevada Judge Jerry Carr Whitehead. The Elko County Assessor said he felt pressure from the governor, governor's lawyer {{and a member of the}} Nevada Tax Commission to lower the tax liability. Under state law, such an agricultural tax break goes only to legitimate farm and ranch operations, and must generate at least $5,000 a year in income. If such a land is developed by million-dollar homes, property taxes would go up. [...] "To say <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>put</b> in an awkward position I think is an understatement", Joe Aguirre, a Republican, told The Associated Press in 2008. [...] The opinion page of the Las Vegas Review-Journal said on the allegations that the deal might constitute fraud. Aguirre later admitted that his previous statements were made up on the Las Vegas Sun saying that he wasn't pressured into Gibbons tax break by Gibbons himself. The land deal was called off after Gibbons finalized the divorce from his wife.|$|E
