5|$|That autumn Hogg {{visited the}} couple in Edinburgh, which he greatly enjoyed. Hogg soon became very {{attracted}} to Harriet, and often spent time alone with her whenever Percy asked to write <b>in</b> <b>solitude.</b> Hogg eventually told Harriet of his feelings towards her, but she politely rebuffed him, {{and began to read}} novels with moral themes aloud in his presence.|$|E
5|$|Fears <b>in</b> <b>Solitude</b> {{was written}} after {{rumors of a}} French {{invasion}} spread across England. Although Coleridge was opposed to Prime Minister William Pitt's control over the British government, he sided with his homeland. He began work on the poem during April 1798 and it {{was first published in}} a small pamphlet along with Frost at Midnight and France: An Ode. It was eventually printed seven times with a later printing removing any anti-Pitt sentiment.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} known texts {{often ask}} for ascetics to be <b>in</b> complete <b>solitude,</b> identifying {{the isolation of}} soul and non-soul.

5|$|Frost at Midnight {{was written}} in February 1798. It is based on Coleridge's {{childhood}} {{as well as his}} friendship with Wordsworth, who first exposed Coleridge to the wild beauty of the Lake District. The poem was published in a small work containing his France: An Ode and Fears <b>in</b> <b>Solitude.</b> It was rewritten many times; seven versions have been printed. Of these, the 1798 edition contains six concluding lines that were removed from later editions.|$|E
5|$|The Nightingale {{was written}} in April 1798, {{during the same time}} Coleridge wrote Fears <b>in</b> <b>Solitude.</b> The poem was {{included}} in the Lyrical Ballads, a joint publication with Wordsworth. The nightingale is part of a discussion directed to Wordsworths in which Coleridge refutes the traditional association between nightingales and melancholic feelings because of the bird's appearance in the myth of Philomela.|$|E
5|$|As a hermit, Withers lives <b>in</b> <b>solitude.</b> He {{does not}} own {{a car or}} television; he gets his news from {{the people around him}} and gets around on a bicycle that he found, broken, {{on the side of the}} road. Though he has an open-door policy for people that come to visit him, he himself visits family only twice a year. He does have a computer, which he uses to keep in touch with other hermits via email. To earn his food and {{clothing}} allowance, which amounts to less than $5,500 per year, Withers makes pottery to sell and works one day a week for a scientific-instrument company. At the end of each year, he donates any funds that remain to charity.|$|E

25|$|Another proven {{benefit to}} time given <b>in</b> <b>solitude</b> is the {{development}} of self. When a person spends time <b>in</b> <b>solitude</b> from others, they may experience changes to their self-concept. This can also help a person to form or discover their identity without any outside distractions. Solitude also provides time for contemplation, growth in personal spirituality, and self-examination. In these situations, loneliness can be avoided as long as the person <b>in</b> <b>solitude</b> knows that they have meaningful relations with others.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} {{benefits}} to spending time alone. Freedom {{is considered to}} be one of the benefits of solitude; the constraints of others will not have any effect on a person who is spending time <b>in</b> <b>solitude,</b> therefore giving the person more latitude in their actions. With increased freedom, a person’s choices are less likely to be affected by exchanges with others.|$|E
25|$|Another {{theme is}} the extreme legalism of the Puritans and how Hester {{chooses not to}} conform to their rules and beliefs. Hester was {{rejected}} by the villagers even though she spent her life doing what she could to help the sick and the poor. Because of the social shunning, she spent her life mostly <b>in</b> <b>solitude,</b> and wouldn't go to church.|$|E
25|$|Still, {{long-term}} solitude {{is often}} seen as undesirable, causing loneliness or reclusion resulting from inability to establish relationships. Furthermore, it might even lead to clinical depression. However, for some people, solitude is not depressing. Still others (e.g. monks) regard long-term solitude {{as a means of}} spiritual enlightenment. Indeed, marooned people have been left <b>in</b> <b>solitude</b> for years without any report of psychological symptoms afterwards.|$|E

25|$|Isabella di Morra (ca. 15201545/1546) was an Italian poet of the Renaissance. An unknown {{figure in}} her lifetime, {{she was forced}} by her {{brothers}} to live in isolation, which estranged her from courts and literary salons. While living <b>in</b> <b>solitude</b> in her castle, she produced {{a body of work}} which never circulated in the literary milieu of the time. Her short and melancholic life ended when her brothers murdered her for a suspected affair.|$|E
25|$|When he was {{two years}} old, his parents {{returned}} to their native place at Murialdo {{on the outskirts of}} Castelnuovo d'Asti (which was the birthplace of John Bosco), and from where they had gone to Riva in 1841 His parents took great care to give him a Christian upbringing. By the age of four, Dominic was able to pray by himself and was occasionally found <b>in</b> <b>solitude,</b> praying. In his biography of Dominic, John Bosco records that Savio's parents recollect how he used to help his mother around the house, welcome his father home, say his prayers without being reminded, (even reminding others when they forgot) and say Grace at mealtimes unfailingly.|$|E
25|$|At the age {{of forty}} Moses kills an Egyptian, after he sees him beating a Hebrew to death, and escapes as a {{fugitive}} into the Sinai desert, where he is taken in by the Midianites and marries Zipporah, {{the daughter of the}} Midianite priest Jethro. When he is eighty years old, Moses is tending a herd of sheep <b>in</b> <b>solitude</b> on Mount Sinai when he sees a desert shrub that is burning but is not consumed. The God of Israel calls to Moses from the fire and reveals his name, Yahweh (from the Hebrew root word 'HWH' meaning to exist), and tells Moses that he is being sent to Pharaoh to bring the people of Israel out of Egypt.|$|E

25|$|Her {{mother died}} in 1838 and she took up much of the {{domestic}} chores {{as a result of}} this while an elder sister and teacher taught her to read and write as well as to sing and use the guitar; she also learned how to sew and cook. The girl also turned a small room in her house as a domestic chapel. Martillo had a clear perception of her call to saintliness as a child and received her Confirmation on 16 September 1839. Martillo frequented a small wood near her home for contemplation <b>in</b> <b>solitude</b> while the guava tree near which she went to is now a large pilgrimage destination. The girl also chose the then-Blessed Mariana de Jesús as her patron with whom she identified and strived to imitate in her own life. Martillo was known for being sweet and thoughtful with a peaceful and generous disposition; she was obedient to those around her and was well-known and loved in her village. Martillo was blonde with bright blue eyes and was strong and agile; she was also tall.|$|E
25|$|There {{is a clear}} {{distinction}} between feeling lonely and being socially isolated (for example, a loner). In particular, one way of thinking about loneliness is as a discrepancy between one's necessary and achieved levels of social interaction, while solitude is simply the lack of contact with people. Loneliness is therefore a subjective experience; if a person thinks they are lonely, then they are lonely. People can be lonely while <b>in</b> <b>solitude,</b> or {{in the middle of a}} crowd. What makes a person lonely is the fact that they need more social interaction or a certain type of social interaction that is not currently available. A person can be in the middle of a party and feel lonely due to not talking to enough people. Conversely, one can be alone and not feel lonely; even though there is no one around that person is not lonely because there is no desire for social interaction. There have also been suggestions that each person has their own sweet spot of social interaction. If a person gets too little or too much social interaction, this could lead to feelings of loneliness or over-stimulation.|$|E
