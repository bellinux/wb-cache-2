The interaction of CO and O 2 with these oxides has been studied by in situ IR spectroscopy under steady-state and transient reaction conditions. A detailed mechanism is proposed wherein CO reacts with coordinatively unsaturated cations to give carbonyl complexes which in turn react with surface oxygen activated on anionic vacancies. Adsorbed and gaseous CO 2 also undergo much slower side reactions with lattice oxygen or surface hydroxide groups to give more stable hydrogen carbonate and carbonates species, which lead to catalyst <b>deactivation.</b> <b>Marked</b> effects of pretreatment are explained {{on the basis of the}} observed kinetics and the proposed mechanis...|$|R

40|$|The {{transformation}} of isopropanol was studied at 423 K over a mixed molybdenum-vanadium oxide, {{with and without}} platinum as well as over the corresponding hydrogen bronze prepared via hydrogen spillover. In the absence of platinum, dehydration is the main reaction. However, propane and acetone are produced in small amounts, which points to the acid-base character of the oxide and {{to the existence of}} distinct hydrogenation sites. For the Pt/oxide system, higher conversions and acetone selectivities over 90 % are obtained. A <b>marked</b> <b>deactivation</b> with time is noted, which is probably due to the continuous modification of the oxide surface and of the metal oxide contact. The hydrogen bronze of the mixed oxide exhibits a much improved activity and stability. Without platinum, switching from helium to hydrogen as carrier gas has a slight influence on the selectivity whereas for Pt/oxide, both activity and acetone selectivity are affected. The influence of temperature on the reaction was studied over the hydrogen bronze. The effect is different below and above 373 K and is related to the hydrogen stoichiometry of the bronze, the bronze with the lower stoichiometry (lacunar bronze) being the most active catalyst...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe present fMRI study {{investigated}} the hypothesis that activation of the left ventral occipitotemporal cortex (vOT) in response to auditory words {{can be attributed to}} lexical orthographic rather than lexico-semantic processing. To this end, we presented auditory words in both an orthographic (“three or four letter word?”) and a semantic (“living or nonliving?”) task. In addition, a auditory control condition presented tones in a pitch evaluation task. The results showed that the left vOT exhibited higher activation for orthographic relative to semantic processing of auditory words with a peak in the posterior part of vOT. Comparisons to the auditory control condition revealed that orthographic processing of auditory words elicited activation in a large vOT cluster. In contrast, activation for semantic processing was only weak and restricted to the middle part vOT. We interpret our findings as speaking for orthographic processing in left vOT. In particular, we suggest that activation in left middle vOT can be attributed to accessing orthographic whole-word representations. While activation of such representations was experimentally ascertained in the orthographic task, it might have also occurred automatically in the semantic task. Activation in the more posterior vOT region, on the other hand, may reflect the generation of explicit images of word-specific letter sequences required by the orthographic but not the semantic task. In addition, based on cross-modal suppression, the finding of <b>marked</b> <b>deactivations</b> in response to the auditory tones is taken to reflect the visual nature of representations and processes in left vOT...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Although {{spinal cord}} {{stimulation}} (SCS) {{is widely used}} for chronic neuropathic pain after failed spinal surgery, {{little is known about}} the underlying physiological mechanisms. This study aims to investigate the neural substrate underlying short-term (30  s) SCS by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging in 20 patients with failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS). METHODS: Twenty patients with FBSS, treated with externalized SCS, participated in a blocked functional magnetic resonance imaging design with stimulation and rest phases of 30  s each, repeated eight times in a row. During scanning, patients rated pain intensity over time using an 11 -point numerical rating scale with verbal anchors (0 [*]=[*]no pain at all to 10 [*]=[*]worst pain imaginable) by pushing buttons (left hand, lesser pain; right hand, more pain). This scale was back projected to the patients on a flat screen allowing them to manually direct the pain indicator. To increase the signal-to-noise ratio, the 8 -min block measurements were repeated three times. RESULTS: <b>Marked</b> <b>deactivation</b> of the bilateral medial thalamus and its connections to the rostral and caudal cingulate cortex and the insula was found; the study also showed immediate pain relief obtained by short-term SCS correlated negatively with activity in the inferior olivary nucleus, the cerebellum, and the rostral anterior cingulate cortex. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate the key role of the medial thalamus as a mediator and the involvement of a corticocerebellar network implicating the modulation and regulation of averse and negative affect related to pain. The observation of a deactivation of the ipsilateral antero-medial thalamus might be used as a region of interest for further response SCS studies. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The present fMRI study {{investigated}} the effects of word-likeness of visual and auditory stimuli on activity along the ventral visual stream. In {{the context of a}} one-back task, we presented visual and auditory words, pseudowords, and artificial stimuli (i. e., false-fonts and reversed-speech, respectively). Main findings were regionally specific effects of word-likeness on activation in a left ventral occipitotemporal region corresponding to the classic localization of the Visual Word Form Area (VWFA). Specifically, we found an inverse word-likeness effect for the visual stimuli in the form of decreased activation for words compared to pseudowords which, in turn, elicited decreased activation compared to the artificial stimuli. For the auditory stimuli, we found positive word-likeness effects as both words and pseudowords elicited more activation than the artificial stimuli. This resulted from a <b>marked</b> <b>deactivation</b> in response to the artificial stimuli and no such deactivation for words and pseudowords. We suggest that the opposite effects of visual and auditory word-likeness on VWFA activation can be explained by assuming the involvement of visual orthographic memory representations. For the visual stimuli, these representations reduce the coding effort as a function of word-likeness. This results in highest activation to the artificial stimuli and least activation to words for which corresponding representations exist. The positive auditory word-likeness effects may result from activation of orthographic information associated with the auditory words and pseudowords. The view that the VWFA has a primarily visual function is supported by our findings of high activation to the visual artificial stimuli (which have no phonological or semantic associations) and deactivation to the auditory artificial stimuli. According to the phenomenon of cross-modal sensory suppression such deactivations during demanding auditory processing are expected in visual regions...|$|R
40|$|SSCI-VIDE+ING+APN:DLR:NOG:YSC:FRMInternational {{audience}} 1. IntroductionSynthetic {{fuels and}} base chemicals {{can be obtained}} from both fossil and renewable sources through the conversion of synthesis gas (syngas). Biomass-derived syngas contain significant concentrations of chlorine that may contaminate downstream catalysts. Rytter and co-workers reported that the presence of Cl introduced ex situ during cobalt-based catalyst preparation decreased the metal surface without, surprisingly, affecting activity, thus increasing the turnover frequency [1]. Davis and co-workers investigated the effect of alkali and chloride addition to a Fischer-Tropsch slurry phase reactor using a Co-based catalyst and noted a <b>marked</b> <b>deactivation</b> by halides and potassium [2]. The authors related the metallic cobalt poisoning to a blocking effect of metal sites by halides and potassium in agreement with results of H 2 chemisorption obtained ex situ on used cobalt FT catalysts [2]. We report herein an operando diffuse reflectance FT-IR spectroscopy (DRIFTS) study in which the hydrogenation of CO is monitored in the presence of 150 ppm of chlorine. DRIFTS enables monitoring the state of the cobalt surface, which is typically covered with various carbonyl species under reaction conditions [3]. 2. ExperimentalThe preparation of the 14 wt. % Co/Al 2 O 3 catalyst, experimental setup, DRIFTS cell and procedures are described in details elsewhere [3]. The hydrogenation of CO was performed at atmospheric pressure using a modified high temperature DRIFT cell. The reactor effluent was quantified using a 2 m-pathlength FT-IR gas cell. Methane, ethane, propene and methanol were the main reaction products in the present conditions and were quantified, while higher hydrocarbons were not monitored. The chlorine was introduced via a saturator held at - 70 °C containing trichloroethylene (TCE). Differential conditions were used, to ensure that the catalyst bed remained gradientless. 3. Results and discussionThe rates of formation of the main products sharply decreased upon the introduction of the chlorinated compound, typically showing a 10 -fold drop. The IR signal of CO(ads) could be essentially decomposed into three bands, whether chlorine was present or not. The effect of chlorine was strongest for a surface carbonyl “B” characterized by a band located at ca. 1881 cm- 1, likely a bridged species formed on edges, steps and defect sites. The corresponding C-O bond strength increased by about 15 ± 8 kJ/mol in the presence of chlorine, based on a calibration curve presented elsewhere [3]. Two other linear carbonyl species (noted L 1 and L 2) were affected by chloride addition, albeit to a lesser extent. It must be stressed that the relative decrease of the overall carbonyl band area was far lower than that of the activity, suggesting that each chlorine atoms poisoned several surface sites and/or selectively poisoned the most active sites. The most active sites were likely those associated with the bridged CO(ads) “B”, which displayed the highest intensity loss. The effect of Cl was partly and slowly reversible. Surprisingly, the chlorine poisoning hardly affected the position of the main on-top CO(ads) IR band, in contrast to the effect of surface coverage when CO was removed from the feed. This effect is consistent with chlorine decreasing the electronic density at the cobalt metallic centers, which in turn limited the electronic back-donation from cobalt to the antibonding molecular orbitals of the adsorbed CO [3]. Assuming that the rate-determining step of the hydrogenation reaction was the C-O bond dissociation of CO(ads), the operando DRIFTS data indicated that the loss of activity was in part related to the decrease of the concentration of the carbonyl species. In addition, the electronic density removed by chlorine from the metallic cobalt limited the electronic back-donation to CO(ads) and thus limited the weakening of the C-O bond, therefore providing another cause for the observed rate decrease  4. ConclusionsOur operando DRIFTS investigation showed that chlorine strongly poisoned the activity of cobalt for CO hydrogenation. The effect is both site poisoning and electronic. The most active sites are suggested to be those associated with bridged CO(ads) absorbing at ca. 1881 cm- 1, the heat of adsorption of which is increased by about 15 kJ/mol in the presence of chlorine. 5.
