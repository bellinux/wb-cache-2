5|$|The few <b>deep-sky</b> <b>objects</b> in Aries {{are very}} dim. Nevertheless, several scientifically {{interesting}} galaxies lie within its borders; it has spiral, elliptical, and interacting galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Alpha Trianguli Australis, {{known as}} Atria, is a second-magnitude orange giant and the {{brightest}} star in the constellation, as well as the 42nd-brightest star in the night sky. Completing the triangle are the two white main sequence stars Beta and Gamma Trianguli Australis. Although the constellation lies in the Milky Way and contains many stars, <b>deep-sky</b> <b>objects</b> are not prominent. Notable features include the open cluster NGC 6025 and planetary nebula NGC 5979.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{its small}} size and {{location}} {{away from the}} plane of the Milky Way, Caelum is rather devoid of <b>deep-sky</b> <b>objects,</b> and contains no Messier objects. The only deep-sky object in Caelum to receive much attention is HE0450-2958, an unusual Seyfert galaxy. Originally, the jet's host galaxy proved elusive to find, and this jet appeared to be emanating from nothing. Although {{it has been suggested that}} the object is an ejected supermassive black hole, the host is now agreed to be a small galaxy that is difficult to see due to light from the jet and a nearby starburst galaxy.|$|E
5|$|NGC 6543 {{is a high}} {{northern}} declination <b>deep-sky</b> <b>object</b> and is {{near the}} apparent position of the North Ecliptic Pole. It has the combined magnitude of 8.1, with high surface brightness. Its small bright inner nebula subtends an average of 16.1 arcsec, with the outer prominent condensations about 25 arcsec. Deep images reveal an extended halo about 300 arcsec or 5 arcmin across, that was once ejected by the central progenitor star during its red giant phase.|$|R
5|$|The unique <b>deep-sky</b> <b>object</b> {{known as}} Hanny's Voorwerp was {{discovered}} in Leo Minor in 2007 by Dutch school teacher Hanny van Arkel while participating as a volunteer in the Galaxy Zoo project. Lying near the 650-million-light-year-distant spiral galaxy IC2497, it is around {{the same size as}} the Milky Way. It contains a 16,000-light-year-wide hole. The voorwerp is thought to be the visual light echo of a quasar now gone inactive, possibly as recently as 200,000 years ago.|$|R

5|$|Outside of the Milky Way, {{there are}} no bright <b>deep-sky</b> <b>objects</b> for amateur astronomers in Serpens Caput, with nothing else above 10th magnitude. The {{brightest}} is NGC 5962, a spiral galaxy positioned around 28 megaparsecs distant with an apparent magnitude of 11.34. Slightly fainter is NGC 5921, a barred spiral galaxy with a LINER-type active galactic nucleus situated somewhat closer {{at a distance of}} 21 megaparsecs. A type II supernova was observed in this galaxy in 2001 and was designated SN 2001X. Fainter still are the spirals NGC 5964 and NGC 6118, with the latter being host to the supernova SN 2004dk.|$|E
5|$|Part of the Milky Way's galactic plane {{passes through}} Serpens Cauda, which is {{therefore}} rich in galactic <b>deep-sky</b> <b>objects,</b> {{such as the}} Eagle Nebula (IC 4703) and its associated star cluster Messier 16. The nebula measures 70 light-years by 50 light-years and contains the Pillars of Creation, three dust clouds that became famous for the image taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. Other striking objects include the Red Square Nebula, {{one of the few}} objects in astronomy to take on a square shape; and Westerhout 40, a massive nearby star-forming region consisting of a molecular cloud and an H II region.|$|E
5|$|The Milky Way {{passes through}} much of Canis Minor, yet it has few <b>deep-sky</b> <b>objects.</b> William Herschel {{recorded}} four objects in his 1786 work Catalogue of Nebulae and Clusters of Stars, including two he mistakenly believed were star clusters. NGC 2459 {{is a group of}} five thirteenth- and fourteenth-magnitude stars that appear to lie close together in the sky but are not related. A similar situation has occurred with NGC 2394, also in Canis Minor. This is a collection of fifteen unrelated stars of ninth-magnitude and fainter.|$|E

50|$|<b>Deep-sky</b> <b>object</b> (abbreviated as DSO) {{is a term}} {{designating}} any astronomical {{object that}} is not an individual star or Solar System object (such as Sun, Moon, planet, comet, etc.). The classification is used for the most part by amateur astronomers to denote visually observed faint naked eye and telescopic objects such as star clusters, nebulae and galaxies. This distinction is practical and technical, implying a variety of instruments and techniques appropriate to observation, and does not distinguish the nature of the object itself.|$|R
2500|$|Sextans as a {{constellation}} covers a rather dim, sparse {{region of the}} sky. [...] It has only one star above the fifth magnitude, namely α Sextantis at 4.49m. [...] The constellation contains a few double stars, including γ, 35, and 40 Sextantis. [...] There are a few notable variable stars, including β, 25, 23 Sextantis, and LHS 292. NGC 3115, an edge-on lenticular galaxy, is the only noteworthy <b>deep-sky</b> <b>object.</b> It also lies near the ecliptic, which causes the Moon, {{and some of the}} planets to occasionally pass through it for brief periods of time.|$|R
5|$|The constellation's {{brightest}} star, Alpha Gruis, is {{also known}} as Alnair and appears as a 1.7-magnitude blue-white star. Beta Gruis is a red giant variable star with a minimum magnitude of 2.3 and a maximum magnitude of 2.0. Six star systems have been found to have planets: the red dwarf Gliese 832 is one of the closest stars to Earth to have a planetary system. Another—WASP-95—has a planet that orbits every two days. <b>Deep-sky</b> <b>objects</b> found in Grus include the planetary nebula IC 5148, also known as the Spare Tyre Nebula, and a group of four interacting galaxies known as the Grus Quartet.|$|E
5|$|The Milky Way covers {{much of the}} constellation's area. Of the <b>deep-sky</b> <b>objects</b> in Apus, {{there are}} two {{prominent}} globular clusters—NGC 6101 and IC 4499—and a large faint nebula that covers several degrees east of Beta and Gamma Apodis. NGC 6101 is a globular cluster of apparent magnitude 9.2 located around 50,000 light-years distant from Earth, which is around 160 light-years across. Around 13 billion years old, it contains {{a high concentration of}} massive bright stars known as blue stragglers, thought {{to be the result of}} two stars merging. IC 4499 is a loose globular cluster in the medium-far galactic halo; its apparent magnitude is 10.6.|$|E
5|$|Although Aries came to {{represent}} specifically the ram whose fleece became the Golden Fleece of Ancient Greek mythology, it has represented a ram since late Babylonian times. Before that, {{the stars of}} Aries formed a farmhand. Different cultures have incorporated the stars of Aries into different constellations including twin inspectors in China and a porpoise in the Marshall Islands. Aries is a relatively dim constellation, possessing only four bright stars: Hamal (Alpha Arietis, second magnitude), Sheratan (Beta Arietis, third magnitude), Mesarthim (Gamma Arietis, fourth magnitude), and 41 Arietis (also fourth magnitude). The few <b>deep-sky</b> <b>objects</b> within the constellation are quite faint and include several pairs of interacting galaxies. Several meteor showers appear to radiate from Aries, including the Daytime Arietids and the Epsilon Arietids.|$|E
5000|$|WR 31a is {{surrounded}} by a shell of ionised gas nearly [...] wide. The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has captured a striking image of the nebula, rendering it as a thin blue bubble. In this false colour image, the blue colours represents red visible light (605 nm), while orange-red colours represent near infrared radiation at 814 nm. Some media sources have wrongly claimed this <b>deep-sky</b> <b>object</b> was recently discovered by the HST, but this nebula was originally found by Ellen Dorrit Hoffleit in 1953 and designated as the planetary nebula Hf 39. Other planetary nebula catalogue names include ESO 128-18 and Wray 15-682.|$|R
5|$|There are 37 stars {{brighter}} than apparent magnitude6.5 in the constellation; three are {{brighter than}} magnitude4.5. 46Leonis Minoris, an orange giant of magnitude3.8, is located some 95light-years from Earth. At magnitude4.4, Beta Leonis Minoris is the second-brightest star {{and the only}} one in the constellation with a Bayer designation. It is a binary star, the brighter component of which is an orange giant and the fainter a yellow-white main sequence star. The third-brightest star is 21Leonis Minoris, a rapidly rotating white main-sequence star of average magnitude4.5. The constellation also includes two stars with planetary systems, two pairs of interacting galaxies, and the unique <b>deep-sky</b> <b>object</b> Hanny's Voorwerp.|$|R
5|$|Hale {{had spent}} many {{hundreds}} of hours searching for comets without success, and was tracking known comets from his driveway in New Mexico when he chanced upon Hale–Bopp just after midnight. The comet had an apparent magnitude of 10.5 and lay near the globular cluster M70 in the constellation of Sagittarius. Hale first established {{that there was no}} other <b>deep-sky</b> <b>object</b> near M70, and then consulted a directory of known comets, finding that none were known to be in this area of the sky. Once he had established that the object was moving relative to the background stars, he emailed the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams, the clearing house for astronomical discoveries.|$|R
5|$|Collectively, {{amateur astronomers}} observe {{a variety of}} {{celestial}} objects and phenomena sometimes with equipment that they build themselves. Common targets of amateur astronomers include the Sun, the Moon, planets, stars, comets, meteor showers, {{and a variety of}} <b>deep-sky</b> <b>objects</b> such as star clusters, galaxies, and nebulae. Astronomy clubs are located throughout the world and many have programs to help their members set up and complete observational programs including those to observe all the objects in the Messier (110 objects) or Herschel 400 catalogues of points of interest in the night sky. One branch of amateur astronomy, amateur astrophotography, involves the taking of photos of the night sky. Many amateurs like to specialize in the observation of particular objects, types of objects, or types of events which interest them.|$|E
5|$|Hydrus {{contains}} only faint <b>deep-sky</b> <b>objects.</b> IC 1717 was a deep-sky object {{discovered by the}} Danish astronomer John Louis Emil Dreyer in the late 19th century. The object at the coordinate Dreyer observed is no longer there, {{and is now a}} mystery. It was very likely to have been a faint comet. PGC 6240, known as the White Rose Galaxy, is a giant spiral galaxy surrounded by shells resembling rose petals, located around 345 million light years from the Solar System. Unusually, it has cohorts of globular clusters of three distinct ages suggesting bouts of post-starburst formation following a merger with another galaxy. The constellation also contains a spiral galaxy, NGC 1511, which lies edge on to observers on Earth and is readily viewed in amateur telescopes.|$|E

5|$|Its {{brightest}} star, Alpha Andromedae, is {{a binary}} star that {{has also been}} counted {{as a part of}} Pegasus, while Gamma Andromedae is a colorful binary and a popular target for amateur astronomers. Only marginally dimmer than Alpha, Beta Andromedae is a red giant, its color visible to the naked eye. The constellation's most obvious <b>deep-sky</b> <b>object</b> is the naked-eye Andromeda Galaxy (M31, also called the Great Galaxy of Andromeda), the closest spiral galaxy to the Milky Way and one of the brightest Messier objects. Several fainter galaxies, including M31's companions M110 and M32, as well as the more distant NGC 891, lie within Andromeda. The Blue Snowball Nebula, a planetary nebula, is visible in a telescope as a blue circular object.|$|R
40|$|A {{comparison}} {{of the distribution of}} asteroids discovered in the Palomar-Leiden Survey (PLS) and Uppsala-ESO Survey of Asteroids and Comets (UESAC) allows us to discuss several features of the true distribution of objects in the main belt. A notable {{increase in the number of}} outer main belt asteroids respect to inner ones is found when the size selection effect is removed. A concentration of asteroids with perihelion longitude similar to that of Jupiter is observed, even in the debiased samples. No important difference is found between the distribution of outer and inner belt orbits. There seems to be a correlation of higheccentricity asteroids at perihelion longitude similar to Jupiter's. 1. Introduction There are many ways to search for asteroids and comets: from the serendipitous discovery of a comet while you are observing a <b>deep-sky</b> <b>object</b> to a long-lasting all-sky survey to find every moving object. Searches for asteroids and comets are a field of research where the border lin [...] ...|$|R
25|$|Since the sky area of Gemini is {{directed}} away from the Milky Way, there are comparatively few <b>deep-sky</b> <b>objects</b> of note.|$|E
25|$|Due to its {{location}} on the Milky Way, this constellation contains many <b>deep-sky</b> <b>objects</b> such as the open clusters Messier 6 (the Butterfly Cluster) and Messier 7 (the Ptolemy Cluster), NGC 6231 (by ζ² Sco), and the globular clusters Messier 4 and Messier 80.|$|E
25|$|There is an {{abundance}} of <b>deep-sky</b> <b>objects,</b> with many open clusters, nebulae of various types and supernova remnants found in Cygnus due to its position on the Milky Way. Some open clusters {{can be difficult to}} make out from a rich background of stars.|$|E
40|$|No {{longer are}} heavy, sturdy, {{expensive}} mounts and tripods required to photograph deep space. With today's advances in technology, {{all that is}} required is an entry-DSLR and an entry level GoTo telescope. Here is {{all of the information}} needed to start photographing the night sky without buying expensive tracking mounts. By using multiple short exposures and combining them with mostly ‘freeware’ computer programs, the effect of image rotation can be minimized to a point where it is undetectable in normal astrophotography, even for a <b>deep-sky</b> <b>object</b> such as a galaxy or nebula. All the processes, techniques, and equipment needed to use inexpensive, lightweight altazimuth and equatorial mounts and very short exposures photography to image deep space objects are explained, step-by-step, in full detail, supported by clear, easy to understand graphics and photographs.   Currently available lightweight mounts and tripods are identified and examined from an economic versus capability perspective to help users determine what camera, telescope, and mount is the best fit for them. A similar analysis is presented for entry-level telescopes and mounts sold as bundled packages by the telescope manufacturers. This book lifts the veil of mystery from the creation of deep space photographs and makes astrophotography affordable and accessible to most amateur astronomers...|$|R
50|$|The project {{focuses on}} the issues {{surrounding}} the maintenance and successful operation of a remote-controlled observatory. It is built around a remote-controlled telescope with a 1.3 metre dome and CCD camera located in Bristol, which enables imaging and searches of comets, asteroids, supernovae, <b>deep-sky</b> and planetary <b>objects.</b>|$|R
25|$|Of the <b>deep-sky</b> <b>objects</b> of {{interest}} in Vela is a planetary nebula known as the NGC 3132, nicknamed the 'Eight-Burst Nebula' or 'Southern Ring Nebula' (see accompanying photo). It lies {{on the border of}} the constellation with Antlia. NGC 2899 is an unusual red-hued example. This constellation has 32 more planetary nebulae.|$|E
25|$|Besides these nebulae, {{surveying}} Orion with a {{small telescope}} will reveal a wealth of interesting <b>deep-sky</b> <b>objects,</b> including M43, M78, as well as multiple stars including Iota Orionis and Sigma Orionis. A larger telescope may reveal objects such as Barnard's Loop and the Flame Nebula (NGC 2024), as well as fainter and tighter multiple stars and nebulae.|$|E
25|$|Because {{it is in}} a rich Milky Way star field, Delphinus {{has several}} <b>deep-sky</b> <b>objects.</b> NGC 6891 is a {{planetary}} nebula of magnitude 10.5 and one more notable planetary nebula is NGC 6905 or the Blue Flash nebula. NGC 6934 is a globular cluster of magnitude 9.75. At a distance of about 185,000 light-years, the globular cluster NGC 7006 is extremely remote. It is also fairly dim at magnitude 11.5.|$|E
25|$|Because of its {{position}} {{away from the}} galactic plane, the majority of <b>deep-sky</b> <b>objects</b> in Aquarius are galaxies, globular clusters, and planetary nebulae. Aquarius contains three deep sky objects {{that are in the}} Messier catalog: the globular clusters Messier2, Messier72, and the open cluster Messier73. Two well-known planetary nebulae are also located in Aquarius: the Saturn Nebula (NGC7009), to the southeast of μ Aquarii; and the famous Helix Nebula (NGC7293), southwest of δAquarii.|$|E
25|$|One of the <b>deep-sky</b> <b>objects</b> in Draco is the Cat's Eye Nebula (NGC 6543), a {{planetary}} nebula approximately 3,000 light-years away that {{was discovered by}} English astronomer William Herschel in 1786. It is 9th magnitude and was named for its appearance in the Hubble Space Telescope, though it appears as a fuzzy blue-green disk in an amateur telescope. NGC 6543 has a very complex shape due to gravitational interactions between {{the components of the}} multiple star at its center, the progenitor of the nebula approximately 1,000 years ago. It is located 9.6 arcminutes away from the north ecliptic pole to the west-northwest. It is also related to IC 4677, a nebula that appears as a bar 1.8 arcminutes {{to the west of the}} Cat's Eye nebula. In long-term exposures, IC 4677 appears as a portion of a ring surrounding the planetary nebula.|$|E
500|$|Ursa Minor {{is rather}} devoid of <b>deep-sky</b> <b>objects.</b> The Ursa Minor Dwarf, a dwarf {{spheroidal}} galaxy, {{was discovered by}} Albert George Wilson of the Lowell Observatory in the Palomar Sky Survey in 1955. Its centre is around [...] light-years distant from Earth. In 1999, Kenneth Mighell and Christopher Burke used the Hubble Space Telescope to confirm {{that it had a}} single burst of star formation that lasted around 2 billion years that took place around 14 billion years ago, and that the galaxy was probably as old as the Milky Way itself.|$|E
500|$|Hale first {{spotted the}} comet {{that would come}} to bear his name {{from his home in}} Cloudcroft, New Mexico, where the night sky is {{exceptionally}} dark. Since 1970 Hale had observed over 200 known comets, and on the night of July 22–23, 1995, after finishing his observations of periodic Comet Clark, and while waiting for periodic Comet d'Arrest to become visible above the horizon, he [...] "decided to pass the time by observing some <b>deep-sky</b> <b>objects</b> in Sagittarius", and pointed his Meade DS-16 telescope towards globular cluster M70. He [...] "immediately noticed a fuzzy object in the field" [...] which wasn't present when he had observed that region of the sky two weeks earlier.|$|E
