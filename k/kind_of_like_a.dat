So it is a 1920s vibe, it's black and white, very high fashion—you know, you'll see me very dapper in 1920s, Frank Sinatra-ish. So you'll see the cars from that era, you'll {{definitely}} feel the vibe of the house having that 1920s vibe as well. So it's very different and very intimate, and it's not a lot of dancing—it's more personal.|$|E

The riddle is solved when looking at a company catalog (leaflet) that zooms out showing a clown complete with ruffles and a tall pointed hat and carrying a Fun Ho! sign (Jordan 2015). The clown was most often printed in red, and was even used for company Christmas cards {{once upon a time}} (Jordan 2015). The logo was probably OK from the 1930s through the 1960s, but as an advertising gimmick, the design would probably would not work well with children today.|$|E

This continues the season's focus on the nature of identity and reality, having [...] "payoff to all the reflection on the past" [...] such as Mack's tragic loss of his daughter and Fitz's troubled relationship with his father. Bennet called the pod [...] "very relevant. It's definitely a theme that I think has been kind of hopping around in pop culture at the moment.
