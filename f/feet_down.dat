5|$|Metallica's World Magnetic Tour {{ended in}} Melbourne on November 21, 2010. The band had been touring {{for over two}} years in support of Death Magnetic. To {{accompany}} the final tour dates in Australia and New Zealand, a live, limited edition EP of past performances in Australia called Six <b>Feet</b> <b>Down</b> Under was released. The EP was followed by Six <b>Feet</b> <b>Down</b> Under (Part II), which was released on November 12, 2010. Part 2 contains a further eight songs recorded during the first two Oceanic Legs of the World Magnetic Tour.|$|E
5|$|Investigations {{showed that}} the secret pipe had been active for ten years. A large area of wetland was {{contaminated}} with zinc oxide, lead, cadmium and other pollutants at several times the threshold for a public health hazard. Visible evidence of contamination extended five <b>feet</b> <b>down</b> into the bed of Long Lake on property owned by Chemetco.|$|E
5|$|The {{exhumation}} of Yagan's head eventually proceeded, without Colbung's knowledge, by excavating six <b>feet</b> <b>down</b> {{the side}} of the grave, then tunnelling horizontally to the location of the box. Thus the exhumation was performed without disturbing any other remains. The following day, a forensic palaeontologist from the University of Bradford positively identified the skull as Yagan's by correlating the fractures with those described in Pettigrew's report. The skull was then kept at the museum until 29 August, when it was handed over to the Liverpool City Council.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the {{discovery}} of Titanics wreck, in addition to the common assumption that she had sunk in one piece, it had been widely believed that conditions at 12,000 <b>feet</b> <b>down</b> would preserve the ship virtually intact. The water is bitterly cold at only about , there is no light and the high pressure was thought to be likely to lower oxygen and salinity levels to the point that organisms {{would not be able to}} gain a foothold on the wreck. Titanic would effectively be in a deep freeze. The reality has turned out to be very different, and the ship has increasingly deteriorated since she sank in April 1912. Her gradual decay is due to a number of different processes– physical, chemical and biological. She is situated on an undulating, gently sloping area of seabed in Titanic Canyon which is swept by the Western Boundary Current. Eddies from the current flow constantly across the wreck, scouring the sea bed and keeping sediment from building up over the hull. The current is strong and often changeable, gradually opening up holes in the ship's hull. Salt corrosion eats away at the hull and it is also affected by galvanic corrosion.|$|E

25|$|The {{earthquake}} {{caused the}} sand under Port Royal to liquefy and flow out into Kingston Harbour. The water table was generally only two <b>feet</b> <b>down</b> before the impact, {{and the town}} was built on a layer of some 65 feet of water-saturated sand. This type of area did not provide a solid foundation {{on which to build}} an entire town. Unlike the Spanish before them, the English had decided to settle and develop the small area of land, even while acknowledging that the area was nothing but “hot loose sand”.|$|E

25|$|Additional {{testimony}} {{indicated that}} Detective Scott inquired of a railroad engineer named Rush, where {{would be the}} worst place for a train wreck. Rush pointed out the high bridge where, if a rail was pulled, the train would crash three or four hundred <b>feet</b> <b>down</b> an embankment, killing or injuring all on the train. Scott told Rush {{to be on the lookout}} for damaged track that night at that spot. Later that evening Rush stopped his train, walked ahead on the track and discovered that spikes had been pulled.|$|E
25|$|The wharf {{extended}} {{nearly a}} half mile into the bay. It was between 15 and 20 feet wide and came straight in over the mud and gravel beach at a height of 6 to 10 feet. At the wharf entrance, John Landers was talking with another man. About 60 <b>feet</b> <b>down</b> the wharf against the west railing, Josias Tanner and Jesse Murphy stood near each other. Frank Reid stood further on, alone. Their job was to identify Soap Gang members and prevent them from entering the meeting then in progress.|$|E
25|$|One SEAL, {{unaware of}} Coffey's plan at the time, helps {{to locate the}} warhead, stopped on a ledge several {{thousand}} <b>feet</b> <b>down</b> the trench. Bud volunteers to use an experimental diving suit equipped with a liquid breathing apparatus to survive to that depth, though he will {{only be able to}} communicate through a keypad on the suit. Bud begins his dive, assisted by Lindsey's voice keeping him coherent against the effects of the mounting pressure, and reaches the warhead. The SEAL guides him in successfully disarming it. With nearly no oxygen left in the system, Bud types out that he knew this was a one-way trip, and tells Lindsey he loves her. As he waits for death, an NTI approaches Bud and takes his hand. He is guided to an alien ship deeper in the trench. Deep inside, the NTI creates an atmospheric pocket for Bud, allowing him to breathe normally. The NTI plays back Bud's message to his wife, and the two look at each other with understanding.|$|E

Sasha Fierce), Kanye West (808s & Heartbreak), and Guns N' Roses (Chinese Democracy) had already set release dates, the only one available was six weeks later than expected. The album was made available for streaming on December 8. It was soon announced that a new release date for Folie was December 16, 2008. Although December 16 was not an ideal date according to demographic marketing analysis, Stump said [...] "we put our eight <b>feet</b> <b>down</b> [...] told our label it must come out this year." ...|$|E
500|$|Rogers and his {{decimated}} company {{returned to}} Fort Edward on March 15. [...] Rogers himself was originally {{reported by the}} French to have been killed, but had actually survived. The report stemmed from the manner of Rogers’ escape during which he discarded some of his belongings, including his regimental coat, which contained his military commission. This episode also {{gave rise to a}} local legend that Rogers escaped the battle by sliding 400 <b>feet</b> <b>down</b> the side of a hill to the frozen surface of Lake George. [...] While there is no proof of this event, the rockface he supposedly went down very quickly became known as Rogers' Slide.|$|E
500|$|On 13 August 1997, amateur divers {{discovered}} Carol Park's body, clad {{only in a}} nightdress, 75 <b>feet</b> <b>down</b> at {{the bottom}} of Coniston Water. She was nicknamed [...] "the Lady in the Lake" [...] by detectives after the 1943 detective novel by Raymond Chandler, The Lady in the Lake. The body had been wrapped in a pinafore dress, a canvas rucksack and plastic bags, tied with several knots, and weighed down with lead piping. Her eyes had been covered by plasters. It was later reported that the body had landed on an underwater ledge, and had it been thrown into the water a few metres farther from the land, it would probably never have been found.|$|E

500|$|After {{the shoot}} at Fox Baja Studios wrapped, Harlin insisted the team go to The Bahamas to shoot with real sharks. Recounting his {{experience}} there, actor Thomas Jane, who played shark wrangler Carter, said, [...] "The first day, I {{was in a}} cage, but the next day, they swam me 30 <b>feet</b> <b>down...</b> Then this guy yanks the breather off me and the water's churning with blood and guts and stuff... It was so terrifying that I don't want to remember it." [...] The idea was to mix footage of real sharks with animatronic and computer generated sharks to ensure a seamless transition between them all. To distinguish Deep Blue Sea from Jaws, where the shark is frequently hidden, Harlin decided to show theirs more prominently because he felt that audience expectations had changed since then.|$|E
500|$|The Valdez Marine Terminal, the {{southern}} end of the pipeline, was planned for a site across the Port Valdez fjord from Valdez proper. Initial studies predicted bedrock would be six feet below the surface of the ground, but when excavation began, it was discovered that bedrock actually was sixty <b>feet</b> <b>down,</b> requiring the removal of [...] of overburden. The terminal itself was designed to be built with four tanker berths and space for a fifth, should it become necessary. Holding tanks were planned that had a capacity equal to that of the pipeline, allowing the whole pipeline to be emptied if required. As required by the Pipeline Authorization Act, a ballast-water filtration system had to be designed as well. This system removes oil from tankers' ballast water so it is not released into Prince William Sound—something fishermen feared when the pipeline was proposed.|$|E
500|$|His humor {{caused him}} trouble {{during his time}} in Washington. He was known to greet {{citizens}} walking by his office on the White House tour by saying to them, [...] "If you look on me as a wild animal, be kind enough to throw peanuts at me". This prompted Wilson to move Marshall's office to the Senate Office building, where {{he would not be}} disturbed by visitors. In response to a proposal to the board of the Smithsonian Institution to send a team to excavate for ruins in Guatemala, Marshall suggested that the team instead excavate around Washington. When asked why, he replied that, judging by the looks of the people walking on the street, {{they should be able to}} find buried cave-men no more than six <b>feet</b> <b>down.</b> The joke was not well received, and he was shut out of board meetings for nearly a year.|$|E

500|$|To promote The Slim Shady LP, Eminem {{embarked}} on an extensive tour schedule. [...] He joined the Vans Warped Tour as a last-minute replacement for Cypress Hill, a schedule that included 31 North American dates from June 25 to July 31, beginning in San Antonio and ending in Miami. He often played a show in the afternoon on the Warped Tour, and then drove to another location to perform at a hip hop club at night. During a performance in Hartford, Connecticut {{near the end of}} the Warped Tour, Eminem slipped on a puddle of liquid and fell ten <b>feet</b> <b>down</b> off the stage, cracking several ribs. He recalled that the stress of his newfound fame led him to drink excessively, and reflected, [...] "I knew I had to slow it down. The fall was like a reminder." [...] However, after receiving medical attention, he was well enough to travel to New York the following day for a performance on Total Request Live.|$|E

[...] "Eye of the Beholder" [...] has not been played live since 1989; one such performance appears on Metallica's live extended play, Six <b>Feet</b> <b>Down</b> Under. During the World Magnetic Tour in 2009, [...] "The Shortest Straw" [...] made its way back into the setlist after a 12-year absence, and has been sporadically performed since. [...] "The Frayed Ends of Sanity" [...] debuted live in Helsinki on the Metallica By Request tour in 2014, although the band had previously played segments during solos, impromptu jams, or in a [...] "Justice" [...] medley. [...] "To Live Is to Die" [...] premiered at the band's 30th-anniversary concert at The Fillmore in San Francisco.

500|$|Filming {{first took}} place at the Sangre de Cristo Mountains of the Santa Fe National Forest. Eight days were spent on {{mountains}} ranging from [...] In recreating the Hindu Kush mountain range that stretches between Afghanistan and Pakistan, the film crew shot at 10 separate locations in the national forest. Stunt coordinator and second unit director Kevin Scott was tasked with depicting the four Navy SEALs tumbling down rugged terrain with sixty-degree inclines. Scott did not choreograph the stunt work, nor did he have the stunt performers use wires or dummies; he told them to fall [...] off cliffs and avoid looking at the ground until right before impact. [...] "We had to say, ‘Jump off the rock, land however you land, and go with it,’" [...] he said. [...] "When you’re doing that on a true hillside, you don’t have a choice. Gravity takes over. The only thing stopping the stunt people from dropping another thousand <b>feet</b> <b>down</b> the hillside was padding set up just outside of the shot." [...] Several stunt performers were injured after falling from the mountains, as the falls proved too difficult to control. Berg recalled, [...] "Some guys got hurt, some guys got bumped up and ribs were broken, a lung was punctured, some concussions, but these guys were determined to try and do everything they could to capture what Marcus described in the book."
