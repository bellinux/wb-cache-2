5|$|Although the BBC has {{invested}} in the reconstruction of episodes using animation, it has never attempted to <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> the way of complete re-staging of missing episodes; the closest that {{it has come to}} this was the recreation of parts of various serials, including the completely missing Marco Polo, in the docudrama An Adventure in Space and Time produced for the 50th anniversary in 2013. However, in 2012 a reimagined version of The Power of the Daleks, written by, directed by, and starring Nick Scovell, was released on YouTube in three parts before it was shown complete at the Power:Reimagined convention in September 2012.|$|E

Jens Stoltenberg, leader of the Labour Party, was negative towards {{the idea of having}} any representatives from the Red Electoral Alliance in parliament, saying that the voters should <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> their power to stop them from earning a seat in parliament. When the votes were counted Folkvord did not gain a seat in parliament.|$|E

5|$|Alongside his {{theatrical}} career, Barrowman {{has appeared}} in various films including the musical biopic De-Lovely (2004) and musical comedy The Producers (2005). Before venturing into British television, he featured in the American television dramas Titans and Central Park West but he is better known for his acting and presenting work for the BBC that includes his work for CBBC in its earlier years, his self-produced entertainment programme Tonight's the Night, and his BAFTA Cymru-nominated role of Captain Jack Harkness in the science fiction series Doctor Who and Torchwood. Barrowman has also {{had a number of}} guest roles in television programmes both in the US and the UK. He appeared as a contestant on the first series of celebrity ice skating show Dancing on Ice while his theatrical background allowed him to become a judge on Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical talent shows How Do You Solve a Problem like Maria?, Any Dream Will Do and I'd <b>Do</b> <b>Anything.</b> <b>In</b> 2006, he was voted Stonewall's Entertainer of the Year. Starting in 2013, he hosts the BBC One quiz show Pressure Pad. Barrowman starred in the CW's Arrow and Legends of Tomorrow as Malcolm Merlyn, the show's version of the DC villain Merlyn and one of the two series' main antagonists.|$|E

25|$|Five {{different}} amphetamine-based pharmaceuticals {{are currently}} used in ADHD treatment: racemic amphetamine, dextroamphetamine, lisdexamfetamine, and two mixed enantiomer products (Adderall and Dyanavel XR). Lisdexamfetamine is an inactive prodrug of dextroamphetamine (i.e., lisdexamfetamine itself doesn't <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> the body, but it metabolizes into dextroamphetamine). Adderall is a proprietary mixture of (75%) dextroamphetamine and (25%) levoamphetamine salts, {{which results in}} very mild differences between their effects. Dyanavel XR contains a similar mixture. Adderall begins to work before dextroamphetamine because of levoamphetamine. Levoamphetamine also provides Adderall with a longer clinical effect than dextroamphetamine. Some children with ADHD and comorbid disorders respond well to levoamphetamine.|$|E

25|$|The Golden Hurricane {{followed}} up their loss to UTEP with a poor homecoming performance against SMU on October 31. The first three drives {{of the game}} ended in turnovers and neither offense was able to <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> the first quarter. Backup quarterback Jacob Bower came on in the second to replace a struggling Kinne, who went 2 of 10 for 10 yards and two interceptions. Bower completed a pair of 28-yard passes on his first drive, enabling a 13-yard touchdown run by Charles Opeseyitan with nine minutes {{to go in the}} half. SMU answered with a touchdown of its own, and the teams entered the locker room tied at 7. After the break, the Mustangs scored 13 straight to take a 20–7 lead. Tulsa managed to reduce the deficit to 7 when Bower hit Jacob Collums from 13 yards out, but the extra point was blocked. The Golden Hurricane's next drive ended after Kinne reentered the game for a questionable 4th-and-18 pass attempt which was broken up. SMU was able to turn the mistake into a go-ahead touchdown with under two minutes remaining to seal the win.|$|E
25|$|After four seasons, Ullman {{decided to}} end the show in May 1990. In 1991, she {{filed a lawsuit against}} Twentieth Century Fox in Los Angeles Superior Court over profits from the later half-hour {{incarnation}} of The Simpsons. She wanted a share of The Simpsons merchandising and gross profits and believed she was entitled to $2.5 million of the estimated $50 million Fox made in 1992. The Fox network had paid her $58,000 in royalties for The Simpsons as well as $3 million for the 3½ seasons her show was on the air. According to an article, as Ullman had continued her professional relationship with former producer Brooks, only the studio and not Brooks was named in the suit. Brooks was allowed to videotape his testimony as he {{was in the middle of}} filming I'll <b>Do</b> <b>Anything,</b> <b>in</b> which Ullman appeared. The suit was ultimately dismissed. Ullman wasn't the only one to file a lawsuit; Tracey Ullman Show executive producer Ken Estin filed a similar suit against Fox claiming that his contract called for him to receive 7.5% of revenues from The Simpsons, including a portion of merchandise. Despite losing the 1992 suit, Ullman continues to get an annual share of the show's profits.|$|E

The riot scene {{in front of the}} college was filmed with 100 extras; Cook's petrol-bombing of the car was described by costume assistant Ros Marshall as [...] "probably the most hi-tech special effect we've had while filming Skins". The students' college common room was filmed in the show's production canteen. Originally, an entire scene was supposed to be filmed with Naomi and Emily in the lake, but the water was so cold that the actors were unable to stay in the water, and Kathryn Prescott was taken to a standby ambulance with suspected hypothermia. Director Simon Massey choreographed Naomi and Emily's sex scene prior to filming so that, on the set, the actions would come instinctively to the actors and {{they would be able to}} complete the scene in a limited number of takes. While Lily Loveless enjoyed filming those scenes because [...] "stuff like that gives you experience", Prescott said that it concerned her, though she said that she was not pressured to <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> the script that made her uncomfortable.|$|E
500|$|From 1991 to 1994, {{alongside}} The Simpsons, Smith {{was one of}} {{the lead}} cast members in the sitcom Herman's Head as Louise. Her other television roles include recurring appearances as Marlene on Dharma & Greg, and Penny in two episodes of Dead Like Me. Smith has also appeared in Phil of the Future and Teen Angel. Her one-scene role as pregnant checkout girl Nancy in 1991's City Slickers earned her [...] "more attention than all [...] previous roles combined", and taught her [...] "that it's far better to have small parts in big movies that everyone sees." [...] In 1997, she appeared as Lulu the palm reader in the independent film Just Write. Her other roles include parts in Barry Levinson's Toys and James L. Brooks' As Good as It Gets. Brooks, who is also executive producer of The Simpsons, had cast Smith in his 1994 film I'll <b>Do</b> <b>Anything</b> (<b>in</b> one of the film's musical numbers), but her part was cut. Aside from The Simpsons, Smith has recorded few voice-over parts, only commercials and the film We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story. She [...] "had a voice-over agent for about two years, and I used to go out [...] all the time, but it never really came to anything.
