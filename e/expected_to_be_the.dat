In his State of Origin debut, Hunt ran with the ball seventeen times, making 196 metres.

5|$|Alarmed by {{the raids}} on St Nazaire and Dieppe in 1942, Hitler {{had ordered the}} {{construction}} of fortifications all along the Atlantic coast, from Spain to Norway, to protect against an expected Allied invasion. He envisioned 15,000 emplacements manned by 300,000 troops, but shortages, particularly of concrete and manpower, meant {{that most of the}} strongpoints were never built. As it was <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> site of the invasion, the Pas de Calais was heavily defended. In the Normandy area, the best fortifications were concentrated at the port facilities at Cherbourg and Saint-Malo. Rommel was assigned to oversee the construction of further fortifications along the expected invasion front, which stretched from the Netherlands to Cherbourg, and was given command of the newly re-formed Army Group B, which included the 7th Army, the 15th Army, and the forces guarding the Netherlands. Reserves for this group included the 2nd, 21st, and 116th Panzer divisions.|$|E

5|$|An {{example of}} Khalid's {{strategic}} maneuverability was his advance into Roman Syria.

Catching the Byzantines off guard, he quickly captured several towns, virtually cutting off the communications of the Byzantine army at Ajnadayn with its high command at Emesa, where emperor Heraclius himself resided.|$|E
5|$|Army Group South's Donets Campaign {{had cost}} the Red Army some 70,000–80,000 {{personnel}} casualties.

Between April and July 1943, the Red Army took its time to rebuild its forces {{in the area and}} prepare for an eventual renewal of the German offensive, known as the Battle of Kursk. Overall German casualties are more difficult to come by but clues are provided by examining the casualties of the SS Panzer Corps, taking into consideration that the Waffen-SS divisions were frequently deployed where the fighting was <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> harshest.

5|$|In July 2008, {{speculation}} {{began on}} what Hunt would do past the expiration {{of his contract}} {{at the end of}} the 2009 season. With some high-profile defections of star league players to cashed-up rugby union clubs from France, Hunt is <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> target of offers from overseas and within Australia. Australian rugby union club Queensland Reds stated their intentions to attempt to lure Hunt to the rugby union code, with the reasoning being his successful young career in rugby union. From within the NRL competition, Sydney based clubs Sydney Roosters and St. George Illawarra Dragons stated their intentions to make a bid for Hunt for his services in the 2010 season, claiming they could double Hunt's three-year deal from 2006, reported to be around $200,000. The Broncos however, were still expected to be a factor in his decision with the possibility of the captaincy a possible lure to remain with the Broncos.|$|E
5|$|In March 2012, the U.S. Senate {{added an}} {{amendment}} to the surface transportation bill that authorized a one-year extension to the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act. Oregon counties would have received a total of $102 million from the legislation in 2012, to be divided among all 33 counties that currently receive payments. In 2008, Oregon received $250 million from the program. The full transportation bill, including the amendment, passed the Senate by a 74–22 vote, but the U.S. House of Representatives refused to vote on the Senate bill, instead passing a three-month extension to the current transportation bill that did not contain a county payments extension. In July 2012, the Secure Rural Schools Act renewal amendment was included in the transportation bill approved by Congress and signed by the President. This was widely <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> last renewal of the program, but in September 2013, Congress passed another one-year extension to the program, though again at reduced levels.|$|E

Going into the 1958 season, the Lions looked to continue their success, and Johnson was <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> team's primary ball carrier.

5|$|NuScale is <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> first SMR to market, {{because its}} cooling {{is similar to}} the systems used in {{conventional}} power plants. However, alternative cooling systems using molten metals are expected to operate at higher, more efficient temperatures once approved. The company estimates a twelve-unit NuScale plant would cost $5,000 per kilowatt. In comparison, the Energy Information Administration in 2011 estimated costs to be $4,700 per kilowatt for conventional nuclear power, $4,600 for a carbon sequestration coal plant and $931 at a gas-fired plant or in excess of $1,800 for a gas-fired plant with carbon sequestration. David Mohre, executive director of NRECA's Energy and Power Division, said SMR's like NuScale's are ideal for rural towns that need small power plants and {{do not have access to}} natural gas. NuScale power plants are also expected to take less time, materials and space to construct than other power sources and can be expanded incrementally to meet changing power needs.|$|E
