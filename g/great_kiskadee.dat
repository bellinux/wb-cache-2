500|$|Many birds {{migrate to}} the area around Aransas Bay, most notably to the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge. Year-round {{residents}} include least grebe, brown pelican, neotropic cormorant, white-faced ibis, roseate spoonbill, black-bellied whistling-duck, mottled duck, white-tailed hawk, crested caracara, pauraque, golden-fronted woodpecker, <b>great</b> <b>kiskadee,</b> green jay, long-billed thrasher, olive sparrow, seaside sparrow, and bronzed cowbird. [...] The endangered whooping crane has also been spotted near the bay. Despite {{the fact that there}} were only 15 in 1900, over 180 are found in the wild today. The whooping crane's and other birds' survival depends on the availability of blue crab. Thousands of crab traps have been removed to preserve the population.|$|E
2500|$|Birds include toucans, {{black-necked aracari}} (Pteroglossus aracari), hummingbirds, Amazon {{kingfisher}} (Chloroceryle amazona), collared puffbird (Bucco capensis), <b>great</b> <b>kiskadee</b> (Pitangus sulphuratus), cream-colored woodpecker (Celeus flavus), neotropic [...] cormorant (Phalacrocorax brasilianus), anhinga (Anhinga anhinga), bananaquit (Coereba flaveola), plain parakeet (Brotogeris tirica), great egret (Ardea alba), barn owl (Tyto alba), laughing falcon (Herpetotheres cachinnans), bat falcon (Falco rufigularis), southern lapwing (Vanellus chilensis), pauraque (Nyctidromus albicollis), wattled jacana (Jacana jacana), chestnut-bellied seed finch (Oryzoborus angolensis) and tropical screech owl (Megascops choliba).|$|E

50|$|Valley Nature Center {{has been}} in {{operation}} as a non-profit organization since 1984 and a new building was opened in 2014. Formed from a vacant lot, the site now includes a 1 mile trail through a cactus garden, bog ponds, and butterfly garden. Animals that have been seen include green jays, <b>great</b> <b>kiskadees,</b> buff-bellied hummingbird, Texas tortoise and Texas horned lizard. The park is considered a good site to view migrating birds and butterflies.|$|R
50|$|Over 100 {{species of}} birds {{can be found in}} Flores. For example, rufous horneros, with their oven-like nests, can be seen sitting atop fence posts. Huge colonies of green parrots' nests hang high in the tall eucalyptus. Southern lapwings, locally known as teros, {{burrowing}} owls, and elegant-crested tinamou nest in open fields while long wing harriers, gray eagles, and hawks soar high above. Some of the largest <b>great</b> <b>kiskadees</b> are extremely common as are the guira, a type of cuckoo. Along quiet country lanes giant wood rails, pink spoonbills and kingfishers can be seen, alongside flocks of ibis and white egrets in the pastures. Red headed cardinals, both orange throated and red necked woodpeckers, and scissor-tailed nightjars {{can be seen in the}} small stands of trees that dot the countryside. Long, split tailed flycatchers zip above the rich grass around twilight. Glittering-bellied emerald hummingbirds drink from the tall purple flowers that carpet the fields from Spring until Fall.|$|R
40|$|Ospreys (Pandion haliaetus) winter {{throughout}} the country of Colombia. Recoveries of banded Ospreys indicate that many are shot {{in the country with}} the number increasing since the 1970 s. The increased incidence of shooting has coincided with the development of aquaculture facilities in Colom- bia that raise tilapia (Oreochromis spp.). Because these facilities typically lose production to birds such as Ospreys that depredate fish, we conducted a survey of 83 facilities in three states or departments in Colombia in 2001 to determine the species of birds that take fish at aquaculture facilities and the numbers that are killed each year. Our results showed that bird depredation occurs at aquaculture facilities {{throughout the}} country, but mostly in the southern portion of the country in the department of Huila. Facility managers reported shooting Ospreys in all three departments with as few as five individuals shot annually in Antioquia in northern Colombia to as many as 270 shot annually in Huila. In addition, facility managers reported shooting nine other species of birds including Green Kingfishers (Chloroceryle americana), <b>Great</b> <b>Kiskadees</b> (Pitangus sulphuratus), Snowy Egrets (Egretta thula), Great Egrets (Casmerodius allms), Olivaceous Cormorants (Phalacrocorax olivaceus), Black-crowned Night-Herons (Nyc- ticorax nycticorax), White-necked Herons (Ardea cocoi), Cattle Egrets (Bubulcus ibis), and Striated Herons (Butorides striatus), for a total estimate of 3 Ì†e 9000 birds shot in the three departments annually. A number of alternative methods to shooting had been used to reduce losses to birds including the installation of netting, overhead wires, scarecrows, and noise making devices, but, neither these methods nor shooting, were effective in deterring avian predators...|$|R

50|$|There {{were few}} species of land animal in Bermuda {{before the arrival}} of humans. The only {{vertebrate}} species was the Bermuda skink, or rock lizard (Eumeces longirostris). These were quite numerous, but have become rare due to predation by introduced species, and, especially, the introduction of glass bottles, in which they easily become trapped. Unlike the introduced anoles, their feet are unable to adhere to glass. Their range had been largely reduced to small islands of Castle Harbour, but they have re-colonised the mainland, and their numbers are increasing. The only other large land animals found on the island were crustaceans, notably two species of land crab, including the rare giant land crab (Cardisoma quantami). Insects included the endemic, ground-burrowing solitary bee, which has not been observed for several decades and is believed extinct. The native cicada also became extinct with the loss of the juniper forest. Other native insects survive, including the migratory monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus), which has become threatened due to the loss of milkweed, which has been eradicated as a weed. The most numerous animals were, and are, birds. Several native species are related to North American species, including the eastern bluebird (Sialia sialis), and the white-eyed vireo (Vireo griseus bermudianus). Both of these were common, but have suffered from loss of habitat, from competition for nest sites with introduced house sparrows (Passer domesticus), and nest-predation by European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) and <b>great</b> <b>kiskadees</b> (Pitangus sulphuratus) - this last species was deliberately introduced as late as 1957, with the intent that it would control the previously introduced anoles. Other native birds, including the gray catbird, have suffered from the same causes. The most famous Bermudian bird is the endemic Bermuda petrel (Pterodroma cahow), or cahow. This is a pelagic seabird which had dug burrows for its nests. Humans are believed to have killed millions of them after settlement began in 1609, and feral pigs, introduced presumably by Spaniards decades before, also attacked their nests. Before the 17th century was over, the cahow was believed to be extinct. After sightings of the bird at sea, a young Bermudian, David B. Wingate, theorised cahows might still be nesting on rocky islets of Castle Harbour. He visited these islets with ornithologists Robert Cushman Murphy and Louis S. Mowbray in 1951 and discovered a handful of nesting pairs. Under Wingate's supervision, a conservation programme has steadily increased the cahow's numbers. Species that arrived by natural dispersion and become native after human settlement include the barn owl (Tyto alba), and the mourning dove (Zenaida macroura).|$|R
5000|$|This {{alert and}} {{aggressive}} bird {{has a strong}} and maneuverable flight, which it uses to good effect when it feels annoyed by raptors. Even much larger birds are attacked by the <b>great</b> <b>kiskadee,</b> usually by diving down or zooming straight at them while they are in mid-air. Harsh calls are also often given during these attacks, alerting all potential prey {{in the area of}} the predator's presence. If not very hungry, any raptor subject to a great kiskadee's mobbing behavior is likely to leave, as it is well-nigh impossible to make a good catch when subject to the tyrant flycatcher's unwelcome attention. In general, avian predators are liable to steer clear of an alert <b>great</b> <b>kiskadee,</b> lest their hunting success be spoiled, and will hunt the <b>great</b> <b>kiskadee</b> itself [...] - [...] though it is as meaty as a fat thrush [...] - [...] only opportunistically.|$|E
50|$|The <b>great</b> <b>kiskadee</b> (Pitangus sulphuratus) is a {{passerine}} bird. It {{is a large}} tyrant flycatcher; sometimes its genus Pitangus {{is considered}} monotypic, with the lesser kiskadee (P. lictor) separated in Philohydor.|$|E

50|$|This is a {{conspicuous}} species, with a trilled threeee call, or a sharp weet. There are, however, some geographical variations in its voice. It will defend the nest aggressively against species {{as large as}} a <b>great</b> <b>kiskadee.</b>|$|E
50|$|The massive black bill, {{which gives}} this species its English and generic names, {{is the best}} {{distinction}} from the similar <b>great</b> <b>kiskadee,</b> which also has more rufous tail and wings, and lacks the olive tone to the upperparts. The call is a strident trilled nya, nya, nya.|$|E
50|$|Not being {{appreciated}} as a songbird, the <b>great</b> <b>kiskadee</b> is {{not usually}} kept caged and therefore has escaped the depredations of poaching for the pet trade. Also, its feeding mostly on live prey makes it extremely difficult to keep in captivity. It is not considered threatened by the IUCN.|$|E
50|$|The fauna is {{represented}} by: spectacled bears, jaguars, (both endangered species), armadillos, parrots, opossums, howler monkeys, deer, ocelots, pumas and southern tamandua. There are birds like the crested curassow, hummingbird, <b>great</b> <b>kiskadee</b> and cardinal. One {{of the largest}} species of moth {{in the world can}} be found: the thysania agrippina, with wingspan of 30.5 cm.|$|E
50|$|On Bermuda however, gray catbirds {{were once}} very common, but their {{numbers have been}} greatly reduced {{in recent years by}} {{deforestation}} and nest predation by introduced species (including the <b>great</b> <b>kiskadee</b> Pitangus sulphuratus and the European starling Sturnus vulgaris). In the United States, this species receives special legal protections under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918.|$|E
50|$|Of the {{introduced}} birds, the European starling, house sparrow, <b>great</b> <b>kiskadee,</b> rock dove, American crow {{and chicken}} {{are all very}} numerous and considered to be pests.

Many other species of bird also nest over marsh waters during the wet season, including the ubiquitous <b>great</b> <b>kiskadee</b> and the peculiar greater ani, which builds its communal nests in tangled vegetation over water.|$|E
50|$|The {{tree was}} {{introduced}} to Florida in 1911 by the USDA, and is also now commonly grown in Suriname, Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago. In Brazil, where it was introduced from India during Portuguese colonization, it has dispersed spontaneously in the wild in some places, as its fruits are eagerly sought by various native birds such as thrushes, tanagers and the <b>great</b> <b>kiskadee.</b> This species is considered an invasive in Hawaii.|$|E
50|$|Birds include toucans, {{black-necked aracari}} (Pteroglossus aracari), hummingbirds, Amazon {{kingfisher}} (Chloroceryle amazona), collared puffbird (Bucco capensis), <b>great</b> <b>kiskadee</b> (Pitangus sulphuratus), cream-colored woodpecker (Celeus flavus), neotropic cormorant (Phalacrocorax brasilianus), anhinga (Anhinga anhinga), bananaquit (Coereba flaveola), plain parakeet (Brotogeris tirica), great egret (Ardea alba), barn owl (Tyto alba), laughing falcon (Herpetotheres cachinnans), bat falcon (Falco rufigularis), southern lapwing (Vanellus chilensis), pauraque (Nyctidromus albicollis), wattled jacana (Jacana jacana), chestnut-bellied seed finch (Oryzoborus angolensis) and tropical screech owl (Megascops choliba).|$|E
5000|$|To {{mammalian}} and squamate predators {{that can}} sneak up to nesting or sleeping birds, {{it is more}} vulnerable however.

50|$|The fertile {{coastal plain}} and lush jungle of the foothills and {{mountains}} of the Sierra Madre Occidental support {{a wide variety}} of fauna, including over 400 bird species, and a rich diversity of mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and other animal species. Some of the significant birds include the Amazon Parrot, Tropical Kingbird, <b>Great</b> <b>Kiskadee,</b> Hooded Oriole, and the Blue-footed Booby. Mammals include an incredibly wide range of 'big cats' such as Ocelot, Margay, Jaguar, Jaguarundi and Puma along with deer, wild boar, coati mundi, skunk, badger, coyote, wild rabbit, armadillo, various snakes, lizards, and frogs.|$|E
50|$|The adult Myiozetetes flycatchers are c. 16-18 cm {{long and}} weigh 24-30 g. The upperparts are olive-brown, and {{the wings and}} tail are brown with only faint rufous fringes. The underparts are yellow and the throat is white. Young birds lack the red-orange crown stripe of the adult, and have {{chestnut}} fringes to the wing and tail feathers. The best distinction between the species is the head pattern: Vermilion-crowned, social and rusty-margined flycatchers have strong black-and white head markings like the <b>great</b> <b>kiskadee,</b> whereas grey-capped and dusky-chested flycatchers have greyish heads, with a short weak eyestripe in the former.|$|E
50|$|In appearance, {{the social}} flycatcher resembles a smaller boat-billed flycatcher or <b>great</b> <b>kiskadee.</b> The adult is 16 - 18 cm long and weighs 24 - 27 g. The head is dark grey {{with a strong}} white eyestripe and a usually {{concealed}} orange to vermilion crown stripe. The upperparts are olive-brown, and the wings and tail are brown with only faint rufous fringes. The underparts are yellow and the throat is white. Young birds have a paler eye mask, reduced crown stripe, and have chestnut fringes to the wing and tail feathers. The call is a sharp peeurrr and the dawn song is a chips-kâ€™-cheery.|$|E
5000|$|Many birds {{migrate to}} the area around Aransas Bay, most notably to the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge. Year-round {{residents}} include least grebe, brown pelican, neotropic cormorant, white-faced ibis, roseate spoonbill, black-bellied whistling-duck, mottled duck, white-tailed hawk, crested caracara, pauraque, golden-fronted woodpecker, <b>great</b> <b>kiskadee,</b> green jay, long-billed thrasher, olive sparrow, seaside sparrow, and bronzed cowbird. [...] The endangered whooping crane has also been spotted near the bay. Despite {{the fact that there}} were only 15 in 1900, over 180 are found in the wild today. The whooping crane's and other birds' survival depends on the availability of blue crab. Thousands of crab traps have been removed to preserve the population.|$|E
50|$|The adult <b>great</b> <b>kiskadee</b> {{is one of}} {{the largest}} of the tyrant flycatchers. It can measure from 21 to 27 cm in length and weigh 52 to 68 g. The head is black with a strong white eyestripe and a {{concealed}} yellow crown stripe. The upperparts are brown, and the wings and tail are brown with usually strong rufous fringes. The bill is short, thick, and black in color. The similar boat-billed flycatcher (Megarynchus pitangua) has a more massive black bill, an olive-brown back and very little rufous in the tail and wings. A few other tyrant flycatchers â€” the social flycatcher (Myiozetetes similis), for example â€” share a similar color pattern, but these species are markedly smaller.|$|E
50|$|The bright {{coloration}} of the <b>great</b> <b>kiskadee</b> {{makes it}} easy to recognize and as noted above, is shared by several other more or less closely related Tyrannidae. It is not known whether this apparent convergent evolution is a case of mimicry, and if so, whether the great kiskadee's pugnaciousness encourages some predators to leave birds with such colors well alone. Given that some Tyrannidae are alleged to taste bad, the color may also be an aposematic warning of noxious chemicals contained in the birds' meat. In a peculiar coincidence, the foxface rabbitfish (Siganus vulpinus) and related species have evolved a strikingly similar coloration and pattern; here it is almost certain that the colors are aposematic, as these fishes use a poisonous sting to defend themselves.|$|E
5000|$|Most, but not all, {{species are}} rather plain, with various hues of brown, gray and white commonplace. Obvious {{exceptions}} include {{the bright red}} vermilion flycatcher, blue, black, white and yellow many-colored rush-tyrant and some species of tody-flycatchers or tyrants, which are often yellow, black, white and/or rufous, from the Todirostrum, Hemitriccus and Poecilotriccus genera. Several species have bright yellow underparts, from the ornate flycatcher to the <b>great</b> <b>kiskadee.</b> Some species have erectile crests. The crest is taken to the extreme in the royal flycatcher, which is plain but for a large black-spotted, red-and-blue crest which it fans out like a peafowl tail when excited. Several of the large genera (i.e. Elaenia, Myiarchus or Empidonax) are quite difficult to tell apart in the field due to similar plumage and some are best distinguished by their voices. Behaviorally they can vary from species such as spadebills which are tiny, shy and live in dense forest interiors to kingbirds, which are relatively large, bold, inquisitive and often inhabit open areas near human habitations. As the name implies, a great majority of tyrant flycatchers are entirely insectivorous (though not necessarily specialized in flies). Tyrant flycatchers are largely opportunistic feeders and often catch any flying or arboreal insect they encounter. However, food can vary greatly and some (like the large <b>great</b> <b>kiskadee)</b> will eat fruit or small vertebrates (e.g. small frogs). In North America, most species {{are associated with a}} [...] "sallying" [...] feeding style, where they fly up to catch an insect directly from their perch and then immediately return to the same perch. Most tropical species however do not feed in this fashion and several types prefer to glean insects from leaves and bark. Tropical species are sometimes found in mixed-species foraging flocks, where various types of passerines and other smallish birds are found feeding in proximity.|$|E
50|$|The <b>great</b> <b>kiskadee</b> is a common, {{noisy and}} {{conspicuous}} bird. It is almost omnivorous, and hunts like a shrike or flycatcher, waiting {{on an open}} perch high in a tree to sally out to catch insects in flight, or to pounce upon rodents and similar small vertebrates. It will also take prey and some fruit from vegetation by gleaning and jumping for it or ripping it off in mid-hover, and occasionally dives for fish or tadpoles in shallow water, {{making it one of}} the few fishing passerines. They like to hunt on their own or in pairs, and though they might be expected to make good use of prey flushed by but too large for the smaller birds of the understory, they do not seem to join mixed-species feeding flocks very often. When they do, they hunt in the familiar manner. Such opportunistic feeding behavior makes it one of the commonest birds in urban areas around Latin America; its flashy belly and its shrill call make it one of the most conspicuous.|$|E
40|$|The {{observation}} of parents feeding a captive fledgling of <b>Great</b> <b>Kiskadee</b> revealed that visitation is more frequent {{in the first}} hour after sunrising, with lesscr peaks along the day. The diet supplied consisted mainly of insects (Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, Diptera), along with other items as human-made materiais (food scraps, pellets of animal food), lizards (Hemidactylus mabouia), non-identified fruit pulp, gastropods and arachnids (Opiliones). The ability that P. sulphuratus has for identifying food items absent froni more natural habitats and for exploiting resources of unpredictablc spatial and temporal distributions confers the species a dietary flexibility that probably contributes to its efficiency in colonizing urban habitats...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTanaisia dubia Freitas, 1951 (Digenea: Eucotylidae) is redescribed on {{the basis}} of {{specimens}} collected from the urinary tubules of the White-backed Stilt Himantopus melanurus (Charadriiformes: Recurvirostridae), and the <b>Great</b> <b>Kiskadee</b> Pitangus sulphuratus (Passeriformes: Tyrannidae), from Argentina.
