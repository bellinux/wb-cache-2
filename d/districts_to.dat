5|$|Congressional Districts are reapportioned {{among the}} states {{following}} each decennial Census of Population. Each state then draws single member <b>districts</b> <b>to</b> conform with the census apportionment. The total number of Representatives is 435, and delegate Members of Congress represent the District of Columbia and the five major U.S. territories.|$|E
5|$|IFP {{officials}} stormed an ANC {{office in}} Alexandra and held ANC members hostage after the IFP had realised {{that they had}} lost all previous IFP voting <b>districts</b> <b>to</b> the ANC. The ANC office was situated in a multi-purpose centre along with IEC and IFP offices.|$|E
5|$|MFP {{funding has}} been frozen {{at the same}} rate for two years. In 2010, the Louisiana Legislature moved to restructure the MFP formula. Critics say the formula does not {{encourage}} <b>districts</b> <b>to</b> implement taxes to pay higher amounts than the state for the cost of education.|$|E

5|$|Germany was {{dependent}} on imported oil; a confrontation with Britain over the Czechoslovakian dispute could curtail Germany's oil supplies. This forced Hitler to call off Fall Grün, originally planned for 1 October 1938. On 29 September Hitler, Neville Chamberlain, Édouard Daladier, and Mussolini attended a one-day conference in Munich {{that led to the}} Munich Agreement, which handed over the Sudetenland <b>districts</b> <b>to</b> Germany.|$|E

5|$|In 1917, landowners {{along the}} slough had formed three {{drainage}} <b>districts</b> <b>to</b> control floods. They dug ditches, deepened existing water channels, and built levees {{to keep the}} rivers and the slough from flooding agricultural, industrial, and commercial property. Hoping to flush the slough with clean water from the river, city engineers created the crosscutting Peninsula Canal. The project largely failed because daily tides reversed the slough's flow and because {{both ends of the}} canal were at nearly the same elevation.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, an {{overwhelming}} majority of voters in the TID and MID service areas and San Francisco approved bond issues to finance {{the construction of a new}} dam. The irrigation districts hoped to complete the dam by 1966, but concerns that the dam would further impact decreasing populations of king salmon in the Tuolumne put a temporary stop to the project. In fact, it was not until that year that the Federal Power Commission (now Federal Energy Regulatory Commission) licensed the irrigation <b>districts</b> <b>to</b> go ahead on New Don Pedro.|$|E
5|$|The French Navy and Air Force {{had been}} {{depleted}} during World War II. They {{were unable to}} deal with the unexpectedly large number of refugees. This was exacerbated by their unwillingness to allow civilian evacuees to travel on trains from outlying <b>districts</b> <b>to</b> Hanoi and Haiphong, as their priority was evacuating their military personnel and equipment. France asked Washington for assistance, so the US Department of Defense ordered the US Navy to mobilise an evacuation task force.|$|E

5|$|The initial filming for Mother India began unexpectedly, {{even before}} the script and cast were finalised. In 1955, parts of Uttar Pradesh {{suffered}} from major flooding. Cinematographer Faredoon Irani travelled to flood-afflicted <b>districts</b> <b>to</b> shoot generic flood scenes. The scheduled principal photography started in 1955 with a budget of 20–25 lakh (approximately US$420,000–525,000 in 1957). However, the budget increased to 35–40 lakh (approximately US$735,000–840,000 in 1957) {{by the end of}} the filming because of the outdoor sessions and cast and crew's salaries. This budget, a record at the time, was surpassed by Mughal-e-Azam in 1960.|$|E
5|$|The suit {{called for}} the school {{district}} to reverse its policy of racial segregation. The Topeka Board of Education operated separate elementary schools under an 1879 Kansas law, which permitted (but did not require) <b>districts</b> <b>to</b> maintain separate elementary school facilities for {{black and white students}} in 12 communities with populations over 15,000. The plaintiffs had been recruited by the leadership of the Topeka NAACP. Notable among the Topeka NAACP leaders were the chairman McKinley Burnett; Charles Scott, one of three serving as legal counsel for the chapter; and Lucinda Todd.|$|E
5|$|Between 2006 and 2007, Texas spent $7,275 {{per pupil}} ranking it below the {{national}} average of $9,389. The pupil/teacher ratio was 14.9, {{below the national}} average of 15.3. Texas paid instructors $41,744, {{below the national average}} of $46,593. The Texas Education Agency (TEA) administers the state's public school systems. Texas has over 1,000 school districts- all districts except the Stafford Municipal School District are independent from municipal government and many cross city boundaries. School districts have the power to tax their residents and to assert eminent domain over privately owned property. Due to court-mandated equitable school financing for school districts, the state has a controversial tax redistribution system called the"Robin Hood plan". This plan transfers property tax revenue from wealthy school <b>districts</b> <b>to</b> poor ones. The TEA has no authority over private or home school activities.|$|E

5|$|From {{the early}} medieval period, New Sleaford {{was in the}} Flaxwell Wapentake and Old Sleaford in the Ashwardhurn Wapentake. Sleaford Poor Law Union, overseen by a Board of Guardians, was {{established}} in 1836. A Local Board of Health was formed in 1851. Public health was reorganised by the Public Health Act 1872, which established Urban and Rural Sanitary Districts (USD or RSD); Sleaford USD covered New and Old Sleaford, Holdingham and Quarrington, while the Sleaford RSD included all other parishes in the Poor Law Union. The Local Government Act 1894 converted the Board of Health and USD into the Sleaford Urban District Council and, in 1899, the town became the administrative base of Kesteven County Council. A rural district formed in 1894 was abolished in 1931. In 1973, Sleaford Urban District merged with the North and East Kesteven <b>districts</b> <b>to</b> form North Kesteven, a district of Lincolnshire; by statutory instrument, Sleaford civil parish became the urban district's successor, thus merging Quarrington, New Sleaford, Old Sleaford and Holdingham civil parishes.|$|E
5|$|Power remains {{relatively}} inexpensive along the Columbia, {{and in recent}} years high-tech companies like Google have begun to move server farm operations into the area to avail themselves of cheap power. Downriver of Grand Coulee, each dam's reservoir is closely regulated by the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and various Washington public utility <b>districts</b> <b>to</b> ensure flow, flood control, and power generation objectives are met. Increasingly, hydro-power operations are required to meet standards under the US Endangered Species Act and other agreements to manage operations to minimize impacts on salmon and other fish, and some conservation and fishing groups support removing four dams on the lower Snake River, the largest tributary of the Columbia.|$|E
5|$|Taylor {{remained}} inactive {{there until}} 1 May 1930, {{when she was}} placed back in commission {{under the command of}} Commander George B. Keester. She was assigned to Destroyer Division 33, Squadron 7, which was part of the Scouting Fleet. During this time, she operated from Charleston, South Carolina, until November when she was placed in reduced commission once again. At the same time, Taylor was detached from the Scouting Fleet and transferred to Destroyer Division 47, Squadron 16 of the Training Squadron. She was assigned to the 6th and 7th Naval <b>Districts</b> <b>to</b> train reservists and to carry Reserve Officer Training Corps midshipmen on summer cruises. By 1 April 1931, Scouting Fleet became Scouting Force, and the destroyer was reassigned as an element of Division 28 of the Training Squadron. She operated with that unit until early in 1934 when she joined Squadron 19 of the rotating reserve with which she remained until late 1931.|$|E

5|$|The firefighters built bashings, {{walls of}} sandbags, turf and sand, {{approximately}} 18feet (5.5metres) deep and 17feet (5.2metres) {{up to the}} tunnel's roof to prevent smoke filling {{the rest of the}} workings and allow men to explore areas previously cut off. Within two days the temperatures dropped and the volume of smoke was reduced. Although the fire was contained, miners still faced several obstacles, including roof collapses and large pockets of trapped firedamp. The first collapse consisted of more than 100 tons of debris, while another fall was more than 300feet (91.5metres) long and 30 to 40feet (10–12metres) high. Clearing the falls and finding bodies was slow, and it took until 8 November for the first of the 4 working <b>districts</b> <b>to</b> be explored and cleared of bodies. Many victims were unidentifiable—either the explosion, fire or subsequent decomposition had taken its toll—and many had to be identified by their personal effects, although some bodies remained unidentified.|$|E
5|$|Under {{a renewed}} {{agreement}} in 1999, {{all but one}} of the St. Louis County districts agreed to continue their participation, albeit with an opt-out clause that allowed <b>districts</b> <b>to</b> reduce the number of incoming transfer students starting in 2002. In addition, districts have been permitted to reduce available seats in the program. Since 1999, districts have reduced availability by five percent annually. A five-year extension of the voluntary transfer program was approved in 2007, and another five-year extension was approved in 2012, allowing new enrollments to take place through the 20182019 school year in participating districts. Critics of the transfer program note that most of the desegregation under the plan is via transfer of black students to the county rather than transfer of white students to the city. Another criticism has been that the program weakens city schools by removing talented students to county schools. Despite these issues, the program will continue until all transfer students reach graduation; with the last group of transfer students allowed to enroll in 20182019, the program will end after the 20302031 school year.|$|E
5|$|Within {{months of}} {{arriving}} in Washington, D.C., Fletcher {{was selected as}} the leadership liaison for the 17-member freshman class of Republican legislators. He was appointed to the Committee on Education and Workforce, and John Boehner, chair of the committee's employer/employee relations subcommittee, chose Fletcher as his vice-chair. The committee's purpose is to oversee the rules for employer-paid health plans, among other issues, and although it is rare for a freshman legislator to attain a committee leadership post, Boehner cited Fletcher's experience in the medical field and work on reforming the Kentucky health care system as reasons for the appointment. Fletcher also served {{as a member of the}} House Committees on the Budget and Agriculture. In June 1999, he sponsored an amendment to a youth violence bill that allowed school <b>districts</b> <b>to</b> use federal funds to develop curricula which included elements designed to promote and enhance students' moral character; the amendment passed 422—1. Later, Fletcher was assigned to the Committee on Energy and Commerce and was selected as chairman of the Policy Subcommittee on Health.|$|E
