50|$|Opening {{day for the}} Aldene Plan was {{announced}} for Monday, May 1, 1967 but a full-service rehearsal occurred the day prior (a Sunday to avoid the commuter rush). The CNJ operated push-pull consists with a cab car leading eastbound. Until 2014, operations remained the same: passengers for New York would disembark at Newark and change to a Northeast Corridor or North Jersey Coast Line train operated by New Jersey Transit to New York Penn Station or PATH trains to the World Trade Center. However, in 2014 NJ Transit began offering a one-seat ride to New York making use of their recently purchased dual mode locomotives, which can change between diesel power and electric power. The trains operate under diesel power on the Raritan Valley Line which has never been electrified. At Newark, the diesel motors are shut down and a pantograph is raised, since only electric trains can operate into New York Penn Station. Currently the <b>dual-mode</b> <b>service</b> is only run during off-peak hours as Penn Station cannot accommodate any more trains during rush hours.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{integration}} of cellular and VoIP over WLAN (VoWLAN) systems recently has attracted considerable in-terest from both academia and industry. A cellular/VoWLAN dual-mode system enables users to access a low-cost VoIP service in a WLAN hotspot and {{switch to a}} wide-area cellular system without WLANs. Unfortunately, cellular/VoWLAN dual-mode mobiles suffer the power consumption problem that becomes {{one of the major}} concerns for commercial de-ployment of the <b>dual-mode</b> <b>service.</b> In this study, we present a novel power saving mechanism, called PIANO (paging via another radio), for the {{integration of}} heterogeneous wireless networks, and further apply the proposed methods to imple-ment a cellular/VoWLAN dual-mode system. Based on the proposed mechanisms, a dual-mode mobile can completely switch off its WLAN interface, only leaving the cellular interface awake to listen to paging messages. When a mo-bile receives a paging message from its cellular interface, it wakes up the WLAN interface and responds to connec-tion requests via WLAN networks. Therefore, a dual-mode mobile reduces the power consumption by turning off the WLAN interface during idle, and can also receive VoWLAN services. Measurement results based on the prototype system demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly extend the standby hours of a dual-mode mobile...|$|E
40|$|A Generic Framework for the Personal Omni-Remote Controller Using M 2 MI is a master’s thesis {{outlining}} {{a generic}} {{framework for the}} wireless omni-remote controller that controls neighboring appliances by using Many-to-Many Invocation (M 2 MI). M 2 MI is an object-oriented abstraction of broadcast communication. First, this paper introduces the history of remote controllers and analyzes omni-remote controller projects made by other researchers in this area, such as the Pebbles PDA project at Carnegie Mellon University and HP’s COOLTOWN project. Second, this paper depicts a generic framework of the personal omni-remote controller system including architecture, type hierarchy, and service discovery. In this framework, a module approach and a decentralized <b>dual-mode</b> <b>service</b> discovery scheme are introduced. When users request {{a certain type of}} service, their omni-remote controller application will first discover the available appliances in the vicinity and then bring up the corresponding control module for the target appliance. Thus, users can control the appliance through the User Interface of the control module. To join the omni-remote controller system, servers and clients need to follow the type hierarchy convention of the system. Finally, several implementations are given to show the control of different appliances with different capabilities. These appliances include thermostats, TVs with parental control, and washing machines...|$|E

The first few of a planned fleet of 235 hybrid diesel-electric articulated buses began operating on tunnel bus routes in June 2004. The Breda dual-mode trolleybuses were removed from the tunnel in January 2005 and would later be refurbished into electric-only trolleybuses for use on the city's trolleybus network. The last day of trolleybus operation in the tunnel was January 24, 2005, with only a single <b>dual-mode</b> bus in <b>service</b> on the final day.|$|R
