50|$|Scholars {{debate the}} {{underlying}} developmental causes and reasons for these mistakes. One theory, the semantic feature hypothesis, states that mistakes occur because children acquire the basic {{features of a}} word’s meaning before learning its more specific aspects. For instance, the child may initially use the word basketball in reference to any round object, but then change its meaning to a round, orange, and <b>grooved</b> <b>ball</b> that bounces. Children may overextend the meaning of basketball to any round object until they learn the more specific aspects of the word’s meaning. Other theories suggest that errors in early word use {{are the result of}} an inability {{on the part of the}} child to retrieve the correct word. Although the child might have accurately comprehended the word at one time, they are unable to actively retrieve the word or its meaning from their rapidly growing vocabulary.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A CV joint {{outer race}} is an {{important}} load-supporting part in cars. Its geometry is very complicated. Traditional hot and cold forging methods have their own limitations to produce such a complex shaped part. Therefore, multistage forging may be advantageous to produce this part. The key point of outer race is performing the geometry of <b>ball</b> <b>grooves</b> with negative slope angle. Traditional methods form the <b>ball</b> <b>groove</b> by machining that takes long time and waste many portions of the material. Thus near net shape forging is an attractive option for producing of outer race.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{develops}} a five {{degrees of freedom}} (5 -DOF) model for aeroengine spindle dual-rotor system dynamic analysis. In this system, the dual rotors are supported on two angular contact ball bearings and two deep <b>groove</b> <b>ball</b> bearings, one of the latter-mentioned bearings works as the inter-shaft bearing. Driven by respective motors, the dual rotors have different co-rotating speeds. The proposed model mathematically formulates the nonlinear displacements, elastic deflections and contact forces of bearings with consideration of 5 -DOF and coupling of dual rotors. The nonlinear equations of motions of dual rotors with 5 -DOF are solved using Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg algorithm. In order to investigate {{the effect of the}} introduced 5 -DOF and nonlinear dynamic bearing model, we compare the proposed model with two models: the 3 -DOF model of this system only considering three translational degrees of freedom (Gupta, 1993, rotational freedom is neglected); the 5 -DOF model where the deep <b>groove</b> <b>ball</b> bearings are simplified as linear elastic spring (Guskov, 2007).

40|$|A {{new engine}} design concept, {{characterized}} by a single cylinder-double piston and a cycloid crank rotor instead of the conventional crankshaft has been developed recently by Gul & Co Development AB, Sweden. The rotor (crank disc) is equipped with an oval groove {{in the shape of}} a sinusoidal cycloid according to the expression Y=S(-Sin(2 ) /(2 )) where S is the piston stroke and  varies from 0 to 1. Inside the oval <b>groove</b> a <b>ball</b> rolls/ slides in order to transfer force from the piston to the rotor. Such a rotor contains groove surfaces for the valve movement control as well. Each turn of the rotor corresponds to four strokes for both the pistons. Thus, a full 4 -stroke engine cycle is developed for a single nonconventional crankshaft revolution. Having the extra freedom to select an optimal piston movement, the new design is believed to have the potential to provide low emissions, low noise levels and lower fuel consumption. Therefore, it has been subjected to an engine thermodynamics simulation, to provide an insight to engine performance. Simulation results and preliminary laboratory tests have shown that the optimized cycloid crank rotor, which further intensifies the reduction of the piston speed close to both dead centers, gives better conditions for the combustion processes, and thus a higher efficiency. Since the single cylinder-double piston with cycloid crank rotor displays better performance and reduced size compared to conventional combustion engines, it is believed that this new patented Swedish engine will compete with conventional engines in lawn movers, chain saws, outboard motors and other engines in similar small-scaled equipment...|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{a dynamic}} multibody {{model of a}} deep <b>groove</b> single row <b>ball</b> bearing. The objective {{of the study is}} to simulate the dynamic behavior of a bearing under different operational conditions. Typical vibration signals used in bearing diagnostics are simulated using the non-linear Hertzian contact theory. Geometry, material properties, friction and damping coefficients are considered as input while displacements, velocities, accelerations and forces between bearing rings are calculated and validated with the analytical formulations found in literature. Furthermore localized faults are introduced in the simulation in order to extract bearing defect frequencies and to represent the real vibration signal signature in case of fault components. For this purpose, a simplified model is realized using the polygonal contact model. This approach allows to investigate more in detail the effect of localized defects by reproducing the real rolling elements trajectories through a discretization of the contact surfaces. The low computation efficiency compared to the traditional Hertzian approach limits the application of this contact algorithm on the complete bearing model. Nevertheless, the simplified model allows to draw conclusions regarding the influence of the shaft/cage speed on the fault size estimation giving an innovative contribution on bearing diagnostics. status: publishe...|$|R
