5|$|Besides {{the legal}} {{services}} rendered by Don Felipe to the impoverished, Agoncillo {{and her daughters}} observed every Thursday as a day of charity, when a queue of needy people seeking alms would form in the Agoncillo driveway. No one ever left their house empty-handed. Agoncillo would <b>hand</b> <b>them</b> a bag of rice {{in addition to the}} money she gave them. This practice lasted until the couple retired.|$|E
5|$|The last Egyptian {{transport}} sailed away on October 5, taking Ibrahim Pasha. Of the 40,000 men he {{had brought}} from Egypt, he was taking back barely 20,000. A few Ottoman soldiers remained in order to hold the different strongholds of the Peloponnese. The next mission of the French troops was to “give security” to these and <b>hand</b> <b>them</b> back to independent Greece.|$|E
5|$|Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) {{is upset}} that his {{daughter}} Jada would rather spend Christmas with her mother than him. At the party, Jada begins to lose interest, but Pam and Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) try to find fun activities for her; however, Andy ends up ruining most of them. Darryl then takes her to the break room, where she is impressed with the snacks in the vending machines. They take out the snacks and <b>hand</b> <b>them</b> to employees. When she hands one to Michael, he decides to dress up as Santa again so she can tell him what she wants for Christmas as Holly looks on with admiration.|$|E

5|$|John became king in 1199 after Richard's death. William de Ferrers, 4th Earl of Derby {{maintained}} {{the claim of}} the Earls of Derby to the Peveril estates. He paid King John 2000marks (£1333) for the lordship of the Peak, but the Crown retained possession of Peveril and Bolsover Castles. John finally gave Ferrers these castles in 1216 to secure his support {{in the face of}} country-wide rebellion. However, the castellan Brian de Lisle refused to <b>hand</b> <b>them</b> over. Although de Lisle and Ferrers were both King John's supporters, the king gave Ferrers permission to use force to retake the castles.|$|E
5|$|North Carolina {{opened their}} 198182 {{campaign}} {{with a win}} against Kansas at a neutral site in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Order forms for the public were shipped to 44,000 post offices and 33,000 banks, with instructions not to <b>hand</b> <b>them</b> out until June 18. The Mint returned some orders for being sent in too early. Mint sets of the circulating coinage for 1971 {{did not include the}} Eisenhower dollar.|$|E

Moon <b>handed</b> <b>them</b> to Inglewood, who <b>handed</b> <b>them</b> back in silence to Moses Gould.|$|R

5|$|U.S. rhetoric abroad {{also had}} an effect on the Guatemalan {{military}}. The military had always been anti-communist, and Ambassador Peurifoy had applied {{a lot of pressure on}} senior officers ever since his arrival in Guatemala in October 1953. Árbenz had intended the secret shipment of weapons from the Alfhem to be used to bolster peasant militias, in the event of army disloyalty. But the U.S. informed army chiefs of the shipment, forcing Árbenz to <b>hand</b> <b>them</b> over to the military, and deepening the rift between him and his top generals.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, Gaddafi was overjoyed by the {{foundation}} of the Arab Maghreb Union, uniting Libya in an economic pact with Mauritania, Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria, viewing it as beginnings of a new Pan-Arab union. Meanwhile, Libya stepped up its support for anti-Western militants such as the Provisional IRA, and in 1988, Pan Am Flight 103 was blown up over Lockerbie in Scotland, killing 243 passengers and 16 crew members, plus 11 people on the ground. British police investigations identified two Libyans – Abdelbaset al-Megrahi and Lamin Khalifah Fhimah – as the chief suspects, and in November 1991 issued a declaration demanding that Libya <b>hand</b> <b>them</b> over. When Gaddafi refused, citing the Montreal Convention, the United Nations (UN) imposed Resolution 748 in March 1992, initiating economic sanctions against Libya which had deep repercussions for the country's economy. The country suffered an estimated $900 million financial loss as a result. Further problems arose with the West when in January 1989, two Libyan warplanes were shot down by the U.S. off the Libyan coast. Many African states opposed the UN sanctions, with Mandela criticizing them on a visit to Gaddafi in October 1997, when he praised Libya for its work in fighting apartheid and awarded Gaddafi the Order of Good Hope. They would only be suspended in 1998 when Libya agreed to allow the extradition of the suspects to the Scottish Court in the Netherlands, in a process overseen by Mandela.|$|E
25|$|After {{a failed}} attempt to {{negotiate}} with Casado, on 6 March Negrín fled to France from the Monovar's airfield, near Elda, with Hidalgo de Cisneros, {{the leaders of the}} PCE (La Pasionaria and Vicente Uribe), and the foreign minister Julio Álvarez del Vayo, in order to avoid capture by the supporters of Casado (Casado wanted to arrest the government and the PCE's leaders in order to <b>hand</b> <b>them</b> over to the Nationalists).|$|E

25|$|A {{suitable}} {{cover story}} {{was the need}} to deny use of the area to the enemy. The Kriegsmarine was known to use remote islands as rendezvous points and as shelters for commerce raiders, U-boats and supply ships. Also, in 1941, there existed a fear that Japan might attempt to seize the Falkland Islands, either as a base or to <b>hand</b> <b>them</b> over to Argentina, thus gaining political advantage for the Axis and denying their use to Britain.|$|E
25|$|The Quraysh, {{suspicious}} of their motives for leaving Arabia, sent Abdullah ibn Abi Rabiah and 'Amr ibn al-'As {{to negotiate with}} the Negus to bring the emigrants back to Mecca. They gave presents of leather-goods to the Negus and his officials and gave him a bad report of the Muslims. The Negus replied that he had promised protection to the Muslims and therefore could not <b>hand</b> <b>them</b> over without hearing their side of the story. When the Muslims were called to answer to the Negus, Ja’far was their spokesman.|$|E
25|$|Alacoque {{lost her}} father {{at a young}} age, and the family's assets were held by a {{relative}} who refused to <b>hand</b> <b>them</b> over, plunging her family into poverty. During this time, her only consolation was frequent visits to pray before the Blessed Sacrament in the local church. When she was 17, however, the family regained their fortune and her mother encouraged her to socialize, {{in the hopes of}} her finding a suitable husband. Out of obedience, and believing that her childhood vow was no longer binding, she began to accompany her brothers in the social events, attending dances and balls.|$|E

When he sees the Stabbingtons on the shore, Eugene leaves Rapunzel and intends to <b>hand</b> <b>them</b> the crown. Instead, the brothers tie Eugene onto a boat and confront Rapunzel, saying that Eugene is escaping with the crown. Gothel sets a rescue by betraying the brothers and returns Rapunzel to the tower as Eugene and the Stabbingtons are captured.|$|E
25|$|Colonel William Stewart {{was sent}} as {{ambassador}} {{by the regime}} to England in April 1583 to ask for £10,000 and yearly £5000 as an income from the English lands of Matthew Stewart, 4th Earl of Lennox, and for the ratification and renewal of the 1560 Treaty of Edinburgh. The Colonel was to enquire discreetly after the succession to the English throne. Robert Bowes, the English diplomat, stayed in Edinburgh and followed events. As it seemed opportune, he was instructed by Francis Walsingham {{to seek out the}} casket letters which had been used to incriminate Queen Mary in 1568, but the Earl of Gowrie refused to <b>hand</b> <b>them</b> over.|$|E

The next day, Osterman defeated the No. 1 Arizona Wildcats in a 18-strikeout, three-hit shutout to <b>hand</b> <b>them</b> their first loss. On March 1, she struck out 15 batters in a 5–1 win over the UTA Mavericks to bring her career total to 1,807, making her the first pitcher in NCAA Division I history to reach the 1,800 watershed.|$|E

25|$|After the {{cancellation}} of 2013 Sri Lanka Premier League due to all eight franchises refused to pay their tournament fee, and also failed to guarantee player payments, Sri Lanka Cricket announced that the Super Fours Provincial T20 Tournament will replace SLPL for this year.

This tournament, however, will be 4-team tournament lasting for only 7 matches which is the lowest of all the seasons. This is also the first time that Wayamba Elevens will not be part of the tournament. It will begin on 10 August and will last up to 17 August.|$|E
25|$|The {{extermination}} project lacked secrecy, and {{was therefore}} sabotaged from the outside. Baron Neumann of Végvár, a Banat Jewish industrialist, is credited with having coaxed and bribed some Romanian officials, focusing his effort on postponing all transports to Lublin {{for as long as}} was possible. According to historian Victor Neumann, the Baron's intervention was only part of a series of intersecting events. These include a propaganda and passive resistance effort mounted by other Jewish community leaders of the Banat, the discontent of Romanian railway employees, topical criticism coming from Romanian civil society representatives (Bishop Bălan, Iuliu Maniu), and, in some part, Antonescu's own doubts about Germany's ability to win the war. In that context, Romanian Jewish leaders also expressed solidarity with Polish Jews trapped on Romanian soil, persuading Lecca not to <b>hand</b> <b>them</b> over to the Germans.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of 25 February, rebels, led by the Al-Nusra Front, made an attempt to capture the Tal al-Jabiyah {{military}} facility, which reportedly contained chemical weapons. International military commanders based in Jordan warned the rebels to leave the weapons alone and <b>hand</b> <b>them</b> over {{to them in the}} case they capture the bunker complex or an Israeli airstrike would be called in on the location. The rebels agreed. However, by the next day, rebels were still pushing to take control of Tal Al Jabiyeh. The Amman command centre than halted all weapons supplies to the assaulting forces, apparently in a successful effort to delay their advance on the bunker. Without supplies, the rebels were forced to consolidate their positions around the base and not seek to capture it. Over the next two days, government reinforcements arrived and by 1 March the military managed to push back the rebels.|$|E
