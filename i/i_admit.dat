500|$|In his youth, {{influenced}} by his uncle, former Liberal Lord Mayor of Adelaide Sir Jonathan Cain, Dunstan was {{a supporter of}} the conservative Liberal and Country League (LCL) and handed out how-to-vote cards for the party at state elections. Dunstan later said of his involvement with the Liberals: [...] "I do not call it snobbery to deride the Establishment in South Australia, <b>I</b> <b>admit</b> that I was brought up into it, and <b>I</b> <b>admit</b> that it gave me a pain." [...] When asked of his roots, he said [...] "I'm a refugee from it and thank God for somewhere honest to flee to!" ...|$|E

500|$|Being as skeptical as Boyajian was, {{she finally}} decided to take SETI's {{approach}} and allow herself to {{have a bit of}} fun in hypothesizing what the light pattern could have been. In her Ted Talk she joked: [...] "Another idea that's one of my personal favorites is that we had just witnessed an interplanetary space battle and the catastrophic destruction of a planet. Now, <b>I</b> <b>admit</b> that this would produce a lot of dust that we don't observe. But if we're already invoking aliens in this explanation, then who is to say they didn't efficiently clean up all this mess for recycling purposes?" ...|$|E
500|$|Boult, {{unlike many}} of his contemporaries, {{preferred}} the traditional orchestral layout, with first violins on the conductor's left and the seconds on the right. Of the practice of grouping all the violins together on the left, he wrote, [...] "The new seating is, <b>I</b> <b>admit,</b> easier for the conductor and the second violins, but I firmly maintain that the second violins themselves sound far better on the right.... When the new fashion reached us from America somewhere about 1908 it was adopted by some conductors, but Richter, Weingartner, Walter, Toscanini and many others kept what I feel is the right balance." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{trial was}} Captain Fabbroni's finest moment. He testified in 21 {{hearings}} and his testimony filled 285 pages. He accused the police, politicians {{and even the}} judiciary of being involved with the Camorra. Alfano claimed he was innocent. [...] "I am the victim of yellow journalism," [...] he told the judge. [...] "I have been ruined by the Carabinieri. The story that I have been {{the head of the}} Camorra is a legend.

500|$|The {{disastrous}} January 1863 Uprising {{had persuaded}} Prus that society must advance through learning, work and commerce {{rather than through}} risky social upheavals. He departed from this stance, however, in 1905, when Imperial Russia experienced defeat in the Russo-Japanese War and Poles demanded autonomy and reforms. On 20 December 1905, in {{the first issue of}} a short-lived periodical, Młodość (Youth), he published an article, [...] "Oda do młodości" [...] ("Ode to Youth"), whose title harked back to an 1820 poem by Adam Mickiewicz. Prus wrote, in reference to his earlier position on revolution and strikes: [...] "with the greatest pleasure, <b>I</b> <b>admit</b> it—I was wrong!" ...|$|E

The second part of the quote alludes to his relationship with Kim Kardashian and her estranged husband, Kris Humphries.

500|$|Tomb of Horrors {{was written}} by Gary Gygax for {{official}} D tournament play at the 1975 Origins 1 convention. Gygax developed the adventure from an idea by Alan Lucien, one of his original AD playtesters, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>admit</b> to chuckling evilly as I did so." [...] Gygax designed the Tomb of Horrors modules for two related purposes. First, Gygax explains, [...] "There were several very expert players in my campaign, and this was meant as yet another challenge to their skill—and the persistence of their theretofore-invincible characters. Specifically, I had in mind foiling Rob Kuntz's PC, Robilar, and Ernie Gygax's PC, Tenser." [...] Second, {{so that he was}} [...] "ready for those fans [...] who boasted of having mighty PCs able to best any challenge offered by the AD game." ...|$|E

500|$|The New York Times {{film critic}} Bosley Crowther noted {{the film was}} a subtle satire on Beatlemania and the Beatles themselves. The Beatles are portrayed as likeable young lads who are {{constantly}} amazed at the attention they receive and who want {{nothing more than a}} little peace and quiet; however, {{they have to deal with}} screaming crowds, journalists who ask nonsensical questions, and authority figures who constantly look down upon them. In fact their biggest problem is McCartney's elderly, but [...] "clean" [...] grandfather, played by Wilfrid Brambell. The New Yorker critic Brendan Gill wrote: [...] "Though I don't pretend to understand what makes these four rather odd-looking boys so fascinating to so many scores of millions of people, <b>I</b> <b>admit</b> that I feel a certain mindless joy stealing over me as they caper about uttering sounds." ...|$|E
500|$|After Sigappu Rojakkal, {{there was}} a {{resurgence}} of the thriller genre in Tamil cinema, as evidenced by films like Moodu Pani. According to film producer and writer G. Dhananjayan, the film [...] "inspired a generation to take up film-making". M. Suganth of The Times of India stated that Mahendra [...] "changed the landscape of Tamil cinema with his distinctive visuals and eclectic films" [...] such as Moodu Pani. Pothen recalled in January 2015 {{that it was the}} simultaneous release of Moodu Pani and his other film Varumayin Niram Sivappu that made him a star. However, both Varumayin Niram Sivappu, which depicted Pothen as an eccentric director obsessed with an actress, and Moodu Pani led to him being typecast in similar roles. [...] "Both roles caught the public imagination, and <b>I</b> <b>admit</b> I cashed in when I was offered similar stuff. Now, unless I'm offered an unreasonable amount of money, I doubt I'll accept these roles," [...] he said in a 2014 interview.|$|E
500|$|Tim's driving days {{started as}} a toddler when {{he was given a}} go-kart that he often drove inside {{buildings}} and across his lawn. He later raced the kart at tracks in Moreland and New Pittsburg. Richmond grew up in a well-to-do family, and was sometimes therefore treated differently by his classmates, so his parents enrolled him in Miami Military Academy in Miami, Florida. During his years in Miami, Tim and his mother moved to Florida and his father stayed in Ohio. While home in Ohio over a summer break, he met local drag racer Raymond Beadle through lifelong friend Fred Miller. When Richmond reached age 16, his parents purchased him a Pontiac Trans Am, a speedboat and a Piper Cherokee airplane for his birthday. Yet his mother Evelyn often worried about spoiling her only son. She once said, [...] "Tim was lazy...", and [...] "... I did everything for him. I ruined him, <b>I</b> <b>admit</b> it. He was my whole life." ...|$|E

500|$|Reviews of Bookends {{upon its}} release in 1968 were largely positive. Allen Evans of the British {{publication}} New Musical Express (NME) gave the record {{four out of}} five stars and called it [...] "inspiring, descriptive music," [...] while noting the album is [...] "Imaginative and at times confusing to know what the composer is getting at, if anything." [...] Rival newspaper Melody Maker did not use a ratings system, but called Bookends a [...] "thoughtful, clever and well-produced album." [...] Reviewer Chris Welch criticized the songs as [...] "not particularly tuneful," [...] but performed with [...] "Beatles fervour and Beatles conviction," [...] praising the lyricism, opining that [...] "The words capture part of America today, a lot of its sickness and tragedy." [...] In the US, Rolling Stone reviewer Arthur Schmidt wrote that [...] "The music is, for me, questionable, but I've always found their music questionable. It is nice enough, and <b>I</b> <b>admit</b> to liking it, but it exudes a sense of process, and it is slick, and nothing too much happens." ...|$|E
500|$|Jennifer Armstrong of Entertainment Weekly {{said that}} when O'Malley told Torres about his affair with Stevens, the scene was too [...] "melodramatic". Laura Burrows, also of IGN, said that the fourth-season premiere [...] "introduced a new side of George". Armstrong said of O'Malley and Stevens' reconciliation: [...] "George and Izzie are finally on the old Grey's Anatomy road to ruin. And <b>I</b> <b>admit</b> {{this is a good}} lesson in Grey's viewing as well as life: Sit tight if you hate something, as nothing is permanent." [...] Armstrong also commented that the [...] "sparkling" [...] {{friendship}} development between Lexie and O'Malley [...] "won her over". The following year, Monfette observed of O'Malley's lack of screen time: [...] "His growing interest in trauma surgery at the side of Owen leads to an interesting development in the finale, but the character is virtually side-lined this season." [...] Carina MacKenzie of the Los Angeles Times said of the character's death: [...] "The time-lapse episode was an interesting choice, and though we sped through six weeks of mourning in two hours, it didn't feel rushed to me. I'm not sure the show could have held my attention for another season of crippling sadness." ...|$|E
500|$|Mike Hale of the New York Times did {{not miss}} Sue's {{presence}} in the episode, and wrote that [...] "Ballad" [...] contained some scenes which were [...] "as honestly emotional as any since this series began, most of them involving Kurt and Finn". Gerrick D. Kennedy for the Los Angeles Times appreciated the episode for subverting expectations, by having Finn's mother react supportively to the news of Quinn's pregnancy, rather than the more affluent and financially capable Fabrays. Dan Snierson for Entertainment Weekly opined that [...] "Ballad" [...] was {{not as good as}} the preceding episode, [...] "Wheels", but that overall: [...] "it did offer up a few choice cuts and fun moments while advancing one big story line". James Poniewozik of Time agreed that [...] "Ballad" [...] was not as good as [...] "Wheels", commenting: [...] "it's amazing how Glee can career from excruciating to transcendent within a single episode." [...] The Chicago Tribune Eric Zorn, watching Glee for the first time, deemed the episode [...] "deliriously, deliciously bad", deriding the casting of young adult actors as teenagers, the [...] "one-dimensional stock characters" [...] and the [...] "kitschy plots". Zorn questioned: [...] "So do people actually like this show, or just revel in its over-the-top, spectacular and, <b>I</b> <b>admit,</b> compelling badness?" ...|$|E

500|$|On 7 May, Benfica {{played their}} final match {{of the season}} at Estádio da Mata Real. Benfica's Manuel Fernandes scored first but could not prevent Paços de Ferreira scoring three second-half goals, thus losing the game. Benfica ended the season in third place, missing out on the title and an {{automatic}} place in the 2006–07 UEFA Champions League. Despite winning both games against Porto, the closest Benfica had come from them was on the 18 and 19 match-days, with only three points. Benfica closed the season 12 points behind the leader and five from Sporting. Of the Big Three, Benfica conceded the most goals (29) and scored the second-highest number of goals (51), with the worst goal-average (+22). Koeman wanted to fulfil his contract with Benfica, but after negotiations with the management and sudden interest from PSV, Benfica opted to release him on mutual terms. Koeman thanked Luís Filipe Vieira and José Veiga for their support in face of repeated criticism, and said, [...] "This is very big club, but you cannot win all the time, although <b>I</b> <b>admit,</b> that in the Primeira Liga, {{he did not do}} everything he could. We could have done better. But I say, It was a pleasure being here, now my career will continue elsewhere." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{album cover}} was photographed by Björk's former boyfriend, the French {{director}} Stéphane Sednaoui. It shows the singer {{standing in a}} London street, her pale skin and dark hair contrasting with the vivid colours of the Japanese-inspired signs behind her. An earlier shoot by Jean-Baptiste Mondino was scrapped; it would later appear in a 1995 article for The Face, in which Björk explained: [...] "It cost £24,000. But now I know what I want. OK, <b>I</b> <b>admit</b> it, [...] I'm a pop star"! In the original cover picture, Björk was surrounded by silver balls, but she scrapped the cover in favour of something [...] "more poppy". Designer Paul White of Me Company—who had been a frequent collaborator since The Sugarcubes—"surrounded her with giant postcards to represent communication with friends and family". Me Company designed the artwork, while Martin Gardiner modelled the lotus flower used in the album's booklet and packaging. The jacket Björk wears, shown on the cover, was inspired by Royal Mail airmail envelopes, referencing the album's title. It was specially crafted from envelope paper called Tyvek by designer Hussein Chalayan. Björk {{was a friend of}} Chalayan and an admirer of his designs, modelling for him in September 1995. The jacket is displayed under glass at Hard Rock Reykjavík, and was part of a 2015 MoMA retrospective on the singer, titled Björk. Vice has identified the airmail jacket look as one the [...] "ultimate fashion moments" [...] of Björk's career.|$|E
500|$|Nonetheless, the {{relation}} between them quickly deteriorated, as Young began to feel {{that he was being}} denied due credit for his own [...] "first steps" [...] in the decipherment. Also, because of the tense political climate between England and France {{in the aftermath of the}} Napoleonic Wars, there was little inclination to accept Champollion's decipherments as valid among the English. When Young later read the published copy of the lettre he was offended by the fact that he himself was mentioned only twice, and one of those times being harshly critiqued for his failure in deciphering the name [...] "Berenice". Young was further disheartened by the fact that Champollion at no point recognized his work as having provided the platform from which decipherment had finally been reached. He grew increasingly angry with Champollion, and shared his feelings with his friends who encouraged him to rebut with a new publication. When by a stroke of luck a Greek translation of a well-known demotic papyrus came into his possession later that year, he did not share that important finding with Champollion. In an anonymous review of the lettre Young attributed the discovery of the hieratic as a form of hieroglyphs to de Sacy and described Champollion's decipherments merely as an extension of Åkerblad and Young's work. Champollion recognized that Young was the author, and sent him a rebuttal of the review, while maintaining the charade of the anonymous review. Furthermore, Young, in his 1823 An Account of Some Recent Discoveries in Hieroglyphical Literature and Egyptian Antiquities, including the author's original alphabet, as extended by Mr. Champollion, he complained that [...] "however Mr Champollion may have arrived at his conclusions, <b>I</b> <b>admit</b> them, with the greatest pleasure and gratitude, not by any means as superseding my system, but as fully confirming and extending it."(p.146).|$|E
