50|$|Often {{hundreds}} of thousands of mutations are generated. Chemicals like <b>ethylmethanesulfonate</b> (EMS) cause random point mutations. These types of mutagens can be useful because they are easily applied to any organism but they can be very difficult to map. Mutations can also be generated by insertional mutagenesis. For example, transposable elements containing a marker are mobilized into the genome at random. These transposons are often modified to transpose only once, and once inserted into the genome a selectable marker can be used to identify the mutagenized individuals. Since a known fragment of DNA was inserted this can make mapping and cloning the gene much easier. Other methods such as using radiation to cause deletions and chromosomal rearrangements can be used to generate mutants as well.|$|E

It is known that all lethal agents tested so far attack the primary structure of the D N A in different ways. Therefore, {{we assume that the}} target for the host cell reactivation consists of some damage in the secondary structure of the DNA, because there is probably some coincidence in the action of all agents.

The {{percentage}} of DNA that migrated towards the anode during microelectrophoresis after alkali denaturation (pHsimilar to 13. 5) of the isolated nuclei (comet assay) reflects {{the amount of}} single strand breaks present in them. There was some DNA migration (12. 8 +/- 2. 4 %) in untreated roots. This percentage doubled {{at the end of}} 1. 5 h treatment with the mono-functional alkylating agent 2 mM <b>ethylmethanesulfonate,</b> and trebled after a single exposure to I Gy of gamma-rays. A proportion of the DNA migration caused by these two treatments was reversed (repaired) by a 2 h long period of in vivo recovery. However, when 5 mM caffeine was applied after removal of the alkylating agent, the amount of DNA migrating to the comet tail over the same 2 h period was almost double that at the onset of recovery. In both control and irradiated nuclei, caffeine also increased the initial level of DNA migration in the comet assay. but to a lesser extent. These results indicate that caffeine increases the DNA damage that accumulates during the processing of alkylated bases and, to a lesser extent, of the DNA bases damaged by gamma-irradiation. Thus, the potentiation effect of caffeine on induced chromosomal damage may not just be due to caffeine-induced cancellation of the G 2 checkpoint, but also to a direct effect this methylxantine has on the processing of DNA damage...|$|E

Irradiation of calli twice with gamma rays at 40 grays caused more damage to epidermal cells than the other doses and 0. 5 % EMS. However, double irradiation followed by application of EMS at the above concentration and period caused the most severe damage to the cells. Peroxidase was the most effective isozyme system for identification of mutants obtained from first regenerants.

40|$|The {{complexity}} of DNA repair mechanisms infers that xenobiotics, derived from food and medicinal plants, may interfere in the process, activating or inhibiting repair. Different flavonoids were investigated, {{at the highest}} non-toxic concentration, for their capacity to modulate DNA repair 12, 24 and 48 h after a non-reactive oxygen species (ROS) treatment involving <b>ethylmethanesulfonate</b> (2 mM; 2 h). After 12 h, DNA fragmentation is substantially increased by quercetin; this effect disappears at subsequent sampling times. At 24 h, fragmentation is reduced {{in the presence of}} apigenin and slightly increased by sakuranetin. None of the flavonoids tested inhibited repair, which seems complete at 48 h. Ex vivo comet experiments were then performed to assess the excision capabilities of protein extracts obtained from flavonoid-treated cells. Quercetin increases non-specific endonuclease activity, apigenin and epicatechin increase the excision of damages and sakuranetin increases both non-specific and specific enzymatic activities. Combining direct repair and ex vivo experiments yields complementary data that may lead to characterizing mechanisms. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

This preference was observed with both methyl and ethyl donors where the predicted common ultimate alkylating species is the alkyl diazonium ion. In contrast, this preference was not seen following treatment with <b>ethylmethanesulfonate.</b> The observed preference for 5 'PuG- 3 ' site over 5 '-PyG- 3 ' sites corresponds well with alterations observed in the Ha-ras oncogene recovered after treatment with NMU.

All mutants examined thus far have bred true, and no effects of cell density or cross feeding have been observed on the selection. Fluctuation analysis showed that the dipr mutation occurs in these fibroblasts {{at the rate of}} 5 - 6 X 10 (- 7) mutations per cell per generation. Protein synthesis in mutant extracts was resistant to diphtheria toxin, indicating that the dipr lesion in such mutants lies in the protein synthesis machinery.

ICRF- 193 did not inhibit differentiation induced by neocarzinostatin (NCS), {{a drug that}} causes DNA DSBs independent of topo II. Schneider cells differentiated upon treatment with γ-ray. These results suggest that DNA DSBs induce myogenic differentiation of Schneider cells. We also found DNA replication inhibitors, hydroxyurea (HU), aphidicolin, and <b>ethylmethanesulfonate</b> (EMS) induced myogenic differentiation of Schneider cells. HU-induced differentiation was inhibited upon pretreatment of cells with chemical inhibitors of PP 1 / 2 A, p 38 MAPK, JNK, and proteasome.

At least 17 neuro-logical diseases have similar genetic mutations, the expansion of DNA repeats. In most of these disorders, the disease severity is related to the length of the repeat expansion, and in DM 1 the expanded repeat undergoes further elongation in somatic and germline tissues. At present, in this class of diseases, no thera-peutic approach exists to prevent or slow the repeat expansion and thereby reduce disease severity or delay disease onset. We present initial results testing the hypothesis that repeat deletion may be mediated by various chemotherapeutic agents. Three lympho-blast cell lines derived from two DM 1 patients treated with either <b>ethylmethanesulfonate</b> (EMS), mitomycin C, mitoxantrone or doxorubicin, at therapeutic concen-trations, accumulated deletions following treatment. Treatment with EMS frequently prevented the repeat expansion observed during growth in culture.

40|$|Although isopentenyl {{diphosphate}} is {{a precursor}} of isoprenoids in Escherichia coli, the genes and enzymes involved in its biosynthesis {{have not been}} identified. Thus, we tried to isolate E. coli mutants deficient in the biosynthesis and their complementary genes by use of an artificial phenotypic screening system employing three carotenoid biosynthetic genes, crtE, crtB, and crtl. Cells were mutagenized with <b>ethylmethanesulfonate,</b> then transform-ed with a plasmid for expression of the carotenogenic genes. Mutants deficient in biosyn-thesis of isopentenyl diphosphate were expected to form white colonies, because {{they are unable to}} produce enough lycopene, whereas wild-type cells form red colonies. Among large numbers of red colonies, we identified 117 white colonies. Next, we transformed each mutant with an E. coli genomic library. Twenty-nine complementary genes that restore red color of host colonies were isolated. A homology search and further complementation study using subcloned genes revealed that the true complementary genes encode isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase, subunits of ATP synthase, enzymes of the Krebs cycle, some aldehyde dehydrogenases, phosphate acetyltransferase, and enzymes which relate to the biosynthesis of ubiquinones and menaquinones.

These cells are 2 - 5 fold more resistant to the toxic effects of methylating agents than normal cells (15). Kinetic measurements of 3 -methyladenine removal from the genome in situ show a moderate (3 -fold) increase in Tag expressing cells relative to normal as compared to a high (50 -fold) increase in exogenous alkylated DNA in vitro by cell extracts. Excision of 7 -methylguanine is as expected, unaffected by the tag+ gene expression. The frequency of mutations formed in the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase (hprt) locus was investigated after methylmethanesulfonate (MMS), <b>ethylmethanesulfonate</b> (EMS), N-nitroso-N-methylurea (NMU) and N-nitroso-N-ethylurea (NEU) exposure. Tag expression reduced the frequency of MMS and EMS induced mutations to about half the normal rate, whereas the mutation frequency in cells exposed to NMU or NEU is not affected by the tag+ gene expression.

40|$|To {{delineate}} cellular {{genes that}} are required for optimal HIV- 1 infection, CEM cells were subjected to treatment with the chemical mutagen <b>ethylmethanesulfonate</b> (EMS) and subclones were selected based on their increased resistance to HIV- 1 infection and reduced syncytium formation, despite relatively normal CD 4 expression (20, 000 to 25, 000 receptors/cell). Two subclones with this phenotype demonstrated a diminished capacity of HIV- 1 long terminal repeat-chloramphenicol acetyl transferase expression either after treatment with the protein kinase C activator PMA, or through Tat-mediated transactivation. In this study, we show that the cellular levels of the NF-kappa B DNA binding proteins (but not AP 1 or SP 1) are markedly reduced in these cell mutants both at the mRNA and protein levels, resulting in reduced nuclear localization of p 50 /p 65 after PMA induction or treatment with the lymphokine TNF-alpha. Transient reconstitution with a plasmid expressing p 50 resulted in partial recovery of PMA-inducible LTR-chloramphenicol acetyl transferase expression.

The Drosophila amontillado (amon) gene encodes a homolog of the mammalian PC 2 protein, an SPC that functions in the regulated secretory pathway in neuroendocrine tissues. We have identified amon mutants by isolating <b>ethylmethanesulfonate</b> (EMS) -induced lethal and visible mutations that define two complementation groups in the amon interval at 97 D 1 of the third chromosome. DNA sequencing identified the amon complementation group and the DNA sequence change {{for each of the}} nine amon alleles isolated. amon mutants display partial embryonic lethality, are defective in larval growth, and arrest during the first to second instar larval molt. Mutant larvae can be rescued by heat-shock-induced expression of the amon protein. Rescued larvae arrest at the subsequent larval molt, suggesting that amon is also required for the second to third instar larval molt. Our data indicate that the amon proprotein convertase is required during embryogenesis and larval development in Drosophila and support the hypothesis that AMON acts to proteolytically process peptide hormones that regulate hatching, larval growth, and larval ecdysis...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that aging results from the lifelong accumulation of intracellular damage via reactions with reactive oxygen species (ROS). Metallothioneins are conserved cysteine-rich proteins that function as efficient ROS scavengers and may affect longevity. To better understand mechanisms controlling metallothionein expression, the regulatory factors and pathways that controlled cadmium-inducible transcription of the C. elegans metallothionein gene, mtl- 1, were identified. The transcription factor ATF- 7 was identified in both <b>ethylmethanesulfonate</b> mutagenesis and candidate gene screens. PMK- 1 {{and members of the}} insulin signaling pathway, PDK- 1 and AKT- 1 / 2, were also identified as mtl- 1 regulators. Genetic and previous results support a model for the regulation of cadmium-inducible mtl- 1 transcription based on the derepression of the constitutively active transcription factor ELT- 2. In addition, knockdown of the mammalian homologs of PDK 1 and ATF 7 in HEK 293 cells resulted in changes in metallothionein expression, suggesting that this pathway was evolutionarily conserved. The insulin signaling pathway is known to influence the aging process; however, various factors responsible for affecting the aging phenotype are unknown. Identification of portions of the insulin signaling pathway as regulators of metallothionein expression supports the hypothesis that longevity is affected by the expression of this efficient ROS scavenger...|$|E

Reverse genetic screening focused on the potentially multi-paralogous gene FAE 1 (fatty acid elongase 1), which controls seed erucic acid synthesis in rapeseed.

Here, the same resistant clones and susceptible clones were used for the study of protein accumulation against Foc inoculation by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2 -DE), their expression pattern and an in silico approach. The present investigation revealed mass-spectrometry identified 16 proteins that were over accumulated and 5 proteins that were under accumulated as compared to the control.

This subsequently results in lymphadenopathy, and suggests a greater propensity for systemic dissemination. However, whether lymphocytes are a potential vehicle cell for the dissemination of this infection remains unknown. We therefore assessed the growth properties of C. trachomatis L 2 in lymphoid Jurkat cells compared with those observed in epithelial HeLa cells. Both cells supported the growth of C. trachomatis with a similar increase in infective progenies. Enriched human-blood lymphocytes also supported the C. trachomatis growth as well as Jurkat cells. Bacteria infecting the Jurkat cells were more susceptible to antibiotics (doxycycline, azithromycin, ofloxacin) than those in HeLa cells. Of the sphingomyelin biosynthesis inhibitors tested, both myriocin and fumonisin B 1 significantly inhibited bacterial growth in both cells types. A Jurkat cell mutant that impaired bacterial growth was established using <b>ethylmethanesulfonate</b> treatment. DNA microarray analysis with real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed that the mutant cells over-expressed granzyme K gene. Immunofluorescence staining also indicated that granzyme K irregularly over-expressed among the mutant cells as {{compared with that of}} the wild cells, suggesting a possible mechanism refractory to C. trachomatis infection.

There is interest in producing cultivars that have increased resistance to pests and low temperature, in the introduction of novel horticultural characteristics such as leaf shape, flower colour, size and form, and in improved productivity and enhanced flower duration in planta. In African violet, techniques such as the application of chemical mutagens (<b>ethylmethanesulfonate,</b> N-nitroso-N-methylurea), radiation (gamma (γ) -rays, X-rays, carbon ion beams) and colchicine have been successfully applied to induce mutants. Among these techniques, γ radiation and colchicine have been the most commonly applied mutagens. This review offers a short synthesis of the advances made in African violet breeding, including studies on mutation and somaclonal variation caused by physical and chemical factors, as well as transgenic strategies using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation and particle bombardment. In African violet, Agrobacterium-mediated transformation is affected by the Agrobacterium strain, selection marker, and cutting-induced wounding stress. Somaclonal variation, which arises in tissue cultures, can be problematic in maintaining true-to-type clonal material, but may be a useful tool for obtaining variation in flower colour.

Ten single-base-pair mutations were identified in the maize DHPS cDNA sequence; these mutations were specific to one of three amino acid residues (amino acids 157, 162, and 166) localized within a short region of the polypeptide. No other mutations were present in the remaining DHPS cDNA sequence, indicating that altering only one of the three residues suffices to eliminate lysine inhibition of maize DHPS. Identification of these specific mutations that change the highly sensitive maize DHPS to a lysine-insensitive isoform will help resolve the lysine-binding mechanism and the resultant conformational changes involved in inhibition of DHPS activity. The plant-derived mutant DHPS genes may also be used to improve nutritional quality of maize or other cereal grains that have inadequate lysine content when fed to animals such as poultry, swine, or humans...|$|E
40|$|Recently {{the authors}} have {{reported}} the existence of adaptive response of an in vivo animal systems such as P. pictus and mouse and in vitro system of human lymphocytes. Different repair enzymes have been implicated {{in the process of}} adaptive response. In an attempt to understand the involvement of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in <b>ethylmethanesulfonate</b> (EMS) induced adaptive response of P. pictus, present investigations were undertaken by employing nicotinamide, an inhibitor of PARP. Inter-, pre-, and post-treatment expts. were carried out using meiotic cells of P. pictus. In inter-treatment expts. animals were treated with conditioning dose of EMS (0. 03 M). One hour later they were injected with nicotinamide (5 mM) and then challenged after one hour with 0. 12 M of EMS. In the pre- and post-treatments, nicotinamide was given 2 or 4 h before or after combined treatment (conditioning+challenging), resp. In all cases animals were sacrificed at 12, 24, 36, and 48 h recovery times. Regular squash prepns. were made from the testes and the stained slides were screened for the presence of anomalies at metaphase I and II and anaphase I and II. It is very interesting to note that in all cases there were significant redn. in the chromosomal anomalies compared to resp. combined treatment. From these results we can conclude that: (a) nicotinamide acts as a potentiator of inducible adaptive response and (b) PARP is not involved in the inducible adaptive response in the meiotic cells of P. pictus.

40|$|Abstract Background Cultivated {{sunflower}} (Helianthus annus L.) is a globally important oilseed crop, {{subjected to}} intensive genetic and genomic studies. Although classical mutagenesis has successfully {{been applied to}} Helianthus genus in the past, we have developed the first sunflower TILLING resource. Results To balance the maximum mutation density with an acceptable plant survival rate, a 'kill curve' analysis was first conducted with different <b>ethylmethanesulfonate</b> (EMS) dosages and different exposure times. According to the germination rate, a treatment with 0. 7 % EMS for 6 h was chosen. An M 2 progeny of 3, 651 fertile plants was obtained. Totally, 4. 79 % of the whole population showed clear aberrant phenotypes. A microsatellite analysis on {{a representative sample of}} the original seed stock and mutant lines confirmed the uniformity of the genetic background of plant material. The TILLING procedure was successfully applied to sunflower genome, initially by a Cel I-nuclease mismatch cleavage assay coupled with a DNA-pooling level test. To investigate the efficiency of the mutagenic treatment, a pilot screening was carried out on 1, 152 M 2 lines focusing on four genes, three involved in the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway and one for downy mildew resistance. A total of 9 mutant lines were identified and confirmed by sequencing; thereby, the estimated overall mutation frequency for the pilot assay resulted to be 1 / 475 kb. Conclusion A first TILLING population for a high throughput identification of EMS-induced point mutations in sunflower genome has been successfully obtained. This represents a powerful tool {{to a better understanding of}} gene function in sunflower. </p...|$|E
40|$|Plant {{resistance}} to glyphosate {{has been reported}} far less frequently than {{resistance to}} sulfonylurea and imidazolinone herbicides. However, these studies tend to be anecdotal, without side by side comparisons for a single species or natural isolate. In this study, we tested the frequencies of resistance of three herbicides in a controlled <b>ethylmethanesulfonate</b> (EMS) saturation mutagenesis experiment, allowing a direct comparison of the frequencies at which resistant mutant plants arise. The 100 % growth inhibition dose rates of glyphosate, chlorsulfuron (a sulfonylurea herbicide), and imazethapyr (an imidazolinone herbicide) were determined for Arabidopsis. Populations of EMS-mutagenized M 2 seedlings were sprayed with twice the 100 % growth inhibition dose of glyphosate, chlorsulfuron, or imazethapyr, and herbicide-resistant mutants were identified. Although there were no glyphosate-resistant mutants among M 2 progeny of 125, 000 Columbia and 125, 000 Landsberg erecta M 1 lines, chlorsulfuron resistance and imazethapyr resistance each appeared at frequencies of 3. 2 � 10 � 5. Given the observed frequency of herbicide resistance mutations, we calculate that {{there are at least}} 700 mutations in each EMS-mutagenized Arabidopsis line and that fewer than 50, 000 M 1 lines are needed to have a 95 % chance of finding a mutation in any given G:C base pair in the genome. As part of this study, two previously unreported Arabidopsis mutations conferring resistance to imidazolinone herbicides, csr 1 - 5 (Ala- 122 -Thr) and csr 1 - 6 (Ala- 205 -Val), were discovered. Neither of these mutations caused enhanced resistance to chlorsulfuron in Arabidopsis. Spontaneous herbicide resistance is generall...|$|E
40|$|An {{extensive}} <b>ethylmethanesulfonate</b> mutagenesis of Drosophila melanogaster {{was undertaken}} {{to isolate the}} stronger alleles of 3 indirect flight-muscle mutations. We isolated 17 strong mutant lines, with nearly complete penetrance and expressivity, using direct screening under polarized light, from more than 1700 mutagenized chromosomes. On complementation, we found 11 of these 17 mutant lines to be alleles of 3 indirect flight-muscle mutations (Ifm(2) RU 1, 3 non-complementing lines; ifm(2) RU 2, 6 alleles; ifm(2) RU 3, 2 alleles) of the previously isolated 8 complementation groups (Ifm(2) RU 1 to ifm(2) RU 8). In addition, we found 6 new complementation groups with strong defects in adult-muscle morphology; we named these ifm(2) RS 1 to ifm(2) RS 6. All mutant lines were mapped by meiotic recombination, and 5 of the 6 new complementation lines were mapped using chromosome deficiencies. ifm(2) RS 1 maps to a region that harbors ifm(2) RU 4 (a mutation that was isolated previously); however, theses are not alleles because each complements the other mutation, and the mutant-muscle phenotype is very different. We used direct screening under polarized light to find recessive mutations; although this method was labor intensive, {{it can be used}} to identify recessive genes involved in myogenesis, unlike screens for flightlessness or wing-position defects. This screen identifies regions on the second chromosome that harbor probable genes that are likely expressed in the mesoderm and are thought to be involved in myogenesis. This screen has generated valuable resources that will help us to understand the role of many molecular players involved in myogenesis...|$|E
40|$|We {{have used}} three inbreds of Zea mays in our in situ and {{laboratory}} studies in environmental mutagenesis. Inbred W 22 plants homozygous for wx-C {{were used in}} a study to detect the possible mutagenic properties of 32 pesticides or combination of pesticides under modern agricultural conditions. The large numbers of pollen grains analyzed and the ease in detecting mutant pollen grains enabled us to treat the experimental plants with field recommended rates of pesticides. In a current study we are evaluating the possible mutagenicity of Chicago municipal sewage sludge. We are measuring the frequency of mutant pollen grains in inbred M 14 at both the wx-C and wx- 90 heteroalleles. These plants were exposed to various concentrations of municipal sewage sludge under field conditions. We have inbred Early-Early Synthetic for five generations and tested this inbred with known mutagens. Early-Early Synthetic is a rapidly maturing inbred growing from kernel to anthesis in approximately 4 weeks and attaining a height of approximately 50 cm. Plants of this inbred have been chronically treated with <b>ethylmethanesulfonate</b> (EMS) or maleic hydrazide (MH) under laboratory conditions and forward mutation at the wx locus was measured in the pollen grains. EMS and MH were mutagenic at concentrations of 1 microM and 10 nM, respectively. The concentrations of EMS and MH were calibrated in Early-Early Synthetic to a linear increase {{in the frequency of}} forward mutant pollen grains. The construction of a maize monitor for environmental mutagens is currently in progress. This assay will measure forward or reverse mutation at the wx locus in pollen grains, point mutation in somatic cells and will incorporate a cytogenetic endpoint in root-tip cells...|$|E
