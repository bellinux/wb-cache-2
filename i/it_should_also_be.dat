5|$|Although {{sections}} 8 and 10 of the ISA concern {{matters of}} national security, the Court held that this concern {{does not preclude}} the objective review of executive discretion. Following the case of Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service (1983), the Court of Appeal decided that {{it is up to}} the courts to determine whether a decision is in fact based on grounds of national security. Similarly, <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> within the court's purview to determine whether the matters relied upon in exercising powers under the ISA fall within the scope of purposes specified by sections8 and 10.|$|E
5|$|As {{indicated}} in the table below, each basin uses a separate system of terminology, which can make comparisons between different basins difficult. In the Pacific Ocean, hurricanes from the Central North Pacific sometimes cross the 180th meridian into the Northwest Pacific, becoming typhoons (such as Hurricane/Typhoon Ioke in 2006); on rare occasions, the reverse will occur. <b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> noted that typhoons with 1-minute sustained winds greater than 67 metres per second (m/s), over , are called Super Typhoons by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.|$|E
5|$|Cultivation {{from seed}} may be {{difficult}} or easy, depending on the species. The more difficult species to grow include the ones that require a period of dormancy or smoke treatment to simulate a bushfire. Stylidium specimens should be grown in a medium that is kept moist and has a relatively low concentration of nutrients. <b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> noted that {{they appear to be}} sensitive to disturbance of their root systems. Minimization of such disturbance will likely result in healthier plants.|$|E
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>also</b> not <b>be</b> {{confused}} with the Lenin Prize.|$|R
5000|$|<b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>also</b> not <b>be</b> {{confused}} with a pseudoaneurysm, coronary artery aneurysm or a myocardial rupture (which involves {{a hole in}} the wall, not just a bulge.) ...|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>also</b> not <b>be</b> {{confused}} with horizontal gene transfer, {{a process in}} which an organism incorporates genetic material from another organism without being the offspring of that organism.|$|R
5|$|In addition, other {{characters}} have supporting roles {{in this game}} as well. Lakitu reprises {{his role as the}} referee, helping racers in various situations such as announcing laps, giving the signal to drive with its traffic lights hanging on a fishing pole, and taking characters back on track in case they fall off course. Other supporting characters appearing in this game include Shy Guys, Goombas, Nokis, Toadsworth, Piantas, Chain Chomps, Piranha Plants and more. <b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> noted that this is the very first time that Toadette has appeared in the Mario franchise.|$|E
5|$|The inert pair {{effects in}} livermorium should be even {{stronger}} than for polonium {{and hence the}} +2 oxidation state becomes more stable than the +4 state, which would be stabilized only by the most electronegative ligands; this {{is reflected in the}} expected ionization energies of livermorium, where there are large gaps between the second and third ionization energies (corresponding to the breaching of the unreactive 7p1/2 shell) and fourth and fifth ionization energies. Indeed, the 7s electrons are expected to be so inert that the +6 state will not be possible to attain. The melting and boiling points of livermorium are expected to continue the trends down the chalcogens; thus livermorium should melt at a higher temperature than polonium, but boil at a lower temperature. <b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> denser than polonium (α-Lv: 12.9g/cm3; α-Po: 9.2g/cm3); like polonium it should also form an α and a β allotrope. The electron of the hydrogen-like livermorium atom (oxidized so that it only has one electron, Lv115+) is expected to move so fast that it has a mass 1.86 times that of a stationary electron, due to relativistic effects. For comparison, the figures for hydrogen-like polonium and tellurium are expected to be 1.26 and 1.080 respectively.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> {{noted that}} GWR's oldies service was {{originally}} called Brunel Classic Gold, after the Great Western Railway's founding father Isambard Kingdom Brunel.|$|E
50|$|When {{gathering}} the requirements {{from the business}} users, the local <b>IT</b> department <b>should</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> consulted {{in order to determine}} to which degree it is possible to fulfill the business's needs based on the available data.|$|R
50|$|The <b>IT</b> {{strategy}} <b>should</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> {{presented to}} or read by internal IT staff members. Many organizations circulate prior year versions to internal IT staff members for feedback before new annual IT strategy plans are created.|$|R
5000|$|<b>It's</b> <b>should</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> {{noted that}} Angelica's the one kid that's {{had the most}} romantic love interests. In [...] "Angelica's In Love" [...] Angelica {{develops}} her first crush on a boy named Dean and tries even being nice to gain his affection. Although she does in the end, their romance is quickly over when Dean's mother comes to take him home. But Angelica finds a new love interest in her new neighbor Jean-Claude, who apparently returns the affections. She also developed a crush on Timmy McNulty, however he's more interested in games than her. Much to her own personal annoyance.|$|R
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> {{noted that}} correctional {{officers}} at Central Booking were {{rumored to be}} on a work slowdown during this time. Corrections personnel are prohibited from striking.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> {{noted that}} the amine {{solution}} {{to and from the}} recycle gas contactor comes from and is returned to the refinery's main amine gas treating unit.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> {{remembered that}} there are further courts at the Rolls Building, which come under the wing of the Law Courts and are within short walking distance.|$|E
25|$|<b>Its</b> use <b>should</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> avoided {{in those}} {{receiving}} other serotonergic {{drugs such as}} monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, methamphetamine, MDMA, triptans, buspirone, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors and other SSRIs due to the potential for serotonin syndrome to develop as a result.|$|R
25|$|Flucloxacillin is {{contraindicated}} {{in those}} with a previous history of allergy to penicillins, cephalosporins, or carbapenems. <b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>also</b> not <b>be</b> used in the eye, or administered to those {{with a history of}} cholestatic hepatitis {{associated with the use of}} dicloxacillin or flucloxacillin.|$|R
50|$|It {{is a kind}} of {{follow-on}} programme to ODAS, {{which had}} to close due to lack of further financial support. <b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>also</b> not <b>be</b> confused with the Uppsala-DLR Trojan Survey (UDTS), which was conducted a few years before UDAS was launched.|$|R
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> noted that, like in Highway Patrol before it, {{several of}} this {{generation}} Century appeared in the US television series Kojak, driven by Telly Savalas and other squadroom members.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> {{noted that}} Bianca Acquaye-Froese, Edgar's widow, {{has taken up}} the mantle of {{continuing}} {{the legacy of the}} group and works closely in a non-musical capacity with the remaining members.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> {{noted that}} the Qing court {{exercised}} effective sovereignty over primarily {{the west coast of}} Taiwan only, and even then did not regard the area {{as an integral part of}} national Chinese territory.|$|E
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>also</b> not <b>be</b> {{confused}} with AMP-activated protein kinase - which, although {{a member of}} the protein kinase superfamily and a Ser/Thr kinase, may have opposite effects - nor be {{confused with}} cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks), nor be confused with the acid dissociation constant pKa.|$|R
50|$|Rovers F.C. {{should not}} be {{confused}} with other Scottish teams of the same name, such as Rovers F.C. (1872-1882) in Edinburgh, or Rovers F.C. (1888-1889) in the Scottish Highlands. <b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>also</b> not <b>be</b> confused with Rovers A.C. from Havana, Cuba, formed in 1909.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>should,</b> perhaps, <b>also</b> <b>be</b> {{mentioned}} that Lord Rotherwood's greatest friend <b>was</b> <b>also</b> Lilias's favourite brother, Claude, {{who had become}} a clergyman and died early. Aunt Adeline had been the spoilt child and beauty of the family, the youngest of all.|$|R
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> {{understood}} {{that a change}} in the TCCB (Test and County Cricket Board) regulations meant that only one overseas player would be allowed in each county team rather than two as previously – meaning that Somerset {{would not be able to}} field both Richards and Garner.|$|E
25|$|The figures below {{come from}} Eurostat (2013) and are denoted in Euros, it notes the {{economic}} position of Scottish regions {{in terms of}} GDP and GDP per capita. <b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> noted that the Scottish figures exclude offshore oil revenue. There are 26 areas in the UK where the GDP per person is under €20,000.|$|E
25|$|According to the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics, as of 2005, 650,000 Israelis {{had left}} the country for over one year and not returned. Of them, 530,000 are still alive today. This number {{does not include the}} {{children}} born overseas. <b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> noted that Israeli law grants citizenship only to the first generation of children born to Israeli emigrants.|$|E
50|$|XGA {{should not}} be {{confused}} with EVGA (Extended Video Graphics Array), a contemporaneous VESA standard that also has 1024×768 pixels. <b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>also</b> not <b>be</b> confused with the Expanded Graphics Adapter, a peripheral for the IBM 3270 PC which can <b>also</b> <b>be</b> referred to as XGA.|$|R
25|$|MSA is {{distinct}} from multisystem proteinopathy, a more common muscle wasting syndrome. <b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>also</b> not <b>be</b> confused with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (sometimes referred to as multiple organ failure), or with multiple organ system failure (an often-fatal complication of septic shock or other very severe illnesses or injuries).|$|R
50|$|Burt Castle {{is located}} just across Lough Swilly on the mainland, {{and this has}} {{sometimes}} led to the two being confused in historical accounts. <b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>also</b> not <b>be</b> confused with Inch Fort, a much later development on {{the northern tip of}} the island which <b>is</b> now <b>also</b> in ruins.|$|R
25|$|Batting averages in One Day International (ODI) cricket tend to {{be lower}} than in Test cricket, {{because of the need}} to score runs more quickly and take riskier strokes and the lesser {{emphasis}} on building a large innings. <b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> remembered, especially in relation to the ODI histogram above, that there were no ODI competitions when Bradman played.|$|E
25|$|To avoid confusion, the {{efficiency}} of heat engines and power stations should be stated relative to the Higher Heating Value (HHV) or Lower Heating Value (LHV) of the fuel, to include or exclude the heat that {{can be obtained from}} condensing the flue gas. <b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> specified whether Gross output at the generator terminals or Net Output at the power station fence is being considered.|$|E
25|$|Each cell {{division}} from a spermatogonium to a spermatid is incomplete; the cells remain connected {{to one another}} by bridges of cytoplasm to allow synchronous development. <b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> noted that not all spermatogonia divide to produce spermatocytes; otherwise, the supply of spermatogonia would run out. Instead, spermatogonial stem cells divide mitotically to produce copies of themselves, ensuring a constant supply of spermatogonia to fuel spermatogenesis.|$|E
50|$|Tea {{seed oil}} {{should not be}} mistaken for tea tree oil (melaleuca oil), an {{inedible}} essential oil extracted from {{the leaves of the}} paperbark, Melaleuca alternifolia, and used for medicinal purposes. <b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>also</b> not <b>be</b> mistaken for Camellia oil pressed from seeds of Camellia japonica, also known as Tsubaki oil.|$|R
50|$|He {{wrote a book}} {{entitled}} Méthode complète pour le trombone in three volumes published in 1921 (first two volumes) and 1946 (third volume). In it he famously describes the practise of playing with vibrato as vulgar and glissandos of questionable taste. <b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> apparent that the French trombones of the period could not play the fifth partial D in tune in the closed slide position (1st) so 4th position is used more frequently. There are just three pages of an appendix to cover the bass trombone.|$|R
5000|$|... snoR66 was {{identified}} by a computational {{screening of the}} rice Oryza sativa genome and is proposed to acts as a methylation guide for 18S ribosomal RNA in plants. [...] Rice snoR66 has <b>also</b> <b>been</b> alternatively named snoZ269. <b>Its</b> <b>should</b> <b>also</b> not <b>be</b> confused with the snoRNA identified in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and called snR66.|$|R
