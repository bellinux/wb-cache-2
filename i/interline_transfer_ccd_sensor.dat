These systems would typically use eight channels of MCP-CCD imagers, yielding an eight frame sequence at speeds up to 200 million fps.

40|$|Structured {{illumination}} (SI), {{which is}} an imaging technique that is employed {{in a variety of}} fields, permits unique possibilities to suppress unwanted signal contributions that carry misguiding information such as out-of-focus light or multiply scattered light. So far SI has been applied mostly for averaged imaging or for imaging of slowly occurring events because it requires three acquisitions (subimages) to construct the final SI image. This prerequisite puts technological constraints on SI that make "instantaneous" imaging of fast transient processes (occurring on sub-microsecond time scales) very challenging and expensive. Operating SI with fewer subimages generates errors in the form of residual lines that stretch across the image. Here, a new approach that circumvents this limiting factor is presented and experimentally demonstrated. By judiciously choosing the intensity modulation, it is possible to extract an SI image from two subimages only.

Spectral interferogram templates, representing axial measurement positions are generated using a simple simulation of the optical apparatus. These templates are cross-correlated against a spectral interferogram generated from the DRI apparatus.

40|$|Two new technologies, for {{polishing}} {{and testing}} large optics, {{are presented in}} this dissertation. The first is {{a new approach to}} generating and polishing aspheric surfaces which utilizes a full size stressed lap. The lap specifications are chosen to automatically generate a specific amount of spherical aberration. The required comatic distortion of the lap is induced by a system of levers and springs which are stretched and relaxed as the lap moves. A lap was constructed to grind and polish a 20 cm glass blank. The resultant polished surface, in agreement with the predicted asphericity, has 28 microns of spherical aberration at its edge, appropriate for a F/ 2. 0 convex paraboloid. The average radial profile has a residual peak-to-valley error of 200 nm and an rms error of 60 nm. This experiment serves as a first successful test of the stressed lap concept and as a demonstration of a new method for generating aspheric secondary mirrors. The second new technology is concerned with testing large optics where vibrations can be a serious problem. A modification to the usual phase shifting interferometry reduction algorithm permits measurements to be taken fast enough to essentially freeze out vibrations. Only two interferograms are needed with an exact phase relationship; and these can be recorded very rapidly {{on either side of the}} <b>interline</b> <b>transfer</b> of a standard CCD video camera, prior to charge transfer readout. The third required interferogram is a null. An analysis of potential phase errors was performed for this " 2 + 1 " algorithm. In the developed implementation, two frequencies, dν/ν≈ 10 ⁻⁸, are generated with orthogonal polarizations. A Pockels cell rapidly switches the frequency entering the interferometer, resulting in a phase shift over the long path difference of the interferometer. The two time critical interferograms are acquired with a 1 ms separation resulting in a reduction in sensitivity to vibration of one to two orders of magnitude. Laboratory tests were performed to compare this " 2 + 1 " system with a commercial phase shifting package. Similar phase determination accuracies were found when vibrations were low. However, the " 2 + 1 " system also succeeded when vibrations were large enough to wash out video rate fringes...|$|R

Urban freeways are the backbone of the highway transportation system and the demand on this system is growing. The increase in demand creates an increase in traffic congestion. Past construction solutions to relieve congestion are less viable today due to rising costs and government regulations. Effectively managing the operations of the existing highway transportation network is an alternative for congestion mitigation. The research documented in this study analyzes a trip-wire video image processing system's ability and limitations in accurately detecting passenger cars with and without passenger cars traveling in the adjacent travel lane. This study also analvzes a video image processing system's ability to determine passenger car speeds. Testing was performed at Texas A&M University's Riverside Campus research facility. Testing analyzed three camera heights, 30 feet, 40 feet and 49 feet- 6 inches, in conjunction with three passenger car speeds, 20 mph, 45 mph and 55 mph. The video image processing system used in the study was the Autoscop 0 m 2004 by Image Sensing Systems, Inc. The camera imaging device was a one-half (1 / 2) inch <b>interline</b> <b>transfer</b> microlens charged coupled device (CCD). The camera lens was a six (6) mm, fl. 2 auto ifis lens. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) test indicated both camera height and travel lane location affected the system's ability to accurately detect passenger cars. Generally, higher camera heights and travel lanes farther from the camera produced accurate passenger car detection farther upstream from the camera. Also, it was determined that passenger cars traveling in adjacent travel lanes did not significantly influence the video image processing system's ability to accurately detect passenger cars. The paired t-test indicated that passenger car speeds determined by the video image processing system were significantly different when compared to passenger car speeds obtained by a radar speed gun.

50|$|The {{standard}} CMOS APS pixel today {{consists of}} a photodetector (a pinned photodiode), a floating diffusion, a transfer gate, reset gate, selection gate and source-follower readout transistor—the so-called 4T cell. The pinned photodiode was originally used in <b>interline</b> <b>transfer</b> CCDs due to its low dark current and good blue response, and when coupled with the transfer gate, allows complete charge transfer from the pinned photodiode to the floating diffusion (which is further connected to {{the gate of the}} read-out transistor) eliminating lag. The use of intrapixel charge transfer can offer lower noise by enabling the use of correlated double sampling (CDS). The Noble 3T pixel is still sometimes used since the fabrication requirements are easier. The 3T pixel comprises the same elements as the 4T pixel except the transfer gate and the photodiode. The reset transistor, Mrst, acts as a switch to reset the floating diffusion which acts in this case as the photodiode. When the reset transistor is turned on, the photodiode is effectively connected to the power supply, VRST, clearing all integrated charge. Since the reset transistor is n-type, the pixel operates in soft reset. The read-out transistor, Msf, acts as a buffer (specifically, a source follower), an amplifier which allows the pixel voltage to be observed without removing the accumulated charge. Its power supply, VDD, is typically tied to the power supply of the reset transistor. The select transistor, Msel, allows a single row of the pixel array to be read by the read-out electronics. Other innovations of the pixels such as 5T and 6T pixels also exist. By adding extra transistors, functions such as global shutter, as opposed to the more common rolling shutter, are possible. In order to increase the pixel densities, shared-row, four-ways and eight-ways shared read out, and other architectures can be employed. A variant of the 3T active pixel is the Foveon X3 sensor invented by Dick Merrill. In this device, three photodiodes are stacked {{on top of each other}} using planar fabrication techniques, each photodiode having its own 3T circuit. Each successive layer acts as a filter for the layer below it shifting the spectrum of absorbed light in successive layers. By deconvolving the response of each layered detector, red, green, and blue signals can be reconstructed.|$|R

This study finds that for <b>CC</b> <b>transfer</b> students to have the best chances of graduating with an engineering degree, they need to adopt the social integration strategies offered at the CC, join a learning community at the university, and focus on being successful in the core engineering courses, either at the CC or at the university...|$|R
40|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} are the hotspots of current research and have very wide application prospects. Its front end is a sensor that can sense {{and check the}} external world. This paper takes temperature and humidity as the research object, and builds a wireless sensor network data acquisition platform by combining the Internet of things and the WeChat public platform. The platform uses DHT 11 temperature and humidity <b>sensors</b> and <b>CC</b> 2538 <b>sensor</b> nodes to obtain the relevant data, through the server and database for data access. The combination with WeChat public platform not only allows us to view the temperature and humidity in the WeChat public, but also allows us to understand the environmental changes of the relevant detection area more conveniently and quickly. The effectiveness of the platform is also demonstrated by the collection of temperature and humidity data...|$|R
