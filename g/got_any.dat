5|$|Free flight {{lasted for}} 10 hours and 29 minutes and was {{followed}} by another 41 hours of bumpy ride with frequent ground contact before the inevitable final crash. The Eagle traveled for 2 days and 3½ hours altogether, during which time, according to Andrée, {{none of the three}} men <b>got</b> <b>any</b> sleep. The definitive landing appears to have been gentle. Neither the men nor the homing pigeons in their wicker cages were hurt, and none of the equipment was damaged, not even the delicate optical instruments and Strindberg's two cameras.|$|E

25|$|In the 1940s, the New Jersey Department of Transportation {{planned to}} link a spur route then called Route S4B from Paramus up though Bergen County {{to connect with}} NY208 at Monroe. The road never <b>got</b> <b>any</b> further than Oakland, but it was renumbered to Route208 in 1953.|$|E
25|$|Graham McKenzie - with 100 Test wickets to him name {{before the}} series started {{and at the}} age of 24 - was a fine bowler with a model action, and he and Neil Hawke made a good opening pair, as they had done in England. But they {{scarcely}} <b>got</b> <b>any</b> support worthy of the name.|$|E
25|$|Warner Bros. {{cartoons}} sometimes caricatured Gable. Examples include Have You <b>Got</b> <b>Any</b> Castles? (in {{which his}} face appears seven times inside the novel The House of the Seven Gables), The Coo-Coo Nut Grove (in which his ears flap on their own), Hollywood Steps Out ({{in which he}} follows an enigmatic woman), and Cats Don't Dance in which he appears on a billboard promotion for Gone With The Wind.|$|E

25|$|McLeod played {{every game}} of the season in a once again, superb season. He would lead the 2003 Brownlow medal count until round 15, remarkably having 6 best on ground, 3 vote games. McLeod never <b>got</b> <b>any</b> more votes and would finish 4th with 18 votes, albeit behind 9 other players which had 3 winners {{including}} teammate Mark Ricciuto. He would finish 3rd in the Adelaide best and fairest.|$|E
25|$|Imported Chinese labourers {{arrived in}} 1810, {{reaching}} {{a peak of}} 618 in 1818, after which numbers were reduced. Only a few older men remained after the British Crown took over {{the government of the}} island from the East India Company in 1834. The majority were sent back to China, although records in the Cape suggest that they never <b>got</b> <b>any</b> farther than Cape Town. There were also a very few Indian lascars who worked under the harbour master.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the railway}} was {{successful}} in technical and service terms, it is doubtful whether the shareholders <b>got</b> <b>any</b> of their money back and Brogdens had invested a lot. Out of 8,678 shares issued (as of August 1866), Alexander had taken 792. By November 1867 £150,000 had been raised by shares and only £2,600 by debentures. In October 1868, shareholders funds were unchanged but debentures stood at £180,000, loans £17,500 and creditors at £65,000. It follows that Alexander's share investment, now lost, had been about £13,700, plus one share of £1,000 in the Mont Cenis Concessionary Company which had been formed earlier to negotiate concessions from the two governments.|$|E

25|$|After the Eagles broke up, {{the former}} members pursued solo careers. Elektra, the band's long-time record label, owned {{the rights to}} solo albums created {{by members of the}} Eagles (though several of them moved to {{different}} labels in ensuing years). Walsh had established himself as a solo artist in the 1970s, before and during his time with the Eagles, but it was uncharted waters for the others. Walsh released a successful album in 1981, There Goes the Neighborhood, but subsequent albums throughout the 1980s, such as <b>Got</b> <b>Any</b> Gum? were less well received. During this period Walsh performed as a session musician for Dan Fogelberg, Steve Winwood, John Entwistle, Richard Marx and Emerson, Lake & Palmer, among others, and produced and co-wrote Ringo Starr's Old Wave album.|$|E
25|$|Park also notched up {{some fine}} {{performances}} for Victoria, and soon earned a Test call-up in the 1920–1921 season. He was unsuccessful in his debut against England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG), making a first-ball duck in his only innings, and bowling a single over of off-spinners which went for nine runs. He {{was said to}} have been called late during the night for medical duties, and not to have <b>got</b> <b>any</b> sleep before his debut. He never played Test cricket again. Legend has it that his wife, who was watching in the stands, dropped her knitting as he prepared to face his first ball, bent down to retrieve it at the moment of delivery, and thus missed his entire Test career.|$|E
500|$|Although {{many of the}} {{individual}} matches on the One Night Stand card were announced weeks before the pay-per-view occurred, none of them <b>got</b> <b>any</b> build-up on any of WWE's weekly programs, with WWE choosing to focus on an [...] "invasion" [...] angle, with several Raw and SmackDown! superstars feuding against wrestlers from the original ECW.|$|E

"If you bind {{me so that}} I am {{unable to}} release myself, then you will be {{standing}} by {{in such a way}} that I should have to wait a long time before I <b>got</b> <b>any</b> help from you.

500|$|Oxford's Bowden was dumbstruck: [...] "I'm really floored. [...] I just haven't <b>got</b> <b>any</b> answers until I {{talk to the}} crew." [...] His number four, Toby Ayer admitted: [...] "my {{impression}} {{is that they were}} quicker than us and that is a very hard thing to have to say." [...] Cambridge's Williams noted: [...] "I {{thought it would be a}} bit more competitive than that."

500|$|... "Mansize Rooster" [...] {{is said to}} {{be about}} a young boy with a large penis, {{although}} this is not obvious from the lyrics. Gaz Coombes once stated in an interview that [...] "the most embarrassing moment in pop is on our album where it goes: 'Oi Mum! <b>Got</b> <b>any</b> mandies?'" [...] This was one of the many exclamations made between tracks on I Should Coco in the sped-up voices of the band members. It was said before the song [...] "We're Not Supposed To" [...] began.|$|E

500|$|Carey {{provided}} the entertainment for the 2002 Annual White House correspondents' dinner. Once Carey completed his stand-up routine for the 1,800 guests, President George W. Bush, noting Carey's improv work, {{made a joke}} of his own: [...] "Drew? <b>Got</b> <b>any</b> interest in the Middle East?" [...] In 2003, he joined Jamie Kennedy to host the WB's live special Play for a Billion. In September 2003, Carey led a group of comedians, including Blake Clark and The Drew Carey Shows Kathy Kinney, on a comedy tour of Iraq.|$|E
500|$|Watts: I'll {{tell you}} why I think he feels it. The mantras, the images of Krishna have in this culture no foul association.... hen {{somebody}} comes in from the Orient with a new religion which hasn't <b>got</b> <b>any</b> of these [...] associations in our minds, all the words are new, all the rites are new, and yet, somehow it has feeling in it, {{and we can get}} with that, you see, and we can dig that! Ginsberg agreed {{to take part in the}} Mantra-Rock Dance concert and to introduce the swami to the Haight-Ashbury hippie community.|$|E
500|$|From 1958 to 1959 Williamson {{worked for}} Harvey Comics collaborating with former EC artists Reed Crandall, Torres and Krenkel and inking the pencils of Jack Kirby (for Race to the Moon #2–3 and Blast-Off #1). [...] On inking Kirby, Williamson relates: [...] "I {{remember}} {{going up to}} Harvey and getting work there. They said, 'We haven't <b>got</b> <b>any</b> work for you, but we have some stories here that Jack penciled. Do you want to ink them?' I'd never really inked anybody else before, but I said, 'Sure,' because I looked at the stuff, and thought, I can follow this, it's all there. I inked it and they liked it, and they gave me three or four stories to do." ...|$|E
