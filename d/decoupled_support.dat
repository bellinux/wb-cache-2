40|$|In {{addressing}} the National Union of Farmers in the UK on February 18 th 2003, Commissioner Fischler raised directly a major apparent contradiction in EU policy, namely 'how can EU agriculture simultaneously be competitive {{on the world}} markets, competing at lower prices, while producing at higher costs and meeting our high environmental, food quality, or animal welfare standards?' Commissioner Fischler maintained that the proposed trajectory for reform offered the vehicle for reconciling these seemingly contradictory objectives, since it would {{bridge the gap between}} EU and world market prices by shifting support from products to producers. He cited developments in the cereals sector as an excellent example of what could be achieved, pointing out that Europe's interest lay in selling food products rather than basic raw materials. He admitted that this constituted the key interface with the WTO negotiations, and that unfortunately the current Harbinson proposals (see above) were not consistent with EU objectives. Comment: Implicit in Commissioner Fischler's presentation to the NFU was that the shift to <b>decoupled</b> <b>support</b> would cover both the income losses arising from price reductions and the extra costs associated with meeting the higher standards which the EU was now setting for its food products. Ensuring a WTO agreement which allows <b>decoupled</b> <b>support</b> programmes to carry these costs is a key objective of the EU in the current agricultural negotiations.

40|$|AbstractFused Filament Fabrication (FFF) is an {{additive}} manufacturing (AM) method {{that relies on}} the thermal extrusion of a thermoplastic feedstock from a mobile deposition head. Conventional FFF constructs components from stacks of individual extruded layers using tool paths with fixed z-values in each individual layer. Consequently, the manufactured components often contain inherent weaknesses in the z-axis due to the relatively weak thermal fusion bonding that occurs between individual layers, as well as poor surface finish in shallow sloped contours. This study demonstrates the use of Curved Layer FFF (CLFFF) tool paths in tandem with a commercially available parallel, or delta, style FFF system to allow the deposition head to follow the topology of the component. By incorporating a delta robot and CLFFF tool paths in this way, improvements in the surface finish of the manufactured parts has been observed, and time costs associated with Cartesian robot based CLFFF manufacturing have been notably reduced. Furthermore, employing a delta robot provides additional flexibility to CLFFF manufacturing and increases the feasibility of its application for advanced manufacturing. The study has also demonstrated a viable approach to multi-material FFF by <b>decoupling</b> <b>support</b> structure and part manufacture into regions of CLFFF and static z tool pathing in an appropriate fashion...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of the first SAM analysis of the agricultural sector in Italy. A SAM of the Italian economy has been properly modified in order to focus the analysis on agriculture. Two type of analysis have been carried out: (i) a multiplier analysis, and (ii) an assessment of the distributive impacts of different agricultural policies. This paper proposes also a new method for disaggregating the institutional sectors and production factors in order to analyze income distribution within the economy, with special emphasis on the agricultural sector. Main results are: (i) "fully" <b>decoupled</b> income <b>supporting</b> schemes (transfers to agricultural households) are the most equitable interventions and determine a perfect targeting of the distributive effect on the relevant institutional sectors; (ii) "partially" <b>decoupled</b> income <b>supporting</b> interventions, as the ones implemented under the current CAP, are more effective than others in indirectly (i. e., through multiplier effects) generating positive impacts on the income of agricultural households; (iii) agricultural price support interventions show less desirable effects in terms of their distributive impacts: they are less effective as agricultural income-increasing policies and their distributive impacts are biased against poorer households both in agricultural and non-agricultural sectors.

DNA sequence was isolated from the WT 1, AMH, DMRT 1, FoxG 1 and 28 S. No variation was present in Sphenodon 28 S, FoxG 1 or AMH sequence. 28 S could be dated to a common ancestor with Testudines, similar to the archaic karyotype. FoxG 1 and AMH reflect an Oligocene divergence, WT 1 divides north-eastern North Island and Cook Strait, and can be dated to the Pleistocene or the Pliocene, and DMRT 1 appears a recent post- pliocene divergence.

This paper reports the main findings of interdisciplinary research (the Olivero project) {{carried out in}} five target areas in southern Europe.

Of the external factors affecting the semi-intensive system, the paper focuses on changes in EU policies and on the role of local government and farmers’ associations in reducing the negative impacts of entirely <b>decoupled</b> <b>support</b> to the olive sector. Moreover, the analysis of constraints indicates that the semi-intensive system requires the supply of alternative technologies in order to improve resources conservation (soil, organic matter, and water).

30|$|All of {{the farmers}} had entered the farm into {{agri-environment}} schemes during the preceding 20 years. All farms had also {{been affected by the}} introduction of the Single Farm Payment, the <b>decoupled</b> <b>support</b> introduced in 2005, which, as explained earlier, removed the link between farm support and stock numbers. In response to these two factors, many farmers had adjusted the farming system. For others, a move to fewer hardy hill stock has been a response to the payment opportunities presented by agri-environment schemes as reductions in stocking levels per hectare, notably on the moorland areas of the farm, are required under the schemes. The reductions have been significant with three farmers no longer grazing the moor and a further four reducing their livestock by at least half. As one farmer put it ‘having a few stock on the moor, now, it just isn’t worth it – labour or stock-quality wise’. Decoupling, and the introduction of an area-based payment that is not linked to production, has also increased the relative attractiveness of this option. In almost half of all interview cases, the consequence of this has been a significant change in the emphasis of the overall land management.|$|E

40|$|In 2005, Germany {{implemented}} the Single Payment Scheme {{which lead to}} the conversion of direct payments into tradable, production decoupled, single farm payments. The transition from coupled to <b>decoupled</b> <b>support</b> instruments may impact the rate of structural change. The rate of structural change may accelerate since farms with a high share of income derived from CAP payments will abandon farming and lease their land. However, there are also good reasons why the rate of structural change might decrease especially if farmers do not behave as profit maximizers. In Germany agricultural land use is very heterogeneous with respect to management orientation and productivity even at local level. Most of the concerns related to structural change and development of land use intensity, e. g. abandonment of high nature value farmland, are only relevant in a very specific local context. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} establish indicators for farm development on adisaggregated level. The objective of this paper is twofold. First, we derive criteria and threshold values to classify regions according to their respective natural, socio economic conditions and land use. Second, we evaluate the stability of the link between a set of explanatory variables and the rate of structural change at different spatial scales. Our results indicate that only for a few variables a generally valid link between them and the rate of structural change can be established.

In order to adapt to the requirements of the WTO, the order of distribution and the provision of subsidies to <b>decoupled</b> <b>support</b> to farmers in crop production (per hectare subsidies) was introduced in Russia since the beginning of 2013. These payments are directed to the compensation of the costs for the purchase of fertilizers and plant protection chemicals, financing measures to improve soil fertility and soil quality. The order of per hectare subsidies to farmers in specific subject of the Russian Federation is fixed on regional legislative level. In addition, each region has the right to establish its own criteria for budget allocation. The main conditions of the subsidy per hectare in the Krasnodar region are sown area under crops, the area sown to perennial grasses, and the area on which organic fertilizers have ever been put.

The two important legislative actions were {{the passage of the}} 2002 Farm Bill and the passage of Trade Promotion Authority, which provides for "fast track" treatment of trade agreements. The 2002 farm bill was widely denounced as a major reversal of US farm policy, away from the earlier move toward reduced levels of <b>support</b> and toward <b>decoupled</b> <b>supports</b> for key commodities. In fact, however, the 2002 farm bill contained the same support mechanisms that were in the highly touted 1996 farm bill.

The Trade Promotion Authority contains several new restrictions on US negotiators. It lays out a list of sensitive agricultural products and requires special procedures before any negotiations to liberalize access can occur. In addition to the list of sensitive products the US has some significant tariffs on a number of products that the Central American countries export to the US.

Farmers find such change problematic. To understand how change is being experienced and understood in the {{farming industry}} three empirical studies were undertaken: semi-structured interviews with farmers; narrative interviews with others in the agricultural public sphere; and a content analysis of Farmers Weekly, circulating in the agricultural industry, and The Times, circulating among the general public. Analysis was qualitative, using thematic and content analysis and incorporating the computer programmes ALCESTE and NVIVO. The results indicate that change is problematic for 3 reasons. Firstly, farmers' identity and self-esteem as producers are being challenged. Secondly, farmers are receiving contradictory messages as to what their role should be. Thirdly, government involvement in the farming industry has created a 'learned helplessness' which impedes farmers' agency to cope with change. The findings demonstrate the use of social representations theory in an applied social setting. They suggest that the structural approach places too much emphasis on the stability of the core of a representation. Observations made during the research are used to argue for a social psychology of change which will enable the discipline to become more adept at investigating and addressing the problems of contemporary society...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{completes the}} {{comparative}} {{analysis of the}} investment demand behaviour, of a sample of specialised arable crop farms, for farm buildings and machinery and equipment, {{as a function of}} the different types and levels of Common Agricultural Policy support, in selected European Union Member States. This contribution focuses on their quantitative interdependence calculating the relevant elasticity measures. In turn, they constitute the methodological tool to simulate the percentage expected change in average net investment levels associated to the implementation of the, recently proposed and currently under discussion, reductions in the Pillar I Direct Payments disbursed under the Common Agricultural Policy. Evidence suggests a statistically significant elastic and inelastic relationship between both types of subsidies and the investment levels for both asset classes in Germany and Italy, respectively. An elastic dependence of investment in farm buildings on decoupled subsidies exists in Hungary while changes in the level of coupled payments appear to translate into less than proportional changes in the demand for both farm buildings and machinery and equipment in France. Coupled payments appear to influence the UK demand for both asset classes in an elastic manner while <b>decoupled</b> <b>support</b> seems to induce a similar effect on investment in machinery and equipment. Since the currently discussed Common Agricultural Policy reform options imply, almost exclusively, a reduction in the level of support granted through Direct Payments, simulated effects were expected to reveal a worsening of the farm investment prospects for both asset types (i. e., a larger negative investment or a smaller positive one). The actual evidence largely respects this expectation with the sole exception of investment in machinery and equipment in France and Italy reaching smaller negative or larger positive levels irrespectively of the magnitude of the implemented cuts in Direct Payments...|$|E
40|$|The {{implementation}} of the latest CAP review in the EU New Member States (NMS) represents not only {{a change in the}} form of payments (from fully coupled to partially decoupled payments) but also an increase in the level of payments received by farmers. It is expected that farm restructuring in the NMS will be accelerated as greater payments, given with no obligation to produce, might allow those farmers who are willing to exit the farming sector to get the required funds to do so. If so, this might also give those farmers willing to increase the size of their farm more opportunities to expand. However, the transition to a market economy in these countries being still quite recent, the conditions under which the policy is implemented present some specificity as markets are likely to be less than perfect. The objective of the paper is to understand what impact the change in policy will have in one of the NMS, namely Slovakia, taking into account the impact of some potential market imperfections. This question is considered by assessing commercial individual farmers’ willingness to increase their scale of farming. The investigation focuses on land only, and will be based on the intention of Slovak farmers to alter the land area they intend to farm in the future, in the context of continuing pre-accession policy (fully coupled support) and the Single Area Payment Scheme (SAPS, partially <b>decoupled</b> <b>support).</b> The determinants of the willingness to expand are estimated under different policy scenarios, as well as the determinants of a change in willingness to expand across scenarios. The analysis reveals that the determinants of the willingness to expand differ under coupled and decoupled policy as in particular the level of human capital does not seem to matter under SAPS. However, the introduction of SAPS might not greatly influence farm restructuring in Slovakia. Due to a less than perfect land market, farmers will have increased incentives to expand their farm and increased incentives to remain in farming. This means that farmers, despite their willingness to grow, {{might not be able to}} do so as land supplied by exiting individual farmers is unlikely to increase. However, the future supply of land also depends on the dynamism of other types of farms such as corporate farms...|$|E
40|$|The 2003 reform {{represents}} a significant {{shift in the}} EU policy, particularly in its movement to <b>decoupled</b> <b>support.</b> The potential impact of the reform depends {{on a range of}} factors including the modalities of its implementation and the structure of farming sectors in different countries. The then acceding countries had the flexibility to choose to implement the Single Payment Scheme (SPS) or to opt for the simplified Single Area Payment Scheme (SAPS). This paper attempts to provide a comparative overview of the level and distributional aspects of direct payments across seven New Member States (NMS) covering different sub-regions, the Baltics, Central and Eastern Europe, and the two most recent Member States from the Balkans – Bulgaria and Romania. Although the choice of 10 out of 12 NMS was similar – to implement SAPS – the preaccession policies, the structure of agricultural output and the distribution of farm sizes have created substantial differences in the distribution of support and the choices between decoupled and coupled Complementary National Direct Payments (CNDP) or ‘top-ups’. As expected, due to the phasing-in process there has been a tendency of increased payments per hectare over time; however this increase has not been uniformly manifested. The differences in the output structure and labour intensity, as well as the large differences in farm structures and farm size distribution have brought about substantial differences in amounts of direct payments per beneficiary and AWU. One of the countries with the most concentrated land use in large farms, some of them corporate farms (companies or co-operatives), are the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Hungary and Bulgaria occupy the middle ground, whilst the Baltic States, Poland and Romania are characterised by small size farms almost across the board. This variety across the NMS has substantial implications for several aspects of SAPS implementation and its beneficiaries, including the amount of direct payments per beneficiary, the average size of beneficiary and the share of holdings benefitting from the scheme. The share of beneficiaries varies from a small segment of the holdings covered by the Farm Structure Survey (FSS), as for example in Bulgaria and Slovakia, to covering almost all holdings included in FSS (Lithuania). One of the positive signals is that in some NMS the concentration of SAP on a small segment has been decreasing (although slowly) in parallel with the increasing farmers and administration experiences. All these structural and distributional differences mean that setting payments limitations or including (eventually) the NMS in a system of progressive modulation may have widely different effects on different NMS and thus may generate substantially different political positions. Analytical survey results are presented concerning the change (or the lack of) of farmers strategic plans {{as a result of the}} implementation of SAPS in two of the above NMS with contrasting farm structures and payment distribution. The results indicate that as the implementation of SAPS means more predictable and increasing payments in comparison to the pre-accession policy the main change in the strategic farmers’ plans is their increased willingness to stay longer in farming and increase the farm area operated. The expected response to 2003 CAP reform, namely lower incentives to produce and increased drive to diversification to non-farm activities was not detected in this early survey in NMS. However, it is difficult to disentangle the changes induced by SAPS from the general expectations due to accession to the EU.
