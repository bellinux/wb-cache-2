A larger EER number indicates better performance. The manufacturer's literature should provide both a COP to describe performance in <b>heating</b> <b>mode,</b> and an EER or SEER to describe performance in cooling mode.

40|$|This article aims to numerically {{investigate}} mixed {{convection heat}} transfer in a two-dimensional horizontal channel {{with an open}} cavity. A discrete heat source {{is considered to be}} located on one of the walls of the cavity. Three different <b>heating</b> <b>modes</b> are considered which relate to the location of the heat source on three different walls (left, right and bottom) of the cavity. The analysis is carried out for a range of Richardson numbers and cavity aspect ratios. The results show that there are noticeable differences among the three <b>heating</b> <b>modes.</b> When the <b>heat</b> source is located on the right wall, the cavity with an aspect ratio of two has the highest heat transfer rate compared to other cavity <b>heating</b> <b>modes.</b> Moreover, when the heat source is located on the bottom wall, the flow field in the cavity with an aspect ratio of two experiences a fluctuating behaviour for Richardson number of 10.

25|$|Heat {{pumps are}} more {{effective}} for heating than for cooling an interior space if the temperature differential is held equal. This is because the compressor's input energy is also converted to useful heat when in <b>heating</b> <b>mode,</b> and is discharged along with the transported heat via the condenser to the interior space. But for cooling, the condenser is normally outdoors, and the compressor's dissipated work (waste heat) must also be transported to outdoors using more input energy, rather than being put to a useful purpose. For the same reason, opening a food refrigerator or freezer has {{the net effect of}} heating up the room rather than cooling it, because its refrigeration cycle rejects heat to the indoor air. This heat includes the compressor's dissipated work as well as the heat removed from the inside of the appliance.|$|E
2500|$|While {{air conditioners}} and {{freezers}} are familiar examples of heat pumps, the term [...] "heat pump" [...] is more general and applies to many HVAC (heating, ventilating, and air conditioning) devices used for space heating or space cooling. When a heat pump {{is used for}} heating, it employs the same basic refrigeration-type cycle used by an air conditioner or a refrigerator, but in the opposite direction—releasing heat into the conditioned space rather than the surrounding environment. In this use, heat pumps generally draw heat from the cooler external air or from the ground. In <b>heating</b> <b>mode,</b> heat pumps are {{three to four times}} more efficient in their use of electric power than simple electrical resistance heaters.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{feature of}} ASHP {{external}} heat exchangers is {{their need to}} stop the fan {{from time to time}} for a period of several minutes in order to get rid of frost that accumulates in the outdoor unit in the <b>heating</b> <b>mode.</b> After that, the heat pump starts to work again. This part of the work cycle results in two sudden changes of the noise made by the fan. The acoustic effect of such disruption on neighbors is especially powerful in quiet environments where background nighttime noise may be as low as 0 to 10dBA. This is included in legislation in France. According to the French concept of noise nuisance, [...] "noise emergence" [...] is the difference between ambient noise including the disturbing noise, and ambient noise without the disturbing noise.|$|E

40|$|A {{spectral}} analysis is presented of the fluctuations in a horizontal fluid layer {{subject to a}} downward directed temperature gradient, which, for a critical value, drives the system in a convective instability state.

2500|$|Cooling towers {{are also}} used in HVAC systems that have {{multiple}} water source heat pumps that share a common piping water loop. In this type of system, the water circulating inside the water loop removes heat from the condenser of the heat pumps whenever the heat pumps are working in the cooling mode, then the externally mounted cooling tower is used to remove heat from the water loop and reject it to the atmosphere. [...] By contrast, when the heat pumps are working in <b>heating</b> <b>mode,</b> the condensers draw heat {{out of the loop}} water and reject it into the space to be heated. [...] When the water loop is being used primarily to supply heat to the building, the cooling tower is normally shut down (and may be drained or winterized to prevent freeze damage), and heat is supplied by other means, usually from separate boilers.|$|E

50|$|A {{refrigeration}} cycle can be operated as a heat pump to move heat from outdoors into a warmer house. A heat pump {{with a higher}} SEER rating for cooling mode would also usually be more efficient in <b>heating</b> <b>mode,</b> rated using HSPF. When operated in <b>heating</b> <b>mode,</b> a heat pump is typically more efficient than an electrical resistance heater. This is because a space heater can convert only the input electrical energy directly to output heat energy, while a heat pump also transfers heat from outdoors. In <b>heating</b> <b>mode,</b> the coefficient of performance is the ratio of heat provided to the energy used by the unit. An ideal resistance heater converting 100% of its input electricity to output heat would have COP = 1, equivalent to a 3.4 EER. The heat pump becomes less efficient as the outside temperature decreases, and its performance may become comparable to a resistance heater. For a heat pump with the minimum 13 SEER cooling efficiency, this is typically below -10 F.|$|E

50|$|VRFs {{come in two}} system formats, two {{pipe and}} three pipe systems. In a heat pump 2 pipe system all of the zones must either be all in cooling or all in heating. Heat Recovery (HR) systems {{have the ability to}} {{simultaneously}} heat certain zones while cooling others; this is usually done through a three pipe design, with the exception of Mitsubishi and Carrier who are able to do this with a 2 pipe system using a BC controller to the individual indoor evaporator zones. In this case the heat extracted from zones requiring cooling is put to use in the zones requiring heating. This is made possible because the heating unit is functioning as a condenser, providing sub-cooled liquid back into the line that is being used for cooling. While the heat recovery system has a greater initial cost, it allows for better zoned thermal control of a building and overall greater efficiencies.In heat recovery VRF systems some of indoor units are in cooling mode and some others are in <b>heating</b> <b>mode</b> that it leads to energy consumption saving. if the coefficient of performance in cooling mode of a system be 3 and the coefficient of performance in <b>heating</b> <b>mode</b> be 4 then heat recovery performance can reach to more than 7.

40|$|The {{asymptotic}} {{structure and}} diffusional-thermal instability of a planar premixed burner-stabilized flame suffering either upstream or downstream volumetric heat loss with a rate {{described by a}} linear dependence on temperature is studied using activation-energy asymptotics. A brief review of the results for a flame without volumetric heat loss is presented. The results are compared to those obtained recently for a flame suffering combined upstream/ downstream volumetric heat loss. For the structure, the analysis predicts that the expressions for the burning rate and the specific heat loss rate to the burner are not identical, unlike that shown for the freely propagating flame with volumetric heat loss. This is in agreement with earlier investigations of a flame suffering the three separate <b>heat</b> loss <b>modes</b> studied using thin-flame theory. Also in agreement with these earlier studies, the analysis predicts that the downstream <b>heat</b> loss <b>mode</b> is larger in magnitude than the upstream <b>heat</b> loss <b>mode.</b> For the diffusional-thermal instability, the analysis demonstrates that for the linear stability model considered, the effects of upstream and downstream heat loss appear in additive form.
