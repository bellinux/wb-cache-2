5|$|In June 2015, {{two members}} of the Security Committee of the Czech Parliament visited Uherský Brod and talked to {{multiple}} witnesses. The MPs issued a report condemning handling of the situation by the police. Among other issues, the MPs criticized that policemen parked their cars and put bullet proof vests on within the shooting range of the attacker, initially failed to get information from the witnesses and only later during the intervention attempted to contact them, didn't cover the back exit and thus potentially allowed the perpetrator {{to get out of the}} object and jeopardize other people. The police <b>even</b> <b>let</b> a helicopter land within the shooting range of the attacker. According to MPs, the police left much to be desired in regards of communication and most importantly, they wrongly decided to believe the perpetrator's claim of having hostage even though the witnesses could have readily confirmed that everyone inside was most likely dead. The policemen didn't seal the vicinity of the attack until 1pm and used civilian phones in communication with superior officers instead of using either their own phones or radio transmitters. Minister of Interior Chovanec commented that the MPs failed to interview the policemen and thus didn't get all the relevant information.|$|E
25|$|As these spiders live in {{constant}} proximity to humans, {{they are not}} usually aggressive and will <b>even</b> <b>let</b> a human hand approach their web. Like any other spider, however, {{they are afraid of}} bigger foes, and, in most cases, will retreat behind an obstacle (such as a dried leaf or prey remains) upon perceiving more than usual disturbance to their web. Further disturbance may lead to the spider dropping down on a thread, then running away from the web. If the distance is not considerable, it will usually return to its web within a couple of days. Otherwise, it will start a new one.|$|E
25|$|Brazil's President, Getúlio Vargas, {{wanted to}} {{industrialize}} Brazil, {{allowing it to}} be more competitive with other countries. He reached out to Germany, Italy, France, and the United States to act as trade allies. Many Italian and German people immigrated to Brazil many years before World War II began thus creating a Nazi influence. The immigrants held high positions in government and the armed forces. It was recently found that 9,000 war criminals escaped to South America, including Croats, Ukrainians, Russians and other western Europeans who aided the Nazi war machine. Most, {{perhaps as many as}} 5,000, went to Argentina; between 1,500 and 2,000 are thought to have made it to Brazil; around 500 to 1,000 to Chile; and the rest to Paraguay and Uruguay. It was not a secret that Vargas had an admiration for Hitler's Nazi Germany and its Führer. He <b>even</b> <b>let</b> German Luftwaffe build secret air forces around Brazil.|$|E

25|$|Later {{that year}} Suzuki spent {{a short time}} in the {{hospital}} with tuberculosis, but soon recovered. In 1927 an important chapter in Suzuki's life was turned. He went to visit a teacher in England he had at Komazawa named Miss Nona Ransom, a woman who had taught English to such people as the last emperor of China, Pu-yi, and more so his wife, the last empress of China, Jigoro Kano (the Founder of Judo), the children of Chinese president Li Yuanhong, and some members of the Japanese royal family. She hired him that day to be a translator and to help with errands. Through this period he realized she was very ignorant of Japanese culture and the religion of Buddhism. She respected it very little and saw it as idol worship. But one day, when there were no chores to be done, the two had a conversation on Buddhism that changed her mind. She <b>even</b> <b>let</b> Suzuki teach her zazen meditation. This experience is significant in that Suzuki realized that Western ignorance of Buddhism could be transformed.|$|E
500|$|In 1910, Horace Avory {{became a}} judge. Hastings first found {{out when he}} read the report in the morning newspapers, and was dismayed that he would again have {{to search for a}} tenancy at another {{chambers}}. He instead had the idea that he could take over Avory's chambers himself, allowing him to avoid the trouble of finding a new tenancy. Maintaining a set of chambers was very expensive, however; as well as paying the rent, the head of chambers would be expected to pay the clerks. Hastings suggested to Avory that Avory could pay the rent, and Hastings would then pay him back when he had the money. Despite Avory's reputation as [...] "cold and hard" [...] he agreed to this idea, and <b>even</b> <b>let</b> Hastings keep the furniture, including Avory's valuable chair which had once belonged to Harry Poland.|$|E
500|$|This period {{came to an}} {{end when}} the Nazi Party won power in Germany in an {{election}} on 2 March 1933. The following month it enacted the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, which provided for the retirement or dismissal of all Jewish civil servants, along with political opponents of the government. As a veteran of the First World War, Franck was exempt, but he submitted his resignation anyway on 17 April 1933. He once commented that science was his God and nature was his religion. He did not require his daughters to attend religious instruction classes at school, and <b>even</b> <b>let</b> them have a decorated tree at Christmas; but he was proud of his Jewish heritage all the same. He was the first academic to resign in protest over the law. Newspapers around the world reported it, but no government or university [...] protested.|$|E

500|$|On September 11, 1970, Hendrix {{gave his}} final {{interview}} in his suite at the Cumberland Hotel in London, where he talked with Keith Altham, a journalist for Record Mirror. During the interview, Hendrix confirmed reports that Billy Cox, the bass player in his band, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, was leaving. Cox, who had been suffering from severe exhaustion and was exhibiting symptoms of paranoia, mutually agreed with Hendrix that they should suspend their plans to collaborate musically. When Altham asked Hendrix: [...] "Do you feel any kind of compulsion to prove yourself as King Guitar", Hendrix replied: [...] "No, I don't <b>even</b> <b>let</b> that bother me. Because they {{say a lot of}} things about people that, if they let it bother them, they wouldn't even be around today... King Guitar now? Wow, that's a bit heavy."

500|$|Brundage quickly {{displayed}} what writer Roger Butterfield in a 1948 {{article for}} Life magazine termed [...] "a dictatorial temperament." [...] In 1929, American track star Charlie Paddock stated that Brundage and other sports officials were making {{money for the}} AOC by using him as a gate attraction, while treating him badly; Brundage shot back accusing Paddock of [...] "untruths" [...] and [...] "sensationalism of the rankest sort". The runner turned professional, escaping Brundage's jurisdiction. In 1932, soon after winning three medals at the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, track star Mildred [...] "Babe" [...] Didrikson appeared in an automobile advertisement, and the Brundage-led AAU quickly suspended her amateur status. Didrikson objected {{that she had not}} been paid and that regardless, the rules for maintaining amateur status were overcomplex. In the first of several well-publicized run-ins he had with female athletes, Brundage replied that he had not had any problem with the rules when an Olympic athlete himself, and stated, [...] "You know, the ancient Greeks kept women out of their athletic games. They wouldn't <b>even</b> <b>let</b> them on the sidelines. I'm not so sure but they were right." [...] According to Butterfield, Brundage was suspicious of female athletes, suspecting that some were actually men in disguise.|$|E
500|$|BBC America {{described}} Gilly {{on their}} official website stating: [...] "His most endearing quality is his honesty {{and despite his}} countless flaws, {{what you see is}} what you get. He's hardly a ladykiller but what he lacks in appearance he makes up for with charisma." [...] E4 publicity describe Gilly as fun-loving and always trying to woo females but hardly manages to impress them and has also been described as unlucky-in-love after his failed relationships. Initially he failed to impress females and didn't have much in common with them. Gilly has been portrayed as a strong supporter of Manchester City F.C., it was this single thing that drew him and Beth Clement (Sinéad Moynihan) together. Gilly was later made a fool by Beth and his best friend Rhys Ashworth (Andrew Moss) after they continued an affair despite the fact they were siblings, they split, Beth subsequently died and due to Gilly's forgiving personality he later forgave Rhys. Holy Soap opined that this was a stand out moment of the character's duration. Another storyline showing his timid personality was when he was mugged by a group of teenagers and was left fearing for his safety and <b>even</b> <b>let</b> them pick on him on the streets. In a further twist Gilly was left feeling so ashamed of the attack he pretended it was adult attackers fearing what people would think of him.|$|E

500|$|The website Touch Arcade {{said that}} they loved the game, {{and that it was}} one of their {{favorite}} role-playing games on iOS. They did however think that the game was bad at explaining things, including the system of saving one's progress. Pocket Gamer, too, thought that things were not explained enough. For instance, they said that the game does not guide players from point A to point B, and often does not <b>even</b> <b>let</b> players know where to start looking for point B. RPGFan echoed this, and said that it is not uncommon for players to wander around, wondering where to go. Gamezebo said they did not think the battle system was particularly exciting, but appreciated how the conversation system and the demon fusion adds elements of risk and reward to the game. The British newspaper Metro found the game more entertaining than most role-playing games from its time. Gamezebo found the iOS version's touch screen-based virtual buttons clumsy to use, while Pocket Gamer found the interface to work [...] "reasonably well" [...] while using the landscape mode, and RPGFan found the interface to be excellent. Both Gamezebo and Touch Arcade wished the game had been a [...] "universal app", so that it could have been played on other devices than iPhone and iPod Touch without having the graphics upscaled.|$|E
500|$|A major {{sticking}} point over NHL participation {{has been the}} insurance of players; for the 2014 Winter Olympics, the IOC paid around US$7 million to insure NHL players participating in the Games. In April 2016, the IOC announced that beginning in 2018, {{it would no longer}} cover accommodations, insurance, or travel for NHL players in the Olympics, prompting the IIHF to ask for support from national ice hockey associations and National Olympic Committees to help cover costs; Matti Nurminen of the Finnish Ice Hockey Association argued that it was the responsibility of the event's organizer to cover costs, and that [...] "In our opinion, the same party should pay the bills, and that’s not us. All the countries replied to the IIHF that they are not willing to pay for the insurance or the travel {{or any of the other}} expenses that are related to having the NHL players participate in Pyeongchang." [...] The New York Times felt that the removal of this financial support would put NHL participation at Pyeongchang in jeopardy, noting the already-strenuous relationship between the NHL and the IOC; Gary Bettman noted that the NHL does not profit from their presence, adding that [...] "in fact, we kind of disappear for two weeks because historically the IOC hasn't <b>even</b> <b>let</b> us join in promoting our participation in the Olympics." ...|$|E
500|$|Another {{issue is}} the extent to which Kahn {{deliberately}} introduced elements into some of his buildings that give them the ageless atmosphere of ruins. [...] Kahn himself spoke of [...] "wrapping ruins around buildings", although in the context of another project. In his essay [...] "Louis I. Kahn and the Ruins of Rome," [...] Vincent Scully argues that Kahn followed this practice in several of his buildings, including this library, saying, [...] "And in his library at Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire, Kahn won't <b>even</b> <b>let</b> it become a building; he wants it to remain a ruin. [...] The walls don't connect at the top. [...] They remain like a hollow shell". [...] Romaldo Giurgola, on the other hand, avoids this interpretation in the entry he wrote for Louis Kahn in the Macmillan Encyclopedia of Architects. In it, while discussing the arrangement of exterior components of Kahn's National Assembly Building of Bangladesh, Giurgola wrote, [...] "This relationship with daylight was the determining element behind this solution, rather than the formal desire to 'create ruins,' as some critics have suggested." [...] In the very next paragraph Guirgola describes the chamfered corners of the library at Phillips Exeter by saying only that Kahn used this device to show that the structural importance of the corner is greatly reduced in buildings like the Exeter library that are constructed with reinforced concrete and other modern materials.|$|E

2500|$|The Benedictine {{rule was}} slowly {{spreading}} across Western Europe, with encouragement from Rome. Chad was educated {{in an entirely}} distinct monastic tradition, indigenous to Western Europe itself, and tending to look back to the saint and monastic founder Martin of Tours as an exemplar, although not as founder of an order. As Bede's account makes clear, the Irish and early Anglo-Saxon monasticism experienced by Chad was peripatetic, stressed ascetic practices and had a strong focus on Biblical exegesis, which generated a profound eschatological consciousness. Egbert recalled later that he and Chad [...] "followed the monastic life together very strictly– in prayers and continence, and in meditation on Holy Scripture". Some of the scholars quickly settled in Irish monasteries, while others wandered from one master to another in search of knowledge. Bede says that the Irish monks gladly taught them and fed them, and <b>even</b> <b>let</b> them use their valuable books, without charge. Since books were all produced by hand, with painstaking attention to detail, this was astonishingly generous. The practice of loaning books freely {{seems to have been}} a distinctive feature of Irish monastic life: it was a violent dispute over rights to copies of a borrowed psalter which had allegedly led to Columba's exile from Ireland many years before.|$|E
2500|$|Norris {{has made}} {{statements}} about Catholic social teaching on homosexuality, particularly {{in relation to}} the Papacy. He criticised Pope John Paul II's statements on homosexuality because he said they led to anti-gay violence, saying that the pope was an [...] "instrument for evil as far as I'm concerned because these constant, unremitting, ignorant, ill-informed attacks on the gay community have led to violence against the gay community". Norris also described the pope's position as [...] "calculated and deliberate wickedness" [...] because he [...] "closes down scholarly enquiry" [...] and because he [...] "marginalised all the wonderful people like Oscar Romero, Leonardo Boff, Hans Kung, Charles Curran, all these marvellous people who are the future and the hope of the Church and, instead, put into place these mindless bureaucrats, which is intensely sad." [...] Commenting on then Cardinal Ratzinger, he said, [...] "Ratzinger, who is, in his mind-set, a Nazi" [...] because he is [...] "afraid to tell the truth," [...] and because he and John Paul II [...] "won't <b>even</b> <b>let</b> themselves be {{in the presence of the}} truth, because it would shatter their very stylised view of things." [...] He later stated that he regretted using the term [...] "Nazi" [...] in reference to Ratzinger.|$|E
