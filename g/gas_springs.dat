40|$|Abstract: Recently {{the use of}} <b>gas</b> <b>spring</b> in {{the combat}} and {{commercial}} vehicle's suspension is increasing. Because of its nonlinear characteristics, the <b>gas</b> <b>spring</b> can support wide range of dynamic loads and gives good ride quality. In design of <b>gas</b> <b>spring,</b> isothermal and adiabatic processes are applied generally, but those processes could not produce heat transfer effect in the simulation. So in this study, heat transfer differential equation and BWR/Ideal state equation are {{used to calculate the}} pressure of <b>gas</b> <b>spring</b> which is changing with time. The numerical analysis showed that the pressure of <b>gas</b> <b>spring</b> forms a hysteresis loop in the both of the state equations. But the peak pressure value of BWR equation over 0. 1 Hz frequency are higher than that of adiabatic process. And the test results showed that the differences between test results and ideal gas equation are smaller than those of BWR equation, so the ideal equation is more accurate than BWR equation in this case...|$|R
50|$|In the {{combustion}} chamber, {{a mixture of}} fuel and air is ignited, increasing the pressure and forcing the moving parts (connection rod, linear generator and pistons) {{in the direction of}} the <b>gas</b> <b>spring.</b> The <b>gas</b> <b>spring</b> is compressed, and, while the piston is near the bottom dead center (BDC), fresh air and fuel are injected into {{the combustion}} chamber, expelling the exhaust gases.|$|R
50|$|The gas may be {{introduced}} by a Schrader-type valve, using a lip seal around the rod and forcing it to allow gas in by external overpressure or a shuttling O-ring system. <b>Gas</b> <b>springs</b> of high pressure contain {{a very large}} amount of energy and {{can be used as a}} power pack. In emergency use the gas may {{be introduced}} via a gas generator cell, similar to those used in airbags. Passive heave compensators features large <b>gas</b> <b>springs.</b> The stroke lengths can exceed 6 meter.|$|E

50|$|Some {{pneumatic}} recoil buffers used in firearms are fast, low-power <b>gas</b> <b>springs.</b> When compressed, {{they present}} initial resistance as the rod-to-seal grip is broken {{and then they}} move in a regular manner. An additional small spring can be used inside the gas spring if rapid turnaround times are needed. Springs twist and the coils try to ride over each other when moving and this chaotic movement does not exist with <b>gas</b> <b>springs,</b> hence reducing twist and jump of the firearm. These features are very advantageous. Fine tuning of the spring power is also possible by altering the internal gas volume. This design for firearms was invented and patented by Collins and Shipman of Bedford, UK and Bergstrom in the U.S. in 2001.|$|E

50|$|The FPLG {{has been}} {{conceived}} {{in many different}} configurations, but for most applications, particularly for the automotive industry, {{focus has been on}} two opposed pistons in the same cylinder with one combustion chamber with a <b>gas</b> <b>spring</b> {{at the end of each}} cylinder. This balances out the forces in order to reduce vibration and noise. In the simplest case, a second unit is just a mirror of the first, with no functional connection to the first. Alternatively, a single combustion chamber or <b>gas</b> <b>spring</b> can be used, allowing for a more compact design and easier synchronization between the pistons.|$|R

The thermodynamics of physical model of oil <b>gas</b> <b>spring</b> under the forced convection condition was established. The heat transfer coefficient expression of the correlation surface and the comprehensive heat transfer equation were deduced. After that, the external force and internal energy change rate of oil and nitrogen were researched.

Just {{three years later}} SUSPA is the market leader. The first products for the automobile industry are <b>gas</b> <b>springs</b> for opening and closing of tailgates in 1964. 1969 SUSPA develops a height adjustment system and a positioning system for backrests of office chairs.1973-1978 SUSPA expands in Europe, Asia and America; SUSPA develops silicone-damped impact absorbers for automobiles. 1988 SUSPA diversifies to a three-component water paint system and thus protects the environment by abstaining from using solvents and amines. 1991 SUSPA develops height adjustment systems for tables and work surfaces. 1994 a new business is founded in India. The mass production of spoiler adjustment systems begins in 1999 and SUSPA becomes a system supplier for the automotive industry. One year later SUSPA produces its first crash management system and opens an assembly plant in the Czech Republic. In 2003 the production capacities in Asia are expanded. Steadily increasing price competition in the world market coupled with heavily increased material costs forces SUSPA in 2008 to stop manufacturing <b>gas</b> <b>springs</b> for chairs and {{to focus more on}} the core business (Automotive and Industry). In June 2009 the company Tyrol Equity from Austria purchases 80 per cent of the company shares. In June 2012 the Tyrolean Industry Holding sells their SUSPA shares to the private investor group Andlinger & Company GmbH.|$|E

40|$|Testing and {{analysis}} of a free piston linear machine with <b>gas</b> <b>springs,</b> with applications in drilling technologyThis thesis is written in collaboration with Resonator AS, a company developing free piston linear machines for down-the-hole drilling applications. The free piston linear machine is designed to create heavy vibrations, which are used to break the rock. A successful product relies {{on the ability to}} deliver a sufficient hammering energy per blow to break the rock, at a high frequency, yielding a high rate of penetration (ROP). To reach the goal of making a faster drilling machine, Resonator has targeted electrical power density and stiff springs in the free piston linear machine, as critical factors. They have found mechanical springs inadequate for their application and are therefore researching the use of <b>gas</b> <b>springs</b> in a free piston linear machine. This thesis is focusing on the use of gas spring in a free piston linear machine. The use of <b>gas</b> <b>springs</b> in a free piston linear machine is analyzed and tested, important parameters for the performance of such a machine are investigated with emphasis on the <b>gas</b> <b>springs.</b> Critical design factors found are structural design, thermal design, surface specifications, seal configuration, lubrication and tolerances. These areas are investigated in detail for the tested prototype. Advantages and disadvantages for the use of <b>gas</b> <b>springs</b> in such a machine are discussed; the main advantage found is that high frequencies’ seem to be obtainable, the main disadvantage is the friction in the <b>gas</b> <b>springs</b> causing heat generation and decreased efficiency. A linear spring equivalent for gas spring stiffness is derived to ease analysis of systems using high velocity <b>gas</b> <b>springs.</b> This linear spring equivalent has been used to predict the resonate frequency of the machine. Test results show good coherence between the predicted frequency and the measured. The gas spring stiffness equivalent has also been used to optimize the gas spring chamber size. Based on the tests {{and analysis}} performed, improvements have been made to the prototype machine tested, and future improvements are suggested. The changes done to the original design yielded a substantial performance gain. Based on the analysis, it seems to be possible to further improve the machine performance by implementing the suggested improvements. Improvements are suggested in structural design, thermal design, surface texture, seal configuration, lubrication and tolerances. To confirm the results from the tests and analysis found in this thesis further testing needs to be performed. Resonator A...|$|E

40|$|An arrow-launching device ("hand ballista") {{has been}} {{developed}} using the principles of a compound bow, but relying on modern energy storage technologies in place of bending li,mbs. It is designed to use either bands of latex rubber that stretch to store energy and contract to release it, or alternatively a highpressure, high-speed <b>gas</b> <b>spring</b> that stores energy when compressed. Each version uses a system of wheels and eccentric cams to transfer force from the user pulling back on the string to the rubber or the <b>gas</b> <b>spring,</b> providing the appropriate mechanical advantage. Substituting these technologies for limbs makes the hand ballista more compact, sturdier, and potentially more energy efficient than most modern bows.
