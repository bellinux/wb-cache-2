40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to contribute with suggestions of nature preservation managements of selected forest objects of <b>high</b> <b>nature</b> <b>values</b> managed by the Swedish state-owned forest company Sveaskog. Many forests with high natural potential are relatively rare today due to modern forestry, where wood production is the main purpose. Sveaskog’s policy is to consider and to priority nature conservation on valuable objects. This assessment includes objects that in the future may develop into nature reserves. By identifying key objects of <b>high</b> <b>nature</b> <b>values</b> in the database of Sveaskog, 29 of 69 objects were selected for further field studies in the survey in the area of Hultsfred, Vimmerby and Växjö County. Finally, 19 objects were selected by various reasons. Based on the biological requirements of a number of observed vulnerable species, management strategies in order to improve the flora and fauna at the sites were proposed. From the field studies I consider the majority of the objects were in a relatively good state for preservation of <b>high</b> <b>nature</b> <b>values.</b> However, at a number of sites the ingrowth of spruce has to be reduced and at other sites the amounts of dead wood has to increase. Conclusively, the majority of the studied forest sites of Sveaskog are in a good state for nature preservation, although some need an improved management...|$|R

40|$|The rural {{development}} policy community is calling for new transdisciplinary approaches to convey meaningful measures (e. g. indicator sets, indices) for assessing <b>High</b> <b>Nature</b> <b>Value</b> farming systems at different spatial scales (IEEP, 2009). At broader spatial scales there has been huge efforts for example by IRENA (Indicator Reporting on the Integration of Environmental Concerns into Agriculture Policy) in developing a set of agri-environmental indicators at the European scale (Paracchini et al., 2010). Another European scale initiative was the <b>High</b> <b>Nature</b> <b>Value</b> farming project which worked on developing <b>High</b> <b>Nature</b> <b>Value</b> Farming area indicators. In parallel, there is a rich literature reporting local case study data on <b>high</b> <b>nature</b> <b>value</b> farming systems throughout Europe. Nevertheless, transforming the local case study data on a local level indicator set is yet far from being accomplished. Furthermore, is still missing cross scale work on integrating European and local scale <b>high</b> <b>nature</b> <b>value</b> farming indicators. Land cover patterns, being dynamic landscape components, are essential features in <b>High</b> <b>nature</b> <b>value</b> systems. Thus, one promising avenue for devising indicators that bridge the agri-environmental and social spheres at different scales of analysis is that of land cover (vegetation structures such as grass, glades and forests) (Wiggering et al., 2006). However, landscape structure and composition will alter with changes in scale, and also across regions throughout Europe, and land cover patterns will also shift accordingly. Therefore, {{it is likely that}} the metrics/indexes framed at the European scale will not be transferable across scales in a straightforward way. There is thus the need to explore what are the set of indicators(including but not exclusively land cover) that can be framed in a comprehensive methodological approach for upscaling and downscaling HNV farming indicators (EEA, 2010). This paper particularly focuses on methodological issues in the light of the state of the art methodological approaches. It finishes by pointing out the challenges ahead for progressing on the development of multi scale indicators for gauging High Nature farming systems in Europ...|$|E
40|$|Grazing is an {{important}} management issue affecting lowland grassland throughout the UK (Crofts & Jefferson 1999, UK BAP 2005). Cessation of livestock grazing on lowland grassland has reduced the conservation value of many sites (Preston et al. 2002) but inappropriate grazing intensities or stock types can also be damaging (Crofts & Jefferson 1999, UK BAP 2005). In the Countryside Council for Wales (CCW) rapid assessment exercise, grazing was the first listed management factor affecting habitat condition at 63 % of lowland grassland features in unfavourable condition.

40|$|The 'High Nature Value farming' idea {{connects the}} {{preservation}} of biodiversity {{with the need to}} safeguard the continuation of farming in certain areas and the maintenance of specific farming systems associated with a long-term management approach. The need for measures to prevent the loss of <b>High</b> <b>Nature</b> <b>Value</b> farmland is widely acknowledged. Conservation of biodiversity on agricultural land is an explicit objective of the pan-European Biodiversity and Landscape Strategy, the Bern Convention and, at EU level, the Habitats and Birds Directives and the Rural Development Policy (Community Strategic Guidelines for Rural Development Programming Period 2007 - 2013). Conserving <b>High</b> <b>Nature</b> <b>Value</b> farmland is a key aspect in achieving future biodiversity targets. In their 2003 ¿Kyiv¿ declaration, the European Environment Ministers have set the goal to identify HNV farmland in Europe and take adequate conservation measures. The COM(2010) 4 final ¿Options for an EU vision and target for biodiversity beyond 2010 ¿ recognises the need of preserving and enhancing farming and forestry with a <b>high</b> <b>nature</b> <b>value</b> {{in the context of the}} CAP. Furthermore, in 2006 the frame of agri-environmental indicators for monitoring the integration of environmental concerns into the common agricultural policy has been formally identified and published in the COM (2006) 508. The <b>High</b> <b>Nature</b> <b>Value</b> farmland indicator is part of the framework, as well as indicators on Population trends in farmland birds. JRC/IES is one of the EC services that are developing such indicators. The aim of this study is to improve the methodology to define HNV farmland areas and investigate more thoroughly the link between bird species and farmland habitat. The French case study is presented in high detail; relevant statistical data were available regarding agriculture practices both at present and past time periods, which provided the information for the development of a national HNV indicator.

40|$|Europe's {{agricultural}} landscapes provide highly varied {{living conditions}} for many plants and animals. Baldock et al. (1993) and Beaufoy et al. (1994) described the general characteristics of low-input farming systems {{in terms of}} biodiversity and management practices and introduced the term <b>high</b> <b>nature</b> <b>value</b> farmland. Typical <b>high</b> <b>nature</b> <b>value</b> farmland areas are the extensively grazed uplands in the UK, alpine meadows and pasture, steppic areas in eastern and southern Europe and dehesas and montados in Spain and Portugal. The more intensively farmed areas in lowland western Europe can also host concentrations of species of particular conservation interest, such as migratory waterfowl. The need for measures to prevent the loss of <b>high</b> <b>nature</b> <b>value</b> farmland is widely acknowledged. Conservation of biodiversity on agricultural land is an explicit objective of the pan-European Biodiversity and Landscape Strategy, the Bern Convention, the European Landscape Convention, and, at EU level, the Habitats and Birds Directives and the Rural Development Policy (Community Strategic Guidelines for Rural Development Programming Period 2007 - 2013). In their 6 th Environment Action Programme, the EU committed itself to halting biodiversity decline by 2010. Conserving <b>High</b> <b>Nature</b> <b>Value</b> farmland is key to achieving this 2010 biodiversity target. Pan-European data on distribution and conservation status of HNV farmland, however, were largely lacking. In their 2003 "Kyiv" declaration, the European Environment Ministers have therefore set the goal to fill this data gap and take adequate conservation measures. In support of this policy process, EEA and UNEP published a Joint Message (EEA 2004), presenting a preliminary map of HNV farmland and analysing the targeting of agricultural policy instruments. The Joint Message used the concept as developed by Andersen et al. (2003) that describes HNV farmland as: "Those areas in Europe where agriculture is a major (usually the dominant) land use and where that agriculture supports, or is associated with, either a high species and habitat diversity or the presence of species of European conservation concern, or both". The aim of estimating HNV farmland distribution at European level according to a standardised method is primarily to gain insight in the current status, as well as enabling analysis of European trends and targeting of relevant policy instruments, such as Less Favoured Area (LFA) support. In order to increase accuracy, JRC and the EEA have been preparing the first EU 27 map of <b>High</b> <b>Nature</b> <b>Value</b> farmland, {{on the basis of}} new land cover data, refined and regionally differentiated selection criteria, and additional biodiversity datasets.

40|$|Many {{studies have}} shown how {{intensification}} of farming is {{the main cause of}} loss biodiversity in these environments. During the last decades, agroecosystems in Europe have changed drastically, mainly due to mechanization of agriculture. In this work, species richness in bird communities was examined on a gradient of spatial heterogeneity of farmlands, in order to quantify its effects. Four categories of farmland spatial heterogeneity were defined, based on landscape and landuse parameters. The impact of features increasing the spatial heterogeneity was quantified comparing the similarity indexes between bird communities in several farmlands of Central Italy. The effects of environmental variables on bird richness were analyzed using GLM. The results highlighted that landscape features surrogates of <b>high</b> <b>nature</b> <b>values</b> (HNVs) of farmlands can increase more than 50 % the bird species richness. The features more related to bird richness were hedgerows, scattered shrubs, uncultivated patches, and powerlines. The results confirm that the approach based on HNV for evaluating the farmlands is also suitable in order to study birds’ diversity. However, some species are more sensitive to heterogeneity, while other species occupy mainly homogeneous farmlands. As a consequence, different conservation methods must be considered for each farmland bird species...|$|R

40|$|Agriculture {{is shaping}} {{most of the}} European landscapes. Its {{activities}} started about 8, 000 years ago and spread until it reached its maximum extension and covered half of the European territory. This long history of agricultural land management has {{lead to the development}} of specific agro-ecosystems and associated biodiversity that can only be maintained under specific agricultural practices. The effects of such agricultural management cover a range of impacts. On the one hand land allocation, pesticides and fertilisers can deeply reshape the land and the distribution of flora and fauna, reducing species richness and abundance. On the other hand, the areas where traditional agriculture is persisting and the human impacts are less pronounced, are among those where the highest natural value is preserved. A consequence of the intensification trends that have characterised the development of agricultural practices during the 20 th century and the evolution of many European landscapes is the shift of the main character of agricultural lands towards intensive farming, with a consequent reduction of the area hosting a high rate of biodiversity. The awareness of the decline of world (and particularly European) biodiversity has lead to policy actions at different levels aimed at preserving farming areas characterised by <b>high</b> <b>nature</b> <b>value.</b> The process started in the early 1990 s and has lead firstly to the identification of the concept of <b>High</b> <b>Nature</b> <b>Value</b> farmland, and then to focused policy targets aimed at halting biodiversity loss in general and of endangered agro-ecosystems in particular. There is an implicit link between areas of high natural value and traditional agricultural landscapes, though the two concepts are not fully overlapping.

30|$|The {{number of}} pastoralists {{maintaining}} production systems with {{small numbers of}} traditional breeds of cattle decreased dramatically with the modernisation and industrialisation of agriculture in Europe during the twentieth century. While these pastoral systems were not compatible with agricultural industrialisation policies, they provide a far better match to current European Union (EU) policy {{with its emphasis on}} <b>high</b> <b>nature</b> <b>values</b> and various cultural heritage protection measures. Today, these farms can obtain EU funding for preserving natural and/or cultural heritage values rather than producing agricultural goods. Although such EU subsidies make a welcome contribution to the livelihood of traditional farmers, the critical definitions that have to be made regarding what is considered traditional or non-traditional can be problematic. This paper provides an example from Swedish fäbodbruk, a smallholder system of forest pasturing with traditional breeds of cattle, goats and sheep in northern Sweden. As policymaking and agricultural subsidies during the twentieth century reflected the contemporary political agenda of that time, farmers have been subjected to many changes in priority in political decision making. The contemporary push for traditional farming and heritage has made policymaking potentially even more difficult, e.g. as regards the question of what should be considered traditional and what makes up natural and cultural heritage. This paper examines how farmers are affected by valuations and assessments made by the relevant authorities on whether they are producing natural and/or cultural heritage.|$|R
