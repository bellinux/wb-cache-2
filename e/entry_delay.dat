40|$|Aneuploidy, a {{chromosome}} content {{that is not}} a multiple of the haploid karyotype, is associated with reduced fitness in all organisms analyzed to date. In budding yeast aneuploidy causes cell proliferation defects, with many different aneuploid strains exhibiting a delay in G 1, a cell cycle stage governed by extracellular cues, growth rate and cell cycle events. Here, we characterize this G 1 delay. We show that 10 of 14 aneuploid yeast strains exhibit a growth defect during G 1. Furthermore, 10 of 14 aneuploid strains display a cell cycle <b>entry</b> <b>delay</b> that correlates with the size of the additional chromosome. This cell cycle <b>entry</b> <b>delay</b> is due to a delayed accumulation of G 1 cyclins that can be suppressed by supplying cells with high levels of a G 1 cyclin.

Due to this age restriction, we can still separate the reason for delaying high school graduation by using the date of birth as an instrumental variable.

A clear knowledge of the factors affecting <b>delayed</b> <b>entry</b> will be essential in directing interventions towards reducing <b>delayed</b> <b>entry</b> into HIV care. There exist very limited data on <b>delayed</b> <b>entry</b> in Cameroon despite its relevance; hence {{this study was conducted}} to determine the rate of <b>delayed</b> <b>entry</b> and its associated factors in HIV programmes in Cameroon. Methods Data used for this study was routine data obtained from the files of HIV patients who were diagnosed between January 1, 2015 and June 30, 2015 at Limbe and Buea regional hospital HIV centers in the South West region of Cameroon. Data analysis was done using SPSS version 20. Results Of the 223 patients included in the study, nearly one-quarter of patients (22. 4  %) delayed to enter HIV care within 3  months. Those who delayed to enter care were less likely to present at first diagnosis (using HIV rapid test) with symptoms such as fever[*]>[*] 1  month (5  % versus 30  %, p[*]=[*] 0. 01) and weight loss[*]>[*] 10  % (13  % versus 48  %, p[*]<[*] 0. 001).

40|$|The {{kinetochore}} is {{a protein}} complex that assembles on centromeric DNA to mediate chromosome–microtubule interaction. Most eukaryotic cells form the spindle and establish kinetochore–microtubule interaction during mitosis, but budding yeast cells finish these processes in S-phase. It {{has long been}} noticed that the S-phase spindle in budding yeast is shorter than that in metaphase, but the biological significance of this short S-phase spindle structure remains unclear. We addressed this issue by using ask 1 - 3, a temperature-sensitive kinetochore mutant that exhibits partially elongated spindles at permissive temperature {{in the presence of}} hydroxyurea (HU), a DNA synthesis inhibitor. After exposure to and removal of HU, ask 1 - 3 cells show a delayed anaphase entry. This delay depends on the spindle checkpoint, which monitors kinetochore–microtubule interaction defects. Overproduction of microtubule-associated protein Ase 1 or Cin 8 also induces spindle elongation in HU-arrested cells. The spindle checkpoint-dependent anaphase <b>entry</b> <b>delay</b> is also observed after ASE 1 or CIN 8 overexpression in HU-arrested cells.

In this paper we show that in the mRNA degradation mutant Kllsm 4 Delta 1, histone mRNAs are induced early in the S-phase and maintained at high level all along the entire cell cycle due to a delay in the exit from S-phase and/or entry into M-phase. The overexpression of the HIR 1 gene (Histone transcriptional repressor), previously isolated as a multicopy suppressor of the apoptotic phenotypes observed in Kllsm 4 Delta 1, can also restore the normal cycling of histone genes expression. We also found that low doses of hydroxyurea neutralize the onset of the apoptotic phenotypes in Kllsm 4 Delta 1, as well in another mRNA decapping mutants (lsm 1) and, in addition, increase the chronological lifespan in both strains suggesting that an <b>entry</b> <b>delay</b> into the S phase can recover some cellular defects in decapping mutants...|$|E

40|$|In {{budding yeast}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae, kinetochores are {{attached}} by microtubules {{during most of}} the cell cycle, but the duplication of centromeric DNA disassembles kinetochores, which results in a brief dissociation of chromosomes from microtubules. Kinetochore assembly is delayed in the presence of hydroxyurea, a DNA synthesis inhibitor, presumably due to the longer time required for centromeric DNA duplication. Some kinetochore mutants are sensitive to stressful DNA replication as these kinetochore proteins become essential for the establishment of the kinetochore–microtubule interaction after treatment with hydroxyurea. To identify more genes required for the efficient kinetochore–microtubule interaction under stressful DNA replication conditions, we carried out a genome-wide screen for yeast mutants sensitive to hydroxyurea. From this screen, cik 1 and kar 3 mutants were isolated. Kar 3 is the minus-end-directed motor protein; Cik 1 binds to Kar 3 and is required for its motor function. After exposure to hydroxyurea, cik 1 and kar 3 mutant cells exhibit normal DNA synthesis kinetics, but they display a significant anaphase <b>entry</b> <b>delay.</b> Our results indicate that cik 1 cells exhibit a defect in the establishment of chromosome bipolar attachment in the presence of hydroxyurea.

NW {{was inspired by the}} Honing Theory of creativity, according to which human-like creativity hinges on (1) the ability to self-organize and maintain dynamics at the 'edge of chaos' using something akin to 'psychological entropy', and (2) the capacity to shift between analytic and associative processing modes. At the 'edge of chaos', NW generates patterns that exhibit emergent complexity through coherent development at low, mid, and high levels of musical organization, and often suggests goal seeking behaviour. The architecture consists of four 16 -node modules: one each for pitch, velocity, duration, and <b>entry</b> <b>delay.</b> The Core allows users to define how nodes are connected, and rules that determine when and how nodes respond to their inputs.

It aims to provide seamless support to its users but an inevitable is that the long delay which occurs during the handoff management in every network process. This paper proposes a Dynamic Interval based Processing Algorithm to separate ping-pong users from the pool of users and to process them separately thus reducing the overhead of network re-entry process. Incoming users are divided into three categories like new user, old user and ping pong user. New user should undergo all the phases of network entry process, old user is provided with authentication key which leads to skipping of steps in generation of keys. Proposed algorithm deals with identifying the ping pong users by calculating the inter arrival duration and rate with same base station. When assured authenticated ping-pong users enter the network next time within the allotted time they will be provided with last used Traffic Encryption Key (TEK) thus bypassing key generation phase. It is observed that the proposed work performs the authentication phase and cancels the key generation phase which leads to minimum network <b>entry</b> <b>delay</b> and it saves to the maximum of 80 % processing time.

40|$|When cells divide, {{they must}} {{properly}} duplicate and segregate their genome to generate two identical daughter cells with faithful {{transmission of the}} genomic content. Errors in chromosome segregation lead to aneuploidy, a state of chromosomal imbalance where the karyotype is not an exact multiple of the haploid complement. At an organismal level, aneuploidy {{is the leading cause}} of miscarriage and developmental defects, while at a cellular level, aneuploidy causes proliferative defects and is detrimental to cell fitness. However, aneuploidy is also associated with cancer, a disease of uncontrolled proliferation. Understanding the effects of aneuploidy on cellular physiology has broad implications for many areas of human health. Here, I have characterized the G 1 delay in aneuploid S. cerevisiae. Aneuploid yeast exhibited a growth defect in G 1. Additionally, aneuploid cells displayed a cell cycle <b>entry</b> <b>delay</b> due to delayed accumulation of G 1 cyclins. Like other cellular stresses, aneuploidy interferes with the cell's ability to grow and to enter the cell cycle. I also developed a novel method to systematically examine the immediate consequences of gaining and-for the first time-losing single or multiple chromosomes. Using this system, I found that phenotypes wide-spread among aneuploid cells develop immediately following chromosome mis-segregation. Also, phenotypes common to chromosome gains are also wide-spread among cells that lost chromosomes, indicating that chromosome gains and losses fundamentally affect cells in similar ways. Finally, cell cycle analyses following chromosome mis-segregation revealed a surprising phenotypic variability among cells harboring the same aneuploidies. Together, these results provide insights into the mechanisms for the observed consequences of chromosome gains and losses on cellular physiology. by Rebecca Ruth Beach. Thesis: Ph.

Following incubation of stationary-phase cultures in water, mutants in dotA and dotB, essential for function of the type IVB secretion system, exhibited <b>entry</b> and <b>delay</b> of phagosome acidification comparable to that of strain JR 32. Following encystment in Acanthamoeba castellanii and reversion of cysts to amoeba trophozoites, dotA and dotB mutants exhibited intracellular multiplication in amoebae. The L. pneumophila Lvh locus, encoding a type IVA secretion system homologous to that in Agrobacterium tumefaciens, was required for restoration of entry and intracellular multiplication in dot/icm mutants following incubation in water and amoeba encystment and was required for delay of phagosome acidification in strain JR 32. These data support a model in which the Dot/Icm type IVB secretion system is conditionally rather than absolutely required for L. pneumophila virulence-related phenotypes. The data suggest that the Lvh type IVA secretion system, previously thought to be dispensable, is involved in virulence-related phenotypes under conditions mimicking the spread of Legionnaires' disease from environmental niches. Since environmental amoebae are implicated as reservoirs for an increasing number of environmental pathogens and for drug-resistant bacteria, the environmental mimics developed here may be useful in virulence studies of other pathogens...|$|R
