50|$|As {{a result}} of {{increasing}} biodiesel production, formation of the byproduct, crude glycerol, has also increased. While glycerol is commonly used in food, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and other industries, increased production of crude glycerol has become very expensive to purify and utilize in these industries. Because of this, researchers are interested in finding new economical ways to utilize low-grade glycerol products. Biotechnology is one such technique: using particular enzymes to break down crude glycerol to form products such as 1,3-propanediol, 1,2-propanediol, succinic acid, dihydroxyacetone (glycerone), hydrogen, polyglycerols, and polyesters. As a catalyst for the conversion of glycerol to glycerone, glycerol dehydrogenase is one such enzyme being investigated for this <b>industrial</b> <b>purpose.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{two major}} {{variations}} of the Cub were the [...] "Standard Cub" [...] and the [...] "Lo-Boy Cub" [...] (or [...] "Cub Lo-Boy"). They are recognized by their distinctive IH Red or Federal Yellow color schemes. In the late 1950s, sales of the Farmall Cub shifted from agricultural purpose to <b>industrial</b> <b>purpose.</b> IH capitalized on the shift, and the standard color for the Cub Lo-Boy and Cub changed from the familiar IH Red to Federal Yellow in 1960, with IH Red as an option. In 1963, International Harvester changed the grill of these tractors to a flat-grill style and dropped the Farmall name in favor of International. In 1981, the last production run of Cubs were painted IH Red.|$|E
50|$|Clause I {{declares}} that ground water use {{shall not be}} reckoned as river water use. In Godavari basin the ground water use exceeds surface / river water use in irrigation, etc. So the actual return flows available would not exceed 10% of primary water supply of the river. Thus as an exception in case of irrigation use, Clause II B aptly says that the extent of return flows shall not be deducted from the water lifted / diverted for the irrigation use (clause III A i). Also, it implies that return flows deduction is applicable for water uses under domestic & municipal water supply (clause III A iii) and <b>industrial</b> <b>purpose</b> (clause III A iv) {{at the rate of}} 80% and 97.5% respectively.|$|E

50|$|In the 1981 case of Diamond v. Diehr, the United States Supreme Court {{upheld the}} CCPA's {{reversal}} of the Patent Office, and ordered the {{grant of a patent}} on a process for curing rubber in a mold, a substantial part of which involved use of a computer program that used a well-known formula (the Arrhenius Equation) for calculating the time when rubber was cured and the mold could therefore be opened. The Supreme Court stated that in this case, the invention was not merely a mathematical algorithm, but a process for molding rubber, which used the mathematical formula for an <b>industrial</b> <b>purpose,</b> and was therefore patent eligible. In the Diehr case, there was no concession (as there was in Flook) that the implementation was conventional, and the process did effectuate a transformation of substances (from uncured rubber to cured rubber).|$|E

50|$|In an archetypal {{example of}} how to harness solar energy for <b>{{industrial}}</b> <b>purpose,</b> MitraaSamyoga a very close to heart project of Mr. Faizal, is an industrial entity under NI group of Institution, {{in the process of}} commissioning half a mega walt solar power plant in NIMS Medicity, the 350- bedded super speciality hospital at Neyyattinkara, Trivandrum. Mitraa meaning the Persil god of sun and samyoga in Sanskrit means synergy which is the interaction of multiple element in a system to produce an effect different from or greater than the sum of their individuals effect. Electricity generated from the solar plant, sprawling over 300000 sq. ft. area in the 24 acres hospital campus will be used to power the cardiac catheterization lab making it Asia's first green cardiac catheterization lab. The technology used was developed under the guidance of Padma Vibhushan Dr. G Madhavan Nair. The technology enables direct connection of solar power to the grid eliminating the need for storage batteries reducing the overall cost and investment. In case the power demand goes up the additional energy is taken up from the grid without any interruption or switch over. Even when the power grip fails generator back up is provided for a uninterrupted and reliable power source. MitraSamyoga is focused on providing renewable green energy for industrial purposes.|$|E
