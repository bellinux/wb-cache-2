50|$|An active {{magnetic}} bearing works {{on the principle of}} electromagnetic suspension and consists of an <b>electromagnet</b> <b>assembly,</b> a set of power amplifiers which supply current to the electromagnets, a controller, and gap sensors with associated electronics to provide the feedback required to control the position of the rotor within the gap. The power amplifier supplies equal bias current to two pairs of electromagnets on opposite sides of a rotor. This constant tug-of-war is mediated by the controller, which offsets the bias current by equal and opposite perturbations of current as the rotor deviates from its center position.|$|E
50|$|An active {{magnetic}} bearing (AMB) works {{on the principle of}} electromagnetic suspension and consists of an <b>electromagnet</b> <b>assembly,</b> a set of power amplifiers which supply current to the electromagnets, a controller, and gap sensors with associated electronics to provide the feedback required to control the position of the rotor within the gap. These elements are shown in the diagram. The power amplifiers supply equal bias current to two pairs of electromagnets on opposite sides of a rotor. This constant tug-of-war is mediated by the controller which offsets the bias current by equal but opposite perturbations of current as the rotor deviates by a small amount from its center position.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the possibility of}} using vertically magnetized model cores for wind tunnel Magnetic Suspension and Balance Systems (MSBS) in an effort to resolve the traditional "roll control" problem. A theoretical framework is laid out, based on previous work related to generic technology development efforts at NASA Langley Research Center. The impact of the new roll control scheme on traditional wind tunnel MSBS configurations is addressed, and the possibility of demonstrating the new scheme with an existing <b>electromagnet</b> <b>assembly</b> is explored. The specific system considered is the ex- Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), ex-NASA, 6 -inch MSBS currently in the process of recommissioning at Old Dominion University. This system has a sufficiently versatile electromagnet configuration such that straightforward "conversion" to vertically magnetized cores appears possible...|$|E
40|$|The {{inclusion}} of adequate versatility into the electromagnet array configuration requires sizing the electromagnets to satisfy particular absolute force and moment requirements. Magnetic {{performance of a}} permanent magnet model core, air cored electromagnet may easily and reliably be computed by using the FORCE program which calculates model forces and moments via representations of the model as an assembly of dipoles and the <b>electromagnets</b> as an <b>assembly</b> of line currents. Some aspects {{of the performance of}} an ellipsoidal iron cored model may be inferred from the above under certain circumstances...|$|R
40|$|Active Magnetic Bearings (AMB) are contact free {{bearings}} {{that support}} loads by magnetic levitation. This {{is accomplished by}} generating magnetic forces with electric current {{through a series of}} electromagnets surrounding a suspended rotor mass. Along with a set of <b>electromagnets,</b> an AMB <b>assembly</b> also consists of power amplifiers for each electromagnet, a controller, and proximity sensors. The proximity sensors provide rotor position feedback to the control system, which modulates power to the amplifiers [4]. Magnetic bearings are used in several industrial applications today, including but not limited to compressors, turbines, pumps, motors, and generators. Advantages of their utility include very low to no friction, longer life than bearings with lubrication (no wear), high operation speeds, environmental friendliness (oil and contamination free), and the ability to accommodate irregularities in the mass distribution automatically. Disadvantages include complexity, little to no damping, difficulty to control, and high cost. Magnetic bearings are finding increasing use as the technology progresses and components becomes less expensive...|$|R
40|$|According to specifications, {{lifetime}} of a linear stepping electromagnetic drive in WWER- 1000 nuclear reactors {{is limited by}} the pre-assigned lifetimes of the drive components such as <b>electromagnets,</b> a latch <b>assembly,</b> drive rack, and control rod position sensor. The {{lifetime of}} the drive components is from 7 to 20 years. On the basis of diagnostics of these components under real conditions, actual lifetimes of the components at nuclear power plant (NPP) were forecasted. It is shown that in order to extend the lifetime of the drive components up to the reactor lifetime (60 years), it is necessary to replace the sensor of the DPL-type by the new one (of the DPL-KV type) and to decrease the electromagnet temperature. The Measuring and Diagnostic System with the DPL-KV sensor enables diagnosing the sensor, electronic processing unit and drive. Economic effect due to the cumulative technical decisions is estimated to be 7 mln. euro per NPP unit...|$|R
40|$|An open-access {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) system is being developed for use in research on orientational/gravitational effects on lung physiology and function. The open-access geometry enables study of human subjects in diverse orientations. This system operates at a magnetic flux density, considerably smaller than the flux densities of typical other MRI systems, that can be generated by resistive electromagnet coils (instead of the more-expensive superconducting coils of the other systems). The human subject inhales air containing He- 3 or Xe- 129 atoms, the nuclear spins {{of which have been}} polarized by use of a laser beam to obtain a {{magnetic resonance}} that enables high-resolution gas space imaging at the low applied magnetic field. The system includes a bi-planar, constant-current, four-coil <b>electromagnet</b> <b>assembly</b> and associated electronic circuitry to apply a static magnetic field of 6. 5 mT throughout the lung volume; planar coils and associated circuitry to apply a pulsed magnetic-field-gradient for each spatial dimension; a single, detachable radio-frequency coil and associated circuitry for inducing and detecting MRI signals; a table for supporting a horizontal subject; and electromagnetic shielding surrounding the electromagnet coils...|$|E
40|$|Murine {{models are}} {{commonly}} used to investigate bone healing and test new treatments before human trials. Our objective was to design an improved murine femur fracture device and determine optimal mass and velocity settings for maximal likelihood of transverse fracture. Fracture reproducibility was maximized using an adjustable kinetic energy level, a novel mouse positioning system and an <b>electromagnet</b> striker release <b>assembly.</b> Sixty wild-type mice of 8 - 12 -week-old male and female with a weight of 26. 4 +/- 6. 1 g were subjected to an experimental postmortem fracture in {{the left and right}} femur (n= 120) using variable kinetic energy inputs. A best-fit prediction equation for transverse fracture was developed using multivariate linear regression. Transverse fracture was shown to correlate most highly with kinetic energy with a maximum likelihood at mv 2 = 292 where m is mass (g) and v is velocity (m/s). Model validation with a group of 134 anesthetized C 57 BL/ 6 mice resulted in a favorable transverse fracture rate of 85. 8 %. Simple modifications to existing fracture devices can improve accuracy and reproducibility. The results may assist researchers studying the effects of genetic modifications and novel treatments on boney healing in murine femur fracture models. Maintaining kinetic energy parameters within suggested ranges may also aid in ensuring accuracy and reproducibility...|$|R
