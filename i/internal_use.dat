5|$|After the Congress of Vienna {{there was}} a degree of {{commercial}} cooperation between the various German states resulting {{in the setting of}} the German Customs Union (Zollverein). There were however still many barriers to trade until Bavaria took the lead in establishing the General German Commercial Code in 1856. As part of the code the Zollverein introduce the Zollpfund (Customs Pound) which was defined to be exactly 500g and which could be split into 30'lot'. This unit was used for inter-state movement of goods, but was not applied in all states for <b>internal</b> <b>use.</b>|$|E
5|$|There {{are other}} missing B {{vitamins}} which were reclassified or {{determined not to}} be vitamins. For example, B9 is folic acid and five of the folates {{are in the range}} B11 through B16, forms of other vitamins already discovered, not required as a nutrient by the entire population (like B10, PABA for <b>internal</b> <b>use),</b> biologically inactive, toxic, or with unclassifiable effects in humans, or not generally recognised as vitamins by science, such as the highest-numbered, which some naturopath practitioners call B21 and B22. There are also nine lettered B complex vitamins (e.g. Bm). There are other D vitamins now recognised as other substances, which some sources of the same type number up to D7. The controversial cancer treatment laetrile was at one point lettered as vitamin B17. There appears to be no consensus on any vitamins Q, R, T, V, W, X, Y or Z, nor are there substances officially designated as Vitamins N or I, although the latter may have been another form of one of the other vitamins or a known and named nutrient of another type.|$|E

25|$|According to the BAe 146's chief designer, Bob Grigg, {{making the}} {{aircraft}} {{as easy to}} maintain as possible and keeping operators' running costs {{as low as possible}} were considered high priorities {{from the start of the}} design process. Grigg highlighted factors such as design simplicity, using off-the-shelf components where possible, and the <b>internal</b> <b>use</b> of firm cost targets and continuous monitoring. British Aerospace also adopted a system of cost guarantees between component suppliers and the operators of the BAe 146 in order to enforce stringent requirements.|$|E

25|$|Muscle cell {{glycogen}} {{appears to}} function as an immediate reserve source of available glucose for muscle cells. Other cells that contain small amounts use it locally, as well. As muscle cells lack glucose-6-phosphatase, which is required to pass glucose into the blood, the glycogen they store is available solely for <b>internal</b> <b>use</b> and is not shared with other cells. This {{is in contrast to}} liver cells, which, on demand, readily do break down their stored glycogen into glucose and send it through the blood stream as fuel for other organs.|$|E

25|$|Before Wright, the library's {{catalogue}} evolved through annual addenda to its 1842 founding catalogue. The {{practice was}} unsatisfactory, and Wright concentrated on producing a proper modern catalogue. The first edition, compiled by Wright and Christopher Purnell, was printed in 1903; {{the second in}} 1913â€“14. It contained 1626 pages; supplementary volumes were printed in 1920 and 1929. The catalogue was arranged in six volumes {{for the general public}} and in 38 folio volumes for daily <b>internal</b> <b>use.</b> In addition, Wright published a companion Subject Index (1909, 1923, 1938). His catalogues earned reputation for scrupulous research and attribution of anonymous and pseudonymous publications, and became a standard reference source for British and overseas librarians. His catalogue system forms the foundation of present-day electronic database.|$|E
25|$|Bill Gates {{claimed that}} the Apple II family with a Z-80 SoftCard was the single most-popular CP/M {{hardware}} platform. Many different brands of machines ran the operating system, some notable examples being the Altair 8800, the IMSAI 8080, the Osborne 1 and Kaypro luggables, and MSX computers. The best-selling CP/M-capable system of all time was probably the Amstrad PCW. In the UK, CP/M was also available on Research Machines educational computers (with the CP/M source code published as an educational resource), and for the BBC Micro when equipped with a Z80 co-processor. Furthermore, it was available for the Amstrad CPC series, the Commodore 128, TRS-80, and later models of the ZX Spectrum. CP/M 3 was also used on the NIAT, a custom handheld computer designed for A.C. Nielsen's <b>internal</b> <b>use</b> with 1Mbytes of SSD memory.|$|E
500|$|Plan 9 {{replaced}} Unix as Bell Labs's primary {{platform for}} operating systems research. It explored several {{changes to the}} original Unix model that facilitate the use and programming of the system, notably in distributed multi-user environments. After several years of development and <b>internal</b> <b>use,</b> Bell Labs shipped the operating system to universities in 1992. Three years later, in 1995, Plan 9 was made available for commercial parties by AT via the book publisher Harcourt Brace. With source licenses costing $350, AT targeted the embedded systems market rather than the computer market at large; Ritchie commented that the developers {{did not expect to}} do [...] "much displacement" [...] given how established other operating systems had become.|$|E

The attack {{is based on a}} list of seemingly useless projects, but by association, her real target becomes the president's daughter Ellie, who is working on a study into the Human papillomavirus that researched conditions for prostitutes in Puerto Rico. The President is infuriated at having a family member dragged into political battles, and Toby tries to discredit the attack by finding its source. At first the list seems to originate from a far-right group called the [...] "Traditional Values Alliance", but Toby's assistant Rena uncovers an updated list that shows it came from within the administration. Toby immediately suspects the Vice President's office. When confronted, Will takes full responsibility, and assures that the list was compiled purely for <b>internal</b> <b>use</b> and not leaked on purpose. Will suspects that his boss might have leaked the material on purpose, however, and Russell in private agrees he has ties to the Republicans on health issues and notes that having some distance from the President isn't a bad thing for him. Will is left utterly disgusted with the VP.|$|E

2500|$|When UPS ground {{vehicles}} {{reach the}} end of their useful service life and are no longer roadworthy (typically 20â€“25 years or more, but generally when the body's structural integrity is compromised), they are almost always stripped of reusable parts, repainted in household paint to cover up the trademark, and then sent to the scrapyard to be crushed and broken up. The only exception to this policy is when a package car is repainted white for <b>internal</b> <b>use,</b> usually at a large hub. Prior to scrapping, UPS trucks and trailers are assigned an ADA (Automotive Destruction Authorization) number and must be crushed under supervision of UPS Automotive personnel, which records the vehicle's destruction, as UPS does not re-sell any of its ground vehicles.|$|E
