In this context, {{it is natural}} {{to ask about the}} fate of trajectories composed of interfaces between steady configurations with periodic pattern and in particular, to study their propagation as traveling fronts. Here, we investigate such fronts in piecewise affine bistable recursions on the one-dimensional lattice. By introducing a definition inspired by symbolic dynamics, we prove the existence of front solutions and uniqueness of their velocity, upon the existence of their <b>ground</b> <b>patterns.</b> Moreover, the velocity dependence on parameters and the co-existence of several fronts with distinct <b>ground</b> <b>patterns</b> are also described.

5000|$|The {{breeding}} season is mainly March to August. The courtship involves the male puffing its feathers and pointing its beak upwards. The male then shuffles around the female. Several males may display to females {{and they may}} be close together. The eggs are laid in a ground scrape or depression sometimes fringed with pebbles, goat or hare droppings. About 3-4 black-blotched buff eggs shaped a bit like a peg-top (...) , 42x30 mm on average. Nests are difficult to find since the eggs are cryptically coloured and usually matches the <b>ground</b> <b>pattern.</b> In residential areas, they sometimes take to nesting on roof-tops. They have been recorded nesting on the stones between the rails of a railway track, the adult leaving the nest when trains passed. Nests that have been threatened by agricultural operations have been manually translocated by gradually shifting the eggs. When nesting they will attempt to dive bomb or distract potential predators. Both the male and female incubate the eggs and divert predators using distraction displays or flash their wings to deter any herbivores that threaten the nest. Males appear to relieve females incubating at the nest particularly towards the hot part of noon. The eggs hatch in 28 to 30 days. The reproductive success is about 40%. Egg mortality is high (~43%) due to predation by mongooses, crows and kites. Chicks had a lower mortality (8.3%) and their survival improved after the first week.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that language learners prefer phonologically natural patterns over unnatural ones (McCarthy & Prince, 1995; Tesar & Smolensky, 1993, 2000). Various researchers have cited evidence for this assertion based on production (Demuth, 1995; Gnanadesikan, 1995) and perception (Jusczyk, Smolensky, & Allocco, 2002). Two experiments presented in this article test whether 9 -month-old infants learn unmarked, phonetically <b>grounded</b> <b>patterns</b> more easily than marked, arbitrary ones. Experiment 1 tested phonetically <b>grounded</b> and arbitrary <b>patterns</b> involving manner of articulation; results revealed that infants showed no specific preference for the <b>grounded</b> <b>patterns.</b> Experiment 2 tested a pattern in place of articulation; once again, infants showed no specific preference for the grounded distributions. We take this as evidence that infants can, in fact, learn arbitrary phonological patterns and as evidence against a bias for <b>grounded</b> <b>patterns</b> in the grammar of infants at this age. Do Not Copy Certain sound patterns are frequently found in the world’s languages; many others may be rare or unattested. For example, the assimilation of a nasal consonant to the place of articulation of a following stop, such as /anpa / becoming [ampa], is extremely common across languages and is seen in English in-ept versus im-possible. Assimilation in the opposite direction, such as /anpa / becoming [anta], is quite unusual, if it occurs at all. Although a variety of factors might play a role in such asymmetries, including overall complexity of cognitive representations, the crucial explanation in nasal assimilation and many other phonological patterns is that the direction of change is phonetically grounded (cf.

40|$|Within the {{research}} done at Fraunhofer IOSB in Karlsruhe {{in the area}} of civil security, various types of sensor/sensor systems, ground vehicles and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), have been used in the project AMFIS for some years. When it comes to aerial situation overview and reconnaissance, {{the research}} is focused primarily on electrically operated Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) systems which can be operated easily by police or rescue forces on account of the simple use and the good maneuverability even during applications in urban areas. One of the main research intentions of AMFIS is the further reduction of workload for the operator in scenarios where multiple and complex networks of different sensors and sensor carriers are used.

40|$|The {{research}} {{done at the}} Fraunhofer IOSB in Karlsruhe within the AMFIS project is focusing on a mobile system to support rescue forces in accidents or disasters. The system consists of a ground control station which has the capability to communicate {{with a large number}} of heterogeneous sensors and sensor carriers and provides several open interfaces to allow easy integration of additional sensors into the system. Within this research we focus mainly on UAV such as VTOL (Vertical takeoff and Landing) systems because of their ease of use and their high maneuverability. To increase the positioning capability of the UAV, different onboard processing chains of image exploitation for real time detection of patterns on the ground and the interfacing technology for controlling the UAV from the payload during flight were examined. The earlier proposed static <b>ground</b> <b>pattern</b> was extended by an adaptive component which admits an additional visual communication channel to the aircraft. For this purpose different components were conceived to transfer additive information using changeable patterns on the ground. The adaptive <b>ground</b> <b>pattern</b> and their application suitability had to be tested under external influence. Beside the adaptive <b>ground</b> <b>pattern,</b> the onboard process chains and the adaptations to the demands of changing patterns are introduced in this paper. The tracking of the guiding points, the UAV navigation and the conversion of the guiding point positions from the images to real world co-ordinates in video sequences, as well as use limits and the possibilities of an adaptable pattern are examined...|$|E

40|$|AbstractOne of {{the long-standing}} {{questions}} in zoology {{is that on}} the phylogenetic relationships within the Arthropoda. Comparative studies on structure {{and development of the}} nervous system can contribute important arguments to this discussion. In the present report, the arrangement of serotonin- and engrailed-expressing cells was examined in the embryonic ventral nerve cord of the American lobster Homarus americanus Milne Edwards, 1873 (Malacostraca, Pleocyemata, Homarida), and the spatial relationship of these two cell classes was explored by a double-labelling approach. The goal {{of this study was to}} determine whether the lobster serotonergic neurons are homologous to similar cells present in representatives of the Hexapoda and other Arthropoda. The results indicate that, in fact, these neurons in the lobster ventral nerve cord have corresponding counterparts in many other mandibulate taxa. Based on the finding of these homologies, the arrangement of serotonergic neurons in a model trunk ganglion of the mandibulate <b>ground</b> <b>pattern</b> was reconstructed as comprising an anterior and a posterior pair of serotonergic neurons per hemiganglion, each cell with both an ipsilateral and a contralateral neurite. Starting from this <b>ground</b> <b>pattern,</b> the evolutionary diversification of this class of neurons within the Mandibulata is discussed...|$|E
40|$|SummaryExcept {{in species}} that have {{undergone}} evolved loss, paired lobed centers {{referred to as}} “mushroom bodies” occur across invertebrate phyla [1 – 5]. Unresolved {{is the question of}} whether these centers, which support learning and memory in insects, correspond genealogically or whether their neuronal organization suggests convergent evolution.  Here, anatomical and immunohistological observations demonstrate that across phyla, mushroom body-like centers share a neuroanatomical <b>ground</b> <b>pattern</b> and proteins required for memory formation. Paired lobed or dome-like neuropils characterize the first brain segment (protocerebrum) of mandibulate and chelicerate arthropods and the nonganglionic brains of polychaete annelids, polyclad planarians, and nemerteans. Structural and cladistic analyses resolve an ancestral <b>ground</b> <b>pattern</b> common to all investigated taxa: chemosensory afferents supplying thousands of intrinsic neurons, the parallel processes of which establish orthogonal networks with feedback loops, modulatory inputs, and efferents. Shared ground patterns and their selective labeling with antisera against proteins required for normal mushroom body function in Drosophila are indicative of genealogical correspondence and thus an ancestral presence predating arthropod and lophotrochozoan origins. Implications of this are considered in the context of mushroom body function and early ecologies of ancestral bilaterians...|$|E
