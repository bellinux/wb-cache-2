5|$|The {{wide variety}} of birds in Basse Casamance was noted by early explorers. While Basse Casamance National Park and Kalissaye Avifaunal Reserve have not been open for years due to the Casamance Conflict, Carabane {{has been found to}} be very conducive to ornithological observation. A study in 1998 {{discovered}} the following species on the island: African darter (Anhinga rufa), <b>Goliath</b> <b>heron</b> (Ardea goliath), palm-nut vulture (Gypohierax angolensis), black-tailed godwit (Limosa limosa), whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus), Eurasian curlew (Numenius arquata), Caspian tern (Sterna caspia), blue-spotted wood-dove (Turtur afer), red-eyed dove (Streptopelia semitorquata), white-rumped swift (Apus caffer), woodland kingfisher (Halcyon senegalensis), grey-backed camaroptera (Camaroptera brachyura), red-bellied paradise-flycatcher (Terpsiphone rufiventer), pied crow (Corvus albus), black-rumped waxbill (Estrilda troglodytres) and yellow-fronted canary (Serinus mozambicus).|$|E
50|$|As well as flamingos, {{there are}} myriad other bird species that inhabit the lake and the area {{surrounding}} it, such as African fish eagle, <b>Goliath</b> <b>heron,</b> hamerkop, pied kingfisher and Verreaux's eagle among others.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Goliath</b> <b>heron</b> (Ardea goliath), {{also known}} as the giant heron, is a very large wading bird of the heron family, Ardeidae. It is found in sub-Saharan Africa, with smaller numbers in Southwest and South Asia.|$|E
50|$|Notable birdlife include <b>Goliath</b> <b>herons,</b> openbill storks and {{the rare}} white-winged starling. Lake Kazuni {{is located in}} the reserve and {{supports}} a notable hippo population.|$|R
50|$|There is a {{great variety}} of birdlife and for the birdwatcher, the park is a paradise, Included amongst the several bird species are: South African ostrich, African openbills, barbets, bee-eaters, buzzards, coots, cormorants, doves, hamerkops, jacanas, kingfishers, grey <b>herons,</b> darters, <b>Goliath</b> <b>herons,</b> fish eagles, glossy {{starlings}} and lilac-breasted rollers.|$|R
2500|$|The cheetah exhibit, a [...] long, [...] {{wide area}} {{is home to}} two cheetahs. It lies across a water break from the larger exhibit {{containing}} southern white rhinoceroses, greater kudu, sitatungas, a north African ostrich, black-crowned cranes, and <b>goliath</b> <b>herons</b> inhabit the areas {{at the end of}} the boardwalk. This [...] exhibit allows plenty of room for the animals to roam. The zoo has been a successful breeder of southern white rhinos, with over a dozen successful births.|$|R
50|$|Over 400 {{species of}} birds have been {{recorded}} within the Zambezi National Park. Pel's fishing owl, African skimmer, collared palm thrush, lanner falcon, <b>goliath</b> <b>heron,</b> African finfoot, rock pratincole and long-toed lapwing {{are considered to be}} among the speciality birds of the park.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{the largest}} North American heron and, among all extant herons, it is surpassed only by the <b>goliath</b> <b>heron</b> (Ardea goliath) and the white-bellied heron (Ardea insignis). It has head-to-tail length of 91 - 137 cm, a {{wingspan}} of 167 - 201 cm, a height of 115 - 138 cm, and a weight of 1.82 - 3.6 kg. In British Columbia, adult males averaged 2.48 kg and adult females 2.11 kg. In Nova Scotia and New England, adult herons of both sexes averaged 2.23 kg, while in Oregon, both sexes averaged 2.09 kg Thus, great blue herons are roughly twice as heavy as great egrets (Ardea alba), although only slightly taller than them, but they can weigh about {{half as much as}} a large <b>goliath</b> <b>heron.</b>|$|E
5000|$|MFCA and the {{adjacent}} Bugondo Forest Reserve have 76 species of mammals {{as well as}} Uganda's largest population of crocodiles. 450 bird species are present ranging from easy variety of waterbirds, including the rare shoe-billed stork, Bugondo's 59 [...] "restricted range" [...] species, dwarf kingfisher, <b>Goliath</b> <b>heron,</b> white-thighed hornbill and great blue turaco.|$|E
50|$|Large {{flocks of}} greater {{flamingos}} from Iran and the Rann of Kutch in Gujarat, feed {{in the shallow}} waters of the lake. Other-long legged waders seen around Nalbana Island are the lesser flamingos, <b>Goliath</b> <b>herons,</b> grey herons, and purple herons, egrets, spoonbills, storks and black-headed ibis.Rare birds reported in the lake are Asiatic dowitchers (NT), Dalmatian pelican (VU), Pallas's fish-eagles (VU), the very rare migrant spoon-billed sandpiper (CR) and spot-billed pelican (NT).The white-bellied sea eagle, pariah kite, brahminy kites, kestrel, marsh harriers, and the world's most widespread bird of prey, the peregrine falcon, are among the raptors seen here.|$|R
50|$|Like other sea eagles, the African {{fish eagle}} has {{structures}} on its toes called spiricules that {{allow it to}} grasp fish and other slippery prey. The osprey, a winter visitor to Africa, also has this adaptation. Should the African fish eagle catch a fish over 1.8 kg, it is too heavy to allow the eagle to get lift, so it instead drags the fish {{across the surface of}} the water until it reaches the shore. If it catches a fish too heavy to allow the eagle to sustain flight, it will drop into the water and paddle to the nearest shore with its wings. The African fish eagle is known to peculate other bird species (such as <b>goliath</b> <b>herons)</b> of their catch in a behaviour known as kleptoparasitism. It also feeds on waterfowl such as ducks, small turtles and terrapins, baby crocodiles, greater and lesser flamingos, lizards, frogs, and carrion. Occasionally, it may even carry off mammalian prey, such as hyraxes and monkeys. It has also been observed feeding on domestic fowl (chickens).|$|R
50|$|Its {{breeding}} season coincides generally with {{the start of}} the rainy season, which is around November to March. In some areas, breeding is year around, with no discernable peak season. Breeding may not occur every year. Fairly adaptable in their nesting site selection, <b>Goliath</b> <b>herons</b> generally prefer to nest on islands or islands of vegetation. The birds may abandon a nesting site if the island becomes attached to the mainland. Lakes or other large bodies of water usually hold colonies. They nest fairly low in variously sedge, reeds, bushes, trees or even on rocks or large tree stumps. The nesting dispersal seems highly variable as everything from a solitary pair (with no other Goliath nests anywhere near) to fairly large colonies have been observed, with no seeming local geographical preferences. Occasionally, they may join mixed-species colonies including other heron species, cormorants, darters, ibises and gulls. The breeding displays are not well known and may be subdued, due in part to breeding pairs possibly reunited year after year. The nests are large but often flimsy (depending on available vegetation around the nesting site), often measuring around 1 to 1.5 m in diameter.|$|R
50|$|Common mammals are kudu, oryx, springbok, steenbok, Hartmann's Mountain Zebra, red {{hartebeest}} and ostrich. There {{is also a}} small {{population of}} black rhino. Nearly 300 bird species are found here, including Yellow-billed stork, Osprey, African fish eagle, <b>Goliath</b> <b>heron,</b> Bradfield's swift and Stark's lark. The dam {{has one of the}} three largest Great white pelican breeding colonies in Namibia.|$|E
50|$|Mangrove swamps are {{important}} feeding grounds for fish, birds and animals. Marine wildlife includes oysters and shrimps. Mammals found here include the African manatee. Birds in these wet habitats include <b>Goliath</b> <b>heron,</b> purple heron, cattle egret, striated heron, western reef heron, greater flamingo, lesser flamingo, African spoonbill, and African sacred ibis. The forests also provide important habitat for migratory birds.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Goliath</b> <b>heron</b> has a {{distinct}} deep bark, often described as kowoork, audible from a distances of up to 2 km. A disturbance call (arrk), sharper and higher, can also occasionally be heard. A huh-huh is given during the crouched stage, while a krooo may be heard with the neck extended. Organ-like duetting has been reported at nest sites but has not been confirmed.|$|E
25|$|The Wilds of Africa Adventure Safari is a 20-minute, one-mile, narrated {{monorail}} ride, which travels {{around the}} watering hole (hippopotamus) rain forest (okapi), mountain (Nubian ibex), woodlands (Grévy's zebra), river (waterbuck, greate white pallicans, <b>Goliath</b> <b>herons,</b> blue cranes), arid desert (scimitar-horned oryx, addra gazelle), semi-arid desert (addax, gemsbok, ostrich) and bush (gerenuk, red-crowned cranes, greater kudu, Thomson's gazelle, marabou storks) exhibits. The monorail features aerial {{views of the}} Simmons Hippo Outpost, Chimpanzee Forest, Nile crocodile, and Penguin Cove exhibits, which are also accessible via the Nature Trail. The monorail originally opened in 1990 but {{after two decades of}} use and over a million passengers, the attraction began to show its age with aging infrastructure and several electrical outages that left passengers stranded on the tour. The final incident in August 2014 prompted zoo officials to shut down the attraction for evaluation. Following the evaluation the DZS decided a $3 million renovation was in order. On March 25, 2016, the Monorail Safari reopened as the Wilds of Africa Adventure Safari featuring a new sound system, an upgraded station, air-conditioning, upgraded mechanical and electrical components and new graphics on the individual cars. Additionally, a diesel powered tug is now on standby to nudge the trains back to the station {{in the event of a}} power failure.|$|R
50|$|<b>Goliath</b> <b>herons</b> are solitary foragers and {{are highly}} {{territorial}} towards other Goliaths entering their feeding territories. On occasions, two {{may be seen}} together but these {{are most likely to}} be a breeding pair or immatures. A diurnal and often rather inactive feeder, this heron often hunts by standing in the shallows, intently watching the water at its feet. This is a typical feeding method among large Ardea herons and it can forage in deeper waters than most due to its larger size. It may also perch on heavy floating vegetation, in order to prevent water from rippling around them. As prey appears, the heron rapidly spears it with open mandibles, often spearing both mandibles through the fish's body, and then swallows it whole. It is possible that the bill is used in a lure-like fashion occasionally, attracting fish to the immobile, large object submerged in the water. The handling period is long, with herons often placing their struggling prey on floating vegetation while preparing to swallow it. Due to its generally slow movements and handling time, the Goliath is frequently vulnerable to kleptoparasitism. In Africa, African fish eagles frequently pirate food caught by Goliaths, although other large birds such as saddle-billed storks and pelicans may also steal their prey.|$|R

50|$|The {{only known}} endemic bird species is the black-tailed cisticola (Cisticola melanura) {{although}} there is a fairly rich selection of bird life. Following rains the following {{can be found in the}} wetlands: greater swamp-warbler (Acrocephalus rufescens), African yellow warbler (Iduna natalensis), chirping cisticola (Cisticola pipiens), Bocage's weaver (Ploceus temporalis), saddle-billed stork (Ephippiorhynchus senegalensis), marabou stork (Leptoptilos crumeniferus), <b>Goliath</b> <b>heron</b> (Ardea goliath), and wattled crane (Bugeranus carunculatus).|$|E
50|$|More than 500 {{species of}} birds live in the Gambia. The Bijilo Forest Park and the Abuko are {{important}} bird habitats. Faunal species seen here are the pelicans, spoonbills, yellow-billed stork (Mycteria ibis), <b>Goliath</b> <b>heron</b> (Ardea goliath), blue-cheeked bee-eater (Merops persicus), mouse-brown sunbird (Anthreptes gabonicus), African fish eagle (Hieraaetus spilogaster) (in the river valleys). Wetland bird species are Dendrocygna viduata, sacred ibis (Threskiornis aethiopicus), palm-nut vulture (Gypohierax angolensis), crakes, greater painted snipe (Rostratula benghalensis) and African jacana (Actophilornis africanus).|$|E
50|$|The {{order of}} Ciconiiformes is {{represented}} by birds like western reef heron (Egretta gularis), little egret (Egretta garzetta), woolly-necked stork (Ciconia episcopus), hammerkop (Scopus umbretta), squacco heron (Ardeola ralloides), little bittern (Ixobrychus minutus), <b>Goliath</b> <b>heron</b> (Ardea goliath), great egret (Egretta alba, marabou (Leptoptilos crumeniferus), night heron (Nycticorax nycticorax), grey heron (Ardea cinerea), cattle egret (Bubulcus ibis) and the sacred ibis (Threskiornis aethiopicus). With their long legs, this division of birds searches the river banks for food.|$|E
5000|$|Predators of Nile {{crocodiles}} eggs {{have ranged}} from insects such as {{the red flour beetle}} (Tribolium castaneum) to predators as large and formidable as spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta). Unsurprisingly, once exposed to the elements as hatchlings, the young, small Nile crocodiles are even more vulnerable. Most of the predators of eggs also opportunistically eat young crocodiles, including monitors and marabous, plus almost all co-existing raptorial birds, including vultures, eagles, and large owls and buzzards. Many [...] "large waders" [...] are virulent predators of crocodile hatchlings, from dainty little egrets (Egretta garzetta) and compact hamerkops (Scopus umbretta) to towering saddle-billed storks (Ephippiorhynchus senegalensis), <b>goliath</b> <b>herons</b> and shoebills (Balaeniceps rex). Larger corvids and some non-wading water birds (i.e. pelicans) can also take some young Nile crocodiles. Mammalian carnivores take many hatchlings as well as large turtles and snakes, large predatory freshwater fish, such as the African tigerfish, the introduced largemouth bass, and possibly bull sharks, when they enter river systems. When crocodile nests are dug out and the young placed in water by the mother, in areas such as Royal Natal National Park predators can essentially enter a feeding frenzy. It may take a few years before predation is no longer a major cause of mortality for young crocodiles. African fish eagles can take crocodile hatchlings up to a few months of age and honey badgers can prey on yearlings. Once they reach their juvenile stage, very large African rock pythons and big cats remain as the only predatory threat to young crocodiles. Perhaps no predator is more deadly to young Nile crocodiles than larger crocodiles of their own species, as, like most crocodilians, they are cannibalistic. This species may be particularly dangerous to their own kind considering the aggressive disposition they tend to bear. While the mother crocodile will react aggressively towards potential predators and has been recorded chasing and occasionally catching and killing such interlopers into her range, due to the sheer number of animals who feed on baby crocodiles and the large number of hatchlings, she is more often than not unsuccessful at deflecting such predators.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Goliath</b> <b>heron</b> is very aquatic, even by heron standards, rarely venturing {{far from}} a water source and preferring to fly along {{waterways}} rather than move over land. Important habitats can include lakes, swamps, mangrove wetlands, reefs with few cool water, sometimes river deltas. It typically is found in shallows, though can be observed near deep water over dense water vegetation. Goliath herons can even be found in small watering holes. They have ranged in elevation from sea level to 2100 m. They tend to prefer pristine wetlands and generally avoid areas where human disturbances are a regular occurrence.|$|E
50|$|Large {{flocks of}} greater {{flamingos}} from Iran and the Rann of Kutch in Gujarat, feed {{in the shallow}} waters of the lake. Other-long legged waders seen around Nalbana Island are the lesser flamingos, <b>Goliath</b> <b>heron,</b> grey herons, purple herons, egrets, spoonbills, storks and black-headed ibis. Rare birds reported in the lake are Asiatic dowitchers (NT), Dalmatian pelican (VU), Pallas's fish-eagles (VU), the very rare migrant spoon-billed sandpiper (CR) and spot-billed pelican (NT). The white-bellied sea eagle, pariah kite, brahminy kites, kestrel, marsh harriers, and the world's most widespread bird of prey, peregrine falcon, are among the raptors seen here.|$|E
5000|$|Cretzschmar was {{the founder}} and second {{director}} of the Senckenberg Natural History Society in 1817. One of the founding {{members of the society}} was Eduard Rüppell, and the two men collaborated in publishing the results of Rüppell's explorations in Africa. The Atlas zu der reise im nördlichen Afrika ("Atlas of Rüppell's Travels in Northern Africa"; 1826-28) [...] included an ornithological section by Cretzschmar describing around thirty new species, including Meyer's parrot, Nubian bustard, <b>Goliath</b> <b>heron,</b> streaked scrub warbler and Cretzschmar's bunting. In the field of mammalogy, he is the binomial author of the scimitar-horned oryx and Soemmerring's gazelle.|$|E
50|$|Prey {{almost entirely}} {{consists}} of fish. The <b>Goliath</b> <b>heron</b> specializes in relatively large fish, {{with an average}} prey weight range in Natal of 500 - 600 g and length of 30 cm. Exceptionally, the largest fish targeted may measure 50 cm although the heron {{may not be able}} to swallow prey up to this size. Small fish are generally ignored and the average Goliath catches around 2 or 3 fish a day. Breams, mullet, tilapia and carp have locally been recorded as preferred species. Any other small animals that they come across may be eaten, including frogs, prawns, small mammals, lizards, snakes, insects and even carrion.|$|E
50|$|The {{wide variety}} of birds in Basse Casamance was noted by early explorers. While Basse Casamance National Park and Kalissaye Avifaunal Reserve have not been open for years due to the Casamance Conflict, Carabane {{has been found to}} be very conducive to ornithological observation. A study in 1998 {{discovered}} the following species on the island: African darter (Anhinga rufa), <b>Goliath</b> <b>heron</b> (Ardea goliath), palm-nut vulture (Gypohierax angolensis), black-tailed godwit (Limosa limosa), whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus), Eurasian curlew (Numenius arquata), Caspian tern (Sterna caspia), blue-spotted wood-dove (Turtur afer), red-eyed dove (Streptopelia semitorquata), white-rumped swift (Apus caffer), woodland kingfisher (Halcyon senegalensis), grey-backed camaroptera (Camaroptera brachyura), red-bellied paradise-flycatcher (Terpsiphone rufiventer), pied crow (Corvus albus), black-rumped waxbill (Estrilda troglodytres) and yellow-fronted canary (Serinus mozambicus).|$|E
5000|$|This large heron {{is plain}} dark grey above {{with a long}} neck. The crown is dark {{and there are no}} black stripes on the neck as in the grey heron. In {{breeding}} plumage, it has a greyish-white nape plume and elongated grey breast feathers with white centers. The bill is black, greenish near the base and tip and the face is greenish grey. The bill is large and solid, with the culmen measuring 15.2 - 17.6 cm. The chin and central portion of the underside are whitish in color (per the common name), contrasting strongly against the dark grey color on the back. The legs are blackish with scale-like texture on the tarsus which measures 17.1 to 21.6 cm. In flight, it has a uniform dark grey upperwing and white underwing-coverts contrasting with dark grey flight feathers. The rump appears paler grey.At 127 cm (50 in) in height, it is the second largest heron on earth, after the <b>Goliath</b> <b>heron.</b> Included in the length, the mid-sized tail measures 19.9 to 21.6 cm. The wing chord measures 54.6 to 57.2 cm, with an estimated wingspan of 2 m or more. One estimate of body mass was relatively low at 2 - 2.6 kg, however a deceased juvenile of the species reportedly weighed much more at 5.6 kg. [...] Another dead juvenile heron stood 1.58 m tall and weighed 8.51 kg. These extremely high weights require verification, since they indicate this species can exceed even the typically larger <b>Goliath</b> <b>heron</b> in mass. On the ground it walks slowly, moving its neck slowly while looking from side to side. The Goliath species, beyond the average size difference, is distinguished by its chestnut neck while the slightly smaller great-billed heron is solid grey necked with the underside of the wings all grey.|$|E
50|$|Chilika Lake is a {{brackish}} water lagoon {{on the east}} coast of Odisha with an area of 1105 km2. It is connected to the Bay of Bengal by a 35-km-long narrow channel and {{is a part of the}} Mahanadi delta. In the dry season, the tides bring in salt water. In the rainy season, the rivers falling into the lagoon decrease its salinity. Birds from places like the Caspian Sea, Lake Baikal, other parts of Russia, Central Asia, South-East Asia, Ladakh and the Himalayas migrate to the lagoon in winter. Among the birds spotted there are Eurasian wigeon, pintail, bar-headed goose, greylag goose, flamingo, mallard and <b>Goliath</b> <b>heron.</b> The lagoon also has a small population of the endangered Irrawaddy dolphins. The state's coastal region has also had sightings of finless porpoise, bottlenose dolphin, humpback dolphin and spinner dolphin in its waters.|$|E
50|$|Eggs are pale blue, {{averaging}} 72 by 54 mm {{and weighing}} around 108 g. The clutch size {{can range from}} 2 to 5 (usually 3 or 4). Incubation lasts 24 to 30 days. Although they can sometimes replace clutches, often only around 25% of eggs succeed in hatching due to various environmental conditions or predation. The young are fed by regurgitation in the nest and, after a few weeks, can bill jab and practice defensive postures against each other. At around five weeks they leave the nest completely. The parents continue to tend to them for variously 40 to 80 days. Around 62% of fledgings who successfully leave the nest survive to adulthood. Locally, the white-tailed eagle and the African fish eagle may be a predator at colonies. Due its size and formidable bill, the full-grown <b>Goliath</b> <b>heron</b> may not have any regular avian predators. Despite their ponderous movements, Goliath herons can think quickly and often take flight before mammalian carnivores (such as hyenas or jackals) can predate them.|$|E
50|$|The herons are medium- to large-sized {{birds with}} long legs and necks. They exhibit very little sexual {{dimorphism}} in size. The smallest species is usually considered the little bittern, which can measure under 30 cm in length, although all the {{species in the}} Ixobrychus genus are small and many broadly overlap in size. The largest species of heron is the <b>goliath</b> <b>heron,</b> which stands up to 152 cm tall. The necks are able to kink in an S-shape, due to the modified shape of the cervical vertebrae, of which they have 20-21. The neck is able to retract and extend, and is retracted during flight, unlike most other long-necked birds. The neck is longer in the day herons than the night herons and bitterns. The legs are long and strong and in almost every species are unfeathered from {{the lower part of}} the tibia (the exception is the zigzag heron). In flight, the legs and feet are held backward. The feet of herons have long, thin toes, with three forward-pointing ones and one pointing backward.|$|E
50|$|Elephants and hippos {{might be}} the main {{attraction}} for most visitors, but Liwonde National Park is an important site for birdwatching, with a very different species composition from most of Malawi's avian hotspots. More than 400 species have been recorded. Most notable are the water-associated birds such as the African fish eagle, the pied kingfisher, the saddle-billed stork and <b>goliath</b> <b>heron.</b> This national park {{is one of the}} best places to find a few rarer water-associated birds: among them Pel's fishing owl, red-necked falcon, palm-nut vulture, rufous-bellied heron and white-backed night heron. It is also the only site in Malawi for spur-winged lapwing, a species that had never been recorded in the country until a vagrant pair pitched up in the late 1990s, since when it has established itself along the river in substantial numbers. Away from the water, birds of prey are very well represented. The bateleur, martial eagle and all three snake eagles are quite common and also the southern ground hornbill is present. The park is home to several localised woodland species, such as brown-breasted barbet, Boehm's bee-eater, Lilian's lovebird, Livingstone's flycatcher, collared palm thrush and green twinspot, along with more sparsely distributed mopane specialists such as racket-tailed roller and pale-billed hornbill.|$|E
50|$|The {{purple heron}} usually breeds in colonies but {{sometimes}} the nests are solitary. It sometimes associates with other species such as the <b>goliath</b> <b>heron</b> (Ardea goliath) or grey heron at multi-species nesting colonies. The site chosen is generally in reed beds, canebrakes or low bushes close to large lakes or other extensive wetlands. It builds a bulky nest of dead reeds, sticks or whatever is available, carelessly pulling the material together. The eggs are bluish-green, averaging 56 by 45 mm. The clutch is usually four or five eggs, with occasionally seven or eight eggs being laid, though these large clutches may have resulted from two females laying in the same nest. The eggs are laid at intervals of three days, and incubation may begin with the first egg, or start when the clutch is complete. Both parents share the incubation, which lasts between 24 and 28 days, and {{the care of the}} young. When an adult brings food, its beak is dragged down by the chicks and it regurgitates food from the crop onto the nest, or the young may take food directly from the beak. The young fledge at about six weeks and become independent at two months. They then disperse widely.|$|E
50|$|Wading birds, even {{large and}} {{relatively}} slow-moving types {{such as the}} <b>goliath</b> <b>heron</b> (Ardea goliath), tend to be highly cautious about avoiding deep water in crocodile occupied wetlands whereas cormorants and waterfowl forage over deeper water and are easier for crocodiles to ambush, with Egyptian geese (Alopochen aegyptiaca) and spur-winged geese (Plectropterus gambensis) recorded as being taken largely while flightless due to molting their flight feathers. On the contrary, there are several records of them capturing wading birds. Guggisberg (1972) saw multiple cases of predation on marabou storks (Leptoptilos crumenifer) and around Lake Turkana several may frequent heronries to pick off fledglings. In one case, a crocodile was filmed capturing a striated heron (Butorides striata) in mid-flight. Osprey (Pandion haliaetus) {{are known to be}} grabbed while they dive for fish as are possibly African fish eagles (Haliaeetus vocifer) while crowned eagles (Stephanoaetus coronatus) have reportedly been ambushed on land at carrion. Crocodiles are occasionally successful in grabbing passerines such as weaver birds, including the abundant red-billed quelea (Quelea quelea), and swallows, having been observed to breach the water and {{in a matter of seconds}} sweep off a branch full of birds with remarkable success. Larger land birds, such as bustards, guineafowl, ground hornbills (Bucorvus sp.) and ostriches (Struthio camelus), may be taken when they come to water to drink but like most birds are seldom harassed and a minor part of the diet.|$|E
5000|$|The {{shoebill}} {{is noted}} for its slow movements and tendency to remain still for long periods, resulting in repeated descriptions of the species as [...] "statue-like". They are quite sensitive to human disturbance and may abandon their nests if flushed by humans. However, while foraging, if dense vegetation stands between it and humans, this wader can be fairly tame. The shoebill is attracted to poorly oxygenated waters where fish frequently surface to breathe. Exceptionally for a bird this large, the shoebill often stands and perches on floating vegetation, making them appear somewhat like a giant jacana, although the similarly-sized and occasionally sympatric <b>Goliath</b> <b>heron</b> (Ardea goliath) is also known to stand on aquatic vegetation. Shoebills typically feed in muddy waters and, being solitary birds, forage at a minimum distance of 20 m from one another even where relatively densely populated. This species stalks its prey patiently, in a slow and lurking fashion. While hunting, the shoebill strides very slowly and is frequently motionless. Unlike some other large waders, this species hunts entirely using vision and is not known to engage in tactile hunting. When prey is spotted, it launches a quick, violent strike. However, {{depending on the size}} of the prey, handling time after the strike can exceed 10 minutes. Around 60% of strikes are successful in yielding prey. Frequently water and vegetation is snatched up during the strike and is spilled out from the edges of the mandibles. The activity of hippopotamus may inadvertently benefit the shoebill, as the hippos occasionally force fish to the surface of the water while they are submerged.|$|E
40|$|Two major {{goals of}} {{managers}} of Rubondo Island National Park (Rubondo), Tanzania are {{to increase the}} number of international visitors to the Park (and thereby increase revenue generated) and to increase support for the Park among residents of nearby communities. I investigated species preferences among children living around Rubondo and the wildlife viewing preferences of international visitors to Tanzania in an attempt to identify flagship species that Park management could use in marketing and outreach campaigns designed to meet their goals. I also assessed local interest in visiting the Park. As local flagships for Rubondo, the Egyptian goose (Alopochen aegyptiacus) and silver cyprinid (Rastrineobola argentea) appear to have the most potential among the species that I assessed (i. e., fish eagle [Haliaeetus vocifer], Egyptian goose, silver cyprinid, little egret [Egretta garzetta], sitatunga [Tragelaphus speki], genet [Genetta tigrina], monitor lizard [Varanus niloticus], spotted-necked otter [Lutra maculicollis], vervet monkey [Cercopithecus pygerythrus], crocodile [Crocodylus niloticus], hippopotamus [Hippopotamus amphibius], giraffe [Giraffa camelopardalis], and elephant [Loxodanta africana]). However, based on either range or limited aesthetic/behavioral appeal, I considered neither species useful as an international flagship. Among species on Rubondo included in investigations of potential international flagships for the Island (including the chimpanzee [Pan troglodytes], crocodile, elephant, giraffe, hippopotamus, vervet monkey, bushbuck, fish eagle, large-spotted genet, <b>goliath</b> <b>heron</b> [Ardea goliath], monitor lizard, sitatunga, and spotted-necked otter), few were concluded to have potential, either because participating visitors had limited 2 ̆ 2 awareness 2 ̆ 2 of and 2 ̆ 2 interest 2 ̆ 2 in viewing the species, local people had strong negative opinions of the species, the animals are not native to the Island, and/or the animals are more easily viewed in more readily-accessible locations. Local people generally had not visited Rubondo but wanted to visit. Not having visited the Park appeared to influence perceptions of the Park, wildlife tourism, and conservation among some participants. Recommendations for local and international marketing and outreach strategies for Rubondo are made based on the outcomes of the aforementioned investigations of local and international species preferences and interest in visiting the Park. ...|$|E
