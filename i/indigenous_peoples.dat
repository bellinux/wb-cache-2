40|$|Throughout {{the nineteenth}} and twentieth centuries, Australian governments and their agencies, such as Aboriginal Protection Boards, {{generally}} controlled the wages, savings and benefits of <b>Indigenous</b> <b>people.</b> <b>Indigenous</b> <b>people</b> largely received no wages or were systemically underpaid for their employment. Any monies paid to <b>Indigenous</b> <b>people</b> were often paid into trust accounts.

40|$|This thesis explores whether {{environmental}} justice can attenuate the burdens {{attributed to the}} operation of the E. B. Campbell Dam experienced by downstream Indigenous communities in the Saskatchewan River Delta. Environmental justice for <b>Indigenous</b> <b>people</b> who are affected by dam management is important for three reasons. First, <b>Indigenous</b> <b>people</b> often experience environmental burdens of dam management disproportionately. Second, <b>Indigenous</b> <b>people</b> are often excluded from dam decision-making. Third, when <b>Indigenous</b> <b>people</b> are included in dam decision-making, their rights and values are sometimes misrecognized within decision-making processes. While exploring {{environmental justice}} for <b>Indigenous</b> <b>people</b> in the context of dam management, this thesis contributes to a recommendation that empirical studies of environmental justice should describe the underlying causes of environmental injustice. This thesis contributes to this recommendation by documenting how power relations challenge environmental justice for <b>Indigenous</b> <b>people</b> in dam decision-making. A place-based, interdisciplinary methodology was taken to clarify an environmental justice pathway for downstream Indigenous communities in the Saskatchewan River Delta. This methodology involved analyses of hydrometric data, interview data and legal and policy documents. The findings of this thesis include that <b>Indigenous</b> <b>people,</b> through their meaningful participation in dam decision-making, could help government representatives recognize the environmental burdens of dam management. However, imbalances in power between <b>Indigenous</b> <b>people</b> and government representatives could constrain <b>Indigenous</b> <b>people’s</b> meaningful participation. The implication of these findings is that if power relations are accounted for in decision-making, the meaningful participation of <b>Indigenous</b> <b>people</b> can facilitate the recognition and remediation of environmental burdens attributed to dam management...|$|R

40|$|My thesis {{examines}} whether {{dialogue is}} useful for negotiating Indigenous rights and solving intercultural conflict over Indigenous claims for recognition within Australia. As a social and political practice, dialogue has been put forward as a method for identifying and solving difficult problems and for promoting processes of understanding and accommodation. Dialogue in a genuine form has never been attempted with <b>Indigenous</b> <b>people</b> in Australia. Australian constitutionalism is unable to resolve Indigenous claims for recognition {{because there is no}} practice of dialogue in Indigenous policy. A key barrier in that regard is the underlying colonial assumptions about <b>Indigenous</b> <b>people</b> and their cultures which have accumulated in various ways over the course of history. I examine where these assumptions about <b>Indigenous</b> <b>people</b> originate and demonstrate how they have become barriers to dialogue between <b>Indigenous</b> <b>people</b> and governments. I investigate historical and contemporary episodes where <b>Indigenous</b> <b>people</b> have challenged those assumptions through their claims for recognition. <b>Indigenous</b> <b>people</b> have attempted to engage in dialogue with governments over their claims for recognition but these attempts have largely been rejected on the basis of those assumptions. There is potential for dialogue in Australia however genuine dialogue between <b>Indigenous</b> <b>people</b> and the Australian state is impossible under a colonial relationship. A genuine dialogue must first repudiate colonial and contemporary assumptions and attitudes about <b>Indigenous</b> <b>people.</b> It must also deconstruct the existing colonial relationship between <b>Indigenous</b> <b>people</b> and government...|$|R
