5|$|The {{decision}} on whether to surgically decompress the pituitary gland is complex and mainly dependent on the severity of visual loss and visual field defects. If visual acuity is severely reduced, there are large or worsening visual field defects, or the level of consciousness falls consistently, professional guidelines recommend that surgery is performed. Most commonly, operations on the pituitary gland are performed through transsphenoidal surgery. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>procedure,</b> surgical instruments are passed through the nose towards the sphenoid bone, which is opened to give access to the cavity that contains the pituitary gland. Surgery is most likely to improve vision if there was some remaining vision before surgery, and if surgery is undertaken within a week of the onset of symptoms.|$|E

25|$|Early Medieval courts {{generally}} {{followed a}} process called accusatio, largely based on Germanic practices. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>procedure,</b> an individual would make an accusation against someone to the court. However, if the suspect was judged innocent, the accusers faced legal penalties for bringing false charges. This provided a disincentive to make any accusation unless the accusers were sure it would stand.

25|$|When appropriate, {{a nearby}} donor {{may be used}} to supply {{innervation}} to lesioned nerves. Trauma to the donor can be minimized by utilizing a technique known as end-to-side repair. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>procedure,</b> an epineurial window is created in the donor nerve and the proximal stump of the lesioned nerve is sutured over the window. Regenerating axons are redirected into the stump. Efficacy of this technique is partially dependent upon the degree of partial neurectomy performed on the donor, with increasing degrees of neurectomy giving rise to increasing axon regeneration within the lesioned nerve, but with the consequence of increasing deficit to the donor.|$|E

25|$|Differential {{reinforcement}} of low response rate (DRL) described by Ferster and Skinner {{is used to}} encourage low rates of responding. It is derived from research in operant conditioning that provides an excellent opportunity to measure the hyperactive child's ability to inhibit behavioral responding. Hyperactive children were relatively unable to perform efficiently on the task, and this deficit endured regardless of age, IQ, or experimental condition. Therefore, {{it can be used}} to discriminate accurately between teacher rated and parent rated hyperactive and nonhyperactive children. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>procedure,</b> responses that occur before a set time interval has passed are not reinforced and reset the time required between behaviors.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} {{surgical treatment}} for severe GERD is the Nissen fundoplication. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>procedure,</b> {{the upper part}} of the stomach is wrapped around the lower esophageal sphincter to strengthen the sphincter and prevent acid reflux and to repair a hiatal hernia. It is recommended only for those who do not improve with PPIs. Quality of life is improved in the short term compared to medical therapy, but there is uncertainty in the benefits over surgery versus long-term medical management with proton pump inhibitors. When comparing different fundoplication techniques, partial posterior fundoplication surgery is more effective than partial anterior fundoplication surgery, and partial fundoplication has better outcomes than total fundoplication.|$|E

25|$|Lateral {{internal}} sphincterotomy (LIS) is {{the surgical}} procedure {{of choice for}} anal fissures due to its simplicity and its high success rate (~95%). <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>procedure</b> the internal anal sphincter is partially divided {{in order to reduce}} spasming and thus improve the blood supply to the perianal area. This improvement in the blood supply helps to heal the fissure, and the weakening of the sphincter is also believed to reduce the potential for recurrence. The procedure is generally performed as a day surgery after the patient is given general anesthesia. The pain from the sphincterotomy is usually mild and is often less than the pain of the fissure itself. Patients often return to normal activity within one week.|$|E
25|$|Laser vitreolysis is a {{possible}} treatment option {{for the removal of}} vitreous strands and opacities (floaters). <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>procedure</b> an ophthalmic laser (usually a yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG) laser) applies a series of nanosecond pulses of low-energy laser light to evaporate the vitreous opacities and to sever the vitreous strands. During this process, the laser energy evaporates the collagen and hyaluronin molecules to form a gas. (It {{is important to note that}} the laser energy applied during vitreolysis treatment does not simply break the floater into smaller pieces. Instead, the laser energy converts the floater material to a gas, which is then absorbed into the eye.) The end result is that the floater is removed and/or reduced to a size that no longer impedes vision.|$|E
25|$|Articulated {{thoughts}} in stimulated situations (ATSS): ATSS is a paradigm {{which was created}} {{as an alternative to}} the TA (think aloud) method. This method assumes that people have continuous internal dialogues that can be naturally attended to. ATSS also assesses a person’s inner thoughts as they verbalize their cognitions. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>procedure,</b> subjects listen to a scenario via a video or audio player and are asked to imagine that they are in that specific situation. Later, they are asked to articulate their thoughts as they occur in reaction to the playing scenario. This method is useful in studying emotional experience given that the scenarios used can influence specific emotions. Most importantly, the method has contributed to the study of personality. In a study conducted by Rayburn and Davison (2002), subjects’ thoughts and empathy toward anti-gay hate crimes were evaluated. The researchers found that participants showed more aggressive intentions towards the offender in scenarios which mimicked hate crimes.|$|E

25|$|In {{backcross}} conversion, {{genes are}} introgressed from a donor cultivar or related species into a recipient elite line through repeated backcrossing. A problem <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>procedure</b> {{is being able}} to identify the lines carrying the trait of interest at each generation. The problem is particularly acute if the trait of interest is recessive, as it will be present only in a heterozygous condition after each backcross. The development of molecular markers provides an easier method of selection based on the genotype (marker) rather than the phenotype. Combined with doubled haploidy it becomes more effective. In marker assisted backcross conversion, a recipient parent is crossed with a donor line and the hybrid (F1) backcrossed to the recipient. The resulting generation (BC1) is backcrossed and the process repeated until the desired genotypes are produced. The combination of doubled haploidy and molecular marker provides the short cut. In the back cross generation one itself a genotype with the character of interest can be selected and converted into homozygous doubled haploid genotype. Chen et al. (1994) used marker assisted backcross conversion with doubled haploidy of BC1 individuals to select stripe rust resistant lines in barley.|$|E
25|$|If a cone biopsy {{does not}} produce clear margins (findings on biopsy showing that the tumor is {{surrounded}} by cancer free tissue, suggesting all of the tumor is removed), one more possible treatment option for {{women who want to}} preserve their fertility is a trachelectomy. This attempts to surgically remove the cancer while preserving the ovaries and uterus, providing for a more conservative operation than a hysterectomy. It is a viable option for those in stage I cervical cancer which has not spread; however, it is not yet considered a standard of care, as few doctors are skilled <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>procedure.</b> Even the most experienced surgeon cannot promise that a trachelectomy can be performed until after surgical microscopic examination, as the extent of the spread of cancer is unknown. If the surgeon is not able to microscopically confirm clear margins of cervical tissue once the woman is under general anesthesia in the operating room, a hysterectomy may still be needed. This can only be done during the same operation if the woman has given prior consent. Due to the possible risk of cancer spread to the lymph nodes in stage 1b cancers and some stage 1a cancers, the surgeon may also need to remove some lymph nodes from around the uterus for pathologic evaluation.|$|E
25|$|Historically, LDLT {{began with}} {{terminal}} pediatric patients, {{whose parents were}} motivated to risk donating {{a portion of their}} compatible healthy livers to replace their children's failing ones. The first report of successful LDLT was by Dr. Christoph Broelsch at the University of Chicago Medical Center in November 1989, when two-year-old Alyssa Smith received a portion of her mother's liver. Surgeons eventually realized that adult-to-adult LDLT was also possible, and now the practice is common in a few reputable medical institutes. It is considered more technically demanding than even standard, cadaveric donor liver transplantation, and also poses the ethical problems underlying the indication of a major surgical operation (hemihepatectomy or related procedure) on a healthy human being. In various case series, the risk of complications in the donor is around 10%, and very occasionally a second operation is needed. Common problems are biliary fistula, gastric stasis and infections; they are more common after removal of the right lobe of the liver. Death after LDLT has been reported at 0% (Japan), 0.3% (USA) and <1% (Europe), with risks likely to decrease further as surgeons gain more experience <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>procedure.</b> Since the law was changed to permit altruistic non-directed living organ donations in the UK in 2006, the first altruistic living liver donation took place in Britain in December 2012.|$|E
