5|$|Before {{the tournament}} in Poland and Ukraine, Balotelli {{was interviewed by}} a {{newspaper}} about racism amongst fans in the host countries. During the interview, Balotelli reiterated his threat to walk off the pitch {{if any of the}} opposition fans racially abused him in any way, and said that he would 'kill' anyone that threw a banana at him. He spoke about his increasing fears that black players would be targeted by racists and that he refused to accept racism in any form, talking of his past experience of racism in football notably during his time playing in Serie A for Inter Milan. During the build-up to the competition Manchester City's manager Roberto Mancini had repeatedly defended Balotelli, but he and footballer Daniele De Rossi believed that Mario would need to <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> mature {{if he was going to}} become the centrepiece of future Italian success.|$|E
5|$|Jonathan and Dio <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> become friendlier, but Jonathan {{suspects}} {{ulterior motives}} when Dio acts very caring for George, {{who has been}} sick for an extended time. Learning that Dario had the same symptoms before he died, Jonathan suspects that Dio poisoned both of them; Dio plans to stop Jonathan from exposing this by killing him with the stone mask. When he tests the mask on a beggar beforehand, it instead turns the beggar into a vampire, who dies due to exposure to sunlight. While investigating the poison, Jonathan befriends the street thug Robert E. O. Speedwagon and learns that Dio acquired it from Wang Chan, a black market merchant. Jonathan confronts Dio, who uses George's blood and the mask to become a vampire. The Joestar estate burns to the ground during the ensuing battle, but Jonathan and Dio survive.|$|E

Zimmerman has cited his mother's condition as a substantial formative influence on his development, saying that it forced him to <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> assume responsibilities {{at an earlier age}} than most children. He also founded the ziMS Foundation, which is dedicated to treating and curing multiple sclerosis.|$|E

Inspired by their experiences of multicultural cooperation in international educational institutions, the founders decided that a fast-paced, intensive program in technology would be an ideal medium to bridge the divide.

25|$|Greenville, Mississippi had {{the most}} Sicilian {{immigrants}} out of other cities in the delta. Most immigrants first settled in New Orleans {{and worked in the}} sugar cane and cotton fields. Later on when they arrived in the Delta, they began to settle in towns, which enabled them to open up grocery stores, restaurants, and fruit stands. Because they lived in towns, rather than on farms, they had access to higher quality education, which they took advantage of. Because of these opportunities, young Sicilian immigrants were able to <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> established and enter into the workforce much faster than Central Italian immigrants. Sicilians established strong ties with their homeland after coming to America.|$|E

25|$|Adoption {{was very}} common, {{especially}} when the father (or mother) was childless or had seen all his children <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> marry away. The child was then adopted {{to care for the}} parents' old age. This was done by contract, which usually specified what the parent had to leave and what maintenance was expected. The natural children, if any, were usually consenting parties to an arrangement that cut off their expectations. In some cases they even acquired the estate for the adopted child who was to relieve them of care. If the adopted child failed to carry out the filial duty, the contract was annulled in the law courts. Slaves were often adopted, and if they proved unfilial, were reduced to slavery again.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, after {{starring}} {{in a play}} in New York, Blethyn was recommended to Robert Redford to audition for the soft-spoken mother role in his next project A River Runs Through It (1992). A period drama based on the same-titled 1976 novel by Norman Maclean, also starring Craig Sheffer and Brad Pitt, the film revolves around two sons of a Presbyterian minister—one studious and the other rebellious—as they <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> come of age during the Prohibition era in the United States. Portraying a second generation immigrant of Scottish heritage, Redford required Blethyn to adapt a Western American accent for her performance, prompting her to live in Livingston, Montana in preparation of her role. Upon its release, the film, budgeted at US$19 million, became a financial and critical success, resulting in a US box office total of US$43.3 million.|$|E

500|$|After Beebo Brinker, Bannon {{said the}} energy {{to write about the}} {{characters}} left her, but she got so good at her [...] "obsessive fantasies" [...] that even after the books were written she continued to live internally, and suspected it affected her subsequent relationships. [...] "I realize now that I was in a sort of 'holding pattern,' a way of keeping my sanity intact while waiting for my children to <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> the freedom door to open", she recalled. Returning to school, Bannon completed her master's degree at Sacramento State University and her doctorate in linguistics at Stanford University. She was an English professor at Sacramento State and later became associate dean of the School of Arts and Sciences—later the College of Arts and Letters.|$|E
500|$|In November 2007, the {{character}} {{was diagnosed with}} Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Although he had {{been shown to be}} feeling sickly in the show for some time, he was wary of being tested. Even when forced into it by friend and colleague Maddy Young, he initially refused to so much as look at his results. Chambers explained: [...] "It's serious, but Sam's playing it down. Of course he's scared but he deals with it by just wanting to laugh it off and make jokes about it". He speculated that the experience would force Sam to <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> appreciate life more, as well as seriously consider the future of his daughter, Grace, and cease his philandering way with female staff. Chambers has also spoken extensively about the research he did before beginning the cancer storyline: ...|$|E

During a speech at a May 29, 2017 gathering of Philip D. Murphy supporters at a community center gymnasium, [...] "There {{are a lot of people}} out there who are frightened.

500|$|The poem {{consists}} of an address by the speaker to an unnamed listener, and contains two parallel sections, about two of Sappho's brothers, Charaxos and Larichos. Sappho hopes that Charaxos will return successfully from his trading voyage, and that Larichos will <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> become a man. [...] In the first surviving stanza of the poem, the speaker upbraids the addressee for repeating that Charaxos will return home safely, saying that only the gods can know such a thing. [...] In the next stanza, the speaker tells the addressee to send her to pray to Hera for Charaxos' safe return. [...] This is followed by an exhortation to trust in the gods for everything else, and two traditional pieces of wisdom – that fortunes are changeable, and that the gods can bless those they favour with good fortune. [...] The poem ends with the speaker hoping that Larichos will [...] " [...] his head high" [...] and [...] "become an ανερ [...] in all senses", as Obbink puts it.|$|E
500|$|Jason Cowley, {{reviewing}} {{the book in}} The Guardian, felt that Outliers was an argument between Gladwell and himself, referring to the many times that he uses the word [...] "we" [...] when defining his position, {{such as in the}} example: [...] "There is something profoundly wrong with the way we look at success. [...] We cling to the idea that success is a simple function of individual merit and that {{the world in which we}} <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> the rules we choose to write as a society don't matter at all." [...] He also believed that there was a [...] "certain one-dimensional Americanness at work", observing that many of Gladwell's examples are from the United States, particularly in New York City. In an article about the book for The New York Times, Steven Pinker wrote, [...] "The reasoning in 'Outliers,' which consists of cherry-picked anecdotes, post-hoc sophistry and false dichotomies, had me gnawing on my Kindle." [...] In a review in The New Republic, Isaac Chotiner called the final chapter of Outliers [...] "impervious to all forms of critical thinking".|$|E
