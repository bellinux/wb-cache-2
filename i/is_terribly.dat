25|$|The {{law clerk}} Mr. Guppy, enamoured of Esther, hopes {{to win her}} affection by helping her {{discover}} the identity of her parents. He finds connections to both Lady Dedlock and the deceased Nemo, who {{has been identified as}} Captain James Hawdon, and is eventually alerted to the existence of letters left behind by Hawdon but kept by his drunken landlord, Krook. Realizing that Esther is her daughter whom she was told had died — fathered by Hawdon before her current marriage — Lady Dedlock confesses to Esther but swears her to secrecy. Esther is stricken by smallpox and nearly dies; she recovers but <b>is</b> <b>terribly</b> scarred. John proposes marriage to Esther, but though she accepts, he convinces her to keep it secret until she is sure it is what she wants. While amassing other enemies, Tulkinghorn deduces Lady Dedlock's secret and tries to use it to keep her in line.|$|E

500|$|Habib Faisal's dowry-based social comedy film Daawat-e-Ishq marked Chopra's second {{collaboration}} with Faisal. She was cast as Gulrez [...] "Gullu" [...] Qadir, a middle-class salesgirl from Hyderabad alongside Aditya Roy Kapoor and Anupam Kher. The film received mixed reviews though Chopra was praised. Film critic Sarita A Tanwar from Daily News Analysis found Chopra to be [...] "the {{best thing about}} the film" [...] and added, [...] "She shines in every scene. She does what she does every single time — rises {{head and shoulders above}} the film and her costars." [...] Chopra next played her first [...] "glamorous role" [...] in Shaad Ali's crime film Kill Dil, co-starring Govinda, Ranveer Singh and Ali Zafar. Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com found the film to be a [...] "disaster" [...] and wrote that [...] "Chopra <b>is</b> <b>terribly</b> miscast and wears clothes that should have never left the wardrobe". Both Daawat-e-Ishq and Kill Dil were unsuccessful at the box office.|$|E

500|$|The {{existence}} of the band itself caused a debate in the metal underground. For example, during the early 1990s, Bård Faust of Emperor brought up the subject when he discussed with Euronymous, guitarist/vocalist from the seminal black metal band Mayhem, in his zine Orcustus about the Norwegian scene. Faust asked: [...] "Don't you think that something <b>is</b> <b>terribly</b> wrong when it {{has gone so far}} that we have a Christian [...] "death metal" [...] band here (Crush Evil)? Any advice on how we should kill them?" [...] Euronymous replied to this: [...] "It's bad enough to have a couple of society bands, but a Christian band is too much. But don't worry, we have plans. They will not continue for a very long time." [...] However, the band persevered despite these threats. Antestor was never forced to split apart, and in an almost ironic twist of fate, Jan Axel Blomberg (better known as Hellhammer, the drummer for Mayhem) was Antestor's session drummer on their latest two releases.|$|E

2500|$|Rabbi Alexander Schindler, former {{chair of}} the Conference of Presidents, told an Israeli {{magazine}} in 1976, “The Presidents’ Conference and its members have been instruments of official governmental Israeli policy. It was seen as our task to receive directions from government circles and to do our best no matter what to affect the Jewish community.” Hymen Bookbinder, a high-ranking official of the American Jewish Committee, said “Unless something <b>is</b> <b>terribly</b> pressing, really critical or fundamental, you parrot Israel’s line in order to retain American support. As American Jews, we don’t go around saying Israel is wrong about its policies.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Keynes {{described}} the article as [...] "one {{of the most}} remarkable contributions to mathematical economics ever made, both in respect of the intrinsic importance and difficulty of its subject, the power and elegance of the technical methods employed, and the clear purity of illumination with which the writer's mind is felt by the reader to play about its subject. The article <b>is</b> <b>terribly</b> difficult reading for an economist, but {{it is not difficult to}} appreciate how scientific and aesthetic qualities are combined in it together" [...] (Keynes 1933). The Ramsey model is today acknowledged as the starting point for optimal accumulation theory although its importance was not recognised until many years after its first publication.|$|E

2500|$|By 17 May, Rommel {{claimed to}} have taken 10,000 prisoners and {{suffered}} only 36 losses. Guderian was delighted with the fast advance, and encouraged XIX Korps {{to head for the}} channel, continuing until fuel was exhausted. Hitler worried that the German advance was moving too fast. Halder recorded in his diary on 17 May that [...] "Führer <b>is</b> <b>terribly</b> nervous. Frightened by his own success, he is afraid to take any chance and so would pull the reins on us... keeps worrying about the south flank. He rages and screams that we are on the way to ruin the whole campaign." [...] Through deception and different interpretations of orders to stop from Hitler and Kleist, the front line commanders ignored Hitler's attempts to stop the westward advance to Abbeville.|$|E
2500|$|Among the {{influences}} on Monty Python, {{the members of}} the comedy team are described as being [...] "indebted to BBC radio comedy, and particularly to the Goon Show." [...] The future members of Monty Python were fans, and on many occasions they expressed their collective debt to Milligan and The Goons. Scudamore (1985, p.170) cites an interview for example, in which John Cleese stated [...] "the Goon Show influenced us enormously". He reiterates this point in his contribution to Ventham's (2002, p.151) book: [...] "We all loved The Goon Show in the Monty Python Team: it ignited some energy in us. It was more a spirit that was passed on, rather than any particular technique. The point is that once somebody has crossed a barrier and done something that has never been done before, it <b>is</b> <b>terribly</b> easy for everybody else to cross it".|$|E
2500|$|During {{the summers}} of 1880, 1881, and 1882, he {{accompanied}} Nadezhda von Meck, the wealthy patroness of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, as she travelled {{with her family}} in Europe. The young composer's many musical activities during these vacations included playing four-hand pieces with von Meck at the piano, giving music lessons to her children, and performing in private concerts with some of her musician friends. Despite von Meck's closeness to Tchaikovsky, the Russian master appears to have had minimal effect on Debussy. In September 1880 she sent his Danse bohémienne for Tchaikovsky's perusal; a month later Tchaikovsky wrote back to her: [...] "It is a very pretty piece, but it is much too short. Not a single idea is expressed fully, the form <b>is</b> <b>terribly</b> shriveled, and it lacks unity." [...] Debussy did not publish the piece, and the manuscript remained in the von Meck family; it was eventually sold to B. Schott's Sohne in Mainz, and published by them in 1932.|$|E

2500|$|Mark Gatiss {{said that}} Capaldi's Doctor was [...] "sort of Tom Baker, Jon Pertwee and even Christopher Eccleston style...it's someone who's not {{immediately}} {{going to be}} your best friend and can be quite abrupt and rude." [...] Moffat added to this analysis of the character by saying, [...] "He has a tremendous ability with throwaway humour {{and a lot of it}} is around the fact that sometimes he <b>is</b> <b>terribly</b> rude. I think kids will think he is the rude Doctor [...] You might want to cuddle him but he really will resist." [...] It has been said that part of the Doctor's personality will share [...] "a certain acid wit" [...] of Malcolm Tucker, the role Peter Capaldi is most famous for, [...] "specifically the attitude, the wisecracks and the energy...he can be edgy, volatile and dangerous". Capaldi has stated that all of the previous actors who had played the Doctor were channelled in his portrayal and that his particular influences were Hartnell, Pertwee and Davison.|$|E
2500|$|Dick's wealth {{allowed him}} to provide his own funding, and gave him an {{independence}} the other photographers lacked. [...] Stryker attempted to provide some guidance {{for the kind of}} photographs he was looking for, writing to Dick, [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>terribly</b> important that you in some way try to show the town against this background of waste piles and coal tipples. In other words, it is a coal town and your pictures must tell it." [...] Instead, many of Dick's photographs are interiors, bars, and images of ordinary life. [...] Critic Collen McDannel has pointed out that, particularly in regard to his treatment of religion, Dick's work is different from most of the FSA file. [...] Because of his composition of images of the poor surrounded by religious items and by ordinary household objects (objects not in themselves indicating poverty), Dick's photographs are less politically clear than those of the other FSA photographers. [...] His composition [...] "transgresses common assumptions about men and religion and therefore appears to be less 'documentary.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1921 George Mallory and Guy Bullock {{had reached}} an unnamed col between Pumori and Lingtren and Mallory {{reported}} on {{looking down on}} the Western Cwm [...] "However, we have seen this Western Glacier and are not sorry we have not to go up it. It <b>is</b> <b>terribly</b> steep and broken." [...] Shipton and Bryant reached the same point on 9 August 1935 but, despite waiting several hours, mist prevented any view of the Cwm. They again reached the col on 11 August and on this occasion the mist cleared after many hours {{and they were able to}} get the first photograph of the Khumbu Icefall leading up to the Western Cwm. Bryant wrote [...] "A westerly spur of Nuptse curled round to the north thus squeezing the glacier of the upper basin into a narrow lip over which it poured in a gigantic ice-fall, a wild tumble of contorted ice, to the Khumbu Glacier 2,000 feet below. The cwm itself must be an amazing place, completely ringed in as it is, except for that narrow entrance, by a mountain wall nowhere less than 25,000 feet high." [...] Shipton reported how the Sherpas became quite excited as they recognised landmarks in their homeland, the Solu Khumbu. He said of the route up the icefall and cwm [...] "it did not look impossible, and I should very much like to have the opportunity one day of exploring it".|$|E

2500|$|He {{explained}} his particular ethos {{and style of}} management of CSIRO in this way: Well, I suppose I always wanted to extrapolate from my own experience, small-scale experience, and some personal opinions. I had a strong desire always to see pure and applied research undertaken {{side by side in}} the same laboratory.... And I was still very much aware that the recognition that many – most, I should say – of the really important and fundamental discoveries in science which subsequently led to a massive technological development have come through curiosity-led research, and often through serendipity, which <b>is</b> <b>terribly</b> important. I think the Birch report was very helpful, and I agreed with his report that the whole core of the policy-making in the science that we were going to carry out was a matter of defining the right proportion of, shall we say, pure research, strategic mission-oriented, and technical research – and getting that proportion right.... I felt that fundamental research in the end was going to reap the real benefits in the long run ... discovering something like electricity ... was absolutely fundamental research and had an enormous impact on the world. On the other hand, there was the awareness that you're in charge of an organisation that's spending a million dollars of taxpayers' money every day, and that's a very sobering thought, so you had to keep the reins on as well. Indeed, there were many frustrations in being CSIRO's Chairman at that time, of which he nominated as the worst [...] "the frustration of finding it so difficult to bring in new young blood because of the descending budget in real terms." ...|$|E
2500|$|Snake Eyes {{appears in}} G.I. Joe vs. The Transformers, the Devil's Due {{crossover}} series with Transformers set in an alternate continuity. As G.I. Joe is organized, Snake Eyes {{is assigned to}} a group of soldiers protecting a peace conference in Washington. He is called [...] "Chatterbox" [...] but does not actually speak, because he had been dared by the other soldiers to actually keep quiet for a time. Snake Eyes <b>is</b> <b>terribly</b> scarred, and loses his voice, when a Cobra Commander-controlled Starscream shoots Cover Girl's missile tank out from under him. His family is also killed during the attack. During the assault on Cobra Island, Snake Eyes slices open one of Starscream's optics and shoves a grenade into the socket. During the final part of the first miniseries, Snake Eyes is given a Cybertronian-based Mech that allows him to fight the much larger Decepticons, as well as Cobra agents in Decepticon suits. The second miniseries focuses on several Transformers being sent back in time to various time periods, which forces G.I. Joe and Cobra to team-up to retrieve them. The first group to be sent back in time includes Snake Eyes, Lady Jaye, Zartan, and Storm Shadow, sent back to 1970s California. After recovering all of the Transformers, they arrive back on Cybertron. During the third miniseries, it is shown that Snake Eyes has developed a love interest with Scarlett, who returns those feelings after he rescues her from a Decepticon prison, and removes his mask to show his scarred face. Later, they appear to be in a relationship. During the fourth miniseries, Snake Eyes is only shown in one scene as still being {{an active member of the}} Joe team, along with Flint, Lady Jaye, and Duke. He also appears briefly fighting several of the Cobra-La Royal Guards.|$|E
2500|$|Wittgenstein's platonic {{relationship}} with David Pinsent (1891–1918) occurred during an intellectually formative period, and is well documented. Bertrand Russell introduced Wittgenstein to Pinsent {{in the summer}} of 1912. A mathematics undergraduate and descendant of David Hume, Pinsent soon became Wittgenstein's closest friend. The men worked together on experiments in the psychology laboratory about the role of rhythm in the appreciation of music, and Wittgenstein delivered a paper on the subject to the British Psychological Association in Cambridge in 1912. They also travelled together, including to Iceland in September 1912—the expenses paid by Wittgenstein, including first class travel, the hiring of a private train, and new clothes and spending money for Pinsent. In addition to Iceland, Wittgenstein and Pinsent traveled to Norway in 1913. Upon determining their destination, Wittgenstein and Pinsent visited a tourist office in search for a location that would fulfill the following criteria – small village located on a Fjord, a location away from tourists, and a peaceful destination to allow them to study logic and law. Suggesting Øystese, Wittgenstein and Pinsent arrived in the small village on 4 September 1913. With their vacation lasting almost three weeks, Wittgenstein was able to work vigorously on his studies. The immense progress on logic during their stay led Wittgenstein to express to Pinsent his idea to leave Cambridge and return to Norway to continue his work on logic. Pinsent's diaries provide valuable insights into Wittgenstein's personality – sensitive, nervous and attuned to the tiniest slight or change in mood from Pinsent. [...] Pinsent also writes of Wittgenstein being [...] "absolutely sulky and snappish" [...] at times, as well. In his diaries Pinsent wrote about shopping for furniture with Wittgenstein in Cambridge when the latter was given rooms in Trinity; most of what they found in the stores was not minimalist enough for Wittgenstein's aesthetics: [...] "I went and helped him interview a lot of furniture at various shops ... It was rather amusing: he <b>is</b> <b>terribly</b> fastidious and we led the shopman a frightful dance, Vittgenstein [...] ejaculating [...] "No—Beastly!" [...] to 90 percent of what he shewed [...] us!" ...|$|E
