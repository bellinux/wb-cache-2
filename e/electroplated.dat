5|$|Rhodium finds use in {{jewelry and}} for decorations. It is <b>electroplated</b> on white gold and {{platinum}} {{to give it}} a reflective white surface at time of sale, after which the thin layer wears away with use. This is known as rhodium flashing in the jewelry business. It may also be used in coating sterling silver to protect against tarnish (silver sulfide, Ag2S, produced from atmospheric hydrogen sulfide, H2S). Solid (pure) rhodium jewelry is very rare, more because of the difficulty of fabrication (high melting point and poor malleability) than because of the high price. The high cost ensures that rhodium is applied only as an electroplate.|$|E
5|$|Solutions {{of copper}} {{compounds}} {{are used as}} a wood preservative, particularly in treating the original portion of structures during restoration of dry rot damage. Together with zinc, copper wires may be installed over non-conductive roofing materials to discourage the growth of moss. Textile fibers are blended with copper to create antimicrobial protective fabrics. Copper alloys are used in musical instruments, particularly: the body of brass instruments; circuitry for all those that are electronically amplified; the bodies of brass percussion such as gongs, bells, and kettle drums; tuning heads on guitars and other string instruments; string windings on harps, pianos, harpsichords, and string instruments; and the frame elements of pianos and harps. Copper is commonly used as a base on which other metals such as nickel are <b>electroplated.</b>|$|E
5|$|Difficulties {{with the}} {{diffusers}} and pumps paled into insignificance besides {{those with the}} porous barrier. In order to work, the gaseous diffusion process required a barrier with microscopic holes, but not subject to plugging. It had to be extremely porous, but strong enough to handle the high pressures. And, like everything else, it had to resist corrosion from uranium hexafluoride. The latter criterion suggested a nickel barrier. Foster C. Nix at the Bell Telephone Laboratories experimented with nickel powder, while Edward O. Norris at the C. O. Jelliff Manufacturing Corporation and Edward Adler at the City College of New York worked on a design with <b>electroplated</b> metallic nickel. Norris was an English interior decorator, who had developed a very fine metal mesh for use with a spray gun. Their design appeared too brittle and fragile for the proposed use, particularly on the higher stages of enrichment, but there was hope {{that this could be}} overcome.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The superhard {{abrasive}} {{tools are}} usually {{made by the}} <b>electroplating</b> abrasive method. The <b>electroplating</b> quality has the directly effect on the life {{and the performance of}} the superhard abrasive tools. The <b>electroplating</b> technology is the major factor which influences the <b>electroplating</b> qualityy. The plating pretreatment and plating nickel processes in the basic <b>electroplating</b> technology were improved in this paper. The deburring, the oil removing by electrochemistry, the anode dispose procedures and a set of new <b>electroplating</b> technology about incoming slot with electronics and impact current in the plating nickel process were brought forward in this paper and the experiment research was taken as well. The result of the experiment which used the new technology showed that the binding power on the plating tier was enhanced, the <b>electroplating</b> quality was advanced; secondly, the effects of the parameters such as the directions for the <b>electroplating</b> solution, the current density, the temperature of the <b>electroplating</b> solution and PH values on the <b>electroplating</b> quality were studied in the experiment. Finally the optimization result was gained...|$|R
50|$|As {{the science}} of {{electrochemistry}} grew, {{its relationship to the}} <b>electroplating</b> process became understood and other types of non-decorative metal <b>electroplating</b> processes were developed. Commercial <b>electroplating</b> of nickel, brass, tin, and zinc were developed by the 1850s. <b>Electroplating</b> baths and equipment based on the patents of the Elkingtons were scaled up to accommodate the plating of numerous large scale objects and for specific manufacturing and engineering applications.|$|R

The <b>electroplating</b> was recorded in-situ for 10 minutes with a spatial resolution higher than 6 nm. At {{the beginning of}} the <b>electroplating,</b> gold spike-like structures of about 50 nanometers in size grew from an electrode, connected gold nanoclusters around them, and form three dimensional nanoscale structures. We visualized the elementary process of the gold <b>electroplating,</b> and believe that the results lead to the deeper understanding of <b>electroplating</b> at the nano scale...|$|R
5|$|Bismuth was {{purchased}} from the American Smelting and Refining Company {{of the highest}} purity that it could produce. It was sent to Hanford, where it was put in aluminum cans, and placed inside a reactor for 100 days. The canned slugs then shipped to Unit IV, where they were bathed in hydrochloric acid, which dissolved the aluminum. This formed an aluminum chloride solution that was disposed of, as it was highly radioactive due to iron and copper in the aluminum alloy. The bismuth slugs were then dissolved in aqua regia. This was too weak for electroplating the polonium, so the nitric acid was removed, and then the polonium deposited on bismuth by adding powdered bismuth. This resulted in a 100–1 concentration. This could then be repeated by dissolving in aqua regia again to achieve a 1000–1 concentration. This was again dissolved, and the polonium <b>electroplated</b> on platinum foils. The main problem with the process was that it required glass-lined containers due to the aqua regia, and mechanisms for safe handling of the radioactive material. The Dayton Project explored alternative purification methods that {{were found to be}} workable, but less efficient or safe.|$|E
5|$|In November 1942 the Military Policy Committee {{approved}} {{the construction of}} a 600-stage gaseous diffusion plant. On 14 December, M. W. Kellogg accepted an offer to construct the plant, which was codenamed K-25. A cost plus fixed fee contract was negotiated, eventually totaling $2.5million. A separate corporate entity called Kellex was created for the project, headed by Percival C. Keith, one of Kellogg's vice presidents. The process faced formidable technical difficulties. The highly corrosive gas uranium hexafluoride had to be used, as no substitute could be found, and the motors and pumps would have to be vacuum tight and enclosed in inert gas. The biggest problem was the design of the barrier, which would have to be strong, porous and resistant to corrosion by uranium hexafluoride. The best choice for this seemed to be nickel, and Edward Adler and Edward Norris created a mesh barrier from <b>electroplated</b> nickel. A six-stage pilot plant was built at Columbia to test the process, but the Norris-Adler prototype proved to be too brittle. A rival barrier was developed from powdered nickel by Kellex, the Bell Telephone Laboratories and the Bakelite Corporation. In January 1944, Groves ordered the Kellex barrier into production.|$|E
25|$|Thermal {{spraying}} {{techniques are}} another popular finishing option, and often have better high temperature properties than <b>electroplated</b> coatings {{due to the}} thicker coating.

40|$|Currently {{the fifteen}} Irish <b>electroplating</b> plant that {{have applied for}} an IPC licence produce 394. 6 tonnes/annum <b>electroplating</b> sludge and 33. 6 cubic metres of waste solution. This <b>electroplating</b> sludge is {{exported}} for recovery, exported for disposal or landfilled in Ireland. Prior to the 4 th of February 1998 the EPA had received sixteen Waste Licence applications for the operation of a landfill. Of these nine have applied to accept non hazardous industrial sludge but only four are containment sites, which are suitable for the acceptance of metal bearing <b>electroplating</b> sludge. Should <b>electroplating</b> sludge be categorised as hazardous this will pose special problems for the Irish <b>electroplating</b> industry if the European Commission Directive on Landfill is accepted, as Ireland presently has no hazardous waste landfill. The continuance of landfill as a disposal option for <b>electroplating</b> sludge in the short and intermediate term can be assured by recategorising <b>electroplating</b> sludge as non-hazardous using EWC/HWC codes {{and the use of}} solidification and stabilisation to produce a non-hazardous product suitable for landfill. The long-term continuance of landfill as a disposal option for <b>electroplating</b> sludge requires the urgent provision of an Irish hazardous waste landfill facility...|$|R

40|$|Barrel <b>electroplating</b> is an {{extremely}} useful method to coat {{a large number of}} components. Despite its successful use for many years it does have drawbacks, often stemming from poor electrolyte movement within the barrel. This can result in issues associated with mass transport, i. e. low limiting current, slow <b>electroplating</b> rates and, in the case of alloy <b>electroplating,</b> inconsistent alloy composition. Field trials carried out at an industrial facility, using ultrasonic agitation during the barrel <b>electroplating</b> of a Sn–Pb alloy, are reported. It was found that if <b>electroplating</b> was performed in a low frequency ultrasonic field then the limiting current could be increased, resulting in higher <b>electroplating</b> rates; the incidence of ‘burning’ was also reduced. In addition, the proportion of components having an alloy coating composition within the customer specification was higher, lowering the defect rate and increasing production capacity...|$|R
25|$|A more {{economical}} alternative was {{made available to}} the handloader in the 1980s, the copper-plated bullet. Copper-plated bullets are lead bullets that are <b>electroplated</b> with a copper jacket. While thinner than a swaged bullet jacket, the plated jacket is far thicker than normal electroplate, and provides significant structural integrity to the bullet. Since the jacket provides the strength, soft lead can be used, which allows bullets to be swaged or cast into shape before plating. While not strong enough for most rifle cartridges, plated bullets work well in many handgun rounds, with a recommended maximum velocity of 1250ft/s (375m/s). Plated bullets fall between cast and traditional jacketed bullets in price.|$|E
25|$|Pure tin is an {{expensive}} and soft metal {{and it is not}} practical to use it alone. However, it could be alloyed with lead and copper to make pewter or alloyed with copper alone to produce bronze. Today's tinplate is mild steel <b>electroplated</b> with tin. Its non-rusting qualities make it an invaluable coating. However, its quality depends on the iron or steel being free from rust and the surface tin an unbroken coating. A piece of tinware may develop rust if the tin coating has worn away or been cut in the metal. The respective properties of the metals mean that corrosion once started is likely to be rapid.|$|E
25|$|A magnetically {{shielded}} room (MSR) model {{consists of three}} nested main layers. Each of these layers is made of a pure aluminium layer, plus a high-permeability ferromagnetic layer, similar in composition to molybdenum permalloy. The ferromagnetic layer is supplied as 1mm sheets, while the innermost layer is composed of four sheets in close contact, and the outer two layers are composed of three sheets each. Magnetic continuity is maintained by overlay strips. Insulating washers {{are used in the}} screw assemblies to ensure that each main layer is electrically isolated. This helps eliminate radio frequency radiation, which would degrade SQUID performance. Electrical continuity of the aluminium is also maintained by aluminium overlay strips to ensure AC eddy current shielding, which is important at frequencies greater than 1Hz. The junctions of the inner layer are often <b>electroplated</b> with silver or gold to improve conductivity of the aluminium layers.|$|E
25|$|Another {{advantage}} is that mechanical plating evenly coats all surfaces and features, unlike <b>electroplating</b> which has issues plating recesses. Mechanical plating can evenly coat up to 75 μm thick. For thicker plating mechanical plating is especially cost advantageous versus <b>electroplating,</b> because the cycle time does not increase much for the thicker plating, unlike <b>electroplating.</b>|$|R
50|$|The most significant, {{industrial}} use of Cd(BF4)2 {{is in the}} <b>electroplating</b> of high-strength steels. Here, species such as cadmium tetrafluoroborate (or Cd-Ti or CdCN) are deposited {{on the surface of}} steels in an <b>electroplating</b> process which inhibits absorption of hydrogen onto the surface of the steels, a source of cracking following baking of the metal. Optimization of the <b>electroplating</b> process, adjusting electrolyte concentrations in Cadmium tetrafluoroborate mixes, has been explored in the literature. Among other methods of <b>electroplating,</b> cadmium tetrafluoroborate baths have middling efficiency. It has, for instance, been demonstrated that traditional cyanide bathes (e.g. CdCN or ZnCN) and variants there-of provide more efficient distribution of current density during <b>electroplating,</b> resulting in steels which could bear greater loads.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn recent years, {{with the}} rapid {{development}} of the <b>electroplating</b> industry, <b>electroplating</b> sludge has reached much attention. <b>Electroplating</b> sludge contains heavy metals such as nickel, copper, cadmium and chromium. To avoid releasing metal into the environment, removal of heavy metals from the <b>electroplating</b> industry is highly desired. In this study, effects of leaching metal from <b>electroplating</b> sludge under phosphate participation in hydrochloric acid medium were measured. The effects {{of the amount of}} hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid concentration, temperature, and liquid to solid ratio along with leaching time were investigated and measured using inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). Using the optimized conditions of 1. 5 mol/L hydrochloric and phosphoric acid concentration, liquid to solid ration 10 : 1 and temperature 40 ̊C, actual <b>electroplating</b> sludge was treated.

25|$|For {{a period}} {{following}} {{the second world}} war, pure nickel was <b>electroplated</b> as a lining to copper cookware. Nickel {{had the advantage of}} being harder and more thermally efficient than tin, with a higher melting point. Despite its hardness nickel's wear characteristics were similar to that of tin, as nickel would be plated only to a thickness of <20 microns, and often even less owing to nickel's tendency to plate somewhat irregularly, requiring milling to produce an even cooking surface, albeit sticky compared to tin and silver. Copper cookware with aged or damaged nickel linings is eligible for retinning, or possibly replating with nickel, although this service is difficult if not impossible to find in the US and Europe in the early 21st century. Nickel linings began to fall out of favor in the 1980s owing to the isolation of nickel as an allergen.|$|E
