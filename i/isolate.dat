The C. jejuni <b>isolates</b> originated from humans (75), broilers (95), cattle (29), and pigs (3); the C. coli <b>isolates</b> originated from humans (7), broilers (17), and pigs (99); and the C. lari <b>isolates</b> originated from broilers (5) and cattle (1).

Resistance to tetracycline was more common among C. jejuni <b>isolates</b> from humans (11 %) than among C. jejuni <b>isolates</b> from animals (0 to 2 %).

A greater proportion of C. coli than of C. jejuni <b>isolates</b> were resistant to the other antimicrobial agents tested. <b>Isolates</b> were in most cases either coresistant to tylosin, spiramycin, and erythromycin or susceptible to all three antibiotics. More macrolide-resistant <b>isolates</b> were observed among C. coli <b>isolates</b> from swine (79 %) than among C. coli <b>isolates</b> from broilers (18 %) and humans (14 %).

It was not isolated until 1821, when William Thomas Brande obtained it by electrolysis of lithium oxide, a process that had previously been employed by the chemist Sir Humphry Davy to <b>isolate</b> the alkali metals potassium and sodium. Brande also described some pure salts of lithium, such as the chloride, and, estimating that lithia (lithium oxide) contained about 55% metal, estimated the atomic weight of lithium to be around 9.8 g/mol (modern value ~6.94 g/mol). In 1855, larger quantities of lithium were produced through the electrolysis of lithium chloride by Robert Bunsen and Augustus Matthiessen. The discovery of this procedure led to commercial production of lithium in 1923 by the German company Metallgesellschaft AG, which performed an electrolysis of a liquid mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride.|$|E
