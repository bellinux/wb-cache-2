40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to assess the {{relation}} between the speaking space of the /s/ sound and the <b>freeway</b> <b>space</b> in two subject groups. One group had natural dentition (Group I, n = 61) and the other comprised complete denture wearers (Group II, n = 33). The analysis was done by means of a jaw-tracking device (K 6 -I Diagnostic System, Myotronics Research Inc., Seattle, WA, USA). <b>Freeway</b> <b>space</b> was determined by asking the subjects to occlude from the postural rest position. Speaking space of /s/ was measured during the pronunciation of the word "seis" and comprised the mean distance from the /s/ speaking position to maximal intercuspation. A weak correlation was found between the speaking space of /s/ and the <b>freeway</b> <b>space</b> in Group I (r = 0. 41, p < 0. 01), but in Group II, the correlation was stronger (r = 0. 75, p < 0. 01). The speaking space of /s/ and <b>freeway</b> <b>space</b> were different in Group I, but statistically similar in Group II (paired t-test, a = 0. 05). It can be suggested that anatomic changes following prosthetic procedures caused a functional adaptation which resulted in more similar values for the speaking space of /s/ and the <b>freeway</b> <b>space...</b>|$|E

40|$|Palatal {{augmentation}} prostheses {{are commonly}} used in the treatment for dysphagia. By lowering the palatal contours, the tongue contact is increased and thus the bolus propulsion facilitated. However, the unfavourable weight of such appliances may be avoided when using lingual plates. Hence, {{the aim of this}} study is to investigate the effect of two different types of lingual plates on the vertical dimension in rest position. Eleven healthy dentate subjects with an average age of 35. 5  years (26 - 60  years) volunteered in this pilot study. The vertical overbites were measured on plaster models. Two different designs of the experimental lingual plates were tested in this pilot study (P-type & D-type). The inter-occlusal <b>freeway</b> <b>space</b> was measured using the electromagnetic K 7 jaw-tracking system (Myotronics, U. S. A.), while the subjects were seated in an upright position. They were asked to close from rest position into maximum intercuspation for about 2  s. Recordings were performed without the plates and subsequently with each of the two plate designs in situ. All recordings were performed three times and the second closing movement of each recording was used for the analysis. After averaging the repetitions without experimental lingual plates, with P-type and D-type plates, the differences were analysed using a Kruskall-Wallis test. The results showed no significantly increased <b>freeway</b> <b>space</b> while using both types of lingual plates. Hence, it can be concluded that any altered tongue pressure during swallowing with lingual plates is not related to an increase in vertical dimension...|$|E
40|$|Previous studies {{demonstrated}} {{that while the}} mandible assumes its resting position in space, antagonistic muscles should assume minimal muscle activity within a spatial range. This zone of mandibular rest has been mapped using physiologic parameters of muscle activity and incisal spatial kinematics. This case study expands on previous research by monitoring incisal and posterior jaw position and includes lateral pterygoid muscle activity, thus allowing for determining the spatial range including additional relevant coordinates and muscle activity. Four positions were evaluated: a maximum physiologic open position, a maximum physiologic closed position, physiologic rest position, and maximum physiologic protrusion position. Within the physiologic zone of rest formed by these 4 positions, the vertical and anterior borders of the envelope of function may be documented for the incisal and posterior mandible in true 3 -dimensional fashion to assist the clinician in determining a physiologic interocclusal <b>freeway</b> <b>space</b> and vertical dimension of occlusion.

40|$|The turnout {{structures}} {{under study}} divert {{flows from the}} Weber-Davis Canal near Clearfield, Utah. A portion of the canal in this area was realigned {{as a result of}} the construction of the Interstate Highway System. The twin turnout structures, used to divert water to the West Branch Irrigation Company and West Layton Irrigation Company, were constructed in conjunction with the realignment of the concrete -lined canal. A three-dimensional drawing of the twin turnout structures is shown in Fig. 1. Water is diverted from the canal by passing under the discharge diverted through each of the structures is approximately 35 cfs (cubic feet per second, or second-feet). To properly allocate and assess the quantity of flow delivered to each of the irrigation companies, Parshall flumes having a throat width of four feet and a depth of four feet were placed inside each structure. After passing through the Parshall flumes, the water is conveyed by twin corrugated metal arch pipelines, located under the newly constructed freeway, to existing irrigation distribution systems which serve lands west of the highway. A portion of the twin turnout structures are covered with concrete (Fig. 3) to accommodate the service road located on the west side of the canal. One of the difficulties encountered in the design of the structures was the space available between the canal and the cut bank on the <b>freeway</b> right-of-way. This <b>space</b> limitation resulted in the entrance of the four-foot Parshall flume being located less than nine feet away from the diversion gate. The situation was further aggravated by placing the lip of the gate opening two feet lower than the bottom of the canal. The net result was a high velocity jet passing under the gate with maximum velocities reaching 15 feet per second. The high velocity jet resulted in considerable turbulence and wave action within the structure. The instability of the flow created concern regarding the reliability of the standard calibration for Parshall flumes in predicting the actual flow being diverted to each of the two irrigation companies. In an effort to reduce the height of waves, a metal stilling float was placed in each structure (Fig. 4). The floats did not materially improve the flow conditions...|$|R

40|$|Aim: The {{aim is to}} {{determine}} the average inter-arch space of fully dentate subjects at rest and at occlusion with different facial forms. Materials and Methods: Fifty subjects each of three groups of facial form, square, taper, and oval facial with a complete set of maxillary and mandibular arch teeth with average age from 25 to 40 years were included in this study. An equal number of male and females were included in all the groups. Vertical height at rest and at occlusion was recorded in every subject of the all the three groups using a prescribed procedure, and <b>freeway</b> <b>space</b> (FWS) was measured.

40|$|Statement of Problem: Many {{methods are}} {{reported}} in literature to determine <b>freeway</b> <b>space</b> (FWS), but they yield dissimilar measurements. Purpose: Recording FWS of patients during prosthetic rehabilitation {{is one of the}} important steps in dentistry. The {{purpose of this study is}} to evaluate the ability to predict FWS using lateral profile photographs (LPPs) in edentulous participants. Materials and Methods: Fifty-three participants in the age range of 20 – 27 years who met the inclusion criteria were recruited. LPP were taken for all participants using standard protocol and duplicate copy obtained; on which three soft tissue reference points, porion (Stp), gnathion (Stgn), and gonion (Stg) (Stg prenoted on the face) were marked and joined to form an angle Stp-Stg-Stgn. This angle was correlated with the mean FWS obtained using 3 methods, swallowing, phonetics, and no command. Simple linear regression model was used to develop a prediction formula for FWS using Stp-Stg-Stgn angle as the independent variable. Results: The angle Stp-Stg-Stgn had a significant negative correlation with FWS (r = − 0. 76, P< 0. 001). Using simple linear regression analysis, the following formula was obtained: FWS (in millimeters) = 11. 405 − 0. 072 × (Stp-Stg-Stgn angle in degrees). Conclusion: Within the limitations of this study, considering the usage of LPP as a method to determine the FWS can be recommended...|$|E
40|$|It is {{generally}} assumed {{that children with}} posterior crossbites have abnormal mandibular movements; however, this assumption has not been clearly evaluated. The purpose {{of this investigation was}} to study the movements and the resting position of the mandible in 2 samples of 30 subjects, one aged 10 to 14 years with right posterior crossbite, the other aged 10 to 15 years with normal occlusion. Subjects in both groups exhibited a Class I skeletal relationship and mesofacial growth pattern. A mandibular kinesiograph was used to record both the mandibular resting position and dynamic movements. Mandibular movements were recorded during (1) maximum excursions (opening-closing, protrusion, right and left excursions), (2) swallowing, and (3) mastication. The results showed no differences between groups in the extension of the movements during closing and protrusion. However, crossbite patients exhibited a significant lateral shift during these movements. Right and left excursions were also similar between groups. The dimension of the <b>freeway</b> <b>space</b> was similar between groups, but the lateral shift found in centric occlusion was also present in the crossbite group when the mandible was at rest. The crossbite group more frequently showed a pattern of abnormal swallowing. No differences were found in any of the parameters studied during the masticatory cycle. There was no relationship between the side of the crossbite and the masticatory preference side.

Receiver operating characteristics curve analysis showed that, except EMG parameters during clenching tasks, all the other outcome sEMG and KG measures did not reach acceptable levels of sensitivity and specificity, with a 30 · 6 - 88 · 9 % percentage of false-positive results. Therefore, clinicians should not use sEMG and KG devices as diagnostic tools for individual patients who might have myofascial pain in the jaw muscles. Whether intended as a stand-alone measurement or as an adjunct to making clinical decisions, such instruments do not meet the standard of reliability and validity required for such usage...|$|E
40|$|Investigations were {{performed}} to assess the degree of tooth contact during deglutition. Graphic recordings of vertical jaw movement during deglutition were obtained from par-tially edentulous patients {{by means of an}} intraoral transmitting system. The incidence and position of tooth contact and its rela-tionship to prosthodontics was studied. When designing complete dentures for eden-tulous patients, attention should be paid to the oral physiologic behavior of the individ-ual. Applied physiology, like applied anat-omy, helps the clinician to restore or im-prove oral function. In the field of dental prosthetics, the applied physiology of deglu-tition merits consideration. Before swallowing, the mandible is nor-mally in a position of rest. The entire man-dibular musculature {{is in a state of}} minimal tonic contraction and is so suspended by re-ciprocal coordination of the elevator and de-pressor muscles. ' The occlusal surfaces of the teeth are separated by the extent of the in-terocclusal distance or <b>freeway</b> <b>space.</b> The vertical dimension of the face under these circumstances may be termed the rest vertical dimension (RVD). When swallowing oc-curs, contraction of the elevator muscles re-sults in a vertical upward movement of the mandible. The mandible then assumes a new, temporary relationship to the maxilla. The vertical dimension of the face is re-duced and may be termed the swallowing vertical dimension (SVD). It has been sug-gested 2 that the SVD corresponds to the po-sition of occlusion of maxillary and mandib-ular teeth, the vertical dimension of occlu-sion (OVD), and thus a swallowing action may be used to determine the OVD in eden-tulous patients...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} {{on the effect of}} HOV (high occupancy vehicle) lanes on bottleneck flows is extended here to entire freeways using both theory and empirical evidence. The paper shows that if the flows of both high- and low-occupancy vehicles remain invariant before and after a freeway lane is converted to HOV use, then the freeway's overall traffic density upstream of its bottlenecks is reduced - albeit less than expected - if the HOV lane is underutilized. As a result, HOV lanes can extend queues over longer distances. These expansions can be problematic if the queues' expanded portions impede traffic on heavily traveled routes that do not pass through the bottleneck. To quantify this effect, the paper analyzes HOV lanes on long, multi-ramp freeways. Formulae are given for the changes in people-hours and vehicle-hours of travel induced by an HOV lane, both when there is uncongested <b>freeway</b> <b>space</b> upstream of the queue to accommodate its expansion, and when there is not. All the inputs to these formulae are either observable or easy to estimate. Hence, the recipes can help evaluate any freeway's existing, or planned, HOV lane installation. The HOV lanes at all the sites we have analyzed, which are quite typical, add less than 2 % to vehicular delay and reduce people delay by more than 10 %. These estimates assume no increase in car-pooling. More generally, the paper also suggests how to deploy HOV lanes on city-wide freeway systems and recommends steps to better plan city-wide systems of bus lanes. ...|$|E
40|$|Burning mouth {{syndrome}} (BMS) is {{a distinct}} clinical entity characterized by a chief complaint of unremitting oral burning concomitant with no oral mucosal clinically observable lesions. Numerous causes of this condition have been suggested, including local factors, systemic factors, and psychogenic disorders. A total of 36 consecutive subjects, 32 women and 4 men, complaining of BMS, who had attended the Dental Clinic of the University of Ferrara {{during a period of}} 2 years, was studied. The method of assessment followed closely a strictly co-ordinated management protocol based on conventional guidelines, namely history, clinical examination and special investigations. A detailed history was taken of duration of the condition, site affected, and pattern of burning. The severity and the response to treatment were assessed with a Visual Linear Analogue Scale (VLAS). A full medical history was taken, with regard to xerostomia-inducing drug assumption. The presence and the severity of menopausal symptoms were explored. Inquiries were made on use of mouthwashes. For the denture-wearers, specific questioning was directed to the length of denture-wearing experience, temporal association of the symptom with the wearing of dentures, relationship to burning sensation of any relines or repairs, denture cleaning technique, and use of fixatives. A complete routine intraoral and extraoral examination was performed. The presence of parafunctional habits, such as tongue thrusting, clenching, grinding, lip and cheek biting, was investigated.
