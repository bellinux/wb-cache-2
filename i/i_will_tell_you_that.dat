500|$|In 2004, Antestor {{changed their}} style {{into a more}} modern black metal, and {{released}} their first set of new songs since The Return of the Black Death in an EP called Det tapte liv ("The Lost Life"). Det tapte liv concentrated less on the black metal aspects of Antestor's style, instead focusing more on instrumental songs. [...] However, it hinted at what the band was preparing for their 2005 full-length, The Forsaken. The cover arts for both releases were once again done by Kristian Wåhlin, and the cover for the EP depicts the Borgund Stave Church. Hellhammer played all drums on both of these releases. In {{an interview with the}} Russian metal site Metal Library on January 7, 2007, Blomberg was asked what did his Mayhem colleagues and record company think about his participation in Antestor, and he said: [...] "To be honest, it was a big 'fuck off!' to them all. I will repeat again that I decide what I do and I play not only in black metal groups." [...] The band also asked Hellhammer to play live for them, but Blomberg refused. Hellhammer also went to state: [...] "In my opinion, black metal today is just music. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> neither I nor other members of Mayhem never really were against religion or something else. We are primarily interested in music." [...] Ronny Hansen commented on Blomberg's appearance: ...|$|E

2500|$|Some of the {{original}} Norwegian black metal musicians believe that black metal {{does not need to}} hold any ideologies. For example, Jan Axel [...] "Hellhammer" [...] Blomberg of Mayhem has {{said in an interview with}} Metal Library: [...] "In my opinion, black metal today is just music. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> neither I nor other [...] members of Mayhem never really were against religion or something else. We are primarily interested in music." [...] Although rejecting the idea of [...] "Christian black metal", Satyricon's vocalist Sigurd Wongraven stated in the Murder Music documentary that black metal [...] "doesn't necessarily have to be all Satanic as long as it's dark".|$|E
