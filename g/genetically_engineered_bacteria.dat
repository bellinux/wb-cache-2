In our study, a gene encoding a GST from Proteus mirabilis strain V 7, gst(Pm) - 4, was cloned and conditionally expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL 21 (DE 3). The purified Gst(Pm) - 4 protein, with an estimated molecular mass of approximately 23 kDa, was able to conjugate 1 -chloro- 2, 4 -dinitrobenzene and bind to the GSH-affinity matrix.

2500|$|Biotechnology {{has contributed}} to the {{discovery}} and manufacturing of traditional small molecule pharmaceutical drugs as well as drugs that are the product of biotechnology – biopharmaceutics. Modern biotechnology can be used to manufacture existing medicines relatively easily and cheaply. The first <b>genetically</b> <b>engineered</b> products were medicines designed to treat human diseases. To cite one example, in 1978 Genentech developed synthetic humanized insulin by joining its gene with a plasmid vector inserted into the bacterium Escherichia coli. Insulin, widely used for the treatment of diabetes, was previously extracted from the pancreas of abattoir animals (cattle or pigs). The resulting <b>genetically</b> <b>engineered</b> <b>bacterium</b> enabled the production of vast quantities of synthetic human insulin at relatively low cost. Biotechnology has also enabled emerging therapeutics like gene therapy. [...] The application of biotechnology to basic science (for example through the Human Genome Project) has also dramatically improved our understanding of biology and as our scientific knowledge of normal and disease biology has increased, our ability to develop new medicines to treat previously untreatable diseases has increased as well.|$|R

[...] The patent in Chakrabarty claimed a <b>genetically</b> <b>engineered</b> <b>bacterium</b> that {{was capable of}} breaking down various components of crude oil.

The Court held that the modified bacterium was patentable because it was [...] "new" [...] with [...] "markedly different characteristics from any found in nature and one having the potential for significant utility." [...] Accordingly, discoveries that possess [...] "markedly different characteristics from any found in nature" [...] are eligible for patent protection, but any existing organism or newly discovered plant found in the wild is not patentable.

40|$|Even though arsenic {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{widespread}} environmental carcinogens, methods of remediation are still limited. In this report we demonstrate that a strain of Pseudomonas putida KT 2440 endowed with chromosomal expression of the arsM gene encoding the As(III) S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) methyltransfase from Rhodopseudomonas palustris to remove arsenic from contaminated soil. We <b>genetically</b> <b>engineered</b> the P. putida KT 2440 with stable expression of an arsM-gfp fusion gene (GE P. putida), which was inserted into the bacterial chromosome. GE P. putida showed high arsenic methylation and volatilization activity. When exposed to 25 mu M arsenite or arsenate overnight, most inorganic arsenic was methylated to the less toxic methylated arsenicals methylarsenate (MAs(V)), dimethylarsenate (DMAs(V)) and trimethylarsine oxide (TMAs(V) O). Of total added arsenic, the species were about 62 +/- 2. 2 % DMAs(V), 25 +/- 1. 4 % MAs(V) and 10 +/- 1. 2 % TMAs(V) O. Volatilized arsenicals were trapped, and the predominant species were dimethylarsine (Me 2 AsH) (21 +/- 1. 0 %) and trimethylarsine (TMAs(III)) (10 +/- 1. 2 %). At later times, more DMAs(V) and volatile species were produced.

40|$|This {{case study}} {{examines}} the federal regulatory process {{with respect to}} a bacterium that was genetically modified to detect the presence of, and degrade, hazardous wastes derived from petroleum. Genes from several other organisms were introduced into the transgenic bacterium. The primary regulatory statute involved is the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), 15 U. S.

40|$|The {{bacterium}} Bacillus thuringiensis {{has been}} used as a microbial insecticide for half a century. However, limitations on its use against a pest such as Eldana saccharina Walker are that: a) B. thuringiensis is a soil-inhabiting organism and is therefore not persistent on plants, and b) the proteinaceous insecticide is degraded by sunlight when the bacterial cells lyse at the end of their life cycle. Five years ago the SASA Experiment Station and the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) embarked on a collaborative project to transfer genetic material from one bacterium, B. thuringiensis which produces an insecticide, to another bacterium Pseudomonas j/uorescens. P. fluorescens occurs ubiquitously on plants and if genetically manipulated to produce the insecticide, the bacteria would be ingested by young foraging eldana larvae outside the stalk, and further damage to the sugarcane would be prevented. Toxicity bioassays carried out in the laboratory indicated that P. j/uorescens <b>genetically</b> <b>engineered</b> to produce the insecticide was toxic to eldana larvae and a LCso value of 1, 86 mg of freeze-dried bacterial powder/ml of insect diet was calculated. The <b>genetically</b> <b>engineered</b> <b>bacterium</b> was found to colonise sugarcane in pots to a satisfactory level for a period of five months, after which time the bacteria could not be recovered from plants. Sugarcane plants in the glasshouse inoculated with the genetically manipulated bacterium were protected from eldana damage when compared with untreated controls.

50|$|The high mycolic acid {{content of}} certain Protozoa cell walls, {{and those of}} Mycobacteria, is {{responsible}} for the staining pattern of poor absorption followed by high retention.

Another method is the Kinyoun method, in which the bacteria are stained bright red and stand out clearly against a green background. Acid-fast Mycobateria can also be visualized by fluorescence microscopy using specific fluorescent dyes (auramine-rhodamine stain, for example). Some bacteria may also be partially acid-fast. The eggs of the parasitic lung fluke Paragonimus westermani are actually destroyed by the stain, which can hinder diagnosis in patients who present with TB-like symptoms.|$|E

5000|$|After the {{discovery}} of the lux operon, the use of bioluminescent bacteria as a laboratory tool is claimed to have revolutionized the area of environmental microbiology.

Biosensors, created by placing a lux gene construct under the control of an inducible promoter, can be used to determine the concentration of specific pollutants.
