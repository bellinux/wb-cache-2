40|$|I. The {{histology}} of the cuticle and epidermis {{of certain}} chilopods and diplopods is described. Two principal {{layers of the}} cuticle are recognized, an outer homogeneous and refractile exocuticle which is usually but not invariably pigmented and an inner endocuticle. 2. The endocuticle and the exocuticle both contain chitin. The exocuticle is con-sidered as a modification of the outer part of the chitinous matrix by an <b>impregnating</b> <b>substance.</b> 3. Certain properties of the <b>impregnating</b> <b>substance</b> are described. It {{appears to be a}} substance rich in phenolic groups, perhaps a protein, which has a stability and resistance to acids in its own right irrespective of the presence of pigment or aromatic cross-links. Pro-sclerotin is suggested as a name for this substance. Chemical tests show that it is present in regions not optically definable as exocuticle. 4. The epidermis is virtually an epithelium of gland cells which appear to secrete lipoid material. The lipoid passes on {{to the surface of the}} cuticle by means of ducts passing through the cuticle.

40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} the optimal operating conditions {{in order to obtain}} cost effective production of activated carbon (AC) from palm kernel shell (PKS) by microwave heating. Interactions among the independent variables, namely irradiation time (T), microwave power (W), impregnation ratio between impregnating substances and PKS, and the concentration of <b>impregnating</b> <b>substance</b> (sulphuric acid) were considered for optimising the process parameters during the production of AC, aided by Central Composite Design. The optimum conditions for the independent process variables were 11. 02 minutes of irradiation time, microwave power of 676 W and impregnation ratio of 0. 68. The AC produced in this work had a surface area of 1011 m(2) g(- 1) with high porosity as shown by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Zinc was used to verify the potential of AC as an adsorbent. Zinc removal at the optimum conditions was found to be 13. 72 mg g(- 1). Such a Zn removal value is comparable with the earlier work of other researchers who used a conventional way of producing the AC. It is believed that microwave technology can be used for the production of AC in a short time with high energy efficiency, e. g., 11 minutes against 2 - 5 hours of reactivation for conventional methods...|$|E
40|$|Summary. Sapwood of beech and birch was {{impregnated}} with aqueous salt {{solutions and}} suspensions of carbon particles and india ink under a low initial pressure; the pathways {{marked by the}} <b>impregnating</b> <b>substances</b> were examined by the electron microscope. The micrographs revealed dark deposits in cell lumina, pit membranes, {{and other parts of}} the cell wall. The size of voids occupied by dark deposits ranged from infinitely small to 700 A in vessels and rays, and from infinitely small to 1, 300 A in fibers. It was concluded that the penetration path of <b>impregnating</b> <b>substances</b> from one cell to the next was through the minute intermicrofibrillar openings in the communicating pit membranes and in the rest of the cell walls. Carbon particles, suspended in plastic monomer, were not observed either in pit membranes or in the rest of the cell wall; they probably represent a nonpolar substance...|$|R

30|$|The {{potential}} of muirapiranga (Brosimun sp.) {{as a substitute}} material for violin bows was estimated in terms of vibrational properties, {{and the influence of}} extractives on the vibrational properties was examined. The loss tangent of muirapiranga was somewhat higher and the specific dynamic Young’s modulus was rather lower than the respective values for pernambuco, which is regarded as the best material for violin bows. Therefore, muirapiranga is a poorer bow material in terms of vibrational properties. Impregnation of crude extractives from muirapiranga decreased the loss tangent of other wood specimens. The main compounds of the extractives were identified as xanthyletin and luvangetin. Impregnations of isolated xanthyletin and commercially available methoxsalen, which was tested as an analogue of luvangetin, markedly decreased the loss tangent of other wood specimens. Methoxsalen and xanthyletin differ from conventional loss tangent-decreasing substances, namely protosappanin B and hematoxylin, in terms of water insolubility and the absence of hydroxyl groups. From the similarity in molecular characteristics of loss tangent-decreasing substances found so far, restriction of molecular motion due to an <b>impregnated</b> <b>substance</b> in the wood matrix is suggested as one loss tangent-decreasing mechanism.|$|R

At the top canopy level (CL 28 m) of the adult beech, CCI and leaf anatomy reflected higher light stress, while gsmax increased with height, reflecting the importance of gas exchange in the upper canopy layer. Leaf wettability, measured as drop contact angle, decreased from 85. 5 ° ± 1. 6 ° (summer) to 57. 5 ° ± 2. 8 ° (autumn) at CL 28 m of the adult tree. At CL 22 m, adult beech leaves seemed to be better optimized for photosynthesis than the CL 28 m leaves because of a large leaf thickness with less protective and <b>impregnated</b> <b>substances,</b> and a higher CCI. The beech saplings, in contrast, did not adapt their stomatal characteristics and leaf anatomy according to the same strategy as the adult beech leaves.

By fastening an elastic band around the sinus colonarius the solutions were retained for 3 hours. No special poses were required {{of the patients}} and voluntary movements were permitted. Highly satisfactory results were obtained in an all-over 83 %; Out of 25 acute cases 96 % were cured. For acute cases 100. 000 u. penicillin, and for chronic cases streptomycin 250 mg is suggested and {{in both cases the}} absence of side effects is note worthy with various advantageous points over others.

Bags of synthetic pheromones were hung on 10 healthy trees in each of the two stands of 50 and 70 years old spruce trees. Two months later, these variables and the intensity of the insects attacks were quantified. In the 70 years old stand, the intensity of attacks was hardly related to the anatomical characteristics of the bark. However, for the other stand, 59 % and 83 % of the variability of the attacks at 3 and 6 meters respectively are explained by the anatomical characteristics, mainly due to the thickness of dead parenchyma and phloem of the outer bark.

40|$|Several chiral {{drugs are}} {{produced}} and administered as pure enantiomers, whereas many others, especially of synthetic origin, are used {{mainly in the}} form of racemates. The biological and pharmacological activity of chiral compounds depends on their configuration. The racemic drugs may exhibit quite different activity from the optically pure drugs. Often only one of the enantiomers is pharmacologically active and/or even can be toxic. Since numerous enantiomers have been shown to behave differently from at least one point of view, whether pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, toxicological or interaction, there seems to be hardly any exception to the general rule that a racemate cannot be considered as a single drug entity.

40|$|Four {{approaches}} for testing for overall migration and specific chemical migration from microwave susceptors were evaluated. The methods used olive oil as a conventional liquid food simulant, a semisolid simulant {{of olive oil}} and water absorbed onto diatomaceous earth, Tenax(TM) as a dry simulant, and compositional analysis of the susceptor by ASTM methods. The different methods were tested on five susceptor types used for the packaging of pizza, potato chips (French fries), pasty, popcorn, and a curry. For the comparison, the susceptor materials were <b>impregnated</b> with model <b>substances</b> as migration markers covering a range of molecular weight, volatility and polarity. Levels of specific migration (SM) and overall migration (OM) were determined using the four test methods, which were then evaluated {{on the basis of}} their ease and reproducibility of use along with the agreement between specific migration levels into simulants compared with migration into foods. There were severe problems with olive oil as a conventional liquid simulant as it was absorbed by the susceptor and made SM and OM measurements difficult. Humidity conditioning the susceptor for OM was a further difficulty with olive oil. Oil absorption was also a problem using the semisolid simulant, with OM being untried using this approach. The ASTM methods were found to be time-consuming, although the results for SM were similar to those obtained for foods. Overall, however, using Tenax was the preferred method for migration testing of susceptors. It allowed easy measurement of both OM and SM, SM values were generally much higher than for foods, however, and a reduction factor would be required for control of regulated ingredients. For other substances, such as thermal degradation products, a threshold of regulation approach applied to the Tenax extract would be a simple and effective control measure...|$|R
40|$|The {{starting}} point of this work {{is the idea that}} the concept of “crisis” should be approached with no fear. It is necessary to understand it as the signal which attracts attention upon the fact that some changes are appropriate and that some rationally thought actions ought to be taken in order to soften the social phenomena occurring within a crisis period. We may say that in the core of the crisis lies <b>impregnated</b> the basic <b>substance</b> of progress and that the moment when a crisis is declared is as well the moment of a new start. It is necessary to anticipate the crisis, in order to prepare the adequate means able to soften up the shocks created by its incipit and to bring forward the progress through its action itself. One of the most necessary and useful instruments able to smooth down the crisis' effects is the early education provided to the citizens concerning the frame of the behavior to be adopted in case of crisis. The officials and the public servants are the social actors who constitute the interface between the citizen who is going to suffer the crisis and this latter's exerted pressure. The personnel from the public administration has to assume the hardest role in reducing the most possible the crisis' effects. Some possibilities are analysed that could reduce the effects of the economical, social and political crises, among which the most important is the quality of juridical norms. The Romanian legislation concerning the public charge is studied, in respect to its capacity to motivate the public servant to perform at his up most level, during crisis periods but not only then. The idea is emphasized that panic and uncontrolled social movements in case of a crisis might lead to the multiplying of the negative effects. The personnel from the public administration comes to a direct confrontation with the pressure of the negative effect of the crisis, as it is received by the public administration - understood as a structure, multiplied by the number of persons which compose the civil society. Thus we may speak of a double sensed multiplying: the administration's crisis multiplied by the crisis of the administrated. This perspective involves a size index of more than 16 millions and might generate uncontrollable social phenomena. The central public administration holds the role of elaborating projects of normative acts and plans of concrete measures in order to prevent all types of crises. When the crisis is impossible to prevent, some management plans are required from it. De lege ferenda suggestions are formulated...|$|R
60|$|And {{that we may}} {{the better}} finde what the cause of Congruity and Incongruity in bodies is, it will be {{requisite}} to consider, First, what {{is the cause of}} fluidness; And this, I conceive, to be nothing else but a certain pulse or shake of heat; for Heat being nothing else but a very brisk and vehement agitation of the parts of a body (as I have elswhere made probable) the parts of a body are thereby made so loose from one another, that they easily move any way, and become fluid. That I may explain this a little by a gross Similitude, let us suppose a dish of sand set upon some body that is very much agitated, and shaken with some quick and strong vibrating motion, as on a Milstone turn'd round upon the under stone very violently whilst it is empty; or on a very stiff Drum-head, which is vehemently or very nimbly beaten with the Drumsticks. By this means, the sand in the dish, which before lay like a dull and unactive body, becomes a perfect fluid; and ye can no sooner make a hole in it with your finger, but it is immediately filled up again, and the upper surface of it levell'd. Nor can you bury a light body, as a piece of Cork under it, but it presently emerges or swims as 'twere on the top; nor can you lay a heavier on the top of it, as a piece of Lead, but it is immediately buried in Sand, and (as 'twere) sinks to the bottom. Nor can you make a hole {{in the side of the}} Dish, but the sand shall run out of it to a level, not an obvious property of a fluid body, as such, but this dos imitate; and all this meerly caused by the vehement agitation of the conteining vessel; for by this means, each sand becomes to have a vibrative or dancing motion, so as no other heavier body can rest on it, unless sustein'd by some other on either side: Nor will it suffer any Body to be beneath it, unless it be a heavier then it self. Another Instance of the strange loosening nature of a violent jarring Motion, or a strong and nimble vibrative one, we may have from a piece of iron grated on very strongly with a file: for if into that a pin screw'd so firm and hard, that though it has a convenient head to it, yet it can by no means be unscrew'd by the fingers; if, I say, you attempt to unscrew this whilst grated on by the file, it will be found to undoe and turn very easily. The first of these Examples manifests, how a body actually divided into small parts, becomes a fluid. And the latter manifests by what means the agitation of heat so easily loosens and unties the parts of solid and firm bodies. Nor need we suppose heat to be any thing else, besides such a motion; for supposing we could Mechanically produce such a one quick and strong enough, we need not spend fuel to melt a body. Now, that I do not speak this altogether groundless, I must refer the Reader to the Observations I have made upon the shining sparks of Steel, for there he shall find that the same effects are produced upon small chips or parcels of Steel by the flame, and by a quick and violent motion; and if the body of steel may be thus melted (as I there shew it may) I think we have little reason to doubt that almost any other may not also. Every Smith can inform one how quickly both his File and the Iron grows hot with filing, and if you rub almost any two hard bodies together, they will do the same: And we know, that a sufficient degree of heat causes fluidity, in some bodies much sooner, and in others later; that is, the parts of the body of some are so loose from one another, and so unapt to cohere, and so minute and little, that a very small degree of agitation keeps them always in the state of fluidity. Of this kind, I suppose, the Æther, that is the medium or fluid body, in which all other bodies do as it were swim and move; and particularly, the Air, which seems nothing else but a kind of tincture or solution of terrestrial and aqueous particles dissolv'd into it, and agitated by it, just as the tincture of Cocheneel is nothing but some finer dissoluble parts of that Concrete lick'd up or dissolv'd by the fluid water. And from this Notion of it, we may easily give a more Intelligible reason how the Air becomes so capable of Rarefaction and Condensation. For, as in tinctures, one grain of some strongly tinging substance may sensibly colour some hundred thousand grains of appropriated Liquors, so as every drop of it has its proportionate share, and be sensibly ting'd, as I have try'd both with Logwood and Cocheneel: And as some few grains of Salt is able to infect as great a quantity, as may be found by præcipitations, though not so easily by the sight or taste; so the Air, which seems to be but as 'twere a tincture or saline substance, dissolv'd and agitated by the fluid and agil Æther, may disperse and expand it self into a vast space, if it have room enough, and infect, as it were, every part of that space. But, as on the other side, if there be but some few grains of the liquor, it may extract all the colour of the tinging substance, and may dissolve all the Salt, and thereby become much more <b>impregnated</b> with those <b>substances,</b> so may all the air that sufficed in a rarfy'd state to fill some hundred thousand spaces of Æther, be compris'd in only one, but in a position proportionable dense. And though we have not yet found out such strainers for Tinctures and Salts as we have for the Air, being yet unable to separate them from their dissolving liquors by any kind of filtre, without præcipitation, as we are able to separate the Air from the Æther by Glass, and several other bodies. And though we are yet unable and ignorant of the ways of præcipitating Air out of the Æther as we can Tinctures, and Salts out of several dissolvents; yet neither of these seeming impossible from the nature of the things, nor so improbable but that some happy future industry may find out ways to effect them; nay, further, since we find that Nature does really perform (though by what means we are not certain) both these actions, namely, by præcipitating the Air in Rain and Dews, and by supplying the Streams and Rivers of the World with fresh water, strain'd through secret subterraneous Caverns: And since, that in very many other proprieties they do so exactly seem of the same nature; till further observations or tryals do inform us of the contrary, we may safely enough conclude them of the same kind. For it seldom happens that any two natures have so many properties coincident or the same, as I have observ'd Solutions and Air to have, and to be different in the rest. And therefore I think it neither impossible, irrational, nay nor difficult to be able to predict what is likely to happen in other particulars also, besides those which Observation or Experiment have declared thus or thus; especially, if the circumstances that do often very much conduce to the variation of the effects be duly weigh'd and consider'd. And indeed, were there not a probability of this, our inquiries would be endless, our tryals vain, and our greatest inventions would be nothing but the meer products of chance, and not of Reason; and, like Mariners in an Ocean, destitute both of a Compass and the sight of the Celestial guids, we might indeed, by chance, Steer directly towards our desired Port, but 'tis a thousand to one but we miss our aim. But to proceed, we may hence also give a plain reason, how the Air comes to be darkned by clouds, &c. which are nothing but a kind of precipitation, and how those precipitations fall down in Showrs. Hence also could I very easily, and I think truly, deduce the cause of the curious sixangular figures of Snow, and the appearances of Haloes, &c. and the sudden thickning of the Sky with Clouds, and the vanishing and disappearing of those Clouds again; for all these things may be very easily imitated in a glass of liquor, with some slight Chymical preparations as I have often try'd, and may somewhere else more largely relate, but have not now time to set them down. But to proceed, there are other bodies that consist of particles more Gross, and of a more apt figure for cohesion, and this requires somewhat greater agitation; such, I suppose [Mercury], fermented vinous Spirits, several Chymical Oils, which are much of kin to those Spirits, &c. Others yet require a greater, as water, and so others much greater, for almost infinite degrees: For, I suppose there are very few bodies in the world that may not be made aliquatenus fluid, by some or other degree of agitation or heat.|$|R
