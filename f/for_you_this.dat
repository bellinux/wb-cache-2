The morning of the 14th the astronauts' wake-up call was the song [...] "Should I Stay or Should I Go" [...] by The Clash, {{at the request of}} Shepherd's wife. Shepherd, a former Navy SEAL, said during the change over ceremony: [...] "May the good will, spirit and sense of mission we had enjoyed on board endure. Sail her well." [...] The commander of Discovery, Jim Wetherbee, said [...] ""For Captain Shepherd and his crew, we hold you in admiration as we prepare to bring you home.

2500|$|When O'Reilly {{appeared}} on The Daily Show {{before the second}} episode of The Colbert Report aired, he commented, [...] "Before we get started, somebody told me walking in here, you got some French guy on after you making fun of me?", and made several references in the following interview to 'the French Guy'. In a subsequent Newsweek interview, O'Reilly said that he [...] "feels it's a compliment" [...] to have Colbert parody him because Colbert [...] "isn't mean-spirited" [...] and does not [...] "use [...] platform to injure people". Later, Colbert replied on-air, [...] "I like you too. In fact, if it wasn't <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> <b>this</b> show wouldn't exist." ...|$|E

2500|$|Another {{interpretation}} obviates all of {{the speculation}} about the Sabbath year entirely, translating the verse as: [...] "And this shall be the sign <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> <b>this</b> year you shall eat what grows by itself, and the next year, what grows from the tree stumps, and in the third year, sow and reap, and plant vineyards and eat their fruit." [...] According to the Judaica Press commentary, it was Sennacherib's invasion that prevented the people of Judah from sowing {{in the first year}} and Isaiah was promising that enough plants would grow to feed the population {{for the rest of the}} first year and the second year. Therefore, Isaiah was truly providing a sign to Hezekiah that God would save the city of Jerusalem, as explicitly stated, and not an injunction concerning the Sabbath (shmita) or jubilee (yovel) years, which are not mentioned at all in the passage.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, The Colbert Report premiered on Comedy Central. The show, {{hosted by}} Stephen Colbert, is a satirical spoof of pundit shows like The O'Reilly Factor, {{spoofing}} its format and the mannerisms and ideology of O'Reilly, whom Colbert calls [...] "Papa Bear." [...] Colbert makes {{no secret of}} his spoofing O'Reilly: upon hearing the news that O'Reilly approved of The Colbert Report, he declared on-air that [...] "I like you too. In fact, if it wasn't <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> <b>this</b> show wouldn't exist." [...] On January 18, 2007, Colbert appeared on The O'Reilly Factor and O'Reilly appeared on [...] The Colbert Report. After Bill O'Reilly left the show, the Late Show character Stephen Colbert made an appearance [...] "via satelite" [...] to bid his farewell to Bill. [...] "“Hello, nation." [...] He said. [...] "Shame on you. You failed him. You failed Bill O’Reilly. You didn’t deserve this great man...Bill, I invite you to come live in a mountain cabin with me and Jon Stewart. It’s fun; you’ll like it. We’ve got an animal sanctuary; Jon and I milk the goats, and soon I hope Jon and I will be milking you. Stay strong, papa bear.” ...|$|E
2500|$|However, {{recording}} did {{not begin}} until April 2010. Friend and Pretty. Odd. producer Rob Mathes was [...] "like family" [...] to Smith and Urie, inspiring them to be excited to record despite the duo's initial beginning. He encouraged them to love the work they do, and [...] "... Just {{get out of bed}} in the morning, don’t loathe the things that you actually love doing, because it’s just going to keep you down," [...] for which Urie recalled the band [...] "owed a lot" [...] for. After working with the demos produced during the summer with Feldmann for several months afterward, the duo decided they weren't satisfactory, so the band started over with new material. The biggest difference for the band was that it was now half the previous band, with Urie and Smith writing everything. The album was produced by Feldmann and Butch Walker. Urie recalled that they were initially nervous to experiment with new producers, but instead regarded Feldmann and Walker's input positively, regarding their help as [...] "Hey, this is your record, I want to help you with your ideas. So you bring me the ideas, and we’ll help you do that. I don’t want to write anything <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> <b>this</b> is your record, it has to be your voice." [...] The band continued working with Feldmann for four months in early 2010, later going to Walker to finalize and improve the songs.|$|E
