40|$|ABSTRACT : BACKGROUND : On 1 November 2000, {{a series}} of new <b>item</b> <b>numbers</b> {{was added to the}} Medicare Benefits Schedule, which allowed for case {{conferences}} between physicians (including psychiatrists) and other multidisciplinary providers. On 1 November 2002, an additional set of numbers was added, designed especially for use by psychiatrists. This paper reports the findings of an evaluation of these <b>item</b> <b>numbers.</b> RESULTS : The uptake of the <b>item</b> <b>numbers</b> in the three years post their introduction was low to moderate at best. Eighty nine psychiatrists rendered 479 case conferences at a cost to the Health Insurance Commission of $ 70, 584. Psychiatrists who have used the <b>item</b> <b>numbers</b> are generally positive about them, as are consumers. Psychiatrists who have not used them have generally not done so {{because of a lack of}} knowledge, rather than direct opposition. The use of the <b>item</b> <b>numbers</b> is increasing over time, perhaps as psychiatrists become more aware of their existence and of their utility in maximising quality of care. CONCLUSION : The case conferencing <b>item</b> <b>numbers</b> have potential, but as yet this potential is not being realised. Some small changes to the conditions associated with the use of the <b>item</b> <b>numbers</b> could assist their uptake...|$|R

Objectives This paper explores {{some of the}} reasons why the uptake of Health Assessment for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People remains low in some metropolitan general practices.
