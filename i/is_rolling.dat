5|$|Pistorius {{is always}} slow in {{starting}} a race because the flexible blades {{do not provide}} thrust out of the blocks. Pistorius must begin from an awkward position, swing his leg to the outside and pop straight up from the blocks to begin running, when the preferred method is to push off with horizontal force. For the first 30 meters of a race, he keeps {{his head down and}} takes short, quick strides. As he establishes a rhythm, he can raise his head and increase his speed. While some runners jog up and down, losing energy, Pistorius directs energy forward, looking somewhat like he <b>is</b> <b>rolling</b> on wheels. He also compensates for the adjustments ankles make on the turns, breaking the curves into short, straight lines. According to his coach Ampie Louw, Pistorius may {{be able to use the}} inward lean to generate force and come out of a turn going faster.|$|E

25|$|A simple {{example of}} the central limit theorem <b>is</b> <b>rolling</b> {{a large number of}} identical, {{unbiased}} dice. The distribution of the sum (or average) of the rolled numbers will be well approximated by a normal distribution. Since real-world quantities are often the balanced sum of many unobserved random events, the central limit theorem also provides a partial explanation for the prevalence of the normal probability distribution. It also justifies the approximation of large-sample statistics to the normal distribution in controlled experiments.|$|E

25|$|To {{the east}} of Fellbarrow is the Vale of Lorton, through which flows the River Cocker. This is a wide {{cultivated}} valley {{with a number of}} small parcels of woodland, the settlement of Thackthwaite lying nearest to the fell. To the west are a number of small streams including Mosser Beck and Cat Gill, which also flow northward and ultimately join the Cocker. This <b>is</b> <b>rolling</b> agricultural land on {{the very edge of the}} Lake District. North of Fellbarrow is the lower top of Hatteringill Head (1,263ft), listed in some guidebooks before the ridge falls away over Whin Fell to a minor road known as Mirk Lane. Fellbarrow also sends out a short ridge north eastward over Broadmoor Hill towards Low Lorton village. The fell is rounded and grassy almost throughout.|$|E

Known as the Tea Room, it was operated by a concessionaire for the next 50 years, serving lunches featuring Hampton Imperial Crab (backfin lump meat from the blue crab, baked and seasoned with spices) and other Chesapeake Bay seafood delicacies, served with a glass of sherry. A local newspaper columnist described the Tea Room as [...] "offering gentility ... a fireplace nearly as big as a wall and mullioned windows with sills that are nearly [...] thick.

500|$|Hamasaki's lyrics, all her own, have {{resonated}} {{among her}} fans, who praise {{them as being}} honest and heartfelt and [...] "expressing determination"; in two surveys conducted by Oricon, respondents voted Hamasaki's lyrics as their favorite aspect of her artistry. Steve McClure of The Japan Times noted that Hamasaki has [...] "developed {{a reputation as a}} thoughtful, introspective lyricist"; Barry Walters of The Village Voice comments that Hamasaki's lyrics [...] "pack unlikely insights". Having [...] "trouble voicing her thoughts", Hamasaki uses her lyrics as an outlet; she draws inspiration from her own (and occasionally her friends') experiences and emotions and tries to put them [...] "honestly into words". She has stated that honesty is essential to her lyrics, saying, [...] "If I write when I'm low, it will be a dark song, but I don't care. I want to be honest with myself at all times." [...] This meant that she did not use English lyrics until her album Rainbow, as she felt that she could best express herself in Japanese. As with her musical style, the themes of her lyrics have varied. Her debut album A Song for ×× dealt mostly with themes of [...] "loneliness and confusion", as did her second album Loveppears. Duty likewise expressed feelings of disappointment and confusion. Hamasaki began to take on a more global outlook with her following albums I Am... and Rainbow, branching out to wider themes such as faith and peace. Music critic Tetsu Misaki noted a large change in her lyrics style between her debut album A Song for ×× (1999), which mostly dealt with personal problems, and her following albums Loveppears and Duty. Misaki believed Hamasaki had begun thinking about her influence on society more, and began writing songs with important messages she wanted to express to her listeners. This was signalled by her not using first person pronouns as much, and instead using the words [...] and [...] more often. As Hamasaki matured, her lyrics began to express more confidence; themes in her later albums included love and the struggles of women. With Guilty, Hamasaki began to compose her lyrics not only as an exposition of her personal feelings but as encouragements for her listeners, an outlook she applied in Next Level as well. In songs such as [...] "Talkin' 2 Myself" [...] and [...] "Mirrorcle World", Hamasaki deals with the [...] "awareness and fighting spirit of surviving in a high-risk age" [...] to encourage listeners; in [...] "Rollin'" [...] (from Next Level), Hamasaki writes, [...] "The age <b>is</b> <b>rolling</b> around/At the speed of heading toward the end/Beyond the border/Disappointment and hope fight with each other". In addition to personal experiences and feelings, Hamasaki bases lyrics on sources such as historical events. The life of Joan of Arc was the inspiration for [...] "Free & Easy", while a story told to her by her friend about a saint named Mary served as the basis for [...] "M"; the September 11 attacks inspired [...] "A Song Is Born".|$|E

2500|$|He {{continued}} {{to experiment with}} his in-camera special effects, such as a reverse shot in A Dinner Under Difficulties, where he hand cranked a strip of film backwards through his camera to achieve the effect. He also experimented with superimposition, where he would film actors in a black background, then rewind the film through the camera and expose the footage again to create a double exposure. These films included The Cave of the Demons, in which transparent ghosts haunt a cave, and The Four Troublesome Heads, in which Méliès removes his own head three times and creates a musical chorus. Achieving these effects was extremely difficult and required skill. In a 1907 article, Méliès noted: [...] "Every second the actor playing different scenes ten times has to remember, while the film <b>is</b> <b>rolling,</b> exactly what he did {{at the same point}} in the preceding scenes and the exact place where he was on the stage." ...|$|E

[...] "I don’t think we’ll know that for years. And by that point we’ll actually be a little too late to go, [...] "Oops, my bad, we shouldn’t have done this,’ and then try to unwind it." [...] Bloomberg reported in 2015 that the IRS help center is not able to provide adequate taxpayer customer service. In 2016, the Taxpayer Advocate reported that [...] "FATCA implementation has created significant compliance burdens and risk exposures" [...] for overseas Americans, and its [...] "heavy-handed approach, especially when combined with the complexity surrounding IRS requirements, has negative consequences, both for FFIs and the IRS".|$|E
