5|$|Calvin {{thought that}} {{agriculture}} {{and the traditional}} crafts were normal human activities. With regard to trade and the financial world he was more liberal than Luther, but both were strictly opposed to usury. Calvin allowed the charging of modest <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>on</b> <b>loans.</b> Like the other Reformers Calvin understood work as a means through which the believers expressed their gratitude to God for their redemption in Christ and as a service to their neighbors. Everybody was obliged to work; loafing and begging were rejected. The idea that economic success was a visible sign of God's grace played only a minor role in Calvin's thinking. It became more important in later, partly secularized forms of Calvinism and became the starting-point of Max Weber's theory about the rise of capitalism.|$|E

For this purpose, <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> and <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> spreads in Croatia are compared to rates and spreads in selected European countries. The paper explores the correlation of <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> with a variety of potential factors and compares the level of <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> and spreads with an average growth rate of economic activity.
