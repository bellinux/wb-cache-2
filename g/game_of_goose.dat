40|$|Historians {{investigating}} {{board games}} {{of the world have}} traditionally examinedancient or early games, using artifacts, drawings, and available text. From this,they hoped {{to learn more about the}} cultures in which these games flourished, how the games moved from one territory to another (trade routes), and how they chan-ged and evolved in different cultures. Traditional classic games such as chess, checkers (draughts), Mancala, Pachisi, Mill (Mühle or Nine Mens Morris), Fox and Geese, and the <b>Game</b> <b>of</b> <b>Goose,</b> among others, have been studied in great detail by many scholars. Some of these games were played on quite elaborate, carved wooden boards, and, as such, they were available only to a privileged few. In the middle 1800 s, however, advances in lithography and in techniques of the mass production of printed matter allowed games to be commercially produced in large quantities. They were also inexpensive enough to be affordable by the less affluent. This meant that games could reach a larger portion of the population, and become a staple in more homes. What purposes have games served in society? Were they recreational or were they intended as educational or instructional instruments? And who manufactured and sup-plied these games to the public? In the United States, a study of games poses one immediate limit for the researcher...|$|E

40|$|Any {{observer}} of games will note {{that they tend}} to cluster into recognized styles, such as the first-person shooter (FPS), the real-time strategy game (RTS), the massively multiplayer online game (MMOG), and the platformer. A priori, the natural assumption is that these are similar to the sorts of genres with which we are familiar in other media: science fiction, the film musical, and so on. Yet game styles are defined by modalities of play, rather than thematic elements; perhaps they should be viewed as quite different from conventional notions of genre. Conventionally, genres are viewed as arising out of cultural conditions that make certain themes compelling to contemporaries. This paper argues that game styles, by contrast, arise from the invention of a particular game mechanic or set of mechanics, and that when a game which introduces a new play style that others find compelling is introduced, it quickly spawns a whole category of games that build on and modify the original mechanics. In other words, game design advances by major innovative introduction of new game styles, followed by slow evolutionary changes in such styles. Indeed, this pattern can be viewed again and again from the earliest history of games. Examples include positional games with differentiated pieces (a category deriving from the ancient Indian game of Shaturanga, and including Chess, Shogi, and Stratego); tables games (deriving from the Royal Game of Ur, and including the Roman Tabula and the modern Backgammon); track games (deriving from The Royal <b>Game</b> <b>of</b> <b>Goose,</b> and including most of the popular commercial boardgames of the late 18 th and early 19 th centuries); the board wargame (deriving from Roberts’s Tactics); the tabletop RPG (Gygax & Arneson’s D&D); the trading card game (TCG) (Garfield’s Magic); the FPS (from id’s Castle Wolfenstein); the RTS (Westwood’s Dune 2); the MMO (from Bartle & Trubshaw’s MUD); etc. The fact that the pattern recurs over the entire history of games implies that this is no mere epiphenomenon of the current industry, but something fundamental about games: unlike other media, particular aspects of gameplay, rather than thematic elements, are what players find important and compelling. Moreover, since the advent of commercial games (in the mid- 18 th century, possibly with the publication of Jefferys 2 ̆ 7 s A Journey Through Europe in 1759), the discovery of a successful game style has invariably been linked to a commercial boom and an expanded audience. Consequently, one can argue that however difficult the development of a whole new game style may be in comparison to development of games of well-understood types, long term commercial success {{is more likely to be}} achieved by striving for innovation...|$|E

The <b>game</b> <b>of</b> Canada <b>goose</b> {{management}} {{is a complex}} issue, on one side, the hunters; on the other, the farmers. Government takes the field as referee.

Everyone thus plays the game. Hunters, farmers, and government; they all play the <b>game</b> <b>of</b> Canada <b>goose</b> management. Good rules would make for a good game. Unfortunately, the rules <b>of</b> Canada <b>goose</b> management are terrible. They make for a scrappy game. Hunters fight farmers. Farmers fight hunters.

40|$|Based on a {{corpus of}} texts {{that are used}} to teach {{seminars}} in translation into the foreign language, the present paper argues that for future translators good reading skills are almost as important as high-level proficiency in both languages. The corpus comprises texts that share a common topic (travelling) but differ in terms of genre, so that the specific characteristics of each text can be described in relation to the other component texts rather than to abstract text types included in text typologies. The exercises in the seminars, before actually starting to translate, aimed at reading a text at different levels, i. e. the text as a whole, its discursive dynamics, and its component parts, while trying to connect it to the other texts included in the corpus. The preparatory exploration of the source text as well as the actual process of translation can be conceptualized as the <b>Game</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Goose</b> (or Snakes and Ladders) : translators have to find their way through the text, taking advantage from short cuts and anticipating pitfalls they already know from past experiences...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a model-based approach for designing distributed user interfaces (DUIs), i. e. {{graphical user interfaces}} that are distributed along one or many of the following dimensions: end user, display device, computing platform, and physical environment. The three pillars of this model-based approach are: (i) a Concrete User Interface model for DUIs incorporating the distribution dimensions and able to express in a XML-compliant format any DUI element until the granularity of an individual DUI element is reached, (ii) a specification language for DUI distribution primitives that have been defined in a user interface toolkit, and (iii), a step-wise method for modeling a DUI based on the concepts of distribution graph expressing a distribution scenario that can be played namely based on the distribution primitives. A distribution graph consists of a state-transition diagram whose states represent significant distribution states of a DUI and whose transitions are labeled by an even-condition-action representation. The actions involved in this format may call any distribution primitive of the DUI toolkit. In order to exemplify this model-based approach, two simple DUIs are first designed: a DUI for the Pictionary game and a DUI for the Minesweeper game. They are then incorporated into a larger DUI <b>game</b> <b>of</b> the <b>goose</b> where cells may trigger the two other games...|$|R
