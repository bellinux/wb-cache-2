Beginning in 1996-97, the government has become increasingly active in helping the industrial sector to restore production through technical and financial assistance, including loan guarantees, economic liberalization, and the privatization of state-owned enterprises. In early 1998, the government set up a one-stop investment promotion center and implemented a new investment code that created an <b>enabling</b> <b>environment</b> for foreign and local investors. An autonomous revenue authority also has begun operation, improving collections and accountability.|$|E

40|$|Non-formal adult {{education}} and training (NFET) in South Africa was adopted in 1990 with the aim {{to respond to the}} learning needs of adults who {{do not have access to}} formal education; to increase their employment opportunities; to reduce the high rates of poverty in the country and to enhance social inclusion (Aitchison, 2007 : 2 - 4). The study was informed by a concern that graduates from NFET centres in KwaZulu-Natal continue being unemployed and excluded from the labour market. The goal of the study was to assess the <b>enabling</b> <b>environments</b> (internal and external) of non-formal {{adult education}} and training centres in enabling trainees’ employment and poverty reduction in KwaZulu-Natal. The researcher used the mixed methods research approach in conducting the study. Quantitative data was gathered through a survey and qualitative data by means of multiple-case studies and interviews. A total sample of 472 participants was drawn from 21 centres in four districts of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN). The study’s findings indicate that at micro-level, the internal training delivery environments are significantly effective in contributing to technical and business skills acquisition. At macro-level, the policies, regulations and institutional <b>environments</b> create external <b>enabling</b> <b>environments</b> to foster skills utilisation in the labour market. However, at meso-level (centre level), the weak institutional centre linkages result in graduates not having access to essential post-training support, community resources, public goods and services which could enable them to access employment in KwaZulu-Natal. The study concludes that NFET programmes can foster adult trainees’ employment if the centres create adequate linkages with external <b>enabling</b> <b>environments</b> for skills utilisation in the labour market in KwaZulu-Natal. Adult centres that focus on self-employment in income-generating activities are more likely to create external <b>enabling</b> <b>environments</b> in terms of formal and informal linkages with other stakeholders who provide post-training support to graduates. The study proposes an integrated framework for NFET centres to create the internal and external <b>enabling</b> <b>environments</b> for wage-employment and/or self-employment of NFET graduates in KwaZulu-Natal. To ensure that the adult NFET programmes lead to employment, a key recommendation from the study is that centre managers should establish strong institutional linkages with community leaders, public agencies and private sectors from the beginning of the training programmes.

An ecological framework is applied to organize the key elements of <b>enabling</b> <b>environments</b> for ASRH. At the individual level, strategies that are being implemented and seem promising are those that empower girls, build their individual assets, and create safe spaces. At the relationship level, strategies that are being implemented and seem promising include efforts to build parental support and communication as well as peer support networks. At the community level, strategies to engage men and boys and the wider community to transform gender and other social norms are being tested and may hold promise. Finally, at the broadest societal level, efforts to promote laws and policies that protect and promote human rights and address societal awareness about ASRH issues, including through mass media approaches, need to be considered...|$|R

40|$|Adult non-formal {{education}} and training (NFET) in South Africa was adopted in 1990 {{to address the problem}} of unemployment of non-educated and unskilled adults. Public and private NFET centres aim to meet the training needs of adults who were deprived of formal education that would foster access to opportunities for employment. The paper reports on a study conducted to investigate what constitutes NFET <b>enabling</b> <b>environments</b> for employment. The paper focuses on the approach of training delivery fostering labour market entry of graduates. The findings show that individual trainees who participated in private centres had a higher probability of being employed because of the creation of internal <b>enabling</b> <b>environments</b> for skills acquisition and focus on income-generating activities. The authors conclude that an integration of technical skills with business skills and ‘learning by earning’ is a potential training delivery approach enabling graduates to participate in economic activities.
