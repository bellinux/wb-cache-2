5|$|Slow-tight {{inhibition}} {{occurs when}} the initial enzyme–inhibitor complex EI undergoes <b>isomerisation</b> to a second more tightly held complex, EI*, but the overall inhibition process is reversible. This manifests itself as slowly increasing enzyme inhibition. Under these conditions, traditional Michaelis–Menten kinetics give a false value for Ki, which is time–dependent.

5|$|Unlike the organolithium compounds, the {{organometallic}} compounds of the heavier alkali metals are predominantly ionic. The application of organosodium compounds in chemistry {{is limited in}} part due to competition from organolithium compounds, which are commercially available and exhibit more convenient reactivity. The principal organosodium compound of commercial importance is sodium cyclopentadienide. Sodium tetraphenylborate can also be classified as an organosodium compound since in the solid state sodium is bound to the aryl groups. Organometallic compounds of the higher alkali metals are even more reactive than organosodium compounds and of limited utility. A notable reagent is Schlosser's base, a mixture of n-butyllithium and potassium tert-butoxide. This reagent reacts with propene to form the compound allylpotassium (KCH2CHCH2). cis-2-Butene and trans-2-butene equilibrate when in contact with alkali metals. Whereas <b>isomerisation</b> is fast with lithium and sodium, it is slow with the heavier alkali metals. The heavier alkali metals also favour the sterically congested conformation. Several crystal structures of organopotassium compounds have been reported, establishing that they, like the sodium compounds, are polymeric. Organosodium, organopotassium, organorubidium and organocaesium compounds are all mostly ionic and are insoluble (or nearly so) in nonpolar solvents.|$|E

The dark noise was estimated by a maximum-likelihood procedure from frequency-of-seeing data and compared with the dark light derived from increment-threshold functions. In both cone and rod vision, the estimated dark noise coincides with Poisson fluctuations of the estimated dark light if 17 % (best estimate) of λmax-quanta incident at the cornea produce excitations. At that fraction of quanta exciting, dark lights are equivalent to 112 <b>isomerisations</b> per sec in each foveal cone and 0. 011 <b>isomerisations</b> per sec in each rod. It is concluded that (1) the threshold performance of dark-adapted cone as well as rod vision can be consistently described as noise-limited, but not by postulating a multi-quantum coincidence requirement for single receptors; (2) die underlying intrinsic activity in both the cone and the rod system is light-like as regards correspondence between noise effect and background adaptation effect.

25|$|Many {{different}} geometric isomers of retinol, retinal and {{retinoic acid}} are possible {{as a result}} of either a trans or cis configuration of four of the five double bonds found in the polyene chain. The cis isomers are less stable and can readily convert to the all-trans configuration (as seen in the structure of all-trans-retinol shown here). Nevertheless, some cis isomers are found naturally and carry out essential functions. For example, the 11-cis-retinal isomer is the chromophore of rhodopsin, the vertebrate photoreceptor molecule. Rhodopsin is composed of the 11-cis-retinal covalently linked via a Schiff base to the opsin protein (either rod opsin or blue, red or green cone opsins). The process of vision relies on the light-induced <b>isomerisation</b> of the chromophore from 11-cis to all-trans resulting in a change of the conformation and activation of the photoreceptor molecule.

The decay dynamics to the ground state shows an oscillatory pattern that can be attributed to an out-of-plane rotation of the N 2 moiety.
