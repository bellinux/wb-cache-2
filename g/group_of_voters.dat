A 14-member list of candidates may also be submitted for the Croatian diaspora constituency, while a two-member list can be submitted for the ethnic-minority representatives. In each case, 500 endorsements are required for an election list to become valid. The lists may be supported by one or more political parties, or by a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>voters</b> as an independent list. No one may be a candidate on two or more lists simultaneously.|$|E
25|$|Although the countback {{method is}} {{designed}} to select a replacement representing the same <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>voters</b> who elected the original candidate, it remains possible that no similar candidates remain on the ballot. In 1985 the Tasmanian parliament amended the electoral act to allow true by-elections if no candidates of the same party as the outgoing representative remained on the ballot; in this circumstance the party may request that a by-election be held, however this has not yet happened as most political parties and community groups now nominate a surplus number of candidates in order to fill any casual vacancies.|$|E

2500|$|Increasing {{tension between}} the Liberal and Conservative {{coalition}} partners led the Liberal Party executive to vote to instruct Johnson to terminate the arrangement. Johnson ended the coalition and dropped his Conservative cabinet ministers, including Deputy Premier and Finance minister Herbert Anscomb, precipitating the general election of 1952. A referendum on electoral reform [...] prior to this election had instigated an elimination ballot (similar to a preferential ballot), where voters could select second and third choices. The intent of the ballot, as campaigned for by Liberals and Conservatives, was that their supporters would list the rival party {{in lieu of the}} CCF, but this plan backfired when a large <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>voters</b> from all major parties, including the CCF, voted for the fringe British Columbia Social Credit Party (Socreds), who wound up with the largest number of seats in the House (19), only one seat ahead of the CCF, despite the CCF having 34.3% of the vote to Social Credit's 30.18%.|$|E
2500|$|In effect, {{the method}} {{produces}} groups of voters of equal size {{that reflect the}} diversity of the electorate, each group having a representative the group voted for. [...] Some 90% of voters have a representative to whom they gave their first preference. [...] Voters can choose candidates using any criteria they wish, the proportionality is implicit. [...] Political parties are not necessary; all other prominent PR electoral systems presume that parties reflect voters wishes, which many believe gives power to parties. [...] STV satisfies the electoral system criterion proportionality for solid coalitions a solid coalition for a set of candidates is the <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>voters</b> that rank all those candidates above all others and is therefore considered a system of proportional representation. [...] However, the small district magnitude used in STV elections has been criticized as impairing proportionality, especially when more parties compete than there are seats available, and STV has, for this reason, sometimes been labelled [...] "quasi proportional". [...] While this may be true when considering districts in isolation, results [...] are proportional. [...] In Ireland, with particularly small magnitudes, results are [...] "highly proportional". [...] In 1997, the average magnitude was 4.0 but eight parties gained representation, four of them with less than 3% of first preference votes nationally. [...] Six independent candidates also won election. [...] STV has also been described as the [...] proportional system. [...] The system tends to handicap extreme candidates because, to gain preferences and so improve their chance of election, candidates need to canvass voters beyond their own circle of supporters, and so need to moderate their views. [...] Conversely, widely respected candidates can win election with relatively few first preferences by benefitting from strong subordinate preference support.|$|E
2500|$|Momentum {{shifted in}} Clinton's favor, and {{she won the}} popular vote in the Nevada caucuses eleven days later, despite Obama's {{endorsement}} from the influential Culinary Workers Union. However, Obama ran strongly in rural areas throughout the state and beat Clinton in the delegate count. Edwards's support collapsed in Nevada, as voters coalesced around the two apparent frontrunners. Dennis Kucinich withdrew from the race. In the following week, issues of race {{came to the fore}} as campaigning began for the South Carolina primary, the first to feature a large proportion of African Americans in the Democratic electorate. Behind in the state polls, Hillary Clinton left to campaign in some Super Tuesday states, while her husband, former president Bill Clinton, stayed in South Carolina and engaged in a series of exchanges with Obama. CBS News reported, [...] "By injecting himself into the Democratic primary campaign with a series of inflammatory and negative statements, Bill Clinton may have helped his wife's presidential hopes in the long term but at the cost of his reputation with a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>voters</b> [...] that have long been one of his strongest bases of political support." [...] Obama won by a more than two-to-one margin over Clinton, gaining 55% of the vote to her 27% and Edwards's 18%. The day of the primary, Bill Clinton compared Obama's expected win to Jesse Jackson's victory in the 1988 South Carolina primary. His comments were widely criticized as an apparent attempt to dismiss the primary results and marginalize Obama by implying that he was [...] "the black candidate." [...] The momentum generated by Obama's larger-than-expected win in South Carolina was deflated somewhat by the win Clinton claimed in the nullified Florida primary the following week. John Edwards suspended his candidacy on January 30. He did not immediately endorse either Clinton or Obama, but said they both had pledged to carry forward his central campaign theme of ending poverty in America. Neither Clinton nor Obama had a clear advantage heading into the February 5 Super Tuesday primaries, with 23 states and territories and 1,681 delegates at stake and more media attention than any primary election day in American history.|$|E

30|$|A {{comparison}} between the scenario with two <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>voters</b> (Lemma 1 and Corollary 1) and the present case (Lemma 2 and Corollary 2), shows that because in the current situation the non-ideological voters {{no longer have to}} worry about the ideological ones, those cases in which the existence of the latter class of agents obliged the former to carefully cast their vote, are now altered. We observe that this is the case when q̂< 1 / 2. Otherwise, all voters had a preference for the expansionary fiscal policy, so whether there is one or two <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>voters</b> is irrelevant for the results. Additionally, we observe that for the number <b>of</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>voters</b> to make a difference, we need that more than one candidate proposes the austerity policy. Otherwise, it is clear which candidate should non-ideological voters vote for. This means that the difference is to be found in the case (x_ 1,x_ 2)=(A,A) and q̂< 1 / 2. Here, we obtain that a coalition between the two mainstream candidates can now form. The reason is that with no votes for the third candidate, any voters’ voting strategy such that σ _ 4, 2 ^AA= 0 is a best response. This is in contrast to the scenario with two <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>voters,</b> where the coalition between the two mainstream candidates was not possible.|$|R

50|$|Result: With {{the votes}} of the first <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>voters,</b> A can defeat {{three of the four}} opponents, whereas no other {{candidate}} wins against more than two opponents. Thus, A is elected Copeland winner by the first <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>voters.</b>|$|E

40|$|Why do {{politicians}} redistribute resources through in-kind {{rather than}} cash transfers? This paper examines political incentives for in-kind government redistribution. By analyzing the political game between o¢ ce-motivated politicians and self-interested citizens, I �rst {{show that in}} economies with competitive markets in-kind transfers are not required. Politicians can win elections targeting <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>voters</b> with differential cash transfers. However, in-kind transfers arise {{in the presence of}} externalities in consumption. In that case, targeting <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>voters</b> with in-kind rather than cash transfers allows politicians to attract simultaneously voters in additional groups with the same amount of resources. Politicians undertake political redistribution depending on the expected electoral returns obtained from targeting both cash and in-kind transfers into di¤erent groups. Furthermore, electoral competition leads the economy to achieve Pareto efficient allocations that markets cannot reach. Politicians internalize the presence of external effects when competing for marginal voters who could swing their vote. ...|$|R

50|$|Advocates of {{cumulative}} voting often argue that political and racial minorities deserve better representation.
