500|$|SpongeBob SquarePants is Nickelodeon's first {{original}} Saturday-morning cartoon. It first aired as {{a preview}} on May1, 1999, and officially premiered on July17. Hillenburg {{noted that the}} show's premise [...] "is that innocence prevailswhich I don't think <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>does</b> in real life." [...] It has received positive reviews from critics, and has been noted for its appeal to different age groups. James Poniewozik of the Time magazine described the titular character as [...] "the anti-Bart Simpson, temperamentally and physically: his head is as squared-off and neat as Bart's is unruly, {{and he has a}} personality to matchconscientious, optimistic and blind to the faults in the world and those around him." [...] On the other hand, The New York Times critic Joyce Millman said that the show [...] "is clever without being impenetrable to young viewers and goofy without boring grown-ups to tears. It's the most charming toon on television, and one of the weirdest. ...Like Pee-wee's Playhouse, SpongeBob joyfully dances on the fine line between childhood and adulthood, guilelessness and camp, the warped and the sweet." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{amount of}} {{radioactive}} plutonium in the RTG is about one-third the amount {{on board the}} Cassiniâ€“Huygens probe when it launched in 1997. That Cassini launch was protested by some. The United States Department of Energy estimated {{the chances of a}} New Horizons launch accident that would release radiation into the atmosphere at 1 in 350, and monitored the launch as <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>does</b> when RTGs are involved. It was estimated that a worst-case scenario of total dispersal of on-board plutonium would spread the equivalent radiation of 80% the average annual dosage in North America from background radiation over an area with a radius of [...]|$|E

6000|$|But, as a guinea {{will not}} pass [...] At {{market for a}} farthing more, Shown through a {{multiplying}} glass, [...] Than what <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> before: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{not very}} lively, always going about with you. <b>It's</b> <b>always</b> <b>do</b> you love me, {{do you love}} me, till I just get about sick of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|Her lips had quivered; and Winton's heart softened, as <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> {{when he saw}} her moved. He put {{his hand}} out, covered one of hers, and said: ...|$|R
60|$|But {{the next}} day, {{in the course}} of Christmas morning, the {{situation}} straightened itself out, just as <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>does.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Better, dear boy, better"--("That's it, cheer up!" [...] from Slidder)--"and <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>does</b> me a {{world of}} good to see your {{handsome}} face." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear, dear Norland," [...] said Elinor, [...] "probably {{looks much}} as <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>does</b> {{at this time}} of the year. The woods and walks thickly covered with dead leaves." ...|$|E
60|$|Little Joe Otter {{looked over}} at the bank. He stared and stared, but he didn't see {{anything}} unusual. It looked just as <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>did.</b> He told Jerry Muskrat so.|$|R
5000|$|... "With the {{abundance}} of room and people scents available today, {{about the only thing}} that smells the same as <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> {{is the end of the}} nozzle at a gas pump." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Freeview {{was later}} expanded with additional facilities (Freeview+), high-definition channels (Freeview HD), and Internet connectivity (Freeview Play). All services remain available; the original Freeview equipment will work (unenhanced) {{in the same}} way <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>did.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have brought}} this gentleman {{to see your}} dairy, Hannah," [...] said Miss Halcombe. [...] "It {{is one of the}} sights of the house, and <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>does</b> you credit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no. Don't say that. I {{know all}} this Indian talk will blow over, as <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>does,</b> and you will come back and {{everything}} will be all right again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Such {{pleasant}} girls! I {{wish you}} knew them, Fan. So clever, and energetic, and kind, and happy, <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>does</b> me {{good to see}} them," [...] cried Polly, with a face full of enthusiasm.|$|E
6000|$|... "Neighbours!" [...] said Meg, her wrath {{beginning}} to arise, as <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> upon any allusion to this sore subject--"Ye may ca' them neighbours, if ye like--but the deil flee awa wi' the neighbourhood for Meg Dods!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{garden is}} different," [...] he declared. [...] "The earth changes from {{generation}} to generation, just as the flowers here throw out fresh blossoms and the weeds come and go. But my rooftree stands where <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>did.</b> Wait." ...|$|R
6000|$|The anger {{died out}} of <b>it</b> as <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> within the minute, and she laughed. [...] "It would be fun, wouldn't it. I wonder what I should do with him? It {{makes you feel}} very serious being in love, doesn't it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose it}} will come to that. <b>It</b> <b>always</b> <b>does</b> if the man is in earnest. Girls will accept men simply {{because they think it}} ill-natured to return the {{compliment}} of an offer with a hearty 'No.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{he replied}} to this question. [...] "The {{war is not}} yet over. But it soon will be, and it will end, as <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>does,</b> with the Westenders running away. We, the Eastenders, are always victorious." ...|$|E
6000|$|Kea's {{face grew}} pale with terror. [...] "You are," [...] she answered, [...] "I {{can see it}} rise. The bubbles are bursting; the steam's crackling. <b>It</b> <b>always</b> <b>does</b> so before it begins to flow out upon {{the slopes of the}} mountain." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think it}} {{necessary}} myself, but Aunt Lora <b>does,</b> so <b>it's</b> <b>always</b> <b>done.</b> <b>It</b> humours her, {{and it really}} isn't any trouble. Besides, {{it may be necessary}} after all. One never knows, and it's best {{to be on the safe}} side." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{need not}} trouble {{the reader with}} a {{detailed}} account of the means by which Jim Welton accomplished his object. Love prevailed--as <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>did,</b> <b>always</b> <b>does,</b> and <b>always</b> will--and ere many days had passed Billy Towler was once more a member of the drunkard's family, with the sweet presence of Nora ever near him, like an angel's wing overshadowing and protecting him from evil.|$|R
6000|$|The {{sight of}} her, as <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>did,</b> sent a thrill through him, {{but he was}} {{conscious}} of an ache behind it. He had hoped so much that Hank would pass, {{and he knew that}} he had not. Why was it that two people so completely one as Ruth and himself could not see Hank with the same eyes? ...|$|R
6000|$|Her mother {{forced herself}} to speak cheerfully. [...] "Aunt Geoffrey is a capital nurse," [...] said she; [...] "there is {{something}} so decided about her that <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>does</b> one good. It saves all the trouble and perplexity of thinking for oneself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Since he is {{safe with}} Fanny, I may venture to walk where I like. It 's such a lovely day, all the babies will be out, and <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>does</b> me {{good to see}} them," [...] thought Polly, turning into the wide, sunny street, where West End-dom promenaded at that hour.|$|E
60|$|When he woke {{it seemed}} even less {{attractive}} {{than it had}} done {{when he went to}} sleep. He had banged his head on the pillow six times over-night, and this silent alarm proved effective, as <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>does.</b> Reaching out a hand for his watch, he found that it was five minutes past six.|$|E
60|$|His father {{stood with}} his back to the fireplace, looking down upon the floor with his blind eyes, his brows drawn moodily together, and the scar of the great wound that he had {{received}} at the tournament at York--the wound that had made him blind--showing red across his forehead, as <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> when he was angered or troubled.|$|R
60|$|One {{evening in}} early harvest Estella was {{lingering}} by the lane gate at twilight. She had worked slavishly {{all day and}} was very tired, but she was loath {{to go into the}} house, where her trouble always seemed to weigh on her more heavily. The dusk, sweet night seemed to soothe her as <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>did.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{have a bit}} of {{corned beef}} and cabbage for dinner," [...] she said, [...] "and I'll make David that pudding he's so fond of. After all, it's kind of nice to have someone to plan and think for. <b>It</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> seem like a waste of energy to fuss over cooking things when there was nobody but myself to eat them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By Jove, <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>does</b> {{one good}} to hear you talk in that way, Campbell! One feels--I don't know--so much of a man when one is with you; not that I shan't take uncommonly good care of myself, old fellow; that is but fair: but as for running away, as I said, why--why--why I can't, and so I won't!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} is so," [...] said Bastin. [...] "At any rate I have noticed {{that it has been}} moping for the last two days, as <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>does</b> when she is not present. It even seems to like Oro who gives me the creeps, perhaps because he is her father. Dogs must be very {{charitable}} animals." ...|$|E
6000|$|... so that {{we should}} suspect {{that we might be}} conversing with an angel. Bread may not always nourish us; but <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>does</b> us good, it even takes {{stiffness}} out of our joints, and makes us supple and buoyant, when we knew not what ailed us, to recognize any generosity in man or Nature, to share any unmixed and heroic joy.|$|E
6000|$|We {{heard the}} sharp bell-peal {{which we all}} knew; then the rapid step {{familiar}} to each ear: the words [...] "VoilÃ  Monsieur!" [...] had scarcely broken simultaneously from every lip, when the two-leaved door split (as split <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> for his admission--such a slow word as [...] "open" [...] is inefficient to describe his movements), and {{he stood in the}} midst of us.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well,' said Bill, 'he's ugly enough. He looks fierce. If {{you want}} a dog, he's the sort of dog you want. But {{what do you want}} one for? It seems to me it's a lot of trouble to take, when there's no need of any trouble at all. Why not <b>do</b> what I've <b>always</b> wanted to <b>do?</b> What's wrong with just fixing the dog, same as <b>it's</b> <b>always</b> <b>done,</b> and walking in and helping yourself?' ...|$|R
60|$|That gentleman himself came in {{from the}} harvest field looking as courtly as usual, even in his rough working clothes. He shook hands heartily, told her he was glad to see her, and began talking about the weather. Esther was not to be turned from her object thus, {{although}} she felt her courage ebbing away from her as <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> {{in the presence of the}} Cropper imperviousness.|$|R
