But these are far from sufficient to meet investment needs, which is why loan financing is necessary.

40|$|In {{the early}} 1990 s public funds were {{initiated}} by <b>the</b> Swedish <b>government,</b> <b>channelled</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> County Administrative Boards, {{to encourage the}} establishment of Women Resource Centres (WRCs). Since then, WRCs {{all over the country}} have worked to increase women's participation in regional development. According to an earlier study, WRCs have systematically organized innovation systems at the local, regional and national level in Sweden by linking actors from different spheres of society around topics such as new technology, culture and service industry. 2 Gradually, the Swedish innovation system of WRCs has expanded internationally through funding from various European Union funds encouraging transnational cooperation. In 2006 the European association WINNET Europe was formed, gathering WRCs from 21 countries. In this paper, we set out to analyse how WRCs have organised an innovation system on the European level, gathering actors from different spheres of society encountering both support and resistance. We describe this process of internationalisation in the light of theories of innovation systems and triple helix. The questions we try to answer are: Which actors have been mobilised and what resistance and successes has been encountered? How might these factors be related to the ambition of gender mainstreaming in Sweden and EU?Godkänd; 2009; 20090609 (ysko...|$|R
50|$|Education for the {{ordinary}} people began in 1835 {{with the building}} of a free Sunday School at the junction with the lane to Hillgrove, using <b>government</b> money <b>channelled</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Church of England. in 1849 this was extended to become a Church of England day school, giving a free basic education in literacy and numeracy and having emphasis on religious indoctrination. By the early 20th century the building was considered inadequate by the County Council and the site unhealthy as they were pumping water from the sewage polluted stream. The clergy were unable to retain control by making the necessary improvements so a new council run school was built by the village green, opening in 1916, and still in use today as the primary school.|$|R

50|$|Particularly intense debate {{arose in}} the 1990s around the Oscar-winning The Shop on Main Street, which was jointly {{directed}} by one Budapest-born Jewish Slovak director (Ján Kadár) and one Czech director (Elmar Klos), based on a short story written in Czech by Jewish Slovak author Ladislav Grosman, financed by <b>the</b> central authorities <b>through</b> <b>the</b> films studio at Prague and shot on location in Slovakia in the Slovak language with Slovak actors. Czechs generally consider the film to be Czech (while they see the theme as Slovak) {{on the basis of}} the film's studio and the home of its directors; Slovaks generally consider the film to be Slovak on the basis of its language, themes, and filming locations, but some see it as Czech because the sound stage was at and the centrally-distributed <b>government</b> funding was <b>channeled</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Barrandov Film Studio in Prague.|$|R
40|$|Poland has {{recently}} begun reforming its tax program. In December 1999 it announced a gradual {{reduction in the}} corporate income tax rate, from 34 percent in 1999 to 22 percent in 2004. Value added and excise taxes are being harmonized with European Union directives, which means higher value added tax rates on unprocessed foodstuffs, municipal services, and construction material, and higher excise rates on tobacco and alcohol. The reform of personal income tax law has been delayed, because of concern about the fairness of a rate reduction for higher-income taxpayers and hesitation about the government's proposal to remove or scale down existing tax expenditure programs. Poland's personal income tax expenditure programs, introduced in 1992, have received growing attention {{as the cost of}} the programs has increased. Originally they were intended to compensate lower-income taxpayers for the withdrawal of price subsidies. But most of them are extremely regressive, benefiting higher-income taxpayers. Tax expenditures are reductions in tax liabilities that result from preferential provisions, such as deductions, exemptions, credits, deferrals, preferential tax rates, and exclusions from taxation. They are effective <b>government</b> spending <b>channeled</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> tax system, usually as substitutes for direct government spending to achieve fiscal and political objectives. The authors contend that strengthening the administration of Poland's tax expenditure programs {{is the first step toward}} making them effective and equitable, limiting their costs, and preventing the tax base from shrinking. They discuss options for increasing the scrutiny of the tax expenditure programs, defining their opportunity costs and effect on the tax system. Currently these programs enjoy a funding advantage over direct spending programs because they are not subject to systematic review. To limit the expansion of these programs and reduce their less desirable effects on the system, the authors suggest defining a benchmark tax structure, establishing sunset dates for the programs, forecasting their costs, and reviewing their economic effectiveness, efficiency, and equity by comparing them with direct expenditures and subsidies.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is submitted in partial {{fulfillment of}} the requirements for the degree of Masters in Procurement and Supply Management, 2015. Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 57). A handsome share of <b>government</b> expenditure is <b>channeled</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> annual development program (ADP) which normally undertakes numerous construction {{and other types of}} procurement activities <b>through</b> <b>the</b> implementation of development programs and projects. Government projects are undertaken <b>through</b> <b>the</b> involvement of a number of ministries, divisions and different implementing agencies with a long and vigorous approval process. During project preparation and implementation, procurement has a huge implication. The procurement system adopted by the government has also played a significant role on the efficiency and effectiveness of the project implementation. The reforms initiatives undertaken by the government in order to bring efficiency, economy and effectiveness in the public procurement system started in <b>the</b> year 2003 <b>through</b> <b>the</b> introduction of Public Procurement Regulations (PPR‟ 2003). To reinforce the improvement measures in the public procurement system, the House of the Nation enacted the much desired law, the Public Procurement Act „ 2006. Under the Act of 2006, the Public Procurement Rules 2008 was framed and issued which is now widely observed in all government purchase. The main issue {{of this study is to}} identify the factors that restricts for successful implementation of the project for the government projects that follow PPR with projects that are funded by international development partners that follow specific guidelines of the donor partners. To that end this study concentrates on a single project namely, “Karnaphuly Water Supply Project, phase- 1 ” project implemented by Chittagong Water Supply & Sewerage Authority. Project Challenges can be measured by assessing the performance of the project on some key measurable parameters. These parameters are – the cost of the project, the time of project implementation and construction quality. Since there is no way of measuring efficiency and effectiveness of the project directly, these three project parameters have been measured by conducting survey among the implementers of the project and interviewing the key informants. Those parameters then have been used to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of the project implementation and compared with other CWASA projects. Also to have an in depth knowledge of the project characteristics interview with the key informants‟ of the project was also conducted who provided valuable information about the project concerned and also the characteristic features of other projects. To assess the challenges of the project survey questionnaire has been developed focusing on the key performance indicators of the project namely, the cost, time and quality of the project construction. The inconsistency in following some of the provisions of PPR has added complexity in contract approval and management of the project which resulted in delayed project implementation.
