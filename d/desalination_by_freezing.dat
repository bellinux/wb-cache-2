40|$|Fresh water {{shortage}} and hot weather are common challenges {{in many countries}} of the world. In the other hand, the air conditioning systems which are used for indoor cooling cause peak electricity demand during high temperatures hours. This peak hour demand is very important since it is more expensive and mainly is supplied by fossil fuel power plants with lower efficiencies compare to base load fossil fuel or renewable owe plants. Moreover, these peak electricity load fossil fuel power plants cause higher green house gas emission and other environmental effects. So, all these show that any solution for these problems could make life better in those countries {{and all over the}} world. In this thesis, a new idea for a Power storage, Cooling storage, and Water production Combined Cycle (PCWCC) is introduced and reviewed. PCWCC is combination of two thermal cycles, Ice Thermal Energy Storage (ITES) and <b>desalination</b> <b>by</b> <b>freezing</b> cycle, which are merged together to make a total solution for fresh {{water shortage}}, required cooling, and high peak power demand. ITES is a well known technology for shifting the electricity demand of cooling systems from peak hours to off-peak hours and <b>desalination</b> <b>by</b> <b>freezing</b> is a less known desalination system which is {{based on the fact that}} the ice crystals are pure and by freezing raw water and melting resulted ice crystals, pure water will be produced. These two systems have some common processes and equations and this thesis shows that by combining them the resulted PCWCC could be more efficient than each of them. In this thesis, the thermodynamic equations and efficiencies of each PCWCC sub-systems are analyzed and the resulted data are used in finding thermodynamics of PCWCC itself. Also, by using reMIND software, which uses Cplex to find the best combinations of input/output and related processes, the cost of produced fresh water and cooling from PCWCC is compared with total cost of fresh water and cooling produced by each sub-systems of PCWCC in three sample cities all over the world, Kerman, Dubai, and Texas. These cities are chosen since they have similar ambient temperature trend with different electricity and fresh water tariff's. The results show that, the PCWCC is economical where there is a significant electricity price difference between ice charging and ice melting hours, off-peak and peak hours, of the day or when the fresh water price is high compare to electricity price. The results also show that how the revenue from fresh water could cover the used electricity cost and make some income as well...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Research into ice {{crystallization}} processes is {{an important}} area of study. The desire to improve product quality and efficiency of processes involving ice crystallization in industries such as <b>desalination</b> <b>by</b> <b>freezing,</b> freeze drying, freeze concentration and freeze crystallization for food processing, requires insight into the ice growth mechanisms. More so, a novel technology called Eutectic Freeze Crystallization, where water is recovered {{in the form of}} ice, requires that ice crystals are of high purity as this directly determines the quality of the water obtained. During ice crystallization, ice growth mechanisms {{play an important role in}} determining the structure, size and morphology of ice which have an effect on separation processes and product purity. Heat and mass transfer play a fundamental role in ice growth processes as they affect the thermodynamics and kinetics of the crystallization process. Ice growth experiments were carried out in pure water, in 8. 4 wt% and 16. 8 wt% magnesium sulphate and in 8. 4 wt% sodium nitrate using a 10 x 5 x 31 mm test cell made of Plexi-glass®. The Colour Schlieren optical technique was used to conduct the experiments. This is because of its capability to map refractive index gradients related to either temperature or/and concentration gradients of the solution during crystal growth...|$|E
40|$|The {{environment}} of cold regions is generally viewed as inhospitable, primarily [...] due to application of ideal processes and techniques suitable to temperate [...] zones. The work herein {{is a step}} toward solving two environmental problems. [...] The first involves the supply of inexpensive, potable water in Arctic regions, [...] the lack {{of which is a}} severe detriment to development. Although water does [...] exist in the Arctic, it is neither available in potable form during many months [...] of the year nor does it occur in sufficient quantity near the point of use. Principally, [...] this lack is caused by the aridness of the Arctic and the shallowness [...] of fresh water sources which, for all practical purposes, do not exist but [...] freeze completely each winter season. The remaining liquid water source is [...] the sea. Arctic problems are then similar to other arid regions where the [...] conversion of sea water to potable water or the transmission of potable water [...] to desired locations is necessary. Cold temperatures generally preclude [...] transmission except over very short distances. [...] <b>Desalination</b> <b>by</b> <b>freezing</b> sea water is a much reported process and has been [...] included among the desalination processes under study worldwide. The [...] advantage of this method in the Arctic is the cold winter-time temperature [...] for freezing and the existence of adequate solar energy in the summer for [...] melting self purified ice. Power requirements are greatly reduced using these [...] natural phenomena. [...] The second aspect of this study concerns the use of artificially grown sea ice [...] as a structural material, thinking primarily in terms of coastal facilities such [...] as docks, jetties, islands, platforms, etc. At sufficiently high latitudes, the [...] summer ablation can be controlled to the point where major structures can be [...] maintained intact during the summer. The unit cost of material is quite low [...] because of low energy requirements. [...] The results of this study show that each of these sea water uses have considerable [...] promise. Desalination to potable level was accomplished. Ice growth [...] rates were obtained which indicate that ice structures of substantial size can [...] be built...|$|E

Upon transferring charge from one electrode to the other, ions are removed from the feedwater by electrosorption into electrical double layers (EDLs) within the micropores of the porous carbon. When using electrodes containing fixed chemical charge in the micropores, various counterintuitive observations have been made, such as "inverted CDI" where upon charging, ions are released from the electrode, and the feedwater is only desalinated when the cell is discharging. We set up an EDL model including chemical charge that explains these observations and makes predictions for a working range of enhanced <b>desalination</b> <b>by</b> CDI...|$|R

Demonstrated by both experimental and simulation studies, the developed ZIF membranes show high desalination performances attributing to the small pore size of the ZIF membranes, which is exactly in between the size of water molecules and hydrated ions. The ZIF membranes show a high stability in seawater. At 25, 50, 75 and 100 degrees C, the water fluxes through the ZIF- 8 membrane are 5. 8, 8. 1, 10. 8, and 13. 5 kg/(m(2). h), respectively, with a high ion rejection of over 99. 8 %, which is promising for seawater <b>desalination</b> <b>by</b> ionic sieving.

40|$|Although {{industrial}} osmotic {{processes are}} {{often referred to}} as ‘novel’, the possibility for osmotic power generation has been suggested as early as the 1970 s. Today forward osmosis is attracting significant interest and this interest has resulted in intensive research. Forward osmosis has been suggested as viable separation process, with numerous potential applications – from osmotic drug delivery and concentration of liquid foods to water purification and re-use in space. Particularly interesting is the possibility of seawater <b>desalination</b> <b>by</b> forward osmosis, as the process is claimed to require little or no pre-treatment of the feed water, due to minor membrane fouling. This alone is a significant advantage over reverse osmosis. Within the oil and gas sector, research conducted {{in the last couple of}} years shows that low salinity waterflooding can result in enhanced oil recovery, and therefore the industry is searching for new possibilities for off-shore based production of low salinity water. Due to the fact that forward osmosis operates at atmospheric pressure and requires no pressure vessels, the process can be utilized for seawater desalination where low overall equipment weight is required – off-shore oil platforms for example. This thesis is focused on the development of membranes for water <b>desalination</b> <b>by</b> forward osmosis, and estimation of the requirements (approximate membrane area and volume) for seawater <b>desalination</b> <b>by</b> a two-stage membrane based forward osmosis – nanofiltration process.

An important step is to choose the best option among different freezing methods. To approach the complex problem of damage produced in tissues <b>by</b> <b>freezing,</b> in this paper we present the classical mechanics approach and a quantitative study making use of a fractal methodology (evaluation of fractal dimension by box-counting method).
