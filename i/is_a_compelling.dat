25|$|Muslims are {{commanded}} {{to perform}} prayers {{five times a}} day. These prayers are obligatory on every Muslim who has {{reached the age of}} puberty, with the exception being those who are mentally ill, too physically ill for it to be possible, menstruating, or experiencing postnatal bleeding. Those who are ill or otherwise physically unable to offer their prayers in the traditional form are permitted to offer their prayers while sitting or lying, as they are able. The five prayers are each assigned to certain prescribed times (al waqt) at which they must be performed, unless there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>compelling</b> reason {{for not being able to}} perform them on time. These times are measured according to the movement of the sun. These are: near dawn (fajr), after midday has passed and the sun starts to tilt downwards/noon (zuhr), in the afternoon (asr), just after sunset (maghrib) and around nightfall (Isha). Under some circumstances ritual worship can be shortened or combined (according to prescribed procedures). In case a ritual worship is not performed at the right time, it must be performed later.|$|E
500|$|However, the Court also said: [...] "Where there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>compelling</b> reason which {{indicates}} {{the absence of such}} a public element in what is nonetheless a statutory power or duty, there would be no good reason to subject the exercise of such a power or duty, which may already be governed by private law obligations and remedies, to public law remedies in judicial review proceedings." ...|$|E

New York magazine wrote: [...] "Ethan Hawke's Hotspur... <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>compelling,</b> ardent creation." [...] Ben Brantley of the New York Times reported that Hawke's interpretation of Hotspur might be [...] "too contemporary for some tastes," [...] but allowed [...] "great {{fun to watch}} as he fumes and fulminates." [...] In 2005 Hawke starred in the Off-Broadway revival of David Rabe's dark comedy Hurlyburly. New York Times critic Brantley praised Hawke's performance as the central character Eddie, reporting that [...] "he captures with merciless precision {{the sense of a}} sharp mind turning flaccid". The performance earned Hawke a Lucille Lortel Award nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor.|$|E
500|$|Greil Marcus {{highlighted}} {{the importance of}} disregarding one's initial reading of the song. [...] "The first impression is that Bob Dylan is setting up the usual private scene: 'I'll sit here and watch the river flow.' Well, that's certainly a boring idea. It's the implicit message of just about everything James Taylor has ever written". He went on to describe how Dylan explores the difficulty of retaining privacy while making public art; the singer is {{coming to terms with}} unwanted attention inherent in stardom, without giving up his connection to his fans. Marcus argued that the reason the single was not a hit in the US was because [...] "the time has passed when people are interested in hearing Bob Dylan say he'll just sit there and watch the river flow... even though that's not quite what he's saying". For Marcus, [...] "Watching the River Flow" [...] <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>compelling</b> work, but the subtlety of the song may have prevented it from reaching a wide audience.|$|E

Chris Richards of The Washington Post claimed the album's [...] "overproduction is apparent on the chorus of the album's first single, [...] "7 Things," [...] an avalanche of guitars and rushed syllables."

2500|$|Public {{universities}} {{and other public}} {{institutions of higher education}} across the nation are now allowed to use race as a plus factor in determining whether a student should be admitted.

O'Connor's opinion answers the question for the time being as to whether [...] "diversity" [...] in higher education <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>compelling</b> governmental interest.

2500|$|The Supreme Court {{decided a}} {{challenge}} to the University of Texas at Austin's admission policy, Fisher v. University of Texas, in June 2013.
