5|$|Temple Israel has had {{a number}} of long-tenured rabbis who were {{influential}} both in the congregation and in the larger Dayton community. These have included David Lefkowitz (1900–1920), Louis Witt (1927–1947), Selwyn Ruslander (1947–1969) and P. Irving Bloom (1973–1997). , the rabbis were <b>David</b> <b>M.</b> Sofian and Karen Bodney-Halasz.|$|E
5|$|<b>David</b> <b>M.</b> Sofian joined as Rabbi in 2003. A {{graduate}} of Hebrew Union College and the University of Missouri, Sofian {{had served as}} assistant rabbi at Temple Emanuel in Worcester, Massachusetts, at Temple Shaarai Shomayim in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and at Emanuel Congregation in Chicago, before coming to Temple Israel. Karen Bodney-Halasz, a {{graduate of}} Northwestern University, joined as Religious School Director in 2003 and became Director of Education in 2005. After her rabbinic ordination in June 2007, she became Rabbi-Educator.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, paleontologists <b>David</b> <b>M.</b> Raup and Jack Sepkoski {{suggested}} that extinction events on Earth followed a periodic trend.

Muller was already involved in the automated supernova searches underway at Leuschner, and began the search for Nemesis using the optical telescopes at Leuschner Observatory.|$|E

As part of the deal, Southwest Sports Group assumed part-ownership of both the team and the ballpark to be built following the 2002 season.

5|$|To {{build up}} the {{theoretical}} physics department at the University of Michigan, Randall recruited four distinguished young physicists to work at Ann Arbor in 1927: Otto Laporte, George Uhlenbeck, Samuel Goudsmit, and <b>David</b> <b>M.</b> Dennison. The University of Michigan {{was no longer a}} backwater in theoretical physics. Bacher immediately signed up for Goudsmit's course on atomic structure. With Goudsmit he investigated the Zeeman effect of hyperfine structure of atomic levels, which became the subject of his 1930 PhD thesis.|$|E
5|$|In April 1945, Marshall asked Groves to {{nominate}} specific targets for bombing for final approval {{by himself and}} Stimson. Groves formed a Target Committee, chaired by himself, that included Farrell, Major John A. Derry, Colonel William P. Fisher, Joyce C. Stearns and <b>David</b> <b>M.</b> Dennison from the USAAF; and scientists John von Neumann, Robert R. Wilson and William Penney from the Manhattan Project. The Target Committee met in Washington on April 27; at Los Alamos on May 10, where {{it was able to}} talk to the scientists and technicians there; and finally in Washington on May 28, where it was briefed by Tibbets and Commander Frederick Ashworth from Project Alberta, and the Manhattan Project's scientific advisor, Richard C.

5|$|In the 1970s Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge {{proposed}} {{the theory of}} punctuated equilibrium which holds that stasis is the most prominent feature of the fossil record, and that most evolutionary changes occur rapidly over relatively short periods of time. In 1980 Luis Alvarez and Walter Alvarez {{proposed the}} hypothesis that an impact event {{was responsible for the}} Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. Also in the early 1980s, statistical analysis of the fossil record of marine organisms published by Jack Sepkoski and <b>David</b> <b>M.</b> Raup led to a better appreciation of the importance of mass extinction events to the history of life on earth.|$|E
5|$|The Green Library is FIU's main library, and is {{the largest}} {{building}} on campus, {{and one of the}} largest library buildings in the Southeastern United States. Originally designed by Architect <b>David</b> <b>M.</b> Harper in 1973, the Green Library was expanded by the architecture firm M. C. Harry & Associates, Inc. in the early 1990s to its current eight floors, with a capacity to expand to a total of 15 floors if necessary. The eight-floor structure was built over, through, and around the original three-story library while it was still in use.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by <b>David</b> <b>M.</b> Stern and {{directed}} by Neil Affleck. The revelation of Ned's age was heavily debated between the Simpsons staff, and the decision to make him 60 years old could have been inspired from a joke by Simpsons writer Ron Hauge. A scene in the episode features the song Viva Las Vegas by Elvis Presley, although the staff originally wanted {{a version of the}} song performed by Bruce Springsteen. The Moody Blues guest-starred as themselves in the episode, and the episode marked the first appearance of the cocktail waitresses Amber and Ginger, who were voiced by Pamela Hayden and Tress MacNeille respectively.|$|E

5|$|After 1935, {{the mines}} were reopened {{and there was}} steady growth in the region. According to <b>David</b> <b>M.</b> Gordon, the unrest gave missionaries {{a chance to respond}} to the Watchtower {{movement}} in a coordinated fashion. The London Missionary Society and the Church of Scotland worked together after the strike, saying that the lack of education and religious instruction were contributing factors. The missionaries and the mining companies said that a Christian education would create a disciplined workforce, a belief which was called the spiritual wing of industrial capitalism. The region's Protestant mission established the United Mission of Copperbelt (UMCB), which led to the establishment of Protestant bodies such as the Church of Central Africa in Rhodesia (CCAR) in 1945 and the United Church of Central Africa in Rhodesia in 1958 (which became the United Church of Zambia in 1965).|$|E
5|$|Attempts {{to catalog}} Atlantic hurricanes {{in the first}} half of the 19th century began as early as 1855, when Andrés Poey {{compiled}} information on just over 400 tropical cyclones from 1493 to 1855. Poey's work serves as the basis for much of what is currently known about historical Atlantic tropical cyclones. He identified four distinct tropical systems that developed in 1842 (six events are listed, though two concern the same storm), plus another in November that was later deemed extratropical in nature. In his 1963 book, Early American Hurricanes, 1492–1870, weather researcher <b>David</b> <b>M.</b> Ludlum discussed, in greater detail, six significant tropical cyclones that impacted the United States in 1842. As the season falls outside the scope of the Atlantic hurricane database (1851 onward) and its associated reanalysis project, records are regarded as incomplete.|$|E
5|$|In 1950 North Korea invaded South Korea, {{prompting}} the United States {{to intervene in}} the name of the United Nations. President Harry S. Truman was caught off guard when the invasion struck, but quickly ordered U.S. Forces stationed in Japan into South Korea. Truman also sent U.S. based troops, tanks, fighter and bomber aircraft, and a strong naval force to Korea to support the Republic of Korea. As part of the naval mobilization New Jersey was recalled from the mothball fleet to provide seaborne artillery support for U.N. and South Korean troops. New Jersey was recommissioned at Bayonne on 21 November 1950, Captain <b>David</b> <b>M.</b> Tyree in command, and proceeded to the Caribbean, where she welded her crew into an efficient body which would meet the demanding requirements of the Korean War. She sailed from Norfolk, Virginia 16 April 1951 and arrived from Japan off the east coast of Korea 17 May. Vice Admiral Harold M. Martin, commanding the United States Seventh Fleet, placed his flag in New Jersey for the next six months.|$|E
