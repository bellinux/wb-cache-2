5|$|Noether's paper, Idealtheorie in Ringbereichen (Theory of <b>Ideals</b> in Ring Domains, 1921), is the {{foundation}} of general commutative ring theory, and gives one of the first general definitions of a commutative ring. Before her paper, most results in commutative algebra were restricted to special examples of commutative rings, such as polynomial rings over fields or rings of algebraic integers. Noether proved that in a ring which satisfies the ascending chain condition on <b>ideals,</b> every ideal is finitely generated. In 1943, French mathematician Claude Chevalley coined the term, Noetherian ring, to describe this property. A major result in Noether's 1921 paper is the Lasker–Noether theorem, which extends Lasker's theorem on the primary decomposition of <b>ideals</b> of polynomial rings to all Noetherian rings. The Lasker–Noether theorem {{can be viewed as a}} generalization of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic which states that any positive integer can be expressed as a product of prime numbers, and that this decomposition is unique.|$|E
