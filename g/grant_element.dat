It begins with a simple choice model where individuals decide to pursue post-secondary studies if i) the net benefits of doing so are positive and ii) no financing or liquidity constraints stand in their way. The effects of loans and grants on these two elements of the schooling decision are then discussed. It is argued that based on equity, efficiency, and fiscal considerations, loans are generally best suited for helping {{those who want to}} go but face financing constraints, whereas grants are more appropriate for increasing the incentives for individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds to further their studies. Loan subsidies, which make loans part-loan and part-grant, are also discussed, including how they might be used to address “debt aversion”.

SPNHF, working in close partnership with the Center for Land Conservation Assistance, conducted research into available mechanisms and funding sources for municipal conservation efforts. A publication summarizing the available options and providing information and case studies from a variety of New Hampshire towns was produced. Saving Special Places – Community Funding for Land Conservation, was distributed in December of 2002, just in time to assist towns seeking new municipal funding sources at the 2003 town meeting season. SPNHF/CLCA also provided a series of educational workshops on the topic of municipal fund raising for permanent land conservation. Eight workshops were held in the New Hampshire estuaries area, and seven were presented to at statewide events. Over 400 people attended the workshops. SPNHF/CLCA also provided technical assistance to twenty-four of the communities in the estuaries area over the period of the <b>grant.</b> <b>Elements</b> of the project were publicized {{in a wide range of}} print media in both statewide and estuary-area outlets. The education and outreach effort was quite successful. The number of towns applying land use change land monies to their conservation funds increased, as did the percent of the fund applied. The towns in the estuaries area that had the advantage of the new publication just as they were going into town meeting season with bond proposals in 2003 passed their bonds at a rate of 76 % for a total of $ 18, 660, 000 of new money available for conservation projects in those towns. Past the term of the grant, additional towns will be voting on increasing the amount of money from the Land Use Change Tax going to their conservation funds in 2004. Eight more towns in the estuaries area are considering open space bond proposals for the 2004 town meeting season, for a possible total of $ 19, 600, 000 in new funds for permanent land conservation. The coming challenge for the New Hampshire land conservation community will be to encourage the towns with these new sources of money to invest it wisely.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the record of}} the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development (KFAED) in light of changing fashions regarding the proper role and management of such funds in the development finance process. The key questions addressed are whether its concessional aid is allocated according to Donor Interest (DI) or Recipient Needs (RN), what precisely is the <b>grant</b> <b>element</b> in KFAED loans, whether this grant allocation is consistent with the fund's stated policy and if it is linked to {{one or more of the}} currently held views regarding how aid should be allocated in order to be most effective - to overcome the "two gaps," to strengthen institutions and governance or to reward/incentivize effective macroeconomic management. The KFAED is an interesting and important subject of study for many reasons. After Saudi Arabia, Kuwait is the second largest Arab aid donor, having contributed a total of more than $ 18. 5 billion between 1960 and 2002. It was the first to officially establish a bilateral aid institution: KFAED, which purports to be free of mercantilist motives as its aid is not tied to procurement, as is the case with most developed countries' aid institutions. The thesis consists of three mutually dependent sections. The first surveys the domain of theoretical and empirical development economics since World War II. It reviews its evolution over time, linking successes and failures in development aid to the refinement of macroeconomic points of view among various schools of thought. Since the implementation of any economic policy is highly sensitive to the political goals of the policy makers, we show that the evolution of macroeconomic theory is not, in itself, able to account for Kuwait Foundation for the Advancement of the Science's partial funding of this research, under grant 2005 - 12 - 01, is acknowledged. changes in the pattern of development aid. "Fashions" in such aid reflect not only the past history of aid itself, but also the histories of the donor nations or their multi-lateral vehicles. Our specific interest in regional Arab geopolitical development is contextualized in order to trace the effects of development theory evolution on the Middle Eastern region. (cont.) The second section studies the aid allocation of the KFAED. It seeks to determine, among other things, whether the allocation of aid reflects recipient needs or donor interest. We modeled the allocation decision as a two-stage process: selection and allocation. The empirical analysis demonstrates that income, ethnicity, religion and politics are all factors in the selection stage. Arab, Muslims countries and more populous countries receive a higher share of the total aid allocated (allocation stage). The third section extends the second by adding the third stage: <b>grant</b> <b>element</b> determination. It addresses two questions: how <b>grant</b> <b>element</b> is calculated and what factors influence its allocations. In addressing the first question, we offer a rationale for an adjusted discount rate in calculating <b>grant</b> <b>element</b> [...] the percentages of subsidy embedded in the loan. When this rate is applied, the results point to consistent overestimation of the traditionally published <b>grant</b> <b>element</b> statistics. We then examine the <b>grant</b> <b>element</b> allocation. We find that the actual allocation is quite different than that implied by the stated policy of the KFAED. Chief among the sources of variation are political factors, income and sectors. Finally, we test to see if the current <b>grant</b> <b>element</b> allocation is in line with any of the three views regarding how aid should be allocated: the two gap, macroeconomic management, and governance and institutions building. We find that it is weakly related to the two-gap view, but appears to bear no relation to the other two. by Sulaiman Ahmed Al-Jassar. Thesis (Ph. D.)
