For example, Benson postulates that Hemingway used his experiences and drew them out with [...] "what if" [...] scenarios: [...] "what if I were wounded {{in such a way}} that I could not sleep at night? What if I were wounded and made crazy, what would happen if I were sent back to the front?" [...] Writing in [...] "The Art of the Short Story", Hemingway explains: [...] "A few things I have found to be true. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>leave</b> out important things or events that you know about, the story is strengthened. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>leave</b> or skip something because you do not know it, the story will be worthless. The test of any story is how very good the stuff that you, not your editors, omit." ...|$|E

More seriously, the segment alarmed Tanen and other studio executives, who perceived it as racist and warned that [...] "'black people in America are going to rip the seats out of theaters <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>leave</b> that scene in the movie.'" [...] Richard Pryor's approval helped retain the segment in the film. The studio became more enthusiastic about the film when Reitman showed executives and sales managers of various regions in the country a 10-minute production reel that was put together in two days. The reaction was positive and the studio sent 20 copies out to exhibitors. The first preview screening for Animal House was held in Denver four months before it opened nationwide. The crowd loved it and the filmmakers realized they had a potential hit on their hands.|$|E

Reason can take over later. I had a ball!" [...] Sonia Chopra of Sify gave it 3 out of 5, and mentioned, [...] "Debut director Karan Malhotra shows great promise in making the film visually arresting and maintaining the consistency of performances. But remaking a cult film means you have big shoes to fill. If you’re a loyalist of the late Mukul Anand’s Agneepath, you’re likely to have reservations with this one. But <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>leave</b> the comparisons aside and are willing to forgive the faults, Agneepath is worth a watch essentially to savor Hrithik’s performance." [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave Agneepath 3 out of 5 and said, [...] "It is in the end, an old-fashioned revenge drama treated in that melodramatic, over-the-top style. You're not likely to be bored by the intense action and the solid performances, but prepare to be exhausted by just how long this film plays on." ...|$|E
