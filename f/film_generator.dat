Maddin began the project in 2012 in Paris, France, shooting footage for 18 films at the Centre Georges Pompidou (this installation was titled Spiritismes, the French word for “seances,” leading to press confusion about the project title) and continued shooting footage for an additional 12 films at the Phi Centre in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The Paris and Montreal shoots each took three weeks, with Maddin completing one short film of approximately 15-20 minutes each day. The shoots were also presented as art installation projects, during which Maddin, along with the cast and crew, held a “séance” during which Maddin [...] "invited {{the spirit of a}} lost photoplay to possess them." ...|$|E

The overall {{size of the}} thin <b>film</b> thermoelectric <b>generators,</b> which consist of 7 pairs of legs connected by aluminum electrodes, is 20 mm by 15 mm. Each leg is 15 mm long, 1 mm wide and 1 μm thick. We measure the output voltage and estimate the maximum output power near room temperature {{as a function of}} the temperature difference between hot and cold junctions of the thin <b>film</b> thermoelectric <b>generators.</b> In order to improve the performance of the generators, a hydrogen annealing process is carried out at several temperatures from 25 oC to 250 oC. The highest output voltage of 83. 3 mV and estimated output power of 0. 21 μW are obtained from a hydrogen annealing temperature of Ta = 250 oC and a temperature difference of ΔT = 30 K. The hydrogen annealing temperature of Ta = 250 oC also results in the best electrical performance for both p-type thin film (Seebeck coefficient = 254. 4 μV/K, resistivity = 4. 1 mΩ cm, power factor = 15. 9 μW/cm K 2) and n-type thin film (- 179. 3 μV/K, 1. 5 mΩ cm, 21. 5 μW/cm K 2) ...|$|R

An energy harvester on a single thin flexible plastic substrate enables high output performance (output voltage of 10  V and output current of 0.6  μA) for operating self-powered wireless data transmissions has been achieved [11], but still not in megawatt level [12, 13].|$|E
40|$|The {{great need}} for cooling {{combined}} with Mexico's large availability of low enthalpy energy from non conventional energy {{resources such as}} geothermal energy, solar heat and waste heat from industrial processes, makes it very attractive to utilize these resources for cooling using heat driven absorption systems. The main purpose of the work described in this thesis is to obtain experimental and theoretical data on heat driven absorption cooling systems {{for the design of}} large scale systems. Thermodynamic design data have been theoretically derived for heat driven absorption heat pumps and heat transformers using the working pairs ammonia-water and ammonia-lithium nitrate for cooling, heating and simultaneous heating and cooling. The interaction between the operating parameters has been illustrated graphically. A computer model of the steady state thermodynamics of a heat driven ammonia-water system and an ammonia-lithium nitrate system has been developed. A comparison of both systems is made by assessing the effect of operating temperatures and heat exchanger effectiveness on the coefficient of performance for cooling and the heat transfer rates within the system. An experimental study on the performance of the absorber of an absorption cooling system operating on water-lithium bromide has been made. The experimental study of the adiabatic absorber was concerned with the determination of the effect of the evaporator heat load and the absorber reflux on the performance of the absorber. An experimental study of the operating characteristics of an experimental. absorption cooler using water-lithium bromide-lithium iodide and waterlithium bromide-zinc bromide as ternary systems has been made in order to achieve higher coefficients of performance and a lower risk of crystallization. Experimental studies with a small heat driven absorption cooling system operating on ammonia-water using a falling <b>film</b> <b>generator</b> were made. Low generator temperatures were achieved which will'enable the use of non focussing solar collectors as a heat source for the system. An ammonia-water absorption cooler operating on low enthalpy geothermal energy was installed and operated at two geothermal fields. The system was used to cool a small cold storage facility below freezing temperatures. The experimental and theoretical results on absorption cooling systems will provide a basis for the design of heat pump systems for industrial and commercial applications...|$|E
40|$|A fabric based {{thermoelectric}} generator with great wearability would overcome the wearable difficulty of existing organic <b>film</b> <b>generators,</b> which shows promising application in flexible and wearable self powered electronic systems by harvesting body heat to generate electricity. However, to fabricate a wearable fabric {{thermoelectric generator}}, yarns with thermoelectric function are indispensable components, since yarns {{are the basic}} composition units of fabric structures, {{which can be treated}} as thermoelectric legs in a fabric thermoelectric generator. Thus, to give thermoelectric function to yarns, a new water-processable thermoelectric coating material made of waterborne polyurethane, MWCNT and PEDOT:PSS composite was developed. The thermoelectric properties of the composite with different constituents were investigated. The optimal electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient could achieve similar to 13826 S/m and similar to 10 mu V/K at room temperature respectively, resulting in a power factor of similar to 1. 41 mu W m(- 1) K- 2. In the following coating experiment, the fabricated composite was successfully coated on commercial cotton and polyester yarns respectively. Compared with the staple cotton yarn, the long continuous polyester filament exhibiting better coating layer is more suitable as coating substrate.

40|$|Aeroengine bearing {{chambers}} typically contain bearings, seals, shafts and static parts. Oil {{is introduced}} for lubrication and cooling and {{this creates a}} two phase flow environment that may contain droplets, mist, film, ligaments, froth or foam and liquid pools. Efficient and effective liquid removal from a bearing chamber is a functional requirement {{and in recent years}} the University of Nottingham Technology Centre in Gas Turbine Transmission Systems has been conducting an experimental and computational research program one strand of which is investigating bearing chamber off-take flows. Initial investigations focussed on a chamber where there was a relatively deep pocket for oil collection below the chamber [1, 2]. In more recent studies Chandra et al have investigated a shallower geometry [3]. In both sets of studies, chamber residence volume and wall film thickness data have been obtained for a range of shaft speeds, scavenge ratios and liquid supply rates. Two methods of introducing liquid to the chamber have been used: a <b>film</b> <b>generator</b> that puts liquid directly onto the chamber wall and a droplet inlet system that distributes droplets from the rotating shaft. During some of the previous investigations, visual data relating to the two phase flow in the outlet pipe immediately below the chamber was gathered together with data from pressure transducers one located in this pipe and one on the chamber itself. It has been observed that for some parameter combinations the chamber flow is gravity dominated whereas for others (typically at higher shaft speeds) the flow is shear dominated. During transition between regimes a pressure spike on the pipe pressure transducer is observed and this may be linked to a change in two phase flow regime within the outlet pipe. A study by Baker et al [4] on transient effects in gas-liquid separation has shown pressure spikes during transitions to new equilibrium conditions for two-phase pipe flow where the gas flow rate is suddenly increased. In this paper outlet visualisation, chamber visualisation and pressure data are combined and conclusions are drawn relating to the parameters controlling whether shear or gravity dominate. The effect of the chamber flow regime on the outlet flow regime is assessed and presented. An implication of the analysis is that during transitional conditions a bearing chamber may contain a different quantity of liquid than in steady state conditions...|$|E
40|$|Thin {{films of}} p- and n- type organic {{semiconductors}} for thermo-electrical (TE) applications {{are produced by}} doping of tetrathiotetracene (TTT). To obtain p-type material TTT is doped with iodine during vacuum deposition of thin films or by post-deposition doping using controlled exposure to iodine vapors. Thermal co-deposition in vacuum of TTT and TCNQ is used to prepare n-type thin films. The attained thin films are characterized by measurements of Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity. Seebeck coefficient and conductivity could be varied by altering the doping level. P-type TTT:iodide thin films with a power factor of 0. 52 μWm- 1 K- 2, electrical conductivity of 130 S m- 1 and Seebeck coefficient of 63 μV K- 1 and n-type TCNQ:TTT films with power factor of 0. 33 μWm- 1 K- 2, electrical conductivity of 57 S m- 1 and Seebeck coefficient of - 75 μV K- 1 are produced.

40|$|We have {{observed}} that a rotating liquid soap film generates electricity when placed between two non-contact electrodes with a sufficiently large potential difference. In our experiments suspended liquid film (water + soap film) is formed {{on the surface of}} a circular frame, which is forced to rotate in the $x-y$ horizontal plane by a motor. This system is located at the center of two capacitor-like vertical plates to apply an external electric voltage difference in the $x-$direction. The produced electric current is collected from the liquid film using two conducting electrodes that are separated in the $y-$direction. We previously reported that a liquid film in an external electric field rotates when an electric current passes through it, naming it the liquid film motor (LFM). In this paper we report a novel technique, in which a similar device can be used as an electric generator, converting the rotating mechanical energy to electrical energy. The liquid <b>film</b> electric <b>generator</b> (LFEG) is {{in stark contrast to the}} LFM, both of which could be designed similarly in very small scales like micro scales with different applications. Although the device is comparable to commercial electric motors or electric generators, there is a significant difference in their working principles. Usually in an electric motor or generator the magnetic field causes the driving force, while in a LFM or LFEG the Coulomb force is the driving force. This fact is also interesting from the Bio-science point of view and brings a similarity to bio motors. Here we have investigated the electrical characteristics of such a generator for the first time experimentally and modelled the phenomenon with electroconvection governing equations. A numerical simulation is performed using the local approximation for the charge-potential relation and results are in qualitative agreement with experiments. Comment: 7 pages, 8 figures.

40|$|An {{analysis}} {{is made for}} tho laminar film condensation on a rotating axisymmetrical general curved body of which the cylinder, the disc and the cones are special examples. The body rotates about a vertical axis and the film is assumed to drain {{under the influence of}} gravitational and centrifugal accelerations. The problem is formulated as a solution of the Navier-Stokes and energy equations. A differential equation which governs the growth of the condensate film is obtained and solved to yield one equation which is applicable to all rotating axisymmetrical bodies. The equation involves the geometry of the body and requires a single integration for the complete solution. Theoretical results of condensate layer thickness and heat transfer coefficients are given for a curved body whose generator forms a circular are of 90 for a speed range of 0. 1 to 10 (^ 6) rev/min. It is shown that when the curvature is neglected, the analysis over estimate the local film thickness by 71 per cent. Experimental results for the curved body confirm the theoretical findings. However, due to the formation of roll-waves on the condensate layer and hence a departure from the laminar model, the experimental results for the heat transfer coefficient were 1. 055 to 1. 440 times greater than the theoretical predictions. No detachment of drops from the film of condensate was observed at the experimental speed range of 0. 0 to 1000 rev/min. and the condensate drained as a <b>film</b> along the <b>generator.</b> The criterion for the detachment of drops given by Howe is re-appraised and a new criterion which states that "the non-dimensional film thickness η, should be equal to or greater than 1. 8 for the onset of the detachment of dropq" is proposed...|$|R

This project deals with powering these sensors by harvesting environmental vibrational energy and {{eliminating the need for}} batteries. Using MEMS technology, a thin <b>film</b> Piezoelectric Micropower <b>Generator</b> device could be constructed. The PMPG is simply a cantilever structure tuned to resonate at environmental frequencies. At resonance, sizable strain is induced in a layer of the beam made from the piezoelectric material, PZT, thereby generating electricity. Recent studies have found that the most available environmental frequencies are on the order of 100 Hz. Current PMPG structures were designed to operate at 20 kHz. This project is aimed at understanding how to design low resonance beams while keeping them compact. Large one-dimensional cantilevers of low resonant frequency would pose serious packaging problems for the device. Two [...] dimensional spiral beams were designed and analyzed using analytical as well as finite element methods. (cont.) The dependence on length was found to be a function of 1 - 1. 3 rather than 1 - 2 of conventional one-dimensional beams. A variety of designs were developed using ANSYS which have resonant frequencies in the target range. The mode shapes were also simulated.

A maximum power output of 192 [mu]W at 235 krpm has been measured under driven excitation {{of the six}} phases. Self excited operation was also demonstrated.

The generator comprises 5 silicon layers, fusion bonded together, and annealed at 700 ⁰C. The turbine rotor, 4 mm in diameter, is supported on gas bearings.
