500|$|Van der Byl {{moved to}} Southern Rhodesia in 1950 to manage {{some of his}} family's tobacco farming interests, hoping {{to make his own}} fortune. Having visited the country many times as a youth, he remarked that after reading about the profits to be made from tobacco he [...] "suddenly got a rush of blood to the crotch about the tobacco boom and decided I was going to <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> make the family fortune in a place I liked and wanted to be in." [...] He welcomed the move as it allowed him to indulge his hobby of big game hunting: in that year in Angola, then under Portuguese rule, he set a world record for the biggest {{elephant}} shot, which stood until 1955.|$|E
500|$|Appalachian State had {{routinely}} scheduled FBS teams, {{playing against}} schools such as LSU (2005), Auburn (1999), Kansas (2005), and NC State (2006). They also had games against Wake Forest in every season from 1979 to 1996, {{as well as}} in 1998, 2000, and 2001. Appalachian State had won six of these games, all of them against Wake Forest. The Mountaineers had not beaten an FBS team since 2000. Michigan, a historic college football power with a large fan base, had never played an FCS team. According to Appalachian State athletic director Charlie Cobb, both schools had gaps in their schedule as late as February 2007; the friendship between Mountaineers coach Jerry Moore and Wolverines coach Lloyd Carr {{played a key role in}} completing the deal. While attempting to determine the amount of money Appalachian State would be paid for playing Michigan, negotiations between the two schools reached a halt. Moore went to school officials and urged them to accept any offer Michigan gave them; he recalled telling them that [...] "It's an opportunity game. It'll be a one-shot, once-in-a-lifetime deal to <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> play. It's an unbelievable environment." [...] Appalachian State ultimately settled on a $400,000 payment in return for playing against Michigan to open the 2007 season.|$|E
500|$|Patton {{views on}} race were {{complicated}} and often negative. This {{may have been}} cultivated from his privileged upbringing and family roots in the southern United States. Privately he wrote of black soldiers: [...] "Individually they were good soldiers, but I expressed my belief at the time, and have never found the necessity of changing it, that a colored soldier cannot think fast enough to fight in armor." [...] He also stated that performance {{was more important than}} race or religious affiliation: [...] "I don't give a damn who the man is. He can be a nigger or a Jew, but if he has the stuff and does his duty, he can have anything I've got. By God! I love him." [...] Addressing 761st Tank Battalion Patton also said, [...] "Men, you are the first Negro tankers ever to fight in the American Army. I would never have asked for you if you weren't good. I have nothing but the best in my army. I don't care what color you are, so long as you <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> kill those Kraut sonsabitches! Everyone has their eyes on you and is expecting great things from you. Most of all, your race is looking forward to you. Don't let them down and, damn you, don't let me down!" [...] Likewise, Patton called heavily on the black troops under his command. Historian Hugh Cole notes that Patton was the first to integrate black and white soldiers into rifle companies.|$|E
5000|$|First aired November 2, 201060 minute episodeThe {{teams are}} told {{that they will be}} {{spending}} the week with the Marines at Camp Pendleton, where they will undergo Marine training. At the camp, they are subjected to harsh treatment and living conditions, and have a little trouble with the food, which is the same food served to Marine recruits. They face an obstacle course challenge, with the reward being phone calls home. The Blue Team wins handily as Elizabeth, of the Black Team, passes out and needs assistance. The Black Team finishes the course but are practically carrying Elizabeth. The contestants came into their last chance workout and Bob and Jillian are especially surprised to see Brendan getting his hair and beard shaved off. The Teams stayed at Camp Pendleton for Last Chance Workout with Jillian. Ada manages a 10 mph sprint, briefly, on the treadmill. At the weigh-in, the results are dismal. The Blue Team goes first and Mark loses 7 lb. Than Jessica only loses a staggering 4 lb. Lisa <b>goes</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> only loses 2 lb. Then Jesse <b>goes</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> gains a pound! Bob is surprised at the low numbers Jesse accomplished. Aaron <b>goes</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> loses 14 lbs. The black team needs to lose more than 28 lb. Ada <b>goes</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> drops 7 lbs. Patrick drops 7 lbs. also. Then Brendan then Anna loses 2 lbs. Elizabeth gains a pound. Frado gains 4 pounds. Jillian, Bob, and Ali are all disgusted at Frado, who gains 4 pounds, <b>and</b> he swears <b>there</b> was no game play involved in his gain. Ada had the highest percentage of weight loss, so she got immunity. The Black Team loses and they unanimously vote off Anna, {{as the rest of the}} team is a tight group ...|$|R

Certainly we have not strength sufficient to clear away those fallen stones, and probably the cave is blocked by a wall several feet thick. We should want tools and blasting- powder to get through it.

6000|$|We {{discovered}} the secret at last; the metropolitan Members always dined at home. The rascals! As for giving additional Members to Ireland, {{it was even}} worse—decidedly unconstitutional.

He took no wine; drank table-beer by the half-gallon; and went home to Manchester-buildings, or Millbank-street, for his whiskey-and-water. And what was the consequence?

We wonder he ever left the old place, and fully expected to see in the papers, the morning after the fire, a pathetic account of an old gentleman in black, of decent appearance, who was seen at one of the upper windows when the flames were at their height, and declared his resolute intention of falling with the floor.

The caravans from here are composed, for the most part, of very hard characters, the sort of men who would shoot you for your horse if they took a fancy to it; I would by no means advise you to ally {{yourself}} with such men. I can, I think, put you {{in the way of a}} better plan than that. I find that a great number of caravans from the West are going by a northern route which crosses the Missouri at a point called Omaha. I have been thinking that this will become an important place, and have made up my mind to freight four or five flats with flour, bacon, and other goods of all sorts, and a frame store, and to <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> open a business. I shall want a handy man with me at first; I shall take up a storekeeper to leave there in charge, but at first he will want help. If you like to go up in charge of one of the scows, and to stay to help put up the store and set things running, I will give you a hundred dollars, and you can have your passage up for your horse, which I should advise you to buy here. You will get one that will carry you, though of course not much to look at, for about fifty dollars; I know several horse-dealers here, and will get one for you if you like. You had also better get a stout pony to carry your traps and provisions; that will cost about forty dollars. Then you must have a rifle and a Colt. These are absolutely necessary for such a journey, for I hear that the Indians are very troublesome on the plains. These, however, I myself shall have much pleasure in presenting you with, in testimony of the obligation I feel I owe you for saving my boat and goods. The hundred dollars that are due to you, and the hundred that you will further earn at Omaha, will be sufficient for your horses and outfit, which will leave this money which you placed in my hands untouched. You will find that very useful, for you will want to buy a tent and provisions and tools out there, and money to keep you till you hit upon gold. Well, what do you think of my offer?" ...|$|E
