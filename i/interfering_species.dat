We present a framework for investigating anthropogenic light and noise as agents of selection, and as drivers of other evolutionary processes, to influence a range of behavioral and physiological traits such as phenological characters and sensory and signaling systems.

There are optical, mechanical, and electronic difficulties with the interferometry hardware design. Flight data from Cessna 402 over southeastern Virginia during April 1978 yielded amplitude fluctuations that are explainable only as internal nonlinearities. Misalignment of the AGC/interferometer optical axis also contributed to a large error source in the flight data.

40|$|Anthropogenic mercury {{emission}} is {{a serious}} global environmental problem because of its toxicity to humans, plants and wildlife. In order to control these emissions, accurate and reliable online continuous mercury monitoring systems (CMMs) are critical. Such systems can notify appropriate authorities or provide feedback signals to a process control system in time, thus making them {{an integral part of}} monitoring and controlling Hg emissions. We demonstrate how nanostructured gold can easily be deposited in small quantities on nickel electrode based QCMs using galvanic replacement (GR) reactions with the resultant surface having excellent Hg monitoring properties. The developed GR surfaces were observed to have higher sensitivity and selectivity in the presence of <b>interfering</b> gas <b>species</b> (NH 3 and H 2 O), as well as to have ~ 80 % higher mercury sorption capacity than the most efficient mercury sorbents reported to date. Investigations towards the Hg-sensing capabilities of the resultant Ni-Au surface based Hg sensors showed ~ 50 % better sensitivity and detection limit over control Au films. Furthermore, the GR based QCMs were found to self-regenerate without changing the operating temperature of the sensor, undergoing Hg desorption with sensor recoveries of 93. 7 - 99. 3 % following Hg exposure at an operating temperature of 90 Â°C. Surface depth profile analysis of the Ni-Au electrode surfaces showed that the high recovery rate of the sensors was primarily due to the Ni-Au structures, which unlike continuous Au thin-films more commonly used for Hg sensing applications, do not accumulate Hg at the sensitive-layer-substrate interface. Furthermore, the GR Ni-Au surfaces were found to be highly selective towards Hg vapor in the presence of NH 3 and H 2 O <b>interfering</b> gas <b>species</b> which makes them potentially suitable for operating in harsh industrial effluent environments...|$|R

That is, the Hg 0 vapor sensing {{performance of the}} developed sensor was investigated under different operating temperatures (30 - 130 °C) and working conditions (i. e., humid) {{as well as in}} the presence of various <b>interfering</b> gas <b>species,</b> including ammonia (NH 3), hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S), nitric oxide (NO), carbon mono-oxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO 2), sulfur dioxide (SO 2), hydrogen (H 2), methane (CH 4), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as ethylmercaptan (EM), acetaldehyde (MeCHO) and methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) among others. The results indicate that the introduction of Au nanostructures (referred to as nanospikes) on the sensor&# 039;s surface enhanced the sensitivity toward Hg 0 vapor by up-to 450 %. The newly developed sensor exhibited a limit of detection (LoD) (∼ 35 μg/m 3), repeatability (∼ 94 %), desorption efficiency (100 %) and selectivity (∼ 93 %) when exposed to different concentrations of Hg 0 vapor (0. 5 to 9. 1 mg/m 3) and <b>interfering</b> gas <b>species</b> at a chosen operating temperature of 105 °C. Furthermore, the sensor was also found to show 91 % average selectivity when exposed toward harsher industrial gases such as NO, CO, CO 2, and SO 2 along with same concentrations of Hg 0 vapor in similar operating conditions. In fact, this is the first time a conductometric sensor is shown to have high selectivity toward Hg 0 vapor even in the presence of H 2 S. Overall results indicate that the developed sensor has immense potential to be used as accurate online Hg 0 vapor monitoring technology within industrial processes...|$|R

25|$|In some cases, {{third party}} <b>species</b> <b>interfere</b> to the {{detriment}} or benefit of the competing species. In a laboratory study, coexistence between two competing bacterial species was mediated by phage parasites.

50|$|For this reason, since {{more than}} 20 years many {{research}} {{efforts have been}} dedicated to on-chip embarked tiny reference field effect transistors (REFET). Their functioning principle, or operating mode, can vary, depending on the electrode producers and are often proprietary and protected by patents. Semi-conductor modified surfaces required for REFET are also not always in thermodynamical equilibrium with the test solution and can be sensitive to aggressive or <b>interfering</b> dissolved <b>species</b> or not well characterized aging phenomena. This is not a real problem if the electrode can be frequently re-calibrated at regular time interval and is easily maintained during its service life. However, this may be an issue if the electrode has to remain immersed on-line for prolonged period of time, or is inaccessible for particular constrains related {{to the nature of}} the measurements itself (geochemical measurements under elevated water pressure in harsh environments or under anoxic or reducing conditions easily disturbed by atmospheric oxygen ingress or pressure changes).|$|R
50|$|Because of the {{relative}} rarity of the heavy isotopes of C, H, and O, IRMS of doubly substituted species requires larger volumes of sample gas and longer analysis times than traditional stable isotope measurements, thereby requiring extremely stable instrumentation. In addition, the doubly-substituted isotopologues are often subject to isobaric interferences, as in the methane system where 13CH5+ and 12CH3D+ ions interfere with measurement of the 12CH2D2+ and 13CH3D+ species at mass 18. A measurement of such species requires either very high mass resolving power to separate one isobar from another, or modeling of {{the contributions of the}} <b>interfering</b> <b>species</b> to the abundance of the species of interest. These analytical challenges are significant: The first publication precisely measuring doubly substituted isotopologues did not appear until 2004, though singly substituted isotopologues had been measured for decades previously.|$|E
50|$|NAA {{can perform}} {{non-destructive}} analyses on solids, liquids, suspensions, slurries, and gases with no or minimal preparation. Due to the penetrating nature of incident neutrons and resultant gamma rays, the technique provides a true bulk analysis. As different radioisotopes have different half-lives, counting can be delayed to allow <b>interfering</b> <b>species</b> to decay eliminating interference. Until {{the introduction of}} ICP-AES and PIXE, NAA was the standard analytical method for performing multi-element analyses with minimum detection limits in the sub-ppm range. Accuracy of NAA is {{in the region of}} 5%, and relative precision is often better than 0.1%. There are two noteworthy drawbacks to the use of NAA; even though the technique is essentially non-destructive, the irradiated sample will remain radioactive for many years after the initial analysis, requiring handling and disposal protocols for low-level to medium-level radioactive material; also, the number of suitable activation nuclear reactors is declining; with a lack of irradiation facilities, the technique has declined in popularity and become more expensive.|$|E
50|$|Unlike atomic {{absorption}} spectroscopy, {{which can only}} measure a single element at a time, ICP-MS has the capability to scan for all elements simultaneously. This allows rapid sample processing. A simultaneous ICP-MS that can record the entire analytical spectrum from lithium to uranium in every analysis won the Silver Award at the 2010 Pittcon Editors' Awards. An ICP-MS may use multiple scan modes, each one striking a different balance between speed and precision. Using the magnet alone to scan is slow, due to hysteresis, but is precise. Electrostatic plates {{can be used in}} addition to the magnet to increase the speed, and this, combined with multiple collectors, can allow a scan of every element from Lithium 6 to Uranium Oxide 256 in {{less than a quarter of}} a second. For low detection limits, <b>interfering</b> <b>species</b> and high precision, the counting time can increase substantially. The rapid scanning, large dynamic range and large mass range is ideally suited to measuring multiple unknown concentrations and isotope ratios in samples that have had minimal preparation (an advantage over TIMS), for example seawater, urine, and digested whole rock samples. It also lends well to laser ablated rock samples, where the scanning rate is so quick that a real time plot of any number of isotopes is possible.This also allows easy spatial mapping of mineral grains.|$|E

Moreover, appropriate ploughing techniques can be implemented to eliminate the layer of fungi that accumulates on soil and consequently prevent the propagation of fusaria. Irrigation control can also significantly limit water-mediated dispersion of pathogenic Fusarium species, ultimately reducing the likelihood of crop contamination.|$|R
40|$|A facile {{method for}} {{selective}} detection {{based on the}} concept of electrochemical depletion of <b>interfering</b> <b>species</b> in diffusion layer was established. The feasibility of the method was verified by detecting dopamine in the presence of ascorbic acid. By applying a proper step potential to working electrode, at which <b>interfering</b> <b>species,</b> ascorbic acid, is oxidized while dopamine is kept unconsumed, an interferent-depleted region is thus created in the diffusion layer of the working electrode. Then the target analyte is detected by applying a follow-up linear sweep voltammetry with faster sweep rate to ensure the amount of the <b>interfering</b> <b>species</b> that diffuses to the electrode surface is negligible. The influence of step potential, step duration and sweep rate oil dopamine detection has been systematically investigated.

Prior disposal practices resulted in the contamination of groundwater near certain military installations with both species. The current regulatory threshold promulgated by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for NDMA in surface waters designated for drinking is 0. 7 ng NDMA/L (0. 7 pptr) L. Existing procedures for determining NDMA in aqueous samples typically employ dichloromethane extraction followed by concentration to a final volume of 1 mL, and gas chromatographic analysis of a 2 {mu}L aliquot of concentrate using either a nitrogen-phosphorus detector (NPD), mass spectrometric detector, or chemiluminescent nitrogen detector (CLND). Such a protocol does not permit detection of NDMA at the desired health-based criterion unless high-resolution mass spectrometric (HRMS) detectors are employed.

Studies in batch culture indicated that lag-phase cultures were especially sensitive to elevated dCO 2 levels.

40|$|Although {{predation}} {{is thought}} to affect species divergence, the effects of predator-mediated natural selection on species divergence and in nonadaptive radiations have seldom been studied. Wing melanization in Calopteryx damselflies has important functions in sexual selection and interspecific interactions and in species recognition. The genus Calopteryx and other damselfly genera have also been put forward as examples of radiations driven by sexual selection. We show that avian predation strongly affects natural selection on wing morphology and male wing melanization in two congeneric and sympatric species of this genus (Calopteryx splendens and Calopteryx virgo). Predation risk was almost three times higher for C. virgo, which has an exaggerated degree of wing melanization, {{than it was for}} the less exaggerated, sympatric congener C. splendens. Selective predation on the exaggerated species C. virgo favored a reduction and redistribution of the wing melanin patch. There was evidence for nonlinear selection involving wing patch size, wing patch darkness, and wing length and width in C. splendens but weaker nonlinear selection on the same trait combinations in C. virgo.
