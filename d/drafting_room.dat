25|$|Valued at {{approximately}} $480,080. the new addition provided additional extensions {{to the existing}} facilities, an agricultural greenhouse, an electrical or carpentry shop, a <b>drafting</b> <b>room,</b> an automotive shop, a machine shop, and three classrooms.|$|E
25|$|The school {{curriculum}} now included Arts and Science, Business and Commerce, and Science, Technology and Trades. Within each branch {{there were five}} year courses and four year courses. In addition there were also occupational courses {{for boys and girls}} who only have one or two years to spend at school. The new Technical wing was the most up-to-date building of its kind in Ontario. It contained a Technical Director's office, <b>Drafting</b> <b>Room,</b> Machine Shop, Electrical Shop, Automotive Shop, Diversified Trades Shop, Greenhouse, Industrial Sewing Room, Nursing Room, Business Machines Room, Typing Room and Classrooms.|$|E

5000|$|A {{great deal}} of {{confusion}} has ensued in <b>drafting</b> <b>rooms</b> and engineering departments when drawings are transferred from one convention to another. On engineering drawings, the projection angle is denoted by an international symbol consisting of a truncated cone, respectively for first-angle and third-angle: ...|$|R
50|$|In 1898-1899 {{plans were}} {{prepared}} {{under the supervision}} of chief architect Thomas Pye of the Queensland Government Architect's office. Special provisions for the Lands Department included Minister's offices, <b>drafting</b> <b>rooms,</b> photographic and heliographic rooms, and a Land Court. With the inclusion of offices for the Executive Council and Cabinet, a separate entrance in George Street was designed for ministerial access.|$|R
25|$|Wright {{relocated}} {{his practice}} {{to his home}} in 1898 in order to bring his work and family lives closer. This move made further sense as the majority of the architect's projects at that time were in Oak Park or neighboring River Forest. The birth of three more children — Catherine in 1894, David in 1895, and Frances in 1898 — prompted Wright to sacrifice his original home studio space for additional bedrooms and necessitated his design and construction of an expansive studio addition {{to the north of the}} main house. The space, which included a hanging balcony within the two-story <b>drafting</b> <b>room,</b> was one of Wright's first experiments with innovative structure. The studio was a poster for Wright's developing aesthetics and would become the laboratory from which the next ten years of architectural creations would emerge.|$|E
25|$|Maines {{building}} time of {{nine years}} was unusually protracted, {{due to the}} limits of U.S. industry at the time. (The delivery of her armored plating took three years and a fire in the <b>drafting</b> <b>room</b> of the building yard, where Maines working set of blueprints were stored, caused further delay.) In those nine years, naval tactics and technology changed radically and left Maines actual role in the navy ill-defined. At the time she was laid down, armored cruisers such as Maine were intended to serve as small battleships on overseas service and were built with heavy belt armor. Great Britain, France and Russia had constructed such ships to serve this purpose and sold others of this type, including Riachuelo, to second-rate navies. Within a decade, this role had changed to commerce raiding, for which fast, long-range vessels, with only limited armor protection, were needed. The advent of lightweight armor, such as Harvey steel, made this transformation possible.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, {{a series of}} {{articles}} appeared in the school's student newspaper The Tower, detailing significant safety and space issues within what was then known as the IA (Industrial Arts) Building. Much debate over the conditions (and need for expansion) in the 1930s-era wing ensued between the cost-conscious GPPS Board and concerned parents and teachers. The School Board ultimately agreed that major improvements were necessary. An area with tennis courts was selected for the expansion, which were later replaced on top of the industrial technology shops. The top floor of math rooms was unchanged. A modern photography classroom and lab sat next to a new <b>drafting</b> <b>room,</b> while two modernized art rooms provided general and commercial art classes with fine homes. The first floor featured a fine drawing and painting studio, a superlative ceramics, sculpture, and metals laboratory, and an art appreciation lecture classroom. The industrial technology department started in earnest in the remodeled basement. The sprawling underground addition started with the parking and outdoor service area of the four-bay automotive shop backed up by a sophisticated wood and metal shop and a TV studio.|$|E
50|$|The high school's 800-seat theater {{has been}} built to Broadway {{standards}} in terms of sound, lighting and acoustics. In addition to the school's theaters, students {{have access to a}} TV studio, art studios, music rooms, individual performance practice <b>rooms,</b> <b>drafting</b> <b>rooms</b> and shops to build and design stage sets. The classrooms all feature smartboards, advanced integrated audio-visual systems, and multiple computer workstations.|$|R
50|$|In 1922, the Irish Constitution was <b>drafted</b> in <b>room</b> 112, {{now known}} as The Constitution Room.|$|R
50|$|The firm {{returned}} to Fifth Avenue in 1925. The firm’s {{facilities in the}} new Aeolian Building included a 150-seat recital hall, recording studios for Duo Art piano rolls, offices, design studios, <b>drafting</b> <b>rooms,</b> and a director’s room in the upper stories. The Aeolian Company (as Aeolian American Corp.) remained in the Aeolian Building until 1938, after which it leased half of Chickering Hall on West 57th St.|$|R
25|$|The Patterson {{was named}} for Carlile Pollock Patterson, fourth Superintendent of the Coast Survey and first of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. The New York Times {{credited}} the design to Commander Colby Mitchell Chester, USN, at that time Hydrographic Inspector in USC Naval architect Samuel Hartt Pook, U.S. Naval Constructor, was credited with supervising the drawings. She was built of wood in James D. Leary's yard at Williamsburg (Brooklyn) New York. Frames were white oak with cedar tops; planking, beams and lower deck were yellow pine, the upper deck was white pine. Her hull was fitted with iron diagonal braces, and five watertight bulkheads (3 wood, 2 iron). Power was a Cross compound vertical steam engine (one source reports 356hp, another source says 215 ihp; this difference may represent different calculation or measurement methods) and she could carry 133 tons of coal as fuel. Her machinery was constructed by Neafie & Levy of Philadelphia. She was rigged as a barkentine with double topsail yards; standing rigging was galvanized charcoal-iron wire. Her boats were two steam launches, two cutters, two whaleboats, and a dinghy. Her deckhouse, 13 × 62ft, included the engine and boiler rooms, galley, pantry, and a <b>drafting</b> <b>room.</b> She carried a Sigsbee piano-wire sounding machine, state-of-the-art for deep-water hydrography, holding five miles of wire. Lieutenant Richardson Clover, USN, supervised construction and became her first commander.|$|E
500|$|Coffin's {{college years}} were {{nonetheless}} a [...] "long grind", as she described it, with a seemingly unrelenting [...] "long routine of hard work" [...] relieved only by her summer abroad. She {{and the other}} three women in the program maintained a friendly competition with the male students which, she said, [...] "put us on our mettle to prove that we, too, were serious students and competitors. This association with many types of boys and men I found very helpful as we had a fine spirit of camaraderies in the <b>drafting</b> <b>room</b> and many a helping hand was given me at a critical moment, though one had to steel oneself to hear many a severe criticism, which was perhaps even more valuable." ...|$|E
2500|$|There are twenty-seven {{academic}} {{classrooms in}} the Clay High School building including three computer labs, an industrial arts shop and <b>drafting</b> <b>room,</b> a chemistry/physics lab, a biology lab, {{and a home}} economics lab. [...] The district's superintendent and treasurer also have offices in the building. [...] The CHS softball field {{is located on the}} grounds of Rubyville Elementary. [...] The school does not have home tennis courts nor a cross country course.|$|E
25|$|In addition, Neafie & Levy built {{some small}} {{warships}} and sugar-processing equipment for South American customers, a niche {{the company had}} filled since the 1870s. Business was solid enough {{for the company to}} invest in further expansion of its plant, with new offices, <b>drafting</b> <b>rooms</b> and workshops. To help pay for this expansion, the company went public, and formally became the Neafie & Levy Ship and Engine Building Company. The proprietors however, retained the majority of shares and thus control of the business.|$|R
50|$|Farrell was {{the first}} round draft pick of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the 1982 NFL Draft; Buccaneers {{management}} had actually intended to select defensive end Booker Reese, and Farrell's name was turned in due to a communication error in the <b>draft</b> <b>room.</b> The team then traded the next year's first round pick {{in order to get}} Reese as well. Ironically, Farrell played at a high level for the Buccaneers, while Reese ultimately came to be {{considered one of the most}} disappointing draft picks in team history.|$|R
5000|$|The Clay Jr.-Sr. High School {{building}} is shaped somewhat as an [...] "E" [...] (facing east) from an aerial view. In {{the middle of}} the vertical arm is the main entrance, which faces west toward U.S. Route 23. The industrial arts and <b>drafting</b> <b>rooms</b> are located in the top wing while the lower arm (or [...] "old junior high" [...] wing) houses additional academic classrooms. The middle wing consists of the cafeteria, band room, gymnasium, health facility, and the [...] "new junior high" [...] wing.|$|R
2500|$|In 1914, Lankes married Edee Maria Bartlett. In 1915, {{his first}} {{child was born}} with three more to follow. Having a wife and family to support, he {{obtained}} work as foreman of the <b>drafting</b> <b>room</b> at Newton Arms, a rifle factory in Buffalo. In 1917, using a V-cutting tool intended for cross-hatching grips on gunstocks, {{and a piece of}} wood from an apple tree blown down by a storm, he cut his first woodblock titled [...] "Flying Gosling." ...|$|E
2500|$|In April 1933, {{after reading}} the {{autobiography}} of Frank Lloyd Wright, Vida Lautner approached the architect, who had recently launched his apprenticeship program at Taliesin. Lautner was quickly admitted to the Fellowship, but he had recently become engaged to a neighbor, Mary Faustina ("MaryBud") Roberts and could not afford the fees, so Vida approached MaryBud's mother, who agreed {{to pay for the}} couple to join the program. John soon realized that he had little interest in formal drafting and avoided the Taliesin <b>drafting</b> <b>room,</b> preferring daily duties of [...] "carpenter, plumber, farmer, cook and dishwasher, that is an apprentice, which I still believe is the real way to learn". From 1933 to 1939, he worked and studied under Wright at the studios in Wisconsin and Arizona.|$|E
2500|$|Entering the 1837 {{competition}} {{to design the}} Boston Custom House, Young submitted another cruciform scheme combining a Greek Doric portico with a Roman dome. Planned {{on a large scale}} at what was then the waterfront, the building reflected the strength and confidence of the young, growing nation. It won, defeating several other entries, including one by Asher Benjamin. [...] Young was appointed supervisor of construction, which took from 1837 until 1847. In 1838, he established a Boston <b>drafting</b> <b>room.</b> The building's 32 columns were each carved from a single piece from Quincy granite. They measured 5 foot 4inches in diameter, stood 32 feet high, and weighed 42 tons. Purists decried the Roman dome on a Greek form. [...] Far less sympathetic to the building's Greek form, however, would be the soaring Custom House Tower which replaced the dome from 1913 to 1915. Boston's first skyscraper, it was designed by Peabody & Stearns to add both office space and presence to a building obscured by later others.|$|E
50|$|Gundersen Hall is a {{building}} {{located on the}} main campus of Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, Oklahoma. Construction on the facility began {{in the fall of}} 1911, after funds for the building were allocated by legislators. The old boiler house and shop buildings that existed at the site were torn down to make space for the new building. The new building was completed in November 1912, with rooms for laboratories, offices, <b>drafting</b> <b>rooms,</b> and classrooms. Originally designed for engineering students, the building now holds faculty offices, computer labs, and is the home of Online Learning for the Spears School of Business. It also houses a foreign language lab for students.|$|R
50|$|The General Administrative Services Office {{occupy the}} first floor while the Br. Fidelis Leddy Learning Resource Center {{occupies}} the whole second level of the building. The third floor up to the fifth consists of lecture rooms. There is also a case room for thesis defense located on the third floor. The gymnasium {{is located on the}} topmost level of the building. Most of the classrooms in this building are equipped with LCD and OHP projectors, television sets with VHS players, and computers. The Mutien-Marie Hall formerly held the <b>drafting</b> <b>rooms,</b> Industrial Design laboratory and the head office of the School of Design and Arts.|$|R
50|$|Forced <b>draft</b> fire <b>rooms</b> {{were used}} until World War II. These {{required}} that personnel enter through an air lock {{to maintain the}} pressure. These were abandoned when the forced draft occasionally failed and blowback occurred killing fire room personnel.|$|R
2500|$|Lautner progressed rapidly under Wright's mentorship. By 1934,— {{the year}} he and MaryBud married, he was {{preparing}} design details for a Wright house in Los Angeles for Alice Millard, working on the Playhouse and Studios at Taliesin, {{and he had the}} first of many articles (under the masthead [...] "At Taliesin") published in the Wisconsin State Journal and Capital Times. The following year, he was assigned to what became a two-year project supervising a Wright-designed house in Marquette for MaryBud's mother. In 1937, he agreed to oversee the construction of the Johnson residence [...] "Wingspread" [...] (his personal favorite among the Wright projects he worked on) near Racine, Wisconsin and traveled with Wright to supervise photography of the Malcolm Willey House in Minneapolis, Minnesota, which became a key source for his own small houses. He was also deeply involved {{in the construction of the}} <b>Drafting</b> <b>Room</b> at Taliesin West— which influenced the design of his Mauer House (1946)— collated photographs of Wright's work for a 1938 special issue of Architectural Forum and later briefly returned to Taliesin to help assemble models and materials for a 1940 Museum of Modern Art exhibition.|$|E

50|$|Martini was {{initially}} rejected by some ninety firms in her search for architectural work, {{on at least}} two occasions because the firms refused to have women in their <b>drafting</b> <b>rooms.</b> She then changed her approach: she went to business school and obtained a secretarial job at an architectural firm, a position she leveraged to shift into drafting. She ended up working as a draughtsperson for a number of Chicago-area architects including John B. Sutcliffe, who specialized in churches. In 1913, when she took and passed her Illinois licensing exam, she was the only woman of the 86 applicants; and, following the departure of Marion Mahony Griffin in 1914, she would for some years be the only woman architect licensed in private practice by the state of Illinois.|$|R
50|$|The office {{wings are}} close to the central structure. They are {{situated}} around a courtyard, which has walls that are veneered with white bricks so that incidental light is reflected up the surrounding corridors. The transitions to the offices are more simply built than the representative main hall. The dominant material is wood. In the office wings there are two small adjoining staircases {{at the end of the}} east wing and at the centre of the west wing. In both stairwells a paternoster lift operates and in the west wing there is also a freight elevator. In the north-west wing of the Behrens building there were originally the offices of the <b>drafting</b> <b>rooms</b> of the technical departments. Later, the rooms were divided into numerous individual rooms.|$|R

50|$|The former Washington Polytec Academy {{is where}} Washington Elementary School {{with a history}} that spanned from 1868 until 1935 once stood. Originally named Washington Number One, the school was renamed to honor George Washington {{crossing}} of the Allegheny River with Christopher Gist. A marker on the school notes the event. A structure was constructed on the site in 1908 and in 1936 was expanded to form the Washington Trade School. The Charles W. Bier designed structure opened on September 1, 1937. From 1937 until the early 21st century it served as a public vocational school capable of accommodating 900 students and included a testing laboratory, bricklaying shop, print shop, library, two <b>drafting</b> <b>rooms,</b> blue print shop, mimeograph room, and an auditorium with a seating capacity of 384.|$|R
5000|$|The Architects and Engineers Building is {{an office}} {{building}} in downtown Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States, designed by locally notable architects Hewitt and Brown and built by builders Pike and Cook. The building was influenced by Hewitt and Brown's relationship with designers who were dedicated to the City Beautiful movement. They intended to save money by grouping their practices in one building, and they also desired [...] "the special advantage of proximity and the facility for making the knowledge and experience of each available to others." [...] The building was designed with private executive offices, as well as common <b>drafting</b> <b>rooms,</b> libraries, meeting rooms, and clerical facilities. The building was also intended for use at night by architectural students who would work in association with practicing professionals.|$|R
