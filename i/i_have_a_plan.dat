60|$|FIRST MERCHANT. Because I am of {{the ninth}} and mightiest hell Where are all kings, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "To-morrow at the Circus ... dost understand?... <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> ... and thou must obey ... blindly ... dost understand?" [...] he reiterated hoarsely.|$|E
6000|$|... "This is bad," [...] said Erling. [...] "But come, {{we have no}} time to waste. Give me {{the chief}} command of our men, father; <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> in my head." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan,</b> {{and that}} plan we carried out. It took some time.|$|R
6000|$|But he only said: [...] "I'm sorry. I didn't {{intend to}} trouble {{you with the}} sight of me. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> for getting over the cliff without letting you know, and having Maynard come down to me there." ...|$|R
50|$|BALDRICK: <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> cunning <b>plan.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "And if <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan,</b> ye Princes, {{what shall}} be my reward? It must be great, for I am weary of life, and I {{will not use}} my wisdom for a little thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Heavier than lead," [...] {{said the}} king. [...] "By George! <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan.</b> If I {{could get to}} the place where they keep the Stupidity, I could carry away enough of it to flatten out the Earthquaker." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You mustn't {{work too}} hard. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> for an outing. One of my districts lies {{up in the}} head-waters of the Willow. I propose that we all go camping up there {{for a couple of}} weeks." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{sucked in}} {{his lips and}} then went on. [...] "You've got to send for old Crappen," [...] he said. [...] "I'm going to alter things. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan.</b> But {{that would have been}} letting you off too easy. See? So--you send for old Crappen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My present plans, my lord? Indeed, I've no plans!--It's a {{long time}} since <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> of my own. I am, however, {{prepared}} to acquiesce entirely in any which you may propose. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> come quite prepared to throw at Miss Wyndham's feet myself and my fortune." ...|$|R
30|$|Question 19 : <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> {{detailed}} <b>plan</b> {{to start}} up my company in international business.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank God;--yes. I {{was looking}} at Brownriggs to-day,--and Ingram's. I don't think we'll sell either. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan,</b> and I think we can pull through without it. It is {{so much easier to}} sell than to buy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pshaw! what a Yankee you are, Wellingborough. Can't you {{see very}} plainly that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> in my head? And this {{disguise}} {{is only for}} a short time, you know. But I'll tell you all by and by." ...|$|E
6000|$|She opposed {{him there}} also. [...] "Don't do that--not now. Wait. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan.</b> I'll {{not go into}} it now, but when you come back, {{if there is no}} change, we will all go home and I will explain." ...|$|E
50|$|During the 1282 Welsh war, Edward <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> {{to strike}} his armies into Wales on three fronts {{in order to}} {{surround}} the armies of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd and destroy them. Edward sent Gilbert de Clare and his army to subdue and hold down the southern areas of Wales while other armies would invade {{other parts of the}} principality.|$|R
6000|$|... "MY DARLING HILDA: I {{told you}} that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan.</b> Well, <b>I</b> am off to [...] carry it out. It is of no use your asking what it is, or where I am [...] going. You will hear nothing of me until I return to tell you [...] whether <b>I</b> <b>have</b> failed or succeeded. Aunt knows what I am going to [...] do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Little {{wonder that}} you are perplexed," [...] said Kettle, [...] "seeing that ye know not my motive. The truth is, that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> in my head, which was to enter Harald's service, that I might act the spy on him, and so do my best for one who, all the time <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been in thraldom, has been as kind {{to me as if}} he had been my own father." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The Jew {{has sold}} us, but just {{now it is}} not important," [...] Don Erminio resumed. [...] "We cannot long run away from the French animal, but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan.</b> We will throw the guns {{overboard}} and wait for him." ...|$|E
6000|$|Hardy bowed. [...] "I {{am sorry}} I have troubled you," [...] he said, calmly, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> which I think would get your son {{out of this}} affair, and, as a {{business}} man, I wanted to {{make something out of}} it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{you shall}} learn by-and-by, {{after you have}} rescued her, White Man; till then my lips are shut. I tell you that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan,</b> and this must be enough, for more I will not say. If you are not content, {{let me go to}} seek help elsewhere." ...|$|E
60|$|ASHER. I {{was ready}} to {{recognize}} that. Before they came to me this morning <b>I</b> <b>had</b> made <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> to reorganize the shops, to grant many privileges.|$|R
6000|$|... "Be gracious for a little, {{and listen}} to my <b>plan.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> made <b>a</b> <b>plan.</b> Listen, Iris. I can no longer endure this life. It drives me mad." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes; <b>I</b> <b>have</b> come {{round to}} your opinion. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> made <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> for the Greek court you {{were anxious to}} build.' And he {{elevated}} the drawing-board against the wall.|$|R
6000|$|... "That I have {{no right}} of vigor to possess an armful of girl," [...] he {{completed}} for her, drawing her still closer. [...] "That I am a silly scientific brute who doesn't merit his 'vain little breath of sweet rose-colored dust.' Well, listen, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan.</b> In a few days...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear {{knight of}} the burning pestle, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan,</b> a device, a disentanglement, {{according}} to most approved rules of chivalry. Let us fix a day, and summon by tuck of drum all young gentlemen {{under the age of}} thirty, dwelling within fifteen miles of the habitation of that peerless Oriana." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Possibly. In fact certainly. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan.</b> Or {{at least}} an opportunity.... But that isn't what I have most in mind. These things are not done without emotion and a {{considerable}} strain upon one's personal relationships. I do not think this--I do not think your mother sees things as we do." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{found him}} looking curiously in my face; with that, there came before {{me like a}} vision of James Stewart and the court of Inverary; and my mind turned at once like a door upon its hinges. Trials, I reflected, {{sometimes}} draw out longer than is looked for. Even if I came to Inverary just too late, something might yet be attempted {{in the interests of}} James--and in those of my own character, the best would be accomplished. In a moment, it seemed without thought, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> devised.|$|R
60|$|The ninth we halved, for in {{the black}} depths of my soul <b>I</b> <b>had</b> formed <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> of fiendish subtlety. I {{intended}} {{to allow him to}} win--with extreme labour--eight holes in succession.|$|R
6000|$|... "Go {{to him at}} once, {{and make}} sure of his presence. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{imagined}} <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> to decoy him into the service of his lord; but I would now know the condition of his vessel." ...|$|R
6000|$|That may not be. [...] We cannot {{face the}} heavenly host in arms. [...] Her soul {{must come to}} us of its own will, [...] But being of the ninth and mightiest Hell [...] Where all are kings, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> to win it. [...] Lady, we've news that's crying out for speech.|$|E
6000|$|... "Did {{the beast}} give {{any signs of}} wanting to prance?" [...] asked Ricardo quickly, with {{absolutely}} genuine anxiety. [...] "It wouldn't do, sir. You must play him easy {{for at least a}} couple of days, sir. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan.</b> I have a notion that I can find out a lot in a couple of days." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{know you}} mean to do so," [...] rejoined his mother, [...] "but you will forget, unless you have some plan to make you {{remember}} it until the habit is formed. Now <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> to propose to help you form the habit. When you get the habit once formed {{there will be no}} more difficulty.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> formed <b>a</b> <b>plan.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{opened the}} cage-door and {{released}} the parrot. The cat, I think, will attack the parrot of which Miss 'Enderson is so fond. She will love him no more. He will be expelled.|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss Clair," [...] she said, {{in a voice}} which throbbed with emotion, [...] "Winnifred, if I may so call you, Lord Muddlenut and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> formed <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> {{for your}} future. It is our dearest wish that you should marry our son." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One {{season is}} very much like another," [...] she said, [...] "but it is not {{possible}} to absent oneself altogether. Then afterwards there is Cowes and Homburg, and <b>I</b> always <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> for at least three weeks in Scotland. I believe we shall close Rowchester altogether." ...|$|R
