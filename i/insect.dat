When an <b>insect</b> stuck in a web owned by P. labiata, P. schultzi or any regional variant of P. fimbriata, and next to a web spider's web, the web spider sometimes enters the Portia′s web, and the Portia pursues and catches the web spider.|$|E
5|$|As {{their name}} suggests, bee-eaters {{predominantly}} eat flying insects, especially bees and wasps, which {{are caught in}} the air by flights from an open perch.

5|$|Both {{species are}} omnivorous, eating fruit, flowers, buds, <b>insect</b> excretions, tree gums, large insects, spiders, frogs, chameleons, snakes, small birds, and eggs. Coquerel's giant mouse lemur {{is thought to}} opportunistically prey on mouse lemurs after an {{individual}} was found with a half-eaten gray mouse lemur (M.murinus) in a trap. During June and July, {{at the peak of}} the dry season, this species relies on sugary excretions from the larvae of hemipteran and cochineal insects as well as tree gums. The sugary excretions are obtained by either licking them from the back of the <b>insect</b> or collecting the crystallized sugars that accumulate beneath the <b>insect</b> colony. During this time of year, feeding on <b>insect</b> secretions can account for 60% of feeding activity. In contrast, the northern giant mouse lemur relies on cashew fruits during the dry season.|$|E

5|$|<b>Insect</b> {{mouthparts}} show {{many examples}} of convergent evolution. The mouthparts of different <b>insect</b> groups consist {{of a set of}} homologous organs, specialised for the dietary intake of that <b>insect</b> group. Convergent evolution of many groups of insects led from original biting-chewing mouthparts to different, more specialised, derived function types. These include, for example, the proboscis of flower-visiting insects such as bees and flower beetles, or the biting-sucking mouthparts of blood-sucking insects such as fleas and mosquitos.|$|E
5|$|<b>Insect</b> {{respiration}} {{is accomplished}} without lungs. Instead, the <b>insect</b> respiratory system uses {{a system of}} internal tubes and sacs through which gases either diffuse or are actively pumped, delivering oxygen directly to tissues that need it via their trachea (element 8 in numbered diagram). Since oxygen is delivered directly, the circulatory system is not used to carry oxygen, and is therefore greatly reduced. The <b>insect</b> circulatory system has no veins or arteries, and instead consists of {{little more than a}} single, perforated dorsal tube that pulses peristaltically. Toward the thorax, the dorsal tube (element 14) divides into chambers and acts like the insect's heart. The opposite end of the dorsal tube is like the aorta of the <b>insect</b> circulating the hemolymph, arthropods' fluid analog of blood, inside the body cavity. Air is taken in through openings {{on the sides of the}} abdomen called spiracles.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: It {{was shown}} {{that most of}} the fertilizations were the result of {{cross-pollination}} by <b>insects</b> and wind-pollination in buckwheat might be below 1. 3 % from the fertilization ratio in buckwheat, although the wind-pollination could become up to 1. 8 % occasionally. It has been believed that the main pollinators in buckwheat are honeybees and flies which are flying <b>insects.</b> But it was demonstrated in this study that the walking <b>insects,</b> for example ants, must not be ignored as the pollinators in buckwheat. This result indicated that the interruption of pollination not only by flying <b>insects</b> but also by walking <b>insects</b> is important in breeding and seed propagation. The sum of the seed-set pollinated only by the flying <b>insects</b> and only by the walking <b>insects</b> exceeded the seed-set pollinated by both <b>insects.</b> So it seemed that buckwheat were pollinated more than the potential seed-set in this experimental site in Nagoya. The walking <b>insects</b> pollinated more actively than the flying <b>insects</b> in the summer cultivation, although the magnitudes of pollination by flying and walking <b>insects</b> were almost the same in the autumn cultivation. Not only the flying <b>insects</b> but also the walking <b>insects</b> should be valued in buckwheat cultivation...|$|R

5|$|More generally, {{people make}} {{a wide range}} of uses of insects, both {{practical}} and symbolic. On the other hand, attitudes to insects are often negative, and extensive efforts are made to kill them. The widespread use of insecticides has failed to exterminate any <b>insect</b> pest, but has caused resistance to commonly-used chemicals in a thousand <b>insect</b> species.|$|E
5|$|Parasitoids {{lay their}} eggs on or {{in the body of}} an <b>insect</b> host, which is then used as a food for {{developing}} larvae. The host is ultimately killed. Most <b>insect</b> parasitoids are wasps or flies, and many have a very narrow host range. The most important groups are the ichneumonid wasps, which mainly use caterpillars as hosts; braconid wasps, which attack caterpillars and a wide range of other insects including aphids; chalcid wasps, which parasitize eggs and larvae of many <b>insect</b> species; and tachinid flies, which parasitize a wide range of insects including caterpillars, beetle adults and larvae, and true bugs.|$|E
5|$|Pathogenic {{micro-organisms}} include bacteria, fungi, and viruses. They kill or debilitate {{their host}} and are relatively host-specific. Various microbial <b>insect</b> diseases occur naturally, {{but may also}} be used as biological pesticides.

50|$|These traps are not {{effective}} at killing biting <b>insects</b> (female mosquitoes and other <b>insects),</b> being {{much more effective}} at attracting and killing other harmless and beneficial <b>insects.</b> A study by the University of Delaware showed that over period of 15 summer nights 13,789 <b>insects</b> were killed among six devices. Of those <b>insects</b> killed, only 31 were biting <b>insects.</b> Mosquitoes are attracted to carbon dioxide and water vapor in the breath of mammals, not ultraviolet light. However, there are now bug zappers that emit carbon dioxide or use an external bait, such as octenol, to better attract biting <b>insects</b> into the light.|$|R

5|$|The higher-level {{phylogeny}} of the arthropods {{continues to}} be a matter of debate and research.

The oldest definitive <b>insect</b> fossil is the Devonian Rhyniognatha hirsti, from the 396-million-year-old Rhynie chert.
