50|$|Thomas Goette’s 1994 study {{tries to}} {{classify}} important international site factors and to structure {{the process of}} international site selection. Goette distinguishes between economic site conditions (sales potential, competitive conditions, infrastructure and transportation costs, labor, monetary conditions), political site conditions (tax legislation, environmental protection, <b>institutional</b> <b>market</b> entry barriers, support of business, political risks), cultural site conditions (differences in language, mentality, religion, {{and the lack of}} acceptancy of foreign companies), and geographical site conditions (climate, topography). This study again demonstrates that an attempt to cover all aspects will result in loss of quality as all factors were not or could not be taken into consideration. Goette also theorizes that, in particular, industrial site decisions within companies are usually once-off and division-related decision-making processes. Based on this, Goette assumes a relatively low learning curve, and hence little potential for improvement for subsequent projects.|$|E
