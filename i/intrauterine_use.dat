50|$|Hyalobarrier is a {{substance}} to keep tissue apart post surgery and therefore prevent adhesions. It contains autocross-linked hyaluronan. Highly viscous due to condensation. Hyaluronan {{is present in}} cartilage and skin hence {{there is a natural}} metabolic pathway for it. This gel is used to separate organs and tissue after surgery. Scientific documentation so far covers the gynaecology speciality. IE Laparoscopic surgery, hysteroscopy/hysteroscopic surgery but also open surgery.According to data in a Cochrane collaboration review active action to prevent adhesions needs to be taken to a larger extent. The Cochrane report also states that the incidence of postsurgical adhesions is as high as 60 to 90%. In a recent review by C Sutton (University of Surrey, Guilford UK), it is stated that Hyalobarrier is the only anti adhesive substance that has published data for <b>intrauterine</b> <b>use.</b>|$|E

40|$|Background. Understanding {{the factors}} {{associated}} with the use of hormonal and intrauterine contraception among HIV-infected men and women may lead to interventions that can help reduce high unintended pregnancy rates. Materials and Methods. This study is a subanalysis of a cross-sectional survey of 289 women and 241 men who were sexually active and HIV-infected and were attending HIV care visits in Lilongwe, Malawi. We estimated adjusted prevalence ratios (PRs) to evaluate {{factors associated with}} hormonal and <b>intrauterine</b> contraceptive <b>use</b> for men and women in separate models. Results and Discussion. 39. 8 % of women and 33. 2 % of men (p= 0. 117) reported that they were <b>using</b> hormonal or <b>intrauterine</b> contraception at last intercourse. Having greater than 3 children was the only factor associated with hormonal and <b>intrauterine</b> contraceptive <b>use</b> among men. Among women, younger age, not wanting a pregnancy in 2 years, being with their partner for more than 4 years, and being able to make family planning decisions by themselves were associated with hormonal and <b>intrauterine</b> contraceptive <b>use.</b> Conclusions. The men and women in our study population differed in the factors associated with hormonal and <b>intrauterine</b> contraceptive <b>use.</b> Understanding these differences may help decrease unmet FP needs among HIV-infected men and women...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the contribution of laparoscopic intrauterine insemination to the improvement of fertilization and embryo recovery in Awassi ewes superovulated with FSH in breeding and non-breeding season. Twelve nonpregnant and cycling Awassi ewes of 3 - 4 years of age were randomly allocated in equal numbers (n = 6) to two groups. Each ewe was treated with a progesterone impregnated intravaginal sponge for 12 days. All ewes were superovulated with FSH in eight reducing doses for four days in the morning and evening from two days prior to sponge withdrawal. Ewes of group 1 were mated naturally at least two times with Awassi rams of proven fertility. Ewes of group 2 had intrauterine insemination and were conducted 44 - 46 h after sponge removal, under laparoscopic visualization of uterine horns, depositing 1 ml of semen in the distal portion of each uterine horn. Ovarian response was assessed by determining number of corpora lutea by laparoscopy on day 6 after mating. Embryo recovery was performed by hand assisted laparoscopy and by flushing both uterine horns. Ovarian response of the ewes superovulated with FSH was decreased to half in the non-breeding season. High number of unfertilized ova (P< 0. 05) was observed in ewes superovulated with FSH in the non-breeding season when naturally inseminated compared to ewes inseminated <b>intrauterine</b> <b>using</b> laparoscopic technique. Higher rates of embryo recovery (P< 0. 05) were achieved in superovulated ewes in the breeding season when ewes were inseminated by laparoscopic intrauterine insemination.

40|$|A {{population-based}} {{case-control study}} {{of risk factors}} for ectopic pregnancy has been conducted. The investigation includes 274 cases diagnosed in Rochester, Minnesota residents from 1935 through 1982, and 548 matched controls selected from live birth deliveries. Risk factor information documented prior to the last index menstrual period was obtained via medical record abstract for 22 potential risk factor variables. ^ Univariate matched analyses revealed nine variables with significantly elevated odds ratios (ORs). Following conditional logistic regression for matched sets, four variables remained as significant risk factors for ectopic pregnancy. These risk factors with ORs and 95 % confidence intervals (Cls) were: current <b>intrauterine</b> device <b>use</b> (OR = 13. 7, Cl = 1. 6 - 120. 6), infertility (OR = 2. 6, Cl = 1. 6 - 4. 2), pelvic inflammatory disease (OR = 3. 3, Cl = 1. 6 - 6. 6), and tubal surgery (OR = 4. 5, Cl = 1. 5 - 13. 9). After adjusting for these four major risk factors, the following variables did not have statistically significant ORs: abdominal/pelvic surgery (OR = 2. 0), acute appendicitis (OR = 2. 0), anovulation (OR = 1. 2), clomiphene citrate use during the index conception (OR = 3. 5), induced abortion (OR = 2. 1), in utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol (OR = 1. 6), myomas (OR = 0. 7), ovarian cysts (OR = 1. 0), and past <b>intrauterine</b> device <b>use</b> (OR = 1. 2). ...|$|R

Differences between freezing/thawing protocols were reflected in the proportion of cells with acrosomal damage and not based on motility results.

Neither the proportion of spermatozoa with intact plasma membranes after freezing-thawing, estimated by SEM, nor the proportion with swollen acrosomes? as estimated by TEM, differed significantly between methods, the proportions in both cases being larger than 65 %. The proportion of spermatozoa with disrupted acrosomal membranes after freezing-thawing with either method was low, around 5 %, as estimated using both SEM and TEM. However, freezing and thawing were followed by {{significant changes in the}} elemental composition in the postacrosomal region of the sperm heads. Both cryopreservation methods caused a significant decrease in intracellular concentrations of potassium. The Andersen method resulted in a significant increase in Ca-concentrations and a significant decrease in Cl-concentrations. The CLONE method caused a significant decrease in sulphur concentrations. Although whelping rates are generally high in practice <b>using</b> <b>intrauterine</b> insemination when <b>using</b> spermatozoa cryopreserved with either of the evaluated methods, the acrosomal changes seen in a high proportion of the spermatozoa and changes in the elemental composition of their heads suggest that cryopreservation-induced modifications might impair their longevity and fertilizing ability.
