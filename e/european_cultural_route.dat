40|$|International audienceIn {{the last}} few years, <b>European</b> <b>Cultural</b> <b>Routes</b> have become {{important}} tourist destinations. What makes this kind of tourism interesting is both the complexity of values and significances that motivate it and the variety of social actors (walkers, inhabitants, institutions, commercial actors, etc.) that are involved. Empirical studies on this phenomenon are still limited because they are really time-consuming and resource-demanding. Yet, social media data seem to provide new perspectives on this field by generating digital traces of the tourists' behavior. This paper aims at exploring how social media data can be employed in order to study tourism on <b>European</b> <b>Cultural</b> <b>Routes.</b> We will consider the case study of the platform Instagram on the route " Via Francigena "...|$|R

Traditionally, as with most pilgrimages, the Way of Saint James began at one's home and ended at the pilgrimage site. However, a few of the routes are {{considered}} main ones. During the Middle Ages, the route was highly travelled. However, the Black Death, the Protestant Reformation, and political unrest in 16th century Europe led to its decline. By the 1980s, only a few pilgrims per year arrived in Santiago. Later, the route attracted a growing number of modern-day pilgrims from around the globe.

40|$|Religious tourism has {{experienced}} a strong growth in recent years. It represents a complex and articulate phenomenon, in which the reasons and proposals related to the devotional and personal sphere are combined {{with a series of}} innovative opportunities that help reach a depth knowledge of a territory. The religious motive often means that pilgrims travel along specific routes to visit a number of shrines or even to complete lengthy itineraries. Increasingly, purely religious motives are becoming mixed with more secular forms of religious tourism, which often centre around specific religious sites. In this perspective, faith itineraries can be interpreted as drivers for territorial development able to evaluate the resources, the peculiarities and the identity of each place. This justifies and motivates the increase of several important initiatives which aim to make a significant contribution to the enhancement of cultural heritage and local development. Many of them are related to the most famous <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>routes.</b> As regard the Via Francigena, various projects are being hatched, highlighting some ‘minor’ ways of pilgrimage: this is what is currently happening in Piacenza Valleys, in the north of Italy, the case study of the research presented in this paper...|$|R

40|$|Pilgrimage is {{an age-old}} {{way of expressing}} one's {{religious}} faith through a collective religious ritual {{that can be found}} throughout the ages and among all peoples. Pilgrimage is, however, also an institution regulated by precise rules. In fact, there is a real and very ancient regulatory system whose rules have gradually been established over the centuries. The pilgrim who nowadays goes on the road to Santiago de Compostela, Rome, Jerusalem or Mecca is often unaware that he’s {{following in the footsteps of}} generations of believers who have gone this same route. This tradition has led to the creation and development of rules and legal norms, not only in the religious laws, but also in European law. Pilgrimage to Jerusalem was a duty for Jews up to 70 A. D., the year of the destruction of Solomon’s Temple. In Islamic tradition, the pilgrimage to Mecca, at least once in a lifetime, is a duty, one of the five pillars of the faith. Finally, while not an obligation, pilgrimage has been a ritual for Christians since ancient times, regulated by canon law. Every year millions of people all over the world make a pilgrimage. Aware of the cultural, but also economic, richness of pilgrimages, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has included among the world heritage sites to be protected many shrines and pilgrimage routes and destinations. The Council of Europe considers the pilgrimage <b>routes</b> as <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>routes.</b> Pilgrimage is generally studied from either a historical or sociological perspective while this paper deals with the subject from a legal point of view, and this is a novelty.

40|$|The pilgrimage {{route to}} St James {{is one of}} the oldest {{religious}} itineraries. The Camino (Way) came into being as a major pilgrim route in the Middle Ages. Although, in later centuries, it saw long periods of neglect, in the last fifty years, its potential has been rediscovered. It received formal and institutional recognition from the Council of Europe on 23 October 1987, as the first <b>European</b> <b>Cultural</b> <b>Route,</b> then, in 1993, it became a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Throughout this time, the final destination has remained the same, the city of Santiago de Compostela (declared a World Heritage Site in 1985), but the itinerary has turned into a polysemic cultural, tourist, monumental, spiritual and sport route. In view of such complexity, we examine how its original religious essence is undergoing semantic changes, which make it attractive for groups of different faiths and creeds, and with varying motivations. For this purpose, we study the tangible (huge monumental heritage) and intangible heritage (rituals and practices) that enriches and characterises this pilgrimage route. In explaining its polysemy, we will demonstrate why and how the Camino can satisfy the needs of pilgrims and tourists with different motivations and expectations. Finally, we set out the factors that determine the transferability of practices from the Way of St James to other European Cultural Itineraries, for instance the Via Francigena...|$|E
40|$|Since {{last two}} decades we notice an {{intensive}} growth of the pilgrimage movement along the Way os St. James. This route connecting furthests places in Europe and ending in Santiago de Compostela {{is based on a}} medieval transportation route called The Royal Route – Via Regia. The route exists for over 1000 years and is constantly developed thanks to actions taken by the authorities of the Catholic Church, governments and non-government organizations, as well as numerous enthusiastics of the Way of St. James. Since 1987, when the Council of Europe declared the pilgrimage route to Santiago de Compostela the first <b>European</b> <b>Cultural</b> <b>Route</b> we notice re-creation of former pilgrimage routes accros all european countries. The Way of St. James, marked on its whole lenght with the motif of the scallop shell, leads from Poland, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, France, Italy and ends in the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela in Spain at the tomb of St. James the Apostle. It is estimated that over 5 million people a year visit the sanctuary of St. James in Santiago de Compostela. Since the early ' 80 s the Pilgrims' Office of Archdiocese of Santiago de Compostela analyze the pilgrimage movement to the tomb of St. James. Basing on its research we should pointed out that vast majority of pilgrims who received the "Compostela" in 2010 (document confirming the pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela) came on foot. There are also pilgrims coming to the tomb of the first marthyr by bike, on horseback or even in a wheelchair. Although the Spanish are still the largest group of pilgrims, the Pilgrims' Office noticed a significant growth of foreign pilgrims. People undertake the pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela for various reasons: pure religious, cultural-religious or cultural motives. Currently, there is more than 3200 km of Camino de Santiago in Poland and they are divided into 16 sections. Polish part of the route meets Via Regia in Germany in Görlitz. The opening of the Way of St. James Via Regia from Korczowa (located on Polish-Ukrainian border) - hopefully will become a strong impulse to develop religious tourism on the medieval route to Kiev.
