For the Sin Salida show {{that was not the case}} Rush, La Sombra and Marco Corleone faced the tecnico team of Atlantis, Diamante Azul and Volador Jr. and Los Ingobernables clearly played the rudo part of the match, cheating whenever they had a chance including pulling Diamante Azul's mask off at one point and tearing Atlantis' mask apart. With Volador Jr. and La Sombra being bitter rivals for years it was no surprise that the two did not fight a clean match but both Rush and Corleone used underhanded tactics to win the match including a low kick to Volador Jr. to win the third and deciding fall. After the match Volador Jr. challenged La Sombra to put his mask on the line against Volador Jr.'s hair, a challenge turned down by La Sombra as he had already unmasked Volador Jr. Moments later Diamante Azul upped the challenge, Diamante Azul and Volador Jr. against La Sombra and Rush and Azul would put his mask on the line as well. The challenge was not accepted, nor declined by Los Ingorbernables at the time.|$|E

30|$|In fact, {{there are}} more than one <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> transported through the traffic network in reality. As we know, the {{transportation}} cost <b>of</b> one <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> can be affected by other <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> under the same traffic network. In detail, the flows <b>of</b> different <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> are not independent. For example, the transportation costs <b>of</b> one certain <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> is not only related with the flow and demand of itself, but also related with the flow and the demand of its substitution. Because the increasing of the flow and the demand of the substitution will put a whole lot of pressure on the transportation <b>of</b> the certain <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> under the same traffic network, the marginal cost will increase. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider the traffic equilibrium problem when there are many <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> transported through the same traffic network. Generally, we called this problem dynamic traffic network equilibrium system. In this paper, we introduce the equilibrium definition about this problem based on Wardrop's principles and propose a mathematical model about this traffic equilibrium problem in dynamic networks. We employ marginal costs rather than average costs in our research. Moreover, we also prove that the equilibrium conditions of this problem can be equivalently expressed as a system of evolutionary variational inequalities. Furthermore, we show the existence and uniqueness of the solution for this equilibrium problem. Finally, we give a numerical example to illustrate our results.|$|R

500|$|The {{main event}} of the 80th Anniversary show was not well {{received}} by the fans {{as they had been}} expecting a match between Atlantis and Último Guerrero, loudly chanting [...] "fraud" [...] during the main event. After the match the fans rallied behind Volador Jr., giving him the crowd support that made CMLL return him to the tecnico side. Conversely the fans began to boo and heckle La Sombra, the supposed tecnico, leading to a change in how La Sombra was booked and presented by CMLL. La Sombra formed a partnership with Rush and effectively began working as a rudo, though the two refused to acknowledge themselves as such, instead referring to themselves as [...] "técnicos diferentes" [...] ("a different <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> guy"). On June 6, La Sombra defeated Volador Jr. with help from Rush and La Máscara to win the NWA World Historic Welterweight Championship in a match, where La Sombra's Historic Middleweight Championship was also on the line. The trio of Sombra, Rush and La Máscara was eventually named Los Ingobernables ("The Ungovernables"). On August 1 at El Juicio Final, La Sombra lost the NWA World Historic Welterweight Championship back to Volador Jr. Later in August, La Sombra made it to the finals of the 2014 Universal Championship tournament, before losing to Último Guerrero. On May 1, 2015, La Sombra won the 2015 Reyes del Aire tournament ("Kings of the Air").|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the main}} storylines of 2014 for CMLL was the {{emergence}} of Los Ingobernables ("The Ungovernable" [...] or [...] "The Unruly") as a team, a storyline that had driven the main event of CMLL's two previous major shows Juicio Final and Homenaje a Dos Leyendas. The storyline stretched back into 2013 where the rudo Negro Casas began a rivalry with the tecnico Rush, a tecnico that worked a rougher, harder style and often experienced that the fans would boo him during his matches. By the end of 2013 the storyline began to also include Shocker, who turned rudo and sided with Casas in the feud. The storyline evolved over time and Rush, Casa and Shocker all agreed to a three-way match under Lucha de Apuestas ("Bet match") rules where the loser would be shaved bald. Later on Negro Casas {{dropped out of the}} match, declaring that he would rather face the winner and let Rush and Shocker fight each other at the 2014 Homenaje a Dos Leyendas show. Rush defeated Shocker, forcing Shocker to be shaved bald after the event and immediately set his sights on Negro Casas. While Rush had displayed less of a tecnico attitude during his matches against especially Shocker and Casas he never turned rudo as such. Following the Homenaje show Rush began teaming more and more with La Sombra, who was also displaying a more rudo attitude, announing themselves as [...] "técnicos diferentes" [...] ("A different <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> guy"). Soon after they were joined by La Máscara, to become a trio known as Los Indeseables ("The Undesirables"), later renamed Ingobernables ("Ungovernables"). Rush and La Máscara held the CMLL World Tag Team Championship {{at the time of the}} Ingorbernables creation, but would later lost the title to Negro Casas and Shocker. Following the title loss the focal point became a Luchas de Apuestas match between Rush and Negro Casas that was the main event of the 2014 Juicio Final show, a match that Rush won by underhanded means, forcing Negro Casas to be shaved bald. Following Juicio Final Los Ingorbernables became positioned to challenge La Peste Negra (Casas, El Felino and Mr. Niebla) for the Mexican National Trios Championship, but on September 6, 2014 CMLL announced that Rush and La Mascara would challenge Negro Casas and Shocker for the CMLL World Tag Team Championship as part of the 81st Anniversary show.|$|E
