30|$|The mean E for {{validation}} basins evaluated alone is 0.59 (0.69 for basins with reconstructed unimpaired flows), with the upper Klamath and small basins in the Modoc Plateau volcanics performing the poorest (Sprague River near Beatty OR E[*]=[*] 0.35; Figure  6 e). This is {{likely due to}} the large groundwater reservoir in the volcanics that has very long travel times from precipitation input to outflow in streams. The Sprague River basin also has a large <b>agricultural</b> <b>component</b> and return flows, so any attempt during calibration to maintain a match in volumes results in an overestimate of the peak flows.

40|$|Accurate {{and timely}} {{information}} on the global cropland extent is critical for food security monitoring, water management and earth system modeling.

40|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} from survey and cave excavation in the Towuti-Routa region of Sulawesi suggests the following sequence of late Holocene cultural change.

Extended inhumations are the oldest attested mortuary practice, overlapping in time with secondary burials in large earthenware jars dated to around a. d. 1000. The third, ethnohistorically described practice involved the surface disposal of the deceased, {{including the use of}} imported martavans for the elite, between approximately a. d. 1500 and 1900. This sequence of mortuary practices has not been documented elsewhere in Island Southeast Asia, although each practice has multiple parallels.

5000|$|Saskatchewan {{agricultural}} land comprises 44% {{of the total}} Canadian farmland. Excluding a semi-arid area of the southwest used for grazing the parkland and mixed prairie areas of the province are used for crop production, mixed farming and dairying. Grain farming dominates the parkland area. Saskatchewan usually produces about 54% of Canada's wheat. The vast extensions of unbroken plain are well-suited to large-scale mechanized farming. Wheat is the most familiar crop but other grains like canola, alfalfa, barley flax, mustard, vegetable farms, forage seed, potatoes rapeseed, rye, oats, peas, lentils, canary seed, and barley are also grown.

40|$|SUMMARY: This article {{analyses}} {{the evolution}} of European rural regional economies and the Commu-nity’s public regional policies, {{with a view to}} drawing lessons for other areas of the world, especially La-tin America. After presenting relative size data for the EU regions based on population, territory, employ-ment and income, the article analyses the key economic and social trends in these areas, together with the underlying explanatory factors. The main conclusion is that the economic development of the rural re-gions of the EU is much more due to the overall national economic development issues, than to rural de-velopment policies. Therefore, the way to achieve rural development is by means of a good overall eco-nomic development policy, and national policies are more determining than EU-wide policies in the overall economic development of the EU member states. The article finishes with a summary of the les-sons to be learnt from EU rural development policy, which suggest the need for radical policy change ba-sed on a reduction in the <b>agricultural</b> <b>component</b> coupled with an increase in the territorial and environ-mental components...|$|R
