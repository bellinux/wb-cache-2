5|$|Bergen Street was {{originally}} designed as an express station, {{but only the}} upper level is currently in service; the lower level is neither in regular service nor usable due to its <b>deteriorated</b> <b>condition.</b> The lower level of the station was used when express service was provided on the Culver Line between 1968 and 1976. Express service was eliminated due {{to the loss of}} direct local service along the line to Manhattan. The express platforms were permanently removed from service during the 1990s, and due to a fire in 1999 the relay room was damaged, making the express tracks unusable. The relay room was rebuilt in 2008, and after repairs were done on the line, the implementation of express service become feasible. In 2016, it was announced that the MTA was considering having express service brought back to the line. However, unlike the earlier express service, express trains will skip this station due to the high cost of rebuilding it, thus making the station a local stop.|$|E

5|$|While The Hobbit {{has been}} adapted and {{elaborated}} upon in many ways, its sequel The Lord of the Rings is often {{claimed to be}} its greatest legacy. The plots share the same basic structure progressing in the same sequence: the stories begin at Bag End, the home of Bilbo Baggins; Bilbo hosts a party that sets the novel's main plot into motion; Gandalf sends the protagonist into a quest eastward; Elrond offers a haven and advice; the adventurers escape dangerous creatures underground (Goblin Town/Moria); they engage another group of elves (The Elvenking's realm/Lothlórien); they traverse a desolate region (Desolation of Smaug/the Dead Marshes); they are received and nourished by a small settlement of men (Lake-town/Ithilien); they fight in a massive battle (The Battle of Five Armies/Battle of Pelennor Fields); their journey climaxes within an infamous mountain peak (Lonely Mountain/Mount Doom); a descendant of kings is restored to his ancestral throne (Bard/Aragorn); and the questing party returns home to find it in a <b>deteriorated</b> <b>condition</b> (having possessions auctioned off/the scouring of the Shire).|$|E
5|$|After the war, Camäleon and Cyclop were {{stricken}} {{from the}} naval register owing to their <b>deteriorated</b> <b>condition</b> and were broken up. Throughout the 1870s, the remaining {{members of the}} class performed a variety of tasks, including conducting cartographic surveys, weapons testing with new self-propelled torpedoes, and fishery protection duties. In 1873, Delphin was sent to Spain to protect German nationals during the Third Carlist War. Basilisk was hulked in 1875 and used to store naval mines until at least 1900. Blitz was also reduced to a hulk in 1876 but was scrapped two years later. Meteor and Comet were stationed in the Mediterranean during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877 to protect Germans in the Ottoman Empire. Later that year, Meteor returned to Germany and was sunk as a target ship. Comet and Delphin were discarded in 1881; the former was hulked in 1881 and broken up some time after 1891, while Delphin was simply scrapped after being stricken. Drache was the last surviving member of the class in service, conducting survey work until September 1887, when she too was stricken from the register and sunk as a target ship.|$|E

In December 2008 the monument was removed from the national cemetery for conservation treatment due to its <b>deteriorated</b> <b>condition.</b> It was relocated indoors at the Frazier History Museum in Louisville in August 2010 as a long-term loan from the National Cemetery Administration. Although the stone monument has been moved from its original location, it is generally considered to be the oldest surviving American Civil War monument in the United States. A replacement monument to the 32nd Indiana was dedicated at Cave Hill National Cemetery on December 16, 2011.|$|E

He cut worn-out edges, glued it to a hard paper and then filled the cracks with corresponding colors. The painter of the portrait was Ludwig von Maydell, from Dorpat University. He painted it in the fall of 1830, when Abovian was only 20 or 21 years old. This portrait is the only painting of Abovian made during his lifetime.|$|E

The pilot of '458' then performed an aileron roll, a flight maneuver that rolled the aircraft 360° {{in order to}} allow the pilot to observe any air traffic above or below the aircraft. Lt. Schiess, the Radar Intercept Officer, was operating the fighter's radar, which was unable to detect any aircraft due to its <b>deteriorated</b> <b>condition.</b> Because of the stowed position of the scope, he had been leaning forward and looking downward at the instrument. Between three and ten seconds prior to the collision, he glanced up and observed the DC-9 in his peripheral vision and shouted a warning to the pilot.

500|$|During {{the course}} of the {{accident}} investigation, the NTSB attempted to recreate the conditions of the accident to determine the visibility of BuNo458 on June 6. They also calculated that their closing rate was about 1000ft/s, similar to the muzzle velocity of a [...]45 caliber gun. The NTSB, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and the Marine Corps flew a series of F-4B fighters along the flight paths described by Lt. Schiess, the radar intercept officer, and various witnesses. While the tests were sufficient to determine the difficulty in locating and identifying the fighter on the radar scope, the many other variables involved in the June 6 incident, including the <b>deteriorated</b> <b>condition</b> of '458', compromised the validity of the study. This inability to ascertain the exact actions and circumstances of the [...] air traffic controllers led the NTSB to recommend that the FAA install both video and audio surveillance in all air traffic control areas.|$|E
