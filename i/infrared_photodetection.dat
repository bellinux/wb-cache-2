The rise of two-dimensional (2 D) materials, thanks to their distinct electronic structure, extreme dimensional confinement and strong light-matter interactions, provides new material platform for next-generation <b>infrared</b> <b>photodetection.</b> Ideal infrared detectors should have fast respond, high sensitivity and air-stability, which is rare to meet {{at the same time}} for all existing 2 D materials, either graphene, transition metal dichalcogenide or black phosphorous.

40|$|Metallic {{nanoparticles}} support collective oscillations of conduction-band electrons, {{in response}} to light incidences. Such phenomenon is called localized surface plasmons, which confine large electromagnetic fields in sub-wavelength dimensions, enabling the light manipulation at the nanoscale. Plasmonic nanoparticles have established many promising applications, such as <b>infrared</b> <b>photodetections,</b> photothermal generation steam, chemical photocatalysis, cancer therapy and surface-enhanced spectroscopy. More interesting, plasmonic nanostructures could generate strong nonlinear-optical effects by relatively low excitation powers, and {{have been widely used}} in different processes like second-harmonic generations (SHG), difference-frequency generation (DFG), third-harmonic generation (THG), optical four-wave mixing (FWM) and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). This thesis will focused on two types of second-order and two types of third-order nonlinear-optical processes, enhanced by artificial plasmonic nanostructures. Firstly, the second-harmonic generation on a single nanocup is studied, and the signal is demonstrated to have increasing intensity as the 3 D symmetry of the nanocup is reduced. Then, optical four-wave mixing is generated on a plasmonic nanocluster which supports a coherent oscillation of two Fano resonances. The electric fields from both Fano resonances add coherently resulting in strong fields and correspondingly large signals. This nanocluster has a large color-conversion efficiency, and could be used for building blocks of optical processors that convert two input colors into a third color. Later, one specific application of four-wave mixing, the coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) is studied. By exploiting the unique light harvesting properties of a Fano resonance of a specially designed nano-quadrumer, the surface-enhanced CARS (SECARS) technique amplifies the Raman signals of molecules on the quadrumer by about 100 billion times. This enables the accurate identification of a single molecule with less than 20 atoms. Finally, a plasmon-enhanced optical parametric amplifier (OPA) is designed: A BaTiO 3 nanosphere is used as the nonlinear OPA medium; A nanoshell wrapping this nanosphere is used as a triply resonant cavity for all the pump, signal and idler beams; The generated idler beam has a wide tuning range in the near-infrared by changing the delay between the narrowband pump beam and broadband signal beam.

Incorporating nanowires as active media could enable an independent {{control over the}} electrical and the optical device cross-sections. Furthermore, the three-dimensional carrier confinement in nanowire heterostructures opens new possibilities to tune the carrier relaxation time. However, the generation of structural defects and the surface sensitivity of GaAs nanowires have so far hindered the fabrication of nanowire intersubband devices. Here, we report the first demonstration of intersubband photodetection in a nanowire, using GaN nanowires containing a GaN/AlN superlattice absorbing at 1. 55 μm. We observe a linear dependence of the photocurrent with the incident illumination power, which confirms the insensitivity of the intersubband process to surface charges.

30|$|Copper oxide (CuO), {{as one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} metal oxide semiconductors, has been widely used because of its abundance in resources and low cost in synthesis. Low-dimensional CuO nanostructures (zero-dimensional and one-dimensional nanostructures) are used, in particular via simple thermal evaporation method [20], wet chemical method [21], and metal-assisted growth method [22]. It has been found that the CuO NWs obtained from the above methods normally have good crystallinity and high aspect ratio, which renders them attractive and promising building blocks for fabricating high-performance electronic devices systems [23]. For example, Chang et al. reported the growth of CuO NWs on an oxidized Cu wire at 500 °C for <b>infrared</b> (IR) <b>photodetection</b> application. The as-obtained high density of CuO NWs on the Cu wire was highly sensitive to IR light illumination (wavelength: 808  nm), with rise-time and fall-time of 15 and 17  s, respectively [24]. Zhou et al. presented a vertically aligned CuO NWs array-based ultrasensitive sensors for H 2 S detection with a detection limit as low as 500  ppb. It was revealed that the high sensitivity was due to the formation of highly conductive CuS layer when H 2 S gas was introduced into the detection chamber [25]. Zheng et al. developed a simple and effective catalyst system comprised of CuO NWs for CO oxidation. They found that CO oxidation percentage was as high as 85 % after Ar or H 2 plasma treatment [5]. In addition to these device applications, it has been observed that highly-aligned CuO NW arrays are good candidates for field emission due to their low turn-on voltages, high current output [26].|$|R

40|$|Spintronic devices usually rely on long spin {{relaxation}} times and/or lengths {{for optimum}} performance. Therefore, {{the ability to}} modulate these quantities with an external agent offers unique possibilities. The dominant spin relaxation mechanism in most technologically important semiconductors is the D'yakonov-Perel' (DP) mechanism which vanishes if the spin carriers (electrons) are confined to a single conduction subband in a quantum wire grown in certain crystallographic directions, or polycrystalline quantum wires. Here, we report modulating the DP spin relaxation rate (and hence the spin relaxation length) in self assembled 50 -nm diameter InSb nanowires with infrared light at room temperature. In the dark, almost all the electrons in the nanowires are in the lowest conduction subband at room temperature, resulting in near-complete absence of DP relaxation. This allows observation of spin-sensitive effects in the magnetoresistance. Under infrared illumination, electrons are photoexcited to higher subbands and the DP spin relaxation mechanism is revived, leading to a three-fold decrease in the spin relaxation length.

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. Silicon {{is at the}} heart of all of the {{end-user}} digital devices such as smart phones, laptops, and wearable technologies. It is the holy grail for the largescale production of semiconductor devices since start of the semiconductor era due to its relatively good electrical, mechanical and chemical properties. Silicon’s mediocre optical properties also make it an acceptable material for energy harvesting and ultraviolet photodetection applications. But its relatively large bandgap (1. 12 eV) makes it infrared blind. So Silicon photodetectors fail to detect infrared light using traditional techniques. Hence, an all-Silicon solution is of interest for low-cost civil applications like telecommunication and imaging. Silicon based Schottky junction is a promising candidate for <b>infrared</b> <b>photodetection.</b> Internal photoemission is the main mechanism of photodetection in the Schottky junctions. Incident photons elevate the kinetic energy of the electrons in the metal so that the energetic electrons can jump over the Schottky barrier or tunnel through it. Carefully designed metal contact of the Schottky junction can, at the same time, give rise to hot electron generation through plasmon resonances. Here we introduce ultra-low-cost broad-band near-infrared Silicon photodetectors with a study over types of metal and nanostructures and fabrication techniques. The devices exhibit photoresponsivity as high as 2 mA/W and 600 µA/W at 1300 nm and 1550 nm wavelengths, and can see beyond 2000 nm wavelengths. Their dark current density is as low as 50 pA/µm 2. Simplicity and scalability of fabrication in this type of structures make them the most cost effective infrared detectors due to lack of expensive fabrication steps such as sub-micron lithography and high temperature epitaxial growth techniques.

From small clusters to large NCs containing {{on the order}} of several thousand atoms are considered. Effective band-gap values as a function of NC diameter reproduce very well the available experimental and theoretical data. It is observed that the highest occupied molecular orbital for both Si and Ge NCs and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital for Si NCs display oscillations with respect to size among the different irreducible representations of the $C_{ 3 v}$ point group to which these spherical NCs belong. Based on this electronic structure, first the interband absorption is thoroughly studied which shows the importance of surface polarization effects that significantly reduce the absorption when included. This reduction is found to increase with decreasing NC size or with increasing permittivity mismatch between the NC core and the host matrix. Reasonable agreement is observed with the experimental absorption spectra where available. The deformation of spherical NCs into prolate or oblate ellipsoids are seen to introduce no pronounced effects for the absorption spectra.

40|$|The {{ability to}} detect {{infrared}} radiation is vital {{for a host of}} applications that include optical communication, medical diagnosis, thermal imaging, atmospheric monitoring, and space science. The need to actively cool infrared photon detectors increases their operation cost and weight, and the focus of much recent research has been to limit the dark current and create room-temperature infrared photodetectors appropriate for mid-to-long-wave infrared detection. Quantum dot infrared photodetectors (QDIPs) provide electron quantum confinement in three dimensions and have been shown to demonstrate high temperature operation (T> 150 K) due to lower dark currents. However, these inorganic devices have not achieved sensitivity comparable to state-of-the-art photon detectors, {{due in large part to}} the inability to control the uniformity (size and shape) of QDs during strained-layer epitaxy. The purpose of this dissertation research was to investigate the feasibility of room-temperature <b>infrared</b> <b>photodetection</b> that could overcome the shortfalls of QDIPs by using chemically synthesized inorganic colloidal quantum dots (CQDs). CQDs are coated with organic molecules known as surface ligands that prevent the agglomeration of dots while in solution. When CQDs are suspended in a semiconducting organic polymer, these materials are known as organic/inorganic hybrid nanocomposites. The novel approach investigated in this work was to use intraband transitions in the conduction band of the polymer-embedded CQD for room-temperature photodetection in the mid-wave, and possibly long-wave, infrared ranges. Hybrid nanocomposite materials promise room-temperature operation due to: (i) large bandgaps of the inorganic CQDs and the semiconducting polymer that reduce thermionic emission; and (ii) low dark current due to the three-dimensional electron confinement in the CQD and low carrier mobility in the semiconducting polymer. The primary material system investigated in this research was CdSe CQDs embedded in the conjugated polymer poly[2 -methoxy- 5 -(2 '-ethylhexyloxy) - 1, 4 -(1 -cyanovinylene) phenylene] (MEH-CN-PPV). Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy of MEH-CN-PPV thin films was conducted to determine the dependence of polymer morphology on deposition method in order to identify a reliable device fabrication technique. Three different deposition methods were investigated: drop-casting and spin-casting, which are solution-based; and matrix-assisted pulsed laser evaporation (MAPLE), which is a vacuum-based method that gently evaporates polymers (or hybrid nanocomposites) and limits substrate exposure to solvents. It was found that MAPLE deposition provides repeatable control of the thin film morphology and thickness, which is important for nanocomposite device optimization. Ultra-fast PL spectroscopy of MEH-CN-PPV/CdSe thin films was investigated to determine the charge generation and relaxation dynamics in the hybrid nanocomposite thin films. The mathematical fitting of time-integrated and time-resolved PL provided a rigorous and unique model of the charge dynamics, which enabled calculation of the radiative and non-radiative decay lifetimes in the polymer and CQD. These results imply that long-lived electrons exist in the conduction band of the CQD, which demonstrate that it should be possible to generate a mid- to long-wave infrared photocurrent based on intraband transitions. In fact, room-temperature, intraband, mid-infrared absorption was measured in thin films of MEH-CN-PPV/CdSe hybrid nanocomposites by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) absorbance spectroscopy. In addition, the hybrid nanocomposite confined energy levels and corresponding oscillator strengths were calculated in order to model the absorption spectrum. The calculated absorption peaks agree well with the measured peaks, demonstrating that the developed computer model provides a useful design tool for determining the impact of important materials system properties, such as CQD size, organic surface ligand material choice, and conduction band offset due to differences in CQD and polymer electron affinities. Finally, a room-temperature, two terminal, hybrid nanocomposite mid-infrared photoconductor based on intraband transitions was demonstrated by FTIR spectral response measurements, measuring a spectral responsivity peak of 4. 32 µA/W at 5. 5 µm (5 volts), and calibrated blackbody spectral photocurrent measurements, measuring a spectral responsivity peak of 4. 79 µA/W at 5. 7 µm (22 volts). This device characterization demonstrated that while the novel approach of intraband <b>infrared</b> <b>photodetection</b> in hybrid nanocomposites is feasible, significant challenges exist related to device fabrication and operation. Future work is proposed that could address some of these important issues. Dissertatio...|$|E

The state-of-the-art photodetectors based on Hg 1 -xCdxTe (MCT) have large signal over noise ratio and their bandgap can be tuned to span 1 - 32 μm wavelength range. However, large tunneling and Auger dark currents due to low {{electron effective mass}} in MCT detectors require operation at cryogenic temperatures (77 - 100 K). The cooling requirement limits the lifetime, adds weight and expense and increases the power consumption of the infrared system. There is {{a concerted effort to}} develop photonic detectors operating at higher temperatures. InAs/GaSb strained layer superlattice (SLS) photodectors are now considered as a promising technology for both MWIR and LWIR wavelength ranges. The bandgap of the SLS can be adjusted by controlling the thickness of the constituent InAs and GaSb layers during the growth process. InAs/GaSb SLS can also span the 3 - 30 μm wavelength range. Moreover, the large splitting of the energy levels of the different valence subbands in SLS contribute to the suppression of Auger recombination. The recently proposed nBn heterostructure design has demonstrated a 100 K increase in background-limited <b>infrared</b> <b>photodetection</b> (BLIP) for InAs-based device, by decreasing Shockley-Read-Hall generation currents and by suppressing surface currents using specific processing. This work is focused on combining the nBn detector design with InAs/GaSb superlattice material utilizing an AlGaSb barrier layer to improve detector performance and to increase the operating temperature of Focal Plane Arrays. This thesis covers three topics: Optical and electrical characteristics of single pixel devices in both the MWIR and LWIR, the reduction of surface leakage currents by using a shallow isolation etch for definition of the top contact mesa and comparison between nBn detector and PIN LWIR detectors.

40|$|Quantum Dot Infrared Photodetector (QDIP) Focal Plane Arrays (FPAs) {{have been}} {{proposed}} as an alternative technology for the 3 rd generation FPAs. QDIPs are emerging as a competitive technology for infrared detection and imaging especially in the midwave infrared (MWIR) and longwave infrared (LWIR) regime. These detectors are based on intersubband transitions in self-assembled InAs quantum dots (QDs) and offer several advantages such as normal incidence detection, low dark currents and high operating temperatures, while enjoying all {{the benefits of a}} mature GaAs fabrication technology. However, due to Stranski-Krastanov (SK) growth mode and the subsequent capping growth, the conventional SK QDs are “pancake shaped” with small height to base ratio due to interface diffusion. Thus they cannot fully exploit the 3 D “artificial atom” properties. This dissertation work investigates two approaches for shape engineered QDs: (1) Selective capping techniques of Stranski-Krastanov QDs, and (2) Growth of Sub-Monolayer (SML) QDs. Using Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) growth, engineered QDs have been demonstrated with improved dot geometry and 3 D quantum confinement to more closely resemble the 3 D “artificial atom”. In SK-QDs, the results have demonstrated an increased dot height to base aspect ratio of 0. 67 compared with 0. 23 for conventional SK-QD using Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) images, enhanced s-to-p polarized spectral response ratio of 37 % compared with 10 % for conventional SK-QD, and improved SK-QDIP characterization such as: high operating temperature of 150 K under background-limited <b>infrared</b> <b>photodetection</b> (BLIP) condition, photodetectivity of 1 × 109 cmHz 1 / 2 /W at 77 K for a peak wavelength of 4. 8 μm, and photoconductive gain of 100 (Vb= 12 V) at 77 K. In SML-QDs, we have demonstrated dots with a small base width of 4 ~ 6 nm, height of 8 nm, absence of wetting layer and advantage optical property than the SK-QDs. SML-QD shows adjustable dot height to base aspect ratio of 8 nm/ 6 nm, increased s-to-p polarized spectral response ratio of 33 %, and a narrower full width at half maximum (FWHM), long wavelength 10. 5 μm bound-to-bound intersubband transition, and higher responsivity of 1. 2 A/W at - 2. 2 V at 77 K and detectivity of 4 × 109 cmHz 1 / 2 /W at 0. 4 V 77 K. the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR), and Korea Research Institute of Standard and Science (KRISS), and the Intelligence Community (IC) Postdoctoral ProgramElectrical EngineeringDoctoralUniversity of New Mexico.

40|$|Infrared (IR) photodetectors {{are useful}} {{for a variety of}} {{military}} and civil applications such as target acquisition, medical diagnostics, pollution monitoring, to name just a few. Presently photonic IR detectors are based on interband transitions in low bandgap semiconductors such as mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) or InSb or in intersubband transitions in hetero-engineered structures such as quantum well or quantum dot infrared photodetectors (QWIPs or QDIPs). These detectors operate at low temperatures (77 K- 200 K) in order to obtain high signal to noise ratio. The cooling requirement limits the lifetime, increases the weight and the total cost, as well as the power budget, of the whole infrared system. There is a concerted effort to develop photonic detectors operating at higher temperatures. In the past few years, interband transitions in type II InAs/GaSb strain layer superlattices (SL) have emerged as a competing technology among other IR systems. Although MCT and QWIP technologies are relatively more mature than the SL technology, the SL technology has potential to enhance performance in several key areas. One of the main advantages of this system {{lies in the fact that}} the effective band gap of the SL can be tailored over a wide range (3 μm < λc < 30 μm) by varying the thickness of two “mid bandgap” constituent materials, namely GaSb and InAs. Tunneling currents in SL are reduced due to a larger electron effective mass. Large splitting between heavy-hole and light-hole valence subbands due to strain in the SLs contributes to the suppression of Auger recombination. Moreover, the band structure of the SL can be engineered to enhance carrier lifetimes and reduce noise at higher temperatures. SL based IR detectors have demonstrated high quantum efficiency, high temperature operation, and are suitable for incorporation in focal plane arrays (FPA) by tapping into the mature III-V based growth and fabrication processes. The recently proposed nBn heterostructure design has demonstrated a 100 K increase in background-limited <b>infrared</b> <b>photodetection</b> (BLIP) for InAs-based device, by decreasing Shockley-Read-Hall generation currents and by suppressing surface currents using specific processing. Third generation IR detectors have three main emphases, high operating temperature (HOT), multicolor capability, and large format arrays. This work concentrates on multicolor and HOT IR detectors based on nBn design. Contributions of this thesis include 1. Development of design and growth procedure for the long-wave (LW) SL detectors leading to an improved detector performance: 13 MLs of InAs and 7 MLs of GaSb with InSb strain compensating layer were designed and optimized for LW SL detectors. LWIR pin and nBn detectors were introduced and their optical and electrical properties were compared. LW nBn detectors show higher device performance in terms of lower dark current density and higher responsivity as compared to the LW pin detectors. The reduction in dark current in LW nBn detector is due to reduction of SRH centers as well as surface leakage currents. The increase in responsivity for LW nBn detectors is due to reduction non-radiative SRH recombination. 2. Design, growth and characterization of bi-color nBn detectors: Present day two color SL detectors require two contacts per pixel leading to a complicated processing scheme and expensive read out integrated circuits (ROICs). The nBn architecture was modified to realize a dual-band response by changing the polarity of applied bias using single contact processing. The spectral response shows a significant change in the LWIR to MWIR ratio within a very small bias range (∼ 100 mV) making it compatible with commercially available ROICs. 3. Investigation of background carrier concentration in SLs: The electrical transport in SLs was investigated in order to improve the collection efficiency and understand SL devices performance operating at ambient temperature. For this purpose background carrier concentration of type-II InAs/GaSb SLs on GaAs substrates are studied. The hall measurements on mid-wave SLs revealed that the conduction in the MWIR SLs is dominated by holes at low temperatures (200 K) and is dominated by electrons at all temperatures for LWIR SLs possibly due to the thicker InAs (residually n-type) and thinner GaSb (residually p-type) layers. By studying the in-plane transport characteristics of LW SLs grown at different temperatures, it was shown that interface roughness scattering is the dominant scattering mechanism at higher temperatures (200 K- 300 K).
