40|$|This paper {{examines}} the plausibility of mesoscale eddy generation through local baroclinic instability of weak midocean gyre flows. The main tool is a statistically steady, two-layer quasigeostrophic turbulence model {{driven by an}} imposed, horizontally homogeneous, vertically sheared mean flow and dissipated by bottom Ekman friction. A wide range of friction strengths is investigated. In the weakly <b>damped</b> <b>limit,</b> flow is nearly barotropic, and the horizontal length scale of barotropic energy increases with decreasing friction, consistent with previous studies. The strongly <b>damped</b> <b>limit,</b> explored {{here for the first}} time, is equivalent barotropic (lower-layer velocities are nearly zero) and features an increase in the horizontal scale of potential energy with increasing friction. Current-meter data suggest that midocean eddies lie between the barotropic and equivalent barotropic limits. In accord with this suggestion, the moderately damped regime of the model compares well to observations of eddy amplitude, vertical structure, and horizontal scale, especially when stratification is surface intensified. A review of pertinent observations suggests that mesoscale eddies may indeed lie in the moderately <b>damped</b> <b>limit.</b> These arguments are first developed in f -plane simulations. Previous studies of beta-plane turbulence have had eastward mean flows, and in this case eddy energy has little sensitivity to friction. However, midocean gyre flows are generally nonzonal, and this nonzonality appears to be a significant factor in the production of energetic eddies. Beta-plane turbulence driven by nonzonal mean flows is sensitive to bottom friction, such that moderate damping is required for model eddies to compare well to observations, as on the f plane. A heuristic argument is presented in support of this similarity...|$|R

40|$|We analyze {{in detail}} the highly damped quasinormal modes of d-dimensional Reissner-Nordström black holes with small charge, paying {{particular}} attention to the large but finite <b>damping</b> <b>limit</b> in which the Schwarzschild results should be valid. In the infinite <b>damping</b> <b>limit,</b> we confirm using different methods the results obtained previously in the literature for higher dimensional Reissner-Nordström black holes. Using a combination of analytic and numerical techniques we also calculate the transition of the real part of the quasinormal mode frequency from the Reissner-Nordström value for very large damping to the Schwarzschild value of (3) T_bh for intermediate damping. The real frequency does not interpolate smoothly between the two values. Instead there is a critical value of the damping at which the topology of the Stokes/anti-Stokes lines change, and the real part of the quasinormal mode frequency dips to zero.

These ratchet systems exhibit giant coherence of transport in the regime of parameter space where unidirectional currents in the deterministic case are observed. Outside this parameter range, i. e., when current vanishes in the deterministic regime, coherence in transport is very low.

40|$|The {{longitudinal}} {{relaxation time}} of the magnetization {{of a system of}} two exchange coupled spins subjected to a strong magnetic field is calculated exactly by averaging the stochastic Gilbert-Landau-Lifshitz equation for the magnetization, i. e., the Langevin equation of the process, over its realizations so reducing the problem to a system of linear differential-recurrence relations for the statistical moments (averaged spherical harmonics). The system is solved in the frequency domain by matrix continued fractions yielding the complete solution of the two-spin problem in external fields for all values of the damping and barrier height parameters.

40|$|Abstract — This {{research}} compares {{walking over}} ground, on a split-belt treadmill, on a tied-belt treadmill, {{and on the}} Gait Enhancing Mobile Shoe (GEMS) in both humans and simulated on a passive dynamic model. Passive Dynamic Walkers (PDW) have been researched for decades, yet only recently has the model been used significantly in gait rehabilitation. We aim to identify how well the two-dimensional PDW {{can be used as}} a kinematic approximation tool for gait analysis. In this work, the PDW was scaled according to an anthropomorphic human model. For comparison, measurements were taken of humans walking in the same four environments. For normal walking, the PDW was found to be a good approximation for symmetric and rhythmic hip position, foot position, and velocity profiles. Tied-belt and split-belt treadmill model estimations revealed that the PDW’s lack of dorsiflexion, joint stiffness, and joint <b>damping</b> <b>limited</b> the comparison, however trends between the human and the model agreed.

The dynamic response of a hysteretic shear beam type structure with viscoelastic dampers under random seismic excitation is first evaluated in the state space utilizing stochastic response analysis and equivalent linearization technique. By taking the maximum story drift {{as a measure of}} structure limit state and the maximum deformation of viscoelastic material as a measure of <b>damper</b> <b>limit</b> state, the failure probabilities of the structure and viscoelastic dampers either for a given earthquake event or during the entire service time are then estimated using the first-order reliability method and the response surface approach for the system with and without uncertainties, respectively.

It is found that the existence of uncertainties reduces the reliability of the building but the installation of viscoelastic dampers of proper parameters significantly enhances the reliability of the building.

40|$|Abstract — Squeeze film damping is a {{major source}} of noise in MEMS structures. Since <b>damping</b> <b>limits</b> the sensing {{accuracy}} of a given MEMS structure, a model relating design parameters to the damping coefficient is critical so that the system may be optimized. Several successful squeeze-film damping models exist [1 - 3]. While certain models are able to accommodate complicated edge effects [2] and perforations [3], {{to the best of our}} knowledge, none have addressed substrate proximity effects. This paper introduces a simplified squeeze-film macro-model for a lateral parallel-plate sensing structure (Fig. 1) that takes into account substrate proximity effects. Second order considerations such as edge effects, compressibility effects, Couette flow damping (between the substrate and the laterally moving mass), and non-zero slip conditions are not included here as they have been successfully addressed elsewhere [1 - 4]. Substrate proximity effects are approximated by modeling the gap separating the mass and substrate as a channel. Despite its many simplifications, our model delivers sufficient accuracy for hand-analysis as needed during initial design steps.

For such an initial state, the efficiency is enhanced in the weak <b>damping</b> <b>limit</b> (⟨t⟩∼ 1 /Γ), and suppressed in the strong <b>damping</b> <b>limit</b> (⟨t⟩∼Γ), analogous to Kramers turnover in classical rate theory.

In the presence of static disorder, the scaling law of transfer time with respect to dephasing rate changes from linear to square root, suggesting a weaker dependence on the environment.
