In this study, incorporation mechanisms of nickel and copper by kaolinite and the other aluminum- or iron-rich precursors commonly found in clays were investigated under different thermal conditions. NiAl 2 O 4, CuAl 2 O 4, and NiFe 2 O 4 were the product phases of a 3 -h sintering process, with these quantities evaluated by the quantitative X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique. High metal transformation ratios were found, and the efficiencies were generally enhanced when the sintering temperature was increased.

This compact process {{was designed for}} the separation of transuranics (TRU) and radionuclides from the liquid waste streams that exist at many DOE sites, with an overall reduction in waste volume requiring disposal. The MACS process combines the selectivity afforded by solvent extractant/ion exchange materials with magnetic separation to provide an efficient chemical separation. Recently, the MACS process has been evaluated with acidic organophosphorus extractants for <b>hazardous</b> <b>metal</b> recovery from <b>waste</b> solutions. Moreover, process scale-up design issues have been addressed with respect to particle filtration and recovery. Two acidic organophosphorus compounds have been investigated for <b>hazardous</b> <b>metal</b> recovery, bis(2, 4, 4 -trimethylpentyl) phosphinic acid (Cyanex{reg_sign} 272) and bis(2, 4, 4 -trimethylpentyl) dithiophosphinic acid (Cyanex{reg_sign} 301).

40|$|This study {{proposed}} and evaluated a waste-to-resource strategy for beneficially using solid waste as ceramic raw materials. The sludge generated from waterworks and sewage treatment processes contains {{significant amounts of}} aluminum and iron, and the industrial sludge is enriched with high <b>metal</b> content. The <b>hazardous</b> <b>metals</b> in <b>waste</b> sludge may lead to metal bioaccumulation and cause adverse effects for ecosystem. This study aims to stabilize copper- and zinc-laden sludge in commonly available ceramic products, and to beneficially use waterworks and sewage sludge to incorporate <b>waste</b> <b>metals.</b> The study was first investigated by sintering simulated metal-laden sludge with Al-rich (γ-Al 2 O 3, -Al 2 O 3, kaolinite, mullite) and Fe-rich (Fe 2 O 3) precursors. Secondly, the practicability of recycling Cu-bearing electroplating sludge {{as a part of}} ceramic raw materials was evaluated through thermal interaction with Al-rich precursors. Furthermore, the potential of using water and sewage treatment works sludge to stabilize metals were also examined. Sintering procedures were carried out within 650 - 1450 oC for 3 h, and phase transformations were studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD) with the quantification technique of Rietveld refinement analysis. The formation of CuAl 2 O 4 spinel was initiated at 650 oC using γ-Al 2 O 3, and the maximum copper transformation reached 80 %. The copper incorporation into CuAl 2 O 4 started at 850 oC and reached 95 % in -Al 2 O 3 system. The growth of CuAl 2 O 4 was found at 750 oC using kaolinite, but at 900 oC in mullite system. The maximum copper transformation for both kaolinite and mullite reached ~ 80 %. With CuAl 2 O 4, decomposing, the formation of CuAlO 2 predominated in alumina systems, but CuO and Cu 2 O were found in kaolinite and mullite systems. When using Fe 2 O 3, the CuFe 2 O 4 with tetragonal structure was observed at lower temperatures, and the cubic CuFe 2 O 4 became predominant at 1000 oC. The formation of ZnAl 2 O 4 spinel started at 750 oC in γ-Al 2 O 3 system and at 950 oC in -Al 2 O 3 system, respectively. The zinc transformation completed in both γ-Al 2 O 3 and -Al 2 O 3 systems at higher temperatures. The coexistence and competition between ZnAl 2 O 4 and Zn 2 SiO 4 were found using kaolinite and mullite. The increase of temperature to 1350 °C resulted in complete zinc transformation to ZnAl 2 O 4 in mullite system. Through leaching tests, aluminates and ferrites were found to be superior to oxide and silicate phases in immobilizing <b>hazardous</b> <b>metals.</b> The leachates of aluminates and ferrites exhibited the behavior of incongruent dissolution, and the Zn 2 SiO 4 leachate showed congruent dissolution. The CuAl 2 O 4 spinel was observed when sintering Cu-laden electroplating sludge with aluminate precursors. The copper leachability decreased with CuAl 2 O 4 developing and the lowest copper concentration in leachates was within the optimal temperature range for CuAl 2 O 4 generation. Both copper and zinc were successfully incorporated into the spinel structure using waterworks sludge, and the cubic CuFe 2 O 4 became the main component when using sewage sludge to stabilize copper. Overall, this study demonstrated a promising process to stabilize <b>hazardous</b> <b>metals</b> in <b>waste</b> materials, such as sludge, ash, and slag, through sintering with the inexpensive ceramic precursors. This may provide an avenue for economically reduce the environmental hazards of toxic metals by reliably blending them into the marketable ceramic products. published_or_final_versionCivil EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

40|$|An {{issue of}} {{continuing}} environmental {{concern is the}} migration of potentially <b>hazardous</b> <b>metals</b> in <b>waste</b> containment facilities to the subsurface. Geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs) are now well recognised {{as an alternative to}} traditional compacted clay liners. Past research has established the use of clays for attenuating metallic contaminants; however the attenuation capacity of GCLs for metals remains in question. This paper describes research aimed at characterizing GCL behaviour in the presence of metal-rich permeants and assess their potential for metal attenuation in order to evaluate their potential use in different waste containment scenarios. To date, the migration of select metals (Al, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Cd, Cu, Zn) have been investigated using continuous flow permeameters and diffusion testing {{in the presence of a}} municipal solid waste leachate and an acid mine drainage solution. The ability of the GCL to attenuate metals was measured by monitoring aqueous solutions before and after the experiment and by bulk analysis of the GCL itself. In predicting the long-term performance of the GCL, it is important to examine the mechanism of metal attenuation such as the role of adsorption onto bentonite, sorption onto Fe and Mn hydroxides and the effect of reducing conditions on the long-term stability of these hydroxides. Delayed breakthrough times and material analysis have shown evidence of metal attenuation and insights into adsorption mechanisms have been made. Material analysis to date has included constituent analysis of digested GCL soil, soil pore water analysis and X-ray diffraction.

During the past year, Ceramicrete{trademark} technology was implemented for field application at ANL-West. Debris wastes were treated and stabilized: (a) Hg-contaminated low-level radioactive crushed light bulbs and (b) low-level radioactive Pb-lined gloves (part of the MWIR {number_sign} AW-W 002 waste stream). In addition to <b>hazardous</b> <b>metals,</b> these <b>wastes</b> are contaminated with low-level fission products. Initially, bench-scale waste forms with simulated and actual waste streams were fabricated by acid-base reactions between mixtures of magnesium oxide powders and an acid phosphate solution, and the wastes. Size reduction of Pb-lined plastic glove waste was accomplished by cryofractionation. The Ceramicrete{trademark} process produces dense, hard ceramic waste forms. Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) results showed excellent stabilization of both Hg and Pb in the waste forms. The principal advantage of this technology is that immobilization of contaminants is the result of both chemical stabilization and subsequent microencapsulation of the reaction products. Based on bench-scale studies, Ceramicrete{trademark} technology has been implemented in the fabrication of 5 -gal waste forms at ANL-West. Approximately 35 kg of real waste has been treated. The TCLP is being conducted on the samples from the 5 -gal waste forms.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the potential environmental risk of tailings resulted after precious and base metal ores processing, stored in seven impoundments located in the Aries river basin, Romania. The tailings were characterized by mineralogical and elemental composition, contamination indices, acid rock drainage generation potential and water leachability of hazardous/priority <b>hazardous</b> <b>metals</b> and ions. Multivariate statistical methods were used for data interpretation. Results Tailings were found to be highly contaminated with several hazardous/priority <b>hazardous</b> <b>metals</b> (As, Cu, Cd, Pb), and pose potential contamination risk for soil, sediments, surface and groundwater. Two out of the seven studied impoundments does not satisfy the criteria required for inert wastes, shows acid rock drainage potential and thus can contaminate the surface and groundwater. Three impoundments were found to be highly contaminated with As, Pb and Cd, two with As and other two with Cu. The tailings impoundments were grouped based on the enrichment factor, geoaccumulation index, contamination factor and contamination degree of 7 hazardous/priority <b>hazardous</b> <b>metals</b> (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn) considered typical for the studied tailings. Principal component analysis showed that 47 % of the elemental variability was attributable to alkaline silicate rocks, 31 % to acidic S-containing minerals, 12 % to carbonate minerals and 5 % to biogenic elements. Leachability of metals and ions was ascribed in proportion of 61 % to silicates, 11 % to acidic minerals and 6 % to the organic matter. A variability of 18 % was attributed to leachability of biogenic elements (Na, K, Cl -, NO 3 -) with no potential environmental risk. Pattern recognition by agglomerative hierarchical clustering emphasized the grouping of impoundments in agreement with their contamination degree and acid rock drainage generation potential. Conclusions Tailings stored in the studied impoundments were found to be contaminated with some hazardous/ priority <b>hazardous</b> <b>metals,</b> fluoride and sulphate and thus presents different contamination risk for the environment. A long term monitoring program of these tailings impoundments and the expansion of the ecologization measures in the area is required. </p...|$|R

Through their ability to change the oxidation state of the metal ions the microorganisms can affect the fate and transport of the metals in aqueous habitats such as streams and groundwater.|$|R
40|$|This project {{addresses}} {{fundamental issues}} and requirements in developing <b>hazardous</b> <b>metal</b> ion separation technologies {{needed in the}} treatment and disposal of radioactive and chemical toxic waste. It encompasses the synthesis of new agents, followed by their characterization and evaluation, with the aim to optimize their metal ion sequestering properties for use in applied technologies. This research {{is focused on the}} following key areas: (1) basic design and synthesis of new metal ion specific sequestering ligands; (2) structural and thermodynamic investigations of these ligands and their complexes formed with the targeted metal ions; and (3) development of sequestering agents and their incorporation into systems designed to be prototypes of inexpensive and highly effective materials for <b>hazardous</b> <b>metal</b> ion decontamination. Basic studies of the sequestration of relevant toxic metals are required in order to develop processes that will treat effluents sufficiently well to allow direct release into the environment and minimize the production of secondary wastes. ...|$|R
