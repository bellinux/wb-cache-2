40|$|Training and {{communication}} are essential {{elements in the}} implementation of environmental management systems (EMS). This study is based on two main questions: (i) What methods for training {{and communication}} will support the implementation of EMS at a university? and, (ii) How did faculty and staff perceive the training and communication activities? The study includes a literature review, a case study of methods for training and communication, and results of a semi quantitative survey of the perception of training and communication. All activities took place at the University of Gavle (Sweden). The University of Gavle was certified according to ISO 14001 in 2004. Practical experiences from the implementation of EMS in industry were used as reference. The literature review indicates that training is a key factor during implementation of EMS, and that training may change attitude and behaviour among managers and employees. Similar conclusions can be drawn from this study. The case study, and practical experiences from industry, indicate that similar methods of EMS training and communication can be shared by industry and universities. However, "academic freedom" and "critical thinking" may result in the need for more interactive training methods at a university than in industry. The results of the survey indicate that the training and communication have increased awareness of environmental issues. A deeper understanding of the personal role in the EMS was also observed. It can be concluded that the EMS training and communication team has a demanding task to introduce the concept of <b>indirect</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> at a university. Lecturers and researchers should be convinced that the greening of a college involves more than, for example, reducing the consumption of paper. The main role of EMS at a university should be to focus on <b>indirect</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects,</b> for example, to introduce environmental and sustainability issues in courses and research.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the case}} of ISO 14001 certification in the City of Marrakech (Morocco). The case study defines the methods and approaches used {{in the implementation of}} the Environmental Management System (EMS), highlighting what were the main differences and the rationale and expected benefits of the certification process for the city. The paper aims to compare this experience with similar experiences of Western local authorities described in the literature by analysing drivers, motivations, benefits and barriers in EMS adoption. To achieve this goal, the paper reports, among other results, the outcome of a survey of the environmental perception of the City population carried out in the ISO 14001 implementation in order to identify how and if the attainment of ISO 14001 certification could be valorised by the City of Marrakech with regard to the citizens' perception. From this enquiry it emerges that a relevant sensibility of the population related to numerous environmental issues can be stimulated by ISO 14001 certification. The case study shows that an approach foreseeing a strong involvement of the stakeholders can be particularly effective as it responds to the specificities of non-EU contexts.

40|$|The study {{investigates the}} extent to which the {{perceived}} physical environmental quality of housing facilities for people with severe mental illness accounts for perceived social environmental quality. Twenty facilities were assessed by people with psychiatric disabilities (residents), staff, and experts with regard to the physical <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> of visual pleasantness, <b>indirect</b> <b>environmental</b> effects, overall physical quality, and the social environmental indicator of social relationship. The results suggest that residents' and staff's physical environmental quality perception accounts for social relationship quality perception, whereas experts' environmental assessment does not.

40|$|Supported housing {{facilities}} (SHF) {{are among}} the most common housing solutions for people with severe mental illness (SMI). A poor level of physical-environment qualities and the re-creation of institutional atmospheres in these settings have been found in recent studies. The research focus in the psychiatric field has, however, largely neglected these topics and the available knowledge does not provide sufficient evidence to draw any conclusions in terms of which physical <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> support the well-being of people with SMI. The aim of this thesis is thus to reduce this knowledge gap and identify physical-environment affordances for psychosocially supportive housing facilities. The HEI model and a salutogenic approach are the thesis’ theoretical backgrounds that have led to the identification of physical-environment affordances, which have proven to be crucial for people’s well-being. Such affordances are operationalized in terms of visual pleasantness, homelikeness and <b>indirect</b> <b>environmental</b> effects. SHF (N = 20) were investigated with a multi-place approach by experts (N = 5), user-group panel (N = 3), people with SMI (N = 72) and staff (N = 117) (social actors). Four papers contribute to test the influence of the selected affordances on people with SMI: comparison of the views of different social actors (Paper I), evaluation of their impact on social climate (Paper II), observed behaviors (Paper IV) and on place attachment and quality of life (Paper III). Results suggest that SHFs with perceived greater physical affordances (visual pleasantness and <b>indirect</b> <b>environmental</b> effects) were associated with positive social climate perceptions. Moreover, the <b>indirect</b> <b>environmental</b> effects were found to be supportive for observed behaviors of interactions, attachment to place and quality of life responses. Place attachment and social climate mediated the effects of the physical environment. These findings suggest that future planning of SHF should focus on a housing design that sustains possibilities for social interaction, privacy regulation and restoration (<b>indirect</b> <b>environmental</b> effects) in order to support well-being outcomes among people with SMI. Methodological, theoretical and practical design implications are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The problem {{addressed}} in this thesis is how to account for <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> when purchasing freight transports. This problem is addressed from a transport purchasing perspective. The result of the research is a model for how transport purchasers can incorporate <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> when purchasing freight transports. This mode! is built on two tools and a work process. The first too! is a structural approach to enable transport purchasers to assess environmental performance of transport suppliers. The other too! is a method for assessing <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> of a specific transport relation. The second tool furthermore includes a method for how to allocate the <b>environmental</b> <b>aspect</b> of transports to the cargo transported and a method for how to determine <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> of a specific transport relation. The aspects accounted for are the input of energy and the output of emissions of carbon dioxide, sulphur oxides, nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons and particulate. The work process describes how the tools {{can be used in}} order to support continuous improvements. The work process is described according to the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle. The research has been both case study inspired as well as action research oriented. The model was developed in a company where the researcher actively participated in its development. The company in the case study is a major European transport purchaser. The practical implication of the result is a method, which enables transport purchasers to account for <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> in their purchasing work. The theoretical implication of this method can be a step towards developing general theory of accounting for the environment in transport purchasing...|$|R
