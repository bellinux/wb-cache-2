5|$|For the Mexican National Trios Championship challengers Los Boricuas, {{represented}} by Gran Markus Jr, Violencia and Poder Boricua <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>case,</b> <b>was</b> accompanied by Pierroth Jr. and La Nazi. The outside interference helped Los Boricuas win the first fall over Olímpico, Mr. Niebla and Safari. In {{the third and}} final fall, both Mr. Niebla and Safari piled on Gran Markus Jr. to pin him and retain the championship. After the loss Pierroth Jr. berated Gran Markus Jr. over the loss. The fourth match of the night featured brothers Dr. Wagner Jr. and Black Tiger on opposite sides as they each captained a trio. In the third and deciding fall Dr. Wagner Jr. pinned Negro Casas to bring the victory for himself, Universo 2000, Juventud Guerrera and Fuerza Guerrera.|$|E
5|$|In 1831 {{there were}} {{extensive}} riots in the Forest of Dean, led by Warren James. After {{the intervention of}} the military, the rioters were dispersed and order restored, but a range of complaints were levied about the enforcement of the local laws on miners and metal-workers. There had been attacks against St Briavels Castle by discontented locals before during the 1780s, but the degree of violence <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>case</b> <b>was</b> much greater. An act of Parliament followed, establishing a number of commissioners who investigated local practices and recent events at the Castle.|$|E
5|$|In a 5–4 opinion, the Court {{held that}} forced {{extraction}} {{and analysis of}} a blood sample is not compelled testimony; therefore, it does not violate the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. The Court also held that intrusions into the human body ordinarily require a search warrant. However, the Court ruled that the involuntary, warrantless blood sample taken <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>case</b> <b>was</b> justified under the Fourth Amendment's exigent circumstances exception because evidence of blood alcohol would be destroyed by the body's natural metabolic processes if the officers were {{to wait for a}} warrant. In 2013, the Supreme Court clarified in Missouri v. McNeely that the natural metabolism of alcohol in the bloodstream is not a per se exigency that would always justify warrantless blood tests of individuals suspected of driving under the influence of alcohol.|$|E
30|$|There {{are some}} rare reports of extrahepatic HCC without primary hepatic parenchymal lesions [2, 11]; hence, the bile duct tumors <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>case</b> might <b>be</b> new HCC lesions. However, the bile duct tumors <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>case</b> <b>were</b> {{considered}} recurrence {{because of the}} morphological similarities and venous invasion. Furthermore, most cases of primary extrahepatic HCC are continuous and localized masses [12], whereas the tumors <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>case</b> <b>are</b> extensively distinct and scattered.|$|R

5|$|Justice Stevens wrote a brief {{dissenting opinion}} {{arguing that the}} case should have been {{dismissed}} because the Illinois legislature has largely reduced penalties for marijuana possession, which made it ridiculous for the officers to rush to get a warrant. He said {{that even if he}} reached the merits of the question, he would affirm and hold the search unconstitutional because the majority misapplied a balancing of “privacy-related and law enforcement-related concerns". He wanted to give broader protection to the idea of the home as a place for protection, even if the home <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>case</b> <b>was</b> a trailer.|$|E
5|$|Neither treaty {{made any}} {{provision}} {{as to the}} mode or {{manner in which the}} removal of the Indians or surrender of the reservations was to take place. The grantees have assumed that they were authorized to take forcible possession of the two reservations, or of the four, as the case would have been under the first treaty. The plaintiff <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>case</b> <b>was</b> expelled by force; and unless this mode of removal can be sustained, the recovery against the defendants for the trespass was right, and must be affirmed.|$|E
5|$|The {{importance}} of the ruling <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>case</b> <b>was</b> that it tested {{the constitutionality of the}} Act and confirmed Congress' authority over Indian affairs. Plenary power over Indian tribes, supposedly granted to the U.S. Congress by the Commerce Clause of the Constitution, was not deemed necessary to support the Supreme Court in this decision; instead, the Court found the power in the tribes' status as dependent domestic nations. This allowed Congress to pass the Dawes Act the following year. The case has been criticized by legal scholars as drawing on powers that are not granted to Congress by the Constitution. It remains , despite that criticism.|$|E

5|$|Volcanic eruptions eject {{large amounts}} of carbon into the air. The carbon is of {{geological}} origin and has no detectable , so the / ratio {{in the vicinity of}} the volcano is depressed relative to surrounding areas. Dormant volcanoes can also emit aged carbon. Plants that photosynthesize this carbon also have lower / ratios: for example, plants on the Greek island of Santorini, near the volcano, have apparent ages of up to a thousand years. These effects are hard to predict– the town of Akrotiri, on Santorini, was destroyed in a volcanic eruption thousands of years ago, but radiocarbon dates for objects recovered from the ruins of the town show surprisingly close agreement with dates derived from other means. If the dates for Akrotiri are confirmed, it would indicate that the volcanic effect <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>case</b> <b>was</b> minimal.|$|E

25|$|The 1971 TV special Play It Again, Charlie Brown was {{the first}} time that someone other than Peter Robbins voiced Charlie Brown which <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>case</b> <b>was</b> Chris Inglis.

25|$|In 2005, the {{evidence}} {{collected by the}} ICAC through covert surveillance in a case involving a publicly listed company was questioned. While the judge ruled that covert surveillance carried out <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>case</b> <b>was</b> unconstitutional due {{to the absence of}} relevant legal procedures, the judge admitted {{the evidence}} as he found that the ICAC had conducted the operations in good faith. The defendants were convicted.|$|E

25|$|Another early {{case was}} Doyle v. State, which {{occurred}} in Texas in 1954. The bite mark <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>case</b> <b>was</b> {{on a piece}} of cheese found at the crime scene of a burglary. The defendant was later asked to bite another piece of cheese for comparison. A firearms examiner and a dentist evaluated the bite marks independently and both concluded that the marks were made by the same set of teeth. The conviction in this case set the stage for bite marks found on objects and skin to be used as evidence in future cases.|$|E
25|$|Another major figure indicted <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>case</b> <b>was</b> Wang Shen, {{a wealthy}} noble and {{imperial}} in-law, {{who was also}} a painter, poet, and friend of Su Shi. Wang was particularly accused of having caused a collected edition of Su Shi's allegedly subversive poems to be printed and published. Another person involved in the case was Huang Tingjian (Hartman, 20). Huang and his uncle were heavily fined, and Huang was exiled. Another person implicated in the events was Su Shi's brother Su Zhe. There were in total more than 30 indictments in the case.|$|E

25|$|The NAACP {{promised to}} help the defense, and brought in Clarence Darrow as chief counsel. He was {{assisted}} by Arthur Garfield Hays and Walter M. Nelson. Frank Murphy was the presiding judge. The jury consisted of twelve white men. Despite this, Darrow built an impressive case arguing self-defense, and the case ended in a hung jury. The prosecution retried a single defendant, Ossian's brother Henry, but the second trial ended in an acquittal. The verdict <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>case</b> <b>was</b> not guilty, and no further {{effort was made to}} prosecute Ossian Sweet or the other defendants.|$|E
25|$|However, {{forensic}} experts {{state that}} psychiatric testimony on ultimate questions at law is unreliable {{due to the}} inherent limitations of current psychiatric clinical and experimental knowledge and practice. Dr. James P. Grigson, one of the psychiatrists that testified <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>case,</b> <b>was</b> expelled from the American Psychiatric Association and the Texas Association of Psychiatric Physicians (TAPP) for making statements in testimony on defendants he had not examined. The TAPP said his expulsion was due not only to his replies to hypothetical questions but also for predicting dangerousness with 100% certainty.|$|E
25|$|Usually {{the process}} of {{speciation}} is slow, occurring over very long time spans; thus direct observations within human life-spans are rare. However speciation has been observed in present-day organisms, and past speciation events are recorded in fossils. Scientists have documented the formation of five new species of cichlid fishes from a single common ancestor that was isolated fewer than 5,000years ago from the parent stock in Lake Nagubago. The evidence for speciation <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>case</b> <b>was</b> morphology (physical appearance) and lack of natural interbreeding. These fish have complex mating rituals {{and a variety of}} colorations; the slight modifications introduced in the new species have changed the mate selection process and the five forms that arose could not be convinced to interbreed.|$|E
