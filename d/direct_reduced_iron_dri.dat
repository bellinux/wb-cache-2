40|$|Steel is {{fundamental}} material for many industries that could produced by blast furnace (BF) and <b>direct</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>Iron</b> technology (<b>DRI).</b> these two technologies differ {{from each other}} in term of difference of production cost, energy consumption, investment and environment issues.

It provides a comparison between the domestic costs to produce a specific good with its value added at international prices, which was done by Mckay (1999), DHEHIBI (2009), Ruiz (2003) and Bonjec (2002).

This study has developed a more complete understanding of the behavior of phosphorus in DRI during EAF steelmaking, through a thorough investigation of the kinetics and thermodynamics of phosphorus transfer in the EAF based upon laboratory and plant experiments and trials. Laboratory experiments have shown that phosphorus mass transfer between oxide and metallic phases within commercial <b>direct</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>iron</b> pellets occurs rapidly upon melting according to the local equilibrium for these phases. Laboratory kinetic experiments indicate that under certain conditions, phosphorus mass transfer between slag and metal is influenced by dynamic phenomena, which affect the mass transfer coefficient for the reaction and/or the slag metal interfacial area. Plant trials were conducted to directly evaluate the conditions of mass transfer in the electric furnace and {{to determine the effects of}} different scrap substitute materials upon the slag chemistry, the behavior of phosphorus in the steel, and upon furnace yield. The data from these trials were also used to develop empirical models for the slag chemistry and furnace temperature as functions of time during a single heat.

50|$|Modern {{steelmaking}} processes can {{be divided}} into two categories: Primary and Secondary steelmaking. Primary steelmaking involves converting liquid iron from a blast furnace and steel scrap into steel via basic oxygen steelmaking or melting scrap steel and/or <b>direct</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>iron</b> (<b>DRI)</b> in an electric arc furnace. Secondary steelmaking involves refining of the crude steel before casting and the various operations are normally carried out in ladles. In secondary metallurgy, alloying agents are added, dissolved gases in the steel are lowered, and inclusions are removed or altered chemically to ensure that high-quality steel is produced after casting.|$|E
5000|$|A minimill is {{traditionally}} a secondary steel producer; however, Nucor (one of the world's largest steel producers), {{as well as}} one of its competitors, [...] Commercial Metals Company (CMC) use minimills exclusively. Usually it obtains most of its iron from scrap steel, recycled from used automobiles and equipment or byproducts of manufacturing. <b>Direct</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>iron</b> (<b>DRI)</b> is sometimes used with scrap, to help maintain desired chemistry of the steel, though usually DRI is too expensive to use as the primary raw steelmaking material. A typical mini-mill will have an electric arc furnace for scrap melting, a ladle furnace or vacuum furnace for precision control of chemistry, a strip or billet continuous caster for converting molten steel to solid form, a reheat furnace and a rolling mill.|$|E
50|$|Steelmaking {{has existed}} for millennia, {{but it was not}} commercialized on a massive scale until the 19th century. The ancient craft process of {{steelmaking}} was the crucible process. In the 1850s and 1860s, the Bessemer process and the Siemens-Martin process turned steelmaking into a heavy industry. Today there are two major commercial processes for making steel, namely basic oxygen steelmaking, which has liquid pig-iron from the blast furnace and scrap steel as the main feed materials, and electric arc furnace (EAF) steelmaking, which uses scrap steel or <b>direct</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>iron</b> (<b>DRI)</b> as the main feed materials. Oxygen steelmaking is fuelled predominantly by the exothermic nature of the reactions inside the vessel where as in EAF steelmaking, electrical energy is used to melt the solid scrap and/or DRI materials. In recent times, EAF steelmaking technology has evolved closer to oxygen steelmaking as more chemical energy is introduced into the process.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of the carbon concentration of directly <b>reduced</b> <b>iron</b> (<b>DRI)</b> powders on the compressibility and fracture strength of hot briquetted iron (HBI) has been studied. Industrially produced <b>DRI,</b> pure <b>iron</b> powder and Fe–C alloy powders (synthetic DRI) {{were used in the}} study. It was found that the mechanism of compaction could be attributed to pure yielding. The pressure required to attain a given density increased proportionally with the carbon content. The morphology and phases present in DRI powder had a significant influence on the compressibility. The fracture strength of the compacts increased with increasing carbon content of the DRI powder. These observations are discussed with reference to the current understanding of the mechanisms of compaction and fracture of compacted particulate materials...|$|R
50|$|Since the {{invention}} of the Bessemer process, steel mills have replaced ironwork, based on puddling or fining methods. New ways to produce steel appeared later: from scrap melted in an electric arc furnace and, more recently, from <b>direct</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>iron</b> processes.|$|R
5000|$|In the Reduction shaft {{the iron}} ore, along with {{limestone}} and dolomite additives, is added and then reduced by reduction gas into 95% <b>direct</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>iron,</b> <b>DRI.</b> The DRI is then redirected via six discharge screws into the melter-gasifier. The Melter gasifier has three main sections, the gaseous free board zone, the Char bed, and the hearth zone, {{and it has}} an effect on several stages in the process. First it serves to create the reduction gas by gasifying the coal with oxygen and then cooling it. After being reduced, the DRI is redirected to the char bed where the iron and slag are melted and then directed to the hearth zone. [...] The heat inside the metal gasifier keeps the amount of phenols small, keeping them out of the atmosphere. Meanwhile, carbon monoxide and hydrogen gas from the original gasification of the coal exit the gasifier while other byproducts are captured in the metallic slag. The rest of the hot gas is then cooled and sent into the reduction shaft resulting in the Corex export gas which is used to control pressure in the plant. Many of the gases resulting from this process can then be recycled or used to produce electricity. [...] Dust particles also appear in these gases and the Melter gasifier recycles them with four dust burners.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Coke {{constitutes}} the {{major portion of}} ironmaking cost and its production causes the severe environmental concerns.

40|$|Nitrogen is {{difficult}} to remove in electric arc furnace (EAF) steelmaking, requiring the use of more energy in the oxygen steelmaking route to produce low-nitrogen steel. The objective of this work {{was to determine if}} the injection of directly <b>reduced</b> <b>iron</b> (<b>DRI)</b> fines into EAFs could reduce the nitrogen content by creating fine carbon monoxide bubbles that rinse nitrogen from the steel. The proposed work included physical and chemical characterization of DRI fines, pilot-scale injection into steel, and mathematical modeling to aid in scale-up of the process. Unfortunately, the pilot-scale injections were unsuccessful, but some full-scale data was obtained. Therefore, the original objectives were met, and presented in the form of recommendations to EAF steelmakers regarding: (1) The best composition and size of DRI fines to use; (2) The amount of DRI fines required to achieve a specific reduction in nitrogen content in the steel; and (3) The injection conditions.

Self-reducing briquettes containing a mixture of BOF-dust, BOF-sludge and BF-sludge were produced.
