5|$|Atheis was Mihardja's first novel; {{what few}} {{literary}} works {{he had written}} beforehand were mostly short stories and dramas, both those intended for the radio and the stage. He never formally studied writing, instead learning how to write fiction from his experiences reading <b>existing</b> <b>works,</b> including those of André Gide, Leo Tolstoy, Vsevolod Ivanov, and Fyodor Dostoyevsky. His writing style was heavily influenced by that of Gide, particularly as found in The Immoralist (1902). Malay, the language which forms the basis of modern Indonesian, was not Mihardja's native language; his earlier works had all been in Sundanese, and Mihardja had only begun regularly using Indonesian after the Japanese occupation (1942–1945), {{when he became a}} translator.|$|E

5|$|From 1950 onwards David {{was well}} known for her {{magazine}} articles and, in the 1960s and '70s, for her kitchen shop, but her reputation rested and still rests principally on her books. The first five, published between 1950 and 1960, cover the cuisine of continental Europe and beyond. In the 1970s David wrote two books about English cooking. The last of her books published in her lifetime was a collection of previously-printed essays and articles. From the extensive notes and archives left by the author, her literary executor, Jill Norman, edited and completed four more books that David had planned. Six other books published since the author's death in various formats in hardback and paperback have been compilations drawn from her <b>existing</b> <b>works.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lie is {{considered}} influential to the colony's journalism, linguistics, and literature. According to the Malaysian scholar Ahmad Adam, {{he is best}} remembered for his literary works. Several of his writings were printed multiple times, and Sair Tjerita Siti Akbari was adapted for the stage and screen. However, {{as a result of}} the language politics in the Indies and independent Indonesia, his work has become marginalised. When several of his writings were revealed as uncredited adaptations of <b>existing</b> <b>works,</b> Lie was criticised as unoriginal. Other critics, however, have found evidence of innovation in his writing style and handling of plots.|$|E

25|$|Shortly after {{settling}} in Britain Panufnik {{was given an}} exclusive publishing contract with the prestigious firm of Boosey & Hawkes. They could get no answer from the Polish State publishers as to their long-term intentions for Panufnik's <b>existing</b> <b>works,</b> all of which had appeared under their imprint. Panufnik was therefore advised to introduce small revisions into all his <b>existing</b> <b>works</b> {{in order to avoid}} copyright problems when Boosey & Hawkes took these works into their catalogue. Just after he completed this task, he heard that the Polish State Publishers had finally confirmed that they had no further interest in their catalogue of Panufnik's music. Panufnik bemoaned the time wasted, and indeed the surviving original scores (copies of which had already been sent to some libraries in the West, including Harvard University) show that Panufnik's revisions excised some of the more radical passages in these works. Nevertheless, all the music he wrote before 1955 continues to be performed in the revised editions. For two years from 1957 to 1959 Panufnik's financial situation eased slightly when he was appointed Principal Conductor of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra. The orchestra was keen to keep him, but preparing for fifty concerts a year prevented Panufnik from devoting enough time to composing.|$|E

25|$|Despite his {{eminence}} and influence, one criticism {{leveled against}} Yashovijaya {{is that he}} {{is best known for his}} Navya-Nyaya commentaries of earlier <b>existing</b> <b>works</b> rather than his own original works. Furthermore, his works on Yoga, dhyana, grammar and poetry did not gain much fame, as the works of Haribhadra and Hemacandra on these topics were already established and famous by the time Yashovijaya came on the scene. His fame largely rests on his mastery of navyanyaya, for which he had no contemporary rival. This could be because, for almost six centuries between Hemacandra and Yashovijaya, Jainism did not produce any able scholar on philosophy of nyaya.|$|E

25|$|Dadaglobe was {{an ambitious}} {{anthology}} of the Dada movement slated {{for publication in}} 1921, but abandoned for financial and other reasons and never published. At 160 pages with over a hundred reproductions of artworks and over a hundred texts by some fifty artists in ten countries, Dadaglobe was to have documented Dada's apotheosis as an artistic and literary movement of international breadth. Edited by Dada co-founder Tristan Tzara (1896-1963) in Paris, Dadaglobe was not conceived of as {{a summary of the}} movement since its founding in 1916, but rather meant to be a snapshot of its expanded incarnation at war's end. Not merely a vehicle for <b>existing</b> <b>works,</b> the project functioned as one of Dada's most generative catalysts for the production of new works.|$|E
25|$|For The Birth of a Nation, {{composer}} Joseph Carl Breil {{created a}} three-hour-long musical score that combined all {{three types of}} music in use at the time: adaptations of <b>existing</b> <b>works</b> by classical composers, new arrangements of well-known melodies, and original composed music. Though it had been specifically composed for the film, Breil's score was not used for the Los Angeles première of the film at Clune's Auditorium; rather, a score compiled by Carli Elinor was performed in its stead, and this score was used exclusively in West Coast showings. Breil's score was not used until the film debuted in New York at the Liberty Theatre, and was the score utilized in all showings save those on the West Coast.|$|E

500|$|Mozart's texts {{came from}} a variety of sources, and the early operas were often adaptations of <b>existing</b> <b>works.</b> The first {{librettist}} chosen by Mozart himself appears to have been Giambattista Varesco, for Idomeneo in 1781. Five years later, he began his most enduring collaboration, with Lorenzo Da Ponte, his [...] "true phoenix". The once widely held theory that Da Ponte was the librettist for the discarded Lo sposo deluso of 1783 has now been generally rejected. Mozart felt that, as the composer, he should have considerable input into the content of the libretto, so that it would best serve the music. Musicologist Charles Rosen writes, [...] "it is possible that Da Ponte understood the dramatic necessities of Mozart's style without prompting; but before his association with da Ponte, Mozart had already bullied several librettists into giving him the dramatically shaped ensembles he loved." ...|$|E

On the contrary, in all <b>existing</b> <b>work,</b> the channels are assumed to be static and the distribution of the channel matrix is not used in the rank detection designs [14, 17 – 23]. Also, in our model, a general training length and unitary training matrix are considered, while most <b>existing</b> <b>work</b> (e.g., [17 – 23]) apply to identity training matrix only, where the training length equals the number of transmit antennas. Finally, in this work, we use the probability of correct rank detection as the performance measure and optimization objective, while <b>existing</b> <b>work</b> (except [23]) targeted at minimizing the MSE of the MIMO channel estimation [17 – 22].|$|R
