40|$|Abstract Background Incidence of diabetes, {{obesity and}} insulin {{resistance}} {{are associated with}} high glycemic load diets. Identifying food components that decrease post-prandial glycemia may be beneficial for developing low glycemic foods and supplements. This study explores the glycemic impact of adding escalating doses of a glycemic index lowering peptide fraction (GILP) from whey to a glucose drink. Methods Ten healthy subjects (3 M, 7 F, 44. 4 ± 9. 3 years, BMI 33. 6 ± 4. 8 kg/m 2) participated in an acute randomised controlled study. Zero, 5, 10 and 20 g of protein from GILP were added to a 50 g glucose drink. The control (0 g of GILP) meal was repeated 2 times. Capillary blood samples were taken fasting (0 min) and at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 minutes {{after the start of}} the meal and analyzed for blood glucose concentration. Results Increasing doses of GILP decreased the <b>incremental</b> <b>areas</b> under the curve in a dose dependant manner (Pearson's r = 0. 48, p = 0. 002). The <b>incremental</b> <b>areas</b> (iAUC) under the glucose curve for the 0, 5, 10, and 20 g of protein from GILP were 231 ± 23, 212 ± 23, 196 ± 23, and 138 ± 13 mmol. min/L respectively. The iAUC of the 20 g GILP was significantly different from control, 5 g GILP and 10 g GILP (p Conclusion Addition of GILP to a oral glucose bolus reduces blood glucose iAUC in a dose dependent manner and averages 4. 6 ± 1. 4 mmol. min/L per gram of GILP.

40|$|In {{assessing}} {{the relationship between}} insulin levels and blood pressure, we analyzed glucose and insulin data after standard 75 g oral glucose tolerance tests in 16 nonobese male Nigerian subjects with essential hypertension and compared their results with those obtained from 16 age- and sex-matched healthy normotensive subjects. The fasting plasma glucose and insulin as well as 2 -hour postload insulin values were similar in both groups. The hypertensive subjects had significantly greater 2 -hour glucose levels, larger <b>incremental</b> <b>areas</b> under the glucose/time curves, and smaller ratios of incremental insulin to <b>incremental</b> glucose <b>areas</b> (P <. 05). These parameters suggest some impairment of glucose tolerance in the hypertensive subjects related to an inadequate insulin response to the oral glucose load. Model analysis of the glucose and insulin data confirmed these observations in that the estimated rate of glucose uptake into peripheral tissues (M value) was lower in the hypertensive subjects (P =. 02). There was no correlation at any time point between insulin values and blood pressure in either group of subjects. These results suggest that essential hypertension in Nigerian diabetic subjects {{is associated with a}} reduced insulin response to glucose loading, which is at variance with reports in whites, and deserve further investigation...|$|R

They concluded both the IE blend and the partially hydrogenated fat blend increased the fasting ratio of LDL to HDL cholesterol, indicating an adverse effect on CVD risk. Sundram et al. also found that fasting plasma glucose levels were higher after 4 weeks on the interesterified fat than after the other diets. For the postprandial study the glucose <b>incremental</b> <b>area</b> under the curve (IAUC) following the IE meal was 40% greater than after either other meal (p<0.001), and was linked to relatively depressed insulin and C-peptide (p<0.05).

The interesterified fat had 30% more saturated and 57% less monounsaturated fatty acids than the untreated palm olein.

40|$|Background: Bariatric {{operations}} promote {{weight loss}} and improve glucose homeostasis. Glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1) is considered as a possible mediator of the antidiabetic effects of such operations. Methods: The present study aimed to gain information on the time course for changes in glucose tolerance, as well as insulin, glucagon and GLP- 1 secretion, during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), in 31 obese patients examined 1, 3 and 6 months after Larrad's biliopancreatic diversion (BPD) or 6 months after vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG). Results: A time-related progressive decrease in body weight coincided with lowering of plasma triglycerides, decrease of basal plasma glucose and its <b>incremental</b> <b>area</b> during OGTT, and reduction of basal plasma insulin together with an increase of its <b>incremental</b> <b>area.</b> The time-related decrease of plasma glucagon during OGTT was comparable before and after surgery. Both the basal plasma GLP- 1 concentration and its <b>incremental</b> <b>area</b> during the OGTT increased strikingly after surgery, a steady-state situation being reached 3 months after surgery. The most striking differences between the somewhat older and less glucose-tolerant subjects of VBG compared to BPD after surgery, consisted in a decrease in cholesterol and LDL only observed in BPD and a much more pronounced increase in basal and incremental plasma GLP- 1 in BPD. GLP- 1, like glucagon, increased lipolysis, but failed to duplicate the lipogenetic action of insulin in isolated adipocytes obtained {{at the time of}} surgery.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} the interrelationship between carbohydrate and fat metabolism at rest after isoenergetic meals of varying proportions of carbohydrate and fat. Eight physically-active subjects (BMI 18. 1 - 23. 4 kg/m 2) were studied at rest on three occasions after an overnight fast. In a balanced design they were given meals containing carbohydrate, protein and fat in the following amounts respectively (g/ 70 kg body weight) : meal 1 121, 16, 48; meal 2 70, 16, 70; meal 3 50, 14, 80. All meals were isoenergetic, containing 4. 0 MJ/ 70 kg body weight, and were of similar appearance. In addition, on a fourth occasion five of the eight subjects consumed meal 4 (g/ 70 kg body weight) : carbohydrate 0, protein 0, fat 108. Blood samples were taken before eating the meal and at intervals following the meal to determine metabolic and hormonal responses. Energy expenditure and substrate oxidation were measured by indirect calorimetry and balance was calculated over the 5 h postprandial period. The <b>incremental</b> <b>areas</b> under the time curves for fat oxidation were greatest after meals 3 and 4 (P < 0. 05), whereas <b>incremental</b> <b>areas</b> under the carbohydrate oxidation v. time curves were relatively reduced after these two meals (P < 0. 05). This was accompanied by lesser suppression of plasma non-esterified fatty acid concentrations (P < 0. 001) and reduced plasma insulin concentrations (P < 0. 001) following these meals. Energy balance was almost identical after the three isoenergetic meals. In contrast, there was an inverse relationship between carbohydrate and fat balance following these meals, with carbohydrate balance decreasing as carbohydrate intake decreased and fat balance increasing as fat intake increased. We conclude that there is a close interrelationship between carbohydrate and fat metabolism following isoenergetic meals in resting subjects...|$|R

Eight non-obese healthy volunteers with normal glucose tolerance participated randomly in tests with four stages (with an interval {{of at least}} 3 days) : the 300 ml purified water stage (PWS), the 75 g glucose stage (GSS), the 30 g arginine stage (ARS) and the 75 g glucose with 30 g arginine stage (GAS). Venous blood samples were collected to detect the concentrations of glucose and insulin at baseline (0) and at 15, 30, 45, 60 and 120 min after drug administration. The glucose and insulin levels were steady in the PWS. The remaining three stages had similarly shaped insulin concen-tration-time curves, which differed {{from that of the}} PWS.

40|$|The {{major goal}} in the {{treatment}} of diabetes mellitus is to achieve near-normal glycemic control. To optimize both fasting blood glucose and postprandial glucose levels is important in keeping blood glucose levels as close to normal as possible. α-Glucosidase is the enzyme that digests dietary carbohydrate, and inhibition of this enzyme could suppress postprandial hyperglycemia. The {{purpose of this study was}} to test the inhibitory activity of methanol extract of Euonymus alatus on α-glucosidase in vitro and in vivo to evaluate its possible use as an anti-diabetic agent. Yeast α-glucosidase inhibitory activities of methanol extract of E. alatus were measured at concentrations of 0. 50, 0. 25, 0. 10, and 0. 05 mg/ml. The ability of E. alatus to lower postprandial glucose was studied in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. A starch solution (1 g/kg) with and without E. alatus extract (500 mg/kg) was administered to diabetic rats by gastric intubation after an overnight fast.

Interestingly, in stepwise multiple linear regression analysis with the AUC of triglycerides as the dependent variable, only fasting triglycerides, fasting glucose and waist circumference appeared as significant independent (P< 0. 05) contributors. The multiple lineal regression (R) was 0. 77, and fasting triglycerides showed the greatest effect on AUC of triglycerides with a standardized coefficient of 0. 75. CONCLUSIONS: Fasting triglycerides are the major contributors to the postprandial triglycerides levels. MetS influences the postprandial response of lipids in patients with coronary heart disease, particularly in non-hypertriglyceridemic patients...|$|E
40|$|Objective. High-viscosity {{hydroxypropylmethylcellulose}} (HV-HPMC) is {{a modified}} cellulose fiber that produces a viscous gel in the gastrointestinal tract. Clinical trials demonstrate that consumption of HV-HPMC significantly lowers cholesterol, but limited information has been available {{on the influence of}} HV-HPMC on postprandial insulin and glucose responses. The objective of this investigation was to assess the influence of HV-HPMC on postprandial glucose and insulin responses in overweight and obese men and women. Research Design and Methods. Participants were 31, overweight or obese men and women without diabetes who underwent 3 breakfast meal tests in random order, separated by ≥ 72 hours. Test meals contained 75 g carbohydrate plus 4 g or 8 g HV-HPMC, or control (8 g cellulose), delivered in a double-blind fashion. Results. Peak glucose was significantly lower (p < 0. 001) after both HV-HPMC-containing meals [7. 4 mmol/L (4 g) and 7. 4 mmol/L (8 g) ] compared to the control meal (8. 6 mmol/L). Peak insulin concentrations and the <b>incremental</b> <b>areas</b> for glucose and insulin from 0 - 120 min were also significantly reduced after both HV-HPMC doses vs. control (all p < 0. 01). Conclusions. These findings indicate that HV-HPMC consumption reduces postprandial glucose and insulin excursions, which may favorably alter risks for diabetes and cardiovascular disease...|$|R
40|$|Aims: To compare {{metabolic}} control under lispro and recombinant regular {{human insulin}} (RHI) {{in people with}} diet-unresponsive type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM) and compensated non-alcoholic liver disease (CLD). Methods: 108 people with T 2 DM and CLD were randomly allocated to RHI or lispro according to a 12 + 12 week cross-over protocol. A 1 -week continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) session was performed {{at the end of}} each treatment period followed by a standard meal test with a 12 IU lispro or RHI shot ahead. Results: CGM showed higher glycemic excursions under RHI than under lispro (p < 0. 01) with lower glucose levels in the late post-absorption phase (p < 0. 05) and even more during the night (p < 0. 01). Post-challenge <b>incremental</b> <b>areas</b> under the curve (δAUC) were undistinguishable for insulin but lower for glucose, while insulin peaked higher and earlier and glycemic excursions were lower with lispro than with RHI (0. 05 < p < 0. 001). Conclusions: Lispro granted lower early postprandial glucose levels and late postprandial hypoglycemic rates and therefore might represent the treatment of choice for people with T 2 DM and compensated CLD. This might depend on its faster/shorter-living effects, as well as, on the lower liver glucose output expected from its earlier hepatic distribution...|$|R

40|$|Oral glucose {{tolerance}} test (OGTT) is usually insufficient to accurately predict the risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM), it is therefore necessary to identify an additional biomarker that would most likely improve the accuracy of OGTT. The current OGTT was performed in 53 volunteers after ingestion of 75 g glucose in 250 ml water to each volunteer. Similarly the sphingoid base profile of these volunteers was explored using liquid-chromatography linked with mass spectrometer (LC-MS) and correlated with the different time-points glucose values of OGTT {{as well as with}} total area under the curve (tAUC), <b>incremental</b> <b>area</b> under the curve (iAUC), and positive <b>incremental</b> <b>area</b> under the curve (pAUC). The findings showed that 1 -deoxysphinganine (1 -deoxySA) was significantly posi- tively correlated with the 1 -hour, 2 -hour, and 3 -hour plasma glucose level as well as with total, incremental, and positive incremental AUC while 1 -deoxysphingosine (1 -deoxySO) was correlated only with 1 -hour, 2 -hour glu- cose levels and tAUC of OGTT. The C 18 SAdiene was negatively correlated with all-time points glucose values and AUCs followed by negative correlation of C 18 SO, C 16 SO and C 17 SO with 2 -hour glucose and tAUC of OGTT. The ratios of 1 -deoxySA and 1 -deoxySO with respect to C 18 SAdiene have shown significant correlation with 2 -hour and AUCs. These ratios were higher in subjects with gestational diabetes in comparison with normal subjects. These findings underlined that 1 -deoxysphingolipids (1 -deoxySLs) and their ratios with C 18 SAdiene could be significantly correlated with the glucose load of OGTT and might be used as predictive biomarkers along with OGTT for the risk assessment of diabetes...|$|E
40|$|Epidemiological {{studies suggest}} that a diet high in {{processed}} meat, with a high glycemic index is {{associated with an increased}} risk of type 2 diabetes. It is not clear if this is due to altered insulin sensitivity or an enhanced postprandial glucose. We aimed to compare the acute metabolic response of two different types of meals after ingestion of the matching diet for four weeks. The study was a randomized, crossover acute meal study. Volunteers consumed either a red meat/refined grain meal or a dairy/chicken/nuts/wholegrain meal after four weeks of the matching diet. After a three-week washout period and four weeks of the alternate diet, they consumed the matching meal. The diets differed with respect to both protein and carbohydrate sources. Blood samples were taken for 180 min for the measurement of glucose, insulin, C-peptide and triglyceride. Fifty-one participants (age: 35. 1 ± 15. 6 years; body mass index: 27. 7 ± 6. 9 kg/m 2, 17 with normal and 34 with impaired glucose tolerance) completed two meal tests. The area under the curve (p < 0. 001) and <b>incremental</b> <b>area</b> under the curve (p = 0. 001) for insulin was significantly higher after the red meat/refined grain diet than after the dairy/chicken/nuts/whole grain diet. There was an interaction between meal and glucose tolerance group (p < 0. 05) in the area under the curve (AUC) and the <b>incremental</b> <b>area</b> under the curve (iAUC) of glucose; the red meat/refined grain diet increased glucose relative to the dairy/chicken/nuts/whole grain diet only in the normal group (+ 2. 5 mmol/L/ 3 h). The red meat/refined grain diet increased glucose and insulin responses compared with the dairy/chicken/nuts/whole grain diet. This meal pattern would increase pancreatic stress long term and may account for the increased risk of type 2 diabetes with this diet...|$|E

Volunteers (n = 10) completed completed five interventions designed to determine the glycemic and satiety (fullness) effects of the starches (38 [*]g,) alone and when added on top of available carbohydrate. The dose of the starches provided 30 [*]g of resistant starch per treatment. The treatments were: commercial resistant starch added to water (PF−), noncommercial resistant starch added to water (PR−), dextrose solution (DEX, 50 [*]g), and DEX with PenFibe starch (PF+), and DEX with the non-commercial starch added (PR+). Blood glucose was measured in the fasted state and following the randomly assigned treatments at 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 minutes post-consumption. A visual analog scale was used to determine fullness at each time point. There were no differences in the glucose <b>incremental</b> <b>areas</b> under the curve (iAUC) for PF+ and PR+ compared with DEX.

We examined possible differences in the postprandial TG response to fat tolerance tests (FTTs), in which SFA or unsaturated fatty acids were used. Crossover clinical trials investigating the effects of FTTs containing SFA and unsaturated fats on postprandial triglyceridemia in databases from 1994 until 2016 were searched. Of 356 studies, 338 were excluded and 18 were considered. TG net <b>incremental</b> <b>areas</b> under the curve were calculated using time-points or changes from baseline. Pooled effects of standardized mean differences and I 2 test were used. Results: In 12 studies, responses to SFA versus PUFA meals, and in 16 studies versus MUFA meals were compared. Over 4 hours, no differences between SFA and unsaturated fats were observed. Over 8 hours a lower response to PUFA (SMD − 2. 28; 95 %CI − 4. 16, − 0. 41) and a trend to lower response to MUFA (SMD − 0. 89, 95 %CI − 1. 82, 0. 04) were detected.

40|$|Objective—An {{increased}} hepatic flow of free {{fatty acids}} (FFAs) is associated with impaired peripheral FFA trapping by malfunctioning of the complement component 3 (C 3) /acylation-stimulating protein system and overproduction of VLDL in familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL). Postprandial ketone bodies reflect FFA oxidation in the liver, but the postprandial changes in male and female patients separately have not been determined yet. Gender differences in postprandial ketone bodies and C 3 changes were investigated in normolipidemic patients and patients with untreated FCHL. Methods and Results—Thirty-two normolipidemic patients (16 female and 16 male) and 19 patients with untreated normolipidemia (9 female and 10 male) underwent an oral fat-loading test. Total and <b>incremental</b> <b>areas</b> under the curves (AUC and dAUC, respectively) after the oral fat load were calculated. Triglyceride AUC was similar between genders in each group. Normolipidemic female subjects showed a higher levels of dAUC-hydroxybutyric acid than male subjects (1. 370. 49 and 0. 980. 43 mmol · h/L). In FCHL, a similar trend was observed in female (1. 920. 38) compared with male (1. 550. 87) subjects. In contrast to normolipidemia, FCHL did not show a postprandial increase in C 3, although C 3 was higher in FCHL. Conclusions—Women have higher postprandial ketone bodies than men, probably reflecting enhanced postprandial hepatic FFA oxidation. In FCHL, both genders have higher postprandial ketone bodies and therefore higher hepatic FF...|$|R
