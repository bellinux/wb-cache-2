5|$|Unlike the {{arterial}} ultrasound study, {{when the}} sonographer studies venous insufficiency, the vein wall itself has no relevance and attention will {{be focused on}} the direction of blood flow. The objective of the examination is to see how the veins drain. In this way, venous ultrasonography has at times become a hemodynamic examination which is reserved for experienced sonographers who have completed hemodynamic studies and training and have acquired a deep <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> subject.|$|E

25|$|Turid Birkeland and Øystein Mæland, both AUF {{board members}} during Jens Stoltenberg's time as AUF leader, {{admitted}} {{that there had}} been a culture of inflating membership numbers in the organisation at the time. Stoltenberg denied any <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>this.</b> Erik Solheim, former leader of Socialist Youth, admitted that also other youth parties had inflated membership numbers.|$|E
25|$|He {{wanted to}} re-publish the huge 300-year-old chronicle of Denmark, Gesta Danorum, written by Saxo Grammaticus, {{but he did}} not know the {{location}} of the original manuscript. At that time the most <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> work came from a summary called Compendium Saxonis located in Chronica Jutensis, dated about 1342. Undoubtedly this is also how Pedersen knew of it.|$|E
25|$|The <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> {{technology}} was lost {{at some point}} in antiquity, and technological works approaching its complexity and workmanship did not appear again until the development of mechanical astronomical clocks in Europe in the fourteenth century. All known fragments of the Antikythera mechanism are kept at the National Archaeological Museum in Athens, along with a number of artistic reconstructions of how the mechanism may have looked.|$|E

25|$|Astronomy: Astronomical {{observations}} from China constitute the longest continuous sequence from any civilisation and include records of sunspots (112 records from 364 BC), supernovas (1054), lunar and solar eclipses. By the 12th century, they could reasonably accurately make predictions of eclipses, but the <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> was lost during the Ming dynasty, {{so that the}} Jesuit Matteo Ricci gained much favour in 1601 by his predictions.|$|E

25|$|Even {{in modern}} Turkey, however, Ottoman Divan poetry {{is a highly}} {{specialist}} subject. Much of {{this has to do}} with the fact that Divan poetry is written in Ottoman Turkish, which was written using a variant of the Arabic script and made extensive use of Arabic and Persian words, making the language vastly different from modern Turkish. In its own time, <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> form of literary Turkish was largely limited to the educated classes.|$|E
50|$|One {{strategy}} of community-based conservation is co-management or joint management of a protected area. Co-management combines local peoples’ traditional <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> the environment with modern scientific <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> scientists. <b>This</b> combination <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> {{can lead to}} increased biodiversity and better management of the protected area.|$|R

25|$|Due to the {{scarcity}} of written sources, <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> period depends {{to a large degree}} on the interpretation of archaeological data. The traditional view of a clear-cut division between Frisians in the north and coast, Franks in the south and Saxons in the east has proven historically problematic. Archeological evidence suggests dramatically different models for different regions, with demographic continuity for {{some parts of the country}} and depopulation and possible replacement in other parts, notably the coastal areas of Frisia and Holland.|$|E
25|$|A local {{historian}} {{explains that}} Carlotta Valdes tragically committed suicide: {{she had been}} the mistress of a wealthy married man and bore his child; the otherwise childless man kept the child and cast Carlotta aside. Gavin reveals that Carlotta (who he fears is possessing Madeleine) is Madeleine's great-grandmother, although Madeleine has no <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> and does not remember the places she has visited. Scottie tails Madeleine to Fort Point and, when she leaps into the bay, he rescues her.|$|E
25|$|At Padua, Luzzatto had a {{much larger}} scope for his {{literary}} activity, as {{he was able to}} devote all his time to literary work. Besides, while explaining certain parts of the Bible to his pupils he wrote down all his observations. Luzzatto was the first Jewish scholar to turn his attention to Syriac , considering a <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> language of significant importance for the understanding of the Targum. His letter published in Kirchheim's Karme Shomeron shows his thorough acquaintance with Samaritan.|$|E

Milloy {{published}} evidence {{indicating that}} colonialists had intentionally concealed {{information on the}} spread of disease in his book A National Crime: The Canadian Government and the Residential School System, 1879 to 1986 (1999). According to Milloy, the Government of Canada {{was aware of the}} origins of many diseases but maintained a secretive policy. Medical professionals had <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> policy, and further, knew it was causing a higher death rate among indigenous people, yet the policy continued.|$|E
25|$|The Yogaratnamālā, {{arguably the}} most {{important}} of the commentaries on the Hevajratantra, was written by one Kṛṣṇa or Kāṇha, who taught Bhadrapada, another commentator, who in turn taught Tilopa, the teacher of Nāropa, who himself wrote a commentary. He, in turn, passed on his <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> tantra to Marpa (1012-1097 AD), who also taught in Tibet. Marpa also received instruction in the Hevajratantra from Maitrīpa, alias Advayavajra, who was banished from Vikramashila for practicing with a yoginī during the time of Atīśa's abbothood.|$|E
25|$|In 1989, George P. Lee, a Navajo {{member of}} the First Quorum of the Seventy {{who had participated in}} the Indian Placement Program in his youth, was excommunicated. The church action {{occurred}} not long after he had submitted to the Church a 23-page letter critical of the program and the effect it had on Native American culture. In October 1994, Lee confessed to, and was convicted of, sexually molesting a 13-year-old girl in 1989. It is not known if church leaders had <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> crime during the excommunication process.|$|E

25|$|For example, {{consider}} a street where the odd-numbered houses {{are all on}} the north (expensive) side of the road, and the even-numbered houses are all on the south (cheap) side. Under the sampling scheme given above, {{it is impossible to}} get a representative sample; either the houses sampled will all be from the odd-numbered, expensive side, or they will all be from the even-numbered, cheap side, unless the researcher has previous <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> bias and avoids it by a using a skip which ensures jumping between the two sides (any odd-numbered skip).|$|E
25|$|Historic {{events in}} Oaxaca {{as far back}} as the 12th century are {{described}} in pictographic codices painted by Zapotecs and Mixtecs in the beginning of the colonial period, but outside of the information that can be obtained through their study, little historical information from pre-colonial Oaxaca exist, and our <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> period relies largely on archaeological remains. By 500 BC, the central valleys of Oaxaca were mostly inhabited by the Zapotecs, with the Mixtecs on the western side. These two groups were often in conflict throughout the pre-Hispanic period. Archeological evidence indicates that between 750 and 1521, there may have been population peaks of as high as 2.5million.|$|E
