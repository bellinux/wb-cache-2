40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{literature}} survey of some relevant issues arising from <b>environmental</b> quality <b>provision</b> and eco-labelling schemes. First of {{all it is}} shown how the two topics are strictly related. Firms adopting a production process (or producing a good) more environmentally friendly than others (<b>environmental</b> quality <b>provision</b> aspect) may {{want to make it}} public (eco-labelling aspect). The survey addresses the question of optimal <b>environmental</b> quality <b>provision</b> (also as a policy tool) and firms compliance. With regard to eco-labelling, its impacts on market structure are analysed. From the empirical evidence it can be concluded that information plays a crucial role both for consumers’ and producers’ decisions. Consumers are willing to pay a higher price to be informed about the greenness of a good, and a label can really be a determinant in their choice of which brand to purchase. On the supply side, disclosing information about the environmental performance of a firm can affect investment decisions and its stock value. environmental quality, eco-labellng, consumer, producers, International Economic Relations, Economics, Environment...|$|R

His wide-ranging compilation and analysis of <b>environmental</b> rights <b>provisions</b> in numerous countries is an important contribution to international human rights literature. Although Boyd explains that treating the right to a healthy environment as a fundamental human right is not a new idea, his broad research demonstrates that many national constitutions have, in fact, adopted enforceable <b>environmental</b> protection <b>provisions,</b> particularly the right to a healthy environment. Boyd’s research provides concrete examples of how the constitutional right to a healthy environment, and national legislation guaranteeing that right, have had positive environmental consequences.

It considers research illustrating the nature of the relation between maternal care and development. To establish the significance of the <b>environmental</b> <b>provision</b> afforded by maternal care, it is necessary to make such empirical connections between mother-infant interactions and child outcomes. To some extent, the importance of maternal care can be observed within short time frames. This is most clearly demonstrated in the perturbation studies...|$|R

Indeed, in doing so, the TPP became much more detailed and specific than regular US agreements while being legally more enforceable than European agreements.|$|E

Most laborers are not Jordanians; they are contracted guest workers from countries such as Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and China who pay a lump sum of about $2,000 to $3,000 to get hired by a garment factory. However, some factories then confiscate their passports, subjecting them to de facto involuntary servitude bordering on human trafficking.

40|$|Many {{microbial}} species form multicellular structures comprising elaborate {{wrinkles and}} concentric rings, yet {{the rules governing}} their architecture are poorly understood. The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces phenazines, small molecules that act as alternate electron acceptors to oxygen and nitrate to oxidize the intracellular redox state and that influence biofilm morphogenesis. Here, we show that the depth occupied by cells within colony biofilms correlates well with electron acceptor availability. Perturbations in the <b>environmental</b> <b>provision,</b> endogenous production, and utilization of electron acceptors affect colony development {{in a manner consistent}} with redox control. Intracellular NADH levels peak before the induction of colony wrinkling. These results suggest that redox imbalance is a major factor driving the morphogenesis of P. aeruginosa biofilms and that wrinkling itself is an adaptation that maximizes oxygen accessibility and thereby supports metabolic homeostasis. This type of redox-driven morphological change is reminiscent of developmental processes that occur in metazoans...|$|R

It explores the impacts of a 'territorial injustice' of service provision for poor neighbourhoods, arguing that insufficient service provision operates as a 'neighbourhood effect' compounding the problems of being poor and living in a poor area. The paper shows how high levels of social need and a failure within <b>environmental</b> service <b>provision</b> to compensate for these levels of need combine and interact to deepen the environmental problems encountered in many deprived neighbourhoods. In particular, the paper shows how these interactions reduce the capacity of both front line service providers and neighbourhood residents to cope with environmental challenges and thus reveals processes which entrench neighbourhood disadvantage. In so doing, the paper contributes to debates about how so-called 'neighbourhood effects' occur...|$|R

In 1982, The U.S. Department of the Interior created the Minerals Management Service (MMS) to monitor development on the Outer Continental Shelf. The MMS leases submerged federal lands and assesses the environmental effects of exploration and drilling (by issuing an EIS).

Although the first recorded MEA occurred in 1857, the majority of MEAs have been implemented since 1972 at the United Nations conference on the human environment (UNCHE) which is also known as the Stockholm conference.

40|$|Cultural {{geography}} {{draws attention}} to the diverse meanings and values of groups in society, however, despite a growing interest in the geographies of children and youth, there have been few recent empirical studies investigating young people’s experience of place. In particular, comparatively {{little is known about the}} multiple realities of young people living in contrasting social and environmental contexts. This study investigates the multiple geographies of young people growing up in inner and outer urban areas of an English Midlands town in the late 1990 s. An investigation of this kind is especially apposite in that it provides geographical perspectives on the widening, and increasingly more complex, discourses surrounding young people, space and society. This thesis uses participatory and ethnographic methods to engage young people in evaluating their local environments and to explore in detail the meanings, values and experiences young people associate with different places and place uses. The theoretical framework for this study is based on an extensive cross-disciplinary review of literature and informed by recent theories of childhood and youth, social change, social action, children’s rights, participation and citizenship and contemporary cultural geography. It adopts an holistic approach to understanding the complex and multifaceted world of young people as a product of their reflexive relations with their social and environmental contexts. The study recognises the multiple realities that exist within and between different groups of young people and the variable factors which influence young people’s geographies. It utilises conventional social variables such as gender and age to differentiate between ‘cultures of childhood’, together with contingency factors concerning location and parental influence. The study reveals both commonalities and differences in young people’s experience of place, which cut across social and spatial divides to give rise to a heterogeneity of childhood experiences. A major conclusion is that ‘lifestyle’ or ‘microcultures’ offer a more suitable way forward for future children and youth research. The thesis contributes to discourses of childhood and youth by investigating how childhood is constructed, contested and reproduced in neighbourhood space. The marginal status of young people in urban neighbourhood space is exposed in terms of the neglected spaces of young people, marked by a dearth of appropriate <b>environmental</b> <b>provision,</b> <b>environmental</b> hazards and conflict with adult place users. However, the thesis also reveals young people’s keenness to be more involved in improving their communities, together with a range of different ‘modes’ of participation in local decision making and community development processes. The thesis concludes by highlighting key implications for policy and planning with and for young people with respect to social and <b>environmental</b> <b>provision</b> for young people, environmental quality, and the social integration of young people in everyday community life, local decision making and environmental plannin...|$|R

What it does have is a fundamental right enshrined under Article 5 (1) of the Federal Constitution which provides for the Right to Life.
