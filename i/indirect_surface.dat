The {{aim of this}} work was {{the improvement of the}} polymer surface polarity in order to replace the use of adhesive layers before application of lacquering. Two different concepts of dielectric barrier discharge, direct and indirect plasma treatment, were applied. The efficiency of such plasma treatment was determined by adhesive pull strength tests and surface energy calculations. It was shown that both plasma treatment methods allow a significant increase in surface polarity up to a factor of 20 and adhesive pull strength of lacquers up to a factor of 29 respectively. In comparison to <b>indirect</b> <b>surface</b> treatment, the direct treatment features a higher efficiency in terms of increasing both, polarity and adhesive pull strength...|$|E

To enable rapid and low-cost investigation of material pairs that may be used to form such bimaterial surfaces, a specimen and test procedure have been developed and are described in this paper. The specimen allows the extremes of behavior that can be experienced during use of an indirectly textured surface to be assessed.

We present a novel gradient formulation that correctly captures the influence of participating media. Our formulation accurately accounts for changes of occlusion, including the effect of surfaces occluding scattering media. We show how the proposed gradients can be used within an irradiance caching framework to more accurately handle scenes with participating media, providing significant improvements in interpolation quality.

30|$|High ZT {{values of}} Bi 2 Te 3 thin films depend crucially {{on the opening}} of a subgap at the surface, which disappears quickly with the {{increasing}} of the film thickness, as suggested both theoretically [12 – 14] and experimentally [15, 16]. Relatively accurate density functional theory calculations [16, 17] show that the (<b>indirect)</b> <b>surface</b> gap of Bi 2 Te 3 vanishes as soon as the thickness of the thin film increases to 3 QL. Despite the high mobility [18] of the surface electrons, the gapless surface states would lead to poor thermoelectric performance due to low Seebeck coefficient and high electron thermal conductivity. However, by creating suitable nanostructures, extra energy-dependent electron scattering mechanisms can be introduced, which could increase the Seebeck coefficient [19, 20] and reduce the electron thermal conductivity. The consideration of nanostructures of thin films is also motivated by the fact that a single layer of thin film is not of much practical use for thermoelectric applications, and stacks of thin films have much lower lattice thermal conductivity compared with the bulk [21].|$|E

Studies of the transcription of the σA-dependent stress gene clpE under σB-inducing conditions showed that expression was higher in a sigB mutant background than in the wild type. The relative affinities of σA and σB for binding to the core RNA polymerase (E) were determined by means of <b>indirect</b> <b>surface</b> plasmon resonance. The results showed that the affinity of σB for E was 60 -fold lower than that of σA. Western blot analyses with antibodies against σA, σB, and E showed that, after exposure to ethanol stress, the concentration of σB was only twofold higher than those of σA and E. Thus, the concentration of σB after stress is not high enough to compensate for its relatively low affinity for E, and it seems that additional mechanisms must be invoked to account for the binding of σB to E after stress...|$|E
40|$|The multiplexed, {{high-throughput}} {{fabrication of}} microarrays is of vital importance for many applications in life sciences, including drug screening, medical diagnostics and cell biology. In single cell investigations, features smaller than 10 μm {{are needed for}} functional manipulation of sub-cellular structures. Several top-down methodologies like electron beam lithography and microcontact printing can be employed for <b>indirect</b> <b>surface</b> patterning at this scale, however those approaches often require clean rooms and multiplexing of several different biomolecules on the same surface is limited [1]. To overcome these obstacles, we combined Dip-pen nanolithography (DPN) and DNA-directed immobilization (DDI) of proteins to fabricate cell-compatible functionalized glass surfaces [2]. We optimized ink formulation for ssDNA printing and the produced arrays were then functionalized with epidermal growth factor (EGF) taking advantage of covalent ssDNA-streptavidin conjugates as adaptor molecules. The surface-immobilized EGF was used for recruiting EGFR in the plasma membrane of MCF 7 cells. Via this bottom-up structuring approach, {{we were able to}} analyse multiple protein-protein interactions simultaneously in individual living cells [3]. To improve the efficiency of multiplexed surface patterning, we developed a prototype of a robust custom plotter based on 2 D polymer-pen lithography (2 D-PPL) [4]. This device enables rapid fabrication of microarrays at ambient conditions in a multiplexed direct-writing mode. The printing process was carried out by polymeric pyramidal pens onto which multiple (up to 36) ssDNA solutions can be loaded through a microfluidic inkwell device. Subsequent to optimization of ink viscosity and surface tension by glycerol and tween- 20, DNA arrays were plotted and used for DDI of EGF-bearing ssDNA-streptavidin conjugates. The resulting microarrays covered areas of about 0. 5 cm 2, and were capable of recruiting and activating EGF receptors in sub-cellular regions within human MCF 7 cells [4]. References [1] G.

For an assumed input topography and grid of surface elements, the model computes for each element the irradiation from direct insolation and reflected and emitted radiation from other elements, taking into account shadowing by walls of the crater, partial obscuration of the solar disk near the poles and the diurnal, orbital, and seasonal cycles. Temperatures are computed over the surface grid as functions of depth and time from the surface to a specified depth and over the pertinent astronomical cycles, including the effects of direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>surface</b> irradiation, infrared radiation, heat conduction, and interior heating. Vapor fluxes and ice recession times are computed as functions of ice depth over the surface grid. Temperatures profiles, vapor fluxes, and ice recession times were computed for flat surfaces not associated with craters near the poles of Mercury and the Moon. It was found that water ice could have existed throughout geologic time within the maximum radar detection depth of recent observation of Mercury (J. K. Harmon and M. A. Slade, 1992, Science 258, 640 - 643) poleward of approximately 87 - 88 deg L on Mercury and poleward of approximately 73 deg L on the Moon. For Chao Meng Fu crater it was found that approximately 40 % of the crater floor is permanently shadowed from direct solar insolation, while the remainder of the crater floor is periodically illuminated by a partially obscured Sun. Temperatures at the upper levels of the south wall can slightly exceed 550 K. Surface temperatures in the permanently shadowed region of the crater floor are under approximately 130 K, which could have allowed water ice to exist throughout geologic time within the radar detection depth of recent observation of Mercury. For small bowl-shaped crater on Mercury, it was found that most of the crater is permanently shadowed from direct solar radiation, except for a narrow semicircular band bordering the north rim. However, temperatures in the permanently shadowed region periodically reach a maximum near approximately 315 K due to efficient heating of the small crater by thermal emission and reflection from the small sunlit region, which periodically reaches temperatures exceeding 630 K. Water ice could not have existed throughout geologic time anywhere in this crater within the radar detection depth. For Peary crater on the Moon, the entire crater floor is permanently shadowed from direct solar insolation with maximum temperature under 120 K. The upper level of the north wall periodically reaches a maximum temperature near 310 K. The low temperatures on the crater floor would have allowed water ice to exist near the surface throughout geologic time, provided that the Moon's obliquity was always as low as it is at present...|$|E

Analysis of glycopeptides generated by pronase digestion of surface glycoproteins labeled by the neuraminidase/galactose oxidase/NaB 3 H 4 method indicates that the macrophage surface contains a class of high m. w. carbohydrates susceptible to degradation by endo-beta-galactosidase, lactosaminoglycans. These lactosaminoglycans are sialylated type 2 carbohydrates containing the repeating lactosamine disaccharide Gal beta 1 - 4 GlcNAc as well as fucose residues.

40|$|Abstract Background Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a {{major cause}} of healthcare-associated infections. An {{important}} control strategy is hand hygiene; however, non-compliance has been a major problem in healthcare settings. Furthermore, modeling studies have suggested that the law of diminishing return applies to hand hygiene. Other additional control strategies such as environmental cleaning may be warranted, given that MRSA-positive individuals constantly shed contaminated desquamated skin particles to the environment. Methods We constructed and analyzed a deterministic environmental compartmental model of MRSA fate, transport, and exposure between two hypothetical hospital rooms: one with a colonized patient, shedding MRSA; another with an uncolonized patient, susceptible to exposure. Healthcare workers (HCWs), acting solely as vectors, spread MRSA from one patient room to the other. Results Although porous surfaces became highly contaminated, their low transfer efficiency limited the exposure dose to HCWs and the uncolonized patient. Conversely, the high transfer efficiency of nonporous surfaces allows greater MRSA transfer when touched. In the colonized patient’s room, HCW exposure occurred more predominantly through the <b>indirect</b> (patient to <b>surfaces</b> to HCW) mode compared to the direct (patient to HCW) mode. In contrast, in the uncolonized patient’s room, patient exposure was more predominant in the direct (HCW to patient) mode compared to the <b>indirect</b> (HCW to <b>surfaces</b> to patient) mode. Surface wiping decreased MRSA exposure to the uncolonized patient more than daily surface decontamination. This was because wiping allowed higher cleaning frequency and cleaned more total surface area per day. Conclusions Environmental cleaning should be considered as an integral component of MRSA infection control in hospitals. Given the previously under-appreciated role of surface contamination in MRSA transmission, this intervention mode can contribute to an effective multiple barrier approach in concert with hand hygiene...|$|R
