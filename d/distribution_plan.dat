After a demonstration of Sony's <b>distribution</b> <b>plan</b> as well as tech demos of its new console to game publishers and developers in a hotel in Tokyo in 1994, numerous developers began to approach PlayStation. Two of whom later became major partners were Electronic Arts in the West and Namco in Japan. One of the factors which attracted developers to the platform was the use of a 3D-capable, CD-ROM-based console which was much cheaper and easier to manufacture for in comparison to Nintendo's rival console, which used cartridge systems. The project eventually hit Japanese stores in December 1994 and gained massive sales due to its lower price point than its competitor, the Sega Saturn. Popularity of the console spread after its release worldwide in North America and Europe.|$|E

According to a 2008 study by the University of Michigan, water is delivered once a week in big cities like Amman and once every twelve days in some rural areas. According to a 2007 survey the mean rate of supply per week was 1.5 days in Madaba governorate, 2.9 days in Balqa governorate and 3.2 days in Zarqa governorate. In Amman, [...] according to the water <b>distribution</b> <b>plan</b> of Miyahuna, 8 out of 44 main distribution zones received continuous water supply [...] "except in emergency cases" [...] in 2012.

40|$|Distributed memory {{architectures}} such as Linux clusters {{have become}} increasingly common butremain difficult to program. We target this problem and present a noveltechnique to automatically generate data <b>distribution</b> <b>plans,</b> and subsequently MPI implementations in C++,from programs written in a functional core language. This framework encodes distributed data layouts as types, which are then used both to search (via type inference) for optimal data <b>distribution</b> <b>plans</b> and to generate the MPI implementations. The main novelty of our approach is that it supports multiple collections, distributed arrays, maps, and lists, rather than just arrays. We introduce the core language and explain our formalization of distributed data layouts. We describe how to search for data <b>distribution</b> <b>plans</b> using a type inference algorithm, and how we generate MPI implementations in C++ from such plans. We then show how our types can be extended to support local data layouts and improved array distributions. We also show how a theorem prover and suitable equational theories {{can be used to}} yield a better (i. e., more complete) type inference algorithm. We then describe the design of our implementation, and explain how we use a runtime performance-feedback directed search algorithm to find the best data <b>distribution</b> <b>plans</b> for different input programs. Finally, we present some conceptual and experimental evaluation which analyses the capabilities of our approach, and shows that our implementation can find distributed memory implementations of several example programs, and that the performance of generated programs {{is similar to that of}} hand-coded versions. <br/...|$|R

40|$|The Network Planners face {{significant}} {{challenges in}} planning and development of electricity networks. These challenges are driven by different factors. The most influential factors are change of economic environment and regulation models, climate and weather patterns, implementation of new technologies, multiple customer choice and transition of distribution networks from passive to active and more sustainable models. In {{the last few years}} we have seen dramatic changes in the network nature, its topology and load management options. Parallel with intensive load growth, different energy supply models are evolving forcing distribution planners to accommodate new techniques and planning methodologies to simulate and efficiently plan future networks. The modern <b>Distribution</b> Network <b>Planning</b> implements combination of traditional network planning options and so called non-network solutions. Advance load forecasting techniques and simulation of network dynamics based on different topologies, variable system regimes and load categories with detail network and project risk assessments are its core components. It also includes study of network demand management, smart grids, distributed energy resources (DER), embedded generation, energy storage equipment and grid support systems. Modelling of impact on distribution High (HV) and Low (LV) networks of photovoltaic (PV) units and other renewable, alternative and new technologies is now an organic part of <b>distribution</b> <b>planning</b> processes, as well as understanding of all aspects of massive penetration of plug-in electric vehicles (PEV) in electricity network which is expected in near future. This Master Dissertation firstly formulates position of the <b>Distribution</b> Network <b>Planning</b> in the business model of the majority of electricity utilities and interfaces with numerous stakeholders and describes fundamental components of <b>distribution</b> <b>planning</b> principles. In the next step, it describes limitations of existing <b>distribution</b> <b>planning</b> principles and after the revision of available literature provides concept of new <b>distribution</b> <b>planning</b> principles to meet future technical, economical, technological, environmental and loading challenges. The critical network planning components are also studied. Principles of load forecasting, plant rating, voltage regulation management, system reliability, power quality, network power losses, renewable and smart grid scenarios followed by project and network risk assessment and project economic evaluation are demonstrated. Finally modern <b>distribution</b> <b>planning</b> principles are applied in a real distribution network augmentation project related to long term planning of the airport electricity infrastructure.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of asbestos litigation {{from the early}} 1970 s to the present has become the source of much analysis. One commentator divides this history into several phases: the heroic phase, bureaucratic floundering, adaptation and maturity, search for global settlement, expansion {{of the number of}} cases, and legislative reform in a new era. A neglected aspect of the history of asbestos litigation has been the {{evolution of}} asbestos bankruptcy trust <b>distribution</b> <b>plans.</b> Since 1982 there have been more than 70 corporations which have filed bankruptcy proceedings because of their exposure to asbestos liability. As these corporations emerge from bankruptcy, their plans of reorganization establish trust <b>distribution</b> <b>plans</b> to pay asbestos claimants. These <b>distribution</b> <b>plans</b> provide a unique window into the evolution of a marketplace for the evaluation of asbestos claims among plaintiffs’ lawyers. Notwithstanding the “maturity” 5 of the mass tort, this evolution reveals the historic development of relative values and differentiation among asbestos personal injury claims from the perspective of lawyers who represent plaintiffs.

5000|$|In 1909, the BIA {{purchased}} 280 {{acres of}} land for Big Sandy Band of Western Mono Indians. It was bought {{in order to provide}} the tribe with a secure home where they could grow their food and sale, have cattle, and be free from attacks by non-Indians. In 1958. congress enacted the California Rancheria Termination Act which affected 41 California Rancherias, which also included Big Sandy Rancheria. It terminated the trust status of the lands and Indian status. In 1966, Big Sandy Rancheria organized the BSR Association because of this act. The BSR Association was formed so they could receive common property and be able to approve the <b>distribution</b> <b>plan</b> made by the BIA for the termination of the Rancheria. The plan said that a portion of the Rancheria was given to the American Baptist Home Mission Society as part of the land exchange done by the society and BIA. The <b>distribution</b> <b>plan</b> did not make any plans for improving the Rancheria housing, water, sanitation, or irrigation. The tribe approved the BIA's <b>distribution</b> <b>plan</b> without knowing their rights and obligations, advantages and disadvantages of agreeing with the termination, or even other options they could have done instead. After the approval of the <b>distribution</b> <b>plan</b> by Big Sany members, the BIA revoked their status with the federal government. The BIA never fulfilled the rest of the agreements of the Rancheria Act other than preparing the <b>distribution</b> <b>plan</b> itself. The Rancheria was terminated and its members were ineligible for federal services provided by the BIA. The termination of the Rancheria was the most damaging and had a big impact on the social and economic development of the tribe. This was unfortunate because during their termination the federal government was providing programs to directly assist the Indian tribes. During this time housing conditions, low income, high unemployment, alcohol and drug abuse, and low education attainment worsened. These problems are still seen today. In 1983, the United States District Court Action officially restored the BSR as an Indian Country and the people of the tribe were once again federally recognized Indians. Members holding land in accordance with the BIA <b>distribution</b> <b>plan</b> were able to return their land to trust status whenever they wanted and also the Association's properties.|$|E

40|$|Reasonable <b>distribution</b> network <b>planning</b> is an {{essential}} prerequisite of the economics and security of the future power grid. The comprehensive benefit evaluation of a <b>distribution</b> network <b>planning</b> project can make significant contributions towards guiding decisions during the planning scheme, the optimization of the distribution network structure, and the rational use of resources. In this paper, {{in light of the}} characteristics of the power distribution network, the comprehensive benefit evaluation index system is constructed considering the influencing factors of technical benefit, economic benefit, and social benefit. To eliminate the influence of subjective factors on the evaluation effects and the uncertainty of the influencing factors effectively, the improved interval analytic hierarchy process is employed to calculate the index weights more simply. Moreover, based on the traditional single-factor extension evaluation, this study proposes a multi-level extension assessment model to evaluate the comprehensive benefit of the power <b>distribution</b> network <b>planning</b> project. The model can not only identify the key factors that affect the evaluation effect of the power <b>distribution</b> network <b>planning</b> project, but also can predict the overall development trend of the project. Finally, using a specific urban <b>distribution</b> network <b>planning</b> project as an example, the findings indicate that the comprehensive benefit grade of this power <b>distribution</b> network <b>planning</b> project is “better” due to the benefit grade variable eigenvalue j * ∈ [3. 33, 3. 418] ∈ [3, 4], and illustrates that the model is credible and practical to achieve the comprehensive benefit evaluation of the power <b>distribution</b> network <b>planning</b> project...|$|R
