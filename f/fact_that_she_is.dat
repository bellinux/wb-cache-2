5|$|Protecteur was {{decommissioned}} at {{a farewell}} ceremony on 14 May 2015. Plans for replacing Protecteur {{and her sister}} ship, Preserver, were first brought up in 2004.

5|$|The film also touches upon Hollywood's {{perceived}} {{mistreatment of}} women. While the male actors wear masks, which symbolize {{their ability to}} act, the female Extra #13 does not wear any and is instead expected to simply stand obediently {{and listen to the}} male filmmakers. Her only role is to be an object for men to look upon. The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> able to achieve success by filling this simple role, contrasted against the protagonist's inability to succeed despite his hard work, reveals how differently the film industry views the roles of male and female actors.|$|E

Hayakawa was paid $500 a week, the highest paid of all oriental stars at the time.|$|E

5000|$|Former Stanford President Gerhard Casper {{said the}} {{university}} was [...] "most fortunate in persuading someone of Professor Rice's exceptional talents and proven ability in critical situations {{to take on this}} task. Everything she has done, she has done well; I have every confidence <b>that</b> <b>she</b> will continue <b>that</b> record as provost." [...] Acknowledging Rice's unique character, Casper told the New Yorker in 2002 that it [...] "would be disingenuous for me to say <b>that</b> the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a woman, the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> black and the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> young weren't in my mind." ...|$|R

5|$|Sofya Semyonovna Marmeladova, {{variously}} called Sonya and Sonechka, is {{the daughter}} of a drunkard named Semyon Zakharovich Marmeladov, whom Raskolnikov meets in a tavern {{at the beginning of the}} novel. She is often characterized as self-sacrificial, shy, and even innocent despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> compelled into prostitution to help her family. She also, as Raskolnikov discerns, shares the same feelings of shame and alienation as he does and becomes the first person to whom Raskolnikov confesses his crime, and she supports him even though she was friends with one of the victims (Lizaveta). Throughout the novel, Sonya is an important source of moral strength and rehabilitation for Raskolnikov, and in some interpretations, even considered a Christ-like figure. She is forced to prostitute herself to provide for her family, leading some critics to make comparisons with Mary Magdalene.|$|E

5|$|Belle's yellow ballgown was {{inspired}} by a similar costume Hepburn had worn in the film Roman Holiday (1953). Hahn and a team of male filmmakers designed the ballgown while consuming pizza and alcohol.
