As an <b>investigative</b> <b>judge,</b> Jean-Pierre could not dismiss any information brought to his attention pertaining to the case, especially if it might {{have led to a}} scandal similar to the one implicating an illegal Masonic lodge named Propaganda Due in the 1982 Banco Ambrosiano bank failure in Italy, Jean-Pierre ordered a search of Plantard's home. The search turned up a hoard of false documents, including some proclaiming Plantard the true king of France. Plantard admitted under oath that he had fabricated everything, including Pelat's involvement with the Priory of Sion. Plantard was threatened with legal action by the Pelat family and therefore disappeared to his house in southern France. He was 74 years old at the time. Nothing more was heard of him until he died in Paris on 3 February 2000.|$|E

Pelat's name had been on Plantard's list of Grand Masters since 1989. In fact, Pelat had died in 1989, while he was being indicted for insider trading. Following a long established pattern of using dead people's names, Plantard [...] "recruited" [...] the [...] "initiate" [...] Pelat soon after his death and included him as the most recent Priory of Sion Grand Master. Plantard had first claimed that Pelat had been a Grand Master in a Priory of Sion pamphlet dated 8 March 1989, then claimed it again later in a 1990 issue of Vaincre, the revived publication of Alpha Galates, a pseudo-chivalric order created by Plantard in Vichy France to support the [...] "National Revolution".|$|E

50|$|In addition, {{adversarial}} procedure defenders {{argue that the}} inquisitorial court systems are overly institutionalized and removed from the average citizen.

On 16 March the investigation into Fillon, delegated to three <b>investigative</b> <b>judges,</b> was extended to [...] "aggravated fraud, forgery, and falsification of records".

The investigation was also expanded into possible influence-peddling related to Fillon's consulting firm 2F Conseil, which was previously hired by billionaire Marc Ladreit de Lacharrière, owner of the Revue des deux Mondes, which employed Penelope Fillon. In 2013 de Lacharrière also provided a €50,000 loan to François Fillon, who failed to declare it as legally required. On 24 March, Marc Joulaud, Fillon's former substitute, was formally placed under investigation for embezzlement of public funds.

In 2007, Senegal set up its own special war-crimes court to try Habré {{under pressure from the}} African Union. On 8 April 2008, the National Assembly of Senegal voted to amend the constitution to clear the way for Habré to be prosecuted in Senegal; Ibrahima Gueye was appointed as trial coordinator in May 2008. A joint session of the National Assembly and the Senate voted in July 2008 to approve a bill empowering Senegalese courts to try people for crimes committed in other countries and for crimes that were committed more than ten years beforehand; this made it constitutionally possible to try Habré.

40|$|Silvio Berlusconi var statsminister i til sammen ti år – lenger enn alle sine forgjengere i moderne tid. I disse årene reiste påtalemyndighetene tiltale mot ham i en rekke saker, og det førte til en skarp konflikt mellom hans regjering og parlamentsflertallet på den ene siden og rettssystemet på den andre. Konflikten skyldes imidlertid ikke bare Berlusconis mulige lovbrudd, men er også knyttet til spesielle trekk ved forholdet mellom rett og politikk i Italia. In Italy, the {{judicial}} system enjoys a more autonomous position than in most other European countries, both towards the legislative and the executive powers. The autonomy was guaranteed in the Constitution of 1948, due to the experiences during fascism. From {{the beginning of the}} 1970 s a new generation of radical judges started to reveal corruption among politicians, which resulted in an increasing tension between {{the judicial}} and a part of the political system. During the Berlusconi governments, <b>investigative</b> <b>judges</b> took Berlusconi himself and many other center-right politicians to court for corruption, abuse of power, etc. on a long range of occasions. Berlusconi and his coalition responded with severe attacks on judges for being «communists», seeking to undermine the government and the electoral will of the people, and restricting the autonomy of {{the judicial system}}. The author argues that the conflict between the two systems is due not only the particular characteristics of Italian politics, but must be explained by the particular traits of the judicial system and the strong politicization of parts of the judicial branch as well.

5000|$|On 1 March, Fillon {{abruptly}} cancelled {{a campaign}} {{visit to the}} Paris International Agricultural Show (Salon de l'agriculture) without offering an explanation, taking even his own campaign officials by surprise. He was informed that he was summoned {{to appear before the}} judges and likely to be placed under formal investigation - generally a precursor to an eventual indictment - on 15 March, and subsequently held a press conference at which he insisted on remaining in the race, saying [...] "I will not give in, will not surrender, I will not withdraw, I will fight to the end," [...] and decried what he called an act of [...] "political assassination." [...] In the hours and days following the statement, dozens of campaign members, allies, and supporters rescinded their support for Fillon. Bruno Le Maire, former primary candidate and European and international affairs adviser to the campaign, resigned that afternoon, and the Union of Democrats and Independents (UDI), a centre-right party whose president Jean-Christophe Lagarde backed Juppé in the primary, suspended its participation in the campaign. The cascade of defections followed in subsequent days, with fifteen staffers at campaign headquarters quitting on 2 March, including spokesman Benoist Apparu, treasurer Gilles Boyer, and deputy campaign director Sébastien Lecornu. Fillon's house in Paris was searched that morning on the orders of the three <b>investigative</b> <b>judges,</b> with OCLCIFF officers seizing several documents from the residence by mid-afternoon. Meanwhile, associates of Juppé indicated that he was apparently warming to the idea of stepping in to run if needed, [...] "ready but loyal".|$|R
