25|$|In one dimension, Sperner's Lemma can be {{regarded}} as a discrete version of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>value</b> theorem. In this case, it essentially says that if a discrete function takes only the values 0 and 1, begins at the value 0 and ends at the value 1, then it must switch values an odd number of times.|$|E
25|$|The {{research}} program of Reverse Mathematics uses these formalizations of mathematics in second-order arithmetic {{to study the}} set-existence axioms required to prove mathematical theorems (Simpson 2009, p.32). For example, the <b>intermediate</b> <b>value</b> theorem for functions from the reals to the reals is provable in RCA0 (Simpson 2009, p.87), while the Bolzano/Weierstrass theorem is equivalent to ACA0 over RCA0 (Simpson 2009, p.34).|$|E

25|$|This is {{critically}} important for decoupling high-speed logic circuits from the power supply. The decoupling capacitor supplies transient current to the chip. Without decouplers, the IC demands current faster than the connection to the power supply can supply it, as parts of the circuit rapidly switch on and off. To counter this potential problem, circuits frequently use multiple bypass capacitors—small (100 nF or less) capacitors rated for high frequencies, a large electrolytic capacitor rated for lower frequencies and occasionally, an <b>intermediate</b> <b>value</b> capacitor.|$|E
25|$|The non-real {{roots of}} a real {{polynomial}} with real coefficients can be grouped into pairs of complex conjugates, namely with the two members of each pair having imaginary parts that differ only in sign and the same real part. If the degree is odd, then by the <b>intermediate</b> <b>value</b> theorem {{at least one of}} the roots is real. Therefore, any real matrix with odd order has at least one real eigenvalue, whereas a real matrix with even order may not have any real eigenvalues. The eigenvectors associated with these complex eigenvalues are also complex and also appear in complex conjugate pairs.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the rest}} of the century, paleontologists would be {{occupied}} with several controversies regarding ceratopsian paleobiology. One concerned the stance of the ceratopsid forelimbs. When Marsh first reconstructed the ceratopsid forelimb, he portrayed it in an erect posture. However, when later researchers like Sternberg and Osborn tried to mount the skeletons, they found that the forelimb bones apparently sprawled despite the hindlimbs standing straight up and down. Later researchers like Robert T. Bakker and Gregory S. Paul attempted to revive the erect reconstruction, but continuing research in the 1990s by researchers like John Ostrom, Peter Dodson, and James Farlow found an <b>intermediate</b> <b>value</b> to be better supported.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Differential Power Analysis (DPA) attacks find a {{statistical}} {{correlation between the}} power consumption of a cryptographic device and <b>intermediate</b> <b>values</b> within the computation. Randomization of <b>intermediate</b> <b>values</b> breaks statistical dependence and thus prevents such attacks.

25|$|A prototypical question, posed at {{a global}} level, is whether some {{polynomial}} equation has a solution in F. If {{this is the}} case, this solution is also a solution in all completions. The local-global principle or Hasse principle asserts that for quadratic equations, the converse holds, as well. Thereby, checking whether such an equation has a solution can be done on all the completions of F, which is often easier, since analytic methods (classical analytic tools such as <b>intermediate</b> <b>value</b> theorem at the archimedean places and p-adic analysis at the nonarchimedean places) can be used. This implication does not hold, however, for more general types of equations. However, the idea of passing from local data to global ones proves fruitful in class field theory, for example, where local class field theory is used to obtain global insights mentioned above. This is also related {{to the fact that}} the Galois groups of the completions Fv can be explicitly determined, whereas the Galois groups of global fields, even of Q are far less understood.|$|E

A proof of that fact requires the <b>intermediate</b> <b>value</b> theorem from elementary calculus. This theorem states that a continuous function that produces two values m and n also produces any value that lies between m and n. A function is continuous {{if it does not}} [...] "jump", that is, if its graph can be drawn without lifting the pen.|$|E

500|$|A {{number of}} legal {{restrictions}} {{apply to the}} catching of Cancer pagurus. It is illegal to catch [...] "berried" [...] crabs (females carrying eggs), but since ovigerous females remain in pits dug in the sediment and do not feed, fishing pressure {{does not affect the}} supply of larvae. Minimum landing sizes (MLS) for C. pagurus are set by both the European Union technical regulations and by the UK government. Different minimum sizes are employed in different geographical areas, to reflect differences in the crab's growth rate across its range. In particular, the [...] "Cromer crab" [...] fishery along the coasts of Suffolk, Norfolk and Lincolnshire is subject to a MLS of , rather than the [...] MLS in most of the species' range. An <b>intermediate</b> <b>value</b> of [...] is used {{in the rest of the}} North Sea between the 56th parallel north and the Essex–Kent border, and in the Irish Sea south of 55° N. Around Devon, Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly, there is a separate MLS for males (...) and females (...) [...] The Norwegian catch is 8,500 tons annually, compared to 20,000 tons in the United Kingdom, 13,000 tons in Ireland, 8,500 tons in France, and a total 45,000 tons globally.|$|E
500|$|The above {{calculations}} {{make several}} assumptions, {{such as that}} the level of [...] in the atmosphere has remained constant over time. In fact, the level of [...] in the atmosphere has varied significantly and as a result the values provided by the equation above have to be corrected by using data from other sources. [...] This is done by calibration curves, which convert a measurement of [...] in a sample into an estimated calendar age. [...] The calculations involve several steps and include an <b>intermediate</b> <b>value</b> called the [...] "radiocarbon age", which is the age in [...] "radiocarbon years" [...] of the sample: an age quoted in radiocarbon years means that no calibration curve has been used − the calculations for radiocarbon years assume that the / ratio has not changed over time. [...] Calculating radiocarbon ages also requires the value of the half-life for , which {{for more than a decade}} after Libby's initial work was thought to be 5,568 years. [...] This was revised in the early 1960s to 5,730 years, which meant that many calculated dates in papers published prior to this were incorrect (the error in the half-life is about 3%). [...] For consistency with these early papers, and to avoid the risk of a double correction for the incorrect half-life, radiocarbon ages are still calculated using the incorrect half-life value. [...] A correction for the half-life is incorporated into calibration curves, so even though radiocarbon ages are calculated using a half-life value that is known to be incorrect, the final reported calibrated date, in calendar years, is accurate. [...] When a date is quoted, the reader should be aware that if it is an uncalibrated date (a term used for dates given in radiocarbon years) it may differ substantially from the best estimate of the actual calendar date, both because it uses the wrong value for the half-life of , and because no correction (calibration) has been applied for the historical variation of [...] in the atmosphere over time.|$|E
