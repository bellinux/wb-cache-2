500|$|Caribbean Sound Basin's main studio {{had both}} analog and digital equipment, a 60ft x 70ft x 18ft live room, and three {{isolation}} booths, for vocals, piano, and drums. The group recorded original tracks using Studer 24- and 48-track recorders and transferred {{them to a}} Sony digital recorder. For most songs, MIDI keyboards were played live into a sequencer and left unquantized, while vintage keyboards were recorded to analog tape. Riley said of the process in an interview for Keyboard magazine, [...] "even though we used a sequencer for some stuff, we'd still cut the song live from start to finish. See, the last record was all done with a Synclavier. But this time, we tried to <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> live and raw." ...|$|E
500|$|Pinkner, Abrams, Orci, Burk, Kurtzman, Wyman, and Goldsman {{developed}} the second season's storyline together. Goldsman {{explained that they}} [...] "mapped" [...] out the season [...] "in {{a way that we}} remained fundamentally faithful to". Though they changed certain aspects, they knew where Olivia and Peter were going to start and end up but [...] "got there at different paces than what [...] originally planned". While the first season both focused on Olivia and dealt with discovering the existence of an enemy, the second was designed to [...] " [...] to a very specific type of confrontation" [...] between the two universes. Explained Pinkner, [...] "Season 2 is about the people from 'over there' putting the final pieces of the invasion into play, and explaining why". At the same time, the producers approached the second season as a [...] "journey of self-actualization" [...] and [...] "maturation for our characters." [...] They wanted to make the three main cast members become more comfortable as a team in Fringe Division; Peter thus was written to be more heroic and to go from reluctance to a desire to help his father, while Walter became gradually more independent and [...] "grounded as a human being". They made the secret of Peter's origins one of the main story focuses of the season. While the audience had been made aware of Walter's secret in the season one finale, the producers wanted to [...] "acknowledge it to our characters". All the while Walter was [...] "suffering... and desperately trying to <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> quiet", Olivia and Peter grew closer to the truth. By [...] "giv these things time" [...] to develop, Pinkner strove to avoid focusing just on [...] "event, event, event", instead concentrating on the real consequences of Peter and Olivia's eventual discovery.|$|E

2500|$|Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader {{reviewed}} the film negatively, criticizing it as [...] "simpleminded fun for roughly the first hour, until the movie becomes overwhelmed by its many sources ... There's not much humor to <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> life-size, {{and by the}} final stretch it's become bloated, mechanical, and tiresome." [...] Film critic Nick Davis strongly disliked The Matrix, criticizing aspects such as its unoriginality and its attitudes toward race and gender, concluding that The Wachowskis had raised the bar of filmmaking and special effects, only to waste it on hackneyed, impersonal and political tripe.|$|E
2500|$|Edward Abbey died on March 14, 1989, {{at the age}} of 62, in {{his home}} in Tucson, Arizona. His death was due to {{complications}} from surgery; he suffered four days of esophageal hemorrhaging, due to esophageal varices, which is a recurrent problem with one group of veins. Showing his sense of humor, he left a message for anyone who asked about his final words: [...] "No comment." [...] Abbey also left instructions on what to do with his remains: Abbey wanted his body transported in the bed of a pickup truck, and wished to be buried as soon as possible. He {{did not want to be}} embalmed or placed in a coffin. Instead, he preferred to be placed inside of an old sleeping bag, and requested that his friends disregard all state laws concerning burial. [...] "I want my body to help fertilize the growth of a cactus or cliff rose or sagebrush or tree." [...] said the message. For his funeral, Abbey stated [...] "No formal speeches desired, though the deceased will not interfere if someone feels the urge. But <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> simple and brief." [...] He requested gunfire and bagpipe music, a cheerful and raucous wake, [...] "nd a flood of beer and booze! Lots of singing, dancing, talking, hollering, laughing, and lovemaking." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sam's {{return to}} Walford saw her reignite {{an affair with}} her former, now married lover Steve Owen (Martin Kemp), who was embroiled in a feud with her brother Phil. Medcalf has {{revealed}} that she was extremely nervous when she was informed {{that she would have}} to enact love scenes with Kemp, who aside from his part in EastEnders, was renowned to viewers as a member of the 1980s pop band Spandau Ballet. Speaking about the characters' affair, Medcalf has said, [...] "Steve Owen basically made a play for her because he was using her to get back at Phil. He knew that Phil would hate it [...] they were rivals. But then, in her defence, he was a charmer, and he managed to <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> from his wife. He just played the game very well." [...] The relationship ended in [...] "tragedy" [...] when Steve, in an attempt to kidnap Phil's daughter Louise, was killed in a road accident. Medcalf has suggested that Sam was [...] "devastated" [...] by Steve's death: [...] "She fell for [...] hook, line and sinker. She really believed that he was going to be the man." [...] She subsequently moved on to her former lover Beppe di Marco, but according to Medcalf, that relationship finished because Beppe [...] "thought [...] was a bit full on [...] she was so desperate for a relationship that I think it just scared [...]" [...] Another fling followed with abusive Trevor Morgan, played by Alex Ferns. According to Ferns, the relationship started because Trevor wanted to make his wife, Little Mo (Kacey Ainsworth) jealous. In the storyline, the romance ended when Trevor's true aggressive self emerged.|$|E
