The mode of action of chymotrypsin explains this as hydrolysis takes place in two steps. First acylation of the substrate to form an acyl-enzyme intermediate and then <b>deacylation</b> in order to return the enzyme to its original state. This occurs via the concerted action of the three amino acid residues in the catalytic triad. [...] Aspartate hydrogen bonds to the N-δ hydrogen of histidine, increasing the pKa of its ε nitrogen and thus making it able to deprotonate serine. It is this deprotonation that allows the serine side chain to act as a nucleophile and bind to the electron-deficient carbonyl carbon of the protein main chain. Ionization of the carbonyl oxygen is stabilized by formation of two hydrogen bonds to adjacent main chain N-hydrogens. This occurs in the oxyanion hole. This forms a tetrahedral adduct and breakage of the peptide bond. An acyl-enzyme intermediate, bound to the serine, is formed, and the newly formed amino terminus of the cleaved protein can dissociate. In the second reaction step, a water molecule is activated by the basic histidine, and acts as a nucleophile. The oxygen of water attacks the carbonyl carbon of the serine-bound acyl group, resulting in formation of a second tetrahedral adduct, regeneration of the serine -OH group, and release of a proton, as well as the protein fragment with the newly formed carboxyl terminus ...|$|E

For the next 15 years, it was thought to be the only enzyme capable of adding a chain of ADP-ribose in mammalian cells. During the late 1980s, ADP-ribosyl cyclases, which catalyze the addition of cyclic-ADP-ribose groups to proteins, were discovered.

Carbapenemases can be broadly divided into two different categories based on the mechanism they use to hydrolyze the lactam ring in their substrates. Metallo-β-lactamases contain bound zinc ions in their active sites and are therefore inhibited by chelating agents like EDTA, while serine carbapenemases feature an active site serine that participates in the hydrolysis of the substrate.

It is believed that controlling N-acetyl-L-aspartate levels is essential for developing and maintaining white matter. It is not known why so much N-acetyl-L-aspartate is produced in the brain nor what its primary function is. However, one hypothesis is that it is potentially used as a chemical reservoir that can be tapped into for acetate for acetyl-CoA synthesis or aspartate for glutamate synthesis. This way, N-acetyl-L-aspartate can be used to transport these precursor molecules and aspartoacylase is used to release them. For example, N-acetyl-L-aspartate produced in neurons can be transported into oligodendrocytes and the acetate released can be used for myelin synthesis. Another hypothesis is that N-acetyl-L-aspartate is essential osmolyte that acts as a molecular water pump that helps maintain a proper fluid balance in the brain.|$|E

5000|$|The {{biosynthesis}} of Tyrocidine {{is similar}} to Gramicidin S, and is achieved {{through the use of}} nonribosomal protein synthetases (NRPSs). [...] Its biosynthesis is via an enzymatic assembly consisting of 3 peptide synthetase proteins, TycA, TycB, and TycC, which contain 10 modules. The different tyrocidine analogues (A-D) are not produced by different enzymes, but rather by an enzyme system that is capable of incorporating different amino acids of structural similarity at specified sites. The amino acid sequence is determined by the organization of the enzyme and not by any RNA template.The tyrocine synthetases TycA, TycB, and TycC are encoded on the tyrocine operon. This consists of the three genes encoding for the three synthetases as well as three additional open reading frames (ORFs). These ORFs, labeled as TycD, TycE, and TycF are downstream of the three synthetase genes (see figure 2). TycD &TycE have the highest similarity to members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family which aid in the transport of substrates across a membrane. It has been suggested that the tandem transporters play a role in conferring resistance in the producer cell through tyrocidine secretion. TycF has been identified as a thioesterase (TE) and {{is similar to}} other TEs in bacterial operons used for encoding peptide synthetases. However, the precise function of these TEs remains unknown. [...] The size of the peptide synthetases corresponds to the amount of activation they carry out. TycA is the smallest and activates a single amino acid from one module, TycB is intermediate in size and activates 3 amino acids with 3 modules, and TycC is the largest and activates 6 amino acids with 6 modules (See figure 3).Each module performs all the catalytic reactions necessary to incorporate a single amino acid onto the peptide chain. This is accomplished through the subdomains for adenylation (A), peptityl carrier protein (PCP), condensation (C), and depending on the amino acid position, an epimerization (E). The adenylation subdomain is used in activating the specific amino acid. Each module uses one molecule of the selected substrate amino acid with one molecule of ATP to give an aminoacyl adenylate enzyme complex and pyrophosphate. The activated amino acid can then be transferred to the enzyme bound 4'-phosphopantetheine of the carrier protein with the expulsion of AMP from the system. The carrier protein uses the 4'-phosphopantetheine prosthetic group for loading of the growing peptide and their monomer precursors. Elongation of the peptide chain is achieved through condensation of the upstream PCP onto an adjacent downstream PCP-bound monomer. In certain domains you will find modification subdomains, such as the E subdomain seen in domains 1 and 4 in tyrocidine, which will generate the D-configured amino acid. On the final module is the TE domain used as a catalyst for cyclization or product release. The release of the product from the carrier protein is achieved through acylation of the active site serine of TE in which the decapeptide is transferred from the thiol ether to the serine residue. <b>Deacylation</b> can then occur through intramolecular cyclization or through hydrolysis to give the cyclic or linear product respectively (See figure 4). In the case of tyrocidine, ring closure {{has been shown to be}} highly favorable due to 4 H-bonds helping the decapeptide backbone to adopt a stable conformation (See figure 5). [...] This intramolecular cyclization occurs in a head-to-tail fashion involving the N-terminus of the D-Phe1 and the C-terminus of the L-Leu10 (See figure 4).|$|E

In this investigation we compared the microsomal catabolism of exogenous labeled lysoPC in isolated perfused rat and guinea pig hearts.

There was no significant difference in the incorporation of radioactivity into rat and guinea pig heart microsomes; however, the patterns of radioactivity in lysoPC metabolites were notably different.

In guinea pig microsomes impairment of lysoPC acylation was not associated with any change in the amount of radioactivity in lysoPC because of a compensatory increase in <b>deacylation.</b> In contrast, impaired <b>deacylation</b> in rat microsomes led to significant elevations in the amount of radioactivity in lysoPC. We conclude, therefore, that in intact perfused rat and guinea pig hearts the relative participation of acylation and <b>deacylation</b> in lysoPC clearance differs.

Biochemical and live cell imaging experiments demonstrated that single acylated mutants were completely deacylated with similar kinetic in both cell types.

Furthermore, 2 -BP was able to inhibit in vitro the enzymatic activities of human APT 1 and APT 2, the only two thioesterases shown to mediate protein <b>deacylation,</b> through an uncompetitive mechanism of action. In fact, APT 1 and APT 2 hydrolyzed both the monomeric form as well as the micellar state of the substrate palmitoyl-CoA. On the basis of the obtained results, as APTs can mediate <b>deacylation</b> on membrane bound and unbound substrates, this suggests that the access of APTs to the membrane interface is not a necessary requisite for <b>deacylation.</b> Moreover, as the enzymatic activity of APTs was inhibited by 2 -BP treatment, then the kinetics analysis of protein acylation using 2 -BP should be carefully interpreted, as this drug als...|$|E
40|$|Macrophages {{are thought}} to {{play a central role}} in the {{responses}} of animals to gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Since nothing is known about the metabolism of LPS by these cells, we studied the uptake and <b>deacylation</b> of radiolabeled LPS by thioglycolate-elicited peritoneal macrophages from normal (C 3 H/HeN) and LPS-hyporesponsive (C 3 H/HeJ) mice. Macrophages from both kinds of mice took up and deacylated LPS that were added to the culture medium. Opsonization of the LPS with anti-LPS immunoglobulin G antibodies greatly increased LPS uptake; the opsonized LPS also underwent <b>deacylation</b> at rates that were directly related to the amount of cell-associated LPS. An analysis of the fatty acid composition of the cell-associated LPS indicated that the cells have one or more acyloxyacyl hydrolases that remove the non-hydroxylated fatty acids that are normally substituted to the hydroxyl groups of (glucosamine-linked) 3 -hydroxytetradecanoate residues in lipid A; we also found evidence for <b>deacylation</b> of 3 -hydroxytetradecanoate from the glucosamine backbone. LPS <b>deacylation</b> by macrophages from C 3 H/HeN and C 3 H/HeJ mice was qualitatively and quantitatively similar. Nonopsonized LPS are able to stimulate LPS-responsive cells; in these studies we established that animal cells can deacylate nonopsonized LPS, thus raising the possibility that LPS metabolism may play a role in modulating cellular stimulation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe rate of catalyzed {{hydrolysis}} of the acyl enzyme analogs indolacryloyl-γ-chymotrypsin and furylacryloyl-γ-chymotrypsin in {{the crystal}} has been measured by single crystal microspectrophotometry and {{compared with the}} rate of catalyzed hydrolysis of acyl-γ-chymotrypsin in solution and acyl-α-chymotrypsin both in solution and in the crystal. The maximal <b>deacylation</b> rate {{is the same for}} both species and independent of the physical state. However, the pH dependence of the <b>deacylation</b> rate of crystalline acyl-γ-chymotrypsin shows a 0. 9 unit shift in the pK of the catalytic system which is unique and probably consequent to specific lattice interactions...|$|E
