5|$|After {{years of}} feuding, the Western Railroad {{joined with the}} Boston and Worcester Railroad in 1867 to become the Boston and Albany Railroad (B). The Housatonic Railroad was {{acquired}} by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad (NYNH) as its Berkshire Division in 1892, with most service thus running from Danbury rather than Bridgeport. In 1900, the New York Central Railroad (NYC) leased the B, though the latter retained its independent identity for <b>decades</b> <b>after.</b> <b>The</b> B operated a rail yard and roundhouse just north of Union Station.|$|E

5|$|Global dimming is {{the gradual}} {{reduction}} {{in the amount of}} global direct irradiance at the Earth's surface that was observed for several <b>decades</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> start of systematic measurements in the 1950s. The effect varies by location, but worldwide it has been estimated to be of the order of a 4% reduction over the three decades from 1960–1990. However, after discounting an anomaly caused by the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991, a very slight reversal in the overall trend has been observed.|$|E
5|$|Greater London's {{population}} declined {{steadily in}} the <b>decades</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> Second World War, from an estimated peak of 8.6million in 1939 to around 6.8million in the 1980s. The principal ports for London moved downstream to Felixstowe and Tilbury, with the London Docklands area becoming {{a focus for}} regeneration, including the Canary Wharf development. This was borne out of London's ever-increasing role as a major international financial centre during the 1980s. The Thames Barrier was completed in the 1980s to protect London against tidal surges from the North Sea.|$|E
