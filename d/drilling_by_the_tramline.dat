30|$|Expansion of {{agricultural}} {{development in the}} study area began in the middle 1960 s and 1970 s and many wells were <b>drilled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> private sector for irrigation.

50|$|High {{oil prices}} also fueled the field's fast development. The First World War had caused a run-up in the price, which reached $1.35 per barrel by 1917.

40|$|Two new-drilled {{wells in}} the Prgovo Polje are pumped and {{additionally}} {{tested for the}} water supply of the island Lastovo. The research works were aimed at finding boundary quantitative and qualitative parameters for their optimal exploitation, desalination {{and use of the}} pumped water in the existent water supply system. Collected hydrogeological and hydrogeochemical data indicate the presence of stratified aquifer {{in the western part of}} Prgovo Polje consisting of two poorly connected horizons. Water from the shallower part of <b>the</b> aquifer, <b>drilled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> well MZ- 2 in the carbonate rocks at the edge of polje, is good enough for desalination. The deeper part of aquifer, <b>drilled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> well MZ- 1 in the carbonate cavern below the polje’s clastic sediments, experiences the greater influence of the sea water. Its continuing pumping combined with low quantity of water is the main reason of the ever increasing influence of the sea water (the paper is published in Croatian) ...|$|R
