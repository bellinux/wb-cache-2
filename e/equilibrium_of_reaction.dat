Investigation of the {{mechanisms}} of bioleaching minerals extractant can use their patterns for selective removal of target chemical elements. The estimation of possibility of organic acids to the reactions of lixiviating was executed after classic thermodynamics parameters ? the change of energy of Gibbs (?G 0 f), enthalpy of formation of reaction products (?H 0 f), entropy of reaction (?S 0 f), energy of activating of lixiviating process (Er), constant of <b>equilibrium</b> <b>of</b> <b>reaction</b> (Kr) and energy of crystalline grate of having a special purpose mineral (Ucryst). Algorithm of prognostication of motion of reaction and it energetical possibility is based on determination of ionic force (to the degree of dissociation) of organic acid, pH and temperatures of reaction mixing, degree of dispersion of mineral phase, by correlation of hard phase (the mineral) to the liquid (the solution of acid) and activity of interfusion of reaction components. On the created model of keyer of processes of minerals bioconversion research of him is conducted technological possibility to the acceleration of motion of reactions with participation of organic acids in thousands, or even and millions one times. Due to such device it is possible it is enough operatively to define possibility of that or other biogenic factor to lixiviating of minerals, or vice versa ? to estimate firmness or fitness of separate types of minerals to dissolution organic compounds. Deep research of processes of bioconversion of mineral raw material, that, converting of minerals into soluble (or insoluble) salts with participation of organic acids, allowed to decide a number of theoretical and technological problems of hydrometallurgical methods of extraction of targets chemical elements.

40|$|The {{assembly}} {{and maintenance of}} the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) vacuum vessel (VV) is highly challenging since the tasks performed by the robot involve welding, material handling, and machine cutting from inside the VV. The VV is made of stainless steel, which has poor machinability and tends to work harden very rapidly, and all the machining operations need {{to be carried out}} from inside of the ITER VV. A general industrial robot cannot be used due to its poor stiffness in the heavy duty machining process, and this will cause many problems, such as poor surface quality, tool damage, low accuracy. Therefore, one of the most suitable options should be a light weight mobile robot which is able to move around inside of the VV and perform different machining tasks by replacing different cutting tools. Reducing the mass of the robot manipulators offers many advantages: reduced material costs, reduced power consumption, the possibility of using smaller actuators, and a higher payload-to-robot weight ratio. Offsetting these advantages, the lighter weight robot is more flexible, which makes it more difficult to control. To achieve good machining surface quality, the tracking of the end effector must be accurate, and an accurate model for a more flexible robot must be constructed. This thesis studies the dynamics and control of a 10 degree-of-freedom (DOF) redundant hybrid robot (4 -DOF serial mechanism and 6 -DOF 6 -UPS hexapod parallel mechanisms) hydraulically driven with flexible rods under the influence of machining forces. Firstly, the flexibility of the bodies is described using the floating frame of reference method (FFRF). A finite element model (FEM) provided the Craig-Bampton (CB) modes needed for the FFRF. A dynamic model of the system of six closed loop mechanisms was assembled using the constrained Lagrange equations and the Lagrange multiplier method. Subsequently, the reaction forces between the parallel and serial parts were used to study the dynamics of the serial robot. A PID control based on position predictions was implemented independently to control the hydraulic cylinders of the robot. Secondly, in machining, to achieve greater end effector trajectory tracking accuracy for surface quality, a robust control of the actuators for the flexible link has to be deduced. This thesis investigates the intelligent control of a hydraulically driven parallel robot part based on the dynamic model and two schemes of intelligent control for a hydraulically driven parallel mechanism based on the dynamic model: (1) a fuzzy-PID self-tuning controller composed of the conventional PID control and with fuzzy logic, and (2) adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system-PID (ANFIS-PID) self-tuning of the gains of the PID controller, which are implemented independently to control each hydraulic cylinder of the parallel mechanism based on rod length predictions. The serial component of the hybrid robot can be analyzed using the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>of</b> <b>reaction</b> forces at the universal joint connections of the hexa-element. To achieve precise positional control of the end effector for maximum precision machining, the hydraulic cylinder should be controlled to hold the hexa-element. Thirdly, a finite element approach of multibody systems using the Special Euclidean group SE(3) framework is presented for a parallel mechanism with flexible piston rods under the influence of machining forces. The flexibility of the bodies is described using the nonlinear interpolation method with an exponential map. The equations of motion {{take the form of a}} differential algebraic equation on a Lie group, which is solved using a Lie group time integration scheme. The method relies on the local description of motions, so that it provides a singularity-free formulation, and no parameterization of the nodal variables needs to be introduced. The flexible slider constraint is formulated using a Lie group and used for modeling a flexible rod sliding inside a cylinder. The dynamic model of the system of six closed loop mechanisms was assembled using Hamilton’s principle and the Lagrange multiplier method. A linearized hydraulic control system based on rod length predictions was implemented independently to control the hydraulic cylinders. Consequently, the results of the simulations demonstrating the behavior of the robot machine are presented for each case study. In conclusion, this thesis studies the dynamic analysis of a special hybrid (serialparallel) robot for the above-mentioned special task involving the ITER and investigates different control algorithms that can significantly improve machining performance. These analyses and results provide valuable insight into the design and control of the parallel robot with flexible rods...|$|E

Then, removing the catalyst would also result in reaction, producing energy; i.e. the addition and its reverse process, removal, would both produce energy.
