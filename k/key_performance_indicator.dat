40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{doctoral}} thesis is to design and verify a model measuring complex corporate performance integrating environmental, social, economic and Corporate Governance performance in a selected sector of CZ – NACE. The model was constructed in six steps. A basic set of <b>key</b> <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> was designed by a synthesis of findings from preliminary research and analysis of approaches of international institutions that {{deal with the issue}} of corporate sustainability. Through a questionnaire survey a relevance of a proposed basic set of <b>key</b> <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> was verified. <b>Key</b> <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> were verified on a group of companies which have more than 250 employees and belong to a CZ – NACE 27. 1 Manufacture of electric motors, generators, transformers and electricity distribution and control apparatus. Subsequently, a reduction of a number of <b>key</b> <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> was done by statistical methods so that the explanatory power of the model has been retained as much as possible. In order to model reflect a reality, weights that express an influence of <b>key</b> <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> on corporate <b>performance</b> and sustainability were assigned to <b>key</b> <b>performance</b> <b>indicators.</b> Through a literature research a benchmarks for a reduced set of <b>key</b> <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> were determined in order to quantify a <b>performance</b> gap. <b>Key</b> <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> were aggregated into a single aggregate indicator measuring complex corporate performance by an additive method...|$|R

40|$|Objective. To {{examine the}} {{relationship}} between public perceptions of <b>key</b> <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> assessing various aspects of the health-care system. Design. Cross-sequential survey research. Annual telephone surveys of random samples of adult Albertans selected by random digit dialing and stratified according to age, sex and region (n 4000 for each survey year). The survey questionnaires included single-item measures of <b>key</b> <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> to assess public perceptions of availability, accessibility, quality, outcome and satisfaction with healthcare. Cronbach’s a and factor analysis were used to assess the relationship between <b>key</b> <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> focusing on the health-care system overall and on a recent interaction with the health-care system. Setting. The province of Alberta, Canada during the years 1996 – 2004. Participants. Four thousand adults randomly selected each survey year. Main Outcome Measure(s). Survey questions measuring public perceptions of healthcare availability, accessibility, quality, outcome and satisfaction with healthcare. Results. Factor analysis identified two principal components with <b>key</b> <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> focusing on the health system overall loading most strongly on the first component and <b>key</b> <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> focusing on the most recent health-care encounter loading most strongly on the second component.
