The {{race was}} the final event under series title sponsor Nextel, and the final race using the {{templates}} originally based on the 1964 Holman Moody Ford Fairlane template. Kenseth finished 4th in series points, and as a result, finished in the Top 10 in the standings for six consecutive seasons, tied with Jimmie Johnson for the most.

25|$|In 1982 the Grand Nationals {{at least}} as far as the {{professionals}} were concerned was a one-event championship. Instead of how much was won over the year, the Pros were required to attend at least eight nationals with the top 28 money-winning pros, A or AA, eligible to compete in a special pro Car main in which the winning pro would receive a 1983 General Motors Pontiac Trans Am automobile and the title no. 1 Pro for 1982, continuing the new tradition of giving the number one pro a Trans Am. Kevin McNeal, No. 1 Pro for 1981 also received one, so did Brian's brother Brent in 1980. Brian Patterson was the pro who had earned the most money prior to the Grand National with $3,694 <b>in</b> <b>winnings,</b> so if the previous system of winning the number one plate was still in force, depending on how he did he probably would have won under the old system. Indeed, the situation would have been similar to Kevin McNeal, Brian Patterson had maintained the money lead since May.|$|E
500|$|Ladas {{had some}} success at stud, siring the Classic winners Gorgos (2000 Guineas) and Troutbeck (St Leger). Another {{successful}} offspring was the gelding Epsom Lad, who won the Eclipse Stakes and the Princess of Wales’s Stakes as a four-year-old in 1901. In total, he sired the winners of 196 races and £97,000 <b>in</b> <b>winnings.</b> By 1912 he had been retired from active stud duty and become extremely bad tempered: one writer said that the old stallion had [...] "worn himself out with his restlessness and peevishness". He died on 31 March 1914 at his owner's stud at Mentmore.|$|E
500|$|In 1946–47, Churchill {{extended}} his land-holdings around Chartwell, purchasing [...] Chartwell Farm and Parkside Farm, and subsequently Bardogs Farm and a market garden. By 1948, he was farming approximately 500 acres. The farms were managed by Mary Soames's husband, Christopher and Churchill kept cattle and pigs and also grew crops and market vegetables. The farms did not prove profitable, however, and by 1952, Churchill's operating losses on them exceeded £10,000 a year. By {{the end of}} the decade, the farms and the livestock had been sold. A somewhat more lucrative venture was the owning, and later breeding, of racehorses. In 1949, Churchill had purchased Colonist II, which won its first race, the Upavon Stakes, at Salisbury that year, and subsequently netted Churchill some £13,000 <b>in</b> <b>winnings.</b> In 1955 Churchill bought the Newchapel Stud and by 1961 his total prize money from racing exceeded £70,000. In the 1950s, he reflected on his racing career; [...] "Perhaps Providence had given him Colonist as a comfort in his old age and to console him for disappointments".|$|E

50|$|Harry E. Trotsek (April 18, 1912 - February 5, 1997) was an American Hall of Fame {{trainer and}} owner of Thoroughbred racehorses.

500|$|As a {{professional}} gambler he was undoubtedly a skilled player, once rated amongst the world's top ten backgammon competitors. He won the StJames's Club tournament and was Champion of the West Coast of America. He gained the moniker [...] "Lucky" [...] Lucan, but his losses easily outweighed his winnings, and in reality he {{was anything but}} lucky. He had interests in thoroughbred horses; in 1968 he paid more in race entry fees than he received <b>in</b> <b>winnings.</b> Despite some arguments over money, his wife remained largely ignorant of his losses, retaining the use of accounts at Savile Row tailors and various Knightsbridge shops. Following the births of George (1967) and Camilla (1970), she suffered post-natal depression. Lucan became increasingly involved in her mental well-being, and in 1971 took her for treatment at a psychiatric clinic in Hampstead, where she refused to be admitted. Instead, she agreed to home visits from a psychiatrist and a course of anti-depressants. In July 1972 the family holidayed in Monte Carlo, but Veronica quickly returned to England, leaving Lucan with their two elder children. The combined pressures of maintaining their finances, paying for Lucan's gambling addiction and Veronica's weakened mental condition took their toll on the marriage; two weeks after a strained family Christmas in 1972, Lucan moved into a small property in Eaton Row.|$|E

With his {{longtime}} mechanic, Cort Johnson, he totally rebuilt the P-51C, stripping out all military issue equipment and modifying the wings with [...] "wet" [...] fuel cells. In the 1946 Bendix Trophy race, all the competitors flew similar converted warbirds but Mantz prevailed with an average speed of 435mph.

He was also the last driver to win a race and lap the field, in the fall 1994 race at North Wilkesboro Speedway. He holds the track record at Atlanta Motor Speedway from his polesitting run after the track was repaved in 1997, with a speed of over 197mph.|$|E
2500|$|The Gernatt's were Sir Taurus' co-breeders, {{and stood}} him as stud {{for four years}} {{before he went to}} Blue Chip Farms in 1992. As of 1989, Sir Taurus' {{winnings}} were $484,810, after racing only in 1986 and 1987. Sir Taurus was co-holder of a world record for three-year-old colt trotters on a half-mile track with a time of 1:57.2h; and had set six track records throughout New York State at that time. Sir Taurus' trainer and driver was Jimmy Takter. An easygoing horse with a gentle nature, Sir Taurus turned 30 in 2014 and remains at Blue Chip Farms, now retired, providing school children and scouts with opportunities to visit him.

2500|$|At {{the end of}} the year, Craven left Hedrick {{to drive}} the No. 25 Chevy for Hendrick Motorsports. Craven {{finished}} in the top-five in the first two races of the season. He finished 3rd in the 1997 Daytona 500 behind his teammates Terry Labonte in 2nd and Jeff Gordon in 1st giving Hendrick Motorsports a 1-2-3 [...] sweep of the Daytona 500. While practicing for the inaugural Interstate Batteries 500, Craven crashed hard into the wall. He missed two races due to a concussion suffered from the wreck. Upon his return, he won the Winston Open and finished a then-career-best 19th in points and a total of $1,139,860 <b>in</b> <b>winnings</b> for 1997. After the 1998 season started, the side effects of the concussion began to appear, and Craven was diagnosed with post-concussion syndrome, and was forced to miss several races until he recovered. He returned at his home track at New Hampshire International Speedway later that year won the pole. After four races, he was released permanently from Hendrick, and did not return until the final three races of the season, filling in for Ernie Irvan at MB2 Motorsports.|$|E
2500|$|Busch {{took over}} the No. 97 {{full-time}} in 2001, and ran for Rookie of the Year honors. After John Deere left the team, the No. 97 began the 2001 season unsponsored. After the team signed Rubbermaid to a multi-year contract later in the spring, Busch scored three Top 5's and six Top 10 finishes that year. He and Dale Earnhardt made contact in the 2001 Daytona 500 on lap 85. Earnhardt promptly flipped Busch the bird at 185mph or as described by lap-by-lap commentator Mike Joy in the Fox Sports booth, he simply was telling him [...] "Kurt, you're number one." [...] To this day, Busch recalls this as {{the only time he}} encountered Earnhardt on the track (it was also the last time he and Earnhardt competed in the same race as a result of Earnhardt's fatal crash on the last lap). Busch finished with 27th in the point standings and runner-up for the Rookie of the Year honor's, and earned more than $2 million <b>in</b> <b>winnings.</b> Busch's best finish was third at the spring Talladega race, which was three weeks after scoring his first career Top 5 finish at Texas (fourth), and he added a fifth-place in the Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis. He also won the pole for the Southern 500 at Darlington, where he led 74 laps before a late-race brush with the wall took him to the garage. A month later, he led 38 laps at Martinsville before contact with Ricky Rudd cut his left-rear tire; heavy traffic behind him made matters worse, as Busch had to complete a lap and a half before he could get to the pits. During the delay, the tire carcass wrapped itself around the axle, costing him several laps. Overheating problems halted a strong performance at Rockingham in October, where he led 45 laps.|$|E
