5|$|As {{early as}} June 1775, Colonel Joseph Goreham {{had been ordered}} by General Thomas Gage to raise the Royal Fencible American Regiment of Foot and natives in Nova Scotia {{for the defense of}} the {{province}} against Patriot activity. Arriving at the fort in the summer of 1776, Colonel Goreham and a garrison of 200 Loyalist troops of the RFA did what they could to restore the premises to a defensible condition. But Goreham had not been adequately provisioned and his men lacked <b>everything</b> <b>from</b> victuals to uniforms. Furthermore, the locals were generally sympathetic to the Patriot cause, and refused to assist in rehabilitating the fort, even trying to induce members of the garrison to defect.|$|E
5|$|At the low altitudes {{at which}} Mir orbited {{there is a}} variety of space debris, {{consisting}} of <b>everything</b> <b>from</b> entire spent rocket stages and defunct satellites, to explosion fragments, paint flakes, slag from solid rocket motors, coolant released by RORSAT nuclear powered satellites, small needles, and many other objects. These objects, in addition to natural micrometeoroids, posed {{a threat to the}} station as they could puncture pressurised modules and cause damage {{to other parts of the}} station, such as the solar arrays. Micrometeoroids also posed a risk to spacewalking cosmonauts, as such objects could puncture their spacesuits, causing them to depressurise. Meteor showers in particular posed a risk, and, during such storms, the crews slept in their Soyuz ferries to facilitate an emergency evacuation should Mir be damaged.|$|E

5|$|Brin had {{originally}} {{wanted to build}} three ships, but their great cost forced him to settle for two. At the time, Italy's industrial capacity was insufficient to build the ships out of domestic material. <b>Everything</b> <b>from</b> the iron used to build the hulls to the ships' machinery and guns had to be imported. The Caio Duilio class {{formed the basis for}} the following two ironclad designs, the , also designed by Brin and laid down in 1876, and the , designed by Giuseppe Micheli and laid down in 188182.|$|E
5|$|Built {{at a cost}} {{of about}} £300,000, Tubantia was, {{according}} to author Nigel Pickford, one of the most luxurious passenger ships of the era.

The ship also boasted her name spelled out in lights, suspended between the two funnels. Tubantia could accommodate up to 1,520 passengers: 250 first-class, 230 intermediate-class, 140 special third-class, and 900 third-class passengers. The liner was launched on 13 November 1913, and completed trials in the River Clyde in March 1914.|$|E
5|$|Donna Lee Brien {{stated that}} just as the filmmakers {{attempted}} {{to distance themselves from}} Leigh's murder, the city of Newcastle attempted to distance itself from Blackrock. A 1999 feature in The Sydney Morning Herald discussing cinematic production in Newcastle mentioned <b>everything</b> <b>from</b> Mel Gibson's 1977 debut film Summer City to a short film festival that year, but made no mention of Blackrock. Brien theorised that some of the condemnation the film received may have been due to public frustration with the legal system, as the film achieves justice for the victim, whereas no one was ever convicted of raping Leigh. Brien cited the film as an example of why sensitivity and care must be taken when fictionalising an actual crime.|$|E

5|$|In 1905, Alberta Lieutenant Governor George Bulyea asked Rutherford to {{form the}} new province's first government. As premier, his first task was to win a {{workable}} majority in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta, which {{he did in the}} 1905 provincial election. His second was to provide the apparatus of provincial government: his government established <b>everything</b> <b>from</b> speed limits to a provincial court system. The legislature also controversially, and with Rutherford's support, selected Edmonton over rival Calgary as the provincial capital. Calgarians' bruised feelings were not salved when the government located the University of Alberta, a project dear to the Premier's heart, in his hometown of Strathcona, just across the North Saskatchewan River from Edmonton.|$|E
