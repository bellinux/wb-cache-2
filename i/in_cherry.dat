5|$|The {{number of}} Class C retail {{licenses}} for bars, restaurants, and liquor stores {{is limited by}} population and often by municipal ordinances.

The intense competition can benefit a town by generating {{several hundred thousand dollars}} of revenue from the highest bidder.

5|$|When {{formed in}} 1847, Sullivan County had no boroughs.

5|$|Before {{affecting}} North Carolina, {{the threat}} of Carol prompted a hurricane warning from Wilmington to Manteo. Storm warnings were issued southward to Charleston. Residents evacuated north of Wilmington along the ocean. While passing by the state, the strongest winds remained {{to the east of}} Hurricane Carol, though winds of 90 to 100mph (145 to 160km/h) were reported at Cape Hatteras. Further inland, the hurricane produced a wind gust of 55mph (90km/h) in Wilmington and 65mph (105km/h) <b>in</b> <b>Cherry</b> Point. The winds resulted in agricultural damage to the corn and soy bean crop. High winds caused minor damage to roofs and houses, and also downed some trees and power lines. Near the coast, waves from the storm damaged fishing piers, and flooding was reported in New Bern. High waves also damaged coastal roadways. Damage in the state totaled to around $228,000. Carol passed 100miles (160km) to the east of Virginia, and produced 40mph (65km/h) winds in Virginia Beach. The hurricane produced 4inches (100mm) of rain in Norfolk. Further to the northwest, rainfall from the system alleviated drought conditions in the Washington, D.C. area. Damage was minor from Virginia to Delaware, where light rains fell.
