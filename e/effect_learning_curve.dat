40|$|The {{evolution}} of repetitive scheduling methods {{led to the}} introduction of the learning concept in construction planning. It is common knowledge that performing the same activity repeatedly, and in the same conditions, takes less and less time as the activity is repeated (Gates and Scarpa, 1972). This phenomenon is clear in many construction activities and is known as learning experience or learning effect. The increase in productivity is mainly due to the increasing knowledge acquired by work repetition. Graphic representation is through a learning curve that admits duration decreases as the activity is repeated, according to a predictable and constant learning rate. The Linear Model of logarithmic coordinates (log 10 Y  =  log 10 A - nlog 10 X) was applied to two repetitive construction processes, frequently used in Portuguese construction. The intent was to examine its applicability and efficiency in predicting future performances, and the interest in incorporating the model in new planning methodologies for repetitive construction. In both cases, learning processes were created. Learning <b>effect,</b> <b>learning</b> <b>curve,</b> linear model, planning construction, models, repetitive construction,...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explain the sources of energy system lock-in. It {{presents}} a comparative analysis of the respective contributions of some features of increasing returns to adoption factors, i. e. learning-by-doing, learning-by-searching and returns to scale effects in explaining the technological change dynamics in the energy system. The paper is technically based on a critical analysis of the learning curve approach. Econometric estimation of learning and scale effects inherent to seven energy technologies were performed by the use of several learning curve specifications. These specifications permit to deal with some crucial issues related to the learning curve estimation which are associated with the problem of omitted variable bias, the endogeneity effects and the choice of learning indicators. Results show that dynamic economies from learning effects coupled with static economies from scale effects are responsible for the lock-in phenomena of the energy system. They also show that the magnitude of such effects is correlated with the technology life cycle (maturity). In particular, results point out that, 1) the emerging technologies exhibit low learning rates associated with diseconomies of scale which are argued to be symptomatic of the outset of the deployment of new technologies characterized by diffusion barriers and high level of uncertainty, 2) the evolving technologies present rather high learning rates meaning that they respond quickly to capacity expansion and R&D activities development, 3) conventional mature technologies display low learning rates but increasing returns to scale implying that they are characterized by a limited additional diffusion prospects.

40|$|In a {{large number}} of energy models, the use of <b>learning</b> <b>curves</b> for {{estimating}} technological improvements has become popular. This {{is based on the assumption}} that technological development can be monitored by following cost development as a function of market size. However, recent data show that in some stages of photovoltaic technology (PV) production, the market price of PV modules stabilizes even though the cumulative capacity increases. This implies that no technological improvement takes place in these periods: the cost predicted by the <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> in the PV study is lower than the market one. We propose that this bias results from ignoring the effects of input prices and scale effects, and that incorporating the input prices and scale <b>effects</b> into the <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> theory is an important issue in making cost predictions more reliable.

This study evaluated {{the accuracy of the}} dental implant navigation system and established the <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> according to operation site and operating time. Each dental model was used for drilling 3 missing tooth positions, and a patient tracking module was created. The same dentist performed the drilling test for 5 sets of dental models. CT back scanning was performed on the dental models. Customized implants based on the drilled holes were inserted. The relative error between the preoperative planning and actual implant was calculated. Using the dental navigation system could help dentists position implants more accurately. Increasing the frequency with which a dentist used the navigation system resulted in shorter operations. Longitudinal and angular deviation were significantly (P <  0. 0001 and P =  0. 0164). We found that the same level of accuracy could be obtained for the maxilla and mandible implants.

Patients with pseudomyxoma peritonei underwent CRS and PIC, which was comprised of hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) and/or early postoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy (EPIC), according to a standardized treatment protocol in our institution. Clinicopathological factors were analyzed to determine their prognostic value for survival using univariate and multivariate analysis. Time period comparison was performed to study the <b>effect</b> of a <b>learning</b> <b>curve.</b> Results. A total of 106 patients (43 men and 63 women) were treated. The mortality rate was 3 % and severe morbidity rate was 49 %. The median follow-up was 23 (range, 0 - 140) months. The overall median survival was 104 months with a 5 -year survival rate of 75 %. The progression-free survival was 40 months with a 1 -year progression-free survival rate of 71 %. Factors influencing survival include histopathological type of tumor, use of both HIPEC and EPIC, peritoneal cancer index, completeness of cytoreduction, and severe morbidity.

50|$|The term <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> {{is used in}} {{two main}} ways: where the same task is {{repeated}} {{in a series of}} trials, or where a body of knowledge is learned over time. The first person to describe the <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> was Hermann Ebbinghaus in 1885, in the field of the psychology of learning, although the name wasn't used until 1909. In 1936, Theodore Paul Wright described the <b>effect</b> of <b>learning</b> on production costs in the aircraft industry. This form, in which unit cost is plotted against total production, is sometimes called an experience curve.|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{literature}} review is to evaluate current data on laparoscopic and open appendicectomy {{in order to establish}} a new gold standard in surgery. The authors have reviewed 4190 appendicectomies, 3322 laparoscopic appendicectomies (LA) and 868 open appendicectomies (OA), from 22 studies published between February 1992 and June 1994. Four studies dealt exclusively with pediatric patients (n = 1558). The analysis compares surgical technique, operating time, pathological findings, major and minor complications, postoperative pain and costs. The strongest arguments against LA are the increased rate of major complications, the increase of overall cost and the negative <b>effect</b> of the <b>learning</b> <b>curve.</b> The argument in favour of LA are the significant reduction of minor complications, the shortening of the postoperative hospitalization and of the time to resume full activity. The benefit of LA regarding the amount of analgesia requirement and the time needed to resume normal feeding after surgery is still controversial. The authors have reached the conclusion that LA might emerge as the first choice for appendicectomy. More studies are necessary to confirm this trend...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new graduate level cost analysis course {{that has been}} taught in the Mechanical Engineering Department at the University of Maryland. The objective of this course is {{to provide students with}} an in-depth understanding of the process of predicting the cost of systems. Elements of traditional engineering economics are melded with manufacturing process modeling, life cycle cost management concepts, and selected concepts from environmental life cycle cost assessment to form a practical foundation for predicting the real cost of electronic products. Various manufacturing cost analysis methods are included in the course: process-flow, parametric, cost-of-ownership, and activity based costing. The <b>effects</b> of <b>learning</b> <b>curves,</b> data uncertainty, test and rework processes, and defects are considered in conjunction with these methodologies. In addition to manufacturing processes, the product life cycle costs associated with design, procurement, manufacturing waste, sustainment, and end-of-life are also addressed. This course uses real life design scenarios from integrated circuit fabrication, electronic systems assembly, substrate fabrication, and testing at various levels. As a next step in the development of these educational materials, we propose to expand the involvement of industry in the course and create a set of web-based modules for use in this course, and as supplements to other courses. In addition, we will expand the elements the course addressing environmental costs, particularly the concepts of environmental life-cycle assessment (LCA) and design for environment (DFE). Simplified methodologies and metrics that demonstrate the economic impact environmental issues will be incorporated...|$|R
40|$|Partnering in {{construction}} has been evaluated in {{a myriad of}} studies. The majority of these studies indicate positive outcomes by introducing the concept. However, several researchers have questioned the quality and objectivity of these studies. This thesis presents a novel approach to partnering evaluation {{in construction}} projects. The method presented is based on research articles concerned with network <b>effects,</b> the <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> concept, partnering in construction and performance measurements. The objective has been to develop a practical, objective and in-depth method for evaluating the performance of partnering projects. The novel approach to partnering evaluation is applied in {{a case study of}} three construction projects conducted by the same main contractor. The three projects present a low degree of variation and are all the same type of building. Performance measures are conducted of all involved firms in the projects including engineers, architects, sub-contractors and suppliers. 105 contracts were analysed across the three projects. 67 of these contracts were fulfilled by firms without previous working experience with the main contractor. 38 contracts were fulfilled by firms that had delivered on a similar contract in a previous construction project with the main contractor. An analysis of construction project documentation identified 14 events that affected time, cost and quality performance. The events ranged from minor to major issues and/or disputes. Of these 14 events, 11 were related to firms without previous working experience with the main contractor. The case study concludes that firms fulfilling the same type of contract across several similar projects with the same main contractor performs better than firms without previous experience in a related project type. The <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> <b>effect</b> forms the leading hypothesis for explaining the study findings. By reducing the discontinuities between each project, the overall project performance is improved. The results of this study is expected to be broadly generalizable, as neither the construction type and process nor the main contractor and other firms involved in the study are particularly unique. </p...|$|R
