5000|$|Heating can be {{achieved}} by using several methods, but the most commonly used ones are ‘’induction heating’’ or ‘’oven heating’’. The steel part is passed through a high frequency alternating current magnetic field, which heats the metal part to the required FBE coating application temperature. Typical application temperature for a stand alone FBE is 225° to 245°C. When used as a primer in a multi-layer polyolifine system, application temperature may be dropped based on FBE manufacturer's recommendations, {{in order to meet the}} [...] "inter-coat adhesion" [...] parameters. Special grade FBE coatings which can be applied at temperatures as low as 175 °C has been developed recently by certain FBE powder manufacturers. Other methods of heating are ‘’oven heating’’, ‘’infra-red heating’’, etc. The FBE powder is placed on a “fluidization bed”. In a fluidization bed, the powder particles are suspended in a stream of air, in which the powder will “behave” like a fluid. Once the air supply is turned off, the powder will remain in its original form. The fluidized powder is sprayed onto the hot substrate using suitable spray guns. An electrostatic spray gun incorporates an ionizer electrode on it, which gives the powder particles a positive electric charge. The steel to be coated is “grounded” through the conveyor. The charged powder particles uniformly wraps around the substrate, and melts into a liquid form. Internal surfaces of pipes are coated using spraying lances, which travel from one end to the other end of the <b>heated</b> <b>pipe</b> at a uniform speed, while the pipe is being rotated in its longitudinal axis.|$|E

The material under consideration is aluminium and the free stream fluid is air. The heat transfer rate from the fins, outer wall and the overall heat transfer rate has been calculated and compared for various fin configurations.

40|$|<b>Heat</b> <b>pipes</b> {{have been}} investigated, {{developed}} and applied in many industrial fields since 1964. However, <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> technology {{is still a}} relatively new topic in high heat flux environments such as are encountered in the metallurgical and energy industries. This study focused {{on the development of}} a novel <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> that can be used under high heat flux conditions. The state of the technology prior to this study was that <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> were not suitable for high heat flux applications. Even though numerous patents have been granted for <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> and related applications, most are based on the basic concepts of the conventional <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> as detailed in the literature.

Thus, it was a prime objective of this study to develop a novel <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> that is suitable for such high heat flux operations. In addition, some basic fundamental issues regarding the overall makeup of <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> were also investigated and explained. The fundamental study showed that the film boiling phenomenon can be a serious problem when a conventional <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> is used under high heat flux conditions. Film boiling can make a conventional <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> lose its ability for sustained heat transfer with a small temperature gradient. The flow modified <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> that was invented and studied eliminates film boiling in the evaporator of the <b>heat</b> <b>pipe.</b> In this kind of <b>heat</b> <b>pipe,</b> a flow-modifier element was introduced into the <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> chamber to improve the heat transfer of the two-phase flow. The experimental data indicated that the flow modified <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> was dramatically better than a conventional <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> under a comparable high heat flux load. This novel <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> successfully combined the flow modified <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> and the loop <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> and, thus, effectively overcame film boiling by collapsing the formed films.

The experimental setup was designed for determining the effect of different configurations placed at the inlet of a vertical <b>heated</b> <b>pipe,</b> on the surface temperature, the local and average heat transfer coefficients. The apparatus was made with an electrically heated aluminum pipe with length of 900 mm and inside diameter 30 mm. The inlet configurations included two circular pipes having the same diameter as the <b>heated</b> <b>pipe</b> but with lengths of 600 and 1200 mm, sharp-edge and bell-mouth.

40|$|We {{present results}} from direct {{numerical}} simulations of asymmetrically heated turbulent vertical channel flow at Reτ = 00, Gr = 9. 6 · 105 and P r = 0. 71. The vertical channel represents a canonical geometry {{suitable for the}} analysis of turbulent wall-bounded flows. The differentially heated walls pose as sources of aiding and opposing buoyant forces altering the amplification and suppression of turbulent motions. In comparison with plane channel flow, this offers the possibility for analysing amplification and surpression of turbulent fluctuations close to the heated and cooled walls, respectively. Similar studies concerned with heat transfer in fluids deal with vertical pipe flows heated from the outside such as Metais & Eckert in 1964 [5]. Afterwards, many others followed and studied <b>heated</b> <b>pipe</b> flow in experiments, however they were not able to resolve the small flow scales near the walls. In 2006, Bae et al. [1] presented their DNS results of a strongly <b>heated</b> <b>pipe</b> flow with regard to large density variations. They showed that the flow relaminarizes under heating and analysed different divergence measures from the unheated reference case. In 1997, Kasagi & Nishimura (KN) [3] published detailed statistics obtained with DNS of vertical channel flow. References to earlier works can be found in their paper. The isothermally heated and cooled walls lead to an asymmetric flow structure. Towards the heated channel wall the buoyancy aids the mean flow rate and augments it while the mean flow rate is suppressed near the cooled wall, hereafter denominated as opposing flow side. The peculiarity of relaminarizing flow in the channel merges on the aiding flow side, where the locally higher Reynolds number should lead to increased turbulence intensities. Instead, the turbulence is suppressed there and augmented on the opposing flow side. KN presented an overview of statistical results including statistical moments of momentum and heat transfer as well as stress balances. Their reported turbulent kinetc energy budgets for both the aiding and opposing flow sides depict the dominance of the particular terms but not the interaction between the velocity components and the buoyancy term in particular. In the work presented at the DLES 11 we want to further deepen the analysis of how buoyancy affects the flow behavior and structures and compare with results obtained from plane channel flow...|$|E

In all investigated cases, the irreversibility due to the heat transfer dominates. With the increase of flow period, the highest levels of the total entropy generation rates increase logarithmically in the case of sinusoidal and saw-down flow cases whereas they are almost constant and the highest total local entropy is also generated in the step case flow. The Merit number oscillates periodically in the pulsating flow cases along the flow time.

In general, forced convection flows are best resolved by the LES computations and Cotton-Ismael turbulence model (Cotton and Ismael [1998]). In mixed convection flows the picture changes and the Launder-Sharma closure [Launder and Sharma, 1974] and ‘Manchester fv 2 − ’ model [Keshmiri et al., 2008] are in closest agreement with the direct simulation heat transfer data. Under conditions of maximum heat transfer impairment, the mean flow and turbulence profiles are best captured by the Large Eddy Simulations and LS and fv 2 − models. However, no single scheme could be said to be in excellent agreement with the data examined. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{numerical}} analysis of transient <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> performance including nonconventional <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> with nonuniform <b>heat</b> distributions is presented. A body-fitted grid system {{was applied to}} a three-dimensional wall and wick model, which was coupled with a transient compressible quasi-one-dimensional vapor flow model. The numerical results were first compared with experimental data from cylindrical <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> with good agreement. Numerical calculations were then made for a leading edge <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> with localized high heat fluxes. Performance characteristics different from conventional <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> are illustrated and some operating limits concerning <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> design are discussed...|$|R

In this paper, the abrasive tool with rotating <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> was designed. To validate that the abrasive tool with <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> can safely and steadily grind materials, the structure of abrasive tool was finite element analyzed which included static analysis. Furthermore, the heat transfer performance of <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> was tested. The results indicated that <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> has certain cooling impacts relative to no <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> in machining...|$|R
