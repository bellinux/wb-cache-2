30|$|A {{power system}} network {{topology}} provides information for managing and controlling physical and economical <b>grid</b> <b>operations.</b> The topological structure {{of an entire}} power network is a key input to solving core power system analysis problems such as state estimation, power flow, contingency analysis, and economic dispatch. Therefore, maintaining the correct topology information is of vital importance for reliable and efficient <b>grid</b> <b>operations.</b> The smart <b>grid</b> {{of the future will}} increasingly rely on data from fast sensing units such as phasor measurement units (PMUs) and smart meters in advanced metering infrastructures (AMIs). Therefore, unexpected data corruption will have severe impact on future <b>grid</b> <b>operations.</b> In particular, the corruption of data associated with power system network topology (e.g. the on/off status of circuit breakers (CBs)) could mislead system operators about the real-time topology conditions. As a result, the real-time market price, namely the locational marginal price (LMP), can be distorted because real-time LMP is calculated based on the network topology. This topology error due to data corruption can occur frequently in smart <b>grid</b> <b>operations,</b> which suggests the need for a more rigorous study on the impact of such errors on LMP.|$|R

5000|$|Many {{gas turbine}} power {{stations}} are not operating due to perennial natural gas shortage. Recently, many DG sets (large & medium sizes) are also idling {{throughout the year}} due to better availability of grid power. [...] Alternatively, these power generation units can be put to use for grid reserve service either with liquid / gas fuels when there is unexpected tripping of operating power plants (five nos of 660 MW stations in a short duration) or tripping of a high voltage transmission line to prevent the <b>grid</b> <b>operation</b> below safe limit. This would also allow all the available transmission lines at their full capacity in service without {{the need to maintain}} n+1 reserve capacity for meeting any break down and thus accruing savings in high voltage transmission losses. The unified national grid stability can also be enhanced further by converting the existing back to back HVDC links into HVAC links bypassing the existing converter stations. These are Chandrapur back to back HVDC converter station, Vizag back to back HVDC converter station, Sasaram back to back HVDC converter station, Vindhyachal back to back HVDC converter station and HVDC Sileru-Barsoor link. The yearly cost of ensuring grid safety would be less than 2 paisa per Kwh for the total electricity generation in India.|$|E
50|$|In the United Kingdom, {{the grid}} {{operator}} has commercial agreements {{in place with}} some generators to provide black start capacity, recognising that black start facilities are often not economic in normal <b>grid</b> <b>operation.</b> It is typical of power stations from the CEGB era to {{have a number of}} open-cycle gas turbines (i.e. no heat recovery modules attached) that can run the entirety of the plant necessary to operating a full generating unit; these would normally be started by diesel generators, fed in turn by battery backups. Once up to speed these gas turbines are capable of running the entire plant associated {{with the rest of the}} power station, negating the need to bring power in from other sources. An example of this is the Didcot power stations where the 'A' station (a large coal-fired station consisting of four 500 MW generating units) was fitted with a gas turbine for each unit, enabling black-start capability for the entire station. The newer gas-fired 'B' station built adjacent (consisting of two 700 MW generating modules) was not fitted with its own Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT)'s, instead relying on the 'A' station to start first. With the closure of the 'A' station under the European Union's Large Combustion Plant Directive, the supplies and controls for the small gas turbines have been transferred to the 'B' station, ensuring that the Didcot site maintains independent black-start capability.|$|E
50|$|The {{concept of}} {{dividing}} {{the country in}} to regions by clubbing few states, emerged in seventies to envisage pit head super thermal power stations nearer to coal mines and to supply the generated power to far flung areas by high voltage transmission lines. In last forty years, electricity sector in India has grown many folds and the present power consumption in many big states has exceeded the regional level power consumption at that time. Moreover, the electricity generation from other sources such as natural gas, hydro, nuclear, wind, solar, imported coal, etc. has increased substantially and country has achieved decentralisation and diversification with respect to electricity generation and its consumption. The concept of regions is no more useful by treating the states in a region at par and outside the region differently. Many states forming boundary of a region are unable to draw/export cheaper power from adjoining regions/states due to regional bias / differentiation. Also, the electricity grid has transformed into one national grid {{and the emergence of}} single <b>grid</b> <b>operation</b> has made practically regional grids obsolete. Each state should be considered as one administrative entity/region/area for power transmission and its losses accounting and its commercial settlement as a part of national grid. Section 25 (provision to create regions) and other related sections of the Electricity Act 2003 & proposed Electricity Bill 2014 are unconstitutional in the absence of its ratification by each state.|$|E

5000|$|Short-term {{forecasting}} provides predictions up to 7 days ahead. This kind of forecast is also {{valuable for}} grid operators {{in order to}} make decisions of <b>grid</b> <b>operation,</b> as well as, for electric market operators.Under this perspective, the meteorological resources are estimated at a different temporal and spatial resolution. This implies that meteorological variables and phenomena are looked from a more general perspective, not as local as nowcasting services do. In this sense, most of the approaches make use of different numerical weather prediction models (NWP) that provide an initial estimation of weather variables. Currently, several models are available for this purpose, such as Global Forecast System (GFS) or data provided by the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF). These two models are considered {{the state of the art}} of global forecast models, which provide meteorological forecasts all over the world.In order to increase spatial and temporal resolution of these models, other models have been developed which are generally called mesoscale models. Among others, HIRLAM, WRF or MM5 are the most representative of these models since they are widely used by different communities.To run these models a wide expertise is needed in order to obtain accurate results, due to the wide variety of parameters that can be configured in the models. In addition, sophisticated techniques such as data assimilation might be used in order to produce more realistic simulations.Finally, some communities argue for the use of post-processing techniques, once the models’ output is obtained, in order to obtain a probabilistic point of view of the accuracy of the output. This is usually done with ensemble techniques that mix different outputs of different models perturbed in strategic meteorological values and finally provide a better estimate of those variables and a degree of uncertainty, like in the model proposed by Bacher et al.

Considerable amount of academic research has been focused on understanding the impact of Vehicle to <b>Grid</b> <b>operation</b> on Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs). However, information about the impact of Vehicle to <b>Grid</b> <b>operation</b> on the fuel cells (FCs) of Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs) and Fuel Cell Range Extender Electric Vehicles (FCREEVs) is scarce. Long term tests are required to asses the impact of Vehicle to <b>Grid</b> <b>operation</b> on these fuel cells. The fuel tank volume limitation of the TU Delft Hyundai FCEV does not allow for long term Vehicle to Grid experiments using the operational Vehicle to Grid set-up at the TU Delft Green Village site.
