40|$|The Heroic Era in Polar Exploration {{is filled}} with {{fascinating}} stories about interesting men, and the Race for the Poles is richly described in hundreds of books. The Heroic Era in Polar Exploration coincided with the conception of film technology and rise of commercial cinema, and many polar explorers saw potential in utilising this new technology as a research tool. As a result there exists a range of films from the Polar Explorations, but since their making and initial screenings they have received little attention. The story of these films is also an interesting one, although {{it has not yet}} been written. A few years after the production of the first film cameras, the explorer Carsten Borchgrevink brought one along on his British Antarctic Expedition in 1898. His main sponsor, a newspaper publisher, wanted to make news films, but the cinematograph, the film reel and the filming skills were not sufficiently developed to capture living images from the polar region. Our record of this first attempt at making a polar film is limited to one scene from when the expedition is leaving London. The first explorer to succeed in filming in the Arctic was Anthony Fiala in 1902, and since his breakthrough the cinematograph became standard scientific equipment on all polar expeditions. The Mechanical Era in Polar <b>Exploration</b> <b>came</b> <b>with</b> the aeroplanes, the airships and the telegraph. Roald Amundsen played a major role here; he claimed his idea about using aeroplanes was as important to the polar exploration as Nansen´s use of skies and dogsledges in the heroic era. This article tells the story about explorers with film camera trying to reach the North Pole from Spitzbergen. Wellman, Amundsen, Byrd and Nobile are the main characters. The story of their fantastic expeditions is told by others; this is the story about their films, and how the films from the Arctic developed from just documenting landscape and animal life until they became proper documentary films. Between those types of film, we have had amateur film footage, newsreels, scientific films, travelogues and early documentary films. The article ends with describing the media event around the Italia tragedy in 1928...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{attempts}} {{an historical}} review {{and analysis of}} Salvation Army ministry {{in terms of the}} tension between function and status, between the view that members of the church differ only in that they have distinct roles, and the tradition that some enjoy a particular status, some ontological character, by virtue of their ordination to one of those roles in particular. This dichotomy developed early {{in the life of the}} Church and can be traced throughout its history. Jesus and his community appear to have valued equality in contrast to the priestly hierarchies of received religion. There were varieties of function within the early Christian community, but perhaps not at first of status. Over the first two or three centuries the Church developed such distinctions, between those "ordained" to "orders" and the "laity", as it accommodated to Roman society and to traditional religious expectations, and developed structures to defend its doctrinal integrity. While most renewal movements in the Church from Montanism onwards have involved a degree of lay reaction against this institutionalisation, clericalism has always regained the ascendancy. The Christian Mission, originating in 1865 and becoming The Salvation Army in 1878, began as a "lay" movement and was not intended to become a "Church". By the death of its Founder in 1912 however it had in practice become a denominational church in all but name and its officers had in effect become clergy. At the same time it continued to maintain the theory that it was not a church. The first three chapters explore this development, and the ambiguity that this uncertainty built into its understanding of ministry. In the Army's second century it began to become more theologically aware and the tension between the incompatible poles of its self-understanding led to prolonged debate. This debate is followed firstly through published articles and correspondence mainly from the period 1960 - 2000, and then in the official statements produced by the organisation. Separate chapters attend to the way in which this polarity was expressed in discussion of the roles of women and of auxiliary officers and soldiers of the Army. The culmination of this period of <b>exploration</b> <b>came</b> <b>with</b> the setting up of an International Commission on Officership and subsequent adjustments to the Army's regulations. The conclusion argued however that these changes have not addressed the underlying tensions in the movement's ecclesiology, between the "radical reformation" roots of its theology and the hierarchical shape of its ecclesiology, and attempts to explore future possibilities for the Army's theology of ministry. In retrospect it may be seen that The Salvation Army recapitulates in microcosm the historical and sociological processes of the Church as a whole, its history illustrating the way in which pragmatic measures become entrenched dogma, while charismatic revivals and alternative communities are reabsorbed into the structures of power and control...|$|E

All methods intend {{to speed the}} learning process by mixing exploitation of learned knowledge with exploration of possibly promising alternatives. We consider ɛ-greedy exploration, which is computationally cheap and popular, but unfocused in its exploration effort; R-Max exploration, a simplification of an <b>exploration</b> scheme that <b>comes</b> <b>with</b> a theoretical guarantee of efficiency; and a well-grounded approach, model-based interval estimation, that better integrates exploration and exploitation and achieves the best performance in our example tasks. Our experiments indicate that effective exploration can result in dramatic improvements in the observed rate of learning. 1...|$|R
40|$|NASA's Ames Research Center {{developed}} a new curriculum to educate the space explorers of tomorrow. The Mars Virtual Exploration CD-ROM is exclusively licensed to Modern School Supplies, Inc., of Bloomfield, Connecticut. The CD-ROM allows students to imagine they are residents of a research team at an advanced facility divided into four different domes. Students experience how scientists approach planetary exploration through interactive exercises in ExoPaleontology, Meteorology, Exobiology, and Volcanology. Once the students have learned the facts and have consulted with the experts, they select a potential landing site. Using QuickTimeVR(TM) software, the students get a 360 -degree view of the potential landing terrain. They are then able to virtually explore the four available sites and select the one they feel is best for conducting research. The Mars Virtual <b>Exploration</b> CD-ROM <b>comes</b> complete <b>with</b> a printable teacher's guide and student logbook...|$|R

Although Mulholland wrote of the perilous nature of the face of schist on {{the eastern side of the}} canyon in his annual report to the Board of Public Works in 1911, it was either misjudged or ignored by the construction supervisor of the St. Francis dam, Stanley Dunham. Dunham testified, at the Coroner's Inquest, that tests which he had ordered yielded results which showed the rock to be hard and of the same nature throughout the entire area which would become the eastern abutment. It was in his opinion that this area was more than suitable for the erection of this dam.|$|R
