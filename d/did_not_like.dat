Upon her return to England, she published Domestic Manners of the Americans in 1832. Mrs. Trollope strongly criticised the country and its customs: [...] "I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> them. I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> their principles, I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> their manners, I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> their opinions."

5|$|After the team’s 44 finish, Michigan {{dismissed}} Harry Kipke as head coach. Anderson, {{described by}} Heikkinen as the “greatest line technician in football today,” also resigned as line coach. Asked about rumors that players <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> Kipke, Heikkinen said those reports were probably originated by disgruntled players {{who did not}} make the squad or were in other ways dissatisfied. However, just over a year later, in February 1939, Heikkinen led the opposition when Kipke ran for the University’s Board of Regents and campaigned actively for Kipke’s opponent.|$|E
5|$|All {{members of}} the Junta Grande {{assisted}} to Alberti's funeral, even his political enemy Gregorio Funes.

Saavedra and Funes <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> him, but with the social commotion generated by Alberti's death, they avoided to offer resistance to his nomination.|$|E
5|$|Around 1779 Priestley and Shelburne had a rupture, {{the precise}} reasons for which remain unclear. Shelburne blamed Priestley's health, while Priestley claimed Shelburne had no further use for him. Some contemporaries speculated that Priestley's {{outspokenness}} had hurt Shelburne's political career. Schofield {{argues that the}} most likely reason was Shelburne's recent marriage to Louisa Fitzpatrick—apparently, she <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> the Priestleys. Although Priestley considered moving to America, he eventually accepted Birmingham New Meeting's offer to be their minister.|$|E

5|$|David {{challenges}} Elijah with {{an incident}} {{from his childhood}} when he almost drowned. Elijah suggests that the incident highlights the common comic trope whereby superheroes often have one weakness; he contends David's might be water. While surveying the stored wreckage of the train crash that he survived, David recalls the car accident that ended his athletics career, remembering that he was unharmed and ripped a door off the car {{in order to save}} Audrey. David used the accident as an excuse to quit football because Audrey <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> the violence of the sport.|$|E
5|$|El Greco did {{not plan}} to settle {{permanently}} in Toledo, since his final aim was to win the favor of Philip and make his mark in his court. Indeed, he did manage to secure two important commissions from the monarch: Allegory of the Holy League and Martyrdom of St. Maurice. However, the king <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> these works and placed the St Maurice altarpiece in the chapter-house rather than the intended chapel. He gave no further commissions to El Greco. The exact reasons for the king's dissatisfaction remain unclear. Some scholars have suggested that Philip <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> the inclusion of living persons in a religious scene; some others that El Greco's works violated a basic rule of the Counter-Reformation, namely that in the image the content was paramount rather than the style. Philip took a close interest in his artistic commissions, and had very decided tastes; a long sought-after sculpted Crucifixion by Benvenuto Cellini also failed to please when it arrived, and was likewise exiled to a less prominent place. Philip's next experiment, with Federico Zuccari was even less successful. In any case, Philip's dissatisfaction ended any hopes of royal patronage El Greco may have had.|$|E

5|$|F. emasculata and Pinck Pharmaceuticals are fictitious, but {{pharmaceutical}} companies do send scientists {{all over the}} world looking for plants and animals that could have medicinal use. The appearance of The Smoking Man in a stand-alone episode is unusual, as Chris Carter <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> mixing the mythology and stand-alone episodes. Initially, the producers were wary of releasing the episode so close to the release of the similarly-themed movie Outbreak. In the end, however, they realized that the two entities were separate and stood on their own.|$|E
5|$|Fan {{interest}} in women's wrestling sunk once {{again as the}} year closed, and Sing tired of working there. Moreover, Faye was frustrated with her gimmick. WWF management asked her not to perform the same power moves as the male wrestlers, so instead, Faye was forced to act as comic relief. After a year with the company, Sing asked for a release from her contract. She briefly returned to Japan, but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> the new system, which did not guarantee payouts.|$|E

Though they <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> each other at first, the two women {{proceeded}} to write Ready to Wear, a weekly style guide for The Daily Telegraph which ran successfully for seven years. The column promoted affordable high-street fashion and they used themselves to illustrate which clothing suited which figure. Constantine and Woodall also became the co-founders of Ready2shop.com, a dot-com, but the business venture failed, and investors subsequently lost a reputed £10 million.|$|E
5|$|In June 1944, Kenney was {{appointed}} {{commander of the}} Far East Air Forces (FEAF), which came to include the Fifth, Thirteenth, and Seventh Air Forces. He created the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Air Task Forces to control air operations in forward areas, each for a specific mission, another departure from doctrine. While Kenney was enthusiastic about this innovation, Washington <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> it and, over Kenney's objections, converted the three air task forces into the 308th, 309th and 310th Bombardment Wings. He was promoted to general on 9 March 1945.|$|E
5|$|In {{controlled}} {{studies in}} the lab, Hodson and Olson tried to find evidence of people liking everyday things (e.g. foods, animals) that matched their name initials. No evidence was found, neither for a between-subjects effect (e.g. Judy <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> things starting with J, such as jam, more than Doug liked things starting with J), nor for a within-individuals effect (e.g. Judy <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> jam more than honey).The researchers did discover a small but reliable effect of initials on brand-name preferences within individuals (e.g. Hank did likeHondamore than non-matching brands).They speculated that brand names {{are more likely to}} communicate identity to others than other everyday things.Stieger extended this research by looking at buying preferences for product names. He found that people were disproportionately more likely to buy products matching their initials.The effect mainly occurred for big brands. No correlation was found between the strength of an individual's name-letter effect and the strength of his or her name-letter-branding effect.|$|E
