50|$|Both engines {{featured}} piston skirts {{coated with}} a teflon-based friction-reducing material, and fitted with low-tension, low oil consumption rings. In addition, a new fail-safe cooling mode provided protection even {{in the case of}} a catastrophic coolant loss (such as a punctured radiator). In the event of coolant loss, the engine control unit shuts off fuel to alternate cylinders to reduce the risk of engine damage from overheating. The valves continue to operate, in order to pump cooling air through the cylinders. The cooling system was designed to maintain an ideal engine temperature even when subjected to a prolonged 15 percent gradient in 46 °C (115 °F) weather. A returnless <b>fuel</b> <b>supply</b> <b>system</b> helped to reduce evaporative emissions by providing consistent pressure to the fuel injectors through a high-pressure pump.|$|E

5000|$|The {{domestic}} fuel blending {{market and the}} export market for ethanol remain difficult in Ethiopia for several reasons. The technical precision and regulation necessary for successful blending has prevented its success in Ethiopia; major petroleum sellers like Shell, Total, Mobil, and domestic companies such as National Oil resist the blending of ethanol in petroleum fuels because the <b>fuel</b> <b>supply</b> <b>system</b> is poorly regulated and the fuel is sometimes adulterated. [...] Fuel sellers cannot trust the integrity of their fuel if blended with ethanol, because the ethanol may take up water into the fuel and promote phase separation and worsened contamination. [...] As for the export market, Ethiopia’s ethanol production {{is too small to}} attract large international buyers and has only succeeded in selling ethanol at lower prices than other exporters. Ethiopia’s landlocked location also makes export difficult. The local selling of Finchaa’s ethanol, therefore, provides a sustainable opportunity for Ethiopia, with prices that are affordable but also competitive with the potential export market.|$|E

This method, which is referred to as Energy Logistic Modelling (ELM), is heavily influenced by LCA practices. The viability of using this approach in the decision-making process of choosing fuel for a vehicle fleet is investigated. The emphasis is on organising and structuring life cycle inventories of fuels for entire fleets of vehicles and to give recommendations and guidelines for how to define system boundaries and allocation rules.

40|$|The {{preliminary}} {{motivation for}} the thesis has been to further develop two gas-only <b>fuel</b> <b>supply</b> <b>systems</b> {{that are based on}} only one main fuel tank, compared to the commercialized systems that are all {{based on a minimum of}} two fuel tanks. The two concepts are more compact than the commercialized systems and if these can be further developed they will consequently enable ship types that today cannot be designed with the gas-only installation, to achieve this. The objective of the thesis has been to complete the concept stage of design for the two gas-only <b>fuel</b> <b>supply</b> systems/concepts for three selected PSVs.

40|$|Three {{approaches}} are commonly identified for controlling automobile greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions: reducing travel demand, improving vehicle efficiency and using alternatively (non-petroleum) fueled vehicles (AFVs). Similarly, sector emissions can be decomposed by travel distance, vehicle fuel intensity and fuel GHG ("carbon") intensity. Normalized {{analysis of these}} three factors offers valuable insights. For a broad set of conditions, any stringent GHG emissions limit for the automobile sector implies a limit of comparable stringency for fuel carbon intensity. However, carbon intensity is an abstraction of complex <b>supply</b> <b>systems</b> rather than an observable property of fuels (physical energy carriers) themselves. Carefully considering the locations and current magnitudes of fuel-related emissions implies that the proper policy focus is on upstream sectors that <b>supply</b> <b>fuel</b> rather than the choice of fuels downstream in the auto sector. Therefore, other than fundamental R&D, programs to promote AFVs are not currently warranted for climate protection. In addition to managing travel demand and improving vehicle efficiency, the implied climate policy priority is limiting net GHG emissions in <b>fuel</b> <b>supply</b> sectors. Future work is needed to develop GHG management policies for liquid <b>fuel</b> <b>supply</b> <b>systems</b> involving fungible commodities and dynamic global supply chains...|$|R

40|$|Most of wood <b>fuel</b> <b>supply</b> <b>systems</b> involve procurement, storage, {{chipping}} and transport. What happens {{during this}} chain of handling affects both fuel {{quality and the}} price of the <b>fuel.</b> An optimal <b>supply</b> <b>system</b> has {{to meet the demands of}} end user, fulfil quality criteria and, moreover, maintain an acceptable working environment. Densifying logging residues into bundles (or composite residue logs, CRL) can be an alternative method to improve wood fuel transport and handling properties. This work reports on storage effect on CRLs weighing around 400 - 600 kg, made of green and summer-dried residues using two prototypes bundling machines Fiberpac and Wood Pac. The former presses residues into a continuous long bundle, 75 cm in diameter, and cut it at a length of 3 m. Wood Pac rotates and presses logging residues into a log like unit with the same dimension as Fiberpac-CRLs. Working environment related to microbial presence in the surrounding air during chipping was assessed. Average moisture content was lower in all the CRLs by the end of the storage (February-August) in covered stacks. Higher dry matter losses were measured in CRLs made from green residues compared to the summer-dried ones. The average loss was around 1 % per month in all treatments. Microbial activity was generally higher in CRLs made from green residues irrespective of the machine used. Changes in heating values and ash content were marginal in all the treatments. Ash contents were higher in the CRLs made from green residues than the summer-dried material. Loss of needles during the summer is the main reason since needles normally have high contents of minerals. The concentrations of air-borne fungal and bacterial particles in air samples taken during the chipping and handling of the CRLs were at levels that does not constitute a health risk for the workers...|$|R
