500|$|Four {{months after}} the release of [...] "We Are the World", USA for Africa had taken in almost $10.8million (equivalent to $ million today). The {{majority}} of the money came from record sales within the US. Members of the public also donated money—almost $1.3million within the same time period. In May 1985, USA for Africa officials estimated that they had sold between $45million and $47million worth of official merchandise around the world. Organizer Ken Kragen announced {{that they would not be}} distributing all of the money at once. Instead, he revealed that the foundation would be looking into finding a long-term solution for Africa's problems. [...] "We could go out and spend <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> shot. Maybe we'd save some lives in the short term but it would be like putting a Band-Aid over a serious wound." [...] Kragen noted that experts had predicted that it would take at least 10 to 20years to make a slight difference to Africa's long-term problems.|$|E
500|$|On Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends, [...] "Lovers in Japan" [...] {{transitions}} seamlessly into {{a second}} track entitled [...] "Reign of Love". In an interview with Q magazine, bassist Guy Berryman explained that the band could not {{make up their minds}} about the track listing, as they had discussed that they wanted to keep the album concise with a total of ten tracks and an intended length of under 42 minutes. Champion further stated, [...] "We just preferred to have less titles and more stuff. The album as a whole has got the most on it, but it’s the shortest. We wanted to make it almost impossible for you to not listen to <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> go." [...] In addition, vocalist Chris Martin revealed that the band had wanted to have a [...] "two-in-one" [...] song title, as American recording artist Justin Timberlake had done the same on his album FutureSex/LoveSounds (2006).|$|E
2500|$|While 400 extras were {{recruited}} from agencies for Tag, the actor playing the piece's protagonist was chosen from the street outside the set just before filming began. The crew shot on 16mm film using three cameras to allow editors to cut to different perspectives while keeping each scene to one take. Art director Andy Fackrell warmly welcomed the technique, commenting: [...] "When you can get <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> take, it becomes more natural. The camera zooms in on the guy's face {{when he has to}} make a decision. You feel for the guy." ...|$|E

60|$|It {{is strange}} how {{different}} the sun-dried, ancient, southern {{slopes of the}} world are, from the northern slopes. It {{is as if the}} god Pan really had his home among these sun-bleached stones and tough, sun-dark trees. And <b>one</b> knows <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>one's</b> blood, <b>it</b> is pure, sun-dried memory. So I was content, coming down into Airolo.|$|R
2500|$|December - [...] "The Current Art" [...] noted a {{traveling}} exhibit of American art showing in New York noting many artists {{and the inability}} to cover <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> just <b>one</b> article.|$|R
2500|$|Later on, Dora {{decided to}} give up the job at the Dukes of Nájera to devote herself {{full-time}} to the Moncloa, even though the pay there was lower and the working conditions significantly worse. Later on when asked why she did this, Dora said that she was moved [...] "to see how hard they worked" [...] and that she was also impressed by Escriva and his teaching. [...] Commenting on Escriva's The Way, Dora recalled, [...] "I was very enthused by ... With each thing that I heard, I thought, 'This is for me.' I liked it a lot and I read <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> sitting - I couldn't go to bed without finishing it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 1976 {{fan club}} interview, Holder {{spoke of the}} album's recording: [...] "We {{recorded}} the album in New York, where we spent something like six weeks on it. We did <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> go, more or less, well we also {{did a couple of}} days in a L.A. studio a couple of months before, just to get into the swing of things." [...] To allow the band to create what Holder described as a [...] "really first class album", the band decided to take some time off from touring: [...] "We decided not to rush the album, like we have done on past recording sessions. We wanted to get everything just so. It wasn't just a 'wam bam' job. We had six weeks in the studio to get better and better, so the playing got better, and the sound got better, so yeah in terms of improvement it's a big step ahead. The sound and production is the best yet." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked about}} why [...] "Lovers in Japan" [...] had an {{additional}} track, bassist Guy Berryman {{explained that the}} band couldn't make up their minds, because they had discussed {{that they did not}} want an extra song on the album, and instead they wanted to keep the album concise with a total of ten tracks (and an intended length of under 42 minutes). Champion followed with, [...] "We just preferred to have less titles and more stuff. The album as a whole has got the most on it, but it’s the shortest. We wanted to make it almost impossible for you to not listen to <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> go." [...] In addition, vocalist Chris Martin revealed that the band had always wanted a song title which was two in one. He added that the reason for having two titles in the track listing of Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends was due to American singer-songwriter Justin Timberlake doing it for his last album, FutureSex/LoveSounds (2006).|$|E
5000|$|Regarding {{the musical}} {{direction}} of Epicloud, Townsend told Noisecreep, [...] "Over {{the course of}} the full record, there's sort of new age-y stuff, jazzy stuff, really heavy stuff. We basically cover the gamut. Epicloud is the first record that I felt confident enough to include all those things on one record so it goes between melodic hard rock to schizophrenic heavy metal to country to really ambient stuff and <b>it's</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> place. I'm using a gospel choir, a string section and a horn section for this one as well." ...|$|R

60|$|They {{had never}} been so near a quarrel before. Columbine {{experienced}} a sensation new to her--a commingling of fear, heat, and pang, <b>it</b> seemed, <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> throb. Wilson was hurting her. A quiver ran all over her, along her veins, swelling and tingling.|$|R
2500|$|The {{project of}} co-writing was {{expedited}} by the {{collaboration between the}} four co-writers on the internet working from different geographical locations. With Iñárritu in Los Angeles, Giacobone and Bo in Buenos Aires, and Dinelaris in New York, the script was mainly written through Skype calls and emails. Although this complicated the writing process, Dinelaris said he believed the best ideas in Birdman came from Skype sessions {{at two in the}} morning where he and Giacobone were [...] "cracking each other up". Incorporating the one-shot feature also affected the writing. Bo said [...] "We wrote everything thinking of this one shot, and a lot of decisions that would mostly be taken in the editing room were taken before shooting". The one-shot approach meant the scenes could not be removed or re-ordered in post-production, so the writers needed to be [...] "very, very sure about what was on the page." [...] As a result, it took about a year and a half to complete the final draft. As Dinelaris summarized: [...] "You have to be an idiot to do <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> shot. You have to be an idiot to attempt it. It takes a great, great deal of ignorance to not pay attention to the difficulties and to think you're going to do this. Birdman looks like a good idea now, but [...] we did not know how we would land." ...|$|E

5000|$|C. T. Heaney of PopMatters {{gave the}} album 5 stars out of 10, saying, [...] "it goes {{in so many}} {{different}} directions (some expertly, some unimpressively) that it's hard to tell what, exactly, Diplo is trying to accomplish by putting <b>it</b> <b>all</b> here <b>in</b> <b>one</b> place." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{script was}} based on a play by Greek writer Theo Patrikareas, which had first been {{performed}} in 1963. (Patrikareas had also been involved in Helena of Sydney). A number of changes were made from the original play, including adding and removing certain characters, and opening it up instead of setting <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> the <b>one</b> location.|$|R

"It is as you say, sire," [...] {{answered}} the princess, [...] "and if you examine the basin, {{you will see}} that <b>it</b> is <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> piece, and therefore the water could not have been brought through it. What is more astonishing is, that I only emptied a small flaskful into the basin, and it increased to the quantity you now see." ...|$|R

2500|$|Principal {{photography}} started mid-October 2011, {{and took}} place at Joss Whedon's residence in Santa Monica, California. On the choice of location, he told Studio 360, [...] "First of all, my wife built that house. And I knew from the moment I set foot in it that I would want to film something there. Because <b>it's</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> place, that place informs the mood and the feeling and {{the look of the}} picture so much, and I was really already comfortable with that". Whedon and his wife, Kai Cole, produced the film through their studio Bellwether Pictures. It was filmed entirely in a black-and-white palette over a period of 12 days, in conjunction with cinematographer Jay Hunter. Whedon shot it while on a contractual vacation from the post-production of The Avengers. The cast and crew were informed to keep the project a secret until production was finished. They wrapped their last day of filming on October 23, 2011.|$|R

50|$|The Plymouth Voyager 3 was {{a minivan}} concept car {{revealed}} by Plymouth in 1989. Part of the car's aerodynamic design featured a glass roof. One {{thing that was}} unique about this car was that in a sense it was a miniature tractor-trailer; the cab separated {{from the back of}} the car and could be driven by itself. The rear wheels of the cab were hidden (notice on image) when <b>it</b> was <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> piece.|$|R
60|$|This may be {{answered}} in general, that an Act of Parliament is omnipotent {{with respect to}} titles and tenures of land, and can empower lords and tenants to consent to what else they could not; as to particulars, they cannot {{be answered}} till they are proposed; {{but there is no}} doubt but an Act of Parliament may adjust <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> head.|$|E

5000|$|The mall {{opened in}} June 1958. It {{was billed as}} the largest {{shopping}} centre in Western Canada, with about 30 stores and services.

60|$|Having her {{so close}} {{gave me an}} {{opportunity}} of examining that light sheeny garment she wore always in the woods.

While I was feeling it on her shoulder and looking narrowly at it, she glanced at me with a mocking laugh in her eyes.|$|R
