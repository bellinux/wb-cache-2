System performance was evaluated with nine control subjects (CS) and one transfemoral amputee (TFA) and the results were validated with <b>foot-switches.</b> Results were promising for Initial-Contact (IC) and Toe-Off (TO) across all the subjects. Higher mean differences were found out for Foot-Flat start and Heel-Off, particularly in the case of TFA due to the difference in kinematics behavior compared to CS.

40|$|Objectives: To examine gait in {{children}} with juvenile chronic arthritis (JCA) with reference to velocity, ground reaction forces and temporal parameters. Methods: Fifteen children with JCA were assigned into two groups (uni- and bilateral involvement and classified as pauci- or polyarticular arthritis). Fourteen healthy children participated in the control group. Light-beams {{were used to determine}} walking velocity and the children with JCA rated their pain on a visual analogue scale. Two force plates registered the ground reaction forces and <b>foot-switches</b> were used to obtain temporal parameters. Results: The mean velocity for the children with JCA was significantly less than for the healthy controls. Velocity normalized to height showed a tendency for the children with JCA to walk slower than controls. Differences between JCA children and healthy controls were observed for peak vertical forces during heel contact and push-off. No temporal differences were observed between the groups. Conclusions: Such kinetic and temporal information may provide the clinician with a sensitive tool for pre- and post assessment of intra-articular steroid injections and/or physical therapy...|$|R

The first one, the 1448 series, was a simple 3-watt amplifier with 2 tubes plus 1 tube rectifier, 5-inch speaker, and gain control. In 1963, the 1449 series (later renamed 1457) was released, with a 5-watt amplifier with 3 tubes (and 1 tube rectifier) amplifier, with 8-inch speakers, gain, tone, tremolo (speed and strength), 2 inputs, and one <b>foot-switch.</b> The front end of the case has its top half covered in cloth for the speaker. In 1966, the amp-in-case comes with both the non-tremolo version 1451 (modified from 1448) and tremolo version 1452 (modified from 1449).

Pressure sensitive <b>foot-switches</b> and video recordings of each jump-down from a sagittal view allowed the expression of EMG in temporal relation to limb trajectories and foot-ground contact. Results from EMG analysis demonstrated a stable, global pattern of activation regardless of visual condition and independent of knowledge of the jump height. A generalized strategy of EMG activation was adequate for successful landing on stable height trials, but subjects developed a different default strategy for jumping at random height when inadequate visual update was provided.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is the {{objective}} assessment of gait abnormalities in diabetic patients and the quantification of the benefits of physical activity in improving the gait quality. Patients were equipped with <b>foot-switches</b> and knee goniometers and were asked to walk at their natural pace for 2. 5 minutes. A statistical gait analysis was performed extracting from hundreds of strides the ‘atypical' cycles, i. e. the cycles which do not show the usual sequence of gait phases (heel contact, flat foot contact, push off, swing), the duration of the heel contact phase and the knee kinematics in the sagittal plane. A sample population of 27 non-neuropathic type 2 diabetic patients was examined before and after attending a light-intensity physical activity program that lasted four months. A fuzzy classifier was used to assign a score to the gait abnormalities of each patient in baseline conditions and after the program completion. More than 50 % of the subjects reduced significantly their gait abnormalities and, on the average, the most frequent improvements were the reduction of atypical cycles and heel contact duration.

40|$|Number of {{individuals}} undergoing lower limb amputation {{around the world}} is increasing every year due to vascular diseases or complications associated with conditions such as diabetes and trauma. Limb loss has a profound impact on individual’s physical, mental and vocational abilities, resulting in the degradation of amputees’ quality of life (QOL). Following an amputation, prescription of prosthetic devices serves as an important step in improving the amputees’ QOL. Restoring functional attributes of human gait {{is one of the key}} objectives of lower limb rehabilitation. A number of studies have been carried out to evaluate the use of wearable sensors, especially the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), placed at different body locations to identify gait events/phases. However, a survey of the literature indicated a lack of research in development of a real-time gait event/phase detection for lower limb amputees using a single IMU attached to the shank or the prosthetic pylon.

The stimulator, with controls to adjust amplitude only (50 mA), adapts chosen stimulation sequences to the walking rate of a patient. Pulse duration (50 - 500 ps), frequency (5 - 120 Hz), shape (symmetrical biphasic, monophasic), stimula-tion sequences (16 stride segments) and their cycle (2 - 12 sec), and right/left <b>foot-switch</b> choices are selected for each patient and programmed into a separate unit.

40|$|A {{clinical}} locomotion laboratory {{has been}} developed to provide quantitative information {{in the management of}} gait disorders. The biomedical engineering development of this system identified two major clinical constraints: (a) the need for instrumentation that would not alter the natural gait of the patient and (b) the need for data-processing techniques that would permit analysis and correlation of the large volume of electromyographic (EMg) and kinematic information. The net result has been a unit that incorporates a multichannel telemetry system to capture the EMG and <b>foot-switch</b> information and a television computer system to handle the kinematic information. Gait studies on children with hemiparesis, muscular dystrophy and cerebral palsy have yielded quantitative EMG and kinematic information on the pathomechanics of ambulation in these disorders. Because the information obtained is quantitative, an accurate measure of improvement (or lack of it) after treatment can be documented. Therefore, the locomotion laboratory may have {{an important role in the}} preoperative and postoperative evaluation of children whose abnormal gait may require surgical corrective procedures or rehabilitative treatment including the use of prostheses or orthoses...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{concerned}} with individuals who were unable to effectively dorsiflex their ankle when walking, {{as a result of}} a lesion of the central nervous system (CNS). Indices that categorise and quantify different patterns of calf and anterior tibial muscle activation patterns during treadmill walking have been derived from a sample of fifteen individuals with established hemiplegia following stroke and twelve age-matched individuals without impairment. As subjects walked on a treadmill, force sensitive <b>foot-switches</b> under the heel and first metatarsal head allowed EMG signals from the calf and anterior tibial muscles to be related to phases of the gait cycle. Normal activation periods for each muscle group were identified as percentiles of the gait cycle and indices for muscle activation periods were derived using ratios of integrated EMG during selected periods. Indices were derived that identified statistically significant differences, between normal and hemiplegic subjects, in calf activation during both push-off phase (P< 0. 001) and early stance phase (P< 001), but not activation of tibialis anterior during swing (P= 0. 325) Observation suggested that integrated tibialis anterior activity during swing phase in hemiplegic subjects was not dissimilar to normal subjects, but the profile in hemiplegic subjects tended to lack the normal second peak of activity at initial foot contact.

40|$|Gait {{analysis}} is actually used {{in subjects with}} scoliosis to determine the change in lower limb parameters after surgery, but the reliability of these parameters still remained unknown. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the repeatability of traditional gait parameters in subjects with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) and to estimate the associated standard error of measurement (SEM). A test–retest design was used to assess the reliability of gait parameters at self-selected and fast speeds. A convenience sample of 20 girls aged from 12 to 17  years, with an idiopathic scoliosis (King classification: types I, II or III; Cobb angle 17 – 50 °) participated in the study. Five good trials were recorded on two occasions. The time-distance, kinematic, and kinetic gait parameters were recorded using <b>foot-switches</b> in combination with a three-dimensional motion analysis system (Optotrak) and Advanced Mechanical Technologies Inc., (AMTI) Watertown, MA, USA; force plates. The coefficients of dependability and SEM derived from the generalizability theory were used to assess the reliability. Inter-trial reliability was good for time-distance, kinematic, and kinetic (absolute and normalized) gait parameters except for the medio-lateral ground reaction force (GRF) component and the ankle dorsiflexor moment (ϕ =  0. 60 – 0. 77). Test–retest reliability was higher for the kinetic than for the kinematic parameters. These coefficients ranged from 0. 42 to 0. 58 for the time-distance parameters; from 0. 55 to 0. 88 for the angular displacements and from 0. 25 to 0. 99 for the kinetic parameters. The SEMs were lower than 3. 3 ° for the angular displacements and lower than 8  Nm (0. 15  Nm/kg) and 36  W (0. 54  W/Kg) for the joint moments and powers regardless of the speed.

40|$|Background: Wearable magneto-inertial sensors {{are being}} {{increasingly}} {{used to obtain}} human motion measurements out of the lab, although their performance in applications requiring high accuracy, such as gait analysis, are still a subject of debate. The aim of this work was to validate a gait analysis system (H-Gait) based on magneto-inertial sensors, both in normal weight (NW) and overweight/obese (OW) subjects. The validation is performed against a reference multichannel recording system (STEP 32), providing direct measurements of gait timings (through <b>foot-switches)</b> and joint angles in the sagittal plane (through electrogoniometers). Methods: Twenty-two young male subjects were recruited for the study (12 NW, 10 OW). After positioning body-fixed sensors of both systems, each subject was asked to walk, at a self-selected speed, over a 14 -m straight path for 12 trials. Gait signals were recorded, at the same time, with the two systems. Spatio-temporal parameters, ankle, knee, and hip joint kinematics were extracted analyzing an average of 89 ± 13 gait cycles from each lower limb. Intraclass correlation coefficient and Bland-Altmann plots were used to compare H-Gait and STEP 32 measurements. Changes in gait parameters and joint kinematics of OW with respect NW were also evaluated. Results: The two systems were highly consistent for cadence, while a lower agreement was found for the other spatio-temporal parameters. Ankle and knee joint kinematics is overall comparable. Joint ROMs values were slightly lower for H-Gait with respect to STEP 32 for the ankle (by 1. 9 ° for NW, and 1. 6 ° for OW) and for the knee (by 4. 1 ° for NW, and 1. 8 ° for OW). More evident differences were found for hip joint, with ROMs values higher for H-Gait (by 6. 8 ° for NW, and 9. 5 ° for OW). NW and OW showed significant differences considering STEP 32 (p = 0. 0004), but not H-Gait (p = 0. 06). In particular, overweight/obese subjects showed a higher cadence (55. 0 vs. 52. 3 strides/min) and a lower hip ROM (23. 0 ° vs. 27. 3 °) than normal weight subjects. Conclusions: The two systems can be considered interchangeable for what concerns joint kinematics, except for the hip, where discrepancies were evidenced. Differences between normal and overweight/obese subjects were statistically significant using STEP 32. The same tendency was observed using H-Gait...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION and AIM In children, {{hemiplegia}} is {{a common}} consequence of cerebral palsy (CP) and causes altered selective motor control, weakness and spasticity. A correct classification of children with CP is important to assist diagnosis and clinical decision-making. The classification of spastic hemiplegia proposed by Winters et al. is widely accepted in literature. Type I {{is defined by the}} presence of drop foot in swing, type II by the persistence of equinism throughout the gait cycle, with a possible knee hyperextension in stance. Foot-contact event detection is fundamental in clinical gait analysis, but it is particularly challenging in children with CP due to initial toecontact. In a recent work, we described an algorithm for the automatic segmentation of gait cycles from the <b>foot-switch</b> signal that it is applicable also to pathological gait. The aim of this contribution is to apply this method to a population of CP children to study their foot-floor contact sequences, considering also the sub-phases of stance.

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were 1) to document ankle and subtalar motion during gait in 20 healthy subjects and in 25 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 2) to determine stride characteristics with and without the use of an extended University of California Biomechanics Laboratory orthosis in RA patients with painful ankle and hindfoot deformity. An insole <b>foot-switch</b> system and ankle and subtalar electrogoniometers measured stride characteristics and dynamic range of motion (ROM). Arthritic patients demonstrated less ROM than healthy subjects except for ROM of hindfoot valgus. Arthritic patients also had slower gait velocity and less single limb support (SLS) time. In five new and five current orthotic wearers, a significant increase (p <. 01) in velocity and SLS time occurred with shoes and a further significant increase (p <. 01) occurred with the orthosis.

40|$|Abstract—Mechanical {{methods of}} {{quantifying}} gait {{are more sensitive}} to change than is direct clinical inspection. To assess gait parameters and patterns of patients with stroke, and the temporal changes of these parameters, a <b>foot-switch</b> gait ana-lyzer {{was used to test}} 49 ambulatory patients with stroke and 24 controls. Patients walked significantly slower than controls, with decreased cadence, increased gait cycle, and increased time in double limb support. Patients ' hemiplegic limbs spent more time in swing and stance when compared to controls; their unaffected limbs spent significantly more time in stance and single limb support compared to controls. Patients ' hemiplegic side, when compared with the unaffected side, spent less time in stance and more time in swing. A flatfoot pattern was typically noted on the affected side. General gait parameters improved over time, with the largest changes occurring in the first 12 months. However, the percentage of time spent in double and single limb support, stance and swing, parameters which describe the asymmetrical pattern of gait, did not change over time. Abnormal gait was due to difficulty in moving the body over an unstable limb. Gait analysis can be of importance in documenting abnormalities and determining the effects of therapeutic modalities.

40|$|Following spaceflight crewmembers {{experience}} gait and postural instabilities due to inflight adaptive {{alterations in}} sensorimotor function. These changes can pose {{a risk to}} crew safety if nominal or emergency vehicle egress is required immediately following long-duration spaceflight. At present, no operational countermeasure is available to mitigate postflight locomotor disturbances. Therefore, {{the goal of this}} study is to develop an inflight training regimen that facilitates the recovery of locomotor function after long-duration spaceflight. The countermeasure we are developing is based on the concept of variable practice. During this type of training the subject gains experience producing the appropriate adaptive motor behavior under a variety of sensory conditions and response constraints. This countermeasure is built around current ISS treadmill exercise activities. Crewmembers will conduct their nominal inflight treadmill exercise while being exposed to variations in visual flow patterns. These variations will challenge the postural and locomotor systems repeatedly, thereby promoting adaptive reorganization in locomotor behavior. As a result of this training a subject learns to solve a class of motor problems, rather than a specific motor solution to one problem, Le., the subject learns response generalizability or the ability to "learn to learn" under a variety of environmental constraints. We anticipate that this training will accelerate recovery of postural and locomotor function during readaptation to gravitational environments following spaceflight facilitating neural adaptation to unit (Earth) and partial (Mars) gravity after long-duration spaceflight. The study calls for one group of subjects to perform the inflight treadmill training regimen while a control group of subjects performs only the nominal exercise procedures. Locomotor function in both groups is assessed before and after spaceflight using two tests of gait function: The Integrated Treadmill Locomotion Test (ITLT) and the Functional Mobility Test (FMT). The ITLT characterizes alterations in the integrated function of multiple sensorimotor subsystems responsible for the control of locomotion. This test calls for subjects to walk on a motorized treadmill while we assess changes in dynamic postural stability, head-trunk coordination, short-latency head stabilization responses, dynamic visual acuity, lower limb coordination strategies and gait cycle timing. To make these assessments we measure the following parameters while subjects walk on the treadmill: 1) full body 3 -dimensional kinematics using a motion capture system (Motion Analysis Corp., Santa Rosa, CA); 2) the shock-wave transmitted from heel-strike to the head using triaxial accelerometers placed on the tibia and head (Entran, Fairfield, NJ); 3) vertical forces using an instrumented treadmill (Kistler Instrument Corp., Amherst, NY); 4) Dynamic visual acuity using Landolt Cs presented on a laptop computer located 4 m from the eyes and 5) Gait cycle timing using <b>foot-switches</b> (Motion Lab Systems, Inc., Baton Rouge, LA) attached to the plantar surface of each shoe at the heel and toe. The FMT evaluates a subject's ability to perform challenging locomotor maneuvers similar to those encountered during an egress from a space vehicle. Subjects step over and duck under obstacles along with negotiating a series of pylons set up on a base of 10 cm thick medium density foam. The dependent measures for the FMT are time to complete the course and the number of obstacles touched. To date, we have collected pre and postflight locomotion data from Expeditions 5 - 9 who will serve as part of the control group for this study. Preliminary results comparing the recovery rates in gait control sub-systems obtained from the ITLT and FMT performance showed two recovery patterns: 1) a concordant recovery trend between gait control parameters and FMT performance indicating a restitution pattern of recovery and 2) gait controecovery that lagged recovery in FMT performance suggesting that improvement in locomotor function was attained through a pattern of substitution. These data suggest that recovery of postflight locomotor function may occur through adaptive mechanisms that lead to either restitution or substitution of function. Understanding the modes of postflight readaptation has implications for countermeasure development and testing and in astronaut postflight rehabilitation...|$|R
