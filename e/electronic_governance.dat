40|$|Abstract —The {{primary goal}} of every voting system {{is to ensure that}} {{electorate}} vote counts therefore, <b>electronic</b> democratic <b>governance</b> that provides a transparent and trusted election is needed. The traditional method of voting involves the use of physical paper ballot to casts vote. This is susceptible to time wasting procedures, ballot snatching, lacks voter privacy and question the integrity of fair electoral process. This paper describes our attempt to improve the authentication and integrity of evoting system using multifactor authentication and cryptographic hash function methods. Our system meets two of the key security issues in secured e-voting system: The threat of erring voter’s authentication and integrity of vote transmitted over insecure wireless medium. The results obtained from the test and evaluation of secured electronic voting system based on this model so far shows an avenue to ensure the integrity of the electoral process and as such, encourages the populace to have trust in the election, through the detection of altered votes in wireless medium and voter authentication through One tim...|$|R

At first glance, EM technologies appear to be tools with the potential to stimulate criminal justice innovation: new modes of virtual regulation suited to the digital world that global citizens inhabit. Yet, closer scrutiny of the use of EM across the globe unveils a sprawling, amorphous industry in commercial techno-corrections that both stimulates penal growth in domestic markets and facilitates policy transfer across international jurisdictions.

40|$|Even as the Internet goes pop, federal policymakers {{continue}} to surrender their statutory obligation to regulate communications {{in the first}} instance to extralegal nongovernmental organizations comprised of technical experts. The FCC 2 ̆ 7 s adjudication of a dispute concerning a major broadband service provider 2 ̆ 7 s network management practices is a case in point. There, {{in the absence of any}} enforceable legislative or regulatory rule, the FCC turned principally to the transmission principles of the Internet Engineering Taskforce, the preeminent nongovernmental Internet engineering standard-setting organization. This impulse to defer as a matter of course to such an organization without any legal mechanism requiring as much is flawed. Of course, there is something to be said for an administrative regime that defers first-instance rulemaking authority on technologically complex matters to expert standard-setting organizations. Without more, however, such an approach fails to appreciate the unique role of communications in civic life. Historically, policymakers have required that <b>electronic</b> communications <b>governance</b> be addressed one way or another to the public and its institutional political processes, and not insulated from them. Similarly, today, policymakers, at a minimum, should be required to substantiate their hopeful assumption that the pertinent nongovernmental standard-setting organizations have democratically legitimated authority to regulate {{in the first instance}}. This Article is chiefly a critique of the prevailing 2 ̆ 2 technological 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 economic 2 ̆ 2 approaches to Internet governance.

40|$|Abstract. Distribution of {{multimedia}} copyrighted material {{is a hot}} topic for the music and entertainment industry. Piracy, peer to peer networks and portable devices make multimedia content easily transferable without respecting the associated rights and protection mechanisms. Standard and industry-led initiatives try to prevent this unauthorised usage by means of <b>electronic</b> protection and <b>governance</b> mechanisms. On the other hand, different organisations have been handling related legal issues by means of paper contracts. Now, the question is: How can we relate electronic protection measures with the paper contracts behind them? This paper presents an analysis of current contract clauses and an approach to generate, from them, standardised rights expressions, or licenses, in an as automatic as possible way. A mapping between those contract clauses and MPEG- 21 REL (Rights Expression Language), the most promising rights expressions standard, is also proposed, including an initial relational model database structure. An ontology-based approach for the problem is also pointed out. If contract clauses could be expressed {{as part of an}} ontology, this would facilitate the automatic licenses generation. Generic contracts ontologies and specific intellectual property rights ontologies would be the starting point, together with the presented analysis. ...|$|R
40|$|This report, {{supported}} by funding from The Atlantic Philanthropies and completed in 2008, highlights key issues for {{consideration in the}} development of a data strategy. The Irish Government has stipulated that each Department should develop a formal data or statistics strategy as part of its information strategy. Chapter 1 highlights the purpose of a comprehensive data strategy. It is important that the value of data is understood within an organisation, both for the end users and for the production of data itself. In addition, there is a need for all stakeholders to understand the role of research and data within an organisation, and to this end three models of research utilisation are discussed – the problem-solving model, the interactive model and the dialogical model. Chapter 2 explores the management challenges of data systems, with an examination of data quality issues. The RADAR model, developed by the United Nations Statistics Commission, is proposed to aid in effectively developing and improving the performance of data or statistics strategies. It is necessary to consider, agree and implement the well-managed documentation of data flow within an organisation as part of a data strategy. The definition of ‘data quality’ and ways in which it can be measured are also discussed. Two existing data quality frameworks are presented, one from Canada and the other from New Zealand. The 2005 Data Quality Framework by the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) uses 5 dimensions of data quality: accuracy, timeliness, comparability, usability and relevance. The New Zealand Ministry of Health’s data quality framework is based on the CIHI model and aims to achieve consistent and accurate assessment of data quality in all national health data collections so as to enable improved decision-making and policy development in the health sector. Chapter 3 explores issues of data integration, which refers to a set of processes that allows organisations to access and locate fragmented data, as well as to aid in the creation of accurate and consistent views of the issue that needs to be addressed. There are three main approaches or models of data integration – data warehousing, metadata and data brokering. Each of these have specific advantages and challenges, highlighted within the discussion. Following on from this, a discussion of the legal issues concerned with data integration focuses on the issues of consent, anonymisation, data ownership, research, <b>electronic</b> health <b>governance,</b> liability issues and other systems issues. In terms of data protection, international examples are presented to illustrate the issues with specific regard to children. Finally, ethical issues of data integration are explored, concluding with a discussion on the challenges to the development and use of electronic health records. Chapter 4 illustrates three examples of data strategies from international sources. Data strategies from the Netherlands, Australia and the USA are explored to provide insight into the development of a data or statistics strategy. This report highlights that the development and production of a data strategy is both complex and multifaceted. The cooperation of multiple key players, as well as interdepartmental collaboration, is essential. There are statistical programs and companies available to be third-party members of a data strategy. Nevertheless, the development of a data strategy for children’s statistics raises many legal and ethical challenges that require detailed consideration...|$|R
