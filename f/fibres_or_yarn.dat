40|$|Yarn-based supercapacitors having {{improved}} performance {{are needed for}} existing and emerging wearable applications. Here, we report weavable carbon nanotube yarn supercapacitors having high performance because of high loadings of rapidly accessible charge storage particles (above 90 wt% MnO 2). The yarn electrodes are made by a biscrolling process that traps host MnO 2 nanoparticles within the galleries of helically scrolled carbon nanotube sheets, which provide strength and electrical conductivity. Despite the high loading of brittle metal oxide particles, the biscrolled solid-state yarn supercapacitors are flexible and can be made elastically stretchable (up to 30 % strain) by over-twisting to produce yarn coiling. The maximum areal capacitance of the yarn electrodes were up to 100 times higher than for previously reported <b>fibres</b> <b>or</b> <b>yarn</b> supercapacitors. Similarly, the energy density of complete, solid-state supercapacitors made from biscrolled yarn electrodes with gel electrolyte coating {{were significantly higher than}} for previously reported fibre or yarn supercapacitors...|$|E

40|$|Due to the {{emergence}} of smart textiles and wearable textile systems, the need for electrically conductive textiles has become increasingly clear. Often this conductivity is achieved by integrating metal particles, <b>fibres</b> <b>or</b> <b>yarns</b> into textiles <b>or</b> by coating a textile with a metallic layer. In this research, the potential of another method is explored, namely screen printing a textile with conductive ink. This printing technique is an interesting alternative because it is flexible and cost effective. In this study the conductivity was investigated by measuring the square resistance at different stages (i. e. after printing, abrading and washing, respectively). The printed textiles studied herein exhibit good electrical properties after printing and abrading, respectively. However, after twenty washing cycles, the conductivity decreased considerably. Therefore, in order to improve washability, a protective polyurethane layer was put on top of the printed samples, which resulted in the good conductivity of the fabrics, even after washing...|$|R

When formed into spring-like coils, the torsional actuation within the <b>fibre</b> <b>or</b> <b>yarn</b> generates powerful tensile actuation per muscle weight. For further development of these coil actuators and for the practical application of torsional actuators, {{it is important to}} standardise methods for characterising both the torsional stroke (rotation) and torque generated. By analogy with tensile actuators, we here introduce a method to measure both the free stroke and blocked torque in a one-end-tethered fibre. In addition, the torsional actuation can be measured when operating against an externally applied torque (isotonic) and actuation against a return spring fibre (variable torque). A theoretical treatment of torsional actuation was formulated using torsion mechanics and evaluated using a commercially available highly-oriented polyamide fibre. Good agreement between experimental measurements and calculated values was obtained. The analysis allows the prediction of torsional stroke under any external loading condition based on the fundamental characteristics of the actuator: free stroke and stiffness...|$|R

40|$|Bico fibers include {{bicomponent}} and biconstituent fibers. Bicomponent fibers are synthetic fibers {{made from}} two polymers of different chemical and physical structure. They {{are produced by}} common melt-drawing processes similar to conventional synthetic fibers. [1]. The biconstituent fiber consists of a continuous matrix of one polymer in which a different fiber-forming polymer is dispersed as a second distinct discontinuous phase; it as mix-polymer fiber or fascicular microfiber because the microfibers are connected {{to each other and}} can’t function independently from each other. [2]. Among bicomponent fibers, the bicomponent microfiber is different from the core-sheath type of bicomponent fiber. In theory bico fibers can be made from many polymers but in fact, they are made frequently from CoPET/PA because of cost factors. The core-sheath bico fiber, including such varieties as PE/PP, PE/PET and CoPET/PET are used as bonding fibers for hygiene and medical nonwovens. A cross-sectional morphology of bicomponent fibers can be classified into four main types:”core-sheath”,”side-by-side”,”pie-wedge” and “islands in the sea”. The core-sheath and side-by-side bicomponent fibres are the basic structures of bicomponent fibres. Methods for the preparation of more complex bicomponent nanofibres such as island-in-the-sea and pie-wedges have yet to be developed. This four basic configurations can be adapted in function of the desired <b>fibre</b> <b>or</b> <b>yarn</b> properties. It is for exemple possible {{to limit the number of}} islands to produce conductive yarns. On the other hand it is possible to provide a hole in the pie-wedge configuration to split the filaments even more easily. The newly created bicomponent fibre have new properties and can be applied in many new applications. Bicomponent fibres are actually being applied in the production of : microfibres (hygiene), non-wovens, antimicrobial textiles, elastic fibres, conductive fibres and composites...|$|R

30|$|Figure  4 {{represents}} the variation of compressive strength {{with respect to}} yarn content and yarn length for concrete mix ratio 1 : 1.5 : 3. A particular curve {{represents the}} variation of the compressive strength with volumetric content of yarn. It is to mention that 0  % yarn content represents that no yarn was mixed which indicates plain concrete. From the figure no specific trend with yarn length with yarn content can be observed. Compressive strength increment {{up to a certain}} yarn content that is 0.1  % with yarn lengths can be seen for 10, 15, and 20  mm yarn while that is found to decrease for 25  mm yarn. The rate of increase for 15  mm yarn with 0.1  % content is the largest. With further increase of yarn content the compressive strength is seen to decrease for different lengths of yarn. The reason for irregular variation can be interpreted in the following way. In the case of larger yarn length (yarn length > 15  mm) and content (> 0.25  %) difficulties were encountered to maintain consistency in concrete mix. Since numerous studies have considered reinforcing materials i.e. <b>fibres</b> <b>or</b> <b>yarns</b> as similar to coarse aggregate, the inclusion of jute yarn leads to an increase of coarse aggregate fraction in spite of the fine aggregate fraction which could result in a high porosity in the cement matrix. For decreasing trend with yarn content can be explained that with the addition of jute yarn in concrete reduces the specific gravity of the composites and due to the low specific gravity, inadequate mixing and high porosity of the JYRCC, a lower compressive strength with respect to the reference concrete particularly, when a high volume and larger length of yarn was added. Similar results were obtained by Shimizu and Jorillo (1992). However, the short yarn length with smaller content, which act as short jute fibre was firmly bound the composite constituent, and develop an intact material which results the more resistance to applied force. Similar trends can be observed in Fig.  5 which represents the results for concrete mix ratio 1 : 2 : 4. In Fig.  5, the maximum compressive strength increment can be seen for 15  mm yarn and 0.1  % yarn content. Similar complexities in making concrete composites with different fibre length and content have been reported by Barr et al. (1996). The maximum improvement of compressive strength was found for 15  mm yarn length and 0.10  % content both 1 : 1.5 : 3 and 1 : 2 : 4 mix ratio. The improvements are 33  % and 12  % for 1 : 1.5 : 3 and 1 : 2 : 4 mix ratio with respect to plain concrete, where fine distribution of reinforcing materials i.e. jute yarn are obtained. Finally, {{it can be said that}} JYRCC with < 15  mm yarn cut length with ≤ 0.10  % volumetric dozing is the more promising combination for compressive strength increment.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Textiles are {{increasingly}} studied {{to use them}} as sensing and measuring devices of body parameters. For this purpose {{they need to be}} modified to provide on the one hand reliable and stable electroconductive properties and on the other they should be biocompatible. This can be achieved by depositing electroconductive materials such as metals on the textile surface. Gold is an ideal material to use as it offers the aforementioned criteria and can be applied as a thin coating on the surface of a <b>fibre,</b> <b>yarn</b> <b>or</b> fabric. We developed gold coated yarns that are highly electrically conductive, skin-friendly and stable. In this presentation, we describe the gold coating method and show first results of the characterisation of the coated yarns. A commercially available polyester yarn was coated with a thin layer of gold by using an electroless plating method. The plating solution was optimised towards the concentration of each component, the working temperature and pH. The quantitative analysis of the surface coverage of gold with EDAX and cyclic voltammetry showed in both cases a surface coverage of more than 95 %. For the future, research will be continued to characterise the longterm behaviour of the yarns...|$|R

40|$|Textiles {{have always}} been one of the {{essential}} materials for people and have a great variety of uses such as in clothing, agriculture, medical, automotive and aerospace applications. The sort of properties needed for any type of fabric basically depend on the structure of the fibre surface. Of many geometric attributes {{that can be used to}} describe the surface appearance of a <b>fibre,</b> <b>yarn,</b> <b>or</b> fabric sample, one of the more common is lustre. Mohair and wool fibre surface structure have been studied using optical microscopy and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). Optical microscopy was also used to take fibre diameter measurements. Another technique, goniophotometry, was used to make quantitative lustre measurements of mohair and wool fibres. The surface structure of mohair has got a faint pattern of scales where the scales are generally unpronounced or flat and relatively long. Wool has got a scaly surface structure where the scales overlap leading to interlocking of fibres. The scale configuration on the surface of mohair and wool fibres also differs. A qualitative connection between fibre lustre and the fibre surface structure was found. Because of its smooth surface relative to that of wool, mohair reflects a greater amount of incident light specularly whereas wool reflects most of the incident light diffusely. In general, mohair fibres have a higher lustre than wool due to its less prominent cuticle structure found on its surface. Furthermore, mohair fibres with the smallest diameters give an even higher lustre...|$|R

30|$|According to the {{previous}} study (Mansur and Aziz 1982; Chakraborty 2013; Meddaha and Bencheikh 2009; Bezerra et al. 2004) a number of difficulties are encountered while mixing natural fibres to produce composite. For instance, Meddaha and Bencheikh (2009) mentioned that inhomogeneous distribution of fibres yields bulk and surface flaws. The stress concentration at these flaws would accelerate crack propagation which results lower fracture strength of the mortar specimens (Bezerra et al. 2004). Chakraborty (2013) also reported to use natural fibres in FRCC that the agglomeration could not be avoided. The amount of fibres that {{can be added to}} a mix is limited by the tendency of ‘bailing’ (Mansur and Aziz 1982) where the fibres frequently intermesh and form fibre balls which is critical to be separated. The bailing of fibres results in an ineffectual and segregated mix which produces a highly porous and honeycombed concrete. As a result, a remarkable strength fall of the concrete composite occurs. From the above elucidation, it can be concluded that the fibre mixing plays a vital role in the perfection of mechanical properties of fibre reinforced concrete composites. On the other hand, jute yarn processing covers a long process line during its manufacturing along with fibre opening, cleaning, faults removing and parallelizing (Muttaki 2013). Furthermore, the loose dust is eliminated by softener where dirt falls off and pieces of bark and stick become damaged from the jute fibre during the process (Atkinson 1985). Carding machine initiates the parallelizing of the jute fibre and eventually drafting and doubling section also adds value to it (Atkinson 1985). However, the effect of using jute yarn on the mechanical behaviour of concrete reinforced with jute yarn has yet to be investigated. Additionally, the use natural fibres in concrete made with crushed stone have been universally used. The use of crushed bricks are very common (Rashid et al. 2009) in Bangladesh, parts of India and some other countries having scarcity of stone. Additionally, the mechanical properties of concrete made with crushed bricks are quite different than those made with crushed stone (Mansur et al. 1999; Mohammed et al. 2015). Investigative studies have not yet been conducted to evaluate the effect jute <b>fibre</b> <b>or</b> jute <b>yarn</b> on the concrete made with crushed bricks. To this end, it is very much rationale to determine the effect for exploring potential use of jute for obtaining enhanced concrete with low cost, without affecting the environment and minimum health hazard. With this background, the main objective of the study is to develop jute yarn-reinforced concrete composites and to investigate the effect of yarn length and content (volume fraction) on its mechanical behaviour.|$|R

The textile {{and clothing}} industry is split into clothing (46 %), home and interior (32 %) and the technical sector (22 %) and still represents the major industrial fields. In all three sectors are new applications with functionalized textiles, called ‘smart textiles’. Taking {{a look at our}} modern environment, {{it can be seen that}} people carry more electronic supplements than ever.
