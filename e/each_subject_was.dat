500|$|Asch's {{conformity}} {{experiment was}} conducted using 123 male {{participants who were}} told that they would be part of an experiment in visual judgment. <b>Each</b> <b>subject</b> <b>was</b> put into a group with 5 to 7 confederates (people who knew the true aims of the experiment, but were introduced as participants to the naive [...] "real" [...] participant). The group was shown a card with a line on it, followed by another card with 3 lines on it labeled a, b, and c. The participants were then asked to say which line matched in length the line on the first card. Each line question was called a [...] "trial". The [...] "real" [...] participant answered last or penultimately. For the first two trials, the subject would feel at ease in the experiment, as he and the other [...] "participants" [...] gave the obvious, correct answer. However, after the fourth trial, all of the confederates respond with the clearly wrong answer at certain points such that in 12 of the 18 trials they all gave the wrong answer. The 12 trials in which the confederates answered incorrectly were the [...] "critical trials". [...] The participant could thus either ignore the majority and go with his own senses or he could go along with the majority and ignore the clearly obvious fact. The aim was to see whether the real participant would change his answer and respond {{the same way as the}} confederates or stick with what his eyes plainly told him.|$|E

5000|$|O-levels were {{predominantly}} exam-based; this had advantages {{for students in}} part-time or evening education. Some commentators criticised this mainly exam-based approach as offering only partial proof of the student's overall ability in comparison with other methods (e.g., coursework-based assessment). There was no summative [...] "school certificate": <b>each</b> <b>subject</b> <b>was</b> a separate O-level in its own right.|$|E

A sound understanding of each structure should not only help us appreciate the inherent differences in the school subjects, but also design appropriate pedagogical approaches that can facilitate meaningful learning. The author further suggests broad principles for the teaching of the various subjects in accordance with the respective knowledge structures...|$|R

50|$|The {{study was}} divided into three phases: A twelve-week control phase, where {{physiological}} and psychological observations were collected to establish a baseline for each subject; a 24-week starvation phase, during which the caloric intake of <b>each</b> <b>subject</b> <b>was</b> drastically reduced—causing each participant to lose an average of 25% of their pre-starvation body weight; and finally a recovery phase, in which various rehabilitative diets were tried to re-nourish the volunteers. Two subjects were dismissed for failing to maintain the dietary restrictions imposed during the starvation phase of the experiment, and the data for two others were not used {{in the analysis of}} the results.|$|E

5000|$|This {{study by}} Nadler, Goldberg, and Jaffe {{measured}} {{the effects that}} deindividuating conditions (anonymity vs. identifiable) had on two subject conditions (self-differentiated vs. undifferentiated individuals). The self-differentiated individual {{is said to have}} definite boundaries between inner characteristics identified as self and the social environment. In the undifferentiated individual, such a distinction is less marked. Subjects who were preselected as being self-differentiated or undifferentiated were observed under conditions of high or low anonymity. <b>Each</b> <b>subject</b> <b>was</b> exposed to transgressions and donations made by confederates, and then their own transgressive and prosocial actions were measured. Also, measures of verbal aggression directed toward the experimenter and measures of internal state of deindividuation were taken. Major findings of the study: ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Current appearance-based face {{recognition}} system encounters the difficulty to recognize faces with appearance variations, while {{only a small}} number of training images are available. We present a scheme based on the analysis by synthesis framework. A 3 D generic face model is aligned onto a given frontal face image. A number of synthetic face images are generated with appearance variations from the aligned 3 D face model. These synthesized images are used to construct an affine subspace for <b>each</b> <b>subject.</b> Training and test images for <b>each</b> <b>subject</b> <b>are</b> represented in the same way in such a subspace. Face recognition is achieved by minimizing the distance between the subspace of a test subject and that of <b>each</b> <b>subject</b> in the database. Only a single face image of <b>each</b> <b>subject</b> <b>is</b> available for training in our experiments. Preliminary experimental results are promising. ...|$|R

5000|$|In the experiment, [...] "the {{presentation}} of individual devices to <b>each</b> <b>subject</b> <b>was</b> randomized {{to eliminate the}} possibility of a consistent bias." [...] To determine emotional responses to the medical devices, the researchers used the validated Visual analogue scale where 0 denotes lowest response and 10 shows the strongest response. The Visual Analogue Scale for Aversion, Fear, and Anxiety were used. The study defined [...] "significant needle phobia" [...] as an [...] "aversion, fear, or anxiety score of {{greater than or equal to}} 5." [...] The results of this study showed that the stress-reducing medical devices are effective in reducing aversion, fear, and anxiety towards the medical needles. The results are shown in the table, in the form (Visual Analogue Score) ± (standard deviation).|$|E
50|$|Roger Shepard and Jacqueline Metzler (1971) {{were some}} of the first to {{research}} the phenomenon. Their experiment specifically tested mental rotation on three-dimensional objects. <b>Each</b> <b>subject</b> <b>was</b> presented with multiple pairs of three-dimensional, asymmetrical lined or cubed objects. The experiment was designed to measure {{how long it would take}} each subject to determine whether the pair of objects were indeed the same object or two different objects. Their research showed that the reaction time for participants to decide if the pair of items matched or not was linearly proportional to the angle of rotation from the original position. That is, the more an object has been rotated from the original, the longer it takes an individual to determine if the two images are of the same object or enantiomorphs.|$|E
50|$|SHS was {{measured}} by the suboptimal health questionnaire (SHSQ-25) including 25 items. <b>Each</b> <b>subject</b> <b>was</b> asked to rate a specific statement on a five-point Likert-type scale, based on how often they suffered various specific complaints in the preceding 3 months: (1) never or almost never, (2) occasionally, (3) often, (4) very often, and (5) always. The raw scores of 1 to 5 on the questionnaire were recoded as 0 to 4. SHS scores were calculated for each respondent by summing the ratings for the 25 items. A high score represents a high level of SHS (poor health). The Cronbach’s α coefficient of the SHSQ-25 was 0.91, indicating good internal consistency. The final questionnaire congregated into a score (SHSQ-25) which could significantly distinguish among several abnormal conditions and {{could be used as a}} translational medicine instrument for health measuring in the general population.|$|E

5000|$|In another experiment, {{subjects}} had {{to predict the}} outcome of thirty coin tosses. The feedback was rigged so that <b>each</b> <b>subject</b> <b>was</b> right exactly half the time, but the groups differed in where their [...] "hits" [...] occurred. Some were told that their early guesses were accurate. Others were told that their successes were distributed evenly through the thirty trials. Afterwards, they were surveyed about their performance. Subjects with early [...] "hits" [...] overestimated their total successes and had higher expectations of how they would perform on future guessing games. This result resembles the irrational primacy effect in which people give greater weight to information that occurs earlier in a series. Forty percent of the subjects believed their performance on this chance task would improve with practice, and twenty-five percent said that distraction would impair their performance.|$|E

The result of this audio-visual stimulation was amazing: the patients, some who had Broca's aphasia for multiple decades, were able to mimic the movements of the mouth in real time and speak fluently. Though there are various methods of treatment for Broca's aphasia as stated on this page, speech entrainment provides a potential future therapeutic method that produces drastic results simply not seen in any other method of treatment.|$|E
