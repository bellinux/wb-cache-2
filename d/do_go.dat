25|$|Opponents {{say that}} nuclear power poses many threats {{to people and}} the environment, and that costs do not justify benefits. Threats include health risks and {{environmental}} damage from uranium mining, processing and transport, the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation or sabotage, and the unsolved problem of radioactive nuclear waste. Another environmental issue is discharge of hot water into the sea. The hot water modifies the environmental conditions for marine flora and fauna. They also contend that reactors themselves are enormously complex machines where many things can and <b>do</b> <b>go</b> wrong, {{and there have been}} many serious nuclear accidents. Critics do not believe that these risks can be reduced through new technology. They argue that when all the energy-intensive stages of the nuclear fuel chain are considered, from uranium mining to nuclear decommissioning, nuclear power is not a low-carbon electricity source. Those countries that do not contain uranium mines cannot achieve energy independence through existing nuclear power technologies. Actual construction costs often exceed estimates, and spent fuel management costs do not have a clear time limit.|$|E

500|$|Unlike {{other girl}} detectives, Nancy {{does not go}} to school (for reasons that are never explained, but {{assuming}} because she has finished), and she thus has complete autonomy. Similar characters, such as Kay Tracey, <b>do</b> <b>go</b> to school, and not only lose a degree of independence but also of authority.

500|$|Following {{the high}} mintage of the Bicentennial piece, {{the number of}} pieces struck per year declined. [...] However, in 1979, Mint Director Stella B.

[...] They <b>do</b> <b>go</b> somewhere, though, so someone must want them." [...] By then, more than 2.5billion Kennedy half dollars had been struck, more than all previously struck half dollars combined. [...] The New York Times numismatic columnist Ed Reiter suggested that hoarding had continued even into the base-metal era, accounting for the shortage of pieces in commerce. [...] 1979-80 saw the destruction of many early Kennedy half dollars, as record high silver prices caused extensive melting of silver coins for their [...] metal content.|$|E

[...] This sentiment was re-iterated by executive producer Brad Falchuk, after the characters kissed for the first time. He revealed that their relationship would not run smoothly, and observed that once couples start dating, [...] "Everything goes to hell." [...] Colfer suggested that Kurt returning to McKinley may cause difficulties in their relationship, but noted [...] "Distance makes the heart grow fonder, right? That’s what they tell me. So even if they <b>do</b> <b>go</b> through some bumps in the road, {{it would be very}} realistic."

The song, a drum'n'bass version of the theme tune from The Magnificent Seven with vocal samples from DJ Fleka of Serbian radio station B92, was recorded on 4 September 1995. On 5 September 1995, Drummond and Cauty claimed they would [...] "never make any more records". Drummond said, [...] "What do you expect us to <b>do,</b> <b>go</b> and make a jungle record?"; Cauty added [...] "Yeah, like a jungle novelty record with some strings on it or something. It would just be sad wouldn't it? We're too old." [...] NME gleefully informed their readers, [...] "The K Foundation's contribution to the 'Help' LP is a jungle track." [...] Help was released on 9 September 1995.|$|E
500|$|At times Kiedis {{has also}} resented singing the song, {{especially}} during instances {{when he felt}} distanced from the song's lyrics. In the past few years, however, Kiedis has experienced a revival in interest: [...] "Although {{there have been times}} when I was over , I've rediscovered it and now I feel close to it and it still has power, and life, and purpose as a song." [...] Frusciante believed that the flexibility of [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] has contributed to its success: [...] "A lot of the time that is one of the ingredients of a hit; you can hear it over and over and it will still always mean new things, but you <b>do</b> <b>go</b> through cycles." [...] Flea believes that the reason [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] had a recent revival in relevancy was due to Frusciante's return to the band from 1998 to 2009 after quitting in 1992. Flea believed that it was vital to have the four members who wrote the track together.|$|E

500|$|Little Mix co-wrote [...] "DNA" [...] with TMS and Iain James. TMS {{developed}} the song's guitar riff, drum beats and synths. It received additional vocal engineering from Daniel Aslet and Ben Collier. Serban Ghenea mixed the track at MixStar Studios in Virginia Beach, USA, and Tom Coyne {{was responsible for}} the song's mastering. [...] "DNA" [...] was based on the emotions a girl develops when she first meets and dates a boy. In an interview with Emily Laurence of Seventeen, Perrie Edwards explained: [...] "When a girl first gets with a boy, that kind of romance makes you feel really giddy and happy. That's what 'DNA' is about." [...] The group wrote [...] "DNA" [...] as a unique love song by coming up with scientific ideas that would match with love. It was also written as a song about obsession. Speaking to Tim Jonze of The Guardian, Leigh-Anne Pinnock mentioned: [...] "It's not just a love song, it's about being obsessed with someone to the extreme. And sometimes when things go bad you <b>do</b> <b>go</b> like that, you stalk them on Facebook..." ...|$|E
500|$|Terry Atkinson of Los Angeles Times {{viewed the}} album as {{offering}} [...] "an amazing variety of tones, moods, and topics and a consistently powerful level of expression". Although disliking [...] "Big Time", Atkinson concludes So is [...] "a great album, possibly Gabriel's best". Steve Hochman, also of Los Angeles Times, praised Gabriel's reinvention too, describing it as [...] "real progress" [...] {{compared to the}} contemporaneous work of other progressive rock acts such as Genesis, GTR and Marillion. Chicago Tribunes Lynn Van Matre praised the album's [...] "wave of funky rhythms" [...] and called for more appreciation of Gabriel's talent, but noted a lack of [...] "quirkiness" [...] and {{said there were no}} tracks as impactful as [...] "Biko", a single from his third eponymous album Peter Gabriel or [...] "Melt". Robert Christgau was also lukewarm in The Village Voice, writing that [...] "Gabriel's so smart he knows rhythm is what makes music go, which relieves him of humdrum melodic responsibilities but doesn't get him up on the one—smart guys <b>do</b> <b>go</b> for texture in a pinch." ...|$|E
500|$|Some Arabians, {{though not}} all, have 5 lumbar {{vertebrae}} {{instead of the}} usual 6, and 17 pairs of ribs rather than 18. A quality Arabian has both a relatively horizontal croup and a properly angled pelvis as well as good croup length and depth to the hip (determined by the length of the pelvis), that allows agility and impulsion. A misconception confuses the topline of the croup with the angle of the [...] "hip" [...] (the pelvis or ilium), leading some to assert that Arabians have a flat pelvis angle and cannot use their hindquarters properly. However, the croup is formed by the sacral vertebrae. The hip angle is determined by the attachment of the ilium to the spine, the structure and length of the femur, and other aspects of hindquarter anatomy, which is not correlated to the topline of the sacrum. Thus, the Arabian has conformation typical of other horse breeds built for speed and distance, such as the Thoroughbred, where the angle of the ilium is more oblique than that of the croup. Thus, the hip angle is not necessarily correlated to the topline of the croup. Horses bred to gallop need a good length of croup and good length of hip for proper attachment of muscles, and so unlike angle, length of hip and croup <b>do</b> <b>go</b> together as a rule.|$|E

500|$|Susan and Karl were {{childhood}} sweethearts {{who married}} in 1978, before they both graduated from university. Karl has cheated on Susan twice with Sarah Beaumont (Nicola Charles) and Izzy Hoyland (Natalie Bassingthwaighte) {{and the couple}} have broken up and divorced, but have later reunited and remarried. Woodburne has named the Karl, Susan and Izzy love triangle {{as one of her}} favourite storylines. Woodburne believes that Karl and Susan have a strong connection that is [...] "based upon such a good grounding". Karl and Susan are best friends who enjoy each other's company, share a deep connection and take joy in each other's quirks and ways. Woodburne described them as having a [...] "really solid foundation for a marriage" [...] and she has said that she does not want to see Susan and Karl's relationship break up again. Holy Soap have called Susan and Karl [...] "contenders for the friskiest couple on Ramsay Street". Following their [...] "passionate arguments", the couple enjoy making up together. They have a healthy attraction for each other. Fletcher says he and Woodburne find the scenes [...] "funny". Fletcher said [...] "Karl and Susan every now and again <b>do</b> <b>go</b> through a phase where they become slightly more amorous than in their tougher times and tougher storylines – suffice to say it's not bawdy, but I think the audience will enjoy the fun aspect". Karl and Susan have been caught in the nude together on three occasions; at the beach, in Lou Carpenter's (Tom Oliver) spa and when they went skinny-dipping in the bush. When asked what makes Karl and Susan popular with viewers, Woodburne said [...] "Because I think they're so flawed. There's two things: they make horrendous mistakes, both of them, but they both are coming from a place of well meaning. They're both wanting to try and {{do the right thing and}} be helpful, but so often they get it so terribly wrong, and I think we can all relate to that." ...|$|E
500|$|The double {{burden is}} usually {{view as a}} primary problem for single women or married women. However, it is often less {{recognized}} that men can and often <b>do</b> <b>go</b> through the same trials and hard times as a parent trying to balance work and the family. Within the book The Canadian Family in Crisis, Conway addresses this issue with an argument from Eichler. Eichler says, [...] "Social science fails to understand men" [...] by tending [...] "to downplay or ignore a potential conflict between work and home for men." [...] Married men can avoid {{the full impact of}} the double burden, but single fathers are totally incapable of avoiding the double burden of family and work. Though single fathers face the same number of problems that single mothers face, they have two advantages that play in their favor. Men usually have a higher income and have a shorter time of being single than women. However, until they are remarried or have a woman to help them out around the house, men still must deal with the sexual and emotional frustration as a woman does. They must deal with the balancing of work, childcare, and domestic responsibilities. Single fathers are usually doubtful about their ability be a parent, and they are challenged psychologically. [...] "The problems faced by the working single father are more than merely the logistical problems shared by all working parents. He has to change the way he feels about himself as man." [...] A man being a single parent and feelings the effects of the double burden can and will interfere with his career just as it does with a single mother that has a career. A study showed that five percent of single fathers were fired form their jobs due to the double burden and another eight percent quit because the double burden became too much of a burden for them to balance both work and the family. With that being said, single fathers feel the same, if not more, of the effect of the double burden as women do.|$|E
