25|$|Rupture {{propagation}} {{is generally}} modeled using a fracture mechanics approach, likening the rupture to a propagating mixed mode shear crack. The rupture velocity {{is a function}} of the <b>fracture</b> <b>energy</b> in the volume around the crack tip, increasing with decreasing <b>fracture</b> <b>energy.</b> The velocity of rupture propagation is orders of magnitude faster than the displacement velocity across the fault. Earthquake ruptures typically propagate at velocities that are in the range 70–90% of the S-wave velocity, and this is independent of earthquake size. A small subset of earthquake ruptures appear to have propagated at speeds greater than the S-wave velocity. These supershear earthquakes have all been observed during large strike-slip events. The unusually wide zone of coseismic damage caused by the 2001 Kunlun earthquake has been attributed to the effects of the sonic boom developed in such earthquakes. Some earthquake ruptures travel at unusually low velocities and are referred to as slow earthquakes. A particularly dangerous form of slow earthquake is the tsunami earthquake, observed where the relatively low felt intensities, caused by the slow propagation speed of some great earthquakes, fail to alert the population of the neighboring coast, as in the 1896 Sanriku earthquake.|$|E

The films were sputter deposited onto sapphire substrates to thicknesses ranging from 10 nm to 200 nm. Nanoindentation was used to measure mechanical properties and combined with stressed overlayers to trigger delamination and buckling. <b>Fracture</b> <b>energies</b> and interfacial <b>fracture</b> <b>energies</b> were then obtained from the buckles using mechanics-based models. The results showed that measured <b>fracture</b> <b>energies</b> decreased with decreasing film thickness to a lower limiting value near 1. 5 J/m 2 for film thicknesses up to 40 nm with a mode I normal component equal to 0. 6 J/m 2. The normal component equals the true work of adhesion and governs delamination. The shear component is composed of contributions from the test technique and crack tip plasticity which varied with film thickness...|$|R

40|$|Mode III (antiplane) shear <b>fracture</b> <b>energies</b> of {{concrete}} and mortar were measured {{on the basis of}} the size-effect law. The specimens were cylinders with a circumferential notch at midlength, subjected to pure torsion at zero axial force. The specimens were geometrically similar and their sizes varied as 1 : 2 : 4. It was observed that the mortar specimens behave closer to linear elastic fracture mechanics than the concrete specimens. The ratio of Mode III to Mode I (tensile) <b>fracture</b> <b>energies</b> was found to be about 3 for concrete and about 8 for mortar. The results indirectly indicate that a volume expansion of the sheared fracture process zone may be a significant mechanism causing transverse tensile stresses across the ligament.

40|$|Prediction of {{strength}} reduction for intercalated epoxy–clay nanocomposites is {{addressed in this}} work. For this purpose a 2 D multiscale finite element (FE) methodology is developed, which accounts for the hierarchical morphology of the nanocomposite and possible failure mechanisms detected experimentally such as gallery failure and interfacial debonding. At first the intercalated morphology is reconstructed using a random dispersion of clay tactoids within the epoxy matrix, where the gallery is modelled using the cohesive zone concept. Effects of different clay volume fractions, gallery <b>fracture</b> <b>energies,</b> tactoid aspect ratios and tactoid orientations on gallery failure and macroscopic nanocomposite behaviour are investigated systematically. Then, the mutual effect of gallery failure and external interfacial debonding is considered using the cohesive zone concept for galleries and matrix–tactoid interfaces. Effects of different combinations of gallery and interfacial <b>fracture</b> <b>energies</b> on the failure and macroscopic behaviour are investigated. Results indicate that gallery failure is a cause of nanocomposite strength reduction and, depending on the morphology, interfacial debonding {{is as important as}} gallery failure in affecting the nanocomposite strength...|$|R

SENT tests give information on the fracture stress, fracture displacements, and <b>fracture</b> <b>energies</b> of polycarbonate, and from these data the average crack speeds were calculated and the brittle-ductile transitions were determined. The fracture stress and the <b>fracture</b> <b>energies</b> of ductile <b>fracturing</b> samples increased with increasing test speed. The fracture surfaces were studied by scanning electron analysis, and sometimes a mixed mode fracture, part ductile and part brittle, could be seen. At high test speeds, a sharp brittle-ductile transition was observed, while at low test speeds the transition was more gradual, via a mixed mode region. This mixed mode region decreased in size with increasing test speed and was absent at the higher test speeds. The average crack speeds in the ductile region were directly related to the test speeds. The brittle-ductile transition temperature increased with the logarithmic of the test speed...|$|R
