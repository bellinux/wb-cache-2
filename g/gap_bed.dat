50|$|Browns Valley {{is a city}} in Traverse County, Minnesota, United States, {{adjacent}} to the South Dakota border. The population was 589 at the 2010 census. Browns Valley lies along the Little Minnesota River between {{the northern end of}} Big Stone Lake and the southern end of Lake Traverse, which is separated from the Little Minnesota River by a low and narrow continental divide that skirts the northern edge of town. The city, both lakes, and the river lie in the Traverse <b>Gap,</b> the <b>bed</b> of ancient, south-flowing Glacial River Warren, the outlet to Glacial Lake Agassiz which, when drained, became the valley of the north-flowing Red River of the North.|$|R

A detailed analysis of the forces shows that the heaps are formed and stabilized by the airflow through the <b>bed</b> while the <b>gap</b> between <b>bed</b> and vibrating bottom is growing, confirming the pressure gradient mechanism found experimentally by Thomas and Squires [Phys. Rev. Lett. 81, 574 (1998) ], with the addition that the airflow is partly generated by isobars running parallel {{to the surface of the}} granular bed. Importantly, the simulations also explain the heaping instability of the initially flat surface and the experimentally observed coarsening of a number of small heaps into a larger one...|$|R
40|$|The Cambrian Tamdroust and Bab n’Ali Volcanic Complexes {{represent}} two magmatic episodes {{developed in}} the latest Ediacaran–Cambrian Atlas Rift of Morocco. Their rifting pulses were accompanied by accumulation of volcanosedimentary edifices (dominated by effusive lava flows in the former and explosive acidic aprons in the latter) associated with active tilting and uplift. Sealing of their peneplaned horst-and-graben palaeotopographies led to the onset of distinct onlapping geometries and angular discordances capping eroded basements ranging from the Ediacaran Ouarzazate Supergroup to the Cambrian Asrir Formation. Previous interpretations of these discordances as pull-apart or compressive events are revised here and reinterpreted in an extensional (rifting) context associated with active volcanism. The record of erosive unconformities, stratigraphic <b>gaps,</b> condensed <b>beds</b> and onlapping patterns across the traditional “lower–middle Cambrian” (or Cambrian Series 2 – 3) transition of the Atlas Rift {{must be taken into}} consideration for global chronostratigraphic correlation based on their trilobite content...|$|R
50|$|Papyrus {{and reed}} rafts {{make up a}} large part of the Okavango's vegetation. During the flood season they float well above the sandy river bed with roots {{dangling}} free in the water. This <b>gap</b> between <b>bed</b> and roots is utilised as shelter by crocodiles.The plants of the Delta play an important role in providing cohesion for the sand. The banks or levees of a river normally have a high mud content and this combines with the sand in the river’s load to continuously build up the river banks. In the Delta, because of the clean waters of the Okavango, there is almost no mud and the river’s load consists almost entirely of sand. The plants capture the sand, acting as the glue and making up for the lack of mud and in the process creating further islands on which more plants can take root.|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} study on Ypresian clays–one {{of the potential}} deep and sedimentary clay formations in Belgium for the geological disposal of heat-emitting radioactive waste–has been undertaken to systematically study its thermal conductivity using different experimental techniques. As a first step, a new experimental setup with heat flux measurement has been used and careful pre-conditioning protocols have been followed to directly measure this thermal property. The aim of these pre-conditioning tests has been ensuring a very high degree of saturation and the closure of fissures / <b>gaps</b> along <b>bedding</b> planes before the thermal tests are run under low stress conditions. Thermal tests have shown to be particularly sensitive when the thermal conductivity is determined along a direction orthogonal to these bedding planes. The study is then complemented by using a constant volume heating cell, in which heating pulse tests {{have been carried out}} under fully saturated conditions that have been ensured with a high water back-pressure. Numerical models have been used to interpret this pulse test, to exploit all the information provided by temperature measurements and to back-analyse the thermal conductivity. Direct thermal conductivity data with the improved pre-conditioning protocol allowed obtaining results consistent with the values reported when using back-analysis in the constant volume cell. The article discusses the importance of restoring full saturation conditions, particularly on retrieval of deep sedimentary clays, which may undergo opening of fissures along bedding planes that may affect the correct determination of the thermal conductivity.

50|$|Washburn Lake is a 1,554 acre lake {{located about}} three miles {{northwest}} of Outing, Minnesota in Cass County, Minnesota, USA. The lake occupies three distinct basins. A public access is co-located at the Clinton Converse DNR Forestry Campground {{at the south end}} of the eastern basin. Based on 2009 data, development is considered moderate, with 17.2 homes/cabins per shoreline mile. The maximum depth is 111 feet and about 48% of the lake is 15 feet deep or less. Shallow water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel, although areas of rubble, boulders and muck are also present. The aquatic plant community is quite diverse and is critical to maintaining healthy fish populations. Emergent plants such as bulrush are common along much of the shoreline, however just as common are numerous <b>gaps</b> in these <b>beds</b> along shorelines with developed lots. The remaining emergent plants should be protected as they are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality, and providing essential spawning habitat for bass and panfish species. Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species.|$|R

Morse left to visit a {{relative}} at 8:48 a.m. and Andrew left for his morning walk sometime after 9 a.m. When he returned at around 10:30 a.m., his key failed to open the door, so he knocked for attention. Bridget went to unlock the door; finding it jammed, she uttered an expletive. She would later testify that she heard Lizzie laughing immediately after this; {{she did not see}} Lizzie, but she stated that the laughter was coming {{from the top of the}} stairs. This was later considered significant because Abby's body was visible through the <b>gap</b> between the <b>bed</b> and the floor when climbing the stairs, only becoming hidden by the bed upon reaching the top. Lizzie later denied being upstairs and testified that her father had asked her where Abby was, and she had replied that a messenger had delivered a summons to visit a sick friend. Lizzie stated that she then removed Andrew's boots and helped him into his slippers before he lay down on the sofa for a nap.(However, in his death photo, his shoes are clearly visible) Next she informed Bridget of a department-store sale and permitted her to go, but Bridget felt unwell and went to take a nap in her bedroom instead.|$|R
40|$|This {{experimental}} study {{was carried out}} to investigate the turbulent shallow wake generated by a vertical sharp-edged flat plate suspended in a shallow channel flow with a <b>gap</b> near the <b>bed.</b> The objective {{of this study is}} to understand the effect of the gap flow on the wake by studying two different gap heights between the channel bed and the bottom edge of the bluff body. These two cases will be compared to the no-gap case which is considered as a reference case. Themaximumflowvelocity was 0. 45 m/s and the Reynolds number based on the water depthwas 45, 000. Extensivemeasurements of the flowfield in the verticalmid-plane and in the horizontal near-bed, mid-depth, and near-surface planes weremade using particle image velocimetry. This paper is part of an extensive study to characterise the gap-flow effects and is primarily concerned with the mean velocity fields, while a companion paper discusses the turbulence characteristics. The size of the wake identified in the horizontal planes is found to vary in the three planes, where the gap flow enhances the entrainment in the near-wake region in the near-bed velocity field. The results also revealed that, if the gap flow is weak, it is engulfed by the recirculation zone formed just behind the bluff body whose axis is perpendicular to the vertical mid-plane. On the other hand, if the gap flow is relatively strong, it penetrates in the downstream direction and only a portion of it is diverted upward to feed the recirculation zone...|$|R
40|$|Although in {{the last}} years, several {{numerical}} models {{have been shown to}} be able to reproduce rip currents around discontinuous submerged barriers, only few simple methods of practical use are available for estimating main flow parameters, like the current intensity and the mean water levels, in terms of geometrical (barrier and gap dimensions) parameters and wave characteristics. The aim of this paper is to present a simplified model to be used for an easy estimate of these important rip currents parameters. The model, which is based on rough simplifications, considers the area between the shoreline and the barrier as a reservoir in which water is pumped by breaking short waves across the barrier and from which water flows out at the gap. Four equations (mass and momentum conservation across the barrier, free discharge at the gap and balance of water pumped towards the shore and freely flowing offshore) are used to derive one single model equation that can be solved for the wave set-up and subsequently used for rip current velocity calculation. Two free parameters appear in this equation which respectively account for energy losses at the <b>gap</b> (C-v) and <b>bed</b> friction (mu). The proposed model is validated against available laboratory experiments to show its ability in providing reasonable estimates of the desired parameters, that may be considered by engineers adequate at the preliminary design stage of submerged breakwaters and that can be used for evaluating hydrodynamics on barred beaches.

40|$|Acute lung injury (ALI), {{which is}} {{associated}} with a mortality of 30 – 40 %, is attributable to inflammation that develops rapidly across the lung’s vast vascular surface, involving an entire lung or even both lungs. No specific mechanism explains this extensive inflammatory spread, probably {{because of the lack of}} approaches for detecting signal conduction in lung capillaries. Here, we addressed this question by applying the photolytic uncaging approach to induce focal increases in Ca 2 + levels in targeted endothelial cells of alveolar capillaries. Uncaging caused Ca 2 + levels to increase not only in the targeted cell, but also in vascular locations up to 150 μm from the target site, indicating that Ca 2 + was conducted from the capillary to adjacent vessels. No such conduction was evident in mouse lungs lacking endothelial connexin 43 (Cx 43), or in rat lungs in which we pretreated vessels with peptide inhibitors of Cx 43. These findings provide the first direct evidence to our knowledge that interendothelial Ca 2 + conduction occurs in the lung capillary bed and that Cx 43 -containing gap junctions mediate the conduction. A proinflammatory effect was evident in that induction of increases in Ca 2 + levels in the capillary activated expression of the leukocyte adherence receptor P-selectin in venules. Further, peptide inhibitors of Cx 43 completely blocked thrombin-induced microvascular permeability increases. Together, our findings reveal a novel role for Cx 43 -mediated gap junctions, namely as conduits for the spread of proinflammatory signals in the lung capillary <b>bed.</b> <b>Gap</b> junctional mechanisms require further consideration in the understanding of ALI...|$|R

Extensivemeasurements of the flow field in the vertical mid-plane and in the horizontal near-bed, mid-depth, and near-surface planes weremade using particle-image velocimetry (PIV). This paper is the second part of an extensive study to characterise the gap-flow effects and is primarily focused on the mean and instantaneous turbulence quantities as well as coherent structures. The results revealed that the gap flow increased the transfer of the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) from the streamwise to the vertical component along the vertical mid-plane. In addition, there is a corresponding increase and spread of the transverse component in the transverse direction as the flow evolves in the downstream direction. The momentum exchange by the Reynolds stress is significantly weak in the vertical mid-plane particularly in the lower half of the water depth, but the gap flow enhanced the momentum exchange in the upper half of the water depth by up to 1 % of the freestream velocity squared. Furthermore, the intensity and bursting direction of the turbulence fluctuations in the far field are also affected by the gap flow when it is large. Furthermore, the proper orthogonal decomposition results revealed that the flow contains a large number of structures, and their interactions are responsible for deforming and/or tearing apart the structures, and transferring fluid throughout the velocity field...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Implementation {{of known}} {{effective}} interventions would necessitate {{the reduction of}} malaria burden by half by the year 2010. Identifying geographical disparities of coverage of these interventions at small area level is useful to inform where greatest scaling-up efforts should be concentrated. They also provide baseline data against which future scaling-up of interventions can be compared. However, population data are not always available at local level. This study applied spatial smoothing methods to generate maps at subdistrict level in Malawi to serve such purposes. Methods Data for the following responses from the 2000 Malawi Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) were aggregated at subdistrict level: (1) households possessing at least one bednet; (2) children under 5 years who slept under a bednet {{the night before the}} survey; (3) bednets retreated with insecticide within past 6 – 12 months preceding the survey; (4) children under 5 who had fever two weeks before the survey and received treatment within 24 hours from the onset of fever; and (5) women who received intermittent preventive treatment of malaria during their last pregnancy. Each response was geographically smoothed at subdistrict level by applying conditional autoregressive models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation techniques. Results The underlying geographical patterns of coverage of indicators were more clear in the smoothed maps than in the original unsmoothed maps, with relatively high coverage in urban areas than in rural areas for all indicators. The percentage of households possessing at least one bednet was 19 % (95 % credible interval (CI) : 16 – 21 %), with 9 % (95 % CI: 7 – 11 %) of children sleeping under a net, while 18 % (95 % CI: 16 – 19 %) of households had retreated their nets within past 12 months prior to the survey. The northern region and lakeshore areas had high bednet coverage, but low usage and re-treatment rates. Coverage rate of children who received antimalarial treatment within 24 hours after onset of fever was consistently low for most parts of the country, with mean coverage of 4. 8 % (95 % CI: 4. 5 – 5. 0 %). About 48 % (95 % CI: 47 – 50 %) of women received antimalarial prophylaxis during their pregnancy, with highest rates in the southern and northern areas. Conclusion The striking geographical patterns, for example between predominantly urban and rural areas, may reflect spatial differences in provider compliance or coverage, and can partly be explained by socio-economic and cultural differences. The wide <b>gap</b> between high <b>bed</b> net coverage and low retreatment rates may reflect variation in perceptions about malaria, which may be addressed by implementing information, education and communication campaigns or introducing long lasting insecticide nets. Our results demonstrate that DHS data, with appropriate methodology, can provide acceptable estimates at sub-national level for monitoring and evaluation of malaria control goals. </p...|$|R
40|$|Flood {{propagation}} over {{urban areas}} can cause {{an interaction between}} the free-surface flow and large underground pipe networks used for storm drainage and sewage, causing outflows and inflows at the bed. The associated waves may collide {{with each other and}} the surface waves. In this thesis the shallow water equations are used to model this type of wave interaction over dry or wet beds with bathymetry gradients and friction terms. The proposed shallow water scheme is solved based on finite volume high-resolution Godunov-type methods. The solver is well-balanced and can accurately balance the source terms and flux-gradients for the steady-state solutions. The solver also utilises a new type of Riemann wave speed to provide depth-positive results over nearly dry beds and dry states. Additionally a new type of source term is introduced in the continuity equation to model pipe inflow and outflow conditions at bed connections. For the standard one-dimensional shallow water equations the numerical results are validated with analytical solutions or other reference solutions provided in the literature. This includes the incipient Riemann problems for nearly dry and dry-states, steady flow over a hump in a rectangular channel and the wave propagation problem. Eventually, the generation of dry bed in the middle, over discontinuous topography is considered. Close agreement is achieved between the shallow water scheme and analytical or reference solutions for the above test cases. For the shallow water problems with influx/efflux source terms comparisons are made with STAR-CD, a commercial Navier-Stokes solver for general fluid flow prediction. The shallow water model is first used to simulate vertical flows through finite <b>gaps</b> in the <b>bed.</b> Next, the interaction of the vertical flows with a dam-break flow is considered for both dry and wet beds. An efflux number, En, is defined based on the vertical efflux velocity and the gap length. A parameter study is undertaken to investigate the effect of the one-dimensional approximation of the present model, for a range of non-dimensional efflux numbers. It is found that the shallow flow model gives sensible predictions at all times provided En 0. 5. Dam break flow over an underground connecting pipe is also considered for the one-dimensional efflux problems. To solve two-dimensional problems the shallow water scheme uses the dimensional-splitting method which solves each one-dimensional Riemann problem in the x- and y-directions separately. The cross-derivative terms for second-order accuracy are incorporated by solving another Riemann problem in the orthogonal direction. For two-dimensional problems first the dam-break problems are considered over wet and dry beds. Then, flood propagation over complex terrain is demonstrated. Next, efflux discharge is modelled in isolation over a dry bed and then with dam-break interaction, comparing with STAR-CD results. Again very good agreement is shown between the two-dimensional shallow water model and STAR-CD for the efflux numbers of En< 0. 5. For modelling the inundation problem over an underground pipe network the solver is coupled with the general underground pipe network solver to calculate the efflux discharge as the flood waves pass through the pipe network. For analysing the pipe network with unknown effluxes an additional set of equations is incorporated into the solution of a general pipe network solver. The shallow water solver coupled to an underground pipe network is then used to simulate dam-break interaction with pipe networks with 9 and 25 nodes to demonstrate the versatility of the method.

40|$|Repeat {{elements}} are important components of eukaryotic genomes. The dropping {{cost of the}} second and third generation sequencing technologies provides opportunities to study repeat elements of hundreds of species and thousands of individuals of one species. Based {{on the quality of the}} assembled genomes, generally there are two obstacles for studying repeat elements: (1) For species with high repetitive or complex genomes that do not have high quality genomes assembled, how do we construct de novo repeat elements? (2) For species with high quality genomes assembled, how to detect mobile elements insertions (one type of repeat elements) of different individuals of the species? It is known that most of the gaps on draft genomes are caused by repeat elements, thus a following-up question is: (3) With the understanding of repeats on genome, can we better close the gaps on draft genomes? To address the first problem that reference genomes are incomplete and often contain missing data in highly repetitive regions, we propose a method (called REPdenovo) to construct repeats directly from short sequencing reads. REPdenovo can construct various types of repeats that are highly repetitive and have low sequence divergence within copies. We show that REPdenovo is substantially better than existing methods both in terms of the number and the completeness of the repeat sequences that it recovers. The key advantage of REPdenovo is that it can reconstruct long repeats from short sequence reads. We apply the method to human data and discover a number of potentially new repeats sequences that have been missed by previous repeat annotations. Next we present an improved version of REPdenovo, which is able to reconstruct more divergent and lower frequency repeats from short sequencing reads. Comparing with the original REPdenovo, this improved approach uses more repeat-related k-mers. In addition, the new approach improves repeat assembly quality using a consensus-based k-mer processing method. We compare the performance of the new method with REPdenovo and RepARK on Human and Arabidopsis thaliana short sequencing data. The results show that the improved REPdenovo can assemble more complete repeats than REPdenovo (and also RepARK). We apply the improved REPdenovo on Hummingbird which has no known repeat library, and construct many repeat elements that are validated using PacBio long reads. Many of these repeats are likely to be true that are not in public repeat libraries. To answer the second question, we develop a novel method (called REPdenovo-MEI) for detecting mobile element insertions (MEIs) with given reference genome and alignments of different individuals. Different from all existing tools, REPdenovo-MEI does not rely on any repeats library and can call MEIs efficiently and accurately. Besides calling out insertion sites, REPdenovo-MEI has a local assembly step to construct the inserted copy and a classification based approach for calling genotypes. In addition, the third-generation sequencing technology generates long reads of thousands of bases long, which usually is long enough to contain the whole repeat elements in the reads, thus can help to construct the MEIs completely. Thus, besides short reads, REPdenovo-MEI can also work with long reads to infer the inserted copies. Results on both simulated and real data show that REPdenovo-MEI outperforms existing tools on both accuracy and the number of constructed high divergent MEIs. To solve the third problem of closing gaps on draft genomes, we propose a new method (called GAPPadder) that can sensitively close gaps for large and complex genomes. Different from existing approaches, GAPPadder collects more gap originated reads, especially repeat associated reads, and better utilize the information of different insert sizes of PE and MP reads. Finally, GAPPadder provides higher quality of local assembly with an extra contigs merging step. We show GAPPadder can close more gaps on one bacterial genome, Human chromosome 14 and Human whole genome. Besides closing gaps on draft genome assembled only from short sequence reads, GAPPadder can also be used to close gaps for draft genomes assembled with long reads. We show GAPPadder can close <b>gaps</b> on the <b>bed</b> bug genome and the Asian sea bass genome that are assembled partially and fully with long reads respectively. We also show GAPPadder is efficient in both time and memory usage...|$|R
