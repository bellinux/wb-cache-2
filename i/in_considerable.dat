5|$|Before the Industrial Revolution, {{the area}} {{contained}} the separate settlements of Runcorn, Higher Runcorn, Halton, Weston, Weston Point, and Norton. The administrative {{functions of the}} area were initially concentrated in Halton, which contained a castle and a court, while the parish church was in Runcorn. The population increase associated with industrialisation resulted <b>in</b> <b>considerable</b> expansion, so that the formerly discrete settlements were absorbed into the current urban area, much of which dates from the 19th and 20th centuries.|$|E
5|$|Days {{before the}} {{hurricane}} {{passed to the}} south of the state, high surf from Fico caused some beach flooding in the eastern portion of the island of Hawaii. High surf later resulted <b>in</b> <b>considerable</b> damage to roads and beachfront houses along the Big Island shores. The waves destroyed a home in Puna and wrecked a beach pavilion in Kau. The mayors of three Hawaiian cities issued a disaster declaration for their cities following the damage from Fico. In Maui, moderate waves led to road flooding near the water, though no damage occurred on the island. 60mph (95km/h) winds throughout Hawaii downed trees, resulting in some power outages. Damage from the hurricane totaled $200,000 (1978USD, $619,000 2006USD).|$|E
5|$|Due to flooding, troops {{evacuated}} {{dozens of}} communities along the Gulf coast. Many desert communities {{throughout the state}} were left without any telephone or electrical service; wood, tarpaper, and cardboard were all scattered. Dozens of scores of huts were destroyed. Many humans were swept into the gulf. Sixteen people died inside {{the remains of a}} building. Moreover, the Piojillo river overflowed its banks, killing many people and resulting <b>in</b> <b>considerable</b> damage. Elsewhere, destruction was reported in San Jose del Cabo, Cabo San Lucas, San Lucas, and Puntas Arena; Pichilinague also received moderate damage. However, there are no known reports of any casualties in all four of those places. Hurricane Liza was also one of six hurricane to directly impact Los Cabos.|$|E

The wetlands {{are important for}} wildlife, including some scarce breeding birds such as pied avocets, western marsh harriers, Eurasian bitterns and bearded reedlings. The location also attracts migrating birds including vagrant rarities. Ducks and geese winter along this coast <b>in</b> <b>considerable</b> numbers, and several nature reserves provide suitable conditions for water voles, natterjack toads and several scarce plants and invertebrates.|$|E
5|$|Honoré de Balzac {{was profoundly}} {{influenced}} by Scott (as well as Irish writer Maria Edgeworth), {{and decided to}} write novels using France's turbulent history as a literary backdrop {{in the same way}} they had used the history of Scotland and Ireland. Balzac had previously only published potboiler novels under a variety of pseudonyms, books designed to excite readers and sell copies. He had also engaged in a series of ill-fated speculative investments, which left him <b>in</b> <b>considerable</b> debt. Nevertheless, he believed in his skills as a writer, and awaited success around every corner.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{controlled}} access highways on Hamersley's southern and western boundaries physically isolate the suburb from its neighbours and limit southbound exits to just two, Erindale Road and Wanneroo Road. This results <b>in</b> <b>considerable</b> rush hour congestion on {{the stretch of}} Erindale Road between Eglinton Crescent and Reid Highway. In 2004, Main Roads Western Australia provided a grant of $48,000 to the City of Stirling under its Black Spot Programme to improve the traffic flow in this area.|$|E

5|$|In 1270 Roger Bigod, the 5th Earl, {{inherited}} the castle and undertook extensive renovations there whilst living <b>in</b> <b>considerable</b> luxury and style. Although still extremely wealthy, the Bigods were now having to borrow increasing sums from first the Jewish community at Bungay and then, after {{the expulsion of}} the Jews, Italian merchants; {{by the end of}} the century, Roger was heavily in debt to Edward I as well. As a result, Roger led the baronial opposition to Edward's request for additional taxes and support for his French wars. Edward responded by seizing Roger's lands and only releasing them on the condition that Roger granted them to the Crown after his death. Roger agreed and Framlingham Castle passed to the Crown on his death in 1306.|$|E
5|$|In 1890, the railway's {{arrival in}} Skagen not only {{led to the}} {{expansion}} of the village but also brought <b>in</b> <b>considerable</b> numbers of tourists. It was largely responsible for breaking up the regular summer meetings of the artists as they could no longer find suitable accommodation or venues for their meetings. However, some of them purchased homes in Skagen: P.S. Krøyer in 1894, Laurits Tuxen in 1901 and Holger Drachmann in 1903.|$|E

He also brought <b>in</b> <b>considerable</b> reinforcements in 1985, raising Libyan forces {{in the country to}} 7,000 troops, 300 tanks and 60 combat aircraft. While this build-up took place, significant elements of the GUNT passed over to the Habré government, as part of the latter's policy of accommodation.|$|E

Matilda's uncle, David I of Scotland, invaded England during 1137 in support of her claim. Although Miles de Beauchamp declared himself in support of Stephen, the king decided to retake Bedford Castle before marching north. Stephen formed an army to besiege Bedford Castle but Miles gained advance warning of the attack and took <b>in</b> <b>considerable</b> supplies, preparing for a long siege. Stephen was unable to storm the castle and left a force under the command of Hugh to starve it into submission whilst he marched north to tackle the Scots invasion.|$|E
5|$|Olive oil was a {{ubiquitous}} {{ingredient in}} Mediterranean cultures, but remained an expensive import {{in the north}} where oils of poppy, walnut, hazel and filbert were the most affordable alternatives. Butter and lard, especially after the terrible mortality during the Black Death made them less scarce, were used <b>in</b> <b>considerable</b> quantities in the northern and northwestern regions, especially in the Low Countries. Almost universal in middle and upper class cooking all over Europe was the almond, {{which was in the}} ubiquitous and highly versatile almond milk, which was used as a substitute in dishes that otherwise required eggs or milk, though the bitter variety of almonds came along much later.|$|E

5|$|The {{reserve is}} {{important}} for some scarce breeding birds, such as pied avocets on the islands, and western marsh harriers, Eurasian bitterns and bearded reedlings in the reeds. To encourage bitterns to breed, the reed beds have been improved to make them wetter, and the lagoon has been stocked with the common rudd. Typical wetland birds such as the water rail, reed warbler and sedge warbler also appear, and little egrets are common. The reserve has regularly attracted rarities, as its location {{is important for}} migrating birds. Ducks and geese winter at Titchwell <b>in</b> <b>considerable</b> numbers, and the reserve shelters the endangered European water vole.|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} work on Southampton's defences resulted <b>in</b> <b>considerable</b> improvements: by {{the late}} 14th century, the town was completely encircled by 2km (1.25 miles) of stone walls.

South Gate was built to protect the southern quays, with a wide archway, complete with parapets and machicolations. The building work proved very expensive, however, and despite the mayor and bailiffs enforcing contributions and assistance from the citizens, Parliament had to be asked several times in the 1370s to assist by remitting arrears of taxes owed by Southampton.|$|E
