5000|$|In most countries, the {{aircraft}} <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> or [...] "tail number"/"tail letters" [...] (also known as registration marks) {{are linked to}} the international radio <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> allocation table and follow a convention that aircraft radio stations (and, by extension, {{the aircraft}} itself) receive <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> consisting of five letters. For example, all British civil aircraft have a five-letter <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> beginning with the letter G. Canadian aircraft have a <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> beginning with C-F or C-G, such as C-FABC. Wing In Ground-effect vehicles (hovercraft) in Canada are eligible to receive C-Hxxx <b>call</b> <b>signs,</b> and ultralight aircraft receive C-Ixxx <b>call</b> <b>signs.</b> In days gone by, even American aircraft used five letter <b>call</b> <b>signs,</b> such as KH-ABC, but they were replaced prior to World War II by the current American system of civilian aircraft <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> (see below).|$|R
50|$|Amateur radio <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> are {{allocated}} to amateur radio operators around the world. The <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> {{are used to}} legally identify the station or operator, with some countries requiring the station <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> to always be used and others allowing the operator <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> instead.|$|R
50|$|Military <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> are <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> {{assigned}} {{as unique}} identifiers to military communications. In wartime, monitoring an adversary's communications {{can be a}} valuable form of intelligence. Consistent <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> can aid in this monitoring, so in wartime, military units often employ tactical <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> and sometimes change them at regular intervals. In peacetime, some military stations will use fixed <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> in the international series.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Indefinite</b> {{integrals}} are <b>called</b> <b>indefinite</b> {{because their}} solutions are only unique up to a constant. For example, when working {{over the field}} of real numbers ...|$|R

50|$|The {{radio station}} {{has had the}} WAZX <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> since 1993, when it changed from its long-time WYNX <b>call</b> <b>sign.</b> The WYNX <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> dates back to 1965 when the station {{switched}} to a Top 40 radio format from an MOR radio format and original <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> of WSMA.|$|R
50|$|<b>Call</b> <b>signs</b> in South America {{are used}} {{for a variety of}} purposes, {{including}} identifying radio and TV stations. Argentina and Brazil both have broadcast <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> systems. Some stations still broadcast their <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> a few times a day, but this practice is becoming very rare. <b>Call</b> <b>signs</b> were first assigned to South American countries in 1913, and the <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> blocks were expanded to include amateur radio in 1947.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{countries}} have specific conventions for classifying <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> by transmitter characteristics and location. The <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> format for {{radio and television}} <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> follows a number of conventions. All <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> begin with a prefix assigned by the International Telecommunications Union. For example, the United States has been assigned the following prefixes: [...] "AAA"-"ALZ", [...] "K", [...] "N", [...] "W". For a complete list, see international <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> allocations.|$|R
50|$|On February 4, 2016, WREJ swapped <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> {{with its}} sister station, {{assuming}} the WLEE <b>call</b> <b>sign.</b> The station changed its <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> to WONA on March 15, 2016.|$|R
50|$|The station {{went on the}} air as WSFC-FM on 1964-09-01; in 1968, {{the station}} changed its <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> to WSEK. On 2005-08-09, the station changed its <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> to WKEQ-FM, on 2005-08-18, the station changed its <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> to WKEQ, and on 2016-06-01 changed its <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> to the current WJQQ.|$|R
50|$|The United States Navy, United States Marine Corps, and United States Coast Guard use {{a mixture}} of {{tactical}} <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> and international <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> beginning with the letter N. For example, the carrier USS John F. Kennedy had the <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> NJFK for unclassified and navigation communications with other vessels, but uses tactical <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> that vary with its mission. In tactical situations, the Marine Corps utilizes <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> naming conventions similar to the Army's.|$|R
5000|$|Some aviators use {{the same}} <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> {{throughout}} their careers; in other cases an aviator might {{have a series of}} <b>call</b> <b>signs.</b> For example, U.S. Navy Lieutenant Kara Hultgreen was originally given the <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> [...] "Hulk" [...] because of her ability to bench-press 200 pounds. Later, after a television appearance in which she wore detectable makeup, she received the <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> [...] "Revlon", and a 1998 biography was entitled <b>Call</b> <b>Sign</b> Revlon.|$|R
50|$|The station's <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> {{used to be}} CBJ-FM until 1999. At that time, that <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> {{started to}} be used by its sister station CBJ as it moved from AM to the FM band; that station got the <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> CBJ-FM, and the old CBJ-FM thus had to change its own <b>call</b> <b>sign.</b>|$|R
50|$|The station {{held the}} <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> CFXL-FM until June 2008, when it adopted its current <b>call</b> <b>sign.</b> The former CIQX-FM in Calgary {{took over the}} CFXL-FM <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> a few days later.|$|R
5000|$|Formerly one of {{the rarest}} <b>call</b> <b>signs,</b> [...] "Concorde", was once used to {{identify}} British Airways' Concorde aircraft. The intent of this <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> was to raise the air traffic control operators' awareness of the unique performance of the aircraft and the special attention it required. The <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> was appended to British Airways' normal radio <b>call</b> <b>sign,</b> e.g. [...] "Speedbird-Concorde One". Air France, the only other airline to operate the Concorde commercially, {{did not use the}} [...] "Concorde" [...] <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> at all in normal service; its Concorde flights simply used the standard Airfrans <b>call</b> <b>sign.</b>|$|R
50|$|Four-letter <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> are the norm. Three-letter <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> {{are only}} {{permitted}} to CBC Radio stations or to commercial stations which {{already had a}} three-letter <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> before the current rules were adopted, and five-letter <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> exclusively identify CBC transmitters (which may be either rebroadcasters or Ici Radio-Canada Télé owned-and-operated stations outside of Quebec).|$|R
50|$|In Australia, {{broadcast}} <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> are optional, but are allocated by the Australian Communications and Media Authority and {{are unique}} for each broadcast station. Most European and Asian countries {{do not use}} <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> to identify broadcast stations, but Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, the Philippines and Taiwan do have <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> systems. Britain has no <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> in the American sense, but allow broadcast stations {{to choose their own}} trade mark <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> up to six words in length.|$|R
50|$|<b>Call</b> <b>signs</b> in India {{are unique}} {{identifiers}} for telecommunications and broadcasting in India. The Ministry of Communications and Information Technology regulates <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> nationally, and the International Telecommunication Union regulates <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> internationally.|$|R
50|$|WABE's <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> was WPBA-FM {{for much}} of April 1984, {{at the same time}} WETV's <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> was changed to WPBA. The radio station's <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> was changed back in May because of confusion.|$|R
25|$|An amateur {{operator}} with an Amateur Extra Class license {{can hold}} a call {{from any of the}} four <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> groups, either by keeping an existing <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> (indefinitely, since there is no requirement to change <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> upon license renewal), or by choosing a Group B, C or D <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> under the Vanity Licensing Program.|$|R

500|$|WWV {{is one of}} a {{small number}} of radio {{stations}} west of the Mississippi River with a <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> beginning with W. The W <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> stems from the station's early locations in D.C. and Maryland—the <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> was maintained when the federal government moved the station to Colorado—and the fact that WWV, being a government station, does not fall within the FCC's jurisdiction with respect to <b>call</b> <b>signs.</b> How and why the <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> WWV was assigned to the time signal station are not known. [...] However FCC regulations do dictate that time stations are to be issued <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> beginning with [...] "WWV".|$|R
50|$|In the British military, {{tactical}} voice communications use {{a system}} of <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> of the form letter-digit-digit. Within a standard infantry battalion these characters represent companies, platoons and sections respectively, so that 3 Section, 1 Platoon of F Company might be F13. In addition, a suffix following the initial <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> can denote a specific individual or grouping within the designated <b>call</b> <b>sign,</b> so F13C would be the Charlie fire team. Unused suffixes {{can be used for}} other <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> that do not fall into the standard <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> matrix, for example the unused 33A <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> is used to refer to the Company Sergeant Major.|$|R

50|$|Argentinian {{broadcast}} <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> {{consist of}} two (or, more recently, three) letters followed by multiple numbers. The second letter, {{as used in}} television <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> from the 1960s, traditionally indicated the region; LS <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> were given to stations in Buenos Aires, LT in the northeastern region, LU in the southern region, LV in the central region and LW in the northwestern region. (LR was used for some radio stations, especially in Buenos Aires; the earliest radio stations in the Argentine capital had <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> of LR plus one digit.) Most TV stations had <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> with higher two-digit numbers. The five main stations in the Buenos Aires area had <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> from LS 82 to LS 86, while stations in Rosario, Santa Fe had <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> LT 83 and LT 85.|$|R
5000|$|An amateur radio {{operator}} uses a <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> {{on the air}} to legally identify the operator and/or station.In some countries, the <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> assigned to the station must always be used, whereas in other countries, the <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> of either the operator or the station may be used.In certain jurisdictions, an operator may also select a [...] "vanity" [...] <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> although these must also conform to the issuing government's allocation and structure used for Amateur Radio <b>call</b> <b>signs.</b> Some jurisdictions require a fee to obtain such a vanity call sign; in others, such as the UK, a fee is not required and the vanity <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> may be selected when the license is applied for. The FCC in the U.S. discontinued its fee for vanity <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> applications in September 2015.|$|R
