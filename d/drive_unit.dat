25|$|In the 85D, {{the rear}} <b>drive</b> <b>unit</b> is {{replaced}} by a smaller one to save cost and weight, while the second motor of similar size is added to the front wheels. This results in an AWD car with comparable power and acceleration to the RWD version. Additionally, Tesla said the 85D has a 2% (5-mile) range increase and 11% increase in top speed over the 85. In the P85D, the high-power rear <b>drive</b> <b>unit</b> is retained, while a new front drive motor boosts the total power by about 50%. This results in a significant increase in acceleration and top speed. Deliveries of the P85D started in December 2014, with the 85D models starting in February 2015, and the 70D models starting in April 2015.|$|E

25|$|Audi's 'trademark' quattro {{permanent}} (or semi-permanent, {{dependent on}} gearbox type) four-wheel drive system {{was the only}} offering for the drivetrain. This normally distributes the engine torque as a 'default' 50:50 between front and rear axles, but can automatically dynamically apportion up to a bias of 20:80 to 80:20 front and rear. The automatic transmission utilizes a hydraulically controlled multi-plate clutch to apportion drive between front and rear axles, whereas the manual transmission variants utilize a Torsen type 1 Torque Sensing center differential. The rear axle final <b>drive</b> <b>unit</b> contains a Torsen type 1 Torque Sensing differential, instead of the more common hypoid open differential.|$|E
25|$|The {{production}} of the hydrogen engine was integrated into the regular engine production at the Dingolfing plant. It differs from the conventional petrol engine essentially only {{in regards to the}} intake tract with additional injection valves for the hydrogen. The hydrogen is stored cryogenically at a temperature of minus 253 degrees Celsius in a double-walled steel tank behind the rear seat back. The hydrogen tank holds 140 liters and allows an additional range of 350 kilometers. In addition, the 750hL has a fuel cell with a power of 5 kilowatts at 42 volts. This is not used as a <b>drive</b> <b>unit,</b> but as an auxiliary power unit (APU) for power supply to the electrical system.|$|E
25|$|Loudspeaker {{efficiency}} {{is defined as}} the sound power output divided by the electrical power input. Most loudspeakers are inefficient transducers; only about 1% of the electrical energy sent by an amplifier to a typical home loudspeaker is converted to acoustic energy. The remainder is converted to heat, mostly in the voice coil and magnet assembly. The main reason for this is the difficulty of achieving proper impedance matching between the acoustic impedance of the <b>drive</b> <b>unit</b> and the air it radiates into. (At low frequencies, improving this match is the main purpose of speaker enclosure designs). The efficiency of loudspeaker drivers varies with frequency as well. For instance, the output of a woofer driver decreases as the input frequency decreases because of the increasingly poor match between air and the driver.|$|E

25|$|Astronauts Wolf and Marshburn began EVA 2 at 15:27 UTC {{out of the}} Quest airlock. The EVA was to {{transfer}} the spare components brought by the shuttle from the ICC-VLD to External Stowage Platform-3. The spares were handled by Wolf riding the station's robotic arm to the P3 truss stowage platform where he and Marshburn attached them for long term storage. The purpose of the spares was to provide redundancy to the station in the period following the shuttle's retirement. The spares unloaded include a Ku-Band Space-to-Ground antenna, a pump module for the coolant system and a <b>drive</b> <b>unit</b> for the station's robotic arm's mobile transporter. A planned installation of a camera on the Japanese Experiment Facility was postponed to a future EVA for want of time. Meanwhile, the malfunctioning toilet was set right with the replacement of internal parts and cleared for normal use after tests.|$|E

2500|$|In 1936 six {{lightweight}} Wairarapa railcars, RM 4-9, {{were introduced}} between Palmerston North, Masterton and Wellington.

[...] Initially powered by [...] Leyland petrol engines, they were upgraded after several years to [...] diesel engines. [...] They had a single rear driving axle with 38½" [...] (978 mm) diameter wheels, necessitated by {{the need for the}} axle and final <b>drive</b> <b>unit</b> to have sufficient clearance above the Incline’s centre rail.

50|$|In {{addition}} to making speakers, {{a substantial part}} of KEF's activity was as an OEM supplier of loudspeaker systems, baffles and drivers. Cooke decided early on that huge potential benefits could be reaped from selling raw drivers to competitors, that more than outweighed the cannibalisation of their own market position. In a relatively short time, many major and renowned loudspeaker manufacturers came to source their <b>drive</b> <b>units</b> from KEF. Users included illustrious British brands such as IMF, Rogers, Celef, Monitor Audio, as well as manufacturers outside UK, including Sonus Faber and Wilson Audio. Linn Products of Scotland also elected to use KEF <b>drive</b> <b>units</b> in the Linn Isobarik., Linn Sara and Linn Kan speakers. The company's KEFKITs also provided many hi-fi hobbyists with means to apply their woodworking skills into making their own speakers. At its peak, production of <b>drive</b> <b>units</b> reached 10,000 units per week. In 1979, Queen Elizabeth II awarded Cooke an OBE.|$|R
