25|$|Rodent prey {{is usually}} {{dominated}} by locally superabundant species, like the delicate vesper mouse (Calomys tener) in southern Brazil. Among squamates and amphibians, small lizards like the tropical <b>house</b> <b>gecko</b> (Hemidactylus mabouia), and {{frogs and toads}} predominate. Generally, most vertebrate prey is in the weight class of several grams per individual. The largest prey are usually birds, such as eared doves (Zenaida auriculata) which may weigh {{almost as much as}} a burrowing owl.|$|E
25|$|Other {{reptiles}} in {{the region}} include lizards and turtles. Lizards are highly represented {{in the region}}, the most distinctive denizen being the Gila monster, native only to the American Southwest {{and the state of}} Sonora in Mexico. Other lizards include: Sonoran collared lizard (Crotaphytus nebrius); several types of geckos, including western banded gecko (Coleonyx variegatus), the common <b>house</b> <b>gecko</b> (Hemidactylus frenatus), and the Mediterranean <b>house</b> <b>gecko</b> (Hemidactylus turcicus), the last two species being non-native to the region but have been introduced; the desert iguana (Dipsosaurus dorsalis); the chuckwalla (Sauromalus ater); the greater earless lizard (Cophosaurus texanus scitulus); several sub-species of horned lizards (Phrynosoma); numerous species of spiny lizards (Sceloporus); Gilbert's skink (Plestiodon gilberti); the western skink (Plestiodon skiltonianus); Trans-Pecos striped whiptail (Aspidoscelis inornata heptagrammus); and the Arizona night lizard (Xantusia arizonae). Turtles are less numerous than their other reptilian counterparts, but several are found in the region, including: the western painted turtle (Chrysemys picta bellii); the Rio Grande cooter (Pseudemys gorzugi); the desert box turtle (Terrapene ornata luteola); the Big Bend slider (Trachemys gaigeae gaigeae); the Sonora mud turtle (Kinosternon sonoriense); and the desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii).|$|E
25|$|Currently, three lizards and one toad {{are known}} to inhabit Diego Garcia, and {{possibly}} one snake. All {{are believed to have}} been introduced by human activity. The <b>house</b> <b>gecko</b> (Hemidactylus frenatus), the mourning gecko (Lepidodactylus lugubris), the garden lizard (an agamid) (Calotes versicolor), and the cane toad (Bufo marinus). A viable population of a type of blind snake from the family Typhlopidae may be present, probably the brahminy blind snake (Ramphotyphlops braminus). This snake feeds on the larvae, eggs, and pupae of ants and termites, and {{is about the size of}} a large earthworm.|$|E

500|$|Reptiles have a {{particular}} affinity for the South Florida ecosystem. Virtually all lizards appearing in the Everglades have been introduced, such as the brown anole (Anolis sagrei) and the tropical <b>house</b> <b>gecko</b> (Hemidactylus mabouia). The herbivorous green iguana (Iguana iguana) can reproduce rapidly in wilderness habitats. [...] However, [...] the reptile that has earned media attention for its size and potential to harm children and domestic pets is the Burmese python (Python bivittatus), which has spread quickly throughout the area. The python can grow up to [...] long and competes with alligators for {{the top of the}} food chain.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{reptiles}} of the squamatan order (lizards and snakes) reproduce sexually, but parthenogenesis {{has been}} observed to occur naturally in certain species of whiptails, some geckos, rock lizards,Komodo dragons and snakes. Some of these like the mourning gecko Lepidodactylus lugubris, Indo-Pacific <b>house</b> <b>gecko</b> Hemidactylus garnotii, the hybrid whiptails Cnemidophorus, Caucasian rock lizards Darevskia, and the brahminy blindsnake, Indotyphlops braminus are unisexual and obligately parthenogenetic.

40|$|The {{ability to}} detect and avoid {{potential}} predators can enhance fitness, but also has costs, and thus many animals respond to potential predators either in a general (avoid all potential predators) or threat-sensitive (selectively avoid dangerous predators) manner. We used 2 -choice trials to investigate strategies used by globally invasive <b>house</b> <b>geckos</b> (Hemidactylus frenatus) and native Australian <b>house</b> <b>geckos</b> (Gehyra dubia) to avoid chemical cues from potential snake predators (Acanthophis antarcticus, Antaresia maculosa, Boiga irregularis, and Pseudechis colletti). Invasive geckos {{did not respond to}} a novel chemical cue (perfume), but significantly avoided shelters scented by all 4 predatory snake species, and did not discriminate among snake species that occurred within or outside their current geographic range. Thus, the invasive gecko showed generalized predator avoidance. In contrast, native geckos avoided shelters scented with perfume but did not avoid shelters scented by any of the 4 predatory snake species. We interpret the lack of response by native geckos as threat sensitive, suggesting that they may require additional cues beyond scent alone (e. g., visual cues) to judge the situation as threatening. Generalized responses may be costly for native species living in native habitats filled with predators but may facilitate the rapid establishment of invasive species in novel (especially urban) environments, where general responses to predators may have relatively low costs and enhance survival...|$|R

40|$|Proteases from Russell's viper venom (RVV) {{induce a}} variety of toxic effects in victim. Therefore, four new RVV {{protease}} isoenzymes of molecular mass 32901. 044 Da, 333631. 179 Da, 333571. 472 Da, and 34594. 776 Da, were characterized in this study. The first 10 N-terminal residues of these serine protease isoenzymes showed significant sequence homology with N-terminal sequences of snake venom thrombin-like and factor V-activating serine proteases, which was reconfirmed by peptide mass fingerprinting analysis. These proteases {{were found to be}} different from previously reported factor V activators isolated from snake venoms. These proteases showed significantly different fibrinogenolytic, BAEE-esterase and plasma clotting activities but no fibrinolytic, TAME-esterase or amidolytic activity against the chromogenic substrate for trypsin, thrombin, plasmin and factor Xa. Their Km and Vmax values towards fibrinogen were determined in the range of 6. 6 to 10. 5 µM and 111. 0 to 125. 5 units/mg protein, respectively. On the basis of fibrinogen degradation pattern, they may be classified as A/B serine proteases isolated from snake venom. These proteases contain ∼ 42 % to 44 % of N-linked carbohydrates by mass whereas partially deglycosylated enzymes showed significantly less catalytic activity as compared to native enzymes. In vitro these protease isoenzymes induce blood coagulation through factor V activation, whereas in vivo they provoke dose-dependent defibrinogenation and anticoagulant activity in the mouse model.

50|$|Admiral W.J.L. Wharton of the British navy {{landed in}} Aldabra in 1878 to conduct hydro-graphic {{surveys of the}} islands.In 1888, first {{settlement}} was established after the Concession was granted by the Seychelles authorities. The small settlement was established on Picard Island facing west near the beach. The intention was to exploit and export the natural resources of the islands. The villagers built a chapel, {{in the middle of}} the badamier trees, with timber and steel which was an essential addition to the plantation houses and office buildings. As Aldabra had no water resources, large rectangular-shaped water storage structures were built adjoining each of the houses. A two-roomed jail was also built in the village, a remnant of which is still seen at Aldabra. The exploitation of tortoises for commercial purposes at that time is borne out by the remnants of a crushing mill at Picard Island, which was used to crush bones of tortoises, which were also brought in from other islands in the atoll. Efforts made to grow plantation crops of coconuts, cotton, and sisal failed due to inadequate water sources on the atoll; relics of these plantations are still found on some of the islands.In the late 19th century Goats were introduced as a food source for the villagers (about 200) living there.
