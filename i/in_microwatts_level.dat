25|$|The {{filaments}} require {{constant and}} often considerable power, even when amplifying signals at the <b>microwatt</b> <b>level.</b> Power is also dissipated when the electrons from the cathode slam into the anode (plate) and heat it; this can occur {{even in an}} idle amplifier due to quiescent currents necessary to ensure linearity and low distortion. In a power amplifier, this heating can be considerable and can destroy the tube if driven beyond its safe limits. Since the tube contains a vacuum, the anodes in most small and medium power tubes are cooled by radiation through the glass envelope. In some special high power applications, the anode forms part of the vacuum envelope to conduct heat to an external heat sink, usually cooled by a blower, or water-jacket.|$|R

40|$|The {{terahertz}} (THz) {{region of}} the electromagnetic spectrum is attracting interest for a broad range of applications ranging from diagnosing electron beams to biological imaging. Most sources of short pulse THz radiation utilize excitation of biased semiconductors or electro-optic crystals by high peak power lasers.

It will be a core technology for autonomous wireless networks, which is the essential component of the long-lived ubiquitous computing world. There are different ways to achieve the energy harvesting goal, {{and each of them}} has its own pros and cons. In this thesis, we focused on monolithic integration of an energy harvester on top of CMOS chips by CMOS compati-ble post-processing technologies, and two approaches have been studied. Chapter 2 describes the first approach which is an integrated electromag-netic energy harvester, which aims to scavenging kinetic energy of the mechanical vibrations in the environment. The numerical simulations show that our EM energy harvester design can offer a power output at <b>microwatts</b> <b>level,</b> which is consistent with experimental results from other groups. However due to the absence of some required instruments and the frequency match challenge (page 28), the experimental realization was not carried out. Chapter 3 to 5 describe the second approach which is integrated solar cells on top of CMOS chips without changing either the standard CMOS process-ing or the conventional solar cell technology. The integrated solar cells will harvest energy from light and transfer to the underneath CMOS circuits.

The project was initiated in the summer of 1987 and has involved several dozen undergraduate students. SURFSAT is designed to radiate at either the milliwatt or <b>microwatt</b> <b>level</b> <b>in</b> four bands: Sband (2. 29 GHz), X-band (8. 45 GHz), Ku-band (15. 33 GHz) and Ka-band (32 GHz). The signals will be received by a new 34 -meter DSN research antenna at Goldstone, California. Performance of the new Ku-band link will be analyzed and compared to the performance of the more standard X-band link. The S-band and Ku-band signals will be used to support DSN spacecraft acquisition tests and training. Other experiment objectives have also been identified, including spacecraft position and orbit determination demonstrations utilizing ground-based connected-element interferometers.

25|$|As {{a crystal}} radio has no power supply, the sound power {{produced}} by the earphone comes solely from the transmitter of the radio station being received, via the radio waves captured by the antenna. The power available to a receiving antenna decreases with the square of its distance from the radio transmitter. Even for a powerful commercial broadcasting station, if {{it is more than}} {{a few miles from the}} receiver the power received by the antenna is very small, typically measured <b>in</b> <b>microwatts</b> or nanowatts. <b>In</b> modern crystal sets, signals as weak as 50 picowatts at the antenna can be heard. Crystal radios can receive such weak signals without using amplification only due to the great sensitivity of human hearing, which can detect sounds with an intensity of only 10−16 W/cm2. Therefore, crystal receivers have to be designed to convert the energy from the radio waves into sound waves as efficiently as possible. Even so, they are usually only able to receive stations within distances of about 25 miles for AM broadcast stations, although the radiotelegraphy signals used during the wireless telegraphy era could be received at hundreds of miles, and crystal receivers were even used for transoceanic communication during that period.|$|R

These are ideal for remote-sensing applications or where long battery life is important.

40|$|Ultra-Low-Power {{electronics}} {{can perform}} useful functions with power levels {{as low as}} 170 nW. This makes them amenable to powering from ambient sources such as vibration. In this case, they can become autonomous. Motivated by this application, this thesis provides the necessary tools to analyze, design and fabricate MEMS devices capable of electrostatic vibration-to-electric energy conversion at the <b>microwatt</b> <b>level.</b> The fundamental means of en- ergy conversion is a variable capacitor that is excited through a generating energy conversion cycle with every vibration cycle of the converter. This thesis presents a road map on how to design MEMS electrostatic vibration-to- electric energy converters. A proposed converter is designed to illustrate the design process, {{and is based on}} vibration levels typical of rotating machinery, which are around 2 % of the acceleration of gravity from 1 - 5 kHz. The converter consists of a square centimeter with a 195 mg proof mass which travels ± 200 pm. This mass and travel can couple to a sinusoidal acceleration source of 0. 02 g at 2. 5 kHz, typical of rotating machinery, so as to capture 24 nJ per cycle. This moving proof mass is designed to provide a variable capacitor ranging from 1 pF to 80 pF. Adding a capacitor of 88 pF in parallel with this device will result in a capacitance change from 168 pF to 89 pF that is required to extract 24 nJ using a charge-constrained cycle. (cont.) This device can be attached to power electronics that implement a charge-constrained cycle and deliver 0. 5 nJ back to the reservoir for a total power output of 1. 3 [mu]/W at 2. 5 kHz. The efficiency of the electrical conversion is 2 %. Including packaging, the power per volume would be 0. 87 [mu]W/cm 3 and the power per mass would be 1. 3 [mu]W/g. System improvements are also identified such as those that address the principal sources of loss. For example, decreasing the output capacitance of the MOSFET switches from 10 pF to 1 pF, while keeping the energy conversion cycle the same, results in an energy output of 13 nJ out of 24 nJ, for an efficiency of 54 % and a power output of 33 [mu]W. This argues strongly for the use of integrated circuits in which the output capacitance of the MOSFET switches can be reduced for this application. José Oscar Mur Miranda. Thesis (Ph. D.)

The key challenge of long-term activity monitoring is the energy constraints of wearable hardware. Low power consumption is a key goal of all wireless sensing systems, primarily due to the associated costs of replacing or recharging batteries. To make matters worse, in the context of our application of interest, the users of the system are either elderly or suffering from medical conditions, making the option of user-based system maintenance unrealistic. For these reasons, our aim is an ultra low-power system with a long-term average power consumption of the order of tens of <b>microwatt.</b> Such <b>levels</b> of power consumption correspond to a long battery lifetime, hence, a system that can support maintenance-free residential monitoring for several months. Although only battery-powered solutions are considered in this paper, {{it should be noted that}} such low levels of power consumption also facilitate the realisation of completely maintenance-free energy harvesting sensing systems [7], where sensors are powered by the—typically very limited—energy that is available in the surrounding environment. In our proposed platform, the energy efficiency of the wearable device is also enhanced by exploiting the asymmetry of the network resources. Instead of energy-consuming retransmissions, reliable communication is achieved through incorporating energy-efficient packet loss mitigation techniques that are primarily supported by the mains-powered infrastructure.|$|R
