5|$|<b>García</b> <b>Márquez</b> {{was one of}} the {{original}} founders of QAP, a newscast that aired between 1992 and 1997. He was attracted to the project by the promise of editorial and journalistic independence.|$|E
5|$|Though {{his passion}} was writing, he {{continued}} with law in 1948 to please his father. After the so-called «Bogotazo» in 1948, some bloody disturbances that happened April 9 {{caused by the}} assassination of popular leader Jorge Eliécer Gaitán, the university closed indefinitely and his pension was burned. <b>García</b> <b>Márquez</b> transferred to the Universidad de Cartagena and began working as a reporter of El Universal.

5|$|After writing One Hundred Years of Solitude <b>García</b> <b>Márquez</b> {{returned}} to Europe, this time bringing along his family, {{to live in}} Barcelona, Spain, for seven years. The international recognition <b>García</b> <b>Márquez</b> earned {{with the publication of}} the novel led to his ability to act as a facilitator in several negotiations between the Colombian government and the guerrillas, including the former 19th of April Movement (M-19), and the current FARC and ELN organizations. The popularity of his writing also led to friendships with powerful leaders, including one with former Cuban president Fidel Castro, which has been analyzed in Gabo and Fidel: Portrait of a Friendship. It was during this time that he was punched in the face by Mario Vargas Llosa in what became one of the largest feuds in modern literature. In an interview with Claudia Dreifus in 1982 <b>García</b> <b>Márquez</b> notes his relationship with Castro is mostly based on literature: “Ours is an intellectual friendship. It may not be widely known that Fidel is a very cultured man. When we’re together, we talk a great deal about literature.” This relationship was criticized by Cuban exile writer Reinaldo Arenas, in his 1992 memoir Antes de que Anochezca (Before Night Falls).|$|E

5|$|After {{arriving}} at Sucre, {{it was decided}} that <b>García</b> <b>Márquez</b> should start his formal education and he was sent to an internship in Barranquilla, a port on the mouth of the Río Magdalena.

5|$|His novel Of Love and Other Demons {{was adapted}} and {{directed}} by a Costa Rican filmmaker, Hilda Hidalgo, who {{is a graduate of}} the Film Institute at Havana where <b>García</b> <b>Márquez</b> would frequently impart screenplay workshops.

40|$|Far {{from being}} an {{occasional}} occupation, <b>García</b> <b>Márquez's</b> film work forms an intrinsic part of his overall aesthetic and literary poetics. The book's primary aim is to present a detailed study of <b>García</b> <b>Márquez's</b> wide-ranging filmography, which has never received a comprehensive, systematic analysis. Rocco argues {{that it should be}} recognised {{as an integral part of}} the author's narrative output, and brought into the mainstream of studies concerning his literary activity. The first part of the book reconstructs the trajectory of <b>García</b> <b>Márquez's</b> career in cinema and his connections with the world of film. The second part looks at all his screenplays on which actual films have been based. These are examined chronologically, but also analysed according to thematic and aesthetic concerns and placed in relation to the novels and short stories with which they are 'twinned'...|$|R
