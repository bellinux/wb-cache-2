25|$|In May 2011, Airbnb {{acquired}} a German competitor, Accoleo. This takeover, {{as well as}} other similar acquisitions, launched the first international Airbnb office, in Hamburg. In October 2011, Airbnb established its second international office in London. Due to the growth of international users, in early 2012, Airbnb opened offices in Paris, Milan, Barcelona, Copenhagen, Moscow, and São Paulo. These openings were in addition to existing offices in San Francisco, London, Hamburg, and Berlin. Airbnb announced in September 2013 that its European headquarters would be located in Dublin. Prior to the 2012 Summer Olympics, Airbnb acquired London-based rival CrashPadder, subsequently adding 6,000 international listings to its <b>existing</b> <b>inventory.</b> This acquisition made Airbnb the largest lodging website in the United Kingdom.|$|E
40|$|This {{pilot study}} {{introduces}} the comprehensive race socialization inventory (CRSI), an amalgam and extension of <b>existing</b> <b>inventories</b> that systemati-cally captures the race socialization process within Black families. Using survey data collected in 2000 and 2001 from {{a convenience sample}} of Black adolescents (n = 18) and a random sample of Black college students (n = 225), the authors compare data yielded from the CRSI with data yielded from <b>existing</b> <b>inventories</b> of race socialization. The authors find that CRSI components such as (a) onset and recency, (b) the most useful message, (c) multiple sources, (d) anticipatory socialization messages, and (e) socializ-ing behaviors are absent from <b>existing</b> race socialization <b>inventories.</b> Because the CRSI captures these critical components of the race socializa-tion process, the authors argue that it is an improvement over <b>existing</b> <b>inventories.</b> The authors report measures of central tendency and disper-sion to demonstrate the utility of the CRSI and also discuss its reliability and validity...|$|R

30|$|These <b>existing</b> <b>inventories</b> like TROFLEI, TICI, and NCEI {{have proved}} to be {{effective}} tools for assessing computerized classroom. Been looked as the advanced stage of computerized classroom (Huang et al. 2012), these inventories could be used to assess smart classroom. However, with integration of emerged information technologies, several measurements such as flexibility use of smart classrooms, adaptive learning support, and offering of authentic learning experience are more significant in the smart classroom environment. They have not been considered in the <b>existing</b> <b>inventories.</b> The exclusion of such distinct features will obscure the characteristics of smart classroom to be fully reflected. The aim of the study is to develop a comprehensive instrument focusing on all the characteristics of smart classroom, as well as addressing the limitation of previous inventories.|$|R
25|$|Currently, Poland's {{military}} {{is going through}} a significant modernization phase, which will be completed in 2022. The government plans to spend up to 130 billion złoty (US $34 billion), however the final total may reach 235 billion złoty (US $62 billion) to replace dated equipment and purchase new weapons systems. Under the program, the military plans to purchase new tracked armoured personnel carriers, self-propelled howitzers, utility and attack helicopters, a mid-range surface-to-air missile system, attack submarines, minehunters, and coastal anti-ship missiles. Also, the army plans to modernize its <b>existing</b> <b>inventory</b> of main battle tanks, and update its stock of small arms. Poland is currently spending 2% of its GDP on defense, and is expected to grow to 2.5% of GDP by 2030. In May 2017 the Ministry of National Defence has assured that the Polish army will be increased to 250,000 active personnel.|$|E
25|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Korean War in 1950, the USAF found itself in dire need of an all-weather interdiction aircraft. The <b>existing</b> <b>inventory</b> of piston-engined Douglas B-26 Invaders had been dispatched in this capacity at the very start of the conflict; however, within only a few months within the theatre, the B-26 had suffered a very high rate of attrition and successes with the type were typically limited. In response to these needs, the USAF requested the British government to provide a private demonstration of the English Electric Canberra, a newly developed jet-powered bomber. On 17 August 1950, the Canberra demonstration was performed at RAF Burtonwood, Warrington, Cheshire, England; during the following month, a team of US test pilots and engineers visited English Electric's Warton factory to perform a series of flight tests and a detailed technical assessment of the aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{throughout}} {{the early and}} mid 1950s, the Royal Air Force (RAF) had developed an intense desire to advance {{the performance of their}} aircraft; in particular, the service sought new fighter aircraft that would be capable of routinely flying at very high speeds and high altitudes as a long term replacement for its <b>existing</b> <b>inventory</b> of roughly 700 first-generation jet fighters. At the time, there was a perception that Britain was trailing behind in supersonic aircraft design, and there was pressure to correct this. Events such as the Korean War and rapid advances in the fields of supersonic aerodynamics, structures and aero engines by the British aircraft industry had the effect of increasing demand and the potential capabilities of new fighters. In addition to developing improved versions of existing and emerging fighters such as the Hawker Hunter and Gloster Javelin, there was an appetite for even more promising entirely new aircraft.|$|E
30|$|This study {{started to}} develop the smart {{classroom}} inventory by initially gathering salient scales from <b>existing</b> <b>inventories.</b> The smart classroom is the technology-rich classroom, so the study chose the Technology-Rich Outcomes-Focused Learning Environment Inventory (TROFLEI), and Technology Integrated Classroom Inventory (TICI) {{to develop the}} smart classroom inventory. Considering the smart classroom has much change in spatial design and technology equipment, the study also chose Computerized Classroom Ergonomic Inventory (CCEI) to construct the smart classroom inventory.|$|R

Two previously <b>existing</b> <b>inventories</b> were used: Robertson and Hoffman's (2000) Cultural Values Scale, derived from the work of Hofstede (1980, 1991 a, 1998), and Honey and Mumford's (1992) Learning Style Questionnaire. One of the major findings of this study was that Student-Driven learning is characterised by students having high Masculinity, Confucian and Uncertainty Avoidance value ratings...|$|R

2500|$|Since 2002, half dollars {{have been}} minted only for collectors, due to large Federal Reserve and {{government}} inventories on hand of pre-2001 pieces; this is mostly {{due to lack}} of demand and large quantity returns from casino slot machines that now operate [...] "coinless". If and when the reserve supply runs low, the mint will again fill orders for circulation half dollars. It took about 18 years (1981–1999) for the large inventory stockpile of a similar low-demand circulation coin, the $1 coin, to reach reserve levels low enough to again produce circulation pieces. Modern-date half dollars can be purchased in proof sets, mint sets, rolls, and bags from the U.S. Mint, and <b>existing</b> <b>inventory</b> circulation pieces can be ordered through most U.S. banks. All collector issues since 2001 have had much lower mintages than in previous years. Although intended only for collectors, these post-2001 half dollars sometimes find their way into circulation.|$|E
2500|$|The Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) {{became a}} {{significant}} customer of the Sea Fury, {{and many of}} its aircraft were diverted from existing Royal Navy contracts. On 23 June 1948, the first aircraft was accepted at RCAF Rockcliffe. The type was quickly put to use replacing Canada's <b>existing</b> <b>inventory</b> of Seafires, taking on the primary role of fleet air defence operating from the aircraft carrier [...] Two Canadian squadrons operated the Sea Fury, Nos. 803 and 883 Squadrons, which were later renumbered as 870 and 871. Pilot training on the Sea Fury was normally conducted at the RCN's HMCS Shearwater land base. Landing difficulties with the Sea Fury were experienced following the RCN's decision to convert to the US Navy's deck landing procedures, which were prone to overstressing and damaging the airframes as the Sea Fury had been designed for a tail-down landing attitude. The Sea Fury would be operated between 1948 and 1956 by the RCN, at which point they were replaced by the jet-powered McDonnell F2H Banshee. The aircraft themselves were put into storage, and some were subsequently purchased by civilians.|$|E
