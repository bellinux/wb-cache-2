Mamma and I are not great friends, but always alive to her virtues, I am anxious to defend her from a charge so foreign to her character." ...|$|E
500|$|Walpole {{is quite}} taken by this {{tradition}} and mentions it in several letters to his friends. [...] In {{a letter to}} the Countess of Ailesbury (Lady Caroline Campbell, daughter of John Campbell, 4th Duke of Argyll and widow of Charles Bruce, 4th Earl of Elgin and 3rd Earl of Ailesbury but by this stage married to Hon. H. S. Conway), Walpole with tongue firmly in cheek berates her for not having come to Whichnoure to claim the flitch: [...] "Are you not ashamed, Madam, never to have put in your claim? It is above a year and a day that you have been married, and I never once heard <b>either</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> mention a journey to Whichnoure." [...] Describing the location and explaining why the flitch no longer gets claimed, he writes [...] "... it is a little paradise, and the more like an antique one, as, by all I have said, the married couples seem to be driven out of it." [...] Walpole concludes, [...] "If you love a prospect, or bacon, you will certainly come hither." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Mildred, come hither," [...] resumed the brutalized parent. [...] "You are my daughter, and {{whatever}} others have promised at the altar, and forgotten, a law <b>of</b> nature teaches <b>you</b> to obey me. You have two admirers, <b>either</b> <b>of</b> whom <b>you</b> {{ought to be}} glad to secure, {{though there is a}} great preference between them--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Plain! (replied He) My dear Susan, you cannot {{really think}} so! Why what single Feature {{in the face}} <b>of</b> <b>either</b> <b>of</b> them, can <b>you</b> {{possibly}} find fault with?" ...|$|R
60|$|LADY CHESHIRE. If {{you were}} a lady there'd be no trouble before <b>either</b> <b>of</b> <b>you.</b> You'll make him hate you.|$|E
60|$|Had {{you really}} paid court to Olga's heart I {{am afraid that}} {{there would have been}} no hope for <b>either</b> <b>of</b> <b>you.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Can <b>either</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> tell me WHY {{you look}} in this uncharitable light, on so many of your fellow-creatures? It cannot be Christianity, for such are not its teachings or feelings. Nor is <b>either</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> very {{remarkable}} for his observance {{of the laws of}} God, as they have been revealed to Christian people. MY heart yearns toward these Injins, who are infidels, instead of entertaining any of the feelings that the corporal has just expressed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Serious! a quoi bon? I am serious--serious in my {{surprise}} that, when you might have had <b>either</b> <b>of</b> these women, <b>you</b> should have preferred that hideous wife of yours." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't suppose I'm {{much worse}} than other men;--or for the matter of that, worse than a great many women <b>either.</b> <b>You</b> all <b>of</b> <b>you</b> here put me up to marry her.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “It {{looks as}} if <b>you</b> {{suspected}} me <b>of</b> leading him astray. Now, in a sense, that’s hardly fair to <b>either</b> <b>of</b> us. Don’t <b>you</b> think your father has a will of his own?” ...|$|R
60|$|JUDITH. Yes, that is {{just what}} he will say to you. (Vacantly.) It doesn't matter: I shall never see <b>either</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> again.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{have made}} up my mind to see him,' {{answered}} Arthur shortly. 'But there is no need that <b>either</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> should accompany me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Boys! Are <b>either</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> wounded?" [...] asked Mr. Radbury, as {{he leaped}} from the mustang he was riding, and {{rushed into the}} cabin.|$|E
6000|$|... "Aha," [...] chuckled old Indaba-zimbi, [...] "my {{little boy}} is {{putting on his}} man's ring," [...] and he tapped the gum ring on his own head, which natives assume when they reach a certain age and dignity. [...] "Now, white man, unless you are a bigger wizard than <b>either</b> <b>of</b> us <b>you</b> had better clear off, for the fire-fight is about to begin." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I chose white roses," [...] {{proceeded}} the well-pleased mother, [...] "because I {{thought they}} would suit <b>either</b> <b>of</b> the silks <b>you</b> have now, though I own I should {{like to see you}} in another white muslin." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He’s {{the cutest}} dog breathing," [...] said the skipper fondly, [...] "and {{he knows all}} about it. He won’t bite <b>either</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wouldn't she, now? What {{would she}} be? Can <b>either</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> {{tell me what}} the wife of a Prince of Chitakov would call herself?" ...|$|E
60|$|Mel. Still I say nothing, madam; but I {{will satisfy}} <b>either</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> in private; for these matters are too tender for public discourse.|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't know! How can you? It isn't {{your brother}} or your friend. It isn't {{as if you}} cared very much for <b>either</b> <b>of</b> them. If <b>you</b> did, if you loved Dick or Ned, you might realise what I am suffering." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Will:--dear Will! Almost {{everything}} you do is good. But of what use can it be to <b>either</b> <b>of</b> us for <b>you</b> to be thinking of that which can never be? Cannot <b>you</b> think <b>of</b> me as your sister,--and only as your sister?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{first came}} into my head," [...] replied Mrs Smith, [...] "upon finding how much you were together, and feeling {{it to be the}} most {{probable}} thing in the world to be wished for by everybody belonging to <b>either</b> <b>of</b> you; and <b>you</b> may depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed <b>of</b> <b>you</b> in the same way. But I never heard it spoken of till two days ago." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>either</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> seriously {{object to}} my request," [...] Mr. Cullen replied doggedly, [...] "I {{can put the}} matter on a {{different}} basis." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Intended?" [...] she said. [...] "If <b>either</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> {{had done}} your brother justice, I don't think I should have {{mentioned}} him at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, yes," [...] {{said the}} archdeacon, {{impatient}} of poetry {{at such a}} time. [...] "Well, two paid servants, we'll say; one {{to look after the}} men, and the other to look after the money. You and Chadwick are these two servants, and whether <b>either</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> be paid too much, or too little, more or less in fact than the founder willed, it's as clear as daylight that no one can fall foul of <b>either</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> for receiving an allotted stipend." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, ay, Mr. Mackellar," [...] says my lord, [...] "we {{must not}} make a {{stranger}} <b>either</b> <b>of</b> him or <b>you.</b> I have been telling my son," [...] he added, his voice brightening as usual on the word, [...] "how much we valued all your friendly service." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I don't {{mean that}} exactly," [...] he answered. [...] "I am too {{familiar}} with cold steel and lead to be afraid <b>of</b> <b>either.</b> Do <b>you</b> know anything about odyllic force, doctor?" ...|$|R
6000|$|There {{was nobody}} who {{could write a}} poem like 'Paradise Lost,' or 'Childe Harold'; <b>either</b> <b>of</b> which made <b>you</b> feel that you really had read {{something}}.

6000|$|FENWICK. What do I care? I {{loved you}} too. Little {{he thought of}} that, little <b>either</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> thought of that. His blood--I'll have his blood! ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{shook his}} head and planted his feet squarely. [...] "I intend to make no bargain with <b>either</b> <b>of</b> <b>you.</b> This slave is not for sale." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, the Band is going,' {{he said as}} gravely {{as though}} he had been {{addressing}} a brother officer. 'Have you any parents, <b>either</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> two?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To slay, to love--the {{greatest}} enterprises of life upon a man! And I have {{no experience}} <b>of</b> <b>either.</b> <b>You</b> must forgive me anything {{that may have}} appeared to you awkward in my behaviour, inexpressive in my speeches, untimely in my silences." ...|$|R
5000|$|Addressing both Callahan and Geller, Angel said: [...] "I {{will give}} you a million dollars of my {{personal}} money right now if <b>either</b> one <b>of</b> <b>you</b> can tell me specific details of what's in here right now."
