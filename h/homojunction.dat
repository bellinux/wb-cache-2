In the more traditional BJT, also referred to as <b>homojunction</b> BJT, the efficiency of carrier injection from the emitter to the base is primarily determined by the doping ratio between the emitter and base, which means the base must be lightly doped to obtain high injection efficiency, making its resistance relatively high. In addition, higher doping in the base can improve figures of merit like the Early voltage by lessening base narrowing.|$|E

40|$|Recently, new quantum {{features}} {{have been}} observed and studied {{in the area of}} nanostructured layers. Nanograting {{on the surface of the}} thin layer imposes additional boundary conditions on the electron wave function and induces G-doping or geometry doping. G-doping is equivalent to donor doping from the point of view of the increase in electron concentration n. However, there are no ionized impurities. This preserves charge carrier scattering to the intrinsic semiconductor level and increases carrier mobility with respect to the donor-doped layer. G-doping involves electron confinement to the nanograting layer. Here, we investigate the system of multiple nanograting layers forming a series of hetero- or <b>homojunctions.</b> The system includes main and barrier layers. In the case of heterojunctions, both types of layers were G-doped. In the case of <b>homojunctions,</b> main layers were G-doped and barrier layers were donor-doped. In such systems, the dependence of n on layer geometry and material parameters was analysed. Si and GaAs <b>homojunctions</b> and GaAs/AlGaAs, Si/SiGe, GaInP/AlGAs, and InP/InAlAs heterojunctions were studied.

Driven by this promising evidence, we use first-principles methods based on density functional theory and many-body perturbation theory to investigate the electronic and optical properties of hexagonal-diamond and cubic-diamond Si NWs {{as well as their}} <b>homojunctions.</b> We show that hexagonal-diamond NWs are characterized by a more pronounced quantum confinement effect than cubic-diamond NWs.

The study of the <b>homojunctions</b> reveals that the diameter has a crucial effect on the band alignment at the interface. In particular, at small diameters the band-offset is type-I whereas at experimentally relevant sizes the offset turns up to be of type-II.

50|$|A {{heterojunction}} is {{the interface}} that occurs between two layers or regions of dissimilar crystalline semiconductors.

The combination of multiple heterojunctions together in a device is called a heterostructure, although the two terms are commonly used interchangeably. The requirement that each material be a semiconductor with unequal band gaps is somewhat loose, especially on small length scales, where electronic properties depend on spatial properties. A more modern definition of heterojunction is the interface between any two solid-state materials, including crystalline and amorphous structures of metallic, insulating, fast ion conductor and semiconducting materials.|$|E
50|$|All high {{performance}} CIGS absorbers in solar cells have similarities independent of production technique. First, they are polycrystalline α-phase {{which has the}} chalcopyrite crystal structure shown in Figure 3. The second property is an overall Cu deficiency. Cu deficiency increases the majority carrier (hole) concentration by {{increasing the number of}} (electron-accepting) Cu vacancies. When CIGS films are In rich (Cu deficient) the film's surface layer forms an ordered defect compound (ODC) with a stoichiometry of Cu(In,Ga)3Se5. The ODC is n-type, forming a p-n <b>homojunction</b> in the film at the interface between the α phase and the ODC. The recombination velocity at the CIGS/CdS interface is decreased by the homojunction's presence. The drop in interface recombination attributable to ODC formation is demonstrated by experiments which have shown that recombination in the bulk of the film is the main loss mechanism in Cu deficient films, while in Cu rich films the main loss is at the CIGS/CdS interface.|$|E

The structure of the <b>homojunction</b> shows a lower efficiency than heterojunction structures. In a heterojunction using oxide semiconductors with relatively large energy bandgaps, such as ZnO and TiO 2, the electrons move easily at the interface between the CQD and the oxide semiconductor; however, the holes cannot move across the interface and the recombination of electrons and holes decreases. Therefore, the <b>homojunction</b> CQD PVs show lower PCE than heterojunction ones [19].|$|E
