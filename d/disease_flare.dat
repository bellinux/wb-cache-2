30|$|Our study {{identified}} {{sleep disturbances}} as {{a risk factor}} for IBD flare-ups. A recent study showed that sleep disturbances were associated with an increased risk of <b>disease</b> <b>flares</b> in CD, but not in UC (Ananthakrishnan et al. 2013). The group of CD patients with impaired sleep showed a twofold increase in risk of active disease during 6  months. In the present study, there were no differences in the risk of <b>disease</b> <b>flares</b> between CD and UC. The lack of consistency between our results and Ananthakrishna’s results may be attributed to the small sample size pf the present study and the racial/ethnic differences between the subjects analyzed in the two studies.|$|R

50|$|The {{bone marrow}} cavity is {{important}} for the proper development of the immune system, and houses important stem cells for maintenance of the immune system. Within this space, as well as outside of it, cytokines produced by immune cells also have important effects on regulating bone homeostasis. Some important cytokines that are produced by the immune system, including RANKL, M-CSF, TNFa, ILs, and IFNs, affect the differentiation and activity of osteoclasts and bone resorption. Such inflammatory osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast activation can be seen in ex vivo primary cultures of cells from the inflamed synovial fluid of patients with <b>disease</b> <b>flare</b> of the autoimmune disease rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E
30|$|Inflammatory bowel {{diseases}} (IBD) such as Crohn’s disease (CD) and {{ulcerative colitis}} (UC) are chronic inflammatory disorders with unknown pathogenesis. Although {{the prevalence of}} IBD in Asian countries is lower than that in Western countries (Thia et al. 2008), it has been rapidly increasing in Japan; prevalence of CD in 2014 was 33.4 per 100, 000 people and that of UC was 142.9 per 100, 000 people. IBD displays waxing and waning phases with periods of asymptomatic remission interrupted by episodes of <b>disease</b> <b>flare.</b> Therefore, the primary treatment goal of IBD is to improve patients’ quality of life (QOL) by treating flare-ups and maintaining remission (Swanson et al. 2011). However, <b>disease</b> <b>flare</b> {{is thought to be}} multifactorial (Bernstein et al. 2010), and both triggers and risk factors for <b>disease</b> <b>flare</b> remain unclear.|$|E

30|$|We must {{acknowledge}} some {{limitations of the}} present study. First, the sample size was relatively small for a single referral hospital. Second, IBD patients with sleep disturbances were using more sleep medications than IBD patients without sleep disturbances. However, the univariate analysis revealed {{that the use of}} sleep medications was not associated with <b>disease</b> <b>flare</b> within 1  year from enrollment. Third, a consensus on the definition of <b>disease</b> <b>flare</b> of IBD has not been reached yet. The definition of <b>disease</b> <b>flare,</b> as well as the relatively short follow-up period, we adopted in the present study might have affected the present results. A long-term follow up study is deemed necessary to further confirm our results. Fourth, several studies showed that both a depressive mode and anxiety disorders are associated with sleep disturbances (Benhayon et al. 2013) and IBD flare-ups (Pariante and Miller 2001). Future studies should include these factors.|$|E
30|$|The {{prevalence}} of sleep disturbances was 44.1  % (60 out of 136 IBD patients). Use of sleep medications {{was significantly higher}} in IBD patients with sleep disturbances whereas use of immuno modulators was significantly higher in IBD patients without sleep disturbances. The scores from all HR-QOL domains were significantly lower in patients with sleep disturbances than in patients without sleep disturbances. Fifty-one patients (37.5  %) had <b>disease</b> <b>flare</b> within 1  year from enrollment {{in the study and}} sleep disturbances were identified as a significant risk factor for <b>disease</b> <b>flare</b> (OR 3.09, 95  % CI 1.47 – 6.43).|$|E
30|$|A {{retrospective}} {{cohort study}} {{was performed to}} examine the association between disease flares and sleep disturbances.

The information about <b>disease</b> <b>flare</b> within 1  year from enrollment was assessed by using medical charts. The <b>disease</b> <b>flare</b> {{was defined as a}} case with either: (1) more than 2 -point increase in disease activity score, (2) cases requiring dose escalation of immunosuppressive therapy such as tacrolimus hydrate, azathioprine, and mercaptopurine, (3) initiation or addition of new drugs such as anti-TNFα biologic agents, (4) treatment with IBD-related surgery, or (5) hospitalization.|$|E

40|$|We {{report the}} case of a 50 -year-old male former smoker. He was {{diagnosed}} as having lung adenocarcinoma and treated with induction chemoradiation therapy followed by surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. Molecular testing revealed that his tumor had an echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 -anaplastic lymphoma kinase (EML 4 -ALK) rearrangement. Therefore, he was treated with crizotinib when his disease recurred. He achieved a partial response, which persisted for 10 months until progressive disease was confirmed. Crizotinib was continued for 1 month and the tumor size increased slightly. At that time, crizotinib was discontinued and he participated in a clinical trial of erlotinib ± Met inhibitor; however, his disease progressed rapidly after discontinuation of crizotinib, and the diagnosis of <b>disease</b> <b>flare</b> was made. Readministration of crizotinib was started immediately; however, his disease progressed rapidly, and he died 2 days after starting crizotinib retreatment. Currently, the incidence of <b>disease</b> <b>flare</b> is unknown and it is impossible to predict who will experience it.

30|$|Our {{results show}} that {{approximately}} {{half of all the}} IBD patients experienced sleep disturbances as assessed by the PSQI, and their HR-QOL was more impaired than that of IBD patients without sleep disturbances.

There were no differences in other clinical characteristics such as IBD type, disease duration, and disease activity between IBD patients with and without sleep disturbances. We found <b>disease</b> <b>flare</b> in 37.5  % of IBD patients within 1  year from enrollment, and we identified the presence of sleep disturbances as a significant risk factor for <b>disease</b> <b>flare</b> among the Japanese IBD patients.|$|E

40|$|Systemic lupus {{erythematosus}} (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that predominantly affects women of reproductive age. Pregnancy and its outcome {{is a major}} concern to most SLE patients. Queries regarding the risk of <b>disease</b> <b>flares</b> during pregnancy, chance of fetal loss, and the safety of various drugs are often raised. With the improvement in the understanding of the pathogenesis of SLE and the judicious use of immunosuppressive drugs, better disease control can now be achieved and SLE patients should not be deprived of the opportunity for bearing children. Prepregnancy counselling and close collaboration with other specialists such as the obstetricians and the perinatologists is essential in optimising the maternal and fetal outcome in lupus pregnancies.

40|$|Objective. To {{examine the}} {{characteristics}} {{and frequency of}} <b>disease</b> <b>flares</b> in a cohort of people with AS. Methods. A prospective data set from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a probiotic treatment/ placebo was utilized to examine <b>disease</b> <b>flares</b> in 134 people with AS. <b>Disease</b> <b>flares</b> were defined as either minor/localized flares (pain/swelling localized to one area with fatigue and stiffness) or major/ generalized flares (generalized pain, hot burning joints, muscle spasm, fever, sweating, extreme fatigue and stiffness). Results. One hundred and thirty-four people were followed up for 1216 person follow-up weeks and there were 71. 4 flares per 100 person-weeks. Of these, 12 were major/generalized flares and 59. 4 were minor/ localized flares. People who experienced at least one major/generalized flare {{during the study period}} had worse disease during flare-free periods in terms of disease activity, impaired function, self-reported night pain and iritis compared with those who did not experience any major/generalized flares during the study. Major/generalized flares lasted for an average of 2. 4 weeks (S. D. 2. 7), and were preceded by and followed by a minor/localized flare in 92 % (55 / 60) of cases. Conclusion. Seventy per cent of people with AS felt they had a flare in any given week. Those who experienced major/generalized flares appear to have more severe and active disease even during periods when not in flare, compared with those who do not experience major/generalized flares. These results have implications for the timing of assessments prior to starting anti-TNF therapy and suggest that the presence of major flares may be helpful in identifying patients with severe disease.

40|$|The {{quality of}} spouse/partner {{relationships}} {{has been linked}} with health outcomes. Mutuality, the interest in sharing cognitive and emotional experiences in couple communications, is theorized as having importance for women's psychological health and self esteem. Mutuality was tested {{as a predictor of}} health outcomes in a rheumatoid arthritis (RA) sample (N = 54) at baseline (Time 1) and six months later (Time 2). Mutuality inversely predicted depressive symptoms at both times of measure. Mutuality failed to predict physical disability and <b>disease</b> <b>flares</b> at both times of measure. Sex differences in mutuality's links with health outcomes were explored. Results suggest that mutuality is an important predictor of depressive symptoms for women. Women who reported more mutuality in communications with their spouses/partners reported fewer depressive symptoms at both times of measure. However, no conclusions can be drawn regarding mutuality's prediction of depressive symptoms for men. Self-esteem was tested as a mediator of mutuality's link with health outcomes. Self-esteem mediated the link between mutuality and depressive symptoms at Time 2. In addition, mutuality was tested as a protective factor relative to health outcomes. Cross-lagged associations between mutuality and health outcomes at both times of measure were examined in structural equation models to determine whether mutuality drives health outcomes or vice versa. Neither mutuality nor health outcomes demonstrated temporal precedence; no support was provided for the hypothesis that mutuality is a protective factor. Finally, depressive symptoms were tested as a risk factor for physical health outcomes. Cross-lagged associations between depressive symptoms and physical health outcomes at both times of measure were examined in structural equation models to determine whether depressive symptoms drive physical health outcomes or vice versa. Temporal precedence of depressive symptoms was observed relative to <b>disease</b> <b>flares,</b> suggesting that depressive symptoms may be a risk factor for <b>disease</b> <b>flares.</b> Limitations, findings, and future directions are discussed...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND. The {{meta-analysis}} of maximal androgen blockade (MAB) {{concluded that there}} is no survival advantage of MAB over castration alone. However, the results from the largest trials yield conflicting results. METHODS. The design and results of three trials were examined. RESULTS. Most studies were planned to detect an over-optimistic difference in survival and immature data were published. The survival curves show that statistical assumptions are not fulfilled. Excluding from the mete-analysis all trials where a negative impact of <b>disease</b> <b>flare</b> on survival could not be excluded resulted in no difference in survival between MAB and castration. CONCLUSIONS. Trials of MAB should be planned to detect differences of no more than 5 - 10 % in median survival.

40|$|Staphylococcus aureus is an {{opportunistic}} pathogen {{and variable}} {{component of the}} human microbiota.

Despite this, the origins and genetic diversity of S. aureus colonizing individual patients during AE <b>disease</b> <b>flares</b> is poorly understood. To examine the micro-evolution of S. aureus colonization we have deep-sequenced S. aureus populations from nine children with moderate to severe AE, and 18 non-atopic children asymptomatically carrying S. aureus nasally. Colonization by clonal S. aureus populations was observed in both AE cases and controls, with {{all but one of the}} individuals containing colonies belonging to a single sequence type. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that <b>disease</b> <b>flares</b> were associated with the clonal expansion of the S. aureus population, occurring over a period of weeks to months. There was a significant difference in the genetic backgrounds of S. aureus colonizing AE patients versus controls (Fisher's Exact test, p= 0. 03).
