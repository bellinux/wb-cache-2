The second study entitled 'Multimodal analysis of hotel homepages: A comparison of hotel websites across different star categories', expanding on the first one, aims to compare the patterns of use of multimodal features of hotel <b>homepages</b> of three-star, four-star and five-star hotels in Hong Kong.

The focus of this investigator’s study was to test 13 <b>homepages</b> used by Kim et al. with participants from the United States and determine whether the same aesthetic dimensions were evoked in U. S. participants. The resulting survey data of U. S. participants were compared with the survey data for South Korean participants. An initial analysis determined that U. S. participants generally agreed with South Korean participants about which aesthetic adjectives were in an aesthetic category. Other analyses showed no shared perceptions for <b>homepages</b> or adjective sets in aesthetic dimensions. This investigation suggested that aesthetic design principles for <b>homepages</b> from one culture are unlikely to predictably influence other cultures. A regression analysis was also used to investigate aesthetic design elements that prompt responses in U. S. participants...|$|R
5|$|Flyers {{distributed}} to recruit participants said {{the attack was}} to begin at 8pmAEST on 10 February. On that day, government websites were targeted by denial-of-service attacks. The Communications Department said the hackers had not infiltrated government security, but had instead swamped government computer servers. Sites were left unavailable for sporadic periods throughout the attack. At one point, the Australian Parliament's website was offline for about two days due to the high volume of requests. Rudd's government site was also inaccessible for some time. As a primary target, the Communications Department also received {{a large amount of}} traffic. Government offices were also flooded with e-mail spam, junk faxes, and prank phone calls. The Prime Minister's <b>homepage</b> was vandalized with pornographic images. The flyer released before the attack called for the faxes to focus on cartoon pornography, female ejaculation, and small-breasted pornography.|$|E

5|$|Independence and {{partition}} inspired {{literary and}} other artistic creations. Such creations mostly describe the human cost of partition, limiting the holiday {{to a small}} part of their narrative. Salman Rushdie's novel Midnight's Children (1980), which won the Booker Prize and the Booker of Bookers, wove its narrative around children born at midnight of 14–15 August 1947 with magical abilities. Freedom at Midnight (1975) is a non-fiction work by Larry Collins and Dominique Lapierre that chronicled the events surrounding the first Independence Day celebrations in 1947. Few films centre on the moment of independence, instead highlighting the circumstances of partition and its aftermath. On the Internet, Google has commemorated Independence Day since 2003 with a special doodle on its Indian <b>homepage.</b>|$|E
40|$|University <b>homepages</b> {{often provide}} the first {{introduction}} {{to a university}} for many students in an increasingly global world. As a result, a university™s ability to attract new students may rest {{in large part on}} the ability of a website to attract and hold the attention of its intended audience. The purpose of this exploratory study was to examine potential cross-cultural differences in 'persuasive appeals' which may influence how much people from varying cultural backgrounds may trust university <b>homepages.</b> More specifically, this paper attempts to identify cultural differences in the symbolic aspects of these persuasive appeals in university <b>homepages</b> through the identification of cultural markers in message content guided by Hofstede's (1980). As the ultimate aim {{of this study is to}} design guidelines for developers of university websites that will cater to a global audience, the goals for this preliminary work are to (1) identify cultural differences in symbolic appeals in university <b>homepages</b> and (2) provide design guidelines for university <b>homepages</b> that are pertinent to, and will hold, persuasive appeal for the end user's cultural mind set. Two initial models, derived from the findings of this study are offered on how cultural differences may influence the impact of persuasive appeals in university <b>homepages.</b> The central findings are discussed in terms of some preliminary implications for future web design...|$|R

This paper {{discusses}} our algorithm {{for finding}} subgroups among personal <b>homepages.</b> Assuming that personal <b>homepages</b> usually carry personal information, {{we have developed}} an algorithm {{that allows us to}} automatically find potential patterns from them. For example, when the algorithm is applied to personal <b>homepages</b> at some school, we can approximate the ratio between the number of students interested in in-formation science and that of students interested in social science. In the experiment, we successfully created subgroups that showed characteris-tics of the school. Also, we found relations between subgroups that are important for enhancing human activity. ...|$|R

5|$|Rodin {{restored}} {{an ancient}} role of sculpture– {{to capture the}} physical and intellectual force of the human subject– and he freed sculpture from the repetition of traditional patterns, providing the foundation for greater experimentation in the 20th century. His popularity is ascribed to his emotion-laden representations of ordinary men and women– to his ability to find the beauty and pathos in the human animal. His most popular works, such as The Kiss and The Thinker, are widely used outside the fine arts as symbols of human emotion and character. To honor Rodin's artistic legacy, the Google search engine <b>homepage</b> displayed a Google Doodle featuring The Thinker to celebrate his 172nd birthday on 12 November 2012.|$|E
5|$|Alex Tew, {{a student}} from Cricklade in Wiltshire, England, {{conceived}} The Million Dollar <b>Homepage</b> in August 2005 when he was 21 years old. He {{was about to begin}} a three-year Business Management course at the University of Nottingham, and was concerned that he would be left with a student loan that could take years to repay. As a money-raising idea, Tew decided to sell a million pixels on a website for $1 each; purchasers would add their own image, logo or advertisement, and have the option of including a hyperlink to their website. Pixels were sold for US dollars rather than UK pounds; the US has a larger online population than the UK, and Tew believed more people would relate to the concept if the pixels were sold in US currency. In 2005, the pound was strong against the dollar: £1 was worth approximately $1.80, and that cost per pixel may have been too expensive for many potential buyers. Tew's setup costs were €50, which paid for the registration of the domain name and a basic web-hosting package. The website went live on 26 August 2005.|$|E
5|$|In a {{statement}} on its website, ReactOS cited differing legal definitions of what constitutes clean-room reverse engineering as a cause for the conflict. Some countries, including the United States, require that a reimplementation based on disassembled code must be written by someone other than the person having disassembled and examined the original code, whereas other countries allow both tasks to be performed by the same individual. Consequently, ReactOS clarified that its Intellectual Property Policy Statement requirements on clean room reverse engineering conform to US law. An internal source code audit was conducted to ensure that only clean room reverse engineering was used, and all developers were made to sign an agreement committing them {{to comply with the}} project's policies on reverse engineering. Contributors to its development were not affected by these events, and all access to the software development tools was restored shortly afterward. In September 2007, with the audit nearing completion, the audit status was removed from the ReactOS <b>homepage.</b> Though the audit was completed, specific details were not made public as it was only an internal effort to ensure compliance with the project's own policies.|$|E
