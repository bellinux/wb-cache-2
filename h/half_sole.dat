50|$|The 1917 Trench Boot was an {{adaptation}} of the boots American manufacturers were selling to the French and Belgian armies {{at the beginning of}} World War I. In American service, it replaced the Russet Marching Shoe. The boot was made of tanned cowhide with a <b>half</b> middle <b>sole</b> covered by a full sole, studded with five rows of hobnails. Iron plates were fixed to the heel. It was a great improvement, however it lacked waterproofing, leading to trench foot.|$|R

The {{costs and benefits of}} intercropping young timber trees with food crops was studied in a 1000 stem ha stand of Paraserianthes falcataria. At 2 years of age, diameter at breast height and height of inter-cropped trees were 33 and 21 % greater, respectively, than sole trees. Management costs of intercropped trees were less than <b>half</b> of <b>sole</b> trees. Allometric equations for Mindanao falca-taria were used to project future tree growth and [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The {{integration}} of forage legumes into the low-input, cereal-based farming {{system of the}} Sahel {{may be the key}} to sustaining soil, crop, and livestock production. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of intercropping the forage legumes Stylosanthes fruticosa (Retz.) Slston or S. hamata (L.) R. Br. on grain yield, fodder yield, and crude protein (CP) yield and concentration. Four field trials were conducted on a Psammentic Paleustalf (siliceous, isohyperthermic) soil from 1988 to 1990 at Sadore, Niger. Each Stylosanthes species was grown in alternate single and triple row patterns with millet for 1 and 2 yr, with stylo regrowing from stubble during the second year. Control treatments were sole crops of millet and stylo. Intercropping either Stylosanthes species with millet for 1 yr in alternate single rows did not affect millet grain yield, because of low stylo competition. Total dry matter (DM) harvested of intercrop was similar to that of sole millet, while CP concentration of total DM increased moderately from 43 g kg- 1 in sole millet crop to 75 g kg- 1 in intercroDuring the second year of association, stylo was very competitive, depressing intercropped millet grain by an average of 67 percent in 1989 and 48 percent in 1990 compared with sole millet grain yield. Total DM and CP yield, and CP concentration of the harvested fodder were, respectively, 1. 4, 3. 0, and 2. 3 times greater in intercrop than sole millet. Millet-stylo intercrops, with each species planted at <b>half</b> its <b>sole</b> crop density, appear to have an advantage in fodder yield and CP over sole millet cropping but not in total grain yield...|$|R
60|$|November 28th.--I {{have grown}} wofully aristocratic in my tastes, I fear, {{since coming to}} England; at all events, I am {{conscious}} of a certain disgust at going to dine {{in a house with}} a small entrance-hall and a narrow staircase, parlor with chintz curtains, and all other arrangements on a similar scale. This is pitiable. However, I really do not think I should mind these things, {{were it not for the}} bustle, the affectation, the intensity, of the mistress of the house. It is certain that a woman in England is either decidedly a lady or decidedly not a lady. There seems to be no respectable medium. Bill of fare: broiled <b>soles,</b> <b>half</b> of a roast pig, a haricot of mutton, stewed oysters, a tart, pears, figs, with sherry and port wine, both good, and the port particularly so. I ate some pig, and could hardly resist the lady's importunities to eat more; though to my fancy it tasted of swill,--had a flavor of the pigsty. On the parlor table were some poor editions of popular books, Longfellow's poems and others. The lady affects a literary taste, and bothered me about my own productions.|$|R
60|$|Pansy {{was not in}} {{the first}} of the rooms, a large {{apartment}} with a concave ceiling and walls covered with old red damask; it was here Mrs. Osmond usually sat--though she was not in her most customary place to-night--and that a circle of more especial intimates gathered about the fire. The room was flushed with subdued, diffused brightness; it contained the larger things and--almost always--an odour of flowers. Pansy on this occasion was presumably in the next of the series, the resort of younger visitors, where tea was served. Osmond stood before the chimney, leaning back with his hands behind him; he had one foot up and was warming the <b>sole.</b> <b>Half</b> a dozen persons, scattered near him, were talking together; but he {{was not in the}} conversation; his eyes had an expression, frequent with them, that seemed to represent them as engaged with objects more worth their while than the appearances actually thrust upon them. Rosier, coming in unannounced, failed to attract his attention; but the young man, who was very punctilious, though he was even exceptionally conscious that it was the wife, not the husband, he had come to see, went up to shake hands with him. Osmond put out his left hand, without changing his attitude.|$|R
500|$|In {{the face}} of the rock, south from the town, is the famous stone, known by the name of the mistress-stone; it resembles a door exactly; and is in the very front of this rock, which is twenty or thirty fathom [...] {{perpendicular}} in height, the figure of it being discernible about the distance of a mile; upon the lintel of this door, every bachelor-wooer is by an ancient custom obliged in honour to give a specimen of his affection for the love of his mistress, and it is thus; he is to stand on his left foot, having the one <b>half</b> of his <b>sole</b> over the rock, and then he draws the right foot further out to the left, and in this posture bowing, he puts both his fists further out to the right foot; and then after he has performed this, he has acquired no small reputation, being always after it accounted worthy of the finest mistress in the world: they firmly believe that this achievement is always attended with the desired success.This being the custom of the place, one of the inhabitants very gravely desired me to let him know the time limited by me for trying of this piece of gallantry before I design’d to leave the place, that he might attend me; I told him this performance would have a quite contrary effect upon me, by robbing me both of my life and mistress at the same moment.|$|R
40|$|Chronic hypertrophic pododermatitis {{cases in}} six horses of {{different}} breeds, aging 14 months to 19 years are described. The lesion begun with a infiltrative {{tissue in the}} frog and sole regions of the hoof, characterized by a fast and disorganized growth, with a papillary aspect, white colored in the roots and dark on the extremity, with a necrotic secretion and an extremely fetid odor. Microscopically, an exuberant epidermic proliferative tissue was observed, intermingled with little connective tissue. The horses {{were divided into two}} treatment groups. In the first group, including three young mares and a foal, showing lesions in only one limb, a surgical resection of the invasive mass was performed, followed by cauterization of the remaining edges and subsequent daily local application of antiseptic substances. In three of these horses, recurrence of the initial lesion occurred, with fast growth of hyperplasic tissue, affecting almost all the frog and <b>half</b> of the <b>sole.</b> Two horses developed contraction deformities of the hoof. In the second group, one male and one female, each with lesions in two limbs, after surgical debridement of the tissue, the animals received daily applications of picric acid 5 %, associated to local use of oxitetracyclin. Although one of these cases required a second surgical intervention for removal of the mass, the horses showed after a period of two to three months total absence of the infiltrative tissue. The use of local picric acid 5 % and oxitetracyclin associated to previous surgical debridement showed to be more efficient than the use of antiseptic substances in the treatment of chronic hypertrophic pododermatitis...|$|R
50|$|Under Augustus, the European {{borders of}} the empire he {{inherited}} from his grand-uncle Julius Caesar were considerably expanded. During the first <b>half</b> of his <b>sole</b> rule (30-9 BC), Augustus' central strategic objective was to advance the Roman border from Illyricum and Macedonia {{to the line of}} the Danube, Europe's greatest river, in order both to increase strategic depth between the border and Italy and to provide a major fluvial supply route for the Roman armies in the region. The strategy was successfully executed: Moesia (29-7 BC), Noricum (16 BC), Raetia (15 BC) and Pannonia (12-9 BC) were annexed in steady succession. After settling the Danube border, Augustus {{turned his attention to the}} North, where Julius Caesar had in 51 BC established the border of Roman Gaul along the river Rhine, the second major European fluvial route. Augustus launched an ambitious strategy of advancing the Rhine border to the river Elbe, aiming to incorporate all the warlike Germanic tribes. This would eliminate their chronic threat to Gaul, increase strategic depth between free Germans and Gaul, and make the western Germans' formidable manpower available to the Roman army. But a massive and sustained military effort (6 BC - AD 9) came to nothing. Roman advances in Germania Magna (i.e. Germany outside the empire) had to be scaled down during the Great Illyrian Revolt of AD 6-9, when many troops were diverted to Illyricum. Then Augustus' expansion strategy suffered a crushing setback when some 20,000 Roman troops were ambushed and massacred by the Germans at the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in AD 9. After this, Augustus shelved his Elbe strategy. It was apparently revived briefly by his successor Tiberius, whose nephews, the generals Germanicus and Drusus, launched major and successful operations in Germania in AD 14-17, during which the main tribes responsible for Varus' defeat were crushed and the three lost legionary aquilae (eagle-standards) were recovered.|$|R
