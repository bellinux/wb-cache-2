25|$|<b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anybody</b> {{anywhere}} today, I sometimes wonder, who had {{the opportunities}} which were mine, during three score and ten years of my adult life, to enjoy wonderful wines, the like of which the post-wars generations will never know, and the privilege to enjoy them with such wonderful friends? I doubt it. One of my oldest friends–he was born in 1847–was Sir James Agg-Gardner, a little man and a great lover of wine: he was M.P. for Cheltenham, and Chairman of the Kitchen Committee of the House of Commons; {{he was one of}} a few friends who lunched with me at my old Mark Lane headquarters, in 1918, to celebrate my return to civilian life. There were still, on that day, four magnums of Cockburn 1847 in the cellar; we had one of them and it really was magnificent! We were {{on the eve of a}} General Election and we all drank good luck to Sir James in the wine of his own vintage. I promised him, somewhat rashly, another magnum of 1847 Cockburn, should he be re-elected. He was re-elected, of course, not only that year, but twice again during the next twelve months: it took three elections in two years to get a working majority, and this was why and how my last three magnums of Cockburn 1847 went in two years! No regrets: they were at their best and could not possibly have been any better had they been kept any longer.|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Love began {{composing}} {{an album}} with songwriter Linda Perry of 4 Non Blondes, titled America's Sweetheart, also reuniting with drummer Patty Schemel. Love signed with Virgin Records to release it, and began recording it in France in 2003. America's Sweetheart {{was released in}} February 2004, and received mixed reviews from critics. Charles Aaron of Spin called it a [...] "jaw-dropping act of artistic will and a fiery, proper follow-up to 1994's Live Through This" [...] and awarded it eight out of ten stars, while The Village Voice said: [...] " [...] willing to act out the dream of every teenage brat who ever {{wanted to have a}} glamorous, high-profile hissyfit, and she turns those egocentric nervous breakdowns into art. Sure, the art becomes less compelling when you've been pulling the same stunts for a decade. But, honestly, <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anybody</b> out there who fucks up better?" [...] The album sold less than 100,000 copies. Love has publicly expressed her regret over the record several times, reasoning that her drug issues at the time were to blame: [...] "America's Sweetheart was my one true piece of shit. It has no cohesive thread. I just hate it", she said in a 2014 interview. Shortly after the record was released, Love told Kurt Loder on TRL: [...] "I cannot exist as a solo artist. It's a joke." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I would, Tom, if <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>there</b> when I pray; but it's all {{speaking}} unto nothing, when I do. But come, Tom, {{you pray}} now, and show me how." ...|$|R
60|$|So when Sir Percival came forth {{again from}} Joyous Gard, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no knight, {{unless it was}} Sir Launcelot himself, who could surpass him in skill at arms; nay, not even his own brother, Sir Lamorack; nor <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>anybody,</b> even if one were Sir Gawaine or Sir Geraint, who surpassed him in civility of courtliness or nobility of demeanor.|$|R
60|$|WISE MAN. Oh, {{look out}} of the door and tell me if <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>there</b> in the street. I cannot leave this glass; {{somebody}} might shake it! Then the sand would fall quickly.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Is {{there anybody}} here that knows him?' cried the little man. 'Is there anybody here that knows him? Oh, my stars, <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anybody</b> here that knows him?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's so; I {{ought to}} have remembered him," [...] exclaimed Peter. [...] "I've noticed that he is very fond of the same house year after year. <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anybody</b> else?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am alone, I am alone," [...] he wailed feebly, groping vaguely {{about with}} his {{trembling}} hands. [...] "Is there anybody near me? <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anybody?</b> I am afraid of this strange place." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Fortunately {{the house}} was dark, and I don't believe <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>there</b> who knew me. And I thought I was {{becoming}} sensible and self-controlled and womanly! It is plain I have some distance to go yet before I attain that devoutly desired consummation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes, he will," [...] said Bellingham. [...] "Tell him it's business. <b>There</b> won't <b>be</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>there.</b> Will nine <b>be</b> {{too late}} for him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The tune {{was called}} [...] "Invitation,"--one of those profusely florid in runs, and trills, and quavers, which delighted {{the ears of}} a former generation; and Miss Ruey, innocently {{unconscious}} {{of the effect of}} old age on her voice, ran them up and down, and out and in, {{in a way that would}} have made a laugh, had <b>there</b> <b>been</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>there</b> to notice or to laugh.|$|R
6000|$|Merton nodded. 'But I {{must do it}} alone. The detectives {{must stay}} here. Now if I leave, dressed as I am, by the 10.49, I'll be tracked all the way. <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anybody</b> in the country whom you can {{absolutely}} trust?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here, if you're {{telling the}} truth you needn't be afraid--nobody'll hurt you. But don't try to budge; stand right where you are. Rouse out Bob and Tom, some of you, and fetch the guns. George Jackson, <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anybody</b> with you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Sir, Mr Merdle {{never was}} the gentleman, and no ungentlemanly act on Mr Merdle's part would {{surprise}} me. <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anybody</b> else I can send to you, {{or any other}} directions I can give before I leave, respecting what you would wish to be done?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know. I ain't {{sure that}} it would <b>be</b> cowardice. If <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>anybody</b> I could injure by doing it, it would be cowardly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Paul Irving?" [...] <b>There</b> <b>was</b> {{a subtle}} change in Miss Lavendar's voice. [...] "Who is he? I didn't think <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>anybody</b> {{of that name}} in Avonlea." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Jake," [...] said Andrew cautiously, [...] "rather puzzles me: I can get {{so little}} out of him, though I like the man. As you seem to know the people I have to deal with, <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anybody</b> else whose {{trustworthiness}} you would vouch for?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{strikes me}} that you're the most marryingest woman that ever made a man sit up and take notice. And now another question. You see, I've just got to locate {{the lay of the}} land. <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anybody</b> you like as much as you like me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{would it}} be any good? I'd rather cut my throat and have done with it than go about teasing her because her parents let me come to her." [...] Then {{there was a pause}} during which they walked on, the {{attorney}} feeling that he had nothing more to say. [...] "What I want to know," [...] said Larry, [...] "is this. <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anybody</b> else?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never mind, of course," [...] she answered, {{recovering}} herself. [...] "How you startled me, Mr. Bingham! I {{had no idea}} <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>anybody</b> on the beach." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose it}} doesn't {{manufacture}} the malaria germ, {{and from the}} looks of the place one wouldn't imagine <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>anybody</b> else about for it to bite." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{sorry if}} I'm intruding," [...] he apologized. [...] "I meant to have supper with the boys, and Symonds didn't tell me <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>anybody</b> in the room." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] he said, [...] "we'll {{take the}} matter of the paint first. It's a {{question}} of Yes or No with the paint--which is short. It's a question of petticoats with the women--which is long. What o'clock was it when the servants were in this room yesterday morning? Eleven o'clock--eh? <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anybody</b> in the house who knows whether that paint was wet or dry, at eleven yesterday morning?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There's the pony, sir,' said Kit--'Whisker, ma'am (and {{he knows}} so well I'm {{talking about him}} that he begins to neigh directly, Sir)--would he let anybody come near him but me, ma'am? Here's the garden, sir, and Mr Abel, ma'am. Would Mr Abel part with me, Sir, or <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anybody</b> that could be fonder of the garden, ma'am? It would break mother's heart, Sir, and even little Jacob would have sense enough to cry his eyes out, ma'am, if he thought that Mr Abel could wish to part with me so soon, after having told me, only the other day, that he hoped we might be {{together}} for years to come--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's interesting, isn't it, sir," [...] says Barnes, {{turning to}} the Colonel, [...] "to see such union in families? Whenever I come here, my aunt trots out all my relations; and I send a man round in the mornin to ask how they all are. So Uncle Hobson is gone to bed sick with a hookah? I {{know there was a}} deuce of a row made when I smoked at Marblehead. You are promised to us for Wednesday, please. <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anybody</b> you would like to meet? Not our friend the Rummun? How the girls crowd round him! By Gad, a fellow who's rich in London may have the pick of any gal--not here--not in this sort of thing; I mean in society, you know," [...] says Barnes confidentially, [...] "I've seen the old dowagers crowdin round that fellow, and the girls snugglin up to his india-rubber face. He's known to have two wives already in India; but, by Gad, for a settlement, I believe some of 'em here would marry--I mean of the girls in society." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are all in}} a {{conspiracy}} together," [...] shouted Camilla, [...] "you <b>are!</b> <b>There</b> never <b>was</b> <b>anybody</b> so badly treated,--never,--never,--never! What will everybody say of me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{who told}} YOU as <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>anybody</b> here?" [...] inquired Jenny's husband, {{who had made}} a surly stop in his eating to listen and now {{measured}} him with his eye.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't believe there'll <b>be</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>there</b> from Markdale. The {{lecturer}} {{is going}} to Markdale next week. They'll wait for that," [...] said the Story Girl airily.|$|R
60|$|Sir Barnet {{was proud}} of making people acquainted with people. He liked the thing for its own sake, and it {{advanced}} his favourite object too. For example, if Sir Barnet {{had the good fortune}} to get hold of a law recruit, or a country gentleman, and ensnared him to his hospitable villa, Sir Barnet would say to him, on the morning after his arrival, 'Now, my dear Sir, <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anybody</b> you would like to know? Who is there you would wish to meet? Do you take any interest in writing people, or in painting or sculpturing people, or in acting people, or in anything of that sort?' Possibly the patient answered yes, and mentioned somebody, of whom Sir Barnet had no more personal knowledge than of Ptolemy the Great. Sir Barnet replied, that nothing on earth was easier, as he knew him very well: immediately called on the aforesaid somebody, left his card, wrote a short note,--'My dear Sir--penalty of your eminent position--friend at my house naturally desirous--Lady Skettles and myself participate--trust that genius being superior to ceremonies, you will do us the distinguished favour of giving us the pleasure,' etc, etc.--and so killed a brace of birds with one stone, dead as door-nails.|$|E
60|$|In short, sir, I mean to try {{for this}} chair. I do believe I can make {{something}} out of it. It will be a pulpit in a sense; for I am nothing if not moral, as you know. My works are unfortunately so light and trifling they may interfere. But if you think, as I think, I am fit to fight it, send me the best kind of testimonial stating all you can in favour of me and, with your best art, turning the difficulty of my never having done anything in history, strictly speaking. Second, <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anybody</b> else, think you, from whom I could wring one--I mean, you could wring one for me. Any party in London or Cambridge who thinks well enough of my little books to back me up with a few heartfelt words? Jenkin approves highly; but says, pile in English testimonials. Now I only know Stephen, Symonds, Lang, Gosse and you, and Meredith, to be sure. The chair is in the gift of the Faculty of Advocates, where I believe I am more wondered at than loved. I do not know the foundation; one or two hundred, I suppose. But {{it would be a good}} thing for me, out and out good. Help me to live, help me to work, for I am the better of pressure, and help me to say what I want about God, man and life.|$|E
6000|$|How {{she came}} to be sitting in Trafalgar Square she did not know. Tears had formed a mist between her and all that seething, summer-evening crowd. Her eyes {{mechanically}} followed the wandering search-lights, those new milky ways, quartering the heavens and leading nowhere. All was wonderfully beautiful, the sky a deep dark blue, the moonlight whitening the spire of St. Martin's, and everywhere endowing the great blacked-out buildings with dream-life. Even the lions had come to life, and stared out over this moonlit desert of little human figures {{too small to be}} worth the stretching out of a paw. She sat there, aching dreadfully, as if the longing of every bereaved heart in all the town had settled in her. She felt it tonight a thousand times worse; for last night she had been drugged on the new sensation of love triumphantly fulfilled. Now she felt as if life had placed her in the corner of a huge silent room, blown out the flame of joy, and locked the door. A little dry sob came from her. The hay-fields and Cyril, with shirt unbuttoned at the neck, pitching hay and gazing at her while she dabbled her fork in the thin leavings. The bright river, and their boat grounded on the shallows, and the swallows flitting over them. And that long dance, with the feel of his hand between her shoulder-blades! Memories so sweet and sharp that she almost cried out. She saw again their dark grassy courtyard in the Abbey, and the white owl flying over them. The white owl! Flying there again to-night, with no lovers on the grass below! She could only picture Cyril now as a brown atom in that swirling brown flood of men, flowing to a huge brown sea. Those cruel minutes on the platform, when she had searched and searched the walking wood for her, one tree, seemed to have burned themselves into her eyes. Cyril was lost, she could not single him out, all blurred among those thousand other shapes. And suddenly she thought: 'And I--I'm lost to him; he's never seen me at home, never seen me in London; he won't be able to imagine me. It's all in the past, only the past--for both of us. <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anybody</b> so unhappy?' And the town's voices-wheels, and passing feet, whistles, talk, laughter--seemed to answer callously: 'Not one.' She looked at her wrist-watch; like his, it had luminous hands: 'Half-past ten' was greenishly imprinted there. She got up in dismay. They would think she was lost, or run over, or something silly! She could not find an empty taxi, and began to walk, uncertain of her way at night. At last she stopped a policeman, and said: ...|$|E
6000|$|So Sydney, {{with a list}} {{of names}} and packet of cards, betook herself to her brother's writing-table, never perceiving that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>anybody</b> under the Algerine rug, till <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a movement, {{suddenly}} checked, and a voice said—- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Vance!" [...] cried Morris. [...] "Do {{you think}} we are playing a {{pantomime}} for our amusement? <b>There</b> <b>was</b> never <b>anybody</b> named Vance who wasn't a music-hall singer." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "There are 25 {{years of}} good social science that {{demonstrate}} the many cultural practices that act collectively to discourage women from entering and continuing careers {{in science and}} engineering. The research is overwhelming, and it <b>is</b> <b>there</b> for <b>anybody</b> to see. On the other hand, the data that would suggest <b>there</b> <b>are</b> innate differences in the abilities {{of men and women}} to succeed in the natural sciences are nonexistent." ...|$|R
