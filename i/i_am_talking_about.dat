25|$|The oldest extant {{literary}} {{text in the}} Maltese {{language is}} Pietru Caxaro's poem, Cantilena (circa 1470 to 1485) (also known as Xidew il-Qada), followed by Gian Francesco Bonamico's sonnet of praise to Grand Master Nicolò Cotoner, Mejju gie' bl'Uard, u Zahar (The month of May has arrived, with roses and orange blossoms), circa 1672. The earliest known Maltese dictionary was written by Francois de Vion Thezan Court (circa 1640). In 1700, an anonymous Gozitan poet wrote Jaħasra Mingħajr Ħtija (Unfortunately Innocent). A Maltese translation of the Lord's Prayer appeared in Johannes Heinrich Maius's work Specimen Lingua Punicæ in hodierna Melitensium superstitis (1718). A collection of religious sermons by a certain Dun Ignazio Saverio Mifsud, published between 1739 and 1746, is now regarded as the earliest known Maltese prose. An anonymous poem entitled Fuqek Nitħaddet Malta (<b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> you, Malta), was written circa 1749, regarding the uprising of the slaves of that year. A few years later, in 1752, a catechism entitled Tagħlim Nisrani ta' Dun Franġisk Wizzino (Don Francesco Wizzino's Christian Teachings) was published in both Maltese and Italian. The occasion of Carnival in 1760 saw {{the publication of a}} collection of burlesque verses under the heading Żwieġ la Maltija (Marriage, in the Maltese Style), by Dun Feliċ Demarco.|$|E
2500|$|Yousef {{has stated}} that despite his {{conversion}} to Christianity, he is [...] "against religion", and does not adhere to any denomination of Christianity. He has stated, [...] "Religion steals freedom, kills creativity, turns us into slaves and against one another. Yes, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> Christianity as well as Islam. Most Christians I have seen, seem to have missed the point, that Jesus redeemed us from religion. Religion is nothing but man's attempts {{to get back to}} God. Whether it is Islam, Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism, Hinduism, animism, any ism. Religion can't save mankind. Only Jesus could save mankind through his death and resurrection. And Jesus {{is the only way to}} God." ...|$|E

2500|$|Blackmore Evans {{suggested}} that Sonnet 36 {{was influenced by}} Ephesians 5:25-33, [...] "Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless. In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. After all, no one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as Christ does the church— for we are members of his body. 'For this reason a man will leave {{his father and mother}} and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.' This is a profound mystery—but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> Christ and the church. However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The {{final and}} best means of {{strengthening}} demand among consumers and {{business is to}} reduce the burden on private income and the deterrents to private initiative which are imposed by our present tax system; and this administration pledged itself last summer to an across-the-board, top-to-bottom cut in personal and corporate income taxes to be enacted and become effective in 1963. I am not talking about a 'quickie' or a temporary tax cut, which would be more appropriate if a recession were imminent. Nor am I talking about giving the economy a mere shot in the arm, to ease some temporary complaint. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> the accumulated evidence of the last 5 years that our present tax system, developed as it was, in good part, during World War II to restrain growth, exerts too heavy a drag on growth in peace time; that it siphons out of the private economy too large a share of personal and business purchasing power; that it reduces the financial incentives for personal effort, investment, and risk-taking." ...|$|E
2500|$|... “The {{ministry}} {{is not like}} the Senate. The {{ministry is}} not a Congress for anyone {{to come here to}} express his opinion. The ministry has no capacity for that. The ministry is altogether filled up with a fighting spirit. I do not control any church. All the saints who have left the denominations, the divisive sects, and stand on the proper ground are a local church in their locality. They can express their opinions, but they may {{have nothing to do with}} this ministry... This does not mean that I ask you to stay away from your local church or that your local church is no longer a local church... I am not talking about the churches, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> the ministry. The ministry is one thing, and the churches are another thing. These two things can be differentiated in the Epistles written by Paul. Paul’s ministry is one category, and the churches are another category. Paul never tried to force all the churches to follow him in his ministry, but Paul surely had a ministry for the churches.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Powell {{claimed in}} an article for The Guardian on 7 December 1988 that the new Western-friendly foreign policy of Russia under Mikhail Gorbachev heralded [...] "the death and burial of the American empire". Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany had decided to visit Moscow to {{negotiate}} German reunification, signalling to Powell that the last gasp of American power in Europe {{to be replaced by}} a new balance of power not resting on military force but on the [...] "recognition of the restraints which the ultimate certainty of failure places upon the ambitions of the respective national states." [...] In an interview for the Sunday People the same month, he claimed the Conservative Party was [...] "rejoining Enoch" [...] on the European Community but repeated his warning of civil war as the consequence of immigration: [...] "I still cannot forsee how a country can be peaceably governed in which the composition of the population is progressively going to change. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> violence on a scale which can only be described as civil war. I cannot see there can be any other outcome". It would not be a race war but [...] "about people who revolt against being trapped in a situation where they feel at the mercy of a built-in racial majority, whatever its colour" [...] and claimed that the government had made contingency plans for such an event. The solution he claimed was repatriation on a large scale and the cost of doing this in welfare payments and pensions was well worth paying.|$|E
2500|$|In the French {{edition of}} [...] "Lutetia" [...] Heine wrote, {{one year before}} he died: [...] "This confession, that the future belongs to the Communists, I made with an {{undertone}} of the greatest fear and sorrow and, oh!, this undertone by no means is a mask! Indeed, with fear and terror I imagine the time, when those dark iconoclasts come to power: with their raw fists they will batter all marble images of my beloved world of art, they will ruin all those fantastic anecdotes that the poets loved so much, they will chop down my Laurel forests and plant potatoes and, oh!, the herbs chandler will use my Book of Songs to make bags for coffee and snuff for the old women of the future – oh!, I can foresee all this and I feel deeply sorry thinking of this decline threatening my poetry and the old world order – And yet, I freely confess, the same thoughts have a magical appeal upon my soul which I cannot resist .... In my chest there are two voices in their favour which cannot be silenced .... because {{the first one is}} that of logic ... and as I cannot object to the premise [...] "that all {{people have the right to}} eat", I must defer to all the conclusions....The second of the two compelling voices, of which I am talking, is even more powerful than the first, because it is the voice of hatred, the hatred I dedicate to this common enemy that constitutes the most distinctive contrast to communism and that will oppose the angry giant already at the first instance – <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> the party of the so-called advocates of nationality in Germany, about those false patriots whose love for the fatherland only exists in the shape of imbecile distaste of foreign countries and neighbouring peoples and who daily pour their bile especially on France".|$|E

6000|$|... "Thank God that is off my mind!" [...] Andrew said. [...] "And I will off to bed, or Janet will {{wonder what}} <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> so long.

6000|$|... "Ideals!" [...] she echoed.
