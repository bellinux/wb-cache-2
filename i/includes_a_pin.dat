A joint <b>includes</b> <b>a</b> <b>pin,</b> a tang, and a shackle. The pin is tapered at the same angle as the bores extending through the projections of the shackle and the tang. A spring washer biases the tang onto the tapered sidewall of the pin. The invention solves the free play problem associated with deployable space structures by using a tapered pin which is held in tapered holes by the spring washers...|$|E

40|$|A {{control is}} {{provided}} for a {{friction stir welding}} apparatus comprising a pin tool which includes a shoulder and a rotating pin extending outwardly from {{the shoulder of the}} pin tool and which, in use, is plunged into a workpiece formed contacting workpiece members to stir weld the members together. The control system controls the penetration of the pin tool into the workpiece members which are mounted on a support anvil. The control system <b>includes</b> <b>a</b> <b>pin</b> length controller for controlling pin length relative to the shoulder and for producing a corresponding pin length signal. A pin force sensor senses the force being exerted on the pin during welding and produces a corresponding actual pin force signal. A probe controller controls a probe extending outwardly from the pin, senses a parameter related to the distance between the probe and the supporting anvil and produces a corresponding probe signal. A workpiece standoff sensor senses the standoff distance between the workpiece and the standoff sensor and produces a corresponding standoff signal. A control unit receives the various signals, together with a weld schedule, and, based on these signals and the weld schedule, controls the pin length controller so as to control pin penetration into the workpiece...|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe compare by {{numerical}} simulation several options to increase up to 112 Gbit/s the bit rate used for intra-data center interconnections {{relying on the}} recently proposed Passive Optical Pod Interconnect (POPI) architecture, itself derived from the TWIN (Time-Wavelength Interleaved Network) concept.

Three types of receivers are considered <b>including</b> <b>a</b> <b>PIN</b> photodiode with integrated semiconductor optical pre-amplifier (SOA-PIN), associated with pre-distortion mechanism. Depending on modulation format and receiver type, the maximum number of connected entities, N, (servers or racks) is limited either by the insertion losses or by the number of channels that can be packed into the band of the fast tunable POPI emitters.

50|$|The {{personal}} verification {{process begins}} with the user's supply of personal verification information. These information <b>include</b> <b>a</b> <b>PIN</b> and the provided customer's information which is recorded on the bank account. In cases {{where there is a}} storage of a cryptographic key on the bank card, it is called a Personal key (PK). Personal identification processes can be done by the Authentication Parameter (AP). It is capable of operating in two ways. The first option is where an AP can be time invariant. The second option is where an AP can be time variant. There is the case where there is an IP which is based on both time variant information and on the transaction request message. In such a case where an AP {{can be used as a}} message authentication code (MAC), the use of message authentication is made recourse to find out stale or bogus messages which might be routed both into the communication path and the detection of modified messages which are fraudulent and which can traverse non-secure communication systems. In such cases, the AP serves two purposes.|$|R
