5|$|In {{the course}} of the Six-Day War in June 1967, Israel {{captured}} the rest of Mandate Palestine from Jordan and Egypt, and began a policy of establishing <b>Jewish</b> <b>settlements</b> <b>in</b> those territories. From 1987 to 1993, the First Palestinian Intifada against Israel took place, which included the Declaration of the State of Palestine in 1988 and ended with the 1993 Oslo Peace Accords and the creation of the Palestinian National Authority.|$|E
5|$|During the Fourth Aliyah (1924â€“1928), the Jezreel Valley {{was the top}} {{priority}} of the Jewish National Fund (JNF). The JNF wanted to settle the valley {{in order to establish}} a significant Jewish agricultural community in the arable valley, and to create a contiguous bloc of <b>Jewish</b> <b>settlements</b> <b>in</b> the valley, connecting Haifa with the already existing bloc of Jewish settlements between Afula and Beit She'an. In 1924 the JNF bought some 30,175 dunams of land from Arab villages next to Nahalal {{in the western part of}} the valley. On this land, Sarid, Ramat David, Gvat, Kfar Baruch and Mishmar HaEmek were established.|$|E
5|$|Most Lithuanian Jews {{perished in}} the first phase during the first months of the {{occupation}} and before the end of 1941. The first recorded action of the Einsatzgruppen (Einsatzgruppe A) took place on June 22, 1941, in the border town of Gargzdai (called Gorzdt in Yiddish and Garsden in German), {{which was one of the}} oldest <b>Jewish</b> <b>settlements</b> <b>in</b> the country and only 18 kilometres (11mi) from German-annexed Memel. Approximately 800 Jews were shot that day in what is known as the Garsden Massacre. Approximately 100 non-Jewish Lithuanians were also executed, many for trying to aid their Jewish neighbors. About80,000 Jews were killed by October and about175,000 by the end of the year. The majority of Jews in Lithuania were not required to live in ghettos nor sent to the Nazi concentration camps which at that time were just in the preliminary stages of operation. Instead they were shot in pits near their places of residence with the most infamous mass murders taking place in the Ninth Fort near Kaunas and the Ponary Forest near Vilnius. By 1942 about 45,000Jews survived, largely those who had been sent to ghettos and camps. In the second phase, the Holocaust slowed, as Germans decided to use the Jews as forced labor to fuel the German war economy. In the third phase, the destruction of Jews was again given a high priority; it was in that phase that the remaining ghettos and camps were liquidated.|$|E

25|$|Having {{recruited}} a {{few thousand}} volunteers, al-Husayni organized the blockade of the 100,000 Jewish residents of Jerusalem. To counter this, the Yishuv authorities tried to supply the city with convoys of up to 100 armoured vehicles, but the operation {{became more and more}} impractical as the number of casualties in the relief convoys surged. By March, Al-Hussayni's tactic had paid off. Almost all of Haganah's armoured vehicles had been destroyed, the blockade was in full operation, and hundreds of Haganah members who had tried to bring supplies into the city were killed. The situation for those who dwelt in the <b>Jewish</b> <b>settlements</b> <b>in</b> the highly isolated Negev and North of Galilee was even more critical.|$|E
