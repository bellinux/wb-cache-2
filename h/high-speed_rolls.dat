40|$|Purpose: In {{the present}} study, {{effectiveness}} of a <b>high-speed</b> twin <b>roll</b> caster for recycling aluminum alloy was investigated. Design/methodology/approach: The effects of the <b>high-speed</b> twin <b>roll</b> caster on alleviating the deterioration of mechanical properties by impurities were investigated. Properties of the cast strip were investigated by metalography, a tension test, and a bending test. Findings: A vertical type twin roll caster for strip casting of aluminum alloys was devised. The strip, which was thinner than 3 mm, could be cast at speeds higher than 60 m/min. Features of the twin roll casters are as below. Copper rolls were used and lubricant was not used {{in order to increase}} the casting speed. A casting nozzle was used to set the solidification length precisely. Heat transfer between melt and the roll was improved by hydrostatic pressure of the melt. Separating force was very small in order to prevent sticking of the strip to the roll. Low superheat casting was carried out in order to improve microstructure of the strip. In the present study, {{effectiveness of a}} high-speed and high-cooling rate twin roll caster of the present study for recycling aluminum alloy was investigated. Fe was added as impurity to 6063 and A 356. The roll caster {{of the present study was}} useful to decrease the influence of impurity of Fe. Research limitations/implications: A <b>high-speed</b> twin <b>roll</b> caster of vertical type was designed and assembled to cast aluminum alloy thin strip. Originality/value: The results demonstrate that the <b>high-speed</b> twin <b>roll</b> caster can improve the deterioration by impurities...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{disadvantages}} {{of the conventional}} twin-roll caster for aluminum alloy are low casting speeds and limited choices of alloys that are castable by this processing. It is known that strip casting of aluminum alloy 5182 is very difficult because of their wider freezing zones. The vertical-type high-speed twin-roll caster {{used in the present}} study was devised to overcome these disadvantages. Features of the high speed twin roll casters are as below. Mild steel rolls were used in order to increase the casting speed and to be made at a lower equipment cost. Roll coating is produced in casting of Al-Mg alloy. Therefore lubricant, that resists heat transfer, was not {{used in the present study}}. Heat transfer between melt and the roll was improved by hydrostatic pressure of the melt. Low superheat casting was carried out in order to improve microstructure of the strip. In the present study, effectiveness of a <b>high-speed</b> twin <b>roll</b> caster for recycling aluminum alloy was investigated. The effects of the <b>high-speed</b> twin <b>roll</b> caster on alleviating the deterioration of mechanical properties by impurities were investigated. Properties of the cast strip were investigated by metalography, a tension test, and a deep drawing test...|$|R

40|$|The {{oxidation}} behaviour of a <b>high-speed</b> steel <b>roll</b> material {{has been investigated}} by a high temperature microscope in the temperatures ranging from 550 to 700 °C in both dry and humid atmospheres. In-situ observations indicate that the oxide scales of the high-speed steel first nucleate at the carbides/matrix interfaces, and then rapidly spread to cover the carbides and followed by continuous growth over the whole surface. Water vapour in oxidizing atmosphere significantly increases the oxidation rates of carbides and the matrix. With the increase in temperature, the roughness of oxidized surface becomes higher for both dry and humid atmospheres...|$|R

40|$|Recently, it {{has been}} {{required}} to improve the material properties of <b>high-speed</b> steel (HSS) <b>rolls,</b> because of the low wear resistance and low mechanical properties. To improve them, several new steels have been proposed, which have high wear resistance as well as excellent mechanical properties, e. g., hardness and tensile properties, where additional elements (V, Cr and W) were employed. However, their steels may have still technical issues, as the roll surfaces become roughened during the production process. The reason for this problem {{is found to be}} affected by the oxidation of the HSS surface. In this work, we have provided the suggestions to make high wear resistance of the HSS roll...|$|R
40|$|Extreme {{pressure}} (EP) additives form reasonable hard films by reacting {{with metal}} surfaces {{and are a}} good alternative to protect the surface of metals exposed to various types of wear. In this paper, the chemical reactions between <b>high-speed</b> steel (HSS) <b>roll</b> material and various EP agents, such as those containing sulfur, chlorine and zinc dialkyl dithio phosphate (ZDDP), were investigated by dropping EP solutions on the heated HSS samples. The research {{results show that the}} sulfur element from the sulfur EP solutions was found in the substrate and the carbides. However, the chromium element could not be detected in the sample, and the decomposition products of the ZDDP covered the sample. The scratch tests were carried out to demonstrate that the ZDDP is more resistant to scratching than other EP agents...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Development {{and use of}} {{high-speed}} steels for manufacturing the roll outer shell of hot strip mills represented a major recent technological advancement in the hot rolling field. However, {{it was observed that}} the oxidation behavior of these steels was different from that of conventional <b>rolls.</b> The <b>high-speed</b> steel oxidation rate is about four times higher than the alloys previously used. Furthermore, the rolling conditions are quite aggressive. Contact of the roll with the hot strip, air and water of the cooling system is expected to increase the oxidation of the roll surface in this wet atmosphere. Therefore, it is necessary to study their oxidation behavior in order to achieve the full potential of <b>high-speed</b> steel <b>rolls</b> for hot strip mills. In the present work, the oxidation behavior of three high-speed steels with differences in chromium content was studied. Corrosion tests were carried out in a thermobalance under dry and moist (12. 5 % H 2 O) atmospheres at 765 o C for 240 minutes. The corroded samples were examined by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive micro-analysis. It was found that the variation of chromium content of the high-speed steels studied was sufficient to influence the oxidation behaviour. Samples with high chromium contents presented smallest final mass gain. The presence of humidity had a significant effect on the oxidation behavior...|$|R
