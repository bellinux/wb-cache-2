5|$|Non-war related <b>free</b> <b>speech</b> <b>rights</b> {{were also}} {{advanced}} during the Vietnam war era; in 1969, the ACLU defended a Ku Klux Klan member who advocated long-term {{violence against the}} government, and the Supreme Court concurred with the ACLU's argument in the landmark decision Brandenburg v.

5|$|The Communist Party USA was {{routinely}} harassed and {{oppressed by}} government officials, leading {{it to be}} the primary client of the ACLU. The Communists were very aggressive in their tactics, often engaging in illegal or unethical conduct, and this led to frequent conflicts between the Communists and ACLU. Communist leaders often attacked the ACLU, particularly when the ACLU defended the <b>free</b> <b>speech</b> <b>rights</b> of conservatives. This uneasy relationship between the two groups continued for decades.|$|E

5|$|The ACLU {{was founded}} in 1920 by Helen Keller, Roger Baldwin, Crystal Eastman, Walter Nelles, Morris Ernst, Albert DeSilver, Arthur Garfield Hays, Jane Addams, Felix Frankfurter, and Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, and its focus was on freedom of speech, {{primarily}} for anti-war protesters. During the 1920s, the ACLU expanded its scope to include protecting the <b>free</b> <b>speech</b> <b>rights</b> of artists and striking workers, {{and working with the}} National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) to decrease racism and discrimination. During the 1930s, the ACLU started to engage in work combating police misconduct and supporting Native American rights. Many of the ACLU's cases involved the defense of Communist party members and Jehovah's Witnesses. In 1940, the ACLU leadership voted to exclude Communists from its leadership positions, a decision rescinded in 1968. During World War II, the ACLU defended Japanese-American citizens, unsuccessfully trying to prevent their forcible relocation to internment camps. During the Cold War, the ACLU headquarters was dominated by anti-Communists, but many local affiliates defended members of the Communist Party.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} legal {{scholars}} {{who support the}} outcome of the ruling nonetheless criticize the Supreme Court's approach to Beck's First Amendment challenge.

25|$|The {{positions}} of Women Against Pornography were controversial.

In addition to this, WAP faced conflict with sex-positive feminists, particularly in the events surrounding the 1982 Barnard Conference.

40|$|Through {{comparative}} analysis of United States, English, German and European Court of Human Rights jurisprudence, this article considers {{the viability of}} relying exclusively on either speaker or audience interests to underpin a <b>free</b> <b>speech</b> <b>right</b> {{within the context of}} anonymous and pseudonymous social media and online speech. It argues that this approach, which has hitherto been applied in these jurisdictions, can lead to a ‘double-edged sword’: on the one side, pursuant to audience interests, people may be dissuaded from participating in the exchange of information and ideas, because their anonymity or pseudonymity is not protected; on the other side, a constitutionally protected <b>right</b> to <b>free</b> <b>speech</b> based entirely on speaker interests could inadvertently protect unwanted and damaging speech...|$|R
25|$|The {{majority}} {{ruled that}} the Freedom of the Press clause of the First Amendment protects associations of individuals in addition to individual speakers, and further that the First Amendment does not allow prohibitions of speech based on {{the identity of the}} speaker. Corporations, as associations of individuals therefore, have <b>free</b> <b>speech</b> <b>rights</b> under the First Amendment. Because spending money is essential to disseminating speech, as established in Buckley v. Valeo, limiting a corporation's ability to spend money is unconstitutional because it limits the ability of its members to associate effectively and to speak on political issues.|$|E
25|$|Attempting to {{restrict}} the distribution over the Internet of gun plans has been likened to the futility of preventing the widespread distribution of DeCSS which enabled DVD ripping. After the US government had Defense Distributed take down the plans, they were still widely available via The Pirate Bay and other file sharing sites. Downloads of the plans from the UK, Germany, Spain, and Brazil were heavy. Some US legislators have proposed regulations on 3D printers, to prevent them being used for printing guns. 3D printing advocates have suggested that such regulations would be futile, could cripple the 3D printing industry, and could infringe on <b>free</b> <b>speech</b> <b>rights,</b> with early pioneer of 3D printing Professor Hod Lipson suggesting that gunpowder could be controlled instead.|$|E
25|$|An initial raid in July 1919 {{against an}} anarchist group in Buffalo, New York, {{achieved}} little when {{a federal judge}} tossed out Palmer's case. He found in {{the case that the}} three arrested radicals, charged under a law dating from the Civil War, had proposed transforming the government by using their <b>free</b> <b>speech</b> <b>rights</b> and not by violence. That taught Palmer that he needed to exploit the more powerful immigration statutes that authorized the deportation of alien anarchists, violent or not. To do that, he needed to enlist the cooperation of officials at the Department of Labor. Only the Secretary of Labor could issue warrants for the arrest of alien violators of the Immigrations Acts, and only he could sign deportation orders following a hearing by an immigration inspector.|$|E

5000|$|This holding was {{possible}} because California's constitution contains an affirmative <b>right</b> of <b>free</b> <b>speech</b> {{which has been}} liberally construed by the Supreme Court of California, while the federal constitution's First Amendment contains only a negative command to Congress to not abridge the freedom of speech. This distinction was significant because the U.S. Supreme Court had already held that under the federal First Amendment, there was no implied <b>right</b> of <b>free</b> <b>speech</b> within a private shopping center. [...] The Pruneyard case, therefore, {{raised the question of}} whether an implied <b>right</b> of <b>free</b> <b>speech</b> could arise under a state constitution without conflicting with the federal Constitution.
