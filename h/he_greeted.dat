5|$|After {{three years}} out of {{commission}} from 1903 to 1906, Yorktown hosted Secretary of the Navy Victor H. Metcalf on board when <b>he</b> <b>greeted</b> the Great White Fleet on its arrival in San Francisco in May 1907. Over the next five years, most of Yorktowns time was spent in sealing patrols in Alaska and duty in Latin American ports. From July 1912, Yorktown was out of commission for alterations, but resumed duties off the Mexican, Nicaraguan, and Honduran coasts beginning in April 1913. Through World War I, Yorktown continued in the same role, until she departed for the East Coast of the United States in April 1918. She served an escort for one convoy headed to Halifax in August, and remained in coastal escort duties in the east until January 1919. After arrival at San Diego in February, she was decommissioned for the final time in June 1919; she was sold in 1921 to an Oakland firm and broken up that same year.|$|E
5|$|Fearing Castro was a socialist, the U.S. {{instructed}} Cantillo to oust Batista. Cantillo secretly {{agreed to}} a ceasefire with Castro, promising that Batista would be tried as a war criminal; however, Batista was warned, and fled into exile with over US$300,000,000 on December 31, 1958. Cantillo entered Havana's Presidential Palace, proclaimed the Supreme Court judge Carlos Piedra to be President, and began appointing the new government. Furious, Castro ended the ceasefire, and ordered Cantillo's arrest by sympathetic figures in the army. Accompanying celebrations at news of Batista's downfall on January 1, 1959, Castro ordered the MR-26-7 to prevent widespread looting and vandalism. Cienfuegos and Guevara led their columns into Havana on January 2, while Castro entered Santiago and gave a speech invoking the wars of independence. Heading toward Havana, <b>he</b> <b>greeted</b> cheering crowds at every town, giving press conferences and interviews.|$|E
25|$|The {{marriage}} ceremony was celebrated {{with all due}} tradition in Esma Sultan Palace {{in the presence of}} Sultan's ministers in 1844. One week after that, she was ushered into Esma Sultan's silver-lined carriage in her pearl-trimmed red dress, tiara and bridal veil and sent off to the palace. In those days Sultan Abdülmecid still resided in Topkapı Palace, and <b>he</b> <b>greeted</b> his bride at the main entrance gate into the harem, wearing a splendid uniform with an aigrette plump atop his fez. He took her by the arm and escorted her into the Sovereign's Hall in the palace harem, having her take a seat in the nook that had been prepared for the bride. Mahmud II's daughters and wives came in and joined in the ceremony, as did the wives of important personages.|$|E

25|$|Odes 1–3 {{were the}} next focus for his artistic creativity. He adapted their forms and themes from Greek lyric {{poetry of the}} seventh and sixth centuries BC. The {{fragmented}} nature of the Greek world had enabled his literary heroes to express themselves freely and his semi-retirement from the Treasury in Rome to his own estate in the Sabine hills perhaps empowered him to some extent also yet even when his lyrics touched on public affairs they reinforced the importance of private life. Nevertheless, {{his work in the}} period 30–27 BC began to show his closeness to the regime and his sensitivity to its developing ideology. In Odes 1.2, for example, he eulogized Octavian in hyperboles that echo Hellenistic court poetry. The name Augustus, which Octavian assumed in January 27 BC, is first attested in Odes 3.3 and 3.5. In the period 27–24 BC, political allusions in the Odes concentrated on foreign wars in Britain (1.35), Arabia (1.29) Spain (3.8) and Parthia (2.2). <b>He</b> <b>greeted</b> Augustus on his return to Rome in 24 BC as a beloved ruler upon whose good health he depended for his own happiness (3.14).|$|E
25|$|Like the English and Irish country houses it {{was modeled}} on, the White House was, from the start, {{open to the}} public until {{the early part of the}} 20th century. President Thomas Jefferson held an open house for his second inaugural in 1805, and many of the people at his {{swearing-in}} ceremony at the Capitol followed him home, where <b>he</b> <b>greeted</b> them in the Blue Room. Those open houses sometimes became rowdy: in 1829, President Andrew Jackson had to leave for a hotel when roughly 20,000 citizens celebrated his inauguration inside the White House. His aides ultimately had to lure the mob outside with washtubs filled with a potent cocktail of orange juice and whiskey. Even so, the practice continued until 1885, when newly elected Grover Cleveland arranged for a presidential review of the troops from a grandstand in front of the White House instead of the traditional open house. Jefferson also permitted public tours of his house, which have continued ever since, except during wartime, and began the tradition of annual receptions on New Year's Day and on the Fourth of July. Those receptions ended in the early 1930s, although President Bill Clinton would briefly revive the New Year's Day open house in his first term.|$|E

500|$|Another main feud {{leading up}} to the event was between Ricky [...] "The Dragon" [...] Steamboat and the Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion [...] "Macho Man" [...] Randy Savage. The feud began during a title match between the two when Savage {{attacked}} Steamboat as <b>he</b> <b>greeted</b> fans at ringside. Savage then pushed Steamboat over the security rail and delivered an elbow shot that thrust Steamboat's throat into the rail and dropped the ring bell onto his throat from the top rope, injuring his larynx and sending him to the hospital. This resulted in a long, bitter feud that lasted for six months, included several bloody match-ups and finally culminated at WrestleMania. George [...] "The Animal" [...] Steele was in Steamboat's corner, having developed a crush on Savage's valet, Miss Elizabeth.|$|E
500|$|Both Compton and Groves {{proposed}} that DuPont operate the semiworks. Williams counter-{{proposed that}} the semiworks be {{operated by the}} Metallurgical Laboratory. He reasoned that it would primarily be a research and educational facility, and that expertise was to {{be found at the}} Metallurgical Laboratory. Compton was shocked; the Metallurgical Laboratory was part of the University of Chicago, and therefore the university [...] would be operating an industrial facility [...] from its main campus. James B. Conant told him that Harvard University [...] "wouldn't touch it with a ten-foot pole", but the University of Chicago's Vice President, Emery T. Filbey, took a different view, and instructed Compton to accept. When University President Robert Hutchins returned, <b>he</b> <b>greeted</b> Compton with [...] "I see, Arthur, that while I was gone you doubled the size of my university".|$|E
500|$|In early July 1778, the Prussian general Johann Jakob von Wunsch (1717–1788) {{crossed into}} Bohemia near the {{fortified}} town of Náchod with several hundred men. The local garrison, commanded by Friedrich Joseph, Freiherr (Baron) von Nauendorf, then a rittmeister (captain of cavalry), included only fifty hussars. Despite the poor numerical odds, Nauendorf sallied out to engage Wunsch's men. When his small force reached Wunsch's, <b>he</b> <b>greeted</b> the Prussians as friends; {{by the time}} the Prussians were close enough to realize the allegiance of the hussars, Nauendorf and his small band had acquired the upper hand. Wunsch withdrew; the next day, Nauendorf was promoted to major.

500|$|On 1 May 1994, Ayrton Senna {{was killed}} during the San Marino Grand Prix. Prost was a pallbearer at the Brazilian's funeral. Speaking {{four years after the}} Brazilian's death, Prost told Nigel Roebuck that he had [...] "always refused to speak about him". When Senna died, Prost stated that [...] "a part of himself had died also", because their careers had been so bound together. Senna had also felt the same when Prost had retired at the end of 1993, when he {{admitted}} to a close friend that he had realised how much of his motivation had come from fighting with Prost. Only {{a couple of days before}} his death, when filming an in-car lap of Imola for French television channel TF1, <b>he</b> <b>greeted</b> Prost, by then a pundit on the channel: [...] "A special hello to my,... to our dear friend Alain.

500|$|In 1527, the Medici were overthrown in Florence by a faction {{opposed to}} the regime of Clement's representative, Cardinal Silvio Passerini, and Catherine was taken hostage {{and placed in a}} series of convents. The final one, the Santissima Annuziata delle Murate was her home for three years. Mark Strage {{described}} these years as [...] "the happiest of her entire life". Clement {{had no choice but to}} crown Charles Holy Roman Emperor in return for his help in retaking the city. In October 1529, Charles's troops laid siege to Florence. As the siege dragged on, voices called for Catherine to be killed and exposed naked and chained to the city walls. Some even suggested that she be handed over to the troops to be used for their sexual gratification. The city finally surrendered on 12 August 1530. Clement summoned Catherine from her beloved convent to join him in Rome where <b>he</b> <b>greeted</b> her with open arms and tears in his eyes. Then he set about the business of finding her a husband.|$|E
500|$|After some discussion, {{the local}} bishops {{stated that they}} needed to consult with their own people before agreeing to Augustine's requests, and left the meeting. Bede relates that a group of native bishops {{consulted}} an old hermit who said they should obey Augustine if, when they next met with him, Augustine rose when <b>he</b> <b>greeted</b> the natives. But if Augustine failed to stand up when they arrived for the second meeting, they should not submit. When Augustine failed to rise to greet the second delegation of British bishops at the next meeting, Bede says the native bishops refused to submit to Augustine. Bede then has Augustine proclaim a prophecy that because of lack of missionary effort towards the Anglo-Saxons from the British church, the native church [...] would suffer {{at the hands of the}} Anglo-Saxons. This prophecy was seen as fulfilled when Æthelfrith of Northumbria supposedly killed 1200 native monks at the Battle of Chester. Bede uses the story of Augustine's two meetings with two groups of British bishops as an example of how the native clergy refused to cooperate with the Gregorian mission. Later, Aldhelm, the abbot of Malmesbury, writing in the later part of the 7th century, claimed that the native clerks would not eat with the missionaries, nor would they perform Christian ceremonies with them. Laurence, Augustine's successor, [...] writing to the Irish bishops during his tenure of Canterbury, also stated that an Irish bishop, Dagan, would not share meals with the missionaries.|$|E
