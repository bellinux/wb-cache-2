5|$|Apart {{from these}} three armies the Wehrmacht also {{designed}} two special units {{to aid the}} offensive. One of these was a battalion-sized airborne formation tasked with dropping behind American lines during {{the first day of}} the offensive, allowing a panzer division from the Sixth Panzer Army easy access across the Meuse. The second unit was a panzer brigade, intending to <b>go</b> <b>behind</b> enemy lines dressed in American uniforms to give false orders and spread confusion among American defenders in the Ardennes. Also earmarked for the offensive were around 800 aircraft, deployed by the Luftwaffe (German Air Force), to provide air support to German forces and destroy much of the Allied air power on the ground.|$|E

5|$|During {{his time}} at Michigan, Walker was paid by the White Sewing Machine Company of Cleveland to play for their semi-professional ball club in August 1881. Walker's {{presence}} was controversial when the team arrived for a game in Louisville, Kentucky, {{the first place to}} have a major issue with his race. As the team arrived in the early morning of the game, Walker was turned away from the Saint Cloud Hotel. More issues arose during game time: members of the Louisville Eclipse protested Walker's participation; Cleveland relented and held him out of the lineup. After one inning, his substitute claimed his hands were too badly bruised to continue, and Walker hesitantly walked on to the field for warm-ups. Louisville again protested and refused to resume play until Cleveland's third baseman volunteered to <b>go</b> <b>behind</b> the plate.|$|E
5|$|The Bessy comics {{were also}} {{published}} in Felix, a German comic magazine by Bastei Verlag. From 1965 on, {{they wanted to}} publish a complete new story every month, a rhythm they increased to twice a month in 1966. Unable to produce so fast, Vandersteen had to expand his Studio considerably. Led by Karel Verschuere, a team of some ten young artists mass-produced the comics, which were of considerable lower quality. The {{most important of these}} artists were Frank Sels and Edgar Gastmans, while many stories were produced by Daniël Janssens. When in late 1967 Verschuere quit, {{and at the same time}} Bastei increased the rhythm again, now to one complete comic a week, the Studio was disbanded and Sels and Gastmans started to work on a free lance basis. The next year, they decided to <b>go</b> <b>behind</b> Vandersteen's back and to sell directly to the Germans. Vandersteen then had to reorganize the Bessy Studio and hired Jeff Broeckx. The Studio continued until 1985, with artists like Patrick van Lierde, Ronald Van Riet, Eugeen Goossens, and Walter Laureyssens. It produced more than 900 Bessy-comics.|$|E

25|$|Colonel Welborn Barton Griffith, Jr. {{questioned}} {{the strategy of}} destroying the cathedral and volunteered to <b>go</b> <b>behind</b> enemy lines {{to find out whether}} the German Army was occupying the cathedral and using it as an observation post. With a single enlisted soldier to assist, Griffith proceeded to the cathedral and confirmed that the Germans were not using it. After he returned from his reconnaissance, he reported that the cathedral was clear of enemy troops. The order to destroy the cathedral was withdrawn, and the Allies later liberated the area. Griffith was killed in action later that day on 16 August 1944, in the town of Leves, near Chartres.|$|E
25|$|Any {{police officer}} may, without warrant, arrest and detain pending {{enquiries}} any person {{in respect of}} whom he has reason to believe there are grounds which would justify the person's detention. In the 1960 case of Re Ong Yew Teck, the High Court held that since a police officer ordering an arrest {{is not required to}} disclose facts which he considers to be against the public interest to disclose, it is futile for a court to objectively decide whether there are grounds justifying detention. Therefore, a subjective test is to be applied – if the police officer honestly supposes he has reason to believe the required element, the court cannot <b>go</b> <b>behind</b> the officer's statement. However, Ong Yew Teck may no longer be good law in view of the Court of Appeal's more recent decision in Kamal Jit Singh (above).|$|E

25|$|In February, Natural Disasters' manager Jimmy Hart led Money Inc. (Ted DiBiase & Irwin R. Schyster) to the WWF tag team titles as they {{defeated}} the Legion of Doom {{after which the}} L.O.D. briefly left the WWF. The Natural Disasters were outraged that their manager would <b>go</b> <b>behind</b> their backs and get another team {{a shot at the}} title, the storyline explanation was that Jimmy Hart used the Disasters' guaranteed return match for Money Inc. When the Natural Disasters challenged Money Inc. they won the fan support as they fired manager Jimmy Hart. The Disasters would first get their hands on Money Inc. at WrestleMania VIII where once again the Natural Disasters would win the match but not the titles as the champions were counted out. The Disasters did not let the setback stop them as they challenged for the titles repeatedly until they won them on July 20, 1992.|$|E
500|$|Regular showings of {{the pieces}} {{collected}} by Wilson, Reilly, and Jackson (and those donated by others), became too much for Reilly and Jackson's small home in West Roxbury, Massachusetts, as hundreds of people attended the receptions.

Following the end of the war, Carter is working in a secretarial role despite her status as an agent. Approached by Howard Stark, whom she had also worked with during the war, to help clear his name after being framed for selling weapons to the USSR, Carter agrees to <b>go</b> <b>behind</b> the backs of her superiors. Her treason is eventually discovered by Agent Daniel Sousa, but she is let off when she helps stop the Russians.

500|$|Stewart {{declared}} the team's first-choice white-and-blue outfit [...] "lucky" [...] {{on the basis}} that both Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match. According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the Herald newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to <b>go</b> <b>behind</b> after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance. Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's Brigitte Kindler equalised two minutes later from a penalty stroke, flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper Sarah English into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, Brenda Phillips replaced Christine Prinsloo at right-half.|$|E

500|$|The {{failure of}} the Continental Army to hold New York also brought about a rise in Loyalist activity, as the city became a haven for refugee {{supporters}} of the Crown, from elsewhere, across the region. [...] The British actively recruited in New York and New Jersey to build regiments of provincial militia, with some success. [...] Loyalists in these areas may have been motivated by seeing elements of the rebel army head home after their enlistments ended. [...] One New York Patriot militia leader wrote that thirty of his men, rather than reenlisting with him, had instead signed up with the enemy. [...] On November 30 Admiral Howe offered amnesty to anyone that had taken up arms against the Crown, provided they swore an oath to it. [...] Washington responded with his own proclamation suggesting that {{those who did not}} renounce such oaths should immediately <b>go</b> <b>behind</b> British lines. [...] As a result, New Jersey became a civil battlefield, with militia activity as well as spying and counterspying continuing {{for the rest of the}} war.|$|E
500|$|The New Zealanders {{travelled}} to New York City, {{where they}} played an exhibition game, {{then on to}} San Francisco. There they played two official matches against British Columbia, and won both easily. The tour programme thus ended; New Zealand had played 35 games and lost only once. Gallaher had played in 26 of those matches, including four Tests. Over their 32 matches in the British Isles New Zealand scored 830 points and conceded 39; overall they scored 976 points and conceded only 59. On their arrival back in New Zealand on 6March 1906, the All Blacks were welcomed by a crowd of 10,000 before being hosted at a civic reception in Auckland. Invited {{to speak at the}} reception, Gallaher said: [...] "We did not <b>go</b> <b>behind</b> our back to talk about the Welshman, but candidly said that on that day the better team had won. I have one recommendation to make to the New Zealand [...] Union, if it was to undertake such a tour again, and that is to play the Welsh matches first." ...|$|E
500|$|Early breaker Denifl {{was alone}} in front and had about two minutes of an {{advantage}} with [...] to <b>go.</b> <b>Behind,</b> Domenico Pozzovivo placed an acceleration that put the lead group in difficulty, but he was brought back. The time gap rapidly decreased, due to dubious time monitoring again. Pinot launched an attack from the group, but Špilak had the resources {{to keep up with}} him for a while but was ultimately dropped. Pinot passed the passive Denifl before the arch signaling the last kilometer (flamme rouge) and took a solo victory. Pozzovivo finished second while Špilak settled for third. However, it became soon apparent that Dumoulin would not lose much more than the minute and a half that was his objective. He passed the line 1' 37" [...] down on Pinot. [...] "I'm very happy, it was important for me and the team. We came here to win a stage, and I had good legs today. I've got a lot of confidence now, that’s important for the Tour de France. And it's true, racing in Switzerland seems to suit me," [...] said Pinot. [...] "The objective is to win overall here, but the rouleurs like [...] Thomas and [...] Dumoulin aren't far back," [...] he added. [...] "It'll be a long and difficult time trial [...] We'll see what happens on the day." ...|$|E
