5|$|Defining {{the top end}} of a clarinet's {{range is}} difficult, since many {{advanced}} players can produce notes well above the highest notes commonly found in method books. G6 is usually the highest note clarinetists encounter in classical repertoire. The C above that (C7 i.e. resting on the fifth ledger line above the treble staff) is attainable by advanced players and is shown on many <b>fingering</b> charts, and fingerings as high as A7 exist.|$|E
5|$|For guitars {{with six}} strings, every major-third tuning repeats its three open-notes in two octaves, so {{providing}} many options for <b>fingering</b> chords. By repeating open-string notes and by having uniform intervals between strings, major-thirds tuning simplifies learning by beginners. These features also facilitate advanced guitarists' improvisation, precisely {{the aim of}} jazz guitarist RalphPatt when he began popularizing major-thirds tuning between 1963 and 1964.|$|E
5|$|Narayan {{increased}} {{the status of}} the sarangi to that of a modern concert solo instrument, made it known outside of India, and was the first sarangi player with international success, an example later followed by Sultan Khan. Narayan's simplified <b>fingering</b> technique allows for glide (meend) and affected the modern sarangi concert style, as aspects of his playing and tone creation were taken up by sarangi players from Narayan's recordings.|$|E

40|$|The {{variability}} in the numerous tasks in which we use our hands is very large. However, independent movement control of individual <b>fingers</b> is limited. To assess the extent of <b>finger</b> independency during full-range <b>finger</b> flexion including all <b>finger</b> joints, we studied enslaving (movement in non-instructed <b>fingers)</b> and range of independent <b>finger</b> movement through the whole <b>finger</b> flexion trajectory in single and multi-finger movement tasks. Thirteen young healthy subjects performed single- and multi-finger movement tasks under two conditions: active flexion through {{the full range of}} movement with all <b>fingers</b> free to move and active flexion while the non-instructed <b>finger(s)</b> were restrained. <b>Finger</b> kinematics were measured using inertial sensors (PowerGlove), to assess enslaving and range of independent <b>finger</b> movement. Although all <b>fingers</b> showed enslaving movement to some extent, highest enslaving was found in adjacent <b>fingers.</b> Enslaving effects in ring and little <b>finger</b> were increased with movement of additional, non-adjacent <b>fingers.</b> The middle <b>finger</b> was the only <b>finger</b> affected by restriction in movement of non-instructed <b>fingers.</b> Each <b>finger</b> showed a range of independent movement before the non-instructed <b>fingers</b> started to move, which was largest for the index <b>finger.</b> The start of enslaving was asymmetrical for adjacent <b>fingers.</b> Little <b>finger</b> enslaving movement was affected by multi-finger movement. We conclude that no <b>finger</b> can move independently through the full range of <b>finger</b> flexion, although some degree of full independence is present for smaller movements. This range of independent movement is asymmetric and variable between <b>fingers</b> and between subjects. The presented results provide insight into the role of <b>finger</b> independency for different types of tasks and populations...|$|R
5|$|Only two {{or three}} frets are needed for the guitarchords—major, minor, and {{dominant}} sevenths—which are emphasized in introductions to guitar-playing and to the fundamentals of music. Each major and minor chord can be played on two successive frets on three successive strings, and therefore each needs only two fingers. Other chords—seconds, fourths, sevenths, and ninths—are played on only three successive frets. For fundamental-chord fingerings, major-thirds tuning's simplicity and consistency are not shared by standard tuning, whose seventh-chord <b>fingering</b> is discussed {{at the end of}} this section.|$|E
5|$|Ram Narayan {{was born}} on 25 December 1927 in Amber village, near Udaipur in northwestern India. His great-great-grandfather, Bagaji Biyavat, was a singer from Amber, and he and Narayan's great-grandfather, Sagad Danji Biyavat, sang at the court of the Maharana of Udaipur. Narayan's grandfather, Har Lalji Biyavat, and father, Nathuji Biyavat, were farmers and singers, Nathuji played the bowed {{instrument}} dilruba, and Narayan's mother was a music lover. Narayan's first language was Rajasthani and he learned Hindi and, later, English. At an age of about six, he found a small sarangi left by the family's Ganga guru, a genealogist, and was taught a <b>fingering</b> technique developed by his father. Narayan's father taught him, but {{was worried about the}} difficulty of playing the sarangi and its association with courtesan music, which gave the instrument a low social status. After a year, Biyavat sought lessons for his son from sarangi player Mehboob Khan of Jaipur, but changed his mind when Khan told him Narayan would have to change his <b>fingering</b> technique. Narayan's father later encouraged him to leave school and devote himself to playing the sarangi.|$|E

5|$|The clarinet's {{place in}} the jazz {{ensemble}} was usurped by the saxophone, which projects a more powerful sound and uses a less complicated <b>fingering</b> system. The requirement for an increased speed of execution in modern jazz also did not favour the clarinet, but the clarinet did not entirely disappear. A few players such as Buddy DeFranco, Tony Scott, and Jimmy Giuffre emerged during the 1950s playing bebop or other styles. A little later, Eric Dolphy (on bass clarinet), Perry Robinson, John Carter, Theo Jörgensmann, and others used the clarinet in free jazz. The French composer and clarinetist Jean-Christian Michel initiated a jazz-classical cross-over on the clarinet with the drummer Kenny Clarke.|$|E
5|$|Anisotropy {{of liquid}} {{crystals}} is a property not observed in other fluids. This anisotropy makes flows of liquid crystals behave more differentially {{than those of}} ordinary fluids. For example, injection of a flux of a liquid crystal between two close parallel plates (viscous <b>fingering)</b> causes orientation of the molecules to couple with the flow, with the resulting emergence of dendritic patterns. This anisotropy is also manifested in the interfacial energy (surface tension) between different liquid crystal phases. This anisotropy determines the equilibrium shape at the coexistence temperature, and {{is so strong that}} usually facets appear. When temperature is changed one of the phases grows, forming different morphologies depending on the temperature change. Since growth is controlled by heat diffusion, anisotropy in thermal conductivity favors growth in specific directions, which has also an effect on the final shape.|$|E
5|$|In April 2015, Activision {{announced}} a new entry in the series, titled Guitar Hero Live. The title was developed by Activision's internal studio FreeStyleGames, who previously had worked on the DJ Hero spinoff titles. FreeStyleGames were given free rein to reboot the Guitar Hero series for next-generation consoles. One of their first innovations was to drop the standard five-button guitar controller, ultimately designing a six-button guitar controller, with two rows of three buttons each, allowing them to mimic actual guitar <b>fingering.</b> Guitar Hero Live was released with both a career and an online mode. The career mode used full-motion video taken {{from the perspective of}} a lead guitarist underneath the note highway, to create an immersive experience to the player. The online mode, called GHTV, discarded the previous downloadable content approach and used a music video channel approach to stream playable songs to players, adding new songs to the catalog on a weekly basis. The game was released in October 2015.|$|E

5|$|The final {{development}} in the modern design of the clarinet used {{in most of the}} world today was introduced by Hyacinthe Klosé in 1839. He devised a different arrangement of keys and finger holes, which allow simpler <b>fingering.</b> It was inspired by the Boehm system developed for flutes by Theobald Boehm. Klosé was so impressed by Boehm's invention that he named his own system for clarinets the Boehm system, although it is different from the one used on flutes. This new system was slow to gain popularity but gradually became the standard, and today the Boehm system is used everywhere in the world except Germany and Austria. These countries still use a direct descendant of the Mueller clarinet known as the Oehler system clarinet. Also, some contemporary Dixieland players continue to use Albert system clarinets.|$|E
5|$|The {{title is}} {{considered}} a reboot of the series; instead of using a five-button guitar-shaped game controller, the game shipped with a six-button controller, arranged in two rows of three aimed to provide more realistic <b>fingering</b> positions than the five-button controller. The game includes 42 songs on the game's disc, presented in sets using full motion video taken from the first-person perspective of the lead guitarist as the background visuals to create an immersive experience. Guitar Hero Live does not use traditional downloadable content to expand the game and is not backward compatible with previous songs from Guitar Hero games. Instead, the game includes the online Guitar Hero TV (GHTV) mode modeled after music video channels that players can jump {{in or out of}} at any time, playing through ongoing songs in a curated fashion. GHTV, through in-game rewards and microtransactions, supports the ability to play any song in the library, perform Premium shows where the newest tracks to GHTV will be found, or even unlock all features for a 24-hour period as part of a Party Pass. Two hundred songs were available at the release of the game, with more added over time, averaging about six new songs each week.|$|E
25|$|With six strings, major-thirds tuning has {{a smaller}} range than {{standard}} tuning; with seven strings, the major-thirds tuning covers {{the range of}} standard tuning on six strings. With the repetition of three open-string notes, each major-thirds tuning provides the guitarist with many options for <b>fingering</b> chords. Indeed, the <b>fingering</b> of two successive frets suffices to play pure major and minor chords, while the <b>fingering</b> of three successive frets suffices to play seconds, fourths, sevenths, and ninths.|$|E
50|$|Some {{scissors}} have an appendage, {{called a}} <b>finger</b> brace or <b>finger</b> tang, below the index <b>finger</b> hole {{for the middle}} <b>finger</b> to rest on to provide for better control and more power in precision cutting. A <b>finger</b> tang {{can be found on}} many quality scissors (including inexpensive ones) and especially on scissors for cutting hair (see hair scissors pictured below). In hair cutting, some claim the ring <b>finger</b> is inserted where some place their index <b>finger,</b> and the little <b>finger</b> rests on the <b>finger</b> tang.|$|R
5000|$|The index <b>finger</b> (also {{referred}} to as forefinger, first <b>finger,</b> pointer <b>finger,</b> trigger <b>finger,</b> digitus secundus, digitus II, and [...] ), is the first <b>finger</b> and the second digit of a human hand.

For example, to figure 9 × 4, count four <b>fingers</b> from the left, ending at your left-hand ring <b>finger.</b> Bend this <b>finger</b> down and count the remaining <b>fingers.</b> <b>Fingers</b> {{to the left of}} the bent <b>finger</b> represent tens, <b>fingers</b> to the right are ones. There are three <b>fingers</b> to the left and six to the right, which indicates 9 × 4 = 36. This works for 9 × 1 up through 9 × 10.|$|R

It is made from a single bamboo section. According to Arts and Crafts of Hawai`i by Te Rangi Hiroa, old flutes in the Bishop Museum collection have a hole at the node area for the breath, {{and two or three}} <b>fingering</b> holes. In the three-finger-hole specimen, one <b>fingering</b> hole is placed near the breath hole. Lengths range from 10–21 inches (250–530mm). Oral tradition in various families states that numbers of <b>fingering</b> holes ranged from one to four, and location of the holes varied depending on the musical taste of the player.|$|E
25|$|Various other notes (relatively flat or sharp {{with respect}} {{to those of the}} major scale) can be {{accessed}} by cross <b>fingering</b> techniques, and all the notes (except the lowest of each octave/register) can be flattened by half holing. Perhaps the most effective and most used cross <b>fingering</b> is that which produces a flattened form of the seventh note (B flat instead of B on a C whistle, for example, or C natural instead of C sharp on a D whistle). This makes available another major scale (F on a C whistle, G on a D whistle).|$|E

Heterosexual couples may engage in cunnilingus or <b>fingering</b> as forms of foreplay to incite sexual arousal, with penile-vaginal penetration as the primary sexual activity, or they may engage in them in {{addition to}} penile-vaginal penetration; in other cases, heterosexual couples use the latter acts as a way to preserve virginity or as a type of birth control. By contrast, lesbians and other women who have sex with women commonly engage in cunnilingus or <b>fingering</b> as main forms of sexual activity. Some women and couples use sex toys, such as a vibrator or dildo, for vaginal pleasure. Other women may adopt Kegel exercises, with the aim of tightening the vagina to increase sexual pleasure. The Kama Sutra, an ancient Hindu text written by Vātsyāyana, which includes a number of sexual positions, may also be used to increase sexual pleasure, with special emphasis on female sexual satisfaction.|$|E
