A revival of external and <b>domestic</b> <b>demand</b> {{has led to a}} strong recovery, as cost decreases strengthened the competitiveness of Hong Kong exports and a long deflationary period ended.

5|$|According to Nurkse, {{underdeveloped}} countries lack adequate {{purchasing power}}. Low purchasing power {{means that the}} real income of the people is low, although in monetary terms it may be high. If the money income were low, the problem could easily be overcome by expanding the money supply; however, since the meaning {{in this context is}} real income, expanding the supply of money will only generate inflationary pressure. Neither real output nor real investment will rise. It is to be noted that a low purchasing power means that <b>domestic</b> <b>demand</b> for commodities is low. Apart from encompassing consumer goods and services, this includes the demand for capital as well.|$|E
5|$|Perón's second Five-Year Plan in 1952 favoured {{increased}} agricultural output over industrialization, but {{industrial growth}} and high wages {{in previous years}} had expanded the <b>domestic</b> <b>demand</b> for agrarian goods. During the 1950s, output of beef and grain fell, and the economy suffered. The policy shift toward agricultural production created a gap in income distribution, as {{the majority of those}} who worked in agriculture laboured on tiny plots, while the majority of the land was in large estates. Argentina signed trade agreements with Britain, the Soviet Union and Chile, slightly opening the market to international trade as Perón's second economic plan sought to capitalize on the country's comparative advantage in agriculture.|$|E

25|$|Unlike the {{economic}} booms of the 1960s and 1970s, when increasing exports played the {{key role in}} economic expansion, <b>domestic</b> <b>demand</b> propelled the Japanese economy in the late 1980s. This development involved fundamental economic restructuring, moving from dependence on exports to reliance on <b>domestic</b> <b>demand.</b> The boom that started in 1986 was generated by the decisions of companies to increase private plant and equipment spending and of consumers {{to go on a}} buying spree. Japan's imports grew at a faster rate than exports. Japanese post-war technological research was carried out for the sake of economic growth rather than military development. The growth in high-technology industries in the 1980s resulted from heightened <b>domestic</b> <b>demand</b> for high-technology products such as electronics, and for higher living, housing, and environmental standards; better medical care and more welfare; expanded leisure-time facilities; and improved ways to accommodate a rapidly aging society.|$|E

40|$|Large {{shifts in}} <b>domestic</b> beef <b>demand</b> have had {{substantial}} {{impacts on the}} beef industry. Before the late 1970 s, growth in the U.

However, starting about 1980, <b>domestic</b> retail beef <b>demand</b> weakened and subsequently declined every year through 1998.

To explore the time series nature of the data, we use innovation state space models to forecast the <b>domestic</b> tourism <b>demand.</b> Combining these two frameworks, we build innovation state space models with exogenous variables. These models are able to capture the time series dynamics in the data, as well as economic and other relationships. We show that these models outperform alternative approaches for short-term forecasting and also produce sensible long-term forecasts. The forecasts are compared with the official Australian government forecasts, which are found to be more optimistic than our forecasts.

We make use of primary data collected in Katarko, a rural village in northeastern Nigeria. Through regression models for the dry and rainy seasons we demonstrate that beyond sociocultural and demographic factors, economic ones are also significant in determining <b>domestic</b> water <b>demand.</b> These findings underscore not only the importance of demand-side management in water-related projects, but also the need to incorporate economic principles in them. Making use of the identified determinants into water-demand projections further reveals how changes in these variables can affect future demand. ...|$|R
