40|$|Many factors affect forage quality, {{including}} {{moisture level}} at baling, compaction, bulk density, and maturity at harvest. Losses of dry matter and nutrient value occur during <b>field</b> <b>curing.</b> <b>Hay</b> baled {{at or above}} 18 % moisture should have less nutrient loss in the <b>field.</b> However, <b>hay</b> baled at these moisture levels {{has the potential to}} heat during storage, causing dry matter loss and nutrient degradation. Also, as particle length of forage decreases, packing ability of forage and bulk density of bales increase. Although particle length is reduced by grinding baled forage, this can result in nutrient losses. Also, when cattle are fed free choice in a ring feeder, precutting forage may help reduce waste because the smaller particles fall within the ring and are not pulled out by the animals and lost on the ground. Objectives of these experiments were to compare the effects of precutting alfalfa during round baling and conventional baling on heifer performance, forage wastage, and eating preference...|$|R

The results from the macro-remains are compared to vegetation relevés from the <b>hay</b> <b>field.</b> The pollen analysis is compared to both the <b>hay</b> <b>field</b> and the surrounding vegetation. Results from the plant macro remains provide an excellent representation of the vegetation in the field itself on the presence/absence level.

40|$|A {{method was}} devised for {{estimating}} vitamin D in roughages. After boiling with 10 % alcoholic KOH {{the material was}} extracted with petroleum ether, and purified by chromatography through an activated alumina column with petroleum ether. Chromatography removed an unsaponifiable factor antagonistic to vitamin D. The eluate was assayed by the curative X-ray method against a vitamin D standard with white rats. No vitamin D could be detected in ensiled turnips. Average contents in roughages under Dutch conditions were: grass silage and artificially dried grass about 300 IU, <b>hay</b> <b>cured</b> in windrows and cocks 1000 IU, frame-dried hay 575 IU and straw possibly as windrow hay. Considering the usual rations and the great variation in vitamin D in hays the intake of the vitamin might not be adequate on all farms. Although identification of the antagonistic factor was not possible a relation appeared. to exist between the factor and carotene. Synthetic carotene and vitamin A palmitate 100 - 800 IU daily showed in rats a weak antagonism of a competitive nature.

40|$|Plant growth {{regulators}} were aerially applied on April 26, 1996, to two alfalfa fields, one (Cibola) in {{its first}} year of production and the other field (CUF 101) in its third year. The first year field was approximately 50 % through the cutting cycle and the third year field was approximately 30 % through the cutting cycle when applications were made. No statistical differences were noted in hay tonnage the first cutting after application. Yield increases due to treatments were noted in the second cutting and maximum increases ranged from 277 - 461 lbs of hay per acre. No yield or quality differences were noted the third cutting after application. The two fields differed in their response. The lowest rates of plant growth regulators produced higher yields in the first year field, but these treatment rates had greatly lowered hay quality the previous cutting. These effects were not noticed in the third year stand <b>field.</b> Increased <b>hay</b> tonnage was noted in the third year field from the 16 oz/acre rates, but was not evident in the first year <b>field.</b> <b>Hay</b> quality was usually highest in the check the first two cuttings after treatment.

40|$|Within {{recent years}} the nodding thistle or musk thistle (Carduus nutans L.) has be-come {{naturalized}} and abundant in northwestern Ohio {{in at least two}} areas, the Castalia-Bellevue-Sandusky area and the Carey area. In the summers of 1967 and 1968, the total detailed distribution of Carduus nutans in these two areas was mapped by noting its occur-rence and abundance in relation to the general geologic conditions, topographic features, and habitats. The thistle was most abundant in moderately grazed pasture <b>fields,</b> <b>hay</b> <b>fields,</b> and along grassy roadsides on high, dry ridges and hillsides where the limestone or dolomite bedrock was less than six feet below the surface. Plants were rare or infre-quent where the bedrock was deeper, in flatter terrain, in cultivated fields, and along railroad tracks.
