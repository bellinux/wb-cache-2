The set of canonical conflict of <b>interest</b> <b>policies</b> can be modelled by a subset of P(P(X)), A(P(X)).

A series of experiments has 8 participants trade an asset over 15 periods. Alternatively, the participants can invest money in interest-bearing bonds.

40|$|In many organizations, {{there are}} {{numerous}} business processes that involve sensitive tasks that may encourage corruption. Conflict of <b>interest</b> <b>policies</b> are defined in an organization to deter corruption before it can happen. Existing research generally focuses on separation of duties, yet lacks attention for the underpinning conflicts of interest. Moreover, separation of duty is only one particular kind of conflicts of interest. Other kinds do exist and must be resolved as well. In this paper a novel approach is proposed to define conflict of <b>interest</b> <b>policies</b> and to facilitate their enforcement. Our work provides an expressive mechanism {{that can be applied}} {{for a wide range of}} conflicts of interest that go beyond separation of duty policies. Furthermore, we show how policies can be enforced in the context of the role-oriented access control model (ROAC), which we extend to provide a stronger basis for the enforcement of conflict of <b>interest</b> <b>policies.</b> status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Our aim in {{this study}} was to examine the {{competing}} <b>interest</b> <b>policies</b> and procedures of organisations who develop and maintain patient decision aids. DESIGN: Descriptive and thematic analysis of data collected from a cross-sectional survey of patient decision aid developer's competing <b>interest</b> <b>policies</b> and disclosure forms. RESULTS: We contacted 25 organisations likely to meet the inclusion criteria. 12 eligible organisations provided data. 11 organisations did not reply and 2 declined to participate. Most patient decision aid developers recognise the need to consider the issue of competing interests. Assessment processes vary widely and, for the most part, are insufficiently robust to minimise the risk of competing interests. Only half of the 12 organisations had competing <b>interest</b> <b>policies.</b> Some considered disclosure to be sufficient, while others imposed differing levels of exclusion. CONCLUSIONS: Patient decision aid developers do not have a consistent approach to managing competing interests. Some have developed policies and procedures, while others pay no attention to the issue. As is the case for clinical practice guidelines, increasing attention will need to be given to how the competing interests of contributors of evidence-based publications may influence materials, especially if they are designed for patient use...|$|R
40|$|Surrogacy and {{adoption}} are widespread practices for childless parents. Surrogacy {{and adoption}} laws vary widely from State to State. As to surrogacy, some States require genetic parents {{to obtain a}} jurisdictional order to have their names on the original birth certificate, without {{the name of the}} surrogate mother. Other States (e. g. Ukraine) allow putting the name of the intended parents on the birth certificate. In Italy all forms of surrogacy are forbidden, whether it be traditional or gestational, commercial or altruistic. Other penal consequences are provided by the Criminal Code about the registration of a birth certificate where parents are the intended ones, as provided by the lex loci actus. The right to adopt is not generally recognized in different legal systems. In Italy it is denied to same – sex couples, as only married couples can adopt, as stated by the Italian rules. So, surrogacy and adoption abroad arise several problems concerning filiation, developing a complex case law, characterized by the difficulty to find a justification for not recognizing the status filiationis performed abroad. The focus of this case law lies in the scope of the public <b>policy</b> <b>clause,</b> invoked against the legal effects of acts or foreign judgments concerning surrogacy and adoption. Following the case law of the ECtHR, which defends individual rights beyond the authority of the law, many judgments recently made clear that the involvment of the public policy exception against foreign decision and act recognitions concerning the filiation or the adoption of the child should be proportionate and interpreted through the child’s best interest, that should be interpreted as a basic value of the public <b>policy</b> <b>clause...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{whether the}} IMF high <b>interest</b> rate <b>policy</b> was suitable for crisis-ridden East Asian economies. Using an "overshoot" model {{similar to that}} of Dornbusch's (1976), it shows that this sort of policy might cause an unnecessary deflationary adjusting process and have no effect on containing the real depreciation of exchange rates in the long run. The study also demonstrates that Thai economic data coincides quite well with the model presented here. Finally, it points out that the high <b>interest</b> <b>policy</b> itself might provoke high risk-premium, the existence of which, in turn, justifies the policy. This means that the policy has a self-fulfilling property. In conclusion, a "one-size-fits-all" adaptation of high <b>interest</b> rate <b>policy</b> in a currency crisis is very dangerous in general, and was inappropriate for East Asia. The desirable policy would have been to let currencies depreciate and keep interest rates stable.

40|$|Since February 1999, {{including}} a brief intermission, the Bank of Japan has consistently pursued a zero <b>interest</b> rate <b>policy.</b> This paper examines how the Japanese Government Bond (JGB) market—the benchmark {{indicator of the}} long-term interest rate—has responded to the zero <b>interest</b> rate <b>policy.</b> We study changes in the JGB market {{from the perspective of}} the two goals of the zero interest rate policy—supplying liquidity, and dispelling deflationary concerns. First, after testing the expectations hypothesis for determination of long-term interest rates, we conduct an empirical analysis of the effect of the zero <b>interest</b> rate <b>policy</b> on the JGB market, focusing on the forward rate. The results are as follows. 1. Overall, the expectations hypothesis holds for the JGB market. 2. At the same time, we confirmed the existence of a liquidity premium over the long term. That is, the term premium is an increasing function of maturity. This means that the liquidity premium hypothesis rejected by Kuroda (1982) has been validated in recent years. 3. During the period of the zero <b>interest</b> rate <b>policy,</b> policy changes toward further easing had the effect of reducing the marginal term premium. In particular, the reinstatement of the zero <b>interest</b> rate <b>policy</b> on March 19, 2001 successfully reduced the marginal premium of government bonds of various maturities by a statistically significant amount. A similar result has been confirmed regarding the BOJ’s declared commitment to pursuing the zero <b>interest</b> rate <b>policy</b> (the policy duration effect) by Shiratsuka and * The authors wish to acknowledge Teruyoshi Suzuki of NLI Research Institute for his assistance in measuring forward rates...|$|R
