50|$|The {{hematopoietic cells}} are most {{sensitive}} to low oxygen {{and are the}} first to die after reduction or removal of the blood supply, usually within 12 hours. Experimental evidence suggests that bone cells (osteocytes, osteoclasts, osteoblasts etc.) <b>die</b> <b>within</b> 12-48 hours, and that bone marrow fat cells <b>die</b> <b>within</b> 5 days.|$|R

25|$|The rapidity {{with which}} {{premature}} cell death can occur {{depends on the}} cell type and the degree and duration of the anoxia. Haematopoietic cells, in bone marrow, are sensitive to anoxia and {{are the first to}} die after reduction or removal of the blood supply. In anoxic conditions they usually <b>die</b> <b>within</b> 12 hours. Experimental evidence suggests that bone cells composed of osteocytes, osteoclasts, and osteoblasts <b>die</b> <b>within</b> 12–48 hours, and marrow fat cells <b>die</b> <b>within</b> 120 hours. The death of bone does not alter its radiographic opacity nor its mineral density. Necrotic bone does not undergo resorption; therefore, it appears relatively more opaque.|$|R
5|$|Edward died in 924. His realms {{appear to}} have been divided with the West Saxons {{recognising}} Ælfweard while the Mercians chose Æthelstan who had been raised at Æthelflæd's court.

5|$|As {{successful}} as Carroll was in business, however, {{he and his}} wife experienced many personal losses throughout this period. Of the ten children born to Charles and Mary Carroll, five <b>died</b> <b>within</b> a year of their birth. Henry, their eldest son, died the year before his father in 1719, at the age of 21 or 22. Only the third child, named Charles and later known as Charles Carroll of Annapolis, and their next son Daniel would marry and have children of their own.|$|E

A few living specimens were taken to Wayland College (now Wayland Baptist University), but <b>died</b> <b>within</b> 17 hours for unknown reasons. Two of the females laid eggs before dying, one laying 3,000 and the other 8,000.|$|E

5|$|Survival rates {{differ by}} region. A male {{captured}} in Arkansas {{lived to be}} at least 73 months old, and in Alabama, the oldest female and male captured were six and ten years old, respectively. A mark-and-recapture analysis of the wrens analyzing survival probability within the Southeastern United States captured was monitored from 1992 to 2003. Roughly 90 percent of the banded wrens <b>died</b> <b>within</b> 10 years.|$|E

If {{a group of}} people is exposed to a 50 to 59 rems acute (within 24 hours) radiation dose, none will get radiation sickness. If the group is exposed to 60 to 180 rems, 50% will become sick with radiation poisoning. If medically treated, all of the 60–180 rems group will survive. If the group is exposed to 200 to 450 rems, most if not all of the group will become sick. 50% of the 200–450 rems group will <b>die</b> <b>within</b> two to four weeks, even with medical attention. If the group is exposed to 460 to 600 rems, 100% of the group will get radiation poisoning. 50% of the 460–600 rems group will <b>die</b> <b>within</b> one to three weeks. If the group is exposed to 600 to 1000 rems, 50% will die in one to three weeks. If the group is exposed to 1,000 to 5,000 rems, 100% of the group will <b>die</b> <b>within</b> 2 weeks.

During the cholera epidemic of 1837, patients who had contracted the disease at the Ospizio in Floriana were transferred to Ricasoli.

5|$|Beginning in the 1840s, European {{settlers}} cleared vast {{tracts of}} land for farming and grazing, further reducing kakapo habitat. They brought more dogs and other mammalian predators, including domestic cats, black rats and stoats. Europeans knew little of the kakapo until George Gray of the British Museum described it from a skin in 1845. As the Māori had done, early European explorers and their dogs ate kakapo. In the late 19th century, the kakapo became well known as a scientific curiosity, and thousands were captured or killed for zoos, museums and collectors. Most captured specimens <b>died</b> <b>within</b> months. From at least the 1870s, collectors knew the kakapo population was declining; their prime concern was to collect {{as many as possible}} before the bird became extinct.|$|E

Severe laryngeal oedema and coronary atherosclerosis was detected in most of the autopsies of those who died. Most of the victims <b>died</b> <b>within</b> 20 minutes after being stung.
