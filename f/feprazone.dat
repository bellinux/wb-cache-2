40|$|SUMMARY The {{radiological}} {{development from}} normal bone of geodes and subsequent fractures in phalanges of two adjacent fingers {{is described in}} a patient with classical rheumatoid arthritis. Presentation was as a septic, discharging focus, but infection was excluded; the pathology is described. Key words: bone cyst, infection, synovitis. A 75 -year-old housewife with seropositive erosive rheumatoid arthritis of 12 years ' duration presented with a four-week history of pain, swelling, and redness of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint of the right index finger. Previous therapy had consisted of D-penicillamine (1980 - 2) and multiple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and she was currently taking Methrazone (<b>feprazone),</b> Distalge-sic (dextropropoxyphene and paracetamol), and sodium aurothiomalate (total dose 1050 mg). In 1981 she had received injections of triamcinolone hexacetonide into multiple small finger joints, in-cluding {{the second and third}} PIP joints bilaterally. On examination there was redness, swelling, and a discharging area overlying the PIP joint of the right index finger. There were multiple swollen handjoints, but no focus of infection. Investigations showed: haemoglobin 9. 9 g/dl, white cell count 5 5 x 109 /l, plasma viscosity 2 - 10 cP, alkaline phospha-tase 113 IU/l, negative syphilis serology, protein electrophoresis of a chronic inflammatory pattern, and normal serum lipids. Radiographs in March 1983 confirmed widespread erosive disease in numerous joints of the hands, and revealed cystic changes in the bases of the middle phalanges of the right index and middle fingers and fracture of the base of the index finger middle phalanx (Fig. 1) ...|$|E
