5|$|This {{artificial}} lake {{is connected to}} {{the east side of the}} Segaran Lake via a 380 meter long canal that runs east to west. The canal was about 20 meter wide and there are two bottlenecks that are thought to be the place where a hanging bridge once stood.

5|$|Having had two frigates {{confirm that}} the French fleet was still at Brest, and {{realising}} that it would leave to protect the imminent convoy, Howe attempted an interception in advance by placing his ships where he thought an encounter likely. After thirteen days of searching, the British fleet returned on 19May, to find the fleet in Brest <b>gone.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> same day, Howe's fleet fell in with the fifth-rate , which had been attached to Rear-Admiral Sir George Montagu's squadron. Also searching for the convoy, Montagu had been cruising between Cape Ortugal and Belle-Isle, but knowing he would be hopelessly outnumbered, he had sent Venus to locate Howe and ask for reinforcements. At 04:00 the next morning, Howe ordered all sail {{in an attempt to}} reach Montagu before the French. A Dutch convoy, bound for Lisbon, had been captured by the French on 19 May and some of these ships were intercepted by the British on 21 May. The crews were able to provide information regarding the whereabouts of the French fleet and Howe set off in pursuit, realising that Montagu was no longer in danger. Not wishing to reduce his numbers by allocating prize crews, Howe ordered the convoy destroyed.|$|E

Originally a two-hour program on weekdays, it expanded to Sundays (originally 90 minutes, now a one-hour program) in 1987 and Saturdays (running for two hours) in 1992.

25|$|The pair {{continued}} their partnership on Day 5, until a rain delay halted play. Marsh built towards his century before Harris was dismissed (21) after a 69-run stand. Marsh was then {{desperate to get}} to his hundred before lunch and tried to push a quick single to mid-off and was run-out for 99. Australia then declared at lunch at 9/318, giving India a target of 384 off 71 overs. India's run chase started terribly when Dhawan (0), KL Rahul (1) and Vijay (11) all fell early with India at 3/19. Ajinkya Rahane (33*) and Virat Kohli (54*) built another partnership as India reached tea at 3/104. Kohli was <b>gone</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first ball after tea with India in trouble. Rahane and Pujara also put on a 37-run stand before Pujara was bowled (21). Rahane (48) was also out shortly after. R Ashwin (8*) and MS Dhoni (24*) lasted out the day when both captains agreed no result was possible and the match was drawn with 4 overs remaining. The draw ensured Australia won the series, a 2-0 lead with one match to go. Ryan Harris was awarded Man of the Match for his 6 wickets in the match and 74 in the first innings. MS Dhoni retired from Test cricket after this match.|$|E
25|$|While {{this article}} {{deals with the}} core {{definition}} for the American Southwest, there are many others. The various definitions {{can be broken down}} into four main categories: Historical/Archeological; Geological/Topographical; Ecological; and Cultural. In the 1930s and 1940s, many definitions of the Southwest included all or part of Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arizona, California, Colorado, and Utah. As time has <b>gone</b> <b>on,</b> <b>the</b> definition of the Southwest as become more solidified and more compact. For example, in 1948 the National Geographic Society defined the American Southwest as all of California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico, and the southernmost sections of Oregon, Idaho, and Wyoming, as well as parts of southwest Nebraska, western Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. By 1977, the Society's definition had narrowed to only the four states of Utah, Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico; and by 1982 the portion of the Southwest in the United States, as defined by the Society, had shrunk to Arizona and New Mexico, with the southernmost strip of Utah and Colorado, as well as the Mojave and Colorado deserts in California. Other individuals who focus on Southwest studies who favored a more limited extent of the area to center on Arizona and New Mexico, with small parts of surrounding areas, include Erna Fergusson, Charles Lummis (who claimed to have coined the term, the Southwest), and cultural geographer Raymond Gastil, and ethnologist Miguel León-Portilla.|$|E
25|$|For example, the Soviets {{in their}} {{invasion}} of southern Sakhalin on August 11 outnumbered the Japanese {{by a factor}} of three but they were unable to advance due to strong Japanese resistance. The Soviet invasion of the Kuril Islands took place after Japan's capitulation on August 15, and despite this, the Japanese forces in these islands resisted quite fiercely (although some of them were unwilling to fight due to Japan's surrender on August 15). In the Battle of Shumshu, the Soviets had 8,821 troops unsupported by tanks and without larger warships. The well-established Japanese garrison had 8,500 troops and fielded around 77 tanks. The Battle of Shumshu lasted for five days in which the Soviets lost over 516 troops and five of the sixteen landing ships (most of these ships were ex-U.S. Navy) to Japanese coastal artillery while the Japanese lost over 256 troops. At the end, Soviet casualties totaled up to 1,567 while the Japanese suffered 1,018 casualties, making it the only battle in the 1945 Soviet-Japanese War where Russian losses exceeded the Japanese. If the war had actually <b>gone</b> <b>on,</b> <b>the</b> death toll among the Soviets in their invasion of the Kuril Islands would have been far higher and the logistics supply would be severely strained due to lack of Soviet capability to supply its forces and equipment overseas. At the time of Japan's surrender, an estimated 50,000 Japanese soldiers were stationed in Hokkaido. If the Soviets attempted to land at Hokkaido with limited naval capability, it would have run high up to 20,000 Soviet casualties each week, which would have easily destroyed the Soviets' will to wage war against the Japanese.|$|E
