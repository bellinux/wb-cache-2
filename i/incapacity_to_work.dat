This study investigates the impact of an intervention by the occupational physician as well as of socioeconomic and work-related factors on duration dependence during sickness absence. Methods: Analyses were performed at the population level using data from a major longitudinal survey on <b>work</b> <b>incapacity</b> and return <b>to</b> <b>work</b> in The Netherlands. Several models of duration dependence are estimated. Results: Evidence is found for the presence of variable-duration dependence. Characteristics that influence duration dependence of the return-to-work (RTW) rate are identified.

40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been rising {{interest}} in Streptococcus group Milleri (SM) because high mortality rates have been related to it. In case of deep neck infections (DNI), whatever the origin, mortality rates as high as 26  % were reported. But there are no data available for DNI with SM of purely dental origin. The aim of our article was to describe and analyse DNI of purely dental origin involving on one hand SM {{and on the other}} hand infections without presence of SM. We compared these two groups and statistically investigated if there were differences in clinical presentation (age, mouth opening, length of hospital stay, laboratory parameters) or clinical behaviour (re-operation, re-hospitalisation, secondary osteomyelitis, stay at intensive care, length of antibiotic treatment, presence of resistances against antibiotics, <b>incapacity</b> <b>to</b> <b>work).</b> For this, we retrospectively searched medical records of our institution for all purulent DNI treated from 2004 till 2012. We found 81 patients meeting all inclusion criteria. Thirty-four patients had involvement of SM, 47 did not. The only statistically significant difference between the SM group and the non-SM group was the length of <b>incapacity</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> All other parameters were non-significant. Furthermore, there were no fatalities. In conclusion, the clinical importance of this article is that patients with deep neck abscesses of purely dental origin involving SM do not need more or different care when compared to all other DNI of dental origin...|$|E

40|$|Background: The UK {{government}} is advocating {{the use of}} supported employment to help people on <b>incapacity</b> benefits back <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> {{with an emphasis on}} Individual Placement and Support (IPS) models. However there is little UK-based evidence on the key ingredients of effective support. Aim: To ascertain service users’ views of what they found helpful about supported employment. Method: Interviews were carried out with 182 people with severe and enduring mental health problems who were actively engaged with one of the six supported employment agencies included in the study. Results: Three themes emerged: emotional support, practical assistance and a client-centred approach. Conclusion: The findings highlight the importance of the quality of support, particularly through interpersonal dynamics, which go beyond the organizational features emphasized in the IPS model.

40|$|As {{someone who}} used <b>to</b> <b>work</b> as a {{pharmacist}} within the National Health Service, I {{was very interested}} in attending this conference. I have always felt that Occupational Psychologists could make a huge impact in the NHS in a broad range of areas, from personnel selection and retention, through training design and theory, to human factors – such as designing out risk and error. Another reason for wanting to attend is that, currently working for Jobcentre Plus in the field of employment and disability, I am increasingly making links with healthcare professionals such as GPs, occupational therapists and head injury rehabilitation teams. This is in part because of an increasing focus towards helping people on <b>Incapacity</b> Benefit return <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> Background of delegates About twenty delegates attended.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the difficulties which {{people with mental}} health conditions may experience in establishing and maintaining entitlement to the social security benefits which underwrite incapacity for work. Two regimes are currently operating simultaneously, the incapacity benefits regime, introduced in 1995, and employment and support allowance (ESA), introduced in October 2008. The thesis identifies the main barriers <b>to</b> <b>incapacity</b> for <b>work</b> benefits for people with mental health problems as the symptoms of mental illness, administrative procedures, national insurance contribution conditions, assessment, conditionality, appeals {{and complexity of the}} welfare system. It compares the two regimes and concludes that although problems arise with both incapacity benefits and ESA, problems with ESA are greater. The ESA scheme and ongoing reforms appear <b>to</b> have <b>worked</b> well for people who are at the most severe end of the spectrum of mental illness, since they receive more money and are relieved of conditionality.

40|$|Objectives Occupational {{accidents}} {{constitute a}} substantial health and economic burden for societies {{around the world}} and a variety of factors determine the frequency of accidents at work. The aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate the relationship between the economic situation and the rate of occupational accidents in Poland. Material and Methods The analysis comprised data for 66 Polish sub-regions taken from the Central Statistical Office’s Local Data Bank. The regression analysis with panel data for period 2002 – 2014 was applied to identify the relationships involved. Four measures of accidents were used: the rates of total occupational accidents, accidents among men and women separately as well as days of <b>incapacity</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> due to accidents at work per employee. Four alternative measures assessed the economic situation: gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, average remuneration, the unemployment rate and number of dwelling permits. The confounding variables included were: employment in hazardous conditions and the size of enterprises. Results The results of the regression estimates show that the number of occupational accidents in Poland exhibits procyclical behavior, which means that more accidents are observed during the times of economic expansion. Stronger relationships were observed in the equations explaining men’s accident rates as well as total rates. A weaker and not always statistically significant impact of economic situation was identified for women’s accident rates and days of <b>incapacity</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> Conclusions The results have important implications for occupational health and safety actions. In the periods of higher work intensity employers should focus on appropriate training and supervision of inexperienced workers as well as on ensuring enough time for already experienced employees to recuperate. In terms of public health actions, policy makers should focus on scrutinizing working conditions, educating employers and counteracting possible discrimination of injured employees.

This question tries to make a critical assessment of the traditional systems of social security that assumed that any disability led {{to the end of the}} productive life. However, that differs completely from the view of the social model of disability that states that disability comes from the social barriers and not from the persons.

40|$|Following PIETERS’ {{classification}} of social risks, {{at least two}} social risks can be identified during pregnancy and after childbirth: the <b>incapacity</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> of the delivering mother and {{the care of the}} new-born. European Union (EU) Directives on maternity leave, namely the Pregnant Workers Directive (PrWD) 92 / 85 and Directive 2010 / 41 −hereinafter the Self-Employment Directive (SED) 2010 −, seem to adopt a single social risk approach, defined as that which focuses mainly on the protection of the delivering worker, since they justify maternity leave by the vulnerability of the delivering woman and protect the related <b>incapacity</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> by providing an exclusive leave of at least 14 weeks. Some recent case law of the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) suggests that maternity leave is not consistent with this single-social risk approach –the C. D. and Z. cases − and clashes with the principle of non-discrimination on grounds of sex −the Roca Álvarez and Betriu Montull cases. The objective {{of this paper is to}} give an answer to the two research questions: what is the social risk approach adopted by the EU Directives on maternity leave, and to what extent is it consistent? The paper concludes that there is some evidence that both the PrWD and the SED 2010 follow a single social risk approach, taking into account the context of maternity leave (legal base and purpose of the Directive), the justification of this leave, the entitlement to maternity leave, the use of the leave and the variations in duration. The paper also concludes that the approach adopted by the EU Directives on maternity leave is not consistent enough. In this sense, medical evidence is conclusive. For most women, the period of <b>incapacity</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> will last a maximum of 6 weeks after childbirth (puerperium), much shorter than the minimum 14 -week maternity leave period prescribed by the EU Directives on maternity leave. In other words, in most cases the period from the 7 th week on is not justified at all by the work incapacity, but by the care of the new-born. This medical evidence is somehow reflected in the ECJ’s case law and in the Member States’ legislation. The justification is blended at national level, and even occasionally at EU level −sporadic justification of the maternity leave regulated by the PrWD by the Hofmann case law. As for the distribution of the work incapacity and childcare elements, the distinction between the compulsory and the voluntary parts of maternity leave is essential. The first period (generally from 2 to 6 weeks long) would roughly match the puerperium, during which the work incapacity plays a crucial role. The second (voluntary) period (the greater part of maternity leave) appears to be justified only by the care of the new-born, where both the mother and the father can take part. An indication of this is the possibility for the father to be entitled to this period under normal circumstances if the delivering mother decides to transfer it. status: publishe...|$|E
