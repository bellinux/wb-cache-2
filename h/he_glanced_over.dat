60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> his {{shoulder}} at Razumov, who {{waited for him to}} move on.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{when the}} girls are going down," [...] laughed Jack, who had {{recognized}} Juliet's scarlet boating-suit as <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> his shoulder.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> his {{shoulder}} at the Indian girl as he spoke. She was riding behind with an air of perfect ease and self-possession.|$|E
6000|$|Paul {{took the}} {{envelope}} and opened it. It contained a printer's proof-slip, which <b>he</b> hurriedly <b>glanced</b> <b>over.</b> It read as follows:-- ...|$|R
60|$|At this {{question}} the aged colored man blinked {{his eyes and}} shifted uneasily. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> back, <b>over</b> his load of wood.|$|R
6000|$|... "You ebber see him, Josh?" [...] <b>he</b> asked, <b>glancing</b> <b>over</b> each {{shoulder}} hurriedly, as {{it might}} be, {{to make sure that}} he could not see [...] "him," [...] too.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's your affair," [...] he said curtly. [...] "Eh, Carrier?" [...] And <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> his {{shoulder}} at the proconsul, who at once assented.|$|E
60|$|Both girls laughed, and Amy averred that Karl's eyes {{danced with}} merriment as <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> his shoulder, as the silvery peal sounded behind him.|$|E
60|$|Taking them up {{carelessly}} <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> two {{or three}} quickly when something caught his eye which caused the cry of surprise that had stopped Bob.|$|E
6000|$|... "Best not go {{far from}} camp alone, sir. 'T isn't above safe hereabouts," [...] {{he said in a}} low voice. I noticed that <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> back <b>over</b> his {{shoulder}} as he spoke.|$|R
6000|$|... "But," [...] cried <b>he,</b> as <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> hastily <b>over</b> the letter, [...] "there {{can be no}} doubt! These {{words are}} as certain as {{language}} can make them. Why will you not trust them?" ...|$|R
60|$|After {{running a}} few steps, <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> back <b>over</b> his shoulder, and then ceased running; the {{elephant}} {{was no longer}} in sight above the waggon, but had fallen an inert mass by its side.|$|R
6000|$|... "What do you want?" [...] demanded one, {{as soon as}} {{he could}} speak. And then <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> their {{shoulders}} to see if the newcomers were alone.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> his shoulder. Every {{one looked}} toward the door. Just outside were two dark figures. To three people at the table the truth came like a flash.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mm," [...] Ludlow {{made in his}} throat. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> the {{shoulder}} next her, and asked, as if Charmian were not there, [...] "What makes you do her always alike?" ...|$|E
60|$|This pleasantry so tickles Mr. Smallweed that he laughs, {{long and}} low, before the fire. But ever while <b>he</b> laughs, <b>he</b> <b>glances</b> <b>over</b> his paralytic {{shoulder}} at Mr. George and eagerly watches {{him as he}} unlocks the padlock of a homely cupboard at the distant end of the gallery, looks here and there upon the higher shelves, and ultimately takes something out with a rustling of paper, folds it, {{and puts it in}} his breast. Then Judy pokes Mr. Smallweed once, and Mr. Smallweed pokes Judy once.|$|R
6000|$|... "I would willingly give five hundred," [...] {{said the}} J.P., taking the {{slip of paper}} and the pencil which Holmes handed to him. [...] "This is not quite correct, however," [...] <b>he</b> added, <b>glancing</b> <b>over</b> the document.|$|R
60|$|At {{these latter}} words the girl shivered again, {{and for a}} moment paused in her rowing, seeming to turn deadly faint. It escaped his attention, for <b>he</b> was <b>glancing</b> <b>over</b> the stern at {{something}} the boat had in tow.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good Lord, I say, what ho!" [...] cried Ginger. [...] "Fancy {{meeting you}} here. What {{a bit of}} luck!" [...] <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> his {{shoulder}} warily. [...] "Has that blighter pipped?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Whilst he was hastily packing {{together}} a few articles for his journey <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> a poor plain missive also lately come to hand--the one from Marian and Izz Huett, beginning-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{means to}} give us {{as much of a}} chase as possible," [...] remarked Tom, as <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> his shoulder. [...] "If I {{remember}} rightly, Baxter was always a pretty fair oarsman." ...|$|E
60|$|Hans did not answer, but rode on steadily, {{though every}} now and then <b>he</b> cast a <b>glance</b> <b>over</b> his shoulder.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have laid}} all that I intend; but I don't think my man can lose it." [...] For all that, the smile had faded from his face, and I {{observed}} that <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> continually <b>over</b> his shoulder {{into the crowd}} behind him.|$|R
6000|$|... "We must go back," [...] <b>he</b> repeated, <b>glancing</b> <b>over</b> his {{shoulder}} {{to see if the}} enemy kept their distance. [...] "We have been happy for a time.... But the world is too civilised. Ours is the age of cities. More of this will kill us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pooh! It's only a squall--be {{over in a}} minute," [...] {{said the}} middy, by way of {{encouraging}} himself, as <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> {{his shoulder at the}} flickering lights, which were now barely visible.|$|E
60|$|Charnock {{nodded as}} <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> {{the edge of}} the narrow tableland. The descent was not steep near the top, but farther on it dropped precipitously to the water, {{crossing}} the curve by the bridge.|$|E
6000|$|... "So far, so good," [...] murmured the mate, as <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> his {{shoulder}} at the little group posing on the steps. [...] "I’ve done the best I could, but I suppose there’ll be a row." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We shall do {{well with}} Maikar in the bow, for he sees like a weasel, and is trustworthy," [...] muttered the captain as <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> uneasily <b>over</b> the stern, where the hungry waves were still hissing tumultuously after them, as if {{rendered}} furious by the delayed meal.|$|R
60|$|Childers gave a {{smile of}} {{pleasure}} as his schoolfellows jumped on board. <b>He</b> had, <b>glancing</b> <b>over</b> his shoulder, seen them drift out of sight round the point, and had felt certain that they had reached shore. It was, however, {{a great pleasure to}} be assured of the fact.|$|R
6000|$|... "That will do," [...] said Holmes. [...] "As to the letters," [...] <b>he</b> continued, <b>glancing</b> <b>over</b> them, [...] "they {{are very}} commonplace. Absolutely no clue in them to Mr. Angel, save that he quotes Balzac once. There is one {{remarkable}} point, however, which {{will no doubt}} strike you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A good beginning, truly. Now for the rest," [...] said Godwin. Then <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> his shoulder, and added, [...] "See, {{they are}} leading Rosamund away, but Sinan remains, {{to speak with}} you doubtless, for Masouda beckons." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'One out of {{that crowd}} will call me his,' said Miss McCabe, handing to her adorer the list, which she had {{received}} by mail {{a day or two}} earlier, of the accepted competitors. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> the names.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> {{the first}} page, but on {{turning to the}} second his eye became arrested, and he read carefully, {{frowning}} deeply as he did so. Then he turned back and read it again. The passage was as follows: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear!" [...] <b>he</b> cried, <b>glancing</b> <b>over</b> his shoulder; [...] "my dear, {{here is our}} guest! Welcome, {{welcome to}} Greylands! I am delighted to make your acquaintance, Cousin Marshall, and I {{take it as a}} great {{compliment}} that you should honour this sleepy little country place with your presence." ...|$|R
60|$|Monty--no one at Buckomari {{had ever}} known of any other name for him--stretched out a long hand, with {{delicate}} tapering fingers, and let it rest for a moment gingerly in the thick, brown palm of his companion. Then <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> stealthily <b>over</b> his shoulder and his eyes gleamed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I {{blurted out}} that there WAS {{going to be a}} railroad. Some one spoke up: 'Who said that? Fetch him here.' Pretty soon I was looking at Major-General Lodge. He was just from the war and he looked it. Stern and dark, with hard lines and keen eyes. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> me <b>over.</b>|$|R
