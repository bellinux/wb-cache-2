50|$|The <b>grass</b> <b>spider</b> (Agelenopsis) has an {{interesting}} life cycle. It starts {{out as a}} little egg then hatches and looks like a tiny adult. It then sheds its skin as it grows. These arachnids like to eat grasshoppers, ants and crickets. Some things that like to prey on grass spiders include cats, dogs, owls and birds. Humans are also a predator of the <b>grass</b> <b>spider</b> and people usually don’t like them and choose to step on them. They can {{grow up to be}} 1/3 to 2/3 inches when full grown. If you want to find the <b>grass</b> <b>spider</b> it is located in North America and lives around grassy areas, stone fences, and small shrubs. You will definitely find these critters at Weed Lake so be careful not to step on them. They look brownish grey with prominent stripe markings. Their life span is about a year long.|$|E
50|$|The desert <b>grass</b> <b>spider</b> (Agelenopsis aperta) is {{a species}} of spider {{belonging}} to the family Agelenidae. It is found in dry regions across the Southern United States and into Mexico.|$|E
50|$|Numerous other spiders {{have been}} {{associated}} with necrotic bites. The white tailed spider (Lampona spp) had been suspected in necrotic lesions for decades only to be exonerated by the first extensive review. An early report Sac spider causing necrosis has been frequently referenced. Recent surveys doubt the incidence of necrosis. Necrosis from Hobo spider, a member <b>grass</b> <b>spider</b> family Agelenidae, bite is under the same debate and doubt.|$|E
50|$|Adult A. viaticus feed on nectar from flowers. Wasps in {{this species}} {{predominantly}} prey on spiders from the wolf spider family Lycosidae, {{but they also}} take ground <b>spiders</b> (Gnaphosidae), <b>grass</b> <b>spiders</b> (Agelenidae), crab spiders (Thomisidae) and jumping spiders (Salticidae).|$|R
50|$|Agelena is a genus of agelenid spiders that trap {{their prey}} by weaving {{entangling}} non-sticky funnel webs. The genus {{is limited to}} the Old world, where it occurs from Africa to Japan. It is sometimes referred to as Eurasian <b>grass</b> <b>spiders,</b> as opposed to its North-American counterpart, Agelenopsis.|$|R
50|$|The long-billed crombec's nest is a large, hanging bag of <b>grasses,</b> <b>spider</b> webs, {{and plant}} fibres, which is {{attached}} to the lower limbs of a tree, often an Acacia. The one to three white eggs are incubated for two weeks to hatching, and the chicks are fed by both parents for another two weeks to fledging. This territorial species is monogamous, pairing for life.|$|R
5000|$|Breeding occurs from August or September to February or March, {{with one}} or two broods per season. The nest is a neat cup made of bark and <b>grass.</b> <b>Spider</b> webs, {{feathers}} and fur are used for binding or filling, the outside is decorated by lichen or bits of bark [...]The nest is generally placed in a tree fork or hanging vine up a few metres above the ground. A clutch of two eggs is laid. The eggs are cream to buff, and marked with brown splotches and spots, usually concentrated around the large end, and measure 20 by 15 mm.|$|E
5000|$|The nests {{are often}} found {{with two or}} three eggs during breeding.  The eggs are an off-white colour with dark brown specs {{across the surface of the}} egg, however most of the specs are towards one end of the egg. The nests are {{normally}} located from 1 meter to 13 meters from the ground, depending on the available opportunities to build a nest and are suspended hammock like between two branches. The nests are deep and cup shaped, woven with <b>grass,</b> <b>spider</b> silk and spider egg sacs. Often the nest is lined with soft materials like possum fur or “pussy tail” grass.|$|E
5000|$|The species feeds in {{the foliage}} of trees on insects, {{including}} beetles, grasshoppers, wasps, ants and moths. It {{is less likely}} to catch prey in the air than other gerygones, but will join mixed-species feeding flocks with white-eyes, honey-eaters and fantails. The species mostly feeds in the canopy but will forage amongst the roots of mangroves. The mangrove gerygone breeds throughout the year, although principally in spring-summer in the east of Australia and during the dry season in the north. The female builds the oval domed nest. It is constructed out of roots, <b>grass,</b> <b>spider</b> webs, moss, seaweed and bark, and hangs from mangroves. Two to three eggs, [...] are laid in the nest and are incubated for 14-17 days. Both parents feed the chick for another 14-17 days. A number of cuckoo species are brood parasites of this species.|$|E
50|$|Wolf spiders {{resemble}} nursery web spiders (family Pisauridae), but wolf spiders {{carry their}} egg sacs by attaching {{them to their}} spinnerets (Pisauridae carry their egg sacs with their chelicerae and pedipalps). Two of the wolf spider's eight eyes are large and prominent, which distinguishes them from the nursery web spiders whose eyes are all of approximately equal size. This can also help distinguish them from <b>grass</b> <b>spiders.</b>|$|R

40|$|There {{have been}} but few studies of spider life histories; {{most of the}} work on these animals has been taxonomic and morpho-logical. The Peckhams (1890), Fabre (1919), Peters (1931 - 1937) and others have studied various phases of spider behavior, and Savory (1928) {{summarized}} the work done on spiders. The writer has found no records of studies on the effect of temper-ature and humidity upon spiders. The present paper attempts to show the influence of these physical factors upon the early stages of Agelena naevia Walckenaer. The common <b>grass</b> <b>spider,</b> Agelena naevia Walckenaer, occurs frequently in woodlands and meadows. Its eggs are laid in the fall, and in early October they may be found beneath the loose bark on trees and logs, in rather dry places. The writer has not found them in very wet logs. Each female may form as many as three cocoons, though often only one is made. When two or more are formed, usually one of them has only a few (20 - 30) eggs; the larger cocoons have more than 100 eggs, and as many as 200 are commonly seen. All the cocoons formed by one female are enclosed in a common covering of heavy, strong silk. Dirt or wood chips are attached, so that the egg-sac appears dark. The cocoon is attached to both bark and log if these layers are close together. Otherwise it is attached to only one of them. Often the adult female is found near her cocoons. As the winter approaches she becomes more and more sluggish, and finally dies...|$|E
50|$|Argiope catenulata, {{also known}} as the <b>grass</b> cross <b>spider,</b> is a species of Orb-weaver spiders ranging from India to the Philippines to Papua New Guinea. Like other species of the same genus, it builds a web with a zig-zag stabilimentum.|$|R
50|$|Agelenopsis is a genus of spiders, {{known as}} American <b>grass</b> <b>spiders.</b> They weave sheet webs {{that have a}} funnel shelter on one edge. The web is not sticky, but these spiders make up for that {{shortcoming}} by running very rapidly. The larger specimens (depending on species) can grow to about 19 mm in body length. They may be recognized by the arrangement of their eight eyes into three rows. The top row has two eyes, the middle row has four eyes, and the bottom row has two eyes (spaced wider than {{the ones on the}} top row). They have two prominent hind spinnerets, somewhat indistinct bands on their legs, and two dark bands running down either side of the cephalothorax.|$|R
50|$|The {{placement}} of these traps is completely dependent on {{which type of}} spiders are desired. Also, {{the time of the}} year these traps are set will greatly influence the species and maturity of caught <b>spiders.</b> For <b>grass</b> <b>spiders</b> (a.k.a. funnel weavers), mature adults can best be caught in the late summer and early fall. Placement of traps for this species would be most effective in a grass-like habitat on the ground. For best results, these traps should be set and left undisturbed for a length of time. This time span can range from a couple weeks to a month or more. The time given for collection varies, but there is generally a higher rate of capture the longer the trap is set.|$|R
60|$|The {{smoke of}} cottages rose straight; wisps of mist were {{wandering}} about the valley, and {{the songs of}} birds dropping like blessings. All over the <b>grass</b> the <b>spiders</b> had spun a sea of threads that bent and quivered to {{the pressure of the}} air, like fairy tight-ropes.|$|R
50|$|It {{feeds on}} insects and <b>spiders,</b> <b>grass</b> and bamboo seeds. It will also squeeze nectar from flowers and juice from berries.|$|R
50|$|Being an {{arthropod}} food generalist, {{the main}} diet consists of {{species of the}} Orthoptera order (crickets and <b>grass</b> hoppers), <b>spiders</b> and Diptera species, with a favourite delicacy of termites. While widely foraging, D. tessellatus is a sit-and-wait predator often sitting at the same spot for hours. Before breeding and hibernation in winter, food intake will increase to help produce fat storage.|$|R
50|$|The flimsy cup nest is {{constructed}} from twigs, <b>grass</b> and <b>spider</b> webs {{in a tree}} fork, and decorated with lichens. It is very well camouflaged. The female normally lays two eggs, which are off-white, greenish or greyish blotched with grey or brown. Both sexes incubate for about 19 days to hatching. The chicks fledge in another 22 days but are dependent for about eight weeks.|$|R
50|$|The {{northern}} white-crowned shrike is gregarious, {{occurring in}} groups of up 12 birds. It hunts from an exposed perch, feeding mainly on large insects, usually taken from the ground. It also will feed from the backs of large mammals, like an oxpecker, and occasionally will eat fruit which has fallen to the ground. The neat thick-walled cup nest is constructed from <b>grass</b> and <b>spider</b> webs in a horizontal tree fork 4-6 metres above the ground. The two to four white or lilac eggs are blotched with grey, purple or brown. It is likely that cooperative breeding occurs, given the gregarious habits of this species and the known cooperative breeding of the closely related southern white-crowned shrike.|$|R
5|$|Breeding occurs {{from late}} August through to January, though heavy rain in August may delay this. The nest is {{built by the}} female; it is a round or domed {{structure}} made of loosely woven <b>grasses</b> and <b>spider</b> webs, with an entrance in one side {{close to the ground}} and well-concealed in thick and often thorny vegetation, such as Acacia pulchella or a species of Hakea. One or two broods may be laid during the breeding season. A clutch of two to four dull white eggs with reddish-brown splotches and spots, measuring 12 × 16mm (½×⅝in), are laid. Incubation takes about two weeks. The female incubates the eggs for 14 or 15days; after hatching, nestlings are fed and their fecal sacs removed by all group members for 10–13days, by which time they are fledged. Young birds remain in the family group as helpers {{for a year or more}} before moving to another group, usually an adjacent one, or assuming a dominant position in the original group. In this role they feed and care for subsequent broods.|$|R

50|$|The {{range of}} the varied bunting {{stretches}} from the southern parts of Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas in the United States south throughout Mexico as far as Oaxaca. Small disjunct populations occur {{in the state of}} Chiapas in Mexico and southeastern Guatemala. This stocky bird has a short tail and rounded bill. It is 11 - 14 cm long, has a wingspan of 21 cm, and weighs 11 - 13 g. Breeding males are purple-red with a bright red patch on the nape, which becomes browner in the fall. Females are plain light brown, resembling the female indigo bunting but lacking streaking on the breast. Varied buntings inhabit deserts and xeric shrublands, preferring thorny brush thickets, thorn forests, scrubby woodlands, and overgrown clearings. They forage on the ground for insects, fruit, and seeds. Varied buntings weave open-cup nests of <b>grass</b> and <b>spider</b> webs in the outer branches of thorny shrubs, usually near water. Females lay two to five bluish-white to bluish-green eggs, which they incubate for about fourteen days. The young are fully feathered after 10 days, and are ready to leave the nest several days later.|$|R
