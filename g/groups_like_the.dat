5|$|There is {{some debate}} {{as to the}} {{decompression}} requirements for helium during short-duration dives. Most divers do longer decompressions; however, some <b>groups</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> WKPP have been pioneering the use of shorter decompression times by including deep stops.|$|E
5|$|Because of its {{multitude}} of diverse, sometimes competing ethno-linguistic groups, Nigeria prior to independence {{was faced with}} sectarian tensions and violence, particularly in the oil-producing Niger Delta region, where both state and civilian forces employ varying methods of coercion in attempts gain control over regional petroleum resources. Some of the ethnic <b>groups</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Ogoni, have experienced severe environmental degradation due to petroleum extraction.|$|E
5|$|In 1905, {{with the}} {{construction}} of Collins Hall, Fordham University became the first place on the East Coast of the United States to have a theater in the round. The Penthouse Theatre, on the fourth floor of Collins Hall, served both for debuts of professional shows and home for theater <b>groups</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Mimes and Mummers. The Penthouse Theatre was turned into office space in 1966.|$|E

5|$|The ONA {{believe that}} there are {{historical}} precedents to their practice of human sacrifice, expressing belief in a prehistoric tradition in which humans were sacrificed to a goddess named Baphomet at the spring equinox and to the Arcturus star in the autumn. However, the ONA's advocacy of human sacrifice has drawn strong criticism from other Satanist <b>groups</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Temple of Set, who deem it to be detrimental to their own attempts to make Satanism more socially acceptable within Western nations.|$|E
5|$|The {{mistrust of}} Standard Oil was {{partially}} {{the result of}} a suspicion toward carpetbaggers, which ironically was also the source of skepticism regarding labor unions. Union organizers were frequently seen as attempting to support a Northern agenda of promoting opportunities for African Americans {{at the expense of the}} white population. Because of the situation this created, labor reform was slow to develop. Despite the anti-union sentiments, <b>groups</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> International Oil Workers Union attracted membership and held some influence in the industry and state government.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the start}} of the colonial period, the region of South Kasai formed part of the Luba Empire, a {{federation}} of local kingdoms with a degree of cultural uniformity. During the 17th and 18th centuries, the Baluba spread across large parts of the Kasai-Katanga savannah along the Kasai river basin and eventually developed into a number of ethnic subgroups, notably the Luba-Kasai and the Luba-Katanga. Although never united into a single centralised state, the groups retained a degree of emotional attachment based around shared origin myths and cultural practices. Other <b>groups,</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Songye and the Kanyok, also had long histories in the Kasai region.|$|E
50|$|Whenever {{possible}} <b>the</b> G20 Research <b>Group,</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> G8 Research <b>Group,</b> sends a field team to {{the summits}} and finance meetings of the G20 to assist the world's media on site and to collect documentation uniquely available there.|$|R

He runs his own internet shopping mall.|$|R
5000|$|The TADEN {{used the}} action and gas system of the Bren but would fire from 250-round non-disintegrating metal-link belts rather than box magazines. The light machinegun model used a {{buttstock}} and trigger <b>group</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Bren and the medium machine gun model used spade grips and a butterfly trigger <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Vickers.|$|R
5|$|Folk-rock {{drew on the}} {{sporadic}} mainstream {{success of}} <b>groups</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Kingston Trio and the Almanac Singers, while Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger helped to politically radicalize rural white folk music. The popular musician Bob Dylan rose to prominence {{in the middle of}} the 1960s, fusing folk with rock and making the nascent scene closely connected to the Civil Rights Movement. He was followed by a number of country-rock bands like The Byrds and the Flying Burrito Brothers and folk-oriented singer-songwriters like Joan Baez and the Canadian Joni Mitchell. However, by the end of the decade, there was little political or social awareness evident in the lyrics of pop-singer-songwriters like James Taylor and Carole King, whose self-penned songs were deeply personal and emotional.|$|E
5|$|Hailing from Pomona, California, {{the members}} of Bonded by Blood met through mutual friends. The idea of {{creating}} a band was conceived by lead vocalist Jose Barrales, a singer with hardcore punk and crossover thrash backgrounds, influenced by <b>groups</b> <b>like</b> <b>The</b> Blackheads, Cryptic Slaughter, D.R.I. and Black Flag. He always had an appreciation for heavy metal music, {{but it was not}} until a friend recommended him to listen to Exodus that Barrales got into the thrash metal subgenre. Exodus' debut album Bonded by Blood had a profound impact on Barrales, and it was inspiring to the point he idealized the creation of a thrash metal band, as he had noticed that there were few or even no groups in this genre in the music scene.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, {{representative}} William J. Hughes of Whatcom County {{proposed the}} formation of a commission to adopt the state flag, consisting of the Governor, Secretary of State, and Adjutant General. Governor Ernest Lister became a supporter of the idea, issuing a call for designs from the state's citizens and city organizations. The campaign for a state flag, however, was opposed by patriotic <b>groups</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Sons of the American Revolution and Sons of Veterans, finding the use of a state flag to be detrimental to the national flag.|$|E
50|$|The Nga {{are more}} closely related to the Tagin both ethnically and linguistically than to Tibetans, but they claim to be a {{separate}} <b>group,</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Mara who live in Limeking. However, both tribes acknowledge that they share a common ancestry with the Tagin.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> first <b>group,</b> <b>like</b> <b>The</b> Official Story (1985) and Night of the Pencils (1986), dealt frankly {{with the}} repression, the tortures, and the disappearances during Argentina's Dirty War in the 1970s. This {{second group of}} films uses metaphor and hints at wider socio-political issues.|$|R
5000|$|An {{alternative}} fixation {{process that}} is more dominant commercially is <b>the</b> vinylsulfonyl <b>group.</b> <b>Like</b> <b>the</b> chlorotriazines, this functional group adds to the hydroxyl groups of cellulose. The most popular version of this technology is Remazol. The dye is first attached to the ethylsulfonyl group.|$|R
5|$|In The Political Demands of Isolated Indian Bands in British Columbia, Thomson {{points out}} the {{benefits}} in some level (albeit small) of separatist policies. He argues the benefits of allowing ethnic <b>groups,</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Amish and the Hutterites in the United States and Canada or the Sami in Norway, {{to live on the}} edges of governance. These are ethnic groups that would prefer to retain their ethnic identity and thus prefer separatist policies for themselves, as they do not require them to conform to policies for all ethnicities of the nation.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, soul music was {{influenced}} by psychedelic rock and other styles. The social and political ferment of the times inspired artists like Marvin Gaye and Curtis Mayfield to release album-length statements with hard-hitting social commentary. Artists like James Brown led soul towards more dance-oriented music, which eventually evolved into funk. Funk was typified by 1970s bands like Parliament-Funkadelic, The Meters, and James Brown himself, while more versatile groups like War, The Commodores and Earth, Wind and Fire also became popular. During the 1970s, some highly slick and commercial blue-eyed soul acts like Philadelphia's Hall & Oates achieved mainstream success, {{as well as a}} new generation of street-corner harmony or city-soul <b>groups</b> <b>like</b> <b>The</b> Delfonics and Howard University's Unifics.|$|E
5|$|Organisms {{were first}} {{classified}} by Aristotle (Greece, 384–322 BC) during his {{stay on the}} Island of Lesbos. He classified beings by their parts, or in modern terms attributes, such as having live birth, having four legs, laying eggs, having blood, or being warm-bodied. He divided all living things into two groups: plants and animals. Some of his groups of animals, such as Anhaima (animals without blood, translated as invertebrates) and Enhaima (animals with blood, roughly the vertebrates), as well as <b>groups</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> sharks and cetaceans, are still commonly used today. His student Theophrastus (Greece, 370–285 BC) carried on this tradition, mentioning some 500 plants and their uses in his Historia Plantarum. Again, several plant groups currently still recognized {{can be traced back}} to Theophrastus, such as Cornus, Crocus, and Narcissus.|$|E
50|$|Tour Granite {{was ordered}} by the Société Générale banking group. It was built as a {{complement}} to the Société Générale twin towers whose office space was insufficient {{for the needs of}} <b>the</b> <b>group.</b> <b>Like</b> <b>the</b> existing two towers, Tour Granite has a sharply inclined roof.|$|R
50|$|The Ieper Group lies stratigraphically {{on top of}} the Landen Group (upper Paleocene) {{and below}} <b>the</b> Zenne <b>Group</b> (<b>like</b> <b>the</b> Ieper <b>Group</b> early Eocene in age). Unlike the Zenne Group, the Ieper Group can also occur in more {{southern}} parts of Belgium, for example in the Mons Basin.|$|R

5|$|Sulu-type {{compositions}} on the kulintangan {{are found}} among the Tausug, Samal, Yakan, Sama/Badjao, Iranun and Kadazan-Dusun. Though there exist no identifiable rhythmic or melodic differences between patterns with names such as the Maguindanao, each group has their own music compositions. For instance, the Tausug have three identifiable compositions—Kuriri, Sinug, and Lubak-Lubak—the Yakan have two—Tini-id and Kuriri—and the Dusun have three—Ayas, Kudidi and Tidung. Though these melodies vary even within <b>groups</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Maguindanao and Maranao, one theme which characterizes the Sulu-type is the exchange of short melodic phrases between the kulintangan and the Agungs, where both instruments imitate and duplicate each other's rhythms very quickly. This is clearly seen in the Tausug Sinug and Yakan Tini-id and Kuriri compositions where this sort of jousting becomes a game of skill and virtuoso playing.|$|E
5|$|The Joker {{possesses}} no superhuman abilities, instead {{using his}} expertise in chemical engineering to develop poisonous or lethal concoctions, and thematic weaponry, including razor-tipped playing cards, deadly joy buzzers, and acid-spraying lapel flowers. The Joker sometimes works with other Gotham City supervillains {{such as the}} Penguin and Two-Face, and <b>groups</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Injustice Gang and Injustice League, but these relationships often collapse due to the Joker's desire for unbridled chaos. The 1990s introduced a romantic interest for the Joker in his former psychiatrist, Harley Quinn, who becomes his villainous sidekick. Although his primary obsession is Batman, the Joker has also fought other heroes including Superman and Wonder Woman.|$|E
5|$|The MNC's main rival was the Alliance des Bakongo (ABAKO), led by Joseph Kasa-Vubu, who {{advocated}} {{a more radical}} ideology than the MNC, based around calls for immediate independence {{and the promotion of}} regional identity. ABAKO's stance was more ethnic nationalist than the MNC's; it argued that an independent Congo should be run by the Bakongo as inheritors of the pre-colonial Kingdom of the Kongo. The Confédération des Associations Tribales du Katanga (CONAKAT), a localist party led by Moïse Tshombe, was the third major organisation; it advocated federalism and primarily represented the southern province of Katanga. These were joined by a number of smaller parties which emerged as the nationalist movement developed, including the radical Parti Solidaire Africain (PSA), and factions representing the interests of minor ethnic <b>groups</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Alliance des Bayanzi (ABAZI).|$|E
50|$|Most of {{the black}} people that came to Peru were from the Antilles or Africa, {{specifically}} from the regions of Congo and Angola. They were not a homogeneous ethnic <b>group,</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> immigrants and descendants of slaves in Cuba and Brazil, so they were integrated into the Peruvian culture, forming a new identity.|$|R

5|$|The United States naval gunfire support {{debate is}} an ongoing debate among the United States Navy, Marine Corps, Congress, and {{independent}} <b>groups</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> United States Naval Gunfire Support Association over what role naval gunfire support and naval surface fire support (NSFS) should play within the navy and how such a role can best be provided. At {{the heart of the}} issue is the role that naval gunfire support—the use of naval artillery to provide fire support for amphibious assault and other troops operating within their range—should play in the U.S. Navy of the 21st century.|$|E
5|$|The {{digestive}} system of beetles is primarily adapted for a herbivorous diet. Digestion takes place {{mostly in the}} anterior midgut, although in predatory <b>groups</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Carabidae, most digestion occurs in the crop by means of midgut enzymes. In the Elateridae, the larvae are liquid feeders that extraorally digest their food by secreting enzymes. The alimentary canal basically consists of a short, narrow pharynx, a widened expansion, the crop, and a poorly developed gizzard. This {{is followed by the}} midgut, that varies in dimensions between species, with a large amount of cecum, and the hindgut, with varying lengths. There are typically four to six Malpighian tubules.|$|E
5|$|The early 1970s saw {{a wave of}} singer-songwriters {{who drew}} on the introspective, deeply {{emotional}} and personal lyrics of 1960s folk-rock. They included James Taylor, Carole King and others, all known just as much for their lyric ability as for their performances. The same period saw the rise of bluesy Southern rock and country rock <b>groups</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Allman Brothers Band and Lynyrd Skynyrd. In the 1970s, soft rock developed, a kind of simple, unobtrusive and mellow form of pop-rock, exemplified {{by a number of}} bands like America and Bread, most of whom are little remembered today; many were one-hit wonders. In addition, harder arena rock bands like Chicago and Styx also saw some major success.|$|E
