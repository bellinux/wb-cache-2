He proceeded to pour gasoline over himself and set himself ablaze. Police officers quickly congregated on the scene and extinguished the flames. Shortly afterwards, another four people on the square set themselves alight. One of the four, a man, was detained and driven away in a police van.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological finds, {{including}} flint tools {{believed to}} be between 300,000 and 126,000years old made with the Levallois technique, indicate the presence of Neanderthals in the Shirehampton and St Annes areas of Bristol during the Middle Palaeolithic. Iron Age hill forts near the city are at Leigh Woods and Clifton <b>Down,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side of the Avon Gorge, and on Kings Weston Hill near Henbury. A Roman settlement, Abona, existed at what is now Sea Mills (connected to Bath by a Roman road); another was at the present-day Inns Court. Isolated Roman villas and small forts and settlements were also scattered throughout the area.|$|E
5|$|As the geyser fills, {{the water}} {{at the top of}} the column cools off, but because of the narrowness of the channel, {{convective}} cooling of the water in the reservoir is impossible. The cooler water above presses <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hotter water beneath, not unlike the lid of a pressure cooker, allowing the water in the reservoir to become superheated, i.e. to remain liquid at temperatures well above the standard-pressure boiling point.|$|E

5|$|By 2001, the Group had 66000 {{hectares}} of forestry plantations in New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia. Its {{performance on the}} share market was strong enough that it was Shares magazine's number one ranked stock in its table of top 50 stocks by yield in January 2002. However the business faced some turbulent times, with profits in 2001 and 2002 <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> levels of 2000. The company was delisted from the ASX200 for a period (from October 2002 to August 2003), although it was relisted and remained in the index until December 2008.|$|E
5|$|Chicago {{tight end}} John Gilmore picked up Vinatieri's {{bouncing}} kickoff {{and returned it}} 9-yards to his own 45-yard line, with an unnecessary roughness penalty on Mathis adding another 15yards and giving the Bears a first <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Colts' 40-yard line. Chicago could only gain 14yards on their ensuing possession, {{but it was enough}} for Robbie Gould to make a 44-yard field goal, cutting the score to 22–17.|$|E
5|$|Deep Purple was {{practically}} {{ignored by the}} music press in the US upon its release in June 1969 and bounced up and <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Billboard 200 chart for a few weeks, peaking at No. 162 and not coming close {{to the success of}} its two predecessors. Tetragrammaton's financial problems were partially to blame, as promotion was lackluster, but the lack of a hit single to be aired on FM radio or a tour in support of the album were also important factors.|$|E

5|$|However, {{some have}} {{suggested}} that the Moon nonetheless deserves to be called a planet. In 1975, Isaac Asimov noted that the timing of the Moon's orbit is in tandem with the Earth's own orbit around the Sun—looking <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ecliptic, the Moon never actually loops back on itself, and in essence it orbits the Sun in its own right.|$|E
5|$|In July, Welter claimed two United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress four-engined {{bombers and}} three North American P-51 Mustangs, {{two of which}} claimed on 19 July between Munich and Memmingen, shot down by day.

5|$|In {{an effort}} to tamp <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> unrest, martial law was {{declared}} and military governor General Martín Perfecto de Cos established headquarters in San Antonio de Béxar, stationing his troops at the Alamo. When the Texian volunteer soldiers gained control of the fortress at the Siege of Béxar, compelling Cos to surrender on December 9, many saw his expulsion {{to the other side}} of the Rio Grande as the end of Mexican forces in Texas. Most Texian soldiers in Béxar left to join a planned invasion of Matamoros, Mexico.|$|E

5|$|Johnston {{was not in}} Bradman's planned Test team. However, the Australian skipper {{changed his}} mind {{on the morning of}} the First Test in Trent Bridge when rain was forecast. Johnston was played in the hope of {{exploiting}} a wet wicket. Johnston had taken 10/40 against Yorkshire and 11/117 against Hampshire on similar surfaces. He showed his credentials by taking a match total of 9/183 from 84 overs to help Australia to grind out a victory by eight wickets. England elected to bat first and after strike bowler Ray Lindwall broke <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first day, the burden on Johnston grew.|$|E

Rather surprisingly, Fusob suggests using iTunes gift cards for payment. Also, a timer clicking <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> screen adds to the users’ anxiety as well.|$|E
