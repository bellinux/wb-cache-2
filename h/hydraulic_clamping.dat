50|$|Injection {{molding machine}} molds can be {{fastened}} {{in either a}} horizontal or vertical position. The majority of machines are horizontally oriented, but vertical machines are used in some niche applications such as insert molding, allowing the machine {{to take advantage of}} gravity. Some vertical machines also don't require the mold to be fastened. There are many ways to fasten the tools to the platens, the most common being manual clamps (both halves are bolted to the platens); however <b>hydraulic</b> <b>clamps</b> (chocks are used to hold the tool in place) and magnetic clamps are also used. The magnetic and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>clamps</b> are used where fast tool changes are required.|$|R

After losing one of his legs in a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>clamp,</b> he begins to tinker with leg prosthetics. The replacements he builds are so advanced that he amputates his remaining leg {{in order to make}} full use of them. Better Futures provides him with his own research division in cybernetics, first aimed at selling medical prosthetics, then at augmentations for private customers and finally at creating augmented soldiers. This eventually leads him to accidentally cut off his hand. Meanwhile his assistants invent all new things involving the body. He falls in love with Lola, and befriends his body guard Carl.|$|R
40|$|The {{main problem}} of the {{presence}} of high velocity winds that will cause the unloader to move from its position and cause damages to the cargo and the machineryfor grab type ship unloader is solved using a spring loaded <b>hydraulic</b> rail <b>clamp</b> mounted on a rail on which it can move to the ship and unload materials steadily. Data collected from the FACT department about the wind characteristic of the area for a particular period were used and the wind loads acting on the ship unloader is calculated. The maximum wind load that the ship unloader can withstand which has to be the one at which the spring loaded <b>hydraulic</b> <b>clamp</b> will disable is calculated After carefully studying the already existing clamping system, we found that using an alternative spring concentrically, we can increase the wind load capacity which is the maximum load the clamp can withstand. After carefully analyzing different springs we found that with the use of concentric spring, the clamp can withstand a higher amount of wind load, thus increasing the performance of ship unloader. This is proved by spring load calculations and using Autodesk Inventor and ANSYS software...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} meant to acquaint the sheet metal worker with the {{numerous}} possibilities that stretch forming offers as an economical supplementary and alternative process as compared to deep drawing. A number of cost saving effects {{can be achieved by}} suitably designed multi-purpose tooling. In addition to the higher precision of the shape and the higher stability of stretch formed components it is above all the saving in sheet material for the component, the simpler tool design and the lesser expenditure for test runs that help reduce production costs. Modern stretch forming technologies do not need separate (mostly <b>hydraulic)</b> <b>clamping</b> devices so that the process can be used on widely varying types of presses. It is also suitable, as will be illustrated by the solutions discussed, for use on multi-station presses and press lines. The stroke rate per minute is the same as in deep drawing...|$|E

40|$|AbstractClamping {{errors in}} {{workpiece}} positioning decrease the production outcome of machine tools by causing rejects. An automated monitoring of these failures {{does not take}} place in practice, due to limited installation space for the sensor integration, especially in series production. Within the Collaborative Research Centre 653, the IFW develops and investigates a condition and process monitoring system based on sensing clamping elements in close cooperation with two industrial partners, the companies Roemheld GmbH (clamping technology manufacturer) and ReiKam GmbH (fixture construction service provider). It consists of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>clamping</b> elements with integrated sensors, decentral electronics for signal preprocessing, bus communication and a central processing unit. Measureable quantities are hydraulic pressure, the clamping stroke and the process forces. This article describes the prototypical realization and shows its usability in condition and process monitoring.

40|$|Cost-effective lower-limb {{prostheses}} {{have been}} successful in restoring mobility, independence, and a way of life to millions of global amputees who do not have the means to afford more sophisticated prosthetics. Comprehensively, the current above knee (AK) prosthetic market is segmented into two extremes – very affordable relief style knees that offer basic functionality with high risk of accident due to falls, and very expensive styles that offer electronic microprocessor stumble control and adaptive cadence. There remains a gap for a middle-ground system that provides stumble control and greater stability within an achievable price bracket for the developing world. This project develops and tests a low-cost AK prosthetic with microprocessor stumble control. ^ The first phase of this study was the creation of the low-cost microprocessor knee using a combination of an existing polycentric four-bar relief knee and an Arduino-controlled <b>hydraulic</b> <b>clamping</b> mechanism. The system was created to mimic the natural motion and kinematics of a healthy limb by offering greater stability. The second phase was experimentally testing the prototype with patient trials, which compared walking and stumble control performance between the prototype, the polycentric four-bar LIMBS M 3 knee, and the Ottobock C-Leg. Two patients were selected for the trials that involved walking across force plates to analyze ground reaction forces during gait and during a simulated stumble trial with the prototype knee. ^ The results of the patient trial concluded that the prototyped microprocessor solution was successful in adding stance stability and stumble control, while also offering natural gait comparable to the gold standard C-Leg. The conclusions of this work can be incorporated into future development of the prototype with the addition of dynamic cadence control and expanded patient trials comparing the low-cost solution to other currently available high-end systems. ...|$|E
50|$|Milling {{operations}} tend {{to involve}} large, straight cuts that produce lots of chips and involve varying force. Locating and supporting areas must usually be large and very sturdy {{in order to}} accommodate milling operations; strong clamps are also a requirement. Due to the vibration of the machine, positive stops are preferred over friction for securing the workpiece. For high-volume automated processes, milling fixtures usually involve <b>hydraulic</b> or pneumatic <b>clamps.</b>|$|R
40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the impact of}} the use of mechanised equipment on physical load and workers' health among road workers and floor layers by comparing the traditional manual work method with frequently occurring scenarios of use of this new equipment. Continuous direct measurements of postures were linked to real-time observations of tasks and external forces applied during manual materials handling. A self-administered questionnaire on musculoskeletal complaints was used. The introduction of a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>clamp</b> or vacuum lift to assist roadmakers while laying a brick-paved road reduced the team's work time in a kneeling/squatting position with 43 - 52 % and frequency of lifting loads of 5 - 15 kg and above 15 kg with 46 - 59 % and 84 - 88 %, respectively. The introduction of a mixing machine with a pump system during pouring of sand-cement floors reduced the frequency of lifting loads with 66 % for 5 - 15 kg and 15 % for over 15 kg, but had no discernable effect oil awkward back postures. The use of a silo/truck with automated pump system also reduced the frequency of lifting with 32 % and 38 %, respectively, but increased the duration in awkward back postures with 13 %, primarily due to the hodman partly working as floor layer. Floor layers and hodmen using the mechanical equipment reported a lower prevalence of low back pain in the past 6 months and also less associated sick leave. The introduction of new mechanised equipment resulted in changes in physical load per task within jobs, changes in task distribution within jobs, and changes in work. organisation and jobs within a team. The judgement of experts on the impact of new devices on physical load should be corroborated in field studies on the average exposure to physical load per work day and per tea...|$|R

5000|$|Shortly {{before his}} death, John von Neumann headed the top secret von Neumann ICBM committee. Its {{purpose was to}} decide on the {{feasibility}} of building an ICBM large enough to carry a thermonuclear weapon. Von Neumann had long argued that while the technical obstacles were indeed formidable, they could be overcome in time. Events were proving him right. The weapons had become smaller, and diode-transistor logic enabled the construction of compact guidance computers. (Atlas A, B, C, and D had no onboard computers, but Atlas E (1960) and F (1961) did.) The committee approved a [...] "radical reorganization" [...] and speeding up of the Atlas program. Atlas was informally classified as a [...] "stage-and-a-half" [...] rocket; Both the central sustainer engine and the set of two booster engines were started at launch, each drawing from a single set of propellant tanks. At staging, the booster engines would be shut off and a series of mechanical and hydraulic mechanisms would close the plumbing lines to them. The booster section would then be released by a series of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>clamps</b> (aside from the early test model Atlas B which used explosive bolts) and slide off the missile. From there on, the sustainer and verniers would operate by themselves. Booster staging took place at roughly two minutes into launch, although the exact timing could vary considerably depending on the model of Atlas as well as the particular mission being flown. (A [...] "stage" [...] of a liquid propellant rocket is normally thought of as tanks and engine(s) together. The jettisoned engine, therefore, constitutes a [...] "half stage".) The booster engine consisted of two large thrust chambers. On the Atlas A/B/C, one turbopump assembly powered both booster engines. On the Atlas D, the booster engines had separate pump assemblies. On the Atlas E/F, each booster turbopump also got its own gas generator. Later space launcher variants of the Atlas used the MA-5 propulsion system with twin turbopumps on each booster engine, driven by a common gas generator. The boosters were more powerful than the sustainer engine and did most of the lifting for the first two minutes of flight. In addition to pitch and yaw control, they could also perform roll control {{in the event of a}} vernier failure. The sustainer engine on all Atlas variants consisted of a single thrust chamber with its own turbopump and gas generator, and two small pressure-fed vernier engines. The verniers provided roll control and final velocity trim. The total sea level thrust of all five thrust chambers was 360,000 lbf (1,600 kN) for a standard Atlas D. Atlas E/F had 375,000 pounds of thrust. Total sea level thrust for these three-engine Atlas Es and Fs was 389,000 lbf (1,730 kN). Space launcher variants of the Atlas often had performance enhancements to the engines.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{theoretical}} {{study has}} been made on the cam-clamping device. In this article, we consider specifically the calculations of cam geometry, calculations of clamping force and clamping torque, conditions for self-locking, and conditions for contact strength. Machine fixtures are essential {{in the process of}} mechanical manufacturing. There are many different types of fixtures, such as manual jig, pneumatic <b>clamps,</b> <b>hydraulic</b> fixtures, electric fixtures, etc. There are also many ways of clamping, such as incline clamp, screw clamp, eccentric circle clamp, hinge clamp [1], among which the eccentric circle clamp finds wide applications, especially in fast-clamping devices. Although the circular eccentric fixture possesses the advantages of simple structure, convenient manufacturing, and low cost, it suffers the drawbacks of small clamping force, short clamping-surface travel distance, and unreliable self-locking mechanism. The cam-clamping device discussesed in this article involves replaceing the eccentric circle with a cam, as shown in Fig. 1. The cam profile curve can be designed according to any requirements. The advantages of this replacement are obvious, in addition to preserving the advantages of the circular eccentric fixture, the cam-clamping can be designed according to the actual needs of clamping paths and selection of the appropriate cam profile to improve the self-locking...|$|R

In HyperMesh module, the finite element model was set up, ANSYS {{has been used in}} the finite element analysis of the {{clamping unit}} and the deformation and stress results were obtained. Based on the topology optimization of HyperWorks/OptiStruct, recommendations to improve the structure of the clamping mechanism are presented; the results showed that less material was used while its performance was maintained.
