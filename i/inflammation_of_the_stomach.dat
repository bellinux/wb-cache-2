2500|$|Gastric {{diseases}} {{refer to}} diseases affecting the stomach. <b>Inflammation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stomach</b> by infection from any cause is called gastritis, and when including {{other parts of}} the gastrointestinal tract called gastroenteritis. When gastritis persists in a chronic state, it is associated with several diseases, including atrophic gastritis, pyloric stenosis, and gastric cancer. Another common condition is gastric ulceration, peptic ulcers. Ulceration erodes the gastric mucosa, which protects the tissue of the stomach from the stomach acids. Peptic ulcers are most commonly caused by a bacterial Helicobacter pylori infection.|$|E
2500|$|Stoner was {{subsequently}} diagnosed with anemia and an <b>inflammation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stomach</b> lining. Stoner later disputed the diagnosis, however, and, after continuing {{to struggle with}} the condition, he announced on 10 August 2009 that he would miss rounds 11, 12 and 13 in Brno, Indianapolis and Misano, respectively, {{in an attempt to}} recover from the illness, subsequently diagnosed as lactose intolerance. Mika Kallio was chosen as Stoner's replacement for the three races. [...] Stoner returned to racing late in the 2009 season, placing second in the Portuguese Grand Prix and an emphatic first in the Australian Grand Prix, which he led throughout. [...] At interview following the Australian Grand Prix, Stoner said that he experienced none of the premature tiredness that had dogged him earlier in the 2009 season. He followed this up with another first place in the wet at the Malaysian Grand Prix. At the last round of 2009 at Valencia, Stoner dominated all practice and qualifying sessions to take pole, only to crash on cold tyres on the warm-up lap and miss the race. Stoner ended the season with four victories, and eight podiums in total, leading to a fourth-place finish in the riders' championship.|$|E

30|$|Another {{factor to}} {{consider}} is <b>the</b> position <b>of</b> Roux limb. R-Y reconstruction has become more popular in recent years, with the intention to avoid anastomotic leakage and reflux <b>inflammation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> remnant <b>stomach.</b> Recently, many reports prefer an antecolic figure for the Roux limb, which reduces the potential hernia sites from three to two, including Petersen defect after laparoscopic R-Y bypass reconstruction (Kojima et al. 2014). Antecolic position may be reasonable because <b>of</b> reduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mesocolon defect, which is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most common sites of herniation (Kojima et al. 2014). In contrast, retrocolic position {{is known to have}} a higher risk of internal herniation (Yoshikawa et al. 2014; Reiss and Garg 2014).

40|$|Optical biopsy’ or ‘optical diagnostics’ is a {{technique}} whereby light energy is used to obtain information about the structure and function of tissues without disrupting them. In fluorescence spectroscopy, light energy (usually provided by a laser) is used to excite tissues and the resulting fluorescence provides information about the target tissue. Its major gastrointestinal application has been in <b>the</b> evaluation <b>of</b> colonic polyps, in which it can reliably distinguish malignant from benign lesions. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) {{has been used in}} <b>the</b> investigation <b>of</b> Barrett’s epithelium (and dysplasia), although a variety of other applications are feasible. For example, OCT could assist in the identification and staging of mucosal and submucosal neoplasms, <b>the</b> grading <b>of</b> <b>inflammation</b> in <b>the</b> <b>stomach</b> and intestine, <b>the</b> diagnosis <b>of</b> biliary tumours and <b>the</b> assessment <b>of</b> villous architecture. OCT differs from endoscopic ultrasound, a complementary modality, in that it has a much higher resolution but lesser depth <b>of</b> penetration. <b>The</b> images correlate with <b>the</b> histopathological appearance <b>of</b> tissues, and <b>the</b> addition <b>of</b> Doppler methods may enable it to evaluate <b>the</b> vascularity <b>of</b> tumours and <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> blood flow in varices.

40|$|BACKGROUND Gastric {{disorders}} are one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most commonly encountered problems in clinical practice. A variety of disorders can affect <b>the</b> <b>stomach</b> and gastrointestinal tract. <b>The</b> definitive diagnosis <b>of</b> gastric disorders {{rests on the}} histopathological confirmation and is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> basis for planning proper treatment. OBJECTIVES To determine <b>the</b> spectrum <b>of</b> histopathological lesions of gastric region. To establish endoscopic biopsies as an effective tool in the proper diagnosis and management of various gastric lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective study {{was conducted on the}} gastric endoscopic biopsies and the histopathological assessment was done at <b>the</b> Department <b>of</b> Pathology, Osmania Medical College and Teaching Hospital from November 2014 to October 2015. RESULTS <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> total 87 cases of gastric biopsies, majority of cases were of male gender with a male-female ratio of 2. 4 : 1. Our study showed a poor correlation between endoscopic and histopathological evidence <b>of</b> <b>inflammation</b> in <b>the</b> <b>stomach.</b> Four cases were diagnosed as intestinal metaplasia which were diagnosed as ulcer and erosion endoscopically. Out of 23 number of cases diagnosed endoscopically as ulcer, only one case was confirmed histopathologically. Our study showed good correlation in <b>the</b> cases <b>of</b> carcinoma. All 38 cases diagnosed endoscopically as gastric carcinoma correlated histopathologically as gastric adenocarcinoma. Majority of carcinoma cases showed ulcerating fungating growth followed by ulceroproliferative growth. CONCLUSION In our study, the commonest site for endoscopic biopsy was from <b>the</b> <b>stomach</b> in which fundus region and antral region account the most. Most common neoplasm <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stomach</b> was adenocarcinoma. Endoscopy is incomplete without biopsy and histopathology is the gold standard for <b>the</b> diagnosis <b>of</b> endoscopically detected lesions. We, therefore, conclude that endoscopy is incomplete without biopsy and so <b>the</b> combination <b>of</b> methods provides a powerful diagnostic tool for better patient management...|$|R
40|$|International audienceStreptococcus macedonicus ACA-DC 198, a {{bacteriocin}} producer {{isolated from}} Greek Kasseri cheese, {{was used in}} a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments in order to evaluate its pathogenic potential. The strain was examined in vitro for haemolytic activity, antibiotic resistance and presence of pathogenicity genes encountered in Streptococcus pyogenes. Subsequently, the strain was orally administered to mice (8. 9 log cfu daily), continuously over a period of 12 weeks, in order to ascertain <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> its long term consumption on animal health and gastric inflammation. S. macedonicus ACA-DC 198 was found to be non-haemolytic and sensitive to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, streptomycin, tetracycline, and vancomycin, with the only resistance observed against kanamycin. PCR amplification and DNA-DNA hybridization did not reveal <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> S. pyogenes pathogenicity genes examined, namely emm, scpA, hasA, speB, smez 2, speJ, sagAB, hylA, ska, speF, speG, slo, hylP 2 and mga. In the mouse study, no detrimental effects were observed in the behaviour, general well being, weight gain and water consumption <b>of</b> <b>the</b> animals receiving S. macedonicus ACA-DC 198. Histologic analysis showed no evidence <b>of</b> <b>inflammation</b> in <b>the</b> <b>stomach</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> animals receiving S. macedonicus ACA-DC 198, while faecal microbiological analysis revealed that the strain retained its viability passing through the mouse gastrointestinal tract.
