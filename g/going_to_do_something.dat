5|$|The book {{identifies}} {{a corporate}} underpinning influencing public opinion {{by way of}} companies which derive profit from the fossil fuel industry. Washington and Cook write that politicians often use weasel words {{as a form of}} spin and propaganda, in order to act as if they are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> about climate change, while in actuality remaining passive on the issue. The authors go on to identify a greater level of denial— within the wider public itself. They argue that society enables denial of climate science through inaction and resistance to the scientific consensus. The authors conclude that if the public stopped denying climate change, the problem itself could realistically be significantly addressed.|$|E

Frankly, that I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> and that people who ... hopefully, when I'm done with my research, I'll be in the same ball park of knowledge about Steve Jobs that so many people in this room are.|$|E
500|$|Six {{years after}} {{cancellation}} of Police Squad!, the film [...] returned Nielsen to {{his role as}} Frank Drebin. It involved a ruthless drug king trying hypnosis to assassinate Queen Elizabeth II. Nielsen did many of his own stunts: [...] "You {{have an idea of}} how you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something,</b> and it's your vision... unless you do it, it really doesn't stand a chance." [...] This movie grossed over $78million and was well received by critics. Ebert's 3½–star review (out of four) noted, [...] "You laugh, and then you laugh at yourself for laughing." ...|$|E

60|$|Bob had, {{after his}} return from his cruise, fallen into his former habits; {{spending}} two hours every morning with Don Diaz, and reading {{for an hour or}} two in the evening with the doctor. It was now cool enough for exercise and enjoyment, in the day; and there were few afternoons when he did not climb up to the top of the Rock, and watch the Spanish soldiers labouring at their batteries, and wondering when they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> begin <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something.</b>|$|R

As a result of what Liz said, Kenneth breaks the fourth wall, a term used when a character in a television show, film or on stage directly addresses the audience, when he glances down at the logo.|$|E
500|$|Irving {{was dismayed}} by the storyline which saw Meyer shot in a road rage incident, {{describing}} filming the scenes as an [...] "unpleasant experiences", the worst aspect being that Meyer loses his spleen {{as a result of}} his injuries. Of the later storyline which sees Meyer investigated by Tom Campbell-Gore on behalf of the hospital Board, Denis Lawson explained: [...] " [...] actually rather fancies Meyer's job but if he finds against him in the investigation he cannot get the job because it's a conflict of interest. So he has to play a rather clever game, which he does." [...] On taking over as head of the cardiothoracic surgery department, he commented: [...] "George is fantastic in the show, but obviously I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> very, very different, so I don't feel that I'm stepping into his shoes." ...|$|E
500|$|Gjokaj {{was cast}} in the role in August 2014. [...] "He was a soldier, {{and he had been}} very active all his life, and now he has {{to figure out how to}} use his brains, how to try to be smart," [...] Gjokaj {{explained}} of the character. [...] "He accepts his injury, he accepts his compromised status in society ... Peggy says, 'Forget this. I'm Peggy Carter. I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> else.' I think that's the difference between the two of them." [...] Considering a potentially romantic relationship between Sousa and Carter, Gjokaj said, [...] "I think there’s definitely a situation where … if she hadn't dated Captain America, he might ask her out for a drink. It’s like if your new girlfriend dated Ryan Gosling. It’s going to make you sweat a bit." [...] For the second season, Gjokaj said, [...] "you’ll see him deal with actually being part of the machine. Not trying to get [...] the machine, but being the boss. The first season was him trying to be listened to, and now he’s being listened to by a lot of people." [...] The costumes for the SSR agents in the series are meant to be distinctive to help explain their characters: Sousa wears [...] "sweater vests under his sport coats and pleated pants".|$|E

500|$|Later that day, Solanas turned herself in, {{gave up her}} gun, and {{confessed to}} the shooting, telling a police officer that Warhol [...] "had too much control in my life." [...] She was {{fingerprinted}} and charged with felonious assault and possession of a deadly weapon. The next morning, the New York Daily News ran a front page headline stating: [...] "Actress Shoots Andy Warhol." [...] Solanas demanded a retraction of the statement {{that she was an}} actress. The Daily News changed the headline in its later edition and added a quote from Solanas stating [...] "I'm a writer, not an actress." [...] At her arraignment in Manhattan Criminal Court she denied shooting Warhol because he wouldn't produce her play but said [...] "it was for the opposite reason", that [...] "he has a legal claim on my works." [...] Solanas told the judge that [...] "it's not often that I shoot somebody. I didn't do it for nothing. Warhol had tied me up, lock, stock, and barrel. He was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> to me which would have ruined me." [...] She told the judge she wanted to represent herself and she declared that she [...] "was right in what I did! I have nothing to regret!" [...] "The judge struck her comments from the court record" [...] and had her admitted to Bellevue Hospital for psychiatric observation.|$|E
500|$|Furlan {{is said to}} {{have asked}} for her {{character}} to be written out of the series because {{she did not want to}} travel to Hawaii to film her scenes, although she later called this an untrue rumor. [...] The producers decided for Rousseau to be shot, with the possibility of her returning in season five. [...] Co-show runners and executive producers Damon Lindelof and Cuse originally intended for Rousseau to get her own flashback episode in season four, however as a result of the Writer's Strike, this did not come to pass. When asked whether Rousseau would have a flashback in season five, Lindelof said that Rousseau's story would [...] "definitively" [...] be revealed, but that [...] "to use the word flashback would be disingenuous". Cuse revealed that they were trying to steer away from the word flashback and were [...] "embracing a whole new word". He explained that [...] "there will still [...] be flashbacks and flash-forwards on the show, but we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> different this year. We're going to mix it up." [...] Instead of using flashbacks and flashforwards like in previous seasons, stories of the fifth season will play out both on and off the island stories in different points in time. The writers were supposedly scheduling an appearance by Furlan for the fifth season, but Furlan did not end up making an appearance. [...] However, she returns in the form of Rousseau's [...] "sideways" [...] counterpart (who never crashed on the Island, lost Alex or went insane) in the sixth season.|$|E

40|$|Frankfurt {{sets out}} to refute the {{principle}} according to which ‘a person is morally responsible for {{what he has done}} only if he could have done otherwise’. Frankfurt devises a counterexample in which an agent is intuitively responsible even though she could not have done otherwise: Suppose someone – Black, let us say – wants Jones to perform a certain action. Black is prepared to go to considerable lengths to get his way, but he prefers to avoid showing his hand unnecessarily. So he waits until Jones is about to make up his mind what <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and he does nothing unless it is clear to him that Jones is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> decide <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> other than what he wants him <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> If it does become clear that Jones is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> decide <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> else, Black takes effective steps to ensure that Jones decides <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and that he does do, what he wants him <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Whatever Jones's initial preferences and inclinations, then, Black will have his way … Now suppose that Black never has to show his hand because Jones, for reasons of his own, decides <b>to</b> perform and <b>does</b> perform the very action Black wants him to perform. In that case, it seems clear, Jones will bear precisely...|$|R

2500|$|In the {{documentary}} Last of the Gladiators, Knievel discussed {{the crash of}} a 1970 Pepsi-Cola sponsored jump in Yakima, Washington. Knievel knew the jump was very questionable, but stated, [...] "I went ahead and did it anyway.

He stated that [...] "Serbia is not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> that is against our interest, because we are defending out territorial integrity and sovereignty by using international law" [...] and that by constitution he must defend the interests of Serbia, and not the interests of {{any other country in the}} world.|$|E

In an {{interview}} in August 2010 he noted {{that he did not}} have a new script yet, but [...] "It's plotted out in my mind's eye." [...] On April 18, 2011, Stallone confirmed that he would not be repeating his directing duties in The Expendables, making a list of directors to serve as his replacement. In April 2011, the film was given a scheduled release date of August 17, 2012 and a teaser poster for the film was released at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival.

40|$|There {{are lots}} of unhappy sheep farmers at the moment. A season that gave promise of {{providing}} better prices than last year has spiralled down into the gloomy depths. Most farmers seem ready to blame the meat companies {{but many of the}} problems arise elsewhere. The current exchange rates are hugely problematic for exporting industries, but even that is not the total answer. Farmers too have got {{to take some of the}} responsibility for the position the industry is in. And farmers are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> about it themselves if they want things to improve. Of course there is nothing that individual farmers can do about exchange rates. That is up to Government. So somehow, farmers have got to make the best of it until the wheel turns in their favour. Or is there something that farmers can do? What is actually wrong with the meat industry that can be improved...|$|R
2500|$|On March 10, 2004 Lindner {{complained that}} critics of his remarks were not {{focusing}} on the real motives of his bill and his speech. He said [...] "that homosexuality, the rise in sexually transmitted diseases, and comprehensive sexual health education could prompt a future 'holocaust' in Minnesota". On the House floor he said, [...] "hat I am trying to prevent is the holocaust of our children getting STDs, AIDS, and various other diseases {{that are going to}} affect their lives. If you want to sit around here and wait until America becomes another African continent, well, then, you do that, but I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> about it."

He also claimed that, other than being told to [...] "just keep people off the stage", Cutler gave the Hells Angels very little specific instructions for stage security: [...] "They didn't say nothing to us about any of that."

As she turned in, she looked down the road; but the men were not in sight. What she was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was <b>something</b> which people never did, but {{it was the only thing}} she could think of, and she was a girl whose actions were as quick as her ideas were original.

2500|$|Nancy {{does not}} tell Darren that she is helping Mitzeee, which Fox told a {{reporter}} from What's on TV is because [...] "Darren is so focused on the baby that if she told him he'd be really angry. Nancy feels he doesn't understand the relationship she has with Mitzeee and he hasn't been terribly supportive". When questioned if Nancy feels her involvement with Mitzeee may place strain on the baby, Fox answered: [...] "At the moment she feels incredibly tired, but she's sure that everything's fine and all she {{needs to do is}} focus on her friend". Darren discovers Nancy is helping Mitzeee, making him [...] "absolutely furious" [...] as he can not believe Nancy is [...] "going against the law, is running around and getting stressed - especially while she's heavily pregnant". When urged to put their child first by Darren, Nancy dismisses him as she believes he is [...] "just being silly". Fox said that [...] "Nancy thinks she knows best, as Nancy always does", adding that Nancy is [...] "a bit like a dog with a bone.

[...] The letter was also released directly to the press to ensure it could not be [...] "delayed." [...] With the letter delivered, a deal was on the table. However, as Robert Kennedy noted, there was little expectation it would be accepted. At 9:00pm EDT, the EXCOMM met again to review the actions for the following day. Plans were drawn up for air strikes on the missile sites as well as other economic targets, notably petroleum storage.

But my point is what's worse – them ordering it and it happening, or them not ordering it and it happening? And so we will continue to protect our troops. ... to say it [...] is provoking Iran is just a wrong way to characterize the Commander-in-Chief's decision to do what is necessary to protect our soldiers in harm's way. And I will continue to do so. ... Whether Ahmadinejad ordered the Quds force to do this, I don't think we know. But we do know that they're there, and I intend to do something about it. And I've asked our commanders to do something about it. And we're going to protect our troops. ... I don't think we know who {{picked up the phone and}} said to the Quds Force, go do this, but we know it's a vital part of the Iranian government. …What matters is, is that we're responding. The idea that somehow we're manufacturing the idea that the Iranians are providing IEDs is preposterous. ... My job is to protect our troops.
