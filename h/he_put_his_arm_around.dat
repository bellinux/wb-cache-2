60|$|<b>He</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> her shoulders, and the {{strength}} of it seemed to calm her.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> her {{and led her}} to an oak bench {{near the}} big fireplace.|$|E
60|$|So saying, <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> her, {{and half}} leading, half carrying, {{took her to}} her room.|$|E
60|$|Vexed with himself, <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> round her, {{and they}} set off home.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> {{around her}} and drew her head close to his. Their lips met.|$|R
60|$|Kennicott was {{masculine}} and experimental. He stroked Vida's hand, <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> carelessly about her shoulder.|$|R
60|$|She {{came to him}} as {{a little}} child comes to its mother, and <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> her.|$|E
6000|$|... ... <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> Julia. Presently {{she asked}} him if [...] he would remove his arm. He {{immediately}} did so, with a smile.|$|E
60|$|Toby's joy knew no bounds; <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> {{the monkey}}'s neck, and the monkey clung firmly to him, until even Job Lord was touched at the {{evidence}} of affection between the two.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> {{about her}} and kissed her, his eyes dim with a new and {{softening}} emotion.|$|R
60|$|As <b>he</b> spoke <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> proudly {{round her}} waist {{and looked at her}} with admiring eyes.|$|R
60|$|She {{flushed with}} pleasure. As she passed {{him with the}} tea, <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> about her waist.|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> {{her waist}} and helped her out, and did not put her down till they reached the road. She was {{completely}} dressed, even to her hat and shoes, but she mourned: ...|$|E
6000|$|Then, as <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> her, {{she held}} up her lips to be kissed. [...] "And we'll be happy again-happy as we deserve, I s'pose," [...] she said with a smile and a sigh.|$|E
60|$|And for {{the first}} time in many months <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> Dolores. At first she stiffened, the fright and {{nervousness}} still in her eyes. But then suddenly she relaxed against him and there were tears wetting her cheeks.|$|E
60|$|Afterwards, {{when the}} Vicar was shut {{up in his}} study with the curate, <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> round her waist.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Shelby {{ran to the}} door. As George met her <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> round her, {{and kissed}} her tenderly.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> {{about her}} neck and hugged her, as a child might have hugged {{one of his own}} dolls.|$|R
6000|$|All {{this now}} {{happened}} to Lawrence. Never before had {{he looked into}} the eyes of a woman who loved him; and, leaning over towards this one, <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> her and drew her towards him. [...] "And never shall you be alone," [...] he said.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hello, Majesty!" [...] And as <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> her {{he turned}} toward a massive man whose broad, craggy face began to ripple and wrinkle. [...] "I want to {{introduce}} my friend Stillwell to you. Bill, this is my sister, the sister I've so often told you about--Majesty." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> {{her almost}} timidly {{and kissed her}} on the cheek, a great love for her {{springing}} up in his heart. [...] "That setties it," [...] he said. [...] "Don't cry, Jalyie. You'll never be sorry for it. Don't cry. It kind o' hurts me to see it." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> round her, {{and they}} sat {{a long time}} with their cheeks pressed together, not {{speaking}} a word.|$|R
60|$|Her full heart {{broke into}} tears again. <b>He</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> about her waist, {{and they walked}} by the river-side together.|$|R
60|$|He did {{not answer}} directly. <b>He</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> about her {{shoulder}} again, so that she was obliged to turn round.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, mother!" [...] Gale {{could say}} no more. He did not {{comprehend}} a mood seemingly so utterly {{at variance with}} Mrs. Belding's habitual temperament. But <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> her. In another moment she had gained command over herself, and, kissing him, she pushed {{him out of the}} door.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> her {{and kissed}} her cheek in his frank delight at seeing her again. Alma coldly asked him in. Her face was still as pale as when she came downstairs, but a curious little spot of fiery red blossomed out where Gilbert's lips had touched it.|$|E
60|$|She {{laughed and}} took his hand as he dragged a chair over to her side. <b>He</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> her and her head fell {{naturally}} back upon his shoulder. Her eyes sought his. He was leaning forward, gazing down between the curving line of lamp-posts, across the belt of black river with its flecks of yellow light. But Ruth watched him only.|$|E
60|$|Felix did {{not quite}} know what to answer, so <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> within <b>his</b> brother's. Tod drew him toward the tree.|$|R
60|$|It was {{a minute}} or two before the lamp came. <b>He</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> upon my shoulder, leaning upon me {{somewhat}} heavily.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> {{round her}} neck, and she <b>put</b> hers round <b>his</b> waist, and twined {{together}} in this way, they went upstairs.|$|R
6000|$|... "No. I didn't say {{anything}} about leaving you." [...] <b>He</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> her. [...] "I'm {{not that kind of}} a man. You and I were built for each other--I felt that on that first ride. I guess it's up to me to take you out of this." [...] He broke off his emotional utterance and grew keen and alert.|$|E
60|$|Smoke {{checked his}} speech. That {{she had been}} {{arranging}} his escape was surprise enough, but that she had planned {{to go with him}} was more than he was prepared for. Unable to think immediate action, he gently, one by one, took her burdens from her. <b>He</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> her and pressed her close, and still he could not think what to do.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Brown {{met him at}} the door; and {{she looked}} so good and motherly, and there was such a {{peculiar}} wistful look in her eyes, that <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> her in a sudden impulse and kissed her. It made her lips tremble, and she was obliged to wipe her glasses before she could see him clearly. Supper was on the table for him, and she made him sit right down.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It is no bad news,' was <b>his</b> greeting, as <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> {{round her}} {{trembling}} little figure {{and kissed her}} brow. 'Only too good.' ...|$|R
60|$|The {{tears came}} to <b>his</b> eyes, and <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> around her neck. He nestled against her heart {{as a child}} might have done.|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> {{round her}} with rough fondness. [...] "I would {{sacrifice}} every friend I {{have in the}} world rather than lose you. Come along!" ...|$|R
