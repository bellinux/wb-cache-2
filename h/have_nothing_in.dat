Obviously what we call 'resemblance' involves different aspects in each particular case. It is also seen to be of a different 'degree' and here it fades with 'distance': Item_1 and Item_5 <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> common.|$|E

25|$|As {{the term}} alphasyllabary suggests, abugidas have been {{considered}} an intermediate step between alphabets and syllabaries. Historically, abugidas appear to have evolved from abjads (vowelless alphabets). They contrast with syllabaries, {{where there is a}} distinct symbol for each syllable or consonant-vowel combination, and where these have no systematic similarity to each other, and typically develop directly from logographic scripts. Compare the Devanagari examples above to sets of syllables in the Japanese hiragana syllabary: か ka, き ki, く ku, け ke, こ ko <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> common to indicate k; while ら ra, り ri, る ru, れ re, ろ ro have neither anything in common for r, nor anything to indicate that they have the same vowels as the k set.|$|E

500|$|The Progress Party was {{originally}} inspired by its Danish counterpart, the Progress Party, which ultimately declined, lost parliamentary representation, {{and fell into}} the fringes of Danish politics. In recent years, the Norwegian party has rather considered Denmark's Venstre to be its sister party. Formally, Venstre is aligned with the Norwegian Liberal Party, and as late as 2006 the international secretary of Venstre said that [...] "we <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> common with the Norwegian Progress Party". In 2009 however, the prominent Venstre MP Inger Støjberg gave her support for the Progress Party, saying there were [...] "great similarities" [...] between the parties, and that Venstre stood [...] "shoulder to shoulder" [...] with the Progress Party, although this position was not supported by Venstre's party chairman Lars Løkke Rasmussen.|$|E

[...] Further, {{the court ruled}} that [...] "The 'Kong' and 'King Kong' names are widely used by the general public and are associated with apes and other objects of enormous proportions." [...] As for Universal's survey, the court found it unconvincing, as Universal did not own the [...] "image [...] [...] [...] of King Kong climbing the Empire State Building/World Trade Center with Fay Wray/Jessica Lange in his paw" [...] and that by only soliciting opinions from people who already had Donkey Kong games, the survey failed to establish confusion from potential customers. Finally, the survey asked [...] "an obvious leading question in that it suggested its own answer." ...|$|E
500|$|Further {{allegations}} that Elizabeth used racist slurs {{to refer to}} black people were strongly denied by Major Colin Burgess. Major Burgess was the husband of Elizabeth Burgess, a mixed-race secretary who accused members of the Prince of Wales's Household of racial abuse. Queen Elizabeth made no public comments on race, but according to Robert Rhodes James in private she [...] "abhorred racial discrimination" [...] and decried apartheid as [...] "dreadful". Woodrow Wyatt records in his diary that when he expressed the view that non-white countries <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> common with [...] "us", she told him, [...] "I am very keen on the Commonwealth. They're all like us." [...] However, she did distrust Germans; she told Woodrow Wyatt, [...] "Never trust them, never trust them." [...] While she may have held such views, {{it has been argued}} that they were normal for British people of her generation and upbringing, who had experienced two vicious wars with Germany.|$|E

500|$|Several English and American {{paintings}} including The Death of Major Pierson by John Singleton Copley (1738–1815)—also painted {{within two}} years of the event—had established a precedent for a contemporary subject. Copley had also painted several large and heroic depictions of disasters at sea which Géricault may have known from prints: Watson and the Shark (1778), in which a black man is central to the action, and which, like The Raft of the Medusa, concentrated on the actors of the drama rather than the seascape; The Defeat of the Floating Batteries at Gibraltar, September 1782 (1791), which was an influence on both the style and subject matter of Géricault's work; and [...] (1790s), which has a strikingly similar composition. A further important precedent for the political component was the works of Francisco Goya, particularly his The Disasters of War series of 1810–12, and his 1814 masterpiece The Third of May 1808. Goya also produced a painting of a disaster at sea, called simply Shipwreck (date unknown), but although the sentiment is similar, the composition and style <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> common with The Raft of the Medusa. It is unlikely that Géricault had seen the picture.|$|E
2500|$|Kirk called libertarians [...] "chirping sectaries", quoting T. S. Eliot, {{and said}} that they and conservatives <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> common.

[...] He put libertarians in the latter category.|$|E
2500|$|An {{outgrowth}} of the struggles of the Western Federation of Miners (WFM), the IWW also adopted the WFM's description of the AFL as the [...] "American Separation of Labor". While the IWW shared {{the concept of a}} mass-oriented labor movement—what the IWW would call One Big Union—with the Knights of Labor, the idea of workers having much in common with employers was discarded by the IWW, whose Preamble declares that [...] "the working class and the employing class <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> common." ...|$|E

2500|$|Its final {{redaction}} probably {{belongs to}} the end of the 4th century, but the individual scholars who brought it to its present form cannot be fixed with assurance. By this time Christianity had become the state religion of the Roman Empire and Jerusalem the holy city of Christendom. In 325, Constantine the Great, the first Christian emperor, said [...] "let us then <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> common with the detestable Jewish crowd." [...] This policy made a Jew an outcast and pauper. The compilers of the Jerusalem Talmud consequently lacked the time to produce a work of the quality they had intended.
