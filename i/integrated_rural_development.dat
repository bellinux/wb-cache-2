He declined the offer {{on the grounds that}} the proposals were predominantly motivated by political interests rather than the common well-being. However, he continued to advise the authorities on various aspects of rural development, such as participatory irrigation management. He worked as a research fellow at the University of Agriculture, Faisalabad from 1971 to 1972, and as Director of Rural Economics Research Project at Karachi University from 1972 to 1973. Khan went to Michigan State University as a visiting professor in 1973 and remained there until 1979. During this time, he carried on advising the Rural Development Academy at Bogra in northern Bangladesh, and the Pakistan Academy for Rural Development, Peshawar, on the Daudzai <b>Integrated</b> <b>Rural</b> <b>Development</b> Programme. He also traveled extensively during this period in the capacities of speaker, advisor, or consultant on rural development programmes across the world. In 1974, he was appointed as a World Bank consultant to survey rural development situations in Java, Indonesia. He also briefly worked as a visiting professor at Lund University, Harvard University, and Oxford University.|$|E

Recommendations and guidance to policy making are proposed. The case studies presented cover 1) the use of visual assessment techniques to support landscape planning in rural areas; 2) participative applications of landscape assessment techniques in peri-urban areas; 3) multi-scale approaches to landscape management in Alpine areas; and 4) the application of landscape economic evaluation to foster <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> strategie...|$|R
40|$|Various {{programmes}} {{and strategies}} in South Africa aim to reduce poverty. The <b>Integrated</b> Sustainable <b>Rural</b> <b>Development</b> Programme (ISRDP) is a sustained campaign against rural poverty and underdevelopment, implemented in 13 nodes selected {{on account of}} their poverty, lack of infrastructure and capacity, and provincial representivity. Using a hierarchy of development regions, data from the 2001 Census and a core-periphery model, this paper evaluates {{the location of the}} 13 nodes to determine whether the municipalities in these nodes have high levels of poverty and are in need of development. The findings are that although most of these municipalities have high poverty levels, the nodes also include municipalities with relatively high levels of development. There are also 17 municipalities in South Africa with very low levels of development that are not included as nodes in the ISRDP.

He promoted private sector development, exports growth and the reversing of the collectivisation of farms. His government reduced quotas and restrictions on agriculture and industrial activities.

30|$|Stemming {{from the}} 1988 reform of {{structural}} funds, several LEADER programmes have developed continuously, undergoing various adjustments and growing in {{importance in the}} scope of rural policies, until they became <b>integrated</b> in <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> programmes {{in the past and}} in the current period. This was done without changing the basic methodological principle to which the specific ‘LEADER added value’ is attributed: bottom-up approach, territorial and <b>integrated</b> approach to <b>rural</b> <b>development,</b> public-private partnership in local action groups (LAGs), territorial networking and transnational cooperation to stimulate rural innovation processes. In other words, LEADER is a “network policy” {{in the sense that it}} looks at different types of networks with a multi-purpose intent. Firstly, at the ‘social’ network, which addresses the intangible factor of development through reinforcing the sense of local identity of the rural population, as well as the external image of the territory. This boosts marketing of local products (Ray 1998), because in LEADER a thread connects the sociological entity ‘community’ and the geographical entity ‘territory’ “that can be linked with an identifiable cultural heritage and identity” (Lee et al. 2005 : 275), as can the socio-economic entity ‘social capital’. Secondly, the ‘horizontal’ network, as Murdoch (2000) put it, “linked to more general and also non-agricultural processes”, which aims at <b>integrated</b> <b>development</b> of <b>rural</b> economy in a defined area. Thirdly, the ‘vertical’ network, which links actors of a specific area because of their involvement in the agro-food sector (Murdoch 2000).|$|R

40|$|The {{contribution}} of government, non-governmental organisations {{and the private}} sector towards <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> has surfaced in many forms during the different <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> experiences since the 1950 s. The South African Government’s <b>Integrated</b> Sustainable <b>Rural</b> <b>Development</b> Programme (ISRDP) is characterised by a notable emphasis for intensified stakeholder participation in <b>rural</b> <b>development.</b> The ISRDP established certain principles that impact on the level of stakeholder mobilisation for the programme. This study aims to explore the level and nature of stakeholder engagement in the implementation of the ISRDP. The experiences by selected nodes (municipalities) on these stakeholder relationships are explored. The involvement of the three spheres of government, the private sector, the community, funders and other partners is also discussed. The results of the study indicate that stakeholder mobilisation for the ISRDP in the nodal municipalities has not reached its maximum level in terms of the integration of existing <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> projects, resource mobilisation, community participation, and communication. Arguments of why this is happening and recommendations to improve the situation are provided.
