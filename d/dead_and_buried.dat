25|$|In 2000 {{a strong}} economy, falling unemployment, {{and the impact}} of the Internet {{appeared}} to breathe new life into the “Swedish model” of a welfare society, one that had seemed <b>dead</b> <b>and</b> <b>buried</b> during the deep recession of the early 1990s: growth reached 4%, and unemployment fell to the lowest level in years. The Social Democrats, however, failed to capitalize on the economic boom. Opinion polls showed the party struggling to return to its post-election 36% approval level. Instead, the smaller Left Party, a Social Democrat ally, picked up support with its program of increased public spending and opposition to Swedish membership in the European single currency.|$|E

[...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times gave the film two out of five stars, saying [...] "The film does have a fairy-tale aspect, but, like many of its characters, it is more <b>dead</b> <b>and</b> <b>buried</b> than fully alive."

[...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film three and a half stars out of five, saying [...] "In the guise of a family film, Burton evokes a darkly erotic obsession that recalls Edgar Allan Poe and Hitchcock's Vertigo.

2500|$|On 7 November, David Ben-Gurion {{addressed}} the Knesset and declared a great victory, {{saying that the}} 1949 armistice agreement with Egypt was <b>dead</b> <b>and</b> <b>buried,</b> and that the armistice lines were no longer valid {{and could not be}} restored. Under no circumstances would Israel agree to the stationing of UN forces on its territory or in any area it occupied. He also made an oblique reference to his intention to annex the Sinai Peninsula. Isaac Alteras writes that Ben-Gurion 'was carried away by the resounding victory against Egypt' and while 'a statesman well known for his sober realism, [...] took flight in dreams of grandeur.' The speech marked the beginning of a four-month-long diplomatic struggle, culminating in withdrawal from all territory, under conditions far less palatable than those envisioned in the speech, but with conditions for sea access to Eilat and a UNEF presence on Egyptian soil. The speech immediately drew increased international pressure on Israel to withdraw. That day in New York, the emergency session passed Resolution 1002, again calling for the immediate withdrawal of Israeli troops to behind the armistice lines, and for the immediate withdrawal of British and French troops from Egyptian territory. After a long Israeli cabinet meeting late on 8 November, Ben-Gurion informed Eisenhower that Israel declared its willingness to accept withdrawal of Israeli forces from Sinai, 'when satisfactory arrangements are made with the international force that is about to enter the canal zone'.|$|E
