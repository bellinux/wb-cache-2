5|$|Gamma ray {{astronomy}} observes astronomical objects at {{the shortest}} wavelengths {{of the electromagnetic}} spectrum. <b>Gamma</b> <b>rays</b> may be observed directly by satellites such as the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory or by specialized telescopes called atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes. The Cherenkov telescopes do not detect the <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> directly but instead detect the flashes of visible light produced when <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> are absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Gamma ray telescopes {{collect and}} measure individual, high energy <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> from astrophysical sources. These are {{absorbed by the}} atmosphere, {{requiring}} that observations are done by high-altitude balloons or space missions. <b>Gamma</b> <b>rays</b> can be generated by supernovae, neutron stars, pulsars and black holes. Gamma ray bursts, with extremely high energies, have also been detected but {{have yet to be}} identified.|$|E
5|$|M87 is a {{very strong}} source of <b>gamma</b> <b>rays,</b> which are the most {{energetic}} rays of the electromagnetic spectrum. <b>Gamma</b> <b>rays</b> coming from M87 have been observed since the late 1990s, but in 2006, using the High Energy Stereoscopic System Cherenkov telescopes, scientists have measured the variations of the gamma ray flux coming from M87, and found that the flux changes over a matter of days. This short period makes the immediate vicinity of the supermassive black hole in M87 the most promising source for these <b>gamma</b> <b>rays.</b> In general, the smaller the diameter of the emission source, the faster the variation in flux, and vice versa.|$|E

40|$|Short <b>gamma</b> <b>ray</b> bursts {{have been}} {{observed}} a variety of galaxies types with varying angular offsets from the centre of their host galaxies. To investigate the properties of short <b>gamma</b> <b>ray</b> burst offsets, a sample of short <b>gamma</b> <b>ray</b> bursts with host galaxies has been gathered. Two formation channels proposed to explain the observed offsets of short <b>gamma</b> <b>ray</b> bursts from their host galaxies are discussed. The classification of short <b>gamma</b> <b>ray</b> bursts into these formation channels is demonstrated for short <b>gamma</b> <b>ray</b> bursts with host galaxies. The possibility of faint dwarf galaxies as host environments for the observed short <b>gamma</b> <b>ray</b> bursts is also investigated. However, by extrapolating the distribution of dwarf galaxies around the Milky Way to redshifts corresponding to the short <b>gamma</b> <b>ray</b> bursts, we show that {{it is unlikely that}} dwarf galaxies are the hosts of short <b>gamma</b> <b>ray</b> bursts.

5|$|This remnant (RX J0852.0-4622) {{had been}} found in front (apparently) of the larger Vela Supernova Remnant. The <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> from the decay of titanium-44 showed that it must have {{exploded}} fairly recently (perhaps around 1200 AD), but there is no historical record of it. The flux of <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> and x-rays indicates that the supernova was relatively close to us (perhaps 200 parsecs or 600 ly).

5|$|Cobalt-60 (Co-60 or 60Co) {{is useful}} as a gamma ray source {{because it can be}} {{produced}} in predictable quantity and high activity by bombarding cobalt with neutrons. It produces two <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> with energies of 1.17 and 1.33MeV.|$|E
5|$|The 169Yb isotope (with a {{half-life}} of 32 days), {{which is}} created {{along with the}} short-lived 175Yb isotope (half-life 4.2 days) by neutron activation during the irradiation of ytterbium in nuclear reactors, {{has been used as}} a radiation source in portable X-ray machines. Like X-rays, the <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> emitted by the source pass through soft tissues of the body, but are blocked by bones and other dense materials. Thus, small 169Yb samples (which emit <b>gamma</b> <b>rays)</b> act like tiny X-ray machines useful for radiography of small objects. Experiments show that radiographs taken with a 169Yb source are roughly equivalent to those taken with X-rays having energies between 250 and 350keV. 169Yb is also used in nuclear medicine.|$|E
5|$|The {{experiment}} was suggested on 1 November 1943 by Robert Serber. The {{idea was to}} measure the spatial and temporal symmetry of explosive compression of a metal sphere. The test measured changes of absorption of <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> in the metal of the sphere as it underwent compression. The gamma ray source was located {{in the center of}} a metal sphere. The increase of thickness (of hollow shells) and density (of solid spheres) as the compression progressed was detected as a decrease of intensity of <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> outside of the sphere; the lower density explosives did not absorb gamma radiation enough to interfere with the experiment. The <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> had to be intense and of the right energy. Too low energy, and they would be fully absorbed in the surrounding metal; too high energy and the difference of attenuation during the implosion would be too low to be practical. The detectors had to provide high speed and large area; fast ionization chambers, then under development, were the only devices then available satisfying the requirements.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of the time 210Po decays by emission of an alpha particle only, not by emission of an alpha particle and a <b>gamma</b> <b>ray.</b> About one in 100,000 decays results in the emission of a <b>gamma</b> <b>ray.</b> This low <b>gamma</b> <b>ray</b> production rate {{makes it more difficult}} to find and identify this isotope. Rather than <b>gamma</b> <b>ray</b> spectroscopy, alpha spectroscopy is the best method of measuring this isotope.|$|R
40|$|<b>Gamma</b> <b>ray</b> {{emission}} {{was detected}} {{from the radio}} pulsars PSR 1818 - 04 and PSR 1747 - 46, {{in addition to the}} previously reported <b>gamma</b> <b>ray</b> emission from the Crab and Vela pulsars. Because the Crab pulsar is the only one observed in the optical and X-ray bands, these <b>gamma</b> <b>ray</b> observations suggest a uniquely <b>gamma</b> <b>ray</b> phenomenon occurring in a fraction of the radio pulsars. PSR 1818 - 04 has a <b>gamma</b> <b>ray</b> luminosity comparable to that of the Crab pulsar, whereas the luminosities of PSR 1747 - 46 and the Vela pulsar are approximately an order of magnitude lower. SAS- 2 data for pulsar correlations yielded upper limits to <b>gamma</b> <b>ray</b> luminosity for 71 other radio pulsars. For five of the closest pulsars, upper limits for <b>gamma</b> <b>ray</b> luminosity are found to be at least three orders of magnitude lower than that of the Crab pulsar. <b>Gamma</b> <b>ray</b> enhancement near the Milky Way satellite galaxy and the galactic plane in the Cygnus region is also discussed...|$|R
40|$|<b>Gamma</b> <b>ray</b> {{detection}} in {{the energy}} region above 1 keV involves measurements of the energy exchange or energy loss between the <b>gamma</b> <b>ray</b> and {{the mass of the}} detector. In most cases of interest, it is the kinetic energy imparted to charged particles by the <b>gamma</b> <b>ray</b> which is lost in the detector and measured in order to obtain spectral knowledge between the incident <b>gamma</b> <b>ray</b> photon and the direction of the secondary particles contains important energy information. The interaction <b>gamma</b> <b>ray</b> removal processes in matter are considered. This interaction removal process is characterized by the fact that each <b>gamma</b> <b>ray</b> is removed individually from the incident beam. The number of photons removed in this manner is proportional to the thickness of matter traversed...|$|R
5|$|Americium-241 {{has been}} used as a {{portable}} source of both <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> and alpha particles for a number of medical and industrial uses. The 59.5409keV gamma ray emissions from 241Am in such sources can be used for indirect analysis of materials in radiography and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, as well as for quality control in fixed nuclear density gauges and nuclear densometers. For example, the element has been employed to gauge glass thickness to help create flat glass. Americium-241 is also suitable for calibration of gamma-ray spectrometers in the low-energy range, since its spectrum consists of nearly a single peak and negligible Compton continuum (at least three orders of magnitude lower intensity). Americium-241 <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> were also used to provide passive diagnosis of thyroid function. This medical application is however obsolete.|$|E
