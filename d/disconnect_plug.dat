50|$|Atlas D {{tests on}} the West Coast hit a series of snags in the {{following}} months as well. Atlas 25D had flown successfully on April 22 from 576B-1, a coffin silo. The next attempt, 23D (May 6) began experiencing abnormal pitch gyrations within 10 seconds of launch. After about 20 seconds, the missile started tumbling out of control upon which the RSO sent the destruct command. This failure was attributed to wiring in the pitch gyro contacting the casing and shorting out the gyro motor. Atlas 74D (July 22) broke up 70 seconds into launch due to {{a failure of the}} pitch gyro either due to an improper motor speed setting or torquing signals. Missile 47D (September 12) lost sustainer thrust due to a leak in the vernier helium supply system. Missile 33D (September 29) failed to stage its booster section when the staging electrical <b>disconnect</b> <b>plug</b> pulled out at T+125 seconds. 81D (October 13) failed when the LOX quick disconnect pressure sensor malfunctioned due to the loss of a heat shield at liftoff, causing the pneumatic system to overpressurize the LOX tank with helium until it ruptured the intermediate bulkhead and destroyed the missile at T+72 seconds.|$|E
50|$|Throughout the years, many {{different}} {{products such as}} stack draft fans, kiln cooling fans, and quick <b>disconnect</b> <b>plugs</b> were all manufactured. In the late 1940s, Hanco developed several products that continue in production today.|$|R

50|$|A {{disadvantage}} of using phone connectors for balanced audio connections {{is that the}} ground mates last and the socket grounds the plug tip and ring when inserting or <b>disconnecting</b> the <b>plug.</b> This causes bursts of hum, cracks and pops and may stress some outputs as they will be short circuited briefly, or longer if the plug is left half in.|$|R
5000|$|These {{connectors}} are specially {{developed by}} :sv:Djurle Industri AB (DIAB) for severe conditions where snow, ice and salt are common. They can {{be equipped with}} an optional heating loop if necessary. Moreover, they are [...] "self-disconnecting" [...] to {{lower the risk of}} damage to the connector if the driver should forget to <b>disconnect</b> the <b>plug</b> when <b>disconnecting</b> the trailer or the trailer jumps off the hook.|$|R

50|$|It is now mainly {{found on}} older equipment, such as 16 mm movie projectors. The Becker radio {{found in many}} Mercedes-Benz {{automobiles}} uses this connector. The same connector is used on some LED lamps and halogen lamps to connect the bulb to the power supply. The two-pin DIN plug lacks the outer metal shell, so far less force is required to <b>disconnect</b> the <b>plug</b> accidentally. Worn two-pin speaker plugs often require only the slightest nudge to break contact. There are also three- and four-pin versions of this loudspeaker connector used for example by Bang & Olufsen.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} game's ending {{has also}} been expanded; In the former, Jake Peril had scavenged and travelled past all the game's levels, then walked a staircase up to the surface. In the reedition, Jake then enters the Red Monk's headquarters; the monks are in full alert due to having lost track of Jake in the Lode Runner levels. Jake disguises himself using a robe and walks unnoticed in the building towards the exit. He then delivers one final blow to the Red Monks by <b>disconnecting</b> the <b>plug</b> from the outlet that powered the Monk's entire headquarters, before leaving.|$|R
50|$|The cover depicts {{connections}} with previous albums, {{which became a}} trend in Clearlight album covers from this point onward. On the cover of Clearlight Symphony, cables connect an electrical box to a head, with one cable leading off in the distance, over the horizon. On the cover of Forever Blowing Bubbles, the same cable comes over the horizon, and ends in a <b>disconnected</b> DIN <b>plug</b> lying in the grass, blowing bubbles. The grass {{appears to be a}} redrawing of the marijuana leaves from the back cover of Delired Cameleon Family, but are now just ordinary lawn grass.|$|R

50|$|Current {{flowed from}} the {{keyboard}} through the plugboard, {{and proceeded to}} the entry-rotor or Eintrittswalze. Each letter on the plugboard had two jacks. Inserting a <b>plug</b> <b>disconnected</b> the upper jack (from the keyboard) and the lower jack (to the entry-rotor) of that letter. The plug {{at the other end}} of the crosswired cable was inserted into another letter's jacks, thus switching the connections of the two letters.|$|R

50|$|Betty starts using a belt {{exercise}} machine, but {{gets into}} trouble when its control gets stuck. She sends Little Jimmy {{to get an}} electrician, but {{along the way he}} gets distracted and the object of his search keeps changing - magician, politician, musician etc. Finally, he comes across an old spring mattress. He pulls out the springs, placing them on his feet, and goes bouncing all through the neighborhood, breaking through a market canopy, bouncing higher, back to Betty's house and up to the attic window. Flying through, his foot <b>disconnects</b> the <b>plug</b> to the exercise machine. By now, Betty is pencil thin (her figure thinner than Olive Oyl's), and she looks so funny with the huge head and spindly body that she and Little Jimmy along with the furniture and scale laugh non-stop to the extent that both Betty and Jimmy blow up to be as round as balloons.|$|R
50|$|At home, one night, she is {{awakened by}} a call on her radio, from another radio enthusiast, Ji In (Yoo Ji-tae). They {{discover}} that they attend the same university and plan to meet {{in front of the}} school clock tower, where Ji In offers to lend So-eun a book for amateur HAM radio operators. At the set time, both wait for the other, So-eun in front of an unfinished clock tower in the heat and dust, and Ji In in front of a completed one, in heavy rain. Later at night, they argue about the why the other person did not show up, and about the weather, and Ji In is suddenly shocked to discover he is speaking over a radio with a <b>disconnected</b> power <b>plug.</b> Further, Ji In, is then jolted with the information which So-eun reveals: she is a Junior in 1979, he is a sophomore in 2000. At first he begins to doubt So-eun's words, but is slowly convinced despite the improbability of what is happening to him.|$|R
50|$|Panel-mounting jacks {{are often}} {{provided}} with switch contacts. Most commonly, a mono jack {{is provided with}} one normally closed (NC) contact, which {{is connected to the}} tip (live) connection when no plug is in the socket, and <b>disconnected</b> when a <b>plug</b> is inserted. Stereo sockets commonly provide two such NC contacts, one for the tip (left channel live) and one for the ring or collar (right channel live). Some designs of jack also have such a connection on the sleeve. As this contact is usually ground, it is not much use for signal switching, but could be used to indicate to electronic circuitry that the socket was in use.|$|R
50|$|The Polish WT-4 plug {{is adopted}} in Russia as ШТР-IV and has four metal pins and an {{additional}} fourth dielectric pin. The corresponding socket comes in two variants. The GTN-4 socket (РТШ-IV in Russia) provides a 4 pin connection (in most cases, the two rightmost pins are used for connecting a single line). The GTNC-4 (РТШК-IV) is a GTN-4 socket that has an additional circuit. The 5th plastic pin of the inserted <b>plug</b> <b>disconnects</b> a 1μF capacitor that otherwise closes the circuit of the telephone line when the plug is not inserted. This feature allows testing the line when the phone is not plugged in. The usage of a capacitor is mostly obsolete and GTN-4 sockets produced later reuse the capacitor compartment for an additional RJ11 socket.|$|R
50|$|MIL-DTL-22992 (formerly MIL-C-22992) {{describes}} multi-contact, heavy duty, quick <b>disconnect,</b> waterproof, electrical <b>plug</b> and receptacle connectors {{and associated}} accessories for electronic and electrical {{power and control}} circuits. The connectors are rated for -55 degrees to +125 degrees Celsius. These connectors are intended for use as follows: (i) Class C connectors are intended for external interconnection use on vans, shelters, trailers, buildings and heavy duty applications; (ii) Class J connectors are used in Class C applications where a wire support grommet is necessary; (iii) Class L connectors are intended for power connections from 40 to 200 amperes where heavy duty, waterproof and arc quenching ability are required; and (iv) Class R connectors are used as general purpose heavy-duty connectors where pressurization and arc quenching ability are not required. The insert arrangements are provided in MIL-STD-1651, with additional arrangement for high-current applications provided in the associated MS sheets.|$|R
50|$|The SHV (safe high voltage) {{connector}} {{is a type}} of RF connector {{used for}} terminating a coaxial cable. The connector uses a bayonet mount {{similar to those of the}} BNC and MHV connectors, but is easily distinguished due to its very thick and protruding insulator. This insulation geometry makes SHV connectors safer for handling high voltage than MHV connectors, by preventing accidental contact with the live conductor in an unmated connector or plug. The connector is also designed such that when it is being <b>disconnected</b> from a <b>plug,</b> the high voltage contact is broken before the ground contact, to prevent accidental shocks. The connector is also designed to prevent users from forcing a high voltage connector into a low voltage plug or vice versa (as can happen with MHV and BNC connectors), by reversing the gender compared to BNC.Details of the connector comprising dimensions of the mating parts, voltage rating, mininium insulation requirements and more are specified by the IEC document 60498.|$|R
40|$|The {{space robot}} {{technology}} experiment ROTEX to fly {{with the next}} spacelab mission D 2 in January 1993 provides a multisensory robot {{which is supposed to}} work in an autonomous mode, teleoperated by astronauts, as well as in different telerobotic ground control modes. These include on-line teleoperation and telesensorprogramming, a task-level oriented programming technique involving `learning by showing'concepts in a virtual environment. The robot's key features are its multisensory gripper and the local sensory feedback schemes which are the basis for shared autonomy. The corresponding man-machine interface concepts using a 6 dof non- force-reflecting control ball and visual feedback to the human operator are explained. Stereographic simulation on ground is supposed to predict even the sensor based path refinement on board, while realtime fusion of stereo images and laser range information helps to predict the motion of floating objects to be grapsed from ground, too. Other prototype tasks to be performed by this space robot are the assembly of a truss structure and connecting/ <b>disconnecting</b> an electrical <b>plug</b> (orbit replaceable unit exchange ORU) ...|$|R
40|$|Braided rivers are {{relatively}} simple to produce in the laboratory, whereas dynamic meandering rivers {{have not been}} sustained beyond initial bend formation. Meandering is theoretically explained by bend instability growing from planimetric perturbation, which convects downstream. In this study, we experimentally tested the importance of upstream perturbation and chute cutoff development in the evolution and dynamics of a meandering channel pattern. The initial straight channel had a transversely moving upstream inlet point and silt-sized silica flour {{was added to the}} sediment feed to allow floodplain formation. We obtained a dynamic meandering river with scroll bars. Bend growth was alternated by chute cutoffs that formed across the point bars. Meandering was maintained as one channel was <b>disconnected</b> by a <b>plug</b> bar. The curvature at the chute bifurcation transported sediment and build a new floodplain, while the other channel widens. At the end of the experiment, the fluvial plain exhibited a meandering channel, point bars, chutes and abandoned and partially filled channels with a slightly cohesive floodplain surface similar to natural meandering gravel bed rivers. We conclude that the necessary and sufficient conditions for dynamic meandering gravel bed river are a sustained dynamic upstream perturbation and floodplain formation...|$|R
40|$|An ED-tether {{mission to}} Jupiter is presented. A bare tether {{carrying}} cathodic devices {{at both ends}} but no power supply, and using no propellant, could move 'freely' among Jupiter's 4 great moons. The tour scheme would have current naturally driven throughout by the motional electric field, the Lorentz force switching direction with current around a 'drag' radius of 160, 00 kms, where {{the speed of the}} jovian ionosphere equals the speed of a spacecraft in circular orbit. With plasma density and magnetic field decreasing rapidly with distance from Jupiter, drag/thrust would only be operated in the inner plasmasphere, current being near shut off conveniently in orbit by <b>disconnecting</b> cathodes or <b>plugging</b> in a very large resistance; the tether could serve as its own power supply by plugging in an electric load where convenient, with just some reduction in thrust or drag. The periapsis of the spacecraft in a heliocentric transfer orbit from Earth would lie inside the drag sphere; with tether deployed and current on around periapsis, magnetic drag allows Jupiter to capture the spacecraft into an elliptic orbit of high eccentricity. Current would be on at succesive perijove passes and off elsewhere, reducing the eccentricity by lowering the apoapsis progressively to allow visits of the giant moons. In a second phase, current is on around apoapsis outside the drag sphere, rising the periapsis until the full orbit lies outside that sphere. In a third phase, current is on at periapsis, increasing the eccentricity until a last push makes the orbit hyperbolic to escape Jupiter. Dynamical issues such as low gravity-gradient at Jupiter and tether orientation in elliptic orbits of high eccentricity are discussed...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{the second}} half of the 19 th century, {{channelization}} of large multi-thread rivers such as the Rhine, the Danube, and the Rhône rivers induced artificial disconnection of most of their secondary channels. Compared to naturally abandoned channels, terrestrialization (i. e., the passage from the aquatic to the terrestrial stage, controlled by sediment deposits and/or lowering of the water level) patterns and rates of such artificially prematurely abandoned channels remain largely unknown. Moreover, factors controlling their evolutionary trajectories are complex owing to a set of pressures occurring throughout the 20 th century within specific space-time windows. Through a case study of the Rhône River, this paper aims to assess and distinguish the effects of a set of potential controlling factors on abandoned channel terrestrialization dynamics and lifespan. We tested the influence of: (i) submersible embankments closing the entrance of abandoned channels, (ii) main channel degradation following its channelization or the water level lowering due to channel bypassing in the middle of the 20 th century involving drastic water abstraction in these reaches, (iii) transverse dykes within the abandoned channels, (iv) the flooding regime of abandoned channels (i. e., frequency and magnitude of upstream connections producing lotic functioning), and (v) longitudinal variation in the suspended sediment concentration along the main channel. To this end, we studied 24 abandoned channels (16 artificially disconnected at their upstream end by submersible embankments and eight naturally <b>disconnected</b> by bar <b>plug</b> establishment) from the mid- 19 th to the beginning of the 20 th century. Their terrestrialization rates were characterized through the reconstruction of their planimetric trajectories using historical maps and aerial photos. The results reveal a much longer lifespan of artificial abandoned channels compared to natural ones because of the truncation of the initial bedload infilling phase due to the artificial and imposed closing of their entrance. Moreover, terrestrialization occurred faster when water level lowering or channel degradation was greater. Surprisingly, terrestrialization rates were the highest in the most frequently connected artificial abandoned channels (i. e., channels with a high frequency of lotic functioning), probably in relation to the roughness induced by the presence of transversal dykes. Finally, it is difficult to rank all the factors tested because of their complex combinations, which can change in space and time...|$|R
