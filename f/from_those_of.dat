Bonde responded that since the teeth differ <b>from</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> other dromaeosaurs from the Early Cretaceous (and later members of the group, including Dromaeosaurus), it should be considered valid. He also said that these scientists had provided incorrect information about the location, strata and age of the specimen, and that the circumstances of its naming were no different <b>from</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> other tooth-based taxa.|$|E

5|$|Archaeal lipid tails differ <b>from</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> {{other organisms}} {{in that they}} are based upon long isoprenoid chains with {{multiple}} side-branches, sometimes with cyclopropane or cyclohexane rings.

Although isoprenoids {{play an important role in}} the biochemistry of many organisms, only the archaea use them to make phospholipids. These branched chains may help prevent archaeal membranes from leaking at high temperatures.|$|E

5|$|Most {{extraterrestrial}} helium {{is found}} in a plasma state, with properties quite different <b>from</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> atomic helium. In a plasma, helium's electrons are not bound to its nucleus, resulting in very high electrical conductivity, even when the gas is only partially ionized. The charged particles are highly influenced by magnetic and electric fields. For example, in the solar wind together with ionized hydrogen, the particles interact with the Earth's magnetosphere, giving rise to Birkeland currents and the aurora.|$|E

5|$|Seabirds' life {{histories}} are dramatically different <b>from</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> land birds. In general, they are K-selected, live much longer (anywhere between twenty and sixty years), delay breeding for longer (for {{up to ten}} years), and invest more effort into fewer young. Most species will only have one clutch a year, unless they lose the first (with a few exceptions, like the Cassin's auklet), and many species (like the tubenoses and sulids), only one egg a year.|$|E
5|$|Shark skeletons {{are very}} {{different}} <b>from</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> bony fish and terrestrial vertebrates. Sharks and other cartilaginous fish (skates and rays) have skeletons made of cartilage and connective tissue. Cartilage is flexible and durable, yet is about half the normal density of bone. This reduces the skeleton's weight, saving energy. Because sharks do not have rib cages, they can easily be crushed under their own weight on land.|$|E
