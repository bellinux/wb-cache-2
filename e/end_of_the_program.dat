25|$|The {{original}} plan was for 10, then 18 three car sets each of BN-BN-ACN; {{but when the}} cars needed on-board food supplies, set N07 had car BRN20 fitted with a buffet module in place of about 20 seats at the east end. Sets N08 and N09 were released as normal BN-BN-ACN sets while N07 was trialled, {{and when it was}} deemed a success and followed by N10 as BN-BRN-ACN, sets N11 through N18 were built as BRN-BRN-ACN. Then, as each set was made ready for service, the newest BN-BN-ACN set was recalled to the workshops for mixing cars, so that all sets ended up as BN-BRN-ACN. Set N19, built at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>program,</b> was released as BN-BRN-ACN from the start, and at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>program</b> BRN20 returned to the workshops for modifications to match the rest of the fleet.|$|E

25|$|The Northrop X-21A was an {{experimental}} aircraft designed to test wings with laminar flow control.

Later, General Motors sold the supplier's majority control share to the Chevron Corporation and Cobasys.|$|E
25|$|Lateral wedge insoles {{and neutral}} insoles {{do not appear}} to be useful in {{osteoarthritis}} of the knee. Knee braces may help but their usefulness has also been disputed. For pain management heat can be used to relieve stiffness, and cold can relieve muscle spasms and pain. Among people with hip and knee osteoarthritis, exercise in water may reduce pain and disability, and increase quality of life in the short term. Also therapeutic exercise programs such as aerobics and walking reduce pain and improve physical functioning for up to 6 months after the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>program</b> for people with knee osteoarthritis.|$|E

25|$|In 2002, the {{government}} established Bolivia’s Rural Electrification Plan (PLABER) {{with the objective}} of contributing to the socio-economic development of rural areas through access to electricity and its efficient and productive uses.

It had been estimated that, by the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>program,</b> PLABER would have reached its goals by 70% of the initial objective.

25|$|Since the 50 State Quarters Program was {{expected}} to increase public demand for quarters which would be collected and taken out of circulation, the Mint used economic models to estimate the additional seigniorage the program would produce. These estimates established a range of $2.6 billion to $5.1 billion. (At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>program,</b> the Mint estimated the actual increase in seigniorage to be $3 billion.) The Mint also estimated the program would earn $110 million in additional numismatic profits. (The final, post-program estimate was $136.2 million.)

25|$|The Berhane Hewan {{package of}} interventions, in rural Amhara from 2004 to 2006, {{demonstrated}} that girls' school attendance {{could be improved}} by increasing the age of marriage. Girls in school and those wanting to return were supported by being given school materials. Parents and their participating daughters had to sign a registration form. If the girl was unmarried, parents had to agree not to marry their daughter during the two-year program and, if this condition was met, the girl and her family would receive a goat at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>program.</b> The intervention increased school attendance and delayed marriage for girls aged 10 to 14 years compared with controls. The intervention made no difference to girls in the 15 to 19 year age group.|$|E
25|$|In Brazil, the anaesthetists are {{physicians}} who have specialized {{in the field}} of anaesthesia. Approximately 650 physicians are admitted yearly to a three-year specialization program. The residency programs can take place at training centers in university hospitals. These training centres are accredited by the Brazilian Society of Anaesthesiology (SBA), or other referral hospitals accredited by the ministry of health. Most of the residents are trained in different areas, including ICU, pain management, and anaesthesia sub-specialties, including transplants and pediatrics. In order to be a certified anaesthetist in Brazil, the residents must give exams throughout the residency program and at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>program.</b> The SBA conducts these examinations.
