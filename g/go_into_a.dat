5|$|Several genera of teleosts have {{independently}} developed air-breathing capabilities, {{and some}} have become amphibious. Some combtooth blennies emerge to feed on land, and freshwater eels are able to absorb oxygen through damp skin. Mudskippers can remain out of water for considerable periods, exchanging gases through skin and mucous membranes in the mouth and pharynx. Swamp eels have similar well-vascularised mouth-linings, and can remain out of water for days and <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> resting state (aestivation) in mud. The anabantoids have developed an accessory breathing structure known as the labyrinth organ on the first gill arch and this is used for respiration in air, and airbreathing catfish have a similar suprabranchial organ. Certain other catfish, such as the Loricariidae, are able to respire through air held in their digestive tracts.|$|E
5|$|To {{conserve}} energy, heterothermic bats during long migrations may <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> torpid state while roosting in the daytime, {{and flying}} at night. Unlike migratory birds which fly {{during the day}} and feed during the night, nocturnal bats have a conflict between traveling and eating. Using torpor, bats can save around 90% of energy that they would have spent trying to keep their body temperature at a normal level; thereby reducing the need to feed. It also decreases the duration of migration, which may prevent them from spending too much time in unfamiliar places, and decrease predation. Pregnant individuals of some species may not use torpor.|$|E

5|$|Allan Arkush and Kring {{revealed}} {{in an interview}} on The Post Show that many parts of the finale were re-shot due to the Writers' Strike. Kring and Arkush commented that they re-shot the scene in which Peter telekenetically caught the virus. In the original cut, the virus was to shatter and be released. Kring admitted that the virus being released was to play a huge role in Volume 3, however, they decided to <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> different direction and re-shoot the ending, allowing Peter to catch the virus and destroy it. Kring also commented that the scenes where Matt, Peter and Nathan were talking in the vault were rewritten in and added later, as well as the Press Conference scene and the scene with Angela Petrelli talking on the cell phone. Kring and Arkush stated that the ending had to be rewritten and re-shot because they did not know when the show would return to air, due to the Writer's Strike, and they {{wanted to make sure that}} they tied up all the loose ends.|$|E
5|$|Both species {{walk with}} a high-stepping action, and can run swiftly through grass {{with the body}} held {{horizontal}} and laterally flattened. When disturbed, they typically fly less than , frequently landing behind a bush or thicket, and then <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> crouch. In short grass, they can escape from a dog using their speed and maneuverability, running with the body held almost horizontal. The typical flight is weak and fluttering, especially that of the African crake, but for longer flights, such as migration, the corn crake has a steadier, stronger action with its legs drawn up. Flocks of up to 40 corn crakes may form on migration, sometimes associating with common quails. Migration takes place at night, and flocks resting during the day may aggregate to hundreds of birds at favoured sites. The ability to migrate is innate, not learned from adults; chicks raised from birds kept in captivity for ten generations were able to migrate to Africa and return with similar success to wild-bred young.|$|E
5|$|Eight minutes later, Gary McAllister {{passed the}} ball to Fowler who moved towards {{the centre of the}} pitch from the {{left-hand}} side and hit his shot into the corner of the net to put Liverpool 4–3 up with 18 minutes of the match remaining. Two minutes later, Liverpool substituted Michael Owen for Patrik Berger. In the 82nd minute, Alavés had an appeal for a penalty after Hamann was adjudged to have brought Magno down, the Brazilian was subsequently booked for diving. With two minutes remaining, Liverpool goalkeeper Sander Westerveld conceded a corner. The subsequent corner is headed into the goal by Jordi Cruyff to make the scoreline 4–4. Two minutes into injury-time, Contra went down under pressure from Gerrard in the Liverpool penalty area. Again, the referee deemed that there was no penalty. Following this, the referee blew his whistle to signal the end of 90 minutes if play. The match would now <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> 30-minute extra-time period.|$|E

5|$|Females {{typically}} {{lay between}} {{four hundred and}} three thousand eggs. The eggs are often dropped {{onto the surface of}} the water; sometimes the female deposits them by dipping the tip of her abdomen into the water during flight, releasing a small batch of eggs each time, or deposits them in bulk while standing next to the water. In a few species, the female submerges and places the eggs among plants or in crevices underwater, but in general, they sink to the bottom. The incubation time is variable, depending at least in part on temperature, and may be anything from a few days to nearly a year. Eggs can <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> quiet dormant phase or diapause. The larval growth rate is also temperature-dependent, as is the number of moults. At anywhere between ten and fifty, these post-embryonic moults are more numerous in mayflies than in most other insect orders. The nymphal stage of mayflies may last from several months to several years, depending on species and environmental conditions.|$|E
5|$|Many {{sleeping}} birds bend {{their heads}} over {{their backs and}} tuck their bills in their back feathers, although others place their beaks among their breast feathers. Many birds rest on one leg, while some may pull up their legs into their feathers, especially in cold weather. Perching birds have a tendon locking mechanism that helps them {{hold on to the}} perch when they are asleep. Many ground birds, such as quails and pheasants, roost in trees. A few parrots of the genus Loriculus roost hanging upside down. Some hummingbirds <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> nightly state of torpor accompanied with a reduction of their metabolic rates. This physiological adaptation shows in nearly a hundred other species, including owlet-nightjars, nightjars, and woodswallows. One species, the common poorwill, even enters a state of hibernation. Birds do not have sweat glands, but they may cool themselves by moving to shade, standing in water, panting, increasing their surface area, fluttering their throat or by using special behaviours like urohidrosis to cool themselves.|$|E
5|$|These flights covered {{performance}} tests {{such as we}} do on planes undergoing Navy tests. The very first flight exposed weaknesses of the Zero which our pilots could exploit with proper tactics... immediately apparent {{was the fact that}} the ailerons froze up at speeds above 200 knots so that rolling maneuvers at those speeds were slow and required much force on the control stick. It rolled to the left much easier than to the right. Also, its engine cut out under negative acceleration due to its float-type carburetor. We now had the answer for our pilots who were being outmaneuvered and unable to escape a pursuing Zero: <b>Go</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> vertical power dive, using negative acceleration if possible to open the range while the Zero's engine was stopped by the acceleration. At about 200 knots, roll hard right before the Zero pilot could get his sights lined up.|$|E

5|$|Rethinking the {{conventions}} of a Zelda game became an important theme as development progressed. In previous Zelda games, the player would <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> dungeon, obtain a new item, and then move onto the next dungeon in a specific order. The development team felt that this formula was flawed as a player could get stuck on a dungeon and {{would be unable to}} progress further in the game. They wanted to give the player more freedom in the ways they could advance through the game, allowing them to tackle dungeons in any order and clear multiple dungeons in parallel, but this meant that the method for acquiring items had to be changed. They opted for a system where players could rent or purchase items using the game's currency, rupees. In the final game, rented items are returned to the merchant when the player is defeated, however the team had considered other ideas for returning rented items, such as setting a timer on the rental period and imposing fees if they were returned late. The development team found out about the existence of the Nintendo 2DS console during the game's production. As the Nintendo 2DS lacked 3D capabilities, the team decided to revise some of the game's dungeon designs to be certain that they could be completed without the 3D effect enabled.|$|E
5|$|Veronica {{learns that}} there may be a {{connection}} to a fraternity, and Wallace (Percy Daggs III) informs her that it is the secret society for which he is being recruited, the Castle. Wallace tells her that the equipment used to tape him was similar to that which was used to film Veronica and Piz. He starts to go through initiation with the group in order to ascertain the members' identities for Veronica. The members make him <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> room and ask him very personal questions, electrically shocking him if he answers untruthfully. When they find out that Veronica has sent Wallace, they forcibly remove him, but he is able to figure out the identity of one of the other recruits. Veronica sneaks into the house of the recruit Wallace names and sees a large portrait of Lilly Kane (Amanda Seyfried). She hears voices and hides behind a curtain before two men emerge. They speak about the Castle, and Veronica discovers that one of them is Jake Kane. After they leave, Veronica steals his computers. Keith investigates the robbery the following day, spotting Veronica on surveillance cameras; however, he does not initially report his daughter. Veronica asks Mac (Tina Majorino) whether any computer could crack Jake's password, and she is taken to a supercomputer on campus.|$|E
