As thin-wall components are extensively produced by high pressure die casting process (HPDC), the B 390 alloy finger-plate casting was cast against an H 13 steel die on a cold-chamber HPDC machine. The interfacial heat transfer behavior at different positions of the die was carefully studied using an inverse approach based on the temperature measurements inside the die. Furthermore, the filling process and the solidification rate in different finger-plates were also given to explain the distribution of interfacial heat flux (q) and interfacial heat transfer coefficient (h). Measurement results {{at the side of}} sprue indicates that qmax and hmax could reach 9. 2 MW昺- 2 and 64. 3 kW昺- 2 昁- 1, respectively.

A recommendations, for the preloaded bolts are investigated in accordance with European standard EN 1993 - 1 - 8. An experimental static compression tests are performed in order to observe the real behaviour of the column splice with long open slotted holes. Several number of numerical tests are performed to predict behaviour of the connection by use of Abaqus software. The Numerical model is validated against experimental results. Further tests are performed in order to check an influence of other important factors on the behaviour of connection system. An influence of connection geometry i. e. filler plate thickness, characteristic of the surface and the material properties are analyzed. The variation of bolt forces as well as slip factor and reduction factor ks are investigated. Finally, experimental test and finite element method analysis are discussed and conclusion are given.

40|$|Permanent magnet {{generators}} (PMG) {{represent the}} cutting edge technology in modern wind mills. The efficiency remains high (over 90 %) at partial loads. To improve the machine efficiency even further, every aspect of machine losses has to be analyzed. Additional losses are often given as a certain percentage without providing any detailed information about the actual calculation process; meanwhile, there are many design-dependent losses that {{have an effect on}} the total amount of additional losses and that have to be taken into consideration. Additional losses are most often eddy current losses in different parts of the machine. These losses are usually difficult to calculate in the design process. In this doctoral thesis, some additional losses are identified and modeled. Further, suggestions on how to minimize the losses are given. Iron losses can differ significantly between the measured no-load values and the loss values under load. In addition, with embedded magnet rotors, the quadrature-axis armature reaction adds losses to the stator iron by manipulating the harmonic content of the flux. It was, therefore, re-evaluated that in salient pole machines, to minimize the losses and the loss difference between the no-load and load operation, the flux density has to be kept below 1. 5 T in the stator yoke, which is the traditional guideline for machine designers. Eddy current losses may occur in the end-winding area and in the support structure of the machine, that is, in the <b>finger</b> <b>plate</b> and the clamping ring. With construction steel, these losses account for 0. 08 % of the input power of the machine. These losses can be reduced almost to zero by using nonmagnetic stainless steel. In addition, the machine housing may be subjected to eddy current losses if the flux density exceeds 1. 5 T in the stator yoke. Winding losses can rise rapidly when high frequencies and 10 – 15 mm high conductors are used. In general, minimizing the winding losses is simple. For example, it can be done by dividing the conductor into transposed subconductors. However, this comes with the expense of an increase in the DC resistance. In the doctoral thesis, a new method is presented to minimize the winding losses by applying a litz wire with noninsulated strands. The construction is the same as in a normal litz wire but the insulation between the subconductors has been left out. The idea is that the connection is kept weak to prevent harmful eddy currents from flowing. Moreover, the analytical solution for calculating the AC resistance factor of the litz-wire is supplemented by including an end-winding resistance in the analytical solution. A simple measurement device is developed to measure the AC resistance in the windings. In the case of a litz-wire with originally noninsulated strands, vacuum pressure impregnation (VPI) is used to insulate the subconductors. In one of the two cases studied, the VPI affected the AC resistance factor, but in the other case, it did not have any effect. However, more research is needed to determine the effect of the VPI on litz-wire with noninsulated strands. An empirical model is developed to calculate the AC resistance factor of a single-layer formwound winding. The model includes the end-winding length and the number of strands and turns. The end winding includes the circulating current (eddy currents that are traveling through the whole winding between parallel strands) and the main current. The end-winding length also affects the total AC resistance factor...|$|E
