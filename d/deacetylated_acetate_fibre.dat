40|$|Background: More than 90 % of the {{cigarettes}} sold worldwide have a filter. Nearly all filters {{consist of a}} rod of numerous (> 12 000) plastic-like cellulose <b>acetate</b> <b>fibres.</b> During high speed cigarette manu-facturing procedures, fragments of cellulose acetate that form the mouthpiece of a filter rod become separated from the filter at the end face.

Samples prepared at different temperatures (from 873 to 1573 K in steps of 100 K) were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, and surface area measurements. In the acetate case, the transformation sequence involves the formation of q-Al 2 O 3 as an intermediate phase between g- and a-Al 2 O 3, whereas this q phase is not observed in the lactate case. TEM and SEM images show the nanoparticulate character of the aluminas obtained at relatively low temperatures, with typical particle size in the 5 to 10 nm range. Progressive grain growth occurs as temperature increases. Otherwise, the precursor characteristics have a clear influence on the microstructure of the resulting aluminas, as reflected also by the measured BET surface area values.

40|$|Summary. -The topical {{carcinogenicity}} to mouse skin {{of smoke}} condensates ob-tained from a tobacco substitute (NSM), {{alone or in}} combination with tobacco, has been compared with condensate from tobacco and with acetone, the solvent used. Sixteen different types of cigarette were {{used to make the}} condensates, and the age-standardized results have been analysed according to the Weibull distribution model. The results show that NSM condensate has less than 25 % of the potency of tobacco condensate (37 0 at 95 0 upper confidence limit), and that condensates from blends of NSM and tobacco are similarly reduced in activity. General pathology analysis failed to reveal abnormalities due to NSM. THE chemical complexity of cigarette smoke precludes the precise attribution of the known carcinogenic effects to a single component or group of components, and animal models are therefore required to assay carcinogenic activity. A model commonly used is the topical application of smoke condensates to mouse skin, and measurement of the incidence of tumours which result. The method has been much used to monitor attempts at reduction of the carcinogenicity of tobacco smoke, and although there is as yet no evidence equating mouse skin response with the human lung response, it is assumed that a direct relationship exists between the ability to induce tumours in mouse skin and in the human bronchial tract. The experiments described were de-signed to determine the carcinogenic potential of smoke condensate from a substitute smoking material and from blends of this material with conventional tobacco.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} fluid dynamic {{mechanisms}} related to papermaking, specif- ically: the initial dewatering mechanisms during roll-forming and fibre motion in sedimentation and in shear flow. Pressure and wire position measurements {{have been conducted}} in a model resembling the forming zone and the measured pressure distributions are shown to have more complex patterns than the simple model p / T/R (where T is the wire tension and R is the roll radius). It is shown that an increase in wire tension has a similar effect as a decrease in flow-rate on {{the shape of the}} pressure distribution. In addition, it is shown that the drainage has a stabilizing effect on the dewatering pressure. The flow around the forming roll has also been modelled with the assump- tion that the wire is impermeable. A non-linear equation for the position of the wire is derived that clearly shows that the Weber number, We, is an im- portant parameter. The equation is linearized around the trivial solution and has a standing wave solution with a specific wavelength that scales with the We-number. Motion of non-Brownian fibre settling in a Newtonian fluid at a small but finite Reynolds number has been studied experimentally. Two different regimes of sedimentation were identified. For dilute suspensions, fibres gener- ally fall without flipping and may travel at velocities larger than that of an isolated particle. In the semi-dilute regime we found the settling process to be dominated by large-scale fluctuations. The velocity fluctuations scale with the suspension volume concentrationφ according toφ 1 / 3, which is similar to the findings for settling spheres. The influence of shear on fibre orientation in the near wall region was studied in cellulose <b>acetate</b> <b>fibre</b> suspensions. At low concentration and low aspect ratio fibres were observed to orient perpendicular to the streamwise direction (named rollers) in the near wall region whereas the orientation further into the suspension was unchanged. As the concentration and aspect ratio increased the fraction of rollers decreased. Finally, an evaluation of a commercial Ultra Velocity Profiler unit in fibre suspensions are presented. The idea was to determine the velocity and characterise the turbulence from ultra sound echoes from particles in the fluid. However, the spatial and/or temporal resolution of the measurements did not permit turbulence characterisation. These limitations might be possible to overcome and some procedures are proposed and evaluated. QC 2010102...|$|R
40|$|Non-spherical {{particles}} are present all around us, in biological, industrial and environmental processes. Making predictions of {{their impact on}} us and systems in our vicinity can make life better for everyone here on earth. For example, the ash particles from a volcano eruption are non-spherical and their spreading in the atmosphere can hugely impact the air traffic, as was also proven in 2010. Furthermore, {{the orientation of the}} wood fibres in a paper sheet influences the final properties of the paper, and the cause of a specific fibre orientation {{can be traced back to}} the fluid flows during the manufacturing process of the paper. In this thesis, experimental and numerical work is presented with the goal to understand and utilize the behavior of elongated particles in fluid flows. Two different experimental setups are used. The first one, a turbulent half channel flow, aims at increasing the understanding of how particles with non-zero inertia behave in turbulence. The second setup is an attempt to design a flow field with the purpose to align nanofibrils and create high performance cellulose filaments. Experiments were performed in a turbulent half channel flow at different flow set- tings with dilute suspensions of cellulose <b>acetate</b> <b>fibres</b> having three different aspect ratios (length to width ratio). The two main results were firstly that the fibres agglom- erated in streamwise streaks, believed to be due to the turbulent velocity structures in the flow. Secondly, the orientation of the fibres was observed to be determined by the aspect ratio and the mean shear, not the turbulence. Short fibres were oriented in the spanwise direction while long fibres were oriented in the streamwise direction. In order to utilize the impressive properties (stiffness comparable to Kevlar) of the cellulose nanofibril in a macroscopic material, the alignment of the fibrils must be controlled. Here, a flow focusing device (resulting in an extensional flow), designed to align the fibrils, is used to create a cellulose filament with aligned fibrils. The principle is based on a separation of the alignment and the assembly of the fibrils, i. e. first align the fibrils and then lock the aligned structure. With this process, continuous filaments were created, with properties similar to that of the wood fibre at the same fibril alignment. However, the highest alignment (lowest angle) of the fibrils in a filament created was only 31 o from the filament axis, and the next step is to increase the alignment. This thesis includes modeling of the alignment process with the Smoluchowski equation and a rotary diffusion. Finding a model that correctly describes the alignment process should in the end make it possible to create a filament with fully aligned fibrils. QC 20140908 </p...|$|R

To overcome the limitations of diffusive transport, the possibility of growing three dimensional (3 D) tissue structures by using hollow fibre membrane bioreactors (HFMB) has been considered in this study. The hollow fibre membranes, embedded in the 3 D scaffold, are porous and semi-permeable and can thus serve similar functions to arteries and veins in vivo. Collagen gel and Cytodex 1 microcarriers were used as a composite 3 D scaffold and permeating cellulose <b>acetate</b> hollow <b>fibre</b> membranes were attached to both ends of a polycarbonate cylindrical shell to form a bioreactor. Rat bone marrow fibroblastic (RBMF) cells were seeded initially onto Cytodex 1 microcarriers and these were subsequently mixed with collagen gel before inoculation into the bioreactor.

Bioreactors containing cells cultured under similar conditions except for the lack of perfusion of medium served as controls. The proliferation, viability, metabolism and morphological appearances of the cells in the perfused and non-perfused constructs were compared.

The internal surfaces of cellulose <b>acetate</b> hollow <b>fibres,</b> of comparable internal diameter to small blood vessels, were coated with normal serum human IgG, heat-aggregated IgG (HAIgG), laminin or fibrinogen. Under conditions of flow mimicking those in a small vessel, PMN {{were found to}} adhere markedly only to immunoglobulin-coated fibres. Arrest on HAIgG was inhibited by excess soluble IgG but not by bovine serum albumin (BSA), demonstrating that the adhesion was IgG-specific and presumably mediated by Fc gamma R on the PMN surface. Pre-adsorption of serum components onto HAIgG-coated fibres enhanced PMN arrest, due most probably to fixation of complement components by immobilized HAIgG, resulting in additional potential to entrap PMN via complement receptors such as CR 3. Treatment of PMN with the regulatory neuropeptide substance P also enhanced adhesion to HAIgG-coated fibres and caused increased surface expression of Fc gamma RI, Fc gamma RII and Fc gamma RIII. A mouse cell line derived from L cells, hR 4 C 6, stably transfected with human Fc gamma RII, was found to adhere under flow to HAIgG-coated fibres, whilst untransfected parent L cells did not. This adhesion was similarly inhibited by excess soluble IgG, confirming the capability of Fc gamma R to mediate cell arrest. The study strongly suggests that Fc gamma R may {{play an important role}} in intravascular PMN arrest and we speculate that in inflammatory diseases PMN may adhere via Fc gamma R to immobilized immunoglobulin on the vascular endothelium, with subsequent degranulation and tissue damage...|$|R
40|$|In this work, in situ {{method of}} {{producing}} hybrid fibrous adsorbents in which boehmite nanosheets with high sorption properties formed {{on the surface}} of hydrophilic microfibres, such as cellulose <b>acetate</b> and glass <b>fibre,</b> was described. The boehmite nanosheets were fabricated by the reaction of composite AlN/Al nanoparticles with water at 60  °C. The synthesized samples were characterized by X-ray diffractometer, scanning, transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FT-IR), zeta-potential and specific surface area analyzers. The introduction of microfibres into a diluted aqueous suspension of nanopowders causes heteroadagulation of the nanoparticles and accelerates their further transformation. This effect is most substantial with the glass microfibre, which is thought to have a higher concentration of surface groups capable of generating hydrogen bonds that act as heteroadagulation and nucleation centres. The experimental results showed that the morphology of the resultant hybrid fibrous adsorbents differed accordingly: the nanosheets were attached on-edge to the glass microfibre surface, while {{on the surface of}} the cellulose acetate microfibre, they were secured in the form of spherical “nanoflowers” of agglomerated nanosheets.

The feasibility of preparing enriched cellulose <b>acetate</b> (CA) -based <b>fibres</b> {{as a vehicle for}} therapeutic delivery of such biomolecules was investigated. A new ternary solvent system consisting of acetone: N,N-dimethylacetamide: methanol (2 : 1 : 2) has been demonstrated to permit the solution blending of CA with the water soluble L-tryptophan. Nanofibrous webs substantially free of structural defects were continuously produced with mean fibre diameters in the range of 520 - 1, 010 nm, dependent on process parameters. Morphology and diameter of fibres were influenced by concentration of CA spinning solution, applied voltage and flow rates. The kinetic release profile of L-tryptophan from electrospun CA nanofibres was described by the pseudo-second order kinetic model. Fibres with mean diameter of 720 nm provide both the highest initial desorption rate and rate constant, which was partially attributed to the low fibre diameter and high relative surface area, but also the fact that the fibres with mean diameter of 720 nm produced were the most bead-free, providing diffusion advantages over the fibres with lowest mean diameter (520 nm). The feasibility of combining L-tryptophan within fibres provides a promising route for manufacture of transdermal delivery devices...|$|R

This study {{was focused on the}} characterization and remediation of cellulose <b>acetate</b> (CA) hollow <b>fibre</b> membranes contaminated by heavy hydrocarbons.

The permeabilities of the membranes to carbon dioxide, helium, hydrogen, methane, nitrogen and oxygen were measured at pressures 300 – 1500 kPa and at temperatures 25 ° – 50 °C. It was shown that even a thin layer of oil on the membrane surface can result in substantial losses in membrane performance, with faster permeating gases (e. g. He and H₂) suffering the worst losses.

40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{establishing}} quantification methods for binary mixtures containing a new polypropylene/polyamide 6 - based bicomponent fibre, for which a new generic fibre name has been requested to the European Commission. Application of such methods is requested by EU legislation (Directive 96 / 73 /EC) to enable market surveillance regarding the textile composition data on labels that are compulsory. The methodology for quantification of fibre mixtures is usually based either on manual separation or on chemical dissolution methods. In both cases, a sample pre-treatment, able to remove non-fibrous material, is needed. The key experimental parameters {{that need to be}} established for the novel fibre are: its moisture regain in standard atmosphere (agreed allowance), its mass loss due to pre-treatment (b coefficient) and its mass losses in the methods where it is insoluble (d correction factors). Results of this study showed that the b coefficient for the new fibre, using the normal pre-treatment, is equal to 0 %. As expected from the chemical composition and synthetic character of the novel fibre, the experimental value for the agreed allowance was low and equal to 0. 54 %. The new fibre was insoluble in ten out of the 14 dissolution methods tested and the correspondent ten d correction factors were evaluated. Three of them were also validated through a collaborative trial organised at European level following the internationally accepted guideline ISO 5725 - 2 : 1994. The d correction factors obtained throughout the study were in the range of 1. 00 - 1. 01, meaning that the fibre was completely insoluble or at maximum 1 % soluble in the dissolution reagent.
