2500|$|Fission-fragment rockets use {{nuclear fission}} to create {{high-speed}} jets of fission fragments, which are ejected at speeds {{of up to}} 12,000km/s. With fission, the energy output is approximately 0.1% of the total mass-energy of the reactor fuel and limits the <b>effective</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity</b> to about 5% of the velocity of light. For maximum velocity, the reaction mass should optimally consist of fission products, the [...] "ash" [...] of the primary energy source, in order that no extra reaction mass need be book-kept in the mass ratio. This {{is known as a}} fission-fragment rocket. thermal-propulsion engines such as NERVA produce sufficient thrust, but can only achieve relatively low-velocity exhaust jets, so to accelerate to the desired speed would require an enormous amount of fuel.|$|E
2500|$|Thus, {{the greater}} the {{specific}} impulse, {{the greater the}} net thrust and performance of the engine. [...] is determined by measurement while testing the engine.

They may be capable of creating specific impulses of 3,000-5,000 s (30 to 50 kN·s/kg, <b>effective</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocities</b> 30 to 50 km/s) and thrust which is enough for relatively fast interplanetary travel. Heat transfer to the working fluid (propellant) is by thermal radiation, mostly in the ultraviolet, given off by the fission gas at a working temperature of around 25,000 °C.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect on}} {{performance}} of variations in power plant, aircraft, and rocket parameters {{was calculated for}} a lifting air breathing boost system for launching satellites. A limited variation in aircraft flight plan was considered also. In addition, comparisons were made between the air breathing boost system and a three stage all rocket system. For the air breathing boost computations were made for launch Mach numbers ranging from two to five. The air breathing boost {{was assumed to be}} a turbojet or dual cycle engine powered aircraft. The rocket used in conjunction with the boost had two stages. In computing aircraft performance thrust and engine specific fuel consumption were taken as constants. The lift to drag ratio was also considered constant for each portion of the flight profile which consisted of a take off and acceleration to climb speed, a two step climb, and a pull up to the maximum angle attainable for rocket launch. In computing rocket performance burning times, <b>effective</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocities,</b> payload weight ratios, and structural weight ratios were assumed to be the same for each stage. Drag was neglected in rocket calculations, and the acceleration of gravity was assumed constant. The calculations were made by computing the kinetic and potential energies for a sounding rocket and equating them to the energy required for orbit...|$|R
2500|$|When {{discussing}} {{the efficiency of}} a propulsion system, designers often focus on effectively using the reaction mass. [...] Reaction mass must be carried along with the rocket and is irretrievably consumed when used. [...] One way of measuring the amount of impulse that {{can be obtained from}} a fixed amount of reaction mass is the specific impulse, the impulse per unit weight-on-Earth (typically designated by [...] ). The unit for this value is seconds. Because the weight on Earth of the reaction mass is often unimportant when discussing vehicles in space, specific impulse can also be discussed in terms of impulse per unit mass. [...] This alternate form of specific impulse uses the same units as velocity (e.g. m/s), and in fact it is equal to the <b>effective</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity</b> of the engine (typically designated [...] ). [...] Confusingly, both values are sometimes called specific impulse. [...] The two values differ by a factor of gn, the standard acceleration due to gravity 9.80665m/s² (...) [...]|$|E
2500|$|Though most of {{this work}} dealt with the {{theoretical}} and experimental relations between propellant, rocket mass, thrust, and velocity, a final section, entitled [...] "Calculation of minimum mass required to raise one pound to an 'infinite' altitude", discussed the possible uses of rockets, not only to reach the upper atmosphere, but to escape from Earth's gravitation altogether. He determined that a rocket with an <b>effective</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity</b> (see specific impulse) of 7000 feet per second and an initial weight of 602 pounds {{would be able to}} send a one-pound payload to an infinite height. Included as a thought experiment was the idea of launching a rocket to the moon and igniting a mass of flash powder on its surface, so as to be visible through a telescope. He discussed the matter seriously, down to an estimate of the amount of powder required; Goddard's conclusion was that a rocket with starting mass of 3.21 tons could produce a flash [...] "just visible" [...] from Earth, assuming a final payload weight of 10.7 pounds.|$|E

50|$|However, {{the total}} energy for a mission depends on total {{propellant}} use, {{as well as}} how much energy is needed per unit of propellant. For low <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity</b> with respect to the mission delta-v, enormous amounts of reaction mass is needed. In fact a very low <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity</b> is not energy efficient at all for this reason; {{but it turns out that}} neither are very high <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocities.</b>|$|R
50|$|Ideally, a mixer {{is also a}} {{performance}} benefit to increasing thrust. The exhaust thrust from a jet engine is equal to exhaust mass flow times <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity,</b> ie, Thrust = ṁv, while the energy to make that thrust is given by Energy = 1/2mv2. A mixer helps reduce the fastest <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocities</b> from {{the core of the}} engine, while making the average <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity</b> faster, producing more thrust with the same energy.|$|R
40|$|The main {{conclusions}} reached are: (1) At low subsonic jet <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocities,</b> {{jet noise}} varies as the velocity to the eighth power; (2) at high subsonic <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocities,</b> jet noise approaches a variation with velocity {{to the third}} power; (3) use of the jet density squared overcorrects density effects on jet noise; (4) subsonic and supersonic jet noise levels can be predicted; and (6) use of multielement nozzles and acoustically lined ejectors significantly suppress jet noise at intermediate jet <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocities...</b>|$|R
50|$|Note that <b>effective</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>{{velocity}}</b> {{and actual}} exhaust velocity can be significantly different, for example when a rocket is run within the atmosphere, atmospheric {{pressure on the}} outside of the engine causes a retarding force that reduces the specific impulse, and the <b>effective</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity</b> goes down, whereas the actual exhaust velocity is largely unaffected. Also, sometimes rocket engines have a separate nozzle for the turbo-pump turbine gas, and then calculating the <b>effective</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity</b> requires averaging the two mass flows as well as accounting for any atmospheric pressure.|$|E

50|$|A {{closely related}} (but different) concept to energy {{efficiency}} is {{the rate of}} consumption of propellant mass. Propellant consumption in jet engines is measured by Specific Fuel Consumption, Specific impulse or <b>Effective</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity.</b> They all measure the same thing. Specific impulse and <b>effective</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity</b> are strictly proportional, whereas specific fuel consumption is inversely proportional to the others.|$|E
25|$|For these drives, at {{the highest}} exhaust speeds, {{energetic}} efficiency and thrust are all inversely proportional to <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity.</b> Their very high <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity</b> means they require huge amounts of energy and thus with practical power sources provide low thrust, but use hardly any fuel.|$|R

25|$|Some drives (such as VASIMR or electrodeless plasma thruster) {{actually}} can significantly vary their <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity.</b> This {{can help reduce}} propellant usage or improve acceleration {{at different stages of}} the flight. However the best energetic performance and acceleration is still obtained when the <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity</b> is close to the vehicle speed. Proposed ion and plasma drives usually have <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocities</b> enormously higher than that ideal (in the case of VASIMR the lowest quoted speed is around 15000m/s compared to a mission delta-v from high Earth orbit to Mars of about 4000m/s).|$|R
50|$|For {{air-breathing}} jet engines, particularly turbofans, {{the actual}} exhaust velocity and the <b>effective</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity</b> are different by orders of magnitude. This is because {{a good deal}} of additional momentum is obtained by using air as reaction mass. This allows a better match between the airspeed and the exhaust speed, which saves energy/propellant and enormously increases the <b>effective</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity</b> while reducing the actual exhaust velocity.|$|E
