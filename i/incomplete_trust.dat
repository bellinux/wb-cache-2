40|$|In any {{economic}} environment where decisions are decentralized, agents consider {{the risk that}} others might unfairly exploit informational asymmetries to their own disadvantage. Incomplete results, especially, {{lies at the heart}} of financial transactions in which agents trade real claims for promises of future real claims. Agents thus need to invest considerable resources to assess the trustworthiness of others with whom they know they can interact only under conditions of limited and asymmetrically distributed information. Thinking of finance as the complex of institutions and instruments needed to reduce the cost of trading promises among anonymous individuals who do not fully trust each other, the author analyzes how <b>incomplete</b> <b>trust</b> shapes the transaction costs in trading assets, and how it affects resource allocation and pricing decisions from rational, forward-looking agents. His analysis leads to core propositions about the role of finance and financial efficiency in economic development. He recommends areas of financial sector reform in emerging economies aimed at improving the financial system's efficiency in dealing with <b>incomplete</b> <b>trust.</b> Among other things, the public sector can improve trust in finance by improving financial infrastructure, including legal systems, financial regulation, and security in payment and trading systems. But fundamental improvements in financial efficiency may best be gained by eliciting good conduct through market forces.

40|$|Purpose – In {{an urban}} {{environment}} in The Netherlands, a municipality, a health insurance company and nine health care organisations try to integrate {{health care services}} and social services {{by means of a}} global, population-based budget for three areas with above the average costs. Against a background of changing circumstances and bureaucratic impediments, they try to reach an agreement on the contractual provisions before starting cooperation in everyday practice. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to describe and evaluate the cooperative process. Design/methodology/approach – The paper reflects the authors’ personal experiences and interpretation of the cooperative process. Findings – The participants experience was that the ideals they had started with faded when financial and juridical procedures dominated the discussions. In contrast with that, focusing on the population involved created positive energy and motivation. Practical implications – Uncertainties are part of social innovation and therefore, formal contracts will be <b>incomplete.</b> <b>Trust</b> building techniques and creating common values and culture are necessary ingredients for developing confidence that the cooperating parties will be able to cope with unforeseen developments or outcomes. Originality/value – The paper may contribute to the successful development of innovative agreements between purchasers and providers of health care and social care in order to achieve better integrated services without rising costs...|$|E
40|$|In a decentralized-decisions economy under uncertainty, the {{financial}} system {{can be seen as}} the complex of institutions, infrastructure, and instruments that the society adopts to minimize the costs of transacting promises under agents ’ <b>incomplete</b> <b>trust</b> and limited information. Building on a microeconomic, general equilibrium model that portrays such fundamental function of finance, this study analytically shows that, in line with recent empirical evidence, the development of financial infrastructure stimulates larger and more efficient capital industrial accumulation. The study also shows that economies with more developed financial infrastructure can better absorb exogenous shocks to output. The results call for addressing a crucial question concerning financial sector reform sequencing: early in development banks provide essential financial infrastructural services as part of their exclusive relationships with borrowers, while further economic development requires such services to be provided extrinsically to the bank-borrower relationships, clearly at the expense of bank rents. Financial sector development is thus characterized by a discontinuity in that banks are to be supported early on in development, while they need to be “weakened ” later on precisely to foster development. This raises the question of when and how optimally to generate and manage the discontinuity before it is forced upon the society by traumatic and costly events such as bank crises...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of the society and warfare goes hand in hand. With the proliferation of modern information technology, in particular communication technology, concepts such as information warfare and network-centric warfare have emerged. Information {{has become one of}} the core elements in military decision making, where the purpose is to gain information superiority with respect to the enemy while denying the enemy from doing the same. Network-centricity comes from the fact that communication networks are used to enable information warfare in the theatre of operations. Thus, the role of the communication network is to support decision making. In this thesis, military decision making in a network-centric environment is analyzed from the perspective of information warfare. Based on the analysis, a set of security requirements are identified. The thesis also proposes a set of solutions and concepts to the vulnerabilities found and analyzes the solutions with respect to the requirements and a set of use scenarios. The main solutions are Packet Level Authentication, which secures the military infrastructure, and Self-healing Networks, which enable the network to restructure itself after a large-scale or dedicated attack. The restructuring process relies on a Context Aware Management architecture, which has originally been developed to allow network nodes to rapidly react to a changing environment. Furthermore, the thesis presents a trust management model based on <b>incomplete</b> <b>trust</b> to cope with compromised nodes. Also privacy issues are discussed; several different privacy classes are identified and the problems with each of them are addressed. reviewe...|$|E

A theoretical visual interaction framework to model consensus in social network group decision making (SN-GDM) is put forward with following three main components: (1) construction of trust relation- ship; (2) trust based recommendation mechanism; and (3) visual adoption mechanism. To do that, dual trust propagation is investigated to connect <b>incomplete</b> <b>trust</b> relationship by trusted third partners, {{in a way that}} it can fit our intuition in these cases: trust values decrease while distrust values increase. Trust relationship is proposed to be used in determining the trust degree of experts and in aggregating individual opinions into a collective one. Three levels of consensus degree are defined and used to identify the inconsistent experts. A trust based recommendation mechanism is developed to generate advices according to individual trust relationship, making recommendations more likeable to be implemented by the inconsistent experts to achieve higher levels of consensus. Therefore, it has an advantage with respect to existing interaction models because it does not force the inconsistent experts to accept advices irrespective of their trust on them. Finally, a visual adoption mechanism, which provides visual information representations on experts’ individual consensus positions before and after adopting the recommendation advices, is presented and analysed theoretically. Experts can select their appropriate feedback parameters to achieve a balance between group consensus and individual independence. Consequently, the proposed visual interaction model adds real and needed flexibility in guiding the consensus reaching process in SN-GDM...|$|E
40|$|Although it is {{well known}} that trust is an {{important}} component of the fulfilment of incomplete contracts, less is known regarding how robust it is to past experiences. We present an experiment in which trust is required for transactions to occur, and nature provides a series of shocks along the path of play. Although the shocks have a short-term impact, we find that trust is surprisingly robust in the long-term. We argue that trust, through fragile in one way, is in another way more robust and stable over time than previously known.

Our findings document that participants move toward balanced reciprocity after the PGG {{with the exception of}} those who have experienced directly or indirectly physical violence and/or forced relocation who exhibit significantly less trustworthiness in the second TG round. Results are robust to several robustness checks controlling for selection into victimization. Since in a framework of asymmetric information and <b>incomplete</b> contracts, <b>trust</b> games mimic sequential economic exchanges whose functioning is crucial to economic growth, we argue that our results identify a microeconomic nexus among socio-political instability, violence and growth helping to solve identification problems of the cross-country literature on the subject. trust games, public good games, randomized experiment, social capital, socioeconomic instability and development. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{relation}} between economic inequality and trust is studied {{in a model}} where the ability to elicit trustworthiness from unrelated people depends on own wealth {{as well as the}} distribution and mean of population wealth. In equilibrium, the rich trust but betray while the poor do not trust but are trustworthy. Homogenizing wealth around its mean leads to a zero-trust outcome if mean wealth is sufficiently low, to full trust if mean wealth is large. More effective enforcement technologies increase, more effective counter-enforcement technologies decrease trust. Economic inequality reinforces itself through the trust and betray incentives it induces, suggesting a beneficial role for redistributive policies. <b>Trust</b> <b>Incomplete</b> information Inequality Wealth Enforcement...|$|R
40|$|The author {{analyzes}} the financial system's role in {{economic growth and}} stability, addressing several core policy issues associated with financial sector reform in emerging economies. He studies finance's role {{in the context of}} a circuit model, with interacting rational, forward-looking, heterogeneous agents. He shows finance to essentially complement the price system in coordinating decentralized intertemporal resource allocation choices made by agents operating with limited information and <b>incomplete</b> <b>trust.</b> He discusses the links between finance and incentives for efficiency and stability in the context of the circuit model. He also identifies incentives and incentive-compatible institutions for reform strategies for financial sectors in emerging economies. Among his conclusions: 1) Circuit theory features important methodological advantages to analyze the role of finance, and to assess structural weaknesses of financial systems under different institutional settings and in different stages of economic development. 2) Incentives for prudence and honesty can protect the stability of the circuit by directing private sector forces unleashed by liberalization. In particular: a) Financial institutions should be encouraged to invest in reputational capital. b) Governments should complement the creation of franchise value by strengthening supervision and by adopting a regulatory regime based on rules designed to align the private incentives of market players with the social goal of financial stability. c) Safety nets to reduce systemic risk should minimize the moral hazard from stakeholders by limiting risk protection and by making the cost of protection sensitive to the risk taken. d) Governments should encourage self-policing in the financial sector. e) Where information and trust are scarce, there is a potential market for them, and governments can greatly improve incentives for optimal provision of information. f) Governments should strengthen the complementarity between the formal and the informal financial sectors. Emphasizing incentives is not to deny the importance of good rules, capable regulators andsupervisors, and strong enforcement measures. It is to suggest that the returns on investments to set up rules, institutions, and enforcement mechanisms can be greater if market players have an incentive to align their own objectives with the social goal of financial stability.

40|$|This paper {{shows how}} the fear of {{signaling}} distrust can endogenously lead to incomplete contractual agreements. We consider a principal agent relationship where the agent may be trustworthy (dedicated to the project) or not. The principal may trust the agent (i. e. have a high belief of facing a trustworthy agent), or distrust him. The proposal of a complete contract, including fines and other explicit incentives, is shown to signal distrust. When trust is important in some non-contractible part of the relationship, a principal may prefer to leave the contract incomplete rather than to signal distrust by proposing a complete contract. Contractual incompleteness arises endogenously due to asymmetric information about how much one partner trusts the other side. <b>Trust</b> <b>Incomplete</b> contracts Signaling...|$|R
40|$|A {{theoretical}} framework to consensus building within a networked social group is put forward. This article investigates a trust based estimation and aggregation methods {{as part of}} a visual consensus model for multiple criteria group decision making with incomplete linguistic information. A novel trust propagation method is proposed to derive trust relationship from an <b>incomplete</b> connected <b>trust</b> network and the trust score induced order weighted averaging operator is presented to aggregate the orthopairs of trust/distrust values obtained from different trust paths. Then, the concept of relative trust score is defined, whose use is twofold: (1) to estimate the unknown preference values and (2) as a reliable source to determine experts' weights. A visual feedback process is developed to provide experts with graphical representations of their consensus status within the group as well as to identify the alternatives and preference values that should be reconsidered for changing in the subsequent consensus round. The feedback process also includes a recommendation mechanism to provide advice to those experts that are identified as contributing less to consensus on how to change their identified preference values. It is proved that the implementation of the visual feedback mechanism guarantees the convergence of the consensus reaching process...|$|R

40|$|Even {{when there}} is a {{potential}} danger of opportunism, economic agents often initiate contracts or engage in trust. Considering a world with two types of agents, opportunists and non-opportunists, interacting under incomplete information, this article develops a simple two-stage game theoretic model to show how trust and cooperation can emerge in a one-shot interaction, {{even in the absence of}} a supporting incentive mechanism. Two classic paradigms are considered: the prisoner’s dilemma and the game of chicken. In the context of the prisoner’s dilemma, trust depends on the exogenous probability of having a non-opportunist partner, while in the game of chicken trust is purely a function of the payoffs. Contrary to intuition, a high ratio of non-opportunistic agents in the population does not favor contract initiation in the game of chicken and a strong presence of opportunists does not act as an impediment to respecting commitments.

40|$|Cooperation and {{coordination}} between agents are fundamental processes for increasing aggregate and individual benefit in open Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). The increased ubiquity, size, {{and complexity of}} open MAS {{in the modern world}} has prompted significant research interest in the mechanisms that underlie cooperative and coordinated behaviour. In open MAS, in which agents join and leave freely, we can assume the following properties: (i) there are no centralised authorities, (ii) agent authority is uniform, (iii) agents may be heterogeneously owned and designed, and may consequently have con icting intentions and inconsistent capabilities, and (iv) agents are constrained in interactions by a complex connecting network topology. Developing mechanisms to support cooperative and coordinated behaviour that remain effective under these assumptions remains an open research problem. Two of the major mechanisms by which cooperative and coordinated behaviour can be achieved are (i) trust and reputation, and (ii) norms and conventions. Trust and reputation, which support cooperative and coordinated behaviour through notions of reciprocity, are effective in protecting agents from malicious or selfish individuals, but their capabilities can be affected by a lack of information about potential partners and the impact of the underlying network structure. Regarding conventions and norms, there are still a wide variety of open research problems, including: (i) manipulating which convention or norm a population adopts, (ii) how to exploit knowledge of the underlying network structure to improve mechanism efficacy, and (iii) how conventions might be manipulated in the middle and latter stages of their lifecycle, when they have become established and stable. In this thesis, we address these issues and propose a number of techniques and theoretical advancements that help ensure the robustness and efficiency of these mechanisms in the context of open MAS, and demonstrate new techniques for manipulating convention emergence in large, distributed populations. Specfically, we (i) show that gossiping of reputation information can mitigate the detrimental effects of <b>incomplete</b> information on <b>trust</b> and reputation and reduce the impact of network structure, (ii) propose a new model of conventions that accounts for limitations in existing theories, (iii) show how to manipulate convention emergence using small groups of agents inserted by interested parties, (iv) demonstrate how to learn which locations in a network have the greatest capacity to in uence which convention a population adopts, and (v) show how conventions can be manipulated in the middle and latter stages of the convention lifecycle...|$|R
