40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} joint source-channel coding problem of sending a memoryless source over a memoryless {{broadcast}} channel. An <b>inner</b> bound <b>and</b> several <b>outer</b> bounds on the achievable distortion region are derived, which respectively generalize and unify several existing bounds. As a consequence, we also obtain an <b>inner</b> bound <b>and</b> an <b>outer</b> bound for degraded broadcast channel case. When specialized to Gaussian source broadcast or binary source broadcast, the <b>inner</b> bound <b>and</b> <b>outer</b> bound not only recover {{the best known}} <b>inner</b> bound <b>and</b> <b>outer</b> bound in the literature, but also are used to generate some new results. Besides, we also extend the <b>inner</b> bound <b>and</b> <b>outer</b> bounds to Wyner-Ziv source broadcast problem, i. e., source broadcast with side information available at decoders. Some new bounds are obtained when specialized to Wyner-Ziv Gaussian case and Wyner-Ziv binary case. In addition, when specialized to lossless transmission of a source with independent components, the bounds for source broadcast problem (without side information) are also used to achieve an <b>inner</b> bound <b>and</b> an <b>outer</b> bound on capacity region of general broadcast channel with common messages, which respectively generalize Marton's <b>inner</b> bound <b>and</b> Nair-El Gamal <b>outer</b> bound to K-user broadcast channel case.

5|$|In the Holy Roman Empire, tall, {{free-standing}} wooden towers called Bergfriede were commonly {{built by}} the 11th century, either as part of motte-and-bailey designs or, as part of Hohenburgen castles, with characteristic <b>inner</b> <b>and</b> <b>outer</b> courts. Bergfriede, which take their name from the German for a belfry, had similarities to keeps, but are usually distinguished from them on account of Bergfriede having a smaller area or footprint, usually being non-residential and being typically integrated into the outer defences of a castle, rather than being a safe refuge of last resort.|$|E
5|$|Interaction between {{nanotubes}} {{or between}} a nanotube and another material may quench or increase PL. No PL is observed in multi-walled carbon nanotubes. PL from double-wall carbon nanotubes strongly {{depends on the}} preparation method: CVD grown DWCNTs show emission both from <b>inner</b> <b>and</b> <b>outer</b> shells. However, DWCNTs produced by encapsulating fullerenes into SWCNTs and annealing show PL only from the outer shells. Isolated SWCNTs lying on the substrate show extremely weak PL which has been detected in few studies only. Detachment of the tubes from the substrate drastically increases PL.|$|E
5|$|The asci {{are long}} and cylindrical, and taper into a short stem-like base; they measure 300–375 by 14–16µm. Although in most Pezizales all of the ascospores are formed {{simultaneously}} through delimitation by an <b>inner</b> <b>and</b> <b>outer</b> membrane, in S.coccinea the ascospores located in the basal parts of the ascus develop faster. The paraphyses (sterile filamentous hyphae present in the hymenium) are about 3µm wide (and only slightly thickened at the apex), and contain red pigment granules.|$|E

5|$|The castle {{is built}} to an Edwardian {{concentric}} design, with a {{keep in the}} south-eastern corner, protected by an <b>inner</b> <b>and</b> <b>outer</b> bailey with stone curtain walls extending out to the north-west. The castle is built using stones from the local beach bonded with a liquid mortar, with the finer stonework, such as the doorways and windows, made from red ashlar sandstone imported from the mainland. Much of the surrounding island has been eroded by the sea {{and some of the}} castle has been lost, with fallen stone fragments still visible on the beach below.|$|E
5|$|The concept, which {{originated}} in castles such as Krak des Chevaliers, was {{to remove the}} reliance on a central strongpoint and to emphasise the defence of the curtain walls. There would be multiple rings of defensive walls, one inside the other, with the inner ring rising above the outer so that its field of fire was not completely obscured. If assailants made it past {{the first line of}} defence they would be caught in the killing ground between the <b>inner</b> <b>and</b> <b>outer</b> walls and have to assault the second wall.|$|E

5|$|Though {{the details}} would be {{modified}} {{in light of}} his later work, Kepler never relinquished the Platonist polyhedral-spherist cosmology of Mysterium Cosmographicum. His subsequent main astronomical works were in some sense only further developments of it, concerned with finding more precise <b>inner</b> <b>and</b> <b>outer</b> dimensions for the spheres by calculating the eccentricities of the planetary orbits within it. In 1621, Kepler published an expanded second edition of Mysterium, half as long again as the first, detailing in footnotes the corrections and improvements he had achieved in the 25 years since its first publication.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the laminar {{boundary}} layer equations, the presence of two regimes governed by different sets of flow scales (i.e. the <b>inner</b> <b>and</b> <b>outer</b> scaling) has made finding a universal similarity solution for the turbulent {{boundary layer}} difficult and controversial. To find a similarity solution that spans both regions of the flow, {{it is necessary to}} asymptotically match the solutions from both regions of the flow. Such analysis will yield either the so-called log-law or power-law.|$|E
