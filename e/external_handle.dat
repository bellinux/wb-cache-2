The examination and implementation of the modelling und simulation of relevant processes within a realistic part of an air cargo network is the focal point of this article.

The outer shell of the grenade is aluminum, containing 43 grams of TNT and dinitronaphthalene with an internal wire wrapped around it that turns into shrapnel {{at the time of}} the explosion. It has two safeties, a manual one consisting of a crossbar with brass handle and an automatic one, consisting by a cross bar of aluminum connected to an <b>external</b> <b>handle.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{device is}} used in cardiothoracic {{surgical}} procedures like coronary artery bypass surgery, heart valve replacement and repair surgery or Ventricular Assist Device surgery to improve the evacuation of post-surgical blood from the pericardial and pleural spaces. The catheter system includes a chest tube and an internal clearance apparatus that allows clinicians to clear away obstructions that can form inside {{as a result of}} blood clotting. The clearance apparatus uses a wire with a loop that is magnetically coupled to an <b>external</b> <b>handle</b> to allow the obstructions to be cleared without breaking the sterile environment. If these obstructions are not cleared away, they can cause chest tube clogging, which can prevent fluid from draining and cause such clinical complications as pericardial tamponade, hemothorax, pleural effusions, and increased mortality. Conventional techniques to clear these obstructions, including chest tube milking and stripping, have not been shown to be effective. They also significantly increase negative intrathoracic pressures that can harm internal structures and potentially impair post-operative recovery. To combat the suboptimal methods of responding to chest tube clogging, many surgeons employ large-diameter chest tubes though they are thought to be associated with more pain.|$|E

40|$|To ecologists, {{factors such}} as a forager’s {{encounter}} rate with prey and its own susceptibility to predation are dominant determinants of foraging. In contrast, digestive physiologists consider foraging {{to be determined by}} factors like rates of digestion and absorption of ingested food. We reconcile these views in a model combining encounter rate, <b>external</b> <b>handling,</b> and internal handling of food in the gut. With internal food handling, two food properties become important; energy: <b>external</b> <b>handling</b> time (e/h) and energy: bulk (e/b). We show that internal handling is only one of a suite of rate limiting factors. The gut never reaches full capacity, indicating that spare capacity may be intrinsic to gut structure. Regardless of gut fullness, a food of sufficiently high e/b will always be harvested. Two isolegs in the state space of resource abundances determine diet selectivity. These isolegs, which we call the Mitchell and Pulliam isolegs, divide the state space into regions in which 1) the forager’s optimal strategy is opportunism; 2) the forager is always selective on the food with the greater e/ h and partially selective on the second food; 3) the forager is always selective on the food with the greater e/h and ignores the second food. The development and analysis of the isolegs thus reconcile the heretofore disparate perspectives of the ecological and the physiological frameworks of foraging...|$|R

In 1987, Pan Am Flight 125, another Boeing 747, outbound from London Heathrow Airport, encountered pressurization problems at 20000 ft, causing the crew to abort the flight and return to the airport. After the safe landing, the aircraft's cargo door was found to be ajar by about 1.5 in along its ventral edge. When the aircraft was examined in a maintenance hangar, all of the locking arms were found to be either damaged or sheared off entirely. Boeing initially attributed this to mishandling by ground crew. To test this concern, Boeing instructed 747 operators to shut and lock the cargo door with the <b>external</b> <b>handle,</b> and then activate the door-open switch with the handle still in the locked position.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The current {{technique}} of human pancreas digestion for islet isolation relies on selective distribution of collagenase delivered via the pancreatic duct to produce digestion and removal of peri-acinar fibrous tissue. However, the collagenase has relatively {{little effect on}} the interlobular fibrous tissue, which must therefore be broken down by mechanical means within the digestion chamber so as to release the contained acini and islets. The current way of achieving this in the Ricordi chamber is to place five or six stainless steel balls within the chamber and shake vigorously. The shaking presumably breaks down the interlobular fibrous tissue by a combination of shear force induced by the movement of tissue through the shaking process, assisted by numerous blows from the steel balls. Intuitively, one would expect some islets would be destroyed rather than released by such a battering. METHODS: In an attempt to improve the efficiency of islet isolation we have designed a new digestion/filtration chamber that consists of a glass cylinder, sealed with Teflon plates holding in mesh filters at each end, secured in place by a central threaded tie-rod and external knurled nuts. A ring-shaped piston within the cylinder can be pushed up and down the travel by two rods passing out through sealed ports in the Teflon disk at one end and connected to an <b>external</b> <b>handle.</b> The handle is used to gently push the piston up and down the travel of the cylinder, which pushes the fluid and tissue through the central lumen of the ring-piston. A series of hooks attached to the central tie-rod catch the fibrous strands of the passing tissue; the shearing forces produced cause disruption by a process thought to be similar to teasing the tissue apart with fine forceps. RESULTS: A series of initial experiments with human pancreas showed the prototype to be too large, causing temperature control problems, and a redesigned smaller chamber was produced, maintaining the crucial design features. Experience processing five human pancreata has now demonstrated that in three of five pancreata the new chamber produced a good yield (> 200, 000 I. E.) of remarkably well separated and intact islets, the entire dispersion process being under 1 hour. However, in two isolations the collagenase digestion was poor, with few free islets. A copy of the new chamber (reserved for porcine work only) has been produced, as well as a copy of the Ricordi chamber. We have confirmed that the new chamber can isolate porcine islets in large numbers (> 5000 islets/g pancreas [n = 2], but note that pig islets are small). CONCLUSION: These preliminary studies are sufficiently encouraging to justify further direct comparison with the Ricordi chamber for the purpose of animal and human islet isolation...|$|E

40|$|A novel {{packaging}} cum interfacing {{technique for}} icrofluidic devices is reported. Unlike the conventional approach towards packaging {{in which the}} microsystem is first developed and finally packaged, a reverse approach is shown here that integrates the package with the microsystem either at the beginning or within the fabrication process. This new method employs standard glass tubes as substrates on which microfluidic components are fabricated. The tubularsubstrate directly translates into a package and an interface, leading to plug-n-play devices. Due to this approach, <b>external</b> <b>handling</b> forces on the microfluidic system are redirected towards the strong glass tube, and thus, improves device robustness. Maintaining the total size of the microsystem within the circumference of the glass tube enables this MEMS-on-tube assembly to be encapsulated within standard Swagelok® connector...|$|R

40|$|Glycated Hemoglobin (HbA 1 c) is a {{long term}} blood glucose marker {{currently}} only available by laboratory testing. Main hurdle for point-of-care testing of HbA 1 c is the necessary on-chip sample preparation. One limiting factor {{is the lack of}} miniaturized, time-controlled liquid actuation functionality. In the presented concept electrochemical pumping in an active and disposable microfluidic lab-on-a-chip is used for the required flow control. In contrast to previous works the sample is directly used as working liquid for pumping and valving. A novel gelbased check valve approach is used to avoid undesired liquid movement towards the inlet of the chip. This method results in a miniaturization of the chip design and sample volume, the combination of passive and active microfluidics, and the elimination of <b>external</b> <b>handling</b> steps. The system utilizes well known technologies like hot embossing, physical vapor deposition (PVD) and laser micro machining to realize the innovative chip concept.
