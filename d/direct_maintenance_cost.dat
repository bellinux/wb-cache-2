40|$|Even as {{input costs}} {{continue}} to rise, globally, airlines are under constant pressure to maximize profits and reduce costs. To reduce the locking up of working capital, airlines adopt several cost cutting measures right from aircraft induction {{to phase out}} and stringent control of inventory. Material Planners {{play a key role}} in effecting this objective. Every on-time take-off of an aircraft is the result of various airline functions such as Operations, Ground Handling, Maintenance, Materials etc. working seamlessly together. A closer look at the materials ’ function reveals the complexity involved with meeting the service levels for maintenance. At the same time, they also face the challenge of being answerable to the top management on the inventory cost. Without Material Planners to ensure the availability of the right part, in the right quantity, at the right place, in the right condition, with the right quality and with the right certification, no single solution or single approach will be able to meet the objective. The following key areas play a vital role in achieving the desired objective of meeting the service levels: Spare Parts Management plays a vital role in any asset intensive organization, like Refineries, Fertilizers, Power plants, Airlines etc. One of the unique challenges of airline operations is that every key asset such as Aircrafts, Crew, Inventory, Spares etc. is on the move.

40|$|Abstract—The global {{economic}} downturn has significantly af-fected many industries, and {{the airline industry}} has not been left out. This has resulted in airlines {{looking for ways to}} reduce their cost of operation in order to make profits. The industry requires significant capital investment, but the returns do not match up in most cases. Optimization of maintenance provides an airline with a good oppor-tunity to reduce on <b>costs,</b> and especially <b>direct</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>costs,</b> since these normally account for 11 % of the total operating cost. Most airlines utilize the preventive maintenance strategy, with dif-ferent airlines having different approaches to the same. Very few airlines venture into the condition monitoring strategy. Most research work on maintenance optimization also centers around preventive maintenance. Further, very few {{attempts have been made to}} combine multiple maintenance strategies. This paper makes an attempt to combine two strategies, Preventive maintenance and condition monitoring. A simulation model has been developed to predict the maintenance requirement of aircraft in an airline operating under known conditions. This demand has then been subjected to both maintenance strategies, and the cost of applying each strategy has been determined. It can be concluded that by selectively applying and optimizing a combination of maintenance strategies, significant reductions in the <b>cost</b> of <b>direct</b> <b>maintenance</b> can be achieved.

40|$|An {{important}} aspect of infrastructure management is the scheduling of maintenance tasks, which implies the allocation of tasks to different crews or machines and the determination of an execution order. To this end, different aspects have to be considered. On the one hand, the maintenance operator is interested in reducing <b>direct</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>costs,</b> e. g. travel costs. On the other hand, priorities must be considered by scheduling maintenance tasks. Often, this is done by urgency rules, an inflexible method that resolves prioritised tasks first. In this paper, another approach is discussed. Instead of urgency rules, the maintenance tasks are afflicted with penalty costs {{that have to be}} paid for every day until the task is resolved. Then, the later the execution time of such a job, the higher are the penalty costs. By minimising the sum of penalty costs and travel costs, a solution with small overall costs can be found. The resulting scheduling problem is a multi-depot vehicle routing problem with travel and customer costs. For this extension of a vehicle routing problem, different formulations as mixed-integer linear program are developed. For small instances, these formulations are compared with respect to their computation time in a solution method that uses a commercial solver...|$|R
40|$|There are ambitious {{plans in}} place for the {{expansion}} of offshore wind-power capacity in the EU and elsewhere. However, the cost of energy from offshore wind is much higher than that from land-based generation and anything between 15 % and 30 % of this cost is attributable to the cost of operation and maintenance (O&M). For exposed UK round three sites these costs could be higher still. The stochastic nature of the occurrence of faults, down-times due to adverse weather and sea-state and the associated losses in energy production, as well as vessel and personnel costs, all add to the potential risk to the finance of an offshore wind farm project. There is a clear need to estimate these effects and the risks associated with them when planning and financing a wind-farm. Key to all such calculations are the restrictions on safe access for maintenance associated with vessels and access methods and the consequent delays caused by adverse sea-state and weather. A computational approach has been developed at University of Strathclyde, based on an event tree and closed-form probabilistic calculations, enabling very fast estimates to be made of offshore access probabilities and expected delays using a simple spreadsheet. Examples are presented for calculations of accessibility. Turbine availability and loss of energy production are calculated based on given turbine component reliability data together with an agreed maintenance scheme. <b>Direct</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>cost</b> and revenue lost due to down-time can also be calculated with suitable data on the costs of personnel, components, and vessel hire as well as electricity unit and ROC prices, and examples are given.

40|$|Beside {{purchasing}} {{crude oil}} <b>maintenance</b> <b>cost</b> {{is the second}} major element of refinery operational expenditures and hence its influence on refinery profit margins is very high. According to a comprehensive US survey {{it is estimated that}} about 40 % of refinery <b>maintenance</b> <b>costs</b> are in association with corrosion caused failures. It is also indicated that 10 – 40 % of the corrosion costs (according to the type of industry) can be avoided with operating appropriate corrosion management systems. Moreover indirect costs of corrosion (Loss of Gross Margin – LGM) due to unscheduled unit shutdowns and environmental pollution can be even one magnitude higher then direct costs. Corrosion failures not only increase <b>direct</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>costs</b> and indirect costs but are associated with high risk of accidents the frequency and severity of which has an increasing tendency worldwide. It was realized that the ambitious profit goals of MOL Group Refining cannot be accomplished without maintaining high asset availability by focusing on prevention and significantly reducing the frequency of corrosion failures. Refining management launched the 3 A (Anti-corrosion Application and Actions) initiative and a Corrosion Team was established with the following tasks: 1. Setting up effective corrosion management organizational structure for all MOL Group refineries. 2. Supporting work of Maintenance by unified corrosion failure reporting, compiling central corrosion database and applying advanced corrosion monitoring and inspection techniques. 3. Elaborating methodology for calculation of valid costs of corrosion prevention and mitigation. 4.

In the surveyed published literature, {{there is not a}} single model which incorporates all <b>maintenance</b> <b>cost</b> components to analyze the effect of different maintenance strategies for generator companies (GENCOs). The work enclosed in this thesis demonstrates that there is a considerable requirement for accurately modelling cost components of the maintenance model, to be used in maintenance scheduling for deregulated power system, in order to attain a superior schedule with major financial and operational impact. This research investigates and models most cost factors that affect the maintenance activities of the deregulated GENCOs, and demonstrates the utilization of the developed <b>cost</b> models in <b>maintenance</b> scheduling. It also presents the data gathering process for the developed <b>maintenance</b> <b>cost</b> model. A generator maintenance scheduling model that considers <b>direct</b> and indirect <b>maintenance</b> <b>costs,</b> opportunity costs (i. e. loss of customer goodwill), effective maintenance strategies, failures, and interruptions is developed. A Genetic Algorithm (GA) based approach is employed to achieve maintenance schedules to various generators maintenance scenarios. An Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) approach is proposed for modelling customer goodwill. The maintenance model was redeveloped under the Reliability Centred Maintenance (RCM) strategy to analyze the effect of a maintenance strategy on <b>maintenance</b> <b>costs.</b> Case studies are presented to demonstrate the utilisation of the developed models.

Dentre os materiais aplicados no reparo por soldagem de danos por cavitação incluem-se aços inoxidáveis tradicionais tipo AISI 308 e 309, aços inoxidáveis ao Co e ligas à base de Co (stellites), caracterizando-se essas últimas pela maior sensibilidade a trincas, dificuldade de esmerilhamento e pelo mais alto custo. Nesse contexto este trabalho buscou formular, depositar e analisar o desempenho de aços inoxidáveis austeníticos CrMnSiN, soldados pelo processo PTA.
