We investigate the structure of such binary codes and {{show that there is}} no such code with 2 codewords when is a power of 2. This implies that the known codes with 2 0 2 n codewords, when is a power of 2, are optimal. This result is then generalized to codes over GF (p), where p is a prime. A subclass of single-track Gray codes, called single-track Gray codes with k-spaced heads, is also defined. All known systematic constructions for single-track Gray codes result in codes from this subclass. We investigate this class and show it has a strong connection with two classes of sequences, the full-order words and the full-order self-dual words. We present an iterative construction for binary single-track Gray codes which are asymptotically optimal if an infinite family of asymptotically optimal seed-codes exists.

40|$|A (<b>cyclic)</b> <b>Gray</b> <b>code</b> is a (<b>cyclic)</b> {{sequence}} of all n-bit strings in which consecutive strings differ {{in a single}} bit. Ruskey and Savage in 1993 asked whether every matching in a hypercube can be extended to a <b>cyclic</b> <b>Gray</b> <b>code.</b> An affirmative answer is known for perfect matchings (Fink, 2007) while the ge- neral case is still open. The main contribution of this thesis is a generalization of Fink's result to Gray codes with prescribed ends. The characterization of perfect matchings extendable {{in this way is}} verified for n = 5 with the assistance of a com- puter, which is useful as a basis for the inductive proof of the general statement. The other part of the thesis is focused on smallest maximal matchings in hyper- cubes which could possibly form especially hard instances of the Ruskey-Savage problem. We devise a novel method which provides - in particular for small di- mensions - maximal matchings of smaller size than the classical asymptotically optimal construction (Forcade, 1973). An adjusted program from the first part is then applied to test the Ruskey-Savage problem over these matchings, however, the extending Gray code is always discovered. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractGiven a set H of binary vectors {{of length}} n, {{is there a}} cyclic listing of H so that every two {{successive}} vectors differ in a single coordinate? The problem {{of the existence of}} such a listing, which is called a <b>cyclic</b> <b>Gray</b> <b>code</b> of H, is known to be NP-complete in general. The goal of this paper is therefore to specify boundaries between its intractability and polynomial decidability. For that purpose, we consider a restriction when the vectors of H are of a bounded weight. A weight of a vector u∈{ 0, 1 }n is the number of 1 ’s in u. We show that if every vertex of H has weight k or k+ 1, our problem is decidable in polynomial time for k≤ 1 and NP-complete for k≥ 2. Furthermore, if k= 2 and for every i∈[n] there are at most m vectors of H of weight two having one in the i-th coordinate, then the problem becomes decidable in polynomial time for m≤ 3 and NP-complete for m≥ 13. The following complementary problem is also known to be NP-hard: given an F⊆{ 0, 1 }n, which now plays the role of a set of faults to be avoided, is there a <b>cyclic</b> <b>Gray</b> <b>code</b> of { 0, 1 }n∖F? We show that if every vertex of F has weight at most k, the problem is decidable in polynomial time for k≤ 2 and NP-hard for k≥ 5. It follows that there is a function f(n) =Θ(n 4) such that the existence of a <b>cyclic</b> <b>Gray</b> <b>code</b> of { 0, 1 }n∖F for a given set F⊆{ 0, 1 }n of size at most f(n) is NP-hard. In addition, we study the cases when the Gray code {{does not have to be}} cyclic, and moreover, when the first and the last vectors of the code are prescribed. For these two modifications, all NP-hardness and NP-completeness results hold as well...|$|R
