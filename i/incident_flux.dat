25|$|If the {{collisions}} of body A and the gravific {{particles are}} fully elastic, {{the intensity of}} the reflected particles would be as strong as of the incoming ones, so no net directional force would arise. The same is true if a second body B is introduced, where B acts as a shield against gravific particles in the direction of A. The gravific particle C which ordinarily would strike on A is blocked by B, but another particle D which ordinarily would not have struck A, is re-directed by the reflection on B, and therefore replaces C. Thus if the collisions are fully elastic, the reflected particles between A and B would fully compensate any shadowing effect. In order to account for a net gravitational force, it must be assumed that the collisions are not fully elastic, or at least that the reflected particles are slowed, so that their momentum is reduced after the impact. This would result in streams with diminished momentum departing from A, and streams with undiminished momentum arriving at A, so a net directional momentum toward the center of A would arise (P3). Under this assumption, the reflected particles in the two-body case will not fully compensate the shadowing effect, because the reflected flux is weaker than the <b>incident</b> <b>flux.</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{methodology}} for {{the estimation of}} ignition times on solid materials is presented.

40|$|International audienceWith the {{spreading}} of solar concentrating devices and artificial suns, {{it has become}} critical to characterize the <b>incident</b> heat <b>flux</b> at the focal spot of such devices. In this paper a new method that allows the determination of <b>incident</b> heat <b>flux</b> at the focal spot concentrating devices has been developed. This approach {{is based on an}} inexpensive experimental device and basic inverse methods which are used to compute a map of the <b>incident</b> heat <b>flux.</b> The experimental setup is made of a common steel screen and an IR camera. Starting at ambient temperature, the screen is exposed to the <b>incident</b> heat <b>flux.</b> The evolution of the screen temperature field over time is recorded using the IR camera. The inverse model then uses temperature data to compute a map of the <b>incident</b> heat <b>flux.</b> Results at moderate heat flux were validated by comparison with Gardon radiometer readings: the agreement between the two methods is very good. This method yields a high resolution map without the need of an external scaling factor which is mandatory in the method using a CCD camera. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
