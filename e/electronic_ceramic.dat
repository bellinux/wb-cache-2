40|$|Abstract. Ferroelectric {{properties}} of (Bi 1 / 2 Na 1 / 2) TiO 3 -SrTiO 3 were studied. The dielectric properties were measured at 1 KHz. It {{was found that}} the dielectric constants are improved with the increase of additive amount of BNT. If the amount continues increasing, the properties become worse, the optimum dielectric constant of the samples can reach 4300. When the proportion of (Bi 1 / 2 Na 1 / 2) TiO 3 : SrTiO 3 is 65 : 35, with the increase of additive amount of MnCO 3, the Curie temperature descends obviously. The dielectric constant increased at beginning and dropped sharply when the amount of MnCO 3 exceeds 1. 1 wt%. High voltage ceramic capacitors are indispensably components in high-power and high voltage electronic products. High voltage ceramic capacitors should be minitype and possess high voltage resistance and temperature stability, so the high dielectric constant (εr), low dielectric loss (tgδ) and small temperature coefficient (∆c/c) are exigent.

Both BSCF and SCF were found to have high oxygen nonstoichiometry. However, BSCF possessed a higher oxygen nonstoichiometry than SCF at room temperature, but a similar value at high temperatures. This resulted in the lower chemical expansion for BSCF than SCE The doping of Ba 2 + in SCF led to the decrease of the electronic conductivity, but an increase in the oxygen ionic conductivity. The oxygen permeation study of the BSCF membrane demonstrated that the permeation rate was mainly rate-determined by the slow surface exchange kinetics at the oxygen lean side (or reaction side) membrane surface. The high ionic conductivity and the slow surface exchange kinetics resulted in the surface oxygen partial pressure at the reaction side membrane surface to be much higher than the surrounded atmosphere, therefore protecting the BSCF membrane from reduction.
