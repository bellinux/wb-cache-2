5|$|According to the United Nations, Chad {{has been}} {{affected}} by a <b>humanitarian</b> <b>crisis</b> since at least 2001. , the country of Chad hosts over 280,000 refugees from the Sudan's Darfur region, over 55,000 from the Central African Republic, as well as over 170,000 internally displaced persons.|$|E

Upon her return home, Jolie contacted the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for information on international trouble spots. To learn more about the conditions in these areas, she began visiting refugee camps around the world. In February 2001, she went on her first field visit, an 18-day mission to Sierra Leone and Tanzania; she later expressed her shock at what she had witnessed.|$|E
40|$|Background Water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) {{interventions}} are amongst {{the most crucial}} in <b>humanitarian</b> <b>crises,</b> although {{the impact of the}} different WASH interventions on health out-comes remains unclear.

Methods A systematic literature review was conducted of primary and grey quantitative literature on WASH interventions measured against health outcomes in <b>humanitarian</b> <b>crises</b> occurring from 1980 – 2014. Populations of interest were those in resident in humanitarian settings, with a focus on acute crisis and early recovery stages of <b>humanitarian</b> <b>crises</b> in low and mid-dle-income countries.

5|$|Following the storm, a government-endorsed {{disaster}} relief program was initiated {{to mitigate the}} developing <b>humanitarian</b> <b>crisis</b> in the three hardest-hit communes. The program was to distribute emergency food rations to 40,000 affected individuals, with special supplies intended to reach 1,500 malnourished children. A malnutrition rehabilitation center was established in Mahavelona {{as part of the}} program, which cost approximately $1.2 million (1996 USD) in total, and funded partially by the United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DHA). At the end of February, the Government of Madagascar requested international aid; by March 6, France and Germany had donated a combined $100,000 in assistance funds, as well as emergency supplies worth nearly $80,000. Overall, the DHA handled roughly $450,000 in foreign donations, mostly from Europe. United States Ambassador to Madagascar, Vicki J. Huddleston, authorized the allocation of $25,000 to distribute tarps, while the United States Agency for International Development sent $17,000 for medical treatment.|$|E
5|$|Material worn {{from the}} margins of the land {{eventually}} ends up in the sea, where it is subject to attrition as currents flowing parallel to the coast scour out channels and transport material away from its place of origin. Sediment carried to the sea by rivers settles on the seabed causing deltas to form in estuaries. All these materials move back and forth under the influence of waves, tides, and currents. Dredging removes material and deepens channels but may have unexpected effects elsewhere on the coastline. Governments make efforts to prevent flooding through building breakwaters, seawalls, and other defenses against the sea. In Britain, the Thames Barrier protects London from storm surges, while the failure of the dykes and levees around New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina created a <b>humanitarian</b> <b>crisis</b> in the United States. Land reclamation in Hong Kong permitted the construction of Hong Kong International Airport through the leveling and expansion of two smaller islands.|$|E
5|$|Militants {{of unknown}} {{affiliation}} fired rockets at United Nations World Food Program (UNWFP) planes on 8 June near Luena and again near Kuito {{a few days}} later. As the first plane, a Boeing 727, approached Luena someone shot a missile at the aircraft, damaging one engine but not critically as the three-man crew landed successfully. The plane's altitude, , most likely prevented the assailant from identifying his target. As the citizens of Luena had enough food to last them several weeks, the UNFWP temporarily suspended their flights. When the flights began again a few days later, militants shot at a plane flying to Kuito, the first attack targeting UN workers since 1999. The UNWFP again suspended food aid flights throughout the country. While he did not claim responsibility for the attack, UNITA spokesman Justino said the planes carried weapons and soldiers rather than food, making them acceptable targets. UNITA and the Angolan government both said the international community needed to pressure the other side into returning to the negotiating table. Despite the looming <b>humanitarian</b> <b>crisis,</b> neither side guaranteed UNWFP planes safety. Kuito, which had relied on international aid, only had enough food to feed their population of 200,000 {{until the end of}} the week. The UNFWP had to fly in all aid to Kuito and the rest of the Central Highlands because militants ambushed trucks. Further complicating the situation, potholes in the Kuito airport strip slowed aid deliveries. Overall chaos reduced the amount of available oil to the point at which the UN had to import its jet fuel.|$|E

5|$|The {{offensive}} displaced 10,000 Serb {{refugees from}} Mrkonjić Grad, adding {{to a growing}} <b>humanitarian</b> <b>crisis</b> as another 30,000 Serbs fled Sanski Most before the ARBiH captured it {{in the final days}} of Operation Sana. Approximately 6,000 non-Serbs were forced to flee their homes in Prijedor and Novi Grad by Bosnian Serb forces. According to Bosnian Serb sources, 480 Serbs died or went missing in the fighting in the area of Mrkonjić Grad. The figure includes 181 bodies recovered in a mass grave at the town's Serbian Orthodox cemetery. According to the Republika Srpska police who investigated the scene and interviewed witnesses, most of the dead were VRS prisoners of war or civilians who were killed by the 4th Guards Brigade to avenge the death of Colonel Andrija Matijaš, the brigade's deputy commander. The results of the investigation were forwarded to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), but the ICTY did not pursue the matter. , an investigation by the Bosnia and Herzegovina authorities against 27 high-ranking HV and HVO officers and Croatian officials is ongoing. In 2013, an officer and two soldiers of the 7th Guards Brigade charged with killing four Serb civilians near Mrkonjić Grad were acquitted, pending appeal.|$|E
