5|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} patterns of <b>gas</b> <b>exchange</b> demonstrated by different groups of insects. <b>Gas</b> <b>exchange</b> patterns in insects can range from continuous and diffusive ventilation, to discontinuous <b>gas</b> <b>exchange.</b> During continuous <b>gas</b> <b>exchange,</b> oxygen is taken in and carbon dioxide is released in a continuous cycle. In discontinuous <b>gas</b> <b>exchange,</b> however, the insect takes in oxygen while it is active and small amounts of carbon dioxide are released when the insect is at rest. Diffusive ventilation is simply a form of continuous <b>gas</b> <b>exchange</b> that occurs by diffusion rather than physically taking in the oxygen. Some species of insect that are submerged also have adaptations to aid in respiration. As larvae, many insects have gills that can extract oxygen dissolved in water, while others need {{to rise to the}} water surface to replenish air supplies, which may be held or trapped in special structures.|$|E
5|$|The lungs {{of birds}} contain {{millions}} of tiny parallel passages called parabronchi. Small sacs called atria radiate {{from the walls}} of the tiny passages; these, like the alveoli in other lungs, are the site of <b>gas</b> <b>exchange</b> by simple diffusion. The blood flow around the parabronchi and their atria forms a cross-current process of <b>gas</b> <b>exchange</b> (see diagram on the right).|$|E

40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} the <b>gas</b> <b>exchanges</b> of different species of Annonaceae due to environmental variations provided by different types of crop protection. 'Araticum-de-terra-fria', 'araticum-mirim', 'biribá' and atemoya seedlings were cultived in three different crop protections: nursery, greenhouse and warm house. Gas exchanges were obtained in six plants, from 9 : 00 am to 11 : 00 am, with IRGA, LI- 6400, at 180 Days After Transplanting. The different types of crop protection had a direct influence on <b>gas</b> <b>exchanges</b> of these species. Thus, nursery provided suitable conditions for 'araticum-de-terra-fria', 'araticum-mirim' and 'biribá', increasing their <b>gas</b> <b>exchanges.</b> To atemoya the best crop protection was the greenhouse...|$|R

30|$|Figure  95 {{shows the}} mean values of PaO 2 during the {{different}} phases of WLL. During bipulmonary ventilation <b>gas</b> <b>exchanges</b> improved {{in response to}} FiO 2 1 and PEEP. Monopulmonary ventilation, instead, induced a clear reduction of PaO 2, which increased in lateral position and during liquid tidal ventilation, with a substantial effect of elevated hydrostatic lavage pressures.

5|$|Due to this {{extremely}} thin membranous tissue, a bat's wing {{can significantly}} {{contribute to the}} organism's total <b>gas</b> <b>exchange</b> efficiency. Because of the high energy demand of flight, the bat's body meets those demands by exchanging gas through the patagium of the wing. When the bat has its wing in an open/spread out position it allows {{for an increase in}} surface area to volume ratio. The surface area of the wings is about 85% of the total body surface area, suggesting the possibility of a useful amount of <b>gas</b> <b>exchange.</b> The subcutaneous vessels in the membrane very close to the surface allow for the diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide.|$|E
5|$|<b>Gas</b> <b>exchange</b> and {{excretion}} {{is accomplished}} by diffusion through the tentacles and internal and external body wall, aided by the movement of fluid being wafted along these surfaces by cilia. The sensory system consists of simple nerve nets in the gastrodermis and epidermis, {{but there are no}} specialised sense organs.|$|E
5|$|One {{or more of}} the {{abdominal}} segments, starting with the sixth segment, is fused to the telson (terminal section) to form a rigid pleotelson. The first five abdominal segments each bear a pair of biramous (branching in two) pleopods (lamellar structures which serve the function of <b>gas</b> <b>exchange,</b> and in aquatic species serve as gills and propulsion), and the last segment bears a pair of biramous uropods (posterior limbs). In males, the second pair of pleopods, and sometimes also the first, are modified for use in transferring sperm. The endopods (inner branches of the pleopods) are modified into structures with thin, permeable cuticles (flexible outer coverings) which act as gills for <b>gas</b> <b>exchange.</b> In some terrestrial isopods, these resemble lungs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: At present, {{in order}} to improve the yield of grasslands, {{artificial}} grasslands are largely constructed, which has a great significance to improve the ecological environment. The researches on greenhouse gases (Carbon Dioxide, Methane and Nitrous Oxide) fluxes of artificial grassland are lacking and the exchange of fluxes has a great impact on global greenhouse gases balance. We summarize the researching progress on greenhouse <b>gases</b> <b>exchanging</b> fluxes from artificial grassland, and we analyze the similarities and differences of greenhouse <b>gases</b> <b>exchanging</b> fluxes between artificial grasslands and natural grasslands by the way of comparisons...|$|R
5|$|The major {{function}} of the lungs is <b>gas</b> <b>exchange</b> between the lungs and the blood. The alveolar and pulmonary capillary gases equilibrate across the blood–air barrier, a very thin diffusion membrane which is only, on average, about 2μm thick, consisting of {{the walls of the}} pulmonary alveoli, consisting of the alveolar epithelial cells, their basement membranes and the endothelial cells of the pulmonary capillaries. This membrane is folded into about 300 million small air sacs called alveoli (each between 75 and 300µm in diameter) branching off from the bronchioles in the lungs, thus providing an extremely large surface area (estimates varying between 70 and 145m2) for <b>gas</b> <b>exchange</b> to occur.|$|E
5|$|A {{study by}} Divers Alert Network in 2004 {{suggests}} that {{addition of a}} deep (c. 15m) {{as well as a}} shallow (c. 6m) safety stop to a theoretically no-stop ascent will significantly reduce decompression stress indicated by precordial doppler detected bubble (PDDB) levels. The authors associate this with <b>gas</b> <b>exchange</b> in fast tissues such as the spinal cord and consider that an additional deep safety stop may reduce the risk of spinal cord decompression sickness in recreational diving.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{have a very}} {{efficient}} system for diffusing oxygen into the blood; birds have a ten times greater surface area to <b>gas</b> <b>exchange</b> volume than mammals. As a result, birds have more blood in their capillaries per unit of volume of lung than a mammal. The arteries are composed of thick elastic muscles to withstand {{the pressure of the}} ventricular constriction, and become more rigid as they move away from the heart. Blood moves through the arteries, which undergo vasoconstriction, and into arterioles which act as a transportation system to distribute primarily oxygen as well as nutrients to all tissues of the body. As the arterioles move away from the heart and into individual organs and tissues they are further divided to increase surface area and slow blood flow. Blood travels through the arterioles and moves into the capillaries where <b>gas</b> <b>exchange</b> can occur.|$|E
30|$|Beyond partial liquid ventilation, {{previous}} {{strategies of}} TLV were also tested in animal models of ARDS in the past. Most studies used much higher filling volume (20 – 30  ml/kg) and tidal volume (20 – 30  ml/kg) {{than we did}} in the present study [13, 17, 19]. For example, Pohlmann et al. improved <b>gas</b> <b>exchanges</b> in sheep after experimental ARDS using TLV with an initial filling with 30  ml/kg of perfluorocarbons, a frequency of 5  cycle per min and a tidal volume of 15 – 20  ml/kg during 24  h [17]. In another report, Avoine et al. used similar TLV parameters which improved <b>gas</b> <b>exchanges</b> after meconium aspiration [19]. However, such respiratory parameters during TLV were associated with high pulmonary pressures, e.g., 28 – 30  cmH 2 O for TLV peak pressures which might again be poorly tolerated on the longer term. In comparison, airways pressures were much lower in the present study. Lung volumes were also strongly reduced, i.e., below 15 – 20  ml/kg for expiratory residual volumes. Using such parameters, {{we were not able to}} improve <b>gas</b> <b>exchanges</b> as compared to LPV but a compromise should be made between the short-term need of <b>gas</b> <b>exchanges</b> improvement and the long-term hazards of lung trauma. In previous reports, we indeed demonstrated that low-volume TLV was much better tolerated regarding systemic and pulmonary hemodynamic [24]. In addition, hypothermic TLV could be done with low tidal volumes with no significant impact on <b>gas</b> <b>exchanges,</b> due to the reduced oxygen demand and carbon dioxide production during hypothermia. This is another argument in the favor of hypothermic TLV which is likely easier to implement in patients for these reasons. In the context of hypothermic TLV for post-cardiac arrest treatment, we could therefore speculate that such procedure is safe in both healthy [25] and damaged lungs after aspiration.|$|R

30|$|Artificial {{membrane}} lung (AL) <b>gas</b> <b>exchanges</b> {{are usually}} evaluated according to PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio. in addition, dead space ventilation and shunt fraction {{can be measured}} by the same equations used for native lungs [1].|$|R
5|$|Some {{invertebrates}} have lung-like {{structures that}} serve a similar respiratory purpose as, {{but are not}} evolutionarily related to, vertebrate lungs. Some arachnids, such as spiders and scorpions, have structures called book lungs used for atmospheric <b>gas</b> <b>exchange.</b> Some species of spider have four pairs of book lungs but most have two pairs. Scorpions have spiracles on their body for the entrance of air to the book lungs.|$|E
5|$|The air sacs, which hold air, do not {{contribute}} much to <b>gas</b> <b>exchange,</b> despite being thin-walled, {{as they are}} poorly vascularised. The air sacs expand and contract due {{to changes in the}} volume in the thorax and abdomen. This volume change is caused by the movement of the sternum and ribs and this movement is often synchronised with movement of the flight muscles.|$|E
5|$|Type I are {{squamous}} {{epithelial cells}} {{that make up}} the alveolar wall structure. They have extremely thin walls that enable an easy <b>gas</b> <b>exchange.</b> These type I cells also make up the alveolar septa which separate each alveolus. The septa consist of an epithelial lining and associated basement membranes. Type I cells are not able to divide, and consequently rely on differentiation from Type II cells.|$|E
30|$|Pleural effusions (PE) {{are common}} in {{intensive}} care unit (ICU) patients, especially in patients under mechanically ventilation. Since PE can alter <b>gas</b> <b>exchanges,</b> one could hypothesize that PE could {{play a role in the}} outcome of weaning from mechanical ventilation.|$|R
30|$|In a {{model of}} primary ARDS, we found that {{different}} methods to recruit the lungs produce similar results on <b>gas</b> <b>exchanges</b> and Ers, but consistently impair mucus clearance. Likely, the distinctive inspiratory airflow patterns generated by RMs are major culprit in these findings.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate leaf <b>gas</b> <b>exchanges</b> of sweet corn {{as a function of}} defoliation when submitted to different irrigation depths. The experimental design was randomized blocks in split-plot scheme, with four irrigation depths in the plots [50, 75, 100 and 125 % of crop evapotranspiration (ETc) ], and three levels of defoliation in the subplots (0 %, control; 35 %, removal of four fully expanded leaves; 100 %, total removal of the leaves - section of the aerial part) with three replicates. Defoliation was manually performed when the plant had four fully expanded leaves. It was verified that the dephs of irrigation and defoliation levels affect leaf <b>gas</b> <b>exchanges</b> in sweet corn plants, allowing the conclusion that the plant tends to activate a mechanism of photosynthetic compensation, when subjected to leaf stress, which can vary according to the degree of severity and water availability to which it is submitted. The most expressive values of <b>gas</b> <b>exchanges</b> in sweet corn plants that did not have defoliation were generally observed at irrigation depths estimated between 87 and 99 % ETc and, in the treatments with defoliation, regardless of the level, at irrigation depth of 125 % ETc...|$|R
5|$|Diffuse panbronchiolitis (DPB) is an {{inflammatory}} lung disease of unknown cause. It is a severe, progressive form of bronchiolitis, {{an inflammatory}} {{condition of the}} bronchioles (small air passages in the lungs). The term diffuse signifies that lesions appear throughout both lungs, while panbronchiolitis refers to inflammation found in all layers of the respiratory bronchioles (those involved in <b>gas</b> <b>exchange).</b> DPB causes severe inflammation and nodule-like lesions of terminal bronchioles, chronic sinusitis, and intense coughing with large amounts of sputum production.|$|E
5|$|Hennessy {{concludes that}} if the un{{dissolved}} and dissolved gas content of a tissue cannot be independently measured {{either directly or indirectly}} then the safe maximum limits relative to the ambient pressure cannot be accurately determined through decompression trials and it will not be possible to systematically develop a comprehensive biophysical model for <b>gas</b> <b>exchange.</b> He proposes a best fit double compartment model for dissolved gas and a single compartment model for undissolved gas as these are the simplest models consistent with available data.|$|E
5|$|In {{the initial}} phase of decompression, the {{critical}} event {{is assumed to}} be the arrival of an arterial bubble in a de-saturating neurological tissue. The bubble exchanges gas with the surrounding tissue and the blood. If the bubble does not exceed a critical radius, it will eventually leave the site without growing, otherwise it will block the blood circulation and cause ischemia. The critical parameter is bubble radius. This criterion is used to prevent type II neurological symptoms. The strategy for a safe rate of ascent at this stage is to balance <b>gas</b> <b>exchange.</b>|$|E
40|$|Biological {{nitrogen}} fixation (BNF) in soybean {{is vulnerable to}} drought; however, there are genotypic variations among soybean cultivars regarding the ability to keep BNF under moderate water restriction. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate parameters related to <b>gas</b> <b>exchanges</b> and regulation of BNF in soybean genotypes BNF drought-tolerant (R 01 - 581 F and R 01 - 416 F), or drought-susceptible (CD 215 and BRS 317), submitted to adequate water supply or restriction between 45 and 55 days after emergence. We searched for traits associated with tolerance/susceptibility to drought, which might be useful in the selection of drought-tolerant soybean genotypes. Plant biomass was not affected under water restriction, but the number and dry weight of nodules reduced by 33 % and 12 %, respectively, in the average of genotypes. Drought-tolerant genotypes were more effective in maintaining <b>gas</b> <b>exchanges</b> under water restriction. Under water restriction, all genotypes increased the concentration of ureides in nodules, but only the susceptible genotypes showed that in leaves. The maintenance of <b>gas</b> <b>exchanges</b> and N metabolism regulation under water restriction in genotype R 01 - 581 F suggests that these parameters may be used to characterize soybean genotypes that can be sources of drought tolerance in genetic breeding programs. 201...|$|R

5|$|Low oxygen levels and, eventually, {{high carbon}} dioxide {{levels in the}} blood can occur from poor <b>gas</b> <b>exchange</b> due to {{decreased}} ventilation from airway obstruction, hyperinflation and a reduced desire to breathe. During exacerbations, airway inflammation is also increased, resulting in increased hyperinflation, reduced expiratory airflow and worsening of gas transfer. This {{can also lead to}} insufficient ventilation and, eventually, low blood oxygen levels. Low oxygen levels, if present for a prolonged period, can result in narrowing of the arteries in the lungs, while emphysema leads to breakdown of capillaries in the lungs. Both these changes result in increased blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries, which may cause cor pulmonale.|$|E
5|$|Narcosis {{has been}} {{compared}} with altitude sickness regarding its variability of onset (though not its symptoms); its effects depend on many factors, with variations between individuals. Thermal cold, stress, heavy work, fatigue, and carbon dioxide retention all increase the risk and severity of narcosis. Carbon dioxide has a high narcotic potential and also causes increased {{blood flow to the}} brain, increasing the effects of other gases. Increased risk of narcosis results from increasing the amount of carbon dioxide retained through heavy exercise, shallow or skip breathing, or because of poor <b>gas</b> <b>exchange</b> in the lungs.|$|E
5|$|The major {{means of}} {{respiration}} in teleosts, {{as in most}} other fish, is the transfer of gases {{over the surface of}} the gills as water is drawn in through the mouth and pumped out through the gills. Apart from the swim bladder, which contains a small amount of air, the body does not have oxygen reserves, and respiration needs to be continuous over the fish's life. Some teleosts exploit habitats where the oxygen availability is low, such as stagnant water or wet mud; they have developed accessory tissues and organs to support <b>gas</b> <b>exchange</b> in these habitats.|$|E
25|$|A Bruce {{exercise}} test involved {{walking on}} a treadmill while the heart was monitored by an electrocardiograph with various electrodes attached to the body.

40|$|Preserving {{cucumber}} (Cucumis sativus L.) quality by film wrapping {{is common}} practice in Sweden. Nevertheless, no theoretical background is available to explain {{the choice of the}} films currently used. A better understanding of the phenomena involved in preserving quality by film wrapping of greenhouse cucumbers can be achieved by means of mathematical modelling of the <b>gas</b> <b>exchanges.</b> An apparatus controlled by a computer was developed to measure <b>gas</b> <b>exchanges</b> in fresh produce. The transpiration and respiration rates evolution of film-wrapped cucumbers was investigated by emulation of the different gas levels present in the packages. A modification of this set-up was used to study the effect of various films on preserving the quality of cucumbers. In further experiments, the influence of surrounding conditions on the respective role of cuticular and stomatal permeability in the <b>gas</b> <b>exchanges</b> was investigated. It appeared that a reduction of moisture loss was of highest importance in the preservation of cucumber mass. Both respiration and transpiration rates were strongly influenced by the surrounding temperature and relative humidity. The transpiration rate under constant conditions decreased rapidly resulting in severe loss of quality directly after harvest. Film wrapping reduced significantly the effect of surrounding temperature and relative humidity. Moreover the introduction of a modified atmosphere inside the packages reduced both respiration and transpiration rates. However, the appearance of water vapour condensation inside the film favours microbial hazard. Based on data from the experiments and known physiological and physical phenomena, a mathematical model of the <b>gas</b> <b>exchanges</b> was designed. Two versions were derived to study the gas concentration in a jar corresponding to the experiments, as well as giving a closer insight into what happens between the epidermis and a film. These models take into account many parameters relative to the cucumber such as permeability, degree of opening or distribution of stomata. Furthermore, film properties such as thickness, size of perforation or permeability could also be investigated. Simulations from the implementation of the mathematical model enable theoretical studies of the importance of those parameters when direct measurements are not possib...|$|R
