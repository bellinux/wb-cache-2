30|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to propose an {{approach}} to automatically extract the <b>hot</b> <b>topics</b> and reveal the topic evolution patterns. Different from other studies, we extract the <b>hot</b> <b>topics</b> composed of focal terms and several facet terms that represent the different aspects of the topic. With the trend analysis, we found that <b>hot</b> <b>topics</b> evolve differently; that is, some <b>hot</b> <b>topics</b> last with the same focus for a long time, some <b>hot</b> <b>topics</b> last but with changing focus; some <b>hot</b> <b>topics</b> emerge and fade out quickly; and some <b>hot</b> <b>topics</b> are split into several <b>hot</b> <b>topics.</b> The evolution pattern makes it easier for users to identify patterns that correlate with merging and branching, yet more in-depth analysis of the internal relationship between hot tops remains to be further examined.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, through {{analysis}} {{of the structure of}} web news texts, we have proposed an improvement measure for term weighting in <b>hot</b> <b>topics</b> detection, and a topic weighting scheme for <b>hot</b> <b>topics</b> ranking. Experiment result comparison shows that our method is effective and ranking of <b>hot</b> <b>topics</b> is closer to reality...|$|R
30|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a framework-based {{representation}} of <b>hot</b> <b>topics</b> composed of focal term and facet term. Based on this framework, an algorithm {{is presented to}} discover the key terms and related terms to form the <b>hot</b> <b>topics.</b> The applications on real datasets from an educational blog and a “parent–child” forum have shown that our approach can effectively identify term clusters as <b>hot</b> <b>topics</b> in online learning communities and reveal the topic evolution patterns over time.|$|R

30|$|Therefore, {{to better}} {{understand}} what <b>hot</b> <b>topics</b> are discussed in online learning communities becomes an important task. Herein, by saying “hot topic”, we refer to the topics that appear frequently in online learning communities {{during a period of}} time. Through exploiting the <b>hot</b> <b>topics</b> and tracking the trend of a specific topic, it would help learners keep abreast of popular, new and intertwining topics over time. Especially for a novice, he or she can quickly gain an insight of a certain theme by simply {{taking a look at the}} <b>hot</b> <b>topics.</b>|$|R

40|$|Microblogging {{as a kind}} {{of social}} network has become more and more {{important}} in our daily lives. Enormous amounts of information are produced and shared on a daily basis. Detecting <b>hot</b> <b>topics</b> in the mountains of information can help people get to the essential information more quickly. However, due to short and sparse features, a large number of meaningless tweets and other characteristics of microblogs, traditional topic detection methods are often ineffective in detecting <b>hot</b> <b>topics.</b> In this paper, we propose a new topic model named multi-attribute latent dirichlet allocation (MA-LDA), in which the time and hashtag attributes of microblogs are incorporated into LDA model. By introducing time attribute, MA-LDA model can decide whether a word should appear in <b>hot</b> <b>topics</b> or not. Meanwhile, compared with the traditional LDA model, applying hashtag attribute in MA-LDA model gives the core words an artificially high ranking in results meaning the expressiveness of outcomes can be improved. Empirical evaluations on real data sets demonstrate that our method is able to detect <b>hot</b> <b>topics</b> more accurately and efficiently compared with several baselines. Our method provides strong evidence {{of the importance of the}} temporal factor in extracting <b>hot</b> <b>topics...</b>|$|R
25|$|Testing {{procedures}} were a frequent flashpoint of controversy, with various factions vying {{for control of}} the examination criteria.

25|$|Not {{surprisingly}} network economics {{became a}} <b>hot</b> <b>topic</b> after {{the diffusion of}} the Internet across academia.

25|$|GUIs were a <b>hot</b> <b>topic</b> in {{the early}} 1980s.

The October 2005 issue of Chemistry & Biology contained an article describing the use of fullerenes as light-activated antimicrobial agents.|$|E
40|$|News blog <b>hot</b> <b>topics</b> are {{important}} for the information recommendation service and marketing. However, information overload and personalized management make the information arrangement more difficult. Moreover, what influences the formation and development of blog <b>hot</b> <b>topics</b> is seldom paid attention to. In order to correctly detect news blog <b>hot</b> <b>topics,</b> the paper first analyzes the development of topics in a new perspective based on W 2 T (Wisdom Web of Things) methodology. Namely, the characteristics of blog users, context of topic propagation and information granularity are unified to analyze the related problems. Some {{factors such as the}} user behavior pattern, network opinion and opinion leader are subsequently identified to be important for the development of topics. Then the topic model based on the view of event reports is constructed. At last, <b>hot</b> <b>topics</b> are identified by the duration, topic novelty, degree of topic growth and degree of user attention. The experimental results show that the proposed method is feasible and effective...|$|R

25|$|At {{the time}} of Suzuki's arrival, Zen had become a <b>hot</b> <b>topic</b> amongst some groups in the United States, {{especially}} beatniks.

Kato had done some presentations at the Academy and asked Suzuki to come join a class he was giving there on Buddhism. This sparked Suzuki's long-held desire to teach Zen to Westerners.|$|E
