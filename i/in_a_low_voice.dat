25|$|Вполголоса (Half-Whispered or <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> <b>voice,</b> 1928) {{contained}} 38 {{poems and}} {{was dedicated to}} Tsuberbiller. Eighteen of the poems were written in 1926 and the other twenty were written the following year. The name, literally sotto voce, reflected the dark thoughts which had pervaded her life over the period, worries of isolation, madness, and death, sprinkled with a few rare lyrics of rapture and vigor.|$|E
500|$|Tatiana {{was also}} fond of an officer named Vladimir Kiknadze, whom she cared {{for when he}} was wounded in 1915 and again in 1916, {{according}} to the diary of Valentina Ivanovna Chebotareva, a nurse who worked with Tatiana during the war. Chebotareva described how Tatiana sometimes sat beside [...] "Volodia" [...] at the piano as he played a tune with one finger and talked to her <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> <b>voice,</b> wearing a mysterious expression on his face. Chebotareva also described how Tatiana and her sister Olga made excuses {{to come to the}} hospital to see Volodia. Chebotareva felt the flirtations between the grand duchesses and the wounded officers could cause gossip and damage the girls' reputations.|$|E
2500|$|The priest quietly says several prayers here, before {{receiving}} Communion. The {{first is}} said <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> <b>voice</b> while {{taking up the}} Host onto the paten. [...] The second of them, spoken {{three times in a}} slightly audible voice, while the priest holds the Host in his left hand and strikes his breast with his right, is based on : [...] "Lord, I am not worthy...." [...] Then, after having reverently consumed the Host, he takes up the chalice while <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> <b>voice</b> reciting : [...] "What shall I render to the Lord, for all the things he hath rendered unto me? I will take the chalice of salvation; and I will call upon the name of the Lord." [...] immediately adding : [...] "Praising I will call upon the Lord: and I shall be saved from my enemies." ...|$|E

60|$|HENRY: (<b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> dulcet <b>voice,</b> {{touching}} {{the strings of}} his guitar) There is a flower that bloometh.|$|R
2500|$|Blessing. [...] The celebrant {{places his}} joined {{hands on the}} altar and says <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> <b>voice</b> the prayer Placeat tibi, sancta Trinitas for himself and those for whom he has offered Mass. Then he kisses the altar and, turning towards the congregation, blesses them [...] "in nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti", making over them {{the sign of the}} cross.|$|E
2500|$|Sanctus. [...] Following the preface, {{the ministers}} recite {{the full text}} of the Sanctus <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> <b>voice,</b> and the choir begins to sing it. While the celebrating priest then quietly says the Canon of the Mass, the choir {{continues}} its singing of the Sanctus, pausing before the part that begins with [...] "Benedictus qui venit", which it sings after the consecration.|$|E
2500|$|Epistle. Towards {{the end of}} the collect (or {{the last}} collect if there be more than one) the Master of Ceremonies heads to the {{credence}} table to get the Epistolary or book of readings. He hands it to the Subdeacon, who bows to the crucifix at {{the end of the}} collect, if the Holy Name of Jesus is mentioned, reverences the altar and then the liturgical choir (as opposed to the musical choir) if there be one. He then stands on the floor aligned somewhat behind the Celebrant and chants the Epistle or other reading proper to the day. Meanwhile, the Priest too recites the Epistle <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> <b>voice,</b> and the Deacon, also <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> <b>voice,</b> responds [...] "Deo gratias" [...] ("Thanks be to God") at the end. The Subdeacon next reverences the choir, and then the altar. Ascending the steps to where the Celebrant is, he kneels while the Priest blesses him, then kisses the hand of the Celebrant, who has placed it on the Epistolary. He then hands the Epistolary to the Master of Ceremonies, who puts it back on the credence table or in some other appropriate place.|$|E

60|$|He {{stopped a}} moment with a little groan, while Appleby {{regarded}} him compassionately, and then continued <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> strained <b>voice.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Gospel. While {{the choir}} sings the Gradual and Alleluia (or Tract) the subdeacon carries the missal to the Gospel {{side of the}} altar where the priest will read the Gospel <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> <b>voice.</b> [...] Meanwhile, the Master of Ceremonies takes the Gospel book off the {{credence}} table and gives it to the deacon who then places it on the altar. [...] After the celebrant finishes reading the Gospel, the sacred ministers go {{to the center of}} the altar and the Celebrant places incense in the thurible in the usual manner. [...] The two acolytes with candles, the Master of Ceremonies, the thurifer with the thurible, the subdeacon, and the deacon with the Gospel book assemble at the bottom of the altar steps, genuflect, and go in procession to the Gospel side of the sanctuary. [...] The subdeacon holds the Gospel book while the deacon sings the Gospel.|$|E
2500|$|Gloria in Excelsis. Toward {{the end of}} the Kyrie, {{the sacred}} ministers walk (still staying in a line) {{to the center of the}} altar. If they have been sitting, all rise, save the celebrant, who waits until his biretta has been {{collected}} by the deacon. The three sacred ministers genuflect at the foot of the altar steps, then ascend and form a line. (The deacon and subdeacon usually lift the ends of the celebrant's alb whenever they ascend the steps together, and place their closest hand under his elbows when they descend together.) The celebrant intones, i.e. sings the first few words of, the Gloria, after which the choir sings the rest and the deacon and subdeacon ascend the steps to stand at either side of the celebrant, while he says <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> <b>voice</b> the remainder of the Gloria independently of the choir. When they are finished they remain in this position until the singing is nearly done or, if it is a long musical setting, they may go down and sit (first genuflecting), as mentioned above at the Kyrie. (Note: The Gloria is omitted from Masses of the season during Advent, Septuagesima, Lent, and Passiontide, as well as from ferias outside Christmastide, Epiphanytide, and Paschaltide.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Introit. This {{text of the}} Mass varies daily. It usually {{consists}} of Scriptural or religious text, followed by a Psalm verse, followed by the Doxology. Then the Scriptural or religious text is repeated. This is usually being sung while the sacred ministers are saying the Prayers at the Foot of the Altar mentioned above and while they incense the altar. After Prayers at the Foot of the Altar, the sacred ministers ascend {{the steps to the}} altar, the thurifer brings his thurible, or censer, and a 'boat' of incense. The celebrant places incense into the thurible, blesses it and then proceeds to cense the altar, accompanied by the other ministers. After he is finished, he hands the thurible to the deacon and the deacon censes him. The thurible is then given back to the thurifer, who departs to the sacristy until he is needed again. The sacred ministers then form a [...] "semicircle" [...] (really a line) on the altar steps—the celebrant on the top platform (called a footpace), the deacon on a middle step, and the sub-deacon on the bottom step. The Master of Ceremonies then helps the celebrant find his place in the Missal. The priest makes {{the sign of the cross}} and recites <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> <b>voice</b> to himself the Introit that the choir has already sung. All bow with him when he recites the Doxology. Meanwhile, the choir, after completing the Introit, begins to sing the Kyrie Eleison.|$|E

2500|$|Parnok’s {{works are}} filled with the timbre of tragedy and the melody of coincidence. Her first poem was printed in 1906 and her last, the week before her death. Her first {{collection}} Стихотворения (Poems) was published in 1916 and her last book of works Вполголоса (Half-Whispered or <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> <b>voice)</b> was published in 1928. She created five books of poems, more than 30 critical essays, and several translations. Sofia Polyakova, editor of Parnok's Collected Works, preserved 261 of her poems. Because she chose to live openly and write about her relationships with seven women – to each of whom she dedicated several poems – she {{came to be called}} the [...] "Russian Sappho". Much of the scholarly work focused on Parnok has centered around the period of her relationship with Tsvetaeva;, yet many of her [...] "best poems" [...] were created after 1928. Nearly 100 poems, written between 1928 and 1933 were never published until long after her death. Poems from her Vedeneyeva period reflect both material and spiritual intake and musical and creative output. They incorporate the themes running through all her works: [...] "anguish, poetry, the elements (wind, water, earth, fire), heat and cold, illness, madness, remembering, and death". Parnok's mature poetry showed a simpler use of language, shorter lines and rhythmic variation. While rejecting the Romantic poetry of previous eras, Parnok conveyed passion through the use of commonplace straightforward language. Her style employs rhetorical questioning, as if she is having conversations with herself, indicators that even in the presence of others, Parnok felt removed from them.|$|E
2500|$|A costly canopy {{has been}} erected {{over the seat}} of the exilarch. Then the leader in prayer steps in front of the {{platform}} and, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> <b>voice</b> audible only to those close by, and accompanied by the 'Amen' of the choir, addresses the exilarch with a benediction, prepared long beforehand. Then the exilarch delivers a sermon on the text of the week or commissions the gaon of Sura to do so. After the discourse the leader in prayer recites the kaddish, and when he reaches the words 'during your life and in your days,' he adds the words 'and during the life of our prince, the exilarch.' After the kaddish he blesses the exilarch, the two heads of the schools, and the several provinces that contribute to the support of the academies, as well as the individuals who have been of especial service in this direction. Then the Torah is read. When the 'Kohen' and 'Levi' have finished reading, the leader in prayer carries the Torah roll to the exilarch, the whole congregation rising; the exilarch takes the roll in his hands and reads from it while standing. The two heads of the schools also rise, and the gaon of Sura recites the targum to the passage read by the exilarch. When the reading of the Torah is completed, a blessing is pronounced upon the exilarch. After the 'Musaf' prayer the exilarch leaves the synagogue, and all, singing, accompany him to his house. After that the exilarch rarely goes beyond the gate of his house, where services for the community are held on the Sabbaths and feastdays. When it becomes necessary for him to leave his house, he does so only in a carriage of state, accompanied by a large retinue. If the exilarch desires to pay his respects to the king, he first asks permission to do so. As he enters the palace the king's servants hasten to meet him, among whom he liberally distributes gold coin, for which provision has been made beforehand. When led before the king his seat is assigned to him. The king then asks what he desires. He begins with carefully prepared words of praise and blessing, reminds the king of the customs of his fathers, gains the favor of the king with appropriate words, and receives written consent to his demands; thereupon, rejoiced, he takes leave of the king." ...|$|E
