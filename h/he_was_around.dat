25|$|After {{playing for}} local clubs, {{he joined the}} Leicestershire CCC ground staff as a fast bowler in 1905 but, because he wore spectacles, was not re-engaged {{at the end of}} the season.

He made his debut in county cricket in 1912, and played fairly regularly in the two seasons before the first world war. It was in the middle and late 1920s, however, when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>around</b> his 40th year and far past the retirement age of most bowlers of his pace, that he showed remarkable skill as a genuinely fast bowler.

25|$|In {{contrast}} to Galligan, {{many of the}} supporting actors and actresses were better known. Veteran actor Glynn Turman portrayed the high school science teacher whose study of a newborn Mogwai leads to his death after it forms a cocoon and emerges as a vicious gremlin. Dick Miller, who was a regular in Dante's films, was another experienced actor on the set, playing a World War II veteran who first refers to the creatures as gremlins. Rand was played by Hoyt Axton, who was always the filmmakers' preferred choice for the role {{even though it was}} widely contested by other actors. Axton's experience included acting as the father in The Black Stallion (1979), and he was also a country music singer-songwriter. After an introductory scene to Gremlins was cut, Axton's voice earned him the added role of the narrator to establish some context. Mr. Wing was played by Keye Luke, a renowned film actor, whose film career spanned half a century. Although in reality <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>around</b> 80 at the time of filming, and his character was very elderly, Luke's youthful appearance had to be covered by make-up.|$|E
25|$|Despite his father's disapproval, Sugizo {{acquired}} a bass guitar and an electric guitar, {{and began to}} teach himself how to play. When <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>around</b> the age of 17, then in high school, Sugizo with Shinya on drums and Tezya on vocals formed a power metal band called Pinocchio, where he played as the bassist. Since the internal structure of Pinocchio was not cohesive, they left and briefly joined Kashmir in 1988. On January 16, 1989, they both joined another band which performed at the same live houses, called Lunacy, formed by J and Inoran. With the addition of Ryuichi Kawamura, vocalist from the band Slaughter, the five formed the visual kei rock unit Lunacy. Since J was already the bass player and Inoran preferred to play rhythm guitar, Sugizo became the lead guitarist and took on his stage name, which he believes Shinya came up with. Soon they were discovered by hide (then lead guitarist of X Japan), who got them signed by X Japan co-founder Yoshiki, to his independent label Extasy Records, on which they released their debut album in 1991. Upon their first album release, the band changed their name from Lunacy to Luna Sea. They {{became one of the}} most famous rock bands in Japan, selling more than ten million records, as well performing in China and Taiwan.|$|E
25|$|Equiano recounted an {{incident}} when an attempted kidnapping of children was foiled by adults in his Igbo village, Essaka, {{in the southeastern}} part of present-day Nigeria. When <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>around</b> the age of eleven, he and his sister were left alone to look after their family premises – as was common when adults {{went out of the}} house to work. They were both kidnapped and taken far away from their hometown of Essaka, separated and sold to slave traders. After changing ownership several times, Equiano met his sister again, but they were again separated, and he was taken across a large river to the coast, where he was held by European slave traders. He was transported with 244 other enslaved Africans across the Atlantic Ocean to Barbados in the West Indies. He and a few other slaves were sent further away to the British colony of Virginia. Literary scholar Vincent Carretta argued in his 2005 biography of Equiano that the activist could have been born in colonial South Carolina rather than Africa based on his discovery of a 1759 parish baptismal record that lists Equiano's place of birth as Carolina and a 1773 ship's muster that indicates South Carolina. A number of scholars agree with Carretta, while his conclusion is disputed by other scholars who believe the weight of evidence supports Equiano's account of coming from Africa.|$|E
