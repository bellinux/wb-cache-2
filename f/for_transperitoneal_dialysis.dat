40|$|Introduction: Individuals with {{autosomal}} dominant {{polycystic kidney disease}} (ADPKD) frequently suffer arterial hypertension even prior to significant loss of renal function, a clinical situation that obscures detection of modifiable secondary causes of hypertension. Presentation of case: A 50 -year-old man with ADPKD and polycystic liver and resistant hypertension is diagnosed with a 4 -cm right adrenal mass. Cross-sectional MRI is indicative of pheochromocytoma versus adrenocortical carcinoma or metastasis, though there are no typical PCC symptoms and plasma and urine metanephrines are within normal ranges. Since malignancy cannot be excluded, right adrenalectomy is performed. Considering that the enlarged liver poses an obstacle <b>for</b> <b>transperitoneal</b> open and laparoscopic approaches, a retroperitoneoscopic approach is used. Surgical pathology reveals a 4. 5 -cm pheochromocytoma; the patient no longer requires antihypertensive therapy. Discussion & conclusion: Pheochromocytoma is a rare but treatable cause of hypertension in ADPKD; given the anatomical complexities these patients present, careful preoperative planning and surgical technique are essential to a favorable outcome...|$|R

40|$|The {{anatomy of}} the {{inguinal}} region appears different by laparoscopic approach vs. open technique. There are some laparoscopic landmarks wich are useful <b>for</b> <b>transperitoneal</b> treatment of the groin hernias: in the midline, the median umbilical fold contains the obliterated urachus, the paired medial umbilical folds correspond to the umbilical arteries (obliterated to fibrous remnants) and more laterally, the less proeminent paired lateral umbilical folds contain the inferior epigastric artery. Associated with these 5 folds it was described three paired fossae: supravesical (site of a rare type of indirect hernia), medial umbilical fossa (corresponds to Hesselbach's triangle - site of direct hernia) and lateral umbilical fossa (corresponds to the deep inguinal ring - site of indirect hernias). The femoral fossa overlies the femoral canal and is below the lateral inguinal fossa, separated from it by the iliopubic tract. The extraperitoneal approach for groin hernia is also described; the landmarks for this technique are: bladder, Cooper's ligament, iliopubic tract, inferior epigastric vessels, gonadal vessels and the ductus deferens. The dissection of the anatomic landmarks, herniorrhaphy technique and Nyhus's classification are also presented. Conclusions: Laparoscopic approach for groin hernia are fesible.

We describe our technique <b>for</b> <b>transperitoneal</b> laparoscopic robotic-assisted nephropexy. The surgery was performed on a 78 -year-old woman with a BMI of 18 and ASA 2. The diagnosis of nephroptosis was preoperatively confirmed by excretory urography in the supine and upright positions. The patient was placed in Trendelemburg position on the left side. The laparoscopic surgery was performed, through a transperitoneal approach, using the daVinci system: the ptosic kidney was fixed using two separated stiches of non-absorbable prolene 2. 0 between the superior surface of the kidney and the quadratus lumborum muscle. The sutures were fixed using Hem-o-lok clips. Intra- or post-operative complications have not occurred. The effectiveness of treatment was demonstrated by an intravenous urography 60 days after. Robotic-assisted nephropexy is a safe and effective procedure that leads to both clinical and aesthetic excellent results, comparable to the ones obtained with the laparoscopic approach for the treatment of symptomatic renal ptosis. The robotic-assisted nephropexy appears to be easier, with the particular advantages of the intracorporeal suturing and a better intraoperative view; the sliding-clips method allows reducing the organ trauma to the minimum...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} to describe our experience with pelvic and aortic laparoscopic lymphadenectomy and evaluate the safety and feasibility of this procedure for gynecologic malignancies. From January 2004 to December 2015, a laparoscopic pelvic and/or aortic lymphadenectomy was performed in 372 women at the Department of Gynecology Oncology of the University General Hospital of Castellon and at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of Sant Pau and Santa Tecla Tarragona Hospitals. Out of the 372 cases, 240 combined pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomies were performed, while 108 and 24 patients underwent pelvic and aortic lymphadenectomy respectively. The mean operative times were 40 min (20 - 89) in order to perform a complete pelvic lymphadenectomy, 62 min (21 - 151) <b>for</b> <b>transperitoneal</b> aortic lymphadenectomy and 45 min (35 - 65) for a retroperitoneal approach.

40|$|ABSTRACT Purpose To {{determine}} whether using different intraperitoneal insufflation pressures <b>for</b> <b>transperitoneal</b> laparoscopic urologic surgeries decreases postoperative pain. Materials and Methods 76 patients who underwent transperitoneal laparoscopic upper urinary tract surgery at different insufflation pressures were allocated {{into the following}} groups: 10 mmHg (group I, n= 24), 12 mmHg (group II, n= 25) and 14 mmHg (group III, n= 27). These patients were compared according to age, gender, body mass index (BMI), type and duration of surgery, intraoperative bleeding volume, postoperative pain score and length of hospital stay. A visual analog scale (VAS) was used for postoperative pain. Results Demographic characteristics, mean age, gender, BMI and type of surgeries were statistically similar among the groups. The mean operation time was higher in group I than group II and group III {{but this was not}} statistically significant (P= 0. 810). The mean intraoperative bleeding volume was significantly higher in group I compared with group II and group III (P= 0. 030 and P= 0. 006). The mean length of postoperative hospital stays was statistically similar among the groups (P= 0. 849). The mean VAS score at 6 h was significantly reduced in group I compared with group III (P= 0. 011). At 12 h, the mean VAS score was significantly reduced in group I compared with group II and group III (P= 0. 009 and P< 0. 001). There {{was no significant difference in}} the mean VAS scores at 24 h among three groups (P= 0. 920).

40|$|Dialysate and serum {{concentrations}} of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), soluble TNF-receptor I (sTNFRI) and soluble TNF-receptor II (sTNFRII) were measured during stable and infectious CAPD {{to determine whether}} these mediators are released intraperitoneally or derived from the circulation. Dialysate/serum ratios were compared to those of various marker proteins for peritoneal transport and to interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), which is locally produced. Peritoneal immunoreactive TNF-alpha could be detected in 19 of 20 stable CAPD patients after a night dwell, but only occasionally and in lower concentrations during and after a standard four-hour peritoneal permeability test. Both sTNFRs highly exceeded TNF-alpha dialysate concentrations. In case of peritonitis a median 16 -fold increase in dialysate TNF-alpha occurred on the first day, which declined towards control values during a longitudinal follow-up of eight consecutive days. sTNFRI and sTNFRII in dialysate increased three- to fourfold. Their peaks, however, appeared on the second peritonitis day. Bioactive TNF-alpha was only detected when immunoreactive levels exceeded 1000 pg/ml. Serum values of all variables were not altered during infection; sTNFRs exceeded TNF-alpha 300 - to 400 -fold. During stable CAPD indirect evidence was obtained <b>for</b> <b>transperitoneal</b> transport from plasma to dialysate of TNF-alpha (molecular wt 17 kD), sTNFRI (55 kD) and sTNFRII (75 kD). Dialysate/serum (D/S) ratios were higher, the lower the molecular weight; they were related to D/S ratios of those marker proteins with the nearest molecular weight; D/S ratios were unrelated to the intraperitoneally produced IL- 6. Furthermore, the observed D/S ratios were as expected theoretically for their molecular weights. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R

The {{aim of this}} study was to compare these two routes of exposure. Over a 10 year period, between 1979 and 1989, 48 patients were operated on for an aortobifemoral bypass, because of occlusive diseases of aorta or iliac arteries. The retroperitoneal approach was used in 20 cases and 28 were operated by the standard transperitoneal approach. In a non randomized retrospective study the outcome was compared regarding; operation time, blood transfusion during operation, initiation of alimentation, hospitalisation and mortality. All of the patients were operated on by two experienced vascular surgeons. In the retroperitoneal group there were 11 men and 10 women with a mean age of 63, 4 years. In the transperitoneal group there were 16 men and 10 women with a mean age of 60, 3 years. With the retroperitoneal approach the operating time was 185 min. v. 248 min. <b>for</b> the <b>transperitoneal</b> group (p< 0. 05).

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} perioperative outcomes of robotic-assisted laparoscopic para-aortic lymphadenectomy (PAL) in patients with gynecologic cancers during the learning phases of robotic surgery programs and to compare results of extraperitoneal versus transperitoneal approaches of PAL. Materials and Methods: This study is a retrospective multicentric study of patients who underwent robotically assisted laparoscopic PAL (N = 487). Eleven European centers and 1 US center participated in the study. Abstracted data included age, body mass index, indication, type of surgical approach (transperitoneal or extraperitoneal), associated surgical procedures, operative time, estimated blood loss, lymph node count, hospital length of stay (LOS), and complications. Para-aortic lymphadenectomy was performed by an extraperitoneal approach in 58 cases (12 %) and transperitoneal in 429 cases (88 %). Results: The mean (SD) para-aortic lymph node count was 12. 6 (8. 1), operative time was 217 (85) minutes, estimated blood loss was 105 (110) mL, and LOS was 2. 8 (3. 2) days. Four (0. 8 %) conversions to open and 2 (0. 4 %) conversions to laparoscopy were described. There were 32 lymphocysts (6. 6 %), 3 deep venous thromboses (0. 6 %), and 10 transfusions (2. 1 %). <b>For</b> <b>transperitoneal</b> approach, the average number of lymph nodes removed was higher in isolated PAL group than the hysterectomy combined group (report node counts 95 % confidence interval, - 7. 29 to - 3. 52, P = 1. 5 × 10 - 6). For isolated PAL, the LOS was shorter in the extraperitoneal group than in the transperitoneal group (report data 95 % CI, - 1. 35 to - 0. 35, P = 0. 001). Conclusions: Robotic-assisted PAL seems safe and feasible. More lymph nodes were removed during an isolated transperitoneal PAL dissection compared with a combined procedure with hysterectomy. Extraperitoneal approach seems attractive relative to transperitoneal dissection, but the superiority of one or the other way is not demonstrated by our study.

40|$|Objective: We {{sought to}} compare current {{practices}} in patient selection and 30 -day outcomes <b>for</b> <b>transperitoneal</b> and retroperitoneal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repairs. Methods: All patients undergoing elective transperitoneal or retroperitoneal surgical repair for AAA between January 2011 and December 2013 {{were identified in}} the Targeted Vascular National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database. Emergency cases were excluded. Baseline characteristics, anatomic details, and intraoperative and postoperative outcomes were evaluated among those with infrarenal or juxtarenal AAA only. Results: We identified 1135 patients: 788 transperitoneal (69 %) and 347 retroperitoneal (31 %). When only infrarenal and juxtarenal AAAs were evaluated, the retroperitoneal patients {{were less likely to}} have an infrarenal clamp location (43 % vs 68 %) and had more renal revascularizations (15 % vs 6 %; P <. 001), more visceral revascularizations (5. 6 % vs 2. 4 %; P =. 014), and more lower extremity revascularizations (11 % vs 7 %; P =. 021) compared with the transperitoneal approach. Postoperative mortality and return to the operating room were similar. Transperitoneal patients had a higher rate of wound dehiscence (2. 4 % vs 0. 4 %; P =. 045), and retroperitoneal patients had higher incidence of pneumonia (9 % vs 5 %; P =. 034), transfusion (77 % vs 71 %; P =. 037), and reintubation (11 % vs 7 %; P =. 034), and a longer median length of stay (8 vs 7 days; P =. 048). After exclusion of all concomitant procedures, only transfusions remained more common in the retroperitoneal approach (78 % vs 70 %; P =. 036). Multivariable analyses showed only higher rates of reintubation in the retroperitoneal group (odds ratio, 1. 7; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 0 - 3. 0; P =. 047). Conclusions: The retroperitoneal approach is more commonly used for more proximal aneurysms and was associated with higher rates of pneumonia, reintubation, and transfusion, and a longer length of stay on univariate analyses. However, multivariable analysis demonstrated similar results between groups. The long-term benefits and frequency of reinterventions remain to be proven...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The retroperitoneal {{approach}} for abdominal aortic and iliac reconstruction classically had been reserved for select patients with either high-risk comorbid disease or specific anatomic problems that preclude the transabdominal approach. With increasing {{appreciation of the}} physiologic, anatomic, and technical advantages of the retroperitoneal approach, the authors have expanded its use for repair {{of all types of}} aorto-iliac artery disease as well as infected aortic grafts. The objective {{of this article is to}} determine whether retroperitoneal {{approach for}} aorto-iliac surgery has greater physiologic and technical advantages than transperitoneal approach. Patients and Methods: From January 2002 to May 2006, 344 retroperitoneal aortoiliac reconstructions were performed and 2 for infected aortic grafts. On the other hand we also performed 283 transperitoneal aortic and aorto-iliac reconstructions. From total number of operated patients for aorto-iliac disease, 99 patients fulfilled criteria for entrance in the study. Beside identical operative indication (aorto-iliac disease), patients were matched according to comorbidities, age, gender, and bad habits such as smoking and alcohol abuse. Results: The mean age was 61 years with 70 men and 29 women. Overall mortality was 1 % for all cases: 2 % for trnasperitoneal and 0 % for retroperitoneal approach. Major complications occurred in 11 % of all procedures, 8 % in retroperitoneal and 14 % in transperitoneal approach. Over the past 4. 5 years, the average length of hospital stay for uncomplicated aorto-iliac reconstructions was 5. 9 days in retroperitoneal group and 6. 3 days in transperitoneal group, intensive care unit stay was 1. 2 days in retroperitoneal and 2. 5 days in transperitoneal group, and diet was resumed by postoperative day 1 in retroperitoneal versus postoperative day 3 in transperitoneal group. Two-year graft patency was 99 % for retroperitoneal and 96 % <b>for</b> <b>transperitoneal</b> approach. Discussion: The retroperitoneal approach offers greater physiologic advantages than transperitoneal approach, associated with minimal disturbance of gastrointestinal and respiratory function, thereby reducing the length of intensive care unit and hospital stay...|$|R

From 1994 to 2001, forty consecutive patients underwent laparoscopic adrenalectomy, 37 with transperitoneal and 3 with retroperitoneal approach. The mean operative time was 129 +/- 51. 7 minutes (range 60 - 300) : 107 +/- 29 minutes (range 60 - 100) <b>for</b> the right-sided <b>transperitoneal</b> adrenalectomy and 144 +/- 62 minutes (range 90 - 300) <b>for</b> the left-sided <b>transperitoneal</b> adrenalectomy.

Dialysate and serum concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), soluble TNF-receptor I (sTNFRI) and soluble TNF-receptor II (sTNFRII) were measured during stable and infectious CAPD {{to determine whether}} these mediators are released intraperitoneally or derived from the circulation. Dialysate/serum ratios were compared to those of various marker proteins for peritoneal transport and to interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), which is locally produced. Peritoneal immunoreactive TNF-α could be detected in 19 of 20 stable CAPD patients after a night dwell, but only occasionally and in lower concentrations during and after a standard four-hour peritoneal permeability test. Both sTNFRs highly exceeded TNF-α dialysate concentrations. In case of peritonitis a median 16 -fold increase in dialysate TNF-α occurred on the first day, which declined towards control values during a longitudinal follow-up of eight consecutive days. sTNFRI and sTNFRII in dialysate increased three- to fourfold. Their peaks, however, appeared on the second peritonitis day. Bioactive TNF-α was only detected when immunoreactive levels exceeded 1000 pg/ml. Serum values of all variables were not altered during infection; sTNFRs exceeded TNF-α 300 - to 400 -fold. During stable CAPD indirect evidence was obtained <b>for</b> <b>transperitoneal</b> transport from plasma to dialysate of TNF-α (molecular wt 17 kD), sTNFRI (55 kD) and sTNFRII (75 kD). Dialysate/serum (D/S) ratios were higher, the lower the molecular weight; they were related to D/S ratios of those marker proteins with the nearest molecular weight; D/S ratios were unrelated to the intraperitoneally produced IL- 6. Furthermore, the observed D/S ratios were as expected theoretically for their molecular weights. Higher than expected D/S ratios were found during peritonitis for TNF-α on days 1 and 2, and for sTNFRII on day 2, pointing to local release within the peritoneal cavity only in the acute inflammatory phase. Gel permeation chromatography revealed that TNF-α was present in a monomeric 17 kD form, unbound to receptors, whereas in case of peritonitis smaller sTNFRII fragments, transported at a higher rate, could not be excluded. Therefore, these higher than expected D/S ratios indicate local production of TNF-α during peritonitis and possibly also of sTNFRII, although transport of smaller receptor fragments might also occur...|$|R

Materials and Methods: Male rats were randomly divided into three groups (n= 15 in each) : the control group, the transperineal ligation group, and the transperitoneal ligation group. Four weeks after the ligation procedure, cystometrography was performed and oxidative stress, pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, and histologic changes were evaluated. Oxidative stress was assessed by measuring 8 -hydroxy- 20 -deoxyguanosine and superoxide dismutase, and pro-inflammatory cytokine activity was investigated by measuring levels of interleukin (IL) - 6, IL- 8, and tumor necrosis factor-α. Results: The transperineal model led to results similar to those observed <b>for</b> the <b>transperitoneal</b> model, namely (1) increased voiding frequency and reductions in the non-voiding contraction interval and the maximal vesical pressure, (2) increased levels of oxidative stress markers, (3) increased pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, and (4) fibrotic changes in the bladder tissue.

A laparoscopic right adrenalectomy was performed in a 22 -year-old woman who suffered from a right surrenalian adenoma. Four trocars were used <b>for</b> the <b>transperitoneal</b> laparoscopic approach with the patient in the lateral decubitus position. After isolation of the medial margin of the gland and clipping and sectioning of the main adrenal vein, {{the right side of}} the vena cava was injured during dissection of the right upper pole, due to the use of monopolar scissors. The hemorrhage was managed immediately with the aid of fenestrated atraumatic forceps and an aspiration probe. A fifth trocar was inserted to evaluate the size of the lesion, which was then sutured laparoscopically with croised 5 / 0 nonresorbable stitches. No transfusion was needed. Operating time was 210 min. The post-operative course was uneventful. Hospital stay was 7 days. At 10 -month follow-up, the patient had no problems related to the intraoperative complication. Our preliminary experience shows that the laparoscopic approach enables safer management of lesions involving large abdominal vessels. We believe that the transperitoneal approach is the preferential route for laparoscopic adrenalectomies.

40|$|Context Postoperative enteral {{nutrition}} {{is thought to}} reduce complications and speed recovery after pancreatic resection. There is little evidence on the best route for delivery of {{enteral nutrition}}. Currently we use percutaneous transperitoneal jejunostomy or percutaneous transperitoneal gastrojejunostomy, or the nasojejunal route to deliver enteral nutrition, according to surgeon preference. Objective To compare morbidity, efficiency, and safety of these three routes for enteral nutrition following pancreaticoduodenectomy. Patients Data were obtained from a prospectively maintained database, for all patients undergoing pancreatic resection between January 2007 and June 2008. One-hundred pancreatic resected patients underwent enteral nutrition: 93 had Whipple’s operations and 7 had total pancreatectomies. Intervention Enteral nutrition was delivered by agreed protocol, starting within 24 h of operation and increasing over 2 - 3 days to meet full nutritional requirement. Results Delivery route of enteral nutrition was: percutaneous transperitoneal jejunostomy in 25 (25 %), percutaneous transperitoneal gastrojejunostomy in 32 (32 %) and nasojejunal in 43 (43 %). The incidence of catheter-related complications was higher in percutaneous techniques: 24 % in percutaneous transperitoneal jejunostomy and 34 % in percutaneous transperitoneal gastrojejunostomy as compared to nasojejunal technique (12 %). Median time to complete establishment of oral intake was 14, 14 and 10 days in percutaneous transperitoneal jejunostomy, percutaneous transperitoneal gastrojejunostomy, and nasojejunal groups, respectively.

40|$|Since {{the first}} laparoscopic adrenalectomy, the {{technique}} has evolved {{and it has}} become the standard of care for many adrenal diseases, including pheochromocytoma. Two laparoscopic accesses to the adrenal have been developed: transperitoneal and retroperitoneal. Retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy may be recommended for the treatment of pheochromocytoma with the same peri-operative outcomes of the transperitoneal approach because it allows direct access to the adrenal glands without increasing the operative risks. Although technically more demanding than the transperitoneal approach, retroperitoneoscopy can shorten the mean operative time, which is critical for cases with pheochromocytoma where minimizing the potential for intra-operative hemodynamic changes is essential. Blood loss and the convalescence time can be also shortened by this approach. There is no absolute indication <b>for</b> either the <b>transperitoneal</b> or retroperitoneal approach; however, the latter procedure may be the best option for patients who have undergone previous abdominal surgery and obese patients.

We documented the results of patients who underwent HALS for AIOD in our hospitals. Materials and Methodsfrom January 1999 to December 2002, 33 consecutive patients underwent HALS for AIOD. Peri- and postoperative results were prospectively registered. Three different laparoscopic approaches were applied: transperitoneal, retroperitoneal and apron approach. ResultsThere were 23 males and 10 females, {{with a mean age of}} 59 years (range 39 – 85). The surgical technique applied was: transperitoneal: 22 patients, retroperitoneal: 7 patients, apron: 4 patients. Per-operative results (median) of the transperitoneal, retroperitoneal and apron approach are: operating time 240, 420 and 263 minutes, cross clamp time 32. 5, 40 and 33. 5 minutes, blood loss 1150, 2100 and 950 ml, respectively. Postoperatively oral intake was fully resumed in 3, 4. 5 and 2 days after performing the transperitoneal, retroperitoneal and apron technique. During the ICU stay patients received artificial respiration for 0, 1 and 0 days, admission to the ICU was 0. 5, 1 and 0. 75 days <b>for</b> the <b>transperitoneal,</b> retroperitoneal and apron approach. Finally, hospital stay was 8, 12. 5 and 7 days after the transperitoneal, retroperitoneal and apron approach. Four patients (12 %) had a minor complication, 4 patients (12 %) had a major complication; pneumonia with ARDS, sepsis, bypass occlusion and chylo-abdomen. No patients died. ConclusionsHALS for AIOD is a technically demanding operation with a long learning curve. All three approaches are feasible. In this series of patients, we feel the transperitoneal and apron approach have the most advantages because of the larger working space. Finally, randomized trials will determine if laparoscopic assisted or total laparoscopic aortoiliac surgery has the potential to reduce morbidity for the patient compared to the conventional technique...|$|R
40|$|Context: {{postoperative}} {{enteral nutrition}} {{is thought to}} reduce complications and speed recovery after pancreatic resection. There is little evidence on the best route for delivery of enteral nutrition. Currently we use percutaneous transperitoneal jejunostomy or percutaneous transperitoneal gastrojejunostomy, or the nasojejunal route to deliver enteral nutrition, according to surgeon preference. Objective: to compare morbidity, efficiency, and safety of these three routes for enteral nutrition following pancreaticoduodenectomy. Patients: data were obtained from a prospectively maintained database, for all patients undergoing pancreatic resection between January 2007 and June 2008. One-hundred pancreatic resected patients underwent enteral nutrition: 93 had Whipple’s operations and 7 had total pancreatectomies. Intervention: enteral nutrition was delivered by agreed protocol, starting within 24 h of operation and increasing over 2 - 3 days to meet full nutritional requirement. Results: delivery route of enteral nutrition was: percutaneous transperitoneal jejunostomy in 25 (25 %), percutaneous transperitoneal gastrojejunostomy in 32 (32 %) and nasojejunal in 43 (43 %). The incidence of catheter-related complications was higher in percutaneous techniques: 24 % in percutaneous transperitoneal jejunostomy and 34 % in percutaneous transperitoneal gastrojejunostomy as compared to nasojejunal technique (12 %). Median time to complete establishment of oral intake was 14, 14 and 10 days in percutaneous transperitoneal jejunostomy, percutaneous transperitoneal gastrojejunostomy, and nasojejunal groups, respectively. Nasojejunal tubes were removed at median 11 days (mean 11. 5 days) compared to 5 - 6 weeks <b>for</b> percutaneous <b>transperitoneal</b> jejunostomy and percutaneous transperitoneal gastrojejunostomy. Commonest catheter-related complication in the percutaneous transperitoneal jejunostomy and percutaneous transperitoneal gastrojejunostomy was blockage (n= 6; 10. 5 %), followed by pain after removal of feeding tube at 5 - 6 weeks (n= 5; 8. 8 %), whereas in the nasojejunal group it was blockage (n= 3; 7. 0 %), followed by displacement (n= 2; 4. 7 %). Two patients died postoperatively in this cohort, however, there were no catheter-related mortalities. Conclusion: enteral nutrition following pancreatic resection can be delivered in different ways. Nasojejunal feeding was associated with fewest and less serious complications. On current evidence surgeon preference is a reasonable way to decide enteral nutrition but a randomized controlled trial is needed to address this issu...|$|R
40|$|Mass {{transfer}} of calcium across the peritoneum at three different peritoneal dialysis fluid Ca 2 + and glucose concentrations. BackgroundIn peritoneal dialysis, {{the rate of}} ultrafiltration has been predicted {{to be a major}} determinant of peritoneal calcium (Ca 2 +) removal. Hence, dialysis fluid glucose concentration should be an important factor governing the transperitoneal Ca 2 + balance. The aim {{of this study was to}} test the effect of various dialysate glucose levels and selected dialysate Ca 2 + levels on Ca 2 + removal in peritoneal dialysis patients. MethodsPatients (N = 8) received, during a 7 -week period, 2 L of lactate (30 mmol/L) /bicarbonate (10 mmol/L) –buffered peritoneal dialysis solutions containing either 1. 5 % glucose and 1. 0 mmol/L Ca 2 + or 2. 5 % glucose and 1. 6 mmol/L Ca 2 +, or 4 % glucose and 2. 5 mmol/L Ca 2 +, respectively, provided in a three-compartment bag (trio system). Patients underwent standardized (4 -hour) dwells, one for each of the three dialysates to assess permeability-surface area product (PS) or mass transfer area coefficients (MTAC) for ionized and “freely diffusible” Ca 2 +, lactate, glucose, bicarbonate, phosphate, creatinine, and urea. ResultsThere was a clear-cut dependence of peritoneal Ca 2 + removal on the rate of ultrafiltration. For large peritoneal to dialysate Ca 2 + gradients (2. 5 mmol/L Ca 2 + in 4 % glucose) a close fit of measured to simulated data was predicted by the three-pore model using nonelectrolyte equations. <b>For</b> low <b>transperitoneal</b> Ca 2 + concentration gradients, however, directly measured Ca 2 + data agreed with the simulated ones only when the peritoneal Ca 2 + PS was set lower than predicted from pore theory (6 mL/min). ConclusionThere was a marked ultrafiltration dependence of transperitoneal Ca 2 + transport. Nonelectrolyte equations could be used to simulate peritoneal ion (Ca 2 +) transport provided that the transperitoneal ion concentration gradients were large. Based on our data 1. 38 mmol/L Ca 2 + in the dialysis fluid would have created zero net Ca 2 + gain during a 4 -hour dwell for 1. 5 % glucose, whereas 1. 7 and 2. 2 mmol/L Ca 2 + would have been needed to produce zero Ca 2 + gain for 2. 5 % glucose and 3. 9 % glucose, respectively...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{present study}} shows and {{discusses}} the preliminary experience of customized and staged {{approach in the}} minimally invasive treatment of inflammatory renal diseases, using either pure laparoscopic surgery or the hand-assisted technique. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively assessed 17 patients with inflammatory renal diseases operated by laparoscopic approach. Mean age was 41 years and the surgical indication was repeated pyelonephritis in 8 cases, pyonephrosis in 4 cases and renal exclusion due to staghorn stone in 5 cases. The staged laparoscopic approach was chosen based on kidney size and on the presence or not of tomographic findings showing significant perirenal infiltration. Thus, retroperitoneal access was chosen {{in cases where the}} kidney was smaller than 12 cm or in the absence of signs of significant perirenal infiltration on the computerized tomography. <b>For</b> the remainder, <b>transperitoneal</b> access was employed. RESULTS: Of the 17 patients, 11 underwent laparoscopic nephrectomy by retroperitoneal access, and all cases were successful. Mean surgical time was 160 minutes. In 6 cases where the nephrectomy was performed by laparoscopic transperitoneal access, the use of hand assistance was required. Four surgeries were successfully completed with mean time of 190 minutes and 2 were converted to open surgery with mean time of 220 minutes. CONCLUSION: The laparoscopic nephrectomy for inflammatory renal disease is feasible, but presents a high degree of complexity, requiring a customized approach. The use of hand assistance is an attractive option when the inflammatory process is intense, and can avoid conversions, maintaining the advantages of minimally invasive treatments...|$|R
40|$|Rationale: Laparoscopic {{nephrectomy}} {{tends to}} become the new gold standard surgical technique in a selected population (non-functioning kidney, localised renal cell carcinoma). Day surgery is a popular pathway of care and, procedures of ever-increasing complexity are being considered. Objective: The aim {{of the study was}} to report the postoperative complications of day case laparoscopic nephrectomy, according to the Clavien system, and, to assess the feasibility of the procedure performed as a day case. Material and Results: This study included all the patients considered <b>for</b> day case <b>transperitoneal</b> laparoscopic nephrectomy between May 2008 and November 2009. Sixteen consecutive patients were enrolled in this retrospective study. There were ten procedures on the left hand-side and six on the right hand-side. Age ranges from 22 to 77 years old. Male to female ratio was 9 : 7. The preoperative diagnosis was non-functioning kidney in 9 cases and kidney tumour in the other 7 cases. All but two patients have been discharged in the same day (87. 5 %). The readmission rate was of 12. 5 %. One wheel-chair bonded patient was readmitted four days after the procedure, because of adynamic ileus, and another one three days later because of wound infection. There were two grade I and one grade IV complications (Clavien system). The patient readmitted with grade IV complication, wheelchair bonded because of cerebral palsy, was not a typical day surgery patient. Discussion: The vast majority of complications were minor and resulted in no residual disability. In our small series, the day case laparoscopic nephrectomy was feasible and safe...|$|R
