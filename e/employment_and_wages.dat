40|$|This paper uses a {{firm level}} multi-industry data set {{covering}} 456 Chinese manufacturing sectors {{to assess the}} implications of Renminbi (RMB) real exchange rate appreciation for adjustments in <b>employment</b> <b>and</b> <b>wage</b> rates. We stress differences in both industry and firm characteristics within sectors. Our empirical results show that modest (and also larger) RMB real exchange rate appreciation would likely have pronounced effects on both net <b>employment</b> <b>and</b> <b>wage</b> rates. A 10 % RMB appreciation would likely cause a net employment decline in Chinese manufacturing industries of between 4. 1 % and 5. 3 %, <b>and</b> a <b>wage</b> rate drop of 4 % after controlling for other factors. Real exchange rate change effects by industry on net <b>employment</b> <b>and</b> <b>wage</b> rates vary significantly with the ownership characteristics of firms within industries. <b>Employment</b> <b>and</b> <b>wage</b> rates for private enterprises are less responsive to RMB real exchange rate fluctuations than is true for state owned enterprises (SOEs) and foreign invested enterprises (FIEs). This finding is opposite to the widely held belief that the labor market behavior of Chinese SOEs shows stronger labor market rigidities than for private firms. Impacts of exchange rate movements emerge as systematically related to export openness, overall import penetration and profit margins of individual manufacturing industries. ...|$|R

The book was published {{in the midst of the}} 1896 presidential election pitting populist [...] "silver" [...] candidate William Jennings Bryan against the capitalist [...] "gold" [...] candidate William McKinley and the competing interpretations of the nation's leading economist's stance on the issue became a political football during the campaign. The presidential candidate and economist were not close allies as Walker advocated a double standard by all leading financial nations while Bryan argued for the United States' unilateral shift to a silver standard. The rift was heightened by the east-west divide on the issue as well as Walker's general distaste for political populism; Walker's position was supported by conservative bankers and statesmen like Henry Lee Higginson, George F. Hoar, John M. Forbes, and Henry Cabot Lodge.|$|E
500|$|Reagan's {{policies}} {{proposed that}} economic growth would occur when marginal tax rates were {{low enough to}} spur investment, which would then lead to higher <b>employment</b> <b>and</b> <b>wages.</b> Critics labeled this [...] "trickle-down economics"—the belief that tax policies that benefit the wealthy will create a [...] "trickle-down" [...] effect to the poor. Questions arose whether Reagan's policies benefited the wealthy more than those living in poverty, and many poor and minority citizens viewed Reagan as indifferent to their struggles. These views were exacerbated {{by the fact that}} Reagan's economic regimen included freezing the minimum wage at $3.35 an hour, slashing federal assistance to local governments by 60%, cutting the budget for public housing and Section 8 rent subsidies in half, and eliminating the antipoverty Community Development Block Grant program. The widening gap between the rich and poor had already begun during the 1970s before Reagan's economic policies took effect. Along with Reagan's 1981 cut in the top regular tax rate on unearned income, he reduced the maximum capital gains rate to 20%. Reagan later set tax rates on capital gains at the same level as the rates on ordinary income like salaries and wages, with both topping out at 28%. Reagan is viewed as an antitax hero despite raising taxes eleven times {{over the course of his}} presidency, all in the name of fiscal responsibility. According to Paul Krugman, [...] "Over all, the 1982 tax increase undid about a third of the 1981 cut; as a share of GDP, the increase was substantially larger than Mr.Clinton's 1993 tax increase." [...] According to historian and domestic policy adviser Bruce Bartlett, Reagan's tax increases over the course of his presidency took back half of the 1981 tax cut.|$|E

2500|$|... 1835 was an {{important}} year for American labor with many workers particularly in [...] Boston, Philadelphia, New York City and Washington DC petitioning for higher wages, better working conditions [...] and a ten hour work day. In Washington D.C. from early {{in the nineteenth century}} many workers agitated for a reduction in the arduous twelve hour workday. [...] At the navy yard employment conditions, and enslaved labor created problems and strife. For the first thirty years of the nineteen century, the navy yard was the Districts principal employer of enslaved African Americans. White workers fearing job competition and a reduction in wages resented the presence of blacks on the navy yard. On the Yard enslaved African Americans worked as seamen, cooks, servants or laborers; they performed many of the most unpleasant and onerous jobs. The number of blacks free and enslaved rose rapidly and by 1808, muster lists reflect they made up one third of the workforce. On the navy yard slaveholders included both naval officers and senior civilians who collected the wages of their slaves, rented to the navy yard. [...] Labor trouble and racial tension broke out periodically as the restive and volatile workforce sought higher wages and better conditions. Most all naval shipyard workers were per diem or day labor. As such they were subject to the whims of the annual Congressional appropriation and periodic seasonal reductions [...] in the workforce. Workers during the early nineteenth century lived in a state of constant anxiety regarding <b>employment</b> <b>and</b> <b>wages.</b> Wages were subject to considerable change, in some cases daily pay fluctuated dramatically, e.g. WNY carpenters wages were reduced from a high of $2.50 per day in the year 1808 to $1.64 per day in 1820. [...] Workers actively responded, as early as March 1807; the blacksmiths writing to the Secretary of the Navy, Robert Smith claimed the “right to Demand an Equal Participation with others in the Benefit of our Labour” and their wages restored. The Secretary in response labeled them “a dissatisfied set of men” and threatened to “dismiss all complaining men as soon as publick convenience will permit…” and replace them with a “set of orderly, hard working fellows…” [...] Two Washington Navy Yard “job actions” had occurred previously. [...] The first on 13 March 1827, when a dispute over wages provoked laborers to leave the yard briefly to express their displeasure. The second began on 23 March 1830, when the laborers were recorded “standing out” for a week to show that their per diem wage rate should have been granted sooner. Except for the brief entries made by the officer of the watch however in the station log, {{little is known about the}} exact circumstances of either incident. These job actions represent a period when federal workers, though not unionized [...] could strike - an option later denied to government [...] employees with the passage of the 1947 Taft–Hartley Act. The workday in the all federal navy yards prior to 1835 was sunrise to sunset, with time off for breakfast and lunch. In May 1835, the Boston carpenters issued their famous “Ten Hour Circular,” advocating a ten hour day which found wide distribution throughout the major cities on the eastern seaboard and the District of Columbia and quickly became a rallying cry for reducing the length of the working day. Early in 1835, the mechanics in the New York Navy Yard petitioned the Board of Navy Commissioners to reduce the workday to ten hours, but their petition was returned to them with the advice, [...] " [...] that to grant it would not be in the interest of the government." ...|$|E

40|$|PRELIMINARY: PLEASE DO NOT CITE WITHOUT PERMISSION) This paper {{estimates}} {{how much}} of the post-World War II evolution in <b>employment</b> <b>and</b> average <b>wages</b> by gender can be explained by a model where changing labor demand requirements are the driving force. I argue that a large fraction of the original female <b>employment</b> <b>and</b> <b>wage</b> gaps in mid-century, and the subsequent shrinking of both gaps, can be explained by labor reallocation from brawn-intensive to brain-intensive jobs favoring women's comparative advantage in brain over brawn. Thus, aggregate gender-speci c <b>employment</b> <b>and</b> <b>wage</b> gap trends resulting from this labor reallocation are simulated in a general equilibrium model. This shift in production is able to explain: (1) about 79 percent of the rise in female labor force participation, (2) approximately 37 percent of the stagnation in the average female to male wage ratio from 1960 to 1980, and (3) about 83 percent of the closing wage gap between 1980 and 2005. In contrast, a counterfactual experiment, where agents cannot increase their innate brain abilities through education, fails to match the shape of the wage gap over time, resulting in a stagnant simulated wage gap from the 1960 s onward...|$|R

We find that among Ohio's manufacturing establishments female <b>employment</b> <b>and</b> real <b>wages</b> were rising throughout this period, particularly within clerical occupations. Increases in women's share of the total manufacturing workforce were nearly monotonic between 1914 - 1937, while after having been, at best, stagnant until the mid- 1920 s, women's relative wages increased through {{the last half of}} the 1920 s and into the 1930 s. After matching our <b>employment</b> <b>and</b> <b>wage</b> data with information from the Census of Manufactures for the state of Ohio, we estimate translog production functions which indicate that Ohio manufacturers were adopting new organizational structures and technologies that were biased in favor of female clerical labor. This non-neutrality in technological and organizational change (like the <b>employment</b> <b>and</b> <b>wage</b> patterns) was driven primarily by larger firms that had relatively complex production processes. A simple counterfactual exercise indicates that the adoption of non-neutral technological and organizational change over this period can explain much of the observed increase in demand and remuneration for educated female manufacturing workers. This conclusion emphasizes the role women played channeling early twentieth century organizational and technological change, in effect enabling Chandler's "visible hand".
