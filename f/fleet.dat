5|$|According to the Athenian playwright Aeschylus, who {{actually}} fought at Salamis, the Greek <b>fleet</b> numbered 310 triremes (the difference being {{the number of}} Athenian ships). Ctesias claims that the Athenian <b>fleet</b> numbered only 110 triremes, which ties in with Aeschylus's numbers. According to Hyperides, the Greek <b>fleet</b> numbered only 220. The <b>fleet</b> was effectively {{under the command of}} Themistocles, but nominally led by the Spartan nobleman Eurybiades, as had been agreed at the congress in 481 BC. Although Themistocles had tried to claim leadership of the <b>fleet,</b> the other city states with navies objected, and so Sparta (which had no naval tradition) was given command of the <b>fleet</b> as a compromise.|$|E
5|$|Another {{round of}} gunnery drills {{followed}} on 1013 January 1915 {{west of the}} Orkneys and Shetlands, {{this time with the}} entire <b>fleet.</b> On the evening of 23 January, the bulk of the Grand <b>Fleet</b> sailed in support of Vice Admiral David Beatty's Battlecruiser <b>Fleet,</b> but the main <b>fleet</b> did not become engaged in the Battle of Dogger Bank that took place the following day. On 710 March, the Grand <b>Fleet</b> conducted a sweep in the northern North Sea, during which it conducted training manoeuvres. Another such cruise took place on 1619 March. On 11 April, the Grand <b>Fleet</b> conducted a patrol in the central North Sea and returned to port on 14 April; another patrol in the area took place on 1719 April, followed by gunnery drills off the Shetlands on 2021 April. The Grand <b>Fleet</b> conducted a sweep into the central North Sea on 1719 May without encountering any German vessels. In mid-June, the <b>fleet</b> conducted another round of gunnery training. On 25 September, the <b>fleet</b> went on another cruise in the northern end of the North Sea and conducted gunnery drills. Throughout the rest of the month, the Grand <b>Fleet</b> conducted numerous training exercises. On 13 October the majority of the <b>fleet</b> conducted another sweep into the North Sea, returning to port on the 15th. On 25 November, Benbow participated in another <b>fleet</b> training operation west of the Orkneys. Another such cruise took place on 14 December.|$|E
5|$|Benbow was {{occupied}} with the typical routine of gunnery drills and squadron exercises in January. The <b>fleet</b> departed for a cruise in the North Sea on 26 February; Admiral John Jellicoe, {{the commander of}} the Grand <b>Fleet,</b> had intended to use the Harwich Force to sweep the Heligoland Bight, but bad weather prevented operations in the southern North Sea. As a result, the operation was confined to the northern end of the sea. On the night of 25 March, Benbow {{and the rest of the}} <b>fleet</b> sailed from Scapa Flow to support the Battlecruiser <b>Fleet</b> and other light forces that raided the German zeppelin base at Tondern. By the time the Grand <b>Fleet</b> approached the area on 26 March, the British and German forces had already disengaged and a severe gale threatened the light craft. Iron Duke, the <b>fleet</b> flagship, guided the destroyers back to Scapa while Benbow and the rest of the <b>fleet</b> retired independently. On 21 April, the Grand <b>Fleet</b> conducted a demonstration off Horns Reef to distract the Germans while the Russian Navy relaid its defensive minefields in the Baltic Sea. The <b>fleet</b> returned to Scapa Flow on 24 April and refuelled before proceeding south in response to intelligence reports that the Germans were about to launch a raid on Lowestoft. The Grand <b>Fleet</b> did not arrive in the area until after the German High Seas <b>Fleet</b> had withdrawn, however. On 24 May, the <b>fleet</b> conducted another demonstration off Horns Reef to keep German attention focused on the North Sea.|$|E

40|$|Research PaperThe {{objective}} of the paper is to briefly present a comparative analysis of trends in the characteristics of selected European <b>fleets,</b> observed over the last fifteen years, as an introduction to three empirical studies of the behavioural determinants of these trends. The analysis presented aims at (i) describing changes observed in the characteristics and production of the selected fleets; and (ii) gaining some insights as to the factors driving these changes. <b>Fleets</b> {{included in the analysis}} are the Galician <b>fleets</b> operating in the Celtic Sea, the Basque trawler <b>fleets,</b> the South-Brittany trawler <b>fleets,</b> the UK North-Sea beam trawler <b>fleets,</b> and the Dutch large cutter and Eurocutter <b>fleets.</b> Results show that despite their diversity in terms of size, technical characteristics, and production, most of these <b>fleets</b> have been decreasing in size, with an associated stagnation or decrease in total landed value. In most of the <b>fleets,</b> there has been a tendency for the average power and tonnage of vessels to at least be maintained, and often to increase.

5|$|By {{the end of}} March 1942, the Eastern <b>Fleet</b> {{had been}} formed, {{under the command of}} Admiral James Somerville. The <b>fleet</b> was centred on a pair of <b>fleet</b> {{aircraft}} carriers, the elderly carrier , and five battleships, four of which were Royal Sovereign and her sisters; the fifth was Warspite. The <b>fleet</b> also included seven cruisers and sixteen destroyers. Despite the numerical strength of the Eastern <b>Fleet,</b> many of its units, including the four Revenge-class battleships, were no longer front-line warships. Vice Admiral Chūichi Nagumo's powerful Kido Butai, composed of six carriers and four fast battleships, was significantly stronger than Somerville's Eastern <b>Fleet.</b> As a result, only the modernised Warspite could operate with the two <b>fleet</b> carriers; Royal Sovereign, her three sisters, and Hermes were kept away from combat to escort convoys in the Indian Ocean.|$|E
