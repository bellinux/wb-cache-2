500|$|Sports {{gambling}} expert R. J. Bell, {{president of}} sports betting <b>information</b> <b>site</b> Pregame.com, tracked every game Donaghy worked from 2003 to 2007. [...] He discovered {{that during the}} two seasons investigated by the NBA, the teams involved scored more points than expected by the Las Vegas sports books 57 percent of the time. In the previous two seasons, this only happened 44 percent of the time. According to Bell, the odds of such a discrepancy are 1 in 1,000, and there was [...] "a 99.9 percent chance that these results {{would not have happened}} without an outside factor." [...] He also found 10 straight games in 2007 in which Donaghy worked the game that the point spread moved 1.5 points or more before the tip— an indication that big money had been wagered on the game. The big money won every time—another indication that [...] "something (was) going on". [...] However, Bell suggested {{that there was no way}} anyone who wasn't in on the fix could have known that something was amiss about Donaghy's actions during a game; he said it would have been another year at the earliest before anyone could have caught on.|$|E
500|$|M.I.A. {{has been}} a {{supporter}} of WikiLeaks and Julian Assange. In her own book, M.I.A. wrote regarding Wikileaks, [...] "So obviously I love Wikileaks because, after I’d gone through the whole backlash, {{they were the first}} news <b>information</b> <b>site</b> to confirm any news on the Sri Lankan war in the truest form; they were the first to release information stating the truth about {{what had happened to the}} Tamils as I knew it and to reveal that the United Nations was aware that the Sri Lankan government was lying—war crimes had been committed but their hands were tied because any time anyone tried to impose sanctions, governments would walk out. [...] I support Wikileaks because of that." [...] She composed the theme to Assange's television show The World Tomorrow and later stood by Assange's side as he held a press conference at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London where Assange was successfully granted political asylum by Ecuador in August 2012. [...] "I ask President Obama to do the right thing. The United States must renounce its witch hunt against WikiLeaks," [...] Assange said at the press conference. She posted a photo of Assange from within the embassy, and later tweeted, [...] "hummmm after this day 2things have 2 happen....., either 500 cops turn up outside every rape case reported even if it's without charge. or we get raped by the powerz that be and we deal 4eva." [...] The tweets were in reference to an arrest warrant the Swedish Prosecutor's Office issued in August 2010 for Assange on two charges: rape and molestation. Earlier in 2012 Britain's Supreme Court denied an appeal by Assange to avoid extradition to Sweden to face these charges. In November 2013, Assange appeared via Skype to open M.I.A.'s New York City concert. Also, on 18 September 2014 Maya tweeted a link to a documentary on YouTube entitled [...] "The Internet's Own Boy: Aaron Swartz". The documentary is about the life of Aaron Swartz, who was a computer programmer, writer, political organiser and Internet hacktivist. In the same tweet Maya included a link and invitation to RSVP to a party to launch Julian Assange's new book [...] "When Google Met WikiLeaks".|$|E

40|$|In many protein-protein docking algorithms, binding <b>site</b> <b>information</b> {{is used to}} help {{predicting}} the protein complex structures. Using correct and accurate binding <b>site</b> <b>information</b> can increase protein-protein docking success rate significantly. On the other hand, using wrong binding <b>sites</b> <b>information</b> should lead to a failed prediction, or, at least decrease the success rate. Recently, various successful theoretical methods have been proposed to predict the binding sites of proteins. However, the predicted binding <b>site</b> <b>information</b> is not always reliable, sometimes wrong binding <b>site</b> <b>information</b> could be given. Hence {{there is a high}} risk to use the predicted binding <b>site</b> <b>information</b> in current docking algorithms. In this paper, a softly restricting method (SRM) is developed to solve this problem. By utilizing predicted binding <b>site</b> <b>information</b> in a proper way, the SRM algorithm is sensitive to the correct binding <b>site</b> <b>information</b> but insensitive to wrong information, which decreases the risk of using predicted binding <b>site</b> <b>information.</b> This SRM is tested on benchmark 3. 0 using purely predicted binding <b>site</b> <b>information.</b> The result shows that when the predicted information is correct, SRM increases the success rate significantly; however, even if the predicted information is completely wrong, SRM only decreases success rate slightly, which indicates that the SRM is suitable for utilizing predicted binding <b>site</b> <b>information...</b>|$|R

We refer to these kinds of online media which help software engineers improve their performance in software development, maintenance and test processes as software <b>information</b> <b>sites.</b> It is common to see tags in software <b>information</b> <b>sites</b> and many sites allow users to tag various objects with their own words. Users increasingly use tags to describe the most important features of their posted contents or projects. In this paper, we propose TagCombine, an automatic tag recommendation method which analyzes objects in software <b>information</b> <b>sites.</b> TagCombine has 3 different components: 1. multi-label ranking component which considers tag recommendation as a multi-label learning problem; 2. similarity based ranking component which recommends tags from similar objects; 3. tag-term based ranking component which considers the relationship between different terms and tags, and recommends tags after analyzing the terms in the objects. We evaluate TagCombine on 2 software <b>information</b> <b>sites,</b> StackOverflow and Freecode, which contain 47, 668 and 39, 231 text documents, respectively, and 437 and 243 tags, respectively. Experiment results show that for StackOverflow, our TagCombine achieves recall@ 5 and recall@ 10 scores of 0. 5964 and 0. 7239, respectively; For Freecode, it achieves recall@ 5 and recall@ 10 scores of 0. 6391 and 0. 7773, respectively.
