40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the impact of}} regulatory policy on levels of <b>infrastructure</b> <b>deployment</b> and derived welfare in the telecommunications sector. The model considers two potentially coexisting and partially competing techniques (the old ADSL - Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line - technique) - and the new FTTH - Fibre To The Home - one). Competition {{is supposed to be}} high on the ADSL market because of already existing regulation. We assume that two types of operators are competing in order to provide FTTH services: those that build and operate the new infrastructures (OPf 1) and those that just buy access to them (OPf 2). In our model, the level of investment is decided at stage 1 and the access price is decided at stage 2. At stage 3, OPf 1 and OPf 2 compete 0 la Cournot. This common framework allows us to show that the regulation defining access price in order to maximise <b>infrastructure</b> <b>deployment</b> is strictly equivalent to the case in which no regulation applies. We also derive from the model that these two types of regulation induce higher social welfare, but lower numbers of FTTH consumers than cost-oriented access regulation. Finally, we show that the level of <b>infrastructure</b> <b>deployment</b> (as well as social welfare and number of FTTH consumers) will be at its highest if both investment and access price decisions are taken by the regulator. This suggests that the social optimum will be achieved through a call-for-tender process including deployment and access prices requirements...|$|R

40|$|In {{this article}} we {{examine the effects of}} {{interest}} group pressure and the structure of political institutions on <b>infrastructure</b> <b>deployment</b> by state-owned electric utilities in a panel of seventy-eight countries during the period 1970 – 94. We consider two factors that jointly influence the rate of infrastructure deployment: (1) {{the extent to which the}} consumer base consists of industrial consumers, which are capable of exerting discipline on political actors whose competing incentives are to construct economically inefficient “white elephants” to satisfy the demands of concentrated geographic interests, labor unions, and national engineering and construction lobbies; and (2) veto points in formal policymaking structures that constrain political actors, thereby reducing these actors 2 ̆ 7 sensitivity to interest group demands. A higher fraction of industrial customers provides political actors with stronger incentives for discipline, reducing the deployment of white elephants and thus the infrastructure growth rate, ceteris paribus. Veto points reduce political actors 2 ̆ 7 sensitivity to interest group demands in general and thus moderate the relationship between industrial interest group pressure and the rate of <b>infrastructure</b> <b>deployment...</b>|$|R
40|$|Telecommunications is {{increasingly}} {{vital to the}} society at large, and has become essential to business, academic, {{as well as social}} activities. Due to the necessity to have access to telecommunications, the deployment requires regulations and policy. Otherwise, the <b>deployment</b> of the <b>infrastructures</b> would contribute to environment, and human complexities rather than ease of use. However, the formulation of telecommunication <b>infrastructure</b> <b>deployment</b> regulation and policy involve agents such as people and processes. The roles of the agents are critical, and are not as easy as it meant to belief. This could be attributed to different factors, as they produce and reproduce themselves overtime.

In the study, the interactions that take place amongst human and non-human agents were investigated.
