5|$|Kenneth Herbert Barnes (16 March 1929 – 13 July 2010) was an English {{football}}er. He {{played as}} a <b>half</b> <b>back</b> for Manchester City and Wrexham. On {{the books of}} Birmingham City as a youth, Barnes began his football career at amateur level. Upon completion of his national service in 1947 he joined semi-pro Stafford Rangers.|$|E
5|$|On February 11, Shackleford was seventh {{out of a}} {{field of}} eleven horses in the Grade 1 Donn Handicap run at Gulfstream Park. Ruler on Ice also ran and {{finished}} eighth. On April 7, 2012, Shackleford ran in the $400,000 Grade 1 Carter Handicap at seven furlongs at Aqueduct Racetrack. Longshot Jackson Bend won by a nose over Caleb's Posse, with Shackleford another length and a <b>half</b> <b>back</b> in third.|$|E
5|$|The team {{picked up}} their first single-day win {{the same day}} as the more prestigious Tour of Flanders, in which they participated but were not {{especially}} competitive, with Duque in 19th their best finisher. The race they won was the inaugural Flèche d'Emeraude, a new race in the UCI Europe Tour and the French Road Cycling Cup. Gallopin came first {{at the head of a}} field sprint in Saint-Malo. Zingle figured into a winning breakaway at the Brabantse Pijl, the precursor to the Ardennes classics. He took seventh place, a minute and a <b>half</b> <b>back</b> of the winner Philippe Gilbert. Vogondy was sixth at the Tour du Finistère, finishing with a big main group behind two leaders.|$|E
25|$|The {{role of the}} <b>half</b> <b>backs</b> {{who wear}} the 5 (right) and 7 (left) jerseys is less {{defensive}} {{than that of the}} corner <b>backs.</b> The <b>half</b> <b>backs</b> operate most often in between the 45-metre line and the midfield. The <b>half</b> <b>backs</b> are expected to defend against the opposition's half forward line but also has a responsibility to make runs from the 45-metre line to advance the play to the half forward and full forward lines.|$|R
50|$|Margrave also captained {{his club}} and was {{described}} {{as one of the}} most gentlemanly <b>half</b> <b>backs</b> to represent the first team.|$|R
50|$|Barnsley did {{not play}} an {{exciting}} game of football; relying on their <b>half</b> <b>backs</b> to run alongside the WBA forwards making the WBA game of pass and return between their forwards and <b>half</b> <b>backs</b> too dangerous. Barnsley then tried to score on the break. But the WBA backs, led by Pennington, were able to contain the threat. This led to a stalemate, with WBA unable to play their normal game and Barnsley unable to push their advantage.|$|R
5|$|Tarr was {{selected}} to play Wales the following week in Cardiff. Although England played better than expected, Wales were favourites to win and beat the visitors 8–0. Two weeks later, on 30 January, England played France with a <b>half</b> <b>back</b> combination of Frank Hutchinson, earning his first cap, and Williamson; Poulton making his debut at centre alongside Tarr; and Mobbs and Tom Simpson on the wings. France was not yet part {{of what was to}} become the Five Nations tournament (now the Six Nations) and was a relatively easy side to play. England won the game comfortably 22–0, with Tarr scoring two tries, one through good interplay with Mobbs and the other, a fine individual run. Despite the tries, Tarr was dropped from the England squad.|$|E
5|$|Harley {{endured a}} {{difficult}} start {{to his first}} season as captain, as he ruptured a finger tendon during the club's round one loss to the Western Bulldogs. After undergoing surgery on his finger, Harley made his return through the club's reserves team in the VFL but failed to earn a recall to the senior team until round ten. After playing {{the majority of his}} career at Geelong as a centre <b>half</b> <b>back,</b> Harley struggled to find his niche in the defence following the emergence of the younger Matthew Egan in the key position. He soon adjusted himself as a floating defender capable of playing on small forwards, and retained his position in the side after achieving career-best averages of 14 disposals and 5 marks a game. Harley helped the team compile an 18-4 win-loss record {{at the conclusion of the}} home and away season, earning them their eighth McClelland Trophy and securing first position on the ladder leading into the finals series. Harley led the defence to the number one defensive record in the league during the season, by letting only 1664 points be scored against them. After wins against North Melbourne and Collingwood in the Qualifying and Preliminary finals respectively, Geelong earned a spot in the Grand Final against Harley's former team Port Adelaide. Collecting 13 disposals and 7 marks, Harley helped the club to an AFL-record 119 point win and secure its first premiership in 44 years. Harley became the first Geelong captain of a premiership-winning side since Fred Wooller in 1963, and achieved the rare distinction of becoming a premiership-winning captain in his first year at the helm.|$|E
25|$|The role of {{the centre}} <b>half</b> <b>back</b> who wears the number 6 jersey, is less {{defensive}} {{than that of the}} full back. The centre backs operates from the 45-metre line and forward to the midfield. The centre back will help win the breaking ball in the midfield and {{can be used as a}} third midfielder. The centre <b>half</b> <b>back</b> generally marks the centre half forward.|$|E
5000|$|About {{one-quarter of}} the crab's weight is meat. The flesh has what is {{considered}} to be a delicate flavour and slightly sweet taste. Dungeness crabs can typically be purchased either live or cooked. Live crabs are cooked simply by dropping them into boiling salt water, waiting for a boil to return, and then allowing it to continue for 15 minutes, after which time the crabs are removed and placed into cold water to cool, and then cleaned. Another method of preparing crab is called <b>half</b> <b>backing.</b> <b>Half</b> <b>backing</b> is done by flipping the crab upside down and chopping it in half (from head to [...] "tail"), after which the guts and gills can be scooped or hosed out. Many consider <b>half</b> <b>backing</b> to be superior to cooking the entire crab, because the meat is not contaminated by the flavor or toxins of the guts. Furthermore, <b>half</b> <b>backed</b> crabs boil faster or can be quickly steamed instead of boiled. Two common tools for removing crab meat from the shell are a crab cracker and a shrimp fork. Sometimes, a cleaver, mallet, or small hammer is used for cracking Dungeness crab, but the use of these devices is not recommended, as the integrity of the meat may be compromised due to the impact.|$|R

5|$|The {{match between}} the Sheffield FA and the FA {{that took place}} in December 1871 is notable for {{evidence}} of the development of several new positions. As well as the first mention of forwards, sides (now called wingers) were also mentioned. The rest of the team made up the midfield. The <b>Half</b> <b>backs</b> (referred to as centre backs in the modern game) were mentioned a year later. By the mid-1870s it was common to use one goalkeeper assisted by two cover goals and two <b>half</b> <b>backs.</b> The attack was made up of five midfielders and one forward. This produced the 2–2–5–1 formation.|$|R
25|$|Sometimes {{referred}} to as centre back. The required agilities of a centre <b>half</b> <b>back</b> are strength, height, speed and a good catching game.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} June 2017, CEO Gibson {{left the}} company, and the company laid off all {{remaining}} employees, hiring about <b>half</b> <b>back</b> on a contract basis.|$|E
25|$|Clauss {{played one}} final {{international}} game, {{when he was}} recalled three years later for the second game of the 1895 Championship. Clauss was brought in at the unfamiliar position of <b>half</b> <b>back,</b> after the retirement of William Wotherspoon left a gap that the Scottish selectors had difficulty filling. Although Scotland won the game 6–0, Clauss lost his place to the more experienced <b>half</b> <b>back</b> William Donaldson. Despite this, Scotland won the Championship and Clauss ended his career {{as part of a}} Triple Crown team {{for the second time in}} his career.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: A {{depiction}} of the 2-3-5 formation used by Watford {{for the majority of}} the season. Wingers were then more commonly referred to as outside forwards; the wide and central <b>half</b> <b>backs</b> were known as wing halves and centre halves respectively.|$|R
50|$|Unable {{to oust the}} first-choice <b>half</b> <b>backs</b> of Frank Hill, Herbie Roberts and Bob John, Haynes {{was sold}} to Crystal Palace in November 1933, and played there for three seasons, {{retiring}} in 1936. He died in Oxford in 1953 {{at the age of}} 46.|$|R
50|$|In 1946 he {{returned}} to West Perth and established himself {{as one of the}} best centre <b>half</b> <b>backs</b> in the competition. He was a member of premiership sides in 1949 and again in 1951 when he won another best and fairest as well as a Sandover Medal.|$|R
25|$|He captained {{quite a few}} {{successful}} underage teams {{including the}} Derry minor side that were runners up to Down in the Ulster Championship team in 1986. He played the game at Right <b>half</b> <b>back,</b> despite having a fractured arm.|$|E
25|$|Now {{living in}} Western Australia, Carlson captained Wentworth, a junior club in Fremantle, before joining Easts. He was a wingman in East Fremantle's 1914 premiership team and also played in their 1918 premiership side, as a centre <b>half</b> <b>back.</b>|$|E
25|$|Francis Hornby Birley (14 March 1850 – 1 August 1910) was an English footballer {{who played}} as a <b>half</b> <b>back.</b> He won the FA Cup {{three times in}} the 1870s and made two {{appearances}} for England in 1874 and 1875.|$|E
5000|$|Like the Welsh, the Scots fielded {{six players}} from one club (Queens Park) {{and three of}} their players were making their {{international}} debut: James Lang, Moses McNeil and Robert W. Neill. Both teams played a 2-2-6 formation; i.e. two fullbacks, two <b>half</b> <b>backs</b> and six forwards.|$|R
5000|$|Seamus Leydon is a Gaelic footballer from County Galway. He was a {{vital part}} of Galway’s great [...] "Three In A Row" [...] side of the Mid 60’s. The [...] "Dunmore Dynamo" [...] was the scourge of all right <b>half</b> <b>backs</b> up and down the county for a decade.|$|R
50|$|Hookers have a {{great deal}} of contact with the ball, as they usually play the role of acting halfback or dummy half, picking the ball up from the play-the-ball that follows a tackle. Hookers {{therefore}} have a lot of responsibility in that they then decide what to do with the ball, whether that be to pass it (and to whom), run with it, or occasionally to kick it. Therefore, together with the two <b>half</b> <b>backs</b> and fullback, hooker is one of the four key positions that make up what is sometimes called a team's 'spine'. A trend of scrum <b>half</b> <b>backs</b> converting into hookers followed the introduction of the 10 metre rule, and many players have switched between these positions in their careers such as Geoff Toovey, Andrew Johns, Craig Gower and Peter Wallace.|$|R
25|$|Arthur George Henfrey (19 December 1867 – 17 October 1929) was an English footballer {{who made}} five {{appearances}} for England between 1891 and 1896 playing initially as a forward {{and later as}} a <b>half</b> <b>back.</b> He also played cricket for Cambridge University and Northamptonshire.|$|E

25|$|Kinnear, who {{was used}} by Melbourne mostly as a <b>half</b> <b>back,</b> came to the club from Brunswick in the Victorian Football Association (VFA). He spent six seasons at Melbourne and played his last game in their losing Preliminary Final side of 1937. Kinnear later worked at the Melbourne Cricket Ground as its {{scoreboard}} manager.|$|E

50|$|The Manchester Guardian {{felt the}} best players were the <b>backs</b> and <b>half</b> <b>backs</b> on each side, {{singling}} out Pennington and Buck on the WBA side for praise and Downs along with Glendinning for Barnsley. They also felt that Jephcott, the WBA wing had had a good match, with several good centring passes.|$|R
25|$|Carter, who is of pākehā and Māori descent, {{was born}} in Leeston, a small town 10 minutes drive from the Carter family home in Southbridge in the South Island of New Zealand, to Neville and Bev Carter, and has one older sister, Sarah. From the age of 5, he played with Southbridge Rugby Club as a <b>half</b> <b>back</b> (scrum half) and {{would go on to}} make {{representative}} teams for Ellesmere & Canterbury Country. He attended Ellesmere College where he played mostly at first five-eighth, and then in his final year he transferred to Christchurch Boys High School to further his chances of making it big in rugby. Some have said he was a shy and quiet young man who kept grand aspirations to himself. His great uncle was Canterbury and New Zealand <b>half</b> <b>back</b> Bill Dalley, a member of the 1924–25 Invincibles and later a Canterbury rugby administrator.|$|E
25|$|Australian scrum <b>half</b> <b>back</b> Johnathan Thurston {{was named}} the final's man-of-the-match, his fourth such award of the tournament. His {{conversion}} of Cronk's first half try also broke Mick Cronin's 31-year-old record of 309 Test points for the Kangaroos. The 32-point margin set a new record for heaviest victory in a final, eclipsing Australia’s 40–12 victory over the Kiwis in the same stadium in 2000.|$|E
25|$|Mackay's {{name as a}} club {{mainstay}} at <b>half</b> <b>back</b> {{was eventually}} taken over by Billy Higgins. That League Cup win was also Glidden's last trophy as a recurring back injury that season numbered his playing days at Tynecastle. 36 year old MacKenzie left in 1959 as did Wardhaugh. He scored 206 goals in 304 league games {{and a total of}} 376 goals in 518 games for Hearts.|$|E
