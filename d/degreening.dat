50|$|Citrus sinesis and Chenopodium album {{were the}} first plants from which the genes {{encoding}} chlorophyllase were isolated. These experiments revealed an uncharacteristic encoded sequence (21 amino acids in Citrus sinensis and 30 amino acids in Chenopodium album) located on the N-terminal that was absent from the mature protein. The chlorophyllase enzyme is a smart choice as the rate limiting enzyme of the catabolic pathway since <b>degreening</b> and the expression of chlorophyllase is induced in ethylene-treated Citrus. Recent data, however, suggests that chlorophyllase is expressed at low levels during natural fruit development, when chlorophyll catabolism usually takes place. Also, some data suggests that chlorophyllase activity is not consistent with <b>degreening</b> during natural senescence. Finally, {{there is evidence that}} chlorophyllase has been found in the inner envelope membrane of chloroplast where it does not come in contact with chlorophyll. Recent studies inspired by inconsistent data revealed that chlorophyllase in Citrus lacking the 21 amino sequence on the N-terminal results in extensive chlorophyll breakdown and the <b>degreening</b> effect that should occur in vivo. This cleavage occurs in the chloroplast membrane fraction. Both the full chlorophyllase and the cleaved, mature chlorophyllase, however, experienced similar levels of activity in an in vitro assay. This data suggests that the mature protein comes in contact with its substrate more readily because of the N-terminal sequence and some natural regulation occurs that directly affects enzyme activity. Another possibility is that the suborganelle compartments breaking down allowing a greater amount of enzyme activity.|$|E

40|$|Selecting {{chrysanthemum}} cultivars {{with long}} storability and vase {{life is a}} major challenge for breeders. The rate of <b>degreening</b> of disk florets during the postharvest phase is an important determinant of vase life. There is large genotypic variation in susceptibility to disk floret <b>degreening.</b> Our aim was to understand these genotypic differences at the physiological level. Carbohydrate starvation seemed to play a role, since application of sugars prevented <b>degreening</b> and <b>degreening</b> only occurred if florets had a long-term low carbohydrate content. In order {{to find out which}} metabolic processes could explain genotypic differences, we used 1 H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy profiling, High Performance Anion Exchange Chromatography (HPAEC) and respiration measurements to compare metabolic responses of three genotypes to carbohydrate starvation. HPAEC and NMR measurements showed that carbohydrate content could not fully explain genotypic differences. A genotype with intermediate sensitivity to <b>degreening</b> showed similar carbohydrate content compared to an insensitive one. However, respiration rate declined faster under carbohydrate starvation in a sensitive and intermediate sensitive genotype compared to an insensitive genotype, suggesting a more abrupt constraint on the mitochondrial electron transport chain and with that oxidative stress. Changes in the metabolic profile under carbohydrate starvation were diverse and revealed candidate processes associated with disk floret <b>degreening.</b> Camphor content increased and correlated positively with <b>degreening</b> insensitivity. Phenylpropanoids and flavonoids also increased upon carbohydrate starvation and the response was genotype specific. We propose the upregulation of the phenylpropanoid metabolism as important source of nitrogen in the form of harmful ammonia during carbohydrate starvation. Our results provide a framework to identify processes associated with genotypic differences in the response to carbohydrate starvation and susceptibility to floret <b>degreening.</b> </p...|$|E
40|$|An {{inhibitory}} effect of sucrose laurate ester (SLE) on the <b>degreening</b> of Nagato-yuzukichi (Citrus nagato-yuzukichi hort. ex Y. Tanaka) fruit was determined. SLE treatment suppressed the <b>degreening</b> {{of the fruit}} during storage at 20 °C more efficiently than the treatment with any other sucrose fatty acid ester, such as myristate, palmitate or stearate. SLE itself {{did not have an}} {{inhibitory effect}} on chlorophyllase and chlorophyll (Chl) -degrading peroxidase activities, but laurate, which was de-esterified from SLE, had a significant effect. Laurate inhibited both enzyme activities more effectively than any other fatty acid, such as caprylate, caprate, myristate, palmitate or stearate. The fruit flavedo extract had an activity to decompose SLE to laurate and sucrose, and treatment of the fruit with laurate significantly suppressed <b>degreening</b> during storage at 20 °C as well. These results indicate that the suppression of <b>degreening</b> in SLE-treated Nagato-yuzukichi fruit could be in part due to the formation of laurate from SLE by an esterase, such as a lipase, which is present in the flavedo, and the laurate formed might be involved effectively in the inhibition of Chl-degrading enzyme activities. Moreover, the suppression of <b>degreening</b> by SLE treatment could be due to the inhibition of <b>degreening</b> by laurate in addition to the coating effect of SLE...|$|E

One problem occurring after storage is premature <b>degreening</b> of disk florets. We want to understand the physiological background of disk floret <b>degreening</b> {{in order to allow}} breeding against sensitivity to <b>degreening.</b> Disk floret <b>degreening</b> occurs in two steps: first, there is loss of green colour resulting in yellowing, and after that, disk florets turn brown. Sucrose feeding after storage prevents disk floret <b>degreening.</b> Pulsing flower stems with potassium chloride with the same osmolarity compared to the sucrose treatment did not have an effect on <b>degreening.</b> Therefore, the effect of sucrose {{did not seem to be}} osmotic but related to energy metabolism. Because of this relation with carbohydrate metabolism, we hypothesized that genotypic differences are explained by their carbohydrate content during the postharvest phase. However, the carbohydrate content of a sensitive and insensitive genotype did not explain these genotypic differences. The sensitive genotype showed higher carbohydrate content during the postharvest phase compared to the insensitive genotype. Our results indicate that storage induced disk floret browning is caused by carbohydrate starvation, but genotypic differences are probably explained by a difference in sensitivity to carbohydrate starvation...|$|E

Quiescent mycelia of D. natalensis in necrotic tissue on the surface of the calyx and disk (button) at the stem-end of the fruit grow into the fruit upon separation of the button from the fruit during abscission. Activity of the abscission enzymes in oranges was enhanced by high ethylene (0. 055 ml l 1), and a larger number of cells were degraded within the abscission layer by their activity than at lower (0. 002 ml l 1) more typical <b>degreening</b> concentrations.

40|$|Breeding for postharvest {{performance}} in ornamentals is challenging, since many different deteriorative processes determine vase life. In {{order to improve}} postharvest performance by breeding, selection should take place on these processes separately. To define processes that are important for chrysanthemum postharvest performance, vase life was assessed {{after two weeks of}} cold storage in a set of 44 chrysanthemum cultivars. Since disk floret <b>degreening</b> was the most frequent reason for ending vase life, we further investigated this trait in a large biparental population (n = 381). To quantify disk floret <b>degreening</b> in this large number of genotypes, we developed a high-throughput phenotyping method. The method consists of the quantification of loss of green color as expressed by an increase of intensity of red divided by the intensity of green (R/G) in dark-held detached capitula. R/G increases when disk florets lose green color. The increase in R/G correlated significantly with the number of days until disk floret <b>degreening</b> occurred during vase life. This was the case for the 44 -cultivar cultivar panel (Pearson’s correlation coefficient (ρ) of − 0. 70; p < 0. 0001) as well as in a subset of the biparental pulation (n = 145; ρ = − 0. 67; p < 0. 0001). R/G increase segregated in a quantitative manner in the full biparental population, and had a moderately high heritability of 0. 73. Carbohydrate content after harvest was measured in a smaller subset of the biparental population (n = 55). The R/G increase correlated with carbohydrate content (ρ=- 0. 56; p < 0. 0001). Since carbohydrate content did not explain all variation in <b>degreening</b> sensitivity, we discuss different possible mechanisms to cope with carbohydrate starvation and avoid <b>degreening.</b> In conclusion, disk floret <b>degreening</b> is an important postharvest trait in chrysanthemum, and it is related to carbohydrate starvation. The quantitative segregation suggests involvement of multiple alleles, probably at multiple loci. The moderately high heritability makes it a suitable trait for QTL mapping, which we will commence in the near future...|$|E

In the first experiment, the fruits showed stronger <b>degreening</b> with increasing time of exposure to ethylene, most markedly for 96 h. After this exposure time, the Hue angle increased from 96. 1 o, in the first assessment days, to 82. 3 o, at the end of 96 h, which was lower than values observed in naturally degreened fruits. Fruits exposed for 24 h showed evolution of the yellow peel color similar to the untreated ones. It was observed that fruits left to ripe on the plant showed non-homogeneous peel <b>degreening.</b> The fruits exposed to ethylene for 96 h showed no visual signs of loss of commercial quality, although there was increased solute leakage from the peel during the treatment. Soluble solids content, tritable acidity and SS/TA ratio remained unchanged throughout the assessment period. The synthesis of total carotenoids in the peel was low, from 6. 0 &# 956;g/cm 2, in control fruits at the end of evaluations, to a maximum of 8. 2 &# 956;g/cm 2, in fruits exposed to ethylene for 96 h. This synthesis was insufficient to reach the orange color, therefore, the <b>degreening</b> of fruit peel was due, almost exclusively, to chlorophyll degradation. In the second experiment, the fruits showed yellowing of the peel stronger than fruits of the first experiment. The exposure time of 96 h proved to be the most efficient in promoting the fruit <b>degreening</b> in comparison with other times. Color evolution was quite similar between the control and fruits treated for 24 and 48 h. Fruits of all treatments had very low synthesis of total carotenoids in the peel, changing from 7. 3 &# 956;g/cm 2 in control fruits to 9. 2 &# 956;g/cm 2, maximum value observed in fruits exposed to ethylene for 96 h. Even in fruits showing the strongest yellowing, there was little participation of new synthesized carotenoids in the composition of the final color.

40|$|DNA-informed {{selection}} can strongly {{improve the}} process of plant breeding. It requires the detection of DNA polymorphisms, calculation of genetic linkage, access to reliable phenotypes and methods to detect genetic loci associated with phenotypic traits of interest. Cultivated chrysanthemum is an outcrossing hexaploid with an unknown mode of inheritance. This complicates the development of resources and methods that enable the detection of trait loci. Postharvest performance is an essential trait in chrysanthemum, but is difficult to measure. This makes it an interesting but challenging trait to phenotype and detect associated genetic loci. In this thesis I describe the development of resources and methods to enable phenotyping for postharvest performance, genetic linkage map construction and detection of quantitative trait loci in hexaploid chrysanthemum. Postharvest performance is a complicated trait because it is related to many different disorders that reduce quality. One of these disorders in chrysanthemum is disk floret <b>degreening,</b> which occurs after long storage. In chapter 2, we show that <b>degreening</b> can be prevented by feeding the flower heads with sucrose, suggesting carbohydrate starvation {{plays a role in}} the <b>degreening</b> process. To investigate the response to carbohydrate starvation of genotypes with different sensitivity to disk floret <b>degreening,</b> we investigated the metabolome of sugar-fed and carbohydrate-starved disk florets by 1 H-NMR and HPAEC. We show that the metabolome is severely altered at carbohydrate starvation. In general, starvation results in an upregulation of amino acid and secondary metabolism. Underlying causes of genotypic differences explaining variation in disk floret <b>degreening</b> in the three investigated genotypes remained to be elucidated, but roles of regulation of respiration rate and camphor metabolism were posed as possible candidates. In chapter 3, disk floret <b>degreening</b> was found {{to be the most important}} postharvest disorder after 3 weeks of storage among 44 white chrysanthemum cultivars. To investigate the inheritance of disk floret <b>degreening,</b> we crossed two genotypes with opposite phenotypic values of both disk floret <b>degreening</b> and carbohydrate content to obtain a population segregating for disk floret <b>degreening.</b> To phenotype the cultivar panel and the bi-parental population precisely and in a high throughput manner, we developed a method that quantified colour of detached capitula over time. This method was validated with visual observations of disk floret <b>degreening</b> during vase life tests. In a subset of the bi-parental population we measured carbohydrate content of the disk florets at harvest. The amount of total carbohydrates co-segregated with sensitivity to <b>degreening,</b> which shows that the difference in disk floret <b>degreening</b> sensitivity between the parents could be explained by their difference in carbohydrate content. However, the correlation was rather weak, indicating carbohydrate content is not the only factor playing a role. In order to develop resources for DNA-informed breeding, one needs to be able to characterize DNA polymorphisms. In chapter 4, we describe the development of a genotyping array containing 183, 000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). These SNPs were acquired by sequencing the transcriptome of 13 chrysanthemum cultivars. By comparing the genomic dosage based on the SNP assay and the dosage as estimated by the read depth from the transcriptome sequencing data, we show that alleles are expressed conform the genomic dosage, which contradicts to what is often found in disomic polyploids. In line with this finding, we conclusively show that cultivated chrysanthemum exhibits genome-wide hexasomic inheritance, based on the segregation ratios of large numbers of different types of markers in two different populations. Tools for genetic analysis in diploids are widely available, but these have limited use for polyploids. In chapter 5, we present a modular software package that enables genetic linkage map construction in tetraploids and hexaploids. Because of the modularity, functionality for other ploidy levels can be easily added. The software is written in the programming language R and we named it polymapR. It can generate genetic linkage maps from marker dosage scores in an F 1 population, while taking the following steps: data inspection and filtering, linkage analysis, linkage group assignment and marker ordering. It is the first software package that can handle polysomic hexaploid and partial polysomic tetraploid data, and has advantages over other polyploid mapping software because of its scalability and cross-platform applicability. With the marker dosage scores of the bi-parental F 1 population from the genotyping array and the developed methods to perform linkage analysis we constructed an integrated genetic linkage map for the hexaploid bi-parental population described in chapter 3 and 4. We describe this process in chapter 6. With this integrated linkage map, we reconstructed the inheritance of parental haplotypes for each individual, and expressed this as identity-by-descent (IBD) probabilities. The phenotypic data on disk floret <b>degreening</b> sensitivity that was acquired as described in chapter 3, was used in addition to three other traits to detect quantitative trait loci (QTL). These QTL were detected based on the IBD probabilities of 1 centiMorgan intervals of each parental homologue. This enabled us to study genetic architecture by estimating the effects of each separate allele within a QTL on the trait. We showed that for many QTL the trait was affected by more than two alleles. In chapter 7, the findings in this thesis are discussed in the context of breeding for heterogeneous traits, the implications of the mode of inheritance for breeding and the advantages and disadvantages of polyploidy in crop breeding. In conclusion, this thesis provides in general a significant step for DNA-informed breeding in polysomic hexaploids, and for postharvest performance in chrysanthemum in particular...|$|E

By contrast, some other ripening events, like softening and membrane deterioration, depend only partially on ethylene and display some ethylene-independent components. Application of increasing levels of exogenous ethylene on these antisense 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid oxidase fruits enabled {{the determination of}} the gradual sensitivity of various ripening pathways to the hormone. The threshold level of ethylene capable of physiological activity varied from 1 ppm for <b>degreening</b> of the rind to 2. 5 ppm for softening, membrane deterioration and cell separation in the peduncular abscission zone. Up to a saturating dose of 5 ppm, the extent of rind <b>degreening</b> was proportionally related to the level of applied ethylene. The saturating levels of ethylene for flesh softening (2. 5 ppm) and for membrane deterioration and cell separation in the peduncular abscission zone (5 ppm) were much lower than the internal ethylene found at the climacteric peak of wild-type fruit (over 100 ppm). The cessation of ethylene treatment resulted in a complete arrest of the rind <b>degreening</b> and peduncular cell separation indicating that both ripening pathways are completely dependent on ethylene. On the contrary, softening and membrane deterioration, though significantly slowed upon removal of ethylene treatment, continued to proceed {{in the absence of the}} hormone, thereby unmasking the ethylene-independent component of softening and membrane deterioration.

Ribulose 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase (RuBPCase) levels were high in <b>degreened</b> epicarp and declined for the first 10 days of culture before reaccumulating in the regreening segments. Light was necessary for the accumulation of all of the chloroplastic components. A lack of exogenous nitrogen did not prevent the accumulation of any chloroplastic component except Ru-BPCase, although accumulation of the other components was reduced. Sucrose at 150 millimolar in media lacking nitrogen markedly inhibited the accumulation of chlorophyll and light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-protein...|$|R
40|$|This article {{concerns}} the <b>degreening</b> {{process in the}} marketing of citrus fruit {{which is used to}} bring forward the citrus season, to make fruit more attractive to consumers, and generally to introduce more control of the harvesting and ripening process. However, in the attempt to improve fruit appearance, other quality attributes may be sacrificed. The process is known to be detrimental to external fruit quality and is also suspected to be detrimental to consumption quality and shelf life. In the context of a dynamic and competitive fruit market, any reduction in product quality will have a negative economic impact on both industry and consumers, and on public health objectives. Further technical and marketing research is necessary, but there is sufficient evidence to be cautious about the widespread use of <b>degreening...</b>|$|E
40|$|C 2 H 4 {{disrupts}} the internal membranes of the chloroplast and induces {{an increase in}} chlorophyllase activity in <b>degreening</b> calamondin [x Citrofortunella mitis (Blanco) Ingram and Moore] fruit. Whether the loss of chlorophyll in the peel is causally related to breakdown of the chloroplast and/or chlorophyllase activity is not readily apparent. Chlorophyllase levels {{were inversely related to}} chlorophyll content, but electron micrographs also showed that internal membranes of the chloroplasts were disrupted simultaneously with the decrease in chlorophyll content. Silver, a potent inhibitor of C 2 H 4 -mediated effects, retarded the loss of chlorophyll in calamondin rind, reduced the C 2 H 4 -induced increase in chlorophyllase level, and prevented the disruption of the chloroplast membranes. The results do not permit the proposal of a mechanism of C 2 H 4 metabolism in the <b>degreening</b> of calamondin fruit...|$|E
40|$|<b>Degreening,</b> {{due to the}} {{net loss}} of {{chlorophyll}} (Chl), is the most prominent symptom during the processes of leaf senescence, fruit ripening, and seed maturation. Over {{the last decade or}} so, extensive identifications of Chl catabolic genes (CCGs) have led to the revelation of the biochemical pathway of Chl degradation. As such, exploration of the regulatory mechanism of the <b>degreening</b> process is greatly facilitated. During the past few years, substantial {{progress has been made in}} elucidating the regulation of Chl degradation, particularly via the mediation of major phytohormones' signaling. Intriguingly, ethylene and abscisic acid's signaling have been demonstrated to interweave with light signaling in mediating the regulation of Chl degradation. In this review, we briefly summarize this progress, with an effort on providing a framework for further investigation of multifaceted and hierarchical regulations of Chl degradation...|$|E
