When serving as torpedo boat {{flotilla}} leaders, the ships had an additional 3officers and 16enlisted men. The ships carried several smaller boats, including one picket boat, one yawl, and one <b>dinghy.</b> Later in their careers, a cutter, another yawl, and another <b>dinghy</b> were added.|$|E
5|$|Poole Harbour {{is one of}} {{the largest}} centres for sailing in the UK with yacht clubs {{including}} Lilliput Sailing Club, Parkstone Yacht Club and Poole Yacht Club. Parkstone Yacht Club hosted the OK <b>Dinghy</b> World Championships in 2004, the J/24 National Championships in 2006 and the J/24 European Championships in 2007, and are the organisers of Youth Week and Poole Week â€“ two of the largest annual <b>dinghy</b> regattas of their type in the country.|$|E
50|$|Laser <b>dinghies</b> are cat-rigged, as are Finn <b>dinghies,</b> Optimists, many Freedom Yachts and a {{large number}} of {{traditional}} fishing vessels.|$|R
50|$|There is a {{successful}} Junior Group which trains youngsters to sail and race a range of <b>dinghies</b> including Optimists and Topper <b>dinghies.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Dinghies</b> usually {{range in}} length from about 6 to 20 ft. Larger {{auxiliary}} vessels are generally called tenders, pinnaces or lifeboats. Folding and take-down multi-piece (nesting) <b>dinghies</b> are used where space is limited. Some newer <b>dinghies</b> have much greater buoyancy, giving them more carrying capacity than older boats {{of the same}} size.|$|R
5|$|Some {{restricted}} use for recreational activities is permitted by the owner, Bristol Water, including <b>dinghy</b> sailing and fishing, primarily for trout.|$|E
5|$|Until Spring 2010, Cardiff Sailing Centre {{operated}} at {{the reservoir}} offering <b>dinghy</b> sailing, windsurfing, powerboating and canoeing courses. The centre, {{which is owned}} and managed by Cardiff County Council had been running at the reservoir for 30 years, though had to relocate to Cardiff Bay to continue operating due to the drain-down.|$|E
5|$|Chew Valley Lake Sailing Club has a sailing area, {{approximately}} 1.9miles (3km) long, for <b>dinghy</b> sailing. The lake {{is divided}} into two areas: a restricted summer area which is available during the fishing season (mid-March to mid-October), and the full area which can be used throughout the winter and on Sunday afternoons. The sailing area is marked out by lines of small white buoys. Racing marks are red buoys with flags, although large inflatable marks are used of open events.|$|E
50|$|In some {{countries}} <b>dinghies</b> have names or registration numbers. On hard <b>dinghies</b> these are usually on the bow, on inflatables {{on the inside}} of the transom.|$|R
25|$|High Performance <b>dinghies</b> {{are fast}} and {{powerful}} <b>dinghies</b> designed for racing around an Olympic triangle (Olympic Racing Course). Examples of such <b>dinghies</b> are the International Flying Dutchman, the International 505, the Jet 14, the Fireball, the Osprey, the Thistle, the 14ft John Spencer Javelin and the International 470. They can all plane easily, even upwind {{and they use}} trapeze and a symmetric spinnaker. Not all are two handed boats: the International Contender and the RS600 are high performance single handed boats equipped with a trapeze, but not a spinnaker, and demonstrate a comparable performance. Skiffs are usually classed as High performance <b>dinghies.</b>|$|R
50|$|The 24-hour {{race has}} been run by WLYC since 1967 for Enterprise, GP 14 and {{initially}} Firefly <b>dinghies,</b> and subsequently with Lark racing <b>dinghies.</b> A Laser 12 hour race has run from 2007.|$|R
5|$|Lyon {{thought he}} could teach Yagan British ways and convert him to Christianity. He hoped to gain his {{cooperation}} and use his tribal stature to persuade the Noongar to accept colonial authority. Lyon spent many hours with Yagan learning his language and customs. After a month, Yagan and his companions escaped by stealing an unattended <b>dinghy</b> and rowing to Woodman Point on the mainland. The Government did not pursue them; apparently its officials considered they had been sufficiently punished.|$|E
5|$|Other local sports clubs include cricket, hockey, rugby, {{lacrosse}} and golf. Among Eastbourne's {{golf courses}} are the Royal Eastbourne, Eastbourne Downs, Willingdon and the Eastbourne Golfing Park. There is an annual extreme sports festival {{held at the}} eastern end of the seafront. Eastbourne Sovereign Sailing Club, on the seafront towards the eastern end, organises <b>dinghy</b> sailing for its members and visitors from Easter to Boxing Day and usually holds a National Championship Series for a popular UK class in the summer months.|$|E
5|$|Steering was {{controlled}} {{with a single}} rudder. The vessels handled well and had a tight turning radius, but they suffered from weather helm and tended to drift while underway. The ships' crew numbered ten officers and 191enlisted men, and later increased to eleven officers and 197enlisted men. The ships carried several smaller boats, including two picket boats, one launch, two yawls, and one <b>dinghy.</b> These were handled with a large derrick that was fitted to the main mast.|$|E
50|$|Jack Holt, OBE (1912-1995) was a {{prolific}} designer of sailing <b>dinghies.</b> His pioneering designs of <b>dinghies</b> using plywood {{did much to}} popularise the sport of sailing in the period immediately following World War II.|$|R
50|$|Since 2006 smaller self-rescue {{lifeboats}} {{have been}} introduced for use by boats with fewer people aboard: these are rigid <b>dinghies</b> with CO2-inflated exposure canopies and other safety equipment. Like the lifeboats used {{before the advent of}} the petrol engine, these self-rescue <b>dinghies</b> are designed to let the passengers propel themselves to safety by sailing or rowing. In addition to their use as proactive lifeboats, these self-rescue <b>dinghies</b> are also designed to function as unsinkable yacht tenders.|$|R

5|$|According to investigations, {{the attackers}} {{travelled}} by sea from Karachi, Pakistan, across the Arabian Sea, hijacked the Indian fishing trawler 'Kuber', killed {{the crew of}} four, then forced the captain to sail to Mumbai. After murdering the captain, the attackers entered Mumbai on a rubber <b>dinghy.</b> The captain of 'Kuber', Amar Singh Solanki, had earlier been imprisoned for six months in a Pakistani jail for illegally fishing in Pakistani waters. The attackers stayed and were trained by the Lashkar-e-Taiba in a safehouse at Azizabad near Karachi before boarding a small boat for Mumbai.|$|E

5|$|Born in Windlesham, Surrey in 1976, {{where he}} lived and moved to Sherborne. He first learned to sail aged four or five, while visiting his {{grandparents}} at Christchurch, Dorset, and later sailed in a Seafly <b>dinghy</b> with his father, Keith. His talent {{brought him to the}} notice of Jim Saltonstall, who coached him in the Royal Yachting Association youth squad. Simpson attended Pangbourne College, a mixed boarding school in Berkshire, which originated as a nautical college, coaching students in sailing, seamanship and navigation. He studied at University College London, gaining a degree in economics. In addition to sailing, he was a keen footballer.|$|E
5|$|Friedrich Carl was an {{excellent}} sea boat; the ship was responsive to commands from the helm and had a moderate turning radius. She was somewhat unbalanced, however, and a 6degree rudder to port was required to keep the ship on a straight course. The ship's crew numbered 33 officers and 498 enlisted men, and while serving as a flagship, the crew was augmented with a command staff of 6 officers and 35 enlisted men. Friedrich Carl carried a number of smaller boats, including a large tender, two launches, a pinnace, two cutters, two yawls, and one <b>dinghy.</b>|$|E
5|$|Robert Peverell Hichens {{was born}} 2 March 1909, {{the son of}} Doctor Peverell Smythe Hichens and Constance Sawbridge Hichens. He spent his early life in Northampton, until {{the start of the}} Great War when his fatherâ€”an officer in a Territorial Army unit of the Royal Army Medical Corpsâ€”was sent to France, {{and the rest of the}} family moved to St Mawes in Cornwall. It was when living in Cornwall that Hichens and his sister Loveday were taught how to sail, {{eventually}} sailing their <b>dinghy</b> Arethusa on Carrick Roads.|$|E

5|$|The German navy {{found the}} ship to be very stiff in her {{sea-keeping}} qualities. Hansa was very maneuverable and was easily controlled while under sail; under steam the ship remained highly maneuverable but control suffered. The ship's crew numbered 28officers and 371 enlisted men. She carried a number of smaller boats aboard, including two launches, one pinnace, two cutters, one yawl, and one <b>dinghy.</b> The ship also carried {{an unknown number of}} picket boats and barges. Anti-torpedo nets were briefly fitted to the ship from 1885 to 1888.|$|E
5|$|The German navy {{regarded}} the ships as poor sea boats, with severe rolling, and {{a tendency to}} take on water. The ships had a very small turning radius, however, and were quick to answer commands from the helm. Their standard complement consisted of 32 officers and 285 enlisted men, and while serving as a division flagship, this could be augmented by an additional seven officers and thirty-four sailors. After their reconstruction in the 1890s, the ships' crews were significantly increased, to 33 officers and 344 enlisted men, and later to 35 officers and 401 enlisted men. The ships carried a number of smaller boats, including one picket boat, one launch, one pinnace, two cutters, one yawl, and one <b>dinghy.</b>|$|E
5|$|The KÃ¶nigsberg-class cruisers had a {{standard}} crew of 21officers and 493enlisted men. This later increased to 23officers and 588591enlisted men, and during World War II, the crew size rose to between 820 and 850 officers and men. The ships carried {{a number of}} smaller vessels, including two picket boats, two barges, two launches, one cutter, and one <b>dinghy.</b> The ships were moderately good sea boats, but {{had the potential to}} capsize if internal stores were improperly loaded, and suffered from a slight lee helm. They heeled up to twenty degrees with the rudder hard over. They were nevertheless very maneuverable and lost little speed in a head sea. In a hard turn, they lost up to 20percent speed.|$|E

5000|$|Because team racing must be {{conducted}} in equal boats the most popular boats for team racing are one-design <b>dinghies</b> or keel boats. The 420, Vanguard 15, Firefly, Lark and Flying Junior are the <b>dinghies</b> most frequently used for team racing. The Sonar, J/24, Maxfun 24, and J/80 are popular team racing keel boats.|$|R
