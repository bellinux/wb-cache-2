The analysis highlights the two sources of competition that a firm that source from an electronic market (e- market firm) face: competition with less efficient firms that source traditionally (t-market firms) and competition among <b>e-market</b> firms. When size of the upstream <b>e-market</b> is small, the first effect dominates and there is higher profits with lower upstream prices in the <b>e-market.</b> When size of the <b>e-market</b> becomes very large, the second effect makes e- market firms less profitable than t-market firms even though <b>e-market</b> price may start to increase (as market size increases).

40|$|An {{electronic}} market (<b>e-Market)</b> is an internet-based information {{system that allows}} buyers and sellers to exchange goods, services or information online. It has been becoming increasingly popular due to its potential benefits to business, especially to small-and-medium sized enterprises (SMEs), including strengthened customer relationships, ease of reaching targeted markets, improved efficiency, reduced costs, and greater competitive advantages. The potential of <b>e-Market</b> for Australian SMEs, however, has not been fully utilized. A majority of Australian SMEs have not made use of an <b>e-Market,</b> {{and those who have}} adopted <b>e-Market</b> have not moved beyond the entry-level adoption. This study aims to provide Australian SMEs with an integrated solution for successfully conducting their electronic business. Such a solution includes (a) the identification of the emerging patterns and the critical determinants for the adoption of <b>e-Market</b> in Australian SMEs and (b) the development of an effective approach for the evaluation and selection of the most appropriate <b>e-Market</b> for electronic business in a given situation. To adequately achieve the objectives above, this study adopts a two-stage approach. In the first stage, a mixed-method approach is used for investigating the emerging patterns and the critical determinants for the adoption of <b>e-Market</b> in Australian SMEs. Through using survey and interview, a proposed model is tested and validated for the adoption of <b>e-Market</b> in Australian SMEs within the technology-organization-environment framework using structural equation modelling and logistic regression analysis. In the second stage, an effective approach is developed by integrating data envelopment analysis, multi-criteria analysis, and fuzzy logic for effectively assisting SMEs in their evaluation and selection of the most appropriate <b>e-Market</b> for electronic business. The study shows a positive relationship between the perceived direct benefit, top management support, external pressure, perceived trust and the adoption of <b>e-Market</b> in Australian SMEs. Furthermore it also shows that the perceived indirect benefit and the organization readiness are insignificant to the adoption of <b>e-Market.</b> This leads to the development of an alternative model for better understanding the underlying reasons for such insignificant relationships by considering the indirect influence of the determinants on the adoption of <b>e-Market.</b> Such a model confirms that the perceived direct benefit, perceived trust and external pressure are critical for affecting the top management’s decision in <b>e-Market</b> adoption in Australian SMEs. This study makes a major contribution to the <b>e-Market</b> research from both theoretical and practical perspectives. Theoretically the study develops a validated model for better understanding the adoption of <b>e-Market</b> in Australian SMEs and provides SMEs with an effective approach for their selection of the most appropriate <b>e-Market</b> for electronic business. Practically, the study leads to several major findings which are valuable to various stakeholders in electronic business. Specifically those findings can (a) help government departments formulate specific policies and strategies in electronic business for SMEs, (b) provide SMEs with useful information and guidelines for assisting the development of doable strategies for successfully participating in <b>e-Market,</b> and (c) offer <b>e-Market</b> operators useful information for developing sustainable <b>e-Market</b> in an increasingly competitive online environment...|$|R

This paper explores further the question of the determinants of third-party <b>e-market</b> participation using a multiple case study research design.

40|$|Electronic Commerce {{has been}} a {{significant}} commercial phenomenon in recent years, and brings more benefits to people by comparison with the traditional market in aspects of cost, convenience and efficiency. The use of agent technology in <b>e-markets</b> for automatic bargains between buyers and sellers further increases the advantages of the <b>e-market.</b> However, most of existing agent-based bargain strategies assume a fixed number of negotiation participants, which may fail to enlarge agents 2 ̆ 7 profits or to lead a bargain to a success when these strategies are applied in the e-market-based agent negotiations straightway. Problems such as unexpected changes on negotiation participants, possible changes on agents 2 ̆ 7 expected negotiation outcomes, and unexpected switching in-between the buyer 2 ̆ 7 s and seller 2 ̆ 7 s markets need to be considered in order to guarantee agents 2 ̆ 7 benefits and the success of negotiations. This paper proposes a novel agent negotiation model to help agents to perform a more effective bargain in <b>e-markets</b> by considering the objectiveness of the <b>e-markets</b> and the subjectiveness of the agents. The <b>e-market</b> situation by considering the number of bargain participants is proposed to reflect the objectiveness of the <b>e-markets,</b> and the agents 2 ̆ 7 negotiation attitudes is introduced to indicate agents 2 ̆ 7 responses to possible changes of the <b>e-markets.</b> Both the objectiveness of <b>e-markets</b> and the subjectiveness of agents are taken into account in negotiation procedures such as offer evaluation, negotiation decision making and counter-offer generation. Experimental results on a simulated <b>e-market</b> illustrate the benefits and efficiency of the proposed negotiation model in handling agents bargain problem in complex and dynamic <b>e-market</b> environments...|$|R

40|$|The {{success of}} an agent {{mediated}} <b>e-market</b> system {{lies in the}} underlying reputation management system {{to improve the quality}} of services in an information asymmetric <b>e-market.</b> Reputation provides an operatable metric for establishing trustworthiness between mutually unknown online entities. Reputation systems encourage honest behaviour and discourage malicious behaviour of participating agents in the <b>e-market.</b> A dynamic reputation model would provide virtually instantaneous knowledge about the changing <b>e-market</b> environment and would utilise Internets' capacity for continuous interactivity for reputation computation. This paper proposes a dynamic reputation framework using reinforcement learning and fuzzy set theory that ensures judicious use of information sharing for inter-agent cooperation. This framework is sensitive to the changing parameters of <b>e-market</b> like the value of transaction and the varying experience of agents with the purpose of improving inbuilt defense mechanism of the reputation system against various attacks so that <b>e-market</b> reaches an equilibrium state and dishonest agents are weeded out of the market.

However, the reality shows agents in <b>e-markets</b> can either cheat or break contacts due to higher benefits elsewhere and {{is similar to}} what a human society is. Accordingly, the notion of trust in a human society should be implemented in <b>e-markets.</b> Most of existing researches on trust molded trust theoretically from different views, and hence {{is not easy to}} get them deployed in <b>e-markets</b> due to the essence of non-computability. However, current computable trust mechanisms, such as those in eBay and Nextag, uniformly manipulate trust involved in all trading, resulting in complaints about none-differentiable experience. On the other hand, a computable trust model can help the formation of coalitions in <b>e-markets</b> and gain market warfare. In this paper, we present a new computable trust model absorbing major views of trust with which agents in <b>e-markets</b> can better evaluate ones to be possibly traded with before trading processes take place. In this model, trust is characterized with the properties of being computable, individualized, evolutional, represented by scores, and extendable to the computation of coalition trust. 1...|$|R

To this end the paper proposes a conceptual framework that integrates the two. This framework is used to formulate a model, which incorporates the essential features of exchange mechanisms, as well as their implementations as is artefacts. The focus of attention is on two classes of mechanisms, namely auctions and negotiations. They both may serve the same purpose and their various types have been embedded in many <b>e-market</b> systems...|$|R
