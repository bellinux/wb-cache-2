There might be additional tabs to track editorial style decisions and scheduled changes to the blog that might impact publishing. Within each spreadsheet tab, there might be columns to track {{the name of the}} published piece, the assigned author, the publication destination, micro content (for example, sub headings and HTML alt and title tags to be used in links to the piece of content) and other useful information to track.|$|R

40|$|This {{contribution}} reconstructs {{the history}} of movable books, books created {{for a wide range}} of different purposes (teaching, mnemonics, play, divining, etc.) including mechanical or paratextual devices demanding or soliciting the interaction of the reader. The investigation runs from hand-written books to the most courageous paper-engineering experiments of the 20 th century Avant-Garde, considering some specific <b>editorial</b> genres, including <b>calendars,</b> “libri di sorti”, anatomical books, navigation handbooks etc., and animated children’s books. In particular, it demonstrates how the happy season for animated paper production and publishing of the 19 th century would not have been possible without the scientific inheritance of optical studies and vision sciences, precursors a short time before the invention of the Lumière brothers (1895). The study also examines some literary works using combinatorial mechanisms, experimenting the semiotic potential of expressive codes and very different techniques and materials: the reference is to books of Futurism and Dadaism, the “artists’book”, and other avant-garde texts from the second half of the 20 thcentury...|$|R

The first issue is the significant growth of data traffic, mainly driven by Internet-based services. Several statistics and forecasts have already {{been reported in the}} literature, comparing the evolution of IP traffic to that of traditional telephone traffic. As usual, such predictions can fail in the details, the crossing points get shifted in the time frame; however, it is clear that data traffic will playa dominant role in the future of telecommunications.

The revolution in what is generally named the "infocom" area is having an impact on the market, industrial, and scientific environments...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Social {{media has}} an {{integral}} role in today’s businesses {{due to the}} rapid development {{of the internet and}} digitalization. Still, businesses do not fully utilize the potential of social media and majority of companies do not have a digital marketing plan. Strong social media profiles facilitate a platform to showcase the expertise and research facilities, and strong, active social media profiles do better in search engines. Social media profiles can also be used for starting discussions on related topics or participating in them by writing as administrator. The fundamental purpose of the social media profiles on different sites is to drive traffic to companies’ sites and create leads. This master’s thesis was commissioned by VTT’s Renewable Energy Processes team. The goal was to produce a digital marketing plan to enhance customer and project acquisitioning by utilizing social media (LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter). In this thesis, the creation process of a digital marketing plan was studied especially from the perspective of VTT’s Renewable Energy Processes. The most important social media channels for the team were determined, energy solutions based on their expertise were studied, and a plan was conducted from the perspectives of the organization and employees. In addition, a questionnaire was sent out to the employees of VTT’s Solutions for Natural Resources and Environment organization. The purpose of the questionnaire was to gain an understanding of possible limitations and barriers for using social media professionally. In addition, it was used to map out the social media sites employees were already active at as well as what sites they might be interested in. The formed digital marketing plan includes strategies for social media and content marketing. A digital marketing plan was produced based on a mission statement, reviewing resources and defining target audience. An important part of the plan was to analyze companies’ as well as competitors’ current social media presence. For the social media marketing plan, sites were chosen and site specific plans were created. A content marketing plan was made to facilitate the creation and curation of content. The content marketing plan was an integrate part of the digital marketing plan as the most common problem is creating captivating content continuously. A trial social media profile was created in Facebook under the name VTTEnergySolutions. The profile was created in the beginning phase of this thesis and it was studied for the duration of approximately 5 months in 2016, from July to November. Based on the analysis, the reachability of a post could be increased by sharing it further to different discussion groups. There was also an interesting correlation between energy related events and increase in site traffic. The produced digital marketing plan is aligned with VTT’s new strategy. It focuses on utilizing the expertise of the employees, the VTTPeople, and increasing impact through creating and sharing content in the appropriate social media sites. Currently, the most important social media sites for the organization to be active in are LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter. These are the chosen sites for Renewable Energy Processes to begin their social media activities at. Based on the results obtained in this thesis, the VTT’s official social media profiles in these social media sites will be utilized in the future according to the suggestions presented in the digital marketing plan. A Showcase page in LinkedIn under VTT’s company page will be the platform for publishing content. The efficient use of current VTT related hashtags encouraged to create a new hashtag: #VTTEnergy. This new hashtag {{plays a key role in}} the strategy for Twitter. The trial social media profile VTTEnergySolutions in Facebook will be continued and other energy related teams will be sought out to share administrative responsibilities.
