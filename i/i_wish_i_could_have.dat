He {{had joined the}} series during its second season, and had to quickly {{manufacture}} props while working under time and budget constraints. He explained, [...] " [...] first episode {{we had to make}} the shape-shifter device, the thing that you put into your mouth and it transforms one person into another person. I was brand new here and I wasn’t happy with the way that turned out, and it came back in about 5 or 6 episodes. Every time it came back I was like, ‘Oh, <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> that time over again to redo this one."

500|$|In early August 2010, Entertainment Weekly {{reported}} that Eric the Actor, from The Howard Stern Show, had been cast {{for a small}} role in the new season's second episode. Deaf actor Russell Harvard portrayed Joe, {{a man who is}} able to survive the box being opened only to be killed by Fauxlivia. Harvard later commented in an interview, [...] "Fringe was so much fun and not even stressful compared to [...] Hamill. It was very fast and rapid. Playing the dead guy was very easy. Working with Anna Torv was so much fun, she is a great, great actress and very sweet. I did not think she would be that kind of person." [...] He continued, [...] "There was a stunt which {{she did not want to}} do herself, but I told her 'You want to be authentic so I want you to pull me,' so she obliged.

500|$|Playwright Alan Bennett was {{particularly}} repulsed by Witchfinder. In his regular column in The Listener, published eight {{days after the}} film's release, Bennett explained how he felt horror films should always be [...] "punctuated by belly laughs" [...] and attacked Reeves's completely humourless movie as [...] "the most persistently sadistic and morally rotten film I have seen. It was a degrading experience by which I mean {{it made me feel}} dirty." [...] Although Reeves was infuriated, his response indicated that he believed Bennett's reaction was proof that his decision to include such extreme violence was the correct approach to the material. In his letter published in The Listener, Reeves noted: [...] "Surely the most immoral thing in any form of entertainment is the conditioning of the audience to accept and enjoy violence... Violence is horrible, degrading and sordid. Insofar as one is going to show it on the screen at all, it should be presented as such– and the more people it shocks into sickened recognition of these facts the better. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> witnessed Mr. Bennett frantically attempting to wash away the 'dirty' feeling my film gave him. It would have been proof of the fact that Witchfinder General works as intended." ...|$|E

500|$|According to AllMusic, {{the album}} is mostly {{influenced}} by dance-pop, post-disco and pop rock music. The overall sound of Madonna is dissonant, {{and is in the}} form of upbeat synthetic disco, utilizing some of the new technology of the time, like the usage of Linn drum machine, Moog bass and the [...] This equipment has dated since, consequently the sound of the album comes off as somewhat harsh. Madonna commented on her debut album: [...] "The songs were pretty weak and I went to England during the recordings so I wasn't around... I wasn't in control. [...] I didn't realize how crucial it was for me to break out of the disco mold before I'd already finished the [...] album. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> got a little more variety there." [...] The album starts with the song [...] "Lucky Star", a medium-paced dance track, beginning with a sparkle of synth note and is followed by heavy beats of electronic drum and handclaps. A guitar is played in high riff and a bubbling bass synth is produced to accompany the guitar sound. The song revolves around the [...] "Starlight, starbright" [...] hook for more than a minute, before going to the chorus. According to author Rikky Rooksby, the lyrics are repetitive and inane, revolving around the transparent ambiguity of the stars, and juxtaposition of the male character with being a heavenly body in the sky.|$|E

In {{a letter}} to the Jesuit Father Herman Heuser, Sheehan's American biographer, Holmes explained: [...] "I was at Doneraile and called every day after luncheon, that time being the best for him.
