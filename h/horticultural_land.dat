40|$|This {{resource}} discusses soil microbiology, soil microbiological ecosystems and research {{into the}} analysis and maintenance of healthy soils and soil biological fertility, with Bioscience Managing Director, Dr Peter Keating. The terms microorganisms or microbes refer to the vast range of living organisms that {{are too small to}} be visible to the naked eye. They include, but are not limited to, bacteria, some types of fungi and viruses. Microbes can be found in all parts of our planet where life is possible. The study of microorganisms is called microbiology. The importance of microbes in soil is fundamental. Without them life on the planet would not be possible. Microbes play essential roles in maintaining soil fertility trough recycling nutrients and influencing their availability to plants, improving soil structure, supporting healthy plant growth and degrading organic pollutants. The functions and processes microbes perform or facilitate in our soil are incredibly complex and there are still significant gaps in our understanding of soil ecosystems. Filling these gaps presents a major challenge for the scientific community and for pastoral, agricultural and <b>horticultural</b> producers and <b>land</b> carers. Until relatively recently science did not have the tools to research and fully appreciate the scale and complexity of microbiological activity in soil. Advancements in DNA technology, however, are now progressing research into the enormous biodiversity and complex ecology of soil microbial ecosystems. Dr. Keating believes that understanding and maintaining the health of soils can provide the agricultural and horticultural industries with a foundation for sustainable practices and increased productivity. Dr Keating and his staff believe their approach is unique and holistic, taking into consideration the structural, chemical and biological properties of soil to build an integrated, soil fertility picture. The Bioscience laboratories in Forrestdale, Western Australia, are equipped to undertake the full range of analyses. They have invested in leading edge technologies to focus research on the link between soil microbiology, soil carbon and plant productivity, while retaining traditional methods of soil nutritional profiling, structural testing and microbiology analysis...|$|R

The areas selected by the project were located in biodiversity hotspots that are supporting rare and endemic plant and animal species. For more in-depth studies and analysis, the broader Embu and Taita benchmark areas were further sub-sampled into smaller areas that we refer to as study areas, designated by the symbols E 1 and E 2 for Embu and T 1 and T 2 for Taita benchmark.

Further to this, {{attempts were made to}} establish land use intensity (LUI) and land productivity (PI) indices that provided land condition indicators. The indicators offered insights into the quantitative relationship between the environmental conditions and land use. Parameters used in the computation of the land use intensity were; total quantity of inputs per ha, the frequency of input application, cropping intensity and cultivation frequency. The soils in Taita Taveta benchmark site were classified as Plinthic Lixisols, Plinthic Acrisols, Dystric Cambisols and Chromic Luvisols, while those from Embu ones were Rhodic Nitisols, Humic Nitisols, Humic Acrisols, Haplic Acrisols and Umbric Andosols.

30|$|Nitrogen {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{constituents}} of the cellular protoplasm of organisms, and its concentration in freshwaters controls the productivity of an ecosystem. Inorganic nitrogen in freshwaters occurs in three different forms, namely ammonia, nitrates and nitrites. Agricultural as well as <b>horticultural</b> <b>land</b> practices in the immediate catchment has a direct effect on the nitrogen and phosphorus content in the water body whose loading may lead to nutrient enrichment and the deterioration of the water quality (Harding et al. 1999; Cuffney et al. 2000). Higher concentration of these nitrogenous forms is attributed to the use of fertilizers in and around the lakes and the addition of faecal matters and other effluents from human habitation. Higher quantities of ammoniacal nitrogen were recorded during the winter which is an outcome of ammonification and slow rate of nitrification process. These findings are in conformity with those observed by Wetzel (1983) and Finlay et al. (2007). On the basis of annual mean levels of ammoniacal nitrogen, site VI ranked the highest, followed by sites III, I, V, IV and II in decreasing order. Site VI lying on the Wular periphery catchment has the maximum agricultural (r[*]=[*] 0.580) as well as <b>horticultural</b> <b>land</b> (r[*]=[*] 0.919), depicting collinear relationship of ammoniacal nitrogen with the aforesaid parameters (Harding et al. 1999; Cuffney et al. 2000). The concentration and rate of supply of nitrate nitrogen are intimately connected with the land use practices of the surrounding watershed (Horne and Goldman 1994). Higher values of the plant nutrient may be attributed to the agricultural run-off bringing with it NO 3 -rich fertilizers. Phosphorous, like nitrogen, is an important factor which plays a pivotal role in determining the productivity of water bodies. As far as the catchment characteristics of the study sites are concerned, it seems that agricultural land and <b>horticultural</b> <b>land</b> besides built up are the major contributors for the increasing values of nitrogen and phosphorus, thereby signalling positive correlation among the study sites in Wular Lake. Vollenweider (1972) has pointed that phosphorus, being a limiting factor, plays a key role in the eutrophication of the water bodies. The low orthophosphate-phosphorous content in waters is due to the formation of an insoluble calcium-phosphate complex. Such a phenomenon functions as scavenger of some inorganic nutrients and also acts as a removal agent of dissolved organic matter by absorption (Wetzel and Otsuki 1974). Phosphorous enters freshwater from atmospheric precipitation, groundwater and surface run-off from a highly fertilized catchment area. The seasonal dynamics showed that the concentration of phosphorous in Wular Lake was less in summer which is attributed to uptake by the plants during the main growing season. This is in agreement with the previous findings of Cole (1975), Kaul et al. (1978) and Pandit (1980, 1999, 2002).|$|E

Recent surveys have shown that concentrations of As, Cd, Cu, Pb, and ΣDDT (sum of DDT and its degradation products DDE and DDD) in such soils can exceed criteria protective of human health. ¹ Soil ingestion is a key exposure pathway for non-volatile contaminants in soil. Currently in NZ, site-specific risk assessments and the derivation of soil guidelines protective of human health assume {{that all of the}} contaminant present in the soil is available for uptake and absorption by the human gastrointestinal tract. This assumption can overestimate health risks and has implications for the remediation of contaminated sites. ² In comparison, the bioavailability of contaminants is considered when estimating exposure via dermal absorption and by ingestion of home-grown produce. ³ Dermal absorption factors and plant uptake factors are included in the calculations for estimating exposures via these routes...|$|E

Objective: to see growth and yield tomato lowland organic and inorganic fertilizers. RAK Factorial design of two factors, namely organic fertilizers, Manure, Organic Fertilizer granulesha, second factor is inorganic fertilizers:(1) PA- 1 : urea 150 kg/ha, SP- 36 200 kg/ha and 100 kg KCl/h (2) PA- 2 : Rainbow NPK 500 kg/ha+urea 100 kg/ha, (3) PA- 3 : Half dose of PA- 1, and (4) the PA- 4 : Half dose of PA- 2. Each treatment was repeated three times, 36 treatment. Varieties: Tombatu F 1 with a distance of 50 cmx 60 cm. Results: highest results in a single treatment of inorganic fertilizer, organic liquid fertilizer, and combinations thereof. In addition to liquid organic fertilizer, manure and their combinations give higher yields than organic fertilizer granules or a combination thereof. Plants harvested one time due to disease, drought, and no production. Natural Liquid Organic Fertilizer Plus prospected good because gives higher yields than manure or organic fertilizer granules, especially combined with a single inorganic fertilizer. <b>Horticultural</b> <b>land</b> in village of Waihatu necessary crop rotation or sterilized rested during one growing season to recover land planted continuously. ...|$|E
40|$|The study {{assessed}} {{the effects of}} hedgerow networks (line elements containing shrubs less than 2 m), woodlots (height > 2 m), other natural areas, and agricultural and <b>horticultural</b> <b>land</b> (polygons) in the landscapes on the abundance of a generalist thrips species in organic leek fields. Landscape maps were compiled from two GIS frameworks (LGN 3 plus and Top 10 Vector Analysis) and supplemented with information from interviews with farmers on farming practices. Landscape structure was analysed at two spatial scales, at a radius of 1000 and 5000 m respectively from {{the centre of the}} leek fields. A multi-habitat species, onion thrips (Thrips tabaci) was monitored in 21 organic leek (Allium porrum) fields during the growing season and their densities were related with landscape features and the density of natural enemies on the leek plants. Results show that the length of the hedgerow network (height < 2 m) in the landscape surrounding organic leek fields had no effect on the number of onion thrips in leek while there was a significant negative effect of amount of woodlot in the landscape on onion thrips densities within the leek fields. These results imply that non-crop elements in the landscapes surrounding commercial organic leek fields can have different effects on herbivorous thrips populations...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to describe and understand the decision making of organic and conventional farmers so that we could understand why, or why not, they grew organic products. Organic production was self defined by the farmers themselves not by us as experts. We did not examine whether actual organic standards were being followed. A majority of organic farmers had their organic status certified by Bio-Gro NZ (the organisation formerly known as the New Zealand Biological Producers and Consumers Association) providing certification in conformity with the basic standards of the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM). Therefore organic farming is defined as any land use which uses organic techniques. It includes agricultural and <b>horticultural</b> <b>land</b> uses and thereby includes both farmers and growers. However, for ease of reading, this report uses the words agriculture and farmer and they should be taken to include horticulture and growers. This report provides a review of literature on farmers’ decision making with respect to organic farming. It then introduces and explains the method adopted in this study, namely, the ethnographic decision tree approach. The results are presented {{in terms of what they}} tell us about understanding both organic and conventional farmers’ thinking about organic production. Finally, the conclusion discusses the results, compares them with the existing literature, makes some general observations and considers the policy implications...|$|E
