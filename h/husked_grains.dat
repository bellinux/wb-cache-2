The other half of an official's salary consisted of unhusked <b>grain</b> and <b>husked</b> <b>grain</b> measured in hu (觳, approximately 20 L / 676 oz); since one hu of unhusked grain was equal to 100 coins and one hu of <b>husked</b> <b>grain</b> was equal to 160 coins, the conversion ratio for unhusked <b>grain</b> to <b>husked</b> <b>grain</b> was 10 to 6 (see table below).

30|$|Firstly, {{it should}} be said that terms for grains at {{different}} stages of use (seed/unhusked <b>grain,</b> plant, <b>husked</b> <b>grain,</b> cooked grain) can readily shift referents from one grain to another, so it is unwise to attribute them uniquely to one grain. Secondly, in most modern TB societies rice is the principal grain, and so the semantic shift if any is likely to have been toward rice-related referents. Thirdly, if it is correct that rice was not first domesticated by speakers of Proto-ST or Proto-TB, one would not expect to find a universal reconstructable term. Finally, such words are subject to sociolinguistic change, whereby culturally-important words may have a series of honorific replacements through time, and there may be informal and baby-talk alternatives as well.|$|R

The rice was morphologically wild, but for the first time, we witness the possibility of human cultivation of rice and its deliberate threshing—the pottery contained chaff, not unprocessed whole grains (Zhao 2010). Similar evidence, also dating back to about 7, 000 BC and including residue analysis in pottery as well as stable isotope dietary analysis of human bone, indicates rice consumption at the site of Jiahu in the Huai Valley, a northern tributary of the Yangzi in Henan Province (McGovern et al. 2004; Hu et al. 2006; Liu et al. 2007).
