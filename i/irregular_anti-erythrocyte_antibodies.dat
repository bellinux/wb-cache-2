40|$|Objective. To {{inventory}} {{prevalence and}} morbidity of haemolytic disease of newborn caused by <b>irregular</b> <b>anti-erythrocyte</b> <b>antibodies</b> other than antirhesus-D. Design. Prospective registration study. Method. All paediatricians (n = 380) in general hospitals and contact persons (n = 79) in university hospitals were asked for monthly reports of clinical cases of haemolytic disease of newborn during 2 years (1996 - 1997). Results. Response was 97 %. A total of 130 reports were received in two study years, 49 {{of which could}} not be confirmed as non-RhD-non-AB 0 antagonism. In the group of which the transfusion history was known (n = 60), 29 pregnant women (48 %) had received transfused blood at some time. Of the antibodies found, anti-c, anti-E and anti-K were the most frequent. The direct antiglobulin test was positive in 61 of the 81 cases, negative in to cases, while in 10 cases it was unknown or false-negative due to earlier intrauterine transfusions (in three neonates). The highest bilirubin levels recorded were 572, 559 and 520 μ/mol/l (all three with maternal anti-c antagonism). Therapeutic data were known concerning 80 of the 81 newborn: 21 (16 %) received no treatment, 24 (29 %) only phototherapy and the others - in addition to phototherapy if any also blood transfusion, exchange transfusion or intrauterine transfusion, or a combination of these. Conclusion. It was calculated that the actual prevalence of <b>irregular</b> <b>anti-erythrocyte</b> <b>antibodies</b> in Dutch pregnant women probably amounts to approximately 0. 25 %. This finding may possibly be confirmed since starting 1 July 1998 all pregnant women in the country are screened for the presence of these antibodies. It is recommended that girls and women in the reproductive age group should receive primary prevention of development of <b>irregular</b> <b>anti-erythrocyte</b> <b>antibodies</b> by application of a selective blood transfusion policy, taking into account the occurrence of the antigens c, E and K.

The {{aim of this}} thesis is to evaluace the amount of discarded blood donors {{and the reasons for}} elimination in 2015 and 2016, further implementation of pre-sampling and post-sampling tests in the Blood Bank Department of the Hospital ČB, Ltd. In the theoretical part I attend to important events in the history of transfusion medicine. Next I deal with criteria for receiving blood donors, evaluation of the blood donors and ways, amounts and frequency of blood collections. The important part of my thesis are the reasons for discarding blood donors, which are divided into temporary and permanent. There are registers, in which these donors are registered. In the methodological part I attend to pre-sampling and post-sampling tests, which are performed in the Blood Bank Department of the Hospital ČB, Ltd. At pre-sampling laboratory measurement of hemoglobin amount on HemoCue 201 + is performed. For new blood donors the blood group orientation is examined on the slide. Donors plasma, platelets or in case of chylozity blood at the last sample hematokrit is examined. Further examination post-sampling test, which are include tests of infectious markers and imunohematology.

40|$|Natural or {{deliberate}} {{activation of}} the immune system of pathogen-free mice markedly affected their response to an autoimmune-inducing stimulus. Specifically, mice immunized with rat red blood cells were found to make antibodies reactive with both rat and mouse erythrocytes.

In an attempt to emulate this effect, mice kept in a sterile environment were infected with a potent polyclonal activator of B lymphocytes, lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus, {{at the same time as}} they were inoculated with rat erythrocytes. Whereas uninfected animals developed a progressively increasing autoantibody titer, infected mice quickly attained high anti-erythrocyte autoantibody titers that remained rather constant.

40|$|Mice {{infected}} with from twenty to fifty Schistosoma mansoni cercariae {{were found to}} have elevated serum IgG concentrations following patency of the infection, and the parasite-induced increase in concentration of IgG was dependent on the possession by the host of an intact T-cell lymphocyte pool. Following passive transfer of hyperimmune anti-sheep erythrocyte (SRBC) antibody, there was a more rapid decrease of haemolytic and haemagglutinating antibody titres in S. mansoni-infected, immunologically intact recipients than in uninfected intact mice, and infected or uninfected T-cell deprived mice. However, primary and secondary active immunization with SRBC resulted in similar patterns of serum antibody titre increase and decay in infected and uninfected intact mice over a time course of 140 days. The number of direct and indirect haemolytic plaque-forming (PFC) cells per million spleen cells was similar in S. mansoni-infected and uninfected immunologically intact mice 6 days after either primary or secondary challenge with SRBC.

Using one original and five known Crossmatch techniques on slides, pre-transfusion compatibility was tested on four sample groups of blood: 1 -blood drawn on EDTA or CPDA 1 for recipient (n= 7) -donor (n= 7) pre-transfusion compatibility evaluation; 2 - blood drawn on EDTA or CPDA 1 from healthy donors (n= 30) and recipients (n= 30); 3 -blood samples drawn on EDTA (n= 10) and CPDA 1 (n= 10) for evaluating their influence on agglutination reactions in stored blood (at 2 - 8 o C for up to 15 days); 4 - canine (n= 5) and feline (n= 5...|$|R
40|$|Complement C 5 a, {{a potent}} anaphylatoxin, is a {{candidate}} target molecule {{for the treatment of}} inflammatory diseases, such as myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury, RA, and the antiphospholipid syndrome. In contrast, up until now, no specific contribution of C 5 a and its receptor, C 5 aR, was recognized in diseases of antibody-dependent type II autoimmunity. Here we identify C 5 a as a novel key mediator of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) and show that mice lacking C 5 aR are partially resistant to this IgG autoantibody–induced disease model. Upon administration of <b>anti-erythrocyte</b> <b>antibodies,</b> upregulation of activating Fcγ receptors (FcγRs) on Kupffer cells, as observed in WT mice, was absent in C 5 aR-deficient mice, and FcγR-mediated in vivo erythrophagocytosis was impaired. Surprisingly, in mice deficient in FcγRI and FcγRIII, anti-erythrocyte antibody–induced C 5 and C 5 a production was abolished, demonstrating the existence of a previously unidentified FcγR-mediated C 5 a-generating pathway. These results show that the development of a full-blown antibody-dependent autoimmune disease requires C 5 a — produced by and acting on FcγR — and may suggest therapeutic benefits of C 5 and/or C 5 a/C 5 aR blockade in AIHA and other diseases closely related to type II autoimmune injury...|$|R

Results indicate that the V 4 – 34 gene undergoes class switching to IgG or IgA, with the progeny either remaining unmutated or containing large numbers of somatic mutations. Mutational patterns indicate possible ‘hot spots’, and some mutations appear deleterious. At the level of individual B cells, we have tracked a clonal isotype switch event from IgM to IgA, with each retaining close to germ-line configuration.

In central nervous system autoimmune disease, GA is thought to act through modulation of antigen-presenting cells, such as monocytes, mediating an antigen-independent T(h) 2 shift and development of FoxP 3 + regulatory T cells. Recent reports indicate that GA may also be effective in models of other autoimmune diseases such as uveoretinitis, inflammatory bowel disease and graft rejection.

Previously, such reagents have been produced either by chemical conjugation or recombinant expression in bacteria. These protocols required laborious processes for purification and refolding. The aim of the work reported in this article was to explore the production of the agglutination assay reagent as both a single chain Fv (scFv) antibody fragment and recombinant full-length mAb, expressed in a secreted form in commonly used mammalian cell lines. The DNA encoding the <b>anti-erythrocyte</b> <b>antibodies</b> was linked to that of a diagnostic peptide from West Nile virus, which requires glycosylation for recognition by antibodies present in the sera of infected horses.

Stable cell lines were produced for the expression of most, but not all of the constructs.

Isolation of pure and intact Plasmodium falciparum plasma membrane would provide a suitable model to elucidate the possible {{role played by the}} parasite plasma membrane in ion balance and drug transport. Results This study describes a procedure for isolating parasite plasma membrane from P. falciparum -infected erythrocytes. With this method, the trophozoites released by saponin treatment were cleansed of erythrocyte membranes using <b>anti-erythrocyte</b> <b>antibodies</b> fixed to polystyrene beads. These trophozoites were then biotinylated and the parasite plasma membrane was disrupted by nitrogen cavitation. This process allows the membranes to reform into vesicles. The magnetic streptavidin beads bind specifically to the biotinylated parasite plasma membrane vesicles facilitating their recovery with a magnet. These vesicles can then be easily released from the magnetic beads by treatment with dithiotreithol. The parasite plasma membrane showed optimal ATPase activity at 2 mM ATP and 2 mM Mg 2 +. It was also found that Ca 2 + could not substitute for Mg 2 + ATPase activity in parasite plasma membranes whereas activity was completely preserved when Mn 2 + was used instead of Mg 2 +. Other nucleoside triphosphates tested were hydrolysed as efficiently as ATP, while the nucleoside monophosphate AMP was not.

A modification of the hemolytic plaque technique, the addition of goat anti-mouse µ-chain antibody to the assay preparation, specifically prevented development of all γM PFC and enabled accurate and reproducible enumeration of immunoglobulin class-specific PFC after treatment with appropriate monospecific anti-globulins and complement. Culture conditions, with regard to medium, atmosphere, agitation, and spleen cell densities, were similar to those previously shown to support only γM PFC responses. Evaluation of the kinetics of appearance of PFC showed that γM PFC reached maximum numbers on days 4 – 5; the magnitude of this response was 3 – 10 times greater than γ 1 γ 2 a+ 2 b, or γA PFC which reached maximum numbers on days 5 – 6. Optimal erythrocyte antigen dose for γM PFC responses was 107 /culture, whereas a dose of 106 erythrocytes/culture consistently stimulated optimal γ 1 γ 2 a+ 2 b, or γA PFC responses. Investigations of the effects of <b>anti-erythrocyte</b> <b>antibody</b> on γM and γG PFC responses indicated that antibody suppressed these responses by neutralizing the effective antigenic stimulus at the macrophage-dependent phase of the response. At the same antibody concentration, γG PFC responses were more effectively suppressed than γM PFC responses. Further, γG responses could be almost completely suppressed by antibody as long as 48 hr after initiation of cultures, whereas γM PFC responses could only be completely suppressed during the first 24 hr.

For distinct groups of patients, these complications may be due to presence of some <b>anti-erythrocyte</b> <b>antibodies</b> (e. g., anti-A and anti-B haemagglutinins, anti-D antibodies) in the intravenous human immunoglobulin preparations. In the present review article, we show development of current quality standards for human intravenous immunoglobulins based on determination of antibody contents. Antibodies to erythrocytes represent a special safety index aiming to minimize risk of possible adverse effects connected with transfusions of human blood preparations. Different haemagglutination tests were compared to assess contents of anti-A, anti-B haemagglutinins and anti-D antibodies for specific safety of human intravenous immunoglobulins. Analysis of haemagglutination techniques for evaluation of human intravenous immunoglobulin preparations revealed their relative advantages and disadvantages. Various modifications of the methods are discussed, thus allowing to optimize process of quality control for these preparations based on detection of haemagglutinins and anti-D antibodies. We demonstrate a necessity to adjust regulations and to improve evaluation techniques for haemagglutinin determination in human immunoglobulin preparations at amounts of 100 mg/ml of protein. Special features of Russian national quality standards for human immunoglobulin preparations are considered with respect to assessment of haemagglutinins and anti-D contents. One may conclude that haemagglutination methods present the most informative and economically substantiated approach when assessing specific safety of human intravenous immunoglobulins by measuring contents of anti-A, anti-B haemagglutinins, and anti-D antibodies. </p...|$|R

Six different antibodies (called W 6 / 1, / 28, / 32, / 34, / 45 and / 46 were analyzed. These were either against antigens of wide tissue distribution (W 6 / 32, / 34, and / 46) or mainly on erythrocytes (W 6 / 1 and W 6 / 28). One of the <b>anti-erythrocyte</b> <b>antibodies</b> (W 6 / 1) detected a polymorphic antigen, since blood group A 1 and A 2 erythrocytes were labeled while B and O were not. Antibodies W 6 / 34, / 45 and / 46 were all against antigens which were mapped to the short arm of chromosome 11 by segregation analysis of mouse-human hybrids. Immunoprecipitation studies suggest that W 6 / 45 antigen may be a protein of 16, 000 dalton, apparent molecular weight, while W 6 / 34 and / 46 antigens could not be detected by this technique. Antibody W 6 / 32 is against a determinant common to most, if not all, of the 43, 000 dalton molecular weight chains of HLA-A, B and C antigens. This was established by somatic cell genetic techniques and by immunoprecipitation analysis. Tonsil leucocytes bound 370, 000 W 6 / 32 antibody molecules per cell at saturation.

Limited details on the mechanisms of protective immunity are a barrier to vaccine development. Antibodies {{play an important role}} in immunity to malaria and monocytes are key effectors in antibody-mediated protection by phagocytosing antibody-opsonised infected erythrocytes (IE). Eliciting antibodies that enhance phagocytosis of IE is therefore an important potential component of an effective vaccine, requiring robust assays to determine the ability of elicited antibodies to stimulate this in vivo. The mechanisms by which monocytes ingest IE and the nature of the monocytes which do so are unknown. METHODS: Purified trophozoite-stage P. falciparum IE were stained with ethidium bromide, opsonised with <b>anti-erythrocyte</b> <b>antibodies</b> and incubated with fresh whole blood. Phagocytosis of IE and TNF production by individual monocyte subsets was measured by flow cytometry. Ingestion of IE was confirmed by imaging flow cytometry. RESULTS: CD 14 (hi) CD 16 + monocytes phagocytosed antibody-opsonised IE and produced TNF more efficiently than CD 14 (hi) CD 16 - and CD 14 (lo) CD 16 + monocytes. Blocking experiments showed that Fcγ receptor IIIa (CD 16) but not Fcγ receptor IIa (CD 32 a) or Fcγ receptor I (CD 64) was necessary for phagocytosis. CD 14 (hi) CD 16 + monocytes ingested antibody-opsonised IE when peripheral blood mononuclear cells were reconstituted with autologous serum but not heat-inactivated autologous serum. Antibody-opsonised IE were rapidly opsonised with complement component C 3 in serum (t 1 / 2 = 2 - 3 minutes) and phagocytosis of antibody-opsonised IE was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by an inhibitor of C 3 activation, compstatin. Compared to other monocyte subsets, CD 14 (hi) CD 16 + monocytes expressed the highest levels of complement receptor 4 (CD 11 c) and activated complement receptor 3 (CD 11 b) subunits. CONCLUSIONS: We show a special role for CD 14 (hi) CD 16 + monocytes in phagocytosing opsonised P. falciparum IE and production of TNF. While ingestion was mediated by Fcγ receptor IIIa, this receptor was not sufficient to allow phagocytosis; despite opsonisation with antibody, phagocytosis of IE also required complement opsonisation. Assays which measure the ability of vaccines to elicit a protective antibody response to P. falciparum should consider their ability to promote phagocytosis and fix complement.

Este artigo se restringe à aloimunização contra antígenos eritrocitários em pacientes obstétricas. Quase todos os anticorpos antieritrocitários podem ser enquadrados em um dos 29 sistemas de grupos sanguíneos já reconhecidos, sendo os mais comumente implicados na doença hemolítica {{perinatal}} o anti-D, anti-c e anti-Kell, seguidos por anti-C, anti-E, anti e, anti-Fyª e anti-Jkª. A pesquisa de anticorpos irregulares permite o diagnóstico de indivíduos aloimunizados e modernas técnicas genéticas têm melhor caracterizado estas pacientes para a profilaxia e segmento pré-natal. O tradicional acompanhamento das gestações de risco para a doença hemolítica perinatal, com a espectrofotometria do líquido amniótico e a transfusão intraperitoneal, vem rapidamente sendo substituído pela doplervelocimetria na artéria cerebral média e a transfusão intravascular guiada por ultrassonografia em tempo real. É possível também citar como avanços melhorias nos materiais e na qualidade do sangue transfundido, que, em conjunto, têm elevado a sobrevivência de fetos acometidos. Indubitavelmente, a correta aplicação da profilaxia com uso do anti-D é exitosa com potencial para reduzir os casos de aloimunização. Alloimmunization is {{the formation}} of antibodies {{when there is an}} exposition of the individual to non-self antigens, as it occurs, for example, in the transfusion of incompatible blood and pregnancies, in whom the fetus express in its sanguineous cells antigens exclusively of paternal origin. This article is restricted to the alloimmunization against erythrocytes antigens in obstetric patients. Almost all the <b>anti-erythrocytes</b> <b>antibodies</b> can be fit in one of the 29 systems of already recognized sanguineous groups, being more implied in the hemolytic disease of the newborn anti-D, anti-c and anti-Kell, followed by anti-C, anti-E, anti e, anti-Fyª and anti-Jkª. The research of irregular antibodies, to permit the diagnosis of alloimmunizated people, and the modern genetic techniques have better characterized these patients for the prophylaxis and prenatal segment. The traditional accompaniment of the gestations of risk for hemolytic disease of the newborn, with the spectral analysis of the amniotic liquid and the intraperitoneal transfusion, has being quickly substituted for the Doppler ultrasound evaluation in the middle cerebral artery, the intravascular transfusion guided for ultrasonography in real time, beyond improvements in the materials {{and the quality of the}} blood, that in set, have raised the survival of the attempting fetus. Doubtlessly, the correct application of the prophylaxis with use of anti-D is successful with potential to reduce the alloimmunization cases...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the impact of}} changes occurring during red blood cell (RBC) ageing on the RBC-binding activity of pathogenic <b>anti-erythrocyte</b> monoclonal <b>antibodies</b> derived from autoimmune-prone New Zealand black (NZB) mice. As assessed by flow cytometric analysis on in vivo biotinylated RBCs, all five NZB-derived anti-RBC mAb exhibited more efficient binding to aged RBCs than to young RBCs, and resulted in a selective elimination of more aged RBCs from the circulating blood. In addition, treatment of RBCs with proteases markedly enhanced the binding of all five anti-RBC mAb, raising the possibility that increased exposure of autoimmune epitopes on aged RBCs may be in part, a result of contacts with proteolytic enzymes during the lifetime of circulating RBCs. In marked contrast, the binding activity of mAb raised in non-autoimmune animals against antigens expressed on RBCs, such as CD 44, CD 47, CD 147 and TER- 119, was either decreased or unchanged with RBC ageing, and these epitopes, except for that recognized by anti-CD 47 mAb, were highly sensitive to mild treatment with proteases. Our data unravel the unique molecular feature of RBC epitopes involved in autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, suggesting that membrane alterations in aged RBCs might {{play a significant role}} in the development of the autoantibody response to RBCs...|$|R
40|$|Canine {{idiopathic}} immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia (iIMHA) {{is one of}} {{the most}} frequently occurring immune-mediated diseases in dogs. A gel-based Coombs' test was shown to perform equally well as a classical Coombs' test. Since the gel-based Coombs' test can be commercially produced and is easy and fast to perform, this offers the opportunity to standardize <b>anti-erythrocyte</b> <b>antibody</b> testing. Two retrospective cohorts of dogs with iIMHA were studied; one cohort was treated with prednisolone and azathioprine (n= 149), and the other cohort (n= 73) was treated with prednisolone only. Dogs of both cohorts presented with severe anaemia, leukocytosis, and a third of the dogs had increased coagulation times and thrombocytopenia. There was no significant difference in survival between the two protocol groups; the one year survival times were 64 % (95 % CI 54 - 77 %) for the group treated with prednisolone, and 69 % for the group treated with prednisolone and azathioprine, respectively. It can be concluded that, contrary to current belief, the addition of azathioprine to a protocol of prednisolone does not decrease mortality. Azathioprine causes bone marrow suppression, however, in 8 % of dogs. Contrary to current recommendations for lifelong immunosuppresion, a duration of immunosuppression for 3 months was sufficient to maintain remission of the haemolytic anaemia in both protocol groups. Almost all mortality occurred in the first 2 weeks after diagnosis. Multivariate Cox's proportional hazards analysis showed that main predictors of this mortality were the presence of icterus, increases in plasma urea and creatinine, a left shift, increases in coagulation times, and thrombocytopenia. Since leucocytes have been shown to express tissue factor, it was hypothesized that leucocytes taking part in the inflammatory response in dogs with iIMHA had increased expression of interleukin- 8 and tissue factor. Nine commonly used reference genes were examined for their suitability as reference genes in canine whole blood. It was shown that the leukocyte count affected the expression of these reference genes. This emphasized that commonly used reference genes may not be stable under all experimental conditions and the assumption of stable expression under all conditions should be checked for each new experiment. The basal interleukin- 8 and tissue factor expression were determined in healthy dogs. These expressions were compared with the expression of dogs with sepsis, dogs with disseminated intravascular coagulation, and dogs with iIMHA. Dogs with systemic illness and dogs that had surgery but did not have sepsis or DIC, were included as controls. Since patient care related issues such as intravenous catheters may change tissue factor and interleukin- 8 expressions as well. The dogs with iIHA had a pronounced leukocytosis with left shift and signs of hypercoagulability. The coagulation factor activities were low and platelet parameters suggested platelet activation and high platelet turnover. Tissue factor expression was high in the dogs with iIMHA, but the interleukin- 8 expression was low. Since both tissue factor and interleukin- 8 result from activation of the NF-kB signaling pathway this suggests that the tissue factor expression is not increased in leucocytes, but possibly in other blood cells. A possible role for thrombocytes should be investigated...|$|R
40|$|The {{length and}} spatial {{organization}} of thin filaments in skeletal muscle sarcomeres are precisely maintained and {{are essential for}} efficient muscle contraction. While the major structural components of skeletal muscle sarcomeres have been well characterized, the mechanisms that regulate thin filament length and spatial organization are not well understood. Tropomodulin is a new, 40. 6 -kD tropomyosin-binding protein from the human erythrocyte membrane skeleton that binds to one end of erythrocyte tropomyosin and blocks head-to-tail association of tropomyosin molecules along actin filaments. Here we show that rat psoas skeletal muscle contains tropomodulin based on immunoreactivity, identical apparent mobility on SDS gels, and ability to bind muscle tropomyosin. Results from immunofluorescence labeling of isolated myofibrils at resting and stretched lengths using <b>anti-erythrocyte</b> tropomodulin <b>antibodies</b> indicate that tropomodulin is localized {{at or near the}} free (pointed) ends of the thin filaments; this localization is not dependent on the presence of myosin thick filaments. Immunoblotting of supernatants and pellets obtained after extraction of myosin from myofibrils also indicates that tropomodulin remains associated with the thin filaments. 1. 2 - 1. 6 copies of muscle tropomodulin are present per thin filament in myofibrils, supporting the possibility that one or two tropomodulin molecules may be associated with the two terminal tropomyosin molecules at the pointed end of each thin filament. Although a number of proteins are associated with the barbed ends of the thin filaments at the Z disc, tropomodulin is the first protein to be specifically located at or near the pointed ends of the thin filaments. We propose that tropomodulin may cap the tropomyosin polymers at the pointed end of the thin filament and play a role in regulating thin filament length...|$|R
50|$|MCD {{clinical}} features range from waxing and waning mild {{enlargement of the}} lymph nodes with B symptoms to more severe cases involving intense inflammation, widespread enlargement of lymph nodes enlargement of the liver and spleen, vascular leak syndrome with anasarca, fluid collections in the space around the lungs, and fluid collection in the abdomen's peritoneal space, organ failure, and even death. The most common 'B Symptoms' of MCD are high fevers, night sweats, weight loss, and loss of appetite. Acute episodes can display significant clinical overlap with acute viral illnesses, autoimmune diseases, hematologic malignancies, and even sepsis. Laboratory findings commonly include low red blood cell count, low or high platelet counts, low albumin, high gamma globulin levels, elevated C-reactive protein levels, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, IL-6, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and fibrinogen; positive anti-nuclear <b>antibody,</b> <b>anti-erythrocyte</b> autoantibodies, and anti-platelet antibodies; and protein spilling into the urine, and polyclonal marrow plasmacytosis.
