Hamilton was {{one of the men who}} restored King's College, which had been suspended since 1776 and severely damaged during the War, as Columbia College. Long dissatisfied with the weak Articles of Confederation, he played a major leadership role at the Annapolis Convention in 1786. He drafted its resolution for a constitutional convention, and in doing so brought his longtime desire to have a more powerful, more financially independent federal government one step closer to reality.|$|E

Tennessee's loss dropped it to 7-6, and the Volunteers remained unranked in the final college football polls of the year. Virginia Tech was credited for its bowl-game win and rose to 10th in both the Associated Press and coaches' polls. Visiting fans generated an estimated $31.2 million <b>in</b> <b>business</b> <b>for</b> the Atlanta area.|$|E
5|$|Just {{two years}} after opening, a flood in March 1904 did serious damage to the structure. However, the owners hired the Horseheads Bridge Company, run by the Perkins brothers. They charged $7,000 (1904 USD) to {{complete}} repairs of the bridge. With the reopening of the bridge, and along with the newly constructed Erie Railroad station, a new revitalization came to Skinners Falls and Milanville, including an acid company, creamery, and a dairy company, which helped raise income for the bridge using the $0.22 toll. One company that could not make it is the Skinners' timber rafting, which had been <b>in</b> <b>business</b> <b>for</b> over 140 years. In 1914, J. Skinner was the new owner, but the company was devastated when one of their timber rafts collided with a Myers family-owned ferryboat, killing four. The blame {{was placed on the}} ferry operator. However, along with the tragedy, the lack of riverside forests made it hard for timber rafting to prosper and in 1914, they closed their doors.|$|E

The 134-year-old Saint Patrick's Catholic Church was heavily damaged only minutes after Holy Thursday Mass, with most of its roof destroyed. The building was ruled a total loss and has since been demolished. The downtown business district as well as the eastern residential area and several parks suffered scattered damage of varying degrees.|$|E
25|$|The crisis led to {{questioning}} of the business model of the investment bank without the regulation imposed on it by Glass–Steagall. Once Robert Rubin, a former co-chairman of Goldman Sachs, {{became part of the}} Clinton administration and deregulated banks, the previous conservatism of underwriting established companies and seeking long-term gains was replaced by lower standards and short-term profit. Formerly, the guidelines said that in order to take a company public, it had to be <b>in</b> <b>business</b> <b>for</b> a minimum of five years and it had to show profitability for three consecutive years. After deregulation, those standards were gone, but small investors did not grasp the full impact of the change.|$|E

25|$|Aberdeen {{was founded}} by Samuel Benn in 1884 and {{incorporated}} on May 12, 1890. Although it became the largest and best-known city in Grays Harbor, Aberdeen lagged behind nearby Hoquiam and Cosmopolis in the early years. When A.J. West built the town's first sawmill in 1894, the other two municipalities had been <b>in</b> <b>business</b> <b>for</b> several years. Aberdeen and its neighbors vied to be the terminus for Northern Pacific Railroad, but instead of ending {{at one of the}} established mill towns, the railroad skimmed through Cosmopolis and headed west for Ocosta. Hoquiam and Aberdeen citizens together built a spur; and in 1895, the line connected Northern Pacific tracks to Aberdeen.|$|E

25|$|Although Lanying was sorrowful {{about her}} father’s death, she began {{working at the}} age of 60 after the Culture Revolution. She found that the {{dislocation}} density of existing gallium arsenide was very large due to gravity and not good enough to use, so she decided to make the experiment in artificial satellites. This was a dangerous experiment because the melting point of gallium arsenide is 1238 Celsius degrees. However, she finished successfully and became the first person in the world who had made this experiment successfully. Because of this work in gallium arsenide, the government in China named a gallium arsenide company(Chinese: 中科稼英) after her in 2001. This company has been <b>in</b> <b>business</b> <b>for</b> over than 10 years.|$|E

25|$|Amazon also {{employs the}} use of drop shippers or meta sellers. These are members or {{entities}} that advertise goods on Amazon who order these goods direct from other competing websites but usually from other Amazon members. These meta sellers may have millions of products listed, have large transaction numbers and are grouped alongside other less prolific members giving them credibility as just {{someone who has been}} <b>in</b> <b>business</b> <b>for</b> a long time. Markup is anywhere from 50% to 100% and sometimes more, these sellers maintain that items are in stock when the opposite is true. As Amazon increases their dominance in the marketplace these drop shippers have become more and more commonplace in recent years.|$|E

However, in 1995, the system of decentralised provincial government was abolished, and Awesa became deputy governor under national MP Dick Mune. He was subsequently sacked from that role by Mune after a series of disagreements.|$|E
25|$|Vonage offered {{shares of}} its stock to its {{existing}} customer {{base in the}} period before the initial public offering (IPO). Typically, only large institutional investors such as banks are able to buy shares of an IPO. Vonage’s initial public offering occurred on the New York Stock Exchange on May 24, 2006, opening at $17.00 per share. The price closed at $14.85, a decrease of 12.7 percent, the worst trading day for any IPO in 2006 up to that point. The IPO raised $531 million for the company. However, the existing customers who lost money filed a class-action lawsuit. The IPO and its immediate aftermath also earned Vonage a “Business 2.0 Magazine” award as 14th of 101 “Dumbest Moments <b>in</b> <b>Business</b> <b>for</b> 2006”. In 2009, Vonage reached an agreement with IPO investors. All shareholder claims against Vonage and its individual directors and officers who were named as defendants were dismissed. The amount of the settlement, $3.6 million, was paid by an insurance policy covering the directors and officers of the company.|$|E

25|$|Corporate finance is the {{traditional}} aspect of investment banks, which involves helping customers raise funds in capital markets and giving advice on mergers and acquisitions (M); this may involve subscribing investors to a security issuance, coordinating with bidders, or negotiating with a merger target. A pitch book of financial information is generated to market the bank to a potential M client; if the pitch is successful, the bank arranges the deal for the client. The investment banking division (IBD) is generally divided into industry coverage and product coverage groups. Industry coverage groups focus on a specific industry—such as healthcare, public finance (governments), FIG (financial institutions group), industrials, TMT (technology, media, and telecommunications), P (power & energy), consumer/retail, food & beverage, corporate defense and governance—and maintain relationships with corporations within the industry to bring <b>in</b> <b>business</b> <b>for</b> the bank. Product coverage groups focus on financial products—such as mergers and acquisitions, leveraged finance, public finance, asset finance and leasing, structured finance, restructuring, equity, and high-grade debt—and generally work and collaborate with industry groups on the more intricate and specialized needs of a client.|$|E
25|$|Child labour {{is still}} common {{in many parts}} of the world. Estimates for child labour vary. It ranges between 250 and 304 million, if {{children}} aged 5–17 involved in any economic activity are counted. If light occasional work is excluded, ILO estimates there were 153 million child labourers aged 5–14 worldwide in 2008. This is about 20 million less than ILO estimate for child labourers in 2004. Some 60 percent of the child labour was involved in agricultural activities such as farming, dairy, fisheries and forestry. Another 25 percent of child labourers were in service activities such as retail, hawking goods, restaurants, load and transfer of goods, storage, picking and recycling trash, polishing shoes, domestic help, and other services. The remaining 15 percent laboured in assembly and manufacturing in informal economy, home-based enterprises, factories, mines, packaging salt, operating machinery, and such operations. Two out of three child workers work alongside their parents, in unpaid family work situations. Some children work as guides for tourists, sometimes combined with bringing <b>in</b> <b>business</b> <b>for</b> shops and restaurants. Child labour predominantly occurs in the rural areas (70%) and informal urban sector (26%).|$|E
