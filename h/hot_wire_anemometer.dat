50|$|A {{hot wire}} {{mass airflow sensor}} determines the mass of air flowing into the engine’s air intake system. The theory of {{operation}} of the hot wire mass airflow sensor {{is similar to that}} of the <b>hot</b> <b>wire</b> <b>anemometer</b> (which determines air velocity). This is achieved by heating a wire suspended in the engine’s air stream, like a toaster wire, with either a constant voltage over the wire or a constant current through the wire. The wire's electrical resistance increases as the wire’s temperature increases, which varies the electrical current flowing through the circuit, according to Ohm's law. When air flows past the wire, the wire cools, decreasing its resistance, which in turn allows more current to flow through the circuit, since the supply voltage is a constant. As more current flows, the wire’s temperature increases until the resistance reaches equilibrium again. The current increase or decrease is proportional to the mass of air flowing past the wire. The integrated electronic circuit converts the proportional measurement into a calibrated signal which is sent to the ECU.|$|E

40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} some {{improvements}} successfully introduced to an anemoneter by the authors. 	The sensitiveness of a <b>hot</b> <b>wire</b> <b>anemometer</b> is generally known to decrease {{as the air}} 	velocity increases. This，however，was improved to some extent by adopting the following 	method. Two pieces of Pt-wire for the hot wire，on e in ap arallel direction with the air current 	and the other perpendicular to the former were stretched. Fluctuation of the pointer of the meter indicating the air velocity was minimized by applying an over-damped meter. Efforts were also made to minimize the error due to the voltage drop of electric source. The <b>hot</b> <b>wire</b> <b>anemometer</b> thus obtained proved to be useful in some mines and factories...|$|E

40|$|Injecting a {{gas into}} fusion {{reactors}} or semiconductor manufacturing systems, {{one has to}} quickly control the flow rate by a piezoelectric valve. In order to construct a gas injection system with high speed valves in the future, performance tests have been conducted on a commercial piezoelectric valve. An orifice flowmeter for measuring time average flowrate and a <b>hot</b> <b>wire</b> <b>anemometer</b> for instantaneous flowrate were manufactured.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{proposes to}} compare {{turbulence}} length scales measured {{with three different}} experimental systems commonly used in aerodynamic measurements, namely <b>hot</b> <b>wire</b> <b>anemometer,</b> Laser Doppler Velocimetry and Particle Image Velocimetry, using turn-key systems from Dantec and TSI, and for three different turbulent flows: a homogeneous and isotropic turbulent flow, a homogeneous shear flow and {{the wake of a}} porous disc. This study will show that Taylor macro scale assessment is not clearly dependent on the experimental system used, except for nonconstant shear, where the measurement volume size seems to be a critical parameter. On the other hand, Taylor micro-scale is highly dependent on the space or time resolution of the correlation and on the presence of random measurement noise.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to present a theoretical study of the compressibility effects on the performance of an electric D/C motor driven synthetic jet actuator for flow separation control. <b>Hot</b> <b>wire</b> <b>anemometer</b> experiments were conducted to validate the jet exit velocities predicted by the theoretical model.

40|$|To {{measure the}} drag {{on a flat}} {{cantilever}} beam exposed transversely to a flow field, the drag force anemometer (beam probe) uses strain gauges attached {{on opposite sides of}} the base of the beam. This is in contrast to the <b>hot</b> <b>wire</b> <b>anemometer,</b> which depends for its operation on the variation of the convective heat transfer coefficient with velocity. The beam probe retains the high-frequency response (up to 100 kHz) of the <b>hot</b> <b>wire</b> <b>anemometer,</b> but it is more rugged, uses simpler electronics, is relatively easy to calibrate, is inherently temperature compensated, and can be used in supersonic flow. The output of the probe is proportional to the velocity head of the flow, 1 / 2 rho u(exp 2) (where rho is the fluid density and u is the fluid velocity).

40|$|The {{authors have}} been carring on the studies on a <b>hot</b> <b>wire</b> <b>anemometer</b> by the 	use of a Pt-wireand Wheatstone's bridge，a nd {{it was already}} {{reported}} that the indicating 	characters were improved {{to such an extent}} for practical use. As the characteristics， 	however，were not linear，we tried to use a thermistor instead of the Pt-wire 	for the measuring head of the anemometer in this paper. As the result，linear characteristic 	was obtaind for the wide range beyond 0. 6 m/s，but for the lower velocity less 	than 0. 6 m/s，the sensitiveness of the meter was decreased with the decreasing velocity. 	In order to improve the weak point，new type of the measuring head which was constructed 	by the thermistor，the Pt-wire and the screen with 20 meshes was introduced. 	In such away，we obtained a <b>hot</b> <b>wire</b> <b>anemometer</b> with the linear character for the 	wide range of the air velocity.

40|$|The {{flapping}} {{wings of}} insects and birds induce a strong flow over their body during flight. Although this flow influences the sensory biology and physiology of a flying animal, {{there are very}} little data {{on the characteristics of}} this self-generated flow field or its biological consequences. A model proposed in the companion paper estimated the induced flow over flying insects. In this study, we used a pair of <b>hot</b> <b>wire</b> <b>anemometers</b> to measure this flow at two locations near the body of a tethered flapping hawk moth, Manduca sexta. The axial inflow anemometer measured the airflow prior to its entry into the stroke plane, whereas the radial outflow anemometer measured the airflow after it crossed the stroke plane. The high temporal resolution of the <b>hot</b> <b>wire</b> <b>anemometers</b> allowed us to measure not only the mean induced flow but also subtle higher frequency disturbances occurring at 1 – 4 times the wing beat frequency. These data provide evidence for the Summary predictions of a mathematical model proposed in the companion paper. Specifically, the absolute value of the measured induced flow matches the estimate of the model. Also, as predicted by the model, the induced flow varies linearly with wing beat frequency. Our experiments also show that wing flexion contributes significantly to the observed higher frequency disturbances. Thus, the <b>hot</b> <b>wire</b> anemometry technique provides a useful means to quantify the aerodynamic signature of wing flexion. The phasic and tonic components of induced flow influence several physiological processes such as convective heat loss and gas exchange in endothermic insects, as well as alter the nature of mechanosensory and olfactory stimuli to the sensory organs of a flying insect.
