5|$|In April 1943, the German {{leadership}} began {{preparing for}} Operation Citadel, {{with the objective}} of enveloping and destroying the Soviet forces in the Kursk salient, by attacking and breaking through the base of the salient from north and south simultaneously. The German offensive was delayed several times due to the vacillation of the leadership and the addition of more forces and new equipment. The Soviet high command, Stavka, had learned of the German intentions, and therefore used the delay to prepare a series of defensive belts along the routes of the planned German offensive. The Soviet leadership also massed several armies deep behind their defences as the Stavka Reserve. This army group, the Steppe Front, was to launch counteroffensives once the German strength had dissipated. The 5th Guards Tank Army was the primary armoured <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Steppe</b> Front.|$|R

The study {{of one of these}} areas, on the Liptako bedrock, reveals a concentric soil distribution: in a zone of brown soil with abrupt textural change and alkaline in depth (stagnic Solonetz), appears a ring <b>of</b> brown <b>steppe</b> soils (cambic Calcisol), and zones of alkali soils (Solonetz). These alkali soils are not saline but their soil solution is more concentrated than in brown steppe soils. The study of the abrupt contact between brown steppe soils and alkali soils shows morphological and geochemical changes, due to calcite and fluorite precipitation. The detailed study of this contact demonstrates a present transformation of alkali soils into brown steppe soils.

40|$|In Niger Republic, the {{regional}} development of irrigation {{along the river}} Niger is confronted with a large extent of alkali soils. For a sound management of the irrigated area, it appears necessary to understand the present evolution of these alkali soils. The study {{of one of these}} areas, located on the Liptako bedrock, reveals a concentric soil distribution : within a zone of brown soil with abrupt textural change and alkaline in depth (stagnic Solonetz), appears a ring <b>of</b> brown <b>steppe</b> soils (cambic Calcisol), around zones of alkali soils (Solonetz). These alkali soils are not saline but their soil solution is more concentrated than in brown steppe soils. The abrupt boundary between the brown steppe soils and the alkali soils is related with morphological and geochemical changes, resulting from calcite and fluorite precipitation in the soil solution. The detailed study of this contact demonstrates the current transformation of alkali soils into brown steppe soils. Therefore, it appears that soil alkalization is no longer in process on the terraces of the river Niger. The <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> brown <b>steppe</b> soils and alkali soils may be explained by the juxtaposition of two contrasted hydrological regimes in a former pond. This hypothesis is supported by aerial pictures and microscopic observations.

50|$|The canids {{that had}} immigrated from North America to Eurasia - Eucyon, Vulpes, and Nyctereutes - were small to {{medium-sized}} predators during the Late Miocene and Early Pliocene {{but they were}} not the top predators. The position of the canids would change with the arrival of Canis to become a dominant predator across the Holarctic. The wolf-sized C. chihilensis appeared in northern China in the Mid-Pliocene around 4-3 million YBP. The large wolf-sized Canis appeared in the Middle Pliocene about 3 million years ago in the Yushe Basin, Shanxi Province, China. By 2.5 million years ago its range included the Nihewan Basin in Yangyuan County, Hebei, China and Kuruksay, Tadzhikistan. This was followed by an explosion of Canis evolution across Eurasia in the Early Pleistocene around 1.8 million YBP in what is commonly referred to as the wolf event.

40|$|Kurgans {{are special}} {{man-made}} flatland <b>formations</b> <b>of</b> the endless <b>steppe</b> <b>of</b> Eurasia. The multidisciplinary excavation of Hajdúnánás-Tedej – Lyukas-halom, {{one of the}} typical Pit Grave kurgans in the Great Hungarian Plain region {{is presented in the}} paper. For centuries, archaeology has been the primary science to examine these objects. The buried soil profiles under burial mounds (kurgans) are the messengers of ancient landscape forming factors, soil generation processes and palaeobotanical patterns. Results from palaeopedology, soil micromorphology, geochemistry, palaeobotany (phytolith analysis and palynology) and archaeology are summarised {{in order to understand the}} evolution, construction and the former palaeoenvironment of the kurgan and its close vicinity. Based on the results gained from the various disciplines and the archaeological findings excavated at the kurgan the study gives an insight into the Late Copper Age and Early Bronze Age 1 - 2 periods including the Boleráz / Baden, Coţofeni, Pit-Grave, Makó and Nyírség cultures in north-eastern Hungary. Geochemical analysis underlines that the kurgan was built in several, separate stages. Palaeobotanical results have underlined the existence of a central ridge inhabited by (semi) xeroﬁ l steppe vegetation and lower microrelief depressions around it. Although phytoliths have shown the possible existence of a grove-like habitat, arboreal pollen is underrepresented in the samples. This is complemented by the palaeopedological analysis of the buried soil proﬁ le under the formation, which was identiﬁ ed as a Chernozem soil. Palynological analysis has drawn the attention on the probable human impact in the outer skirts of the later kurgan as weed species have occurred in higher concentrations in the examined samples...|$|R
