Hydrofracturing is favoured by large <b>interconnected</b> <b>pores</b> or large hydraulic gradients in the rock.

5000|$|The {{negative}} charge of its phosphate backbone moves the DNA towards the positively charged anode during electrophoresis. However, {{the migration of}} DNA molecules in solution, {{in the absence of}} a gel matrix, is independent of molecular weight during electrophoresis. [...] The gel matrix is therefore responsible for the separation of DNA by size during electrophoresis, and a number of models exist to explain the mechanism of separation of biomolecules in gel matrix. A widely accepted one is the Ogston model which treats the polymer matrix as a sieve. A globular protein or a random coil DNA moves through the <b>interconnected</b> <b>pores,</b> and the movement of larger molecules is more likely to be impeded and slowed down by collisions with the gel matrix, and the molecules of different sizes can therefore be separated in this sieving process.|$|E
50|$|A {{variety of}} {{mechanical}} adaptations, such as tip geometry and surface roughness, {{to aid in}} neural implant design have been investigated and implemented in recent years. The geometry of an electrode affects {{the shape of the}} electric field emitted. The electric field shape, in turn, affects the current density produced by the electrode. Determining optimum surface roughness for neural implants proves to be a challenging topic. Smooth surfaces may be preferable to rougher ones as they may decrease the likelihood of bacterial adsorption and infection. Smooth surfaces would also {{make it more difficult for}} the initiation of a corrosion cell. However, creating a rougher, porous surface, may prove beneficial for at least two reasons: decreased potential polarization at the electrode surface as a result of increased surface area and decreased current density, and a decrease in fibrous tissue encapsulation thickness due to opportunity for tissue ingrowth. It has been determined that if <b>interconnected</b> <b>pores</b> with sizes between 25 and 150 micrometers, ingrowth of tissue can occur and can decrease the exterior tissue encapsulation thickness by a factor of approximately 10 (compared to a smooth electrode such as polished platinum-iridium).|$|E
5000|$|NMR {{techniques}} are typically {{used to predict}} permeability for ﬂuid typing and to obtain formation porosity, which is independent of mineralogy. The former application uses a surface-relaxation mechanism to relatemeasured relaxation spectra with surface-to-volume ratios of pores, and the latter is used to estimate permeability.

They have shown that, in the fast diffusion limit, given by the expression:where [...] is the surface relaxivity of pore wall material, [...] is the radius of the spherical pore and [...] is the bulk diffusivity. The connection between NMR relaxation measurements and petrophysical parameters such as permeability stems from the strong effect that the rock surface has on promoting magnetic relaxation. For a single pore, the magnetic decay as a function of time is described by a single exponential:where [...] is the initial magnetization and the transverse relaxation time [...] is given by: is the surface-to-volume ratio of the pore, [...] is bulk relaxation time of the fluid that fills the pore space, and [...] is the surface relaxation strength. For small pores or large , the bulk relaxation time is small and the equation can be approximated by: Real rocks contain an assembly of <b>interconnected</b> <b>pores</b> of different sizes. The pores are connected through small and narrow pore throats (i.e. links) that restrict interpore diffusion.
