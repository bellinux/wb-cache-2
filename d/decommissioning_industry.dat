40|$|One {{of the key}} {{questions}} related to decommissioning is its optimal timing. In this final chapter, Geoffrey Rothwell integrates the findings presented in Nuclear Decommissioning Economics by proposing a model of discounted decommissioning costs. The real cost of decontaminating a reactor is specified {{as a function of}} its size, the volume of radioactive material, radiation exposure regulation, and the rate of productivity change in the <b>decommissioning</b> <b>industry.</b> The model allows calculation of an optimal waiting period between reactor shutdown and decommissioning. The optimal waiting period decreases with tighter radiation exposure regulation and higher inflation rates for radioactive waste burial. ...|$|E

40|$|From 1988 to 1994, Federal {{government}} agencies evaluated the technical, regulatory, {{and legal issues}} of Greater-Than-Class-C (GTCC) radioactive waste storage and disposal. Although many recommendations were made regarding GTCC waste management, {{very few of them}} were ever implemented. Now, with several nuclear utilities actively involved in reactor <b>decommissioning,</b> the <b>industry</b> faces numerous restrictions on GTCC storage and disposal. These restrictions, particularly regarding storage, tend to limit the industry’s ability to complete <b>decommissioning.</b> Recently, the <b>industry</b> sought regulatory relief from the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for temporary storage of GTCC wastes. In response, the Commission embarked upon a rulemaking to clarify its existing regulations so that licensees could use of away-from reactor storage facilities (e. g., independent spent fuel storage installations and monitored retrievable storage facilities) for interim storage of GTCC wastes. This paper evaluates the regulatory and environmental impacts of interim storage of GTCC wastes in these away-from reactor storage facilities. As part of the evaluation, this paper updates the current and projected (to year 2035) volumes, component types, and activity levels for GTCC wastes. It also summarizes the current types of GTCC waste management practices, and suggests a set of performance criteria for interim storage of GTCC wastes in away-from reactor storage facilities...|$|R
40|$|At the end {{of their}} lifecycle, several large {{infrastructure}} will have to be dismantled, presenting unfamiliar challenges. Therefore, project management will need to focus extensively on the delivery of successful decommissioning projects to meet stakeholders' expectations and funding constraints. While there is an extensive literature that investigates the techno-economic aspects of decommissioning, social aspects remain remarkably under-investigated. Even if stakeholder communication, involvement and engagement are widely believed to be key enablers for the success of a project, often the needs and preferences of local communities are neglected and a participatory-based form of dialogue averted. Consequently, decommissioning projects fail to meet their intended objectives. Focusing on the nuclear <b>decommissioning</b> <b>industry,</b> this paper addresses the literature gap concerning social responsibility. A deductive method to formulate and validate theories regarding the social challenges for decommissioning is developed through a review and analysis of salient case studies...|$|E
40|$|In {{the coming}} decades, the {{offshore}} <b>decommissioning</b> <b>industry</b> {{is becoming a}} quickly growing market, especially at the North Sea, where most offshore platforms have operated {{for more than twenty}} years. There is little room for the mistake in the offshore decommissioning operation, therefore the motion response analysis is essential to avoid the risks. It is common practice to use frequency domain analysis to simulate the dynamic behavior of floating structures in waves for linear system. However, offshore operations generally involve various nonlinearities such as nonlinear mooring system, wave-induced impacts during lift-off operation, and viscous forces. The frequency domain analysis is not capable of dealing with these nonlinearities, so the time domain analysis is pursued in this study. The Cummins equation provides an attractive way of analyzing the dynamics response of offshore structures in time domain, in which a convolution term is introduced to describe the uid memory effect. Neither the frequency domain analysis, nor the time domain convolution integral is convenient for time domain simulation. To facilitate the efficiency of time domain simulation, a state space model is introduced to replace the convolution term leading to a constant parameter time domain model. At the same time, the physical properties of the convolution term can be enforced into the state space model using convex optimization. The proposed time domain approach has been validated by comparing with the frequency domain analysis results for a linear system in the regular and irregular wave conditions. The topside removal concept proposed by Mammoet consists of a twin barges, in order to eliminate the problem caused by the moment-induced by the topside, as well as wave-induced motion, two linkages are incorporated into this concept. The time domain analysis proves that the purpose of these linkages are achieved that the relative sway and roll are successfully restricted. Finally, different load transfer stages are studied to obtain the dynamic response and its interaction forces between the topside and barges.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the emergence of sustainable decommissioning practice for buildings situated on nuclear sites within the United Kingdom. It reports on developments within the Civil Nuclear Sector that have enabled sustainable practices to become embedded in current business functions. The history of civil nuclear sites is traced from the 1940 's up to the present day, to provide a background to the industry. Many organisations have been involved with nuclear generation (a low CO 2 power source itself) and reprocessing of spent fuel, so the work identifies {{the question of whether or}} not this activity was viewed as sustainable. The current focus in the nuclear sector is on decommissioning the legacy of civil nuclear facilities and reprocessing nuclear waste. It is envisaged that decommissioning may take up to 150 years to conclude. This thesis demonstrates historical examples and recent cases where decommissioning and demolition of UK Civil nuclear buildings, through following good practice has been sustainable, whereby building materials were reused or recycled, and thus reduced sentence to a registered nuclear repository. It establishes business benefit for this practice and considers environmental, social and economic factors. Descriptions of case studies are provided. The author suggests the term "sustainable decommissioning" and investigates if the phrase truly reflects the practices of those organisations who work in nuclear decommissioning. A Literature review helps to show how sustainable nuclear decommissioning has developed. By conducting interviews with key people in the nuclear industry, including deliverers, advisors and Regulators, the thesis has established the gradual development of key features of sustainability in practice on United Kingdom nuclear sites. This thesis examines one selected key feature in more detail: the extent to which best practice publications have, or are, influencing actual site practice at Sellafield; and extending to the topical issue of "free release". Addressed in particular is the extent to which knowledge of (i) Nuclear Industry Code of Practice (NICOP) and (ii) Site decommissioning: Sustainable practices in the use of construction resources (SD:SPUR) is permeating, and has potential to influence, the nuclear <b>decommissioning</b> <b>industry.</b> The thesis concludes with the author's findings on sustainable decommissioning in the nuclear industry, how it's implemented and its success and impacts on the economy, social life and the environment. The main conclusion is that decommissioning of nuclear waste, including building materials can be done sustainably and described as "sustainable decommissioning", a term not previously been identified with nuclear activities. Implementation has come from both within and outside the industry, particularly from environmental (SD: SPUR) and stakeholder (NICOP) sources. Socially, sustainable decommissioning has provided initiatives for encouraging "free release" of materials into the local community...|$|E
