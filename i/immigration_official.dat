He left some of his luggage there, telling the manageress that he would be away for about eight days, and travelled the next day to Liverpool, where he took a room at the London and North Western Hotel on Lime Street. He bought a ticket to Ireland and took the SS Munster to Dublin via Kingstown (now Dún Laoghaire). It stopped at Holyhead in Anglesey, where an <b>immigration</b> <b>official</b> challenged Lody. His American travel documents proved sufficient to demonstrate his bona fides, and he proceeded on his way.|$|E

25|$|A visa most {{commonly}} {{takes the form}} of a sticker endorsed in the applicant's passport or other travel document. The visa, when required, was historically granted by an <b>immigration</b> <b>official</b> on a visitor's arrival at the frontiers of a country, but increasingly today a traveller wishing to enter another country must apply in advance for a visa, sometimes in person at a consular office, by mail or over the internet. The actual visa may still be a sticker or a stamp in the passport, or may take the form of a separate document or an electronic record of the authorization, which the applicant can print before leaving home and produce on entry to the host country. Some countries do not require visas for short visits.|$|E

25|$|Public {{pressure}} and widespread press attention made Canadian <b>immigration</b> <b>officials</b> investigate and consider each passenger’s background. In the end, Canada admitted {{all but two}} passengers from Walnut, waiving the immigration restrictions of the time by issuing an Order in Council for each individual. In January 1949, the Walnut refugees held a farewell party with local <b>immigration</b> <b>officials</b> before leaving by train to settle in various regions of Canada. The arrival of the small ex-warship had pushed Canadian <b>immigration</b> <b>officials</b> to change Canadian immigration intervention and interception policies.|$|R
50|$|The Tanzanian {{police also}} collaborated with Interpol {{to locate a}} {{suspected}} Tanzanian trafficking victim in South Africa using newly acquired cell phone technology. An April 2007 foreign government-sponsored “training of trainers” program for 18 police and <b>immigration</b> <b>officials</b> in Zanzibar launched the Zanzibari Government’s specialized anti-trafficking training program. This resulted in the Zanzibari government’s June 2007 co-training, with a U.S. anti-trafficking expert, of 22 <b>immigration</b> <b>officials.</b> On the mainland, 332 law enforcement officials received specific anti-trafficking training in 2007. Involvement in, or tolerance of, trafficking by low-level <b>immigration</b> <b>officials</b> is suspected, but not proven.|$|R

2500|$|Caesar was the {{youngest}} of three sons born to Jewish immigrants living in Yonkers, New York. His father was Max Ziser (1874-1946) and his mother was Ida (née Raphael) (1887-1975). They likely were from Dąbrowa Tarnowska, Poland. [...] Reports state that the surname [...] "Caesar" [...] was given to Max, as a child, by an <b>immigration</b> <b>official</b> at Ellis Island. This is an urban myth. According to Marian L. Smith, senior historian of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service, there is no known case of a name changed at Ellis Island. Max and Ida Caesar ran a restaurant, a 24-hour luncheonette.|$|E

2500|$|A visa (from the Latin charta visa, meaning [...] "paper {{which has}} been seen") is a {{conditional}} authorization granted by a country to a foreigner, allowing them to enter, remain within, or to leave that country. Visas typically include limits on {{the duration of the}} foreigner's stay, territory within the country they may enter, the dates they may enter, the number of permitted visits or an individual's right to work in the country in question. Visas are associated with the request for permission to enter a country and thus are, in some countries, distinct from actual formal permission for an alien to enter and remain in the country. In each instance, a visa is subject to entry permission by an <b>immigration</b> <b>official</b> at the time of actual entry, and can be revoked at any time.|$|E
2500|$|The {{utilization}} {{rate of the}} 72 or 144-hour TWOV scheme varies significantly depending on the port of entry. Airports in Beijing, Guangzhou and the Yangtze River Delta region receive {{the vast majority of}} passengers with Shanghai seeing over 125 passengers on a daily basis and over 15,000 visitors since the commencement of the 144-hour TWOV, while airports in smaller cities such as Wuhan, Tianjin, Xi'an and Kunming received less than 50 per month since the commencement, with Kunming only received a total of 133 travelers from October 2014 to September 2016. An <b>immigration</b> <b>official</b> in Kunming even said that it could take [...] "a few weeks" [...] before they can see the next passenger to utilize TWOV. Officials in these cities cited the lack of awareness of the policy, the restrictions on movements, the short period of time, a lack of international flights from airports, and the shortage of services offered by travel agencies as the main reasons of the lack of passengers.|$|E
2500|$|When [...] Maru {{arrived in}} Canadian waters, first at Coal Harbour in Burrard Inlet some 200 meters off CPR Pier A, {{it was not}} allowed to dock. The first {{immigration}} officer to meet the ship in Vancouver was Fred [...] "Cyclone" [...] Taylor. While Prime Minister of Canada Robert Borden decided {{what to do with the}} ship, the Conservative Premier of British Columbia, Richard McBride, gave a categorical statement that the passengers would not be allowed to disembark. Conservative MP H. H. Stevens organized a public meeting against allowing the ship's passengers to disembark and urged the government to refuse to allow the ship to remain. Stevens worked with <b>immigration</b> <b>official</b> Malcolm R.J. Reid to keep the passengers off shore. Reid's intransigence, supported by Stevens, led to mistreatment of the passengers on the ship and prolonged its departure date, which was not resolved until the intervention of the federal Minister of Agriculture, Martin Burrell, MP for Yale—Cariboo.|$|E

Borleh was a teacher at an Islamic school, {{and said he was}} going abroad for health reasons, according to Sheikh Mohamed Abdullahi, a mosque imam in Hargeisa. A Somali federal official stated that Borleh had been monitored by security agents, [...] "but we had never considered him to be dangerous". A senior Somalia <b>immigration</b> <b>official</b> said that Borleh had obtained a Turkish visa to work in Turkey as an adviser for the foreign ministry. A letter was allegedly sent from the Somali Embassy in Ankara to the Turkish Embassy in Mogadishu, asking the Turkish Embassy to facilitate a visa for Borleh to be [...] "an adviser to the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Investment Promotions". The Somali Embassy in Ankara denied sending any such letter.|$|E
2500|$|Aaron Copland {{was born}} in Brooklyn, New York, on November 14, 1900. He was the {{youngest}} of five children in a Conservative Jewish family of Lithuanian origins. While emigrating from Russia to the United States, Copland's father, Harris Morris Copland, lived and worked in Scotland for two to three years to pay for his boat fare to the US. It was there that Copland's father may have Anglicized his surname [...] "Kaplan" [...] to [...] "Copland", though Copland himself believed for many years that the change had been due to an Ellis Island <b>immigration</b> <b>official</b> when his father entered the country. Copland was however unaware until late in his life that the family name had been Kaplan, and his parents never told him this. Throughout his childhood, Copland and his family lived above his parents' Brooklyn shop, H.M. Copland's, at 628 Washington Avenue (which Aaron would later describe as [...] "a kind of neighborhood Macy's"), on the corner of Dean Street and Washington Avenue, and most of the children helped out in the store. His father was a staunch Democrat. The family members were active in Congregation Baith Israel Anshei Emes, where Aaron celebrated his Bar Mitzvah. Not especially athletic, the sensitive young man became an avid reader and often read Horatio Alger stories on his front steps.|$|E
