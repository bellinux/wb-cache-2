40|$|Control Moment Gyroscopes (CMGs) are {{not often}} {{considered}} {{for use on}} small satellites and, as a result few small satellite missions have implemented CMGs as on-board actuators. There are many reasons for this, but mainly this is due {{the complexity of the}} mechanical and control system needed to implement an effective CMG, and also because off-the-shelf CMG systems are generally made for the larger satellite market.. CMGs offer many advantages over reaction wheel systems. When used on a small satellite, a CMG based control system can provide the ability to perform very fast slew maneuvers, making CMGs very attractive to high resolution small satellite imaging missions. The CMG described in this paper incorporates two motors; a Brushless DC Motor (BLDC) and a Stepper Motor. The BLDC provides an efficient means of driving the <b>inertia</b> <b>disk</b> to store the angular momentum, whilst the stepper motor provides precision gimbal control. In order to keep mass and power consumption low, both motors are controlled from a single FPGA. The FPGA runs all associated commutation, speed and position control for both motors and also provides the command and telemetry interface {{to the rest of the}} spacecraft. The resulting system is a compact, power efficient design that is ideal for small satellites...|$|E

A new setup that uses a low <b>inertia</b> rotating <b>disk</b> electrode (RDE) adapted in an autoclave is proposed. This setup allows obtaining polarizations curves and electro-hydrodynamic (EHD) impedance, the latter {{for the first time}} in pressured conditions. New equations to adjust the Levich plots are proposed and briefly discussed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} energy method {{is used to}} {{calculate}} rotor response with loose rotating disk on it. System equation of motion is obtained based on energy method and Lagrange equation. Mathematical modeling of loose disk in a rotor bearing system has resulted in terms similar to unbalance and gyroscopic effect in the system equation of motion. The effect of loose disk axial position and orthotropic bearing has been considered in this investigation. By assuming that shaft and loose disk are always in contact, the results of these study shows that clearance between loose disk and shaft, shaft speed, mass and mass moment of <b>inertia</b> of <b>disk</b> have a major effect on a rotor response and beating phenomena...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, the eect of shaft {{rotation}} on {{its natural}} frequency is investigated. Considering rotary inertia and gyroscopic momentum, the fourth order dierential equation representing the exural vibration {{of the shaft}} is solved by the new analytical method. The Distributed Lumped Modeling Technique (DLMT) is applied to obtain the transfer matrix for the distributed elements using the proposed method and for the lumped elements consisting of rotary inertia and gyroscopic eects. The results obtained by this method are compared and veried {{with the results of}} two other methods. The eects of shaft diameter, shaft length and <b>disk</b> <b>inertia</b> on the natural frequency are discussed for various speeds. It is shown that, while the new method brings highly accurate results, its simplicity and accuracy provide proper application for use in industrial systems...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the dynamic stability {{analysis of a}} spinning, thick, annular disk loaded by a circumferentially distributed frictional traction. Considering the automotive/aircraft disc brake as a representative system for this study, the brake rotor is modeled as a spinning annular disk {{in the context of}} the Mindlin 2 ̆ 7 s thick plate theory to ensure a more accurate estimation of the eigenvalues when the disk involves high circumferential vibration modes that are often observed in unstable disc brake rotors. The frictional traction is decomposed into in-plane and transverse components. The in-plane component is equilibrated by membrane stresses while the transverse component is a nonconservative follower-type force that is the source of the dynamic instability of the disk. The corresponding nonconservative eigenvalue problem is formulated based on the modal expansion theory for traveling waves and direct discretization technique. The brake pad or stator is modeled as a second order viscoelastic subgrade that reacts to both transverse and shearing motion of the disc brake rotor. The instability behavior of the disk is investigated by examining the resulting complex eigenvalues under various combinations of the system para-meters such as frictional traction, geometry of the disk, and viscoelastic properties of the pad lining. In order to assess the effects of shear deformations and rotary <b>inertia</b> of the <b>disk</b> model under such loading conditions, results are compared with those from the classical Kirch-hoff [...] Love 2 ̆ 7 s thin disk model. Based on the phase angle information of the eigenvalues, it is found that there exists a critical value of friction, slenderness ratio of the disk, and the size of pad lining at which the transverse amplitude growth rates of high circumferential vibration modes drastically increase. Unless damping is present in the disc brake rotor or pad lining, vibration modes with repeated eigenvalues are found to be always unstable either by means of divergence or flutter even for a very small nonconservative traction load...|$|R
