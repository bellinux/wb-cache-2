40|$|AbstractObjectives. This shudy was {{designed}} to assess the direct effects of <b>flosequinan</b> on myocardial function. Background. <b>Flosequinan</b> {{has been shown to}} improve symptoms and exercise tolerance in patients with heart failure. Although previous studies have established that <b>flosequinan</b> is a vasodilator, it is not known to what extent direct actions of the drug on myocardial contractility or diastolic properties contribute to its beneficial hemodynamic effects. Methods. Nitroprusside and intravenous <b>flosequinan</b> were administered sequentially to 18 patients with severe heart failure (New York Heart Association functional class III or IV, left ventricular ejection fraction 0. 14 ± 0. 02). Micromanometer left ventricular pressure and radionuclide volume data were combined to construct pressure-volume loops during 1) a baseline period, 2) nitroprusside infusion, 3) a second baseline period, and 4) <b>flosequinan</b> infusion. Results. The peak rate of left ventricular pressure development increased from 899 ± 84 to 1, 070 ± 94 mm Hg/s (p < 0. 05) with <b>flosequinan.</b> The baseline left ventricular end-systolic pressure-volume relation was constructed in 15 patients from the two baseline pressure-volume loops and from that obtained during afterload manipulation with nitroprusside. During <b>flosequinan</b> administration, the relation between end-systolic pressure and volume was shifted upward and leftward, indicating enhanced contractility. in 14 of 15 patients (p < 0. 001). The maximal rate of decrease in left ventricular pressure during isovolumetric relaxation increased in magnitude with <b>flosequinan</b> from 882 ± 63 to 1, 026 ± 68 mm Hg/s (p < 0. 05). Conclusions. These results indicate that intravenous <b>flosequinan</b> has positive inotropic and lusitropic effects in patients with heart failure.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{efficacy}} of <b>flosequinan</b> in chronic heart failure. Background. <b>Flosequinan</b> is a new vasodilator drug that acts by interfering with the inositol-triphosphate/protein kinase C pathway, an important mechanism of vasoconstriction. The drug dilates both peripheral arteries and veins, is orally active and has a long duration of action that permits once-daily dosing. Previous studies have shown that <b>flosequinan</b> produces sustained hemodynamic benefits in heart failure, but large scale studies evaluating its clinical efficacy have not been reported. Methods. One hundred ninety-three patients with chronic heart failure (New York Heart Association functional class II or III and left ventricular ejection fraction < 40 %) receiving digoxin and diuretic drugs were randomly assigned (double-blind) to the addition of <b>flosequinan</b> (100 mg once daily, n = 93) or placebo (n = 100) for 3 months. The clinical status and exercise tolerance of each patient was evaluated at the start of the study and every 2 to 4 weeks during the trial while background therapy remained constant. Results. After 12 weeks, maximal treadmill exercise time increased by 96 s in the <b>flosequinan</b> group but by only 47 s in the placebo group (p = 0. 022 for the difference between groups). Maximal oxygen consumption increased by 1. 7 ml/kg per in the <b>flosequinan</b> group (n = 17) but by only 0. 6 ml/kg per min in the placebo group (n = 23), p = 0. 05 between the groups. Symptomatically, 55 % of patients receiving <b>flosequinan</b> but only 36 % of patients receiving placebo benefited from treatment (p = 0. 018). In addition, fewer patients treate with <b>flosequinan</b> had sufficiently severe worsening of heart failure to require a change in medication or withdrawal from the study (p = 0. 07). By intention to treat, seven patients in the <b>flosequinan</b> group and two patients in the placebo group died. Conclusions. These findings indicate that <b>flosequinan</b> is an effective drug for patients with chronic heart failure who remain symptomatic despite treatment with digoxin and diuretic drugs. The effect of the drug on survival remains to be determined...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectives. We {{evaluated}} the short- and {{long-term effects of}} <b>flosequinan</b> in 47 patients with severe heart failure despite ongoing captopril treatment. Background. There have been no previous evaluations of the long-term hemodynamic effects of any direct-acting vasodilator in patients with heart failure receiving an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. <b>Flosequinan</b> is an arterial and venous vasodilator with actions {{similar to those of}} the hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate combination. Methods. After baseline hemodynamic measurements using balloon-tipped pulmonary artery and radial arterial catheters, patients were randomized to receive 50, 100 or 150 mg of <b>flosequinan</b> daily. Hemodynamic variables were measured immediately before and after short-term <b>flosequinan</b> administration and after 8 weeks of therapy. Results. With short-term <b>flosequinan</b> administration, mean arterial, right atrial and left ventricular filling pressures decreased by 6. 4 ± 1. 1, 3. 8 ± 0. 5 and 7. 3 ± 0. 7 mm Hg, respectively (all p < 0. 001). Cardiac index increased by 0. 5 ± 0. 1 liters/min per m 2, systemic vascular resistance decreased by 616 ± 105 dynes · s · cm− 5 and heart rate increased by 4 ± l beats/min (all p < 0. 001). After 8 weeks of long-term <b>flosequinan</b> administration, the vasodilator effect of a dose of <b>flosequinan</b> persisted. Compared with pretreatment baseline values, mean arterial, right atrial and left ventricular filling pressures at the peak effect of <b>flosequinan</b> were decreased by 3. 5 ± 1. 3, 2. 8 ± 0. 7 and 5. 1 ± 1. 3 mm Hg, respectively (all p < 0. 01).

40|$|The {{exercise}} {{capability of}} 12 patients with heart failure was investigated {{by a variety}} of different methods before and after treatment with the vasodilator <b>flosequinan.</b> Two treadmill protocols were used, a modified Bruce with incremental work-loads and a fixed workload protocol. On placebo, mean exercise time was greater with the Bruce protocol, 526 (64) s, than with the fixed protocol, 359 (59) s, P < 0 - 005. <b>Flosequinan</b> increased exercise time more with the fixed protocol, so after 5 weeks ' treatment exercise time was the same with both protocols; 680 (64) s with the Bruce and 673 (147) s with the fixed protocol.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the immediate and long-term systemic and coronary hemodynamic, metabolic and neurohormonal effects of <b>flosequinan</b> in patients with congestive heart failure. Background. Preliminary studies have shown that this new long-acting oral systemic vasodilator may have beneficial effects in patients with heart failure. Methods. Thirteen patients with congestive heart failure were studied. Systemic and coronary hemodynamic, metabolic and neurohormonal effects of <b>flosequinan</b> were assessed acutely with repeat systemic hemodynamic studies after 6 weeks of treatment. Results. The administration of <b>flosequinan</b> acutely and after long-term treatment, resulted in a significant increase in cardiac index, stroke work index and stroke volume index with a reduction in systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances. The improvement in ventricular function was associated with an improvement in left ventricular efficiency without a change in myocardial oxygen consumption or coronary sinus blood flow. Myocardial oxygen extraction and net myocardial lactate extraction also did not change significantly with <b>flosequinan</b> therapy. Systemic catecholamine levels and myocardial catecholamine balance did not change. Plasma arterial and coronary sinus atrial natriuretic factor concentrations were elevated at baseline; the latter concentrations at the level of the great cardiac vein were significantly higher than those of arterial concentrations, indicating increased left ventricular release of atrial natriuretic factor in congestive heart failure. Both arterial and coronary sinus atrial natriuretic factor levels were significantly reduced with the administration of <b>flosequinan</b> at peak effect in association with an improvement in systemic hemodynamics.

The hemodynamic data documented substantial systemic vasodilation manifest by a reduction in right atrial pressure (p = 0. 01), mean pulmonary artery pressure (p p p p = 0. 01) and left ventricular ejection fraction (p = 0. 02) and reductions in mean aortic pressure (p = 0. 02), systemic vascular resistance (p = 0. 01), and left ventricular volumes (p max), Emax corrected for the change in left ventricular volume, or preload recruitable stroke work (Msw). In contrast, there was an improvement in isovolumic relaxation manifest by an increase in maximum rate of fall of left ventricular pressure standardized for left ventricular end-systolic pressure [(-) dP/dtmin/Pes]; p = 0. 02), an acceleration in the rate of isovolumic relaxation (p = 0. 01), and an improvement in left ventricular chamber stiffness (p = 0. 02). These data indicate that when <b>flosequinan,</b> a new therapeutic agent {{for the treatment of}} congestive heart failure, is administered in hemodynamically relevant low doses to patients with dilated congestive cardiomyopathy who were receiving standard therapy for heart failure, left ventricular pump function and diastolic function is further improved.
