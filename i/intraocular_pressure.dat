40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the visual outcomes {{in patients with}} advanced visual field (VF) loss undergoing trabeculectomy with mitomycin C. Methods: The records of patients with severe preoperative VF defects undergoing trabeculectomy from June 1, 1998, through October 31, 2005, were retrospectively reviewed. Severe loss of central vision was defined as visual acuity (VA) of 20 / 200 or less in the affected eye, counting fingers or less if preoperative VA was less than 20 / 200, or more than a 4 -line reduction in Snellen VA. Results: Central vision loss occurred in 7 of 117 patients (eyes) (6 %) because of hypotony maculopathy (3 cases), uncontrolled elevated <b>intraocular</b> <b>pressures</b> (2 cases), posterior subcapsular cataract increase (1 case), and inflammatory reaction (1 case). A statistically significant mean VA reduction after surgery from − 0. 32 to − 0. 39 (logMAR, P=. 01) was found. Differences in VF parameters before and after surgery were not statistically significant. Patients who had severe loss of central vision had statistically significantly higher mean±SD preoperative <b>intraocular</b> <b>pressures</b> (27. 1 ± 8. 8 mm Hg vs 19. 7 ± 8. 1 mm Hg; P=. 04) and higher rates of surgical complications (43 % vs 4 %; P=. 001) compared with those who did not. Conclusions: Severe loss of central vision after a trabeculectomy with mitomycin C occurred in 6 % of patients who had glaucoma with marked VF loss. These patients had higher preoperative <b>intraocular</b> <b>pressures</b> and higher rates of surgical complications. Unexplained severe loss of central vision (snuff-out) was rare...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Introduction A case {{of severe}} acute {{bilateral}} angle closure glaucoma with complete visual loss after oral topiramate therapy. Case presentation A 34 year-old woman developed bilateral severe visual loss 2 days after doubling the dosage of topiramate. Her best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was counting fingers in both eyes (OU). <b>Intraocular</b> <b>pressures</b> were 49 mm and 51 mm of Hg in {{right and left}} eyes respectively, with conjunctival chemosis, corneal edema, shallow anterior chamber and closed angles on gonioscopy. B-scan ultrasound revealed annular peripheral choroidal effusions in both eyes. Conclusion <b>Intraocular</b> <b>pressures</b> and anterior chamber depth were normalized after discontinuation of topiramate and initiation of antiglaucoma therapy. Two weeks later, visual acuities improved to 20 / 25 in the right eye and 20 / 40 in the left eye. B-scan ultrasound showed resolution of choroidal effusion. Topiramate, an oral sulpha-derivative medication is known to cause ciliochoroidal effusions, which lead to forward rotation of the ciliary body and displacement of the lens-iris diaphragm, with resultant acute angle closure glaucoma and myopic shift. </p...|$|R
30|$|On 12 November 2013, {{the patient}} returned, {{presenting}} with progressive vision loss in both eyes {{that had begun}} 4  days earlier. The patient’s BCVA was 0.3 in her right eye and 0.2 in her left eye. Ophthalmic examination revealed bullous retinal detachment in both eyes (Figs.  1 and 2, day 12). <b>Intraocular</b> <b>pressures</b> were 10  mmHg (right eye) and 11  mmHg (left eye). However, she continued to refuse treatment. At a subsequent visit on 19 November 2013, she reported visual improvement in both eyes. Ophthalmic examination on that day revealed the disappearance of subretinal fluid from both eyes (Figs.  1 and 2, day 19). Her BCVA was 0.8 in her right eye and 0.9 in her left eye. <b>Intraocular</b> <b>pressures</b> were 19  mmHg (right eye) and 16  mmHg (left eye). On 27 November 2013, she delivered a healthy female baby (gestational age 37  weeks and 5  days, 2294  g) by spontaneous vaginal delivery. The baby’s birth weight was low, but not small for her gestational age. A subsequent examination on 1 April 2014 revealed that the patient’s BCVA was 1.0 in both eyes, and examination of her fundus revealed typical sunset glow fundus, without subretinal fluid (Figs.  1 and 2, day 152). <b>Intraocular</b> <b>pressures</b> were 14  mmHg (right eye) and 10  mmHg (left eye). She exhibited alopecia and poliosis. After reviewing all of the patient’s clinical findings, we diagnosed her with complete VKH. On 11 May 2015, our final meeting with the patient, she did not exhibit any recurrence of VKH. The patient was still receiving 5  mg prednisolone daily for rheumatoid arthritis. Prior to and during her pregnancy, the patient’s blood pressure stayed within normal limits, and she never exhibited hypertension.|$|R
25|$|Vitreolysis is an {{outpatient}} procedure, {{which is much}} less invasive to the eye than a vitrectomy. Side effects may include cataract and <b>intraocular</b> <b>pressure</b> (IOP) spike. It offers a very good degree of patient satisfaction. It can also delay or obviate surgery.|$|E
25|$|In open-angle glaucoma, {{the typical}} {{progression}} from normal vision to complete blindness takes about 25 years to 70 years without treatment, {{depending on the}} method of estimation used.

30|$|Visual acuity was 20 / 80 in {{the right}} eye and hand motion in the left eye. <b>Intraocular</b> <b>pressures</b> were normal. Examination of the right eye was {{unremarkable}} for any acute process. The left eye demonstrated mild conjunctival injection and chemosis, and a 1.5 -mm layered hypopyon. Pigmented debris was noted on the anterior lens capsule. The left fundus revealed moderate vitreous haze, some layered vitreous debris inferiorly and multiple large, white retinal lesions involving the macula. This case was remarkable in that ultrasound revealed a subretinal abscess with vitreous strands and debris.|$|R
30|$|Our {{examination}} revealed a visual acuity of 20 / 30 right eye (OD) and no light {{perception of the}} left eye (OS). The right pupil was reactive to light, but the left pupil was fixed and non-reactive, with a left relative afferent pupillary defect. He had marked restriction of ocular motility of the left eye due to pain. The left upper eyelid was ptotic and edematous. The orbit was slightly tense to retropulsion, but no proptosis was appreciated. The <b>intraocular</b> <b>pressures</b> were 19 mmHg OD and 27 mmHg OS.|$|R
30|$|Finite element {{models of}} the cornea {{that are based on}} {{anatomical}} dimensions were developed.

25|$|The {{mechanism}} of diuresis involves the proximal tubule of the kidney. The enzyme carbonic anhydrase is found here, allowing the reabsorption of bicarbonate, sodium, and chloride. By inhibiting this enzyme, these ions are excreted, along with excess water, lowering blood pressure, intracranial pressure, and <b>intraocular</b> <b>pressure.</b> By excreting bicarbonate, the blood becomes acidic, causing compensatory hyperventilation with deep respiration (Kussmaul respiration), increasing levels of oxygen and decreasing levels {{of carbon dioxide}} in the blood.|$|E
30|$|The {{left eye}} {{meanwhile}} had 20 / 20 uncorrected visual acuity, with a similarly unremarkable anterior segment and lens. The fundus {{of the left}} eye {{was found to have}} an unremarkable posterior pole, having clear media, a cup-disc ratio of 0.3, arterio-venous ratio of 2 : 3, normal course of vessels with no perivascular changes, a normal-looking foveal reflex, and without intraretinal hemorrhages or exudates. A thin ring of feathery, gray-white vitreous material, signed out as benign vitreous condensations/vitreoretinal interface changes, was seen anterior to the equator. <b>Intraocular</b> <b>pressures</b> (IOP) in mmHg were 12 for the right and 13 for the left.|$|R
30|$|A 27 -year-old Caucasian woman {{presented}} with sudden decrease of vision {{in the left}} eye 3 weeks prior.

Initial visual acuities were 20 / 20 OD and 20 / 60 OS falling to 20 / 200 OD and 20 / 60 OS over several weeks. <b>Intraocular</b> <b>pressures</b> were 15 mmHg OD and 14 mmHg OS. Anterior segment findings were within normal limits OU, and no cell or flare was present.|$|R
40|$|The <b>intraocular</b> <b>pressures</b> (IOP) were {{measured}} in both eyes of 25 healthy volunteers in various body positions.
