5000|$|Bone metastases, or metastatic bone disease, is a {{class of}} cancer metastases that results <b>from</b> <b>primary</b> <b>tumor</b> {{invasion}} to bone. Bone-originating primary tumors such as osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, and Ewing's sarcoma are rare. [...] Unlike hematological malignancies that originate in the blood and form non-solid tumors, bone metastases generally arise from epithelial tumors and form a solid mass inside the bone. Bone metastases cause severe pain, characterized by a dull, constant ache with periodic spikes of incident pain.|$|E

Of these, 277 women reached menopause before recurrence of the disease, being lost to follow-up, or reaching the end of the study. In this group, 119 women took HRT to control menopausal symptoms. The majority took combined continuous estrogen-progestin treatment. Times from diagnosis to cancer recurrence or new breast cancer, to death from all causes, and to death <b>from</b> <b>primary</b> <b>tumor</b> were compared between HRT users and non-users. Results: Women who used HRT after their menopause had an adjusted relative risk of recurrence or new breast cancer of 0. 75 (95 % confidence interval (CI), 0. 29 - 1. 95) compared to that of non-users. The relative risk of death from all causes was 0. 36 (95 % CI, 0. 11 - 1. 16) and that of death <b>from</b> <b>primary</b> <b>tumor</b> was 0. 24 (95 % CI, 0. 05 - 1. 14).

Foram {{realizadas}} 38 ressecções (8 pacientes com mais de uma ressecção no mesmo tempo cirúrgico e 2 pacientes submetidos a re-ressecções). Todos haviam sido submetidos previamente a ressecção do tumor primário. Utilizou-se protocolo de rastreamento de metástases hepáticas que incluiu revisões clínicas trimestrais, ecografia abdominal e dosagem de CEA até se completarem 5 anos de seguimento e após, semestralmente. Os fatores prognósticos estudados foram: estágio do tumor primário, tamanho das metástases > 5 cm, intervalo entre ressecção do tumor primário e surgimento da metástase 100 ng/mL, margens cirúrgicas AIM: To {{determine the}} impact of prognostic factors on survival of patients with metastases from colorectal cancer that underwent liver resection. METHODS: The records of 28 patients that underwent liver resection for metastases from colorectal cancer between April 1992 and September 2001 were retrospectively analyzed. Thirty-eight resections were performed (more than one resection in eight patients and two patients underwent re-resections). The primary tumor was resected in all the patients. A screening protocol for liver metastases including clinical examinations every three months, ultrassonography and CEA level until 5 years of follow-up and after every 6 months, was applied. The prognostic factors analyzed regarding the impact on survival were: Dukes C stage of primary tumor, size of metastasis > 5 cm, a disease-free interval <b>from</b> <b>primary</b> <b>tumor</b> to metastasis 100 ng/mL, resection margins < 1 cm and extrahepatic disease.

40|$|For {{quantitative}} microRNA analyses in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue, expression {{levels have}} to be normalized to endogenous controls. To investigate the most stably-expressed microRNAs in breast cancer and its surrounding tissue, we used <b>tumor</b> samples <b>from</b> <b>primary</b> <b>tumors</b> and <b>from</b> metastatic sites. MiRNA profiling using TaqMan® Array Human MicroRNA Cards, enabling quantification of 754 unique human miRNAs, was performed in FFPE specimens from 58 patients with metastatic breast cancer. Forty-two (72 %) samples were collected <b>from</b> <b>primary</b> <b>tumors</b> and 16 (28 %) from metastases. In a cross-platform analysis of a validation cohort of 32 FFPE samples from patients with early breast cancer genome-wide microRNA expression analysis using SurePrintG 3 miRNA (8 × 60 K) ® microarrays from Agilent® was performed. Eleven microRNAs could be detected in all samples analyzed. Based on NormFinder and geNorm stability values and the high correlation (rho ≥ 0. 8) with the median of all measured microRNAs, miR- 16 - 5 p, miR- 29 a- 3 p, miR- 126 - 3 p, and miR- 222 - 3 p are suitable single gene housekeeper candidates. In the cross-platform validation, 29 human microRNAs were strongly expressed (mean log 2 -intensity > 10) and 21 of these microRNAs including miR- 16 - 5 p and miR- 29 a- 3 p were also stably expressed (CV < 5 %). Thus, miR- 16 - 5 p and miR- 29 a- 3 p are both strong housekeeper candidates.
