5|$|Mrs. Tittlemouse {{actually}} made her debut in 1909 in Potter's The Tale of The Flopsy Bunnies where she rescued the six children of Benjamin and Flopsy Bunny from Mr. McGregor's <b>grasp</b> <b>and</b> was rewarded for her heroism with {{a quantity of}} rabbit wool at Christmas. In the last illustration, {{she is wearing a}} cloak and hood, and a muff and mittens fashioned from the wool. Mrs. Tittlemouse is a key (not a central) character in the tale, but a character incompletely personified, and one whose story Potter chose to develop in 1910.|$|E
5|$|Carrion, fungi, fruits such as chokecherry (Prunus virginiana), {{and seeds}} are also eaten. Two grey jays were seen eating slime mold (Fuligo septica) near Kennedy Hot Springs in the Glacier Peak Wilderness, Washington. This {{was the first}} report of any bird {{consuming}} slime mold in the field. Risk and energy expenditure are factors in food selection for the grey jay, which selects food {{on the basis of}} profitability to maximize caloric intake. Increased handling, searching, or recognition times for a preferred food item lowers its profitability. Grey jays wrench, twist, and tug food apart, unlike other birds known as jays (such as the blue jay, Cyanocitta cristata), which <b>grasp</b> <b>and</b> hammer their food. Grey jays commonly carry large food items to nearby trees to eat or process for storage, possibly as defense against large scavengers.|$|E
5|$|The African {{elephant}} has two finger-like extensions {{at the tip}} of {{the trunk}} that allow it to <b>grasp</b> <b>and</b> bring food to its mouth. The Asian elephant has only one, and relies more on wrapping around a food item and squeezing it into its mouth. Asian elephants have more muscle coordination and can perform more complex tasks. Losing the trunk would be detrimental to an elephant's survival, although in rare cases, individuals have survived with shortened ones. One elephant has been observed to graze by kneeling on its front legs, raising on its hind legs and taking in grass with its lips. Floppy trunk syndrome is a condition of trunk paralysis in African bush elephants caused by the degradation of the peripheral nerves and muscles beginning at the tip.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an integrated system for dextrous manipulation using a Utah-MIT hand that {{allows one to}} look at the higher levels of control in a number of <b>grasping</b> <b>and</b> manipulation tasks. The system consists of a number of low-level system primitives for <b>grasping,</b> integrated hand <b>and</b> robotic arm movement, tactile sensors mounted on the fingertips, sensing primitives to utilize joint position, tendon force and tactile array feedback, and a high-level programming environment that allows task level scripts to be created for <b>grasping</b> <b>and</b> manipulation tasks.

5|$|The first Mortal Kombat game {{takes place}} in Earthrealm (Earth) where seven {{different}} warriors with their own reasons for entering participated in the tournament with the eventual prize being the continued freedom of their realm, threatened with a takeover by Outworld. Among the established warriors were Liu Kang, Johnny Cage and Sonya Blade. With {{the help of the}} thunder god Raiden, the Earthrealm warriors were victorious and Liu Kang became the new champion of Mortal Kombat. In Mortal Kombat II, unable to deal with his minion Shang Tsung's failure, Outworld Emperor Shao Kahn lures the Earthrealm warriors to the Outworld where the Earthrealm warriors eventually defeat Shao Kahn. By the time of Mortal Kombat 3, Shao Kahn revives Edenia's (now a part of his Outworld domain) former queen Sindel in Earthrealm, combining it with Outworld as well. He then attempts to invade Earthrealm but is ultimately defeated by the Earthrealm warriors again. After Kahn's defeat, Edenia was freed from Kahn's <b>grasp</b> <b>and</b> returned to a peaceful realm, ruled by Princess Kitana. The following game, Mortal Kombat 4, features the former elder god Shinnok attempting to conquer the realms and attempting to kill the thunder god Raiden. However, he is also defeated by the Earthrealm warriors.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This paper {{considers}} <b>grasps</b> <b>and</b> fixtures whose contacts react {{according to}} force-displacement laws consistent with friction constrains at the contacts. The passive force closure set of such <b>grasps</b> <b>and</b> fixtures is {{the set of}} external wrenches (forces and torques) that can act on the <b>grasped</b> object <b>and</b> be stably balanced by the contacts. An external wrench belongs to this set if it induces a feasible equilibrium whose basin of attraction contains the initial unperturbed grasp configuration. The paper focuses on planar <b>grasps</b> <b>and</b> fixtures hav-ing sharp-tipped fingers or fixels that satisfy linear force displacement laws. Using Morse Theory, the paper characterizes the number and stability type of k-contact equilibria induced by a given external wrench. Based on this analysis, the paper provides closed-form expres-sions for the passive force closure set of k-contact <b>grasps</b> <b>and</b> fixtures. Computation of the allowed external wrenches is illustrated with examples. Finally, the paper describes experi-ments verifying the passive force closure set on a spring-loaded grasping system. ...|$|R

25|$|In the 1950s, {{understanding}} of the tenodesis effect (See Tenodesis grasp) inﬂuenced the development of surgical techniques such as the static ﬂexor tenodesis. These procedures provided the basic functions of <b>grasp</b> <b>and</b> pinch. Tendon transfers were developed to accomplish both digital release and gripping functions in two surgical stages. The originators of these procedures were Lipscomb et al. , Zancolli, House et al. House et al. contributed important clinical investigations while showing the value of different surgical procedures.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIt {{is still}} unclear whether infants become {{right-handed}} because of their left-hemisphere specialization for language (through gestural communication for instance), whether they speak predominantly with their left hemisphere because of this hemisphere's superiority in controlling sequential actions which first results in right-handedness, or whether the two lateralization processes develop independently. To tackle this question, we followed 26 human infants from 8 to 20 months to evaluate the temporal relationship between the emergence of hand preference for <b>grasping</b> objects <b>and</b> for declarative pointing (communicative gesture). Our results show that when <b>grasping</b> <b>and</b> pointing are compared in similar conditions, with objects presented in several spatial positions, the tendency to use the right hand is significantly larger for pointing than for <b>grasping,</b> <b>and</b> both hand preferences are loosely correlated. This suggests that, {{at least at the}} age studied here, hand preferences for <b>grasping</b> <b>and</b> for declarative pointing develop relatively independently...|$|R

25|$|Australian {{historian}} Les Carlyon {{wrote that}} while Haig {{was slow to}} adapt to the correct use of artillery in sufficient quantities to support infantry attacks and was generally sceptical that the science of such doctrine had much place in military theory, he was fully supportive of excellent corps and field commanders such as Herbert Plumer, Arthur Currie and John Monash, who seem to best <b>grasp</b> <b>and</b> exercise these concepts, especially later in the war. Carlyon also wrote out that there was a case to answer, for his support of more dubious commanders such as Ian Hamilton, Aylmer Hunter-Weston and Hubert Gough.|$|E
25|$|Spasticity, if present, {{can be very}} important. It is not a {{contraindication}} per se, but severe spasticity must {{be treated}} first depending in which muscle groups it is present. Spascticity can be treated with botox or myotomies. In some cases spastic tone can be useful to facilitate hand <b>grasp</b> <b>and</b> grip. Harmful spasticity that does not respond to medication or surgical treatment is a contraindication. The shoulder muscles, pectoralis major and latissimus dorsi, must be evaluated. The shoulder must not only have good motor condition but also good proprioceptive control. The trophicity and articular condition of the upper limb must also be considered. A poor condition requires a preoperative rehabilitation program.|$|E

25|$|Though {{capable of}} sprinting, the cougar is {{typically}} an ambush predator. It stalks through brush and trees, across ledges, or other covered spots, before delivering a powerful leap {{onto the back}} of its prey and a suffocating neck bite. The cougar is capable of breaking the neck of some of its smaller prey with a strong bite and momentum bearing the animal to the ground. The head of the cat is round and the ears are erect. Its powerful forequarters, neck, and jaw serve to <b>grasp</b> <b>and</b> hold large prey. It has five retractable claws on its forepaws (one a dewclaw) and four on its hind paws. The larger front feet and claws are adaptations to clutching prey.|$|E
25|$|Ponting's tour started well, {{scoring a}} half-century {{in the second}} tour match and a century in the opening Test. However, his {{performances}} diminished as his team began to struggle against an experienced Indian outfit. He managed only one other half-century for the series, totaling 266 runs {{at an average of}} 38, dropping his overall Test average to 57.58. In the final Test in Nagpur—in which Australia needed victory to level the series—Ponting was criticized for bowling part-time spin bowlers in an effort to increase the over rate, to avoid suspension and a fine. When the fast bowlers were re-introduced, the match was beyond Australia's <b>grasp</b> <b>and</b> India were eventual victors. These tactics were severely criticised in Australia.|$|E
25|$|Glasgow police {{decided to}} use the {{occasion}} of the public address to effect the arrest. However, the WSPU activists anticipated their action and increased security coverage for their leader, including enforcing strict secrecy surrounding her movements and erecting a concealed barbed wire barrier across the front of the stage. A short time into Pankhurst's speech, around 160 police officers stormed the hall and began to move toward the stage. They were met by a barrage of thrown chairs and plant pots, and soon fights broke out between the police and members of the audience. During the commotion one of the women present drew a revolver and fired several blank cartridges toward the ceiling. The police attempted to apprehend her, but she managed to slip their <b>grasp</b> <b>and</b> escape. Although not positively identified at the time, many since have stated that Janie Allan was the woman with the revolver.|$|E
