500|$|Welling {{was cast}} in the WB superhero drama Smallville after a {{nationwide}} search for an actor to play Clark Kent. In {{an interview with a}} teen magazine, Welling spoke about the day he auditioned for the role: [...] "I was on my way back from the Warner Bros. studio, and <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>in</b> a gas station to call my manager and tell him how it went. I called and got him on the phone and he said, 'Can you hold on a second?' Next thing I know, there are literally seven people on the other line and almost in unison they say, 'Tom, you got it!'" [...] The pilot aired in October 2001 and became the highest rated debut for The WB, with 8.4 million viewers. Welling told TV Guide that he turned down the lead role twice, but after reading the script, decided to take the job. Like Christopher Reeve, he was not a Superman fan prior to being cast as Clark Kent. In fact, he said, he continues to not read Superman comics: [...] "I made a conscious decision to stay away from that material. We're doing something different at a time before all that, I don't want that to affect what I'm doing, even subconsciously." [...] He did get the chance to meet two previous Superman actors: Christopher Reeve, who appeared in season 2: episode 17 titled [...] "Rosetta", and Dean Cain, who appeared in season 7: episode 4 titled [...] "Cure".|$|E

60|$|Do {{you think}} I have an empty life? {{or that a}} man jogging to his club has so much to {{interest}} and amuse him?--touch and try him too, but {{that goes along with}} the others: no pain, no pleasure, is the iron law.

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>in</b> irrepressible astonishment. We {{had walked}} {{by this time}} nearly as far {{on the way back}} to the city as the old Palace of Holyrood.

60|$|At lunch-time <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>in</b> {{at a large}} dry-goods {{store to}} attend to my wife's commission.

6000|$|One word, however, I {{caught at}} last {{from all this}} jargon, and that often {{repeated}} with a little bow to me, and an uneasy smile on his white face--"Mishrush, Mishrush!"

60|$|I {{was running}} on, very fast indeed, when my eyes rested on little Em'ly's face, which was bent forward over the table, {{listening}} with the deepest attention, her breath held, {{her blue eyes}} sparkling like jewels, and the colour mantling in her cheeks. She looked so extraordinarily earnest and pretty, that <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>in</b> a sort of wonder; and they all observed her at the same time, for as I stopped, they laughed and looked at her.|$|E
