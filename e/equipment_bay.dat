5|$|Following {{the third}} prototype, several design {{improvements}} were developed and incorporated into further aircraft. Because of excessive smoke emissions by the RD-93 engine, the air intakes were widened. Reported control problems found in testing resulted in alterations to the wing leading edge root extensions (LERX). The vertical tail fin was enlarged to house an expanded electronic warfare <b>equipment</b> <b>bay</b> in the tip. The redesigned aircraft had a slightly increased {{maximum take-off weight}} and incorporated an increased quantity of Chinese-sourced avionics; however PAF had selected Western avionics for their aircraft, postponing PAF deliveries from late 2005 until 2007. Pakistan evaluated British, French, and Italian avionics suites, the winner of which {{was expected to be}} finalised in 2006. PT-04, the fourth prototype and the first to incorporate the design changes, was rolled out in April 2006 and made its first flight on 28 April 2006.|$|E
5|$|The mission's second spacewalk officially {{began at}} 12:49 UTC, and the pair {{set to work}} {{removing}} and replacing the telescope's three gyroscope rate sensing units (RSUs). Each unit contains two gyroscopes that allow the telescope to point itself. The first unit, RSU 2, was replaced without problems, but when they attempted to replace the second unit, RSU 3, the unit would not align onto the guide pins, and they could not seat it into the <b>equipment</b> <b>bay.</b> Managers decided to put the unit originally intended for the RSU 1 bay into the RSU 3 bay, and it was installed without problems. The pair then attempted to install the second unit into {{the third and final}} bay, but the unit again would not seat properly, and they were unable to install it. Instead, it was decided that an additional unit carried as a spare would be placed into the final bay. The spare unit was one that was removed during the STS-103 mission, and had been refurbished on the ground. The installation of all three gyro units was a critical objective of the servicing mission, as three had failed, one was offline due to electrical issues, and the other two had also been experiencing issues with performance. Ground controllers at Goddard Space Flight Center confirmed that all six gyroscopes and the new battery passed preliminary tests.|$|E
25|$|The Command Module had two DSKYs {{connected}} to its AGC: one {{located on the}} main instrument panel and a second located in the lower <b>equipment</b> <b>bay</b> near a sextant used for aligning the inertial guidance platform. The Lunar Module had a single DSKY for its AGC. A flight director attitude indicator (FDAI), controlled by the AGC, was located above the DSKY on the commander's console and on the LM.|$|E

25|$|Strowger-based, {{step-by-step}} {{offices in}} the Bell System required continuous maintenance, such as cleaning. Indicator lights on <b>equipment</b> <b>bays</b> in step offices alerted staff to conditions such as blown fuses (usually white lamps) or a permanent signal (stuck off-hook condition, usually green indicators). Step offices were more susceptible to single-point failures than newer technologies.|$|R

A single-story addition extends to the south, adding several more <b>equipment</b> <b>bays.</b>|$|R
25|$|Salyut 1 was {{launched}} 19 April 1971; initial failures of on-board {{fans and the}} scientific <b>equipment</b> <b>bay</b> were not considered a major problem. The crew of Soyuz 10, launched four days later, docked with the stations, but failed to lock the docking gasket firmly. They {{did not have enough}} fuel for a second docking and a safe return, nor the spacesuits for an EV transfer, and the mission controller aborted the flight. For the first time in Soviet space program, Soyuz 10 landed at night.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first two}} Lunar Modules to fly, Apollo 5 and Apollo 9, also carried {{a pair of}} VHF scimitar antennas for the {{transmission}} of Developmental Flight Instrumentation (DFI) telemetry data. [...] One was located on the front face, just inboard of the right-hand side cockpit window, {{and the other was}} located {{on the left side of}} the aft <b>equipment</b> <b>bay.</b> [...] Since the Lunar Module never operated in the Earth's atmosphere, no aerodynamic covering was necessary, and the scimitar shape was externally visible. [...] After Apollo 9, the Lunar Module was considered operational, so the DFI and scimitar antennas were not present on subsequent flights.|$|E
50|$|The {{upper surface}} skin, exposed to much lower temperatures, {{was made of}} {{aluminium}} honeycomb panels that could be removed to allow access to the unpressurised <b>equipment</b> <b>bays</b> between the frames.
