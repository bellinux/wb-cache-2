5|$|Inertial {{confinement}} fusionis one of {{two major}} lines of <b>fusion</b> <b>power</b> development, the other being magnetic confinement fusion (MCF), notably the tokamak concept which is being built in a major experimental system known as ITER. Magnetic confinement is widely {{considered to be the}} superior approach, and has seen significantly greater development activity over the decades. However, there are serious concerns that the MCF approach of ITER cannot ever become economically practical.|$|E
5|$|Research {{institutions}} in Germany include the Max Planck Society, the Helmholtz Association and the Fraunhofer Society. The Wendelstein 7-X in Greifswald hosts a {{facility in the}} research of <b>fusion</b> <b>power</b> for instance. The Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize is granted to ten scientists and academics every year. With a maximum of €2.5million per award {{it is one of}} highest endowed research prizes in the world.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen is not {{an energy}} resource, except in the {{hypothetical}} context of commercial nuclear <b>fusion</b> <b>power</b> plants using deuterium or tritium, a technology presently far from development. The Sun's energy comes from nuclear fusion of hydrogen, but this process is difficult to achieve controllably on Earth. Elemental hydrogen from solar, biological, or electrical sources requires more energy to make than is obtained by burning it, so in these cases hydrogen functions as an energy carrier, like a battery. Hydrogen may be obtained from fossil sources (such as methane), but these sources are unsustainable.|$|E

5|$|Moving towards {{sustainability}} is also {{a social}} challenge that entails international and national law, urban planning and transport, local and individual lifestyles and ethical consumerism. Ways of living more sustainably can take many forms from reorganizing living conditions (e.g., ecovillages, eco-municipalities and sustainable cities), reappraising economic sectors (permaculture, green building, sustainable agriculture), or work practices (sustainable architecture), using science to develop new technologies (green technologies, renewable energy and sustainable fission and <b>fusion</b> <b>power),</b> or designing systems in a flexible and reversible manner, and adjusting individual lifestyles that conserve natural resources.|$|E
5|$|Under Cockcroft's direction, AERE {{took part}} in {{frontier}} fusion research in the post-war years, including the ZETA program. Sir George Paget Thomson began research in nuclear fusion at Imperial College London in 1946. This was subsequently transferred to the Associated Electrical Industries Laboratory at Aldermaston, under Allibone's direction. Research independently began at Oxford University under Peter Thonemann. In 1951, Cockcroft arranged for the Oxford group {{to be transferred to}} Harwell. Cockcroft approved the construction of ZETA (Zero Energy Thermonuclear Assembly) by the Thonemann's Harwell group, and the smaller Sceptre by Allibone's AEI group. James L. Tuck's group at the Los Alamos Laboratory was also researching fusion, and Cockcroft struck an agreement with the Americans that they would release their results together, which was done in 1958. Despite Cockcroft's perennial optimism that a breakthrough was imminent, <b>fusion</b> <b>power</b> remained an elusive goal.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, JET {{produced}} {{a peak of}} 16.1MW of <b>fusion</b> <b>power</b> (65% of heat to plasma), with <b>fusion</b> <b>power</b> of over 10MW sustained for over 0.5sec. Its successor, the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), was officially announced {{as part of a}} seven-party consortium (six countries and the EU). ITER is designed to produce ten times more <b>fusion</b> <b>power</b> than the power put into the plasma. ITER is currently under construction in Cadarache, France.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fusion</b> <b>powered</b> {{electricity}} generation was initially {{believed to be}} readily achievable, as fission-electric power had been.

50|$|Solar neutrinos {{originate}} from the nuclear <b>fusion</b> <b>powering</b> the Sun and other stars.The {{details of the}} operation of the Sun are explained by the Standard Solar Model. In short: when four protons fuse to become one helium nucleus, two of them have to convert into neutrons, and each such conversion releases one electron neutrino.|$|R

25|$|Construction of the ITER {{facility}} {{began in}} 2007, but {{the project has}} run into many delays and budget overruns. The facility is now not expected to begin operations until the year 2027 – 11 years after initially anticipated.

50|$|He {{then worked}} for about 20 years at UK Atomic Energy Authority's Culham Laboratory on nuclear fusion, on the JET and RFX nuclear {{research}} projects.

5000|$|<b>Fusion</b> of <b>powers</b> is {{a feature}} of some {{parliamentary}} democracies, especially those following the Westminster system, where the executive and legislative branches of government are intermingled.

50|$|The basic {{understanding}} of nuclear fusion was developed using the then-new field of quantum mechanics. A key advance was George Gamow's 1928 demonstration of fusion's theoretical basis.

Several fusion reactors have been built, but only recently reactors {{have been able to}} release more energy than the amount of energy used in the process. Despite research having started in the 1950s, no commercial fusion reactor is expected before 2050. The ITER project is currently leading the effort to harness <b>fusion</b> <b>power.</b>|$|E

25|$|In {{the case}} of an {{accident}} (or sabotage), it is expected that a fusion reactor would release far less radioactive pollution than would an ordinary fission nuclear station. Furthermore, ITER's type of <b>fusion</b> <b>power</b> has little in common with nuclear weapons technology, and does not produce the fissile materials necessary {{for the construction of a}} weapon. Proponents note that large-scale <b>fusion</b> <b>power</b> would be able to produce reliable electricity on demand, and with virtually zero pollution (no gaseous CO2, SO2, or NOx by-products are produced).|$|E
25|$|Although <b>fusion</b> <b>power</b> uses nuclear technology, {{the overlap}} {{with nuclear weapons}} would be limited. A huge amount of tritium could be {{produced}} by a <b>fusion</b> <b>power</b> station; tritium {{is used in the}} trigger of hydrogen bombs and in a modern boosted fission weapon, {{but it can also be}} produced by nuclear fission. The energetic neutrons from a fusion reactor could be used to breed weapons-grade plutonium or uranium for an atomic bomb (for example by transmutation of U238 to Pu239, or Th232 to U233).|$|E

25|$|<b>Fusion</b> <b>powers</b> {{stars and}} {{produces}} virtually all {{elements in a}} process called nucleosynthesis. The Sun is a main-sequence star, and, as such, generates its energy by nuclear fusion of hydrogen nuclei into helium. In its core, the Sun fuses 620 million metric tons of hydrogen and makes 606 million metric tons of helium each second. The fusion of lighter elements in stars releases energy and the mass that always accompanies it. For example, in the fusion of two hydrogen nuclei to form helium, 0.7% of the mass is carried away {{in the form of}} kinetic energy of an alpha particle or other forms of energy, such as electromagnetic radiation.|$|R
