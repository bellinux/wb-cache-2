I never heard anyone say it and did not even ask myself what it meant...I happened to read in an encyclopedia that it is a tropical tree resembling the Ceiba.|$|E
25|$|Heirens's lawyers {{pressured}} {{him to take}} Tuohy's plea bargain. That deal, {{which was}} the topic of that closed-door meeting with Tuohy, stated that Heirens would serve one life sentence if he confessed to the murders of Josephine Ross, Frances Brown, and Suzanne Degnan. With {{the help of his}} lawyers, he began drafting a confession using the Chicago Tribune article as a guide:As it turned out, the Tribune article was very helpful, as it provided me with a lot of details I didn't know. My attorneys rarely changed anything outright, but I could tell by their faces if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> a mistake. Or they would say, 'Now, Bill, is that really the way it happened?' Then I would change my story because, obviously, it went against what was known (in the Tribune).|$|E
500|$|It {{is a very}} {{important}} film, Life, and Nothing More..., in that what was filmed was inspired by a journey <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> just three days after an earthquake. And I speak not only of the film itself but also of the experience of being in that place, where only three days before 50,000 people had died. For the survivors, {{it was as if they}} were reborn, having experienced death around them. The earthquake had happened at four or five in the morning, so in a sense everybody could have been dead and it was almost accidental that they hadn't died. So I didn't just see myself as a film director here, but also as an observer of people who had been condemned to death. So this was a very big influence on me, and the issue of life and death from then on does recur in my films[...]|$|E

500|$|Morgan's {{individual}} {{event was}} the 400-metre freestyle. She reduced her personal best by 2.3 seconds in recording {{a time of}} 5 minutes 7.8 seconds in the heats, just 0.2 of a second behind Marley Shriver of the United States, who set a new Olympic record. The mark was surpassed in later heats by Fraser and Crapp, but Morgan nevertheless qualified fourth fastest for the final, almost seven seconds faster than the cutoff. The final was held {{the day after the}} relay final. Morgan was unable to repeat her heat performance, finishing sixth in a time of 5 minutes 14.3 seconds, far outside her personal best. Had she repeated her heat swim, she would have placed fourth, just 0.7 of a second from the bronze medal. Nevertheless, she noted that [...] "I was so happy that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> the final in an individual event in the Olympic Games, for this was my first appearance in a senior competition".|$|E

So I guess I thought if someone's going to do it might as well be me. The story line [...] is about an interracial couple. It's sort of Romeo and Juliet but it's set in the '60s and they're kind of torn apart. It's about their struggle and I'm sort of the narrator. I don't want to give too much away about it, but it's nice. Something I could relate to, being the product of an interracial union, though [...] did not wind up happily ever after standing in church together.|$|E
500|$|Prost won {{the first}} two Grands Prix of the 1982 season in South Africa, where Prost {{recovered}} from losing a wheel, and Brazil, where he finished 3rd but was awarded the win after Piquet (1st) and Keke Rosberg (2nd) were disqualified. He finished in the points on four other occasions, but did not win again. Despite retiring from seven races, Prost improved on his Drivers' Championship position, finishing in fourth, but with nine fewer points than the previous year. His relationship with Arnoux deteriorated further after the French Grand Prix. Prost believes that Arnoux, who won the race, went back on a pre-race agreement to support Prost during the race. His relationship with the French media was also poor. He has since commented that [...] "When I went to Renault the journalists wrote good things about me, but by 1982 I had become the bad guy. I think, to be honest, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> the mistake of winning! The French don't really like winners." ...|$|E

500|$|Goldman's {{circle of}} radicals, socialists, and bohemians was joined in 1912 by a nurse, Margaret Sanger, whose {{mother had been}} through 18 pregnancies in 22 years, and died at age 50 of {{tuberculosis}} and cervical cancer.Engelman, pp. 29–30 (Goldman circle).Cox, p. 4 (pregnancies).Buchanan, p. 121 (tuberculosis and cancer).Chelsler, p. 41 (age 50). In 1913, Sanger worked in New York's Lower East Side, often with poor women who were suffering due to frequent childbirth and self-induced abortions.Kennedy, pp. 16–18. After one particularly tragic medical case, Sanger wrote: [...] "I threw my nursing bag {{in the corner and}} announced... that I would never take another case until <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> it possible for working women in America to have the knowledge to control birth." [...] Sanger visited public libraries, searching for information on contraception, but nothing was available.Cronin, Mary (1996), [...] "The Woman Rebel", in Women's periodicals in the United States: social and political issues, Endres, Kathleen L. (Ed.), Greenwood Press, p. 448.Cronin cites Sanger, An Autobiography, pp. 95–96.Cronin cites Kennedy, p. 19, who points out that some materials on birth control were available in 1913. She became outraged that working-class women could not obtain contraception, yet upper-class women who had access to private physicians could.|$|E
500|$|The {{intensity}} which Rice {{looked for}} in the track was not immediately achieved during recording, {{because it is a}} sentimental ballad and because of its lyrics. As the delivery date of the recording approached, they got more tense since most of the album was put together. Only this song was left as they could not decide on the final title, and Rice tried out names which did not make sense within the political and dramatic atmosphere of the story. They had initially tried out various lyrics as the main hook and title of the song including [...] "It's Only Your Lover Returning" [...] and [...] "All Through My Crazy and Wild Days" [...] amid fears that mentioning Argentina would reduce the commercial appeal. Rice recalled, [...] "What a crass decision! It was probably the only time (honest) that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> the mistake of caring more abort a lyric's potential outside the show than its importance within it, and as a result both song and show suffered." [...] Covington had already recorded the phrase [...] "Don't Cry for Me Argentina" [...] for using it {{in the beginning of the}} show. Shortly before the album was finally mixed, Lloyd Webber suggested to Rice that the line also worked as the title of Eva's speech. As soon as Covington recorded with the new name, the song fit [...] "perfectly" [...] in the mood of the sequence and was included in the album.|$|E
500|$|The {{severity}} of the destructive acts by Union troops was significantly greater in South Carolina than in Georgia or North Carolina. This {{appears to have been}} a consequence of the animosity among both Union soldiers and officers to the state that they regarded as the [...] "cockpit of secession". One of the most serious accusations against Sherman was that he allowed his troops to burn the city of Columbia. In 1867, Gen. O. O. Howard, commander of Sherman's 15th Corps, reportedly said, [...] "It is useless to deny that our troops burnt Columbia, for I saw them in the act." [...] However, Sherman himself stated that [...] "f <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> up my mind to burn Columbia I would have burnt it with no more feeling than I would a common prairie dog village; but I did not do it ..." [...] Sherman's official report on the burning placed the blame on Confederate Lt. Gen. Wade Hampton III, who Sherman said had ordered the burning of cotton in the streets. In his memoirs, Sherman said, [...] "In my official report of this conflagration I distinctly charged it to General Wade Hampton, and confess I did so pointedly to shake the faith of his people in him, for he was in my opinion a braggart and professed to be the special champion of South Carolina."

500|$|The {{majority}} of backing tracks {{on the first}} three sides of the album were recorded at I.D. Sound Studios, Los Angeles, engineered by James Lowe with assistance from John Lee. The studio {{was one of the}} first independent units in LA, and Lowe believes Rundgren chose it due to the ability to work hands-on without record company interference and having all the latest technology and equipment. Rundgren played every instrument in turn, starting with the drums, noting it [...] "was the logical place to start," [...] with the others individually laid down on top. While recording the drums, Rundgren would try and hum the song in his head to remember where he was, but [...] "if I would screw up, then I would change the song afterwards, to fit the mistake that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>made,</b> because it was easier than going back and fixing it." [...] In retrospect, Rundgren felt he might have performed better with a click track, being a novice drummer at the time, but concluded that the end result [...] "sound like a band". He didn't think his lack of technical proficiency on the instrument was a particular handicap, saying that [...] "people comprehend what you're playing, and it has a greater impact." [...] Engineering the album, Lowe recalled he was [...] "mostly working in the dark", and that Rundgren would leave spaces for instruments during recording, spontaneously developing a song as it was being recorded. [...] "I was never sure exactly where the song was going until we'd put down about four or five tracks." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{town meeting}} {{attracted}} a packed crowd of over a thousand, with Nixon supporters distributing anti-Voorhis literature at the door. The Senate proxies spoke first for their candidates, followed by Voorhis. Nixon, who had notified organizers {{that he would}} be late due to another commitment, arrived during Voorhis's speech, and remained backstage until the congressman had completed his talk. He then came onstage, shook hands with Voorhis, and delivered a fifteen-minute address. A question-and-answer period then followed, with a Nixon supporter asking Voorhis about his onetime Socialist registration, and about his views on monetary policy. [...] After the representative responded, a Voorhis supporter asked Nixon why he was making [...] "false charges" [...] about the supposed Voorhis CIO-PAC endorsement. [...] In response, Nixon reached into his pocket and pulled out a copy of a Southern California NCPAC bulletin mentioning the group's endorsement of Voorhis. [...] The congressman was unaware of the endorsement; those of his aides in the know had [...] "completely forgotten" [...] to tell him. [...] Nixon walked halfway across the stage and displayed it to Voorhis, asking him to read it for himself. Voorhis came from his seat and took it, and (according to Bullock, who served as timekeeper at the debate) [...] "mumbled" [...] that this seemed to be a different organization from the CIO-PAC. [...] Nixon reclaimed the document, and began to read out names {{of the members of the}} boards of directors of the two groups, [...] "It's the same thing, virtually, when they have the same directors." [...] The crowd began to cheer Nixon, who later wrote, [...] "I could tell by the audience reaction that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> my point", and to jeer Voorhis, who wrote, [...] "They'd boo and laugh at my remarks, and this disturbed me." ...|$|E

[...] I ran as fast as I could diagonally across the field, realizing that I was hotly pursued. [...] At last I was tackled on what I afterwards learned was about the six-yard line. [...] I was slightly dazed by the fall, but saw a goal post ahead of me and managed to crawl over the line.

Regardless, German soldiers regularly raped young Herero women before killing them or letting them die in the desert.
