5|$|From the {{examples}} of her mother, Aunt Sally, and a neighbor neglected by her husband and left destitute, Stone early learned that women were {{at the mercy of}} their husbands’ good will.

Resolving to “call no man my master,” she determined to keep control over <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>life</b> by never marrying, obtaining the highest education she could, and earning her own livelihood.|$|E

5|$|Still {{the subject}} of {{speculation}} and opprobrium in 1998, Hughes published Birthday Letters that year, his own collection of 88 poems {{about his relationship with}} Plath.
