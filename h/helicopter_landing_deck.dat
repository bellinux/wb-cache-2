25|$|Purse seiners {{are very}} {{effective}} at targeting aggregating pelagic species near the surface. The seiner circles the shoal {{with a deep}} curtain of netting, possibly using bow thrusters for better manoeuvrability. Then {{the bottom of the}} net is pursed (closed) underneath the fish shoal by hauling a wire running from the vessel through rings along the bottom of the net and then back to the vessel. The {{most important part of the}} fishing operation is searching for the fish shoals and assessing their size and direction of movement. Sophisticated electronics, such as echosounders, sonar, and track plotters, may be used are used to search for and track schools; assessing their size and movement and keeping in touch with the school while it is surrounded with the seine net. Crows nests may be built on the masts for further visual support. Large vessels can have observation towers and <b>helicopter</b> <b>landing</b> <b>decks.</b> <b>Helicopters</b> and spotter planes are used for detecting fish schools. The main types of purse seiners are the American seiners, the European seiners and the Drum seiners.|$|R

50|$|A 1937 law gave {{control of}} all {{national}} fixed-wing air assets to the Italian Air Force and the navy was only permitted to operate helicopters. At {{the time of the}} ship's commissioning the Garibaldi the Italian Navy Aviation did not receive her Harriers so she was reclassified as an Incrociatore portaeromobili (Italian for Aircraft carrying cruiser). Until 1988 only Italian <b>helicopters</b> <b>landed</b> on her <b>deck,</b> as well as Royal Navy Sea Harriers during NATO joint maneuvers. The ban on fixed-wing aircraft was lifted in 1989, and the Italian Navy acquired Harrier II fighters to fly from the Giuseppe Garibaldi.|$|R
50|$|She opened 1979 moored at pierside in {{her home}} port. Late in January, Blakely resumed {{operations}} with the 2d Fleet. For the next five months, she put to sea repeatedly—usually to participate in <b>helicopter</b> <b>deck</b> <b>landing</b> qualifications but also to conduct naval gunfire support training and other single-ship exercises. On 29 May, the frigate departed Charleston for Boston, Mass. She arrived at her destination on 31 May; and, the following day, Boston became her new home port. On 4 June, the warship entered the drydock for a repair and modification period. On 4 October, {{she came out of}} the dock but remained in Boston well into 1980 completing repairs.|$|R
50|$|Amphibious {{transport}} docks {{perform the}} mission of amphibious transports, amphibious cargo ships, and the older LSDs by incorporating both a flight deck and a well deck that can be ballasted and deballasted to support landing craft or amphibious vehicles.

50|$|The Batrals can ferry over 400 tons of matériel, in {{the hangar}} {{and on the}} deck. Loading and {{unloading}} can be done from a harbour or on a beach. Two flat-bottom vessels allow unloading fifty men and light vehicles each. The accommodations are designed for a Guépard-type intervention unit (five officers, fifteen petty officers and 118 men), or for typical company-sized armoured units.

5000|$|The ships {{could carry}} 160,000 barrels (2,544,000 litres) of fuel oil, 600 tons of munitions, 200 tons of dry stores and 100 tons of {{refrigerated}} stores. To transfer cargo, the ships were equipped with four oiling stations and two cargo handing stations {{on the port}} side and three oiling stations and two cargo handing stations on the starboard side. Originally, the first six ships only had a large <b>helicopter</b> <b>landing</b> <b>deck</b> aft, but no hangar. [...] was the first ship equipped with a large double hangar for two UH-46 Sea Knight helicopters. The hangar was later retrofitted to the other ships.|$|E
50|$|Following an {{extended}} fitting-out period at the Charleston Naval Shipyard and a restricted availability at Jacksonville Shipyard for correction of minor construction faults, W. S. Sims became fully operational in June 1970, {{and proceeded to}} Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for shakedown training. After a two and one-half month post-shakedown availability at the Charleston Naval Shipyard to correct deficiencies uncovered during shakedown and to install additional equipment, W. S. Sims was put to sea in November to evaluate the feasibility of installing the light airborne multi-purpose system (LAMPS). She was the first ship of her class to have a manned <b>helicopter</b> <b>land</b> on her <b>deck</b> and, during the next four days, she successfully demonstrated the capability of these new ships to operate manned helicopters. Upon completion of the testing, the escort proceeded to her home port, Mayport, Florida, for the holiday season.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{an investigation that}} has used piloted flight simulation to assess pilot workload while manoeuvring a <b>helicopter</b> over the <b>landing</b> <b>decks</b> of three different size, but similar, ships. Three generic ships with lengths of 100 m, 150 m and 200 m were created to {{be representative of the}} range of size of single-spot ships that operate with maritime helicopters. Ship airwakes were produced using unsteady CFD simulations for a range of free stream wind speeds from 20 knots to 50 knots for a headwind and Green 45 ° Wind Over Deck. To reduce the numbers of expensive and computationally intensive airwakes that have to be produced for simulated deck landings it has been demonstrated that for a given wind angle it is possible to Strouhal-scale the airwake velocities from one representative wind strength to other wind strengths, and from one ship size to another ship size with accuracies which are considered acceptable for their implementation within a flight simulator. Simulated <b>deck</b> <b>landing</b> trials {{for each of the three}} ships were used to provide subjective pilot workload ratings. It was found that the pilot workload generally increases with the ship size and that, despite the landing area being larger and the superstructure proximity being less threatening, the more aggressive airwake from the larger ship still makes the aircraft more difficult to control over the larger ship...|$|R
500|$|Good Hope and {{her sisters}} Natal and [...] repatriated some 700 troops from Egypt between November 1945 and March 1946 and escorted the {{battleship}} [...] while it was serving as the royal yacht during King George VI's tour of South Africa in 1947. All three sisters toured ports in Portuguese West Africa and the Belgian Congo in August–September 1948. Upon their return, Good Hope was reduced to reserve at Salisbury Island, Durban. In mid-1954 the ship began conversion into a despatch vessel in Durban and it was recommissioned on 3 June 1955 as the flagship of the South African Navy. Later that year, it conveyed the Governor General of South Africa, Ernest George Jansen, on a goodwill visit to French Madagascar. The following year, it took the navy's Chief of Staff, Rear Admiral Hugo Biermann, to Portuguese Mozambique. That same year, a South African Air Force Sikorsky S-55 <b>helicopter</b> <b>landed</b> aboard, the first <b>helicopter</b> <b>deck</b> <b>landing</b> aboard a South African warship. The ship was refitted in Simon's Town in early 1958 and transported Biermann to Portuguese West Africa and the Belgian Congo in August 1959. As part of this trip, it sailed some [...] up the Congo River to Matadi. During the early 1960s, Good Hope was assigned fishery protection duties {{in addition to her}} normal training tasks. The ship was paid off in September 1965 and was sold for R6,500, together with her sister Transvaal, in 1977. After stripping it of all valuable metals and fittings, Good Hopes hulk was donated to the False Bay Conservation Society for use as an artificial reef. She was scuttled in False Bay on 12 December 1978.|$|R
50|$|After {{her return}} from Europe in August 1958 she began 16 months of {{training}} and experimental work with the Destroyer Development Group designed to increase her fighting capacity for the modern navy. In March 1960 she entered Boston Naval Shipyard to begin a Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM) overhaul, which included extensive refitting and the installation of a <b>helicopter</b> <b>landing</b> <b>deck</b> and hangar aft. Emerging with a greatly increased life span, the ship took part in antisubmarine exercises in January 1961, {{including the use of}} the new DASH antisubmarine drone helicopter. Hugh Purvis then sailed 8 March for her sixth deployment to the Mediterranean. During this cruise the fleet stood by for any eventuality during a deepening of the Berlin Crisis. The ship returned to Newport 4 October 1961.|$|E

50|$|Laid up on {{completion}} of her trials in 1947, having carried out only 150 hours steaming, {{the need to}} replace Verulam as Sonar Trials Ship for the Admiralty Underwater Weapons Establishment at Portland saw the conversion and eventual commissioning of Matapan. In 1971 Matapan was towed to Portsmouth to begin her conversion to sonar trials ship. She was stripped of all armament and the forecastle deck was extended right to the stern to provide increased space to accommodate scientists and trials equipment, plus a large Sick Bay. She was fitted with a second funnel for the exhausting of fumes from the extra generators required to power the sonar equipment. A plated foremast carried radar and communications aerials, and a new fully enclosed bridge was fitted. A new after deckhouse, which ran from the after funnel to the quarterdeck was fitted with a <b>helicopter</b> <b>landing</b> <b>deck</b> on the top. Her refit took two years but she finally commissioned in 1973. After 24 years in the Devonport reserve Matapan had finally found {{a role in the}} navy of the seventies. Her trials period lasted for five years, with a major deployment to the United States in 1976, working with US Navy submarines, much of the work of this vessel remains classified. She paid off at Portsmouth in 1977 and was broken up at Blyth in 1978.|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedEMBA Project ReportEXECUTIVE SUMMARY: This project {{was completed by}} the Resource Management Solutions Group, {{on behalf of the}} Commander, Helicopter Sea Combat Wing Atlantic (CHSCWL), and facilitated through the Naval Postgraduate School Executive MBA program. The purpose is to collect and analyze data pertaining to current scheduling challenges for <b>helicopter</b> pilot <b>deck</b> <b>landing</b> qualifications (DLQs). The data is used to compare three potential courses of action (COAs) and provide a recommendation for a COA to pursue based on the lowest cost alternative that meets operational requirements. This study focuses on the MH- 60 S helicopter squadrons assigned to CHSCWL. Sortie data was gathered from the Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron Two and interview data collected from various Norfolk-based MH- 60 S squadrons was incorporated as well. This project focuses primarily on two areas of interest: alleviating the DLQ scheduling challenges experienced between CHSCWL and the United States Second Fleet (C 2 F) and finding the most cost effective solution that also meets the operational requirements of the Fleet Replacement Squadron (FRS), Fleet squadrons, and ships assigned to C 2 F. Our analysis examines three possible courses of action: COA 1 : Continue to conduct DLQ events using the current process of utilizing fleet ships already underway for training COA 2 : Dedicate a C 2 F duty ship with sole responsibility of conducting DLQ events for a specified period of time during its duty rotation COA 3 : Award a civilian company a contract to utilize a <b>Helicopter</b> <b>Landing</b> Trainer (HLT) to conduct DLQ events in the Chesapeake Bay or James River The results show all three COAs are capable of meeting DLQ requests; however, COA 3 provides the best solution for two main reasons. A <b>Helicopter</b> <b>Landing</b> Trainer allows for the highest level of operational readiness and minimizes the scheduling difficulties that have been experienced with DLQ requirements. Additionally, using a cost comparison, COA 3 proves to be the least costly alternative. The decision to utilize an HLT would potentially yield an annual savings of nearly $ 1. 0 million...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis capstone report describes the expected mine countermeasures (MCM) {{performance of the}} Avenger class MCM ship (MCM 1), <b>landing</b> <b>helicopter</b> <b>deck</b> (LHD) support ship, and MH- 53 E helicopter legacy systems and Increment 1 of the littoral combat ship (LCS) and MH- 60 S helicopter future systems. The study focused on two measures of effec-tiveness (MOEs) : area coverage rate sustained (ACRS) and percent clearance of mines. The systems engineering (SE) approach used to address stakeholder needs identified foundational requirements and developed functional and physi-cal architectures for simulation in conducting the comparative technical analysis. A design of experiments (DOE) methodology {{was used to determine}} which factors have the greatest influence on the MOEs. The significant factors’ values were varied to develop a set of recommended improvements to the future MCM systems. The study found that maintaining a constant search speed of 10 knots, improving the stream and recover time to 15 minutes, and improving the sortie time to 24 hours for the remote minehunting system (RMS) would provide a future ACRS performance greater than that provided by the legacy systems. When factoring in risk and operating and sustainment (O&S) costs, the future capability and recommended improvements provide better performance per cost than the legacy capability...|$|R
40|$|With many {{operations}} at sea {{carried out by}} ships or or other floating vessels, risks are involved because of the waves and resulting motions of the ships. Examples are the landing of helicopters on ships, transferring crew from a ship to a wind turbine, or working {{on the deck of}} an anchor handling tug. It is common practice to assess the workability of a certain operation by statistical criteria. The rationale behind such criteria is in general that the probability of some phenomenon (e. g. the vertical motion of a <b>helicopter</b> <b>landing</b> <b>deck)</b> exceeding a certain threshold value has to be less than a chosen acceptable level. Operability analysis usually qualify a given wave condition as workable or not workable based on such statistical criteria, assuming that no information is available about when critical wave induced events occur. In this thesis, the feasibility is investigated to obtain a short term, ’deterministic’, i. e. time-specific prediction of the critical response: making available a short term prediction of approaching waves and vessel response real time, on-board, would give crew the opportunity to anticipate and chose the optimal moment to perform a critical operation. The research is motivated by two possible advantages of such a deterministic prediction: 1. It further enhances safety in conditions that were considered as workable from a statistical point of view. 2. It possibly increases workability by pointing out windows of opportunity in conditions that were considered as unworkable from a statistical point of view. The chosen approach to obtain the mentioned deterministic prediction of waves and induced motion response, is to use the ship’s navigation radar as a remote wave sensor. The spatial domain that can be covered by a navigation radar to observe the sea surface is of course limited: both its minimum and maximum range is limited. Besides {{it is obvious that the}} wave observation will only be available in the past, and by no means in the future. Therefor, the first chapter answers the theoretical question where in the spatio-temporal domain waves can be accurately predicted, given a perfect spatio temporal observation of the waves. An indicator is proposed that specifies predictability in space and time based on the spatio-temporal observation and based on a given wave condition. It is confirmed that the group velocity of the waves is governing concerning this question. In the remaining chapters basically 2 different approaches are proposed and investigated to solve a linear wave representation based on input from synthesized radar images of sea waves. Finally the methods are applied to real radar data acquired during a sea trial. Based on the solution of the linear wave field, ship motions were predicted using pre-computed linear motion tranfer functions. Correlation coefficients up to 0. 86 were obtained for the heave motion predicted 60 sec in advance. Ship Hydromechanics and Structure...|$|E
