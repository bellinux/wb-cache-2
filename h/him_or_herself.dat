5|$|Another {{group of}} {{researchers}} has framed the cause {{in terms of}} social psychology, specifically the self-esteem theory. Beginning with Greenwald and Banaji in 1995, this group states that the name-letter effect results from implicit self-esteem, a person's tendency to evaluate <b>him</b> <b>or</b> <b>herself</b> positively in a spontaneous, automatic, or unconscious manner. Most people like themselves. The halo effect of self-esteem spreads to any attributes associated with the self, including the name and its letters. As early as 1926 Syz discovered that a person's own name is special compared to others, eliciting physical responses measurable on the skin. It is thought that when a person recognizes the letters in his or her name, that person experiences positive feelings of implicit self-esteem. These positive feelings induce subjects to unknowingly select the letters of their own name, producing the name-letter effect.|$|E
5|$|The game {{opens with}} {{a vision of the}} player's {{character}} wielding a blade of light to strike down a masked man in black robes. The vision is a dream the player has while on a carriage ride to their chosen starting city—Gridania, Ul'dah, or Limsa Lominsa. Players returning from the original release appear in a forest in a pillar of light—Louisoix's final spell to save their lives from the devastation at Carteneau. Through undertaking various odd jobs, the player character ingratiates <b>him</b> <b>or</b> <b>herself</b> with the local Adventurer's Guild and earns comparisons with the fabled Warriors of Light, brave adventurers who participated in the Battle of Carteneau whose identities have been mysteriously erased from the memories of all who knew them. A pattern emerges amid these quests involving a series of attacks by masked men, as well {{as a member of the}} Scions of the Seventh Dawn who claims to know the origin of the player's visions. The adventurer meets the leader of this secret society, Minfilia, who reveals that the visions are a manifestation of the Echo and mark the player as a chosen representative of Hydaelyn, the Mothercrystal.|$|E
5|$|Difficulty delaying {{gratification}} {{also plays}} a role in internalizing disorders like anxiety and depression. A hallmark behavior in anxiety is avoidance of feared or anxiety-provoking situations. By seeking the immediate relief that comes with avoidance, a person is succumbing to the pull of instant gratification over the larger reward from overcoming the fear and anxiety that caused the avoidance. Procrastination, which is often a reflection of anxiety, is a clear example: a person avoids a dreaded task by engaging in a more enjoyable immediate activity instead. Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is a more jarring case of this anxiety-related struggle to delay gratification; someone with OCD is unable to resist compulsions that temporarily mitigate the torture of obsessive thoughts, even though these compulsions do not banish the obsessions in the long run. One experiment, however, did not find any significant differences between samples with OCD and healthy controls in delayed gratification, while finding substantially improved delayed gratification among those with obsessive–compulsive personality disorder. Depression is also associated with lower capacity to delay gratification, though the direction of cause and effect is not clear. A depressed person who has difficulty pushing <b>him</b> <b>or</b> <b>herself</b> to engage in previously enjoyed activities is (deliberately or not) prioritizing short-term comfort and is demonstrating an impaired ability to delay gratification. There is evidence that individuals who engage in deliberate self-harm (i.e., cut themselves) are less able to tolerate emotional distress but are more able to tolerate physical pain. Thus it is argued that they injure themselves because they cannot delay gratification and need a way to end emotional pain quickly.|$|E

And finally, what is the big picture about ourselves, our world, and our Universe? The author takes us the length and breadth of the U.

25|$|The {{ascendant}} {{is generally}} considered {{the most important and}} personalized angle in the horoscope by the vast majority of astrologers.

Due to the fact that the ascendant is specific to a particular time and place, it signifies the individual environment and conditioning that a person receives during their upbringing, and also the circumstances of their childhood.

25|$|In the Canadian structure, unlike its {{counterparts}} in Britain and other countries, nominees names are put {{forward to the}} governor general by independent committees, which in turn receive nominations from the public, {{in an attempt to}} create a non-partisan process that avoids political controversy.

The Secretary to the Governor General will usually serve as secretary general to many of these boards.|$|E
40|$|What are intellectual's {{tasks and}} {{possibilities}} {{in a local}} community of a small town? In this draft the authoress considers the example of Jan Szczepański, a sociologist of world-wide fame, born in Ustroń in 1913. It presents his opinions as a researcher of education on intellectual's functions {{as well as his}} conception of individuality which can be explored by every human in <b>him</b> - <b>or</b> <b>herself</b> and which can limit the social evil. It also shows the life's path of Szczepański himself, his aims as a scholar and how he could fulfill them in realities of the Polish People's Republic. The draft portrays ambivalence towards educated persons in local community and the burden of choices which they have to make. It turns out that intellectual's responsibility to a community is not always possible to make real on place, but the most important is approach to one's work and remembrance about where does one come from. Szczepański in his life executed the determinants of peasant and Protestant reliable approach to work as a duty towards others (both the closest persons, the society and future generations) and towards the higher order, which maintains this world.

40|$|In {{dealing with}} {{patients}} {{the doctor is}} very often paternalistic. No more so than when the patient is unable to help <b>him</b> [...] <b>or</b> <b>herself.</b> Modern technology allows people to be kept alive in "intensive care" where they often become an "object" at the centre of proceedings. Fortunately for them, most patients who survive intensive care cannot remember the experience though {{this does not mean}} that they were not suffering at the time. There is a strong case for explaining things as much as possible and for making practical procedures as tolerable as possible. The relatives and families of the seriously ill often have great difficulty in understanding what is happening to their loved ones and, in these situations, suffer a great deal of stress and foreboding regarding the ultimate outcome of their illness. The stress on the staff who may become "attached" to their patients often shows through as an indifferent attitude. Peter remembers three out of fourteen days in intensive care and Jane, his wife, remembers the whole experience. Here we tell our stories in the hope that they may help our medical and nursing colleagues to manage better the patients under their care in this situation...|$|R

25|$|Trench coats have {{remained}} fashionable {{in the decades}} following World War II. Their original role {{as part of an}} army officer's uniform lent the trench coat a businesslike respectability, although many prefer to tie the belt in front (rather than use the buckle) to project a more casual look than strict military dress. Humphrey Bogart's Rick Blaine from Casablanca and Peter Sellers' Inspector Clouseau wore the trench coat in the public eye. Often, a fedora or an ushanka (during colder weather) was also worn. In the 1960s, radical intellectuals wore trench coats over black turtleneck sweaters, while some Mods wore trench coats as fashionable overcoats, {{as an alternative to the}} fishtail parka or crombie. Streakers and flashers often prefer trench coats since they conceal the wearer's lack of undergarments and can be opened quickly when the exhibitionist is ready to expose <b>him</b> <b>or</b> <b>herself.</b>|$|E

25|$|A recent law journal note {{summarized}} the justifications for regulating payday lending. The summary notes {{that while it}} is difficult to quantify the impact on specific consumers, there are external parties who are clearly affected by the decision of a borrower to get a payday loan. Most directly impacted are the holders of other low interest debt from the same borrower, which now is less likely to be paid off since the limited income is first used to pay the fee associated with the payday loan. The external costs of this product can be expanded to include the businesses that are not patronized by the cash-strapped payday customer to the children and family who are left with fewer resources than before the loan. The external costs alone, forced on people given no choice in the matter, may be enough justification for stronger regulation even assuming that the borrower <b>him</b> <b>or</b> <b>herself</b> understood the full implications of the decision to seek a payday loan.|$|E
