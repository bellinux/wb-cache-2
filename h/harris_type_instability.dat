30|$|The {{effects of}} a full 3 -D {{geometry}} on collisionless reconnection are still basically unknown. Large scale 3 -D particle-in-cell simulations are used to investigate the role of internal instabilities associated with the third dimension on the reconnection process and to {{examine the effect of}} boundary conditions which are imposed on a localized reconnection region by the large scale system. For an idealized current sheet of the <b>Harris</b> <b>type</b> the internal <b>instabilities</b> are found not to substantially alter the structure of the 2 -D diffusion region. A convection electric field localized near midnight drives a magnetotail configuration to reconnect with the formation of a thin, electron dominated current sheet and a region 2 sense field-aligned current system in the reconnection region. These processes, however, do not appear to exhibit the characteristics associated with substorm onset.|$|R

40|$|Supra-arcade downflows (hereafter {{referred}} to as SADs) are low-emission, elongated, finger-like features usually observed in active-region coronae above post-eruption flare arcades. Observations exhibit downward moving SADs intertwined with bright upward moving spikes. Whereas SADs are dark voids, spikes are brighter, denser structures. Although SADs have been observed for decades, the mechanism of formation of SADs remains an open issue. In our three-dimensional resistive magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we demonstrate that secondary Rayleigh-Taylor <b>type</b> <b>instabilities</b> develop in the downstream region of a reconnecting current sheet. The instability results {{in the formation of}} low-density coherent structures that resemble SADs, and high-density structures that appear to be spike-like.

40|$|The {{turbulent}} flow around a circular cylinder {{has been investigated}} at Re= 5000 Re= 5000 using direct numerical simulations. Low frequency behavior, vortex undulation, vortex splitting, vortex dislocations and three dimensional flow within the wake were found to happen at this flow regime. In order to successfully capture the wake three dimensionality, different span-wise lengths were considered. It was found that a length LZ= 2 pDLZ= 2 pD was enough to capture this behavior, correctly predicting {{different aspects of the}} flow such as drag coefficient, Strouhal number and pressure and velocity distributions when compared to experimental values. Two instability mechanisms were found to coexist in the present case study: a global <b>type</b> <b>instability</b> originating in the shear layer, which shows a characteristic frequency, and a convective <b>type</b> <b>instability</b> that seems to be constantly present in the near wake. Characteristics of both <b>types</b> of <b>instabilities</b> are identified and discussed in detail.

40|$|Microsatellite {{instability}} (MSI) {{is associated}} with defective DNA mismatch repair in various human malignancies. Using a unique fluorescent technique, we have observed two distinct modes of dinucleotide microsatellite alterations in human colorectal cancer. Type A alterations are defined as length changes of ≤ 6 bp. Type B changes are more drastic and involve modifications of ≥ 8 bp. We show here that defective mismatch repair is necessary and sufficient for Type A changes. These changes were observed in cell lines and in tumours from mismatch repair gene-knockout mice. No <b>Type</b> B <b>instability</b> was seen in these cells or tumours. In a panel of human colorectal tumours, both Type A MSI and <b>Type</b> B <b>instability</b> were observed. Both types of MSI were associated with hMSH 2 or hMLH 1 mismatch repair gene alterations. Intriguingly, p 53 mutations, which are generally regarded as uncommon in human tumours of the MSI+ phenotype, were frequently associated with <b>Type</b> A <b>instability,</b> whereas none was found in tumours with <b>Type</b> B <b>instability,</b> reflecting the prevailing viewpoint. Inspection of published data reveals that the microsatellite instability that has been observed in various malignancies, including those associated with Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC), is predominantly Type B. Our findings indicate that <b>Type</b> B <b>instability</b> {{is not a simple}} reflection of a repair defect.

40|$|The {{nonlinear}} {{evolution of}} the electrostatic waves observed during the AMPTE (Active Magnetosphere Particle Tracer Explorers) solar wind releases is investigated. Previous linear studies indicate two distinct sets of instabilities {{may be responsible for}} the generation. One set consists of ion-acoustic <b>type</b> <b>instabilities</b> which are insensitive to the presence of a background magnetic field, while the other group corresponds to the modified two stream instabilities and requires the solar wind flow to be across the ambient magnetic field.

In addition both the plasma wave as well as the magnetic field measurements by the IRM (Ion Release Module) spacecraft were used to correlate the frequency {{and the power of the}} observed waves with the magnitude and the direction of the solar wind magnetic field.
