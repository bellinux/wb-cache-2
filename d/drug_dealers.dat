5|$|At a diner in Washington, D.C., a man {{tries to}} access files on a laptop computer, but is {{repeatedly}} denied. Meanwhile, several <b>drug</b> <b>dealers</b> receive anonymous phone calls about {{the whereabouts of}} their competitors; they are told that {{they are at the}} same diner. Two U.S. Marshals receive a similar phone call about an escaped prisoner. The <b>drug</b> <b>dealers</b> arrive in pairs as the man attempts {{to gain access to the}} files. Just as he does, the two Marshals appear and order everyone onto the floor, causing a shootout.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} side of the {{investigation}} was Avon Barksdale's drug empire. The driven, ruthless Barksdale (Wood Harris) was aided by business-minded Stringer Bell (Idris Elba). Avon's nephew D'Angelo Barksdale (Larry Gilliard Jr.) ran some of his uncle's territory, but also possessed a guilty conscience, while loyal Wee-Bey Brice (Hassan Johnson) was responsible for multiple homicides carried out on Avon's orders. Working under D'Angelo were Poot (Tray Chaney), Bodie (J. D. Williams), and Wallace (Michael B. Jordan), all street-level <b>drug</b> <b>dealers.</b> Wallace was an intelligent but naive youth trapped in the drug trade, and Poot a randy young man happy to follow rather than lead. Omar Little (Michael K. Williams), a renowned Baltimore stick-up man robbing <b>drug</b> <b>dealers</b> for a living, was a frequent thorn in the side of the Barksdale clan.|$|E
5|$|The square is a hangout {{for drug}} users. An {{estimated}} 70 percent of teenagers who {{hang out in}} the square take drugs. The open, street-level basement of the Kikar Zion Hotel is a well-known haunt for both <b>drug</b> <b>dealers</b> and prostitutes.|$|E
5000|$|A {{reference}} {{is made to}} Curb Your Enthusiasm, as Hurley is mistaken for a <b>drug</b> <b>dealer</b> and arrested. In Curb Your Enthusiasm, Jorge Garcia plays a <b>drug</b> <b>dealer,</b> and {{his role as the}} <b>drug</b> <b>dealer</b> got him the role of Hurley in Lost.|$|R
50|$|The search yielded no <b>drugs,</b> no <b>drug</b> <b>dealer</b> and no weapons, and the <b>drug</b> <b>dealer</b> {{was arrested}} {{the next day}} {{without the use of}} {{flash-bang}} grenades.|$|R
5000|$|According to Cerillo and Bersaluna, a <b>drug</b> <b>dealer</b> {{that they}} earlier arrested claimed that Delos Santos was the mule of [...] "Neneng" [...] Escopino, a local <b>drug</b> <b>dealer</b> {{on the police}} watch list.|$|R
5|$|By {{the late}} 1990s, the O Street Market had once more become dilapidated. The {{structure}} fell into disrepair, trash collected around the building, many vendors were squatters without leases, and <b>drug</b> <b>dealers</b> and gang members loitered nearby, driving customers away. The building's owner fell behind on tax payments, {{and the city}} threatened to place a lien on the building and foreclose.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduation}} from CCNY, Shakur briefly joined the Black Panther Party (BPP). She soon left the party, disliking the macho {{behavior of the}} men and believing that the BPP lacked knowledge and understanding of United States black history. Shakur then joined the Black Liberation Army (BLA), an offshoot of the BPP whose members, inspired by the Vietcong and the Battle of Algiers, led a campaign of armed struggle against the U.S. government using tactics such as planting bombs, holding up banks and executing <b>drug</b> <b>dealers</b> and police.|$|E
5|$|Police {{departments}} throughout Oregon {{decline to}} press charges, or {{charges have been}} dropped for possessing and growing marijuana, even for convicted <b>drug</b> <b>dealers.</b> Salem police estimated they received 30 or 40 calls for marijuana activity in 2007 which were not pursued because the grow operations were legal, even one next to a high school. One grower, a previously convicted felon, was found with evidence of making hash oil, which is not protected, though a grand jury did not indict him.|$|E
5|$|Bolander (Ned Beatty) and Munch (Richard Belzer) {{investigate}} a double shooting {{in which a}} <b>drug</b> <b>dealer</b> was killed and another man was badly injured. During the investigation they find a high-class prostitute hiding in a nearby doghouse. After making unsuccessful advances on Bolander, she admits the <b>drug</b> <b>dealer</b> was killed by his own bodyguard, Newton Stuart (Richard Pelzman). After arresting him, Stuart says the other shooting victim used the <b>drug</b> <b>dealer</b> as a human shield. In a misguided attempt to follow his employer's orders to kill anyone who threatens him, Stuart said he shot through the <b>drug</b> <b>dealer</b> to ensure the man threatening him would also be shot.|$|R
5|$|Elaine Glover as PC Lucy Slater (series 1–2): {{a police}} officer who begins unknowingly dating a <b>drug</b> <b>dealer</b> after being stabbed on duty. She is later saved from her {{relationship}} with the <b>drug</b> <b>dealer</b> by her former partner, Robert Clifton.|$|R
5000|$|The {{goal here}} {{is simply to}} keep criminals away from {{potential}} victims, thus {{reducing the number of}} crimes they can commit. The criticism of this model is that others increase the number and severity of crimes they commit {{to make up for the}} [...] "vacuum" [...] left by the removed criminal. For example, incarcerating a <b>drug</b> <b>dealer</b> will result in an unmet demand for drugs at that locale, and an existing or new <b>drug</b> <b>dealer</b> will then appear, to fill the void. This new <b>drug</b> <b>dealer</b> may have been innocent of any crimes before this opportunity, or may have been guilty of less serious crimes, such as being a look-out for the previous <b>drug</b> <b>dealer.</b>|$|R
5|$|Simon {{has stated}} that he {{originally}} set out to create a police drama loosely based on the experiences of his writing partner Ed Burns, a former homicide detective and public school teacher {{who had worked with}} Simon on projects including The Corner (2000). Burns, when working on protracted investigations of violent <b>drug</b> <b>dealers</b> using surveillance technology, had often been frustrated by the bureaucracy of the Baltimore Police Department; Simon saw similarities with his own ordeals as a police reporter for The Baltimore Sun.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} hotel, policemen Lobo and Lele kill three <b>drug</b> <b>dealers</b> and collect a guitar case {{containing}} cocaine, which they must deliver to drug lord Tashi. Charlie {{and his men}} invade the jockey's hotel room and take all his possessions. The ensuing chase leads to the hotel car park where Lobo and Lele are placing the guitar case in their van. Charlie and his men seize the van {{to escape from the}} jockey's men and realise they had stolen a police vehicle, whilst also discovering the cocaine, which Charlie steals to sell. The policemen, upon returning, discover that the cocaine is missing and set out to find Charlie.|$|E
5|$|Bond and Solitaire escape by {{boat and}} fly to New Orleans. There, Bond is {{captured}} by Kananga. It transpires that Kananga is producing two tons of heroin and is protecting the poppy fields by exploiting San Monique locals' fear of voodoo priest Baron Samedi, and the occult. Through his alter ego, Mr. Big, Kananga plans {{to distribute the}} heroin free of charge at his Fillet of Soul restaurants, which will {{increase the number of}} addicts. He intends to bankrupt other <b>drug</b> <b>dealers</b> with his giveaway, then charge high prices for his heroin later in order to capitalize on the huge drug dependencies he has cultivated.|$|E

50|$|Become A Drug DealerBecome A <b>Drug</b> <b>Dealer</b> {{is another}} KCA {{campaign}} that gives people {{the opportunity to}} purchase the drugs necessary to keep a child alive either by buying a T-shirt with the words <b>Drug</b> <b>Dealer</b> printed on it or making the typical monthly donation.|$|R
5|$|Dr. Kroger tells Monk he {{has found}} a therapist, Dr. Jonah Sorenson (Rick Curry); in session, he remembers where the rock came from. Monk goes to Dr. Kroger's office and shows Dr. Kroger the rock came from the courtyard, to which only Dr. Kroger and Merrigan have access to. In Merrigan's office, they find {{powdered}} milk but not a coffeemaker and, as powdered milk is made from lactose and <b>drug</b> <b>dealers</b> use it to cut heroin, Monk deduces Merrigan is trafficking drugs, and he probably also killed Teresa. Suddenly, Merrigan appears, ties them to chairs, and loads them {{into the back of}} his truck.|$|E
5|$|However, this {{resurgence}} {{soon became}} commodified as a trend, while actual awareness within the African-American community was limited and ineffectual to {{issues such as}} drug dealing and the prevalence of liquor stores in such neighborhoods. Public Enemy responded to this and other deep-rooted problems of Black America on their following album, Apocalypse 91... The Enemy Strikes Black (1991), which featured more critical assessments of African-Americans, denouncing Black <b>drug</b> <b>dealers</b> who donned Afrocentric merchandise, hip hop artists who promoted malt liquor, black radio stations for lacking significant airplay to hip hop, and even the Africans {{at the onset of}} the Atlantic slave trade for lacking unity.|$|E
5|$|Natasha Falle {{grew up in}} {{a middle-class}} home in Nova Scotia; a suburb of Toronto, Ontario; and a suburb of Calgary, Alberta. Her mother managed stores in the wedding {{industry}} and her father was a police officer with a vice squad, arresting <b>drug</b> <b>dealers</b> and pimps. While she was growing up, Falle had multiple family members with addictions. When she was a young teenager, Falle's parents divorced, and she subsequently lived in a single-parent home with her mother. They moved into an apartment in downtown Toronto. Falle's father did not pay her mother alimony and there was often no money for food, so Falle began stealing food to survive.|$|E

5|$|Sanchez takes Bond to his base, {{which is}} {{disguised}} as {{the headquarters of}} a religious cult. Bond learns that Sanchez's scientists can dissolve cocaine in petrol and then sell it disguised as fuel to Asian <b>drug</b> <b>dealers.</b> The televangelist Professor Joe Butcher serves as middleman, working under Sanchez's business manager Truman-Lodge. During Sanchez's presentation to potential Asian customers, Dario discovers Bond and betrays him to Sanchez. Bond starts {{a fire in the}} laboratory, but is captured again and placed on the conveyor belt that drops the brick-cocaine into a giant shredder. Bouvier arrives and shoots Dario, allowing Bond to pull Dario into the shredder, killing him.|$|E
5|$|The prison barge was {{temporarily}} closed in August 1995 due to less crowded city jails, {{caused by a}} decline in arrests and inmate transfers. In late 1996, the prison was slated for reopening due to the rise in arrests from a campaign targeting drugs and <b>drug</b> <b>dealers.</b> The six-month campaign expected more than seven thousand additional arrests than usual, but the ship was not reopened until 1998 when it {{was used by the}} Department of Juvenile Justice. The Bain Center is currently used as a processing facility for inmates in the Department of Corrections system. There are three other processing facilities that each handle specific boroughs.|$|E
5|$|The protagonist {{and their}} friend, Eric Sparrow, live in {{suburban}} New Jersey and {{dream of becoming}} famous skateboarders. The protagonist manages to impress professional skater Chad Muska, visiting town for a demo, who gives them a new skateboard and informs them that {{a good way to}} start a skating career is to gain a sponsorship from a local skate shop. The protagonist seeks out Stacy Peralta, who agrees until he sees something to set them apart from the other local skaters, so the protagonist travels to Manhattan with Eric, who is on the run from <b>drug</b> <b>dealers</b> after setting their car on fire for stealing from the skate shop.|$|E

5|$|A judge banned all filming {{but this}} ruling was {{overturned}} by an injunction. Although officials were angry, the residents were not and Jackson {{was surrounded by}} crowds of enthusiastic onlookers during filming. One woman managed to push through security to hug Jackson who continued dancing while hugging her. Another woman appeared and hugged him from behind. He then {{fell to the ground}} as police pulled the two women off him and escorted them away. After the director helped Jackson get up off the street, he continued to sing and dance. This incident made it into the music video. 1,500 policemen and 50 residents acting as security guards effectively sealed off the Dona Marta favela. Some residents and officials found it offensive that Jackson's production team had negotiated with <b>drug</b> <b>dealers</b> in order to gain permission to film in one of the city's shantytowns.|$|E
5|$|After {{a dispute}} over stolen goods turns violent, Sobotka's son Ziggy is charged {{with the murder of}} one of the Greek's underlings. Sobotka himself is arrested for smuggling; he agrees to work with the detail to help his son, finally seeing his actions as a mistake. However, the Greek learns about this through his mole inside the FBI and has Sobotka killed. The {{investigation}} ends with the fourteen homicides solved but the perpetrator already dead. Several <b>drug</b> <b>dealers</b> and mid-level smuggling figures tied to the Greek are arrested, but he and his second-in-command escape uncharged and unidentified. The Major is pleased that Sobotka was arrested; the case is seen as a success by the commanding officers, but is viewed as a failure by the detail.|$|E
5|$|In 1993 Christensen was arrested, tried, {{and sentenced}} to five years, four months {{imprisonment}} for trafficking marijuana and heroin. She claimed {{that she had been}} driving a car from Texas to Florida as a favor to friends, and had no knowledge that she was being used as a drug mule by them. Many Odinists and Asastruer decried the sentence, and claimed that it was a political frame-up; Murray established a Free Else Christensen Committee and with Stephen McNallen created a defense fund to aid her. Christensen herself did not endorse the claim that the charges were politically motivated, instead blaming her own naivete at being exploited by <b>drug</b> <b>dealers.</b> Before being imprisoned she gave the Odinist Fellowship's membership list to McNallen for the use of his own Heathen organisation, the Asatru Folk Assembly.|$|E
