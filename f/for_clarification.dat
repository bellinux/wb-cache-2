5|$|NASCAR {{spokesperson}} Jim Hunter however insisted Smith was {{not forced}} below the yellow line, and stated drivers were warned beforehand in the pre-race drivers' meeting about gaining a position illegally. Earnhardt felt Smith deserved {{to win the}} race, saying {{there was a lack}} of clarity over what going below the yellow line meant. Smith stated he did not ask <b>for</b> <b>clarification</b> of the rule because of his low-profile status. NASCAR president Mike Helton stated that race officials had correctly awarded the penalty to Smith, and clarified that no driver would be allowed to advance their position by going below the yellow line at any time during a race. Similarities were also made between Smith's overtake, and Earnhardt's pass of Kenseth below the yellow line at Talladega at the 2003 Aaron's 499.|$|E
5|$|Two minor controversies marked Beshear's {{tenure as}} {{attorney}} general. The {{first came in}} the aftermath of the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in the 1980 case of Stone v. Graham. The ruling struck down the state law requiring the posting of the Ten Commandments in all of the state's classrooms on grounds that it violated the Establishment Clause of the federal constitution. State Superintendent Raymond Barber asked the Supreme Court to clarify whether its ruling meant that all of the copies of the Commandments already posted had to be taken down or whether it simply invalidated the Kentucky requirement for them to be posted; the Court refused the request <b>for</b> <b>clarification.</b> Beshear then issued an advisory opinion that displaying the Commandments in classrooms under any circumstances was banned by the Court's ruling.|$|E
5|$|Demonstrations {{were planned}} to take place during the show. A protest rally by Unite Against Fascism (UAF) had been held in London {{on the night of}} Tuesday 20 October, and sixteen coachloads of UAF protesters were {{expected}} on the day. Amid concern over the safety of residents, Hammersmith and Fulham council asked <b>for</b> <b>clarification</b> of the BBC's security arrangements, and pushed for an alternative location. Although the protest organisers UAF rejected suggestions that the protests would be violent, security was stepped up at BBC Television Centre. Simon Darby of the BNP stated there would be no counter-demonstration. Griffin expressed fears over his safety for his arrival and departure. Extra officers of the Metropolitan Police were drafted in to maintain order outside the studios, while the BBC recruited an extra 60 security guards for inside the studio.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} year Soegija asked {{to join the}} Catholic-education classes, citing a desire to fully use the facilities at Xaverius. His teacher, Father Mertens, told Soegija that he required permission from his parents first; although they refused, Soegija was nevertheless allowed to study Catholicism. He was intrigued by the Trinity, and asked several of the priests <b>for</b> <b>clarification.</b> Van Lith cited the works of Thomas Aquinas, while Mertens discussed the Trinity as explained by Augustine of Hippo; the latter told him that humans were not meant to understand God with their limited knowledge. Soegija, who wanted to learn more, asked to be baptised, quoting the Finding in the Temple to show why he should not need his parents' permission. The priests agreed, and Soegija was baptised on 24December 1910, taking the baptismal name Albertus, for Albertus Magnus. During Christmas holidays, he told his family that he had converted. Although his immediate family eventually accepted this, and may have eventually supported him, Soegija's other relatives refused {{to speak to him}} afterwards.|$|E
5|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Francis Lawrence and produced by Caleb Dewart of DNA Inc. The video deals directly with the lyrics' theme of Stefani's search for inspiration in songwriting. It opens with a lengthy non-musical section in which Stefani arrives in Los Angeles off of No Doubt's Rock Steady Tour. She receives several calls from Interscope label head Jimmy Iovine, who attempts to push her forward with her solo debut project, but she replies that she is tired and uninspired. After a failed studio attempt, Stefani sees a flyer advertising help for writer's block. Upon arrival she is asked {{to fill out a}} suspicious questionnaire, where the camera pans to the questions which will be important. She is then told that she will be billed when she is finished. She asks <b>for</b> <b>clarification</b> only to discover that she is already back in the studio by herself. When Stefani picks up an oversized pocket watch from the piano, a rabbit knick-knack that she had previously seen jumps across the room. She throws the watch at the knick-knack, causing her to fall back on her chair and find herself transported to a fantasy world based on Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass.|$|E

25|$|In 1954 Leon Festinger, a {{well known}} social psychologist, {{presented}} his influential social comparison theory, which proposes that people seek to obtain accurate self-evaluations by comparing themselves to similar others. Furthermore, people turn to their social environment to search <b>for</b> <b>clarification</b> {{when faced with}} obscure or confusing environmental situations or sensations. Thus extending this theory to emotions would posit that after experiencing emotional situations that {{do not conform to}} held expectations or that are ambiguous, one would be expected to later share that emotional experience with others.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} of Uthman's caliphate, there was a {{perceived}} need <b>for</b> <b>clarification</b> of Quran reading. The Caliphate had grown considerably, expanding into Iraq, Syria, Egypt, and Iran, bringing into Islam's fold many new converts from various cultures {{with varying degrees of}} isolation. These converts spoke a variety of languages but were not well learned in Arabic, and so Uthman felt it was important to standardize the written text of the Quran into one specific Arabic dialect. Another reason for compiling the Quran was that many Muslims who had memorised the Quran in its entirety (huffaz) were dying, especially in battle.|$|E

25|$|The {{quest for}} holism leads most anthropologists {{to study a}} people in detail, using biogenetic, archaeological, and {{linguistic}} data alongside direct observation of contemporary customs. In the 1990s and 2000s, calls <b>for</b> <b>clarification</b> {{of what constitutes a}} culture, of how an observer knows where his or her own culture ends and another begins, and other crucial topics in writing anthropology were heard. It is possible to view all human cultures as part of one large, evolving global culture. These dynamic relationships, between what can be observed on the ground, as opposed to what can be observed by compiling many local observations remain fundamental in any kind of anthropology, whether cultural, biological, linguistic or archaeological.|$|E

Umpire Benson appeared unsure as to whether it carried and instead of referring to third umpire asked captain Ricky Ponting <b>for</b> <b>clarification.</b> There was a prior agreement between the teams that the fielders would be honest about whether the catch had carried.

25|$|Detail {{notes from}} {{visitors}} to the Constantia estate in the 18th century give evidence of the Dutch influence on South African winemaking. As they did for the French centuries earlier, the Dutch introduced the technique of adding sulphur to halt fermentation before all the residual sugar has been completely converted into alcohol. This allowed the wine to maintain its sweetness without increasing the alcohol level, similar to adding brandy {{in the production of}} fortified sweet wines; another technique pioneered by the Dutch. To {{keep an eye on the}} ongoing process of fermentation, Cape winemakers would listen near the bunghole of the wine barrel for noise and irritation in the barrel, described as sounding like the barrel was full of crabs. When the barrel was completely quiet and no longer making crab-like noises the wine would finally be racked <b>for</b> <b>clarification</b> and stabilization.|$|E
25|$|Meade asked Grant <b>for</b> <b>clarification</b> because Grant {{had ordered}} a 4:00a.m. attack {{all along the}} line. Grant said both Humphreys and Parke should feel {{for a chance to}} push on that night, that Humphreys should send skirmishers forward and attack if the Confederates were leaving their positions. If the Confederates held their line, Grant said that Humphreys should send Miles's {{division}} down White Oak Road to reinforce Sheridan. Grant also directed that Wright, Parke and Ord, with John Gibbon's XXIV Corps from the Army of the James, should begin an artillery barrage on the Confederate lines. The corps commanders and Ord reported their men could not see well enough to attack. At 10:00p.m., Union artillery opened fire on the Confederate lines opposite the Petersburg lines until 2:00a.m. The Confederates did not leave the lines and the Union assault began at about4:40a.m.|$|E
25|$|Usually the pressed juice {{will require}} some {{additional}} treatment, {{which can be}} done separately to the pressed juice alone or to the entire batch of wine if the pressed juice is blended with the free-run. These treatments may include acid adjustments to lower pH, extended settling periods <b>for</b> <b>clarification</b> and additional racking to remove the extra suspended solids {{and the use of}} fining agents to remove extra solids or excess tannins. Grape pulp contains a lot of pectins that create colloid coagulation with these solids that will make the wine difficult to stabilize. Some winemakers will use pectolytic enzymes during the maceration process to help break down the cell walls to allow the release of more juice freely. These enzymes are also used with white wines to assist in clarification. The type of pressing used and the amount of suspended solids plays a particular role in filtering decisions as a high amount of suspended solids (particularly natural gums) can clog and damage expensive filters.|$|E
