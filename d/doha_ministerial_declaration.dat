The Declaration took note of non-trade concerns reflected in negotiating proposals of various member countries and confirmed that they would be taken into account in the negotiations. March 31, 2003 was set as the deadline for reaching agreement on “modalities” (targets, formulas, timetables, etc.)for achieving the mandated objectives, but that deadline was missed. During the rest of 2003, negotiations on modalities continued in preparation for the fifth WTO Ministerial Conference held in Cancun, Mexico September 10-14, 2003.|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{examines}} {{the role and}} position of developing countries in the World Trade Organization (WTO) {{in relation to the}} Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). The analysis was done through three case studies involving major developing countries such as Brazil, India and Argentina, major developed country such as the USA and the regional trading bloc, the EC. The case studies identified a number of areas of conflict such as the exemptions under Article 30 of the TRIPS Agreement, compulsory licensing under Article 31 of TRIPS, the exhaustion of rights after sale of the patented products along with parallel imports, local working, and the role of competition policy to deal with the abuses arising out of patenting monopolies. The case studies were followed by two chapters dealing with attempts to resolve the conflicts through the Dispute Settlement System of the WTO and the Ministerial Conference. The significant developments in this regard have been the WTO Panel Report in Canada-Protection of Pharmaceutical Patents removing object and purpose from interpretations of the TRIPS Agreement, paras 4 and 5 of the <b>Doha</b> <b>Declaration</b> (<b>Ministerial</b> <b>Declaration</b> at <b>Doha</b> dealing with Public Health) restoring object and purpose in interpreting the provisions of the Treaty Agreement as per customary rule of treaty interpretations and the Paragraph 6 solution of 30 th August 2003 introducing export of the patented products as one of the rights under patents. The analysis suggests that developing countries have a limited role to play in such negotiations and interpretations of international treaty such as the TRIPS Agreement and their participation in such negotiations and interpretations is not very effective. The last part of this thesis deals with recommendations and suggests that suitable competition provisions in the legal system of developing countries may prevent or lessen abuses originating from patenting monopolies including issues of parallel trade, discriminatory pricing and non-local working...|$|R

LDCs are projected to benefit; Australia is predicted to lose, reflecting the dominance of trade diversion over trade creation effects and adverse terms of trade effects. However, the magnitude of the adverse effect on Australia is small.

40|$|The <b>Doha</b> <b>Ministerial</b> <b>Declaration</b> {{emphasized}} that priority {{should be given}} to improving market access for products originating in the Least Developed Countries (LDCs). In this paper, we analyze the importance of this proposition with respect to market access in the Triad economies. We first present a brief history of non-reciprocal preferences granted by the Triad. This covers Generalized System of Preference (GSP) programmes in each, and further preferences granted to African, Caribbean and Pacific countries by the EU and preferences granted to Caribbean Basin, Andean, and African countries by the US. This history is followed by an assessment of trade generated by these preferences in the year 2000, and {{of the extent to which}} LDC exports might be expected to increase should the preferences be made comprehensive. Preferences in 2000 are shown to have led to an increase of US$ 3. 5 billion in LDC exports, while a complete duty-free treatment could expand LDC exports by as much as US$ 7. 6 billion, 90 per cent of which will be absorbed by the US. As this represents a doubling of LDC exports to these countries, we interpret these results as an endorsement of this priority in the Doha Round of negotiations...|$|E

40|$|The <b>Doha</b> <b>ministerial</b> <b>declaration</b> {{concerning}} {{market access}} for non-agricultural products states that negotiations should aim, by modalities to be agreed, {{to reduce or}} as appropriate eliminate tariffs, including the reduction or elimination of tariff peaks. This study proposes a CGE assessment {{of the impact of}} various modalities of such liberalisation. Scenarios considered include the Girard's proposal (with alternative choices for the involved coefficient), the removal of tariff peaks and complete liberalisation. A special and differential treatment (SDT) for developing countries is also considered. Existing preferential trade arrangements are taken into account exhaustively, based on the MAcMap database, and tariff cuts are computed at the HS- 6 product level. In addition, in order to assess properly the context in which such liberalisation is likely to take place, a pre-experiment simulation is carried out, including the MFA, China and Russia accession to the WTO, and the extension of AGOA to all sub-Saharan African countries. The impact of these scenarios is finally assessed using MIRAGE, a CGE model incorporating imperfect competition used here in its static version. The results show that liberalising non-agricultural market access is welfare improving at the world level, but that this is mainly due to the removal of tariff peaks. Cross-country distributive impacts prove significant, and are strongly altered by granting developing countries with a SDT...|$|E

Economics provides a useful set of analytical tools and are directly relevant, in particular since the successfully arranged marriage of IP and trade rules after which it became inevitable that IP rules would be measured using an economic yardstick. The Paper also considers the claim that making proper intellectual property policy is impossible or inherently unreliable because theoretical models are inadequate or valid empirical data unavailable. Against this backdrop, the Article then examines the emergence of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). TRIPS added a significant level of comfort for multinational corporations deciding when and where to export to new markets or expand research and development efforts.

This article will discuss the two Doha Transparency Mechanisms (legal transparency) regarding regional trade agreements, as they appear in two General Council decisions from 2006 and 2010. I will argue based on a closer look and a consistent interpretation of Paragraph 10 of the <b>Doha</b> <b>Ministerial</b> <b>Declaration</b> that there is another type of transparency that is relevant to the discussion on PTAs/RTAs, namely “internal transparency. ” “Internal transparency stricto sensu” highlights the significance of trust in the WTO institutional processes, such as negotiations, decision-making, dispute settlement and trade monitoring that the representatives of developing member states should have in order for the WTO system to function productively. “Internal transparency lato sensu” is introduced in this article as an extension to include any decision-making deficits, exclusionary and asymmetrical outcomes specifically in the area of unchecked Preferential Trade Agreement proliferation.
