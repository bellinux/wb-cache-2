40|$|The CDM {{seems to}} play a {{significant}} role in international GHG reduction activities. Yet, a few emerging <b>countries</b> have <b>hosted</b> majority of CDM projects whereas most LDCs have not hosted CDM projects at all. Given the current distributional imbalance, this study aims to identify determinants of CDM project hosting based on an empirical analysis using the tobit model. On the basis of the literature review, this study focuses on two factors, namely the host countries’ qualities of business environment and scientific level. As a result, this study finds the significance of business environment for both bilateral and unilateral CDM projects. Likewise, the significance of scientific and technical level is confirmed especially for unilateral CDM projects. Finally, this article suggests that <b>eligible</b> <b>host</b> <b>countries</b> should focus exclusively on the improvement of controllable determinants such as business environment to attract CDM investors. In addition, it is likely to be better for <b>eligible</b> <b>host</b> <b>countries</b> with low GHG emissions to develop CDM projects unilaterally using programmatic CDM due to their lower economic attractiveness. ...|$|R

40|$|Losing {{highly skilled}} Asian {{immigrants}} in the United States (U. S.) to their home country or third country is becoming a concern. Few {{studies have focused on}} psychological factors that result in highly skilled immigrant return migration. This research examines the influence of cultural value congruence between home <b>country</b> and <b>host</b> <b>country</b> or the lack thereof, on <b>host</b> <b>country</b> turnover intentions of Asian Indian {{immigrants in the}} U. S., both in the immediate and the distant future. The present study is based on the person-environment fit literature with special focus on national cultural value congruence which is seen as essential to immigrants successfully acculturating and deciding to remain in their <b>host</b> <b>country.</b> It was hypothesized that cultural value congruence experienced by immigrants will be related to their <b>host</b> <b>country</b> turnover intentions such that lower congruence with <b>host</b> <b>country</b> cultural values would result in higher <b>host</b> <b>country</b> turnover intentions. The individualism-collectivism scale developed by Triandis and Gelfand (1998) was utilized to measure the horizontal and vertical aspects of individualism and collectivism represented in the immigrants’ home <b>country</b> and <b>host</b> <b>country</b> cultural values. Congruence between these values was calculated using an absolute difference score. A one-shot cross section survey design was utilized to collect data from 153 highly skilled first generation Asian Indian immigrants located throughout the United States. Results confirmed partial support for cultural value congruence and immigrant <b>host</b> <b>country</b> turnover intentions with lower congruence on vertical individualism values resulting in higher immigrant <b>host</b> <b>country</b> turnover intentions in the distant future. No support was found for cultural value congruence on other cultural value subscales – vertical collectivism, horizontal individualism and horizontal collectivism, and <b>host</b> <b>country</b> turnover intentions in the distant future. No support was found for cultural value congruence and <b>host</b> <b>country</b> turnover intentions in the immediate future. In addition, the experience of immigrants in the workplace, specifically perceived workplace discrimination and leader cultural intelligence, were examined for their moderating role in the relationship between cultural value congruence and <b>host</b> <b>country</b> turnover intentions. No support was found for moderator effects of perceived workplace discrimination and leader cultural intelligence as hypothesized in the study. Instead, significant effects were noted for low levels of perceived workplace discrimination on cultural value congruence and <b>host</b> <b>country</b> turnover intentions in the distant future, and high levels of perceived workplace discrimination on cultural value congruence and <b>host</b> <b>country</b> turnover intentions in the immediate future. Significant effects were also noted for low and high leader cultural intelligence on cultural value congruence and immigrant <b>host</b> <b>country</b> turnover intentions in the distant future.

The traumatic experiences they encounter on the journey from their homelands to <b>host</b> <b>countries</b> cause helplessness, fear and dependency. On the other hand, citizens of the <b>host</b> <b>countries</b> often have a negative psychological disposition toward migrants. This has been more distinct with the increased flow of migrants and refugees into Europe following conflict, civil wars and economic inertia in Africa and the Middle East. For effective and positive migration governance, citizens of <b>host</b> <b>countries</b> need to transform their negative socio-psychological attitudes and dispositions towards migrants, and the migrants need to restore their confidence as well as increase trust with the <b>host</b> <b>countries</b> to facilitate social cohesion. Thus, both the <b>host</b> <b>country</b> citizens and the refugees require a cognitive, emotional and moral transformation.
