5|$|On 20 June 1791, a plot, {{dubbed the}} Flight to Varennes, almost allowed the king {{to escape from}} France. As leader of the National Guard, Lafayette had been {{responsible}} for the royal family's custody. He was thus blamed by extremists like Danton for the near-escape and called a traitor to the people by Robespierre. These accusations made Lafayette appear a royalist, damaging his reputation {{in the eyes of the}} public, and strengthened the hands of the Jacobins and other radicals.

5|$|The {{most likely}} {{cause of the}} {{accident}} {{seemed to be that}} the fireworks attached to her balloon had been knocked out of position by a tree as she ascended; possibly the balloon was heavily loaded and failed to rise quickly enough. When she had lit the fuses the fireworks headed towards the balloon instead of away from it; one of them burned a hole in the fabric, igniting the gas. One man reportedly spotted the problem and shouted to her not to light the fuses, but his cries were <b>drowned</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> the cheering of the crowd. Later reports suggested she had left the gas valve open, allowing sparks to ignite the gas and set fire to the balloon, or that her balloon was of poor construction and allowed gas to escape throughout the ascent.|$|E
30|$|Hence, in this work, we {{experimentally}} {{determine the}} DR threshold for an ADC with 12 bits quantization resolution and compare our result with the link-budget-based estimations from [3]. We arrange an experimental setup that closely mimics the LTE UL transmission of two UEs {{to a single}} BS. By holding the bandwidth and the channel constant for both UEs, we can adjust the signal strength of which the UEs are received at the BS by adjusting the UE’s transmit powers. In this way, we can realize any arbitrary difference in the receive powers between the two UEs. By observing the weak UE’s bit error rate (BER), we can define the receive power difference at which the weak UE’s signal is <b>drown</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> the strong UE’s signal. Based on this measurement, we can compute the DR threshold. Furthermore, we show that the interference scenario {{has an impact on}} the resulting DR threshold as we are using BER measurements to identify when the weak UE is <b>drown</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> the strong UE. We estimate the error of the DR threshold measurement and compare it to a link-budget-based estimation.|$|R

This channel-selectivity corresponds to what we define as the DR threshold. However, we have so far defined the DR threshold rather loosely as the DR at which the signal of a weak UE is <b>drown</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> the signal of a strong UE, i.e., we have not defined an exact threshold at which we consider a UE to be <b>drowned</b> <b>out.</b> We define this point in Section 5 under consideration of our experimental setup.|$|R

5|$|The journalists quickly {{decided they}} needed expert advice on {{ballistics}} and explosives, to which end they engaged Lieutenant Colonel George Styles, GC, a retired British Army {{officer who had}} served as a bomb-disposal officer in Northern Ireland during the Troubles. Styles arrived in Gibraltar on 23 March, and immediately went to inspect the car park where Savage had parked the white Renault {{on the day of the}} shootings, after which he walked through the town along what the journalists believed was the IRA members' most likely route. When asked his opinion by the journalists, Styles cast doubt on the authorities' stated reasons for the shootings. He explained to the journalists that, had Savage's white Renault contained a substantial bomb, the weight would have been evident on the vehicle's springs. Styles also felt that the potential bomb was unlikely to have been detonated with a remote detonator on account of the buildings between the scenes of the shootings and the likelihood that it would be <b>drowned</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> other radio signals in the area. Finally, the journalists asked Styles to examine the scenes of the shootings, including ricochet marks that the soldiers' bullets had left on the pumps at the petrol station where McCann and Farrell were shot.|$|E

30|$|We {{would like}} to point out that an UE’s BER depends on the {{modulation}} scheme used. In order to remain focus on the parameters of interest (receive power difference between strong and weak UE), we decided to use QPSK modulation only. Setting the modulation fixed to QPSK is reasonable because the UEs, which have the highest risk of being <b>drown</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> other UEs, are the ones at the cell edge. These cell edge UEs will most likely transmit with the most robust modulation scheme they could choose, i.e., with QPSK modulation. Since the BER of the interfering UE 1 is irrelevant for our experiment, we can simply use QPSK modulation for UE 1 as well.|$|R

30|$|Despite the {{orthogonality}} of LTE’s uplink transmission, it {{can happen}} that signals which are received at the base station with low power are <b>drown</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> strong signals from other users. Reason is the limited quantization resolution of the base station’s analog-to-digital converter. Since this effect causes a quality of service degradation for users at the cell edge, the dynamic receive power range of uplink signals arriving at the base station should be upper limited. However, setting an adequate upper limit for the dynamic receive power range is not trivial since many effects, such as quantization noise, fast fading etc., decrease the dynamic range which the analog-to-digital converter can handle in theory. In this paper, we measure the maximal uplink dynamic receive power range, denoted as uplink dynamic range threshold, for our LTE-like measurement setup by monitoring the uplink bit-error-rate of a first user while decreasing its transmit power during {{the presence of a}} second adjacently scheduled user with fixed transmit power. As the measured threshold is 31.4 ± 7.6 dB, we can conclude that a link-budget-based estimation of the dynamic receive power range, which has been published previously, is accurate since its result coincides with the measurement.|$|R

50|$|The phenomenon, {{some years}} later, of {{marketers}} <b>drowning</b> <b>out</b> discourse <b>by</b> flooding Usenet newsgroups and individuals' email with junk mail advertising messages was named spamming, due to some early internet users that flooded forums {{with the word}} spam recounting the repetitive and unwanted presence of spam in the sketch.

30|$|The {{experimental}} setup {{consists of}} one evolved Node-B (eNB) and two UEs manufactured by SIGNALION (a National Instruments Company). The setup basically {{consists of a}} FPGA-based baseband unit and a radio front-end. Basic operating functionality {{is provided by the}} hardware in real-time, including generation of random user data, pilots, and control information at the transmitter side, as well as synchronization and decoding of the control information at the receiver side. Hence, performance metrics such as Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP), and SINR are available in real time. Further processing of measured data is done with non-real-time scripts using MATLAB. The physical layer is based on LTE release 8 with deviations: In the LTE UL orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is used instead of SC-FDMA. We use OFDMA instead of SC-FDMA since our technical setup does not allow for an SC-FDMA transmission. Nevertheless, we believe that the choice of OFDMA instead of SC-FDMA does not impact the DR threshold measured. The effect that a weak UE is <b>drown</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> interference from one or more other UEs in the same cell is caused by the critical receive power difference between the weakest UE and the interferers. However, the only difference in the signal processing at the BS between OFDMA and SC-FDMA is an additional Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT), which does not change the power constellation between the weak UE and the interferers. Furthermore, we would {{like to point out that}} we can treat the interference of n UEs with each 1 PRB using the SC-FDMA transmission scheme as the same as interference from 1 UE with a bandwidth of n PRBs using the OFDMA transmission scheme as in both cases the receive power probability density function (PDF) over time will be similar. In addition, LTE-Advanced uses clustered SC-FDMA [10] in order to satisfy the demand for flexible UL resource scheduling. This clustered SC-FDMA also has similar PAPR values as OFDMA (dependent on the number of clusters) [10].|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} a novel antenna design for communi-cating with ISO/IEC 14443 A RFID cards at larger distances than the normal 5 - 10 cm.

The strong field required to power the card at larger distances is likely to <b>drown</b> <b>out</b> its response. <b>By</b> detecting the higher harmonic frequencies originating from the card’s response this problem is solved, making communication at larger distances possible. The two antennas, placed 100 cm apart, form an RFID gate that can communicate with cards {{in the middle of}} the gate.
