5|$|The {{blackcap}} has a {{very large}} range, and its population in <b>Europe</b> <b>is</b> estimated at 25–49million breeding pairs. Allowing for birds breeding in Africa and Asia, the total population is between 80–196million individuals. It is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of Least Concern.|$|E

5|$|During the ice ages, Northern England {{was buried}} under ice sheets, and little {{evidence}} remains of habitation – either because the climate made the area uninhabitable, or because glaciation destroyed most evidence of human activity. The northern-most cave art in <b>Europe</b> <b>is</b> found at Creswell Crags in northern Derbyshire, near modern-day Sheffield, which {{shows signs of}} Neanderthal inhabitation 50 to 60 thousand years ago, and of a more modern occupation known as the Creswellian culture around 12,000 years ago. Kirkwell Cave in Lower Allithwaite, Cumbria shows signs of the Federmesser culture of the Paleolithic, and was inhabited some time between 13,400 and 12,800 years ago.|$|E
5|$|<b>Europe</b> <b>is</b> home to {{only three}} species: D. intermedia, D. anglica, and D. rotundifolia. Where the ranges {{of the two}} latter species overlap, they {{sometimes}} hybridize to form the sterile D. × obovata. In addition to the three species and the hybrid native to Europe, North America {{is also home to}} four additional species; D. brevifolia is a small annual native to coastal states from Texas to Virginia, while D. capillaris, a slightly larger plant with a similar range, is also found in areas of the Caribbean. The third species, D. linearis, is native to the northern United States and southern Canada. D. filiformis has two subspecies native to the East Coast of North America, the Gulf Coast, and the Florida panhandle.|$|E
5|$|European {{banks are}} {{estimated}} to have incurred losses approaching €1 trillion between {{the outbreak of the}} financial crisis in 2007 and 2010. The European Commission approved some €4.5 trillion in state aid for banks between October 2008 and October 2011, a sum which includes the value of taxpayer-funded recapitalisations and public guarantees on banking debts. This has prompted some economists such as Joseph Stiglitz and Paul Krugman to note that <b>Europe</b> <b>is</b> not suffering from a sovereign debt crisis but rather from a banking crisis.|$|E
