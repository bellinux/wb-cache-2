500|$|Anne's gout {{rendered}} her lame {{for much}} of her later life. Around the court, she was carried in a sedan chair, or used a wheelchair. Around her estates, she used a one-horse chaise, which she drove herself [...] "furiously like Jehu and a mighty hunter like Nimrod". She gained weight {{as a result of}} her sedentary lifestyle; in Sarah's words, [...] "she grew exceeding gross and corpulent. There was something of majesty in her look, but mixed with a gloominess of soul". Sir John Clerk, 1st Baronet, described her in 1706 [...] "under a fit of the gout and in extreme pain and agony, and on this occasion everything about her was much in the same disorder as about the meanest of her subjects. Her face, which was red and spotted, was rendered something frightful by her negligent dress, and the foot affected was tied up with a poultice and some nasty bandages. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> affected by this sight...".|$|E
500|$|Wenger {{clarified}} Vieira's future {{after the}} match: [...] "My intention is clear: {{to keep him}} [...] The challenge {{in front of us}} is hugely difficult and we need a complete focus. I'm not resigned to let the story go on. It has all to be sorted out before the season." [...] He added that if Vieira chose to leave, the club could sufficiently replace him: [...] "We've worked very hard {{in the last five years}} to get good young players in and you saw that today." [...] Reyes, who was named man of the match, was frustrated at his missed chance early in the second half, but continued: [...] "I set one up and then scored myself so <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> happier." [...] Bergkamp was impressed with Fàbregas's performance in the match: [...] "Normally at 17, you might be a bit unsure when you step out. But with players like Cesc, the way he has developed in one year is quite amazing." ...|$|E
500|$|Imperator Nikolai <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> {{more heavily}} armored than the Imperatritsa Mariya-class ships, as {{the weight of}} armor for the former totaled [...] more than the older ships. Even so, Russian armor {{factories}} were unable to roll Krupp cemented armor plates of size greater than , compensating by increasing {{the thickness of the}} internal splinter bulkhead. The plates were sized to match the frames to provide support for their joints and they were joined together to better distribute the shock of a shell's impact.

Forward, the remaining portion of the waterline was protected by two strakes; the lower of which was initially [...] thick, but thinned to [...] It extended [...] above the design waterline. The upper strake was 100mm thick and extended up to the middle deck. Aft, the waterline belt was [...] thick and terminated in a 175-mm transverse bulkhead aft of the steering gear. The aft area between the upper and middle decks was the only unarmored area of the hull and had a [...] transverse bulkhead to protect the rear turret magazine from shells fired from rear bearings. The forward bulkhead was only [...] to serve as a splinter bulkhead as it was screened at all angles by side or deck armor. The [...] upper belt ran from the bow back to the aft turret and was [...] high. For the first time it was made of cemented armor which saved [...] and [...] in comparison to the uncemented plates used on the [...] and Imperatritsa Mariya classes respectively. Behind the side armor was a face-hardened inboard longitudinal splinter bulkhead that was 75mm thick between the middle and lower decks, but decreased to 25mm between the middle and upper decks. This sloped away {{from the edge of the}} lower deck to the lower edge of the armor belt with a thickness of 75mm.|$|E

[...] She felt {{there was no point}} in making art that someone had made decades or centuries before her, [...] "I had to create something totally new or not at all".

2500|$|In 1992 Gwynn {{ended the}} {{season on the}} DL for the third {{straight}} year. On September 8 in a 16-inning game in San Francisco, he had the third five-hit game of his career and his first since 1987. He sprained the medial collateral ligament in his left knee in the same game, and played just four more innings the rest of the season. He required arthroscopic surgery on the knee. Gwynn met Hall of Famer Ted Williams for the first time during the 1992 All-Star Game, which was hosted at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium (known later as Qualcomm Stadium). At the time, Gwynn considered himself to be an accomplished hitter, content to hit singles and doubles. Williams called Gwynn [...] "a big guy", capable of hitting for more power. He chided Gwynn for using a [...] "toothpick" [...] for a bat. His encounter with Williams spurred him to think more about hitting, and he began to hit for more power. [...] "I've never been a home run guy, never been a big RBI guy, but from that point to the end of my career, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> better at it", said Gwynn.|$|E

2500|$|Bellairs {{undertook}} The Face in the Frost {{while living}} in Britain and after reading J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, {{but it is not}} much like that book, apart from sharing the idea of a wizard who is palpably human and not a literary stereotype. Bellairs said of his third book: [...] "The Face in the Frost was an attempt to write in the Tolkien manner. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> taken by The Lord of the Rings and wanted to do a modest work on those lines. In reading the latter book I was {{struck by the fact that}} Gandalf was not much of a person—just a good guy. So I gave Prospero, my wizard, most of my phobias and crotchets. It was simply meant as entertainment and any profundity will have to be read in." [...] Writing in 1973, Lin Carter described The Face in the Frost as one of the three best fantasy novels to appear since The Lord of the Rings. Carter stated that Bellairs was planning a sequel to The Face in the Frost at the time. An unfinished sequel titled The Dolphin Cross was included in the 2009 anthology Magic Mirrors, which was published by the New England Science Fiction Association Press.|$|E

"Mabel," [...] Lunn wrote, [...] "was invincibly English and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> consoled {{during the}} dark days of 1940 {{by the fact}} that her {{confidence}} in final victory was never shaken." [...] Lunn once said something nice to their daughter Jaqueta about the latter's courage during an air raid. For this he was later reproved by Mabel. [...] "I want Jaqueta to feel," [...] she said, [...] "that the only thing which calls for comment in war time is cowardice." [...] Lunn was an agnostic when they married, and Mabel a devout Anglican, which she remained all her life. Lunn wrote: [...] "Mabel's husband, brother and three children became Catholics, but I never expected her to follow our example. Humanly speaking, she was bound to remain a member of the Church of England." [...] An Anglican vicar once asked Lunn to preach in his church. [...] "I asked you," [...] he said, [...] "because you have never written anything unpleasant about Anglicanism since you became a Roman Catholic." [...] But Lunn could never have written [...] "anything unpleasant" [...] about Mabel's Church, and when the first shock of his conversion was over, [...] "Mabel soon yielded not merely notional but real assent to the belief that the doctrinal differences which separated Mabel the Anglican from Arnold the Catholic were infinitely, yes infinitely, less than those which had separated Mabel the Anglican from Arnold the agnostic." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{top three}} drivers of both races {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and to participate later in a press conference. Leimer revealed that his objective for the feature race was to execute a fast getaway off the line, {{but in spite of}} struggling which almost lost him a position to Coletti, he declared himself [...] "very happy" [...] as he had waited for some time to win another race in the GP2 Series. When asked if he was not worried about heavy overtaking and tyre management, he replied yes, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> quicker than them so I was not using my tyres that much. It’s not the perfect situation for the tyres, but I still managed to save them." [...] Coletti spoke of his happiness over the job performed by his team but felt he could have pushed harder earlier in the race due to the fear of wearing his tyres out and thus elected to not take the risk. He stated that he did not inform his team that he observed Leimer entering the pit lane on the same lap as him and now believed he could have remained on track for one additional lap. Rossi revealed his apprehension about how his tyres would behave and was uncertain on how to push it. Nevertheless, he praised the effort his team put into the event and spoke of his happiness of finishing in third place.|$|E
