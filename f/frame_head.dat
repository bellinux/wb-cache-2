A {{method to}} extend Doppler {{frequency}} discrimination tolerance is proposed for quick acquirement PN-code and Doppler frequency in TDMA burst spread spectrum communication system. According to Doppler’s different {{impacts on the}} correlation Peak and data demodulation, PN-code is acquired through single channel matched-filters, and parallel multi-channel correlators {{are used in the}} data demodulation branch channel. Thus, with using <b>frame</b> <b>head</b> prior information in data channel instead of traditional Cross-Product Automatic Frequency Control (CPAFC), the Doppler frequency shift discrimination tolerance is extended. Simulation and experiment show that frequency and PN-code can be acquired in several data periods, and synchronous time and the resources consumption are effectively reduced...|$|E

The proposed algorithm of 3 D global motion estimation is given by solution of 6 linear equations for three extracted feature points of the real human head in each frame. Next there is presented an algorithm of texturing of 3 D wire frame model of human head after its estimated global motion. Texturing is carried out by two dimensional affine transform directly in synthesized frames. Both proposed algorithms can achieve very low bit rate in model based image coding...|$|E

The Viterbi algorithm was then used to continuously track the child's arms, once located, to allow the child to be identified within each frame. Full details of this process are available in [33]. The features were local and related to the segmented object of interest (the child), similar to many of the approaches discussed in the preceding section. Intuitively, the features needed to capture the motion of the head of the child, distinguishing rotational movements.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the various ways}} in which a group of contemporary writers from African and Indian cultures address spiritual affairs within their fictions. The neutral terminology "supra-human" indicates that the analysis treats each worldview as an equally valid explanation of the "reality" of phenomena beyond that which is materially verifiable and, at the same time, highlights the pantheistic nature of the human and numinous relationships which underpins these texts. The investigation shows that the cultural symbols employed both structurally and semantically by R. K Narayan, Nuruddin Farah, Bessie Head, Ben Okri and Salman Rushdie in their narratives describe the tensions that arise between a culture 2 ̆ 7 s sense of continuity and the historical and political pressures for change generated by their respective postcolonial conditions. Thus, the narratives {{are concerned with the}} maintenance of personal and societal identity, the restoration of a holistic form of meaning and the healing of psychological disjunctures caused by colonial and, in some instances, postcolonial fragmentation. All processes are found to involve, in one way or another, a perceived intervention of supra-human powers. Narayan 2 ̆ 7 s The Guide and Farah 2 ̆ 7 s Close Sesame survey the lives of two distinct "holy" men whose deaths (or transitions into an after-life) prove to be beneficial for their respective communities. The use of dreams or altered states of consciousness as healing mechanisms <b>frame</b> <b>Head</b> and Okri 2 ̆ 7 s narratives. The trauma of Head 2 ̆ 7 s life experience, as portrayed in A Question of Power, resembles a shamanic initiation ritual while Okri 2 ̆ 7 s answer to the malaise of Nigerian politics in his abiku novels lies in people 2 ̆ 7 s efforts to acquire shamanic perceptual and thus healing powers. In Midnight 2 ̆ 7 s Children, a clowning Rushdie treads a tenuous path between an acceptance of and a resistance to all possibilities that involve supra-human explanations. He advocates a new sense of spirituality forged by art 2 ̆ 7 s mediation of secular and sacred ideas but he cannot finally divest himself of his clownish fear of absurdity. In spite of their diverse means and backgrounds, the writers demonstrate that the human impulse to explain the workings of the universe is invariably countered by a need to maintain the potential of mystery within human understanding. Finally, the thesis contends that supra-human ideas continue to exert a powerful influence on the human imagination...|$|E

Karakterin duyguları dışındaki her şeyi önemsizleştirmesiyle körleştirici, sınırlayıcı bir etkisi de bulunmaktadır.

As cinema {{began to}} evolve {{as an art}} form, the {{contribution}} of the scale of shots on film narrative also began to increase. In the early days of cinema, the scale of shots were selected randomly and its important role in interpreting the image had not yet been properly understood. During that period, revitalization of the impression of real life was what mattered about the images being reflected on the screen. The films prior to the development of editing consisted of a single and fixed background and a variety of scale of shots are detected which varied according to the subject. It was seen that scale of Long shots and Medium shots have been used in the twelve films included in the screening of Lumiére Brothers at Paris Grand Café which is accepted as the beginning of the cinema. Along with development of edited and narrative film-making, it was discovered that different scales would contribute to the storytelling and to the emotional reaction of the audience; thus the general understanding of the role of scale of shots in supporting the narrative began to develop. The scale of shot, determines the distance between the subject within the frame and the apparatus. The closer the apparatus is to the subject, the subject is larger in the frame and the farther it is, the smaller is the subject within the frame. The scale of shots have been classified according to the image of the human body and has taken the names of the body parts; similarly, it is being used in the same way for inanimate entities. The shooting scale known as Extreme Long Shot or Long Shot shows the scene in a very general sense without much elaboration and documents a large area from a long distance. It is generally used to show and introduce the scenery. Full Shot emcompasses the full area of action within the scene and determines the relationship of the character with the environment. Middle Shot, shows the character above the knee and makes the relationship with the other people around the subject more prominent; facial expression becomes more clear and the bodily motion becomes more identifiable. Middle Shot designates the distance between the waist until the top of the head. On the other hand, a Close-up includes the head of the character in the frame. In Extreme Close-up, one part of the face such as the eyes or the lips covers the full <b>frame.</b> <b>Head,</b> shoulders and chest are Close-ups which are directly related to the face. During the initial years of the cinema, the audience have been quite affected with Close-up’s capacity to carry details and feelings. (Westwell, Kuhn, 2012, p. 374 - 375). Sergei Eisenstein, has manifested the effect of Close-up in cinema with the example that a Close-up shot of a cockroach is more frightening than a Long-Shot of a hundred elephants. The basis for the effect of the image of the cockroach and the elephant is the shock created in the way the subject is perceived because of deformation of the object while it reaches gigantic dimensions as it approaches. The discovery of Close-up goes back to early era films which is referred by Tom Gunning as ‘Cinema of Attractions’: ‘Close-up, which is magnificaton of the object through the lens developed by the new technology, is in itself an attraction. ’ (Gunning, 1989, s. 65). ‘Grandma’s Reading Glasses’ directed by George Albert Smith in 1900 and ‘The Big Swallow’ directed by James Williamson in 1901 are known to be the first short films where Close-up and Medium Shots have been used. More conscious usage of the Close-up {{in the form of an}} insert is encountered in David Griffith’s ‘The Life of an American Fireman’ (1901) and in the ‘The Lone Operator’ (1911). Jean Epstein indicates that Close-up must be ‘as effective as a needle prick with short duration attacks’ and will not provide a continuum of gratification when the duration is longer (Epstein, 1977, p. 9.). The reverse is seen in the ‘Close-up Cinema’ which is defined as a type of narrative where Close-ups are preferred to be outstretched throughout the film. It is seen that Close-up, especially that of the ‘face’ is an indispensable part of the films of such directors as Sergei Eisenstein, Carl Dreyer, Orson Welles, Ingmar Bergman, John Cassavetes, Robert Bresson, Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne Brothers. Close-up of the face - especially that of a woman- is in itself a storyteller for the directors. Jacques Aumont, indicates that the face becomes prominent with the contradiction between what is direct and what is indirect. Aumont, emphasises that a silent face is indirect from all angles and that it is not necessary to speak in order to exist. Face as a whole is a living organic object and for this reason it is directly connected (Aumont, 2003, s. 128 - 129). During the early days cinema, Close-up face depicted by Bela Balazs who has set forth one of the basic texts on Close-up emphasises the feeling of ‘intimacy’ and ‘closeness’ while Per Persson (1998) signifies the most important effect of Close-up as ‘threat’ and ‘intimacy’. When Persson researched into why intimacy is so important, he referred to the socio-psychologic research on personal distance and claimed that Close-up’s direct effect is a result of the attitude of people toward interpersonal distance between the image and the audience. 'Close-up Cinema' claims to have in itself the characteristics of face to be a means of expression. It determines the emotional context of the film through the face of the character and limits its point of view. In one way, the feeling that the audience is a close witness in the Close-up Cinema because of the giant dimensions of the face is a deception. Actually, Close-up Cinema gives the audience the narrowest scope and also the most limited information. But because of the illusion of cinema, the situation is being percieved as the reverse. On the other hand, generally the subject of such films identifies with the inner world of the character. In this sense, what is being told to the audience is hidden in the face of the character. Although the films 'Rosetta' and 'Blue is the Warmest Colour’ are very similar in their stylistic narrative focusing on the face of a young girl, they are positioned very differently from a variety of angles especially on the relationship they establish with the audience. ‘Rosetta’ and ‘Blue is the Warmest Colour’ are interesting example of Per Persson’s two different effects of Close-up which are threat and intimacy. The Close-ups used in the ‘Blue is the Warmest Colour’ exhibits the expression of changes in the emotions of Adele as the stylistic representation of elimination of ‘intimacy’ and personal distance and draws Adele ‘closer’ to the audience. On the other hand, contrary to ‘Blue is the Warmest Colour’, the similar narrative language used in ‘Rosetta’ is functioning as a disturbing and numbing instrument. Although the Close-ups in ‘Rosetta’ isolates the hardness of the outer world, it also shows the load this world places on Rosetta. As Rosetta is being documented closer to real life not only with her good sides but also with her errors, weaknesses and other negative aspects, a ‘distance’ of perception evolves between her and the audience instead of a full identification. Close-up has been used in Rosetta not as an instrument of identification of intimacy as generally used, but as an instrument of threat and desolation. The films ‘Rosetta’ and ‘Blue is the Warmest Colour’ prove how a Close-up can produce a contrary disposition through style of approach used in the two films which appear to be stylistically the same with regard to the general definition of Close-up in cinema language. Through the difference between the two films, the directors’ preferred point of view and the elements that they have brought in the foreground or put in the background, it is proven that there is versatility in the general interpretation while creating impressions with the scales of shot used in cinema...|$|E

40|$|While {{continuous}} head pose normalisation is not {{the goal}} of this paper, we demonstrate as a proof of concept {{that it is possible to}} extend the current method for continuous head pose normalisation. For dealing with faces in videos [1], continuous head pose normalisation is required. [2] argue that the appearance of a part does not changes with a subtle pose change, therefore a detector for part i in pose angle p can be shared for the same part i for a pose angle p + δ. Further experiments in [2] showed that sharing based mod-els and independent model have comparable performance. However, sharing based models are faster upto ten times as compared to the independent models [2]. The confi-dence maps based methods (CM-HPNPS and CM-HPNPI) can be extended from discrete to continuous by sharing part-specific regression models R, which are shared among neighboring pose angles. For a video V with n frames, the first <b>frame’s</b> <b>head</b> pose p and frontal reconstructed points are computed using Al-gorithm 2 (Same Algorithm 2 in main paper). For the con-secutive frames, the part-wise regression models specific to the pose computed for first frame are used for normalisa-tion (Algorithm 3). If the current <b>frame’s</b> <b>head</b> pose p + δ has a large difference from the current p, it may lead to a poor facial landmark reconstruction (based on low Score∗f, Algorithm 1 : Continuous head pose normalisation Require: Video V. p, L∗f = Algorithm 2 (V 1, p) {For the first frame} for i ← 2 to lenght(V) d...|$|R
