5|$|Kirchner's health {{first became}} {{a topic of}} public concern in 2005 when Noticias {{magazine}} reported that she might suffer from bipolar disorder. Journalist Franco Lindner interviewed the psychiatrist who treated her without revealing his name. Journalist Nelson Castro investigated further and discovered that the psychiatrist was Alejandro Lagomarsino, who died in 2011. Lagomarsino was the leading specialist {{in the treatment of}} bipolar disorder in Argentina. Castro's investigation revealed that Kirchner was treated by Lagomarsino for a short period. He could not determine the length of her treatment or the medicine she received, or whether another psychiatrist continued treating her or not. Castro considers that some of her outlandish phrases or projects, and her frequent periods of hiding from public view, may be explained by the disorder's periods of mania and depression, as well as being a regular political strategy. Eduardo Duhalde said that Néstor Kirchner once confided in him that she had a bipolar disorder, while she was having a violent outburst. During the United States diplomatic cables leak it was revealed that Hillary Clinton questioned Kirchner's mental health and asked the US embassy whether she was receiving treatment or not; she later apologized to Kirchner for those leaks. Kirchner said in her book La Presidenta that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>a</b> misunderstanding; it is her sister who suffers from bipolar disorder.|$|E

In order to placate these concerns, the teleplay was assigned to be finalized by John Shiban and Vince Gilligan. Once the script was finished, Spotnitz felt the story had become much more understandable; he was particularly pleased with the way Shiban and Gilligan showed Mulder and Scully stepping on the mushrooms {{as a way to}} subtly cue their initial exposure to the hallucinogenic mushroom. Gilligan noted that [...] "another really important thing we did was making sure that the audience didn't think that Mulder and Scully weren't really in jeopardy—that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>a</b> dream, like that whole season of Dallas a few years back.

The four started up Revolution Software, initially based in Hull, with a 10 thousand pounds loan from Cecil's mother. Cecil wanted the game to differ from popular Sierra games at the time, saying: [...] "While I enjoyed Sierra games, I felt that there had to be more than yet again saving King Graham of Daventry from a – let’s be frank – fairly unlikely series of events. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>a</b> little bit twee. So we {{came up with the idea}} of writing an adventure game that did not take itself too seriously, but did have a serious story – something in-between Lucasarts and Sierra."

500|$|In any case, {{the peace}} {{turned out to}} be of short duration. On 18 May 1803, {{slightly}} {{more than a year after}} the peace, war resumed. Napoleon was now intent on the destruction of Great Britain by culminating in an ambitious planned invasion. The Batavian Republic was to play a major supporting role in this. As the Franco-Batavian alliance's embodiment, the Staatsbewind was forced to assent to a Convention bringing the total of French and Batavian forces in the Netherlands to 35,000. In addition, 9,000 Batavian troops were earmarked for the proposed overseas expedition. Even more importantly, the Dutch were to supply, by December 1803, five ships-of-the-line, five frigates, 100 gun boats, and 250 flat-bottomed transport craft, capable of holding 60–80 men. In total the Dutch were meant to provide transport for 25,000 men and 2,500 horses; the major part of Napoleon's invasion [...] "armada", and all at Dutch expense. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>a</b> fantasy on Napoleon's part, but this did not diminish the real burden it imposed on the finances of the Republic, and on its economy.|$|E

[...] Discussing her casting a year into her time on the show, Lewington assessed: [...] "I enjoy it more as I wade through the years. As with any ensemble work, the more time spent as a team, working together and discovering each others rhythms, dynamics and struggles, the better. And because of that, more fun.

[...] The Sunday Express claimed, quoting [...] "renowned Royal biographer Hugo Vickers" [...] and other [...] "Royal insiders", that because of the book's contents, ElizabethII would withhold granting Blair the Order of the Thistle, an honour which is bestowed at the sovereign's personal prerogative and normally given almost automatically to leaders of Scottish descent after leaving office. Gordon Brown was said to be [...] "seething" [...] and [...] "dismayed" [...] over the criticism he received from Blair in the book, but had told aides not to criticise it. Ed Balls, a Brown ally who served in his government as Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families said, [...] "It would have been much better if the memoirs had been a celebration of success rather than recriminations. In that sense I thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>a</b> bit sad. It was so one-sided. I didn't think it was comradely." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} of Rita {{has been well}} received by critics, who praised Benz’s portrayal. Eric Goldman of IGN has said, “Dexter does a solid job of developing {{the roles of the}} supporting cast, with Rita, Deb, Doakes and LaGuerta all getting a good amount of development”. [...] He added, “There were a couple of forced moments in [...] "Popping Cherry", most notably the drug dealer who came to Rita's house, in broad daylight, demanding money for her ex-husband's debts; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>a</b> bit over the top and cliché. On the other hand, it was interesting to note Dexter's inaction in that scene, making one wonder if perhaps he fears that any public display of physical defense, even for Rita, might result in him going too far and revealing what he is." [...] Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post has said, [...] "Rita always felt like the light in that dark show", and [...] "In the beginning Rita was the vessel through which the audience could love Dexter." [...] UGO.com placed Rita Bennett 7th on a list of [...] "Top 11 Girlfriends on TV".

500|$|Gibbes {{handed over}} command of No.3 Squadron to Squadron Leader Brian Eaton on 19April 1943. With his rank of {{squadron}} leader confirmed the same month, Gibbes departed North Africa to serve at RAAF Overseas Headquarters, London, until October. While in England he converted to de Havilland Mosquito night fighters and was slated to command No.464 Squadron RAAF, but was instead posted back to Australia, via Canada. There, according to Gibbes, {{he gave a}} series of morale-building lectures on air combat to Empire Air Training Scheme students: [...] "So I, you know, went round and lied like hell. I said that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>a</b> [...]" [...] In January 1944, he joined No.2 Operational Training Unit (OTU) at Mildura, Victoria, becoming chief flying instructor in March. He worked with Clive Caldwell, Australia's top-scoring ace, to improve the success rate at No.2 OTU by personally selecting the most promising pilots from local service flying training schools. Gibbes was promoted to temporary wing commander on 1July. In October he was posted to Darwin in the Northern Territory, flying Supermarine Spitfires as wing leader of No.80 Wing. The role made him deputy to Group Captain Caldwell, the wing's commanding officer. Gibbes later suffered burns in a crash landing following engine failure. In December he met, in his own words, [...] "a little dark-haired popsy" [...] named Jeannine Ince, a volunteer with the Red Cross who had nursed him in hospital. They married on 23January 1945.|$|E

Halo would be developed as an exclusive, first-person shooter title for the Xbox. The reasons for Bungie accepting Microsoft's offer were varied. Jones stated that [...] "I don't remember the details exactly, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>a</b> blur. We'd been talking to people for years and years—before we even published Marathon, Activision made a serious offer. But the chance to work on Xbox—the chance to work with a company that took the games seriously. Before that we worried that we'd get bought by someone who just wanted Mac ports or didn't have a clue." [...] Martin O'Donnell, who had joined Bungie as an employee only ten days before the merger was announced, remembers that the stability of the Xbox as a development platform was not the only benefit. Shortly before Myth IIs release, it was discovered versions of the game could erase a player's hard drive; the glitch led to a massive recall of the games right before they shipped, which cost Bungie nearly one million dollars. O'Donnell stated in a Bungie podcast that this recall created some financial uncertainty, although accepting the offer was not something Bungie [...] "had to do." [...] Seropian and Jones had refused to accept Microsoft's offer until the entire studio agreed to the buyout.|$|E
