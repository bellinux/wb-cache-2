50|$|In Germany, clinker bricks (German: Klinkerziegel) {{are named}} {{according}} to the German Institute for Standardization's DIN 105. They differ between full clinker (KMz) with a density of 2.0 kg / dm ³ to 2.2 kg / dm ³ and high hole clinker (KHLz) with a density of 1.6 kg / dm ³ to 1.8 kg / dm ³. Because of their low porosity, clinker bricks are inferior thermal insulators, compared to normal bricks. Canal clinkers are named {{according to the}} German Institute for Standardization’s DIN 4051. Clinkers are <b>frost</b> <b>resisting</b> and, thus are suited particularly for facades. The formats of the clinker stones are named according to the German Institute for Standardization’s DIN 1053. Base for the different formats is the normal format (NF) with length 240 mm, width 115 mm and height 71 mm. For facade layouts architects also order clinkers produced in special dimensions.|$|E
40|$|A {{high-performance}} reactive powder concrete (RPC) {{was prepared}} with river sand, and the {{maximum particle size}} is 1. 25 [*]mm, under the 80 °C steam curing condition. It is tested completely in terms of strength, uniaxial compressive stress-strain relation, flexural load-deflection relation, and <b>frost</b> <b>resisting</b> durability, and {{the results indicate that}} the concrete is suitable to RPC 200. The uniaxial compressive stress-strain curve shows a linear-elastic behaviour up to explosive failure, which is different from that of conventional concrete. High postpeak load carrying capacity shows high toughness and reinforcing effect of the steel fibers. The RPC has not only much higher limit strain than conventional concrete, but also excellent <b>frost</b> <b>resisting</b> durability at the fifth day of age exceeding F 300. Furthermore, the RPC satisfactorily meets the requirement of practical application for Xialouzi Bridge built with the RPC totally according to the calculation with finite element analysis software MIDAS/Civil. And the static loading testing result suggests that design of the bridge meets the utilization requirements...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. According the test, {{this paper}} {{discussed}} {{the relationships among}} nano SiO 2 content of nano SiO 2 cement concrete,air content, water-cement ratio and frost resistance property. Meanwhile, the relationship among the bubble parameter, structure of holes and the frost resistance is primarily discussed. The {{results show that the}} concrete mixed with some nano SiO 2, with the increase of impervious holes in hardened cement paste, compared with ordinary concrete,both the ability of freezing-thawing resisting and compression strength will have an improvement. What’s more, when mixed with the air-entraining agent, freezing-thawing cycles number will have an obvious increase. When water-cement ratio is 0. 35 - 0. 39, the ability of <b>frost</b> <b>resisting</b> is very high but when water-cement ratio is larger than 0. 39, freezing-thawing resisting performance is substantial decline...|$|E
5000|$|The {{varieties}} lepidophylla {{has been}} described as [...] "an attractive shrub" [...] and has been in cultivation for many years. It is usually propagated from cuttings and although slow-growing at first, is <b>frost</b> tolerant and <b>resists</b> insect and fungus attacks. Some specimens of var. quantula have been propagated and grown at Kings Park.|$|R
50|$|It is a tree of {{the genus}} Pistacia. It {{is a member of}} the same genus as pistachio, terebinth, and mastic. The Pistacia genus ranges from shrubs to trees adapted to drought and the Mediterranean climate. It is {{stronger}} than Pistacia terebinthus, where it is used as rootstock in Ukraine and the United States for growing Pistacia vera, but <b>resists</b> <b>frost</b> better than P. terebinthus.|$|R
50|$|Annona cornifolia is a slow-growing shrub {{native to}} savannas and {{fields of the}} Cerrado region of Brazil, {{reaching}} a height of 4-5 meters. It presers a sunny position on acidic, sandy soils and needs good drainage to thrive. After 4-5 years, if grown in full sun, it produces a blood red fruit, which has an orange aromatic, sweet and highly appreciated flesh containing few seeds. The tree <b>resists</b> <b>frosts</b> to -3°C. It is little known outside of its native range. Propagation is by seeds which have orthodox storage behavior and may take up to 18 months to germinate.|$|R
40|$|The pore {{structure}} {{is of great}} importance for a materials ability to hold and transport gas and moisture. In lime plaster, it affects hardening, carbonation as well as durability against frost damage. In the present paper, eleven mixtures of lime mortar were studied with respect to frost damages. The binders used were lime slaked in four different ways, hydraulic lime and cement. Several analyses were made to characterize the transport properties and the {{pore structure}} of the materials; density, porosity, sorption curves, capillary water suction and thin sections. This study shows {{that there is a}} correlation between pore structure and important material properties. By studying these parameters, it is possible to get a good picture of the materials ability to <b>resist</b> <b>frost</b> damages. The study also gives an indication of what materials in the mortar such as binders, aggregates and water, give a good pore structure...|$|R
50|$|In the Age of Apocalypse, Pierce was {{the leader}} of the Reavers, a band of human assassins {{enhanced}} by Apocalypse's techno-organic virus. Thanks to the virus, Pierce and his band of assassins become cyborgs with regenerative abilities and the power to assimilate both organic and non-organic material to mutate themselves. Pierce infiltrated the territory of the Human High Council in an attempt to destroy the Council fleet and later attempted to kill Gateway, an ally of the HHC. After the fleet was assembled for an attack on Apocalypse's empire, Pierce infected Carol Danvers with the remains of the Reaver Vultura to aid him in the destruction of the fleet. During his attack he also used Brian Braddock, who was under Apocalypse's mind control, to kill Emma <b>Frost,</b> though he <b>resisted</b> Pierce's orders, for which Pierce killed him. In the end, Pierce was destroyed by Weapon X.|$|R
60|$|It has {{sometimes}} been said that our domestic races do not differ in constitutional peculiarities, but this cannot be maintained. In our improved cattle, pigs, etc., the period of maturity, including that of the second dentition, has been much hastened. The period of gestation varies much, and has been modified in a fixed manner {{in one or two}} cases. In some breeds of poultry and pigeons the period at which the down and the first plumage are acquired, differs. The number of moults through which the larvae of silk-moths pass, varies. The tendency to fatten, to yield much milk, to produce many young or eggs at a birth or during life, differs in different breeds. We find different degrees of adaptation to climate, and different tendencies to certain diseases, to the attacks of parasites, and to the action of certain vegetable poisons. With plants, adaptation to certain soils, the power of <b>resisting</b> <b>frost,</b> the period of flowering and fruiting, the duration of life, the period of shedding the leaves or of retaining them throughout the winter, the proportion and nature of certain chemical compounds in the tissues or seeds, all vary.|$|R
40|$|Delayed frost {{growth on}} superhydrophobic {{surfaces}} (SHSs) with jumping condensates {{has been found}} by many researchers recently. However, the mechanism of this phenomenon has not been elucidated clearly. In this study, copper SHSs with or without jumping condensates were selected as the substrates for observing condensation icing at a relative humidity (RH) of 60 %. The results showed that only SHS with jumping condensates showed delayed condensation icing. Moreover, when such SHSs were placed upward and the surface temperature was held at - 10 degrees C, some discrete frozen drops first appeared on the SHSs. The following icing mainly occurred on these discrete global crystals and then expanded around them until covering the entire surface. Little macroscopic interdrop freezing phenomenon was found. The growth of the frost front is mainly dominated by jumping freezing (the condensed droplets jumped onto the ice crystals and were frozen) or direct vaporice deposition. Using microscopy, we found interdrop freezing occurred, {{in addition to the}} two mechanisms mentioned above. By placing the SHS downward at - 10 degrees C and intentionally introducing or eliminating tiny dusts, we confirmed that there were no superhydrophobic defects on our SHSs. The discrete frozen drops first appearing on the SHSs were triggered by tiny dusts falling on the surface before or during condensation icing. The key approach in delaying or <b>resisting</b> <b>frost</b> growth on SHSs with jumping condensates is to retard initial ice crystal formation, e. g., eliminating the edge effect and keeping the SHSs clean...|$|R
