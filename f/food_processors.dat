5|$|Minnesota's {{earliest}} industries were fur {{trading and}} agriculture. The city of Minneapolis grew around the flour mills powered by St. Anthony Falls. Although {{less than one}} percent of the population is now employed in the agricultural sector, it remains a major part of the state's economy, ranking sixth in the nation in the value of products sold. The state is the U.S.'s largest producer of sugar beets, sweet corn, and green peas for processing, and farm-raised turkeys. Minnesota is also a large producer of corn and soybeans. Minnesota has the most food cooperatives per capita in the United States. Forestry remains strong, including logging, pulpwood processing and paper production, and forest products manufacturing. Minnesota was famous for its soft-ore mines, which produced a significant portion of the world's iron ore for over a century. Although the high-grade ore is now depleted, taconite mining continues, using processes developed locally to save the industry. In 2004, the state produced 75 percent of the country's usable iron ore. The mining boom created the port of Duluth which continues to be important for shipping ore, coal, and agricultural products. The manufacturing sector now includes technology and biomedical firms in addition to the older <b>food</b> <b>processors</b> and heavy industry. The nation's first indoor shopping mall was Edina's Southdale Center and its largest is Bloomington's Mall of America.|$|E

50|$|Harrison's {{most famous}} design, which {{incorporated}} this philosophy, was the Cuisinart <b>food</b> <b>processor.</b> Harrison redesigned the <b>food</b> <b>processor</b> with large and easily pressed buttons, large and easily grasped handles, and a bold readable typeface. The new design was a success. By designing a <b>food</b> <b>processor</b> {{that could be}} used by consumers with arthritis and/or poor eyesight, Harrison had created a product that was accessible to people {{with a wide range of}} abilities. The Cuisinart <b>food</b> <b>processor</b> was extremely popular with the general public.|$|R

25|$|The New Leaf potato, a GM food {{developed}} using {{naturally occurring}} bacteria {{found in the}} soil known as Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), was made to provide in-plant protection from the yield-robbing Colorado potato beetle.

25|$|In many ants and termites, on {{the other}} hand, workers vary in both size and bodily proportions, which have a bimodal distribution. This is present in {{approximately}} one in six ant genera. In most of these there are two developmentally distinct pathways, or castes, into which workers can develop. Typically members of the smaller caste are called minors {{and members of the}} larger caste are called majors or soldiers. There is often variation in size within each caste. The term soldiers may be apt, as in Cephalotes, but in many species members of the larger caste act primarily as foragers or <b>food</b> <b>processors.</b> In a few ant species, such as certain Pheidole species, there is a third caste, called supersoldiers.|$|E

25|$|Between 1985 and 1987, Associated Dairies Group PLC, and Asda Stores Ltd, {{merged with}} MFI (Mullard Furniture Industries) {{and the group}} was renamed Asda-MFI Group plc. The other {{companies}} in the group were Associated Dairies Limited, the furniture retailer MFI and Allied Carpets. After the sale of MFI in 1987, the company name changed to Asda Group plc. The Associated Dairies division was renamed as Associated Fresh Foods, the abattoir and meat processing plant at Lofthouse, near Wakefield, which supplied fresh meat to all Asda stores was renamed as Lofthouse Foods. The focus of the group had switched firmly by the late 1980s to the Asda store chain. In 1988, Asda had also acquired the Waring & Gillow, Colonel Gee, and Maple & Co furniture brands and Maples stores. Co-branded stores under the Allied Maples banner had appeared on major retail parks. But, in 1993, the whole fresh food division, including the Asda Produce, fruit and vegetable sourcing, processing and packing plant in Normanton, Wakefield, was sold off in a management buyout to other dairy and <b>food</b> <b>processors.</b> In the same year, Maples was divested in a management buyout, and became an independent company again until it went into liquidation in 1997, and the stores were bought out by the now defunct Allders department store chain. Allied Carpets {{and some of the}} co-branded Allied Maples stores were sold off to the now defunct Carpetland. This means that Asda has since had no connection with any of the firms from which its name was derived. Having effectively outgrown and divested of its original parent company, Associated Dairies, where it was only initially believed in 1965, that the tiny Asda supermarket division would only be a minor contributor to the dairy divisions profits, which at that time consisted of their wider and more profitable interests, including farms, dairies, butcher's shops, bakeries and doorstep milk deliveries.|$|E
500|$|The parsnip is a {{biennial}} {{plant with}} a rosette of roughly hairy leaves {{that has a}} pungent odor when crushed. Parsnips are grown for their fleshy, edible, cream-colored taproots. The roots are generally smooth, although lateral roots sometimes form. Most are cylindrical, but some cultivars have a more bulbous shape, which generally tends to be favored by <b>food</b> <b>processors</b> as it is more resistant to breakage. The plant's apical meristem produces a rosette of pinnate leaves, each with several pairs of leaflets with toothed margins. The lower leaves have short stems, the upper ones are stemless, and the terminal leaves have three lobes. The leaves are once- or twice-pinnate with broad, ovate, sometimes lobed leaflets with toothed margins; they grow up to [...] long.|$|E

2500|$|Legislation {{similar to}} the FQPA was drafted and {{presented}} to Congress in 1995 but was never acted on. In 1996, the political landscape had changed and new pressures to act on pesticide control reform surfaced. In 1991, a coalition of environmental groups sued the EPA for failing to enforce the Delaney clause. The Delaney clause, an amendment of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, banned all food that contained any trace amount of any pesticide that may cause cancer. Although the EPA argued that the legislation was outdated and should {{not apply to the}} current situation, the coalition won in 1995 and the EPA was slated to ban 80 pesticides in late 1996. Under these new, more urgent circumstances, Congress was able to pass a bill that was celebrated by both sides of the debate; farmers, <b>food</b> <b>processors</b> and pesticide manufactures were glad to see the Delaney Clause go, while environmental groups and consumer advocates were pleased to have a formalized safety standard with an added emphasis on children. John Cady, president of the National <b>Food</b> <b>Processors</b> Association, praised the legislation for being [...] "...based on modern, real-world science".|$|E
