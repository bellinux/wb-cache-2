Methods: This is an institutional review board approved, retrospective study.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{examine whether}} {{reactions}} of blood pressure to psychological stress predict future blood pressure. DESIGN [...] Blood pressure was recorded at a medical screening examination after which pressor reactions to a psychological stress task were determined. <b>Follow</b> <b>up</b> measurement of {{blood pressure was}} undertaken, on average, 4. 9 years later. SETTING [...] 20 civil service departments in London. SUBJECTS [...] 1003 male civil servants aged between 35 and 55 years at entry to the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE [...] Blood pressure at <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> screening. RESULTS [...] Reactions of systolic blood pressure to stress correlated positively with systolic blood pressure at <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> screening (r = 0. 22, P < 0. 01). The dominant correlate of <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> blood pressure was blood pressure at initial screening (r = 0. 60; P < 0. 01 between initial and <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> systolic blood pressure; r = 0. 59, P < 0. 01 between initial and <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> diastolic blood pressure). Stepwise multiple regression analysis indicated that reactions to the stressor provided minimal prediction of <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> blood pressure over and above that afforded by blood pressure at initial screening. In the case of <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> systolic blood pressure, systolic reactions to stress accounted for only 1 % of <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> variance; systolic blood pressure at initial screening accounted for 34 %. With regard to diastolic blood pressure at <b>follow</b> <b>up,</b> the independent contribution from diastolic reactions to stress was less than 1 %. CONCLUSION [...] Pressor reactions to psychological stress provide minimal independent prediction of blood pressure at <b>follow</b> <b>up.</b> Measurement of reactivity is not a useful clinical index of the course of future blood pressure...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the relation of}} cardiac autoantibody and disease status in a consecutive series of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy by prospective antibody testing at diagnosis and at <b>follow</b> <b>up.</b> METHODS: Antibody status was assessed by indirect immunofluorescence in 110 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (85 male, mean (SD) age 44 (13) years) at diagnosis and at <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> (mean (SD) 14 (12) months); in 57 of them cardiac specific anti-alpha myosin antibody titres were also measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Patients underwent complete evaluation at diagnosis and clinical and non-invasive assessment at <b>follow</b> <b>up,</b> including exercise testing with maximal oxygen consumption measurements. RESULTS: The frequency of cardiac specific antibodies by immunofluorescence was lower at <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> than at diagnosis (28 (25 %) v 11 (10 %), P = 0. 002). Mean (SEM) anti-alpha myosin antibody titres at <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> were also lower than at diagnosis (0. 24 (0. 02) v 0. 30 (0. 02), P = 0. 038); 24 % of patients at diagnosis and 14 % at <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> had an abnormal ELISA result. None of the patients who were negative by immunofluorescence or ELISA at diagnosis became positive at <b>follow</b> <b>up.</b> Presence of antibody at diagnosis was associated with milder symptoms and greater exercise capacity at <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> and persistence of antibody at <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> was associated with stable disease and milder symptoms at diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac specific autoantibodies in dilated cardiomyopathy become undetectable with disease progression; this is a recognised feature of other autoimmune conditions, such as type 1 diabetes. Detection of these antibodies at diagnosis and at <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> may provide a non-invasive marker of early dilated cardiomyopathy...|$|R
