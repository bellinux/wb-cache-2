5|$|Plant use of <b>endophytic</b> {{fungi in}} defense {{is a very}} common phenomenon. Most plants have endophytes, {{microbial}} organisms that live within them. While some cause disease, others protect plants from herbivores and pathogenic microbes. Endophytes can help the plant by producing toxins harmful to other organisms that would attack the plant, such as alkaloid producing fungi which are common in grasses such as tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea).|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanical}} pressure {{exerted by}} the appressorium is generated from physiological processes that increase intracellular turgor by producing osmolytes such as glycerol. Adaptations {{such as these}} are complemented by hydrolytic enzymes secreted into the environment to digest large organic molecules—such as polysaccharides, proteins, and lipids—into smaller molecules that may then be absorbed as nutrients. The vast majority of filamentous fungi grow in a polar fashion (extending in one direction) by elongation at the tip (apex) of the hypha. Other forms of fungal growth include intercalary extension (longitudinal expansion of hyphal compartments that are below the apex) {{as in the case}} of some <b>endophytic</b> fungi, or growth by volume expansion during the development of mushroom stipes and other large organs. Growth of fungi as multicellular structures consisting of somatic and reproductive cells—a feature independently evolved in animals and plants—has several functions, including the development of fruit bodies for dissemination of sexual spores (see above) and biofilms for substrate colonization and intercellular communication.|$|E
5|$|In agriculture, fungi may {{be useful}} if they {{actively}} compete for nutrients and space with pathogenic microorganisms such as bacteria or other fungi via the competitive exclusion principle, or if they are parasites of these pathogens. For example, certain species {{may be used to}} eliminate or suppress the growth of harmful plant pathogens, such as insects, mites, weeds, nematodes, and other fungi that cause diseases of important crop plants. This has generated strong interest in practical applications that use these fungi in the biological control of these agricultural pests. Entomopathogenic fungi can be used as biopesticides, as they actively kill insects. Examples that have been used as biological insecticides are Beauveria bassiana, Metarhizium spp, Hirsutella spp, Paecilomyces (Isaria) spp, and Lecanicillium lecanii. <b>Endophytic</b> fungi of grasses of the genus Neotyphodium, such as N. coenophialum, produce alkaloids that are toxic to a range of invertebrate and vertebrate herbivores. These alkaloids protect grass plants from herbivory, but several endophyte alkaloids can poison grazing animals, such as cattle and sheep. Infecting cultivars of pasture or forage grasses with Neotyphodium endophytes is one approach being used in grass breeding programs; the fungal strains are selected for producing only alkaloids that increase resistance to herbivores such as insects, while being non-toxic to livestock.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, taxol was {{discovered}} {{as a natural}} product in a newly described <b>endophytic</b> fungus living in the yew tree. It has since been reported {{in a number of}} other <b>endophytic</b> fungi, including Nodulisporium sylviforme, Alternaria taxi, Cladosporium cladosporioides MD2, Metarhizium anisopliae, Aspergillus candidus MD3, Mucor rouxianus sp., Chaetomella raphigera, Phyllosticta tabernaemontanae, Phomopsis, Pestalotiopsis pauciseta, Phyllosticta citricarpa, Podocarpus, Fusarium solani, Pestalotiopsis terminaliae, Pestalotiopsis breviseta, Botryodiplodia theobromae Pat., Gliocladium sp., Alternaria alternata var. monosporus, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Nigrospora sp., Pestalotiopsis versicolor, and Taxomyces andreanae. However, there has been contradictory evidence for its production by endophytes, with other studies finding independent production is unlikely.|$|E
25|$|Plant use of <b>endophytic</b> {{fungi in}} defense occurs when <b>endophytic</b> fungi, which live symbiotically with the {{majority}} of plants by entering their cells, are utilized as an indirect defense against herbivores. In exchange for carbohydrate energy resources, the fungus provides benefits to the plant which can include increased water or nutrient uptake and protection from phytophagous insects, birds or mammals. Once associated, the fungi alter nutrient content of the plant and enhance or begin production of secondary metabolites. The change in chemical composition acts to deter herbivory by insects, grazing by ungulates and/or oviposition by adult insects. Endophyte-mediated defense can also be effective against pathogens and non-herbivory damage.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} <b>endophytic</b> fungi on the {{chemical}} composition of {{plants have been}} known by humans for centuries {{in the form of}} poisoning and disease as well as medicinal uses. Especially noted were impacts on agricultural products and livestock. Recognition and study of the mutualism did not begin in earnest until the 1980s when early studies on the impacts of alkaloids on animal herbivory confirmed their importance as agents of deterrence. Biologists began to characterize the diversity of <b>endophytic</b> mutualists through primitive techniques such as isozyme analysis and measuring the effects of infection on herbivores. Basic descriptive accounts of these previously neglected species of fungus became a major goal for mycologists, and a lot of research focus shifted to associates of the grass family (Poaceae) in particular, because of the large number of species which represent economically important commodities to humans.|$|E
25|$|Some {{chemical}} defenses {{once thought}} to be produced by the plant have since been shown to be synthesized by <b>endophytic</b> fungi. The chemical basis of insect resistance in endophyte-plant defense mutualisms has been most extensively studied in the perennial ryegrass and three major classes of secondary metabolites are found: indole diterpenes, ergot alkaloids and peramine. Related compounds are found across the range of <b>endophytic</b> fungal associations with plants. The terpenes and alkaloids are inducible defenses which act similarly to defensive compounds produced by plants and are highly toxic {{to a wide variety of}} phytophagous insects as well as mammalian herbivores. Peramine occurs widely in endophyte-associated grasses and may also act as a signal to invertebrate herbivores of the presence of more dangerous defensive chemicals. Terpenoids and ketones have been linked to protection from specialist and generalist herbivores (both insect and vertebrate) across the higher plants.|$|E
25|$|Fungal endophytes {{which provide}} {{defensive}} services to their host plants may exert selective pressures favouring association through enhanced fitness relative to uninfected hosts. The fungus Neotyphodium spp. infects grasses and increases fitness under conditions {{with high levels}} of interspecific competition. It does this through a combination of benefits including anti-herbivore defenses and growth promoting factors. The customary assumption that plant growth promotion is the main way fungal mutualists improve fitness under attack from herbivores is changing; alteration of plant chemical composition and induced resistance are now recognized as factors of great importance in improving competitive ability and fecundity. Plants undefended by chemical or physical means at certain points in their life histories have higher survival rates when infected with beneficial <b>endophytic</b> fungi. The general trend of plants infected with mutualistic fungi outperforming uninfected plants under moderate to high herbivory exerts selection for higher levels of fungal association as herbivory levels increase. Unsurprisingly, low to moderate levels of herbivore damage also increases the levels of infection by beneficial <b>endophytic</b> fungi.|$|E
25|$|Secondary {{metabolites}} {{may also}} affect the behaviour of natural enemies of herbivorous species in a multi-trophic defense/predation association. For instance, terpenoid production attracts natural enemies of herbivores to damaged plants. These enemies can reduce numbers of invertebrate herbivores substantially {{and may not}} be attracted in the absence of <b>endophytic</b> symbionts. Multi-trophic interactions can have cascading consequences for the entire plant community, with the potential to vary widely depending on the combination of fungal species infecting a given plant and the abiotic conditions.|$|E
25|$|Exserohilum rostratumis being {{incorporated}} in technologies for controlling Cyperus iria a common weed in the rice fields of Southeast Asia. A study determined that Exserohilum rostratum {{has the potential}} to act as a biocontrol agent incorporated with bentazone to control rice field weeds. This species has also been proposed as an antimalarial agent. E. rostratum was found to be a fungal strain <b>endophytic</b> in the plant species Stemona. Monocerin and 11-hydroxymonocerin were isolated from these cultures, which have applications in antimalarial drugs.|$|E
25|$|This {{differs from}} {{other forms of}} {{indirect}} defense in that the fungi live within the plant cells and directly alter their physiology. In contrast, other biotic defenses such as predators or parasites of the herbivores consuming a plant are normally attracted by volatile organic compounds (known as semiochemicals) released following damage or by food rewards and shelter produced by the plant. These defenders vary in the time spent with the plant: from long enough to oviposit to remaining there for numerous generations, as in the ant-acacia mutualism. <b>Endophytic</b> fungi tend {{to live with the}} plant over its entire life.|$|E
25|$|Some endomycorrhizae may {{actually}} promote herbivore damage by making plants {{more susceptible to}} it. For example, some oak fungal endophytes are positively correlated with the levels of damage from leaf miners (Cameraria spp.), although negatively correlated with number of larvae present due to a reduction of oviposition on infected plants, which partially mitigates the higher damage rate. This continuum between mutualism and pathogenicity of <b>endophytic</b> fungi has major implications for plant fitness depending on the species of partners available in a given environment; mutualist status is conditional in a way similar to pollination and can shift {{from one to the}} other just as frequently.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to continuing descriptive {{studies of the}} effects of infection by defense mutualist endophytes, there has been a sharp {{increase in the number of}} studies which delve further into the ecology of plant-fungus associations and especially their multi-trophic impacts. The processes by which <b>endophytic</b> fungi alter plant physiology and volatile chemical levels are virtually unknown, and limited current results show a lack of consistency under differing environmental conditions, especially differing levels of herbivory. Studies comparing the relative impacts of mutualistic endophytes on inducible defenses and tolerance show a central function of infection in determining both responses to herbivore damage. On the whole, molecular mechanisms behind endophyte-mediated plant defense has been an increasing focus of research over the past ten years.|$|E
25|$|Studies of fungal {{infection}} consistently reveal that plants with endophytes {{are less likely}} to suffer substantial damage, and herbivores feeding on infected plants are less productive. There are multiple modes through which <b>endophytic</b> fungi reduce insect herbivore damage, including avoidance (deterrence), reduced feeding, reduced development rate, reduced growth and/or population growth, reduced survival and reduced oviposition. Vertebrate herbivores such as birds, rabbits and deer show the same patterns of avoidance and reduced performance. Even below-ground herbivores such as nematodes and root-feeding insects are reduced by endophyte infection. The strongest evidence for anti-herbivore benefits of fungal endophytes come from studies of herbivore populations being extirpated when allowed to feed only on infected plants. Examples of local extinction have been documented in crickets, larval armyworms and flour beetles.|$|E
25|$|The {{secondary}} chemicals {{produced by}} <b>endophytic</b> fungi when {{associated with their}} host plants can be very harmful to mammals including livestock and humans, causing more than 600 million dollars in losses due to dead livestock every year. For example, the ergot alkaloids produced by Claviceps spp. have been dangerous contaminants of rye crops for centuries. When not lethal, defense chemicals produced by fungal endophytes may lead to lower productivity in cows and other livestock feeding on infected forage. Reduced nutritional quality of infected plant tissue also lowers the performance of farm animals, compounding the effect of reduced feed uptake when provided with infected plant matter. Reduced frequency of pregnancy and birth has also been reported in cattle and horses fed with infected forage. Consequently, the dairy and meat-production industries must endure substantial economic losses.|$|E
25|$|Fungal {{resistance}} to herbivores represents an environmentally sustainable alternative to pesticides that has experienced reasonable success in agricultural applications. The organic farming industry has embraced mycorrhizal symbionts as one tool for improving yields and protecting plants from damage. Infected crops of soybean, ribwort plantain, cabbage, banana, coffee bean plant and tomato all show markedly {{lower rates of}} herbivore damage compared to uninfected plants. <b>Endophytic</b> fungi show great promise {{as a means of}} indirect biocontrol in large-scale agricultural applications. The potential for biotechnology to improve crop populations through inoculation with modified fungal strains could reduce toxicity to livestock and improve yields of human-consumed foods. The endophyte, either with detrimental genes removed or beneficial new genes added, is used as a surrogate host to transform the crops genetically. An endophyte of ryegrass has been genetically transformed in this way and used successfully to deter herbivores.|$|E
25|$|Many {{secondary}} metabolites from endophyte-plant interactions {{have also}} been isolated and used in raw or derived forms to produce a variety of drugs treating many conditions. The toxic properties of ergot alkaloids also make them useful {{in the treatment of}} headaches and throughout the process of giving birth by inducing contractions and stemming hemorrhages. Drugs used to treat Parkinson's Disease have been created from isolates of ergot toxins, although health risks may accompany their use. Ergotamine has also been used to synthesize lysergic acid diethylamide because of its chemical similarity to lysergic acid. The generally chemically-based defense properties of <b>endophytic</b> fungi make them a perfect group of organisms to search for new antibiotic compounds within, as other fungi have in the past yielded such useful drugs as penicillin and streptomycin and plants use their antibiotic qualities as a defense against pathogens.|$|E
25|$|The {{range of}} {{associated}} plants and fungi may be altered as climate changes, {{and not necessarily}} in a synchronous fashion. Plants may lose or gain endophytes, with as yet unknown impacts on defense and fitness, although generalist species may provide indirect defense in new habitats more often than not. Above-ground and below-ground associations can be mutual drivers of diversity, so altering the interactions between plants and their fungi may also have drastic effects on the community at large, including herbivores. Changes in distribution may bring plants into competition with previously established local species, making the fungal community – and particularly the pathogenic role of fungus – important in determining outcomes of competition with non-native invasive species. As carbon dioxide levels rise, the amplified photosynthesis will increase the pool of carbohydrates available to <b>endophytic</b> partners, potentially altering the strength of associations. Infected C3 plants show greater relative growth rate under high CO2 conditions compared to uninfected plants, {{and it is possible}} that the fungi drive this pattern of increased carbohydrate production.|$|E
25|$|Not all <b>endophytic</b> symbioses confer {{protection}} from herbivores – only some species associations act as defense mutualisms. The {{difference between a}} mutualistic endophyte and a pathogenic one can be indistinct and dependent on interactions with other species or environmental conditions. Some fungi which are pathogens {{in the absence of}} herbivores may become beneficial under high levels of insect damage, such as species which kill plant cells in order to make nutrients available for their own growth, thereby altering nutritional content of leaves and making them a less desirable foodstuff. Some endomycorrhizae may provide defense benefits but at the cost of lost reproductive potential by rendering grasses partially sterile with their own fungal reproductive structures taking precedence. This is not unusual among fungi, as non-endophytic plant pathogens have similar conditionally beneficial effects on defense. Some species of endophyte may be beneficial for the plants in other ways (e.g. nutrient and water uptake) but will provide less benefit as a plant receives more damage and not produce defensive chemicals in response. The effect of one fungus on the plant can be altered when multiple strains of fungi are infecting a given individual in combination.|$|E
500|$|The {{mycorrhizal}} symbiosis is ancient, dating {{to at least}} 400 million years ago. It often increases the plant's uptake of inorganic compounds, such as nitrate and phosphate from soils having low concentrations of these key plant nutrients. The fungal partners may also mediate plant-to-plant transfer of carbohydrates and other nutrients. Such mycorrhizal communities are called [...] "common mycorrhizal networks". A special case of mycorrhiza is myco-heterotrophy, whereby the plant parasitizes the fungus, obtaining all of its nutrients from its fungal symbiont. Some fungal species inhabit the tissues inside roots, stems, and leaves, in which case they are called endophytes. Similar to mycorrhiza, <b>endophytic</b> colonization by fungi may benefit both symbionts; for example, endophytes of grasses impart to their host increased resistance to herbivores and other environmental stresses and receive food and shelter from the plant in return.|$|E
2500|$|Aside {{from coal}} tar, trace amounts of {{naphthalene}} {{are produced by}} magnolias and certain species of deer, {{as well as the}} Formosan subterranean termite, possibly produced by the termite as a repellant against [...] "ants, poisonous fungi and nematode worms." [...] Some strains of the <b>endophytic</b> fungus Muscodor albus produce naphthalene among a range of volatile organic compounds, while Muscodor vitigenus produces naphthalene almost exclusively.|$|E
2500|$|Examples of host {{specialists are}} {{numerous}} – especially in temperate environments – with multiple specialist fungi frequently infecting one plant individual simultaneously. These specialists demonstrate {{high levels of}} specificity for their host species and may form physiologically adapted host-races on closely related congeners. Piriformospora indica is an interesting <b>endophytic</b> fungus of the order [...] Sebacinales, the fungus is capable of colonising roots and forming symbiotic relationship with every possible plant on earth [...] P. indica {{has also been shown}} to increase both crop yield and plant defence of a variety of crops(barley, tomato, maize etc.) against root-pathogens. [...] However, there are also many examples of generalist fungi which may occur on different hosts at different frequencies (e.g. Acremonium endophytes from five subgenera of Festuca) and as part of a variety of fungal assemblages. They may even spread to novel, introduced plant species. <b>Endophytic</b> mutualists associate with species representative of every growth form and life history strategy in the grasses and many other groups of plants. The effects of associating with multiple strains or species of fungus at once can vary, but in general, one type of fungus will be providing the majority of benefit to the plant.|$|E
2500|$|A {{correlation}} {{was found between}} {{an increase in the}} infection rate of wheat by Fusarium head blight and the application of glyphosate, but [...] "because of the nature of this study, we could not determine if the association between previous GF (glyphosate formulation) use and FHB development was a cause-effect relationship". Other studies have found causal relationships between glyphosate and decreased disease resistance. Exposure to glyphosate has been shown to change the species composition of <b>endophytic</b> bacteria in plant hosts, which is highly variable.|$|E
2500|$|As of 2013, {{paclitaxel}} {{production for}} BMS is sourced using a semi-synthetic method from Taxus baccata (European yew). Another company which worked with BMS until 2012, Phyton Biotech, Inc uses plant cell fermentation (PCF) technology which {{eliminates the need}} for yew tree plantation sourcing. The process uses a specific Taxus cell line propagated in aqueous medium in large fermentation tanks with the <b>endophytic</b> fungus Penicillium raistrickii. Paclitaxel is then extracted directly, purified by chromatography and isolated by crystallization. [...] Compared to the semisynthesis, PCF {{eliminates the need for}} many hazardous chemicals and saves a considerable amount of energy.|$|E
2500|$|Due to the {{inherently}} nutrient-exchange based {{economy of the}} plant-endophyte association, {{it is not surprising}} that infection by fungi directly alters the chemical composition of plants, with corresponding impacts on their herbivores. Endophytes frequently increase apoplastic carbohydrate concentration, altering the C:N ratio of leaves and making them a less efficient source of protein. This effect can be compounded when the fungus also uses plant nitrogen to form N-based secondary metabolites such as alkaloids. For example, the thistle gall fly (Urophora cardui) experiences reduced performance on plants infected with <b>endophytic</b> fungi due to the decrease in N-content [...] and ability to produce large quantities of high-quality gall tissue. Additionally, increased availability of limiting nutrients to plants improves overall performance and health, potentially increasing the ability of infected plants to defend themselves.|$|E
2500|$|A loline {{alkaloid}} is {{a member}} of the 1-aminopyrrolizidines (often referred to as lolines), which are bioactive natural products with several distinct biological and chemical features. The lolines are insecticidal and insect-deterrent compounds that are produced in grasses infected by [...] <b>endophytic</b> fungal symbionts of the genus Epichloë (anamorphic species: Neotyphodium). Lolines increase resistance of endophyte-infected grasses to insect herbivores, and may also protect the infected plants from environmental stresses such as drought and spatial competition. They are alkaloids, organic compounds containing basic nitrogen atoms. The basic chemical structure of the lolines comprises a saturated [...] pyrrolizidine ring, a primary amine at the C-1 carbon, and an internal ether bridge—a hallmark feature of the lolines, which is uncommon in organic compounds—joining two distant ring (C-2 and C-7) carbons (see Fig. 1). Different substituents at the C-1 amine, such as methyl, formyl, and acetyl groups, yield loline species that have variable bioactivity against insects. Besides endophyte–grass symbiota, loline alkaloids have also been identified in some other plant species; namely, Adenocarpus species (family Fabaceae) and Argyreia mollis (family Convolvulaceae).|$|E
2500|$|Heavy {{application}} of chemical fungicide would eventually leads to resistant of pathogen and causing {{soil and water}} pollutions. Hence, more sustainable and environmental friendly method should be established and implemented, such as biological control. Several species of fungi from the genera of Trichoderma was identified to be a beneficial endophyte, to control black pod caused by Phytophthora spp. An isolate of Trichoderma asperellum from soil was observed as a potential mycoparasite for P. megakarya where this fungus {{has the potential to}} reduce black pod incident under field condition in Cameroon. It was reported that moderate black pod cases (47%) occurred in the T. asperellum treatment to control black pod disease compared to trees with untreated (71%) and chemical fungicide (1.73%). Another species, which is T. virens also has been documented to reduce some black pod incident in Peru. In Brazil, a new species known as Trichoderma martiale Samuels, sp. nov. was identified as an endophyte on cocoa, which has the ability to reduce black pod symptoms caused by P. megakarya. This endophyte species survives on cocoa pods, and has the ability to establish a long <b>endophytic</b> association with the host (about 3.5 months). Nevertheless, the protection against black pod via biological control is not as effective as the control using chemical fungicides ...|$|E
50|$|After seeds germinate, {{they produce}} a {{haustorium}} or root-like structures that penetrate the host to extract water and minerals. This <b>endophytic</b> portion {{results in a}} challenging control problem because treatments must kill the outer ectophytic portion of the plant {{as well as the}} <b>endophytic</b> portion without damaging the host.|$|E
