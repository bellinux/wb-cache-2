25|$|When a uranium nucleus fissions {{into two}} {{daughter}} nuclei fragments, about 0.1 {{percent of the}} mass of the uranium nucleus appears as the fission energy of ~200MeV. For uranium-235 (total mean fission energy 202.5MeV), typically ~169MeV appears as the kinetic energy of the daughter nuclei, which fly apart at about 3% of the speed of light, due to Coulomb repulsion. Also, an average of 2.5neutrons are emitted, with a mean kinetic energy per neutron of ~2MeV (total of 4.8MeV). The fission reaction also releases ~7MeV in prompt gamma ray photons. The latter figure means that a nuclear fission explosion or criticality accident emits about 3.5% of its energy as gamma rays, less than 2.5% of its energy as fast neutrons (total of both types of radiation ~ 6%), and the rest as kinetic energy of fission fragments (this appears almost immediately when the fragments impact surrounding matter, as simple heat). In an atomic bomb, this heat may serve to raise the temperature of the bomb core to 100million kelvin and cause secondary emission of soft X-rays, which convert some of this energy to ionizing radiation. However, in nuclear reactors, the <b>fission</b> <b>fragment</b> kinetic energy remains as low-temperature heat, which itself causes little or no ionization.|$|E
