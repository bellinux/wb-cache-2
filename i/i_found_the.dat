The finances and the judicial system were reorganised, a class of civil servants and a national militia founded, and several small districts were brought under the duke's authority. The result was a unity and order in the duchy which enabled Maximilian {{to play an important}} part in the Thirty Years' War; during the earlier years of which he was so successful as to acquire the Upper Palatinate and the electoral dignity which had been enjoyed since 1356 by the elder branch of the Wittelsbach family. The Electorate of Bavaria then consisted of most of the modern regions of Upper Bavaria, Lower Bavaria, and the Upper Palatinate.|$|E

25|$|Maximilian <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>the</b> duchy {{encumbered}} {{with debt}} {{and filled with}} disorder, but ten years of his vigorous rule effected a remarkable change. The finances and the judicial system were reorganised, a class of civil servants and a national militia founded, and several small districts were brought under the duke's authority.

In spite of subsequent reverses, Maximilian retained these gains at the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. During the later years of this war Bavaria, especially the northern part, suffered severely. In 1632 the Swedes invaded, and when Maximilian violated the treaty of Ulm in 1647, the French and the Swedes ravaged the land. After repairing this damage to some extent, the elector died at Ingolstadt in September 1651, leaving his duchy much stronger than he had found it. The recovery of the Upper Palatinate made Bavaria compact; the acquisition of the electoral vote made it influential; and the duchy was able to play a part in European politics which internal strife had rendered impossible for the past four hundred years.|$|E

I have always admired the autocratic dictators who have been the first servants of their people. That is my great title: I have always sought to serve the country." [...] He used his power to censor his critics and banish his enemies.

500|$|Most {{songs from}} Back to Basics were {{inspired}} by real-life events that Aguilera had experienced. The track [...] "Oh Mother" [...] talks about Aguilera's childhood with her abusive father; its lyrical theme was compared to Madonna's [...] "Oh Father" [...] (1989). Her marriage with Jordan Bratman was the main theme of the album, with tracks inspired by the event including [...] "Makes Me Wanna Pray", [...] "Ain't No Other Man", [...] "On Our Way", [...] "Without You", [...] "Mercy on Me", [...] "Save Me from Myself" [...] and [...] "The Right Man". On [...] "The Right Man", Aguilera expresses that she has found [...] "the right man" [...] for her imagined daughter as she hopes that the child {{would not have to}} experience an abusive childhood like her, [...] "One day, My little girl will reach out her hand and she'll know <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>the</b> right man".|$|E
500|$|In June 2008, it was {{reported}} that Wellard was to be killed off. A show insider explained: [...] "Wellard has been a much-loved character and everyone will be sad to see him go. But if you think about it, Wellard was not a puppy when he arrived on Albert Square, so he would be over 100 in dog years by now. It makes sense for him to bow out of the show gracefully." [...] Raddings commented: [...] "I used to take Kyte on set everyday but <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>the</b> scenes when Wellard was put down too hard to watch so I asked someone else to take her to filming." [...] The scene in which Wellard was euthanised had to be re-edited, as Kyte could be seen breathing when supposedly dead. At the time of his death, Wellard had been in EastEnders for 14 years, making him one of the show's longest-running characters, and its longest-serving pet.|$|E
500|$|In November 2011, it was {{revealed}} on Tegan and Sara Quinn's official website that they were writing new material for their seventh studio album: [...] " [...] are back in our home studios working away at more songs. We’re {{really looking forward to}} making a new record now. Our hope is to be in the studio by early 2012." [...] "I'm Not Your Hero" [...] was written for the album, which was later named Heartthrob and recorded between February and May 2012. Sara, who wrote the lyrics, said the song was based on her life as a teenager when she was unable to identify with the lives of pop culture figures and had unforeseen thoughts about her future. She claimed the lyrics were about her political views from watching The West Wing, her identity and her sexuality. Tegan stated that when Sara showed the song to her and the producers, it was initially more of a love song and much more acoustic and slow than the final mix that would be released, and said she [...] "was haunted by it almost immediately. <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>the</b> verses to be quintessential Sara." ...|$|E

500|$|Ursula Franklin {{explains}} in {{a prelude to}} her 2006 collection of papers, interviews and talks that her lifelong interest in structures, in what she terms [...] "the arrangement and interplay of the parts within a whole," [...] {{has been at the}} root of most of her activities. Looking back after almost 40 years, she adds, [...] "I can see how I have tried to wrestle with just one fundamental question: 'How can one live and work as a pacifist {{in the here and now}} and help to structure a society in which oppression, violence, and wars would diminish and co-operation, equality, and justice would rise?'" [...] As part of the answer, Franklin turns to the metaphor of mapmaking to explain her intellectual journey. [...] "Increasingly <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>the</b> maps of conventional wisdom inadequate for my travels," [...] she writes. [...] "I became unwilling and unable to orient my life according to national maps depicting the realms of 'them' and 'us,' of good guys and bad guys, of winning, defeating, and being defeated; in short, all those maps drawn up for travel towards private gain and personal advancement." [...] Franklin concludes that she has been guided in understanding what she calls [...] "the real world" [...] by [...] "the maps of pacifism and feminism".|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Dan Povenmire, while Peter Shin contributed as supervising director. Various scenes in [...] "PTV" [...] were {{taken out of the}} episode due to Fox's international censors. As the writers worked on the episode the producers ended up, as the Chicago Tribune describes it, [...] "horse trading" [...] with Fox, removing a body-part reference in exchange for a dirty word. While the writing staff of the show was disappointed with the number of scenes that were removed from the episode, they were happy with the final result. The opening sequence, of which Family Guys creator Seth MacFarlane was particularly proud, was added into the episode after the producers discovered the episode ran three minutes short. The episode contained a montage which showcased the most bawdy moments of the previous seasons; Povenmire recalled the sequence; about it he stated that [...] "I just found those off the DVD and digitized them and edited them in. Basically because I didn't want to draw all those things! <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>the</b> most disgusting images from the first three seasons. And we actually got network notes on two of them saying, 'You're gonna have to cut that!' And I went, 'This has been on the air! And I'm only showing 8 frames of it!' And it turns out we cut them now when they're on the air. So apropos for the FCC episode." ...|$|E
500|$|The Los Angeles Times Judy Berman {{praised the}} finale, stating [...] " [...] this year {{went out with}} a bang. I had my doubts and reservations, largely {{concerning}} Blair and Chuck, but I am surprised and pleased to report that <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>the</b> end of [...] "Gossip Girl" [...] Season 4 both exciting and satisfying." [...] The return of Georgina Sparks was well-received as with Serena's development, with Berman citing Serena's confession with Charlie before she could plunge to her death. [...] "This debacle, along with the events of this season in general, seems to have given S some perspective. Friends, she apologizes to Nate and Dan for leading them on and confesses to Charlie that her decision-making skills leave something to be desired! Even if lazy writing results in Serena falling into old habits next season, it's a pretty gratifying moment." [...] Berman also questioned Vanessa's motive behind publishing Dan's novel [...] "it's impossible to know whether she's trying to do her old friend one last favor or profit from stirring up more drama in his life. Considering that Jessica Szohr won't be returning to the show in the fall, we may never find out." [...] Berman also complimented the casting of director David O Russell calling it [...] "one of the show's most delightfully random cameos ever". New York Magazine labeled Chuck and Blair's relationship as the [...] "Longest-Delayed Breakup" [...] of the season, adding that [...] "the big news was that Blair and Prince Louis are somehow still together and engaged, with the wedding scheduled for November sweeps. We feel comfortable assuming that by then, Chuck will have regrouped enough to break things up more definitively." ...|$|E

500|$|Television critics reacted mostly {{positive}} {{toward the}} episode, calling the storyline [...] "heartfelt." [...] In a simultaneous {{review of the}} episodes of The Simpsons and The Cleveland Show that preceded and followed the show, respectively, The A.V. Clubs Rowan Kaiser wrote, [...] "I spent the entire time expecting the rug to be pulled out {{and the whole thing}} revealed to be Seth MacFarlane just trying to manipulate my emotions." [...] Kaiser went on to compliment series creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane, stating [...] "some of the more recent formal experiments that the show has done, such as the hour-long murder mystery in this season's premiere, indicate that MacFarlane and company agree with the criticism." [...] He concluded his review by writing, [...] "I have to give props to Family Guy for going outside their wheelhouse without winking excessively at their audience, but I think {{it may have been a}} little bit too far to be truly great." [...] Kaiser ultimately gave the episode a B rating, the best rating of the night, beating The Cleveland Show episode [...] "Ain't Nothin' But Mutton Bustin'" [...] and The Simpsons episode [...] "Moms I'd Like to Forget". In another positive review of the episode, Jason Hughes of TV Squad praised the episode's [...] "funniest moments," [...] which included the opening sequence involving Peter and the Red Bull, as well as the reference to The Price Is Right. Hughes went on to comment that the episode [...] "taught us about the depths and bonds of love that make a family. Whether it's acceptance, hope or sacrifice, there's no limit to what we will do for family." [...] Kate Moon of TV Fanatic also commented positively on the episode, writing in her review of the storyline, [...] "Overall, <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>the</b> installment to be refreshing with everyone taking a part in Peter’s dilemma. It was actually sweet and emotional for a change." [...] Moon also praised the scenes involving President Obama, and Stewie's attempt at saving Brian.|$|E
