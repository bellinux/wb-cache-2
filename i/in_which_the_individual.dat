Richard Prum's activation-inhibition models, developed from Turing's work, use six variables {{to account for the}} observed range of nine basic within-feather pigmentation patterns, from the simplest, a central pigment patch, via concentric patches, bars, chevrons, eye spot, pair of central spots, rows of paired spots and an array of dots. More elaborate models simulate complex feather patterns in the guineafowl Numida meleagris <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> feathers feature transitions from bars at the base to an array of dots at the far (distal) end. These require an oscillation created by two inhibiting signals, with interactions in both space and time.|$|E
5|$|The Rights of Men indicts monarchy and {{hereditary}} distinctions {{and promotes}} a republican ideology. Relying on 17th- and early 18th-century notions of republicanism, Wollstonecraft maintains that virtue {{is at the}} core of citizenship. However, her notion of virtue is more individualistic and moralistic than traditional Commonwealth ideology. The goals of Wollstonecraft's republicanism are the happiness and prosperity of the individual, not the greatest good for the greatest number or the greatest benefits for the propertied. While she emphasizes the benefits that will accrue to the individual under republicanism, she also maintains that reform can only be effected at a societal level. This marks a change from her earlier texts, such as Original Stories from Real Life (1788), <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> plays the primary role in social reform.|$|E

A total of 22 families were studied, 13 <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>individuals</b> with trisomy 21 were siblings (category 1), four families <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>individuals</b> with trisomy 21 were second-degree relatives (category 2), and five families <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>individuals</b> with trisomy 21 were third-degree relatives, that is, their parents were siblings (category 3). In five category 1 families, parental mosaicism was detected, while in the remaining eight families, the origin of nondisjunction was maternal. In two of the four families of category 2 the nondisjunctions originated in individuals who were related. In only one of five category 3 families, the nondisjunctions originated in related individuals. These results suggest that parental mosaicism is an important etiologic factor in recurrent free trisomy 21 (5 of 22 families) and that chance alone can explain the recurrent trisomy 21 in many of the remaining families (14 of 22 families). However, in a small number of families (3 of 22), a familial predisposing factor or undetected mosaicism cannot be excluded...|$|R
5|$|The selfish herd {{theory was}} {{proposed}} by W.D. Hamilton {{to explain why}} animals seek central positions in a group. The theory's central idea {{is to reduce the}} individual's domain of danger. A domain of danger is the area within the group <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> {{is more likely to be}} attacked by a predator. The center of the group has the lowest domain of danger, so animals will constantly strive to gain this position. Testing Hamilton's selfish herd effect, Alta De Vos and Justin O'Rainn (2010) studied brown fur seal predation from great white sharks. Using decoy seals, the researchers varied the distance between the decoys to produce different domains of danger. The seals with a greater domain of danger had an increased risk of shark attack.|$|E

25|$|The alveoli {{are open}} (via the airways) to the atmosphere, {{with the result}} that {{alveolar}} air pressure is exactly the same as the ambient air pressure at sea level, at altitude, or in any artificial atmosphere (e.g. a diving chamber, or decompression chamber) <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> is breathing freely. With expansion of the lungs (through lowering of the diaphragm and expansion of the thoracic cage) the alveolar air now occupies a larger volume, and its pressure falls proportionally, causing air to flow in from the surroundings, through the airways, till the pressure in the alveoli is once again at the ambient air pressure. The reverse obviously happens during exhalation. This process (of inhalation and exhalation) is exactly the same at sea level, as on top of Mt. Everest, or in a diving chamber or decompression chamber.|$|E
25|$|Honing theory, {{developed}} principally by psychologist Liane Gabora, {{posits that}} creativity arises {{due to the}} self-organizing, self-mending nature of a worldview. The creative process is a way <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> hones (and re-hones) an integrated worldview. Honing theory places emphasis {{not only on the}} externally visible creative outcome but also the internal cognitive restructuring and repair of the worldview brought about by the creative process. When faced with a creatively demanding task, there is an interaction between the conception of the task and the worldview. The conception of the task changes through interaction with the worldview, and the worldview changes through interaction with the task. This interaction is reiterated until the task is complete, at which point not only is the task conceived of differently, but the worldview is subtly or drastically transformed as it follows the natural tendency of a worldview to attempt to resolve dissonance and seek internal consistency amongst its components, whether they be ideas, attitudes, or bits of knowledge.|$|E

25|$|Music-specific neural {{networks}} {{exist in the}} brain {{for a variety of}} music-related tasks. It has been shown that Broca's area is involved in the processing of musical syntax. Furthermore, brain damage can disrupt an individual's ability {{to tell the difference between}} tonal and atonal music and detect the presence of wrong notes, but can preserve the individual's ability to assess the distance between pitches and the direction of the pitch. The opposite scenario can also occur, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> loses pitch discrimination capabilities, but can sense and appreciate the tonal context of the work. Distinct {{neural networks}} also exist for music memories, singing, and music recognition. Neural networks for music recognition are particularly intriguing. A patient can undergo brain damage that renders him/her unable to recognize familiar melodies that are presented without words. However, the patient maintains the ability to recognize spoken lyrics or words, familiar voices, and environmental sounds. The reverse case is also possible, in which the patient cannot recognize spoken words, but can still recognize familiar melodies. These situations overturn previous claims that speech recognition and music recognition share a single processing system. Instead, it is clear that there are at least two distinct processing modules: one for speech and one for music.|$|E
25|$|Schleiermacher classifies {{the virtues}} under the {{two forms of}} Gesinnung ("disposition, attitude") and Fertigkeit ("dexterity, proficiency"), the first {{consisting}} of the pure ideal element in action and the second the form it assumes in relation to circumstances, {{each of the two}} classes falling respectively into the two divisions of wisdom and love and of intelligence and application. In his system the doctrine of duty is the description of the method of the attainment of ethical ends, the conception of duty as an imperative, or obligation, being excluded, as we have seen. No action fulfills the conditions of duty except as it combines the three following antitheses: reference to the moral idea in its whole extent and likewise to a definite moral sphere; connection with existing conditions {{and at the same time}} absolute personal production; the fulfillment of the entire moral vocation every moment though it can only be done in a definite sphere. Duties are divided with reference to the principle that every man make his own the entire moral problem and act at the same time in an existing moral society. This condition gives four general classes of duty: duties of general association or duties with reference to the community (Rechtspflicht), and duties of vocation (Berufspflicht) â€” both with a universal reference, duties of the conscience (<b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> is sole judge), and duties of love or of personal association.|$|E
