40|$|Abstract: Virtual Machines (VMs) {{have been}} widely adopted in cloud {{platforms}} to improve server consolidation and reduce operating costs. VM checkpointing is used to capture a persistent snapshot of a running VM and to later restore the VM to a previous state. Although VM checkpointing eases system administration, such as in recovering from a VM crash or undoing a previous VM activity, it can also {{increase the risk of}} exposing users ’ confidential data. This is because the checkpoint may store a VM’s physical memory pages and <b>disk</b> <b>contents</b> that contain confidential data such as clear text passwords and credit card numbers.

40|$|Norfloxacin {{is a new}} orally absorbed {{quinoline}} derivative structurally related to nalidixic acid but showing an expanded antibacterial spectrum which includes Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus faecalis, and staphylococci, among other susceptible bacterial species. The application of the regression line and error rate-bounded methods of analysis to the minimal inhibitory concentration and zone size data collected on 413 clinical isolates favored {{the selection of a}} 10 -micrograms disk content and the adoption of the following interpretive zone size breakpoints for antimicrobial susceptibility testing with norfloxacin: {{greater than or equal to}} 17 mm for susceptible, 13 to 16 mm for intermediate, and less than or equal to 12 mm for resistant categories.

Differences in the antibiotic <b>disk</b> <b>contents</b> and in vitro antibacterial spectra and pharmacokinetic properties, together with the much lower rates of cross-resistance reported between norfloxacin and related drugs, strongly argue against the use of the "class disk" concept in this instance and suggest that the 10 -micrograms norfloxacin susceptibility disk should be tested separately...|$|E

40|$|International audienceAntimicrobial {{susceptibility}} testing plays a {{key role}} in clinical microbiology. The disk diffusion test dates back to the 1940 s and became standardised from the 1950 s, with the International Collaborative Study (ICS) and National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) as the two major standards. Interlaboratory variation of disk test results was recognised early but has never been dealt with in a satisfactory manner. The error-rate bounded method was described in 1974 and its role is discussed. Species-specific susceptibility interpretation was coined in 1980 for and chloramphenicol. In the late 1970 s, more extensive use of species-specific breakpoints was introduced in Lund (Sweden). At the same time, P. Mouton constructed species-specific regression lines and pointed out the difficulties with narrow ranges of minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values. A more general use of species-specific regression lines was made possible with single-strain regression analysis, using one well-defined strain tested in disk diffusion with a range of <b>disk</b> <b>contents.</b> This method made it possible to calibrate the disk test in an individual laboratory. Other methods to achieve such calibration are also described. A recent method, 'MIC-coloured zone diameter histogram-technique', has proven useful for the validation of species-specific interpretive breakpoints. The microbiological breakpoint proposed by Williams in 1990 has experienced a renaissance with the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) epidemiological cut-off value (ECOFF). MIC and zone diameter distributions with accompanying ECOFFs for species-antimicrobial combinations are published on the EUCAST website. A method for the reconstruction of wild-type zone diameter populations, namely normalised resistance interpretation, is described. This method can produce resistance figures that are truly comparable between laboratories...|$|E

40|$|ObjectivesTo study {{trovafloxacin}} susceptibility among clinical isolates of four anaerobic bacterial species using minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) determinations, E test assays and disk {{diffusion test}} results and to calibrate the disk diffusion method for these species using single strain regression analysis (SRA). MethodsOne-hundred and eighty-seven clinical isolates of four anaerobic bacterial species were included. Trovafloxacin MIC determinations were performed using the agar dilution technique and MIC estimations using the E test. The disk diffusion test was performed according to Swedish Reference Group for Antibiotics standardization. NCCLS limits for susceptibility categories were applied. SRA was performed using 1, 3, 10, 30, and 100 μg trovafloxacin <b>disk</b> <b>contents</b> and ATCC control strains. The regression lines obtained permitted {{the calculation of}} zone equivalents to MIC limits {{as well as an}} evaluation of various disk potencies. ResultsTrovafloxacin susceptibility (S + I) was noted in 98. 9, 100, 100, and 97 % of Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Clostridium perfringens, and Peptostreptococcus magnus strains, respectively, as judged by MIC determinations. Agar dilution and E test estimations gave the same results, but E test values were consistently lower than MIC values by the reference method. Regression lines calculated for the four species using SRA showed different equation constants indicating species-related differences. Interpretive zone diameter breakpoints were calculated for the four species and used for the interpretation of susceptibility. ConclusionsThe disk diffusion test was successfully calibrated for trovafloxacin susceptibility testing of four anaerobic species using single strain regression analysis, SRA. There was a good agreement between the results of MIC-tests and disk testing. Interpretive errors of type I are prone to occur among Bacteroides isolates and might require species-related MIC limits. SRA calculations permitted the testing of the effect of different disk potencies on inhibition zones produced at the interpretive MIC limits. Criteria for the selection of a minimal disk content showed that 5 μg trovafloxacin is sufficient, but a 10 μg disk will safeguard against residual laboratory variation without producing too large inhibition zones for very susceptible strains...|$|E

40|$|A novel {{approach}} for setting interpretive breakpoints in disk diffusion antibiotic susceptibility testing according to determined {{minimum inhibitory concentration}} (MIC) limits is described, using the method of single-strain regression analysis. The procedure was tested on reference strains Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Streptococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), using published results from cefoperazone disk diffusion experiments. The correlation between logarithm of the <b>disk</b> <b>content</b> and inhibition zone diameter squared was linear, excluding three endpoint values. When constants A and B in the new regression line equation were calculated for the four strains, all four showed different regression lines. Zone diameters corresponding to various MICs were calculated for a <b>disk</b> <b>content</b> of 75 micrograms. The values obtained for the four strains were 20. 1, 20. 9, 24. 9, and 25. 8 mm, respectively, for an MIC of 16 micrograms/ml, and 15. 7, 15. 7, 22. 3, and 17. 9 mm, respectively, for an MIC of 64 micrograms/ml. The following zone diameter breakpoints were determined for the "I" (intermediate) category, using a 75 -micrograms disk: S. aureus, 18 to 15 mm; S. faecalis, 23 to 13 mm; E. coli, 20 to 17 mm; and P. aeruginosa, 20 to 17 mm...|$|R

40|$|An {{equation}} {{was derived}} from known formulas to express {{the size of the}} inhibition zone diameter in the disk diffusion antibiotic susceptibility test {{as a function of the}} <b>disk</b> <b>content</b> of antibiotic. The equation permitted a calculation of regression line constants for the correlation between zone diameter and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) with a single reference strain. Analysis of reference strains Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, as well as 12 clinical isolates belonging to these species, showed a linearity between zone size squared and the logarithm of <b>disk</b> <b>content</b> in tests with 10 -, 30 -, and 100 -micrograms gentamicin disks.

Histogram analysis of 48 strains of Streptococcus faecalis from clinical specimens showed a distribution of zone diameter values which would result in false classification of susceptibility with breakpoints calculated for the other bacterial species studied. Single reference strain analysis of S. faecalis ATCC 29212 (gentamicin MIC, 8 micrograms/ml) permitted the calculation of breakpoints which accurately assigned the strains tested to the intermediate category of susceptibility.

40|$|Fluconazole and {{voriconazole}} MICs {{were determined}} for 114 clinical Candida isolates, including isolates of Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida krusei, Candida lusitaniae, Candida parapsilosis, and Candida tropicalis. All strains were susceptible to voriconazole, and most strains were also susceptible to fluconazole, {{with the exception}} of C. glabrata and C. krusei, the latter being fully fluconazole resistant. Single-strain regression analysis (SRA) was applied to 54 strains, including American Type Culture Collection reference strains. The regression lines obtained were markedly different for the different Candida species. Using an MIC limit of susceptibility to fluconazole of ≤ 8 μg/ml, according to NCCLS standards, the zone breakpoint for susceptibility for the 25 -μg fluconazole disk was calculated to be ≥ 18 mm for C. albicans and ≥ 22 mm for C. glabrata and C. krusei. SRA results for voriconazole were used to estimate an optimal <b>disk</b> <b>content</b> according to rational criteria. A 5 -μg <b>disk</b> <b>content</b> of voriconazole gave measurable zones for a tentative resistance limit of 4 μg/ml, whereas a 2. 5 -μg disk gave zones at the same MIC level for only three of the species.

There was a significant correlation between the two measurements. Our results show that disk diffusion methods might be useful for azole testing of Candida isolates. The method can be calibrated using SRA. Multidisk testing gives direct estimations of the MICs for the isolates...|$|R
