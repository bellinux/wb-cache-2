5|$|Only eight {{species of}} lemur {{are known to}} be seed predators (granivores), but this may be under-reported since most {{observations}} only report fruit consumption and do not <b>investigate</b> <b>whether</b> the seeds are consumed as well. These lemurs include some indriids, such as the diademed sifaka (Propithecus diadema), the golden-crowned sifaka (Propithecus tattersalli), the indri, and the aye-aye. The aye-aye, which specializes in structurally defended resources, can chew through Canarium seeds, which are harder than the seeds that New World monkeys are known to break open. At least 36genera from 23families of plants are targeted by lemur seed predators.|$|E
