After reading {{a copy of}} the script, Rogers {{realized}} that her character was going to die before she reached the ending. The script included a large part for Fowley, which Rogers described as [...] "by far the most [...] had to do in an episode."

500|$|Roger Ebert, in {{a review}} for the Chicago Sun-Times, gave the film {{one and a half}} stars out of four, {{considering}} it confusing and uninteresting.

USA Today rated the film {{two and a half stars}} out of four, calling it [...] "one of the most densely plotted mysteries in memory—though paradoxically, four-fifths of it <b>is</b> <b>way</b> <b>too</b> easy to predict." [...] However, Rolling Stone praised Spacey, saying his [...] "balls-out brilliant performance is Oscar bait all the way." [...] In his review for The Washington Post, Hal Hinson wrote, [...] "Ultimately, The Usual Suspects may be too clever for its own good. The twist at the end is a corker, but crucial questions remain unanswered. What's interesting, though, is how little this intrudes on our enjoyment. After the movie you're still trying to connect the dots and make it all fit—and these days, how often can we say that?" ...|$|E
500|$|Bart names his new {{elephant}} Stampy {{and ties}} {{him to a}} post in the backyard. Lisa begins complaining that keeping an elephant as a pet is cruel, while Homer is concerned that Stampy will eat him out of house and home. In an effort to offset food costs, Bart and Homer exhibit Stampy by charging customers to pet and ride him, but they fail to {{make enough money to}} cover the elephant's food costs for one day. Homer and Marge decide that their house is unsuitable for an elephant to live in, and that Stampy <b>is</b> <b>way</b> <b>too</b> expensive to maintain as a pet, and tell the children the elephant must go. The family is visited by a representative of a game reserve, who says their acres of open land similar to African Savannah would be a good habitat for the elephant to live in. However, as the family is pondering what to do about Stampy, a wildlife poacher named Mr. Blackheart offers to buy Stampy. Homer wants to take the money, but Lisa is against the idea — particularly since Mr. Blackheart openly admits he plans to have Stampy killed for his ivory tusks. Just as Homer and Mr. Blackheart reach a deal, [...] Stampy and Bart run off, wreaking havoc throughout Springfield, and are soon nowhere to be found. The family begins searching and finds them at the Springfield Tar Pits, where Homer gets stuck in one of the tar pits. Homer is freed by Stampy, and gratefully agrees to donate the elephant to a wildlife reserve.|$|E

She, like Phyllis Newman (Michelle Stafford), is not meant to be some happy housewife, married to a boy scout. Chloe needs a sparring partner and partner-in-crime. She <b>is</b> <b>way</b> <b>too</b> much woman to be cheated on by someone like Chance." [...] Also unfavorable of the relationship was Sara Bibel of Xfinity, who wrote that [...] "Chance and Chloe never had much chemistry.

2500|$|Early {{during the}} life of the series, some effort was made to {{slightly}} soften the original concept. For example, scenes were cut from the pilot episode, [...] "City of," [...] in which Angel tasted the blood of a murder victim; the episode that was originally written to be the second episode, [...] "Corrupt", was abandoned altogether. Writer David Fury explained, [...] "The network was shocked. They said 'We can't shoot this. This <b>is</b> <b>way</b> <b>too</b> dark.'

2500|$|In 2002, at age 13, vocalist Hayley Williams {{moved from}} her {{hometown}} Meridian, Mississippi to Franklin, Tennessee, {{where she met}} brothers Josh Farro and Zac Farro at a weekly supplemental program for home-schooled students. Shortly after arriving, she began taking vocal lessons with Brett Manning. Prior to forming Paramore, Williams and bassist Jeremy Davis, along with friend Kimee Read, {{took part in a}} funk cover band called The Factory, while Josh and Zac Farro had practiced together after school. The other members of what was soon to be Paramore had been [...] "edgy about the whole female thing" [...] of having Williams as vocalist, but, because they were good friends, she started writing for them. Williams said of the members when she first met them, [...] "They were the first people I met who were as passionate about music as I was." [...] The band was officially formed by Josh Farro (lead guitar/backing vocals), Zac Farro (drums), Davis (bass guitar) and Williams (lead vocals) in 2004, with the later addition of Williams' neighbor Jason Bynum (rhythm guitar). When Davis showed up, he was stunned to find out the drummer was only twelve years old. He admitted [...] "I had very, very, very, little faith in everyone in the band because of their age.
