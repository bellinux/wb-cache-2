5|$|In {{his opinion}} {{all human beings}} have the same {{abilities}} with regard to reason, feelings and imagination, but these basic ingredients are used in different ways and in different environments, which gives rise to different cultures and civilizations. According to him it <b>is</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> culture on Tierra del Fuego is at {{a lower level of}} development than European culture, but he also admits that the conditions of life there are much more difficult and this gives people very little chance to develop a higher culture. Based on these opinions he was classified as one of the main examples of 18th-century German cosmopolitanism.|$|E
5|$|After small planetesimals—about 1km in diameter—have {{formed by}} {{one way or}} another, runaway {{accretion}} begins. It is called runaway because the mass growth rate is proportional to , where R and M are the radius and mass of the growing body, respectively. It <b>is</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> specific (divided by mass) growth accelerates as the mass increases. This leads to the preferential growth of larger bodies {{at the expense of}} smaller ones. The runaway accretion lasts between 10,000 and 100,000years and ends when the largest bodies exceed approximately 1,000km in diameter. Slowing of the accretion is caused by gravitational perturbations by large bodies on the remaining planetesimals. In addition, the influence of larger bodies stops further growth of smaller bodies.|$|E
25|$|During {{the second}} encounter, the Battle of Satala, the Roman forces seized Narseh's camp, his treasury, his harem, and his wife. Detailed {{descriptions}} of the dispositions of the two armies have not survived, but it <b>is</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Roman army caught the Persians unprepared whilst encamped. Presumably, the active aid of the local Armenian population allowed the Romans to approach and trap the Persians without being detected.|$|E

60|$|The bland, almost episcopal {{serenity}} of Senator Hastings' {{face was}} somewhat disturbed. It <b>was</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> situation displeased him.|$|R
25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> first {{popular music}} played in Cuba after the Spanish conquest was {{brought by the}} Spanish conquerors themselves, and was most likely {{borrowed}} from the Spanish popular music in vogue during the 16th century. From the 16th to the 18th century some danceable songs that emerged in Spain were associated to Hispanic America, or considered as been originated in America. Some of these songs with picturesque names such as Sarabande, Chaconne, Zambapalo, Retambico and Gurrumbé, among others, shared a common trait, its characteristic rhythm called Hemiola or Sesquiáltera (in Spain).|$|E
25|$|Basket interference, or goaltending is a {{violation}} charged when a player illegally interferes with a shot. This violation is incurred when a player touches the ball on its downward trajectory to the basket, unless it <b>is</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ball has no chance of entering the basket, if a player touches the ball while {{it is in the}} rim, or in the area extended upwards from the basket, or if a player reaches through the basket to interfere with the shot. When a defensive player is charged with goaltending, the basket is awarded. If an offensive player commits the infraction, the basket is cancelled. In either case possession of the ball is turned over to the defensive team.|$|E
25|$|The Robertson–Seymour theorem {{states that}} finite undirected graphs and graph minors form a well-quasi-ordering. It <b>is</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> graph minor {{relationship}} {{does not contain}} any infinite descending chain, because each contraction or deletion reduces the number of edges and vertices of the graph (a non-negative integer). The nontrivial part of the theorem {{is that there are}} no infinite antichains, infinite sets of graphs that are all unrelated to each other by the minor ordering. If S is a set of graphs, and M is a subset of S containing one representative graph for each equivalence class of minimal elements (graphs that belong to S but for which no proper minor belongs to S), then M forms an antichain; therefore, an equivalent way of stating the theorem is that, in any infinite set S of graphs, there must be only a finite number of non-isomorphic minimal elements.|$|E

60|$|She {{opened her}} lips and closed them again. There was a slight frown upon her forehead. It <b>was</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> word had unintentionally escaped her.|$|R
25|$|Rae's {{popularity}} {{had recovered}} somewhat by 1995, {{but by the}} time the writs were dropped for that year's provincial election it <b>was</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> NDP would not be re-elected.|$|R
25|$|I cannot {{believe that}} a state statute would be {{consistent}} with our constitutional guarantee of freedom of religion if it specifically denied the right to practice law to all members of one of our great religious groups, Protestant, Catholic, or Jewish. Yet the Quakers have had a long and honorable part in the growth of our nation, and an amicus curiae brief filed in their behalf informs us that, under the test applied to this petitioner, not one of them, if true to the tenets of their faith, could qualify for the bar in Illinois. And it <b>is</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> same disqualification would exist as to every conscientious objector to the use of force, even though the Congress of the United States should continue its practice of absolving them from military service. The conclusion seems to me inescapable that, if Illinois can bar this petitioner from the practice of law it can bar every person from every public occupation solely because he believes in nonresistance, rather than in force.|$|E
25|$|It {{is clear}} {{now that the}} present {{situation}} cannot be allowed to continue. It is evident also that the Stormont government {{is no longer in}} control of the situation. Indeed, the present situation is the inevitable outcome of the policies pursued for decades by successive Stormont governments. It is clear also that the Irish Government can no longer stand by and see innocent people injured and perhaps worse. It <b>is</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> RUC is no longer accepted as an impartial police force. Neither would the employment of British troops be acceptable nor would they be likely to restore peaceful conditions, certainly not in the long term. The Irish Government have, therefore, requested the British Government to apply immediately to the United Nations for the urgent dispatch of a Peace-Keeping Force to the Six Counties of Northern Ireland and have instructed the Permanent Representative to the United Nations to inform the Secretary General of this request. We have also asked the British Government {{to see to it that}} police attacks on the people of Derry should cease immediately.|$|E
25|$|It {{is often}} said that the small figurine was the only {{preserved}} statue of Khufu. This is not quite correct. Excavations at Saqqara in 2001 and 2003 revealed a pair of terracotta statues depicting a lion goddess (possibly Bastet or Sakhmet). On her feet two figures of childlike kings are preserved. While the right figurine can be identified as king Khufu by his Horus name, the left one depicts king Pepy I of 6th dynasty, called by his birth name. It <b>is</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> figurines of Pepy {{were added to the}} statue groups in later times, because they were placed separately and at a distance from the deity. This is inconsistent with a typical statue group of the Old Kingdom—normally all statue groups were built as an artistic unit. Both statue groups are worked out similarly to each other (both have the same size and scale), {{the only difference is that}} one lion goddess holds a scepter. The excavators point out that the statues were restored during the Middle Kingdom, after they were broken apart. However, it seems that the reason for a restoration lay more in an interest for the goddess, than for a royal cult around the king figures: their names were covered with gypsum.|$|E
60|$|Dick nodded. It <b>was</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> lad had <b>been</b> {{quick and}} cool at a {{critical}} time, but his twinkling smile showed that he was now in a different mood.|$|R
5000|$|The {{following}} idioms {{include the}} verb, and object, {{and at least}} one preposition. It should again <b>be</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fixed words of the idioms can in no way be viewed as forming constituents: ...|$|R
30|$|It <b>was</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> PSRFs with peaks {{ranging from}} short to long {{wavelengths}} {{could be obtained}} by increasing the thickness of each layer, which was controlled by {{the duration of the}} etch cycle [5].|$|R
25|$|Sir Roger’s sister-in-law, Mrs. Ackroyd, her daughter, Flora, his secretary, Geoffrey Raymond and Major Blunt, a guest, are {{relaxing}} in the hall. Mrs. Ackroyd and Flora live there {{due to their}} financial circumstances. They are utterly reliant on Sir Roger who tightly controls their money and consequently they are in some debt. They discuss {{a report in the}} newspaper of the suicide of a local woman, Mrs. Ashley Ferrars, during the previous night. She had a close relationship with Sir Roger and her death has greatly affected him. They further discuss the impending announcement of the engagement between Flora and Sir Roger’s stepson, Ralph Paton and the difference that this marriage will make. A young woman who is a neighbour, Caryl Sheppard, arrives to play bridge and Flora teases her over her fascination for a recent arrival in the village – a foreigner who Caryl thinks is called M. Porrott, but Flora reveals that her uncle has told her that he in fact is M. Hercule Poirot, the famous French detective. Poirot arrives and meets everyone. He is especially taken with Caryl. During the conversation, Caryl tells Flora that she thought she saw Ralph Paton in the village that morning but Flora is surprised – as far as she knew Ralph has been in London for the previous six months ever since he had an argument with his uncle. As Caryl's brother, Dr. James Sheppard, is dining at Fernley that evening, she will be alone and she invites Poirot to dine with her. They leave together. As the others go off to change for dinner, a maid, Ursula Bourne, tidies the room and meets Ralph when he comes in from the terrace. It <b>is</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> two have a secret relationship but their conversation is interrupted as Bourne sees Dr. Sheppard approaching the house. Ralph quickly hides in the adjoining library and Dr. Sheppard enters to be greeted by Parker, the butler. Dr. Sheppard may have to rush out to a confinement case later and consequently he has his doctor's bag with him which Parker looks after. Sheppard is left to his own devices for a moment and Ralph comes out of hiding and tells the doctor, an old friend, that he is in a mess with his stepfather and that he is staying at a local inn, the White Horse. Ralph leaves the house and soon Sir Roger himself comes down into the hall. He too unburdens himself on Sheppard: Mrs. Ferrars was going to be his fiancée after the year’s mourning for the late Mr. Ferrars came to an end but, when the requisite time was up, she hesitated for three more months and then confessed that she poisoned her brutal husband. She was driven to suicide by an unknown blackmailer who knew of her actions and has been draining her of funds all this time. Sir Roger is certain that she would have left him a letter detailing who her persecutor was. At that moment, Parker comes in with a letter for Sir Roger – it is from the late Mrs. Ferrars but he has no time to open it as the others come down for dinner.|$|E
500|$|Jenny Uglow {{believes}} that the boy echoes {{the figure in the}} last print of William Hogarth's The Four Stages of Cruelty by pointing out the arrogance and potential cruelty of experimentation, while David Fraser also sees the compositional similarities with the audience grouped round a central demonstration. The neutral stance of the central character and the uncertain intentions of the boy with the cage were both later ideas: an early study, discovered {{on the back of a}} self-portrait, omits the boy and shows the natural philosopher reassuring the girls. In this sketch it <b>is</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> bird will survive, and thus the composition lacks the power of the final version.|$|E
500|$|Controversy {{arose in}} Germany for the film's {{television}} premiere on ProSieben. Protests among the Jewish community ensued when the station intended to televise it with two commercial breaks of 3–4 minutes each. Ignatz Bubis, {{head of the}} Central Council of Jews in Germany, said: [...] "It is problematic to interrupt such a movie by commercials". Jerzy Kanal, chairman of the Jewish Community of Berlin, added [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> film could have a greater impact [...] when broadcast unimpeded by commercials. The station has {{to do everything possible}} to broadcast the film without interruption." [...] As a compromise, the broadcast included one break consisting of a short news update framed with commercials. ProSieben was also obliged to broadcast two accompanying documentaries to the film, showing [...] "The daily lives of the Jews in Hebron and New York" [...] prior to broadcast and [...] "The survivors of the Holocaust" [...] afterwards.|$|E
60|$|His {{interlocutor}} {{bowed and}} then drew himself up. It <b>was</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{strain of the}} last few days was telling upon him. There were lines about his mouth, and his eyes spoke of sleepless nights.|$|R
60|$|That was {{how they}} entered their present prison. They had {{carefully}} burnt away {{a portion of the}} thick, stiff covering and it <b>was</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> height from which they were suspended was a killing one.|$|R

60|$|Colston {{started and}} it <b>was</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> others <b>were</b> keenly interested, but Jernyngham's face grew darker and marked by signs of pain, {{for he had}} learned a little about Ellice. He was {{struggling}} with an overwhelming humiliation.|$|R
60|$|It <b>was</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{exertion}} {{of thinking}} and talking was not good for poor little James. Captain Folger therefore, after smoothing the hair on his forehead once or twice very tenderly, bade him good-bye, and went out.|$|R
60|$|Rollo's {{attention}} was immediately arrested by these words. It <b>was</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> gentlemen <b>were</b> forming {{a party to}} go somewhere, or to see something, and he felt quite confident that his uncle George would like to join them.|$|R
2500|$|Lorenz {{argues that}} just as the World Trade Organization and GATS propose {{educational}} reforms that would effectively erode all effective forms of democratic political control over higher education, so [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> economic view on higher education recently developed and formulated by the EU Declarations is similar to and compatible with the view developed by the WTO and by GATS." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "With its {{volumes of}} {{propaganda}} the Suharto regime has booby-trapped the historians’ path with false clues, dead-end diversions, and doctored bit of evidence. The falsity of Suharto’s solution {{is apparent in}} its imprecise {{use of the term}} PKI. According to the official version, the PKI masterminded the movement. But it <b>is</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> PKI, as an institution that consisted of millions of people, could not have organized a secretive military rebellion." ...|$|E
2500|$|This poem is a {{comparison}} between two flowers that are representations of the youth's beauty. Shakespeare compares these flowers, which vary greatly in their appearance, although they are essentially {{the same kind of}} flower, it <b>is</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> [...] "canker-blooms" [...] or wild roses, according to Katherine Duncan-Jones, are the less desirable then that of the, assumed, damask or crimson rose. Since the wild roses do not prolong their beauty after death, they are not like the youth–who even after death shall be immortalized in the writers words of the sonnet.|$|E
50|$|Profits for {{the half}} {{year to the}} end of 1864 were £53 11s 1d, with {{receipts}} from passengers and goods about equal. It <b>was</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> warning by the GWR in 1859 that income would barely cover costs, was true.|$|R
50|$|When it <b>was</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> copper mines {{would not}} re-open, {{and that there}} was no other {{worthwhile}} traffic to retain the branch, it was decided to close the line and accordingly the last train ran on Friday-Saturday 4-5 July 1924.|$|R
