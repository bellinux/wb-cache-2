500|$|Obviously we knew {{people were}} going to totally sensationalize it. They're {{beautiful}} girls, the scene is hot—I'm not afraid to say that. There is a sexual energy between the girls which is kind of authentic, because <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was a teen-aged girl, the friendships that I had with other girls were almost romantic, they were so intense. I wanted to sleep at my friend's house every night, I wanted to wear her clothes, we would talk on the phone until our ears ached. I wanted to capture that heightened feeling you get as an adolescent that you don't really feel as a grownup. (laughs) You like [...] friends when you're a grownup, but you don't need to sleep in the same bed with them and talk to them on the phone until 5 a.m. every night.|$|E
500|$|Similar {{to other}} artists that the {{director}} have worked with, Rolston usually brought his team of professionals along to the shooting, including make-up artist, wardrobe-hair stylist, dancers and choreographer. However, Rolston and his team turned out to cause a few creative conflicts with the group during production. One of them came from the original routine conducted by Watkins, {{the person who was}} in fact choreographed most of the group's early videos. She remembered Rolston's camp's choreographer Frank Gatson Jr. [...] "locked" [...] the girls out from providing ideas as they were practicing the new dance moves. The trio eventually dropped his choreograph because they thought his version wasn't their [...] "style of dancing." [...] But still, two of his moves were adapted in the final clip. [...] "To me, I didn't even think about, 'Well, can I really choreograph?' I was just like, 'Let me do my thing.' I just like to dance and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> like what I see. I like different kinds of stuff," [...] Watkins shared. The [...] "bend-down-and-jump-up" [...] dance that appears in the video was made up by Watkins to [...] "Foe Life", a song of Mack 10, the rapper whom she later married from 2000 to 2004.|$|E
2500|$|Hinrich {{started the}} {{exhibition}} game against Lithuania on August 13, 2006. He scored 10 points, had 2 steals, and shot 80% {{from the field}} in a US win. After the game, Hinrich was asked about starting the game. He responded, [...] "We're playing in groups right now. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> get my time, I just {{try to make the}} best of it, make sure our team is successful. It's one of those deals when you play in groups in spurts like that, it's a little bit tougher. But, you don't hold back and give it everything you got because you know you'll be rested a lot." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "A man at least, {{and ought}} to have a fair hearing. Now, I ask you, what {{possible}} interest can I have in this matter? <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> began that I should give myself a frightful quantity of trouble, and get only what I have got." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And you," [...] she answered, [...] "are {{continually}} {{reminding me}} of an Englishman <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was a girl.

60|$|<b>I</b> hardly <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> roused myself. <b>I</b> hardly <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> groped my {{way back}} to the bedroom, and lighted the candle, and searched (with a strange ignorance, at first, of where to look for them) for dry clothes to warm me.

60|$|Such are the occurrences, which, {{coming to}} my knowledge, imbued me long ago with {{a strong sense of}} the {{loneliness}} of chambers.

6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} {{to say it is}} true, Mrs. Cunningham, {{although}} I can assure you that I really cannot blame myself for either carelessness or stupidity. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> started that there was a very great risk, and took what seemed to me every possible precaution, for in addition to Dick Chetwynd going with me, I took two detectives from Bow Street and two prize fighters." ...|$|R
