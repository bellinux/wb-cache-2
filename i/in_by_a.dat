However, his failed business ventures prevented him from completing his work, and in 1819 the castle was lived <b>in</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> Mr. Thomas Wade.|$|E

5|$|Introduced in Soul Edge, Li Long is {{an assassin}} {{sent by the}} Emperor of China to kill a pirate lord, but failed. Badly injured, he was rescued by a woman named Chie and {{eventually}} {{fell in love with}} her. While out one day, a fight broke out at the inn and Chie was believed to be dead. Told falsely the swordsman Heishir≈ç Mitsurugi was responsible, he set out after Soul Edge knowing Mitsurugi was also after the blade. Along the way he takes the weapons of other fighters he defeats, repurposing some for his own use. Upon finding and defeating him, he realized Mitsurugi had no part in the attack upon Chie, and continued his goal of searching for Soul Edge. He located its wielder, Cervantes, but was beaten severely. Revealed to have survived in Soulcalibur III but having lost an eye, he found himself on the run from assassins sent by his former employer. Traveling by night under a false name, he was taken <b>in</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> girl that reminded him of Chie. When the assassins eventually found him, Li Long stood his ground and defeated them.

5|$|Jack is {{concerned}} for his mother, Colleen (Elaine Stritch). He tells Liz that {{the anniversary of}} his father, Jimmy Donaghy, abandoning their family is coming up and he is afraid of the effect it will have on Colleen. When Jack arrives at Colleen's hotel room {{to take her to}} dinner, however, he discovers she is staying with a man, Paul. Jack, worried she has been taken <b>in</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> con man in her time of grief, asks his private investigator Lenny Wosniak (Steve Buscemi) to look into Paul. Wosniak cannot find anything distasteful in Paul's background, but tells Jack that he is married. Jack reveals this to his mother, but she says she knew and did not care. Colleen is also surprised that Jack thought the anniversary of Jimmy leaving would hurt her, noting that he had once left from the spring of 1957 until he came back and invited her to see Some Like It Hot. Jack talks this over with Liz and comes to realize that as Some Like It Hot was released in 1959, Jimmy Donaghy cannot have been his biological father because Jack was conceived in 1958, during the period Jimmy had been absent.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{requirements}} of the Foundling Hospital was that babies were to be less than six months old at the time of admittance, but the hospital did not keep more accurate records of age. Another requirement was that foundlings were given a new name and a reference number, so Sabrina became Girl Ann Kingston no. 4759. She was taken <b>in</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> wet nurse, Mary Penfold, who brought her to Wotton, Surrey, where she remained until 1759, when she was two years old. Although it was usual for foundlings to remain with their wet nurse until the age of five or six, the Foundling Hospital had received an influx of new babies and moved many children who no longer required nursing, including Sabrina, to the Shrewsbury branch of the Foundling Hospital. The Shrewsbury building was not completed until 1765, so in the meantime Sabrina and another foundling were cared for by a nurse, Ann Casewell, at her home.|$|E

5|$|The Bal des Ardents (Ball of the Burning Men) or Bal des Sauvages (Ball of the Wild Men) was a {{masquerade}} ball held on 28January 1393 in Paris {{at which}} Charles VI of France {{performed in a}} dance with {{five members of the}} French nobility. Four of the dancers were killed in a fire caused by a torch brought <b>in</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> spectator, Charles's brother Louis, Duke of Orl√©ans. Charles and another of the dancers survived. The ball was {{one of a number of}} events intended to entertain the young king, who the previous summer had suffered an attack of insanity. The event undermined confidence in Charles's capacity to rule; Parisians considered it proof of courtly decadence and threatened to rebel against the more powerful members of the nobility. The public's outrage forced the King and his brother Orl√©ans, whom a contemporary chronicler accused of attempted regicide and sorcery, to offer penance for the event.|$|E
5|$|The {{writer of}} the {{scenario}} is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. According to an advertisement for the film, the plot was written especially for Marie Eline, {{also known as the}} Thanhouser Kid, as a feature which would show her abilities. Eline's role and actions were described in a deus ex machina fashion by The New York Dramatic Mirror reviewer because of her actions to guide and assist her blind sister. Though, Lonergan liked to use the dramatic technique in the conclusion of the plots, it was not like the usage in The Actor's Children. It is also not the most striking example of the technique, in The Restoration the runaway child picks a doorstep to rest upon in a city, at complete random, is taken <b>in</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> recently engaged wealthy woman and reunited with her amnesia-struck father. The film director is unknown, but it may have been Barry O'Neil. Film historian Q. David Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production, but at least two possible candidates exist. Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company, but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. Cast in the starring role is Marie Eline as the little girl. A surviving film still gives the possibility of identifying two more actors in the production. The other credits amongst the cast are unknown, but most of the credits are fragmentary for 1910 Thanhouser productions.|$|E
