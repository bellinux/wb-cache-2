According to ḥasidic sources, Berlin was sympathetically disposed toward that movement and extended a friendly welcome to one of its emissaries, Jacob Samson of Spitsevka. Further, Joel Brill, Aaron Wolfsohn, Judah Bensew, and many other Maskilim of Breslau often visited him to seek advice on scientific questions. As the Maskilim always carefully avoided wounding Berlin's religious feelings, he on his part met them half-way in many things.

40|$|This article {{looks at}} {{the issue of the}} first report, which <b>exceptionally</b> <b>permits</b> a {{complainant}} in a sexual offence case to offer a previously consistent statement into evidence. In the law of evidence a previous consistent statement is a written or oral statement, made by a witness on some prior occasion to testifying, which is substantially similar to her testimony in court. Normally, previous consistent statements are deemed to be inadmissible at trial because such testimony is considered to be self-serving and lacking in probative value. However, throughout jurisdictions following the Anglo-American tradition previous consistent statements in sexual offences are allowed as an exception to the general rule. This article reviews the history of the first report rule, including critical feminist legal critique of the rule's origins. The paper proceeds with a comparative look at divergent approaches to reform that have emerged with the rule in foreign jurisdictions. This analysis includes a review of reform proposals from the South African Law Commission (now the South African Law Reform Commission) before looking at a recent controversial case in the Supreme Court of Appeal that dealt with the first report, namely the case of S v Hammond...|$|R

50|$|This {{labour law}} for adults was preceded in 1841 by one for children, which {{prevented}} their employment in factories before 8 {{years of age}} and prohibited night labour for any child under 13. This was strengthened in 1874, particularly as regards employment of girls under 21, {{but it was not until}} 1892 that the labour of women was specially regulated by a law, still in force, with certain amendments in 1900. Under this law factory and workshop labour is prohibited for children under 13 years, though they may begin at 12 if qualified by the prescribed educational certificate and medical certificate of fitness. The limit of daily hours of employment is the same as for adult labour, and, similarly, from 1 April 1902 was 102, and two years later became io hours in the 24. Notice of the hours must be affixed, and meal-times or pauses with absolute cessation of work of at least one hour must be specified. By the act of 1892 one day in the week, not necessarily Sunday, had to be given for entire absence from work, in addition to eight recognized annual holidays, but this was modified by a law of 1906 which generally requires Sunday rest, but allows substitution of another day in certain industries and certain circumstances. Night labour - work between 9 P.M. and 5 A.M. - is prohibited for workers under 18, and only <b>exceptionally</b> <b>permitted,</b> under conditions, for girls and women over 18 in specified trades. In mines and underground quarries employment of women and girls is prohibited except at surface works, and at the latter is subject to the same limits as in factories. Boys of 13 may be employed in certain work underground, but under 16 may not be employed more than 8 hours in the 24 from bank to bank. A law of 1905 provided for miners a 9 hours' day and in 1907 an 8 hours' day from the foot of the entrance gallery back to the same point.|$|R

Sub-picosecond pump and probe experiments are performed, in the regime of an incoherent exciton gas of high density. For such a gas the dephasing due to collisions is not efficient enough to cause the break-down of the strong coupling and hence the collapse of the Rabi splitting. Phase-space filling and exchange effects are the dominant mechanisms. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

The agreement for the B 1 and B 2 symmetry species is also very good except for the asymmetric in-plane CH bend.

An analysis is given of the results in terms of derivatives with respect to internal coordinates (∂p/∂rk). Comparison of ∂p/∂rCS values from a series of X 2 CO molecules (and also with ∂p/∂rcs for X 2 CS molecules) reveals an interesting trend.

40|$|We {{study the}} problem of memory-efficient {{scalable}} image compression and investigate some tradeoffs in the complexity vs. coding efficiency space. The focus is on a low-complexity algorithm centered around the use of sub-bit-planes, scan-causal modeling, and a simplified arithmetic coder. This algorithm approaches the lowest possible memory usage for scalable wavelet-based image compression and demonstrates that the generation of a scalable bit-stream is not incompatible with a low-memory architecture. 1 Introduction In low-memory image compression applications, such as printing and scanning of highresolution images, storing the whole image in system memory is not practical. Image data arrives at the input of the encoder and is consumed at {{the output of the}} decoder one scanline (or a few) at a time.

40|$|The Sturtian is {{the oldest}} (ca 716 Ma) of three pan-global glaciations in the Cryogenian. At Omutirapo, in {{northern}} Namibia, a 2 km wide, 400 m deep palaeovalley is filled by glaciogenic strata of the Chuos Formation, which represents the Sturtian glacial record. Sedimentary logging of an <b>exceptionally</b> high-quality exposure <b>permits</b> detailed stratigraphic descriptions and interpretations, allowing two glacial cycles to be identified. At {{the base of the}} exposed succession, strong evidence supporting glaciation includes diamictites, ice-rafted dropstones and intensely sheared zones of interpreted subglacial origin. These facies collectively represent ice-proximal to ice-rafted deposits. Upsection, dropstone-free mudstones {{in the middle of the}} succession, and the absence of diamictites, imply sedimentation free from glacial influence. However, the reappearance of glacial deposits above indicates a phase of Sturtian glacial re-advance. Comparison with age-equivalent strata in South Australia, where evidence for sea-ice free sedimentation has been established previously, suggests that a Sturtian interglacial may have been extensive, implying global-scale waxing and waning of ice sheets during a Cryogenian glacial event.

40|$|Different {{strains of}} the {{established}} human cell line HeLa differ substantially in sensitivity to ethyl methanesulfonate (EtMes). The EtMes doses effective for either cytotoxicity or mutation induction {{in a line of}} HeLa S 3 cells are about 1 / 10 th those required in the CCL 2 HeLa line of the American Type Culture Collection. By plating the sensitive HeLa S 3 line in the presence of highly cytotoxic doses of EtMes, we obtained a clone (designated A 6) that displays about 7 -fold greater resistance to EtMes toxicity. This A 6 isolate is also cross resistant to other simple monofunctional alkylating agents—exhibiting about 4 -fold increased resistance to methyl methanesulfonate and 10 - to 15 -fold increased resistance to N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine but is similar to the S 3 parent in sensitivity to mitomycin C, UV radiation, and γ-rays. In contrast to the results for cytotoxicity, the A 6 variant and the S 3 parent showed the same high susceptibility to EtMes induction of ouabain-resistant mutations. This is direct biological evidence that different alkylation lesions are normally responsible for mutagenic and cytotoxic effects. The S 3 and A 6 cell lines may differ in DNA repair capability specific to certain potentially lethal alkylation products. The comparative sensitivity of the A 6 cells to alkylation mutagenesis may also prove useful in cell genetic studies by facilitating the generation of multiple mutants for recessive alleles and <b>permitting</b> <b>exceptionally</b> sensitive detection of specific mutagenic effects...|$|R

40|$|Context. Knowledge of the hyperfine {{structure}} of molecular lines {{is useful for}} estimating reliable column densities from observed emission, and essential for the derivation of kinematic information from line profiles. Aims. Deuterium bearing molecules are especially useful in this regard, because they are good probes of the physical and chemical structure of molecular cloud cores {{on the verge of}} star formation. However, the necessary spectroscopic data are often missing, especially for molecules which are too unstable for laboratory study. Methods. We have observed the ground-state (J = 1 - 0) rotational transitions of DCO+, (HNC) -C- 13 and DNC with the IRAM 30 m telescope toward the dark cloud LDN 1512 which has <b>exceptionally</b> narrow lines <b>permitting</b> hyperfine splitting to be resolved in part. The measured splittings of 50 - 300 kHz are used to derive nuclear quadrupole and spin-rotation parameters for these species. The measurements are supplemented by high-level quantum-chemical calculations using coupled-cluster techniques and large atomic-orbital basis sets. Results. We find eQq = + 151. 12 (400) kHz and C-I = - 1. 12 (43) kHz for DCO+, eQq = 272. 5 (51) kHz for (HNC) -C- 13, and eQq(D) = 265. 9 (83) kHz and eQq(N) = 288. 2 (71) kHz for DNC. The numbers for DNC are consistent with previous laboratory data, while our constants for DCO+ are somewhat smaller than previous results based on astronomical data. For both DCO+ and DNC, our results are more accurate than previous determinations. Our results are in good agreement with the corresponding best theoretical estimates, which amount to eQq = 156. 0 kHz and C-I = - 0. 69 kHz for DCO+, eQq = 279. 5 kHz for (HNC) -C- 13, and eQq(D) = 257. 6 kHz and eQq(N) = 309. 6 kHz for DNC. We also derive updated rotational constants for (HNC) -C- 13 : B = 43 545. 6000 (47) MHz and D = 93. 7 (20) kHz. Conclusions. The hyperfine splittings of the DCO+, DNC and (HNC) -C- 13 J = 1 - 0 lines range over 0. 47 - 1. 28 km s(- 1), which is comparable to typical line widths in pre-stellar cores and to systematic gas motions on similar to 1000 AU scales in protostellar cores.
