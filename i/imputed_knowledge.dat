40|$|This article {{deals with}} the <b>imputed</b> <b>knowledge</b> rule in agency law. The basic rule imputes to a {{principal}} knowledge or notice received by an agent {{within the scope of}} the agent 2 ̆ 7 s authority. The principal is deemed to have received the information in question {{even in the absence of}} any evidence that the agent successfully transmitted it to the principal. As the article clearly demonstrates, the <b>imputed</b> <b>knowledge</b> rule is currently characterized by complexity and contradiction. The analysis developed in the article suggests that this convolution and uncertainty is the result of the existence of a fundamental tension residing at the heart of the doctrine, a tension created by the influence of competing conceptions of the rule 2 ̆ 7 s basic purpose. The current rule, in which both the evidentiary surrogacy and the risk allocation rationales remain in tension, results inevitably in a doctrine that is not fully coherent, unnecessarily complex, and unpredictable in its application. This article was cited repeatedly and quoted extensively in the Reporter 2 ̆ 7 s Comments section of Section 5. 04 of the Restatement of the Law Third, Agency, approved and published by the American Law Institute in 2006...|$|E
50|$|A problem {{arises when}} the {{defendant}} is a corporation. By its nature, a fictitious person can only act through the human agency of the natural persons that it employs. Equally, it has no mind to constitute the mens rea. Hence, the notion of vicarious liability for companies and other business entities exclusively depends {{on the ability to}} <b>impute</b> <b>knowledge.</b>|$|R
50|$|To incur {{liability}} for a crime, a person must have both committed a prohibited act (the actus reus, {{which must be}} willed: see automatism) and have had an appropriate mental element (the mens rea) at the relevant time (see the technical requirement for concurrence). A key component of the mens rea is any knowledge that the alleged criminal might have had. For these purposes, knowledge can be both actual and constructive - i.e., the court can <b>impute</b> <b>knowledge</b> where appropriate.|$|R
2500|$|First, the Ninth Circuit {{acknowledged}} {{that it could not}} <b>impute</b> sufficient <b>knowledge</b> to Napster [...] "merely because peer-to-peer file sharing technology may be used to infringe plaintiffs' copyrights." [...] Paraphrased Sony into its own words, the Ninth Circuit explained that if a defendant [...] "made and sold equipment capable of both infringing and substantial noninfringing uses," [...] that fact alone—i.e., [...] "evidence that such machines could be and were used to infringe plaintiffs' copyrighted television shows" [...] – would not be sufficient grounds to <b>impute</b> constructive <b>knowledge</b> to defendants.|$|R

50|$|The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found Napster {{liable for}} both ‘{{contributory}} infringement’ and ‘vicarious infringement’. Regarding {{the issue of}} contributory infringement, {{the court held that}} Napster had ‘actual knowledge’ of infringing activity, and providing its software and services to the infringers meant that it had ‘materially contributed’ to the infringement. It was held that the defence in Sony was of ‘limited assistance to Napster’. The test whether a technology is capable of substantial non infringing uses was relevant only for <b>imputing</b> <b>knowledge</b> of infringement to the technology provider. But, in Napster’s case, it was found that Napster had ‘actual, specific knowledge of direct infringement’, and therefore, the Sony test would not be applicable.|$|R
50|$|The {{rationale}} of {{the doctrine}} is that if ignorance were an excuse, a person charged with criminal offenses or a subject of a civil lawsuit would merely claim that one {{was unaware of the}} law in question to avoid liability, even if that person really does know what the law in question is. Thus, the law <b>imputes</b> <b>knowledge</b> of all laws to all persons within the jurisdiction no matter how transiently. Even though it would be impossible, even for someone with substantial legal training, to be aware of every law in operation in every aspect of a state's activities, this is the price paid to ensure that willful blindness cannot become the basis of exculpation. Thus, it is well settled that persons engaged in any undertakings outside what is common for a normal person, such as running a nuclear power plant, will make themselves aware of the laws necessary to engage in that undertaking. If they do not, they cannot complain if they incur liability.|$|R
25|$|Some {{aspects of}} the {{physical}} world are so inevitable that it is always reasonable to <b>impute</b> <b>knowledge</b> of their incidence. So if A abandons B on a beach, A must be taken to foresee that the tide comes in and goes out. But the mere fact that B subsequently drowns is not enough. A court would have to consider where the body was left and what level of injury A believed that B had suffered. If B was left in a position that any reasonable person would consider safe but a storm surge caused extensive flooding throughout the area, this might be a novus actus. That B was further injured by an event within a foreseen class does not of itself require a court to hold that every incident falling within that class is a natural link in the chain. Only those causes that are reasonably foreseeable fit naturally into the chain. So if A had heard a weather forecast predicting a storm, the drowning will be a natural outcome. But if this was an event like a flash flood, an entirely unpredictable event, it will be a novus actus.|$|R
40|$|The ethical {{question}} about the information technologies We refer here to Aristotle's definition of ethics to illuminate some practices generated by information technology. For example, the accumulation of documents (temptation to “possess” resources), the problem of incorporating user – generated information within the project phases (problem of integrating alternative approaches), the assertion about the absolute freedom {{to make use of}} the ideas accessible on the web (the individual's interest takes precedence over laws of property); the decisive significance <b>imputed</b> to <b>knowledge</b> as opposed to imagination or affectivity.

40|$|Successor {{products}} liability – cases where an injured plaintiff sues a successor {{business for a}} defective product sold by a predecessor business [...] is a doctrine still under development in the courts, and the doctrine’s unsettled nature seems destined to continue {{over the next several}} years. Jurisdictions may be roughly divided into three categories. Several take a restrictive approach toward liability in such cases (sometimes called the “traditional approach”), allowing it only when relatively rare exceptions to a general no-liability rule apply. Several other jurisdictions are less restrictive with successor {{products liability}}, allowing recovery under the “product line” or “continuity of enterprise” approaches in addition to the traditional exceptions allowing liability. A third set of courts, also represented by several jurisdictions, have not yet firmly established an approach. Following a 1999 law review article by one of this article’s authors supporting the less restrictive product line and continuity of enterprise approaches, and some subsequent judicial support for the article’s position, some scholars responded that the less restrictive approaches are unfair to predecessor businesses in cases involving unforeseeable risks. This article challenges such concerns, demonstrating that in practice courts rarely <b>impute</b> <b>knowledge</b> of unknowable risks even under strict products liability, and that truly unforeseeable risks are in any event relatively rare. The article also analyzes recent trends in successor products liability, finding a mixed picture with some jurisdictions recently adopting {{one or both of the}} less restrictive approaches, and other courts adopting or hinting that they may adopt the restrictive traditional approach. The article concludes that none of the approaches seem likely to become a strong majority doctrine in the near future, but that corrective justice and public policy concerns favor utilizing the less restrictive approaches...|$|R
40|$|Australian {{insider trading}} laws {{prohibit}} {{a person from}} trading in securities whilst in possession of non-public, price-sensitive information. One of the essential elements of the insider trading offence is that the alleged insider must possess certain ‘inside information’. If the alleged insider trader is a company, how does that company ‘possess’ information? Must there be ‘knowledge’ or ‘awareness’ of the inside information, or is mere physical possession sufficient? The Corporations Act contains deeming provisions which <b>impute</b> certain <b>knowledge</b> of a company’s officers and directors to the company itself. General corporate law principles of agency may also apply to deem certain information to be within a company’s possession. How do these provisions and principles operate {{in the context of}} insider trading? Legal complexities associated with all of these issues will be examined in this article. 17 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Using a {{statistical}} model and a partial equilibrium economic search model, we develop a methodology for appraising {{the value of}} consumer information {{about the quality of}} health care providers and apply it to information about physicians' predispositions to perform cesarean section deliveries. There are three primary results. First, information's value is roughly proportional to a simple statistical metric of its accuracy; the constant of proportionality can be <b>imputed</b> from <b>knowledge</b> of consumer search methods and consumer preferences. Second, the function governing the production of information from data 'inputs' can have surprising economic properties, such as economies of scale, that usefully inform the efficient production of consumer information. These properties are robust even when the value of information cannot be precisely determined. Third, information's value is enhanced by the way physicians are sorted into hospitals but greatly attenuated by the presence of other dimensions of physician heterogeneity. Under plausible assumptions, the value of information in our empirical application is small enough that {{it is not surprising that}} consumers do not utilize it when selecting a physician.

60|$|Redclyffe was now {{established}} in the great house which {{had been so long}} and so singularly an object of interest with him. With his customary impressibility by the influences around him, he begun to take in the circumstances, and to understand them by more subtile tokens than he could well explain to himself. There was the steward, [Endnote: 1] or whatever was his precise office; so quiet, so subdued, so nervous, so strange! What had been this man's history? What was now the secret of his daily life? There he was, creeping stealthily up and down the staircases, and about the passages of the house; always as if he were afraid of meeting somebody. On seeing Redclyffe in the house, the latter fancied that the man expressed a kind of interest in his face; but whether pleasure or pain he could not well tell; only he sometimes found that he was contemplating him from a distance, or from the obscurity of the room in which he sat,--or from a corridor, while he smoked his cigar on the lawn. A great part, if not the whole of this, he <b>imputed</b> to his <b>knowledge</b> of Redclyffe's connections with the Doctor; but yet this hardly seemed sufficient to account for the pertinacity with which the old man haunted his footsteps,--the poor, nervous old thing,--always near him, or often unexpectedly so; and yet apparently not very willing to hold conversation with him, having nothing of importance to say.|$|R
60|$|February 5.--R. One R. will do to-day. If this cursed {{rheumatism}} {{gives way}} to February weather, I will allow she has some right {{to be called a}} spring month, to which otherwise her pretensions are slender. I worked this morning till two o'clock, and visited Mr. Grant's[464] pictures, who has them upon sale. They seem, to my inexperienced eye, genuine, or at least, good paintings. But I fear picture-buying, like horse-jockeyship, is a profession a gentleman cannot make much of without laying aside some of his attributes. The pictures are too high-priced, I should think, for this market. There is a very knowing catalogue by Frank Grant himself. Next went to see a show of wild beasts; it was a fine one. I think they keep them much cleaner than formerly, when the strong smell generally gave me a headache for the day. The creatures are also much tamer, which I <b>impute</b> to more <b>knowledge</b> of their habits and kind treatment. A lion and tigress went through their exercise like poodles--jumping, standing, and lying down at the word of command. This is rather degrading. I would have the Lord Chancellor of Beasts good-humoured, not jocose. I treated the elephant, who was a noble fellow, to a shilling's worth of cakes. I wish I could have enlarged the space in which so much bulk and wisdom is confined. He kept swinging his head from side to side, looking as if he marvelled why all the fools that gaped at him were at liberty, and he cooped up in the cage.|$|R
40|$|A model {{predictive}} control (MPC) framework {{is used to}} determine how to optimize the distribution of energy resources across a central energy facility including chillers, water heaters, and thermal energy storage; present the results to an operator; and execute the plan. The objective of this MPC framework is to minimize cost in real-time in response to both real-time energy prices and demand charges as well as allow the operator to appropriately interact with the system. Operators must be given the correct intersection points in order to build trust before they are willing to turn the tool over and put it into fully autonomous mode. Once in autonomous mode, operators {{need to be able to}} intervene and <b>impute</b> their <b>knowledge</b> of the facilities they are serving into the system without disengaging optimization. For example, an operator may be working on a central energy facility that serves a college campus on Friday night before a home football game. The optimization system is predicting the electrical load, but does not have knowledge of the football game. Rather than try to include every possible factor into the prediction of the loads, a daunting task, the optimization system empowers the operator to make human-in-the-loop decisions in these rare scenarios without exiting autonomous (auto) mode. Â Without this empowerment, the operator either takes the system out of auto mode or allows the system to make poor decisions. Both scenarios will result in an optimization system that has low â€œon timeâ€ and thus saves little money. A cascaded, model {{predictive control}} framework lends itself well to allowing an operator to intervene. The system presented is a four tiered approach to central plant optimization. The first tier is the prediction of the energy loads of the campus; i. e., the inputs to the optimization system. The predictions are made for a week in advance, giving the operator ample time to react to predictions they do not agree with and override the predictions if they feel it necessary. The predictions are inputs to the subplant-level optimization. The subplant-level optimization determines the optimal distribution of energy across major equipment classes (subplants and storage) for the prediction horizon and sends the current distribution to the equipment level optimization. The operators are able to use the subplant-level optimization for â€œadvisoryâ€ only and enter their own load distribution into the equipment level optimization. This could be done if they feel that they need to be conservative with the charge of the tank. Finally, the equipment level optimization determines the devices to turn on and their setpoints in each subplant and sends those setpoints to the building automation system. These decisions can be overridden, but should be extremely rare as the system takes device availability, accumulated runtime, etc. as inputs. Building an optimization system that empowers the operator ensures that the campus owner realizes the full potential of his investment. Optimal plant control has shown over 10 % savings, for large plants this can translate to savings of more than US $ 1 million per year...|$|R
