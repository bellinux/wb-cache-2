In this paper, an optimization procedure is presented, aiming to select the best combination of control parameters of a twincylinder turbocharged engine in different operating conditions. A detailed 1 D simulation model of the whole engine is firstly developed and validated against experimental data in WOT conditions and in predefined low load operating points. The model is developed within GT-Power, commercial code environment, but employs a in-house developed routine to simulate the combustion process. The latter takes into account the effects on heat release induced by variations on in-cylinder flow field and gas composition. Both of them, in fact, are substantially modified by the actual strategy specified for the intake valve control. The 1 D model is then coupled to an external optimizer (ModeFRONTIER) to perform the minimization of the fuel consumption at defined low-load operating points, with imposed constraints on the <b>intake</b> <b>mouth</b> radiated gasdynamic noise.

Intake systems of coastal power stations offer {{a unique opportunity to}} study the effect of water flow on benthic organisms under field conditions. The cooling water intake system of a tropical coastal power station is used as an experimental facility to study the effect of flow on the recruitment and growth of three mussel species, viz, Brachidontes variabilis, B. striatulus, and Modiolus philippinarum. The study was prompted by earlier observation that these mussels were numerically abundant in the biofouling community present inside the seawater intake tunnel of the power station, even though their occurrence in the benthic community in the coastal waters outside was only nominal. Recruitment data showed that the three mussel species very successfully colonised surfaces exposed to the <b>intake</b> <b>mouth</b> (characterised by relatively high flow) of the power station. Significant difference was observed in the recruitment recorded at the intake point and the ambient environment outside. Under high flow condition, the growth rates of all the three mussel species were uniformly enhanced.

Presented results show that, at low engine speed, the VVA setting realizing the lowest fuel consumption also produces an acceptable overall noise level. On the contrary, a small fuel consumption penalty must be paid at medium speed to realize a sufficiently low radiated noise.

However, at very low loads, the control of the air-flow motion and the turbulence intensity inside the cylinder may require to select a proper combination of the butterfly throttling and the intake valve control, to get the highest BSFC (Brake Specific Fuel Consumption) reduction. Moreover, a low throttling, while improving the fuel consumption, may also produce an increased gas-dynamic noise at the <b>intake</b> <b>mouth.</b> In highly “downsized” engines, the intake valve control is also linked to the turbocharger operating point, which may be changed by acting on the waste-gate valve. Depending on the valve lift and the actual exhaust pressure, different internal-EGR levels can be achieved, requiring a variation in the spark advance as well. Of course, the introduction of new degrees of freedom to the engine control poses new problems in terms of engine calibration and tuning. To best exploit the potential offered by these systems, new methodologies and development tools must be utilized as well. In this paper, an optimization procedure is presented, aiming to select the best combination of four control parameters (intake valve closure angle, butterfly valve opening, waste-gate opening and spark advance) of a twin-cylinder turbocharged engine in different operating conditions. A detailed 1 D simulation model of the whole engine is firstly developed and validated against the experimental data in WOT conditions and in predefined low load operating points. The model is developed within GT-Power™ commercial code environment, but employs an in-house routine that is implemented to simulate the combustion process. This routine takes into account the effects on the heat release induced by the variations of the in-cylinder flow field, turbulence and internal-EGR. These, in fact, are substantially modified by the actual strategy specified for the engine control. An external module is implemented to evaluate the intake valve lift profile {{as a function of the}} closure angle and the engine speed. The 1 D prediction of the gas-dynamic noise at the <b>intake</b> <b>mouth</b> is further validated through the comparison with the results obtained by the unsteady 3 D CFD analysis of the flow field within the air-box device. The 1 D computed pressure profile downstream the device is utilized as boundary condition for the 3 D model.

The optimization procedure identifies the best combinations of the previously selected control parameters with the goal of minimizing both the fuel consumption and the gas-dynamic noise, for defined low-load lowspeed operating points. The procedure is validated against the experimental data obtained by a calibration of the engine at the test-bed. The values of the control parameters selected by the optimizer well agree with the experimentally identified ones. Alternative settings are also proposed with the aim to substantially reducing the radiated noise with limited or no penalty for the BSFC.

40|$|Free surface {{vortices}} at intakes {{can cause}} excessive vibration, efficiency loss, structural damage, and flow reduction in hydroturbines, pumps, culverts, etc. They {{can also be}} a safety hazard and a potential loss of life. One of the major problems encountered during intake design is the specification of submergence and other design parameters in order to avoid strong free surf ace vortex formation. A properly conceived model study will determine whether free surface vortices are likely to occur. Before that point, however, the engineer needs to develop a preliminary design and then decide if a model study is needed. In order to assist in preliminary intake design, a plot of dimensionless submergence versus intake Froude number is presented for a number of vertical and horizontal intakes from both field and laboratory observations. The pilot is divided into two regions: 1) a region where intake vortices are unlikely and a model study is not required except with extremely poor approach conditions, and 2) a region with a good possibility of intake vortices, and a model study is recommended. Region 2, where intake vortices are a good possibility, is very large; encompassing many intake facilities. This is because minimum intake submergence to avoid vortex formation is highly dependent upon approach conditions, which are site specific. In order to add some clarity to this limited design criteria, an experimental study was undertaken which focused upon typical intake approach conditions. Most hydropower intakes have a forebay to avoid high circulation near the intake, so the experimental study simulated approach conditions with a fore bay or approach channel of varying length and width. The experiments were limited to vertical be 11 <b>mouth</b> <b>intakes.</b> The tendency for vortex formation is enhanced by separation around {{the leading edge of the}} approach channel walls.

40|$|AbstractModern {{internal}} combustion engines (ICEs) {{are becoming more}} and more complex in order to achieve not only better power and torque performance, but also to respect the pollutant emissions and the fuel consumption (CO 2) limits. The turbocharger, advanced valve actuation systems (VVA) and the EGR circuit allow the ICE's load control together with the traditional throttle valve and spark advance. Thus, an higher number of operating parameters are available for the calibration engineer to achieve the required performance target (minimum fuel consumption at part load, maximum power and torque at full load, etc.). On the other hand, the increased degrees of freedom may frustrate the potentialities of so complex systems because of the effort needed to identify the optimal engine control strategies. The development of proper numerical models may assist and direct the experimental activity in order to reduce the related times and costs. Although VVA solutions could bring a reduction in the specific fuel consumption thanks to an important de-throttling of the intake system, unfortunately they can simultaneously lead to higher noise levels radiated by the <b>intake</b> <b>mouth.</b> In fact, in this case, the pressure waves travelling through the intake ducts are not properly damped by the throttle valve. In this paper a numerical methodology is developed to define the engine calibration and the intake valve lift profile that simultaneously minimize the BSFC and the noise at part load. The engine object of the study is a turbocharged Spark-Ignition Direct Injection (SIDI) ICE equipped by a lost motion valve actuation system for the intake valves. In this study, the commercial 1 D thermo fluid-dynamic code GT-PowerTM is provided with user routines for the description of the combustion process and the handing of variable valve lift profiles. The engine model is thus integrated with a commercial optimization code (modeFRONTIERTM) to identify the optimized load control strategies to achieve the set objectives. The proposed methodology is also used for the definition of unconventional valve lift profiles. Particularly, the advantages related to the use of a small pre-lift before the main valve lift profile are estimated compared to a conventional EIVC strategy...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} work, a {{downsized}} VVA Spark Ignition engine is numerically and experimentally studied. In particular, the following topics are considered: •In-cylinder turbulence and combustion processes; •Knock and cycle by cycle variation (CCV) phenomena; •Techniques aiming to mitigate knock occurrence and improve fuel economy such as EGR and water injection methods; •Intake system redesign {{to reduce the}} emitted gas-dynamic noise; •Engine calibration. A deep experimental campaign is carried out to characterize the engine behaviour. Indeed, engine system is investigated {{both in terms of}} the overall performance (torque, power, fuel consumption, air flow rate, boost pressure etc.) and of the intake gas-dynamic noise at full load operation. In addition, proper experimental analyses are peformed on the engine to characterize the CCV phenomenon and the knock occurrence. Measured data are post-processed to derive experimental parameters which syntetize CCV and knock levels, according to the engine operating conditions. A 1 D CFD model of the whole engine is realized in GT-PowerTM environment. Refined “in-house developed” sub-models capable to reproduce turbulence, combustion, CCVs and knock processes are introduced into 1 D code through user routines. First of all, the whole engine model is validated against the experimental data both in terms of overall performance parameters and ensemble averaged pressure cycles and intake gas-dynamic noise at part and full load operation. Cycle by cycle variation is reproduced through a proper correlation and consequently a representative faster than average in-cylinder pressure cycle is obtained. Then, the knock model, with reference to the latter pressure cycle, allows to evaluate a proper knock index and to identify the knock limited spark advance (KLSA), basing on the same threshold level adopted in experimental knock analysis. In this way, the knock model taking into account the CCV is validated at full load operation. Once validated, the original engine architecture is modified by virtually installing a “Low pressure” EGR system. 1 D simulations accounting for various EGR rates and mixture leaning are performed at full load points, showing improvements in the fuel economy with the same knock intensity of the base engine configuration. Water injection technique is also investigated by virtually mounting a water injector in the intake runners for each engine cylinder. In a similar way, 1 D analyses are carried out for various water/fuel and air-to-fuel ratios, highlightinig BSFC improvements at full load operation. Since the engine under study is characterized by higher intake gas-dynamic noise levels, a partial redesign of the intake system is properly identified and subsequently tested with 1 D and 3 D CFD simulations to numerically quantify the gains in terms of reduction in the gas-dynamic noise emitted at the <b>intake</b> <b>mouth.</b> Finally, a numerical methodology aiming to calibrate the considered engine at high load knock-limited and at part load operations is developed. First, it shows the capability to identify with satisfactory accuracy the experimentally advised engine calibration. In addition, it allows the comparison of different intake valve strategies, underlining, in certain engine operating conditions, the fuel consumption benefits of an early intake valve closure (EIVC) strategy with respect to a Full Lift one, due to a better combustion phasing and a reduced mixture over-fuelling. The developed automatic procedure presents the capability to realize a “virtual” engine calibration on completely theoretical basis and proves to be very helpful in reducing time and costs related to experimental activities at the test bench...|$|E
40|$|Blood volume tests made on {{a number}} of {{soldiers}} recovering from hemorrhage have shown that in many instances dilution of the blood occurs very slowly. The principal reasons for this seem to be (a) an initial lack of reserve fluid of the tissues, and (b) the absence of any subsequent attempt by the body to make up this fluid deficiency. By putting such patients on a large fluid <b>intake</b> by <b>mouth</b> and rectum it has been found that their blood volume can be promptly and greatly increased. Hemorrhage cases transfused, yet still showing a low blood volume, were first treated in this way. Then the effect of forced fluids without transfusion was tried. Immediately after a hemorrhage, or as soon as the patient came under observation, he was given large quantities of water by mouth, and salt solution by rectum. Under such treatment the blood pressure soon began to show a progressive rise, the volume increased, and the red cells became more evenly redistributed, as shown by the relative hemoglobin percentages of the capillary and venous blood. These changes were often well marked after only 2 or 3 hours of the treatment. More than this, forcing fluids in cases where the amount of bleeding is difficult to estimate on account of the presence of a high hemoglobin percentage is of distinct value, since the dilution of the blood which results serves to show the extent of the hemorrhage through the drop in hemoglobin that it entails. In attempting to determine the condition of the patient after hemorrhage with a view to deciding the most suitable form of treatment, it is of much importance to learn the total blood loss—which is often not even indicated by the hemoglobin concentration of the remaining blood. With a total hemoglobin reduced to 25 per cent or under transfusion is needful. New blood is necessary, not only to supply more oxygen-carrying cells, but also because it actually enables the circulation to increase its volume. For, as has been pointed out in Paper I, the hemoglobin percentage must be above a certain point if a rapid restoration of the blood volume by means of the organism's own activities is to come about. With the total hemoglobin above 25 per cent the chief need is for increased blood volume, and if the patient's condition demands an immediate and large addition of circulating fluid, gum acacia solution should be given. If the condition is not so urgent, forced fluids by the alimentary tract are indicated. The blood volume can be considerably reduced and yet a normal blood pressure maintained. It is pointed out that the vasomotor mechanism which, has adapted itself to the diminished blood bulk may in any individual case be very near the margin of its compensatory power. Increased strain in such instances may cause a failure of this mechanism with a resulting fall in blood pressure. The beneficial results of forced fluids after secondary hemorrhage suggest the value of the early use of fluids by the alimentary tract in cases of primary hemorrhage...|$|R
40|$|Stroke is a {{preventable}} disease. Minor {{stroke and}} {{transient ischaemic attack}} (TIA) are important warning signs {{of the possibility of}} a major stroke. Worldwide, stroke is the third most common killer and the largest cause of disability. The incidence of stroke is predicted to increase with the predominance of unhealthy lifestyles and the aging population. The adoption of a healthy lifestyle can reduce many of the risk factors. This descriptive study was designed to explore patients’ understanding of modifiable risk factors of cerebrovascular disease. It investigated lifestyle changes actually made, as well as the factors affecting patients’ decisions about whether to make lifestyle changes. The two major factors considered were patients’ sources and level of knowledge and their attitudes and beliefs around making changes. A convenience sample of patients who had suffered a minor stroke or TIA was recruited through a major metropolitan hospital. Thirty-five subjects responded to a postal questionnaire. The mean age was 68 years and 37 % of the subjects had sustained some disability {{as a result of the}} TIA or minor stroke. The results demonstrated that many subjects had a poor understanding of risk factors of stroke. While smoking was well recognised as a risk factor, subjects showed less awareness of other risk factors, such as excessive alcohol consumption and obesity. Subjects also reported significant confusion regarding diet. Sixty-six percent of subjects depended on doctors as their main source of health information. This may be problematic as the current shortages of General Practitioners has put pressure on doctors to keep appointment times short and reduce the time available for health education. The main barriers to lifestyle change, were lack of motivation, and inadequate, knowledge, guidance, and support and the inability to access good information. Although 83 % of subjects suffered from hypertension, medication was the accepted method of control, few subjects realised the significance of lifestyle factors. Nine percent of subjects were only diagnosed with hypertension after their stroke or TIA and few monitor their own blood pressure, despite the wide availability of home monitoring devices. From the findings of this study it is concluded that health promotion and education are very important strategies in the prevention of stroke and it is recommended that this kind of education begins in childhood with tailored, age-specific programs delivered to the public over the lifespan. The role of health screening cannot be underestimated in the detection of risk factors such as hypertension and obesity. Early detection makes effective treatment possible and helps prevent the occurrence of strokes, thus reducing the cost to the community. Long-term health strategies such as improving health resource distribution and enhancing health education are needed where patients and their families participate together in comprehensive education programs. It is hoped that this may lead to a shared understanding, which may translate to patients being more supported, and therefore more able, to make the necessary lifestyle changes. Dysphagia is a common complication following stroke, which can result in significant morbidity and mortality. Multidisciplinary collaboration facilitates management strategies, decision-making and the efficiency of rehabilitation. Nurses are responsible for coordination of management and in particular for continuous monitoring, assessment of swallowing and nutritional state, maintaining safety and preventing complications. An understanding of the issues and strategies relating to management may provide valuable information to enhance the safety, cost-effectiveness and quality of care. A retrospective review of patients’ medical records was used to collect data. A sample of ninety-five adults who were admitted to an Australian public hospital between January 2003 and April 2006, with a diagnosis of dysphagic stroke were recruited. Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) was used to analyse the quantitative data, while content analysis was used to analyse the qualitative data. All subjects were assessed by a speech pathologist, the mean age was 75 years and 50. 5 % were male. Except for critically ill subjects, almost all were assessed within three days. Ninety-six percent of subjects had communication problems and 81 % had upper limb motor impairment. During hospitalisation almost 60 % of subjects had an improvement in their oral intake including 8 % resuming their premorbid diet. Eighteen percent were on enteral tube feeding upon discharge, 4 % deteriorated and 16 % died. It appears that oral intake of most subjects was unsatisfactory. When recorded the mean body weight lost was 2. 3 kg. At least 22 % had malnutrition or dehydration. Forty-five percent aspirated and 22 % had respiratory infection. Almost half of the subjects (48 %) were discharged to aged care facilities. Eighty percent had no documented follow-up scheduled for management of their dysphagia. Early identification of dysphagia, prudent supervising of appropriate oral <b>intake</b> and <b>mouth</b> care may help to maintain safe swallowing, preventing aspiration and chest infection. Regular checks of body weight, serum albumin level, oral intake and early enteral feeding are essential to guide nutritional support, minimise malnutrition and problematic medication administration. Encouraging oral intake and providing families with support could promote recovery of swallowing skills and help patients to regain the ability to eat independently. Providing helpful information on the care options available may allay patient and family anxiety. A qualified nurse practitioner could assess patients and ensure that a tailored care plan was designed to meet patients’ needs and this may improve the outcomes considerably. Thesis (D.
