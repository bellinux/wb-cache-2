40|$|The {{problem of}} {{resource}} allocation for future <b>integrated</b> <b>broadband</b> <b>communication</b> networks (IBCNs) is addressed. It mainly involves resource allocation at the connection level. The resource allocation problem is decomposed {{into the following}} interdependent tasks: (i) given that a network can accommodate the bandwidth demand of a call request, determine a route for the corresponding asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) virtual connection, and (ii) allocate bandwidth, i. e., links inside the trunks of the chosen route, to this connection according to predefined limits on bandwidth use by various service calls. Hence, (i) is mainly {{the responsibility of the}} routing algorithm used by the network operator, while (ii) depends on the link allocation scheme used to reserve trunk bandwidth, i. e., links, for each service. Various link allocation schemes combined with routing algorithms are examined. Their performance in terms of service call blocking is evaluated using a software package developed for that purpose. It is shown that the traditional complete sharing (CS) and complete partitioning (CP) policies are not adequate for IBCNs. Movable boundary (MB) policies are more flexible and present near-optimal performance when access of broadband service to narrowband service resources is allowed and suitable routing algorithms are dynamically applied...|$|R
40|$|Numbering and {{addressing}} issues arising in the <b>Integrated</b> <b>Broadband</b> <b>Communication</b> Network (IBCN) {{for the support}} of the Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) and Personal Telecommunication Service (PTS) are dealt with in this paper. Mobile communications services will allow a user to roam within a network. Thus there will be a need to identify several types of objects (terminals, network points of attachment, users, Customer Premises Networks, etc.). The mobility properties of these objects will necessitate dynamic bindings between their addresses and names. Moreover, the situation is further complicated since the mobility may be embedded. A mobile user may employ a mobile terminal in a mobile Customer Premises Network (CPN). Therefore, in UMTS and PTS {{there is a need for}} dynamic binding of various identifiers with location information data. The exclusive use of Personal Telecommunication Numbers (PTN's) as Dialing Numbers (DN) is proposed in IBCN for UMTS and PTS. That is, PTN's will be used (during dialing) for making calls to mobile terminals, mobile users, as well as fixed subscribers. When the personal communication service is not provided, the DN corresponds to the terminal number of the equipment (fixed or mobile) of the called subscriber. Also, a proposal for the UMTS and PTS numbering plan is presented...|$|R

40|$|Wireless {{coverage}} of the end-user domain; be it outdoors or indoors, is poised to become {{an essential part of}} <b>broadband</b> <b>communication</b> networks. In order to offer <b>integrated</b> <b>broadband</b> services (combining voice, data, video, multimedia services, and new value added services), systems will need to offer higher data transmission capacities. The need for increased capacity per unit area leads to higher operating frequencies, smaller radio cells and large number of base stations (BSs), therefore cost-effective BS development is a key success to the market. For this radio over fiber (RoF) technology has been proposed since it provides functionally simple BSs that are connected to a central station (CS) via an optical fiber. A full-duplex data and video signal transmission over single-mode fiber (SMF) based on wavelengthdivision-multiplexing (WDM) and an optical add-drop multiplexing (OADM) technique is proposed and simulated. Four data signals of 1. 25 Gb/s / 9. 1 - 9. 4 GHz are transmitted over long-haul single-mode fiber for downlink transmission. For uplink transmission, four data signals, each from a BS, of 1. 25 Gb/s/ 9. 6 - 9. 9 GHz is used. Good bit error rate (BER) performances were achieved for both down-link and up-link transmissions in our full-duplex RoF transport system.
