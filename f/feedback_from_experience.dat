40|$|This conference {{paper is}} closed access. Information about the {{functional}} or operational {{performance of the}} product through life is useful in providing validation and updating of knowledge assumed at the design stage. The collection and exploitation of <b>feedback</b> <b>from</b> <b>experience</b> in service allows engineers to reassess and refine their original assumptions, and this new understanding in turn informs the next design cycle. Current feedback documentation of in-service occurrences (issues, requests, etc.) {{is found to be}} inconsistent, thus reducing the ability to reuse operational information for design improvements. We argue that enhanced information representation and organisation not only allows for improved retrieval in general but also provides a suitable basis for analysis and inference of design-induced issues from the information collection. The paper will discuss an approach to information organisation based on faceted classification to enhance retrieval and reuse of in-service information feedback...|$|E
40|$|Feedback is now {{accepted}} as a key factor affecting learning and a key feature of interpersonal communication. The term is absent from the older dictionaries, because it first began in electronics and then became a basic concept in the broader field of cybernetics, before it filtered through into psychology to attain the wider significance it carries today. In cybernetics feedback was first associated with self-regulatory systems; then systems theory raised the level of complexity to include the input of information from outside the system that was relevant to its performance. From there it filtered through into both behavioural and cognitive theories of learning from experience. <b>Feedback</b> <b>from</b> <b>experience</b> is not necessarily dependent on interpersonal communication. People can try things out, make mistakes, celebrate success and learn without any witnesses. Such feedback is largely determined by what is noticed, what is regarded as significant, how it is interpreted and whether it is stored in long term memory and/or contributes to current or future actions. When other people are involved in giving feedback, the same factors apply to {{the recipient of the}} feedback; but the perspective of the giver of feedback or of any observers may be very different. The feedback given i...|$|E
40|$|And {{the members}} of the {{dependability}} working-group of CIAME Club 18. 04 of SEE (Society of Electricity and Electronic) International audienceThe use of fieldbuses and the emergence of intelligent sensors and actuators are opening up new possibilities for distributed control systems, but are also introducing additional constraints in terms of achieving dependability objectives. The type of production environment will greatly determine the predominant criterion for an automatic control system, i. e. reliability, availability, maintainability, safety, etc. On the other hand, the choice of a fieldbus system will also depend on factors such as application size, data throughput, and integration of time considerations. Other important criteria include cost, confidentiality, and compatibility with existing equipment. Therefore, it appears essential that designers be given the means to assess dependability at each design step by integrating <b>feedback</b> <b>from</b> <b>experience.</b> Assessing dependability is too often limited to an evaluation {{at the end of the}} design process, which often involves reselecting previous choices. The main topic of this paper is to focus on the communication function which is a pivotal of intelligent distributed control systems. So this article is a synthesis of different aspects linked to the design of fieldbus based applications thanks to the contributors, who come from various fields. Consequently it highlights the main problem and give some ways to solve them...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the ASME/DOE Gen IV Task 7 Part I is to review the current {{experience}} on various high temperature reactor intermediate heat exchanger (IHX) concepts. There are several different IHX concepts that could be envisioned for HTR/VHTR applications {{in a range of}} temperature from 850 C to 950 C. The concepts that will be primarily discussed herein are: (1) Tubular Helical Coil Heat Exchanger (THCHE); (2) Plate-Stamped Heat Exchanger (PSHE); (3) Plate-Fin Heat Exchanger (PFHE); and (4) Plate-Machined Heat Exchanger (PMHE). The primary coolant of the NGNP is potentially subject to radioactive contamination by the core as well as contamination from the secondary loop fluid. To isolate the radioactivity to minimize radiation doses to personnel, and protect the primary circuit from contamination, intermediate heat exchangers (IHXs) have been proposed as a means for separating the primary circuit of the NGNP (Next Generation Nuclear Plant) or other process heat application from the remainder of the plant. This task will first review the different concepts of IHX that could be envisioned for HTR/VHTR applications in a range of temperature from 850 to 950 C. This will cover shell-and-tube and compact designs (including the platefin concept). The review will then discuss the maturity of the concepts in terms of design, fabricability and component testing (or <b>feedback</b> <b>from</b> <b>experience</b> when applicable). Particular attention will be paid to the feasibility of developing the IHX concepts for the NGNP with operation expected in 2018 - 2021. This report will also discuss material candidates for IHX applications and will discuss specific issues {{that will have to be}} addressed in the context of the HTR design (thermal aging, corrosion, creep, creep-fatigue, etc). Particular attention will be paid to specific issues associated with operation at the upper end of the creep regime...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Casting {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} methods in {{fracture}} treatment, yet shortcomings and problems with current materials are still clear. Here a novel composite casting material is presented. The material is thermoplastic, nontoxic, ab-solutely freely moldable in 3 D, and does not disturb X-ray analysis. After heating to + 62 - 64 o C, the material can be cut with a normal pair of scissors and can be shaped to suit individual anatomy. We also report the first clinical series of 33 wrist fractures treated with this wood-polymer composite material. The clinical results revealed that the cast is stable and highly durable, but still offers exceptional X-ray- radiolucent properties. The average casting time was 5. 3 min. Patient satisfaction was high, mainly due to the stability and the lightweight structure of the cast. The <b>feedback</b> <b>from</b> <b>experienced</b> orthopedic technicians was excellent...|$|R

40|$|AbstractEgg yolk {{stabilized}} butter sauces, such as hollandaise sauce, are classics in the French cuisine {{and adopted}} {{all over the}} world. They can be made using {{a number of different}} procedures. This study was done to determine how common butter sauce preparation methods influence perceptional parameters such as texture, mouthfeel and flavor. The goal was to evaluate the effects of the various preparation methods in order to gain control of the process and obtain the desired sauce properties. Five model sauces, prepared with the same amounts of ingredients, but with different procedures, were produced and analyzed. Sauce preparation methods differed regarding the amount of mechanical treatment, order of addition of ingredients, ingredient temperatures and states reached during production. The five model sauces were analyzed by particle size distribution, water and airiness measurements, microscopy, color measurement, descriptive sensory analysis and analysis of volatiles. Results demonstrated large differences between the explored types of hollandaise sauce, with texture and mouthfeel properties varying significantly with different preparation techniques. This study also included <b>feedback</b> <b>from</b> <b>experienced</b> chefs regarding their habits related to hollandaise sauce preparation...|$|R

40|$|International audienceOver {{the last}} decade, the {{practice}} {{of higher education in}} Europe has become highly diversified and more complex. Among the visible phenomena related to the organization of studies that have appeared there are new forms of teaching and learning linked to digital learning environments. Faced with these developments, sometimes called a revolution, actors—policy makers, teachers, students—have very {{little in the way of}} scientific results to rely on. Such practices are still relatively new, and research done in this area rarely goes beyond <b>feedback</b> <b>from</b> <b>experiences,</b> case studies and satisfaction surveys. As such, research has not yet produced sufficient knowledge to provide a solid basis for decision-making. This chapter aims to start to address the current lack of scientific work in this area. More specifically, its ambition is to provide a theoretical framework based on the state of the art as well as research trials to answer two major questions: 1. How do student characteristics and those of digital learning environments interact? 2. What are the configurations emerging from these interactions that can lead to quality learning?. The overarching outcome will be to make new forms of teaching and learning linked to digital learning environments in higher education more intelligible...|$|R
40|$|The pilot- and controller-in-the-loop {{simulation}} {{described in}} this paper demonstrates {{the potential benefits of}} a near-term trajectory-based operations concept with datalink communications. Near-term operations with datalink are characterized by a fleet of which not all aircraft are equipped with datalink communications (i. e., mixed equipage). The objectives of this simulation were to continue to develop capabilities such as the conflict resolution algorithm, as well as evaluate new capabilities and concepts such as tactical conflict detection and trajectory-based weather avoidance with <b>feedback</b> <b>from</b> <b>experienced</b> pilots and controllers. Conflict resolutions and tactical conflict detections were compared to controller actions. The direction of the conflict resolution maneuver advised by the algorithm agreed with controller actions 79 % of the time when both chose to apply the same type of resolution maneuver to the same aircraft. Comparing controller actions to conflicts detected by the tactical conflict detection function revealed no missed alerts and a false alert rate of 11 %. Trajectory-based weather avoidance functions received high ratings from the controllers for usefulness and ease of use. In particular, controllers noted weather avoidance reroutes originating from a simulated traffic management coordinator position alleviated their concerns about potentially disrupting traffic flow management plans, thus expediting the issuance of the reroutes.

40|$|The {{history of}} WWII and the Holocaust 1 gives many {{examples}} of moral dilemmas, hostile attitudes and violence, norms and values that challenged the basic conditions of human existence {{and the development of}} civilisation. Nonetheless, vernacular memory does not represent many historical facts and in many European countries disparities grow between family and public memory. The central theme of this text {{is that there is a}} growing gap between historiography and education related to the Holocaust predominantly in Central Eastern Europe. The most recent historiographical research in Poland and elsewhere tackles the issue of individual collaboration. The topic of collaboration, challenging collective national identities, is not present in the majority of new textbooks. In those textbooks, written for example in Poland following the 2008 educational reforms, the real context of rescuing Jews in a climate of fear of one’s own neighbours is omitted. A general lack of bad memories should be challenged. The lack of sustained institutional effort to incorporate shameful facts concerning the murder of Jewish co-citizens into curricula and textbooks distorts national identities.

5000|$|Since 1977 the {{international}} Bahá'í community has established several radio stations worldwide, {{particularly in the}} Americas. Programmes may include local news, music, topics related to socio-economic and community development, educational programmes focusing on indigenous language and culture, and Bahá'í introductory and deepening material. A project studied these radio stations through faculty from Northwestern University from 1980-1982, and briefly in 1983, and reviewed Bahá'í Radio projects in Peru and Bolivia as well and resulted in a PhD by Kurt John Hein in 1985 following which he took up service at WLGI Radio Bahá'í. A Bahá'í radio station was established in Peru to nurture and preserve the local culture by featuring local story-tellers and music recorded at station-sponsored annual indigenous music festivals.

40|$|Three {{decades of}} {{creating}} software to support design rationale showed the author how rationale processes can promote generation of novel ideas.

Critical conversations intertwine ideation and evaluation, using feedback about consequences of decisions to challenge designers to devise new ideas. Such conversations take two forms. The first is discussion involving <b>feedback</b> <b>from</b> speculation about consequences of design decisions for implementation and use.

40|$|There is {{a tension}} between the {{creative}} aspects of design and the scientific traditions on which contemporary higher education assessment protocols draw. Design has, similarly to art, traditionally been 'less concerned with the achievement of specifiable outcomes' (Eisner 1996 : 1) than with encouraging students in the creative design process, in the facilitation of creative thinking, {{in the development of}} projects that reflect critical integration of complex knowledge areas, and in enculturation and development of an embodied understanding of the profession (Ostwald & Williams 2008 a: 146). Central to these objectives is the notion of the design studio and the pedagogical significance of individual direction and <b>feedback</b> <b>from</b> <b>experienced</b> design instructors. The role of the individual tutor, instructor, master or lecturer has been at the core of conventional design education as it has developed from the medieval apprenticeship model and the Beaux Arts and Bauhaus approaches to the modern studio approach to teaching and learning design (Williams, Ostwald & Askland 2010 b). Similarly, assessment and evaluation have been founded largely upon the individual assessors' subjective and tacit understanding of the project at hand. Indeed, as argued by Ostwald and Williams (2008 a: 155) in relation to architectural education in Australasia, the complex and heuristic activity of design ultimately leads to judgement that inevitably becomes subjective. The subjective nature of such judgement is also a product of the difficulties associated with providing a benchmark for what design creativity - a learning outcome of the discipline - is, for what should be expected by students in regards to creativity at specific levels of study, and for breaking the notion, concept or phenomenon of creativity into tangible, objective, straight forward criteria...|$|R
