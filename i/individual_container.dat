40|$|Background: Aedes aegypti (L.) is {{the primary}} vector of dengue, the most {{important}} arboviral infection globally. Until an effective vaccine is licensed and rigorously administered, Ae. aegypti control remains the principal tool in preventing and curtailing dengue transmission. Accurate predictions of vector populations are required to assess control methods and develop effective population reduction strategies. Ae. aegypti develops primarily in artificial water holding containers. Release recapture studies indicate that most adult Ae. aegypti do not disperse over long distances. We expect, therefore, that containers {{in an area of}} high development site density {{are more likely to be}} oviposition sites and to be more frequently used as oviposition sites than containers that are relatively isolated from other development sites. After accounting for <b>individual</b> <b>container</b> characteristics, containers more frequently used as oviposition sites are likely to produce adult mosquitoes consistently and at a higher rate.

40|$|Abstract—Cargo {{containers}} whichtransport 90 percentof the world’s trade transit {{the countries}} of the world daily. Despite the vulnerability of cargo containers, only about 5 percent of the over 10 million cargo containers entering the U. S. each year can be inspected now. Our primary goal is to develop the smart container security system using RFID and Wireless Sensor Networks in order to enhance the cargo container security. In addition, the end-to-end visibility via this networked tracking and sensing capability can bring additional commercial benefits to supply chain and chain of custody. In this paper, we first propose a dynamic mesh container network among neighboring containers. Since a group of containers moves together, we can take advantages of interaction between them via this mesh container network instead of focusing an <b>individual</b> <b>container.</b> Second, we introduce the concept of Mobile Edge Computing Devices (MECD) which is the interface between distributed sensors and the end server in order to reduce processing and bandwidth requirements to the end servers.

40|$|We {{describe}} micromanipulation and microinjection {{procedures for}} the fabrication of soft-matter networks consisting of lipid bilayer nanotubes and surface-immobilized vesicles. These biomimetic membrane systems feature unique structural flexibility and expandability and, unlike solid-state microfluidic and nanofluidic devices prepared by top-down fabrication, they allow network designs with dynamic control over <b>individual</b> <b>containers</b> and interconnecting conduits. The fabrication is founded on self-assembly of phospholipid molecules, followed by micromanipulation operations, such as membrane electroporation and microinjection, to effect shape transformations of the membrane and create a series of interconnected compartments. Size and geometry of the network can be chosen according to its desired function. Membrane composition is controlled mainly during the self-assembly step, whereas the interior contents of <b>individual</b> <b>containers</b> is defined through a sequence of microneedle injections. Networks cannot be fabricated with other currently available methods of giant unilamellar vesicle preparation (large unilamellar vesicle fusion or electroformation). Described in detail are also three transport modes, which are suitable for moving water-soluble or membrane-bound small molecules, polymers, DNA, proteins and nanoparticles within the networks. The fabrication protocol requires ∼ 90 min, provided all necessary preparations are made in advance. The transport studies require an additional 60 - 120 min, depending on the transport regime. © 2011 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{detection}} of smuggled {{special nuclear material}} (SNM) and radiation dispersion devices (RDDs) into the United States (US) via intermodal cargo container (IMCC) remains a challenge in radiation detection, {{due in large part}} to the variability of cargo in an <b>individual</b> <b>container</b> and its impact on shielding sources from detection. Thus, it is important to understand how containerized cargo is shipped to the US, from which countries we receive different shipments, and to understand how naturally-occurring radioactive material (NORM) is shipped and can impact our capabilities to detect sources that may be used in potential weapons of mass destruction terrorism scenarios. As part of the Spreader Bar Radiation Detector project, PNNL analyzed US import data shipped through US ports collected over the 12 months of 2006 (over 4. 5 million containers). Using these data, we extracted a variety of distributions of interest to modelers and developers of active and passive detection systems used to “scan ” IMCCs for potential contraband.

More importantly, the availability of the data on all containers makes it possible to analyze the database to determine which general commodities are shipped overseas in IMCCs mor...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine attitudes and {{potential}} for sorting of food waste at restaurants in the central part of Umeå. The information was gathered through a questionnaire survey and by exploring different sorting methods. The questionnaire was sent to 55 restaurants and 24 of them responded. A majority of the respondents wanted to sort out food waste. 72. 8 % believe they have a good or moderate potential to sort out food waste in the future and none of the respondents answered that they believed that they had no means of sorting out food waste. Overall, the restaurants are considered to have good attitudes about sorting food waste. However, this may be because the respondents have a better attitude than those who chose not to respond. The sorting methods were evaluated by reviewing reports written by government agencies and industry associations.

It is known that critical factors to the shelf life of alginate includer avoidance of moisture contamination which may lead to premature setting of the alginate and avoidance of high temperature which may cause depolymerization of the alginate. Purpose: The {{aim of this study}} was to determine storage duration effect of repacked alginates on deformation recovery. Methods: Two brands of alginates (Tulip®TU, and Aroma Fine DF III®AF) were repacked into 120 plastic containers. The samples were stored in room condition (temperature 29 ° C ± 1 ° C, relative humidity 60 % ± 10 %) for 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 weeks. The alginates setting time and recovery from deformation were measured according to the ANSI/ADA specification number 18 (ISO 1563). result: The results revealed that there was decreased setting time during 5 weeks but there was slight decreased in deformation recovery after 3 weeks storage. The ANOVA showed there was no significant difference of alginates deformation recovery among the storage times (p > 0. 05). Conclusion: Storage duration of repacked alginates in plastic containers during 5 weeks in room condition do not influence the alginate deformation recovery. </span...|$|E
