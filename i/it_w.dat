5000|$|Edwin Thomas Penfold, {{who made}} his fortune working on the goldfields and by {{establishing}} a successful tobacco business in Sydney, {{was living in the}} suburb of Randwick, at a cottage called Sandgate, when he decided to purchase 6 acres of land at Church Street, Burwood, in 1871. He ordered the construction of Woodstock, a two-storey, Victorian Italianate villa, where he moved in with his wife Susannah Clarke. His son was later born there. (It is believed the name Woodstock was derived from the novel written by Sir Walter Scott, published in 1826, named [...] Woodstock.) The house remained with the Penfold family until 1895. One of Penfold's descendents would later buy William Moffitt's printing and stationery firm and renamed <b>it</b> <b>W.</b> C. Penfold & Co, one of the largest stationary companies in Australia.|$|E

Despite pressure from Dublin Castle to stop the production, it went ahead. Shaw refused to make any of the changes requested by the censor, but did make two changes in the play at the suggestion of Lady Gregory, as he believed they were improvements, but they {{had nothing to do with}} the issues raised by the censorship.

50|$|Ngatuere's {{frequent}} rages {{and acts}} of violence earned him an unfavourable reputation among settlers who were, however, happy enough to accept his protection when they needed <b>it.</b> <b>W.</b> B. D. Mantell described him as a bully. However, {{a man of his}} time and standing would have been under a severe strain in coping with the coming of colonisation. And in fact he did respond positively to those changes, even though an old man. He learned to write fluently in Maori and was capable of dealing shrewdly with Europeans over land matters. He consistently opposed the agents of the Crown who were seeking to buy land, and was able to hold on to his own interests when others were losing theirs. While others failed to protect themselves, he was able to prevent the settler B. P. Perry from occupying a section of the Taratahi block, and to remove C. B. Borlase from his Waihakeke run.|$|E

After Casement's death, the British {{authorities}} {{held the}} diaries in conditions of extraordinary secrecy, arousing strong suspicions among Casement's supporters {{that they were}} forged. In 1936, there appeared a book by an American doctor, William J. Maloney, called The Forged Casement Diaries. After reading <b>it,</b> <b>W.</b> B. Yeats wrote a protest poem, [...] "Roger Casement", which was published with great prominence in The Irish Press. In the fifth stanza of the poem, Yeats named Alfred Noyes and called on him to desert {{the side of the}} forger and perjurer. Noyes immediately responded with a letter to The Irish Press in which he explained why he had assumed the diaries were authentic, confessed he might have been misled, and called for the setting up of a committee to examine the original documents and settle the matter. In response to what he called Noyes' [...] "noble" [...] letter, Yeats amended his poem, removing Noyes' name.|$|E

50|$|The undocumented {{origin of}} the company goes back to 1730 when James Ford {{established}} the business in Digbeth. On Joseph Balden the then owner's death in 1813 William and Thomas Avery took over his scalemaking business and in 1818 renamed <b>it</b> <b>W</b> & T Avery. The business rapidly expanded and in 1885 they owned three factories: the Atlas Works in West Bromwich, the Mill Lane Works in Birmingham and the Moat Lane Works in Digbeth. In 1891 the business became a limited company with {{a board of directors}} and in 1894 the shares were quoted on the London Stock Exchange. In 1895 the company bought the legendary Soho Foundry in Smethwick, a former steam engine factory owned by James Watt & Co. In 1897 the move was complete and the steam engine business was gradually converted to pure manufacture of weighing machines. The turn of the century was marked by managing director William Hipkins' determined efforts in broadening the renown of the Avery brand and transforming the business into a specialist manufacturer of weighing machines. By 1914 the company occupied an area of 32,000m² and had some 3000 employees.|$|E
