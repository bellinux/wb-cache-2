25|$|Through the {{humanities}} we {{reflect on the}} fundamental question: What <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> human? The humanities offer clues but never a complete answer. They reveal how people have tried to make moral, spiritual, and intellectual sense of a world where irrationality, despair, loneliness, and death are as conspicuous as birth, friendship, hope, and reason.|$|E

[...] The college students will each receive a $20,000 scholarship over a two-year period. The winners, announced on The Savage Nation radio show, were selected from approximately 1,700 entries. Savage launched the $100,000 scholarship fund in early 2015 {{with the intention of}} promoting traditional American values among conservative college students.|$|E
500|$|An {{entertainment}} {{might go}} beyond gratification and produce some insight in its audience. [...] Entertainment may skillfully consider universal philosophical questions such as: [...] "What {{is the meaning}} of life?"; [...] "What <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> human?"; [...] "What {{is the right thing to}} do?"; or [...] "How do I know what I know?". Questions such as these drive many narratives and dramas, whether they are presented in the form of a story, film, play, poem, book, dance, comic, or game. Dramatic examples include Shakespeare's influential play Hamlet, whose hero articulates these concerns in poetry; and films, such as The Matrix, which explores the nature of knowledge and was released world-wide. Novels give great scope for investigating these themes while they entertain their readers. An example of a creative work that considers philosophical questions so entertainingly that it has been presented in a very wide range of forms is The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Originally a radio comedy, this story became so popular that it has also appeared as a novel, film, television series, stage show, comic, audiobook, LP record, adventure game and online game, its ideas became popular references (see Phrases from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy) and has been translated into many languages. Its themes encompass the meaning of life, as well as [...] "the ethics of entertainment, artificial intelligence, multiple worlds, God, and philosophical method".|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} positive reviews. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix said he {{was particularly}} interested in the Marie and Jesse characters this episode, and called it a credit to the show's evolution that the supporting cast subplots can be so interesting without Walt. He also praised David Slade's direction, particularly during the jumpshots in Jesse's scenes. Seth Amitin of IGN called it a [...] "great episode" [...] and an improvement over the previous two, [...] "Box Cutter" [...] and [...] "Thirty-Eight Snub". He praised the way Skyler's character proved herself to both Walter and Saul, and praised Betsy Brandt's performance, claiming her subplot provided much-needed comic relief and reminded him of the works of David Sedaris. Entertainment Weekly writer Melissa Maerz praised the development of Skyler's character and said the episode touched upon a common theme in Breaking Bad about masculinity. With Skyler asserting herself in Walter's work, and Hank taking out his insecurities about being disabled on Marie, Maerz said the script raises the question, [...] "What <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a strong man?" [...] Los Angeles Times writer Todd VanDerWerff called it [...] "one of the best episodes this show has ever done", despite diverting the attention from Walter to the support cast members. VanDerWerff said the episode well demonstrated how Walter's actions affected others around him and said Marie's character was more interesting than in the past.|$|E
500|$|In {{writing for}} Batman, Hill {{considered}} that a fundamental {{aspect of the}} character was how he interacts with his villains, allies, and the city around him. Hill said: [...] "You know, what <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Batman? ...How does it affect Batman when things happen to him? What is his psychological make up? Those are the influences behind the game... you actually delve into the psyche of what makes him what he is, which is where I think {{so much of the}} interest in Batman is." [...] Batman's armor was redesigned to match that of the Batmobile to make them appear visually similar—featuring the same shapes and material textures—and appear functionally compatible with the high-speed methods in which the character enters and exits the vehicle. The design also added armor over Batman's shoulders, covering the previously exposed cape, to make it appear more feasible that it could hold Batman's weight without failing during gliding. For other returning characters, art director David Hego said that the designs were conceived to keep them interesting after players had seen them several times before in previous games, while the game's autumnal setting also necessitated a change in character clothing over the winter setting of Arkham City. The Penguin lost his long coat, and was made to look dirtier, his clothing showing signs of sweat and food stains, and his head was shaved. For Two-Face, the designers felt the character did not require changing significantly, and instead emphasized existing character traits, particularly his disfigured flesh, using references of burnt flesh as inspiration. Similarly, they wanted to retain the typical Riddler characterizations like green shirts emblazoned with question marks, but instead had the character design evolve throughout the game, modifying his own costume in response to the events of the plot.|$|E

[...] or [...] "What {{is the relationship between}} Christian freedom and this social institution?" [...] Parsons finds the implications to be profound. Even slaves are responsible; the possibility of living a Christian life depends solely on Christ’s grace―not circumstance.|$|E

2500|$|Kierkegaard {{began to}} write again in 1847. His first work in this period was Edifying Discourses in Diverse Spirits which {{was made up of}} three parts. It {{included}} Purity of Heart is to Will One Thing, What we Learn from the Lilies in the Field and from the Birds in the Air, and The Gospel of Sufferings. These questions are asked, What <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a single individual who wants to do the good? What <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a human being? What does it mean to follow Christ? He now moves from [...] "upbuilding (Edifying) discourses" [...] to [...] " [...] discourses", however, he still maintains that these are not [...] "sermons". [...] A sermon is about struggle with oneself about the tasks life offers one and about repentance for not completing the tasks. Later, in 1849, he wrote [...] discourses and Godly discourses.Is it really hopelessness to reject the task because it is too heavy; is it really hopelessness almost to collapse under the burden because it is so heavy; is it really hopelessness to give up hope out of fear of the task? Oh no, but this is hopelessness: to will with all one's might-but there is no task. Thus, only if there is nothing to do and if the person who says it were without guilt before God-for if he is guilty, there is indeed always something to do-only if there is nothing to do and this is understood to mean that there is no task, only then is there hopelessness.

2500|$|In {{attempting}} to define noise music and its value, Paul Hegarty (2007) cites {{the work of}} noted cultural critics Jean Baudrillard, Georges Bataille and Theodor Adorno and through their work traces the history of [...] "noise". He defines noise at different times as [...] "intrusive, unwanted", [...] "lacking skill, not being appropriate" [...] and [...] "a threatening emptiness". He traces these trends starting with 18th-century concert hall music. Hegarty contends that it is John Cage's composition 4'33", in which an audience sits through {{four and a half}} minutes of [...] "silence" [...] (Cage 1973), that represents the beginning of noise music proper. For Hegarty, [...] "noise music", as with 4'33", is that music made up of incidental sounds that represent perfectly the tension between [...] "desirable" [...] sound (properly played musical notes) and undesirable [...] "noise" [...] that make up all noise music from Erik Satie to NON to Glenn Branca. Writing about Japanese noise music, Hegarty suggests that [...] "it is not a genre, {{but it is also a}} genre that is multiple, and characterized by this very multiplicity... Japanese noise music can come in all styles, referring to all other genres... but crucially asks the question of genre—what <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> categorized, categorizable, definable?" [...] (Hegarty 2007:133).|$|E
6000|$|Yet {{the fact}} is undeniable that Hindoo Mysticism has failed of {{practical}} result--that it has died down into brutal fakeerism. We look in vain, however, in Mr. Vaughan's chapter for an explanation of this fact, save his assertion, which we deny, that Hindoo Mysticism was in essence and at its root wrong and rotten. Mr. Maurice ("Moral and Metaphysical Philosophy," [...] p. 46) seems to point to a more charitable solution. [...] "The Hindoo," [...] he says, [...] "whatsoever vast discovery he may have made at an early period of a mysterious Teacher near him, working on his spirit, {{who is at the}} same time Lord over nature, began the search from himself--he had no other point from whence to begin--and therefore it ended in himself. The purification of his individual soul became practically his highest conceivable end; to carry out that he must separate from society. Yet the more he tries to escape self the more he finds self; for what are his thoughts about Brahm, his thoughts about Krishna, save his own thoughts? Is Brahm a projection of his own soul? To sink in him, <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> nothing? Am I, after all, my own law?
