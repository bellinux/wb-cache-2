25|$|The TRAXX P160 AC is the {{passenger}} {{version of this}} class, with a correspondingly higher top speed of 160km/h. A lower unsprung mass was achieved by using <b>hollow</b> <b>shaft</b> final drives instead of the axle hung motor arrangement of the 140km/h maximum speed versions. The bogies and drive unit {{are the same as}} used in the DBAG Class 146.0.|$|E
25|$|The <b>hollow</b> <b>shaft</b> {{mechanism}} {{lets the}} DCT operate sequentially, the car anticipating the next gear {{that the driver}} is likely to need next under acceleration or braking, or jump immediately to any of its seven forward gears (and reverse). This is particularly useful under kickdown or heavy braking, allowing the driver to remain {{in control of the}} vehicle at all times.|$|E
25|$|Between 2000 and 2002, {{a version}} of the DBAG Class 145 for {{passenger}} trains, with <b>hollow</b> <b>shaft</b> final drive and a higher top speed of 160km/h, was produced for DB's regional business area DB Regio. The top of the front of the carbodies was modified to provide space for a flip-disc display. These locomotives were given the designation DBAG Class 146.0.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a new method for manufacturing <b>hollow</b> <b>shafts,</b> where tubes {{are used as}} billet. First, {{the design of a}} specially designed forging machine for rotary compression is described. The machine is then numerically tested with regard to its strength, and the effect of elastic strains of the roll system on the quality of produced parts is determined. The machine’s strength is calculated by the finite element method using the NX Nastran program. Technological capabilities of the machine are determined, too. Next, the results of the modeling of the rotary compression process for a <b>hollow</b> stepped <b>shafts</b> by the finite element method are given. The process for manufacturing <b>hollow</b> <b>shafts</b> was modeled using the Simufact. Forming simulation program. The FEM results are then verified experimentally in the designed forging machine for rotary compression. The experimental results confirm that axisymmetric <b>hollow</b> <b>shafts</b> can be produced by the rotary compression method. It is also confirmed that numerical methods are suitable for investigating both machine design and metal forming processes...|$|R

25|$|Innovative hollow double-gear {{input shaft}} allows quick shifts. The DCT {{is made up}} of two dry clutches, each fitted with {{electric}} motor-driven clutch actuator to improve responsiveness, and an innovative hollow double-gear input shaft. The <b>hollow</b> <b>shaft</b> itself allows the system to quickly engage even gears, while a solid shaft that runs through the middle operates odd gears. This crossed gear shifting enables continuous power delivery and more efficient packaging, two development cornerstones for the engineering teams behind the project.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{other systems}} were devised as the {{electric}} locomotive matured. [...] The Buchli drive was a fully spring-loaded system, {{in which the}} weight of the driving motors was completely disconnected from the driving wheels. First used in electric locomotives from the 1920s, the Buchli drive was mainly used by the French SNCF and Swiss Federal Railways. The quill drive was also developed about this time and mounted the traction motor above or {{to the side of the}} axle and coupled to the axle through a reduction gear and a <b>hollow</b> <b>shaft</b> - the quill - flexibly connected to the driving axle. The Pennsylvania Railroad GG1 locomotive used a quill drive. Again, as traction motors continued to shrink in size and weight, quill drives gradually fell out of favour.|$|E

40|$|Analytical {{solutions}} for the elastoplastic deformation of rotating graded <b>hollow</b> <b>shafts</b> are presented. The modulus of elasticity of the shaft material is assumed to vary nonlinearly in the radial direction. The plastic model is based on Tresca’s yield criterion, its associated flow rule, and ideal plastic material behavior. Elastic, partially plastic, fully plastic, and residual stress states are investigated. It is observed that the elastoplastic responses of the rotating functionally graded <b>hollow</b> <b>shafts</b> are affected notably by the material nonhomogeneity. It is also observed that the fully plastic limit rotation speed of the shaft is almost independent {{of the variation in}} the modulus of elasticity of the material. The nonhomogeneous solution derived here reduces to that of a homogeneous one as the variation in the modulus of elasticity is slowed down...|$|R

On the basis of performed simulations optimal parameters of rotary compression process were determined. Next, experimental tests of forging forming in laboratory conditions were made. For the research needs, a forging aggregate, designed by the Authors, was used.

By the rotary movement and the conveyor elements the product is conveyed to other end of the cooler. The rotation causes a permanent mixing of the product in the chambers and hence a good heat transfer.|$|E

The disc brakes are separate and are ventilated from the inside. They can be serviced or replaced from below, without needing to take out the entire axle. During regular braking, primarily the regenerative brake is used, and the traction motor serves as the generator. The cooperation between disc brakes and regenerative brakes is controlled by a dedicated brake control computer.|$|R

5000|$|The hollow axles, {{made from}} a chrome-molybdenum alloy, carry the massive wheels and the wheel set {{bearings}} at each end.

40|$|In many cases, a {{torsional}} shaft {{may be a}} thick-walled radially inhomogeneous cylindrical object. The <b>hollow</b> <b>shafts</b> made of functionally graded materials (FGMs) {{are such}} kind of compositions which were studied in this paper. Cylindrical FG shafts are composed of ceramic and metallic parts with power function distribution across the radial direction. The ceramic phase is isotropic elastic and the metallic phase was elastic-plastic. In this paper, the volume fraction-based elastic–plastic mixture rule of renowned Tamura–Tomota–Ozawa (TTO) was used to model {{the behavior of the}} composite material. The elasto-plastic torsion problem was modeled and solved analytically. The results were compared with the simulations of ABAQUS and the accuracy of the solutions was evaluated. Depending on the thickness and level of inhomogeneity, different modes of yielding were obtained. The results showed that plastic zone could occur at the inner or outer surfaces or simultaneously at both surfaces; even it may start in-between the thickness. Moreover, the influence of material inhomogeneity and thickness of shaft upon the plastic zone development were studied and discussed.
