5|$|Often {{considered}} a poor {{relation of the}} cep (Boletus edulis), the bay bolete is nevertheless highly regarded as a choice edible mushroom by some authors such as Carluccio. In central Mexico, it is collected from Izta-Popo Zoquiapan National Park and sold in neighbouring markets. It may cause an allergic reaction in some people, and the blue discolouration upon bruising can be offputting, although the staining disappears from white flesh when it is cooked. The flavour is milder than its better-known relative. Younger specimens are best for eating, though more mature ones can be suitable for cutting up and drying. The tendency for the pores to absorb water means that wiping rather than washing is recommended before use in the kitchen. Unlike most boletes, I.badia can be eaten raw (though only young mushrooms should be used). Otherwise it can be fried in butter, or used with meat or fish recipes. Mushrooms can also be frozen, dried, or pickled in cider vinegar, wine, or <b>extra</b> <b>virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil,</b> and later used in sauces or soups.|$|E
25|$|Another {{study from}} Zhejiang University {{examined}} the nutritional value of broccoli after five common cooking techniques; steaming, boiling, microwaving, stir-frying and stir-frying followed by deep frying. The {{study found that}} the two most common methods of home cooking in China, stir-frying and stir-frying combined with deep frying in soybean oil, resulted in a much greater loss of chlorophyll, soluble protein, soluble sugar and vitamin C. The method which affected these values the least was steaming. Stir frying for five minutes and stir frying combined with boiling caused the highest loss of glucosinolates which according to this study are best preserved by steaming. A study performed by the Spanish National Research Counsel stir fried the broccoli for only 3 minutes 30 seconds and found that nutritional value of these broccoli samples varied depending on which cooking oil was used. Comparing these results to an uncooked sample, the study found that phenolics and vitamin C were reduced more than glucosinolates and minerals. Stir-frying with soybean, peanut, safflower or extra virgin olive did not reduce glucosinolates, and broccoli stir-fried with <b>extra</b> <b>virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> or sunflower oil had vitamin C levels similar to uncooked broccoli. These levels were significantly lower with other edible oils.|$|E

Another method is to gently fry Bidni olives after preserving them in brine, and then serve these with seasonal herbs such as parsley or mint.

40|$|Background. <b>Extra</b> <b>virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> are {{valuable}} and healthy products, appreciated by consumers. The {{aim of this}} study was an attempt to detect adulteration of <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> available on the Polish market (derived from Greece, Spain, and Italy) according to European Union Commission Regulation No 1348 / 2013. Material and methods. Ten <b>extra</b> <b>virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> available on the Polish market were analysed for fatty acids composition, and amount and composition of sterols (including erythrodiol and uvaol) using gas chromatography coupled with a mass spectrometry, and values of extinction coefficients (K 232 and K 270). The results were compared with the requirements of European Union Commission Regulation No 1348 / 2013. Results. One of the most efficient methods for detecting <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> adulteration is qualitative and quantitative analysis of sterols. In certain of the analysed <b>extra</b> <b>virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> some abnormal­ities in composition were detected, which may indicate an attempt to falsify the products. One of the methods can detect if <b>extra</b> <b>virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> have been adulterated, and if they were falsified with the addition of <b>olive</b> pomace <b>oil.</b> Conclusions. Our research proves that consumers are sometimes misinformed and some food manufacturers attempt to sell lower quality products as high-quality products. There is a need to constantly monitor the quality of foodstuffs and provide consumers with access to reliable inform­ation on food products...|$|R

40|$|The olive (Olea europaea) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} crops in the Mediterranean region for economic and culinary reasons. Cuticular waxes coat olives and olive leaves and play a significant role in plant physiology and resistance against environmental stresses. The present study describes n-alkane profiles in cuticular waxes of olives and leaves of three Italian varieties (Frantoio, Leccino and Maraiolo) during different stages of olive development. Additionally, the study investigates the differences between n-alkane profiles of <b>extra</b> <b>virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> with low and high leaf content. Olive leaves are characterised by the predominance of n-alkanes with longer carbon chains (n-C 29 -C 33) compared with olives (n-C 25 -C 29). During all stages of olive ripening period, n-alkane average chain length (ACL) values of olive leaves are significantly higher compared with those of <b>olives.</b> <b>Extra</b> <b>virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> with admixture of leaves have significantly different n-alkane profiles than those free from leaf material. Practical applications: The results of this study will contribute significantly to the currently very limited information on n-alkane data from olive tree varieties used for oil production. The presence of leaves increases the concentrations of long chain n-alkanes (n-C 31 -C 35) in <b>extra</b> <b>virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oils,</b> therefore studying the differences between n-alkane profiles of olives and olive leaves could help establishing the presence of leaf material in produced <b>extra</b> <b>virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oils.</b> Information about the relative and absolute concentrations of n-alkanes in olives, olive leaves and <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> will also be useful for biochemical and metabolic studies of the olive tree...|$|R
