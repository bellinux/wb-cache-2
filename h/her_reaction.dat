Throughout the interview, Andersson wore a T-shirt with the text [...] "Treblinka - Class of '45". Andersson didn't seem to react at all on tape.

500|$|Critic Judith Thurman said in The New Yorker that, [...] "Riefenstahl's genius {{has rarely}} been questioned, even by critics who despise the service to which she lent it.

500|$|As for Lady Grange herself, her vituperative outbursts and indulgence {{in alcohol}} were clearly {{important}} factors in her undoing. Alexander Carlyle described her [...] as [...] "stormy and outrageous", whilst noting {{that it was in}} her husband's interests to exaggerate the nature of her violent emotions.

In an attempt to end his relationship with Mrs Lindsay, (who owned a coffee house in Haymarket, Edinburgh), Rachel threatened to expose him as a Jacobite sympathiser. Perhaps she did not understand the magnitude of this accusation and the danger it posed to her husband and his friends, or how ruthless their instincts of self-preservation were likely to be.|$|E

This permanently dimmed Pat Nixon's view of politics.|$|E

I was so shocked but absolutely chuffed to bits {{because this is what}} all actors want – something massive like this to sink my teeth into.

30|$|Consistent {{with the}} literature, the blogger had {{multiple}} motivations for writing while on her sojourn in Zimbabwe.
