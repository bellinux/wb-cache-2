40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} distributed fusion when the conditional independence assumptions on sensor measurements or local estimates are not met. A new data fusion algorithm called Copula fusion is presented. The proposed method is grounded on Copula statistical modeling and Bayesian analysis. The primary advantage of the Copula-based methodology is that it could reveal the unknown correlation that allows one to build joint probability distributions with potentially arbitrary underlying marginals and a desired intermodal dependence. The proposed fusion algorithm requires no a priori <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>communications</b> patterns or network connectivity. The simulation {{results show that the}} Copula fusion brings a consistent estimate {{for a wide range of}} process noises...|$|E

40|$|Databus {{and data}} network {{technology}} {{continues to play}} an ever-increasing role in aviation digital electronics architectures throughout the range of aviation markets. The evolution of integrated modular aviation digital electronics architectures comprising multiple subsystems integrated into single and redundant data networks is increasing the influence of data networking. The criticality of data networks has previously led avionics manufacturers and aircraft original equipment manufacturers to design specific aerospace solutions to meet their requirements. In recent years, cost challenges {{have led to the}} adoption of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) communication solutions in avionics. Although attractive from a cost perspective, the adoption of COTS presents certification issues, particularly as the complexity and increased leverage of technology continues to evolve. Subtleties may escape the system designer and leave dependability holes. An example is the interference of the Controller Area Network bit-error stuffing mechanism with message cyclic redundancy code coverage. COTS can be adopted as is, or with fixes added so it is a better fit for dependable avionics requirements, i. e., the adaptation of Ethernet to Aeronautical Radio, Incorporated (ARINC®) Part 7. Helping this trend is the arrival of “safety-critical COTS” in the marketplace, particularly in automobile and process-control areas. However, even with designed-for-purpose technology, it is necessary to ensure that the technology has dependability consistent with real-world requirements and redundancy management schemes. Development and evaluation of aviation digital electronics data networks that are suitable for safety-critical aviation digital electronics is a complex subject area. It requires detailed <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>communications</b> systems, aviation communication and application requirements, mechanisms for creating dependable architectures, certification expectations, and assurance strategies. It is also important to note that, with correct architectural mitigation, almost any data network may be used in a certified system. For example, a layer of fault tolerance can be placed above the network to fix any of its shortcomings. The objective of this Handbook is to provide criteria for evaluating data network technology for use in safety-critical applications. However, this should not be taken to mean that these criteria can be used to rank data networks in a scale of absolute goodness, independent of the avionics systems in which they are employed. Because the operation of a data network is so entangled with the avionics system it supports, {{it is not possible to}} make an evaluation of a data network on its own. The goal is to create a sufficient breadth of criteria that can be used to evaluate the widest range of data networks with respect to the avionics systems in which they may be employed...|$|E

40|$|Type 2 {{diabetes}} mellitus (T 2 DM) results from pancreatic β-cell {{failure in the}} setting of insulin resistance. In the early stages of this disease, pancreatic β-cells meet increased insulin demand by both enhancing insulin-secretory capacity and increasing β-cell mass. As the disease progresses, β-cells fail to maintain these compensatory responses. This involves both extrinsic signals and mediators intrinsic to β-cells, which adversely affect β-cells by impairing insulin secretion, decreasing proliferative capacities, and ultimately causing apoptosis. In recent years, it has increasingly been recognized that changes in circulating levels of various factors from other organs play roles in β-cell dysfunction and cellular loss. In this review, we discuss current <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> interorgan <b>communications</b> underlying β-cell failure during the progression of T 2 DM...|$|R

Rear-Admiral Henry Oliver had been appointed Director of the Intelligence division in 1913. In August, 1914, his department was fully occupied with the war and no-one had experience of code breaking. Instead he turned to a friend, Sir Alfred Ewing, the Director of Naval Education (DNE), who previously had been a professor of engineering with a <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> radio <b>communications</b> and who he knew had an interest in ciphers. It was not felt that education would be a priority during the expected few months duration of the war, so Ewing was asked to set up a group for decoding messages. Ewing initially turned to staff of the naval colleges Osborne and Dartmouth, who were currently available, due both to the school holidays and to naval students having been sent on active duty. Alastair Denniston had been teaching German but later became second in charge of Room 40, then becoming Chief of its successor after the First World War, the Government Code and Cypher School (located at Bletchley Park during the Second World War).|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a preliminary study and comparison of digital drawings, which are transformed from freehand sketching by using Photoshop. With {{the development of}} new software, digital drawings are used more and more extensively in the design field. However, freehand sketching continues to provide unique and vital capabilities to interior designers and architects in allied fields (Laseau, 2004). In order to balance both freehand sketching and digital drawing to meet the requirements of the current trend, it is necessary to explore a new technique of transformation from freehand sketching to sophisticated digital drawing. The transformed drawings should represent the characters of both freehand sketching and digital drawing; especially it presents certain qualities that hand-drawn drawing can not present. Therefore, a preliminary study on how to transform freehand drawing to digital drawings was undertaken. Most importantly, this preliminary study compares the characteristics of transformed digital drawings with characteristics of freehand sketching in order to make recommendations about conversion from hand-drawn to digital drawings for professional practice and education.
