40|$|<b>Ginseng</b> is the <b>family</b> of Araliaceous {{which has}} been famous and used in China since 3 BC by its various benefits. It is {{believed}} that the more aged the ginseng, the more healing, and the more healthful for the body. In Indonesia, the product of ginseng processed is not well known; {{as a result this}} product is not well socialized. One of the ginseng benefits is, counteract the fatigue, giving stimulant effects and releasing the symptoms of aging. Up to now people traditionally used the ginseng root only, while the Red ginseng fruit which has anthocyanin (antioxidants) and various health benefits has not used by the society specially for people in Kediri. The trial processed the red ginseng fruit after the harvest season is intended to introduce the product ginseng processed from Pukad Red Ginseng which is to improve performance and stamina, and to give diet solutions. It has been done three times production. Organoleptic test subject is the students, the official and the lecturer of University of Nusantara PGRI. The food process of pudding red ginseng is doing by mixing the fruit extract of Red Ginseng to the pudding admixture. The result shows that the third product is the most preferred for the flavor, aroma, color, texture, and the packaging which is match with the consumer taste. The utilization the red ginseng fruit is expected to give the motivation for the students of University Nusantara PGRI to make a culinary entrepreneurship. The product improvement, the packaging as well as the licensing for the Pukad Red Ginseng is very necessary to do. Furthermore, this culinary product is expected to promote the variety culinary especially in Kediri...|$|R

50|$|The family, Araliaceae, {{to which}} the Polyscias genus {{including}} Ming aralia belongs, {{gives rise to a}} multitude of trees or shrubs that contain gum and resin ducts. As a whole, the family contains plants that have leaves of alternate, palmately or pinnately compound or simple, with stipules. The inflorescences are generally umbellate, and often arranges in compound umbels, caouttules, panicles or races. They possess flowers of smaller size than the dioecious which are bisexual or unisexual.This family also includes a multitude of popular house plants, including English ivy, as well as the herb ginseng. Araliaceae is known as the <b>ginseng</b> <b>family,</b> which is where the traits of the Ming Aralia spice and medical herb originate. Plants of this family can be found throughout the Neotropics, for the greater part in mountainous regions and much less in the lowlands.|$|E

40|$|English ivy, {{a member}} of the Araliaceae or <b>Ginseng</b> <b>family,</b> is an {{evergreen}} perennial vine. This plant continues to be a popular ornamental and has been developed into hundreds of varieties. In many natural areas throughout the United States it is known for creating "Ivy Deserts". These areas are often devoid of native herbaceous plants with trees trunks being covered with dense green ivy. When used as a solution for soil erosion, English ivy is a particularly poor choice. It does not form an extensive underground root system as it covers areas to the exclusion of other plants. As a result, surface flow easily undermines the soil on steep slopes. Height: Since English Ivy is a climbing vine; it will grow as tall as its supporting structures allow. Leaves: The commonly found juvenile leaves are palmate with three to five lobes with heart-shaped leaf bases. They grow to 11 cm long and 10 cm wide, dark green in color and have a thick waxy cuticle. Some leaf shape variation is seen, most notably when the plant is flowering...|$|E
40|$|The {{beneficial}} health promoting {{effects of}} ginseng from vitalizing {{the body to}} enhancing long life have been well explored very rapidly {{in the past few}} years. Up till now many ginsenosides have been discovered for their marvelous therapeutic effects. However during past three years, a novel ginseng compound has been discovered, called gintonin, that differs from other ginsenosides {{on the basis of its}} signal transduction and chemical nature. Gintonin has been widely studied for its anti-Alzheimer’s disease activities and other neuropathies. However, its anti-inflammatory activity remained unexplored. In our study we have reported for the first time the anti-inflammatory activity of gintonin on RAW 264. 7 cells. We found that gintonin potently suppresses the nitric oxide production without any cytotoxicity at given doses and also efficiently suppressed the levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Moreover, it mediaes its signal transduction via MAPK and NF-κB pathways and revives the levels of mir- 34 a and mir- 93. These findings are valuable for the anti-inflammatory effects of this new compound with particular reference to microRNA involvement in the <b>ginseng</b> <b>family...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{number of}} studies devoted to the {{scientific}} evaluation of phytotherapy is rapidly increasing since Western patients seem more oriented towards so-called ´alternative medicine´. Bearing such arguments in mind we decided to address attention to Eleutherococcus senticosus, a root of the <b>Ginseng</b> <b>family</b> known {{for thousands of years}} in China as a remedy for psychological distress. Forty-five paid, healthy volunteers (20 males, 25 females) were recruited. Entry criteria were. good health, age 18 - 30 years, student and a Symptoms Rating Test score < 10. At screening evaluation subjects were randomized to receive orally either placebo (PI group) or Eleutherococcus senticosus (Es group) for 30 days, in a double-blind design. Subjects were submitted to a stressful cognitive task, the Stroop Colour-Word test (Stroop CW), both before and after treatment. Stroop CW increased heart rate (HR) and systolic BP in every subject. In females there was a greater response than in males in terms of both systolic and diastolic BP. For both genders, the HR response to Stroop CW was reduced by Es treatment while no changes were found after Pl. In females, systolic BP was also reduced in Es group while it remained unchanged in PI group. This study demonstrated that treatment with Eleutherococcus senticosus is able to reduce cardiovascular responses to stress in healthy young volunteers, while placebo was ineffective. Eleutherococcus senticosus is confirmed to be helpful for stress adaptation. Copyrigh...|$|E
40|$|Panax <b>ginseng</b> (<b>family</b> Araliaceae) which {{contains}} ginsenoside Rb 1 {{as a main}} constituent is traditionally used as a remedy for cancer, inflammation, stress, and ageing. The ginsenoside Rb 1 in orally administered ginseng is metabolized to bioactive compounds by gut microbiota before their absorptions to the blood. However, its metabolizing activities in individuals are significantly different as we previously demonstrated. Here, we selected 5 samples with fecal activity potently metabolizing ginsenoside Rb 1 to compound K (FPG; metabolic activity, 0. 058 ± 0. 029 pmol/min/mg) and 5 samples with fecal activity non-metabolizing ginsenoside Rb 1 to compound K (FNG) {{from a pool of}} 100 subjects investigated in a previous study and analyzed fecal microbiota by 16 S rRNA gene pyrosequencing. Taxonomy-based analysis showed that the population levels of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria in FPG were lower than in FNG, but those of Bacteroidetes and Tenericutes in FPG were higher than in FNG. At the genus level, the population levels of Clostridiales_uc_g, Oscillibacter, Ruminococcus, Holdemania, and Sutterella in FPG were significantly higher than in FNG, but that of Leuconostoc in FPG was lower than in FNG. The population levels of Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium, which potently metabolizes ginsenoside Rb 1 to compound K were dramatically increased in FPG. The gut microbiota compositions of FPG and FNG were segregated on PCO 2 by Principal Coordinate Analysis. Intestinal bacterial metabolism of ginseng, particularly ginsenoside Rb 1, may be dependent on the composition of gut microbiota, such as Ruminococcus spp., Bacteroides spp. and Bifidobacterium spp...|$|E
40|$|English ivy (Hedera helix) is {{a member}} of the <b>ginseng</b> <b>family</b> of plants (Araliaceae). It grows as a vine for up to ten years {{producing}} deeply lobed, alternating, waxy leaves with three to five points. When the plant is mature and ready to bear fruit, the leaves are only slightly lobed, if at all. Leaves are thick, waxy, shiny dark green and have distinct pale colored veins. Mature plants produce umbels (umbrella –shaped clusters) of greenish white flowers in the fall resulting in a deep purple, soft skinned, berry-like fruit in the spring. Each berry may contain up to three seeds that can be widely dispersed by birds. Vine stems begin pale green and slender when growing along the ground and quickly become woody and stout on climbing vines. Stems produce rootlets that give the vine a hairy appearance and produce a sticky substance that allows the vine to cling to vertical surfaces. Vines can produce roots from each node, allowing it to re-establish itself from cut stems and pieces of stems left on the ground. Impacts: English ivy is an invasive vine in the Pacific Northwest. It grows so rapidly that it surrounds and covers many native plants so that sunlight doesn’t reach them and they die. Once the vines create a thick mat across the ground, other plants have little chance to get reestablished. On trees, the vines can cling to the trunk and branches and grow up and over a 90 foot tree. If left uncontrolled, the ivy will make the tree top-heavy, block out sunlight, and gradually branche...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The <b>ginseng</b> <b>family</b> (Araliaceae) {{includes}} {{a number of}} economically important plant species. Previously phylogenetic studies circumscribed three major clades within the core ginseng plant family, yet the internal relationships of each major group have been poorly resolved perhaps due to rapid radiation of these lineages. Recent {{studies have shown that}} phyogenomics based on chloroplast genomes provides a viable way to resolve complex relationships. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We report the complete nucleotide sequences of five Araliaceae chloroplast genomes using next-generation sequencing technology. The five chloroplast genomes are 156, 333 - 156, 459 bp in length including a pair of inverted repeats (25, 551 - 26, 108 bp) separated by the large single-copy (86, 028 - 86, 566 bp) and small single-copy (18, 021 - 19, 117 bp) regions. Each chloroplast genome contains the same 114 unique genes consisting of 30 transfer RNA genes, four ribosomal RNA genes, and 80 protein coding genes. Gene size, content, and order, AT content, and IR/SC boundary structure are similar among all Araliaceae chloroplast genomes. A total of 140 repeats were identified in the five chloroplast genomes with palindromic repeat as the most common type. Phylogenomic analyses using parsimony, likelihood, and Bayesian inference based on the complete chloroplast genomes strongly supported the monophyly of the Asian Palmate group and the Aralia-Panax group. Furthermore, the relationships among the sampled taxa within the Asian Palmate group were well resolved. Twenty-six DNA markers with the percentage of variable sites higher than 5 % were identified, which may be useful for phylogenetic studies of Araliaceae. CONCLUSION: The chloroplast genomes of Araliaceae are highly conserved in all aspects of genome features. The large-scale phylogenomic data based on the complete chloroplast DNA sequences is shown to be effective for the phylogenetic reconstruction of Araliaceae...|$|E
