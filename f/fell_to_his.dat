In December 1148, he {{captured}} Tortosa after a five-month siege again {{with the help of}} French, Anglo-Normans and Genoese crusaders. The next year, Fraga, Lleida and Mequinenza in the confluence of the Segre and Ebro rivers <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> army.|$|E
5|$|A tag team match {{followed}} in the fourth match, with Pat Kenney teaming with Johnny B. Badd to fight The New York Connection (Johnny Swinger and Glenn Gilbertti). Jacqueline was the special guest referee for the bout. Badd won the encounter after he lifted Gilberti up onto his shoulders, spun him around, and <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> back to perform a move known as a TKO. Badd followed by covering Gilberti for the pinfall.|$|E
5|$|Another {{criticism}} from locomotive crews concerned the exposed cab in bad weather, which necessitated {{the installation of}} a tarpaulin sheet over {{the rear of the}} cab and the front of the tender, restricting rearward vision. The 1921 Coal Miners’ strike meant that two class members (Nos.737 and 739) were converted to oil-burning. One of the modified locomotives subsequently caught fire at Salisbury shed, and both were reverted to coal firing {{by the end of the}} year. When the LSWR was amalgamated into the Southern Railway in 1923, Urie had done little to remedy the shortcomings of the N15s, and it <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> successor to improve the class.|$|E

5|$|Discovery left Isle of Wight on 6 August 1901, {{and arrived}} in New Zealand via Cape Town on 29 November after a detour below 40°S for a {{magnetic}} survey. Quail Island in Lyttelton Harbour {{was used as}} the quarantine station for the expedition's dogs. After three weeks of final preparation she was ready for the journey south. On 21 December, as the ship was leaving Lyttelton to the cheers of large crowds, a young able seaman, Charles Bonner, <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> death {{from the top of the}} mainmast, which he had climbed so as to return the crowd's applause. He was buried at Port Chalmers, two days later.|$|E
5|$|In his 1931 study, Mavrodinov {{also writes}} {{that at the}} time, the church lacked a roof. He {{references}} {{a story about a}} group of Circassians that were settled in Sapareva Banya on the order of the Ottoman authorities after the Crimean War (1853–1856). According to that story, the Circassians sought to pull down the church's roof. However, one of them <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> death inside the church, so they fled in horror. The church was thoroughly reconstructed in 1937 by a team under architect Rashenov.|$|E
5|$|The plot of Night of January 16th {{centers on}} the trial of {{secretary}} Karen Andre {{for the murder of}} her employer, business executive Bjorn Faulkner, who defrauded his company {{of millions of dollars to}} invest in the gold trade. In the wake of a financial crash, he was facing bankruptcy. The play's events occur entirely in a courtroom; Faulkner is never seen. On the night of January 16, Faulkner and Andre were in the penthouse of the Faulkner Building in New York City, when Faulkner apparently <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> death. Within the three acts, the prosecutor Mr. Flint and Andre's defense attorney Mr. Stevens call witnesses whose testimonies build conflicting stories.|$|E

5|$|With {{approximately}} {{two minutes of}} normal time left, the referee's whistle blew for an infringement. Stein however appeared {{to think that the}} final whistle had been blown, as he rose from his seat and began to make his way towards the Welsh bench to shake hands with England. However, as he got up, he then <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> knees before collapsing to the ground. He was immediately carried to the stadium's medical room where attempts were made to resuscitate him.|$|E
5|$|Burns and {{his wife}} had been friends with Schuyler before {{production}} of the film. According to Glut, Schuyler had recently purchased a new sports jacket and did not want it to get soiled or damaged during production. During the fight scene, in order to avoid stepping on and damaging it, Schuyler would remove the jacket and carry it over his shoulder. When the time came for the film's climax, where the Sun Demon <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> death off a cliff, neither Burns nor Glut wanted to do the stunt, and neither wanted to damage the mask by putting it on a dummy. So Burns modified a G.I. Joe action figure so that it resembled the Sun Demon, and Glut then shot the figure in slow motion tumbling down a hole that resembled a valley. The original film's soundtrack was later added to the remake during post-production, with Glut's friend Bart Andrews supplying the Sun Demon's voice.|$|E
5|$|In {{the lead}} up to the Battle of Normandy and the D-Day {{landings}} Johnson continued to score regularly. His 22—23rd victories were achieved on 25 April 1944 and Johnson became the highest scoring ace still on operations. These victories were followed by another Fw 190 on the 5 May (no. 24); III./JG 26 lost Feldwebel Horst Schwentick and Unteroffizier Manfred Talkenberg killed during the air battle. After the landings in France on 6 June 1944, Johnson added further to his tally, claiming another five aerial victories that month including two Bf 109s on 28 June. The mission in which Johnson recorded his 26th victory on 22 June was particularly eventful; four more Fw 190s <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> wing. After bouncing a formation of Bf 109s and Fw 190s, he shot down a Bf 109 for his 29th victory. Five days later, Johnson destroyed two Fw 190s to reach his 30—31st air victories.|$|E

5|$|Nikephoros' scheme had backfired dramatically: {{instead of}} peace, {{a new and}} {{formidable}} foe {{had appeared in the}} Balkans, and {{a large part of the}} Bulgarian nobility appeared to side with the Rus' prince. The emperor, however, was murdered in December 969, and it <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> successor, John I Tzimiskes (r. 969–976), to deal with the Rus' threat. Sviatoslav now turned his sights on Byzantium, and to John's entreaties for peace he allegedly answered that the Empire should abandon its European territories to him and withdraw to Asia Minor. Tzimiskes himself was preoccupied with consolidating his position and with countering the unrest of the powerful Phokas clan and its adherents, and delegated the war in the Balkans to his brother-in-law, the Domestic of the Schools Bardas Skleros, and to the eunuch stratopedarches Peter. They were to winter in Thrace and raise an army, whilst sending spies to discover Sviatoslav's intentions.|$|E
5|$|The Peace of Philocrates {{eventually}} {{broke down}} as hostilities reignited between Athens and Macedonia. Demosthenes, an Athenian statesman who was partially responsible for engineering the peace treaty, delivered {{a series of}} speeches encouraging his fellow Athenians to oppose Philip II. The Macedonian hegemony over Greece was secured by their victory over a Greek coalition army led by Athens and Thebes, at the Battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC. In the aftermath the federation of Greek states known as the League of Corinth was established, which brought these former Greek adversaries and others into a formal alliance with Macedonia. The League of Corinth elected Philip as strategos (i.e. commander-in-chief) for a planned invasion of the Achaemenid Empire of Persia. However, Philip was assassinated before he could begin the campaign, a task that instead <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> son and successor, Alexander the Great.|$|E
5|$|The {{religion}} {{was born in}} Iran, where it has faced ongoing persecution since its inception. It grew from the mid-19th century Bábí religion, whose founder taught that God would soon send a prophet {{in the manner of}} Jesus or Muhammad. In 1863, after being banished from his native Iran, Bahá'u'lláh announced that he was this prophet. He was further exiled, spending over a decade in the prison city of Akka in the Ottoman province of Syria, in what is now Israel. Following Bahá'u'lláh's death in 1892, leadership of the religion <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> son `Abdu'l-Bahá (1844-1921), and later his great-grandson Shoghi Effendi (1897-1957). Bahá'ís around the world annually elect local, regional, and national Spiritual Assemblies that govern the affairs of the religion, and every five years the members of all National Spiritual Assemblies elect the Universal House of Justice, the nine-member supreme governing institution of the worldwide Bahá'í community, which sits in Haifa, Israel near the shrine of Báb.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} day, as Australia faced a large deficit on {{the first}} innings, Bert Oldfield played a long innings in support of Bill Ponsford, who scored 85. In {{the course of the}} innings, the English bowlers used bodyline against him, and he faced several short-pitched deliveries but took several fours from Larwood to move to 41. Having just conceded a four, Larwood bowled fractionally shorter and slightly slower. Oldfield attempted to hook but lost sight of the ball and edged it onto his temple; the ball fractured his skull. Oldfield staggered away and <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> knees and play stopped as Woodfull came onto the pitch and the angry crowd jeered and shouted, once more reaching the point where a riot seemed likely. Several English players thought about arming themselves with stumps should the crowd come onto the field. The ball which injured Oldfield was bowled to a conventional, non-bodyline field; Larwood immediately apologised but Oldfield said that it was his own fault before he was helped back to the dressing room and play continued. Jardine later secretly sent a telegram of sympathy to Oldfield's wife and arranged for presents to be given to his young daughters.|$|E
