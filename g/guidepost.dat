25|$|Proposals {{that may}} lead to a quantum theory of gravity such as string theory and loop quantum gravity predict {{violations}} of the weak equivalence principle because they contain many light scalar fields with long Compton wavelengths, which should generate fifth forces and variation of the fundamental constants. Heuristic arguments suggest that the magnitude of these equivalence principle violations could be in the 10−13 to 10−18 range. Currently envisioned tests of the weak equivalence principle are approaching a degree of sensitivity such that non-discovery of a violation would be just as profound a result as discovery of a violation. Non-discovery of equivalence principle violation in this range would suggest that gravity is so fundamentally different from other forces as to require a major reevaluation of current attempts to unify gravity with the other forces of nature. A positive detection, on the other hand, would provide a major <b>guidepost</b> towards unification.|$|E

Devils Tower is a Wyoming landmark, a [...] high tower of rock, visible for nearly [...] It has been a <b>guidepost</b> and a {{religious}} site. In December of that year, three more National Monuments were created. El Morro, New Mexico, is a wayside in the rugged desert lands used by Indians settlers and travelers for centuries as a watering hole {{and a place to}} leave their marks. The site includes prehistoric petroglyphs and hundreds of inscriptions from 17th century Spanish explorers and 19th century American emigrants and settlers. Montezuma Castle, Arizona, {{is one of the best}} preserved cliff dwellings. Petrified Forest, Arizona, is world-renowned for its petrified wood, Indian ruins and petroglyphs. Three of these original National Monuments later became the core of National Parks. Mukuntuweap became Zion, Sieur de Monts grew into Acadia, and Petrified Forest which was expanded by Congress to become a National Park of the same name. Three of the smaller areas were later abolished, those being Lewis and Clark Caverns, Shoshone Cavern, and Papago Saguaro.|$|E
2500|$|The park's namesake was {{a mysterious}} stone which {{according}} to the region's earliest pioneers was revered by Native Americans. [...] William Walton discovered the stone at what is now Monterey (appx. [...] southeast of the park) in the late 1780s while building the Walton Road. [...] The stone originally stood around [...] tall and was shaped like a dog sitting on its hind legs. [...] The purpose of the stone, if any, remains unknown. [...] Some accounts claim that the stone marked {{the boundary between the}} territories of the Cherokee and Shawnee, or other Native American tribes. [...] Others say it was a <b>guidepost</b> used by Cherokee hunting parties. [...] Whatever its original purpose, the stone was a well-known landmark for migrants travelling between East and Middle Tennessee in the early 19th century. [...] A community known as [...] "Standing Stone" [...] (later renamed Monterey) developed along the Walton Road in the stone's vicinity. [...] The Standing Stone was dynamited in 1893 to make way for railroad construction. [...] Shortly after it was destroyed, a local society known as the Improved Order of the Redmen retrieved and preserved several pieces of the stone. [...] In 1895, the order placed one of these pieces (which they had engraved) atop a monument at Monterey City Park, where it remains today.|$|E
2500|$|Lockyer (1909) and Thom (1967) {{suggested}} that the King Stone had been an astronomical marker that may {{at the same time}} have had a relation to the ceremonies being undertaken at the King's Men. Lambrick dismissed any astronomical significance as unlikely, because the Stone only aligns with the rising of the star Capella as it would have appeared circa 1750 BCE, and {{there is no evidence that}} late prehistoric Britons saw any relevance with this or any other stars, instead building several of their monuments to have solar or lunar alignments. A second idea, posited by megalithic specialist Aubrey Burl (1976), {{suggested that}} the King Stone had been a landmark or <b>guidepost</b> designed to mark out the position of the King's Men. Again, Lambrick disagreed with this, remarking that its [...] "position and orientation make it too inconspicuous to be satisfactory as a marker for anyone approaching the circle either along the ridge or from the alleys either side." [...] It had also been suggested, by both early antiquarian John Aubrey and the archaeologist Arthur Evans, that the monolith was a surviving remnant of a stone avenue that had once led to the King's Men, but Lambrick once more believed that this was unlikely, noting that there was no other archaeological evidence for such an avenue, and that it would have been poorly aligned with the circle.|$|E

Excessive speed {{is one of the main}} problems to overcome. The aim of this study was to test the effectiveness of traffic-calming measures in reducing drivers' speed along a road with a dangerous bend in an inland area near Venice, Italy. The driving simulator of the Transportation Laboratory of the University of Padua and the simulated scenario were validated by reproducing the study site environment. A driving simulator experiment was conducted to analyze changes in speed profiles associated with various countermeasures: evenly spaced <b>guideposts,</b> tall <b>guideposts,</b> narrowing <b>guideposts,</b> and dragon's teeth markings. Tall and narrowing <b>guideposts</b> served to reduce drivers' speed by up to 2. 7 km/h. Unlike tall <b>guideposts,</b> which produced no detrimental effect on drivers' behavior, narrowing <b>guideposts</b> led drivers to occupy more variable positions within the lane. In view of this at-risk behavior, the convenience of the option to produce an apparent narrowing of the lane on real roads was discussed. This study found that the use of driving simulators was a reliable research tool to reproduce drivers' real behavior. The study also provided effective, low-cost measures to counteract excessive speed on dangerous road sections...|$|R

6000|$|Accordingly--for {{it must be}} {{understood}} that our pilgrimage was to be performed on foot--we sallied joyously out of the wagon, each of us, even the old gentleman in his white-top boots, giving a great skip as we came down the ladder. Above our heads {{there was such a}} glory of sunshine and splendor of clouds, and such brightness of verdure below, that, as I modestly remarked at the time, Nature seemed to have washed her face, and put on the best of her jewelry and a fresh green gown, in honor of our confederation. Casting our eyes northward, we beheld a horseman approaching leisurely, and splashing through the little puddles on the Stamford road. Onward he came, sticking up in his saddle with rigid perpendicularity, a tall, thin figure in rusty black, whom the showman and the conjurer shortly recognized to be, what his aspect sufficiently indicated, a travelling preacher of great fame among the Methodists. What puzzled us was the fact, that his face appeared turned from, instead of to, the camp-meeting at Stamford.

On a level spot of grass, {{at the foot of the}} <b>guidepost,</b> appeared an object, which, though locomotive on a different principle, reminded me of Gulliver's portable mansion among the Brobdignags. It was a huge covered wagon, or, more properly, a small house on wheels, with a door on one side and a window shaded by green blinds on the other. Two horses, munching provender out of the baskets which muzzled them, were fastened near the vehicle: a delectable sound of music proceeded from the interior; and I immediately conjectured that this was some itinerant show, halting at the confluence of the roads to intercept such idle travellers as myself. A shower had long been climbing up the western sky, and now hung so blackly over my onward path that it was a point of wisdom to seek shelter here.|$|E

In addition, pioneer axons can act as <b>guidepost</b> cells to more distant pioneer neurons. Studies that involved selective destruction of <b>guidepost</b> cells resulted in pioneer axons becoming unable to navigate normally to the CNS from the PNS. Instead, the pioneer axons assumed alternate configurations and followed different trajectories. In addition, without the <b>guidepost</b> cells, the pioneer axons did not find the stereotyped route that pioneer axons would normally navigate.|$|E

Ti1 pioneer neurons is a common example neurons that require <b>guidepost</b> cells to reach its final destination.
