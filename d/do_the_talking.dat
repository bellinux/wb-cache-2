25|$|At a {{time when}} most fighters let their {{managers}} <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>talking,</b> Ali thrived in and indeed craved the spotlight, where he was often provocative and outlandish. He was known for trash talking, and often freestyled with rhyme schemes and spoken word poetry, both for his trash talking in boxing and as political poetry for his activism, anticipating elements of rap and hip hop music. As a musician, Ali recorded two spoken word albums and a rhythm and blues song, and received two Grammy Award nominations. As an actor, he performed in several films and a Broadway musical. Additionally, Ali wrote two autobiographies, one during and one after his boxing career.|$|E
500|$|... "The Silence" [...] {{is a song}} by British singer Alexandra Burke {{from her}} debut studio album Overcome (2009). The song was written by Bilal Hajji and Savan Kotecha, along with the song's {{producer}} Nadir [...] "RedOne" [...] Khayat. The song was released as a promotional single {{in anticipation of the}} re-release of Overcome (2010). Burke stated that the song was written when her aunt told the singer about how she and her partner were experiencing troubles in their relationship, and that they were not telling each other how they felt. In response, Burke asked her aunt why he was letting the silence in their relationship <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>talking</b> instead of them discussing it. [...] "The Silence" [...] is an R and pop-influenced power ballad and instrumentation consists of a piano, a guitar and drums. The lyrics of the song feature the protagonist asking why the other person in the relationship remains silent about their difficulties instead of talking about them.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} of Blue Gardenia was positive overall. Jonathan Widran wrote a positive review for the album, complimenting Walton's arrangements and the featured soloists. Widran {{also said that}} each track allowed James to [...] "explore both tenderness and guttural emotions" [...] and that James' mother's contributions to the title track provided a [...] "unique touch that [...] emotional dimension to an already emotionally rich affair". Music critic Robert Christgau awarded the album an [...] "A–" [...] rating and wrote that James [...] " [...] the songs <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>talking</b> and [...] you to wonder whether her modest melodic variations bespeak sly musicality or weathered pipes." [...] Isaac Guzman of the New York Daily News thought that the album showcased James' ability to [...] "get inside the gentle nuances of classic torch songs and ballads". Dorothy Hill noted the blues sound of the album and the [...] "ache" [...] in James' voice. She complimented the performances by the guest musicians appearing on the album, including Hawkins, whose vocal contribution Hill called [...] "unpolished but alluring".|$|E

500|$|On 1 September 1965 Atrash was {{appointed}} Chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council (RCC), but acquired little de facto power {{because of the}} Military Committee's overarching control, with Atrash later remarking [...] "the officers let us <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>talking</b> although, as we later discovered, they had agreed beforehand... what the decisions would be." [...] The RCC {{played the role of}} parliament and Atrash was its speaker. In December tensions between the National Command (loyal to Aflaq and Bitar) and the Regional Command (loyal to Jadid and backed by the military) grew worse as elements of the former attempted to align with Military Committee member Muhammad Umran in an effort to split the military's support (and according to Syria expert Itamar Rabinovich, the Alawite officers' solid backing) of Jadid. However, Atrash, along with Munif al-Razzaz of Jordan and Jubran al-Majdalani and Ali al-Khalil of Lebanon, {{was a part of the}} group in the National Command that opposed confrontation with the Regional Command, citing the National Command's lack of military support and political power as well as the fundamental weakness of an alliance with Umran and Amin al-Hafiz. The latter two had been engaged in an antagonistic rivalry over leadership of the Military Committee.|$|E
500|$|When the single's {{cover was}} revealed, it divided opinions. Becky Bain of Idolator liked [...] "simplicity {{of the black}} and white cover," [...] though she felt it strange that the image [...] "didn't have color or glasses." [...] Rap-Up {{magazine}} thought the opposite to Bain, saying that [...] "Rowland's eyes <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>talking</b> with the black-and-white artwork." [...] On June 28, 2010, the single was released as a digital download in Belgium, Norway, and Sweden. A day later, it was sent to American pop and rhythmic radio, as well as released for digital download. On July 23, 2010, it was also released in other parts of Europe, including Italy and the Netherlands. Media Base's seven-day airplay report showed that in the last week of August, [...] "Rose Colored Glasses" [...] managed to peak at number thirty-nine on the US Top 40 Airplay chart, a component of the Mainstream Top 40 chart published by Billboard. However, by the week ending September 11, 2010, it had received no adds to official playlists, despite being played 585times across thirty-four stations. The only other territory where the song charted was Slovakia. It debuted on the Slovakian Airplay Chart at number sixty-eight before peaking at number twenty-five three weeks later.|$|E
500|$|... "The Silence" [...] {{is a power}} ballad, which {{lasts for}} a {{duration}} of three minutes and 35 seconds. It draws influence from the music genre of R and pop, while instrumentation consists of a piano, a guitar and drums. The song is written in the key of A minor and is set in simple time with a metronome of 76 beats per minute. Burke's vocal range in the song spans from the low note of F3 to the high note of F5. In an interview with Peter Andre on The Paul O'Grady Show on 3 November 2009, Burke explained {{the meaning of the}} songs lyrics, saying [...] "I'm sure everyone has been in that situation where you are in a relationship, it might not be going so well and you kinda want your other half to speak out and say what is on their mind, and I've had relationships like that." [...] Burke continued to explain that {{when she was in the}} recording studio with RedOne, her Aunt was experiencing problems in her relationship which related to the lyrics in [...] "The Silence," [...] and that she felt that her Aunt's partner should not [...] "let the silence <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>talking?</b> Why doesn't he let you know how he feels?," [...] and that [...] "The Silence" [...] was written as a result. The songs begins with the lyrics [...] "Oh, you lift me up." ...|$|E

The first time the band played live some songs from the album for a big audience was on Rock Im Park festival in Nuremberg, Germany, playing six new songs. Manager Dave Holmes said that the reason to play new songs on the festivals was to [...] "invite people to the party" [...] also on this he said: [...] "...let the music <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>talking,</b> play new songs and get people talking about the fact you're playing new music." ...|$|E

2500|$|Grande has a four octave soprano vocal range, and {{the whistle}} register. With {{the release of}} Yours Truly, Grande was deemed the [...] "mini Mariah Carey" [...] and the [...] "new Mariah Carey" [...] by some critics because of her wide vocal range, sound and musical material. Speaking about the comparisons, Julianne Escobedo Shepherd of Billboard wrote that both Carey and Grande have [...] "the talent to let their vocals <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>talking</b> ... that's not where the {{similarities}} end. ... Grande is subverting it with cute, comfortable, and on-trend dresses with a feminine slant." [...] Grande responded to the comparisons, [...] "t's a huge compliment, but when you hear my entire album, you'll see that Mariah's sound is much different than mine." [...] Steven J.

2500|$|The Melbourne Herald Sun wrote: ‘The Don is a {{sterling}} biography... {{it gives}} a riveting account of many of Bradman’s innings, and one can almost feel the excitement that gripped cricket fans when he strode out to bat.’ Australian Cricket Magazine’s Ken Piesse found the book was ‘a riveting and engrossing account of {{the life and times}} of cricket’s mega hero... In a 645-page book, Bradmanlike in research and presentation, Perry provides far more biographical and character detail on The Don and his life than previously published.’ The Sydney Sunday Telegraph’s Peter Lalor said: ‘Perry keeps a compelling pace in the work... The Don always let his cricket <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>talking</b> and so does the author. Perry brings to life the various innings with colourful and detailed descriptions of the shots, bowling and fielding... a good read and a handy bench-mark for all the modern hysteria [...] about Brian Lara and Steve Waugh, two fine players whose averages and performances are but a shadow of The Don’s.’ ...|$|E
2500|$|In a post-modern {{thesis on}} the superhero genre Michael Lecker wrote, [...] "In the superhero genre, clothes <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>talking</b> through semiotics, which [...] Barthes {{discusses}} in depth in his work: The 'first, literal message {{serves as a}} support for a second meaning, of a generally affective or ideological order' (Roland Barthes). The cat suits that adorn the feline hybrid characters in this genre are firstly illustrating their connection to felines. On the ideological level, the costumes signify the attributes that our society has projected onto cats and that the characters embody." [...] In another post-modern thesis on sadomasochism in cinema Andrea Beckmann wrote, [...] "Cinematic SM is twisted into the non-consenting, violent realm of the unhinged that {{we know it is}} not. Fetishism is used as an excuse for a bit of titillatory semi-nudity, or to identify the villain – the man in black leather. Horror films, in particular, will happily throw in a leather catsuit or a gratuitous bondage scene to spice up a mediocre script (M Olley, Pam Hogg: Warrior queen of the catwalk)." ...|$|E
