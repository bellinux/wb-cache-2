One finch sang a record 1,278 susk-e-weits <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>hour,</b> and the owner was later accused of doping the bird with testosterone. After one contestant sang exactly {{the same number of}} calls in two rounds, the box was opened and a mini CD player was discovered within.|$|E

He {{continually}} confronts the Captain and the guards, and {{his sense of humor}} and independence prove to be both contagious and inspiring to the other prisoners. Luke's struggle for supremacy peaks when he leads a work crew in a seemingly impossible but successful effort to complete a road-paving job in less than one day. The other prisoners start to idolize him after he makes and wins a spur-of-the moment bet that he can eat fifty hard-boiled eggs <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>hour.</b>|$|E

5|$|Merv Harvey {{broke into}} the Victorian state team during the 1940–41 season and played in three {{first-class}} matches. The highlight of {{the first phase of}} his career for Victoria was a rapid 70 <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>hour</b> against a New South Wales attack containing Bill O'Reilly, regarded as the best bowler in the world at the time. However, the outbreak of World War II in the Pacific caused the suspension of top-level cricket and halted Harvey’s progress. Harvey then served in the Royal Australian Air Force as an airframe fitter, losing his best cricketing years to the war.|$|E
5|$|After a drawn first Test {{the second}} match {{was a game}} of two halves. England {{developed}} a 233 run lead at the half way stage and had the West Indies on 204/5 when Butcher was caught. This dismissal caused a riot and from this point onwards England struggled with the spin bowling of Sobers and Gibbs, narrowly avoiding defeat by two wickets. The third Test saw another drawn match due to the slow batting of the West Indies, taking over two days to score 349 runs which included a spell of four runs <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>hour.</b> England took a 1–0 lead after the fourth Test, {{in a game that}} they seemed least like winning. The win was mainly due to Sobers' decision to declare on 92/2 in the West Indies second innings. Good batting by Alan Knott and a 127 sixth wicket partnership ensured the final game ended in a draw as England maintained their 1–0 lead to win the series.|$|E
5|$|At about 9:20am on Saturday 15 June 1996, the Ford van {{was parked}} on Corporation Street, outside the Marks & Spencer store, near the Arndale Centre. After setting the bomb's timer, two men – wearing hooded jackets, {{baseball}} caps and sunglasses – left {{the vehicle and}} walked to Cathedral Street, where a third man picked {{them up in the}} Ford Granada. The truck had been parked on double yellow lines with its hazard lights flashing. Within three minutes a traffic warden had issued the vehicle with a parking ticket and called for its removal. At about 9:40am, Granada Studios on Quay Street received a telephone call claiming that there was a bomb at the corner of Corporation Street and Cannon Street and that it would explode <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>hour.</b> The caller had an Irish accent and gave an IRA codeword so that police would know the threat was genuine. Four other telephoned warnings were sent to television/radio stations, newspapers and a hospital.|$|E

5|$|Early in {{the race}} John Downie crashed into a pub in Ballasalla, but the car did not sustain {{extensive}} damage {{and he was able}} to continue the race. At Keppel Gate on the Mountain Road, Frederick Bennett, who had been unable to take part in the practice sessions and therefore did not know the course very well, approached a corner with too much speed in his Cadillac and crashed, ripping off two of the wheels. Bennett managed to stay in the vehicle and avoided serious injury. Another driver to go off the track was J. Hadley in his Wolseley, who also carried too much speed into a corner, leading him to drive off through a hedge and into a field. The Thornycroft driven by Tom Thornycroft had been following closely behind, and the two cars collided during the incident, damaging one of the Thornycroft's rear wheels. Napier in his Arrol-Johnston made the quickest circuit of the first lap <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>hour,</b> 32 minutes and 36 seconds.|$|E
5|$|The X Corps attack {{involved}} a strike {{on the left}} flank by the 213th Infantry Regiment and 7th Tank Battalion, and on the right flank by the 205th Infantry Regiment and 4th Tank Battalion. The right flanking force arrived late, so the 213th Infantry and the 7th Tank Battalion advanced alone on the north axis. It was thought that the 213th could reach an area in between Chéhéry and Bulson <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>hour</b> fifty minutes and the 7th Tank Battalion in two hours. Yet {{it was not until}} 17 hours after the original order to advance to Bulson that the lead French tanks reached the Bulson ridge. They found the Germans had beaten them there by a few minutes.|$|E
5|$|The {{skin of a}} teleost {{is largely}} {{impermeable}} to water, and the main interface between the fish's body and its surroundings is the gills. In freshwater, teleost fish gain water across their gills by osmosis, while in seawater they lose it. Similarly, salts diffuse outwards across the gills in freshwater and inwards in salt water. The European flounder spends most of its life in the sea but often migrates into estuaries and rivers. In the sea <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>hour,</b> it can gain Na+ ions equivalent to forty percent of its total free sodium content, with 75 percent of this entering through the gills and the remainder through drinking. By contrast, in rivers there is an exchange of just {{two percent of the}} body Na+ content per hour. As well as being able to selectively limit salt and water exchanged by diffusion, there is an active mechanism across the gills for the elimination of salt in sea water and its uptake in fresh water.|$|E

5|$|The storm dropped heavy {{rainfall}} while crossing the Lesser Antilles. In Martinique, the highest 24‑hour total was 26.8inches (680mm) in Fourniols, which was twice the average rainfall for August. Additionally, {{the capital city}} of Fort-de-France reported 13.4in (341mm). There, the rainfall broke all records for durations up to 24hours; about 1inch (26mm) fell in 5minutes, and <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>hour</b> a station reported 6.02inches (153mm). The rainfall caused flooding and mudslides, as well as rivers exceeding their banks; several bridges collapsed during the storm, and many homes were washed away. During the passage of the storm, sustained winds on the island reached 67mph (108km/h), with gusts reaching 99mph (160km/h) in the Caravelle peninsula. Throughout the country, the storm destroyed 186homes and left 700people homeless. The passage of Dorothy left heavy crop damage on the island, totaling 32millionfrancs (1970FRF, $5.8million 1970USD); a total of 3.75mi² (9.72km²) of banana crop was destroyed, and 2.16mi² (5.6km²) of sugar cane was destroyed. Damage on the island totaled 190millionfrancs (1970FRF, $34million 1970USD).|$|E
5|$|Hall {{slowed the}} leading pack {{down so that}} her {{teammate}} Helen Jenkins could catch-up. The lead pack joined with the peleton {{at the end of}} the second cycling lap to form a 22-women strong group. Despite the chase group chasing hard, all 22 athletes finished the cycling leg in the same pack without any additions. There was a time difference of one minute and 44 seconds between the 22nd and 23rd athletes after the bike leg. The quickest individual bike split was shared between two New Zealanders, Andrea Hewitt and Kate McIlroy, who both completed the bike leg <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>hour,</b> five minutes and 26 seconds. Due to overnight rain the roads were wet and multiple athletes crashed on the bike leg. Two athletes in Kathy Tremblay (Canada) and Emma Moffatt had to withdraw from the race due to crashing. Moffatt, one of the pre-race favourites crashed on the first lap of the cycling leg. At the second transition (cycling to running) Anne Haug (Germany), who was in the second group, was the quickest through the transition in a time of 27 seconds. Of the leading group most went through in around 30 seconds.|$|E

25|$|Squash {{provides}} an excellent cardiovascular workout. <b>In</b> <b>one</b> <b>hour</b> of squash, a player may expend approximately 600 to 1000 food calories (3,000 to 4,000 kJ). The sport also provides a good upper and lower body workout by exercising both the legs in running around the court and the arms and torso in swinging the racket. In 2003, Forbes rated squash as the number one healthiest sport to play. However, some studies have implicated squash {{as a cause of}} possible fatal cardiac arrhythmia and argued that squash is an inappropriate form of exercise for older men with heart disease.|$|E
25|$|Burou’s first vaginoplasty, in 1956, {{took him}} {{three hours to}} complete, however {{at the height of}} his sex-reassignment work by 1974, {{performing}} up to six vaginoplasties a month, he could complete the procedure <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>hour.</b> The post-op patient’s arms were strapped to the bed for the first night after the procedure. The drain was removed 48 hours after surgery, the catheter four days, and the stent eight. The new vagina was managed by frequent or daily insertion of fingers or retractors, and the new urethra was kept open by the daily introduction of the catheter, ensuring against neomeatal stenosis. Most patients spent two weeks in the clinic.|$|E

25|$|This {{approximation}} {{is sometimes}} {{known as the}} law of rare events, since each of the n individual Bernoulli events rarely occurs.

25|$|Federer {{began his}} 2012 grass court {{season at the}} Halle Open in Halle, {{where he was a}} five-time {{champion}} and was the second seed. He received a bye in the first round, and defeated Florian Mayer in the second round, firing 11 aces to kick-start his grass court season with a straight sets win. Federer then played Canadian Milos Raonic in the quarterfinals, and, after losing a first set tiebreak, won in a third set tiebreak to secure three consecutive wins against Raonic. In the semifinals, he cruised past Mikhail Youzhny, dropping only five games en route to a win <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>hour.</b> However, Federer succumbed in the final to an inspired Tommy Haas in straight sets due to untimely errors.|$|E
