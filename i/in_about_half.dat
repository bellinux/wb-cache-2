5|$|Hydrocephalus (obstruction of {{the flow}} of {{cerebrospinal}} fluid) may complicate SAH in both the short and long term. It is detected on CT scanning, on which there is enlargement of the lateral ventricles. If the level of consciousness is decreased, drainage of the excess fluid is performed by therapeutic lumbar puncture, extraventricular drain (a temporary device inserted into one of the ventricles), or occasionally a permanent shunt. Relief of hydrocephalus can lead to an enormous improvement in a person's condition. Fluctuations in blood pressure and electrolyte imbalance, as well as pneumonia and cardiac decompensation occur <b>in</b> <b>about</b> <b>half</b> the hospitalized persons with SAH and may worsen prognosis. Seizures occur during the hospital stay in about a third of cases.|$|E
5|$|Hypertrophic {{cardiomyopathy}} (HCM) is {{a common}} condition (prevalence >1:500) characterized by abnormal thickening of the ventricular muscle, classically in the intraventricular septal wall. HCM {{is described as a}} disease of the sarcomere, because mutations in the contractile proteins of the sarcomere have been identified <b>in</b> <b>about</b> <b>half</b> of patients with HCM. The cTnC mutations that have been associated with HCM are A8V, L29Q, A31S, C84Y, D145E. In all cases, the mutation was identified in a single patient, so additional genetic testing is needed to confirm or refute the clinical significance of these mutations. With most of these mutations (and with HCM-associated thin filament mutations in general), an increase in cardiac calcium sensitivity has been observed.|$|E

5|$|The {{mainstay}} {{treatment of}} epilepsy is anticonvulsant medications, possibly for the person's entire life. The choice of anticonvulsant {{is based on}} seizure type, epilepsy syndrome, other medications used, other health problems, and the person's age and lifestyle. A single medication is recommended initially; {{if this is not}} effective, switching to a single other medication is recommended. Two medications at once is recommended only if a single medication does not work. <b>In</b> <b>about</b> <b>half,</b> the first agent is effective; a second single agent helps in about 13% and a third or two agents at the same time may help an additional 4%. About 30% of people continue to have seizures despite anticonvulsant treatment.|$|E
5|$|The {{numbers of}} women with SCI giving birth and having healthy babies are increasing. Around a half to two-thirds of women with SCI report {{they might want to}} have children, and 14–20% do get {{pregnant}} at least once. Although female fertility is not usually permanently reduced by SCI, there is a stress response that can happen immediately post-injury that alters levels of fertility-related hormones in the body. <b>In</b> <b>about</b> <b>half</b> of women, menstruation stops after the injury but then returns within an average of five months—it returns within a year for a large majority. After menstruation returns, women with SCI become pregnant at a rate close to that {{of the rest of the}} population.|$|E
5|$|The typical {{symptoms}} of a cold include a cough, a runny nose, nasal congestion and a sore throat, sometimes accompanied by muscle ache, fatigue, headache, and loss of appetite. A sore throat is present in about 40% of cases and a cough in about 50%, while muscle ache occurs <b>in</b> <b>about</b> <b>half.</b> In adults, a fever is generally not present but it is common in infants and young children. The cough is usually mild compared to that accompanying influenza. While a cough and a fever indicate a higher likelihood of influenza in adults, {{a great deal of}} similarity exists between these two conditions. A number of the viruses that cause the common cold may also result in asymptomatic infections.|$|E

5|$|Tillman as {{governor}} initially took a strong stand against lynching. The Shell Manifesto, in reciting {{the ills of}} Conservative government, had blamed the Bourbons for encouraging lynching through bad laws and poor administration. Although Governor Richardson, Tillman's predecessor, had taken action to prevent such murders, they still occurred, with no one being prosecuted for them. <b>In</b> <b>about</b> <b>half</b> of the lynchings in South Carolina between 1881 and 1895, there were claims that the black victim had raped or tried to rape a white woman, though {{studies have shown that}} lynchings were tied to economic and social issues. More lynchings took place in South Carolina in the 1890s than in any other decade, and in Edgefield and several other counties, such killings outnumbered lawful executions.|$|E
5|$|Shunt surgery, usually {{performed}} by neurosurgeons, involves {{the creation of}} a conduit by which CSF can be drained into another body cavity. The initial procedure is usually a lumboperitoneal (LP) shunt, which connects the subarachnoid space in the lumbar spine with the peritoneal cavity. Generally, a pressure valve is included in the circuit to avoid excessive drainage when the patient is erect. LP shunting provides long-term relief <b>in</b> <b>about</b> <b>half</b> the cases; others require revision of the shunt, often on more than one occasion—usually due to shunt obstruction. If the lumboperitoneal shunt needs repeated revisions, a ventriculoatrial or ventriculoperitoneal shunt may be considered. These shunts are inserted in one of the lateral ventricles of the brain, usually by stereotactic surgery, and then connected either to the right atrium of the heart or the peritoneal cavity, respectively. Given the reduced need for revisions in ventricular shunts, it is possible that this procedure will become the first-line type of shunt treatment.|$|E
5|$|Some {{molecules}} or {{particles are}} too large or too hydrophilic {{to pass through}} a lipid bilayer. Other molecules could pass through the bilayer but must be transported rapidly in such large numbers that channel-type transport is impractical. In both cases, these types of cargo can be moved across the cell membrane through fusion or budding of vesicles. When a vesicle is produced inside the cell and fuses with the plasma membrane to release its contents into the extracellular space, this process is known as exocytosis. In the reverse process, a region of the cell membrane will dimple inwards and eventually pinch off, enclosing {{a portion of the}} extracellular fluid to transport it into the cell. Endocytosis and exocytosis rely on very different molecular machinery to function, but the two processes are intimately linked and could not work without each other. The primary mechanism of this interdependence is the sheer volume of lipid material involved. In a typical cell, an area of bilayer equivalent to the entire plasma membrane will travel through the endocytosis/exocytosis cycle <b>in</b> <b>about</b> <b>half</b> an hour. If these two processes were not balancing each other, the cell would either balloon outward to an unmanageable size or completely deplete its plasma membrane within a matter of minutes.|$|E

5|$|Allosaurus {{had nine}} {{vertebrae}} in the neck, 14 in the back, and {{five in the}} sacrum supporting the hips. The number of tail vertebrae is unknown and varied with individual size; James Madsen estimated about 50, while Gregory S. Paul considered that to be too many and suggested 45 or less. There were hollow spaces in the neck and anterior back vertebrae. Such spaces, which are also found in modern theropods (that is, the birds), are interpreted as having held air sacs used in respiration. The rib cage was broad, giving it a barrel chest, especially in comparison to less derived theropods like Ceratosaurus. Allosaurus had gastralia (belly ribs), {{but these are not}} common findings, and they may have ossified poorly. In one published case, the gastralia show evidence of injury during life. A furcula (wishbone) was also present, but has only been recognized since 1996; in some cases furculae were confused with gastralia. The ilium, the main hip bone, was massive, and the pubic bone had a prominent foot that may have been used for both muscle attachment and as a prop for resting the body on the ground. Madsen noted that <b>in</b> <b>about</b> <b>half</b> of the individuals from the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry, independent of size, the pubes had not fused to each other at their foot ends. He suggested that this was a sexual characteristic, with females lacking fused bones to make egg-laying easier. This proposal has not attracted further attention, however.|$|E
