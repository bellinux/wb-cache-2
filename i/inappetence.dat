50|$|Grade 3 metritis: Animals {{with signs}} of toxemia such as <b>inappetence,</b> cold extremities, depression, and/or collapse.|$|E
5000|$|The {{increased}} abomasal pH also {{stimulates the}} production of gastrin and thus hypergastrinemia, which is {{closely associated with the}} <b>inappetence.</b> This parasite-associated drop in intake {{has been shown to be}} largely responsible for impaired weight gain.|$|E
50|$|The {{incubation}} {{period for the}} disease ranges from two to 15 days. An infected bird may exhibit several signs, including respiratory signs (gasping, coughing), nervous signs (depression, <b>inappetence,</b> muscular tremors, drooping wings, twisting of head and neck, circling, complete paralysis), swelling of the tissues around the eyes and neck, greenish, watery diarrhea, misshapen, rough- or thin-shelled eggs and reduced egg production.|$|E
50|$|Desert sheep, zebu {{calves and}} Nubian goats were fed varying amounts of dry Capparis tomentosa leaves and died or {{were killed in}} extremis at various times after the {{commencement}} of dosing. Signs of Capparis poisoning in the sheep and calves were; weakness of the hind limbs, staggering, swaying, flexion of the fetlock and phalangeal joints, pain in the sacral region, <b>inappetence</b> and recumbency. There was {{a decrease in the}} level of total protein and calcium and an increase of glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), ammonia, sodium and potassium in serum. The main pathological changes were vacuolation of the neurons and axons in the spinal cord, with necrosis of the centrilobular hepatocytes and renal convoluted tubules and glomeruli. In Capparis-fed goats, anaemia developed and the results of kidney and liver function tests were correlated with clinical abnormalities and pathologic changes. The prominent features of toxicity were <b>inappetence,</b> locomotor disturbances, paresis especially of the hind limbs and recumbency. Lesions comprised perineuronal vacuolation in the gray matter of the spinal cord at the sacral region, centrilobular hepatocellular necrosis, degeneration of the renal proximal convoluted and collecting tubules, serous atrophy of the cardiac fat and renal pelvis and straw-coloured fluid in serious cavities. One goat which was receiving Capparis stem at 2.5 g/kg on an every other day basis for 8 days, developed signs of toxicosis, but recovered following cessation of plant administration.|$|E
50|$|The ASPCA {{reports this}} plant as being toxic to cats. They {{are said to}} cause vomiting, <b>inappetence,</b> lethargy, kidney failure, and even death. Cats are the only species known to be affected. The National Animal Poison Control Center says that certain types of lilies can cause renal failure in cats that have {{ingested}} {{any part of the}} lily. The Society of American Florists, a floral industry umbrella organization, recommends keeping lilies {{out of the reach of}} cats. It is important to note that lilies do not pose a problem for other pets or humans. The Cat Fanciers Association suggests alternatives: Easter orchids, Easter cacti, Easter daisies or violets.|$|E
50|$|The {{polygamous}} {{roe deer}} males clash over territory {{in early summer}} and mate in early autumn. During courtship, when the males chase the females, they often flatten the underbrush, leaving behind areas of the forest {{in the shape of}} a figure eight called 'roe rings'. Males may also use their antlers to shovel around fallen foliage and soil as a way of attracting a mate. Roebucks enter rutting <b>inappetence</b> during the July and August breeding season. Females are monoestrous and after delayed implantation usually give birth the following June, after a 10-month gestation period, typically to two spotted fawns of opposite sexes. The fawns remain hidden in long grass from predators; they are suckled by their mother several times a day for around three months. Roe deer adults often abandon their young if they sense or smell that an animal or human has been near it. Young female roe deer can begin to reproduce when they are around 6 months old. During the mating season, a male roe deer may mount the same doe several times over a duration of several hours.|$|E

40|$|A 12 year-old male {{castrated}} {{domestic shorthair}} cat {{was presented to}} Cornell University’s Hospital for Animals’ Internal Medicine service for a history of chronic coughing, weight loss, <b>inappetence,</b> and lethargy. He had an approximately 3 month history of coughing that was not paroxysmal and was productive with one episode of hemoptysis. He developed <b>inappetence</b> during this time. There were no changes in drinking, urination, or defecation. The patient lived with 6 other strictly indoor cats that {{showed no signs of}} illness. The patient had no travel history and was not receiving any medications. He was tested FeLV/FIV negative one year ago. The patient was referred to Cornell University for further work-up after diagnostic testing by the primary care veterinarian revealed unusual thoracic radiographs. On presentation, the patient was quiet, alert, and responsive with normal vital parameters and a body condition score of 3 out of 9. He had increased lung sounds bilaterally and mild serous ocular and nasal discharge. A right thyroid slip was also noted on exam. The remainder of his physical exam was unremarkable. The problem list for this patient included chronic coughing, weight loss, <b>inappetence,</b> lethargy, serous ocular and nasal discharge, and right thyroid slip. Differential diagnoses for this patient included neoplasia, infectious causes and/or inflammatory causes. Diagnostic testing for this patient included complete blood count, chemistry panel, urinalysis, baseline T 4, thoracic radiographs, CT scan, and tracheal wash.

40|$|Attribution License, which permits {{unrestricted}} use, distribution, {{and reproduction}} in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. The clinical and pathology {{features of a}} cow with uterine adenocarcinoma and multiple metastasis are described. Weight loss, <b>inappetence,</b> mild respiratory signs, and reduced milk yield were evident on clinical examination. Grossly deformed uterus, enlarged iliac lymph nodes, and rosary arranged nodules in the mesentery were felt by rectal palpation. Right side laparotomy revealed numerous small masses covering the omentum, and mesentery. Euthanasia was performed. Necropsy and histopathology exam revealed a uterine adenocarcinoma with multiple pulmonary, liver and mesentery metastasis. Uterine adenocarcinoma with metastasis {{should be included in}} the differential diagnosis of cows showing weight loss and mild respiratory distress and palpation of numerous firm nodules in the mesentery should be suggestive of neoplasias ’ metastasis. 1. Case Description A 5. 5 -year-old Holstein cow was presented in May 2008 for clinical examination because of <b>inappetence</b> and milk and weight loss over a two-week period. The cow had calved three times and the last calving was in November 2007. In March 2008 the cow was found in heat and was inseminated withou...|$|E
40|$|Young Rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were {{infected}} orally {{with a human}} strain of Campylobacter jejuni. The disease induced was mild, with <b>inappetence</b> and diarrhoea of short duration, but prolonged intermittent excretion of the bacteria in the faeces occurred. Bacteraemia was generally present for 2 [...] 3 days and later the organisms localized in the liver and gall bladder. Recovered animals, when challenged with the same strain, showed no clinical symptoms, no bacteraemia, and excreted the organisms in the faeces for only 3 days...|$|E
40|$|Trypanosoma evansi caused severe anemia in {{horses and}} {{pronounced}} leukopenia in dogs, both naturally infected. The horses presented microcytic normochromic anemia {{and the dogs}} showed microcytic hypochromic anemia. The clinical signs observed were fever, anemia, edema of the legs and lower parts, weakness and <b>inappetence.</b> Light microscopic studies demonstrated that Trypanosoma evansi produced several alterations in erythrocytes of dogs and horses. These pathologic changes included vacuolation, acanthocytes, dacrocytes, codocytes, microspherocytes and bizarre shapes. Mature erythrocyte were observed adhered to trypanosomes. Erythrophagocytosis was also demonstred...|$|E
40|$|A {{permanently}} captive 21 -year-old male {{bald eagle}} {{was diagnosed with}} chronic degenerative joint disease in the right stifle with severe lameness (Grade 5) based on radiography. Clinical signs included decreased movement, vocalization, non weight-bearing on the affected limb, <b>inappetence,</b> depression, and pododermatitis on the left foot (bumblefoot, Grade 3). The eagle was treated with anti-inflammatory or analgesic drugs including carprofen and celecoxib. As there was no observed clinical improvement {{with any of the}} treatments, acupuncture treatment was provided. The eagle was treated with dry needle acupuncture once per week for 2  months and biweekly for another 2  months. The Traditional Eastern Medicine diagnosis of this eagle was Bony Bi syndrome. The selected acupuncture points were ST 36, LI 4, BL 40, BL 60, GB 34, and Ba Feng (Table 3). The lameness score improved from Grade 5 to Grade 1 after 4  months of acupuncture treatment. The observed pododermatitis improved from Grade 3 to Grade 0. Symptoms including <b>inappetence</b> and vocalizations were significantly reduced over the 4  month period. There was no significant improvement in the radiographic signs. In conclusion, acupuncture may be a potential medical option for permanently captive raptors having musculoskeletal conditions, such as degenerative joint disease...|$|E
40|$|A 7 -month-old, male European cat was {{examined}} because of weakness and <b>inappetence.</b> The cat was dehydrated, polypnoeic and severely weak. Severe, generalised muscle atrophy was present. Spinal reflexes were all decreased to absent. Blood analysis and urinalysis showed several abnormalities, including intermittent hyperoxaluria. The L-gliceric acid concentration was remarkably increased. Electrodiagnostic {{tests of the}} peripheral nervous system were abnormal. At necropsy, generalised muscle atrophy was observed. Microscopically, both kidneys showed intraluminal birefringent oxalate crystals. Motor neuron degeneration and accumulation of neurofilaments were observed in the axons of the spinal motor neurons...|$|E
40|$|A 7 {{year old}} gray Warmblood gelding {{presented}} with a three day history of intermittent fevers, <b>inappetence</b> and colic after being imported from Germany. On initial presentation a mild pneumonia/pleuropneumonia triggered by shipping was suspected {{as well as an}} unidentified colon impaction. Initially the gelding responded well to medical management of the pneumonia and impaction. A few days after presentation, the gelding showed signs of dyschezia. An extraluminal mass was detected on rectal palpation, ultrasonography and aspiration confirmed it to be a perirectal abscess. The abscess was surgically drained and the gelding recovered well...|$|E
40|$|A ten week old Border Collie mix {{presented}} with recurrent lethargy, <b>inappetence,</b> and vomiting. In {{the two weeks}} prior to presentation, sulfadimethoxine, abendazole, and fenbendazole treatments were administered for parasitism and suspected infection. Results of a complete blood count on presentation revealed pancytopenia. Cytological evaluation of a bone marrow aspirate showed hypercellularity and regenerative changes. Fluid therapy, antibiotics, and discontinuation of the other medications resulted in a complete recovery. Drug-induced bone marrow suppression was suspected based on resolution of pancytopenia following drug withdrawal and absence of infectious, neoplastic, autoimmune, and primary bone marrow disease...|$|E
40|$|A {{one year}} old male Labrador dog was {{presented}} {{with a history of}} frequent vomiting, <b>inappetence,</b> depression, restlessness and with a suspicion of ingestion of metal key ring.

40|$|An 8 -year old {{neutered}} male German Shepherd {{presented with}} vomiting, hindlimb weakness, and <b>inappetence.</b> A cranioventral mediastinal mass and an enlarged, gas-filled esophagus {{was found on}} thoracic radiography and computed tomography. Clinical and serological [findings] {{were consistent with the}} diagnosis of myasthenia gravis. The mass was surgically excised which resulted in gradual resolution of signs and decreased serum acetycholine receptor antibody titers. Histopathological evaluation of the mass confirmed a malignant thymoma. The dog's clinical signs recurred three months post-operatively and the dog was euthanized. Clincal signs, diagnostics, treatment of a dog with a thymoma and myasthenia gravis are described...|$|E
40|$|An 8 -year-old, male {{castrated}} Labrador Retriever {{presented with}} coughing, <b>inappetence,</b> lethargy and fever. Two {{days prior to}} presentation, one dose of fenbendazole had been given for chronic, intermittent diarrhea. Routine hemogram showed a severe neutropenia and moderate thrombocytopenia, while bone marrow aspirate cytology revealed bone marrow hypoplasia. Supportive care, including fluid therapy initially and broad-spectrum antibiotics for several weeks, resulted in complete resolution of clinical signs and hematologic abnormalities. An adverse drug reaction to fenbendazole was suspected based on the absence of detectable infectious and neoplastic causes as well as resolution of hematologic abnormalities following drug withdrawal...|$|E
40|$|The gastric {{fluid and}} feces of three belugas from the Mystic Aquarium were {{assessed}} {{for the presence}} of Helicobacter spp. Gastric fluid and feces from the two clinically healthy belugas were negative for helicobacter, and endoscopy performed on these animals revealed no lesions. However, a helicobacter isolate and PCR product similar to helicobacter strains previously recovered from dolphins were identified, respectively, from the feces and gastric fluid of a beluga manifesting intermittent <b>inappetence</b> and lethargy. Esophageal and forestomach ulcers were noted on endoscopy. This is the first report of novel Helicobacter spp. being identified from whales...|$|E
40|$|The clinicopathological {{aspects of}} an {{outbreak}} of camelpox in an experimental camel herd in Riyadh are recorded. The morbidity rate in camel calves was 100 % with a corresponding morbidity rate of 33 % in pregnant females. Premonitory signs comprised fever, <b>inappetence</b> and listlessness, followed by localized or generalized skin eruptions typical of this disease. One of the pregnant females aborted and another gave a stillbirth. However, apart from one case of neonatal infection that terminated fatally, all of the infected camels recovered slowly. Blood analysis of the infected camel calves revealed anemia, hypoalbuminemia and elevated serum aspartate aminotransferase and garnma-glutamyl transferase activities...|$|E
40|$|A 3 -year-old Maltese-cross dog {{presented}} with a 4 -month history of chronic diarrhoea and <b>inappetence.</b> Poorly regenerative anaemia, leukocytosis and hypoproteinaemia were evident on several occasions. Biopsies of stomach, duodenum and colon revealed marked infiltration of mucosae by macrophages containing many acid-fast bacilli. Similar organisms were numerous in a faecal smear. Melaena, haematochezia and severe abdominal pain developed and were unresponsive to therapy. Following euthanasia and necropsy, histiocytic cells containing acid-fast bacilli were found throughout the gastrointestinal tract, mesenteric and peripheral lymph nodes, spleen, liver, kidney and lungs. The organism was identified as Mycobacterium avium by bacterial culture and polymerase chain reaction testing...|$|E
40|$|A two-year-old female Lucerne Hound was {{presented}} with a one-week history of signs of progressive neck pain, <b>inappetence,</b> apathy, and an elevated rectal temperature. Findings of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were consistent with a foreign body abscess in the epidural space {{at the level of}} the first and second cervical vertebrae. A left-sided dorso-lateral atlantoaxial approach was performed, revealing an epidural abscess containing a grass awn. The clinical signs resolved within three days of surgery and the dog made a full recovery. This case report shows that grass awns can migrate to the atlantoaxial region in dogs and MRI findings lead to a suspicion of caudo-cranial migration within the spinal canal...|$|E
40|$|Urogenital {{infections and}} vaginal {{discharge}} are common complaints of swine producers and breeding herd managers. This {{is an area}} of great concern, not only for producers but also for swine veterinarians. This syndrome has been on the increase in recent years and is associated with intensive management of swine. Some of the manifestations of this syndrome are reproductive failure, poor performance, <b>inappetence,</b> and underconditioned sows. This is a source of great economic loss to the producer as reproductive efficiency {{is one of the most}} accurate predictors of swine enterprise profitability. Even so published information on this syndrome has only been available in recent years and is anything but plentiful...|$|E
40|$|The {{principle}} {{goals of}} treating diabetes in cats are {{to correct the}} major clinical signs of diabetes (weight loss, polydipsia / polyuria, and polyphagia or <b>inappetence),</b> and to prevent diabetic ketoacidosis. Additional goals are {{to minimize the risk}} of hypoglycaemia by appropriate dose adjustment of insulin or oral hypoglycaemic agents. Appropriate therapy of cats may also lead to diabetic remission, although currently it is not possible at diagnosis to predict which cats are more likely to go into remission. Treatment that is most effective in correcting hyperglycaemia is more likely to lead to remission by facilitating the recovery of the pancreatic cells from glucose toxicity...|$|E
40|$|A high {{incidence}} of gingival overgrowth occurred {{in a group of}} New Zealand White rabbits receiving daily cyclosporine (15 mg/kg IM) while on a retinoblastoma study. Over the course of 2 mo, rabbits presented with clinical signs of ptyalism (4 of 18 rabbits), <b>inappetence</b> (3 of 18), or both (3 of 18); facial dermatitis and erythema occurred secondary to ptyalism. Reducing the dose of cyclosporine to 10 mg/kg led to complete resolution of clinical signs in all but 2 rabbits, which then received azithromycin (62. 5 mg PO once daily for 7 d), a common treatment for cyclosporine-induced gingival overgrowth in other species. After dose reduction and azithromycin treatment, clinical signs resolved and did not reoccur {{for the remainder of the}} study. Fourteen rabbits were necropsied at the end of the study, and gingival width was measured. Although some rabbits were clinically normal, the gingiva in all rabbits was grossly thickened. Rabbits on cyclosporine had molar gingiva that was significantly thicker (4. 8 mm) than controls (2. 5 mm) not treated with cyclosporine. Histologic analysis of the gingiva revealed mild to moderate gingival epithelial hyperplasia, hyperkeratosis, and mild inflammation. Gingival overgrowth is a known side effect of cyclosporine administration in other species but, to our knowledge, this report is the first description of the condition in rabbits. Because rabbits frequently are used in studies that involve systemic cyclosporine administration, clinicians are advised to include this possibility in their differential list for cases involving hypersalivation, facial dermatitis, or <b>inappetence</b> in rabbits...|$|E
40|$|A Clydesdale mare was {{examined}} for weight loss, <b>inappetence,</b> ptyalism, and dysphagia. The main abnormality revealed by serum biochemistry was a marked hyperglobulinemia, and protein electrophoresis revealed a monoclonal gammopathy in the gamma region. The urine was positive for Bence Jones proteins. These findings suggested a plasma cell tumor. The neoplasm {{could not be}} located with extensive antemortem examination. At postmortem, neoplastic cells morphologically compatible with plasma cells and positive for equine IgG with imunoperoxidase staining infiltrated the pericardium, mediastinal stromal tissues, adrenal glands, meninges, atrioventricular valves, aorta, abdominal and thoracic fat, and nerves, including the trigeminal nerve. The neoplastic cells invading the cranial nerves were responsible {{for many of the}} presenting signs...|$|E
40|$|A 17 -year-old Friesian gelding {{presented}} to the Cornell University Large Animal Emergency Service on 3 / 28 / 14 for a 1 day history of lethargy, <b>inappetence</b> and an approximately 8 hour history of dyspnea and colic. The horse was seen by the referring veterinarian who found the horse to be tachycardic, dyspneic, and febrile with muddy mucous membranes and a prolonged capillary refill time. No borborygmi were heard on abdominal auscultation and nasogastric tubing yielded no gastric reflux. The horse was then given flunixin, ceftiofur crystalline free acid, and detomidine. The horse became displayed signs of discomfort when mineral oil was administered via nasogastric intubation. The horse was then referred to Cornell for suspected colitis...|$|E
40|$|A 5 -year-old Welsh Pony mare {{presented}} {{with a history of}} dullness and <b>inappetence</b> and a large swelling {{on the left side of}} the neck extending to the pectoral region. Flunixin meglumine had been administered intravenously 10 days previously for treatment of laminitis. The pony was anaemic at presentation. Clostridium perfringens was isolated from an abscess overlying the left external jugular vein. Treatment consisted of supportive treatment, drainage of the abscess and administration of sodium benzyl penicillin G intravenously. A marked improvement in the mare's demeanour and a gradual increase in packed cell volume over a period of one month were observed. The historical, clinical and clinicopathological findings were consistent with immune-mediated haemolysis associated with C. perfringens infectio...|$|E
