5|$|The {{stage of}} the Kaiserkeller was made of planks of wood {{balanced}} {{on the top of}} beer crates, so the two groups made a bet to see to who {{would be the first to}} break it. After punishing the stage for days, a slight crack appeared, and when Storm jumped off the top of the upright piano it finally broke. Johnny 'Guitar' Byrne remembered that as Storm hit the stage, it cracked loudly and formed a V-shape around him. He disappeared into it, and all the amplifiers and drummer Ringo Starr's cymbals slid into the hole. Koschmider was furious, and had to replace the live music with a <b>juke</b> <b>box.</b> Both groups went across the road to Harold's cafe for breakfast on the Grosse Freiheit, but were followed by Koschmider's doormen, armed with coshes, who beat them all as punishment.|$|E

25|$|In December, Canadian-born Sydney Newman {{arrived at}} BBC Television {{as the new}} Head of Drama. Newman was a science fiction fan who had overseen several such {{productions}} in his previous positions at ABC Television and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. In March 1963, he was made aware by Baverstock – now promoted to Controller of Programmes – of {{a gap in the}} schedule on Saturday evenings between the sports showcase Grandstand and the pop music programme <b>Juke</b> <b>Box</b> Jury. Ideally, any programme scheduled here would appeal to children that had previously been accustomed to the timeslot; the teenaged audience of <b>Juke</b> <b>Box</b> Jury; and the adult sports fan audience of Grandstand. Newman decided that a science fiction programme would be perfect to fill the gap, and enthusiastically took up the existing Script Department research, initiating several brainstorming sessions with Wilson, Braybon, Frick and another BBC staff writer, C. E. 'Bunny' Webber.|$|E
25|$|Savile {{started playing}} records in dance halls {{in the early}} 1940s, and {{claimed to be the}} first DJ.

It was billed as 'Jimmy Savile introducing <b>Juke</b> <b>Box</b> Doubles'. Savile is acknowledged as a pioneer of using twin turntables for continuous music playing at parties, although his claim to have been the first is disputed; twin turntables were illustrated in the BBC Handbook in 1929 and advertised for sale in Gramophone magazine in 1931.|$|E

25|$|The St. Pauli {{quarter was}} well known as being an area where prostitutes were to be found, and was {{dangerous}} for anyone that looked different than the usual clientele.

Brown thought that Epstein sounded [...] "very groggy", and suggested that he take a train back down to the nearest railway station, in Uckfield, instead of driving under the influence of Tuinals. Epstein replied that he would eat something, read his mail and watch <b>Juke</b> <b>Box</b> Jury before phoning Brown to tell him which train to meet. He never called again.|$|E
500|$|When Controller of BBC Television Donald Baverstock alerted Newman of {{the need}} for a {{programme}} {{to bridge the gap between}} the sports showcase Grandstand and pop music programme <b>Juke</b> <b>Box</b> Jury on Saturday evenings, he decided that a science-fiction drama would be the perfect vehicle for filling the gap and gaining a family audience. Although much work on the genesis of the series was done by Donald Wilson, C. E. Webber and others, it was Newman who created the idea of a time machine larger on the inside than the out and the character of the mysterious [...] "Doctor", both of which remain at the heart of the programme. He is also believed to have come up with the title Doctor Who, although actor and director Hugh David later credited this to his friend Rex Tucker, the initial [...] "caretaker producer" [...] of the programme.|$|E
500|$|In 1947, a young disk jockey in Charlotte, North Carolina {{who worked}} the {{overnight}} shift had recently received some older records which he brought to work with him.

By afternoon, the city's music stores were calling the radio station, hoping to learn where they could order copies of [...] "Heartaches". [...] Both Victor and Decca went into their vaults to find their masters of the record and began pressing them for southern United States sales.
