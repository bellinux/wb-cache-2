500|$|Pinkner and Wyman {{revealed}} {{in a conference}} call interview that the episode was the [...] "culmination of {{a lot of things that}} [...] had been working on for quite a while". Though they loved all of their episodes, the two stated that [...] "Entrada" [...] was a particular favorite of theirs, with Pinker elaborating that [...] "if the only episode of Fringe you ever tune into watch is this one, sure, it’s <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> five minutes to catch up, but you will feel what’s going on, and you will understand the relationships... a great entry point". The producers considered making [...] "Entrada" [...] the mid-season finale, but instead selected [...] "Marionette", the following week's episode.|$|E
6000|$|... "All arranged," [...] {{answered}} Sam. [...] "We are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> up. Dick {{is going}} to take Dora in a buggy, and Tom and I are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> and Nellie in a two-seated. The baggage can go in a wagon behind." ...|$|E
60|$|Come back, you maniac. I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> home, and you're {{going to}} lie down.|$|E
6000|$|... "My little maid, this is well," [...] {{said the}} Countess. [...] "Come with me. I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>thee</b> <b>to</b> a kind and holy dame who will, I trust, {{with the blessing}} of Heaven, be able to heal thee better than we have done." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{that is the}} {{position}} <b>you</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> now--since <b>you</b> received my packet from James MacHenry," [...] said Jerry, deliberately.|$|R
6000|$|... "Uncle George," [...] said Rollo, [...] "how {{much longer}} is it <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> for <b>you</b> <b>to</b> study these {{paintings}} and statues till you are satisfied?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now, Tommy,' said Merton, 'we must waken Batsy, and Miss Blossom is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> both home. Hope {{we shall}} often meet.' ...|$|E
60|$|LAWTON: 'If {{you suppose}} I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> {{at your own}} figure--' They walk up the room together, and return as before.|$|E
6000|$|They were at once forthcoming. [...] "What the deuce {{are they}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> away for?" [...] he said. [...] "Is your {{education}} finished?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No {{hope for}} you," [...] says I, [...] "if you've got the Mary-Jane {{infirmity}} at your age. I thought it wasn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> on <b>you.</b> And patent leather shoes! All this in two little short months!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hullo! I {{beg your}} pardon," [...] Mr. Foker said, [...] "I <b>took</b> you,"--he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> say--"I <b>took</b> <b>you</b> for a {{commercial}} gent." [...] But he stopped that phrase. [...] "To whom have I the pleasure of speaking?" [...] he added.|$|R
6000|$|... "Merwell, are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> {{back what}} <b>you</b> said?" [...] demanded Dave, again. And {{he held his}} fist ready to strike another blow.|$|R
6000|$|O'FLAHERTY. Hold your noise, I tell you. Who's {{going to}} leave you? I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> with me. There now: does that satisfy you? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> into my husband's study," [...] she suggested, {{later on}} in the evening. [...] "He has some {{specimens}} of beetles--" ...|$|E
60|$|PATIOMKIN [jumping up and {{stopping}} {{him on his}} way to the door]. Tut tut! I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> to the Empress now, this very instant.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{want the}} roan {{in half an}} hour," [...] he said. [...] "I see you have Mrs. Leaver's saddle here, and as she's away, you had better put it on. I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the lady <b>you</b> saw with me to Drummond." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is Mrs. Burdett, Isobel," [...] I said, [...] "who {{looks after}} us here, {{and who is}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> charge of <b>you.</b> She will show you your room. I'm sorry that you will find it so tiny, {{but you can see}} that we are a little cramped here!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We hate it, sir," [...] Charlie said. [...] "We would, both of us, a {{thousand}} times rather enlist under you as private soldiers. Oh, sir, {{if there is any}} expedition <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> place, do <b>you</b> think there is a chance of our being allowed to go as volunteers?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> to headquarters. They would {{dispose of}} you there; but Numa {{can do it}} quite as effectively. Which do you prefer?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let them alone, Ferris, {{and come}} along. You'll {{get most of}} what you lost back to-morrow, and we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> home," [...] he said.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> {{away from}} here--down {{to my home}} in the country," [...] I said. [...] "Do {{you think you can}} stand the journey?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Mavungal {{is one of}} {{the busiest}} {{transport}} hubs of Kasaragod district. It connects to Kasaragod on the north and Kannur on the south. The road <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the west <b>takes</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> the beach in Kanhangad town. The eastern road <b>takes</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> hill towns Panathur, Sullia and Madikeri.|$|R
5000|$|Donald Martino, the 1974 winner, said, [...] "If {{you write}} music long enough, sooner or later, someone is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> pity on <b>you</b> {{and give you}} the damn thing. It {{is not always the}} award for the best piece of the year; it has gone to whoever hasn't gotten it before." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't care two straws about Deronda, or {{any other}} {{conceited}} hanger-on. You may talk to {{him as much as}} you like. He is not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> my place. <b>You</b> are my wife. And you will either fill your place properly--to the world and to me--or you will go to the devil." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> to our bungalows," [...] {{announced}} Dave. [...] "There {{you will}} have the pleasure of talking the matter over with Mr. Wadsworth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "C'est fini--l'affaire Poynton!" [...] he remarked. [...] "You can {{get ready}} {{as soon as}} you like, Guy. I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> into Paris to your sister!" ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{smiled in}} melancholy irony at the bewilderment, the childish {{forgetfulness}} {{of all the}} circumstances, which her words expressed. [...] "Oh, no! I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> with me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, indeed, I'm not as mean as that," [...] exclaimed Anne. [...] "This is all {{my fault}} and I'm {{certainly}} not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> let <b>you</b> <b>take</b> my punishment. I'll go myself and I'll go at once. The sooner it's over the better, for it will be terribly humiliating." ...|$|R
60|$|Well, {{what we have}} {{arranged}} is this. I have met with many kind people here, {{some of whom have}} been greatly interested in your story, and one of them--a very nice lady, who is <b>going</b> home--has offered <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> with her, and deliver you safely to my mother in England, there to wait till I come home and marry you.|$|R
6000|$|... "He knows {{everything}} about my past, {{and he has}} asked me to stay here, regardless of what some mean fellows like you might say about it. But I am not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> anything from <b>you</b> and Poole in the future; remember that!" [...] added Dave, and then {{he picked up his}} cap and jacket, put them on, and, followed by Phil, Roger, and a number of his other friends, walked slowly away.|$|R
6000|$|He {{would not}} be gainsaid, and she was really glad to escape {{the crowd in the}} car. He said: [...] "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> home to get warm." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come along," [...] Kendricks suggested. [...] "We shan't get a {{table at}} all {{at the place where}} I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> to dine, unless we are punctual." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Home!" [...] he {{ridiculed}} the notion. [...] "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> to {{the prettiest}} road you ever saw--around by French's Lower Falls. I only {{wish it was}} summer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, one thing, Clarence," [...] she summed up, [...] "I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> let {{you throw}} {{yourself}} away on them; {{and unless you}} {{see some of the}} university people in the congregation, I want you to use your old sermons from this out. They'll never know the difference; and I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> make <b>you</b> <b>take</b> one of the old sermons along every Sunday, so as to be prepared." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There, there, Mother, don't cry!" [...] he said, torn with anguish by her tears. Measured by man's tearlessness, her weeping seemed {{terrible to}} him. [...] "I didn't realize {{how things were}} going here. It was all my fault-or, at least, most of it. Grant's letter didn't reach me. I thought you {{were still on the}} old farm. But no matter; it's all over now. Come, don't cry any more, Mother dear. I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> care of <b>you</b> now." ...|$|R
2500|$|Glau {{trained with}} stunt {{coordinator}} Joel Kramer {{to prepare for}} the physical demands of her role. In learning martial arts for Serenity, Glau used her training in ballet to learn fight scenes by counts, as if they were choreographies. About bringing the practice to Terminator, Glau said, [...] "When you're working with a stunt guy ... and you need to anticipate every swing he's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> at <b>you</b> ... it's important that you know exactly the timing that it's all <b>going</b> <b>to</b> play out." [...] Training focused heavily on the destruction of breakable set pieces, safety in hand-to-hand fights and the use of a variety of firearms. Glau was challenged during fight scenes by not being able to move or act humanly by things such as pushing her hair out of her face. Glau modeled Cameron's walk after that of a dressage horse for its precision.|$|R
