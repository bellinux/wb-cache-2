25|$|A {{number of}} other rivers drain Siberia from eastern {{mountain}} ranges into the Pacific Ocean. The Amur River and its main tributary, the Ussuri, form {{a long stretch of}} the winding boundary between Russia and China. The Amur system drains most of southeastern Siberia. Three basins drain European Russia. The Dnieper, which flows mainly through Belarus and Ukraine, has its headwaters in the hills west of Moscow. The 1,860-kilometer |Don originates in the Central Russian Upland south of Moscow and then flows into the Sea of Azov and the Black Sea at Rostov-on-Don. The Volga is the third and by far the largest of the European systems, rising in the Valdai Hills west of Moscow and meandering southeastward for 3,510 kilometers before emptying into the Caspian Sea. Altogether, the Volga system drains about 1.4 million square kilometers. Linked by several canals, European Russia's rivers long have been a vital transportation system; the Volga system still carries two-thirds of Russia's <b>inland</b> <b>water</b> <b>traffic.</b>|$|E

50|$|By the 1600s, {{the town}} of Hingham was still agricultural. John Speed's maps of Kingdom of England during the Tudor period in 1610 and 1611, showed that the town was near Wymondham (also called Wimundham or Windham). This town was, at the time {{situated}} in the countryside with diverse terrain, profuse windmills, well-watered soil, a large degree of <b>inland</b> <b>water</b> <b>traffic,</b> few urban centers apart from Norwich, where a thriving cloth industry boomed. With Speed's drawing of a castle {{at the location of}} Hingham, the town must have been of some stature.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{much effort}} {{has been devoted to}} the {{development}} of strategies to monitor and mitigate the risk of collision on inland waterways. In particular, collision avoidance of inland water vessels with bridges has been widely recognized {{as a threat to the}} efficiency on river transportation systems. A comprehensive feasibility study has identified GNSS-based developments as the most promising board-side techniques for a reliable height determination as basis for bridge collision warning system. This article investigates the performance evaluation of selected GNSS-based techniques for the accurate height determination with <b>inland</b> <b>water</b> <b>traffic</b> purposes. The performance of different techniques is discussed in relation to the availability of data provided by land-side augmentation systems and under consideration of the available infrastructure. Technical challenges are also investigated...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{traffic in}} vehicular river corridors {{as well as}} the growing demands on efficiency and positional accuracy for inland water transportation of goods have made the determination of position, navigation and timing (PNT) data including additional integrity information {{and the development of a}} driver assistance system for inland water vessels based on this PNT data one of the most important challenges facing modern inland water transportation and a major practical problem for both navigators and geodesists. As the basis of a driver assistance system, this work describes the architecture of a system including the tightly-coupled sensor fusion of GNSS and IMU data for the determination of reliable PNT data in real-time with <b>inland</b> <b>water</b> <b>traffic</b> purposes. Moreover, a simple mathematical model of vessel manoeuvring is presented. Optimisation approaches based on Interior Point Optimisation and Sequential Quadratic Programming are applied to search for the vessel trajectory considering several traffic conditions. Finally, first numerical results are presented and discussed...|$|E

40|$|The use of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) in {{maritime}} applications {{has been}} widely recognized as {{an essential part of}} maritime navigation. This is due to good reception conditions on open water and due to the low accuracy requirements when navigating on the open sea. When it comes to inland waterways, GNSS is an important tool for the measurement of navigational data and position. In this context, a reliable navigational solution is the base for the implementation of applications for advanced assistance during berthing or bridge and lock passing. However, exactly these applications pose a challenge to a GNSS-based positioning solution, since the critical navigation-areas are often also those with restricted reception conditions. To ensure continuously accurate position navigation and timing (PNT) data, a so called PNT-Unit has been designed based on the fusion of GNSS, inertial (Inertial Measurement Unit - IMU) and other ship-borne sensors. One of the goals of the project PiLoNav (Precise and Integer Localization and Navigation in Rail and <b>Inland</b> <b>Water</b> <b>Traffic)</b> is the development of a manoeuvre guidance system tailored for these critical scenarios. Since the driver assistance will be based on absolute positioning, a precise survey of the environment is required as well as the precise vessel position and navigation states. While the first is a question {{of the quality of the}} underlying map the determination of latter parameters proves difficult...|$|E
