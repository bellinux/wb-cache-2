40|$|A {{number of}} {{observations}} indicate that heavy metals {{are able to}} alter cellular metabolic pathways through induction of a prooxidative state. Nevertheless, the outcome of heavy metal-mediated effects {{in the development of}} human diseases is debated and needs further insights. Cancer is a well-established DNA mutation-linked disease; however, epigenetic events are perhaps more important and harmful than genetic alterations. Unfortunately, we do not have reliable screening methods to assess/validate the epigenetic (promoter) effects of a physical or a chemical agent. We propose a mechanism of action whereby mercury acts as a possible promoter carcinogen. In the present contribution, we resume our previous studies on mercury tested at concentrations comparable with its occurrence as environmental pollutant. It is shown that Hg(II) elicits a prooxidative state in keratinocytes linked to inhibition of gap junction-mediated intercellular communication and proinflammatory cytokine production. These combined effects may on one hand isolate cells from tissue-specific homeostasis promoting their proliferation and on the other <b>hand</b> <b>tamper</b> the immune system defense/surveillance checkmating the whole organism. Since Hg(II) is not a mutagenic/genotoxic compound directly affecting gene expression, in a broader sense, mercury might be an example of an epigenetic tumor promoter or, further expanding this concept, a “metagenetic” effector...|$|E
40|$|To {{achieve a}} more {{comprehensive}} and sustained privacy control and tamper detection for the data in wireless sensor networks, we propose a novel multiple watermarking method, called Multi-mark, which consists of an annotation part and a fragile part. On the one hand, encrypted user’s personal information is embedded into the routine monitoring data, as annotation watermark, which can be extracted when, needed. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>tampering</b> is detected using fragile watermark. The former can resist various manipulative attacks, while the latter can detect any malicious modifications. Multi-mark not only provides privacy and security, but also saves data transmission amount and storage space. The experimental results show that Multi-mark can reduce 30 % of data traffic and only introduces very low computation cost. Multi-mark is a network structure-free scheme, which can be easily and efficiently applied to the resource limited sensor networks...|$|R
50|$|On {{the other}} <b>hand,</b> a heavy <b>tamper</b> necessitates a larger high-explosive {{implosion}} system. The primary {{stage of a}} modern thermonuclear weapon may use a lightweight beryllium reflector, which is also transparent to X-rays when ionized, allowing the primary's energy output to escape quickly {{to be used in}} compressing the secondary stage.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} documents a {{study of}} installation practices for buried pipe. Current practice was reviewed via the literature and surveys of users, manufacturers and others {{actively involved in the}} use of buried pipe. ^ Typical backfill materials were characterized through standard and variable effort compaction tests, CBR tests, penetration tests, and one-dimensional compression tests. Standard classification systems were compared and standard groups of backfill materials were evaluated. The soil properties that were used to develop the AASHTO SIDD designs are proposed for use as standard properties for all types of pipe. The constrained modulus, M s, is proposed as the standard measure of soil stiffness replacing the empirical modulus of soil reaction, E'. ^ Laboratory soil box tests and full scale field tests were conducted to investigate soil behavior during installation. Variables included pipe type and size, in situ soil condition, trench width, backfill type, compactive effort, haunching effort, and bedding condition. The tests show that all of the backfill related test variables {{have a significant effect on}} pipe behavior. Tests with controlled low strength material show that this is an excellent type of backfill. Computer modeling demonstrated that finite element analysis can effectively model installation effects as well as effects of fill over the pipe. The elastic solution for behavior of a buried pipe, developed by Burns and Richard shows promise as a basis for a simplified design method. ^ Recommendations for future practice include the use of soft bedding under the bottom of the pipe, and uncompacted backfill directly over the top of the pipe. Selection of trench width must consider the ability to place and compact backfill in the haunch zone and at the sides of the pipe. <b>Hand</b> <b>tampers,</b> sized differently for different types of backfill, were shown to be useful for providing haunching effort. It was shown that relatively small changes in backfill density can have significant effects on backfill stiffness. ^ The project shows that pipe performance is controlled by installation practices. Proper implementation of a design process that realistically assess how a project will be built, and construction that understands and implements the design assumptions is imperative for successful long-term pipe performance. ...|$|R
50|$|A hinged blister {{is known}} as a clamshell, used for a variety of products. It {{can be used as a}} {{security}} package to deter package pilferage for small high-value items, such as consumer electronics. It consists of one sheet folded over onto itself and sometimes fused at the edges. They can be securely heat sealed, making them difficult to open by <b>hand</b> to deter <b>tampering.</b> A pair of scissors or a sharp knife is often required to open them (although these are often sold in similar packages). Care must be used to safely open some of these packages, as opening it without care can result in injury; 6,000 Americans are sent to the emergency room each year by injuries suffered in opening such packages.Wrap rage is sometimes the result.|$|R
30|$|Similarly to {{the error}} {{concealment}} techniques proposed by Adsumilli et al. [19] and Navak et al. [20], one popular no-reference tampering detection approach consists of using data hiding. Imaizumi et al. [24] detect and locate tampered areas in images using a reversible data hiding {{and a low}} cost scheme with efficiently multiplexed layers. The method proposed by Xu et al. [25] embeds data directly into the encrypted H. 264 /AVC video bitstream. Phadikar et al. [26], on the other <b>hand,</b> proposes a <b>tamper</b> detection and correction scheme based on a novel semi-fragile data hiding technique. This method {{is based on an}} integer wavelet transform and a quantization index modulation (QIM) algorithm. Tong et al. [27] also use a watermarking algorithm to detect and localize tampered areas. Lin et al. [28] present an authentication and recovery method for tampered images.|$|R
40|$|Image {{authentication}} {{is important}} in content delivery via untrusted intermediaries, such as peer-to-peer (P 2 P) file sharing. Many differently encoded versions of the original image might exist. On the other <b>hand,</b> intermediaries might <b>tamper</b> with the contents. Distinguishing the legitimate diversity of encodings from malicious manipulation is the challenge addressed in this paper. We develop a novel approach based on distributed source coding for the problem of backward-compatible image authentication. The key idea {{is to provide a}} Slepian-Wolf encoded quantized image projection as authentication data. This version can be correctly decoded only {{with the help of an}} authentic image as side information. Distributed source coding provides the desired robustness against legitimate encoding variations, while detecting illegitimate modification. We demonstrate false acceptance rates close to zero for authentication data sizes that are only a few percent of the compressed image size.

If what you say is true, Sophy, and you do {{sometimes}} look back to the past, and things is generally on the square, you'll go for that Olly and fetch her, for if I go back without that child, and throw up my <b>hand,</b> it's just <b>tampering</b> with the holiest affections and playing it mighty rough on as white a man as ever you saw, Sophy, to say nothing of your reputation, and everybody ready to buck agin us who has ten cents to chip in on.
