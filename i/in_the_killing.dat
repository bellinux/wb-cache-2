Hitler did not speak publicly about the killings, and seems never to have visited the concentration camps.|$|E
500|$|United States {{authorities}} {{concluded that}} <b>the</b> <b>killings</b> were <b>the</b> {{act of a}} single individual. [...] On 15 March 2012, an Afghan parliamentary probe team made up of {{several members of the}} National Assembly of Afghanistan had speculated that up to 20 U.S. soldiers were involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>killings.</b> <b>The</b> team later said they could not confirm claims that multiple soldiers took part <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>killings.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Iran blamed Israel and the U.S. for the assassinations. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton categorically {{denied any}} U.S. role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>killings,</b> a denial called [...] "plausible" [...] by analysts given the {{reported}} lack of U.S. intelligence assets in Iran. Israel neither confirmed nor denied its role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>killings.</b>|$|R

5|$|Al-Mukhtar and his {{supporters}} viewed Ubayd Allah's death as justice for his role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>killing</b> of Husayn at Karbala in 680. As {{a result of the}} battle, al-Mukhtar gained control over Mosul and the surrounding region, and he appointed Ibn al-Ashtar governor of Mosul. The Umayyad rout posed a major setback to Abd al-Malik's plans of establishing Umayyad authority over Iraq.|$|E
5|$|At daybreak on September 1, {{a relief}} force of C Company {{headquarters}} troops, led by American tanks, cleared {{the road to}} Sibidang-san and resupplied the 2nd Platoon, B Company, with ammunition {{just in time for}} it to repel another North Korean assault. This failed assault resulted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>killing</b> of 77 and capturing of 21 North Koreans. Although the 35th Infantry held all its original positions, except that of the forward platoon of G Company, 3,000 North Korean soldiers were behind its lines. The farthest eastern penetration reached the high ground just south of Chirwon overlooking the north-south road there.|$|E
5|$|David Cameron criticised the Labour Government's {{criminal}} justice system {{and the absence of}} father-figures in ethnic minority cultures, which he claimed as causes in the murder of Pryce. Cameron stated that lack of strong deterrent sentences for knife crimes and the failure of police to stop prolific criminals had played a role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>killing</b> of Pryce. He insisted that parental background had a key role in preventing crime and called for zero tolerance of knife crime, claiming that not enough criminals were being sent to jail.|$|E

5|$|During the Civil War {{the largest}} {{substantial}} {{conflict in the}} area was the Battle of Naseby in 1645, although a minor skirmish in the town resulted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>killing</b> of a parliamentarian officer Captain John Sawyer. Severe reprisals followed which included the carrying off to Northampton of the parish priest, Thomas Jones, and 40 prisoners {{by a group of}} Roundheads. However, after the Civil War Wellingborough was home to a colony of Diggers. Little is known about this period.|$|E
5|$|Following the rebels' defeat, he {{immigrated to}} Palestine, {{where he became}} a Muslim waqf (religious endowments) {{official}} and grew incensed at the plight of Palestinian Arab peasants. In the 1930s, he formed bands of local fighters and launched attacks against British and Jewish targets. He was eventually killed in a manhunt following his alleged role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>killing</b> of a British policeman. Israeli historian Tom Segev has called him 'the Arab Joseph Trumpeldor'. His campaign and death were factors {{that led to the}} 1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine.|$|E
5|$|Guy de Beauchamp {{is today}} remembered {{primarily}} {{for his part}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>killing</b> of Gaveston, but by his contemporaries he was considered a man of exceptionally good judgement and learning. He owned what was for his time a large collection of books, and his advice was often sought {{by many of the}} other earls. Next to Lancaster, he was the wealthiest peer in the nation, and after his death his lands and title were inherited by his son, Thomas de Beauchamp, 11th Earl of Warwick.|$|E

5|$|In June 2004, Williamson {{was murdered}} in his {{apartment}} by an acquaintance, Dwight Hayden, whom he had been aiding with financial handouts. Police believed that Hayden's motive was robbery, although J-FLAG also suggested that homophobia {{may have played a}} part <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>killing.</b> Hayden was subsequently sentenced to life in prison. Upon learning of the murder, a crowd assembled in New Kingston to celebrate Williamson's death, chanting homophobic slogans and lyrics. Conversely, the Jamaican LGBT community held a secret memorial for him, while protests against the killing were held by LGBT rights groups in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Persistent {{attempts}} by the Israeli government to identify another Palestinian leader to represent the Palestinian people failed. Arafat was enjoying the support of groups that, given his own history, would normally have been quite wary of dealing with or supporting him. Marwan Barghouti (a leader of al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades) emerged as a possible replacement during the Second Intifada, but Israel had him arrested for allegedly being involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>killing</b> of twenty-six civilians, and {{he was sentenced to}} five life terms.|$|E
5|$|The Villalba attack inaugurated a {{long series}} of Mafia attacks in Sicily on {{political}} activists, trade union leaders and ordinary peasants resisting Mafia rule. In the following years many left-wing leaders were killed or otherwise attacked, culminating <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>killing</b> of 11 people and the wounding of over thirty at a May 1 labour parade in Portella della Ginestra. The Portella della Ginestra massacre was attributed to the bandit and separatist leader Salvatore Giuliano. Nevertheless, the Mafia was suspected of involvement in the bloodbath and many other attacks on left-wing organisations and leaders.|$|E

5|$|The accused Fritz Knöchlein, a German national, in {{the charge}} of the Hamburg Garrison Unit, {{pursuant}} to Regulation 4 of the Regulations for the Trial of War Criminals, is charged with committing a war crime in that he {{in the vicinity of}} Paradis, Pas-de-Calais, France, on or about 27 May 1940, in violation of the laws and usages of war, was concerned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>killing</b> of about ninety prisoners-of-war, members of The Royal Norfolk Regiment and other British Units.|$|E
5|$|The concept, which {{originated}} in castles such as Krak des Chevaliers, was {{to remove the}} reliance on a central strongpoint and to emphasise the defence of the curtain walls. There would be multiple rings of defensive walls, one inside the other, with the inner ring rising above the outer so that its field of fire was not completely obscured. If assailants made it past {{the first line of}} defence they would be caught <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>killing</b> ground between the inner and outer walls and have to assault the second wall.|$|E
5|$|The third {{military}} tribunal, on 16 September 1975, {{also held}} in Hoyo de Manzanares, sentenced FRAP members Manuel Cañaveras, María Jesús Dasca, Concepción Trisián, José Luis Sánchez-Bravo and Ramón García Sanz to death, for their involvement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>killing</b> {{of a civil}} guard, Antonio Pose, in Madrid on 16 August 1975. The final tribunal took place in Barcelona, on 19 September, and gave the death penalty to ETA member Juan Txiki Paredes Manot, for killing armed policeman, Ovidio Díaz, in Barcelona on 6 June 1975.|$|E

5|$|Al Dawasir {{attacked}} Shia {{villages of}} Barbar and A'ali, while the Khalids attacked Sitra island. The attacks resulted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>killing</b> of 12 villagers, burning of several houses and raping of women. The violence settled after Colonel Knox, the British acting Political Resident arrived in Bahrain in two gunships. Knox forced Isa bin Ali to abdicate {{in favor of}} his elder son, Hamad. The Khalids had agreed {{to reduce taxes on}} residents of Sitra following the visit. However, as soon as Knox left, taxes were increased again, and Shia residents continued to be subjected to forced labor. The situation prompted some 500 Shia to hold a protest in front of the British Agency demanding a solution to the situation and equal taxation of citizens (taxes were only imposed on the Shia).|$|E
5|$|Chastain's {{final two}} {{roles of the}} year were in Wilde Salomé, a {{documentary}} based on her 2006 production of Salome, and the critically panned crime-thriller Texas Killing Fields. The latter, co-starring Sam Worthington and Jeffrey Dean Morgan, was a partly fictionalized version of the events <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>killing</b> fields of Texas, in which she played a homicide detective. Los Angeles Times Betsy Sharkey praised Chastain's polished Texas drawl, but criticized the film. Chastain's work in 2011, especially in The Help, Take Shelter and The Tree of Life, gained her awards from several critics' organizations, including the New York Film Critics Circle, the National Society of Film Critics and the Los Angeles Film Critics Association.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{accounts}} of the Irish annals, English and Scandinavian writers appear to see Mac Bethad as the rightful king of Moray: this is clear from their descriptions of the meeting with Cnut in 1027, before the death of Malcolm mac Máil Brigti. Malcolm was followed as king or earl by his brother Gillecomgan, husband of Gruoch, a granddaughter of King Kenneth III. It has been supposed that Mac Bethad {{was responsible for the}} killing of Gille Coemgáin in 1032, but if Mac Bethad had a cause for feud <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>killing</b> of his father in 1020, Malcolm too had reason to see Gille Coemgáin dead. Not only had Gillecomgan's ancestors killed many of Malcolm's kin, but Gillecomgan and his son Lulach might be rivals for the throne. Malcolm had no living sons, and the threat to his plans for the succession was obvious. As a result, the following year Gruoch's brother or nephew, who might have eventually become king, was killed by Malcolm.|$|E
50|$|The {{evidence}} against the men largely consisted of testimony provided by other inmates, {{who claimed that}} the defendants had admitted to their involvement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>killings</b> <b>in</b> private discussions, as well as confessions made by Anthony and Gilbert Melendez. Also considered was the confession Deeb had made to the two young women about his involvement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>killings,</b> {{as well as the}} life insurance policy he had taken out for his employee. Bite marks on the victims were also presented as evidence of Spence’s involvement.|$|R
