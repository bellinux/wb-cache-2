40|$|AbstractFull-genome {{sequences}} {{have been}} used to monitor the fine-scale dynamics of epidemics caused by RNA viruses. However, the ability of this approach to confidently reconstruct transmission trees is limited by the knowledge of the genetic diversity of viruses that exist within different <b>epidemiological</b> <b>units.</b> In order to address this question, this study investigated the variability of 45 foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) genome sequences (from 33 animals) that were collected during 2007 from eight premises (10 different herds) in the United Kingdom. Bayesian and statistical parsimony analysis demonstrated that these sequences exhibited clustering which was consistent with a transmission scenario describing herd-to-herd spread of the virus. As an alternative to analysing all of the available samples in future epidemics, the impact of randomly selecting one sequence from each of these herds was used to assess cost-effective methods that might be used to infer transmission trees during FMD outbreaks. Using these approaches, 85 % and 91 % of the resulting topologies were either identical or differed by only one edge from a reference tree comprising all of the sequences generated within the outbreak. The sequence distances that accrued during sequential transmission events between <b>epidemiological</b> <b>units</b> was estimated to be 4. 6 nucleotides, although the genetic variability between viruses recovered from chronic carrier animals was higher than between viruses from animals with acute-stage infection: an observation which poses challenges for the use of simple approaches to infer transmission trees.

40|$|Abstract. The present paper {{reports the}} results of a {{cross-sectional}} survey aimed at obtaining up-to-date information on the spatial distribution of different groups and/or species of helminths in water buffaloes from central Italy. Geographical information systems (GIS) and spatial analysis were used to plan the sampling procedures, to display the results as maps and to detect spatial clusters of helminths in the study area. The survey was conducted on 127 water buffalo farms, which were selected in the study area using a grid sampling approach, followed by proportional allocation. Faecal samples (n. = 1, 883) collected from the 127 farms were examined using the Flotac dual technique. Gastrointestinal strongyles were the most frequent helminths (33. 1 %) on the tested farms, followed by the liver fluke Fasciola hepatica (7. 1 %), the rumen fluke Calicophoron daubneyi (7. 1 %), the nematode Strongyloides spp. (3. 1 %), the lancet liver fluke Dicrocoelium dendriticum (2. 4 %) and the tapeworm Moniezia spp. (2. 4 %). In order to display the spatial distribution of the various helminths detected on the water buffalo farms (used as <b>epidemiological</b> <b>unit</b> in our study), point maps were drawn within the GIS. In addition, for each helminth, clustering of test-positive farms were investigated based on location determined by exact coordinates.

40|$|Ecological and {{epidemiological}} invasions {{occur in}} a spatial context. We investigated how these processes correlate to the distance dependence of spread or dispersal between spatial entities such as habitat patches or <b>epidemiological</b> <b>units.</b> Distance dependence is described by a spatial kernel, characterized by its shape (kurtosis) and width (variance). We also developed a novel method to analyse and generate point-pattern landscapes based on spectral representation. This involves two measures: continuity, which is related to autocorrelation and contrast, which refers to variation in patch density. We also analysed some empirical data where our results {{are expected to have}} implications, namely distributions of trees (Quercus and Ulmus) and farms in Sweden. Through a simulation study, we found that kernel shape was not important for predicting the invasion speed in randomly distributed patches. However, the shape may be essential when the distribution of patches deviates from randomness, particularly when the contrast is high. We conclude that the speed of invasions depends on the spatial context and the effect of the spatial kernel is intertwined with the spatial structure. This implies substantial demands on the empirical data, because it requires knowledge of shape and width of the spatial kernel, and spatial structure...|$|R

The study is based on recordings from 1994 in the ante-mortem database maintained by the Danish Poultry Council. The <b>epidemiological</b> <b>units</b> are the broiler flocks (about 4000 flocks) which are clustered within producers. Broiler flocks with ST-infected parent stocks show increased risk of salmonella infection, and also the hatchery affects the salmonella status significantly.

Epidemiological control would seem most efficient on starting at the top levels of the production hierarchy from which {{a major part of the}} ST contamination is derived. A secondary purpose of the study is to evaluate different statistical approaches and software for the analysis of a moderately-sized data set of veterinary origin.

Aim: The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess how general practitioners (GPs) in the area of Camerino-Matelica, Marche (Central Italy) manage their patients with IBD. Materials and methods: Before providing an educational course about IBD to GPs, we administered a simple questionnaire containing 10 multiple-choice questions, allowing for only one possible answer, to GPs in the target area. After the educational course we administered a satisfaction questionnaire and evaluated the hospitalization rates for IBD in the catchment area in the year following the course. Results: In our GP sample, 71. 8 % indicated that they needed better instruction regarding IBD to enable them to diagnose the conditions given the difficulties posed by nonspecific symptoms and the need to use invasive diagnostic methods such as colonoscopy. Early results after the educational course for GPs indicate a reduced rate of hospitalization for IBD but these data must be confirmed by future research. Conclusions: If specialists and GPs managed IBD patients more carefully, their patients would probably suffer from fewer relapses and would have a better quality of life, which would be likely to mean considerable cost savings for the public health care system and society in general.

We carried out studies on the population genetics of these fungi in order to gain more insight into their mode of propagation and life history as well as on their ability to evolve in response to control practices. Random Amplification Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers were used to study the genetic relationships among isolates at different geographic levels. Particular attention was given to the diversity existing at vineyard level. Diversity was also studied at regional level and supraregionally among populations from different regions. Ela isolates from single vineyards were all of different haplotypes and there was no gametic disequilibrium between RAPD markers. These findings strongly suggested that the population structure of the heterothallic Ela is shaped by random mating, being spread only by its ascospores. This population structure was also found at the regional scale with no genetic differentiation among Ela populations from different French regions. In Fop populations, an exclusive spread by basidiospores seemed to occur and genetic differentiation was very weak. RAPD markers were more difficult to detect for Phaeoacremonium species, indicating they had less polymorphism than Ela and Fop. Several different haplotypes of Pch and Pal were found at vineyard level, suggesting several outside sources for the primary inoculum. Populations of Pch and Pal from different regions appeared weakly differentiated.

The model showed good fit to the data (R 2 = 0. 76) and revealed considerable differences in reporting rates of ILI in different cities (up to a factor of 2. 2). (2) A statistical test was developed to examine the null hypothesis (H 0) that ILI incidence curves in two cities are essentially identical, and was tested using ILI data. Upon examining all possible pairs of incidence curves, 77. 4 % of pairs were found not to be different (H 0 was not rejected). It was concluded that all cities generally have the same attack rate and follow the same epidemic curve each season, although the attack rate changes from season to season, providing strong support for the &# 039;&# 039;Israel is one city&# 039;&# 039; hypothesis. The cities which were the most out of synchronization were Bnei Brak, Beersheba and Haifa, the latter two being geographically remote from all other cities in the dataset and the former geographically very close to several other cities but socially separate due to being populated almost exclusively by ultra-orthodox Jews.

When network analysis is applied to study the livestock movement patterns, the <b>epidemiological</b> <b>units</b> of interest (farm premises, counties, states, countries, etc.) are represented as nodes, and animal movements between the nodes are represented as the edges of a network. Unraveling a network structure, and hence the trade preferences and pathways, could be very useful to a researcher or a decision-maker. We implemented a community detection algorithm to find livestock communities that is consistent with the definition of a livestock production zone, assuming that a community is a group of farm premises in which an animal is more likely to stay during its life time than expected by chance. We applied this algorithm to the network of within animal movements made inside the State of Mato Grosso, for the year of 2007. This database holds information about 87, 899 premises and 521, 431 movements throughout the year, totalizing 15, 844, 779 animals moved.

RBS approaches are currently largely absent for aquatic animal diseases. A major constraint in developing RBS designs in the aquatic context is the lack of published data to assist in the design of RBS: this applies to data on (i) the relative risk of farm sites becoming infected due to {{the presence or absence of}} a given risk factor; (ii) the sensitivity of diagnostic tests (specificity is often addressed by follow-up investigation and re-testing and therefore less of a concern); (iii) data on the variability of prevalence of infection for fish within a holding unit, between holding units and at farm level. Another constraint is that some of the most basic data for planning surveillance are missing, e. g. data on farm location and animal movements. In Europe, registration or authorisation of fish farms has only recently become a requirement under EU Directive 2006 / 88. Additionally, the definition of the <b>epidemiological</b> <b>unit</b> (at site or area level) in the context of aquaculture is a challenge due to the often high level of connectedness (mainly via water) of aquaculture facilities with the aquatic environment. This paper provides a review of the principles, methods and examples of RBS in terrestrial, farmed and wild animals. It discusses the special challenges associated with surveillance for aquatic animal diseases (e. g. accessibility of animals for inspection and sampling, complexity of rearing systems) and provides an overview of current developments relevant for the design of RBS for fish diseases. Suggestions are provided on how the current constraints to applying RBS to fish diseases can be overcome...|$|E
40|$|The author {{participated in}} an {{international}} survey organised by the British Medical Research Council (MRC) <b>epidemiological</b> <b>unit</b> in Cardiff, Wales which set out to compare the prevalence of asthma in several countries. The motivation for participating {{in this study was}} that very little previous prevalence data for asthma is available for coloured or white children in South Africa. A protocol designed by the British MRC Epidaemiology Unit was followed. One thousand one hundred and seventy four white children aged 12 years attending a random selection of primary schools in the Southern Suburbs of Cape Town were studied. A standard MRC questionnaire on asthma was completed by parents. The subjects then underwent an exercise challenge test (ECT) which involved running on the level for six minutes. During the ECT, we measured the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEVl) before and after the exercise. A fall in post exercise FEVl of 15 % or greater was regarded as evidence of bronchoconstriction and considered diagnostic of asthma. This method is thought to identify 70 - 90 % of asthmatics (Anderson 1985, Lee et al 1989, Pierson 1988). Using this criterion, 52 (4. 4 %) of the children had asthma. The prevalence of 4. 4 % in this study is higher than 3. 1 % reported in a previous study of black children in Guguletu (Van Niekerk et al, Clinical Allergy 1979). However, the age spectrum of children was different in that study. Terblanche et al (1990) report the prevalence of exercise induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) in white and coloured children to be 5. 87 % and 4. 05 % respectively. The level of FEVl reduction for a diagnosis of EIB approved for this study was lower than usually accepted. Using conventional criteria for a diagnosis of EIB, Burr et al (1989) reported a prevalence of 7. 7 % in Cardiff, Wales. This study confirms that exercise induced asthma is a common problem in 12 -year old white children in Cape Town...|$|E
40|$|In the 2011 / 12 season, three {{influenza}} outbreaks {{were studied}} {{in nursing homes}} with high vaccination coverage in Navarre, Spain. Attack rates ranged from 2. 9 % to 67 %. Influenza A/Stockholm/ 18 / 2011 (H 3 N 2) virus strain was isolated from the three outbreaks. Vaccination should be complemented with other hygiene measures in nursing homes. Early detection of influenza outbreaks in nursing homes can aid in their control. Four influenza-like illness (ILI) outbreaks have been detected in nursing homes in Navarre, Spain, during the 2011 / 12 wave of seasonal influenza. Three of these outbreaks were reported rapidly after the detection of the first cases. These outbreaks were investigated by the <b>epidemiological</b> surveillance <b>unit</b> in the regio...|$|R
40|$|Peste des petits {{ruminants}} (PPR) is {{an acute}} infectious viral disease affecting domestic small ruminants (sheep and goats) and some wild ruminant species in Africa, the Middle East and Asia. A global PPR control strategy based on mass vaccination-in regions where PPR is endemic-was recently designed and launched by international organizations. Sahelian Africa {{is one of}} the most challenging endemic regions for PPR control. Indeed, strong seasonal and annual variations in mating, mortality and offtake rates result in a complex population dynamics which might in turn alter the population post-vaccination immunity rate (PIR), and thus be important to consider for the implementation of vaccination campaigns. In a context of preventive vaccination in <b>epidemiological</b> <b>units</b> without PPR virus transmission, we developed a predictive, dynamic model based on a seasonal matrix population model to simulate PIR dynamics. This model was mostly calibrated with demographic and epidemiological parameters estimated from a long-term follow-up survey of small ruminant herds. We used it to simulate the PIR dynamics following a single PPR vaccination campaign in a Sahelian sheep population, and to assess the effects of (i) changes in offtake rate related to the Tabaski (a Muslim feast following the lunar calendar), and (ii) the date of implementation of the vaccination campaigns. The persistence of PIR was not influenced by the Tabaski date. Decreasing the vaccination coverage from 100 to 80 % had limited effects on PIR. However, lower vaccination coverage did not provide sufficient immunity rates (PIR < 70 %). As a trade-off between model predictions and other considerations like animal physiological status, and suitability for livestock farmers, we would suggest to implement vaccination campaigns in September-October. This model is a first step towards better decision support for animal health authorities. It might be adapted to other species, livestock farming systems or diseases...|$|R
40|$|Straightforward {{adaptation}} of geographical and regional-science models to conceptual modeling {{of the epidemic}} spread of a contagious disease is achieved by: (a) using analogies and isomorphisms, and (b) using as a real example the observations made during a well studied epidemic of variola minor (the mild form of smallpox), a typical contagious disease. The {{adaptation of}} the Wilson model of planning for urban development includes (a) a static view (network) of the structure and activities {{of the population and}} of organizations (diffusion agencies such as day schools), and (b) the dynamic view (mechanism of epidemic spread) which includes the changes with time of elements of the network brought by flow of disease. Adaptation of the Brown model of spatial diffusion yields flows of disease occurring between micro-scale units (households) of social interactions but aggregations of these units do not participate explicitly in the flows. The occurence of successive generations of affected households is specified as well as the occurence of definite stages of the epidemic progression. Adaptation of the Alves-Morrill model of spatial diffusion yields (a) a network of social groups and interdependencies; (b) a simplified network of the mechanism of spread that shows flows of disease between individuals grouped into generations of infected individuals and generations of infective individuals; and (c) a more realistic view which shows the flows of disease between real <b>epidemiological</b> <b>units</b> such as households and school classes. Adaptation of the Morrill-Manninen model of spatial diffusion concentrates on the mechanism and parameters having the epidemic spread as output. The interdependencies between the parameters and between each parameter and the epidemic spread are represented, including feedback processes. Brown's model seems to be the best for describing the epidemic spread of contagious disease while the Morrill-Manninen model is the most promising for investigating the detailed mechanism of the spread. Since these two models complement each other, their combined use is indicated. epidemiology methods epidemics smallpox...|$|R
