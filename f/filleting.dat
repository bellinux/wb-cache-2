40|$|<b>Fillet</b> yield (i. e. the {{proportion}} of edible flesh from a given amount of fish) is a trait of high economic interest for species sold as <b>fillets.</b> Improving it by selective breeding {{is not an easy}} task, as it is a ratio trait, which causes mathematical difficulties. It is moreover a specific ratio where numerator (<b>fillet</b> weight) and denominator (body weight) are very strongly correlated (genetic and phenotypic correlations in the range 0. 89 – 0. 99). This led some authors to conclude that they have the same genetic and phenotypic basis, precluding selection for improved <b>fillet</b> yield. In this study, we propose to study <b>fillet</b> yield as a component of two traits, <b>fillet</b> weight and waste weight (waste weight = body weight- <b>fillet</b> weight, so the sum of head, bones, fins and viscera weight), which we expect to be less correlated. Using data from 5 batches of fish from 3 species (sea bass, sea bream, rainbow trout), we show that as expected, <b>fillet</b> weight and waste weight are less correlated than <b>fillet</b> weight and body weight (on average, r A = 0. 91 and r P = 0. 88 vs. r A = 0. 987, r P = 0. 981). We used stochastic simulation to generate genotypes and phenotypes of fish using those genetic parameters for <b>fillet</b> weight and waste weight. We simulated 10 generations of selection for increased <b>fillet</b> yield using nine selection indices. Five indices had rather similar performances, residual <b>fillet</b> weight (the residual of the regression of <b>fillet</b> weight to body weight), <b>fillet</b> yield, <b>fillet</b> to waste ratio, restricted selection index (a linear index aimed at improving <b>fillet</b> weight while keeping waste weight constant) and linear index (optimized to improve fillet/waste ratio). With these indices, the average selection gain was + 0. 66 % of <b>fillet</b> yield per generation (range 0. 30 to 0. 95 % using real genetic parameters from 5 fish batches). Selection for the difference between <b>fillet</b> weight and waste weight was 30 % less efficient, while selection for increased <b>fillet</b> weight or increased body weight was 55 – 65 % less efficient. Selection against waste weight had a null or even negative impact on <b>fillet</b> yield. Factors favorable to higher selection gains are low initial <b>fillet</b> yield, different heritabilities and CVs of <b>fillet</b> weight and waste weight, low genetic correlation and high phenotypic correlation of <b>fillet</b> weight and waste weight. These results suggest that although <b>fillet</b> weight and body weight are strongly correlated and proportional to each other, moderate selection gains on <b>fillet</b> yield are possible. We consider {{it would be useful to}} add waste weight in the parameters recorded in future genetic studies on <b>fillet</b> yield...|$|R
25|$|This {{challenge}} {{was an early}} start for the 4 remaining finalists Bill, Sophie, Fenton and David. It began at the fish markets in Sydney's Chinatown where Ben explained the art of finding a fresh fish. Each finalist asked around to find out {{as much information as}} they could about a fish they had never cooked before. Fenton was so impressed with the <b>filleting</b> of the salmon that he wanted to meet the man responsible. Turned out it was the No. 1 salmon filleter in NSW. At the docks, 4 BBQ's were set up and each contestant was given 60 seconds to look down the barrel of the camera and talk about how they would prepare this fish, as though they were hosting a show. This was a test to see how much of the information they could retain and deliver to an audience in a simple to understand language. A Teppanyaki Chef came out and gave the finalists a crash course in the ancient Japanese technique. For the final challenge the remaining 4 were taken to a Teppanyaki restaurant and asked to cook a meal for the judges using the technique. Each contestant was judged on the ability to talk and cook at the same time while using techniques that they were all unfamiliar with. The judges then decided they would send one home who they thought was 'throwing' the contest.|$|E
500|$|Trout can {{be cooked}} {{as soon as}} they are cleaned, without scaling, {{skinning}} or <b>filleting.</b> If cooked with the skin on, the meat tends to hold together better. [...] While trout sold commercially in Europe is often prepared and served this way, most trout sold commercially in the U.S. have had heads removed and have been fully or partially deboned and filleted. Medium to heavy bodied white wines, such as chardonnay, sauvignon blanc or pinot gris are typical wine pairings for trout.|$|E
2500|$|Buffeting {{was another}} early {{aerodynamic}} problem. It {{was difficult to}} distinguish from compressibility as both were reported by test pilots as [...] "tail shake". Buffeting came about from airflow disturbances ahead of the tail; the airplane would shake at high speed. Leading edge wing slots were tried as were combinations of <b>filleting</b> between the wing, cockpit and engine nacelles. Air tunnel test number 15 solved the buffeting completely and its fillet solution was fitted to every subsequent P-38 airframe. Fillet kits were sent out to every squadron flying Lightnings. The problem was traced to a 40% increase in air speed at the wing-fuselage junction where the thickness/chord ratio was highest. An airspeed of [...] at [...] could push airflow at the wing-fuselage junction close to the speed of sound. <b>Filleting</b> solved the buffeting problem for the P-38E and later models.|$|E
40|$|In Nile tilapia, {{breeding}} programs focus {{mainly on}} growth, {{and information on}} genetic improvement of <b>fillet</b> yield is scarce. In this study, slaughter data were collected on 1215 tilapia and {{used to analyze the}} relationship between body measurements and <b>fillet</b> weight and <b>fillet</b> yield. Fish were obtained from three different origins/strains, and raised in a commercial farm in the Netherlands in closed recirculation systems until a final mean weight of 700 g. Body weight, length, height, width and corrected (= <b>fillet)</b> length were taken prior to slaughter, and used to predict <b>fillet</b> weight and <b>fillet</b> yield using linear regression models. Average <b>fillet</b> yield was 35. 7 % with large differences between strains (range 34. 4 - 38 %). There was a strong almost linear relationship between body measurements and <b>fillet</b> weight, but relationships with <b>fillet</b> yield were weak. R- 2 of the regression model for <b>fillet</b> weight was 0. 95 and the correlation between observed and predicted values of <b>fillet</b> weight 0. 98. The effect of strain/origin was significant for each body measurement. The effect of sex and strain x sex was significant for length and corrected (= <b>fillet)</b> length. The <b>fillet</b> yield model explained 15 % of the observed variance; the correlation between observed and predicted <b>fillet</b> yield was 0. 38, but there were large differences within strains. We conclude that in Nile tilapia, predicting <b>fillet</b> yield based on body measurements is possible, but correlations can be improved if more accurate methods for measuring body width become available.

30|$|In conclusion, {{total weight}} {{is the best}} single {{measurement}} for predicting <b>fillet</b> weight in Asian sea bass. Regression models developed {{in this study are}} applicable to fish weighing 960 – 1190  g from all populations sampled. Using separate models yielded similar prediction power and accuracy for <b>fillet</b> weight. This study demonstrates the use of various body measurements in predicting <b>fillet</b> yields. Despite relatively weak correlations between body measurements and <b>fillet</b> yields, we were able to develop useful prediction models for <b>fillet</b> yields in three stocks of Asian sea bass. Although <b>fillet</b> yield is the most important trait for fish processors, increased <b>fillet</b> percentages could be achieved along with increased <b>fillet</b> weights, given the positive correlation between the traits. The application of prediction models would allow for rapid genetic improvement via breeding to increase <b>fillet</b> yields and enable producers to be more competitive in the value-added markets of Asian sea bass.|$|R

2500|$|The bluefin {{trevally}} {{is one of}} {{the premier}} gamefish of the Indo-Pacific region, although is often overshadowed by its larger cousin, the giant trevally. The fish makes long powerful runs on light tackle, and is a determined fighter. The species readily accepts both bait and lures, with live fish or squid often used as bait and a variety of lures also used on the species. Lures may include poppers, plugs, spoons, jigs, soft plastic lures and even saltwater flies. The species inshore habits make it a popular target for spearfishermen also. In Hawaii the species has bag and size limit restrictions in place to prevent further overexploitation. It {{is considered to be a}} good to excellent food fish, however many cases of ciguatera poisoning have been attributed to the bluefin trevally. Laboratory tests have confirmed the presence of the toxin in the species flesh, with fish greater than 50cm likely to be a carrier. The risk of poisoning has also affected the sales of the fish in the marketplace in recent years. [...] Also of concern is one report of infection by a dracunculoid parasite while preparing the fish for eating. In this case, the parasite invaded the victim's body by entering an open wound while he was <b>filleting</b> the species, and is believed to be one of the first records for such cross contamination. The bluefin trevally has been successfully kept in large saltwater aquaria, but require large water volumes to adapt well.|$|E
