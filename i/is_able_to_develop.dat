Batman deduces that the restorative properties of Ra's al Ghul's blood can complete the cure and tracks one of his assassins to his underground lair, leading Batman into a confrontation with Ra's and his daughter Talia, Batman's former lover. With Ra's al Ghul's blood, Freeze <b>is</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> an antidote, but it is stolen by Harley Quinn before Batman can use it.

On Earth, {{there have been}} numerous major extinction events that destroyed the majority of complex species alive at the time; the extinction of the dinosaurs is the best known example. These are thought to have been caused by events such as impact from a large meteorite, massive volcanic eruptions, or astronomical events such as gamma-ray bursts. It may be the case that such extinction events are common throughout the universe and periodically destroy intelligent life, or at least its civilizations, before the species <b>is</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> the technology to communicate with other species.|$|E

While there are overt differences in demeanor between Kiki and San from Princess Mononoke, a character who is motivated by anger, both characters take {{control over their own}} lives. This theme of remarkable independence is also seen in Miyazaki's earlier works, such as in Nausicaä in Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind. Kiki is also compared to Chihiro of Spirited Away {{in the sense that they}} are both young girls attempting to seek independence without being rebellious. Chihiro <b>is</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> her independence through her friends and parents, just as Kiki leaves her village with her parents' blessings.|$|E

[...] If a toy is hidden in a matchbox then the matchbox put under a pillow and then, without the child seeing, the toy is slipped out of the matchbox and the matchbox then given to the child, the child will look under the pillow upon discovery that it is not in the matchbox.

2500|$|The High Court {{exercises}} both original jurisdiction (cases that {{originate in}} the High Court) and appellate jurisdiction (appeals made to the High Court from other courts). The High Court is the court of final appeal {{with the ability to}} interpret the common law for the whole of Australia, not just the state or territory in which the matter arose.

60|$|But suppose, for {{the sake}} of argument, that a savage has more brains than seems {{proportioned}} to his wants, all that can be said is that the objection to natural selection, if it be one, applies quite as strongly to the lower animals. The brain of a porpoise is quite wonderful for its mass, and {{for the development of the}} cerebral convolutions. And yet since we have ceased to credit the story of Arion, it is hard to believe that porpoises are much troubled with intellect: and still more difficult is it to imagine that their big brains are only a preparation for the advent of some accomplished cetacean of the future. Surely, again, a wolf must have too much brains, or else how is it that a dog with only the same quantity and form of brain <b>is</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> such singular intelligence? The wolf stands to the dog in the same relation as the savage to the man; and, therefore, if Mr. Wallace's doctrine holds good, a higher power must have superintended the breeding up of wolves from some inferior stock, in order to prepare them to become dogs.|$|E
