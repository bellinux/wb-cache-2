500|$|Countdown to Extinction {{received}} generally {{positive reaction}} from critics.

AllMusic reviewer Steve Huey said that [...] "Megadeth guns for arena thrash success and gets it on Countdown to Extinction". However, Huey noted the simplification of Megadeth's sound on the album in response to Metallica's commercially successful self-titled album released the previous year. Sputnikmusic reviewer Mike Stagno praised Mustaine's vocals {{as well as a}} number of the album's tracks. Despite calling this effort [...] "Megadeth's first step into the world of mainstream music", he also noted that [...] "the band still maintains its identity". Reflex described the sound as [...] "impressively clean, streamlined, and sharp, brimming with killing riffs". They highlighted the vocal delivery on the record, saying [...] "Mustaine's never sounded more confident, verbally and vocally".|$|E

500|$|Both the {{physical}} appearance {{and behavior of}} Henry and Sam were designed to reflect that of Joel and Ellie; the backpack and jeans worn by both duos reflect {{the physical}} resemblance, while the behavioral resemblance was {{in that they are}} both forced to make tough decisions over time. After Brandon Scott was chosen to portray Henry, the team only showed him some artistic sketches of the game, avoiding specific details about the story. Scott enjoyed portraying the character, particularly {{due to the fact that}} he was allowed to introduce elements of his own personality. [...] "You don't have to plan ... because you get to <b>just</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> character," [...] Scott said. He also felt that recording the voice and actions simultaneously was [...] "exciting" [...] and helpful. The team felt that Henry's actions are dedicated to protecting Sam, and that Scott introduced that dedication to the character. Druckmann stated that Henry and Sam's relationship mirrored that of Joel and Ellie's. Ellie was seen by the team as a mentor to Sam. Johnson felt that Sam was [...] "genuinely scared", admiring this significant difference from the game's other characters.|$|E
500|$|Small {{pieces of}} paper were sprayed as snow, which caused a problem as it scared the horses. However, the snow falling from {{the sky was a}} foam substance. The actors who played the dead bodies possessed by the Gelth had simple make-up, with just shading and contact lenses and no prosthetics. The {{production}} team was mindful of the programme's audience, and decided to not have any missing facial features. Originally, visual effects company The Mill planned the computer-generated effects (CGI) to <b>just</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> [...] "ethereal swirl", but in the seance scene they ran into the challenge of animating the Gelth's mouth. The Gelth turning red during the seance scene was a [...] "last-minute" [...] change to the visual effects. The Mill overshot their quota of CGI for the episode, and compensated with small swirls in shots that focused on other characters. The head speaking was in fact actress Zoe Thorne, who had been filmed separately and used as a template for animation. In other scenes, Thorne had the challenge of matching her voice-overs to the actors who portrayed the bodies animated by the Gelth.|$|E
500|$|The Kurt–Blaine relationship, {{sometimes}} referred to by the portmanteau [...] "Klaine" [...] by Glee fans and the media, developed slowly. As the series showrunner, Murphy felt tasked with keeping the two apart as long as possible. He was initially unsure whether the relationship would become a romantic one, and intended to gauge public response to their friendship before planning future developments. He commented, [...] "Part of me thinks he should be the boyfriend, part of me thinks he should <b>just</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> mentor. I didn't want to decide that until we got into sort of {{the middle of the}} season." [...] In December 2010, Colfer said, [...] "Fans really want it to happen. It's funny how many people want to see these boys hook up. We'll see." [...] Based on the characters' chemistry and the [...] "immediate outcry" [...] from fans who wanted to see them as a couple, Murphy decided to have Blaine become Kurt's love interest. Criss noted: [...] "We all want to see Kurt happy, and like all great love stories, if you have two people that can be together you've got to hold it up." ...|$|E

500|$|Strip Me {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 60, which indicates [...] "mixed or average reviews", based on 4 reviews. Mikael Wood of Entertainment Weekly gave Strip Me a C rating and wrote that it [...] "plays like one long, increasingly desperate pep talk. The only breather? 'Unexpected Hero,' a lovely late-Beatles-style ballad." [...] AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted the album for [...] "retaining [...] same blend of well-manicured R and European sophistication" [...] of Bedingfield's debut album and commented that she [...] "plays it exceptionally safe, {{to the extent}} that she even tones down the self-empowerment of her first two records, preferring pristine blue-eyed soul and adult contemporary ballads, all tailored for an aspirational upscale lifestyle". Slant magazine's Jonathon Keefe found it [...] "single-minded in its uplifting, inspirational tone", writing in conclusion that [...] "Bedingfield uses her powerful voice to oversing most of her material, making Strip Me feel like even more of a sermon. It may not be the year's worst pop album, but it might <b>just</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> most exhausting and heavy-handed." ...|$|E
500|$|The band's {{decision}} {{in favor of}} more mature material was received positively by many critics; Tim Newbound of Soul Shine Magazine wrote that [...] "Blink show that they can retain their infectious and endearing qualities while recording music of a more thoughtful calibre." [...] Spin described the record as emotionally intense and best experienced through headphones. USA Today Edna Gundersen felt that [...] "Blink-182 bravely adheres to a single sober theme — a disintegrating romance — through 14 songs that adhere to its pop punk principles without recycling cartoonish accessories. Blink-182 is growing up, not growing stale." [...] Nick Catucci of The Village Voice called the album [...] "brilliant" [...] and compared Blink-182 to fellow pop punk band Green Day's 2000 effort, Warning, writing, [...] "Let it be noted, however, that Warning searches for subject matter where Blink-182 searches for meaning." [...] Greg Kot of Entertainment Weekly wrote that [...] "Despite their newfound earnestness, [...] seem incapable of pretension. And in a career littered with songs about awkward moments, their latest is a dork classic." [...] Scott Shelter of Slant gave the album four stars, stating [...] "Giving up the fart jokes is risky business for Blink—but Blink-182 might <b>just</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> band's best album to date." [...] Among the more negative reviews, Jason Arnopp of Q felt the majority of material forgettable but commended it as [...] "some of their most imaginatively constructed work." [...] The A.V. Club Stephen Thompson believed [...] "The disc [...] meander in spots, and its most achingly sincere love songs become cloying." ...|$|E
500|$|Before {{production}} {{on the second}} season began, Murphy confirmed that Kurt would be paired with a new romantic interest. According to Chord Overstreet, his character Sam Evans was originally intended to become Kurt's love interest. However, Sam's storyline was later adjusted to pair him with glee club member Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron) after producers observed the chemistry between Overstreet and Agron. Kurt was subsequently paired with another new character, Blaine Anderson, {{a member of the}} rival show choir group the Dalton Academy Warblers, who is initially a mentor for Kurt. Murphy was unsure at first whether their relationship would become a romantic one, and stated that he wished to gauge public response to their friendship before planning future developments. He commented, [...] "Part of me thinks he should be the boyfriend, part of me thinks he should <b>just</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> mentor. I didn't want to decide that until we got into sort of the middle of the season." [...] Kurt transfers from McKinley High to Dalton Academy and falls in love with Blaine, though Blaine only considers him a close friend. However, when Kurt sings the Beatles song [...] "Blackbird" [...] in [...] "Original Song", Blaine finally realizes his true feelings and the two kiss, marking the start of the relationship. Criss noted, [...] "We all want to see Kurt happy, and like all great love stories, if you have two people that can be together you've got to hold it up." [...] When imagining Blaine and Kurt's potential future together, Murphy expected to treat them the same as all other Glee relationships by making their pairing [...] "as flawed and as exposed as everyone else's." [...] This plan was confirmed by Falchuk after the characters kissed for the first time, though he later clarified: [...] "They're solid. They have problems—you have two stars dating each other, there's going to be some competition there." [...] In the second-season finale, they each tell the other, [...] "I love you", and early in the third season they decide to have sex for the first time. The Kurt–Blaine relationship has been well received by critics, and they were named [...] "one of the most beloved TV couples of the millennium" [...] late in the second season by Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post.|$|E
