25|$|It {{appears that}} Ragnarök is {{depicted}} on the Ledberg stone in Östergötland. On {{one of its}} sides it shows a large warrior with a helmet, and who is bitten at his feet by a beast. This beast is, it is presumed, Fenrir, {{the brother of the}} Midgard Serpent, and who is attacking Odin. On the bottom of the illustration, there is a prostrate man who is <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> hands and who has no legs. There is a close parallel from an illustration at Kirk Douglas on the Isle of Man. The Manx illustration shows Odin with a spear and with one of his ravens on his shoulders, and Odin is attacked {{in the same way as}} he is on the Ledberg stone. Adding to the stone's spiritual content is a magic formula that was known all across the world of the pagan Norsemen.|$|E
500|$|De Winter was {{immediately}} taken to see Duncan, the Dutch officer <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> sword as {{a token of}} surrender. Duncan refused the weapon, instead shaking De Winter's hand and insisting [...] "I would much rather take a brave man's hand than his sword". In addition to the losses in the rear, five ships of the Dutch van had been captured {{as well as the}} frigate Ambuscade that had attacked from the second line. The remainder of the Dutch ships had fled, making rapid progress towards the coastal shallows. Duncan did not follow them: the Dutch coast between Kamperduin and Egmond was only [...] away, his ship lay in just 9 fathoms (...) of water and the weather was too fierce and his ships too battered to risk combat in shoal waters. Instead he ordered his ships to ensure control of their prizes and to return to Britain. Many ships were now undermanned due to the terrible casualties they had suffered: surgeon Robert Young of Ardent, the worst hit of the British ships, worked for more than twelve hours without a break and later wrote: ...|$|E
500|$|Conscience was {{a factor}} in Peter Galbraith's {{criticism}} of fraud in the 2009 Afghanistan election despite it costing him his United Nations job. Conscience motivated Bunnatine Greenhouse to expose irregularities in the contracting of the Halliburton company for work in Iraq. Naji al-Ali a popular cartoon artist in the Arab world, loved for his defense of the ordinary people, and for his criticism of repression and despotism by both the Israeli military and Yasser Arafat's PLO, was murdered for refusing to compromise with his conscience. The journalist Anna Politkovskaya provided (prior to her murder) an example of conscience in her opposition to the Second Chechen War and then-Russian President Vladimir Putin. Conscience motivated the Russian human-rights activist Natalia Estemirova, who was abducted and murdered in Grozny, Chechnya in 2009. The Death of Neda Agha-Soltan arose from conscience-driven protests against the 2009 Iranian presidential election. Female Muslim lawyer Shirin Ebadi (winner of the 2003 Nobel Peace Prize) has been described as the 'conscience of the Islamic Republic' for her work in protecting the human rights of women and children in Iran. The human rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng, {{often referred to as the}} 'conscience of China' and who had previously been arrested and allegedly tortured by the Chinese regime for defending members of the Falun Gong, was abducted by Chinese security agents on 4 February 2009 and has not been seen since. 2010 Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo in his final statement before being sentenced by a closed Chinese court to over a decade in jail as a political prisoner of conscience stated: [...] "For hatred is corrosive of a person’s wisdom and conscience; the mentality of enmity can poison a nation’s spirit." [...] Sergei Magnitsky, a lawyer in Russia, was arrested, held without trial for almost a year and died in custody, as a result of exposing corruption. On 6 October 2001 Laura Whittle was a naval gunner on HMAS Adelaide (FFG 01) under orders to implement a new border protection policy when they encountered the SIEV-4 (Suspected Illegal Entry Vessel-4) refugee boat in choppy seas. After being ordered to fire warning shots from her 50 calibre machinegun to make the boat turn back she saw it beginning to break up and sink with a father on board <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> young daughter that she might be saved (see Children Overboard Affair). Whittle jumped without a life vest 12 metres into the sea to help save the refugees from drowning thinking [...] "this isn't right; this isn't how things should be." [...] In February 2012 journalist Marie Colvin was deliberately targeted and killed by the Syrian Army [...] in Homs during the 2011–2012 Syrian uprising and Siege of Homs, after she decided to stay at the [...] "epicentre of the storm" [...] in order to [...] "expose what is happening." [...] In October 2012 the Taliban organised the attempted murder of Malala Yousafzai a teenage girl who had been campaigning, despite their threats, for female education in Pakistan. In December 2012 the 2012 Delhi gang rape case was said to have stirred the collective conscience of India to civil disobedience and public protest at the lack of legal action against rapists in that country (see Rape in India) In June 2013 Edward Snowden revealed details of a US National Security Agency internet and electronic communication PRISM (surveillance program) because of a conscience-felt obligation to the freedom of humanity greater than obedience to the laws that bound his employment.|$|E

2500|$|Len Hutton, born in June 1916, {{was still}} short of his 19th {{birthday}} {{when he and}} Sutcliffe opened together against Kent at Park Avenue, Bradford, on Saturday, 1 June 1935. [...] On a difficult, turning wicket, they had to face Kent's great leg spinner Tich Freeman (who took 13 wickets in the match) and managed to put on 70 together before Yorkshire collapsed to an all out 131, leaving Kent with a first innings lead of 51. [...] Kent extended that lead on the Monday morning to 191 and Yorkshire, faced with a sticky wicket after heavy overnight rain, were not expected to win. [...] Thanks to an obdurate and watchful innings by Sutcliffe, who made an outstanding 110, they did win by two wickets. [...] Sutcliffe scored so slowly at times {{that some of his}} own supporters began to complain but Sutcliffe silenced them, after finally taking a single, by <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> bat and inviting them to come and do better. [...] It was humorously done and the crowd laughed. [...] Sutcliffe had a good sense of humour but rarely showed it when batting, which he regarded as altogether too serious a business for jest.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the time}} when Antiochus {{approached}} Ptolemy and meant to occupy Pelusium, Caius Popilius Laenas, the Roman commander, on Antiochus greeting him from a distance and then <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> hand, handed to the king, as he had it by him, the copy of the senatus-consultum, {{and told him to}} read it first, not thinking it proper, as it seems to me, to make the conventional sign of friendship before he knew if the intentions of him who was greeting him were friendly or hostile. But when the king, after reading it, {{said he would like to}} communicate with his friends about this intelligence, Popilius acted in a manner which was thought to be offensive and exceedingly arrogant. He was carrying a stick cut from a vine, and with this he drew a circle round Antiochus and told him he must remain inside this circle until he gave his decision about the contents of the letter. The king was astonished at this authoritative proceeding, but, after a few moments' hesitation, said he would do all that the Romans demanded. Upon this Popilius and his suite all grasped him by the hand and greeted him warmly. The letter ordered him to put an end at once to the war with Ptolemy. So, as a fixed number of days were allowed to him, he led his army back to Syria, deeply hurt and complaining indeed, but yielding to circumstances for the present. Popilius after arranging matters in Alexandria and exhorting the two kings there to act in common, ordering them also to send Polyaratus to Rome, sailed for Cyprus, wishing to lose no time in expelling the Syrian troops that were in the island. When they arrived, finding that Ptolemy's generals had been defeated and that the affairs of Cyprus were generally in a topsy-turvy state, they soon made the Syrian army retire from the country, and waited until the troops took ship for Syria. In this way the Romans saved the kingdom of Ptolemy, which had almost been crushed out of existence: Fortune having so directed the matter of Perseus and Macedonia that when the position of Alexandria and the whole of Egypt was almost desperate, all was again set right simply owing to the fact that the fate of Perseus had been decided. For had this not been so, and had not Antiochus been certain of it, he would never, I think, have obeyed the Roman behests.
