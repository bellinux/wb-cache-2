25|$|In <b>heteroecious</b> species, the aphids spend winter on tree or bush primary hosts; in summer, they {{migrate to}} their {{secondary}} host on a herbaceous plant, then the gynoparae {{return to the}} tree in autumn. The pea aphid has a primary host of a perennial vetch and secondary of the annual pea. This is likely due to the decline of food quality in trees during the summer, as well as overcrowding amongst aphids which they sense when they bump into each other too often. The <b>heteroecious</b> life cycle (which is mainly linked to consumption of angiosperms and represents 10% of all aphids) {{is believed to have}} evolved from the ancestral autoecious form (on conifers); this is believed to have reverted to the ancestral form in some species that were once <b>heteroecious.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Telial {{stage is}} one of the stages in the life cycle of a {{parasitic}} <b>heteroecious</b> fungus. It is discernible by the formation of large teliospores that the fungi produces to overwinter. The telial stage of <b>heteroecious</b> parasitic fungi is spent on the secondary host plant. A primary aecial stage is spent parasitizing a separate host plant which is a precursor in the life cycle of <b>heteroecious</b> fungi. Spores are released from the telia in the spring. The spores can spread many kilometers through the air, however most are spread near the host plant (Brand, 2004).|$|E

50|$|A <b>heteroecious</b> {{parasite}} is {{one that}} requires at least two hosts. The primary host is the host in which the parasite spends its adult life; {{the other is the}} secondary host. Both the primary host and an unrelated alternate host are required for the parasite to complete its life cycle. This can be contrasted with an autoecious parasite which can complete its life cycle on a single host species. Many rust fungi are prime examples of a <b>heteroecious</b> life cycle.|$|E
50|$|He is {{particularly}} known for Tranzschel's Law, that states that telia of microcyclic species of rust fungi that are descendants of macrocyclic, <b>heteroecious</b> rusts simulate aecia of the ancestral macrocyclic rust and {{occur on the}} aecial host of the latter. Tranzschel devised his law to assists in identification of the aecial host of a suspected <b>heteroecious</b> rust by looking for hosts attacked by a microcyclic rust with morphologically similar telia to the former.
