Nat. 140, 477 - 491) {{presented}} {{a model that}} predicts optimal departure <b>fuel</b> <b>loads</b> {{as a function of}} the rate of fuel deposition in time-minimizing migrants. The basis of the model is that the coverable distance per unit of fuel deposited, diminishes with increasing <b>fuel</b> <b>load.</b> This is an effect of the increasing flight costs associated with increasing body mass. Lindstrom & Alerstam (1992) found that birds left at lower <b>fuel</b> <b>loads</b> than their model predicted for which they considered various ecological explanations. Alternatively, we hypothesize that the difference between prediction and empirical data might be a result of extra resting metabolic and transport costs associated with an increase in <b>fuel</b> <b>load</b> during stopover. We develop a new version of the Lindstrom & Alerstam (1992) model taking <b>fuel</b> <b>load</b> associated costs during stopover into account.

2500|$|In a {{paper by}} the United States Department of Homeland Security {{finalized}} in 2010, fire experts stated {{that due to}} the nature of modern city design and construction, with the US serving as an example, a firestorm is unlikely after a nuclear detonation in a modern city. This is not to say that fires won't occur over a large area after a detonation, but rather that the fires would not coalesce and form the stratospheric firestorm plume that the nuclear winter papers require in their climate computer models. The nuclear bombing of Nagasaki for example, did not produce a firestorm. This was similarly noted as early as 1986–88, when the assumed quantity of fuel [...] "mass loading" [...] (the amount of fuel per square meter) in cities underpinning the winter models was found to be too high and intentionally creates heat fluxes that loft smoke into the lower stratosphere, yet assessments [...] "more characteristic of conditions" [...] to be found in real-world modern cities, had found that the <b>fuel</b> <b>loading,</b> and hence the heat flux that would result from efficient burning, would rarely loft smoke much higher than 4km.|$|E
2500|$|The John Day/Clarno Highlands {{ecoregion}} {{is characterized}} by moderately to highly dissected hills and low mountains that are uniformly covered by Western ponderosa pine forest with a grass and shrub understory. Elevation varies from 3,000to6,200feet (914to1,990m). The region includes broad streams fed more by springs than by snow melt. The continental climate is tempered by a marine influence; {{it is not as}} dry, nor are temperature extremes as great, as in the Continental Zone Highlands. Historically, frequent low intensity wildfires reduced <b>fuel</b> <b>loading</b> in forests of widely spaced old-growth ponderosa pine. Today, after years of fire suppression and high grade logging, land managers attempt to emulate historical fire regimes to reverse the trend toward dense thickets of young growth that carry hot, stand-replacing fires. Potential vegetation is mostly open ponderosa pine, with some Douglas-fir, western juniper, mountain-mahogany, snowberry, mountain big sagebrush, elk sedge, Idaho fescue, and bluebunch wheatgrass. Riparian areas support grand fir, mountain alder, red-twig dogwood, ninebark, Wood's rose, Rocky Mountain maple, and willows.

Current methods used to predict <b>fuel</b> <b>loads</b> often rely on course-scale vegetation maps and simple time-since-fire relationships which mask fine-scale processes influencing <b>fuel</b> <b>loads.</b> Here we use Light Detecting and Remote Sensing technology (LiDAR) and field surveys to quantify post-fire mid-story and crown canopy fuel accumulation and fire hazard in Dry Sclerophyll Forests of the Sydney Basin (Australia) at fine spatial-scales (20 × 20 m cell resolution). Fuel cover was quantified in three strata important for crown fire propagation (0. 5 - 4 m, 4 - 15 m, 3 ̆e 15 m) over a 144 km 2 area subject to varying fire fuel ages. Our results show that 1) LiDAR provided a precise measurement of fuel cover in each strata and a less precise but still useful predictor of surface fuels, 2) cover varied greatly within a mapped vegetation class of the same fuel age, particularly for elevated fuel, 3) time-since-fire was a poor predictor of fuel cover and crown fire hazard because <b>fuel</b> <b>loads</b> important for crown fire propagation were variable over a range of fire fuel ages between 2 and 38 years post-fire, and 4) <b>fuel</b> <b>loads</b> and fire hazard can be high in the years immediately following fire.

30|$|Characterizing spatial {{patterns}} of fire behavior {{is an important}} and rarely considered means of understanding {{patterns of}} vegetation recovery following a fire event. Using geostatistics, we characterized spatial patterns of pre-burn <b>fuel</b> <b>loads,</b> fire temperature and duration during prescribed burns, and post-burn <b>fuel</b> <b>loads</b> in four longleaf pine stands in the southeastern USA. Fire temperatures exhibited moderate to strong spatial dependence over medium spatial scales. Variograms suggest that 61 – 99 % of sample population variance was spatially dependent at scales of 27 – 157 m. Patterns of pre-burn <b>fuel</b> <b>loads</b> were only moderately related to patterns of mean fire temperature, confirming that <b>fuel</b> <b>loads</b> alone cannot predict fire patchiness. Other fuel parameters and microscale changes in wind and relative humidity likely influenced patterns of fire intensity as well. Strength and scale of <b>fuel</b> <b>load</b> spatial patterns were altered by fire as indicated by pre- and post-burn measurements. Spatial analysis provides a useful way to quantify burn patchiness and can help to identify which patch size may be desirable for different management goals. Studies that examine fire effects need to recognize spatial autocorrelation when characterizing fire behavior and account for this variation at appropriate scales.|$|R
40|$|<b>Fuel</b> <b>loads</b> {{in forest}} areas are {{dependent}} on vegetation type and the time since the last fire. This paper reports {{a study on the}} feasibility of using remotely sensed data to estimate vegetative <b>fuel</b> <b>loads.</b> It describes two methods for estimating <b>fuel</b> <b>loads</b> using Landsat TM data based on equations describing litter accumulation and decomposition. The first method uses classification techniques to predict vegetation types coupled with fire history data to derive current <b>fuel</b> <b>loads.</b> The second method applies a canopy turnover rate to estimate litterfall and subsequently accumulated litter from biomass, thus utilising the dominant influence of canopy on remotely sensed data. Both methods are compared with data collected from Popran National Park in coastal New South Wales. The amounts of litter calculated with the biomass method were similar to field results, but the classification method was found to overestimate <b>fuel</b> <b>loads.</b> A sensitivity analysis investigated the impact of varying the vegetation constants and rates used in the fuel estimates to simulate uncertainty or error in their values.

30|$|Fire {{temperature}} during four low-intensity surface {{fires in}} longleaf pine forest was spatially dependent and varied significantly over medium scales (27 – 157 m). Notably, the specific range of this spatial pattern (patch size) was not consistent, even among fires occurring in relatively similar fuel conditions and burned under similar weather conditions. Patterns of pre-burn <b>fuel</b> <b>loads</b> were only moderately related to patterns of mean fire temperature. Incorporating additional fuel parameters (e.g., fuel moisture) and microscale changes in wind and relative humidity may have explained {{the pattern of}} fire temperatures more completely. Prescribed burns altered the strength and scale of <b>fuel</b> <b>load</b> spatial patterns from pre- to post-burn. However, the pattern of post-burn <b>fuels</b> <b>loads</b> could not be predicted based on fire temperatures or pre-burn <b>fuel</b> <b>loads</b> alone.

40|$|AbstractAtmospheric {{composition}} is {{strongly influenced by}} wildfire emissions, which have a strong variability over time and space. Estimates of fire emissions on large scale {{are based on a}} combination of burned area, combustion completeness, and <b>fuel</b> <b>load.</b> Approaches differ in the derivation of this information, which involves models and observations to different degrees. Due to the lack of highly spatially and temporally resolved observations the variability of <b>fuel</b> <b>load</b> is often not fully taken into account. The <b>fuel</b> <b>load</b> can differ between seasons due to variations in the vegetation productivity, decomposition rates and fire occurrence. On the longer time scale the effect of CO 2 fertilization is expected to influence the vegetation productivity and therefore overall <b>fuel</b> <b>load</b> abundance. All these processes are accounted for in land carbon cycle models. We use the land surface and vegetation model JSBACH as a tool to understand the influence of <b>fuel</b> <b>load</b> seasonality, <b>fuel</b> <b>load</b> variability within land cover types and CO 2 fertilization on fire occurrence and wildfire emissions. We find that using the mean <b>fuel</b> <b>load</b> over time for each grid cell instead of seasonally varying fuels leads to comparable burned area and emissions (only 3 % deviations from the reference). Using minimum or maximum values, however, leads to strong under (0. 54 times the reference) and overestimation (1. 85 times the reference) of the emissions. When using constant <b>fuel</b> <b>load</b> for each vegetation type strong regionally varying, over and underestimations of emissions are found. Over the 20 th century CO 2 fertilization strongly impacts fuel availability. As a consequence, burned area and carbon emissions are almost 20 and 40 % higher at present day. In general, our results confirm the applicability of time constant <b>fuel</b> <b>loads</b> in emission estimation methods for present day, as the seasonality is of minor importance. However, we suggest that considering the variability of fuel driven by climate variability in space can improve the estimates. This result is in line with a number of studies highlighting the importance of fuel limitation for the occurrence of fire. On the longer time scale the influence of CO 2 fertilization is not negligible according to our results, but high uncertainties in the understanding of the process increases the difficulty to account for it in fire carbon emission approaches. This assessment of potential errors in fire emission datasets should help to further improve approaches to estimate fire emissions and to interpret available datasets and differences between them...|$|R
