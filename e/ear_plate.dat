5000|$|The green sunfish is blue-green {{in color}} {{on its back}} and sides with yellow-flecked bony-ridged (ctenoid) scales, as well as yellow {{coloration}} on the ventral sides. They also have a dark spot located near {{the back end of}} the dorsal fin, the bases of the anal fins. and on the <b>ear</b> <b>plate.</b> It has a relatively big mouth and long snout that extends to beneath the middle of the eye. [...] Its pectoral fins are short with rounded edges containing 13-14 pectoral fin rays, a dorsal fin with about 10 dorsal spines and a homocercal tail. The typical length ranges from about 3-7 in and usually weighs less than a pound. The green sunfish reaches a maximum recorded length of about 30 cm (12 in), with a maximum recorded weight of 960 g (2.2 lb). Identification of sunfish species from one another can sometimes be difficult as these species frequently hybridize.|$|E
5000|$|Soap bar casing has true {{rectangular}} {{shape and}} the mounting screws are {{contained within the}} coil perimeter, positioned between the pole pieces, between {{the second and third}} strings and between the fourth and fifth strings, thus creating an irregular and somewhat unusual pattern. Occasionally they are mistaken for pole pieces, thus sometimes the P-90 is erroneously said to have eight pole pieces. The [...] "soap bar" [...] nickname most probably comes from its predominantly rectangular shape and proportions, {{and the fact that the}} first P-90s on the original Gibson Les Paul Model of 1952 were white. A variant of the Soap-Bar P-90 is one, which uses the [...] "dog ear" [...] mounting plate, or frame, but the [...] "soap bar" [...] cover. The reason for the variation was to mount the pickup from a flat overlaying pickguard, such as is found on the Gibson SG Special (and other SG guitars using P-90's). The [...] "dog ear" [...] mounting plate is fitted with screws and springs, that attach it to the flat pickguard and allow the pickup to hang within the body rout. The soap bar cover is used, and the soap bar mounting screws are used to affix the cover to the dog <b>ear</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In the {{traditional}} {{design of the}} working equipment of the hydraulic excavator, its stress distribution was almost determined by adopting the static calculation method, and then its strength was ensured by selecting the safety factor, which is not fully considered because of the dynamic stresses resulting from shocks and vibrations in the operating process of the hydraulic excavator. Based on the finite element analysis software ANSYS, the 3 D models of the main components (boom and bucket rod) of the working equipment for certain type of hydraulic excavator were analyzed. The inherent frequency and the main vibration mode were analyzed by extracting the first 6 -th order modal. The research results show that {{with the increase of}} modal order, the vibrating mode form increased in complexity. The first and the second orders vibrating mode can be both a linear bending deformation or muster within a certain plane individually. From the beginning of the third order, the model deflection begins to become a mutual coupling complex vibrating type which showed multiple orders of bending and torsion deformation. The maximum deflection of boom is concentrated near the <b>ear</b> <b>plate</b> as well as the hinge point connected with boom and oil cylinder. On the other sides, the maximum deflection of bucket rod is concentrated on its middle part. i. e. between the hinge joints of rocker and the <b>ear</b> <b>plate</b> as well as near the rear supporting plate. Therefore, in order to ensure strength and working safety of the working equipment, it is necessary to improve the structure of the maximum deformation. The Modal analysis provides important modal parameters for the corresponding analysis of the boom and bucket rod of the working equipment in hydraulic excavator, and provides a basi...|$|E

5|$|The {{function}} of Stegosaurus plates {{has been much}} debated. Initially thought of as some form of armor, {{they appear to have}} been too fragile and ill-placed for defensive purposes, leaving the animal's sides unprotected. The plates' large size suggests that they may have served to increase the apparent height of the animal, either to intimidate enemies or to impress other members of the same species, in some form of sexual display, although both male and female specimens seemed to have had the same plates. More recently, researchers have proposed that they may have helped to control the body temperature of the animal, in a similar way to the sails of the pelycosaurs Dimetrodon and Edaphosaurus (and modern elephant and rabbit <b>ears).</b> The <b>plates</b> had blood vessels running through grooves and air flowing around the plates would have cooled the blood.|$|R
40|$|Background: Chronic {{suppurative}} {{otitis media}} (CSOM) is a prevailing and notorious infection {{in developing countries}} causing serious local damage and threatening complications. Early and effective treatment based on the knowledge of causing micro organisms and their sensitivity results in good clinical recovery and prevents from damage and complications. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is most common pathogen causing CSOM in Pakistan. The objective {{of this study is}} to identify incidence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa involved in CSOM and sensitivity against commonly prescribed antibiotics. Methods: A total of 263 patients with unilateral or bilateral chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) were enrolled in the study at Department of ENT, Karachi Medical and Dental College & Abbasi Shaheed Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan from December 2004 to May 2006. Sterile cotton swabs were used to collect pus from discharging <b>ears</b> and <b>plated</b> on Blood agar and MacConkey agar for 24 to 48 hours. Antibiotics susceptibility was tested by Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) method using Mueller-Hinton agar. Results: Overall microbiology of 267 samples from 263 patients was studied including 4 of bilateral discharge. Polymicrobial growth was present in 8 samples. A total of 275 bacterial isolates were studied. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (40 %) and Staphylococcus aureus (30. 9 %) were the most common bacterial agents found in CSOM.

Characteristic feature,it is developed upon the kinematics and nodal degrees of freedom of a first-order,sh <b>ear</b> deformation parent <b>plate</b> element wherein strain energy is updated to incorporate the energy contributions brought by the zig-zag model. This allows to overcome the C 1 continuity requirement resulting from enforcement of the transverse shear stress continuity at the interfaces. The element is implemented in a finite element code for damage simulation and used for investigating low velocity impact-induced damage in laminated composite panels with I and O stiffeners. The impact load is computed by the Hertz's contact law,where the dynamic equations are integrated by the Newmark's algorithm. Local damage extent and position across the thickness are predicted using several classical semi-empirical strength-based criteria,whi le degradation is simulated by reducing the stiffness of damaged plies. The damage extent and thickness position by present finite element simulation appears rather accurate when confronted with ultrasonic inspection and cost effective...|$|R

They are born as small, elf-like creatures (imps) with grey skin, stubby tails, {{while some of the}} warlocks have reddish runes on their heads and bodies. In the species, warlocks never {{transform}} into demons and remain in their imp form their entire lives, though they make up for this by having the most powerful magic of all fairy warlocks. This power allows demons to make time-travel possible, turn objects to stone, and even effortlessly remove the ancient fairy hex that had stripped the magic of all fairies who entered human dwellings without invitation, something other warlocks had been struggling to do for centuries. Other imps, when they achieve a certain level of bloodlust, transform through a cocoon process called [...] "warping" [...] into large beasts (demons) with horns, pointed <b>ears,</b> tough <b>plates</b> on their skin, and extreme physical strength. The warping is the end of any magic a demon {{may or may not have}} possessed. As of the great battle between the humans and fairies, they have resided on a moon-rock island floating in a space in which time doesn't exist. Since the [...] time-spell was cast, the pack leader was Leon Abbot, who controlled the pack's council through magic he acquired in the time tunnel between Earth and their island of Hybras. Demons are the eighth of the fairy families.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Congenital {{causes of}} hearing loss in {{children}} commonly are encountered, and imaging aids in diagnosis {{as well as}} presurgical evaluation. Atresia of the oval window not associated with atresia of {{the external auditory canal}} (EAC) is a rare cause of congenital hearing loss in children. We present the clinical and imaging findings in children with isolated oval-window atresia. METHODS: Atresia of the oval window was defined as the absence of the structure with the presence of a bony plate superimposed between the vestibule and middle <b>ear.</b> The bony <b>plate</b> is within the expected region of the oval window. Using a computerized database, nine patients with isolated oval-window atresia were found. All had been evaluated with high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and all had medical records available for review, including audiogram results. Imaging studies were interpreted by the consensus of two pediatric neuroradiologists. RESULTS: Atresia of the oval window was documented in all cases using HRCT criteria. The most common anomalies associated with oval-window atresia were inferomedial malposi-tion of the facial nerve (n 5 8), malformed incus (n 5 6), and displaced stapes (n 5 2). Fou...|$|R
40|$|The most {{important}} {{outcome of this}} project was the development and realization of the Tuebingen titanium middle ear prostheses. They show a considerable improvement {{in comparison to the}} state of the art. These prostheses are made for patients with conductive hearing loss caused by mechanical defects of the impedance matching ossicular chain. Two types of prostheses were developed. The totally ossicular replacement prosthesis (TORP) is able to replace the complete missing ossicular chain between ear drum and stapedial footplate. Patients with a partial ossicular defect - e. g. a missing incus body - can be provided with a partially ossicular replacement prosthesis (PORP). Usually this PORP will be placed on the stapes head during operation. The impedance matching ability of the reconstructed middle ear depends on mass, stiffness and absorption properties of the implant material and the implant geometry. All available data concerning biocompatible middle ear implant materials and conventional passive middle ear prostheses were investigated during this project. In the group of implantable metals pure titanium is at present the most promising candidate due to its stiffness and density. Since decades, the columella shape, like the single ossicle chain of vertebrates, proved to be the most accepted geometry for middle ear prostheses. The main goal of this development was the realization of a very light and delicate implant. Conventional middle ear prostheses have a solid top plate as contact interface to the <b>ear</b> drum. This <b>plate</b> does not allow the surgeon to see the stapes footplate or the stapes head during implantation. In contrast, the new prostheses are very stiff and 'transparent'. They are class IIb implants according to the medical device directive and CE marked. Our titanium prosteses have been implanted in a clinical study in 114 patients and compared to conventional prostheses made of ceramics (43 implantations) and fine gold (59 implantations). The audiologic findings are promising and demonstrate the advantage of the new developed TORP and PORP. The Tuebingen titanium prostheses are the lightest middle ear implants at all. The TORP version with a length between 3, 0 and 7, 0 mm weighs 4, 1 mg, the PORP version (1. 75 to 4, 0 mm length) only 3. 9 mg. During this project, more than 2. 000 Tuebingen titanium prostheses were manufactured by KURZ GmbH, Tuebingen, Germany and sucessfully implanted. (orig.)
