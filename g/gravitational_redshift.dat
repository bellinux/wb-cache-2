Tests in stronger gravitational fields are provided by the observation of binary pulsars. All results are in agreement with general relativity. However, at the current level of accuracy, these observations cannot distinguish between general relativity and other theories in which the equivalence principle is valid.|$|E

5|$|Some {{predictions}} {{of general relativity}} differ significantly from those of classical physics, especially concerning the passage of time, the geometry of space, the motion of bodies in free fall, and the propagation of light. Examples of such differences include gravitational time dilation, gravitational lensing, the <b>gravitational</b> <b>redshift</b> of light, and the gravitational time delay. The {{predictions of}} general relativity have been confirmed in all observations and experiments to date. Although general relativity {{is not the only}} relativistic theory of gravity, it is the simplest theory that is consistent with experimental data. However, unanswered questions remain, the most fundamental being how general relativity can be reconciled with the laws of quantum physics to produce a complete and self-consistent theory of quantum gravity.|$|E
5|$|A priori, it is {{not clear}} whether the new local frames in free fall {{coincide}} with the reference frames in which the laws of special relativity hold—that theory is based on the propagation of light, and thus on electromagnetism, which could have a different set of preferred frames. But using different assumptions about the special-relativistic frames (such as their being earth-fixed, or in free fall), one can derive different predictions for the <b>gravitational</b> <b>redshift,</b> that is, the way in which the frequency of light shifts as the light propagates through a gravitational field (cf. below). The actual measurements show that free-falling frames are the ones in which light propagates as it does in special relativity. The generalization of this statement, namely that the laws of special relativity hold to good approximation in freely falling (and non-rotating) reference frames, is known as the Einstein equivalence principle, a crucial guiding principle for generalizing special-relativistic physics to include gravity.|$|E
5|$|Some redshifts are {{an example}} of the Doppler effect, {{familiar}} in the change of apparent pitches of sirens and frequency of the sound waves emitted by speeding vehicles. A redshift occurs whenever a light source moves away from an observer. A special instance of this is the cosmological redshift, which is due to the expansion of the universe, and sufficiently distant light sources (generally more than a few million light years away) show redshift corresponding to the rate of increase in their distance from Earth. Finally, <b>gravitational</b> <b>redshift</b> is a relativistic effect observed in electromagnetic radiation moving out of gravitational fields. Conversely, a decrease in wavelength is called blueshift and is generally seen when a light-emitting object moves toward an observer or when electromagnetic radiation moves into a gravitational field. However, redshift is a more common term and sometimes blueshift is referred to as negative redshift.|$|E

25|$|Einstein {{predicted}} the <b>gravitational</b> <b>redshift</b> {{of light from}} the equivalence principle in 1907, and it was predicted that this effect might be measured in the spectral lines of a white dwarf star, which has a very high gravitational field. Initial attempts to measure the <b>gravitational</b> <b>redshift</b> of the spectrum of Sirius-B, were done by Walter Sydney Adams in 1925, but the result was criticized as being unusable due to the contamination from light from the (much brighter) primary star, Sirius. The first accurate measurement of the <b>gravitational</b> <b>redshift</b> of a white dwarf was done by Popper in 1954, measuring a 21km/sec <b>gravitational</b> <b>redshift</b> of 40 Eridani B.|$|E

40|$|A general {{physical}} {{mechanism of}} the formation of line-driven winds at the vicinity of strong gravitational field sources is investigated in the frame of General Relativity. We argue that <b>gravitational</b> <b>redshifting</b> should be taken into account to model such outflows. The generalization of the Sobolev approximation in the frame of General Relativity is presented. We consider all processes in the metric of a nonrotating (Schwarzschild) black hole. The radiation force that is due to absorbtion of the radiation flux in lines is derived. It is demonstrated that if <b>gravitational</b> <b>redshifting</b> is taken into account, the radiation force becomes a function of the local velocity gradient (as in the standard line-driven wind theory) and the gradient of $g_{ 00 }$. We derive a general relativistic equation of motion describing such flow. A solution of the equation of motion is obtained and confronted with that obtained from the Castor, Abbott & Klein (CAK) theory. It is shown that the proposed mechanism could have an important contribution to the formation of line-driven outflows from compact objects. Comment: 20 pages, submitted to Ap...|$|R
40|$|Most of the X-ray {{emission}} from luminous accreting {{black holes}} emerges from within 20 gravitational radii. The effective emission radius is several times smaller if {{the black hole}} is rapidly spinning. General Relativistic effects can then be very important. Large spacetime curvature causes strong lightbending and large <b>gravitational</b> <b>redshifts.</b> The hard X-ray, power-law-emitting corona irradiates the accretion disc generating an X-ray reflection component. Atomic features in the reflection spectrum allow <b>gravitational</b> <b>redshifts</b> to be measured. Time delays between observed variations in the power-law and the reflection spectrum (reverberation) enable the physical scale of the reflecting region to be determined. The relative strength of the reflection and power-law continuum depends on light bending. All of these observed effects enable the immediate environment of the black hole where the effects of General Relativity are on display to be probed and explored.

25|$|In 1917, several astronomers {{accepted}} Einstein's 1911 {{challenge from}} Prague.

25|$|Although the Global Positioning System (GPS) is not {{designed}} {{as a test of}} fundamental physics, it must account for the <b>gravitational</b> <b>redshift</b> in its timing system, and physicists have analyzed timing data from the GPS to confirm other tests. When the first satellite was launched, some engineers resisted the prediction that a noticeable gravitational time dilation would occur, so the first satellite was launched without the clock adjustment that was later built into subsequent satellites. It showed the predicted shift of 38 microseconds per day. This rate of discrepancy is sufficient to substantially impair function of GPS within hours if not accounted for. An excellent account of the role played by general relativity in the design of GPS can be found in Ashby 2003.|$|E
25|$|Experimental {{verification}} of <b>gravitational</b> <b>redshift</b> using terrestrial sources took several decades, {{because it is}} difficult to find clocks (to measure time dilation) or sources of electromagnetic radiation (to measure redshift) with a frequency that is known well enough that the effect can be accurately measured. It was confirmed experimentally {{for the first time in}} 1959 using measurements of the change in wavelength of gamma-ray photons generated with the Mössbauer effect, which generates radiation with a very narrow line width. The Pound–Rebka experiment measured the relative redshift of two sources situated at the top and bottom of Harvard University's Jefferson tower. The result was in excellent agreement with general relativity. This was one of the first precision experiments testing general relativity. The experiment was later improved to better than the 1% level by Pound and Snider.|$|E

25|$|Light has an {{associated}} frequency, and this frequency {{may be used}} to drive the workings of a clock. The <b>gravitational</b> <b>redshift</b> leads to an important conclusion about time itself: Gravity makes time run slower. Suppose we build two identical clocks whose rates are controlled by some stable atomic transition. Place one clock on top of the tower, while the other clock remains on the ground. An experimenter on top of the tower observes that signals from the ground clock are lower in frequency than those of the clock next to her on the tower. Light going up the tower is a just a wave, and it is impossible for wave crests to disappear on the way up. Exactly as many oscillations of light arrive {{at the top of the}} tower as were emitted at the bottom. The experimenter concludes that the ground clock is running slow, and can confirm this by bringing the tower clock down to compare side-by-side with the ground clock. For a 1km tower, the discrepancy would amount to about 9.4nanoseconds per day, easily measurable with modern instrumentation.|$|E
