40|$|The right <b>of</b> <b>freedoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>expression</b> is one <b>of</b> the {{fundamental}} human rights. This, among other things, is guaranteed by Article 10 of the European Convention {{for the protection}} of human rights and freedoms. However, the <b>freedoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>expression</b> is not an absolute right, which means that in some situations it may be restricted, especially if the public interest requires that. Submission of information for media must be in accordance with the human rights {{of the people who are}} involved. These rights are guaranteed by the European Convention for protection of human rights and freedoms, by the Constitution and by Laws. Having in consideration that this freedom carries some duties, the enjoyment <b>of</b> this <b>freedom</b> may be based on formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties, as it is prescribed by law and they are necessary in one democratic society for the purpose of crime prevention, protection of reputation or protection of the rights of other people, for prevention of disclosure of confidential information or for maintaining the authority and independence of the judiciary. If the courts accept the thesis that somebody has the right to say or write something and it is said in public interest, although it violates the rights of another person, it means that the <b>freedoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>expression</b> prevails over some other rights. This paper aims to examine the aspect <b>of</b> <b>freedoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>expression,</b> especially in the media and the judiciary, versus the need of protection of the public interest and latest legal decisions that are related to this matter...|$|R

5|$|Finally, the Court {{expressed}} {{the view that}} if free speech is to be favoured over the protection of reputation in applying a Reynolds-type defence, another issue {{that will have to}} be considered is what balance should be struck between the two competing interests. In this connection, Chan C.J. said that the court would have to decide whether <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>expression</b> is to be given preference over the protection of reputation, whether it is a fundamental right that trumps the protection of reputation unless it is shown that the defamatory statement was made maliciously, or whether it is co-equal with the protection of reputation.|$|E
5|$|Freedom of {{the press}} is limited, with {{numerous}} restrictions on publishing rights and information dissemination.

Sabah, where all tabloids but one are independent of government control, has the freest press in Malaysia.

The first four years of the weekly column made Mr. Dooley popular in Chicago, but little noticed elsewhere.

Robyn Blumner of the St. Petersburg Times wrote that Lewis aptly summarized {{the development of the}} U.S. Constitution's protections of freedom of speech and of the press.

5|$|Sonically, Impossible Princess is a {{departure}} from Minogue's previous music, having taken influence by the techno and Britpop revolution in the mid-to-late 1990s. Conceived as an experimental record, the material encompasses a variety of darker styles from the dance genre, including trip hop, electronica, rock, drum and bass and house. Additionally, selected recordings experiments with cultural elements like Middle Eastern music and Celtic origins. Lyrically, the album's central focus is about Minogue's self-discovery, which she found during a series of trips in Asia, America and Australasia, and further delves into the <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>expression,</b> relationships and emotions.|$|E
