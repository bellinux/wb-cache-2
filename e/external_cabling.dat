During the day computer problems on the ISS were further resolved, with all six processors available (four online and two standby). Following the successful attempt to revive four channels on flight day 8 after bypassing {{what appeared to be}} a faulty power switch with <b>external</b> <b>cabling,</b> cosmonauts Fyodor Yurchikhin and Oleg Kotov repeated that same modification on the last two channels.|$|E
40|$|Bridges from {{prestressed}} concrete with <b>external</b> <b>cables</b> are a proper solution for new structures or as a repair system of existing bridge structures. Dynamic behaviour of one bridge was tested in situ and on mathematical models {{and influence of}} axial force in <b>external</b> <b>cables</b> was verified. WIM results were processed and parameters of traffic flow were used to simulate passages of heavy vehicle over FEM models of the bridge.

50|$|HyperTransport-connected devices can be {{installed}} in HTX slots or in Opteron CPU sockets. HTX slots are placed to allow access to <b>external</b> <b>cabling</b> {{and so are the}} natural location for network devices, such as the Qlogic Infinipath network adapter. As an alternative installation location, AMD CPU sockets provide access to the motherboard DRAM channels and support a larger power budget with room for the corresponding heat sink. In some system configurations, the CPU sockets provide access to multiple HyperTransport links that support higher frequencies than single 16-bit (per direction) 800 MHz link supported by the HTX slot.|$|E
50|$|Originally {{reported}} by Hexus.net {{as a side}} project to the R600 series graphics cards. Codenamed Lasso, the project is an external graphics solution using desktop video cards, and data is sent via two cables as defined in PCI-E <b>external</b> <b>cabling</b> specification (version 1.0). The project would later fall into development hell with unknown development status. In June 2008, near Computex 2008, rumours surfaced over the Internet about AMD is preparing an external graphics solution for notebook computers, but using a proprietary connectivity solution instead. The ATI XGP was officially announced on June 4, 2008 {{during the course of}} the Computex 2008 exhibition.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} method to measure the {{absolute}} surface resistance of conductive samples at a set of GHz frequencies with superconducting lead stripline resonators at temperatures 1 - 6 K. The stripline structure can easily be applied for bulk samples and allows direct calculation of the surface resistance without the requirement of additional calibration measurements or sample reference points. We further describe a correction method to reduce experimental background on high-Q resonance modes by exploiting TEM-properties of the <b>external</b> <b>cabling.</b> We then show applications of this method to the reference materials gold, tantalum, and tin, which include the anomalous skin effect and conventional superconductivity. Furthermore, we extract the complex optical conductivity for an all-lead stripline resonator to find a coherence peak and the superconducting gap of lead. Comment: 10 pages, 9 figure...|$|E

40|$|The {{need for}} further sophistication of an already complex serial CAMAC control system at Fermilab led to the {{development}} of an Auxilary/Master CAMAC Crate Controller. The controller contains a Motorola 6800 microprocessor, 2 K bytes of RAM, and 8 K bytes of PROM memory. Bussed dataway lines are time shared with CAMAC signals to provide memory expansion and direct addressing of peripheral devices without the need of <b>external</b> <b>cabling.</b> The Auxiliary/Master Crate Controller (A/MCC) can function as either a Master, i. e., stand alone, crate controller or as an Auxiliary controller to Fermilab's Serial Crate Controller (SCC). Two modules, one single- and one double-width, make up an A/ MCC. The microprocessor has one nonmaskable and one maskable vectored interrupt. Time sharing the dataway between SCC programmed and block transfer generated dataway cycles and A/MCC operations still allows a 99 percent microprocessor CPU busy time. Since the conception of the A/MCC, there has been an increasing number of control system-related projects proposed which would not have been possible or would have been very difficult to implement without such a device. The first such application now in use at Fermilab is a stand-alone control system for a mass spectrometer experiment in the Main Ring Internal Target Area. This application in addition to other proposed A/MCC applications, both stand-alone and auxiliary, is discussed. (auth...|$|E

40|$|Recently in Japan, many {{reinforced}} concrete structures (RC) {{as well as}} prestressed concrete structures (PC) damaged by chlorides attack have been repaired by various methods. On the other hand, even though RC/PC members which are not damaged encounter the grade-up scheme, since the design load for these structures have increased. External prestressing method, which is simple and easy to construct {{is considered to be}} one of the most suitable method to improve the existing condition. However, the estimation of ultimate strength for the structures with external prestressing tendons has not been clearly specified in the design. In this paper, the authors have discussed the efficiency of increasing ultimate flexural strength of PC beams reinforced with <b>external</b> <b>cables.</b> The ultimate flexural strength was calculated on the assumption that the elongation of the cable at the ultimate state is equal to that of the concrete which is in the same location as the cable.
