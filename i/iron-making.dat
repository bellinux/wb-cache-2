5|$|The {{family moved}} to Ohio when the senior McKinley was a boy, {{settling}} in New Lisbon (now Lisbon). He met Nancy Allison there, and married her later. The Allison family was of mostly English descent and among Pennsylvania's earliest settlers. The family trade on both sides was <b>iron-making,</b> and McKinley senior operated foundries throughout Ohio, in New Lisbon, Niles, Poland, and finally Canton. The McKinley household was, like many from Ohio's Western Reserve, steeped in Whiggish and abolitionist sentiment, the latter based on the family's staunch Methodist beliefs. William followed in the Methodist tradition, becoming active in the local Methodist church {{at the age of}} sixteen. He was a lifelong pious Methodist.|$|E

25|$|An economy {{based on}} manual labour was {{replaced}} by one dominated by industry and the manufacture of machinery. It began with the mechanization of the textile industries {{and the development of}} <b>iron-making</b> techniques, and trade expansion was enabled by the introduction of canals, improved roads, and then railways.|$|E
25|$|These {{movements}} {{took place}} at approximately {{the same time as}} the settlement of the <b>iron-making</b> Mashariki Bantu from West Africa in the Lake Victoria and Lake Tanganyika areas. They brought with them the west African planting tradition and the primary staple of yams. They subsequently migrated out of these regions across the rest of Tanzania between 2,300 and 1,700 years ago.|$|E
25|$|These {{purchases}} {{took place}} {{only a short}} time before the Bessemer process (announced 1856) began to undercut the old <b>iron-making</b> processes. That was bad luck but possibly they should have observed the Bessemer process more carefully before expanding the factory especially as Galloways, who supplied the bridges for the Ulverston and Lancaster Railway, were key players {{in the development of the}} Bessemer process.|$|E
25|$|Baekje {{was a great}} {{maritime}} power; its nautical skill, {{which made}} it the Phoenicia of East Asia, {{was instrumental in the}} dissemination of Buddhism throughout East Asia and continental culture to Japan. Baekje played a fundamental role in transmitting cultural developments, such as Chinese characters, Buddhism, <b>iron-making,</b> advanced pottery, and ceremonial burial to ancient Japan. Other aspects of culture were also transmitted when the Baekje court retreated to Japan after Baekje was conquered by the Silla–Tang alliance.|$|E
25|$|But the {{simultaneous}} {{increase in the}} availability of capital, the changing flux of technology (metallurgy), the availability of skilled foreign labour {{and the rise of}} an educated middle class meant that <b>iron-making</b> in the Weald would presage change across England. It would, in many ways, pave the way for the rise of the new industrial middle class. A trade consisting mostly of weapons would evolve into other more common tools as well: fire-backs, andirons, anvils, hammers, pots and pans and even grave slabs.|$|E
25|$|A nine-hole {{golf course}} was opened in 1922, {{and has since}} been {{expanded}} to 18 holes. The Pennsylvania Alpine Club paid for {{the reconstruction of the}} stack of the old furnace and built a monument. A blacksmith shop, the stack, and numerous charcoal hearths and charcoal roads are visible reminders of the <b>iron-making</b> days. Many of the roads and facilities used today at Caledonia State Park were built during the Great Depression by the young men of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC).|$|E
25|$|Although {{steel is}} an alloy {{of iron and}} {{a small amount of}} carbon, {{historically}} steel and <b>iron-making</b> were intended for different products given the high costs of steel over wrought iron. The main difficulty with making steel is that its higher melting point than pig or cast iron was not easily achievable in large-scale production until methods that introduced air or oxygen to oxidize the carbon in the molten pig iron were developed, allowing the direct conversion of molten pig iron to molten steel.|$|E
25|$|In the 19th century, Taunton {{was also}} {{the center of an}} {{important}} <b>iron-making</b> industry, utilizing much bog iron from the numerous swamps in the surrounding area. The iron industry in Taunton produced a variety of goods including stoves (Weir Stove Company/Glenwood), tacks (Field Tack Company) and machinery. One of the more successful companies during this period was the Mason Machine Works, founded by William Mason, which produced machinery for the textile industry, as well as steam locomotives. The Taunton Locomotive Works (begun in 1846) also operated in the city during this time.|$|E
25|$|Edward III {{brought over}} Flemish weavers {{to develop the}} Wealden cloth {{industry}} using wool from Romney Marsh; Cranbrook became the centre of this as it had local supplies of fuller's earth and plenty of streams that could be dammed to drive the fulling mills. <b>Iron-making</b> was carried on at Bedgebury on the River Teise, an industry which dates back to Roman times. The tributaries of the River Beult around Cranbrook powered 17 watermills at one time. In 1290 the town received a charter from Archbishop Peckham, allowing it to hold a market in the High Street.|$|E
25|$|In 760 BC, the Kushites were {{expelled}} from Egypt by iron-wielding Assyrians. Later, the administrative capital was moved from Napata to Meröe, developing {{into a new}} Nubian culture. Initially Meroites were highly Egyptianized, but they subsequently began to take on distinctive features. Nubia became a center of <b>iron-making</b> and cotton cloth manufacturing. Egyptian writing {{was replaced by the}} Meroitic alphabet. The lion god Apedemak was added to the Egyptian pantheon of gods. Trade links to the Red Sea increased, linking Nubia with Mediterranean Greece. Its architecture and art diversified, with pictures of lions, ostriches, giraffes, and elephants. Eventually with the rise of Aksum, Nubia's trade links were broken and it suffered environmental degradation from the tree cutting required for iron production. In 350 AD, the Aksumite king Ezana brought Meröe to an end.|$|E
25|$|The Thomas Iron Company {{was a major}} <b>iron-making</b> firm in the Lehigh Valley {{from its}} {{organization}} in 1854 until its decline and eventual dismantling in the early 20th century. The firm was {{named in honor of}} its founder, David Thomas, who had emigrated to the United States in 1839 to introduce hot blast iron making in the Lehigh Valley, and now embarked on an independent ironmaking venture. The company's main and original plant was in Hokendauqua, Pennsylvania, which grew up around it; it also came to own blast furnaces and railroads elsewhere in the Lehigh Valley and mines in both Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Changes in the iron industry in the early Twentieth Century left Thomas Iron struggling to compete, and after a failed attempt at modernization and revival from 1913 to 1916, the company's assets were sold and largely dismantled during the 1920s.|$|E
25|$|The Industrial Revolution was {{a period}} in the late 18th century and early 19th century when major changes in agriculture, manufacturing, and {{transport}} affected socioeconomic and cultural conditions in Britain and subsequently spread throughout Europe and North America and eventually the world, a process that continues as industrialisation. Technological advancements, most notably {{the invention of the}} steam engine by Scottish engineer James Watt, were major catalysts in the industrialisation of Britain and, later, the wider world. It started in England and Scotland in the mid-18th century with the mechanisation of the textile industries, the development of <b>iron-making</b> techniques and the increased use of refined coal. Trade expansion was enabled by the introduction of canals, improved roads and railways. The introduction of steam power (fuelled primarily by coal) and powered machinery (mainly in textile manufacturing) underpinned the dramatic increases in production capacity. The development of all-metal machine tools in the first two decades of the 19th century facilitated the manufacture of more production machines for manufacturing in other industries. The effects spread throughout Western Europe and North America during the 19th century, eventually affecting most of the world. The impact of this change on society was enormous.|$|E
25|$|The {{industrial}} revolution changed a mainly rural society into an urban one, {{but with a}} strong contrast between northern and southern Belgium. During the Middle Ages and the Early Modern Period, Flanders was characterised {{by the presence of}} large urban centres (...) {{at the beginning of the}} nineteenth century this region (Flanders), with an urbanisation degree of more than 30 per cent, remained one of the most urbanised in the world. By comparison, this proportion reached only 17 per cent in Wallonia, barely 10 per cent in most West European countries, 16 per cent in France and 25 per cent in Britain. Nineteenth century industrialisation did not affect the traditional urban infrastructure, except in Ghent (...) Also, in Wallonia the traditional urban network was largely unaffected by the industrialisation process, even though the proportion of city-dwellers rose from 17 to 45 per cent between 1831 and 1910. Especially in the Haine, Sambre and Meuse valleys, between the Borinage and Liège, where there was a huge industrial development based on coal-mining and <b>iron-making,</b> urbanisation was fast. During these eighty years the number of municipalities with more than 5,000 inhabitants increased from only 21 to more than one hundred, concentrating nearly half of the Walloon population in this region. Nevertheless, industrialisation remained quite traditional in the sense that it did not lead to the growth of modern and large urban centres, but to a conurbation of industrial villages and towns developed around a coal-mine or a factory. Communication routes between these small centres only became populated later and created a much less dense urban morphology than, for instance, the area around Liège where the old town was there to direct migratory flows.|$|E

500|$|Simon B. Buckner (Sr.), {{was born}} at Glen Lily, his family's estate near Munfordville, Kentucky. He was the third child and second son of Aylett Hartswell and Elizabeth Ann (Morehead) Buckner. Named after the [...] "South American soldier and statesman, Simón Bolívar, then {{at the height of}} his power", Buckner did not begin school until age nine, when he {{enrolled}} at a private school in Munfordville. His closest friend in Munfordville was Thomas J. Wood, who would become a Union Army general opposing Buckner at the Battle of Perryville and the Battle of Chickamauga during the Civil War. Buckner's father was an iron worker, but found that Hart County did not have sufficient timber to fire his iron furnace. Consequently, in 1838, he moved the family to southern Muhlenberg County where he organized an <b>iron-making</b> corporation. Buckner attended school in Greenville, and later at Christian County Seminary in Hopkinsville.|$|E

50|$|Beehive ovens {{were also}} used in <b>iron-making.</b> Before this time, <b>iron-making</b> {{utilized}} large quantities of charcoal, produced by burning wood. As forests dwindled dangerously, the substitution of coke for charcoal became common in Great Britain, and the coke was manufactured by burning coal in heaps {{on the ground in}} such a way that only the outer layer burned, leaving the interior of the pile in a carbonized state. In the late 19th century, brick beehive ovens were developed, which allowed more control over the burning process.|$|E
50|$|When the Romans invaded Britain in AD 43 the Weald {{already had}} a {{well-established}} tradition of <b>iron-making,</b> using very small, clay bloomery furnaces for iron-smelting. The pre-Roman settlement pattern was one of sparse occupation based on major defended enclosures along {{the northern edge of}} the High Weald with smaller enclosures deeper within it, such as the hill-fort at Garden Hill. The association of these smaller enclosures with <b>iron-making</b> and other evidence suggest that Iron Age colonizers saw the Weald primarily as a source of iron.|$|E

5000|$|After {{transferring}} {{his medical}} practice to his son-in-law, Eliot wrote {{a series of}} essays on [...] "field husbandry" [...] (primarily agriculture). The first six concerned ways of improving agriculture; the seventh was about <b>iron-making.</b> The first six essays were collected under the title Essays Upon Field Husbandry. The first of the essays was published in 1748, with the following ones in 1749, 1751, 1753, 1754 and 1759. The last essay was delayed because of the French and Indian War. The essay on <b>iron-making</b> was published in 1763. The first three essays were published in New London, Connecticut; essays four and five were published in New York. The sixth agricultural essay was published in New Haven, Connecticut and the <b>iron-making</b> essay was again published in New York. The fact that the essays were published near his home enabled his neighbors and friends to share his accomplishments; “Jared is best seen as a thoughtful and convincing writer”. Jared wrote his essays in a flowing, easily understandable style, describing farming {{in the light of}} science. He added a religious overtone, asserting that his creatures were working for the “fulfillment of the kingdom”. Each essay had a different topic, ending with an appropriate Biblical verse.|$|E
