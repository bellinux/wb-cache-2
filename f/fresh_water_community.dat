Small-scale SMDDS (s-SMDDS) is an attractive and viable option {{for the production of}} <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> for small <b>communities</b> in remote arid areas. The minimum cost design and operation of s-SMDDS are determined by a systematic method, which involves a pseudo-steady-state approach for equipment sizing and dynamic optimization using overall system mathematical models. Two s-SMDDS employing an air gap membrane distillation module with membrane areas of 11. 5 m 2 and 23 m 2 are analyzed. The lowest water production costs are $ 5. 92 /m 3 and $ 5. 16 /m 3 for water production rates of 500 kg/day and 1000 kg/day, respectively. For these two optimal cases, the performance ratios are 0. 85 and 0. 91; the recovery ratios are 4. 07 % and 4. 57 %. The effect of membrane characteristics on the production cost is investigated.

Salt-water adapted turtles {{were exposed to}} <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> for 4 d before being returned to salt water. During the initial salt water phase, absolute and relative water flux rates were 1. 2 +/- 0. 1 l d(- 1) and 123. 0 +/- 6. 8 ml kg(- 1) d(- 1), respectively. When turtles were exposed to <b>fresh</b> <b>water,</b> rates increased by approximately 30 %. Upon return to salt water, rates decreased to original levels.
