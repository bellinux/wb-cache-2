He reached a career-high ATP singles ranking of world No. 4 in May 1988 and a career-high ATP doubles ranking of world No. 6 in August 1988. He {{has been described as}} one of the greatest net players of all time.

25|$|At the 1991 Royal Rumble, Luke set {{a rather}} unfortunate record as he lasted {{a total of}} 4 seconds. Using the {{trademark}} arm-swing entrance, <b>he</b> <b>climbed</b> <b>into</b> the ring, walked across in a straight path, and was thrown over the top rope by Earthquake. In a televised 6 man tag-team match, the Bushwhackers teamed with Tugboat against Earthquake and the Nasty Boys; Tugboat turned on his partners {{after a few minutes}} of action and joined Earthquake in laying the two New Zealanders out cold. After the heel turn Tugboat changed his name to Typhoon and together they became known as “The Natural Disasters”. The Bushwhackers demanded a chance to get even with the big team but were easily defeated at the 1991 SummerSlam PPV. After destroying the Bushwhackers, the Disasters targeted André the Giant who was at ringside on crutches due to an injury. The assault was stopped by the Legion of Doom who ran off the Natural Disasters.|$|E
500|$|Of {{particular}} {{note was}} Marseille's 158th claim. After {{landing in the}} afternoon of the 26 September 1942, he was physically exhausted. Several accounts allude to his Squadron members being visibly shocked at Marseille's physical state. Marseille, according to his own post-battle accounts, had been engaged by a Spitfire pilot in an intense dogfight that began at high altitude and descended to low-level. Marseille recounted how both he and his opponent strove to get onto the tail of the other. Both succeeded and fired but each time the pursued managed to turn the table on his attacker. Finally, with only 15 minutes of fuel remaining, <b>he</b> <b>climbed</b> <b>into</b> the sun. The RAF fighter followed and was caught in the glare. Marseille executed a tight turn and roll, fired from 100 metres range. The Spitfire caught fire and shed a wing. It crashed into the ground with the pilot still inside. Marseille wrote, [...] "That was the toughest adversary I have ever had. His turns were fabulous... I thought it would be my last fight". Unfortunately the pilot and his unit remain unidentified.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh saints! what is {{become of}} him? [...] Perhaps <b>he's</b> <b>climbed</b> <b>into</b> an oak, [...] Where {{he will stay}} till he is dead; [...] Or sadly he has been misled, [...] And joined the {{wandering}} gypsey-folk." ...|$|R
50|$|On Lewis Blacks Root of All Evil, comedian Andy Daly {{exhibits}} a video clip showing {{that he has}} also attempted a bed in to protest the War in Iraq.

He tries to apologize, but she refuses to talk to him. Therefore <b>he</b> <b>climbs</b> <b>into</b> her room, staying there until she forgives him.|$|R
500|$|On {{the morning}} of 9 July 1918 he {{travelled}} {{to the home of}} his fiancé, Miss Alex-Tweedie in Whitehall Court. Tweedie recalled their conversation revolved around his new posting and his book. He had delivered the manuscript to Mr Grey two days earlier and was expecting its publication. While there, McCudden promised to surpass von Richthofen who had been killed in action on 21 April 1918. In view of what happened to von Richthofen, and John McCudden, he promised that [...] "I won't bustle, or do anything foolish like my brother". He then went next door and had breakfast with his sister Mary. Upon leaving, he fumbled around in his pocket and handed her a bulky envelope containing his Victoria Cross and other decorations. He took his leave of her and drove to Hounslow where <b>he</b> <b>climbed</b> <b>into</b> his S.E.5a (C1126). He took off shortly after 13:00. McCudden certainly stopped en route, as about six o'clock that afternoon he called the AOC No. 13 Wing, Patrick Playfair, to announce his imminent arrival at Boffles, where No. 60 Squadron was stationed.|$|E
2500|$|According to {{a legend}} related by Bertarius of Verdun, one day Paulus {{was working in}} the bakery in the Abbey of Tholey when the oven malfunctioned. [...] He feared that the bread would not be ready in time for meals, so <b>he</b> <b>climbed</b> <b>into</b> the burning oven in full habit, cleaned it with his hood, {{arranged}} the loaves to be baked, and later emerged from the oven with the fully baked loaves.|$|E
2500|$|The camera obscura {{principle}} {{is not limited}} to eyes, or even lenses, but works with a small hole, or aperture, and any darkened space of whatever size or shape. In modern times, camera obscuras have been fashioned from shoeboxes, oatmeal boxes, soda cans, cookie containers, seashells, eggshells, refrigerators, tents, trucks, airplane hangars, and even hollowed out forms of snow and dirt. A camera obscura can also be produced by a small hole in a roof, wall, or window-shutter through which the view of the outside is projected onto a wall inside a darkened room. [...] Biologist Donald Perry went on an expedition into the rain forest of Costa Rica where <b>he</b> <b>climbed</b> <b>into</b> the cavity of a large hollow tree, and discovered a small hole that projected an upside-down image of the outside world onto the opposite interior wall of the trunk. [...] This sort of experience is available across time.|$|E

50|$|As Joe {{begins to}} drift off, Seligman silently returns. <b>He</b> <b>climbs</b> <b>into</b> {{the bed with}} his pants off and {{attempts}} to have intercourse with her.

Seligman protests and attempts to justify his behavior, but Joe shoots him, grabs her things, and flees the apartment.|$|R
6000|$|... 'This,' said Strickland, very calmly, as <b>he</b> <b>climbed</b> <b>into</b> bed, 'is {{called the}} nineteenth century. Did {{you hear what}} that man said?' ...|$|E

60|$|A heavy {{sense of}} dread and {{loneliness}} fell instantly upon him, as <b>he</b> <b>climbed</b> <b>into</b> this airy nest {{of stone and}} metal. His head went round and round. He listened, and then raised a wild ‘Holloa!’ Holloa! was mournfully protracted by the echoes.|$|E
60|$|Still as <b>he</b> <b>climbed</b> <b>into</b> {{the public}} view His charms of person more {{apparent}} grew, Till the pleased world that watched his airy grace Saw nothing of him but his nether face-- Forgot his follies with his head's retreat, And blessed his virtues as it viewed their seat.|$|E
60|$|Dane groaned {{inwardly}} as <b>he</b> <b>climbed</b> <b>into</b> {{the waiting}} vehicle, {{for the last}} speech placed beyond all doubt {{the fact that the}} occupants of the dog-cart had recognized him at Hallows Brig; and he knew that Lilian Chatterton held somewhat puritanical views. He had, it was evident, involved himself hopelessly.|$|E
