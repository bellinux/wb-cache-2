5|$|Development of MediEvil {{begun in}} late 1995 at {{independent}} developer Millennium Interactive in Cambridge. Chris Sorrell, previously {{known for the}} James Pond series of games, created the original concept for MediEvil and served as the game's creative director. Sorrell joined Millennium, {{with whom he had}} been working with for a while, after completing James Pond 3. When asked what he wanted to do, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> work with someone on the visual side. Jason Wilson, who would be the designer and a writer for the game, met up with Sorrell and began working on MediEvil.|$|E
5|$|Unhappy {{with how}} his NHL career ended, Fleury hired a {{personal}} trainer in February 2009 and began an attempt {{to return to the}} NHL. By August, he petitioned Commissioner Gary Bettman to lift his suspension. He was reinstated on September 10 following a meeting with Bettman, Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly and league doctors. Fleury then accepted a try-out offer from the Flames. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> prove to himself that he could still play at the NHL level, though his skeptics pointed to his child support payments and the failure of his concrete business, as well as the planned release of his autobiography, and argued Fleury's comeback was financially motivated.|$|E
5|$|He never {{attended}} {{school and was}} illiterate for some years of his early life. He learned {{to read and write}} reportedly out of curiosity after reading and hearing comic books and stories of Kalimán and Porfirio Cadena, El Ojo del Vidrio on the local radio station. In his autobiography, Moreno González said that as a child he believed he had the superhuman ability of speaking telepathically with animals like Kalimán did in the comics. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> be a hero like the comic characters. As a child, he was accustomed to seeing gunmen near his home, and played las guerritas ("war games") for fun. While playing the game, he often pretended to be dead, only to say later on that he had been wounded in the game but that he had managed to survive. At the age of twelve, he moved to Apatzingán and made a living by selling matches, peeling onions, working at a melon field, and throwing out the trash from several booths at a marketplace. As a teenager in the late 1980s, Moreno González migrated illegally to the United States, settling in California, where he eventually began selling marijuana. After some years, he moved to Texas and in 1994 was arrested for drug trafficking charges in McAllen. Nearly a decade later in 2003, the U.S. government charged him with conspiracy to distribute five tons of narcotics and issued an arrest warrant. Moreno González then fled back to Mexico.|$|E

He publicly gave his support to the French and stated that his position against the niqāb was actually older than France's.

25|$|In March 2015, Lara criticised the ICC for fining Pakistani cricket player Wahab Riaz {{after his}} 'shocking spell', {{as it was}} dubbed, when he managed to puzzle Australian player Shane Watson by giving him sarcastic claps, {{throwing}} the ball at him and sending him flying kisses. Watson was unable to cope with that and Riaz's high-quality bowling in the 2015 ICC World Cup. The team lost but Riaz was fined 50% of his match fee for his behaviour. Lara criticised this decision by the ICC {{and said it was}} 'uncalled for'. He said it was the only highlights of the game and said he would pay the fine himself. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> meet Riaz himself.|$|E
25|$|Fauvism, as a movement, had no {{concrete}} theories, and {{was short}} lived, beginning in 1905 and ending in 1907. The Fauves {{had only three}} exhibitions. Matisse {{was seen as the}} leader of the movement, due to his seniority in age and prior self-establishment in the academic art world. His 1905 portrait of Mme. Matisse, The Green Line (above), caused a sensation in Paris when it was first exhibited. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> create art to delight; art as a decoration was his purpose and it can be said that his use of bright colors tries to maintain serenity of composition. In 1906 at the suggestion of his dealer Ambroise Vollard, André Derain went to London and produced a series of paintings like Charing Cross Bridge, London (above) in the Fauvist style, paraphrasing the famous series by the Impressionist painter Claude Monet.|$|E

25|$|On 17 October 2010 Sammy {{was named}} {{captain of the}} West Indies Test team for its tour to Sri Lanka and {{until the end of}} the 2011 season, {{replacing}} Chris Gayle. At the time Sammy had played 8Tests and 41ODIs. The previous captain and vice, Chris Gayle and Dwayne Bravo respectively, had chosen not to sign central contracts with the West Indies Cricket Board and were replaced. Between January 2004 and the start of the tour to Sri Lanka in November, the West Indies had won just five of their previous 62Tests and were expected to lose the three match series against a team with a good home record. In a series shortened by poor weather Sammy scored 10 runs and took two wickets at an average of 75.50, and while <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> improve his own performance Sammy stated that he was pleased with the 0–0 result of the series. In the 2–0 defeat to Sri Lanka in the subsequent ODI series, Sammy scored 28runs and sent down 19wicketless overs.|$|E
25|$|On 16 May 2008, the BBC {{wrote that}} Hobbs was indecisive {{about whether to}} fight for first team {{opportunities}} in Liverpool or to join another club for more playing opportunities. Hobbs said wherever he went, he would look to play first team football. On 25 May, Hobbs signed for League One club Leicester City on a season-long loan deal. On joining the club, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> help Leicester win promotion to the Championship. He made his debut for the club in a pre-season match against Kettering Town, playing 80 minutes of a 4–1 victory. His debut came on 9 August in a 2–0 victory over Milton Keynes Dons, when he came on as an 88th-minute substitute for Aleksander Tunchev. Hobbs scored his first goal on 24 January 2009, scoring the last goal in a 4–2 victory over Huddersfield Town. In February 2009, he was red carded in a match against Bristol Rovers for fouling Darryl Duffy. However, the resultant penalty shot by Rickie Lambert was saved by Mark Bunn. Leicester manager Nigel Pearson commented that the decision was unfortunate, as he believed the foul was not intentional. In his first season with the club, besides winning the League One and winning promotion to the Championship, Hobbs was {{also included in the}} PFA Team of the Year. He was also voted as the Young Player of the year, as he made 44 appearances, where his team conceded 37 goals.|$|E
25|$|The {{supporters}} of Caesar argued that Caesar deserved {{an extension of}} his command so that the fruit of his success would not be lost. There was a debate on this. Pompey showed goodwill towards Caesar. He claimed that he had letters from Caesar in which <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> be relieved of his command, {{but he said that}} he thought that he should be allowed to stand for the consulship in absentia. Cato opposed this and said that if Caesar wanted this he had to lay down his arms and become a private citizen. Pompey did not contest Cato's view. This gave rise to suspicions about his real feelings towards Caesar. Plutarch wrote that Pompey also asked Caesar for the troops he had lent him back, using the Parthian war as a pretext. Although Caesar knew why Pompey asked this he sent the troops back home with generous gifts. Appian wrote that Caesar gave these soldiers a donation and also sent one of his legions to Rome. Pompey was drifting toward the optimates and away from Caesar. According to Plutarch the rift between Pompey and Cato became accentuated when Pompey fell seriously ill in Naples in 50 BC. When he recovered the people of Naples offered thanksgiving sacrifices. This celebration spread throughout Italy. He was feted in towns he travelled to {{on his way back to}} Rome. Plutarch wrote that this was said ‘to have done more than anything else to bring about the subsequent civil war’. It made Pompey arrogant, incautious and contemptuous of Caesar’s power. The following year the two men were fighting each other in the Great Roman Civil War.|$|E

500|$|Initially {{after the}} album's release, Bowie {{was excited to}} return to the studio to record more material, having written more songs than were {{recorded}} for the album. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> record more [...] "experimental" [...] music, referring to his work in the 1970s with Brian Eno. However, due to the poor critical reception of the album and subsequent tour, Bowie put those plans on hold and instead formed his rock band Tin Machine, which he used to rejuvenate himself creatively and artistically.|$|E
500|$|A month later, Cleveland {{brought in}} Romeo Crennel {{as the head}} coach, signing him to a five-year deal worth $11 million. Crennel was the {{defensive}} coordinator for the New England Patriots, who had just won the Super Bowl.
