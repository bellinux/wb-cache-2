5|$|Due to {{its vast}} size {{and range of}} altitudes, Argentina {{possesses}} {{a wide variety of}} climatic regions, ranging from the hot subtropical region in the north to the cold subantarctic in the far south.

5|$|The fourth upper premolar (P4) <b>has</b> <b>four</b> <b>main,</b> {{transversely}} placed crests; {{the description}} of S.bolligeri mentions an additional, centrally placed small crest.

Prieto and Böhme note that the posteroloph is convex on the back margin of the tooth. In Muscardinus, the number of ridges on P4 ranges from five in Muscardinus sansaniensis to two in M.pliocaenicus and the living hazel dormouse, but the protoloph and metaloph are always connected on the lingual (inner) side of the tooth. P4 is two-rooted in S.alpinus and three-rooted in S.bolligeri.|$|E

5|$|The vast size, {{and wide}} range of altitudes, {{contribute}} to Argentina's diverse climate. Argentina possesses {{a wide variety of}} climatic regions ranging from subtropical in the north to subantarctic in the far south. Lying between those is the Pampas region, which features a mild and humid climate. Consequently, there is a wide variety of biomes in the country, including subtropical rain forests, semi-arid and arid regions, temperate plains in the Pampas, and cold subantarctic in the south. However, despite the diversity of biomes, about two-thirds of Argentina is arid or semi-arid. In general, Argentina <b>has</b> <b>four</b> <b>main</b> climate types: warm, moderate, arid, and cold, all determined by the expanse across latitude, range in altitude, and relief features. Argentina is best divided into six distinct regions reflecting the climatic conditions of the country as a whole. From north to south, these regions are Northwest, Chaco, Northeast, Cuyo/Monte, Pampas, and Patagonia. Each climatic region has distinctive types of vegetation.|$|E
