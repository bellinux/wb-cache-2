40|$|The <b>distribution</b> of <b>goods</b> {{for urban}} areas {{is vital to}} the {{prosperity}} of these areas. Nevertheless, there are various environmental and accessibility problems related to the urban <b>goods</b> <b>distribution</b> process. Only a comprehensive set of policy actions, that addresses the problems at different geographical scales and at various functional levels in concert, can solve these problems. These functional levels refer to the organisational aspects of the system (logistics), the goods transport and goods traffic means, the infrastructures, and the spatial system in which the urban <b>goods</b> <b>distribution</b> process must function. Progressive innovation is required on all these levels to achieve an efficient urban <b>goods</b> <b>distribution</b> system, efficient both in terms of commercial interests and societal interests. In the thesis, an integrated long-term problem-solving vision of a future urban <b>goods</b> <b>distribution</b> system is developed. The proposed integrated logistics concept for urban <b>goods</b> <b>distribution,</b> is based on the optimal bundling of the movements of goods (consolidation) in time as well as space. This should be done by providing logistic services, such as city logistics, backbone logistics and network logistics, in close harmony with appropriate technological means, such as advanced vehicle technologies, advanced infrastructures, and other supporting systems. The integrated concepts are based on the application of different transport systems in different areas: that is, the concept is based on intermodality. Introducing such a complex, integrated <b>goods</b> <b>distribution</b> system will require a long string of co-ordinated actions {{from a wide variety of}} public and private actors. This necessitates the development and application of an implementation strategy that includes all the necessary actions. Trai...|$|R

The main objective is to optimize <b>goods</b> <b>distribution</b> and minimize costs. At the same time, the customer's demands have to be fulfilled and vehicle capacity cannot be exceeded. The problem of <b>goods</b> <b>distribution</b> from depot to stores is solved by the Vehicle routing problem model in MPL. It is necessary to consider specifications of a Heterogenous fleet, because the company holds vehicles with different capacities. The practical part includes comparison of costs, which are spent on <b>goods</b> <b>distribution</b> with vehicles of particular capacities. It also includes an application of the Heterogenous fleet vehicle routing problem with time windows to this specific problem. Following interpretation, results from the task are compared with real distribution system used by the company...|$|R

40|$|Efficient <b>goods</b> <b>distribution</b> {{planning}} {{is vital to}} ensure high business revenues for logistics operators and minimize negative impacts on the environment. In this thesis, we address three main problems related to <b>goods</b> <b>distribution</b> planning in urban areas namely customer allocation, order scheduling, and vehicle routing. A three step approach is proposed. In the first step, we use Nearest Neighbour and Tabu Search for balanced allocation of customers to logistics depots. In the second step, Genetic Algorithm approach is used to perform order scheduling at each depot for the allocated customers. In the third and the last step, we perform vehicle allocations and generate fastest paths for goods delivery to customers using modified Dijkstra’s algorithm. All these decisions are made considering realistic conditions associated with <b>goods</b> <b>distribution</b> in urban areas such as presence of congestion, municipal regulations, for example vehicle sizing, timing and access regulations etc. The objective is to minimize total distribution costs of logistics operators under these constraints. A prototype decision support system is developed integrating the proposed approaches for <b>goods</b> <b>distribution</b> planning in urban areas. The strength of the proposed decision support system {{is its ability to}} generate fast and efficient solutions for balanced customer allocation, dynamic order scheduling, vehicle allocation considering environmental constraints and fastest path generation under dynamic traffic conditions. The proposed model results are verified and validated against other standard approaches available in literature. ...|$|R
