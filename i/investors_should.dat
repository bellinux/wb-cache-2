25|$|In finance, {{standard}} deviation {{is often used}} {{as a measure of}} the risk associated with price-fluctuations of a given asset (stocks, bonds, property, etc.), or the risk of a portfolio of assets (actively managed mutual funds, index mutual funds, or ETFs). Risk {{is an important factor in}} determining how to efficiently manage a portfolio of investments because it determines the variation in returns on the asset and/or portfolio and gives investors a mathematical basis for investment decisions (known as mean-variance optimization). The fundamental concept of risk is that as it increases, the expected return on an investment should increase as well, an increase known as the risk premium. In other words, <b>investors</b> <b>should</b> expect a higher return on an investment when that investment carries a higher level of risk or uncertainty. When evaluating investments, <b>investors</b> <b>should</b> estimate both the expected return and the uncertainty of future returns. Standard deviation provides a quantified estimate of the uncertainty of future returns.|$|E

2500|$|Harry Markowitz's 1952 {{doctoral}} thesis [...] "Portfolio Selection" [...] and its published version {{was one of}} the first efforts in economics journals to formally adapt mathematical concepts to finance. [...] Markowitz formalized a notion of mean return and covariances for common stocks which allowed him to quantify the concept of [...] "diversification" [...] in a market. He showed how to compute the mean return and variance for a given portfolio and argued that <b>investors</b> <b>should</b> hold only those portfolios whose variance is minimal among all portfolios with a given mean return. [...] Although the language of finance now involves Itō calculus, management of risk in a quantifiable manner underlies much of the modern theory.|$|E

Purpose: The purpose of this thesis is to give the smaller investor a tool for {{investing in the}} stock market. The thesis aim to illustrate, through key ratios, what companies an <b>investor</b> <b>should</b> look for when investing in a company. Method: By studying already existing theories and then apply them on the thesis. The theories was then developed and refined to evolve to the finished thesis. Result: The smaller investor who chooses to apply the thesis and its principles should be able to establish an opinion about any given company and the industry it does business in. Furthermore the <b>investor</b> <b>should</b> then be able to decide whether a company is worth investing in or if another company gives more value.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{estimate}} the fair value of Aker Solutions ASA per 31. 05. 2017. The fair value is held up against the market price to make a recommendation as to what investment strategy an external, well-diversified <b>investor</b> <b>should</b> follow. The strategic analysis concludes that Aker Solutions has a potential strategic advantage in the longer term, but faces strong challenges in the market in the short term. A fundamental valuation by a DCF approach is used as the main technique for estimating the fair value. The valuation is supplemented by a multiple analysis. The fundamental valuation gives an estimate per 31. 05. 2017 of 43, 05 NOK/share. It is supported by the relative valuation of 53, 74 NOK/share. Per 31. 05. 2017 the shares are traded at a discount relative to fair value of 3, 4 %. Given the uncertainty in the estimates, a neutral investment strategy is recommended. The conclusion is that an <b>investor</b> <b>should</b> hold shares of Aker Solutions ASA...|$|R
