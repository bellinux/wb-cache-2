40|$|We {{demonstrate}} the theoretical possibility of obtaining a pure spin current in a 1 D ring with spin-orbit interaction by irradiation with a non-adiabatic, two-component terahertz laser pulse, whose spatial asymmetry is reflected by an internal <b>dephasing</b> <b>angle</b> ϕ. The stationary solutions {{of the equation}} of motion for the density operator are obtained for a spin-orbit coupling linear in the electron momentum (Rashba) and {{used to calculate the}} time-dependent charge and spin currents. We find that there are critical values of ϕ at which the charge current disappears, while the spin current reaches a maximum or a minimum value. Comment: 8 pages, 5 figure...|$|E
