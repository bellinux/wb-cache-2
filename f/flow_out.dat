5|$|Rohling's 2004 Bipolar model {{suggests}} that sea level rise lifted buoyant ice shelves, causing their destabilisation and destruction. Without a floating ice shelf to support them, continental ice sheets would <b>flow</b> <b>out</b> towards the oceans and disintegrate into icebergs and sea ice.|$|E
5|$|The {{two main}} river {{systems of the}} state are the Krishna and its tributaries, the Bhima, Ghataprabha, Vedavathi, Malaprabha, and Tungabhadra, in the north, and the Kaveri and its tributaries, the Hemavati, Shimsha, Arkavati, Lakshmana Thirtha and Kabini, in the south. Most of these rivers <b>flow</b> <b>out</b> of Karnataka eastward, {{reaching}} the sea at the Bay of Bengal.|$|E

5|$|Anne was crowned on St George's Day, 23 April 1702. Afflicted with gout, she {{was carried}} to Westminster Abbey {{in an open}} sedan chair, with a low back to permit her train to <b>flow</b> <b>out</b> behind her. On 4 May, England became embroiled in the War of the Spanish Succession, in which England, Austria and the Dutch Republic fought against France and Spain. Charles II of Spain had died childless in 1700, and the {{succession}} was disputed by two claimants: the Habsburg Archduke Charles of Austria and the Bourbon Philip, Duke of Anjou.|$|E
5|$|For a given {{topography}} and bathymetry {{the surge}} height is not solely affected by peak wind speed; {{the size of}} the storm also affects the peak surge. With any storm, the area of piled up water can <b>flow</b> <b>out</b> of the storm perimeter, and this escape mechanism is reduced in proportion to the surge force (for the same peak wind speed) when the storm covers more area (storm perimeter length per area is inversely proportional to a circular storm's diameter).|$|E
5|$|The Roman {{soldiers}} {{break the}} two thieves' legs (a procedure designed to hasten {{death in a}} crucifixion), {{but they do not}} break those of Jesus, as he is already dead (John 19:33). In , one soldier pierces Jesus' side with a lance, and blood and water <b>flow</b> <b>out.</b> In the Synoptics, when Jesus dies, the heavy curtain at the Temple is torn. In , an earthquake breaks open tombs. In Matthew and Mark, terrified by the events, a Roman centurion states that Jesus was the Son of God.|$|E

5|$|The {{investigation}} {{found that the}} level gauge had stuck at random times after a tank service in August 2005, {{but it did not}} concern maintenance contractors or site management. The independent shut-off switch was not fitted with a critical padlock to allow its check lever to work. Secondary containment (meant to trap the petrol in a retaining wall around the tank) failed and allowed petrol to <b>flow</b> <b>out.</b> Tertiary containment (drains and catchment areas to prevent release of spilled chemicals to the environment) also failed, and fuel and firefighting foam entered groundwater supplies. The {{investigation found}} secondary and tertiary containment to be inadequately designed and poorly maintained.|$|E
5|$|Qiao Weiyue {{also built}} five double slipways (lit. dams) between Anbei and Huaishi (or, the quays on the Huai waterfront). Each of these had ten lanes for the barges {{to go up}} and down. Their cargoes of {{imperial}} tax-grain were heavy, and as they were passing over they often came to grief and were damaged or wrecked, with loss of the grain and peculation by a cabal of the workers in league with local bandits hidden nearby. Qiao Weiyue therefore first ordered the construction of two gates at the third dam along the West River (near Huaiyin). The distance between the two gates was rather more than 50 paces (250ft) and the whole space was covered over with a great roof like a shed. The gates were 'hanging gates'; (when they were closed) the water accumulated like a tide until the required level was reached, and then when the time came it was allowed to <b>flow</b> <b>out.</b> He also built a horizontal bridge to protect their foundations. After this was done (to all the double slipways) the previous corruption was completely eliminated, and the passage of the boats went on without the slightest impediment.|$|E
5|$|Although clepsydrae {{were more}} useful than sundials—they {{could be used}} indoors, during the night, and also when the sky was cloudy—they were not as {{accurate}}; the Greeks, therefore, sought a way to improve their water clocks. Although still not as accurate as sundials, Greek water clocks became more accurate around 325, and they were adapted to have a face with an hour hand, making {{the reading of the}} clock more precise and convenient. One of the more common problems in most types of clepsydrae was caused by water pressure: when the container holding the water was full, the increased pressure caused the water to flow more rapidly. This problem was addressed by Greek and Roman horologists beginning in 100, and improvements continued {{to be made in the}} following centuries. To counteract the increased water flow, the clock's water containers—usually bowls or jugs—were given a conical shape; positioned with the wide end up, a greater amount of water had to <b>flow</b> <b>out</b> in order to drop the same distance as when the water was lower in the cone. Along with this improvement, clocks were constructed more elegantly in this period, with hours marked by gongs, doors opening to miniature figurines, bells, or moving mechanisms. There were some remaining problems, however, which were never solved, such as the effect of temperature. Water flows more slowly when cold, or may even freeze.|$|E
