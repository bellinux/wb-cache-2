Franklin looking towards the Presidents Chair, {{at the back}} of which a rising sun {{happened}} to be painted, observed to a few members near him, that Painters had found it difficult to distinguish in their art a rising from a setting sun. I have said he, often and often {{in the course of the}} Session, and the vicissitudes of my hopes and fears as to its issue, looked at that behind the President without being able to tell whether it was rising or setting: But now at length I have the happiness to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a rising and not a setting Sun.|$|E

A cat's whiskers are {{more than twice as}} thick as ordinary cat hairs, and their roots are three times deeper in a cat's tissue than other hairs. They have numerous nerve endings at their base, which give cats extraordinarily detailed information about nearby air movements and objects with which they make physical contact. They enable a cat to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> near obstacles without it needing to see them.|$|E
25|$|Like {{others before}} and after him, he also noticed that the Moon has a {{noticeable}} parallax, i.e., that it appears displaced from its calculated position (compared to the Sun or stars), and the difference is greater when closer to the horizon. He knew that this is because in the then-current models the Moon circles {{the center of the}} Earth, but the observer is at the surface—the Moon, Earth and observer form a triangle with a sharp angle that changes all the time. From the size of this parallax, the distance of the Moon as measured in Earth radii can be determined. For the Sun however, there was no observable parallax (we now <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> about 8.8", several times smaller than the resolution of the unaided eye).|$|E

500|$|Art is an {{important}} part of the curriculum, and is compulsory for those in Lower Grammar (year nine). There is a dedicated art studio in addition to a separate design and technology centre. Student artwork is displayed on the walls of the Lower Gallery, including a portrait of the Queen painted by Isobel Bidwell during the Golden Jubilee year; upon receipt of a copy, the Queen's lady-in-waiting said that [...] "The Queen was delighted to see the painting and <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> on display in the school".|$|E
500|$|A. I {{would like}} to say the {{following}} about this. The term [...] "special treatment" [...] (Sonderbehandlung) has various meanings. As Poliakov says, in Poliakov - Black or Red - I can give the page number right away...I have it in my files somewhere...he reproduces forms. On these forms it says, [...] "Re: Special Treatment" [...] - first of all for Poles suitable for Germanization (eindeutschungsfaehig), and the same word, special treatment, is also for Poles not suitable for Germanization, that is those to be sent from the Eastern Occupied Territories to the Generalgouvernement. So that is one meaning of special treatment (Sonderbehandlung). Special Treatment also means - I want to say this here in this context as well, although I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> known - also means all transports of Jews, the deportation transports.|$|E

[...] In late May 2010 she assessed the spill as [...] "probably the biggest environmental disaster we have ever faced in this country" [...] and said that the administration was [...] "prepared for the worst". [...] She added that [...] "I think what the American people need to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> possible we will have oil leaking from this well until August, when the relief wells will be finished."

500|$|Democratic National Committee Chairman Stephen A. Mitchell {{called for}} Nixon's {{resignation}} from the ticket, saying that [...] "Senator Nixon knows that [...] is morally wrong. General Eisenhower {{knows that it}} is morally wrong. The American people <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> morally wrong." [...] On the other hand, Republican Senator Karl Mundt called the story [...] "a filthy maneuver by left-wingers, fellow travelers, and former communists". Nixon issued a written statement explaining that the fund was to pay political expenses, in lieu of charging them to the taxpayer. Newspapers printed increasingly lurid accounts of the Fund and its beneficiary. The Sacramento Bee termed Nixon [...] "the pet protégé of a special interest group of rich southern Californians... their front man, if not, indeed, their lobbyist." [...] The Pasadena Star-News, meanwhile, reported that one contributor had been appealed to {{on the grounds that}} the Nixon family needed a larger home and could not afford a maid.|$|E
500|$|On 22 August 634, Abu Bakr died, {{having made}} Umar, Khalid's cousin, his successor. Umar's first move was to relieve Khalid from supreme command of Muslim Forces and appoint Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah {{as the new}} {{commander}} in chief of the Islamic army. Khalid had become a trial of disbelief (because of his undefeated wars) for the Muslims as they had attributed the wins of battles to the personality and figure of Khalid; Umar was reported as saying:"I did not fire Khalid ibn al Waleed because I am angry with him or because of betrayal of trust or responsibility but the reason was just that I wanted people to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> Allah who gives victory". This resulted in the dismissal of Khalid from supreme command and later in 638, from military services. Khalid, gave a pledge of loyalty to the new caliph and continued service as an ordinary commander under Abu Ubaidah. He is reported to have said: ...|$|E
500|$|Garnet {{was not at}} {{all like}} Catesby, {{described}} by Fraser as possessing the mentality [...] "of the crusader who does not hesitate to employ the sword in the cause of values which he considers are spiritual". In contrast, Garnet believed that [...] "things were best settled by submission to the will of God." [...] He was ebullient over King James's succession to the English throne, and hoped there would be no foreign interference. Of the 1603 Bye Plot, revealed (with his blessing) to the Privy Council by two Catholic priests, he wrote that it was [...] "a piece of impudent folly, for we <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> by peaceful means that his Holiness and other princes are prepared to help us." [...] He exhorted that Pope Clement VIII instruct all English Catholics not to engage in violent rebellion, [...] "quiete et pacifice". [...] It was a message echoed by Archpriest George Blackwell, who commanded his priests never to attempt any such thing, but it proved controversial; early in summer 1605 Garnet reported to Rome that English Catholics had reached [...] "a stage of desperation".|$|E

500|$|Set {{primarily}} on a beach, the accompanying music video for [...] "5,6,7,8" [...] opens with Latchford-Evans and Watkins riding quad bikes {{along the beach}} while Scott-Lee, Tozer and Richards driving a car on the road next to them, with close-ups {{of each of the}} female singers performing the chorus. It is followed by a repetition of the chorus whereby all of the members perform a line dancing routine, which was very popular {{at the time of its}} release, to the music outside a bar on the beach. Latchford, with Watkins walking slightly behind him from the beach to the bar, performs the first verse where the chorus and dance routine is once again repeated. The second verse features clips of Latchford singing while playing a game of snooker while Watkins plays on the table football. For the final chorus, the group perform the dance routine for a final time, however the setting has changed to night time and inside a different bar. The official music video has achieved 14.8 million views on YouTube as of August 2017. [...] "5,6,7,8" [...] was included on Steps sixth concert tour, The Ultimate Tour, in 2012. Latchford-Evans has since stated that the band does not like performing the song, but they find new ways of performing it live as they <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a fan-favourite.|$|E

2500|$|The essays of Paul Graham explore similar themes, {{such as a}} {{conceptual}} hierarchy of computer languages, with more expressive and succinct languages at the top. Thus, the so-called blub paradox (after a hypothetical programming language of average complexity called Blub) says that anyone preferentially using some particular programming language will <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> more powerful than some, but not that it is less powerful than others. The reason is that writing in some language means thinking in that language. Hence the paradox, because typically programmers are [...] "satisfied with whatever language they happen to use, because it dictates the way they think about programs".|$|E

In fact, in our embassy we received hundreds of messages of such kind. As far as I understand the nature of the case has been that the wife of the gentleman has registered a lawsuit against her husband. And then the Government of Afghanistan has nothing to do in it. It's a legal and judicial case. But I hope that through our constitutional process there will be a satisfactory result out of that process."

2500|$|As {{the novel}} became popular, the reviews became {{positive}}; Crawford Woods, also in The New York Times, wrote a positive review countering Lehmann-Haupt's negative review: {{the novel is}} [...] "a custom-crafted study of paranoia, a spew from the 1960s and — in all its hysteria, insolence, insult and rot — a desperate and important book, a wired nightmare, the funniest piece of American prose"; and [...] "this book is such a mind storm that we may need {{a little time to}} <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> also literature[...] [...] it unfolds a parable of the nineteen-sixties {{to those of us who}} lived in them in a mood — perhaps more melodramatic than astute — of social strife, surreal politics and the chemical feast." [...] About Thompson, Woods said he [...] "trusts the authority of his senses, and the clarity of a brain poised between brilliance and burnout".|$|E
2500|$|Campbell, however, {{had little}} luck {{overcoming}} the tremendous antipathy toward Mulroney, despite a substantial bounce from the leadership convention. Chrétien saw an opportunity, and on September 19, released the entire Liberal platform. The 112-page document, Creating Opportunity, quickly {{became known as}} the Red Book because of its bright red cover. It was a very specific and detailed statement of exactly what a Chrétien government would do in office. The Red Book gave the Liberals the reputation as the party with ideas, since none of the other parties had anything comparable. Paul Martin, the man who led the team that produced the Red Book was less complimentary about the Red Book in private as during his time in office as Finance Minister, he was often reported to have said: [...] "Don't tell me about the Red Book, I wrote the damn thing, and I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a lot of crap!".|$|E

[...] Even the Stars commented that [...] "the James faithful are split down the middle on Wah Wah. Those with a predilection for the big hit singles turn their nose up at it, but those who dig a little deeper <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> the real James baring their artistic soul, opening up their creative process to outside scrutiny - raw, real and putting everything out on the line. It's a fascinating insight into the workings of the band egged on by one of the most inventive writers and producers of the generation - a completely unique record and typical of James' contrary approach at times." ...|$|E
2500|$|The title {{refers to}} a passage {{about the end of}} the world from the Book of Revelation, used both at the very start of the film, and again towards the end, {{beginning}} with the words [...] "And when the Lamb had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour" [...] (Revelation 8:1). Thus, in the confessional scene the knight states: [...] "Is it so cruelly inconceivable to grasp God with the senses? Why should He hide himself in a mist of half-spoken promises and unseen miracles?...What is going to happen to those of us who want to believe but aren't able to?" [...] Death, impersonating the confessional priest, refuses to reply. Similarly, later, as he eats the strawberries with the family of actors, Antonius Block says: [...] "Faith is a torment – did you <b>know</b> <b>that?</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> like loving someone who is out there in the darkness but never appears, no matter how loudly you call." [...] Bragg notes that the concept of the [...] "Silence of God" [...] in the face of evil, or the pleas of believers or would-be-believers, may be influenced by the punishments of silence meted out by Bergman's father, a chaplain in the State Lutheran Church. Interestingly, in Bergman's original radio play sometimes translated as A Painting on Wood, the figure of Death in a Dance of Death is represented not by an actor, but by silence, [...] "mere nothingness, mere absence...terrifying...the void." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wu Zetian {{was born}} into a rich family. She had {{servants}} at her disposal to perform routine tasks for her, so there were not many domestic jobs that Wu would ever have to learn. Because of this, Wu was encouraged by her father to read books and pursue her education. He made sure that his daughter was well-educated, a trait that was not common among women, much less encouraged by their fathers. Wu {{did not seem to be}} the type of child who would want to sit quietly and do needlework or sip tea all day. So Wu read and learned about many different topics such as politics and other governmental affairs, writing, literature, and music. Wu grew and continued to learn as much as she could, with her father backing her every step of the way. At age fourteen, she was taken to be an imperial concubine (lesser wife) of Emperor Taizong of Tang. It was there that she became a type of secretary. This opportunity allowed her to continue to pursue her education. She was given the title of cairen, title for one of the consorts with the fifth rank in Tang's nine-rank system for imperial officials, nobles, and consorts. When she was summoned to the palace, her mother, the Lady Yang, wept bitterly when saying farewell to her, but she responded, [...] "How do you <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not my fortune to meet the Son of Heaven?" [...] Lady Yang reportedly then understood her ambitions, and therefore stopped crying.|$|E
