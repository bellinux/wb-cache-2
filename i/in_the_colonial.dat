5|$|In {{a letter}} dated 12 June 1842 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Colonial</b> Secretary's Records, Marshall Clifton, Chief Commissioner of the Western Australian Land Company, {{wrote of the}} need for an {{improved}} Perth–Fremantle–Bunbury road. On a special trip he took in the previous October to look for a new route, two surveyors gave their approval to the proposed coastal route, with a ferry across the estuary. Governor John Hutt approved of the idea of a road, but thought a ferry would be impractical, at least during winter, and that the lack of public funds made it impossible. Clifton continued to write letters to the Colonial Secretary advocating the construction of a road.|$|E
