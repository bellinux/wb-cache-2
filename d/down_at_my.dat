500|$|Although Paul Oscar's family {{encouraged}} {{his musical}} talent, his {{parents did not}} get along with each other, and he was bullied by his schoolmates. Paul Oscar recalled: [...] "My nickname was Little Palli, and Palli was chubby, nerdy, someone who never got jokes right, who was afraid of other men." [...] At age 13, {{he realized that he}} found men attractive, and came out to his [...] family at 16. [...] "For the first day, there was nice talk of acceptance, though my father did raise his voice. On the second day, and the third, and the fourth, there was this terrible silence. They treated me like an alien." [...] However, his mother was supportive. She said: [...] "If Páll has the talent to fall in love, he should nurture that talent. And he has as much a right to sit <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> table with his partner as anybody else does with their partner." ...|$|E
500|$|Paul McCartney said {{he came up}} {{with the}} title [...] "The Long and Winding Road" [...] during one of his first visits to his {{property}} High Park Farm, near Campbeltown in Scotland, which he purchased in June 1966. The phrase was inspired by the sight of a road [...] "stretching up into the hills" [...] in the remote Highlands surroundings of lochs and distant mountains. He wrote the song at his farm in 1968, inspired by the growing tension among the Beatles. Based on other comments McCartney has made, author Howard Sounes writes, the lyrics can be seen as McCartney expressing his anguish at the direction his personal life was taking in the autumn of 1968, after he had separated from his fiancée Jane Asher, as well as a nostalgic look back at the Beatles' history. McCartney recalled: [...] "I just sat <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> piano in Scotland, started playing and came up with that song, imagining {{it was going to be}} done by someone like Ray Charles. I have always found inspiration in the calm beauty of Scotland and again it proved the place where I found inspiration." ...|$|E
2500|$|We could {{occasionally}} imitate Jay's {{singing and}} insert our own words: 'It gets real hot working <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> mom's bookstore.' It {{was a little}} too much to hear these songs about coal miners coming from regular dudes that worked in record stores and bought SST Records and went to Black Flag shows. Three songs, the gospel tune [...] "Warfare", the hymn [...] "Satan, Your Kingdom Must Come Down" [...] and the ballad [...] "I Wish My Baby Was Born" [...] were taken from High Atmosphere, a compilation of songs recorded by John Cohen in Virginia and North Carolina. Along with Ogan's version of [...] "Coalminers", the murder ballad [...] "Lilli Schull" [...] had previously been released on Oh My Little Darling, a compilation of Southeastern folk song types released on New World Records.|$|E

6000|$|... "Bravo, Babbalanja!" [...] cried Media, [...] "your iceberg is thawing. More of that, more of that. Did I not say, {{we would}} melt him <b>down</b> <b>at</b> last, <b>my</b> lord?" ...|$|R
60|$|She laughed, {{and jumping}} to the ground, sat <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> {{side on the}} grass.|$|E
60|$|He lies <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> feet, {{stretches}} {{himself out}} as if to sleep, and with a plaintive cry, is dead.|$|E
60|$|I arose late, and sat <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> desk, {{trying to}} summon energy enough {{to write to}} Mr. Playmore--and trying in vain.|$|E
60|$|Yet I {{have promised}} and must keep my word. So sit <b>down</b> here <b>at</b> <b>my</b> feet and rest your bright {{head on my}} lap, that I may not see in your young eyes the shadows my story will bring across their bonny blue.|$|R
60|$|The tinkle of the traveller's bells, after growing louder, {{had faded}} away quickly, and the tumult of barking {{dogs in the}} village had calmed <b>down</b> <b>at</b> last. <b>My</b> uncle, {{lounging}} {{in the corner of}} a small couch, smoked his long Turkish chibouk in silence.|$|R
6000|$|... "Where is it, Mr. Brown, {{where is}} it? Can you stand? Can you walk? Allow me {{to support you}} to the bank. You can get a seat there; we must sit <b>down</b> <b>at</b> once. <b>My</b> dear sir, {{the first thing is}} to get you to a {{comfortable}} seat." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never!" [...] {{answered}} Proserpina, {{looking as}} miserable as she could. [...] "I shall never smile again till you set me <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> mother's door." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, of course, Captain Griffiths," [...] she said. [...] "Mr. Lessingham was {{at college}} with my brother, {{and one of}} his best friends. He has shot <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> father's place in Cheshire." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a {{delightful}} plan," [...] he said. [...] "I {{advise you to}} go to the Duke's Head in Covent Garden, an easy, informal, old-fashioned place, and I'll have you put <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> club." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What!' {{cried the}} sly Titty, 'they are coming with great pomp to fetch you, {{and you are}} not afraid to show {{yourself}} to so many fine lords and ladies with your hair down like that? Get <b>down</b> <b>at</b> once, <b>my</b> poor child, and let me dress your hair for you!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} odd if you did, for she lives at Littlebath, and hardly ever comes to town. When she does, she stays <b>down</b> <b>at</b> Hadley with <b>my</b> uncle." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good night, mother," [...] and I went up {{and slammed}} my door upon her, blew out my candle, and lay <b>down</b> <b>at</b> once upon <b>my</b> bed, lay {{there a long time}} before I got up to undress.|$|R
6000|$|... "Captain," [...] he said--for {{although}} Reuben had {{no right}} to that title, he was always so called by the settlers--"the blacks have been <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> place. They have killed my two shepherds, and driven off the sheep." ...|$|E
60|$|An hour {{may have}} passed, perhaps more, when I was interrupted. I {{heard the door}} softly opened, and light {{footsteps}} crossed the room to my side. Isobel's hand rested on my shoulder, and she looked <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> work.|$|E
60|$|DEAR OLD JOE,--It was {{a mighty}} good letter, Joe--and that idea of yours is a {{rattling}} good one. But I have not sot {{down here to}} answer your letter,--for it is <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> study,--but only to impart some information.|$|E
6000|$|... "If," [...] he said, [...] "I {{were to take}} pen {{and paper}} and write <b>down,</b> <b>at</b> this moment, <b>my</b> {{conclusions}} so far as I {{have been able to}} form any, I fancy that they would make evil reading. Permit me!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But if {{you think}} that there is no mistake, if your {{opponent}} is undoubtedly about to proceed to extremities, shoot him <b>down</b> <b>at</b> once, <b>my</b> dear lad, before he has time to draw. I have heard those who have been out there say that in such cases everything depends upon getting the first shot. I am anxious about you, and shall not be easy until I see you again." ...|$|R
5|$|I King Æthelstan, {{declare that}} I {{have learned that}} the public peace has not been kept to the extent, either of my wishes, or of the {{provisions}} laid <b>down</b> <b>at</b> Grately, and <b>my</b> councillors say that I have suffered this too long.|$|R
6000|$|... “I {{should not}} wonder {{but she was}} false, indeed,” thought he. “Why else should she be so cast <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> release? But I will show her I am not the man to be fooled. I will catch her in the act.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is rather}} a long way," [...] she {{reminded}} him. [...] "I am <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> old rooms again. The house in Russell Square {{is full of}} workmen, after the fire." [...] "It does not matter how far," [...] he said simply.|$|E
60|$|I sat <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> desk; I hid {{my face in}} {{my hands}} to keep out all {{impressions}} of external and present things; and I searched back through the mysterious labyrinth of the Past, through the dun, ever-deepening twilight of the years that were gone.|$|E
60|$|Later.--Glad I {{made the}} resolution, gladder that I kept to it. I had lain tossing about, and {{had heard the}} clock strike only twice, when the night {{watchman}} came to me, sent up from the ward, to say that Renfield had escaped. I threw on my clothes and ran <b>down</b> <b>at</b> once. <b>My</b> patient is too dangerous a person to be roaming about. Those ideas of his might work out dangerously with strangers.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sometimes I like poor places best," [...] said Lady Lufton. Then {{there was}} a pause, after which Lady Lufton {{addressed}} herself to Grace, seeking some subject for immediate conversation. [...] "You have been <b>down</b> <b>at</b> Allington, <b>my</b> dear, have you not?" [...] Grace, in a whisper, said that she had. [...] "Staying with the Dales, I believe? I know the Dales well by name, and I have always heard that they are charming people." ...|$|R
60|$|The ship {{remained}} in Prince's Dock over six weeks; but as I {{do not mean}} to present a diary of my stay there, I shall here simply record the general tenor of the life led by our crew during that interval; and will then proceed to note <b>down,</b> <b>at</b> random, <b>my</b> own wanderings about town, and impressions of things as they are recalled to me now, after the lapse of so many years.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should not}} wonder {{but she was}} false, indeed," [...] thought he. [...] "Why else should she be so cast <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> release? But I will show her I am not the man to be fooled. I will catch her in the act." ...|$|E
60|$|For {{a little}} while I stood gazing <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> work, my mind full of the {{unsolvable}} mysteries of life and death; then I bethought me that time stood not still for me, and that something yet remained to be accomplished ere my evening's task were done.|$|E
6000|$|As I {{told him}} he looked <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> water-soaked form and wild-eyed countenance with gentle patience. Then he peered out over my head into the dismal night.

5000|$|Reaction in the British {{press has}} been positive: ...opera is, in fact, {{managing}} to find new audiences, all over the world. <b>Down</b> <b>at</b> the Ritzy, <b>my</b> local cinema in Brixton, London, I've been able, since December, to see live broadcasts from the Metropolitan Opera in New York...|$|R
6000|$|The Baroness {{looked at}} the family, who held their heads <b>down,</b> and then <b>at</b> <b>my</b> lord, but this time without any dislike.

[...] To which remark my lord only bowed.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Sleep over it--it is {{the best}} plan--and write to-morrow. Meantime, go there to that window and sit <b>down,</b> and look <b>at</b> <b>my</b> Humanity Show.
