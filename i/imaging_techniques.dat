5|$|Although {{the human}} brain {{represents}} only 2% of the body weight, it receives 15% of the cardiac output, 20% of total body oxygen consumption, and 25% of total body glucose utilization. The brain mostly uses glucose for energy, and deprivation of glucose, as can happen in hypoglycemia, can result in loss of consciousness. The energy consumption of the brain does not vary greatly over time, but active regions of the cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions: this fact forms {{the basis for the}} functional brain imaging methods PET and fMRI. These functional <b>imaging</b> <b>techniques</b> provide a three-dimensional image of metabolic activity.|$|E
5|$|Causes include falls, vehicle collisions, and violence. Brain trauma {{occurs as}} a {{consequence}} of a sudden acceleration or deceleration within the cranium or by a complex combination of both movement and sudden impact. In addition to the damage caused at the moment of injury, a variety of events in the minutes to days following the injury may result in secondary injury. These processes include alterations in cerebral blood flow and the pressure within the skull. Some of the <b>imaging</b> <b>techniques</b> used for diagnosis include computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs).|$|E
5|$|Electron {{holography}} is an {{imaging technique}} that photographically records the electron interference pattern of an object, {{which is then}} reconstructed to yield a greatly magnified image of the original object. This technique was developed to enable greater resolution in electron microscopy than is possible using conventional <b>imaging</b> <b>techniques.</b> The resolution of conventional electron microscopy is not limited by electron wavelength, but by the large aberrations of electron lenses.|$|E

5|$|<b>Imaging</b> <b>techniques,</b> such as x-ray, {{fluoroscopy}} and ultrasound {{are typically}} {{used to help}} guide {{the placement of the}} applicators to their correct positions and to further refine the treatment plan. CAT scans and MRI can also be used. Once the applicators are inserted, they are held in place against the skin using sutures or adhesive tape to prevent them from moving. Once the applicators are confirmed as being in the correct position, further imaging can be performed to guide detailed treatment planning.|$|E
5|$|Pancreatic cancer rarely occurs {{before the}} age of 40, {{and more than half of}} cases of {{pancreatic}} adenocarcinoma occur in those over 70. Risk factors for pancreatic cancer include tobacco smoking, obesity, diabetes, and certain rare genetic conditions. About 25% of cases are linked to smoking, and 5â€“10% are linked to inherited genes. Pancreatic cancer is usually diagnosed by a combination of medical <b>imaging</b> <b>techniques</b> such as ultrasound or computed tomography, blood tests, and examination of tissue samples (biopsy). The disease is divided into stages, from early (stageI) to late (stageIV). Screening the general population has not been found to be effective.|$|E

5|$|Diagnosis of CSF leak can be {{done through}} various <b>imaging</b> <b>techniques,</b> {{chemical}} tests of bodily fluid discharged from a head orifice, or by a clinical examination. The use of CT, MRI, and assays {{are the most common}} types of CSF leak instrumental tests. Many CSF leaks do not show up on imaging and chemical assays, thus such diagnostic tools are not definitive to rule out CSF leaks. A clinician may often depend upon patient history and exam to diagnose, for example: discharge of excessive amount of clear fluid from the nose upon bending over, the increase in headache following a Valsalva maneuver or the reduction of headache when the patient takes a prone position are positive indicators.|$|E
5|$|Epileptic {{seizures}} {{are thought}} to relate to abnormal electrical activity. Seizure activity can manifest as absence (of consciousness), focal effects such as limb movement or impediments of speech, or be generalized in nature. Status epilepticus refers to a seizure or series of seizures that have not terminated within 30 minutes, although this definition has recently been revised. Seizures have {{a large number of}} causes, however many seizures occur without a definitive cause being found. In a person with epilepsy, risk factors for further seizures may include sleeplessness, drug and alcohol intake, and stress. Seizures may be assessed using blood tests, EEG and various medical <b>imaging</b> <b>techniques</b> based on the medical history and exam findings. In addition to treating an underlying cause and reducing exposure to risk factors, anticonvulsant medications can play a role in preventing further seizures.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{method of}} {{studying}} {{the brain is}} anatomical, and {{until the middle of}} the 20th century, much of the progress in neuroscience came from the development of better cell stains and better microscopes. Neuroanatomists study the large-scale structure of the brain as well as the microscopic structure of neurons and their components, especially synapses. Among other tools, they employ a plethora of stains that reveal neural structure, chemistry, and connectivity. In recent years, the development of immunostaining techniques has allowed investigation of neurons that express specific sets of genes. Also, functional neuroanatomy uses medical <b>imaging</b> <b>techniques</b> to correlate variations in human brain structure with differences in cognition or behavior.|$|E

This 3 D <b>imaging</b> <b>technique</b> allows for slices of the root and {{eliminates}} superimposition of structures.

Future studies using this <b>imaging</b> <b>technique</b> may provide more accurate insight into the severity and prevalence of root resorption of maxillary incisors while also providing information for mandibular incisors since there is currently no data available. These findings highlight the importance for proper informed consent of the potential risk and impact of OIEARR.|$|R

5|$|Neurophysiologists {{study the}} chemical, pharmacological, and {{electrical}} {{properties of the}} brain: their primary tools are drugs and recording devices. Thousands of experimentally developed drugs affect the nervous system, some in highly specific ways. Recordings of brain activity can be made using electrodes, either glued to the scalp as in EEG studies, or implanted inside the brains of animals for extracellular recordings, which can detect action potentials generated by individual neurons. Because the brain does not contain pain receptors, it is possible using these techniques to record brain activity from animals that are awake and behaving without causing distress. The same techniques have occasionally been used to study brain activity in human patients suffering from intractable epilepsy, in cases {{where there was a}} medical necessity to implant electrodes to localize the brain area responsible for epileptic seizures. Functional <b>imaging</b> <b>techniques</b> such as functional magnetic resonance imaging are also used to study brain activity; these techniques have mainly been used with human subjects, because they require a conscious subject to remain motionless for long periods of time, but they have the great advantage of being noninvasive.|$|E
