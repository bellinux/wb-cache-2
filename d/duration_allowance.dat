40|$|Beam {{preparation}} for the g- 2 experiment is studied. Because of limited 2. 5 -MHz rf voltage and the 66 -ms limited time <b>duration</b> <b>allowance</b> for the whole process, the Booster batch must be first captured to a lower 2. 5 -MHz rf voltage followed by a rotation in the 2. 5 -MHz bucket {{in order to achieve}} the required narrow half bunch width of 50 ns. The appearance of bunch tails can be reduced by first rotation by a linear barrier voltage before the adiabatic capture...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Real-time {{dimensioning}} {{depends on}} the Worst Case Execution Time (WCET) of its tasks. Using estimated WCETs for the dimensioning is less conservative but execution overruns {{are more likely to}} happen. Fault tolerant mechanisms must be implemented to preserve the real-time system from timing failures, associated to late task termination deadlines misses, in the case of WCETs overruns. We show in this article how to compute the extra <b>duration</b> (<b>allowance)</b> on the WCETs that can be given to faulty tasks while still preserving all the deadline constraints of the tasks. This allowance is used on-line to tolerate WCET overruns. We present a mechanism called the Latest Execution Time (LET) using the allowance of the tasks for the temporal robustness of real-time systems. This mechanism only requires classical timers. Its benefits are presented {{in the context of a}} java virtual machine meeting the Real-Time Specification for Java (RTSJ) with estimated WCETs. Real-time System; fault tolerance; estimated WCET; allowance; slack time; temporal robustness I...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the dynamics}} of the <b>duration</b> of housing <b>allowance</b> claims in Sweden during the period 1991 to 2002. The central concern in this paper is whether the Swedish housing allowance system creates dependence on welfare. Using longitudinal data from Swedish micro database-LINDA, this paper found that {{there is no evidence of}} negative duration dependence arising from the <b>duration</b> of housing <b>allowance</b> claims. This finding is consistent across different model specifications and various controls of the heterogeneity issue. Hence we come to the conclusion that a recipient 9 ̆ 2 s exit rate from the system does not decrease over the duration claim. This paper also shows that the demographic characteristics, educational background, labour market status and economic contextual conditions play important roles in determining recipients 9 ̆ 2 conditional probability of exiting from the housing allowance system. However, there are substantial variations in the factors 9 ̆ 2 impact across different household types...|$|R
40|$|The Honorable Richard A. Posner {{discusses}} the dangers {{presented by the}} propertization of intellectual property rights, particularly {{in the areas of}} copyright and patent. Unlike physical property, intellectual property rights are limited by <b>duration,</b> scope, and <b>allowance</b> of fair use. These limitations underlie the existence of a rich public domain that encourages the most valuable uses of intellectual property by reducing transaction costs and encouraging the creation of additional creative works...|$|R
5000|$|... social measures: the Commission {{proposed}} the governments to temporarily increase unemployment benefits and their <b>duration,</b> to increase <b>allowances</b> to households, to lower taxes on low incomes, to lower {{social security contributions}} paid on low wages by employers, to reduce labour costs paid by employees with low incomes, to provide subsidised loans or credit guarantees for companies, to reduce temporarily the VAT rate to support consumption. The Commission announced it would adopt by mid-March 2009 a proposal to lower VAT rates for services with high labour-intensiveness (such as catering).|$|R
40|$|The Czech Republic is {{a country}} with a strong {{attachment}} of women to the labor market, but with one of the longest paid family leaves, which is often followed by a spell of unemployment. Using a difference-in-differences methodology, we study the impact of two reforms of the duration of the parental allowance on the labor market status of mothers 2 - 7 years after childbirth. While the 1995 reform prolonged the allowance from 3 to 4 years, the 2008 reform allowed some parents to shorten the <b>duration</b> of the <b>allowance</b> to only 2 or 3 years with an equivalent total monetary amount. We find that in response to the 1995 reform, 36 % of mothers extended their family leave beyond the 3 -year job protection period. The 2008 reform partially reversed this effect. Both reforms also had a considerable impact on post-leave unemployment and inactivity of mothers...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of the present study}} were to evaluate the effects of increasing space in transportation at different distances, on live weight loss in pigs and {{to determine the effects of}} fasting and pre-slaughter lairage period on both live and carcass weights by sex and on pork quality. Seven hundred and twenty pigs Pietrain x (YorkshirexLandrace) were divided into two experimental conditions (EC 1 and EC 2). EC 1 pigs were divided in three groups of 120 animals each and were transported for 8, 16 and 24 h (loading density: 0. 35 m 2 / 100 kg). EC 2 pigs were divided in three groups of 120 animals, the transport duration was the same as in EC 1 (loading density: 0. 68 m 2 / 100 kg). Transport <b>duration</b> and space <b>allowance</b> significantly affected (p< 0. 01) the posture of the pigs on arrival to the slaughterhouse; there were significant differences (p< 0. 01) between genders. When transport time was shorter, a higher number of pigs arrived in a standing posture, more females arrived in a standing position in the group shipped for 8 h. Pig position affected carcass yield, when transportation time was shorter carcass yield was higher. There was a higher percentage (p< 0. 01) of pigs at pH 5. 8 - 6. 2 in animals transported for 8 h, compared with 16 and 24 h period, independently of the space allowance. Additional space provided to pigs during transportation lead to a better animal welfare in transit and had no decisive influence in the quality of the carcass; nevertheless, the quality of meat improved...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject matter}} of {{bachelor}} thesis is focused on social problems of the Holštýnsko region citizens and assessment of those problems {{according to the law}} on aid in material distress. In the theoretical part the basic aspects of social policy, poverty, poverty management and legal regulations of the issue are outlined. The objective of the thesis was to give an overview of the structure of aid in material distress recipients in the region and to identify the effectiveness as well as the use of activation measures of the Act No. 111 / 2006 Coll. towards applicants for aid in material distress. Both quantitative and qualitative research was used to achieve the stated objectives of this thesis. For data collection in the quantitative research the chosen method was questioning, the technique of guided interview with 51 recipients of aid in material distress. The responses were analyzed and presented in the thesis by using graphs and tables. Within the secondary data analysis I focused on the social status of respondents, their age, unemployment <b>duration,</b> the living <b>allowance</b> period and education of respondents. On the basis of the stated objectives 2 hypotheses were set up. Hypothesis 1 assumed that most recipients of aid in material distress have only primary education. This hypothesis was not confirmed. In the Holýšov region most people affected by material distress are people with secondary vocational education holding a vocational certificate. Hypothesis 2 assumed that the concept of public service has not brought the effects expected. This hypothesis was confirmed both by the result of interviewing the recipients of aid in material distress, and by the results obtained from interviews with representatives of local authorities. In the qualitative research the method of questioning was used, the half standardized interview with nine representatives of local authorities. Due to the research used the hypothesis was set {{up at the end of}} the research. Hypothesis 3 : The rise of unemployment will make local representatives establish a public service institute. The results of the thesis can be used to increase the awareness of the public as well as of local representatives on activation instruments according to the law on aid in material distress and on possibilities for citizens to obtain aid in the case of insufficient incomes. They may also serve as a source of information about the problem of providing aid in material distress for the Municipal Authority Holýšov and the Regional Authority of the Plzeň Region...|$|R
