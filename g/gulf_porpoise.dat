5000|$|The vaquita ( [...] ; Phocoena sinus) is a {{rare species}} of {{porpoise}} endemic to {{the northern part of}} the Gulf of California. The word vaquita is Spanish for [...] "little cow". Other names include cochito (Spanish for [...] "little car"), desert porpoise, vaquita porpoise, Gulf of California harbor porpoise, Gulf of California porpoise, and <b>gulf</b> <b>porpoise.</b> Since the baiji (Lipotes vexillifer) is believed to have gone extinct in 2006, the vaquita has taken on the title of the most endangered cetacean in the world. It has been listed as critically endangered since 1996. The population was estimated at 600 in 1997, below 100 in 2014, approximately 60 in 2015 and approximately 30 in November 2016, leading to the conclusion that the species will soon be extinct unless drastic action is taken.|$|E
5000|$|... Dolphins in the Persian Gulf: At {{least ten}} species of {{cetacean}} {{have been identified}} in the Persian Gulf, but most of these are considered vagrant or seasonal visitor. Only two species of dolphin, the Indo-Pacific humpback (Sousa chinensis) and the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus) are thought to be common residents of the <b>Gulf.</b> The finless <b>porpoise</b> (Neophocoena phocaenoides) is thought to be an uncommon resident.|$|R
40|$|The recent likely {{extinction}} of the baiji (Chinese river dolphin [Lipotes vexillifer]) (Turvey et al. 2007) makes the vaquita (<b>Gulf</b> of California <b>porpoise</b> [Phocoena sinus]) the most endangered cetacean. The vaquita has the smallest range of any porpoise, dolphin, or whale and, like the baiji, {{has long been}} threatened primarily by accidental deaths in fishing gear (bycatch) (Rojas-Bracho et al. 2006). Despite repeated recommendations from scientific bodies and conservation organizations, no effective actions {{have been taken to}} remove nets from the vaquitaâ€™s environment. Here, we address three questions that are important to vaquita conservation: (1) How many vaquitas remain? (2) How much time is left to find a solution to the bycatch problem? and (3) Are further abundance surveys or bycatch estimates needed to justify the immediate removal of all entangling nets from the range of the vaquita? Our answers are, in short: (1) there are about 150 vaquitas left, (2) there are at most 2 years within which to find a solution, and (3) further abundance surveys or bycatch estimates are not needed. The answers to the first two questions make clear that action is needed now, whereas the answer to the last question removes the excuse of uncertainty as a delay tactic. Herein we explain our reasoning...|$|R
