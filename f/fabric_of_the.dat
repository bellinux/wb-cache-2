5|$|Millions {{of years}} ago, creatures known as Sarnathians ruled the Earth, {{centring}} their values on torture of other creatures that {{were opposed to}} their rule. Their aim was to rule the universe using a mysterious orb that granted them great power. Thousands of years later, the orb became too powerful and eventually caused a tear in the inter-dimensional <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Realm of Reality and the Realm of Unreality, thus rendering the Sarnathians extinct.|$|E

5|$|As of 2005, the {{building}} still retained {{a number of}} original features, including its gold brocade seats, wall friezes, cornices, and ceiling roses. However, the <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building remained in a poor state of repair, and in January 2008 it was announced once again that {{the building}} was to be demolished, and scaffolding was erected at the front in preparation. The building, once considered amongst the most iconic in Manchester, was not regarded as architecturally interesting, and was demolished {{in the spring of}} 2008.

5|$|Bellew's Gartership also {{witnessed}} {{changes to}} the <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> College of Arms. Although it had survived the Blitz, structural problems with the roof and brickwork forced the heralds to decide between leaving the College's buildings on Queen Victoria Street or attempting expensive repairs. In 1954, they approached the Ministry of Works to ask for financial assistance in the building work; the Ministry agreed to cover half the cost. A successful public appeal for the remaining funds followed and the restoration work carried out. The College of Arms Trust was established in 1956 to oversee funds for the building's maintenance.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War {{the temple}} {{was used as}} a post for Air Raid Precautions wardens. It was given Grade I listed status in September 1952 and became part of a {{conservation}} area in the 1960s, when it was used for poetry readings. However, it had become neglected and vandalised by the 1970s. It suffered from wet and dry rot, vibrations from traffic on the busy nearby road had damaged the <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building and thieves had stolen the lead off the roof. Donald Insall Associates, a specialist conservation architectural firm, was commissioned by Richmond upon Thames Council to restore the building at a cost of £37,000. The work was carried out by the building firm Gostling and the architect James Lindus Forge. Patrick Baty advised on the paint colours.|$|E

5|$|During {{this time}} the church at Llanbadarn Fawr {{gradually}} declined, as the population of Aberystwyth dramatically outgrew the original settlement, {{and more and more}} chapels of ease became independent parish churches. By the mid-nineteenth century the <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church had also deteriorated {{to such an extent that}} serious remedial work was deemed necessary. Unfortunately, although necessary, this work also swept away much of the detail of the interior of the church. Today, apart from the Celtic crosses and the baptismal font there is nothing mediaeval or even early modern; most of what is visible today is nineteenth century, apart from the structure of the church, and some earlier monuments.|$|E
5|$|In response, English Heritage and Doncaster Metropolitan Borough Council {{formed a}} {{three-way}} agreement in 1988 with the Ivanhoe Trust, a local charity designed to generate new {{employment in the}} region. Under this agreement the trust would manage the site, English Heritage would maintain the historic <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> castle, while the council would construct a new visitors' centre. A new, controversial visitor's centre {{was built in the}} style of a collection of jousting tents, while the floors and roof of the keep were reinstalled between 1993 and 1995 with European Union funding, in an attempt to limit the erosion of the castle stonework.|$|E
5|$|Local {{architect}} Thomas Bower performed some alterations to {{the house}} for Robert Crewe-Milnes in 1896, including extending the service wing. Few changes to the hall itself occurred during Calmic's tenancy. The company installed central heating in around 1948, and later constructed an office extension {{on the north side}} of the house, which was demolished a few years after the building's conversion into an hotel. Calmic had undertaken only cosmetic maintenance work, and by the 1970s the <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building was in poor repair. A major stonework fall from the north gable during high winds in 1974 led Wellcome to carry out an extensive restoration programme to both the interior and the exterior, which was completed in 1979 at a cost of £500,000 (£ today).|$|E

5|$|Show creator Daniel Knauf {{believed}} Carnivàles religious aspects {{stemmed from}} the epic {{of good and evil}} as a major <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1930s, while executive producer Ronald D. Moore regarded religion as a way to express the struggle of good versus evil, faith, and the nature of humanity. Neither the audience nor the actors were given advice on how to interpret the show's biblical imagery. Clancy Brown, the actor who portrayed Brother Justin, did not know whether his character was the Creature of Light or Darkness during the first season. He however thought that the visions made Brother Justin believe to be on a righteous mission of God until late in the first season. Compared to Brother Justin, Brown stated he practiced religion in moderate ways.|$|E
5|$|The {{exterior}} of the building, with arches, pilasters, garlands and ornaments, which is visible from Beauford Square, was designed by George Dance the Younger who also designed the decorative sections of the interior. The main <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building was by John Palmer, who supervised the construction. The ceiling was decorated with panels from Fonthill Splendens, a mile from Fonthill Abbey, which were painted by Andrea Casali and donated to the theatre by Paul Cobb Methuen. Because of the potential damage from the gas lights, which were installed in 1827, the paintings were moved by William Blathwayt to Dyrham Park.|$|E
5|$|There are no {{traces of}} the <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{original}} clas church. Most buildings in the sixth century were of wood, wattle and daub. Even churches were wooden. Although the use of stone was not unknown elsewhere in Britain at this time, it was not used in Wales (it was rare anywhere in Britain until the eleventh century). Churches were also distinguished by their comparatively small size and simplicity. They tended to be under 40 feet long, with a single tall, aisleless nave, and with a small square chancel attached. They were often oratories, rather than full churches.|$|E

5|$|Those {{tending the}} {{furnaces}} were {{unaware that the}} heat from the fires had melted the copper lining of the flues and started a chimney fire. With the doors of the furnaces open, more oxygen was drawn into the furnaces, which ensured the fire burned more fiercely, and the flames driven further up the flues than they should have been. The flues had been weakened over time by having footholds cut in them by the child chimney sweeps. Although these footholds would have been repaired as the child exited on finishing the cleaning, the <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chimney was still weakened by the action. In October 1834 the chimneys had not yet had their annual sweep, and a considerable amount of clinker had built up inside the flues.|$|E
5|$|When Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk was {{executed}} for treason in 1554 his property {{was taken over}} by the monarch. In 1671 Thomas Preston, 3rd Baronet Preston bought Aldingham manor which included Gleaston Castle. The property descended through the Prestons to the Cavendish family. The castle is now part of an active farm which dates from the 19th century. The farm buildings incorporate some of the <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> castle. The Prestons owned the castle until 1922 when it was sold to the current family of owners. According to a 1905 document from the Cumbria Archive Centre up to four human skeletons were discovered at the castle in the 19th century when the farm buildings were built.|$|E
5|$|During the Queen's tenure {{much has}} been done, not only to restore and {{maintain}} the <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building, but also to transform it into a major British tourist attraction, containing {{a significant portion of}} the Royal Collection of art, which is managed from Windsor. Archaeological work has continued at the castle, following on from limited investigations in the 1970s, the work on the Round Tower from 1988–92 and the investigations following the 1992 fire. During 2007, 993,000 tourists visited the castle. This has had to be achieved in co-ordination with security issues and the castle's role as a working royal palace. In late 2011 two large water turbines were installed upstream of the castle on the River Thames to provide hydroelectric power to the castle and the surrounding estate. In April 2016 it was announced that the Royal Collection Trust is to fund a £27m project that will reinstate the original entrance hall of the castle to visitors, as well as a new cafe that will be housed in the 14th Century undercroft. The project will be completed at the end of 2018, and will include a visitor centre and a dedicated learning centre.|$|E
40|$|In {{production}} of garments, embroidery carries out {{a variety of}} functions, one <b>of</b> which is <b>the</b> aesthetic appearance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> product improvement. The resulting defects, {{are seen as a}} negative indicator <b>of</b> <b>the</b> product quality. <b>The</b> discrepancy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> embroidered element to the digital design in size is a defect, which is influenced by the embroidery threads, embroidery materials properties and process parameters.
