5|$|Quarrington was a rural {{community}} {{during the early}} and middle Anglo-Saxon period while mills along the River Slea in the Middle Ages gave the village its alternative name of Millthorpe. The Bishop of Lincoln and Ramsey Abbey held manors in Quarrington after the Norman Conquest, but the Carre family of Sleaford were the principal land-owners between 1559 and 1683, when its estate passed by marriage to the Marquesses of Bristol. Although the growth of Victorian Sleaford saw the town encroach into the parish's boundaries, the old village remained a small cluster of farm buildings and cottages for much of its history. The sale {{of most of the}} surrounding farmland by successive Marquesses of Bristol in the late 20th century led to the rapid development of residential estates on Quarrington Hill and in New Quarrington which have engulfed the original settlement. Low crime rates, affordable housing, high standards of living and access to <b>good</b> <b>schools</b> have attracted home-buyers to the area, contributing to a sharp rise in the population.|$|E
5|$|White middle-class Indiana women learned {{organizational}} skills through the suffrage and temperance movements. By the 1890s they were applying their new {{skills to the}} needs of their home communities, by organizing women's clubs, the combined literary activity with social activism focused on such needs as public health, sanitation, and <b>good</b> <b>schools.</b> Hoosier women worked at both {{the state and local level}} to materialize Progressive Era reforms. In Lafayette, for example, the suffragists concentrated in the Lafayette Franchise League, while those oriented toward social concerns worked through the Lafayette Charity Organization Society (LCOS), the Free Kindergarten and Industrial School Association (FKISA), and the Martha Home. Albion Fellows Bacon led statewide and national efforts at housing reform. A native of Evansville, Bacon worked to pass tenement and housing legislation in Indiana in 1909, 1913, and 1917. She also held leadership roles in Indiana Child Welfare Association; the Child Welfare Committee, a part of the Women's Section of the Indiana State Council of Defense; the Indiana Conference of Charities and Corrections, and the Juvenile Advisory Commission of Indiana's Probation Department. Women in Indiana would officially gain the right to vote in 1920 when the 19th Amendment is ratified for the United States constitution.|$|E

30|$|Results {{show that}} the {{probability}} of matching with a bad school is always greater than the probability of matching with a <b>good</b> <b>school</b> for teachers originating from bad schools. This is not very surprising. It is attributable to higher rates of transfer at bad schools, leading to more vacancies, and fewer teachers of all types searching for positions at bad schools, leading to less competition for these positions. Table 4 also shows that the probability of finding a match increases with experience level and with originating from a <b>good</b> <b>school.</b> For matching with a <b>good</b> <b>school,</b> originating from a <b>good</b> <b>school</b> dominates experience level. To match with a bad school, higher experience dominates school origin. These probabilities confirm the utility parameter results observed in Table 4, that <b>good</b> and bad <b>schools</b> have different priorities in recruiting teachers.|$|R

25|$|In 1999, the United States {{government}} began preparations to resettle an estimated 12,000 {{refugees from the}} Bantu minority ethnic group in Somalia to select cities throughout the United States. Most of the early arrivals in the United States settled in Clarkston, Georgia, a city adjacent to Atlanta. However, they were mostly assigned to low rent, poverty-stricken inner city areas, so many began to look to resettle elsewhere in the U.S.Word soon spread that Lewiston had a low crime rate, <b>good</b> <b>schools</b> and cheap housing. Somalis subsequently began a secondary migration from other states to the former mill town, and after 2005, many Bantus followed suit.|$|E

25|$|Biggeri and Mehrotra {{have studied}} the {{macroeconomic}} factors that encourage child labour. They focus their study on five Asian nations including India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Thailand and Philippines. They suggest that child labour {{is a serious problem}} in all five, {{but it is not a}} new problem. Macroeconomic causes encouraged widespread child labour across the world, over most of human history. They suggest that the causes for child labour include both the demand and the supply side. While poverty and unavailability of <b>good</b> <b>schools</b> explain the child labour supply side, they suggest that the growth of low-paying informal economy rather than higher paying formal economy is amongst the causes of the demand side. Other scholars too suggest that inflexible labour market, sise of informal economy, inability of industries to scale up and lack of modern manufacturing technologies are major macroeconomic factors affecting demand and acceptability of child labour.|$|E
