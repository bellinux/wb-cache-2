6000|$|The fat German nodded. [...] "It is the gambler's {{point of}} view. You people take with {{pleasure}} steep chances, as they say, but mine act not so. The system is better. One calculates beforehand {{what may happen}} and it is provided for. <b>If</b> <b>things</b> <b>do</b> not go as one expects, one labors to change them, and when this is not possible adopts an alternative plan." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>If</b> <b>things</b> <b>do</b> {{quiet down}} before my {{commission}} expires, I'll get leave of absence, run out to Forlorn River, marry my beautiful Spanish princess, {{and take her}} to a civilized country, where, I opine, every son of a gun who sees her will lose his head, and drive me mad. It's my great luck, old pal, {{that you are a}} fellow who never seemed to care about pretty girls. So you won't give me the double cross and run off with Mercedes--carry her off, like the villain in the play, I mean.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Clarkson's first {{idea was}} to consult Mr. Smithson; then he {{resolved}} to wait upon events. The idea was fantastic to begin with, but, <b>if</b> <b>things</b> <b>did</b> take such a satisfactory turn, {{he could not help}} reflecting {{that it would not be}} due to any efforts on the part of Mr. Smithson, and he would no longer be under any testamentary obligations to that enterprising gentleman.|$|R

This--this has shaken me a little. But I will not forget myself again. Only <b>if</b> <b>things</b> <b>do</b> not go as smoothly in {{the kitchen for a}} few days I hope you will make due allowance for me. At least," [...] said poor Susan, forcing a grim smile in a desperate effort to recover lost standing, [...] "at least flying is a clean job.

6000|$|Away, then, with discontent {{and anxiety}} {{for the coming}} year. Or rather, let us be only discontented with ourselves. Let us only be anxious about our own conduct. God cannot change. If {{anything}} goes wrong, it will be not because He has left us, but because we have left Him. Is it not written that all things work together for good to those who love God? Then <b>if</b> <b>things</b> <b>do</b> not work together for good in this coming year, {{it will be because}} we do not love God. Do not let us say, [...] "I am righteous, but my neighbours are wicked, and therefore I must be miserable;" [...] neither let us lay the blame of our misfortunes on our rulers; let us lay it on ourselves.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall be}} very glad," [...] he said, as they traversed {{the space that}} divided the town from the fort, [...] "when we have got over {{the next day or}} two, and have settled down a bit. It all seems so uncertain, and I have not the most remote idea of what our duties are likely to be. Hitherto, we have always had some {{definite}} plan of action, and had only ourselves to depend upon. Now, everything seems doubtful and uncertain. However, I suppose we shall soon settle down; and we have the satisfaction of knowing that, <b>if</b> <b>things</b> <b>do</b> not turn out well, we can go off to our good friend Pertaub, {{and get out of the}} place altogether." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, then, on {{the other}} hand," [...] said Albert, [...] "I should run some risk of {{embarrassing}} myself, <b>if</b> <b>things</b> <b>did</b> not turn out well. If I were to be sick, so that I could not attend to so much business, or if I should Jose any of my stock, or if the crops should not do well, then I might not get enough {{to pay back the}} debt." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll do what I can," [...] he promised. [...] "Mr. Ware isn't {{the first}} {{man in the world}} who has funked the limelight, and from what I can see of him it {{probably}} wasn't his fault <b>if</b> <b>things</b> <b>did</b> go a little crooked in the past. I'll do my best, Miss Dalstan, I promise you that. I'll look in at the club to-night and drop a few hints around." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We do {{not want}} to go there at all, but my husband will go to wind up his affairs, and sell his house there. We have been talking it over, and agree that we should never like {{to go back to the}} estate again. Even <b>if</b> <b>things</b> <b>did</b> quiet down the {{memories}} are too terrible; and, besides, having once broken out, the blacks might do so again at any time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{is going}} to be an awkward business, Wilfrid," [...] Mr. Atherton said. [...] "We have only thirty rounds of {{ammunition}} a man, and we have had nothing to eat for the last forty-eight hours but a mouthful of meat. We have suffered the natives to take the position we fixed on. We are outnumbered three to one, and there are not ten men in the force who have had any experience in fighting. If the worst comes to the worst, Wilfrid, do you and the Allens take to the bush. Mind, it is no use trying to run from the natives. If the men were all like our party the other day we could keep these fellows at bay for any time; but they are most of them young hands. They will blaze away their ammunition, and may be seized with a panic. I shall keep close to you, and <b>if</b> <b>things</b> <b>do</b> go badly we will keep together and sell our lives dearly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, well, Jean, {{we shall}} see what {{we shall see}}. You don't suppose that <b>if</b> <b>things</b> <b>do</b> not turn out well, as we hope they will do, I should let her carry out this whim of hers, and go off with the American, and leave me to shift for myself. Not such a fool. At present I say nothing. It is always better to hold your tongue {{as long as you}} can. I make him welcome when he comes to our house; we go {{together}} to the meetings, and sometimes he speaks, and speaks well, though he does not go far enough for us. Well, no one can say what may happen--he may be shot by the Germans, or he may be shot at the barricades, who knows. At any rate it is best to hold my peace. If I leave things alone, Minette is as likely as not to change her mind again, but if I were to say anything against him--first, we should have a scene; secondly, she would be more than ever determined on this whim. You must be patient, Jean, and all will come well in the end." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then, {{going back}} to her thoughts, she rambled on again; [...] "If {{he does n't take}} that hint, I will give him a {{stronger}} one, for I will not have matters come to a crisis, though I can't deny that my wicked vanity strongly tempts me to try and 'bag a bird' just for the excitement and credit of the thing. Polly, I 'm ashamed of you! What would your blessed mother say to hear such expressions from you? I 'd write and tell her all the worry, only it would n't do any good, and would only trouble her. I 've no right to tell Fan's secrets, and I 'm ashamed to tell mine. No, I 'll leave mother in peace, and fight it out alone. I do think Fan would suit him excellently by and by. He has known her all her life, and has a good influence over her. Love would do so much toward making her what she might be; it 's a shame to have the chance lost just because he happens to see me. I should think she 'd hate me; but I 'll show her that she need n't, and do all I can to help her; for she has been so good to me nothing shall ever make me forget that. It is a delicate and dangerous task, but I guess I can manage it; at any rate I 'll try, and have nothing to reproach myself with <b>if</b> <b>things</b> <b>do</b> go 'contrary.'" ...|$|E
60|$|The farmer gratefully {{accepted}} this offer of fellowship, and the appeals of his wife, who implored him {{to abandon the}} notion, were of no avail. Others had lighted the witches, and thereby secured a twelvemonth's immunity from harm, and why should not he go and do likewise?

50|$|In {{spite of}} being the most known village of Zselic, Ibafa is in trouble nowadays. The school and the parish church are closed (furthermore, the school {{building}} collapsed), many of the inhabitants are unemployed, there's no kindergarten, and the road is in a terrible condition.

5000|$|Straczynski {{also ran}} Jeremiah, {{loosely based on}} the Belgian post-apocalyptic comic of the same name, from 2002-2004. Straczynski ran the series for two seasons but was {{frustrated}} with the conflicting directions that MGM and Showtime wanted from the show, and even used the pseudonym [...] "Fettes Grey" [...] {{for the first time}} since Spiral Zone on one of the scripts. In the second season, Straczynski decided to leave the show <b>if</b> <b>things</b> <b>did</b> not improve, and the show ended after 2 seasons.|$|R
50|$|Readers {{would write}} in with {{problems}} pertaining to social nuances. A typical column would see someone {{concerned that they}} were being sent generic circulars by a friend, another expressing vexation with a friend who has decided to act in an eccentric manner upon retirement and ceased replying to dinner invitations. Letters would relate to which piece of cutlery to use, and how to hold it, and proper guest-host interaction. Morgan also addressed thornier subjects such as the handing back of engagement rings and wedding presents <b>if</b> <b>things</b> <b>did</b> not go to plan.|$|R
50|$|The {{third group}} {{consisted}} of the Millenarians and Sabbatarians, both of whom broke down into radical and more conservative wings. The conservative wing of this faction supported readmission with clauses built in {{that would make it}} possible for Jews to be thrown out <b>if</b> <b>things</b> <b>did</b> not go as planned. The radical wing argued that it was England's divine duty to readmit Jews, or else face God's wrath. Most members of this third faction hoped to convert Jews to Christianity upon their arrival in England, thereby hastening the second coming and the advent of the messianic age.|$|R
5000|$|... "Human beings do {{the best}} that they can.

50|$|The Lovers tend to {{be overly}} {{dramatic}} in whatever emotion they express. Separation from their lover leads them to strongly lament and moan their state, although, once they finally meet, they are at a loss of words. In order to express what they truly want to say, they always need {{the help of a}} servant to act as a go-between. The Lovers often act in a childlike and immature way. When not getting their way, they become completely devastated, they pout, and even cry and whine <b>if</b> <b>things</b> <b>do</b> not go according to their wishes. Very selfish and self-centered, the Lovers are in their own worlds in which they themselves are the most important subjects. Along with loving themselves, they are in love with the very idea of love and what it pertains to.|$|E
5000|$|At two o'clock, Scrooge {{meets the}} merry Ghost of Christmas Present, who shows Scrooge how others keep Christmas. At a church service, Fred and his fiancée, Bess, {{are seen as}} happy and in love. The couple must wait to marry because of Fred's {{financial}} circumstances, and the spirit observes that perhaps they will not marry at all and their love may end (just how Scrooge lost his unnamed fiancée in his youth). Scrooge is then shown the Cratchit home. Despite wearing a cheery manner for his family's sake, Bob is deeply troubled {{by the loss of}} his job (though he confides in no one except his daughter Martha). The spirit hints that Bob's youngest son, Timothy [...] "Tiny Tim", will die of his unknown illness by the same time next year <b>if</b> <b>things</b> <b>do</b> not change.|$|E
5000|$|Michael Phillips, in the Chicago Tribune, however, was {{not moved}} by the storytelling. He {{described}} his negativity saying [...] "Rescue Dawn is Herzog's first English-language screenplay, and {{this is part of}} its problem: The hushed conversations between prisoners sound only fitfully idiomatic. Also - crucially - Herzog can't {{find a way to make}} his own big finish feel authentic, even <b>if</b> <b>things</b> <b>did</b> happen roughly this way." [...] Critic Leonard Maltin though, wrote that Rescue Dawn was a [...] "Gripping reworking of Herzog's 1997 documentary Little Dieter Needs to Fly".

5000|$|Following their 59-21 loss {{to rival}} Kansas State, Kansas Athletic Director Sheahon Zenger, {{expressed}} his displeasure to the Jayhawks performance {{during the season}} in a press conference. In the press conference, Zenger said [...] "I don't expect any player, coach, administrator, fan or alum to accept the performance on the field today or in recent weeks. We will get this thing fixed. We will continue to evaluate the program on a week-by-week basis. At the University of Kansas, we will never make complete evaluations until the season is complete and the body of work is in." [...] Many local sports analysts interpreted that statement as Zenger officially putting head coach Turner Gill on the [...] "hotseat" [...] meaning he could be fired <b>if</b> <b>things</b> <b>do</b> not change. The day after losing KU's {{final game of the}} season to Missouri, Zenger fired Turner Gill who had a 5-19 record, 1-16 within the conference.

5000|$|Michael Roffman of {{the website}} Consequence of Sound, {{compared}} the video {{with the work}} by Madonna because of [...] "the hazy cinematography and the choir-like theatrics." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Kyle Anderson praised the video calling it a [...] "five minute technicolor blast" [...] and praised the fashion used in {{it as well as}} the references to Eyes Wide Shut. Andrew Martin of Prefix Magazine wasn't satisfied with the video saying [...] "the track's music video is still an over-the-top affair filled with Old World imagery and glitter-covered dresses and suits. But it's not quite as outrageous as it could have been, even <b>if</b> <b>things</b> <b>do</b> get really dramatic at times. I guess I was picturing something more arena-sized, though maybe that's because the track is so goddamn huge." [...] RJ Cubarrubia of Billboard wrote that [...] "although the video feels somewhat dark and mystical, like a secret society meeting with unsettling masks and a slightly possessed Welch, the vibe is ultimately joyful and inspiring, with the party guests and Welch visibly bursting with happiness by the video's end." ...|$|E
5000|$|Eurostat {{figures show}} that the numbers of Britons at risk of poverty has fallen to 15.9% in 2014, down from 17.1% in 2010 and 19% in 2005 (after social {{transfers}} were taken into account).

One third of UK households are living below what is considered an adequate income according to the JRF research. [...] Campbell Robb of the JRF said, “Millions of families across the country are teetering on a precipice, with 400,000 pensioners and over one million more children likely to fall into poverty and suffer the very real and awful consequences that brings <b>if</b> <b>things</b> <b>do</b> not change. One of the biggest drivers of the rise in child poverty is policy choices, which is why it is essential that the Prime Minister and Chancellor use the upcoming Budget to put in place measures to stop this happening.

5000|$|Debbie Chang of BuddyTV {{noted the}} {{characters}} immaturity {{in the fourth}} season, saying: [...] "The only character who did not make me love him was Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey). How this character is still Shondas golden child is beyond me. Yes, we get it. Hes tormented by his love for Meredith, {{but that does not}} give him the right to lash out at her when his clinical trial patients are dying. <b>If</b> <b>things</b> <b>dont</b> go absolutely the way he wants them to, then he refuses to cooperate. How immature can this man possibly be?
