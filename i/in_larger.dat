White-tailed deer, raccoons, wild turkeys, and eastern gray squirrels are also found throughout Massachusetts. In more rural areas {{in the western part}} of Massachusetts, larger mammals such as moose and black bears have returned, largely due to reforestation following the regional decline in agriculture.|$|E

5|$|Erosion acting upon {{different}} types of uplift-created joint and fracture systems is responsible for creating the valleys, canyons, domes, and other features we see today. These joints and fracture systems do not move, and are therefore not faults. Spacing between joints {{is controlled by the}} amount of silica in the granite and granodiorite rocks; more silica tends to create a more resistant rock, resulting <b>in</b> <b>larger</b> spaces between joints and fractures.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} role of {{syndicated}} loan markets in financial market development in 24 European countries. We find credit spreads to be negatively related to market size in small markets and positively related <b>in</b> <b>large</b> financial markets. Syn-dicated loans play a different role <b>in</b> <b>large</b> versus small financial systems. In small markets, loan syndications are a substitute for missing public debt markets, while <b>in</b> <b>large</b> financial markets loan syndicates enable arrangers to spread risk more efficiently. Foreign banks tend to reinforce this effect. In small markets, they transfer external finance across borders and <b>in</b> <b>large</b> markets they tend to take on more risky projects. Consequently, we find that characteristics of loan contracts arranged by foreign banks <b>in</b> small versus <b>large</b> markets differ considerably...|$|R
5|$|From the 1960s, {{the rates}} of lung {{adenocarcinoma}} started to rise relative to other types of lung cancer. This {{is partly due to}} the introduction of filter cigarettes. The use of filters removes larger particles from tobacco smoke, thus reducing deposition <b>in</b> <b>larger</b> airways. However, the smoker has to inhale more deeply to receive the same amount of nicotine, increasing particle deposition in small airways where adenocarcinoma tends to arise. The incidence of lung adenocarcinoma continues to rise.|$|E

5|$|In biology, manganese(II) ions {{function}} as cofactors {{for a large}} variety of enzymes with many functions. Manganese enzymes are particularly essential in detoxification of superoxide free radicals in organisms that must deal with elemental oxygen. Manganese also functions in the oxygen-evolving complex of photosynthetic plants. While the element is a required trace mineral for all known living organisms, it also acts as a neurotoxin <b>in</b> <b>larger</b> amounts. Especially through inhalation, it can cause manganism, a condition in mammals leading to neurological damage that is sometimes irreversible.|$|E
40|$|The {{intensity}} of stone collection and stone theft by breeding Chinstrap penguins was measured, and estimations {{made of the}} number of stones per nest <b>in</b> <b>large</b> (> 400 nests) and small subcolonies (< 50 nests) <b>in</b> the <b>large</b> Vapour Col colony on Deception Island, South Shetland Islands. Stone availability was significantly higher both inside and outside small subcolonies. Penguins carried stones to the nest at the same rate <b>in</b> <b>large</b> and small subcolonies, but stole more intensively <b>in</b> <b>large</b> subcolonies. Stones obtained by theft were significantly larger than those collected elsewhere. When stone availability was increased experimentally, individuals of large subcolonies collected more intensively than control individuals <b>in</b> <b>large</b> and small subcolonies, and stole significantly less than control individuals <b>in</b> <b>large</b> subcolonies, and as much as individuals in small subcolonies. The greater theft pressure <b>in</b> <b>large</b> subcolonies was accompanied by more aggressive defence by nest owners and by reduced succession stealing. However, the reduced availability of stones on the ground near large subcolonies led to a significantly lower number of stones per nest than in small subcolonies. These results are interpreted {{in the light of the}} geometric effects of breeding group size (perimeter to surface ratio) on stone accessibility. © 1995 Springer-Verlag. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
