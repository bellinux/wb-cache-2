5|$|In August 2001, Romney {{announced}} that he would not return to Bain Capital. His separation <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>firm</b> concluded in early 2002; He transferred his ownership to other partners and negotiated an agreement that allowed him to receive a share of the profits as a retired partner in some Bain Capital entities, including buyout and investment funds. The private equity business continued to thrive, earning him millions of dollars in annual income.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, facing {{financial}} collapse, Bain & Company asked Romney to return. Announced as its new CEO in January 1991, he drew {{a symbolic}} salary of one dollar (remaining managing general partner of Bain Capital during this time). He oversaw an effort to restructure Bain & Company's employee stock-ownership plan and real-estate deals, while rallying the firm's one thousand employees, imposing a new governing structure that excluded Bain and the other founding partners from control, and increasing fiscal transparency. He got Bain and other initial owners who had removed excessive amounts of money <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>firm</b> to return substantial amounts, and persuaded creditors, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, to accept less than full payment. Within about a year, he had led Bain & Company to a return to profitability. He turned Bain & Company over to new leadership and returned to Bain Capital in December 1992.|$|E

5|$|In October 1929, {{the firm}} {{completed}} a huge grain elevator, with capacity of 7,000,000 bushels (246,670 cubic meters), at Port Arthur. The Depression, however, devastated the grain industry, with falling prices and little demand for exported grain. There was no {{demand for more}} grain elevators, as the existing elevators contained unsold grain, further driving prices down. Howe's company managed to survive on pre-existing government contracts, but these eventually expired and the staff of 175 had decreased to five by 1933. On the first business day of 1934, Howe's sole remaining partner resigned <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>firm.</b> Although Howe remained a wealthy man, his business prospects were few, {{and he decided to}} seek another line of work.|$|E
5|$|Simakis {{praised the}} book for having more depth of {{character}} than Grisham's novels customarily do. She compares the protagonist to Mitch McDeere <b>from</b> <b>The</b> <b>Firm</b> and Rudy Baylor from The Rainmaker. Memmott says {{that most of the}} claimants that they find are unsympathetic, but a few are from somewhat sympathetic immigrant families. Simakis notes that Wally trades sex for legal services with one claimant. Harshaw says that the book is a bit sentimental and comparatively lacking in terms of secondary character development for Grisham. Larry Orenstein of Canada's Globe and Mail notes that on the dramatic scale this book has instances of laugh out loud humor that make it more like Boston Legal than The Practice, which Boston Legal was spun off from.|$|E

Official interest was forthcoming following this success, with contracts being placed to develop further engines, but the continuing stress seriously affected Whittle's health, eventually resulting in a nervous breakdown in 1940. In 1944 when Power Jets was nationalised he again suffered a nervous breakdown, and resigned from the board in 1946.|$|E

25|$|In late 2005, ATA secured $100 {{million in}} {{committed}} financing <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>firm</b> of MatlinPatterson, and Southwest's original deal with ATA was modified such that Southwest no longer retained the 27.5% stake, (or any other financial interest), in ATA.

In 2006, Southwest's pilot union approved a codeshare sideletter to their contract with limitations on the growth of this and other codeshare agreements. While these restrictions today are minor, outsourcing remains a growing concern in the unions' current contract negotiations.|$|E

Beeson then told the committee that, if confirmed, he would immediately and unequivocally resign in writing <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>firm.</b> With the nomination in limbo, the American Federation of Labor formally voted to recommend that Beeson not {{be approved by the}} Senate.|$|E

The firm's major client was the state’s single-largest political donor, while the founding partner Jay Goldberg was Silver's former Assembly counsel, and partner Dara Iryami agreed to testify under immunity.|$|E
