40|$|The {{reconstruction}} of depositional environments {{of the middle}} Allegheny sediments includes <b>isopachous</b> <b>map</b> of the Middle Kittanning-Lower Freeport interval. Thus, the amount of complete stratigraphic nterval thickness controls {{the accuracy of the}} isopach map and indirectly affects environmental interpretations This paper presents a specific solution to prediction of thickness of the Middle Kittannlng-Lower F eeport interval from the thickness of enclosed channel sandstone by using the linear regression model. The application of the linear regression as a predicting equation has increased the data of complete stratigraphic sections approxi-mately twofold. The results of the linear regression analyses indicate that along the fluvio-lacustrlne and bracklsh-marine facies areas, the stratigraphic nterval thickness i controlled by the thickness of the enclosed channel sandstone. That is, thick Midd]e Kittanning-Lower Freeport interval includes thick channel sandstone. The analysis further indicates that the stratigraphic interval shows progressive thickening toward the brackish-marine facies area and thinning toward the fluvlo-lacustrine facies area. The analysis has established that the linear regression relationship between the stratlgraphlc interval and channel sandstone thickness does not significantly vary within and between the fluvio-lacustrine and brackish-marine facies areas. Thus, a Common Regresslou equation of the entire stratigraphical data along the outcrop belt was devised and used as the predicting equation. Such a device has proved to be operational ineastern Ohio and also shou]d prove useful to other areas and rock units of fluvio-lacustrine and brackish-marine origins...|$|E
40|$|Surface and {{subsurface}} stratigraphic {{studies in}} northeastern Arkansas show the Calico Rock Sandstone (Middle Ordovician) to be a lobate sand body up to 200 ft thick. The environment of deposition is considered {{from a study}} of grain characteristics, ripple marks, subjacent and superjacent units and unpublished <b>isopachous</b> <b>maps.</b> The data indicate the Calico Rock Sandstone formed in a transgressing Everton sea as a barrier island and near shore sand complex. The quartz sand was derived from a northern source and was distributed by southwestward flowing longshore currents...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1973 The Pennsylvanian {{rocks in}} south-central Idaho and {{adjacent}} areas consist of three main facies: a platform facies, a shelf facies, and a marginal basin facies. The platform facies {{is represented by}} the Amsden, Quadrant, and Tensleep Formations, in southwestern Montana and western Wyoming, and contain Middle and probably Lower Pennsylvanian strata. The shelf facies {{is represented by the}} Pennsylvanian part of the White Knob Limestone, which extends from the Lemhi Range to the White Knob Mountains west of the Lost River Range in south-central Idaho, and contains Lower, Middle, and Upper Pennsylvanian strata. The marginal basin facies is represented by clastics of the Middle and Upper Pennsylvanian part of the Wood River Formation, in the Wood River region in south-central Idaho, and the Lower, Middle, and Upper Pennsylvanian part of the Wells Formation in southeastern Idaho. Broad epeirogenic upwarps or eustatic sea level caused the shelf and platform to be alternately positive and negative during Pennsylvanian time. Pennsylvanian seas reached maximum inundation during Desmoinesian time after which a temporary offlap developed during Missourian through Middle Virgilian time on the platform and shelf areas, and epicontinental seas were restricted to the Wells and Wood River basins. During Late Virgilian time the seas spread to the east over former areas of post-Desmoinesian erosion on the shelf area Generalized <b>isopachous</b> and lithofacies <b>maps</b> of Pennsylvanian time-stratigraphic units are presented, with interpretations of the positions and periods of activity of positive and negative elements...|$|R
