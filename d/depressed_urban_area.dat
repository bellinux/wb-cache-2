40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the relationship between selected nonintellectual traits and successful school achievement of children from low-income homes. The subjects for this study were 347 sixth-grade children who lived in a <b>depressed</b> <b>urban</b> <b>area.</b> Each subject was assigned to one of four achievement groups based on achievement test scores and teacher evaluations. The groups ranged from the 69 successful children in Achievement Group I to the 169 low achievers in Achievement Group IV. The California Test of Personality (CTP) was used to measure the personal and social adjustment of all subjects. Areas of academically related interests were measured by What I Like to Do, An Inventory of Children's Interests. An interview guide, developed by the researcher, was employed in unstructured interviews with eight achieving pupils. Statistical processing of the data consisted of a three factor analysis of covariance. Interactions were computed between (a) achievement groups, (b) boys and girls, and (c) ethnic groups. The analysis of covariance method was applied to partial out the effects of ability as measured by the Lorge-Thorndike Intelligence Tests. Scores the subjects made on standardized tests were converted to T-scores for the analysis, using the. 05 level of confidence for significance. It was hypothesized that a group of children from low-income homes who had been identified as successful school achievers would differ significantly from groups of less successful pupils from a similar environment in areas of personal and social adjustment and in areas of academically related interests. However, the findings of this study did not strongly support this hypothesis. It was found that when ability was controlled, only the School Relations component of the CTP revealed significantly higher scores for the successful achievers. Information used in the identification of successful achievers, a review of the results of the statistical analysis, and data collected during interviews with eight of the successful achievers led to the following conclusions: The discrepancy between the actual school performance of most children from low-income homes and the expectations of teachers and the grade level norms of standardized achievement tests was clearly demonstrated. The total sample obtained below average scores on the CTP; This suggested the generally poor personal and social adjustment of children from low-income homes whatever their achievement level. White children from low-income homes who are successful school achievers appeared to be better adjusted than their minority group counterparts. Well-adjusted children are more likely to be rated as successful school achievers by their teachers. The findings of this study question the evidence that exists concerning the negative self-image of the child from a low-income home. The significantly lower scores of minority group children in all achievement groups on the Self-Reliance subtest of the CTP indicated that many minority group children are deficient in this personality variable often associated with school success. Although few differences in adjustment existed between boys and girls in this study, the two components that revealed significant differences suggested that girls from low-income homes are probably more willing than boys to subordinate their desires to the needs of the group and may be more effective in dealing with people. This group of children regardless of sex, ethnic group membership, or level of achievement, expressed resentment and hostility toward the community and toward society. The unstructured interview technique revealed some valuable information not available through a statistical approach. This approach might be a profitable one for future investigations involving children from low-income homes. Thesis (D. Ed. ...|$|E

40|$|An urban {{development}} corporation {{was established in}} London Docklands in 1981. Recently, central government has announced its intention to set up similar organisations elsewhere in Britain, and, therefore, {{a review of the}} impact of the London Docklands' initiative is appropriate. In this paper I outline the impact of the {{urban development}} corporation, in terms of economic regeneration and of the effect on local unemployment. It is argued that demand-led economic regeneration, based on the redevelopment of derelict land, has changed the nature of the local economy, although as yet it has not had any significant effect on the numbers of jobs in the local economy, because of continued decline in existing industries and because of pressures on firms to relocate. Local unemployment has gone on increasing, and evidence is presented to show that labour-market adjustment mechanisms and recruitment patterns severely limit the impact of economic regeneration on unemployment in Docklands. Even major developments, such as the proposed office complex on Canary Wharf, will have only a relatively small effect on local unemployment. Local labour-market intervention has been slow to occur, limited in its aims, and uncoordinated. Urban development corporations are useful policy devices for the encouragement of large-scale land redevelopment, but in their present form they do not represent a complete solution to the economic and employment problems of <b>depressed</b> <b>urban</b> <b>areas.</b> ...|$|R

After 1960, the social and material conditions gradually perished and this district became one of Rome’s <b>depressed</b> <b>urban</b> <b>areas.</b> Only recently it has met a re-evaluation process consequently to the building of Rome’s new auditorium in its environs (R.

Young families today aim at settling in this residential area attracted by its urban architectural and environmental qualities, while the ongoing changes are also stimulating architecture historians and specialists to review their evaluations of Moretti’s work. The enhancement of the social and economical status of the new inhabitants has surely incremented the living conditions of the Olympic Village but, as a counter effect, it has introduced a new season of changes, most of which are modifying the architectural form and impoverishing the material and figural authenticity of the district. Today, Rome’s Olympic Village deserves specific attention although the residential use that has revitalized the area should not be depressed or constraint. Changes should be accepted and ruled through a conservation/preservation program based on scientific investigations, data regarding the needs and expectations of its inhabitants and issues of energy saving.

40|$|Cohesion, reuse and {{transformation}} are key {{concepts of the}} project of sustainable regeneration of the built environment. They are also essential for the development and control of territory. In a perspective of sustainable regeneration also the transformation and reuse "creative" of <b>depressed</b> <b>urban</b> <b>areas</b> and abandoned buildings, are crucial {{for the protection of}} the environment and against the land consumption. For many years the sustainable regeneration is a key concept of Community policies: "It is imperative to reuse <b>urban</b> <b>areas</b> unused, derelict or contaminated. Today these <b>urban</b> <b>areas</b> are in excess of any other period of the industrial urban history. The reuse of land and abandoned buildings, meets the objective of sustainable reuse of a resource. It also offers the opportunity to achieve the goal of keeping intact green sites, protecting the countryside, open space and wildlife. As reuse, sustainable development requires destinations positive for the entire urban life and other harbingers of sustainable development "(Urban I and II -" European Sustainable Cities ", 1996) In view of these initial observations the hypothesis is considered significant reuse "creative" living spaces abandoned also in terms of social sustainability. It is believed that the process of transformation of these spaces, if shared, can act as a pole of attraction of social energies in the area and enhance their creativity. Sharing living spaces, both urban and suburban, it facilitates possible forms of local roots and can intercept stimulation and opportunities to develop a planning.
