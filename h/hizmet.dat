25|$|Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan {{declared}} the protest march illegal. During the march, Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım and President Erdoğan compared the {{march to the}} July 2016 coup attempt, and accused the participants and Kılıçdaroğlu of supporting the Gülenist <b>Hizmet</b> movement organization that the government says was behind the coup attempt.

25|$|The Gülen movement, {{also known}} as <b>Hizmet</b> or Jamaat, has {{millions}} of followers in Turkey, {{as well as many}} more abroad. Beyond the schools established by Gülen's followers, it is believed that many Gülenists hold positions of power in Turkey's police forces and judiciary. Turkish and foreign analysts believe Gülen also has sympathizers in the Turkish parliament and that his movement controlled the widely read Islamic conservative Zaman newspaper, the private Bank Asya bank, the Samanyolu TV television station, and many other media and business organizations, including the Turkish Confederation of Businessmen and Industrialists (TUSKON). All have been shut down following the coup attempt. In March 2011, the Turkish government arrested the investigative journalist Ahmet Şık and seized and banned his book The Imam's Army, the culmination of Şık's investigation into Gülen and the Gülen movement.|$|E

His teachings about <b>hizmet</b> (altruistic {{service to the}} [...] "common good") have attracted {{a large number of}} supporters in Turkey, Central Asia, and increasingly {{in other parts of the}} world.|$|E
2500|$|Gulen's Sufism {{is greatly}} {{influenced}} by Sufi Kurdish Quranic scholar Said Nursi (1877–1960), who advocated illuminating modern education and science through Islam. Gulen expands on Nursi to advocate what {{has been described as}} a [...] "Turkish nationalist, state-centered and pro-business approach" [...] centered on service (<b>hizmet,</b> in Turkish).|$|E
2500|$|His teachings {{differ in}} {{emphasis}} {{from those of}} other mainstream Islamic scholars in two respects, both based on his interpretations of particular verses of the Quran. He teaches that the Muslim community has a duty of service (Turkish: <b>hizmet)</b> to the [...] "common good" [...] {{of the community and}} the nation and to Muslims and non-Muslims all over the world; and that the Muslim community is obliged to conduct dialogue with not just the [...] "People of the Book" [...] (Jews and Christians), and people of other religions, but also with agnostics and atheists.|$|E
2500|$|The Twelve Imams {{are part}} of another common Alevi belief. Each Imam {{represents}} a different aspect of the Universe. They are realised as twelve services or On İki <b>Hizmet</b> which are performed {{by members of the}} Alevi community. Each Imam is believed to be a reflection of Ali ibn Abu Talib, the first Imam of the Shi'ites, and there are references to the [...] "First Ali" [...] (Birinci Ali), Imam Hasan the [...] "Second 'Ali" [...] (İkinci Ali), and so on up to the [...] "Twelfth 'Ali" [...] (Onikinci Ali), Imam Mehdi. The Twelfth Imam is hidden and represents the Messianic Age.|$|E

2500|$|Erdoğan's {{campaign}} {{has been dominated by}} electoral rallies, beginning in Samsun on 5 July and then moving to Erzurum, mimicking Mustafa Kemal Atatürk's route which he took {{at the start of the}} Turkish War of Independence. His rally speeches mainly centred on his achievements as Prime Minister and also contained frequent attacks on both the opposition as well as Fethullah Gülen, the leader of the <b>Hizmet</b> Movement living in Pennsylvania. During his Hatay rally on 21 July, he accused Gülen of not speaking out on behalf of the Palestinians in Gaza and accused Israel of [...] "following in the footsteps of Hitler".

50|$|Abdullah Aymaz {{was born}} on 1945, in Emet, Turkey. After {{studying}} at the primary school, he moved to Izmir, where he met with Turkish scholar and opinion leader Fethullah Gulen and <b>Hizmet</b> (Service) Movement, to study at religious vocational high school and Islamic Institute. During his time in high school, he wrote up articles for Gurbet magazine. He served as teacher and manager of educational foundations in several places of Izmir. In 1979, his religious and educational articles began {{to be published in}} Sızıntı magazine, which is the very first publication of <b>Hizmet</b> Movement. As of 1988, his journalism career commenced in Zaman newspaper, in which he also served as editor-in-chief until 1992. As writer, he published more than 50 books under the pen names of Huseyin Bayram, Ismail Yediler and Safvet Senih. Currently, his articles are still published in Zaman Europe. Aymaz {{is one of the first}} names that come to mind when one thinks of <b>Hizmet</b> Movement. Because he spent most of his time with Fethullah Gülen in his youth and after, he internalizes the vision of Gülen. Considering the very beginning of <b>Hizmet</b> Movement, he has a very important role in the formation of movement’s discourse. 19 In March 1997, he conveyed Fethullah Gülen's letter to Pope John Paul II. Since the days in Izmir, where Gülen's outstanding discourse began to crystallize, Abdullah Aymaz has become an integral part of him and the movement.|$|E

50|$|In 2016, Turkish President Erdoğan {{and other}} members of the Turkish {{government}} blamed Fethullah Gülen and his movement for the Turkish coup attempt. The AFSV condemned both the coup and accusations of being involved in it, releasing a statement on the day of the attempt:News media reported about developments in Turkey today regarding actions of Turkish Armed Forces.For more than 40 years, Fethullah Gulen and <b>Hizmet</b> participants have advocated for, and demonstrated their commitment to, peace and democracy. We have consistently denounced military interventions in domestic politics. These are core values of <b>Hizmet</b> participants. We condemn any military intervention in domestic politics of Turkey.Events on the ground are moving quickly and it would be irresponsible for us to speculate on them. We remain concerned about the safety and security of Turkish citizens and those in Turkey right now.Comments by pro-Erdogan circles about the movement are highly irresponsible.|$|E
