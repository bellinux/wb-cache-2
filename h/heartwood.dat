5|$|Omphalotus species cause a {{white rot}} by {{breaking}} down lignin in their tree hosts. The fungus infiltrates the <b>heartwood</b> {{of the tree}} via a breach in its bark, either by a branch falling, damage from insects or mistletoe, or by mechanical damage from logging. O.nidiformis has been implicated in the <b>heartwood</b> rot of several species of eucalypt around Australia, including marri (Corymbia calophylla) in southwest Western Australia, in spotted gum (C.maculata) and messmate (Eucalyptus obliqua) in New South Wales, and in blackbutt (E.pilularis), Sydney blue gum (E.saligna), red stringybark (E.macrorhyncha) and Forth River peppermint (E.radiata) in Victoria.|$|E
5|$|The {{newly created}} xylem is the sapwood. It is {{composed}} of water-conducting cells and associated cells which are often living, and is usually pale in colour. It transports water and minerals from the roots to the upper parts of the tree. The oldest, inner part of the sapwood is progressively converted into <b>heartwood</b> as new sapwood is formed at the cambium. The conductive cells of the <b>heartwood</b> are blocked in some species, and the surrounding cells are more often dead. <b>Heartwood</b> is usually darker in colour than the sapwood. It is the dense central core of the trunk giving it rigidity. Three quarters of the dry mass of the xylem is cellulose, a polysaccharide, {{and most of the}} remainder is lignin, a complex polymer. A transverse section through a tree trunk or a horizontal core will show concentric circles or lighter or darker wood - tree rings. These rings are the annual growth rings There may also be rays running at right angles to growth rings. These are vascular rays which are thin sheets of living tissue permeating the wood. Many older trees may become hollow but may still stand upright for many years.|$|E

A sample was prepared in Victoria in 1885 {{as part of}} a collection of local timber species under the direction of Government botanist Ferdinand von Mueller. The collection was displayed in various exhibitions, including the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1889, and is housed at the Melbourne Museum.|$|E

It is worthwhile noting {{that three of the}} compounds in yellow or incense cedar <b>heartwoods</b> have different modes of action than other commercially available mosquito adulticides currently in use (McAllister and Adams 2010). New modes of action are particularly relevant in the search for compounds to overcome resistance to existing pesticides.|$|R
5|$|Trees {{chosen for}} nest holes have soft <b>heartwood</b> and tough sapwood, the former often due to parasites or {{diseases}} that weaken the tree's core. It {{is not certain}} how suitable trees are selected, {{although it may be}} by drumming, since woods with differing elastic modulus and density may transmit sound at different speeds. A Japanese study found nests in trees from many families; these included grey alder, Japanese white birch, Japanese hop-hornbeam, Japanese tree lilac, willows, Japanese larch and Sargent's cherry. The Mongolian oak and prickly castor-oil tree were rarely if ever used.|$|E
5|$|Silver birch wood is pale in colour with no {{distinct}} <b>heartwood</b> {{and is used}} {{in making}} furniture, plywood, veneers, parquet blocks, skis, kitchen utensils and in turnery. It makes a good firewood that produces a good heat when burnt but is quickly consumed by the flames. Slabs of bark are used for making roof shingles and wooden footwear. Historically, the bark was used for tanning. Bark can be heated and the resin collected; the resin is an excellent waterproof glue and useful for starting fires. The thin sheets of bark that peel off young wood contain a waxy resin and are easy to ignite even when wet. The dead twigs are also useful as kindling for outdoor fires.|$|E

Birds seek them out all year but especially in June and July, when the moth caterpillars are largest, and they are accompanied by their just fledged young. They search out holes and make some exploratory bites looking for larvae. If successful, they peel and tear down a strip of bark to make a perch for themselves before continuing to gouge and excavate the larvae, which have deeply tunneled into the <b>heartwood.</b>|$|E

30|$|Todomatsu (Abies sachalinensis) is a {{commercial}} plantation species on Hokkaido Island, Japan. In the present study, {{to improve the}} decay resistance of todomatsu wood, seven families of 22 -year-old todomatsu trees were investigated for family diversities in decay resistance of <b>heartwoods</b> against Fomitopsis palustris and Trametes versicolor and n-hexane-extractive contents in <b>heartwoods.</b> In addition, antifungal activity tests of n-hexane extracts were conducted for F. palustris and T. versicolor. Mean percentages of wood mass loss by F. palustris and T. versicolor were 18.2 and 10.5  %, respectively. Significant differences in mass loss and n-hexane-extractive contents were not found among seven families tested here. The mean value of n-hexane-extractive contents was 6.4  mg/g. By gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis, a main component of n-hexane extracts was suggested to be juvabione. Results of the antifungal activity test show that mycelial growth of F. palustris and T. versicolor was strongly inhibited over the concentration of 225 and 150  µg per disc, respectively. These concentrations corresponded to about 10.0 and 6.6  mg/g in wood. Thus, it is concluded that the todomatsu trees containing more than 10.0  mg/g of n-hexane extracts should be selected among the families for high decay resistance.|$|R

5|$|Ascocoryne sarcoides is {{a species}} of fungus in the family Helotiaceae. The species name {{is derived from the}} Greek sarkodes (fleshy). Formerly known as Coryne sarcoides, its taxonomical history has been {{complicated}} by the fact that it may adopt both sexual and asexual forms. Colloquially known as jelly drops or the purple jellydisc, this common fungus appears as a gelatinous mass of pinkish or purple-colored discs. Distributed widely in North America, Europe and Asia, A.sarcoides is a saprobic fungus and grows in clusters on the trunks and branches of a variety of dead woods. Field studies suggest that colonization by A.sarcoides of the <b>heartwood</b> of black spruce confers some resistance to further infection by rot-causing fungi. A.sarcoides contains the antibiotic compound ascocorynin, shown in the laboratory to inhibit the growth of several Gram-positive bacteria.|$|E
5|$|Eusociality {{involves}} cooperative {{brood care}} (including brood care of offspring from other individuals), overlapping generations within {{a colony of}} adults, and a division of labour into reproductive and non-reproductive groups. Few organisms outside Hymenoptera exhibit this behavior; the only beetle {{to do so is}} the weevil Austroplatypus incompertus. This Australian species lives in horizontal networks of tunnels, in the <b>heartwood</b> of Eucalyptus trees. It is one of more than 300 species of wood-boring Ambrosia beetles which distribute the spores of ambrosia fungi. The fungi grow in the beetles' tunnels, providing food for the beetles and their larvae; female offspring remain in the tunnels and maintain the fungal growth, probably never reproducing. Cooperative brood care is also found in the bess beetles (Passalidae) where the larvae feed on the semi-digested faeces of the adults.|$|E
5|$|Six to 12 larval stages occur. During {{the first}} two stages, the larvae live off {{surrounding}} fungal tissue, until they reach the inner wood. Up to the fourth stage, they eat through the final summer wood along the tracheids, and finally towards the <b>heartwood.</b> After the seventh stage, they usually reach their maximum size. While penetrating further, they normally turn either up or down, but they turn back if they meet a foreign borehole, encounter bubbles of resin, or dry out. The larvae only live off the fungal mycelium, which they digest through a secretion. They pupate several centimeters under the bark. Before this, female larvae sequester a secretion containing fungal oidia, which adult females incorporate in their mycetangia above their ovipositors. The adults eat through the bark, but, depending on the weather, they remain in the hatch hole {{for up to three}} weeks before they leave the wood in warm and sunny weather.|$|E
40|$|Review {{of factors}} {{influencing}} wood durability shows although density {{varies depending on}} trunk position, its role appears controversial for many timber species. Thus, for the first time, the influence of density on the durability of three Ghanaian timbers (Nauclea diderrichii (de Wild.) Merr., Nesogordonia papaverifera (A. Chev.) R. Capuron and Corynanthe pachyceras Welw.) [a Lesser-Utilized-Species (LUS) ] is investigated, particularly for tropical species. Stake density was determined using its corrected oven-dry weight and conditioned volume. Extracted density was based on its density and total extractive content determined using 1 : 2 ethanol-toluene. Mean weight losses (%) for stakes from inner and outer <b>heartwoods</b> (IHW and OHW respectively) of each timber and the middle sapwood (MSW) of C. pachyceras, after exposure to Coriolus versi-color (Linnaeus) Quelet.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine antioxidant capacity based on ferric ions reducing abilities of 49 crude extracts from eight Artocarpus species. Artocarpus species are well known as the source of antioxidant metabolites such as flavonoids, xanthones and stilbenes. The leaves and <b>heartwoods</b> of Artocarpus anisophyllus, A. fulvicortex, A. gomeizianus, A. hispidus, A. integer, A. kemando, A. lowii and A. rigidus collected from several locations in Malaysia were extracted successively at room temperature using different polarity of solvents. The ability of Artocarpus crude extracts to reduce ferric ions was determined using ferric reducing antioxidant potential (FRAP) assay and expressed as mM FRAP equivalent to FeSO 4. 7 H 2 O. The trend for ferric ions reducing power of these crude extracts varied according to the polarity of the solvents used. Methanol crude extract of the leaves of A. hispidus (AHLM) relatively showed strong ferric ion reducing power ranging from 0. 69 - 7. 32 mM FRAP equivalent followed by the methanol crude extracts of the barks of A. rigidus (ARBM; 0. 36 - 4. 13 mM FRAP equivalent) and followed by methanol crude extract of the <b>heartwoods</b> of A. fulvicortex (AFHM; 0. 32 - 3. 66 mM FRAP equivalent). These results were comparable with the positive standards tested ie. trolox (0. 20 - 2. 43 mM FRAP equivalent), BHT (0. 09 - 1. 89 mM FRAP equivalent) and BHA (0. 02 - 8. 81 mM FRAP equivalent) ...|$|R

Small cracks appeared at the boundary between the torus and margo, along the outer margin of the margo, and on the torus when specimens were compressed and deformation was fixed by drying. The remarkable cracks were generally observed for Cryptomeria japonica D. Don. Pseudotsuga menziesii Franco showed peculiar detachment of the torus from the pit border, and Larix leptolepis Gordon exhibited only small cracks on the torus. These fractures patterns were clearer when the precompressed specimens were recovered by water impregnation and then redried.|$|R
5|$|The {{sycamore}} is {{susceptible to}} sooty bark disease, caused by the fungus Cryptostroma corticale. This causes wilting of the crown {{and the death of}} branches. Rectangular patches of bark become detached exposing thick layers of black fungal spores. The fungus may be present in the <b>heartwood</b> without symptoms for many years, working its way towards the bark following long, hot summers. The spores are hyper-allergenic and cause a condition called maple bark stripper’s disease, a hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Less serious is the fungus Rhytisma acerinum which often forms the disease known as tar spot, in which black spots with yellow margins form on the foliage. The leaves may fall prematurely but the vigour of the tree is little affected. Sycamore leaf spot, caused by the fungus Cristulariella depraedans, results in pale blotches on leaves which later dry up and fall. This disease can cause moderate leaf loss but trees are little affected in the long run.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} field studies {{conducted}} in the boreal forest region of Northern Ontario (Canada) showed that A.sarcoides {{was found to be}} frequently associated with various deciduous and coniferous tree hosts that had been affected by the fungal disease known as heart rot; this discovery was noted as unusual, as most fungal tree infections are known to be caused by Basidiomycetes, not Ascomycetes. In the case of the commercially valuable tree species black spruce (Picea mariana), it was determined that prior colonization by A.sarcoides reduces the incidence of subsequent infection by common fungal pathogens, such as Fomes pini and Scytinostroma galactina; furthermore, A.sarcoides can exist in the wood with no noticeable harmful effects on the host. A similar relationship was shown later to exist with jack pine trees (species Pinus banksiana), whereby A.sarcoides inhibited Peniophora pseudopini, but had little effect on the subsequent growth of Fomes pini. The study also showed that A.sarcoides is isolated more frequently from defective wood as the age of the tree increases (trees examined in the study were over 80 years old), and that it can infect both uninfected <b>heartwood</b> as well as previously decayed wood; in the latter case it usually coexists with the causal fungi.|$|E

In recent years, {{some papers}} about the {{volatile}} composition of no.,oak <b>heartwoods</b> {{have been shown}} in scientific literature, {{with a view to}} their use in cooperage, although only oak and chestnut are approved by OIV to wine aging. Many volatile compounds were identified in seasoned and toasted no oak <b>heartwoods,</b> among them lignin and carbohydrate and lipid derivatives. On the whole, compared to oak, toasted acacia and chestnut woods showed a very high richness of these compounds, as lignin as lipid and carbohydrate derivatives, while cherry and ash werericher than toasted oak wood in lignin derivatives, but poorer in lipid ahd carbohydrate derivatives, showing sorne compounds that could be considered chemical markers for each one of these woods. In the present work, the wood related volatile composition of six wines (four red, one white, and one rosé) aged using barreis and chips of cherry, chestimt, false acacia, ash and oak wood was studied by GC-MS, to know if the volatile compounds that no oak woods contribute to wines can be used as chemical markers, and to classify the wines according to aging method. A total of more than 80 volatile compounds were studied, among furanic compounds, lactones, enolone stmctures, simple phenols, mono, di and trimethoxyphenols, phenolic aldehydes, ketones, ethers, acids, alkyl esters and alcohols. Most of them have been previotisly described in different varietal wines aged in oak, but some were only detected in wines aged in contact with other wood specie.

30|$|The {{effect of}} gamma {{irradiation}} at 100 kGy and {{at lower levels}} on termite resistance was examined in the laboratory by no-choice and choice feeding termite tests (Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki) using four wood species: sapwood of Cryptomeria japonica D. Don, and <b>heartwoods</b> of Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirbel) Franco, Larix kaempferi (Lambert) Carriere, and Chamaecyparis obtusa Endl. The wood consumption rates in C. japonica and P. menziesii specimens were likely to increase with increases in gamma-irradiation levels, whereas little effect of gamma irradiation was seen in L. kaempferi and C. obtusa. Similar results were obtained in the two-choice test. The current results indicated that in the two-choice test with C. formosanus, 100 -kGy-irradiated C. japonica and P. menziesii, which are not rich in antitermite substances, were eaten more than other wood samples with or without gamma irradiation. However, only C. japonica showed significant difference in termite feeding activity. The mass loss in 100 -kGy-irradiated C. japonica was significantly higher in the multichoice test.|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] Decay {{resistance}} of various temperate zone timber species (138 spp. of hardwoods and 44 spp. of softwoods) against a soft rot fungus, Chaetomium globosum KUNZE was estimated {{with reference to}} methanol extractives in wood in laboratory sand block tests.

Variances of decay resistance among species and families were considered not to be much different {{from those in the}} case of Basidiomycetes. Softwood species were slightly attacked and the greater part of species retained high resistance after treatment with hot methanol. In the case of Coriolus versicolor QUEL., a white rot fungus, extractive-rich species of softwoods were more resistant to decay, and the greater part of such species became less resistant after the treatment.

In this study, specimens with four types, namely plated specimen (a) and particle specimen (b), discoid specimen (c), wood powder (d), were used as shown in Fig.  1. These specimens were prepared in consideration of the directional property of wood and the contact condition between NO 2 gas and each specimen. The (a) and (c) were prepared from a cedar wood {{harvested in}} Kumamoto Prefecture and the (b) and (d) were prepared from a cedar wood harvested in Osaka Prefecture. In the plated (a) and discoid (c) specimens, the proportion of late wood was 18.2 % and the mean annual ring width was 4.51  mm. The plated specimens (a) were prepared three kinds of thickness in longitudinal direction, namely 1.5, 3.0 and 5.0  mm with the length of radial direction of 50  mm, and the tangential direction of 100  mm. The 5.0 -mm-thick specimen is the same size used in JIS R 1701 - 1 [12]. The particle specimens (b) were prepared by {{the disintegration of the}} plated specimens (a) with three thicknesses in longitudinal direction, thus the particle specimens provide the thicknesses, namely 1.5, 3.0 and 5.0  mm.

40|$|Xylophagous borers and {{termites}} {{that damage}} "timber-in-service" cause {{millions of dollars}} loss annually throughout mainland Australia. I developed field-based feeding assays with practical relevance to preventative action and remedial treatment of infestations of xylophagous insects in the built environment. Essential to this work is facilitating a high termite risk by maintaining an environment conducive to sustained foraging by termites. Feeding assays conducted in low termite risk areas are unduly prolonged, with inherently erratic termite feeding responses. I successfully developed feeding assays with a high termite risk. To establish whether a physical barrier, retrofitted as a sleeve, could prevent termites from damaging wooden poles, eighty poles were established within Beerburrum State Forest, south-east Queensland, Australia. Poles within sets were interconnected with buried timber to facilitate a high risk to Coptotermes acinaciformis (Froggatt). Mesh sleeves {{to a depth of}} 1. 5 m did not prevent termite damage to the poles. Hoop pine Araucaria cunninghamii Ait. ex D. Don dowels ("dip-sticks") were useful termite monitoring devices on the poles. The depth of foraging by termites has implications for the effectiveness of retrofitted physical and chemical barriers in general. Timber quantity and quality has a pivotal influence on the aggregation of large numbers of feeding termites necessary for baiting work and for producing efficacy data of relevance to the protection of timber-in-service from termites. Seasonal variation in termite foraging was examined. Both C. acinaciformis and Coptotermes lacteus (Froggatt) were more active feeding in summer than in autumn. In general, mass loss followed mean ambient temperature. Suppression of C. acinaciformis feeding responses relative to C. lacteus during summer, particularly during January, is thought to be due to excessive temperatures in the containers attached to infested trees. Termite foraging behaviour and responses to both varying masses of softwood timbers and varying exposure times were investigated. The rate of mass loss was independent of the number of test specimens and appeared linear. Colonies regulate the number of foragers directly according to the mass of susceptible timber available. This phenomenon was exploited throughout the remainder of the thesis. Of particular significance was the considerable intra- and inter-specific variation in susceptibility of softwoods to C. acinaciformis and Mastotermes darwiniensis Froggatt. The sapwoods tested were susceptible, but the <b>heartwoods</b> were generally resistant to damage by termites. These data confirm that termites are discriminating feeders, and some more so than others. A novel methodology, developed to maintain an environment conducive to sustained foraging by termites during field-testing, is presented. Consistency in timber acceptance and susceptibility to termites is considered to be important in determining the frequency of inspection and the success of bait systems. I evaluate the termiticidal activity of the bait toxicants hexaflumuron and chlorfluazuron for the management of the subterranean termite C. acinaciformis in the field. The Sentricon Colony Elimination System with Baitube-devices containing 0. 1 % and 1 % mass/mass (m/m) hexaflumuron bait toxicant in dry wood flour (Recruit) was successful in eliminating field colonies of C. acinaciformis. Similarly, the Exterra Termite Interception and Baiting System with cellulose-acetate powder containing either 0. 05 % m/m or 0. 25 % m/m chlorfluazuron (Requiem) eliminated C. acinaciformis. Indicators (including "dip-sticks") used to monitor colony health were reliable. By using C. acinaciformis, which builds mounds (epigeous nests) in northern Australia, I was able to avoid the use of multiple mark-release schemes to verify the effects of the bait toxicant on the termite colonies. Problems with multiple mark-release schemes, used elsewhere in the world, are discussed. I continued the focus on bait quality and placement by evaluating termite responses to two aspects of treated stakes, their attractiveness and their susceptibility. Three experiments were undertaken near Townsville and at Beerburrum, with Coptotermes and Schedorhinotermes. Whilst {{there were no significant differences}} in the rate of location and foraging, with respect to treatments, differences in foraging, with respect to C. acinaciformis and Schedorhinotermes seclusus (Hill) were significant. Coptotermes acinaciformis displayed greater foraging site tenacity than S. seclusus at Beerburrum. Increased consumption of bait, due to the addition of a phagostimulant, needs to be observed in the field before an increase in the efficacy of baits in a termite management program can be claimed. In Australia, softwood timbers are extensively used in building construction and are generally highly susceptible to damage by termites. I focussed on field feeding assays to test efficacy of borate-treated softwoods against termites and to define "adequate" protection thresholds. Laboratory and field data reported in the literature were confusing with regard to what constitutes "adequate" protection thresholds. The confusion was compounded by differences in termite species, timber species used and test methodology. Laboratory data indicated a borate loading of 0. 5 % m/m boric acid equivalent (BAE) would cause > 90 % termite mortality and restrict mass loss in test specimens to 5 %. Field data generally suggested that borate loadings in excess of 0. 5 % m/m BAE were required. The main contribution of the work to increasing our understanding of management options for termites in the built environment was in resolving the confusion between laboratory and field data for borate wood-preservatives. These apparently conflicting results were explained by the presence or absence of untreated feeder material in the test environment. In the absence of untreated feeder material, retention of 0. 5 % BAE provides adequate protection from Coptotermes sp., whereas in the presence of untreated feeder material, increased retentions are required. Furthermore, the retentions required increase with increased amounts of susceptible material. Some termites, Nasutitermes sp. and M. darwiniensis, for example, are borate-tolerant and borate wood-preservatives are not a viable management option. The lack of uniform standards for termite-test methodology and assessment criteria for efficacy across the world is recognized as a difficulty with research into the performance of wood preservatives with termites. The many variables in laboratory and field assays make "prescriptive" standards difficult to recommend. The use of "performance" standards to define efficacy criteria ("adequate" protection) is discussed. Whilst the majority of the work involves subterranean termites ("termites"), I examine the question of how to define a hardwood timber species as "not susceptible" to lyctine beetle damage. Aspects of the biology, behaviour and management of Lyctus brunneus (Stephens) are reviewed and a novel field sampling and testing protocol to establish lyctine susceptibility of timber species is presented. A sound understanding of the biology and behaviour of xylophagous insects in the field is essential to ensure that management options implemented in the built environment have a strong ecological basis. The success of this study in achieving stated aims, the need for further work and the implications for test methodologies in the field with practical relevance to infestations of xylophagous insects in the built environment are discussed...|$|R
