5|$|The {{earliest}} known {{member of}} the family Equidae was the Hyracotherium, which lived between 45 and 55million years ago, during the Eocene period. It had 4toes on each front foot, and 3toes on each back foot. The extra toe on the front feet soon disappeared with the Mesohippus, which lived 32 to 37million years ago. Over time, the extra side toes shrank in size until they vanished. All that remains of them in modern horses is a set of small vestigial bones on the leg below the knee, known informally as splint bones. Their legs also lengthened as their toes disappeared until they were a hooved animal capable of running at great speed. By about 5million years ago, the modern Equus had evolved. <b>Equid</b> teeth also evolved from browsing on soft, tropical plants to adapt to browsing of drier plant material, then to grazing of tougher plains grasses. Thus proto-horses changed from leaf-eating forest-dwellers to grass-eating inhabitants of semi-arid regions worldwide, including the steppes of Eurasia and the Great Plains of North America.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Equine neorickettsiosis (EN), {{also known}} as Potomac Horse Fever, is a non-contagious disease caused by the {{bacterium}} Neorickettsia risticii of the Anaplasmataceae family. The objectives {{of this study were}} to detect the presence of anti-N. risticii antibodies by the indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and of its DNA by qPCR in <b>equids</b> at high and low altitude regions in the State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and to identify factors associated with seropositive <b>equids</b> by multiple logistic regression analysis. The frequency of anti-N. risticii antibodies was 16. 05 % (n= 113 / 704). The animal age and breeding region were the factors that influenced the seropositivity rate for N. risticii in the <b>equids</b> (p< 0. 05). <b>Equids</b> from the lowland region had higher seropositivity (p< 0. 05; OR= 5. 87) compared to those of the mountain region. The presence of snails on the farm was a factor associated with this result (p< 0. 05; OR= 2. 88). In the lowland region, age of the animal and site of breeding were protective factors for the detection of antibodies anti-N. risticii in <b>equids,</b> with lower frequency of seropositivity in younger animals (p< 0. 05; OR= 0. 06) and in animals raised in dry areas (p< 0. 05; OR= 0. 22). The presence of the target DNA of N. risticii by qPCR was not observed in any of the samples tested. The existence of seropositive <b>equids</b> for N. risticii demonstrates a possible circulation of this agent in the studied area, and that the age related characteristics and <b>equids</b> breeding region are important factors regarding seropositivity in the State of Rio de Janeiro...|$|R

25|$|<b>Equid</b> hooves are {{the result}} of the 55-million-year {{evolution}} of the horse. Wild and domesticated Equus species share a very similar hoof shape and function. The present-day conformation of the hoof is a result of a progressive evolutionary loss of digits I, II, IV and V of the basal pentadactyl limb, with changes in bones, joints and hoof capsule. The resulting conformation allows a heavy, strong body to move with high speed on any ground, and most efficiently on open, hard, flat areas like prairies and deserts (i.e., 'cursorial specialisation').|$|E
25|$|In {{some areas}} {{domestic}} donkeys {{have returned to}} the wild and established feral populations such as those of the Burro of North America and the Asinara donkey of Sardinia, Italy, both of which have protected status. Feral donkeys can also cause problems, notably in environments that have evolved free of any form of <b>equid,</b> such as Hawaii. In Australia, where there may be 5 million feral donkeys, they are regarded as an invasive pest and have a serious impact on the environment. They may compete with livestock and native animals for resources, spread weeds and diseases, foul or damage watering holes and cause erosion.|$|E

40|$|Serum {{samples from}} 714 <b>equids</b> of Itaguaí and Serrana microregions, Rio de Janeiro, southeastern Brazil, were {{examined}} by indirect {{fluorescent antibody test}} (titer 1 : 80) for Theileria equi.

The overall prevalence of T. equi infection was 81. 09 % (n = 579), with higher prevalence (p < 0. 05) in the Itaguaí (85. 43 %) when compared to Serrana microregion (76. 92 %). The geographic area, altitude, farming condition and area of origin of <b>equids</b> were associated (p < 0. 05) with seropositivity for T. equi. <b>Equids</b> reared in the Itaguaí microregion (PR = 1. 11, p = 0. 003) and at altitudes below 500 m (PR = 1. 10; p = 0, 014) {{were more likely to}} be seropositive for T. equi.

25|$|Horse {{bones were}} rare or absent in Neolithic and Chalcolithic kitchen garbage in western Turkey, Mesopotamia, most of Iran, South and Central Asia, {{and much of}} Europe. While horse bones have been {{identified}} in Neolithic sites in central Turkey, all equids together totaled less than 3% of the animal bones. Within this three percent, horses were less than 10%, with 90% or more of the equids represented by onagers (Equus hemionus) or another ass-like <b>equid</b> that later became extinct, Equus hydruntinus. Onagers were the most common native wild equids of the Near East. They were hunted in Syria, Anatolia, Mesopotamia, Iran, and Central Asia; and domesticated asses (Equus asinus) were imported into Mesopotamia, probably from Egypt, but wild horses apparently did not live there.|$|E
25|$|Pleistocene horse fossils {{have been}} {{assigned}} to a multitude of species, with over 50 species of equines described from the Pleistocene of North America alone, although the taxonomic validity of most of these has been called into question. Recent genetic work on fossils has found evidence for only three genetically divergent <b>equid</b> lineages in Pleistocene North and South America. These results suggest all North American fossils of caballine-type horses (which also include the domesticated horse and Przewalski's horse of Europe and Asia), as well as South American fossils traditionally placed in the subgenus E. (Amerhippus) {{belong to the same}} species: E. ferus. Remains attributed to a variety of species and lumped as New World stilt-legged horses (including E. francisci, E. tau, E. quinni and potentially North American Pleistocene fossils previously attributed to E. cf. hemiones, and E. (Asinus) cf. kiang) probably all belong to a second species endemic to North America, which despite a superficial resemblance to species in the subgenus E. (Asinus) (and hence occasionally referred to as North American ass) is closely related to E. ferus. Surprisingly, the third species, endemic to South America and traditionally referred to as Hippidion, originally believed to be descended from Pliohippus, was shown to be a third species in the genus Equus, closely related to the New World stilt-legged horse. The temporal and regional variation in body size and morphological features within each lineage indicates extraordinary intraspecific plasticity. Such environment-driven adaptative changes would explain why the taxonomic diversity of Pleistocene equids has been overestimated on morphoanatomical grounds.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To report {{use of a}} pinless {{external}} fixator (PEF) for unilateral mandibular fractures in 9 <b>equids.</b> STUDY DESIGN: Case series. ANIMALS: <b>Equids</b> (n= 9) with unilateral mandibular fractures. METHODS: All fractures were stabilized with the AO/ASIF PEF using a minimum of 4 clamps, under general anesthesia. Fracture configuration, complications, outcome, and owner satisfaction were evaluated. RESULTS: All fractures were stabilized; 2 <b>equids</b> were euthanatized; 1 because of an inability to stand after surgery and 1 because of owner decision after PEF dislodgement. Seven repairs healed with good outcome and owner satisfaction. Complications included dislodgement of the PEF (3), bone sequestration (3), and weight loss (1). Drainage associated with repair resolved after removal of sequestra and clamps. CONCLUSIONS: Stabilization of unilateral mandibular fractures with the PEF in horses was minimally invasive with minimal risk of tooth root interference; however, after care is time consuming.

2500|$|Detailed fossil {{information}} on the distribution and rate of change of new <b>equid</b> species has also revealed that the progression between species was not as smooth and consistent as was once believed. Although some transitions, {{such as that of}} Dinohippus to Equus, were indeed gradual progressions, a number of others, such as that of Epihippus to Mesohippus, were relatively abrupt in geologic time, taking place over only a few million years. Both anagenesis (gradual change in an entire population's gene frequency) and cladogenesis (a population [...] "splitting" [...] into two distinct evolutionary branches) occurred, and many species coexisted with [...] "ancestor" [...] species at various times.

40|$|Infections with equine herpesviruses (EHVs) are {{widespread}} in equine popula- tions worldwide. Whereas both EHV- 1 and EHV- 4 produce well-documented respiratory syndromes in <b>equids,</b> {{the contribution of}} EHV- 2 and EHV- 5 to disease of the respiratory tract is still enigmatic. This study describes the detection and genetic characterization of EHVs from <b>equids</b> with and without clinical respiratory disease. Virus-specific PCRs were used to detect EHV- 1, - 2, - 4 and - 5. From the total of 160 <b>equids</b> with respiratory disease, EHV- 5 was detected at the highest prevalence (23. 1 %), followed by EHV- 2 (20. 0 %), EHV- 4 (8. 1 %) and EHV- 1 (7. 5 %). Concurrent infections with EHV- 2 and EHV- 5 were recorded from nine (5. 2 %) diseased horses. Of the total of 111 clinically healthy <b>equids,</b> EHV- 1 and EHV- 4 were never detected whereas EHV- 2 and EHV- 5 were found in 8 (7. 2 %) and 18 (16. 2 %) horses, respec- tively. A significantly higher proportion of EHV- 2 -infected <b>equids</b> was observed in the respiratory disease group (32 / 160, 20. 0 %; P = 0. 005) com- pared to those without disease (8 / 111; 7. 2 %). EHV- 2 -positive <b>equids</b> were {{three times more likely}} to display clinical signs of respiratory disease than EHV- 2 -negative <b>equids</b> (OR 3. 22, 95 % CI: 1. 42 – 7. 28). For EHV- 5, the observed difference was not statistically significant (P = 0. 166). The phyloge- netic analysis of the gB gene revealed that the Ethiopian EHV- 2 and EHV- 5 strains had a remarkable genetic diversity, with a nucleotide sequence identity among each other that ranged from 94. 0 to 99. 4 % and 95. 1 to 100 %, respec- tively. Moreover, the nucleotide sequence identity of EHV- 2 and EHV- 5 with isolates from other countries acquired from GenBank ranged from 92. 9 to 99. 1 % and 95. 1 to 99. 5 %, respectively. Our results suggest that besides EHV- 1 and EHV- 4, EHV- 2 is likely to be an important contributor either to induce or predispose <b>equids</b> to respiratory disease.

40|$|OBJECTIVE : To {{evaluate}} outcomes following {{treatment of}} sarcoids in <b>equids</b> {{and to identify}} risk factors for treatment failure in these patients. DESIGN : Retrospective case series. ANIMALS : 230 <b>equids</b> with 614 sarcoids. PROCEDURES : Records were searched to identify <b>equids</b> treated for >= 1 sarcoid between 2008 and 2013. A standardized protocol {{was used to determine}} treatment choice (electrosurgery, electrosurgery with intralesional placement of cisplatin-containing beads, topical administration of imiquimod or acyclovir, cryosurgery, bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine injection, or intralesional injection of platinum-containing drugs). Data regarding animal, tumor, treatment, and outcome variables were collected. Complete tumor regression without recurrence for >= 6 months was considered a successful outcome. Success rates were calculated; binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify risk factors for treatment failure and to compare effects of the 2 topical treatments. A. 2 test was used to compare effects of the number of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine or cisplatin-containing drug injections on outcome. RESULTS : The overall success rate was 460 of 614 (74. 9 %). Electrosurgical excision resulted in the highest treatment success rate (277 / 319 [86. 8 %]); odds of treatment failure were significantly greater for intralesional injection of platinum-containing drugs, cryosurgery, and topical acyclovir treatment. Odds of treatment failure were also significantly greater for sarcoids on <b>equids</b> with multiple tumors than for solitary lesions, and significantly lower for sarcoids on <b>equids</b> that received concurrent immunostimulating treatment for another sarcoid than for those on patients that did not receive such treatment.
