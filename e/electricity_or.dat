5|$|After resigning from Berkeley, Kaczynski {{moved to}} his parents' home in Lombard, Illinois, then {{two years later}} to a remote cabin he had built outside Lincoln, Montana.

5|$|During {{his time}} in Norway, Reich {{attempted}} to ground his orgasm theory in biology, exploring whether Freud's metaphor of the libido was in fact <b>electricity</b> <b>or</b> a chemical substance, an argument Freud had proposed in the 1890s but had abandoned. Reich argued that conceiving of the orgasm as nothing but mechanical tension and relaxation could not explain why some experience pleasure and others do not. He {{wanted to know what}} additional element had to be present for pleasure to be felt.|$|E
5|$|Low-tech {{communication}} {{aids are}} defined as {{those that do not}} need batteries, <b>electricity</b> <b>or</b> electronics. These are often very simple communication boards or books, from which the user selects letters, words, phrases, pictures, and/or symbols to communicate a message. Depending on physical abilities and limitations, users may indicate the appropriate message with a body part, light pointer, eye-gaze direction, or a head/mouth stick. Alternatively, they may indicate yes or no while a listener scans through possible options.|$|E

5|$|Most {{exploitation}} of oil shale involves mining followed by shipping elsewhere, after {{which one can}} burn the shale directly to generate <b>electricity,</b> <b>or</b> undertake further processing. The most common methods of surface mining involve open pit mining and strip mining. These procedures remove most of the overlying material to expose the deposits of oil shale, and become practical when the deposits occur near the surface. Underground mining of oil shale, which removes less of the overlying material, employs the room-and-pillar method.|$|E
5|$|Copenhagen aims to be carbon-neutral by 2025. Commercial and {{residential}} buildings are to reduce electricity consumption by 20 percent and 10 percent respectively, and total heat consumption is to fall by 20 percent by 2025. Renewable energy {{features such as}} solar panels are becoming increasingly common in the newest buildings in Copenhagen. District heating will be carbon-neutral by 2025, by waste incineration and biomass. New buildings must now be constructed according to Low Energy Class ratings and in 2020 near net-zero energy buildings. By 2025, 75% of trips should be made on foot, by bike, or by using public transit. The city plans that 20–30% of cars will run on <b>electricity</b> <b>or</b> biofuel by 2025. The investment is estimated at $472 million public funds and $4.78 billion private funds.|$|E
5|$|No {{preparations}} {{had been}} made for their reception, accommodation had not been set aside and no food had been prepared. The children were placed {{in different parts of}} the camp based on their condition. The healthy and stronger children were housed in the barracks, weaker and sick children were accommodated in the castle, and the very weak and those suffering from typhus were lodged in the monastery. Only Serb children were kept in the camp, and they came from all over the NDH. They had previously been kept at the camps at Stara Gradiška, Jasenovac, Jablanac, Cerovljani, Mlaka, Gornja Reka and areas of Slavonia. Those accommodated in the barracks had no <b>electricity</b> <b>or</b> running water, and food initially consisted of little more than cornflour.|$|E

5|$|Patton {{was born}} in Fallsburg, Kentucky on May 26, 1937, in a {{retrofitted}} silo with no indoor plumbing, <b>electricity,</b> <b>or</b> telephone. He was the only son of the three children born to Ward and Irene Patton. The family moved often because Ward Patton, a teacher, was assigned to a different school every year. When {{he was hired by}} a railroad in Pike County, he and his wife agreed that she would remain in Fallsburg with the children until they finished school. Patton attended Fallsburg Elementary School, a four-room schoolhouse in his hometown. He was active in the 4-H club, where he began to develop his public speaking ability. In 1951, he enrolled at Louisa High School in Louisa, Kentucky. He was an honor student, a member of the drama club, a football and baseball player, and class president during his senior year. In 1955, he graduated with the third-highest grade point average in his class of 73.|$|E
5|$|Žigić {{was born}} in Bačka Topola, {{in what was then}} SFR Yugoslavia, the son of Jovan, a former footballer, and his wife Milica, who had been a {{basketball}} player. He completed his secondary education at the mechanical engineering school in Bačka Topola. His brother Branko, 15 months his junior, also became a footballer, as a central defender with clubs including Cement Beočin and Serbian First League club Proleter Novi Sad. During the Yugoslav Wars in 1999, Žigić's hometown was beneath the flight-path of NATO bombers heading for Belgrade; for much of that part of the conflict, the family home was without <b>electricity</b> <b>or</b> running water.|$|E
5|$|The episodes all {{contain a}} {{different}} set of enemies in their levels, which the player must kill, stun, or avoid. These enemies are typically aliens or robots. Levels can also include hazards, such as <b>electricity</b> <b>or</b> spikes; touching a hazard or most enemies causes Keen to lose a life, and the game is ended if all of Keen's lives are lost. Invasion of the Vorticons features a raygun that Keen can use ammo for to kill enemies; Keen Dreams exchanges this for flower power pellets that temporarily stun enemies when thrown, episodes four through six use a stun gun that permanently stuns enemies, and the 2001 Commander Keen has a stun gun that temporarily stuns enemies unless they are then killed with a pogo jump. The player can also find food items throughout the levels which grant points, with an extra life awarded with enough points. There are also colored keycards which grant access to locked parts of levels, collectable items that award an extra life beginning with episode four, and items that grant an instant extra life.|$|E

5|$|The heavy {{rainfall}} caused flooding in Camagüey that damaged about 5,700houses and destroyed 200. The flooding also damaged 15 schools and hospitals, {{as well as}} several crop buildings. The floods left widespread areas without <b>electricity</b> <b>or</b> communications. Six bridges were destroyed in central and western Cuba, which, in addition to damaged roads and rail lines, severely disrupted the country's transportation infrastructure. A total of 131roads were unpassable due to the flooding, and 55rail lines were damaged. The flood waters prompted officials to evacuate 65,000residents in low-lying areas, including using helicopters and amphibious vehicles. A tornado was reported in the city of Camagüey, destroying five Soviet planes and several buildings. By the day after the depression dissipated, the Cuban government reported nine deaths, although the death toll was later finalized at 37. The depression also killed thousands of livestock. Following the severe flooding, the Red Cross sent aid to the victims of Tropical Depression One in Cuba. The Red Cross had sent medical units, tents, blankets, and other necessary item to the victims by plane. Overall about 90,000people were affected.|$|E
