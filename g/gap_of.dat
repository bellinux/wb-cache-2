5|$|Cariappa {{was married}} in March 1937, in Secunderabad, to Muthu Machia, a forest officer's daughter. Though their married life was happy initially, later, {{due to an}} age <b>gap</b> <b>of</b> almost 17 years, ideological differences, and Cariappa's {{professional}} commitments, their marriage broke down. In September 1945, the couple separated without any formal divorce. Three years later Muthu died in an accident.|$|E

40|$|The band <b>gaps</b> <b>of</b> isostructural Bi 2 OS 2 and LaOBiS 2 were {{examined}} using optical absorption and discussed {{with the band}} structures calculated based on the crystal structures determined using synchrotron X-ray diffraction. The Bi 6 p and S 3 p orbitals in the Bi-S plane were computationally predicted to constitute the bands near the Fermi level. The optical reflectance spectra of Bi 2 OS 2 and LaOBiS 2 showed optical band <b>gaps</b> <b>of</b> ca. 1. 0 eV, which were close to the computationally calculated direct band <b>gaps</b> <b>of</b> ca. 0. 8 eV. Our results show that Bi 2 OS 2 and LaOBiS 2 are semiconductors containing direct band <b>gaps</b> <b>of</b> 0. 8 - 1. 0 eV, and they are suggested to be candidates for optoelectronic materials in the near-infrared region without highly toxic elements.

Sukumar earned another nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Director– Telugu at the 59th Filmfare Awards South, and a nomination for the Best Director– Telugu at the 1st South Indian International Movie Awards.|$|E
5|$|Alan Stern and Harold F. Levison {{introduced}} a parameter Λ (lambda), expressing {{the likelihood of}} an encounter resulting in a given deflection of orbit. The value of this parameter in Stern's model {{is proportional to the}} square of the mass and inversely proportional to the period. This value can be used to estimate the capacity of a body to clear the neighbourhood of its orbit, where Λ > 1 will eventually clear it. A <b>gap</b> <b>of</b> five orders of magnitude in Λ was found between the smallest terrestrial planets and the largest asteroids and Kuiper belt objects.|$|E
5|$|All {{the above}} Raman modes can be {{observed}} both as Stokes and anti-Stokes scattering. As mentioned above, Raman scattering from CNTs is resonant in nature, i.e. only tubes whose band gap energy {{is similar to the}} laser energy are excited. The difference between those two energies, and thus the band <b>gap</b> <b>of</b> individual tubes, can be estimated from the intensity ratio of the Stokes/anti-Stokes lines. This estimate however relies on the temperature factor (Boltzmann factor), which is often miscalculated – a focused laser beam is used in the measurement, which can locally heat the nanotubes without changing the overall temperature of the studied sample.|$|E

5|$|Arsenic is a grey, {{metallic}} looking solid. It has a {{density of}} 5.727 g/cm3 and is brittle, and moderately hard (more than aluminium; less than iron). It is stable in dry air but develops a golden bronze patina in moist air, which blackens on further exposure. Arsenic is attacked by nitric acid and concentrated sulfuric acid. It reacts with fused caustic soda {{to give the}} arsenate Na3AsO3 and hydrogen gas. Arsenic sublimes at 615°C. The vapour is lemon-yellow and smells like garlic. Arsenic only melts under a pressure of 38.6 atm, at 817°C. It is a semimetal with an electrical conductivity of around 3.9 × 104S•cm−1 and a band overlap of 0.5eV. Liquid arsenic is a semiconductor with a band <b>gap</b> <b>of</b> 0.15eV.|$|E

Tellurium is a semiconductor with an electrical conductivity of around 1.0S•cm−1 and a band <b>gap</b> <b>of</b> 0.32 to 0.38eV.
