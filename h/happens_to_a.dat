That is a unique element of Schiller's pragmatism.|$|E

25|$|Note: angular {{frequency}} ω (ω=2 π f) with the units of radians per second {{is often used}} in equations because it simplifies the equations, but is normally converted to ordinary frequency (units of Hz or equivalently cycles per second) when stating the frequency of a system. If the mass and stiffness {{of the system is}} known, the formula above can determine the frequency at which the system vibrates once set in motion by an initial disturbance. Every vibrating system has one or more natural frequencies that it vibrates at once disturbed. This simple relation can be used to understand in general what <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> more complex system once we add mass or stiffness. For example, the above formula explains why, when a car or truck is fully loaded, the suspension feels ″softer″ than unloaded—the mass has increased, reducing the natural frequency of the system.|$|E
25|$|In prehistoric times, chert {{was often}} used as a raw {{material}} {{for the construction of}} stone tools. Like obsidian, as well as some rhyolites, felsites, quartzites, and other tool stones used in lithic reduction, chert fractures in a Hertzian cone when struck with sufficient force. This results in conchoidal fractures, a characteristic of all minerals with no cleavage planes. In this kind of fracture, a cone of force propagates through the material from the point of impact, eventually removing a full or partial cone; this result is familiar to anyone who has seen what <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> plate-glass window when struck by a small object, such as an air gun projectile. The partial Hertzian cones produced during lithic reduction are called flakes, and exhibit features characteristic of this sort of breakage, including striking platforms, bulbs of force, and occasionally eraillures, which are small secondary flakes detached from the flake's bulb of force.|$|E
25|$|The ordinary, familiar, {{everyday}} {{things and}} occurrences we have, constitute occasions {{for the experience}} of God. Such things as one's daily sustenance, the very day itself, are felt as manifestations of God's loving-kindness, calling for the Berakhot. Kedushah, holiness, which is nothing else than the imitation of God, is concerned with daily conduct, with being gracious and merciful, with keeping oneself from defilement by idolatry, adultery, and the shedding of blood. The Birkat Ha-Mitzwot evokes the consciousness of holiness at a rabbinic rite, but the objects employed {{in the majority of}} these rites are non-holy and of general character, while the several holy objects are non-theurgic. And not only do ordinary things and occurrences bring with them the experience of God. Everything that <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> man evokes that experience, evil as well as good, for a Berakah is said also at evil tidings. Hence, although the experience of God is like none other, the occasions for experiencing Him, for having a consciousness of Him, are manifold, even if we consider only those that call for Berakot.|$|E

[...] In Outliers, he hopes to show {{that there are a lot}} more variables involved in an individual's success than society cares to admit, and he wants people to [...] "move away from the notion that everything that <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> person is up to that person". Gladwell noted that, although there was little that could be done with regard to a person's fate, society can still impact the [...] "man"-affected part of an individual's success. When asked what message he wanted people to take away after reading Outliers, Gladwell responded, [...] "What we do as a community, as a society, for each other, matters as much as what we do for ourselves. It sounds a little trite, but there's a powerful amount of truth in that, I think." ...|$|E
500|$|Kathie Lee Gifford, then a {{television}} hostess {{on the morning}} talk show Live with Regis and Kathie Lee, {{was the first of}} many celebrities to be spoofed in a South Park episode. The South Park creators said they chose Gifford completely at random, not based on any particular reason or distaste for her. Shortly after [...] "Weight Gain 4000" [...] aired, the tabloid The Globe hired Suzen Johnson to film herself seducing Frank Gifford, Gifford's husband, for a newspaper story. The incident was the first of what Parker and Stone called the [...] "South Park Curse", in which something tragic or embarrassing supposedly <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> celebrity shortly before or after they were featured in South Park. Actress Karri Turner provided the voice of Gifford in [...] "Weight Gain 4000", marking her first and only guest appearance on South Park. Gifford appears at a parade hidden inside a bulletproof glass bubble. The bubble was inspired by an appearance Pope John Paul II made in the Popemobile during a trip to Denver, which was attended by Parker and Stone. They thought the design of the Popemobile, which has a bulletproof booth built {{into the back of a}} modified truck, was [...] "hilarious". The design of the trophy that Gifford was to give to Cartman is a reference to Parker and Stone's 1997 film Orgazmo.|$|E
500|$|In {{the long}} term, {{the loss of}} muscle {{function}} can have additional effects from disuse, including atrophy of the muscle. [...] Immobility can lead to pressure sores, [...] particularly in bony areas, requiring precautions such as extra cushioning and turning in bed every two hours (in the acute setting) to relieve pressure. In the long term, people in wheelchairs must shift periodically to relieve pressure. [...] Another complication is pain, including nociceptive pain (indication of potential or actual tissue damage) and neuropathic pain, when [...] nerves affected by damage convey erroneous pain signals {{in the absence of}} noxious stimuli. Spasticity, the uncontrollable tensing of muscles below the level of injury, occurs in 65–78% of chronic SCI. It results from lack of input from the brain that quells muscle responses to stretch reflexes. [...] It can be treated with drugs and physical therapy. Spasticity increases the risk of contractures (shortening of muscles, tendons, or ligaments that result from lack of use of a limb); this problem can be prevented by moving the limb through its full range of motion multiple times a day. [...] Another problem lack of mobility can cause is loss of bone density and changes in bone structure. Loss of bone density (bone demineralization), thought to be due to lack of input from weakened or paralysed muscles, can increase the risk of fractures. Conversely, a poorly understood phenomenon is the overgrowth of bone tissue in soft tissue areas, [...] called heterotopic ossification. [...] It occurs below the level of injury, possibly as a result of inflammation, and <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> clinically significant extent in 27% of people.|$|E

2500|$|The idea of Hell {{was highly}} {{influential}} to {{writers such as}} Jean-Paul Sartre who authored the 1944 play [...] "No Exit" [...] {{about the idea that}} [...] "Hell is other people". Although not a religious man, Sartre was fascinated by his interpretation of a Hellish state of suffering. C.S. Lewis's The Great Divorce (1945) borrows its title from William Blake's Marriage of Heaven and Hell (1793) and its inspiration from the Divine Comedy as the narrator is likewise guided through Hell and Heaven. Hell is portrayed here as an endless, desolate twilight city upon which night is imperceptibly sinking. The night is actually the Apocalypse, and it heralds the arrival of the demons after their judgment. Before the night comes, anyone can escape Hell if they leave behind their former selves and accept Heaven's offer, and a journey to Heaven reveals that Hell is infinitely small; it is nothing more or less than what <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> soul that turns away from God and into itself.|$|E
2500|$|Survival is {{the term}} used for what <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> person after he/she has already {{developed}} or contracted a serious illness. [...] Although happiness {{has been shown to}} increase health, with survival, {{this may not be the}} case. Survival may be the only area of health that evidence suggests happiness may actually be sometimes detrimental. It is unclear why exactly research results suggest this is the case, however Diener & Biswas-Diener offer an explanation. It is possible that happy people fail to report symptoms of the illness, which can ultimately lead to no treatment or inadequate treatment. Another possible reason may be that happy people tend to be optimistic, leading them to take their symptoms too lightly, seek treatment too late, and/or follow the doctor’s instructions half-heartedly. And lastly, Diener & Biswas-Diener suggest that people with serious illnesses may be more likely to choose to live out the rest of their days without painful or invasive treatments.|$|E
2500|$|During Nancy's {{relationship}} with Jake Dean, Nancy's character was rapidly transformed {{due to her}} abuse {{at the hands of}} Jake. Fox told a journalist from OK! that when the relationship begins Jake is [...] "very controlling" [...] towards Nancy and he takes away [...] "all the things that made Nancy Nancy – the way she was opinionated and outspoken". She explained that during the storyline Nancy acts out of character which she found challenging to portray. She added that Nancy's abuse at the hands of Jake is psychological abuse rather than physical abuse. Sacre explained that Nancy wants to call off the wedding but Jake [...] "dismisses her concerns and insists the wedding goes ahead. He's kind of bulldozing his way through it all". He added that Jake Nancy still does not feel the wedding is right after he makes the arrangements but Jake still [...] "keeps on pushing and pushing and she gives in". Sacre said that Nancy regrets marrying Jake as soon as she has gone through with the wedding. Jake [...] "ends up trying to force himself on her on their wedding night". Sacre commented that in reaction to this Jake [...] "plays the victim and tries to blame Nancy for what's happened". The actor revealed that while Jake is in [...] "a desperate state" [...] he accidentally tells Nancy that he made allegations that she was having a sexual {{relationship with}} a pupil. Nancy is [...] "incensed", and Fox explained that this revelation is the [...] "final straw" [...] for Nancy who declares the marriage is over as this admission [...] "really shows Jake’s true colours" [...] to her. Fox stated that she and the production team were careful not to have the character return to her previous self, saying: [...] "We've tried really hard to make sure that Nancy didn't just snap back into her old self after the whole Jake incident last year. There's always a bit of darkness with her.
