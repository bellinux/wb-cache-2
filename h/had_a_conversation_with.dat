25|$|His {{commentary}} {{touched on}} many of the day's important issues. Following a 1966 trip to South Vietnam, he commented that prolonging the war would be unwise and that the US would be better off pursuing a negotiated settlement. He also helped keep alive another Murrow tradition at CBS that began with the interview show Person to Person. On Conversations with Eric Sevareid, he interviewed such famous newsmakers as West German Chancellor Willy Brandt, novelist Leo Rosten and others. In somewhat of a spoof of this tradition he also <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> King George III, portrayed by Peter Ustinov, titled The Last King in America.|$|E

25|$|Nick Hornby's {{book was}} optioned by Disney's Touchstone Pictures in 1995 where {{it went into}} {{development}} for three years. Disney executive Joe Roth <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> recording executive Kathy Nelson who recommended John Cusack and his writing and producing partners D. V. DeVincentis and Steve Pink adapt the book. She had worked previously with them on Grosse Pointe Blank and {{felt that they had}} the right sensibilities for the material. According to Cusack, DeVincentis is the closest to the record-obsessive characters in the film, owning 1,000 vinyl records and thousands of CDs and tapes. They wrote a treatment that was immediately greenlit by Roth.|$|E
25|$|As {{liaison officer}} to the 11th Indian Division, Moses twice {{narrowly}} escaped ambushes. On 11 February 1942, he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> Bennett's aide, Lieutenant G. H. Walker, {{in which he}} {{expressed a desire to}} escape if Singapore fell, as seemed likely at that point. Five days later, Moses, Bennett and Walker escaped from Singapore in a sampan, and made their way to Sumatra. They crossed Sumatra to Padang, on its west coast, from whence they flew to Java. In Batavia, Moses was knocked down by a taxi, fracturing his ribs. He was diagnosed with scrub typhus, and placed on the dangerously ill list. He was evacuated by a Dutch freighter and taken to Perth where he was hospitalised at the 110th and 113th General Hospitals. After the war he strongly supported Bennett's decision to escape from Singapore.|$|E

Even though 50 Cent confirmed Chris Brown was {{on the album}}, Banks later denied this {{in an interview with}} XXL. In an interview with XXL, Banks confirmed that he had wanted to have Prodigy on the track with Styles P on the album. Banks confirmed that he had <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> R singer Ashanti to possibly collaborate for the album. In mid October, a YouTube video containing footage of Banks in the studio with both Gucci Mane and Waka Flocka Flame was released, in which they were supposedly recording a song for the album. Lloyd Banks originally said that Nipsey Hussle would be on the album, but this didn't happen.|$|E

500|$|Clark {{has said}} that he began to truly define his {{politics}} only after his military retirement and the 2000 presidential election, won by George W. Bush. Clark <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> Condoleezza Rice in which she told him that the war in Kosovo would not have occurred under Bush. Clark found such an admission unsettling, as he had been selected for the SACEUR position because he believed more in the interventionist policies of the Clinton administration. He said he would see it as a sign that things were [...] "starting to go wrong" [...] with American foreign policy under Bush. Clark supported the administration's War in Afghanistan in response to the September 11, 2001, attacks but did not support the Iraq War. Clark continued to warn people as a commentator on CNN that he believed the United States was undermanned in Iraq. He said the war was [...] "never ... WMD or regime change" [...] and believes [...] "the connection to the War on Terrorism was not shown." ...|$|E

500|$|Box Car Racer was {{conceived}} by Blink-182 guitarist/vocalist Tom DeLonge and formed {{during a break}} from touring. The trio's European tour {{in the winter of}} 2001 was delayed {{in the aftermath of the}} September 11 attacks, and rescheduled dates in early 2002 were also canceled due to DeLonge's back problems, the result of a herniated disc. He began taking painkillers and developed [...] "neurosis-inducing side effects." [...] DeLonge had felt [...] "bummed out" [...] and creatively stifled while recording the group's previous album, Take Off Your Pants and Jacket. On the ensuing tour, he and Blink drummer Travis Barker would jam [...] "every day," [...] and Barker introduced him to post-hardcore music. [...] DeLonge had previously been derisive of any other styles of music, but soon embraced acts like Fugazi, Quicksand, Rocket from the Crypt, and Pitchfork. He began writing heavier-sounding guitar riffs; the first riff he created became part of the song [...] "All Systems Go". Barker, in his 2015 memoir Can I Say, maintains that he asked DeLonge if they should use the riffs for a new Blink album. [...] "I honestly thought that Tom had already <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> [...] about this. They were so tight—inseparable—I couldn't imagine Mark didn't know," [...] Barker writes.|$|E
500|$|In a February 11, 2011 Entertainment Weekly article, veteran script {{supervisor}} Sandy Schklair {{announced that}} he desired credit for directing The Room. Schklair told EW shortly after being hired on as script supervisor, Wiseau became too engrossed with his acting duties to direct the film properly; according to Schklair, Wiseau then asked him to [...] "tell the actors what to do, and yell 'Action' and 'Cut' and tell the cameraman what shots to get." [...] The script supervisor {{also said that he}} <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> Wiseau in which he refused to give up the title of [...] "director", but asked Schklair to [...] "direct [...] movie." [...] The story is corroborated by {{at least one of the}} film's actors, who requested anonymity for the story. Wiseau has dismissed Schklair's comments. Greg Sestero's memoir The Disaster Artist about the making of The Room partially corroborates Schklair's version of events, describing him taking charge of numerous sequences in which Wiseau found himself unable to remember lines properly or adequately interact with the rest of the cast, but jokes that claiming directorial credit was like [...] "claiming to have been the Hindenburg's principal aeronautics engineer". Wiseau said of Schklair's assertion, [...] "Well, this is so laughable that… you know what? I don’t know, probably only in America it can happen, this kind of stuff." ...|$|E
