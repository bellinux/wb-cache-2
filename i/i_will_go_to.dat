I was trying to help end the killing and the war, but there were times when I was thoughtless and careless about it and I'm very sorry that I hurt them. And I want to apologize to them and their families. [...] <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> my grave regretting the photograph of me in an anti-aircraft gun, which looks like I was trying to shoot at American planes. It hurt so many soldiers.

Kunis said she tried her best to protect her and Culkin's privacy, noting that [...] "We don't talk about it to the press. It's already more high profile than I want it to be."

2500|$|On 1 April 2008 Akhtar {{was banned}} {{for five years}} for violating the players' code of conduct. The ban {{extended}} to all cricket for and in Pakistan. Despite the ban not preventing him from playing in the Indian Premier League, the IPL governing council decided not to allow Akhtar {{to play in the}} tournament {{until the end of the}} ban or unless it is lifted. IS Bindra, a member of the council, was quoted as saying, [...] "Even though they [...] have cleared him to play for IPL, we felt that international discipline needs to be respected." [...] Meanwhile, Akhtar vowed to go to great lengths to fight the ban, [...] "I will appeal, as is my right. If that fails <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> court, if that fails then <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the Supreme Court." [...] On 3 April, Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Nasim Ashraf served a legal notice on Akhtar, calling on him to retract statements he made to a news channel, alleging the ban was punishment in return for refusing to give the chairman a share of his earnings from the Indian Premier League, Ashraf also sought damages of Rs 100 million (approximately US$1.6million) for [...] "defaming him personally" [...] and an additional Rs 100million to the Pakistan Cricket Board for [...] "sullying the name of the Pakistan Cricket Board and the Pakistan Cricket team." [...] A three-man appellate tribunal announced on 30 April that they had temporarily upheld Akhtar's five-year ban, deciding to revist the appeal hearing in June. Despite Akhtar's later retracting his claims and also issuing an unconditional apology for [...] "any grief or embarrassment that may have been caused to the nation, particularly to the Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Dr Nasim Ashraf", Ashraf's legal counsel filed a Rs 220million (approx US$3.37million) defamation suit against Akhtar in a civil court in Lahore on 2 May. On 4 May, the Pakistan Cricket Board's appellate tribunal suspended the five-year ban for one month, until they reconvene on 4 June, allowing Akhtar to take part in the ongoing Indian Premier League. A day later, the Pakistan Cricket Board announced that they will no longer pursue the defamation suit following a reconciliation between Akhtar and chairman Nasim Ashraf at the house of Rehman Malik, a key political official, in Islamabad. [...] "My honour has been vindicated and now the defamation lawsuit will not be pursued," [...] Ashraf was quoted as saying.|$|E
2500|$|General Hindman reacted {{quickly to}} what he {{perceived}} as Burleson’s fear and refusal to fight.

2500|$|Hawking has {{estimated}} that he studied about a thousand hours during his three years at Oxford. These unimpressive study habits made sitting his finals a challenge, {{and he decided to}} answer only theoretical physics questions rather than those requiring factual knowledge. A first-class honours degree was a condition of acceptance for his planned graduate study in cosmology at the University of Cambridge. Anxious, he slept poorly the night before the examinations, and the final result was on the borderline between first- and second-class honours, making a viva (oral examination) necessary. Hawking was concerned that he was viewed as a lazy and difficult student. So, when asked at the oral to describe his future plans, he said, [...] "If you award me a First, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Cambridge. If I receive a Second, I shall stay in Oxford, so I expect you will give me a First." [...] He was held in higher regard than he believed; as Berman commented, the examiners [...] "were intelligent enough to realise they were talking to someone far cleverer than most of themselves". After receiving a first-class BA (Hons.) degree in natural science and completing a trip to Iran with a friend, he began his graduate work at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, in October 1962.|$|E
