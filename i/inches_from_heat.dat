50|$|The {{process begins}} by {{pressing}} the tobacco leaves into a cake about an <b>inch</b> thick. <b>Heat</b> <b>from</b> fire or steam is applied, and the tobacco {{is allowed to}} ferment. This is said {{to result in a}} sweet and mild tobacco. Finally the cake is sliced. These slices must be broken apart, as by rubbing in a circular motion between one's palms, before the tobacco can be evenly packed into a pipe. Flavoring is often added before the leaves are pressed. English Cavendish uses a dark flue or fire cured Virginia (DEC), which is steamed and then stored under pressure to permit it to cure and ferment for several days or weeks.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1964 This thesis {{investigated}} {{the methods of}} failure in the webs of built up girders. The beams had rectangular holes five and one-half inches wide and seven and one-half inches high with rounded corners in a web fourteen inches deep between flanges. The longitudinal position of the hole edge varied <b>from</b> four <b>inches</b> to sixteen <b>inches</b> <b>from</b> the support. The results of the test were compared to analytical analysis for failure by column action, plate buckling and shear in the web. Failure occurred by local crippling in the web in the test beams with holes four and eight <b>inches</b> <b>from</b> the support. The test beams with holes 12 inches and 16 <b>inches</b> <b>from</b> the support failed by yielding of the web under the applied load. The test results indicated that further study is needed of local stress effects {{at the edge of}} the holes...|$|R
