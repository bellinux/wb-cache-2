500|$|Gasol is very {{athletic}} and quick for a 7-footer (213cm), {{allowing him to}} play both the power forward and center positions, much like fellow European players Toni Kukoč and Dirk Nowitzki. He is a refined scorer in the post and midrange; his overall game is near-ambidextrous and {{makes it difficult for}} opposing teams to defend. Gasol uses a variety of midrange jumpers, hook shots, up-and-under moves, and shot fakes to score very efficiently. In addition, his foot speed relative to his size allows him to run the fast break and finish effectively. He is also a skilled passer for a big man, earning 3.2 assists per game over his career. Defensively, he is an above-average shot blocker with a career average of 1.7 blocks per game. Former Lakers teammate Kobe Bryant said of Gasol, [...] "You'd be <b>hard-pressed</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a big [...] with his skill set {{in the history of the}} game." ...|$|E
500|$|GamesTM said [...] "It's one {{of those}} mixed-bag {{situations}} – flashes of genius and genuinely enjoyable moments of success, occasionally mired by unbalanced weapon damage, clumsy AI and the odd bit of unfair level design that requires astounding feats of memory". Eurogamer called XIII [...] "a flawed masterpiece. A game brimming with variety and a freshness lacking {{from most of the}} factory farmed franchise exercises that pass through our offices with crushing regularity". Game Revolution complimented the game's story, graphical style, voice acting and soundtrack, while criticising the gameplay as [...] "about as straightforward – and in some cases boring – as it gets for an FPS". Electronic Gaming Monthly scored the game 6.5/6.5/6.5: Joe Fielder, the first reviewer, said, [...] "You'd be <b>hard-pressed</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a more visually stunning game than XIII", but complained that [...] "numerous frustrations pile up to make XIII more chore than thrill". The magazine's Greg Ford, who provided the third review, said that its [...] "style, cut-scenes, and story are all great, [...] the actual gameplay is pretty mundane"; he concluded, [...] "But if {{all you need is a}} solid shooter fix, XIII will do just fine. It has no fatal flaws, and the conspiracy-laced story should keep you going".|$|E

Dolegiewicz testified {{as part of}} the governmental review. He admitted to distributing drugs and also his own personal usage, which spanned over a decade.

5000|$|The {{album was}} rated 4 out of 5 stars by Allmusic, Christianity Today, Indie Vision Music and Louder Than the Music. Ron Augustine of Christianity Today {{wrote that the}} album [...] "sounds exactly as a 'final album' should. It is a Mount Everest of worship rock albums, never to be topped." [...] Indie Vision Music's Joshua Hedlund wrote [...] "they went all out for their last hurrah. There’s {{something}} for everyone in this double-disc opus, from corporate worship anthems to personal prayers to instrumental jams spanning {{a wide range of}} dynamics." [...] Hedlund wrote that [...] "from the opening chimes to the closing hymns, it's almost too much, and you probably won’t want to listen to all of it all the time, but you'll definitely want to explore it all year long." [...] Jono Davies of Louder Than the Music called the album [...] "a piece of musical art" [...] and [...] "a truly stunning piece of music" [...] that [...] "will be enjoyed by everyone who hears it." [...] At Allmusic, James Christopher Monger wrote that the release [...] "finds the sextet firing on all cylinders, offering up an elaborate two-disc swan song that stays true to their modern worship vision while elevating it to a whole new level." [...] Finally, Monger felt that [...] "one would be <b>hard-pressed</b> <b>to</b> not <b>find</b> something <b>to</b> love here".|$|R

2500|$|Reviews of {{the second}} {{publication}} were generally positive and more widespread. Marc Gilman of AllMusic said that [...] "the music on [...] album is unique and powerful" [...] and that someone [...] "would be <b>hard-pressed</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> any imitators of [...] revolutionary musical form." [...] The Magnet commented that the three tracks can be [...] "served up as staggering psychedelia for a headphone or surround-sound context," [...] voting it #38 on their list of the best albums from 1993 to 2003. The NME called it a [...] "genuine classic," [...] noting the variety of sounds present in the album. Pitchfork founder and critic Ryan Schreiber remarked that, of the many experimental bands around, Godspeed You! Black Emperor were [...] "one of the few that [...] left out beauty and emotion in their pieces." [...] Pitchfork later ranked the album #45 on their list of the top 100 albums of the 1990s.|$|E
2500|$|Paul's {{announcement}} {{that he is}} not [...] "ashamed" [...] (epaiscúnomai) of his gospel because it holds power (dúnamis). These two verses form a backdrop {{for the rest of the}} book. First, we note that Paul is unashamed of his love for this gospel that he preaches about Jesus Christ. He also notes that he is speaking to the [...] "Jew first." [...] There is significance to this, but much of it is scholarly conjecture as the relationship of Paul the Apostle and Judaism is still debated. We are <b>hard-pressed</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> an answer to such a question without knowing more about the audience in question. Wayne Brindle argues, based on Paul's former writings against the Judaizers in Galatians and 2Corinthians, that rumors had probably spread about Paul totally negating the Jewish existence in a Christian world (see also Antinomianism in the New Testament and Supersessionism). Paul may have used the [...] "Jew first" [...] approach to counter such a view.|$|E
2500|$|Drake Hogestyn {{was fired}} in 2007 {{as a way to}} shrink down the budget. Later, in an attempt to {{stabilize}} ratings, he was brought back in 2008. As a result, it provided many storyline opportunities for the couple. However, with a vastly shrinking budget things didn't pan out as planned. Days of Our Lives was renewed in 2008, but the budget was slashed severely by 40%. To make do with the new restrictions, executive producer Ken Corday was forced to fire his two highest paid actors, Deidre Hall and Drake Hogestyn. Critics slammed the show for their firings, with TV Guide's Nelson Branco saying in an interview, [...] "The show became uglier after Hall and Hogestyn left the airwaves. Many claim {{it was the beginning of}} the end for our industry. You’d be <b>hard-pressed</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> anyone who would disagree with that statement." [...] Matt Mitovich said their exit was, [...] "Truly the end of an era, as daytime television says goodbye to 'Days of Our Lives' John Black and Dr. Marlena Evans on Friday, Jan. 23. Drake Hogestyn and Deidre Hall, aka John and [...] "Doc," [...] have nearly 12,000 Days appearances between them over the past 32 years. As such, they will leave behind many memories for fans of NBC's long-running (and now only) sudser. The iconic couple will create another magical moment when they say goodbye to Salem and loved ones following this week's hospital bedside wedding ceremony." ...|$|E

2500|$|Eric Diep of XXL said, [...] "Oxymoron fits {{as another}} chapter in Q's journey for rap supremacy. It's {{hard to tell}} if Q will take Kendrick's throne off this debut, but you'd be <b>hard-pressed</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> anyone who hasn't already thought about it. The LP ends with [...] "Fuck LA", an outro that embodies both his appeal and {{potential}} to be an even bigger threat in rap." [...] David Amidon of PopMatters said, [...] "Unlike his previous efforts Oxymoron picks a brand of momentum and sticks to it, avoiding the peaks and surprises that have so often signified a ScHoolboy Q project. But once the songs open up, once the mind begins latching onto whatever phrases happen to stand out from track to track alongside the larger personal narrative and getting lost in the blunted haze provided by Mike Will, Sounwave, Alchemist and Nez & Rio among others, it's hard to remain as aloof as initial impressions might feel." [...] Omar Burgess of HipHopDX stated, [...] "Ultimately the good moments are on par with what will be considered 2014's high-water marks, and if held they weren't held to the high standards of Setbacks and Habits & Contradictions, Q's low points would be acceptable from another rapper. Given TDE's ever-increasing appeal, Oxymoron isn't quite an elite offering, but it meets {{the difficult task of}} attracting casual fans without straying too far from the formula that attracted ScHoolboy Q's core audience." [...] David Jeffries of AllMusic said, [...] "The wonders never cease on this adventurous and street-tough effort, but they never sort themselves well, either, and with accessible highlights like [...] "Blind Threats," [...] "Break the Bank," [...] and [...] "Man of the Year" [...] all bundled toward the end, this LP requires a surprising amount of patience, especially for an album with [...] "featuring 2 Chainz" [...] on its track list." ...|$|E
