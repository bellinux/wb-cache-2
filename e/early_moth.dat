A beetle scuttled out upon the gravel path and bored onwards, its six legs all working hard, butting up against stones, upsetting itself on ridges, but still gathering itself up and rushing onwards to some all-important appointment somewhere in the grass plot.

40|$|Mnesampela privata is an Australian {{geometrid}} moth that {{is considered}} to have resource-driven outbreaks. An autumnal oviposition/larval development cycle is considered the "norm" in this species, but spring/summer activity has also been observed. This apparent plasticity of phenology and probable concomitant changes in voltinism have not been considered as possible causes of moth outbreaks. We developed GumMoth, a retrospective phenological model for M. privata that uses temperature to predict development times of immatures. Photoperiod determines whether individuals undergo direct development or pupal diapause. We used known catch dates of moths (in the same moth-active season or 365 -day period) to simulate population phenologies on the Australian mainland (27 ° 28 ’S to 38 ° 14 ’S) and in Tasmania (40 ° 54 ’S to 42 ° 57 S). GumMoth successfully simulated phenological patterns that accorded with published records and demonstrated {{for the first time}} that multivoltinism is possible in M. privata. In seven paired simulations using dates for first and last <b>moth</b> catches, the <b>earliest</b> <b>moth</b> activity resulted in the pupae of four out of 11 generations undergoing diapause, whereas the latest moth activity resulted in pupae of five out of eight generations undergoing diapause (diapause individuals emerged the following moth-active season). Almost two-thirds of offspring of spring/summer active moths reached adulthood within that same moth-active season (i. e. no delay in development), whereas those of autumn active moths always reached adulthood the following moth-active season (i. e. development was delayed). Records from foresters and in the scientific literature confirmed that the more common autumn phenology is supplemented by spring/summer activity in many localities. At half of these localities, populations that required insecticide control or caused substantial defoliation also developed. Because plantation eucalypts are suitable M. privata hosts for only four to five tree-growth seasons after planting, local moth populations must increase quickly if an outbreak is to occur. We suggest that large populations are more likely when plantations are colonised in the first moth-active season after planting and population growth commences in the spring/summer of each year. Foresters can use catch dates and regional weather data in GumMoth to estimate the numbers and phenology of generations of M. privata.

Furthermore, caterpillars trade off the relative benefits of protection from predation and feeding, when branches that provide the best protection from predation do not contain food. Finally, both the preferred microhabitat and the strength of caterpillars’ preferences for that habitat change with size: small caterpillars prefer branches with small twigs over branches with large twigs, and the reverse is true of large caterpillars; and preferences tend to be stronger in larger caterpillars, perhaps because of their increased detectability and desirability to predators...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{early history}} of the Lepidoptera is poorly known, a feature {{attributable}} to an inadequate preservational potential and an exceptionally low occurrence of moth fossils in relevant mid-Mesozoic deposits. In this study, we examine a particularly rich assemblage of morphologically basal moths that contribute significantly toward the understanding of early lepidopteran biodiversity. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Our documentation of <b>early</b> fossil <b>moths</b> involved light- and scanning electron microscopic examination of specimens, supported by various illumination and specimen contrast techniques. A total of 20 moths were collected from the late Middle Jurassic Jiulongshan Formation in Northeastern China. Our principal results were the recognition and description of seven new genera and seven new species assigned to the Eolepidopterigidae; one new genus with four new species assigned to the Mesokristenseniidae; three new genera with three new species assigned to the Ascololepidopterigidae fam. nov.; and one specimen unassigned to family. Lepidopteran assignment of these taxa is supported by apomorphies of extant lineages, including the M 1 vein, after separation from the M 2 vein, subtending an angle greater than 60 degrees that is sharply angulate at the junction with the r-m crossvein (variable in Trichoptera); presence of a foretibial epiphysis; the forewing M vein often bearing three branches; {{and the presence of}} piliform scales along wing veins.

40|$|A major {{innovation}} in angiosperms is {{the recruitment of}} animal pollinators {{as a means to}} enhance the efficiency and specificity of pollen transfer.

We used these plants to study the behaviour of the hawkmoth pollinator, Manduca sexta. Plants with larger limbs were preferentially visited, consistent with the notion that flower size affects visibility under low light conditions. The moths also displayed an innate preference for shorter tubes. However, in those cases that flowers with long tubes were chosen, the animals fed for equal time.

40|$|The primary {{olfactory}} centres of most vertebrates {{and most}} neopteran insects {{are characterized by}} the presence of spherical neuropils, glomeruli, where synaptic interactions between olfactory receptor neurons and second-order neurons take place. In the neopteran insect taxa investigated so far, receptor neurons of a specific physiological identity target one glomerulus and thus bestow a functional identity on the glomerulus. In moths, input from pheromone-specific receptor neurons is received in a male-specific structure of the antennal lobe, called the macroglomerular complex (MGC), which consists of a number of specialized glomeruli. Each glomerulus of the complex receives a set of peripheral sensory afferents that encode one of several compounds involved in sexual communication. The complex is also innervated by dendritic branches of antennal lobe output neurons called projection neurons, which transfer information from the antennal lobe to higher centres of the brain. A hypothesis stemming from <b>earlier</b> work on <b>moths</b> claims that the receptor neuron innervation pattern of the MGC should be reflected in the pattern of dendrites of projection neurons invading the different MGC glomeruli. In this study we show that in the noctuid moth Trichoplusia ni, as in several other noctuid moth species, this hypothesis does not hold.

40|$|Background: Moths {{have evolved}} highly {{successful}} mating systems, relying on species-specific mixtures of sex pheromone components for long-distance mate communication. Acyl-CoA desaturases are key enzymes in the biosynthesis of these compounds {{and to a}} large extent they account for the great diversity of pheromone structures in Lepidoptera. A novel desaturase gene subfamily that displays Delta 11 catalytic activities has been highlighted to account for most of the unique pheromone signatures of the taxonomically advanced ditrysian species. To assess the mechanisms driving pheromone evolution, information is needed about the signalling machinery of primitive moths. The currant shoot borer, Lampronia capitella, is the sole reported primitive non-ditrysian moth known to use unsaturated fatty-acid derivatives as sex-pheromone. By combining biochemical and molecular approaches we elucidated the biosynthesis paths of its main pheromone component, the (Z,Z) - 9, 11 -tetradecadien- 1 -ol and bring new insights into the time point of the recruitment of the key Delta 11 -desaturase gene subfamily in moth pheromone biosynthesis. Results: The reconstructed evolutionary tree of desaturases evidenced two ditrysian-specific lineages (the Delta 11 and Delta 9 (18 C> 16 C)) to have orthologs in the primitive moth L. capitella despite being absent in Diptera and other insect genomes. Four acyl-CoA desaturase cDNAs were isolated from the pheromone gland, three of which are related to Delta 9 -desaturases whereas the fourth cDNA clusters with Delta 11 -desaturases. We demonstrated that this transcript (Lca-KPVQ) exclusively accounts for both steps of desaturation involved in pheromone biosynthesis. This enzyme possesses a Z 11 -desaturase activity that allows transforming the palmitate precursor (C 16 : 0) into (Z) - 11 -hexadecenoic acid and the (Z) - 9 -tetradecenoic acid into the conjugated intermediate (Z, Z) - 9, 11 -tetradecadienoic acid. Conclusion: The involvement of a single Z 11 -desaturase in pheromone biosynthesis of a non-ditrysian moth species, supports that the duplication event leading to the origin of the Lepidoptera-specific Delta 11 -desaturase gene subfamily took place before radiation of ditrysian moths and their divergence from other heteroneuran lineages. Our findings uncover that this novel class of enzymes affords complex combinations of unique unsaturated fatty acyl-moieties of variable chain-lengths, regio- and stereo-specificities since <b>early</b> in <b>moth</b> history and contributes a notable innovation in the early evolution of moth-pheromones...|$|R

Weather related hazards resulted in losses over 25 % virtually {{each year in the}} Gauteng growing region due to hail, frosts and floods; losses occurred less than once every five years, for example due to extremely high temperatures, in the Sandveld area where growers take a risk by producing potatoes in hot summers. Regarding the biotic factors, every pest or pathogen assessed was reported to occur on at least one farm in each growing region. Countrywide the lowest frequency of 50 % was recorded for powdery scab whereas the insects tuber moths, leaf miners and aphids were reported most frequently, by between 88 % and 98 % of the growers. The complex of silver scurf and black dot resulted in the greatest yield losses in all growing regions, followed closely by tuber <b>moth,</b> <b>early</b> blight and the blackleg/soft rot disease complex. Yield losses due to potato virus Y, potato leaf roll virus and aphids were not reported as being very severe. When the growers' perceptions of severity of biotic factors were accumulated, significant differences between the regions appeared, with the Eastern Cape most prone with an accumulated score of 700 due to an array of pests and diseases, and the North-West with a score of only 50 mainly attributed to root knot nematodes. Growers were also asked how frequently biocides were applied to potato to control soil-borne organisms (nematicide and seed treatment), foliar fungi or insects. There were no significant correlations between frequency of biocide applications and severity of the disease as reflected in yield losses, most likely because growers use biocide applications as insurance against pests and diseases. This is common among crop farmers around the world. Although potato production in South Africa appears to carry more risks than production elsewhere, South African commercial potato growers are economically competitive when compared to growers {{in other areas of the}} globe, with comparable planting conditions and risks. </p...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} visual anti-predator strategies {{employed by}} the Lepidoptera. I examine key aspects of pattern and behaviour and how {{they relate to the}} reduction of an individual’s predation risk. Symmetrical patterns {{have been found to be}} easier to remember and pick out, suggesting that symmetry is beneficial to aposematic displays. This suggests that symmetry may be maladaptive in cryptic patterning and asymmetry beneficial. In Chapter one, I report the results of a field experiment using artificial prey and wild birds to investigate how asymmetry and symmetry affect the efficiency of cryptic patterning to reduce predation. I found that asymmetry does not affect predation rate, in agreement with previous work. Yet, there is still the problem of how to mesh this with the potentially conflicting conclusions of symmetry studies. Chapter two examines aspects of the intimidation hypotheses of Lepidopteran eyespots. These address the generally larger and more centrally placed spots found on Lepidopteran wings and state that they startle or intimidate predators, providing time for escape. While it is agreed that eyespots intimidate or startle predators, the mechanism has not been agreed. There are two competing lines of thought 1) that ‘eyespots’ intimidate because they resemble the eyes of the predators’ own predators and 2) that it is the conspicuous colouration of the pattern that induces the startle or avoidance behaviour. The first experiment utilised artificial prey with differing ‘directions of gaze’ in a field setting. If purely conspicuous patterns direction of gaze should have no influence on prey survival. The results indicate that patterns imitating staring or upward gazes provide the greatest protection, suggesting that in some cases eyespots may be being perceived as eyes and not simply as conspicuous patterns. I wanted to see if it would be possible to find a way in which to measure or quantify the reaction of an animal to ‘real’ eyes, in order to compare it to the reaction to eyespots. Recent trials investigating human reactions to eye contact suggested a computer based method may be possible. In this second experiment we examined whether the direct gaze of a predator might produce a measurable effect in human subjects. I was not able find any effect, but it is unclear as to whether this is due to problems with the experimental set up. In Chapter three I investigate a factor often over looked in the study of crypsis, that of the behavioural adaptations that can enhance its efficiency. The larvae of the <b>early</b> thorn <b>moth</b> (Selenia dentaria) masquerade as twigs, using both colouration and behaviour adaptations. I compared the angle at which the larvae rested, to the angle at which real twigs deviate from the main stem. The results found that the larvae showed variation in their angle of rest and do not appear to match the angle of real twigs on the host tree. This result suggests that perfectly matching the angles of real twigs is not necessary to twig mimicry. While carrying out this experiment it was noticed that a breeze appeared to increase larval activity and induced a ‘swaying’ behaviour. This led me to examine whether mimic species may utilise the visual ‘noise’ produced by windy conditions to camouflage movement. Firstly, a small ‘proof of concept’ pilot was carried out, followed by a larger study using 2 different twig mimic species. The study involved measuring movement and swaying behaviour in 3 conditions (still air, wind setting 1 and 2). The results suggest that cryptic and mimetic lepidopteran species may use windy conditions to camouflage their movements and that some species may employ specialised ‘swaying’ behaviours. Cryptic species are limited in opportunities to move between foraging sites without increasing detection by predators, therefore, any adaptation that might reduce detection is extremely advantageous. In Chapter four I examine how conspicuousness and colouration are affected by living in a group, particularly in relation to other group members. A field experiment using groups of artificial prey, with differing densities and group sizes was used to explore the effect of group size and density on the predation risk and detectibility of cryptic prey. My results show that, as expected, larger groups are more likely to be detected, but that the increase is much slower than a linear increase. This suggests that groups must increase considerably in size before any individual group member will suffer increased predation risk. The second experiment examines the ‘oddity effect’ and how it affects predation. This hypothesises that when confronted by grouped prey, predators can increase their kill rate by concentrating their efforts on capturing unusual or ‘odd’ prey, a strategy that reduces the ‘confusion effect’. A field experiment was conducted with groups composed of differing proportions of two artificial cryptic prey types. Groups with odd individuals did not suffer an increase in conspicuousness and were not attacked more often. However, once located and attacked the groups did suffer a greater predation rate. Odd individuals were predated at a greater rate than normal individuals and the rate did not change as more or less odd individuals were added to the group. A computer based ‘game’ was used to further investigate the oddity effect. The results from the initial run of the game appeared to show strong evidence for the oddity effect, with a further significant increase in this effect when attention is split between foraging for prey and scanning for predators. To be confident of this result the experiment was repeated with the ‘odd’ and ‘normal’ seed patterns reversed. The new data set strongly suggested that much of the effect seen in the previous experiment was due to a difference in pattern visibility between the two seed patterns. Nevertheless, the results indicated that selecting odd seeds is quicker than selecting normal seeds. The results from both the field and computer trials suggest that preference for odd prey may improve predator foraging speed and efficiency. Chapter five investigates whether cryptic and non-defended prey could reduce their predation risk by grouping with aposematic and defended prey. This was tested using artificial prey in a field setting. My results show that undefended non-aposematic prey can benefit by grouping with aposematic prey with no evidence that predation rates for aposematic prey were adversely affected by this association. If confirmed this might illuminate the origins of Batesian mimicry. I have investigated a range of anti-predator adaptations and strategies in the Lepidoptera and in particular pattern elements and use of crypsis and aposematic displays. These anti-predator strategies are important in that they modify predation rate and so directly influence the evolution of species. While I have been able to provide evidence for some current hypotheses, in many respects my results demonstrate that there is still a lot to learn about visual anti-predatory strategies.
