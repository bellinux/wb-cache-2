5|$|Auditory camouflage, {{at least}} in the form of noise reduction, is practised in various ways. The {{rubberized}} hull of military submarines absorbs sonar waves and {{can be seen as a}} form of auditory camouflage. Some modern helicopters are designed to be quiet. Combat uniforms are usually equipped with buttons rather than snap <b>fasteners</b> or velcro to reduce noise.|$|E
5|$|Buttons have {{traditionally}} been made {{from a variety of}} freshwater and marine shells. At first they were used decoratively rather than as <b>fasteners</b> and the earliest known example dates back five thousand years and was found at Mohenjo-daro in the Indus Valley.|$|E

50|$|The <b>fastener</b> {{serves the}} {{functions}} of both a lock washer and a nut. As the <b>fastener</b> is tightened in the nut the prongs are drawn inward until they exert pressure on {{the root of the}} thread on the <b>fastener.</b> When the <b>fastener</b> is tightened, the base of the nut, which is arched, elastically deforms and applies a force to the <b>fastener,</b> which locks it from loosening under vibrations.|$|R

5|$|The {{construction}} of the airframe was fairly conventional, with a semi-monocoque frame and multi-spar wing. The aircraft used a measure of magnesium and titanium in the fuselage, the latter limited largely to {{the area around the}} engines and to <b>fasteners.</b> Titanium was still expensive and not widely used because it was difficult to machine.|$|E
5|$|To {{produce the}} 767, Boeing formed {{a network of}} {{subcontractors}} which included domestic suppliers and international contributions from Italy's Aeritalia and Japan's CTDC. The wings and cabin floor were produced in-house, while Aeritalia provided control surfaces, Boeing Vertol made the leading edge for the wings, and Boeing Wichita produced the forward fuselage. The CTDC provided multiple assemblies through its constituent companies, namely Fuji Heavy Industries (wing fairings and gear doors), Kawasaki Heavy Industries (center fuselage), and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (rear fuselage, doors, and tail). Components were integrated during final assembly at the Everett factory. For expedited production of wing spars, the main structural member of aircraft wings, the Everett factory received robotic machinery to automate the process of drilling holes and inserting <b>fasteners.</b> This method of wing construction expanded on techniques developed for the 747. Final assembly of the first aircraft began in July 1979.|$|E
50|$|A {{torque to}} yield <b>fastener</b> (TTY) is {{mounting}} hardware {{in the form}} of a <b>fastener</b> which is torqued beyond the state of elasticity and therefore undergoes plastic deformation, causing it to become permanently elongated. Torquing a <b>fastener</b> to yield results in a high preloading of the <b>fastener</b> which, depending on the load frequency and amplitude, can significantly increase the fatigue life of the <b>fastener.</b> When the applied load doesn't surpass the clamping force of the <b>fastener,</b> the strain of the <b>fastener</b> will be lower than when the preloading is smaller than the applied load. It is therefore beneficial in high-frequency high-load situations with a higher risk of fatigue related failure, like a bolted down cylinder head, to use torque to yield bolts.|$|R

25|$|Knock-down <b>fasteners</b> usually {{consist of}} cam dowels locked by cam locks, {{also known as}} conformat <b>fasteners,</b> {{installed}} in adjacent members. The members are brought together and the joint is secured by turning the cam-lock.|$|E
25|$|The {{preferred}} bolt preload {{for structural}} applications {{should be at}} least 75% of the fastener's proof load for the higher strength <b>fasteners</b> and as high as 90% of the proof load for permanent <b>fasteners.</b> To achieve the benefits of the preloading, the clamping force must be higher than the joint separation load. For some joints, multiple <b>fasteners</b> are required to secure the joint; these are all hand tightened before the final torque is applied to ensure an even joint seating.|$|E
25|$|In some applications, joints are {{designed}} so that the fastener eventually fails before more expensive components. In this case, replacing an existing fastener with a higher strength fastener can result in equipment damage. Thus, it is generally good practice to replace old <b>fasteners</b> with new <b>fasteners</b> of the same grade.|$|E

40|$|A {{coupling}} device is disclosed which is mechanically two fault tolerant for release. The device comprises a <b>fastener</b> plate and <b>fastener</b> body, {{each of which}} is attachable to a different one of a pair of structures to be joined. The <b>fastener</b> plate and body are coupled by an elongate toggle mounted at one end in a socket on the <b>fastener</b> plate for universal pivotal movement thereon.

40|$|Abstract: Phased Array ultrasonics {{was chosen}} as the {{inspection}} method to detect first-layer, faying surface fatigue cracks around <b>fastener</b> holes beneath the <b>fastener</b> heads, without removal of the <b>fastener.</b> A novel inspection technique for rapidly and reliably inspecting the area around <b>fastener</b> holes for cracks and corrosion has been developed with no moving parts. The Phased Array design consists of a three-dimensional matrix of 504 ultrasonic elements on a cone that encircles the <b>fastener</b> head. Full circumferential scans are performed by programming the phased array focal laws to scan 360 o of the <b>fastener</b> holes, using a combination of the following scan patterns: pulse-echo at 45 o incident on the crack, pulse-echo at 90 o, plus local scanning. This capability allows flexible coverage of the <b>fastener</b> hole and surrounding area, again with no moving parts. Additionally, the beam deflection capability means that one probe is adaptable {{to a wide range of}} <b>fastener</b> diameters and skin thickness. Numerical modeling along with experimental results was used to determine the optimal values for inner and outer radii of the cone, angle of the cone, number of elements and arrangement of the elements. Two complete prototype conical arrays were subsequently built. The final portion of this project included developing the specific inspection procedures, an...|$|R
