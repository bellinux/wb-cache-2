She then, {{according}} to the proposed reconstruction of the crime, rejoined the group of campers around a campfire and fed one of her sons a can of baked beans, {{before going to the}} tent and raising the cry that a dingo had taken the baby. It was alleged that at a later time, while other people from the campsite were searching, she disposed of the body.|$|E

He finds Bianca instead, and is {{surprised}} to see that she is pregnant. He later finds an unconscious Kendall.

There is, however, enough room for Zach and Kendall's children to ride <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> the ambulance. Zach and Bianca stay behind and discuss Kendall's fate. They also discuss Bianca's secret that she is pregnant with Zach's child via sperm donation, and Bianca's new lover named Reese. Zach had agreed to father Bianca's child for the couple, but did not know that she had gone through with the procedure of artificial insemination, until now. The two wonder how Kendall, who is unaware of this pregnancy, will react to the news when they tell her. As Zach and Bianca continue to talk, Bianca goes into labor. Zach helps deliver the new child into the world.|$|E

[...] Rob Sheffield of Blender magazine described the track as gem that hit hard. Rick Bell of Country Standard Time said Taylor Swifts best efforts were Swift self-penned song, including [...] "Our Song", which [...] "she sings with stirring conviction." [...] Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine said the song [...] "follow time-tested narrative conventions and, more often than not, build to massive pop hooks." [...] Fiona Chua of MTV Asia selected the track as a choice cut from Swift's second studio album, Fearless.

When the story received an A, Chabon recalls, [...] "I thought to myself, 'That's it. That's what I want to do. I can do this.' And I never had any second thoughts or doubts." [...] Referring to popular culture, he wrote of being raised [...] "on a hearty diet of crap". His parents divorced when Chabon was 11, and he grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Columbia, Maryland. Columbia, where Chabon lived nine months of the year with his mother, was [...] "a progressive planned living community in which racial, economic, and religious diversity were actively fostered."

2500|$|When Game signed onto Aftermath Entertainment, it {{was later}} {{arranged}} that he would work with 50 Cent and his hip hop group G-Unit. The sudden feud between the pair, who had been marketed as having a mentor/protégé relationship, started soon afterwards. The two were able to put their differences aside {{for the release of}} The Game's debut album, The Documentary which was released on January 18, 2005. The album was a success for Game and had three singles that featured 50 Cent. The release date of 50 Cent's second album, The Massacre, was pushed back in order to accommodate Game's album, causing a rift between 50 Cent and Interscope Records. Tensions would rise during the filming of the music video for Game's third single, [...] "Hate It or Love It", when 50 Cent refused to shoot a scene <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> a car with Game, instead sitting in the back (Game's brother, Big Fase 100, would replace him).|$|E

6000|$|She was {{appointed}} {{one of a}} committee to draught By-laws for its government. It may be observed, without overplus of irreverence, that this was larks for her.

When her Church was reorganized, by-and-by, the By-laws were retained. She saw to that.

2500|$|... 91 bullets {{were fired}} of which 45 hit the bodyguards, {{who were all}} killed. 49 shots came from a single weapon, an FNAB-43 submachine gun, and 22 from another of the same model.

Ricci and Leonardi, who were sitting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> the first car, were killed first.

The only policemen who was able to shoot back was Iozzino, but he was immediately hit in the head by Bonisoli. The blue Fiat 132 was found at 9:40 AM in Via Licinio Calvo with some blood stains inside. The other cars used for the ambush were also found in the following days in the same road (according to the declarations of Red Brigade members, the cars had been left in the road that same day).|$|E
2500|$|The {{two boys}} {{got into trouble}} with the law for {{breaking}} into a locked van and stealing computers. In January 1998, they were charged with mischief, breaking and entering, trespassing, and theft. They both left good impressions on the juvenile officers, who offered to expunge their criminal records if they agreed to attend a diversionary program to include community service, received psychiatric treatment, and obeyed the law. Harris was required to attend anger management classes where, again, he made a favorable impression. They were so well-behaved that their probation officer discharged them from the program a few months earlier than the due date. Of Harris, it was remarked that he was [...] "a very bright individual who is likely to succeed in life", while Klebold was said to be intelligent, but [...] "needs to understand that hard work is part of fulfilling a dream." [...] On April 30, Harris handed over the first version of a letter of apology he wrote to the owner of the van, which he completed the next month. In the letter, Harris expressed regret about his actions; however, in one of his journal entries dated April 12, he wrote: [...] "Isnt america supposed to be the land of the free? how come, If im free, I cant deprive some fucking dumbshit from his possessions If he leaves them sitting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> his fucking van in plain sight in the middle of fucking nowhere on a fri-fucking-day night?
