50|$|While at the Tour de France {{road race}} in France in 1994, the Rohloffs went bicycling {{on the beach}} in France. The bikes got stuck in the sand, and the {{primitive}} <b>derailleur</b> <b>gear</b> systems would not work. This triggered Bernhard Rohloff to develop a new internally geared hub.|$|E
50|$|<b>Derailleur</b> <b>gears,</b> as on many bicycles, but fully enclosed.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: SRAM Dual Drive {{combination}} <b>derailleur</b> <b>gears</b> and {{hub gear}} ...|$|R
25|$|The {{overlapping}} ranges with <b>derailleur</b> <b>gears</b> {{mean that}} 24 or 27 speed <b>derailleur</b> <b>gears</b> may {{only have the}} same total gear range as a (much more expensive) Rohloff 14-speed hub gear. Internal hub geared bikes typically have a more restricted gear range than comparable derailleur-equipped bikes, and have fewer ratios within that range.|$|R
5000|$|Hub gears {{are sealed}} within the hub, which protects them from water, grit, and impacts. Thus hub gears usually require less {{maintenance}} {{and can be}} more reliable over time than comparable external <b>derailleur</b> <b>gear</b> systems, which may require more adjustments and replacement of parts (front chainrings, rear sprockets, narrow derailleur-chain).|$|E
50|$|The SRAM i-Motion {{series of}} {{products}} is a sport, urban, and trekking oriented product series developed and manufactured by SRAM Corporation. Branded i-Motion are internally geared hubs, shift levers, and dynamo hubs. Related to the i-Motion series are also changeable free or fixed single speed hubs, hybrid epicyclic and <b>derailleur</b> <b>gear</b> hubs, and hydraulic disc brakes. The i-Motion series of products were developed at SRAMs Schweinfurt R&D and manufacturing plant in Germany, formerly of Sachs.|$|E
50|$|Patents for {{built-in}} {{systems to}} change gear ratios appeared as early as 1890. Adler offered a three-speed gearbox bicycle in the 1930s. Several attempts to develop gearbox bicycles during the 2000s for downhill racing, such as the Honda RN-01 G-cross, incorporated complete <b>derailleur</b> <b>gear</b> drive trains in an enclosure. Around the same time Schlumpf Innovations and Hammerschmidt offered cranksets with two different gear ratios and just one chainring. Pinion launched their spur-gear system in the 2010s.|$|E
50|$|The Speedhub is more {{expensive}} than competing bicycle gear systems (both hub <b>gears</b> and <b>derailleur</b> <b>gears),</b> and it is about 500 to 1,000 grams heavier than a set of <b>derailleur</b> <b>gears,</b> but it offers the <b>gear</b> range of <b>derailleur</b> <b>gears</b> (and at its ratio of 5.26:1 more range than a typical road bike ratio of 4.28:1 with 50/34 chainrings and 11 to 32 tooth cassette) while requiring significantly less maintenance and having a longer service life. It is therefore mainly used in expensive touring bicycles and in mountain bikes, where its lack of (vulnerable) external components is useful.|$|R

50|$|In 1995, Sachs {{introduced}} the Elan, the first hub gear with 12 speeds, and an overall range of 339%. Three years later, Rohloff {{came out with}} the Speedhub 500/14, a gear hub with 14 speeds and a range of 526%, comparable to that of a 27 speed <b>derailleur</b> <b>gear</b> system, and also sufficiently robust and lightweight for mountain biking. In 2007, NuVinci started manufacturing continuously variable transmission ("stepless") ∞-speed hubs for commuter bicycles, with an increasing range of about 380% (2016).|$|E
50|$|Inter 8 - The Inter 8 has {{interval}} percentages {{between the}} gears of 22,16,14,18,22,16,14, {{and a total}} range of 307%, comparable to a road bike <b>derailleur</b> <b>gear</b> systems, but as the other Nexus products, it is designed and intended for urban commuter use. The hub comes {{in a variety of}} versions, weighing between 1550 and 2040 grams stripped. The newest high end models are internally very similar to the Alfine model. The Inter 8 is more tolerant of shifting under load than the Inter 7.|$|E
50|$|The {{concept of}} a freehub was devised and {{manufactured}} by British company Bayliss-Wiley in 1938 and won the Cyclists Touring Club (CTC) award for that year. On the Bayliss-Wiley design the freewheel unit was threaded to accept the sprockets. A different four speed design was manufactured by BSA Cycles Ltd in 1949 to accompany their BSA 4 Star <b>derailleur</b> <b>gear.</b> The BSA design had a splined freewheel unit (BSA part No.8-1913) which attached to the hub shell (BSA part No.8-701) and carried four sprockets.|$|E
50|$|A single-speed bicycle {{is a type}} of bicycle with {{a single}} gear ratio. These {{bicycles}} are without <b>derailleur</b> <b>gears,</b> hub gearing or other methods for varying the gear ratio of the bicycle.|$|R
50|$|<b>Derailleur</b> <b>gears</b> {{generally}} have an efficiency around 95%; a few percentage {{points higher than}} other gear types.|$|R
50|$|At commuter/recreational power levels, current hub gears are {{typically}} about 2% less efficient than reasonably maintained <b>derailleur</b> <b>gears.</b>|$|R
5000|$|BSA {{produced}} the first Sunbeam bicycle catalogue in 1949 and produced its own '4 Star' <b>derailleur</b> <b>gear</b> with an associated splined cassette hub and 4 sprocket cassette.

50|$|The most {{important}} characteristics about a racing bicycle are its weight and stiffness which determine the efficiency {{at which the}} power from a rider's pedal strokes can {{be transferred to the}} drive-train and subsequently to its wheels. To this effect racing bicycles may sacrifice comfort for speed. The drop handlebars are positioned lower than the saddle in order to put the rider in a more aerodynamic posture. The front and back wheels are close together so the bicycle has quick handling. The <b>derailleur</b> <b>gear</b> ratios are closely spaced so that the rider can pedal at their optimum cadence. Other racing bicycles, especially those used in time trialling, prioritize aerodynamics over comfort.|$|E
50|$|In 1906, the ACP {{gave the}} job of organising brevet rides - so called after the card, or brevet, that riders had signed along the route to show they had ridden the {{distance}} - to Desgrange. There came a row, however, that led Desgrange {{to take over the}} Audax movement for himself. The first reason was that the ACP ran an event called the Polymultipliée de Chanteloup, one of several competitions popular at the time to show whether a <b>derailleur</b> <b>gear,</b> then not in wide use, or a single gear was superior over a range of courses. The ACP formed a partnership for its competition with LEcho des Sports, a rival to Desgranges LAuto. The second reason was that the road captains were accused of no longer respecting the 18 km/h average demanded by the rules.|$|E
5000|$|Use of {{lightweight}} <b>derailleur</b> <b>gears</b> with a {{high number}} of ratios is impossible, although hub gears can be used ...|$|R
50|$|Randonneuring {{has much}} in common with cyclotouring, the founding-father of which is often said to be the {{journalist}} Velocio (Paul de Vivie), also credited with making <b>derailleur</b> <b>gears</b> popular.|$|R
50|$|In general, {{a modern}} bicycle frame {{intended}} for <b>derailleur</b> <b>gears</b> {{will have a}} vertical dropout, while one designed for singlespeed or hub gears will have horizontal dropouts or track fork ends.|$|R
5000|$|The Bianchi {{reputation}} {{began when}} the company sponsored Giovanni Tommasello, {{the winner of the}} Grand Prix de Paris sprint competition in 1899. Fifteen years later it was making 45,000 bicycles, 1,500 motorcycles and 1,000 cars a year. In 1935 Bianchi sponsored Costante Girardengo, one of the first Italian stars on the road, and its bicycle sales rose to 70,000 a year. In 1950 Fausto Coppi won the Paris-Roubaix on a Bianchi equipped with what was later named the Campagnolo Paris-Roubaix <b>derailleur</b> <b>gear,</b> for which Bianchi bicycles featured the necessary special drop-outs until 1954. He won the race by two and a half minutes on a bicycle equipped with Universal brakes, Bianchi steel handlebars and stem, a Regina chain and a four-speed freewheel with shaped teeth. It also had Nisi rims, Campagnolo hubs and Pirelli tyres. It was made for sale only in 57 and 59 cm, smaller than the bike that Coppi used. [...] A variation known as the Campione Del Mondo followed Coppi's win in the 1953 world championship.|$|E

5000|$|In 1966, Huffman {{introduced}} a new long-wheelbase bicycle frame called the Rail. The new frame was approximately 4" [...] to 5" [...] longer than previous models. The new frame became Huffman's base model until 1968. In 1968, {{in an effort to}} market a children's bicycle with an automotive theme, Huffman designers added a car-type steering wheel in place of handlebars to the Rail frame, which became the Huffy Wheel. Tall [...] "stick-shift" [...] <b>derailleur</b> <b>gear</b> shift levers mounted on the frame top-tube imitated the gearshift levers of popular muscle cars of the day, while many banana-seat cycles were fitted with tall chromed sissy bar passenger backrests {{at the rear of the}} seat. In mid-1968, Huffman released the Flaming Stack chain guard, which was designed to look like the distinctive side exhaust pipe covers on the Corvette sports car. Later that same year, Huffman released a new Slingshot model with 16" [...] front dragster wheel, and 20" [...] rear. The new 1969 models where the last year for the three-bar Rail frame style. In 1970 Huffman deleted their three-bar frame and went to a two-bar Rail frame, eventually adding additional two-tone fade paint jobs along with Persons striped seats. These designs continued in production until 1971 when new safety and manufacturing restrictions from the BMA (Bicycle Manufacturers Association), the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and other U.S. federal agencies forced the discontinuance of the Wheel, the top-tube mounted [...] "stick-shift", the [...] "sissy bar", and many other stylized features of children's bicycle designs.|$|E
5000|$|The {{drive wheel}} is a 20" [...] bicycle wheel with <b>derailleur</b> <b>gears.</b> Various tyres can be {{selected}} {{to suit the}} ice surface. Spikes are not used on a 400m ice oval.|$|R
25|$|A single-speed bicycle {{is a type}} of bicycle with {{a single}} gear ratio. These {{bicycles}} are without <b>derailleur</b> <b>gears,</b> hub gearing or other methods for varying the gear ratio of the bicycle. Adult single-speed bicycles typically have a gear ratio of between 55 and 75 gear inches, depending on the rider and the anticipated usage.|$|R
50|$|The {{back folding}} mechanism, which folds beneath the frame, doesn't retain chain tension when folded if <b>dérailleur</b> <b>gears</b> are fitted (unlike the Brompton for example). Again, {{this has been}} solved on the Mk 3.|$|R
5000|$|Common {{on older}} {{motorcycles}} and older bicycles (e.g. those with hub gears) this clip method {{cannot be used}} on bicycles fitted with <b>derailleur</b> <b>gears,</b> as the clip will tend to catch on the gear-changers.|$|R
5000|$|Paul de Vivie, {{who wrote}} as Vélocio (April 29, 1853 - [...] February 27, 1930), was {{publisher}} of Le Cycliste, an early champion of <b>derailleur</b> <b>gears,</b> {{and father of}} French bicycle touring and randonneuring.|$|R
50|$|Internal-geared hubs with 5, 7, 8, 11 or even 14 {{gear ratios}} {{have become an}} option in recent years because of their {{robustness}} and low maintenance. In particular, the Rohloff 14-speed hub with a gear range of over 500% has been used {{on at least two}} around-the world bicycle tours. Internal-geared hubs have a couple of advantages over traditional <b>derailleur</b> <b>gears,</b> in that they can use stronger chains as generally a single sprocket and chainring combination will be used. Secondly the spread of gears can be made more evenly, that is to say there are many duplicated and unusable <b>gears</b> in a <b>derailleur</b> <b>geared</b> setup.|$|R
50|$|Campagnolo {{introduced}} {{their first}} system of electronic shifting, EPS, {{in the same}} year. By 2012 Campagnolo had three electronic shifting groupsets available. Cyclists began to see a growing range of electronic alternatives to traditional mechanical shifting for <b>derailleur</b> <b>gears.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Ferris turned {{professional}} in 1936. [...] He was recruited by Raleigh Bicycle Company, along with Bert James and Charles Holland, to regain long distance records {{and to promote}} Sturmey-Archer hub gears against the new [...] "continental" [...] <b>derailleur</b> <b>gears.</b>|$|R
50|$|The eighth {{stage was}} won by Albino Binda (Alfredo's brother and team-mate). Alfredo himself later {{admitted}} that he advised his brother {{to escape from the}} group the moment he stopped to change a tire (common operation before the introduction of <b>derailleur</b> <b>gears).</b>|$|R
