5|$|Stargazy pie is a pastry-based fish pie which, by tradition, {{is filled}} with whole pilchards. Critically, the pilchards must retain their heads, which then poke through the pastry top, {{appearing}} to <b>gaze</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> stars. The position of the fish allows the oil that is released during cooking to drain into the pie, adding a fuller flavour and ensuring the pie is moist. The celebrity chef Rick Stein suggested also poking the pilchards' tails through the pie crust to give the effect of leaping through water.|$|E
5|$|This is not {{the world}} of Ally McBeal. It is not about finding love remedially. This is {{a world in which}} too many of us are asking what use is love if you find it too late. Yet somehow, {{probably}} because the moral judgments are lightly made, superannuated singletons such as myself can look on and see an advertisement for, rather than a warning against, that famously honourable estate—just as we do when we <b>gaze</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> more benign marriages of our friends. In Vanity Fair, Thackeray deliberately wrote a novel without a hero. We respond to Cold Feet because it, on the contrary, does not despise its characters.|$|E
5|$|Whistler was {{not entirely}} content with the realism the {{painting}} displayed in its original form, a trait he blamed on the influence Courbet had on him at the time. Later, between 1867 and 1872, he reworked it {{to give it a}} more spiritual expression. Even though Symphony was begun before Whistler first met Rossetti, the Pre-Raphaelite influence is still clear. The painting was an early experiment in white on white, with a woman standing in a white dress in front of a white background. This colour scheme was a subject he would return to later, in two paintings that would be given the titles of Symphony in White, No. 2 (1864) and Symphony in White, No. 3 (1865–67). The panel is long and slender, and the model's pose and the shape of her clothes further emphasise the vertical nature of the painting. The woman is bold, almost confrontational, in her direct <b>gaze</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> viewer, and her features are highly individualised. Art critic Hilton Kramer sees in Whistler's portraits a charm and a combination of craft and observational skills that his more radical landscapes lacked.|$|E

She was found by Alexis, who took her back inside. Stars next appeared on April 20, 2005. Sam and Jason were in Italy looking for Michael and stopped to gaze at a shooting star. Jason promised Sam that he would bring her back to Italy to spend time together. The star gazing later inspired Jason to buy Sam a star shaped necklace, which became a tangible item of the theme of stars in their relationship. Jason later gifted Sam with the star necklace on May 11, 2005 and Sam wore the necklace daily.|$|E

25|$|Rusk {{was born}} on November 20, 1871 in Knox County, Illinois to James A. and Josie A. Rusk. His family emigrated from Illinois to Washington Territory {{in the fall of}} 1874. They settled in eastern Klickitat County in an area known as Wood Gulch. In 1878, Rusk’s only sibling, Leah, was born. Several years later, in 1879, they moved {{to the foot of the}} Columbia Hills in the lower Klickitat Valley near Warwick. Over the next year, Rusk’s father built the Happy Home stage station. Rusk often went to the top of the Columbia Hills to <b>gaze</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> various peaks of the Cascade Range. They lived in this place until Rusk was 15. They then moved to a {{homestead}} on the banks of the Klickitat River near Soda Springs in January 1887.|$|E

2500|$|A Midrash {{interpreted}} the words [...] "For this commandment [...] [...] [...] {{is not in}} heaven" [...] in [...] to teach that Jews should not look for another Moses to come and bring another Torah from heaven, for {{no part of the}} Torah remained in heaven. Rabbi Hanina {{interpreted the}} words [...] "For this commandment [...] [...] [...] is not in heaven" [...] in [...] to teach that God gave the Torah with all its characteristic teachings of meekness, righteousness, and uprightness, and also its reward. Samuel interpreted the words [...] "For this commandment [...] [...] [...] is not in heaven" [...] in [...] to teach that the Torah is not to be found among astrologers who <b>gaze</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> heavens. When people countered that Samuel himself was an astrologer and also a great Torah scholar, he replied that he engaged in astrology only when he was free from studying the Torah — {{when he was in the}} bath.|$|E
2500|$|An alarmed, but cloistered, Pauline {{began to}} write letters to Thérèse and {{attempted}} various strategies to intervene. Eventually Thérèse recovered after she had turned to <b>gaze</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> statue of the Virgin Mary placed in Marie's room, where Thérèse had been moved. She reported on 13 May 1883 {{that she had seen}} the Virgin smile at her. She wrote: [...] "Our Blessed Lady has come to me, she has smiled upon me. How happy I am." [...] However, when Thérèse told the Carmelite nuns about this vision at the request of her eldest sister Marie, she found herself assailed by their questions and she lost confidence. Self-doubt made her begin to question what had happened. [...] "I thought I had lied – I was unable to look upon myself without a feeling of profound horror." [...] "For a long time after my cure, I thought that my sickness was deliberate and this was a real martyrdom for my soul." [...] Her concerns over this continued until November 1887.|$|E
