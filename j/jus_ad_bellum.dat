Such laws are not discussed in detail; however, given that the goal of the French mission in Algeria was to obtain commercial and military interest as opposed to self-defense, it can be deduced that Tocqueville would not concur with Just war theory's <b>jus</b> <b>ad</b> <b>bellum</b> criteria of just cause. Further, given that Tocqueville approved of the use of force to eliminate civilian housing in enemy territory, his approach does not accord with Just War Theory's jus in bello criteria of proportionality and discrimination.|$|E

Washburn University School of Law professor Craig Martin writes in [...] "Going Medieval: Targeted Killing, Self-Defense and the <b>Jus</b> <b>ad</b> <b>Bellum</b> Regime" [...] that self-defence is not an appropriate rationale for targeted killing because such a justification is restricted to conflicts between state actors. University of Tulsa School of Law professor Russell Christopher writes in [...] "Imminence in Justified Targeted Killing" [...] that self-defence should be ruled out as a suitable position in several examples of potential conflict. He critiques arguments by governments including the United Kingdom and the United States that self-defense {{can be used as}} a rationalization of action against imminent danger. Western Washington University emeritus philosophy professor Phillip Montague says in an essay titled [...] "Defending Defensive Targeted Killings" [...] that use of this tactic against combatants can be seen as defensible and justified acts against terrorism or those who assist terrorist organizations.|$|E

The definition of the ius <b>ad</b> <b>bellum</b> itself is reconsidered as a corpus of norms, including a prohibition of the use of force but also encompassing obligations to prevent this use of force by private actors such as PMSCs. This lato sensu definition may lead to a recognition of state responsibility irrespective {{of whether or not the}} acts of private contractors are attributable to the state. It is argued that when a state cannot be held accountable for the violation of ius <b>ad</b> <b>bellum</b> stricto sensu by a PMSC, as a next step in determining state responsibility, respect of the due diligence principle needs to be examined. Moreover, states may have a duty to harmonise their national legal systems in order to prevent ius <b>ad</b> <b>bellum</b> violations by private actors...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, <b>ad</b> <b>bellum</b> {{rules have}} been {{interpreted}} more leniently {{so as to}} permit forcible responses to terrorism. Yet the threshold level for an “armed attack” that legitimizes full-scale war in response has remained relatively high. This observation is especially puzzling insofar as customary international law reflects the practice of (strong) states, which, as we show, can benefit from credibly committing to lowering their tolerance towards terror attacks. Why is the threshold requirement relatively tolerant? What would be the critical mass of terror beyond which a full-scale war is legitimate? Under what circumstances are states expected to violate the <b>ad</b> <b>bellum</b> threshold requirement? This Article seeks compelling {{answers to these questions}} using game theory. We argue that a low <b>ad</b> <b>bellum</b> threshold requirement (an “intolerant strategy”) is a futile measure to fight terrorism, since normally it cannot underlie a renegotiation-proof equilibrium. Namely, were a strong state to seriously consider waging a full-scale war in response to repeated, low-level terror attacks sponsored by a weak state, both parties would be better off renegotiating their way back to the status quo ante. On the other hand, renegotiation may fail if transaction costs are high enough, which ultimately makes the intolerant strategy sustainable and the equilibrium level of terror lower. The overall conclusion is thus counterintuitive: an effective intolerant strategy in the War on Terror is beneficial for victim states, but implausible unless the barriers towards a nonviolent arrangement are sufficiently high...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{international}} humanitarian law and, more in particular, with the interplay between law and morality in connection to the equal application principle. My assumption is that this principle {{is of paramount importance}} for the effectiveness of {{international humanitarian law}} and I will argue that this principle is jeopardized by the comeback of just war thinking. I will approach this issue mainly from an historical point of view. Accordingly, I will, firstly, analyse the history of the relation between ius <b>ad</b> <b>bellum</b> and ius in bello emphasizing the reasons that can explain why the decline of the just war theory (intended here as a set of ius <b>ad</b> <b>bellum</b> criteria) allowed the emergence of modern ius in bello (“modern” {{to the extent that it}} is characterised by the equal application principle). I will, secondly, analyse the gradual widening of the scope of the claims that call for an abandonment of the equal application principle; significantly enough those claims in the aftermath of the Second World War were concerning only some provisions of international humanitarian law, those that do not have a humanitarian character, while nowadays such claims are concerning some of the most important principles of international humanitarian law, as the prisoner of war status. My purpose is, therefore, to show that the just war theory was envisaging ius <b>ad</b> <b>bellum</b> prohibitions rooted in morality in the lack of positive law prohibitions; given that this theory was rooted in morality, it gave a decisive weight on the justness of the belligerent parties and, accordingly, the just party had no ius in bello obligation and the unjust party had no ius in bello rights. Nowadays, there are positive ius <b>ad</b> <b>bellum</b> prohibitions and positive ius in bello rules and the respective legal instruments refrain to resort to morality as a criterion of legality. A comeback of just war thinking would integrate in this positive law framework an alleged moral content and would jeopardize international humanitarian law itself, given that the equal application principle if of fundamental importance for the effectiveness of this branch of international law...|$|R

50|$|Serious {{violations}} of {{international humanitarian law}} are called war crimes. International humanitarian law, jus in bello, regulates the conduct of forces when engaged in war or armed conflict.

40|$|Since 2006, the new {{counterinsurgency}} (“COIN”) doctrine has {{revolutionized the}} way the U. S. military and its allies think about war. While COIN literature has proliferated in this period, relatively little legal scholarship has examined the relationship of COIN to international law. The legal scholarship that has engaged with COIN is overwhelmingly positive and assumes that the doctrine accords with the dictates {{of the law of}} war. In espousing human rights and civilian protection as its core principles, COIN provided a common discourse that appeared to bridge the conceptual divide between legal humanitarians and neo-pragmatists. However, the rhetorical success of COIN has come with significant, and as yet unrecognized, costs. This article argues that COIN’s influence on the law of war has had counterintuitive consequences that should give both COIN proponents and humanitarians pause. In particular, in a paradoxical move, COIN puts significant pressure on the core tenet of the law of war – the civilian-combatant distinction – in order to achieve its strategic objective of greater civilian protection. While legal scholars have celebrated COIN for its purported alignment with the law of war’s humanitarian goals, I show how COIN lends itself equally to the sort of <b>jus</b> <b>ad</b> bellum/jus in bello conflation that many scholars rebuke as violative of these same goals. COIN is aligned with law, I argue, only insofar as it seeks to exclude insurgents/terrorists from the law of war’s discursive terrain. In refusing to engage insurgents’ <b>ad</b> <b>bellum</b> objectives, COIN perpetuates international law’s liberal statist bias. Rather than progressively developing the law of war, as legal scholars argue it does, COIN is profoundly conservative. I suggest that a more responsible approach would admit insurgents as legitimate parties to war, in order that their political objectives could be substantively engaged with...|$|R

I propose, without being able to provide further argument for this defini-tion here, the following definition of “guerrilla movement ” and “guerrilla”: A guerrilla movement is an armed movement with a seriously and publicly avowed goal or ideology that functions as its unifying force. It starts out ope-rating with small and mobile combat groups, using primarily tactics like am-bush, hit-and-run and the cutting of communication and supply lines, but it can in later phases of the conflict take the form of or create a regular army re-ady to fight pitched battles. It ceases to be a guerrilla movement when it defe-ats its enemy and establishes itself as the ruling power within the once conte-sted territory (or turns into a non-armed movement or is destroyed).
