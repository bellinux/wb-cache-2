50|$|While much of TEMPEST {{is about}} leaking {{electromagnetic}} emanations, it also encompasses sounds and mechanical vibrations. For example, {{it is possible}} to log a user's keystrokes using the motion sensor inside smartphones. Compromising emissions are defined as unintentional intelligence-bearing signals which, if intercepted and analyzed (side-channel attack), may disclose the information transmitted, received, handled, or otherwise processed by any <b>information-processing</b> <b>equipment.</b>|$|E

Next, note PC and other information-processing equipments are actually putted on the desk for the pupil or the student, and the use scenery ofthose equipment in the general classroom is produced,the use is examined, and considered.

50|$|In telecommunication, a {{controlled}} area {{is an area}} in which uncontrolled movement will not result in compromise of classified information, that is designed to provide administrative control and safety, or that serves as a buffer for controlling access to limited-access areas. It can also refer to an area to which security controls have been applied to protect an <b>information-processing</b> system's <b>equipment</b> and wirelines, equivalent to that required for the information transmitted through the system.|$|R
40|$|The current {{problem for}} {{managers}} in logistic and trading companies {{is the task}} of improving the operational business performance and developing the logistics support of sales. The development of logistics sales supposes {{development and implementation of}} a set of works {{for the development of the}} existing warehouse facilities, including both a detailed description of the work performed, and the timing of their implementation. Logistics engineering of warehouse complex includes such tasks as: determining the number and the types of technological zones, calculation of the required number of loading-unloading places, development of storage structures, development and pre-sales preparation zones, development of specifications of storage types, selection of loading-unloading equipment, detailed planning of warehouse logistics system, creation of architectural-planning decisions, selection of <b>information-processing</b> <b>equipment,</b> etc. The currently used ERP and WMS systems did not allow us to solve the full list of logistics engineering problems. In this regard, the development of specialized software products, taking into account the specifics of warehouse logistics, and subsequent integration of these software with ERP and WMS systems seems to be a current task. In this paper we suggest a system of statistical analysis of logistics information, designed to meet the challenges of logistics engineering and planning. The system is based on the methods of statistical data processing. The proposed specialized software is designed to improve the efficiency of the operating business and the development of logistics support of sales. The system is based on the methods of statistical data processing, the methods of assessment and prediction of logistics performance, the methods for the determination and calculation of the data required for registration, storage and processing of metal products, as well as the methods for planning the reconstruction and development of the existing warehouses. The results of approbation of software for the logistics of designing large warehouses of metal trading companies are given...|$|E
