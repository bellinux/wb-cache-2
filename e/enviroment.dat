40|$|Main {{object of}} my thesis is to analyse the {{problems}} of process called print <b>enviroment</b> optimization. The problems are solved generally and they're also explained by way of example in company Sklo Bohemia, a. s. Světlá nad Sázavou. This thesis is divided into theoretical and practical part. The theoretical part si divided into a few chapters. The main benefits of print <b>enviroment</b> optimization (cost reduction and documents securing) are analysed and described here. The first two chapters are about print <b>enviroment</b> optimization {{from the point of}} view of print administration, print billing and print securing. The third chapter is about own steps of print <b>enviroment</b> optimization. The last chapters are about specialized print software and also about some companies which deal with solution of optimization. The practical part evaluates and describes in detail solution of print <b>enviroment</b> optimization in the company Sklo Bohemia, a. s. Output data are analysed before and after completed optimization. Informations in theoretical part are drawn from electronic sources and technical articles. The practical part is a result of personal presence on process of optimization and consultation with employees. My thesis conducts a survey of mentioned problem and provides general summary about process called print <b>enviroment</b> optimization...|$|E

Localities were choosen with the aim to follow an {{urbanization}} gradient {{from the center of}} the city, through its periphery to small villages. The composition of a diet was studied by non-invasive method, by analysis of faeces.

40|$|Abstract. The {{development}} of the XCS Learning Classifier System [26] has produced a stable implementation, able to consistently identify the accurate and optimally general population of classifiers mapping a given reward landscape [15, 16, 29]. XCS is particularly powerful within directreward environments, and notably within problems suitable for commercial application [3]. The application of XCS within delayed reward environments has also shown promise, although early investigations were within <b>enviroments</b> with a comparatively short delay to reward (e. g. [28, 19]). Subsequent systematic investigation [19, 20, 1, 2] have suggested that XCS has difficulty accurately mapping and exploiting even simple environments with moderate reward delays. This paper summarises these results and presents new results that identify some limits and their implications. A modification to the error computation within XCS is introduced that allows the minimum error parameter to be applied relative to {{the magnitude of the}} payoff to each classifier. First results demonstrate that this modification enables XCS to successfully map longer delayedreward <b>enviroments.</b> ...|$|R
