40|$|URL] {{advances}} in computer vision and arc-welding technology motivate rethinking of some postulates and conventions {{incorporated in the}} existing robot off-line programming methods. This reserch addresses relaxing of the downhand-position assumption, which became a de-facto standard in robotic welding and requires the weld joint to be oriented in such way that the weldline is horizontal and the weld normal vector is directed strictly opposite to gravity. In contrast to the standard techniques, the developed method explicitly assumes that a weld may be processed in the out-of-position location, which differs from the <b>downhand</b> one within given tolerances. But, to ensure the prescribed quality, the corresponding <b>downhand</b> deviation is charged by reduction of the welding speed {{in order to satisfy}} the quality specifications. For such settings, it is proposed a novel method for the cluster-level welding operations planning for a robotic cell with a positioning table. The objective is to minimise the overall manufacturing time, by finding a reasonable trade-off between the positioner motion times and the cluster processing times, since ensuring the <b>downhand</b> orientation for each cluster reduces the cluster processing time but requires more time for the re-configuration of the positioner. It is shown, that associated optimisation problem may be presented as a specific case of the generalised traveling salesman problem, for which has been developed an efficient heuristic algorithm that produces both the optimal welding cluster sequence and corresponding optimal motions of the positioner. The algorithm effectiveness was verified for a number of randomly generated problems, which results are reported and analysed in detail. It is also presented an industrial case study confirming validity of the developed technique and its ability to generate, in reasonable amount of time, solutions accepted by practicing engineers...|$|E
40|$|There is no {{economic}} technology available {{to measure the}} fillet weld geometry on a regular basis. External aspects of a fillet weld can be easily measured using specifically designed gauges, but the internal characteristic of penetration cannot. To guarantee the structural integrity of a fillet weld {{it is important that}} there is enough penetration to ensure that the axis between the bar and the plate is effectively ‘cut’, see figure 1. A random study of the parameters set by welders showed wide ranging differences, some of which led to lack of penetration in the fillet weld. As a result of this finding, a programme of work has been put in place which relies on an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approach as a method to develop the optimum set of fillet welding parameters. Initial work on this showed that when welding vertically up, there were very few issues in developing a set of parameters. However, there was significant variation in the data when welding in the <b>downhand</b> position. It was concluded from this that the number of potential variables being measured and controlled involved would have to be increased. in order to produce a reliable ANN. This paper shows how the approach was developed to tackle the issue on welding in the <b>downhand</b> position. The use of a mechanised welding tractor was built into the project, and variations in torch angle, push-pull angle and stand-off were among the variables incorporated. Other potential variables such as the gap between the plate and the bar, the bar geometry and the gas type and gas flow rate have currently been kept constant. The progress to date will be presented...|$|E
40|$|A {{wide range}} of welding {{parameters}} and deposition geometry sizes of Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) process are predicted. Recent studies focus on optimizing a weld bead size by using mathematical models and using costly welding software. A lot of studies were focused on <b>downhand</b> welding position, some in horizontal position and few in vertical and overhead positions. They were also studies in butt joint design and few in T-fillet joint design. The scope of this research focused on the predicting welding parameters and welding deposition geometry on a T-fillet joint with GMAW process utilizing articulated robot. 1. 2 mm diameter of ER 70 S- 6 filler wire is used to produce fillet weld on 6 mm thickness of low carbon steel base metal and shielded by 100...|$|E
40|$|A {{generalized}} {{method for}} controlling a six degree-of-freedom (DOF) robot and a two DOF positioner used for arc welding operations is described. The welding path {{is defined in}} the part reference frame, and robot/positioner joint angles of the equivalent eight DOF serial linkage are determined via an iterative solution. Three algorithms are presented: the first solution controls motion of the eight DOF mechanism such that proper torch motion is achieved while minimizing the sum-of-squares of joint displacements; the second algorithm adds two constraint equations to achieve torch control while maintaining part orientation so that welding occurs in the <b>downhand</b> position; and the third algorithm adds {{the ability to control}} the proper orientation of a wire feed mechanism used in gas tungsten arc (GTA) welding operations. A verification of these algorithms is given using ROBOSIM, a NASA developed computer graphic simulation software package design for robot systems development...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} new type of splice joint, named flange bolted-welded hybrid joint, which is {{designed}} to splice I-shape beam to facilitate the construction of industrialized buildings. The flange, welded with the bottom beam flange as well as the web close to bottom flange, are jointed by high strength bolts. Stiffening plate is welded at top of the flange while <b>downhand</b> welding and high strength friction grip bolts are used for the top beam flange and the beam web, respectively. The connection reduces the construction period and costs. In this paper, monotonic and reversed cyclic loading tests were conducted on three full-scale specimens of this innovative joint, to investigate its load-bearing capacity, energy-dissipating capacity and failure modes. The results indicate that the joint has high load-bearing capacity and great ductility. The failure mode is due to the slippage of flange bolts as well as the gap development between the two flange plates. The experimental studies enabled improvement of the design of the connection to be used in moment-resisting steel frame structures.

40|$|The {{ability of}} manual metal arc welders to reach target heat input (HI) values between 1. 3 kJ/mm and 2. 9 kJ/mm by varying weld travel speed was examined. Weld process data was {{collected}} during the <b>downhand</b> and overhead welding of 6 highly restrained quenched and tempered (QT) steel plates and {{the results showed that}} the measured average H I values were closely matched to the target HI. However, there was considerable scatter, particularly at higher H I targets, which warranted investigation. The frequency at which welders achieved their target H I (or travel speed) decreased at higher H I values, but nonetheless the standard deviation (SD) from the average HI was less than 10 % for all target HI values, which is well within the average 15 % deviation allowed for a qualified weld in the Australian Pressure Vessel Standard, AS 3992 - 1998. The effect of localised variations in voltage on H I was also considered. Even though voltage fluctuated by as much as 40 % during the deposition of an electrode, the overall impact on arc energy H I was considered negligible because of the short duration at these ‘extreme ’ voltages. Moreover, {{it was found that the}} levels of diffusible hydrogen marginally decreased as H I increased, which lends support to the fact that HI is a contributor to weldment cooling rate. Additionally, differences in microstructure and hardness were also observed between low (1. 3 kJ/mm) and high (2. 9 kJ/mm) HI values in the diffusible hydrogen test (bead on plate) samples...|$|E
40|$|The main aims of {{this study}} are to {{generate}} a methodology for the optimisation of welding procedures for plasma welding of thin sheet aluminium alloys and to investigate weld quality modelling. Emphasis is focused on the recognition and evaluation of the consecutive stages of welding procedure development and on the formulation of a generalised procedural methodology that is potentially applicable to other processes and materials. The materials under investigation were 1. 6 mm thick sheet 6013, 2024 and 7475 alloys, representing the major medium and high strength heat treatable aluminium groups used in the aerospace industry. Initial experimentation generated procedures relating to specimen and equipment pre-weld preparation. Bead on plate and square butt joint trials were performed in the <b>downhand</b> position. The plasma keyhole mode was operated autogenously while filler wire addition was employed for the melt-in mode. Arc monitoring techniques were used to log the arc voltage and welding current values. The effect of background and control parameters on process performance and joint quality was studied and used to generate operating envelopes and reveal optimum welding conditions. Geometrical data from the melt-in joints of all alloys were employed to build joint geometry prediction statistical models. Numerical algorithms, based on the information generated by the statistical models, were used to create joint geometry optimisation techniques. Calorimetric experiments and x-ray examination of joints revealed the relationship between major operating parameters and arc efficiency and the incidence of porosity, suggesting desired welding conditions that were incorporated in the optimisation process. Finally, two software tools for Joint Geometry Prediction and Welding Procedure Optimisation were developed, incorporating the knowledge and information created during the modelling and optimisation stages. These provide the end user with a means of process parameter selection and visualisation of the influence of parameter variation on weld bead geometry...|$|E
