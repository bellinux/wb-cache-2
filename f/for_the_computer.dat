5|$|Automonopoli was {{released}} by Automata UK in June 1983, selling for £6 (£ as of 2015) Written primarily in BASIC, it modelled the board game Monopoly in every detail of gameplay. Although other versions of Monopoly for home computers were already in circulation for play between human players, {{at the time of}} its release Automonopoli was marketed as the first version of the game with an artificial intelligence advanced enough <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> to play against human players.|$|E
5|$|By 1961, MIT had {{acquired}} the DEC PDP-1 minicomputer, {{the successor to}} the TX-0, which also used a vector display system. The system's comparatively small size and processing speed meant that, like with the TX-0, the university allowed its undergraduate students and employees to write programs <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> which were not directly academically related whenever {{it was not in}} use. In 1961-62, Harvard and MIT employees Martin Graetz, Steve Russell, and Wayne Wiitanen created the game Spacewar! on the PDP-1, inspired by science fiction books such as the Lensman series. The game was copied to several of the early minicomputer installations in American academic institutions, making it potentially the first video game to be available outside a single research institute.|$|E

When Planetarian was released for Windows PCs on CD-ROM, Yumemi had full voice acting. The PlayStation 2 (PS2) port offers full voice acting for the entire cast. Other changes to the PS2 version include a higher resolution <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> graphics and an extended soundtrack. All other later versions contained full voice acting.|$|E
5|$|More {{than three}} years after its digital launch, Fez {{received}} a physical release designed by Fish and limited to a signed edition of 500 in December 2015. The deluxe package included the soundtrack and a stylized red notebook with gold foil inlay. Though Bédard had moved on to another company, he continued {{to work on the}} game in secret. In August 2016, he released a final patch <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> releases of Fez that included performance improvements, {{as a result of a}} unified codebase under an open source software library, and features such as a speedrun mode.|$|E
5|$|Paramount Pictures has {{produced}} thirteen Star Trek feature films, {{the most recent}} being released in July 2016. The first six films continue the adventures of the cast of The Original Series; the seventh film, Generations {{was designed as a}} transition from that cast to The Next Generation television series; the next three films, 8–10, focused completely on the Next Generation cast. Starting with the eleventh film, the movies take place in an alternate timeline with a new cast playing the original series characters. Leonard Nimoy portrays an elderly Spock in these films, providing a physical link to the original timeline. This alternate timeline has been named by CBS, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> game Star Trek Online, the Kelvin Timeline.|$|E

Yoshi's Island was released in Japan in August 5, 1995, and worldwide two months later. Some of its special effects were powered by a new Super FX2 microchip. The game was rereleased for the Game Boy Advance with few changes in 2002 under the title Yoshi's Island: Super Mario Advance 3. Nintendo later released this version via the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U Virtual Console.|$|E
5|$|Three {{programs}} were written <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>computer.</b> The first, consisting of 17instructions, {{was written by}} Kilburn, and so far as can be ascertained first ran on 21 June 1948. It was designed to find the highest proper factor of 218 (262,144) by trying every integer from 218−1 downwards. The divisions were implemented by repeated subtractions of the divisor. The SSEM took 3.5million operations and 52minutes to produce the answer (131,072). The program used eight words of working storage {{in addition to its}} 17words of instructions, giving a program size of 25words.|$|E
5|$|As Thompson began porting {{the game}} to the new system, {{he decided not to}} base the code on any of the {{existing}} software <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>computer,</b> and instead write his own. As a result, he implemented his own base code libraries for programs to use, including arithmetic packages and graphics subsystems. These initial subsystems were coded in assembly language on the GECOS system and assembled, then the output physically put on punched tapes to be carried over and inserted into the PDP-7. Thompson then wrote an assembler for the PDP-7 to avoid this laborious process. The game ran very slowly on the new machine, causing Thompson to branch out from there to design his own file system based on some ideas by Dennis Ritchie and Rudd Canaday, rooted in their experience with the Multics file system, with which he then ran Space Travel.|$|E
