At these intervals, a formal visual inspection is carried out and then followed by PAT testing.

50|$|A D-sub {{contains}} {{two or more}} parallel rows of pins or sockets usually surrounded by a D-shaped metal shield that provides mechanical support, ensures correct orientation, and may screen against electromagnetic interference. The part containing pin contacts is called the male connector or plug, while that containing socket contacts is called the female connector or socket. The socket's shield fits tightly <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>plug's</b> shield. Panel mounted connectors usually have threaded nuts that accept screws on the cable end connector cover that are used for locking the connectors together and offering mechanical strain relief. Occasionally the nuts may be found on a cable end connector if {{it is expected to}} connect to another cable end (see the male DE-9 pictured). When screened cables are used, the shields are connected to the overall screens of the cables. This creates an electrically continuous screen covering the whole cable and connector system.|$|R

50|$|The {{proximity}} pilot (or, plug presence) signal {{allows the}} EV to detect {{when it is}} plugged in. <b>Inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>plug</b> itself, a passive resistance is connected across PP and PE, which the EV then detects. PP does not connect between EV and EVSE. A plug with a closed retention clip is indicated by 480 Ω, and a plug with an open retention clip (i.e., pressed by the user) is indicated by 150 Ω. This allows the EV to inhibit movement while a charging cable is attached, and to cease charging as the plug is disconnected, {{so there is no}} load and associated arcing.|$|E
50|$|It is also {{possible}} for a plug valve {{to have more than}} two ports. In a 3-way plug valve, flow from one port could be directed to either the second or third port. A 3-way plug valve could also be designed to shift flow between ports 1 and 2, 2 and 3, or 1 and 3, and possibly even connect all three ports together. The flow-directing possibilities in multi-port plug valves are similar to the possibilities in corresponding multi-port ball valves or corresponding multi-port valves with a rotor. An additional possibility in plug valves is to have one port {{on one side of the}} plug valve and two ports on the other side, with two diagonal and parallel fluid pathways <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>plug.</b> In this case the plug can be rotated 180° to connect the port on the one side to either of the two ports on the other side.|$|E
5000|$|In September 2013, FCS {{introduced}} FCS II [...] a new pre-glass fin {{system to}} the market. The new system boasts {{a number of key}} advantages over its predecessors. Firstly, the need for any screws or tool to secure the fins has been eliminated; the fins now simply lock into the plugs. Secondly, {{the leading edge of the}} fin resides <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>plug,</b> and the base of the fins sit flush to the surface of the board creating a more seamless connection. The final key feature of the new system is that it’s backward compatible, meaning it will accept fins from the original dual tab system. Adding two grub screws and a small silicon insert allows you to secure your two tab fins into the new system. Many consider the new system inferior, Channel Islands Surfboards parted with FCS after the new system and Kelly Slater continues to surf the original FCS tabs on his Komunity Project fins.|$|E

40|$|Plugs, i. e. {{droplets}} {{formed in}} a microchannel, may revolutionize microfluidic cell-based assays. This study describes a microdevice that handles nanolitre-scale liquid plugs for {{the preparation of}} various culture setups and subsequent cellular assays. An important feature of this mode of liquid operation is that the recirculation flow generated <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>plug</b> promotes the rapid mixing of different solutions after plugs are merged, and it keeps cell suspensions homogeneous. Thus, serial dilutions of reagents and cell suspensions with different cell densities and cell types were rapidly performed using nanolitres of solution. Cells seeded through the plug processing grew well in the microdevice, and subsequent plug processing was used to detect the glucose consumption of cells and cellular responses to anticancer agents. The plug-based microdevice may provide a useful platform for cell-based assay systems in various fields, including fundamental cell biology and drug screening applications...|$|E
40|$|In this study, we {{investigate}} the steady propagation of a liquid plug in a two-dimensional channel lined by a uniform, thin liquid film. The liquid contains soluble surfactant that can exist {{both in the}} bulk fluid and on the air-liquid interface. The Navier-Stokes equations with free-surface boundary conditions and the surfactant transport equations are solved using a finite volume numerical scheme. The adsorption/desorption process of the surfactant is modeled based on pulmonary surfactant properties. As the plug propagates, the front meniscus sweeps preexisting interfacial surfactant from the precursor film, and the surfactant accumulates on the front meniscus interface. As the front meniscus converges on the precursor film from the region where the interfacial surfactant concentration is maximized, the Marangoni stress opposes the flow. In this region, the Marangoni stress results in nearly zero surface velocity, which causes the precursor film thickness near the meniscus to be thicker than the leading film thickness. Since the peaks of wall pressure and wall shear stress occur due to narrowing of the film thickness, the observed increase of the minimum film thickness weakens these stresses. In the thicker film region, however, the drag forces increase due {{to an increase in}} the surfactant concentration. This causes the overall pressure drop across the plug to increase {{as a result of the}} increasing surfactant concentration. A recirculation flow forms <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>plug</b> core and is skewed toward the rear meniscus as the Reynolds number increases. When no surfactant exists, the recirculation flow is in contact with both the front and the rear interfaces. As the surfactant concentration increases, the Marangoni stress begins to rigidify the front interface and forces the recirculation flow away from the front interface. Subsequently, the recirculation flow is directed away from the rear interface in a manner similar to that for the front interface. When the plug length is shorter, this change in recirculation pattern occurs at a smaller surfactant concentration...|$|E
40|$|Background: Quantitative MRI of {{articular}} cartilage has rapidly developed {{in recent years}} and provides the clinician with a noninvasive tool to determine the biological consequence of an intervention. Purpose: To evaluate the quality of intra-{{articular cartilage}}, using the dGEMRIC scanning technique, 1 year after TruFit implantation. The hypothesis was that implantation of a TruFit plug does not lead to damage at the opposing articular cartilage. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: A total of 13 patients (age, 32 ± 8 years) were evaluated with dGEMRIC at 12 ± 4 months after treatment of an osteochondral lesion by implantation of 1 or multiple TruFit plugs. The dGEMRIC scanning protocol was applied 90 minutes after intravenous Magnevist (0. 2 mmol/kg body weight) injection. Different regions of interest (ROIs) were defined: the femur cartilage, cartilage directly surrounding the implanted TruFit plug, the TruFit plug, and the articulating and nonarticulating tibia cartilage. The average dGEMRIC index (T 1 gd; magnetic resonance imaging relaxation time per ROI) was calculated by a pixel-by-pixel curve fitting using the Levenberg-Marquardt method. Differences between the mean T 1 gd of the individual ROI for all patients were tested using analysis of variance with post hoc Bonferroni correction. A P value <. 05 was considered statistically significant. Results: The average T 1 gd of the TruFit ROI (385 ± 74 ms) was comparable with those in the femur (409 ± 49 ms) and surrounding (392 ± 64 ms) ROIs (P ≥. 339). The average T 1 gds for the articulating (578 ± 133 ms) and nonarticulating (516 ± 118 ms) ROIs were higher compared with the femur (409 ± 49 ms), surrounding (392 ± 64 ms), and TruFit (385 ± 74 ms) ROIs (P <. 002), while no difference was observed between the tibia ROIs (P =. 160). Conclusion: Implantation of the TruFit plug in osteochondral lesions does not damage the opposing or surrounding surface, and newly formed tissue <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>plug</b> has cartilage-like dGEMRIC characteristics 12 months after implantation. The implantation of synthetic TruFit plugs is safe for the opposing cartilage, an item that is frequently discussed when using such materials to treat focal cartilage defects...|$|E
40|$|This work {{describes}} a novel and simple {{modification of the}} current microarray format. It reduces the sample/reagent volume to 1 ml and the hybridization time to 500 s. Both 20 mer and 80 mer oligonucleotide probes and singly labeled 20 mer and 80 mer targets, representative of the T-cell acute lymphocytic leuk-emia 1 (TAL 1) gene, {{have been used to}} elucidate the performance of this hybridization approach. In this format, called shuttle hybridization, a conventional flat glass DNA microarray is integrated with a PMMA microfluidic chip to reduce the sample and reagent consumption to 1 / 100 of that associated with the conventional format. A serpentine microtrench is designed and fabricated on a PMMA chip using a widely available CO 2 laser scriber. The trench spacing is compatible with the inter-spot distance in standard microarrays. The microtrench chip and microarray chip are easily aligned and assembled manually so that the microarray is integrated with a microfluidic channel. Discrete sample plugs are employed in the microchannel for hybridization. Flowing through the microchannel with alternating depths and widths scrambles continuous sample plug into discrete short plugs. These plugs are shuttled back and forth along the channel, sweeping over microarray probes while re-circulation mixing occurs <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>plugs.</b> Integrating <b>the</b> microarrays into the micro-fluidic channel reduces the DNA–DNA hybridization time from 18 h to 500 s. Additionally, the enhancement of DNA hybridization reaction by the microfluidic device is investigated by determining the coefficient of variation (CV), the growth rate of the hybridization signal and the ability to discriminate single-base mismatch. Detection limit of 19 amol was obtained for shuttle hybridization. A 1 ml target was used to hybridize with an array that can hold 5000 probes...|$|R
25|$|The trapper who has {{located a}} cricket must catch and contain the insect without causing it any injuries. Present-day trappers use zhao, a soft {{catching}} net {{on a wire}} frame, to contain the cricket on the ground. The captured crickets are then placed into a clay pot and stay there until being sold; they are fed a few boiled rice grains per day. Earlier, the Chinese used cage-like traps made of bamboo or ivory rods. Pavel Piassetsky, who visited Beijing in the 1880s, described a different technique. The Beijing people used two kind of tools: a bell-like bowl {{with a hole in}} its bottom, and a tube several inches long. When a cricket was forced to leave its hideout, the trapper would quickly cover it with the bell. When the trapped cricket emerged from the hole, the trapper would present the tube, and the cricket would eagerly hide <b>inside</b> it. <b>The</b> <b>plugged</b> tube then became a convenient cricket cage.|$|R

50|$|Dieseling is {{so named}} because it is similar in effect to how diesel engines operate: by firing without a spark. The {{ignition}} source of a diesel engine is the heat generated by the compression of {{the air in the}} cylinder, rather than a spark as in gasoline engines. The dieseling phenomenon occurs not just because the compression ratio is sufficient to cause auto-ignition of the fuel, but also because a hot spot <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> cylinder (spark <b>plug</b> electrode, combustion-chamber/valve edge or even excess carbon) starts combustion. An automobile engine that is dieseling will typically sputter, then gradually stop. This is normally seen in carbureted engines with many miles on them.|$|R
40|$|The femoral or cloacal {{region of}} {{many species of}} lizards and amphisbaenians {{exhibits}} epidermal glands. the pores of these glands are plugged with holocrine solid secretions that serve as semiochemical sources.

30|$|According to the coupled finite-infinite element {{modelling}} of sleeve penetration by vibratory hammers, <b>the</b> soil <b>plugging</b> effect during <b>the</b> penetration was investigated. The main conclusions were as followings: (1) During vibratory sleeve driving, {{the soil}} strength and cohesion decrease, which is induced by cyclic shearing action. As a result, soil plug is partially-plugged, and the penetration resistance {{is less than}} those by other installation methods; (2) In the vibratory penetration process, annular soil arches form <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> soil <b>plug,</b> which induces an obvious increase in internal shaft resistance. The soils within the active height of <b>the</b> soil <b>plug</b> undertake <b>the</b> {{major part of the}} internal shaft resistance; (3) A threshold value exists in the influence of the vibration frequency on internal shaft resistance. When the vibration frequency is less than the threshold value, internal shaft resistance decreases with the increase in vibratory frequency, which correspondingly reduces the degree of soil <b>plug.</b> When <b>the</b> vibration frequency reaches the threshold value, the influence of vibration frequency on internal shaft resistance can be ignored. Hence, the vibration frequency has little influence on the degree of soil plug; (4) The internal shaft resistance of the sleeve end gradually decreases as the sleeve diameter increases, while the internal shaft resistance in {{the upper part of the}} sleeves increases as the sleeve diameter increases. Moreover, the increase in sleeve diameter gradually decreases the degree of <b>the</b> soil <b>plug.</b> <b>The</b> internal shaft resistance depends closely on the soil layer properties as well; (5) During penetration of the sleeve, the distribution of soil <b>plug</b> resistance along <b>the</b> height of soil plug can be described by index curve. Soil plug resistance is mainly undertaken by the soils within the active height of soil <b>plug.</b> At <b>the</b> same time, the analytic expression of soil plug resistance during vibratory driving was given under the conditions of f ≥  25  Hz and 3.2 D < H <  15.5 D.|$|R

40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} numerical {{study of}} Taylor bubble flow in a microchannel (diameter 0. 2 mm) having an obstacle is carried out. A square shaped obstacle, of side 0. 02 mm is placed <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> microchannel. Taylor bubble flow is created using T-junction. Water and air enters through two inlets and form Taylor bubble at the T-junction. The obstacle is placed at an appropriate {{distance from the}} T-junction, where the water and gas fluids are getting mixed, along the downstream such that the stabilized Taylor bubble will touch the obstacle. This shows that the obstacle will be touched by the Taylor bubble which is already in steady motion. The obstacle position is varied along the perpendicular to the direction of fluid flow. Initially the obstacle is kept {{at the center of}} the microchannel i. e., it provides an equal space of 0. 9 mm on either of its sides <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> microchannel. As the Taylor bubble touches the obstacle it splits into two parts and moves through both sides of the obstacle with a perfect symmetric flow. The bubble joins again and gets to its original form as it passes through the obstacle. Then the obstacle is moved 0. 02 mm away from the center towards one side, i. e., it provides a gap of 0. 11 mm and 0. 07 mm on either side of the obstacle respectively. In this case as the Taylor bubble touches the obstacle it doesn’t split into two parts rather the whole bubble tries to move to the upper side of the obstacle i. e. maximum area side. Similar phenomenon is observed as the obstacle moves further away from the center line towards one side. The liquid-gas interface is continuously changing its shape due to the disturbance caused by the presence of the obstacle. This creates turbulence <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> liquid <b>plugs</b> present in between the two consecutive bubbles, which is shown by using the velocity vector fields.
