An analysis of organic matter and microscopy of the surface dust revealed that the dust contained high levels of organic matter, including living cyanobacteria. This suggests that the dust consists not only of deposit of wind-blown desert sand, but is also a product of microbial activity on the glacier. Measurements of surface albedo showed that the mean surface albedo in the ice area was smaller than that of the clean bare ice surface, suggesting that the albedo was significantly reduced by the surface dust. Large amounts of surface dust may be due to abundant windblown deposits of desert sand and high biological productivity on the glacial surface, probably a common characteristic of Asian glaciers...|$|E

40|$|The {{transfers}} of momentum and mass {{from the atmosphere}} to rough surfaces are fundamental scientific problems for meteorology, environment and industry. The transfer of momentum is crucial for the transfer of mass, heat, etc., in the boundary layer. The mass transfer, e. g., <b>dust</b> <b>dry</b> deposition, is a key process of the dust cycle. Both processes are closely related, but not well understood, particularly on rough surfaces or in unsteady conditions. Momentum and mass flux {{have been found to}} be associated with the geometric dimensions of the wake behind roughness elements. The dimensions of these wakes can be determined by the geometry of the obstacles on rough surfaces and wind speed. The objective of this thesis is to improve the theories of momentum transfer and drag partition between roughness elements and the exposed underlying surface, as well as the parameterization of particle deposition by means of numerical simulations of the air flow and dust flux over rough surfaces. To investigate the transfer of momentum and mass to rough surfaces, both two-dimensional Reynold Stress Model (2 D RSM) simulations and three-dimensional Large Eddy Simulations (3 D LES) are carried out. A rough surface in the simulation refers to a flat surface with regularly distributed identical roughness elements. The wind profile, surface drag, and the geometric dimensions of the wake are determined from the simulation results. Friction velocity (u*) and a friction coefficient (u*/uh) are estimated as functions of roughness density (λ), threshold roughness density (λa), and wind speed (ur). The dimensions of the wake, which influence the drag and are controlled by wind speed, are subject to the roughness density and the dimensions of the elements. Hence, it is important to repeat the numerical experiments for various element heights (h), roughness densities and wind speeds. To study <b>dust</b> <b>dry</b> deposition, particle injections are included in the 3 D simulation. It allows for particle tracking in the turbulent flow; thereby, the deposition velocity can be determined under different wind speeds, particle diameters and roughness densities. The 2 D simulation consists of 260 runs on 13 distinctive surfaces (1 / 30 < λ < 2 / 3, h = 5, 7. 5 and 10 mm) at 20 different wind speeds (1 - 20 ms- 1). The purpose of the 2 D simulation is to analyze the geometric dimensions of the wake in the absence of spanwise disturbance. 2 D simulations limit the possible mutual sheltering of elements in the streamwise direction. Without these disturbances, the length of the wake behind isolated element is presented as a function of wind speed. The height-to-length ratio of the wake (λw = hw/Lw) is analyzed and found to be independent of element height. When the wake is a full wake, λw is also independent from wind speed, and λw = λa. The relation among the dimensions of roughness elements, the wake and the drag are estimated. A physical model of drag and drag partition is proposed, based on a resistance method. The drag and drag partitions are expressed as functions of λ, and λa, without empirical parameters. The estimation of the new model are analyzed and compared to classical experimental results and a 3 D simulations results. The 3 D simulation for air flow over rough surface are conducted for 11 distinctive surfaces (1 / 30 < λ < 1 / 2) with identical elements of 10 mm height, at 6 different wind speeds (1 - 25 ms- 1). In the resistance method for the momentum flux, the resistances of the element (Rr), and the underlying surface (Rs) in the canyon layer are respectively determined. The threshold roughness density (λa) is introduced in the expressions of resistances. This threshold is defined as the roughness density of the surface which has equal momentum flux on the element and on the underlying surface. This threshold can be determined by the length of the wake (Lw) on rough surfaces and helps to distinguish elements of different length-to-height ratios (b/h). New expressions of friction velocity and drag partitions (τr + τs) are derived without any empirical parameter. The friction coefficient is determined empirically. Classical wind tunnel data of drag for rough surfaces with various roughness densities, and results from the 3 D simulation are successfully reproduced, and in response to different length-to-height ratios of roughness elements. Thus, the new expressions of drag and drag partition on rough surfaces are validated. The discrepancy between the estimation of existing dry deposition model and field measurements reaches 2 orders of magnitude. In the existing models of <b>dust</b> <b>dry</b> deposition, the rough surfaces are treated as a single cylinder. Sensitivity tests show that the possible uncertainty on the deposition velocity generated by this method can reach 337...|$|E
40|$|Saharan dust {{represents}} {{more than}} 50 % of total desertic aerosols emitted around the globe. The advection of desertic aerosols by air mass flux from West Africa to the Atlantic enriches {{the surface of the}} ocean in nutrients through atmospheric deposition. It has been shown that dust deposition is seasonal and in opposite phase between the eastern and the western Tropical Atlantic. This seasonality is driven by processes distributing the aerosol through the atmosphere over the continent and by other processes involved in the atmosphere-land-sea interactions. We used the LMD General Circulation Model in a West Africa regional configuration to investigate the processes at work in the fate of dusts. We quantify the atmospheric <b>dust</b> <b>dry</b> and wet deposition respectively in winter and boreal summer for the year 2006. In these estimates, we use simulations with aerosols scavenged by convection or convective features and large-scale precipitations. In the region between 35 °W- 18 °W (longitude) and 0 °N- 25 °N (latitude), we find that 2694 µg. m- 2. mth- 1 are deposited by dry process and 157 µg. m- 2. mth- 1 are washout in the atmosphere, representing respectively 95 % and 5 % of the total dust deposition in January. In July, the wet deposition increases up to 58 % (1719 µg. m- 2. mth- 1) while dry deposition reaches only 42 % (1261 µg. m- 2. mth- 1).

40|$|Aeolian dust was {{collected}} from 2001 to 2003, {{as part of}} a longer-term study, to estimate the nutrient input to the Levantine basin from atmospheric deposition. Adsorption experiments, using dust samples from six individual dust storms, showed insignificant adsorption of phosphate onto dry deposited Saharan dust. Thus adsorption onto dust can be discounted as a reason for the high nitrogen:phosphorus (N:P) ratio in the deep water of the eastern basin. A single dust storm sample from the Western Mediterranean was able to adsorb some phosphate from seawater, and it is speculated that this may be linked to the action of acid aerosols on the dust during cloud formation, or to the varying chemical composition in different sources of <b>dust.</b> <b>Dry</b> atmospheric deposition is an important net supplier of both N and P to the eastern basin. Leachable inorganic nitrogen concentrations and fluxes are higher in background (non-storm) samples than in storm samples, probably due to the smaller grain size and aerosol source. Total P is supplied naturally with the dust, as shown by the close correlation between total P and Al (r 2 = 0. 95). However, there is a poor correlation between leachable inorganic P (LIP) and Al (r 2 = 0. 20), which may be related to grain-size effects and/or recycling processes in the atmosphere. Even so, the supply of LIP to surface waters is greatest during dust storms due to comparatively high deposition of aerosol material. While atmospheric input of P during dust storms does not produce significant in situ increases in chlorophyll, probably due to rapid microbial grazing, it does represent an important proportion of the long-term nutrient input to the basin. This may be increasing as the frequency of dust storms increases. ...|$|E

40|$|Mining {{activities}} generate aerosol in a {{wide range}} of sizes. Smelting activities produce mainly fine particles (1 μm). The adverse effects of aerosols on human health depend mainly on two key characteristics: size and chemical composition. One of the main objectives of this research is to analyze the size distribution of contaminants in aerosol produced by mining operations. For this purpose, a Micro-Orifice Uniform Deposit Impactor (MOUDI) was utilized. Results from the MOUDI samples show higher concentrations of the toxic elements like lead and arsenic in the fine fraction (< 1 μm). Fine particles are more likely to be deposited in the deeper zones of the respiratory system; therefore, they are more dangerous than coarse particles that can be filtered out in the upper respiratory system. Unfortunately, knowing the total concentration of contaminants does not give us enough information to identify the source of contamination. For this reason, lead isotopes have been introduced as fingerprints for source apportionment. Each source of lead has specific isotopic ratios; by knowing these ratios sources can be identified. During this research, lead isotopic ratios were analyzed at different sites and for different aerosol sizes. From these analyses it can be concluded that lead isotopes are a powerful tool to identify sources of lead. Mitigation strategies could be developed if the source of contamination is well defined. Environmental conditions as wind speed, wind direction, relative humidity and precipitation have an important role in the concentration of atmospheric <b>dust.</b> <b>Dry</b> environments with low relative humidity are ideal for the transport of aerosols.

The lack of understanding for the mechanisms of dust deposition has been a major bottle neck {{to the development of the}} dust-related research field. The focus of this study is to obtain data for <b>dust</b> <b>dry</b> deposition, to validate the existing dust deposition schemes and to improve the parameterization for dust deposition processes. A series of dust deposition experiments are carried out in a wind-tunnel laboratory. A laser-based PDPA (Phase Doppler Particle Analyzer) technique is employed to measure the velocity and size of the dust particles which pass through the sampling area. Dust concentration is measured using an Aerosol Spectrometer and wind and turbulence are measured using a sonic anemometer and other conventional wind-tunnel instruments. A new method for processing the data is proposed. The PDPA data are used to derive the dust deposition velocity for different particle sizes and wind and surface conditions. A reliable dataset is obtained through the wind-tunnel experiments, which are then used to validate two representative dust deposition schemes, the Slinn and Slinn (1980) scheme for smooth surfaces and the Slinn (1982) scheme for vegetation canopies. It is found that the schemes tend to underestimate dust deposition velocity, especially for rough surfaces. The effect of interception is seriously underestimated in the schemes. A new dust deposition scheme is proposed in this study. The relationship between dust deposition and momentum depletion is established. The drag partition theory including the surface parameterization method is introduced to describe dust deposition. The improved scheme is suitable for both rough and smooth surfaces. The predictions of the new scheme are found to agree well with the experimental data. By sensitivity analysis, it is found that the newly introduced surface parameter, element frontal area index, has a predominant effect on surface collection efficiency and influences the deposition of particles of all sizes. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{wastewater}} from dyes {{and their}} intermediate manufacturing industry causes serious impact on natural water bodies and land surfaces {{in the surrounding}} area. The dye wastewater is treated by using many effective physical, chemical or biological techniques in the world. High values of COD and BOD, presence of particulate matter and sediments that give intense color intensity and turbidity in the effluents are some factors leading into the depletion of DO. There are five dyeing cottage industries in operation at Maruthamunai and above mentioned problems are noticed to be occurring in that area. In this part of study, we used different materials with the objective to select some efficient ones to control the COD and the colour intensity of the wastewater by adsorption {{from one of those}} dyeing industries. Dye wastewater parameters, such as pH, EC, colour intensity, and COD were analysed by using HACH multi-parameter, pH and conductivity meter, spectrophotometer (HACH, DR 2010) and titrimetric methods, respectively before and after the treatments with the different materials. Oxidizing properties of H 2 O 2 and adsorption properties of charcoal were used for treating dye wastewater in our work, in addition to different materials such as coal (from fire wood) paddy husk, saw <b>dust,</b> <b>dry</b> peel of ariconut, nirmali (S. potatorum) seeds, etc used. These results indicated that H 2 O 2 oxidizes both organic and inorganic pollutants which contribute to COD. Adsorption was an effective process for decolourization of textile dyes. Although different materials were tried, activated carbon was the most effective adsorbent due to its high surface area. Using these two substances H 2 O 2 and activated C, we were able to reduce the COD (60. 2 %. and 9. 5 %, respectively), pH (3. 61 %, and 2. 61 % respectively), EC (22. 2 %, and 5. 3 % respectively) and colour (88. 33 %, and 82. 58 % respectively) of dye wastewater. The results showed that the adsorption process using activated carbon insured a good degree of color reduction and chemical oxidation using H 2 O 2 as oxidant allows the effective control of organic load, offensive odor and foaminess in domestic wastewater...|$|E
40|$|Different {{modes of}} {{hydrogel}} application were tested on yield and yield components in production of early cabbage on chernozem soil at Rimski Šančevi. Also, {{its effect on}} soil chemical properties, soil water-physical features and soil microbiological activity were observed. There were four variants in this trial: control - without hydrogel, gel - swelled hydrogel incorporated into planting holes, <b>dust</b> - <b>dry</b> hydrogel <b>dust</b> incorporated into planting holes, <b>dust</b> - <b>dry</b> hydrogel <b>dust</b> scattered on soil surface in bands and incorporated. As for the observed features (whole plant weight, head diameter and cabbage yield) statistically {{significant differences were found}} between gel and other variants. The highest yield was with gel (55. 85 t ha- 1) and lowest with bands (39. 78 t ha- 1). Cabbage yield in gel variant is higher than in control by 18. 98 %. Yield was insignificantly decreased (1. 02 %) in dust variant incorporated into planting holes as compared to control. Application of hydrogel did not significantly impact soil properties nor distribution of tested groups of microorganisms and activity of dehydrogenase enzymes. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{new system}} for {{sanitizing}} floors in hospital patient rooms has been developed. The method consists of <b>dry</b> <b>dusting</b> with a cotton-blend, chemically treated (10 % by <b>dry</b> mop weight) <b>dust</b> mop. This method was {{compared with a}} conventional cleaning protocol consisting of an initial predusting with the same nongermicidal chemical (3 % by dry mop weight) followed by wet mopping with a fresh solution of a quaternary ammonium disinfectant-detergent. Each of six rooms was sampled by using RODAC plates (Becton Dickinson Labware, Oxnard, Calif.) on 10 consecutive days {{for each of the}} two methods. The study was initially performed during the summer and then repeated during the winter. Results imply that there is {{no significant difference between the}} new dry method (81. 9 % CFU reduction) and the conventional method (83. 1 % CFU reduction). Furthermore, the initial <b>dry</b> <b>dusting</b> step in the conventional method accounted for virtually all of the reduction by that method. Thus, wet mopping with a germicidal chemical produced no additional significant reduction of natural microbial populations on environmental surfaces beyond that achieved by <b>dry</b> <b>dusting</b> with dust-suppressant chemicals...|$|R
50|$|As the latex dries {{it becomes}} very sticky and will stick to itself if accidentally folded over. Most {{manufacturers}} offer a slick spray for latex once it is dry {{to take away the}} stickiness allowing the movement of the model's limbs. Alternatively, shimmer powders can be <b>dusted</b> over <b>dried</b> liquid latex to create metallic effects. One advantage to the tackiness of liquid latex is that it can act as an adhesive to attach things to the paint, such as zippers.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{increased}} risk of asthma symptoms has previously been shown in 772 pine sawmill workers. The aim {{of the current study}} was to assess the association between dust exposure, lung function and atopy. Subjects with (n 559) and without (n 5167) asthma symptoms were randomly selected from the previous survey. Lung function and atopy were determined using spirometry and skin-prick tests, respectively. Inhalable dust levels were measured on the same day. The geometric mean dust concentration was 0. 52 mg?m- 3. Exposure to dry but not to green dust was associated with asthma symptoms. Green dust was associated with atopic sensitisation, particularly against outdoor allergens; no association was found for <b>dry</b> <b>dust.</b> Forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in one second and peak expiratory flow were significantly lower in workers exposed to high levels of green dust (- 350 mL,- 260 mL and- 860 mL?s- 1, respectively) and <b>dry</b> <b>dust</b> (- 230 mL,- 190 mL and- 850 mL?s- 1, respectively). These associations were observed both in subjects with and without asthma symptoms. No associations with cross-shift changes in lung function were found. Exposure to green pine sawdust may be a risk factor for atopy. Both green and <b>dry</b> <b>dust</b> were associated with obstructive as well as restrictive pulmonary effects...|$|R
50|$|The plant grows {{mainly in}} salt flats (Arabic: sabkha) in hard soil surfaces, {{and can also}} be found growing along {{riverine}} gulches (Arabic: wadi) and in drainage runnels that have alkaline and saline soils, subsequently accumulating in its leaves a high quantity of sodium and chloride (chlorine ions). It thrives in silty soil which is very slippery and muddy when wet, but becomes baked hard with a flaking surface which breaks up into a fine <b>dust</b> when <b>dry,</b> and can especially be seen growing on hummocks in such terrain.|$|R
