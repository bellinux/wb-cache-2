5|$|In {{order to}} make the show seem more realistic, Franks and other writers talked to his father, a former Los Angeles police officer, and several psychics. Much of the episode's content was improvised by the actors, and Roday {{included}} a pineapple in the episode, continuing the reoccurring theme on the show. James Roday talked to producers about including singing in the series' second episode, but the idea was shut down because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>soon</b> in the show. In addition, Steve Franks considered writing one of the show's early episodes to be about a psychic claiming Shawn was a fraud, but delayed writing the episode until later. The producers attempted to include themes against smoking and the issues of friendship. Franks also included a character named Mrs. Foote, a reference to his 1999 movie Big Daddy.|$|E
5|$|The predominate storyline {{heading into}} the event was the rivalry between A.J. Styles and Kurt Angle, both members of The Angle Alliance group. On the February14 episode of Impact!, TNA held the scripted wedding of Angle's real-life wife Karen Angle and Styles despite Angle and Karen still being married on-screen. Afterwards, Karen and Angle {{separated}} in the storyline on the March13 episode of Impact!. TNA continued to build the situation with Angle attempting to reconcile with Karen on the May15 episode of Impact!. Karen refused Angle's request on the May22 episode of Impact!, leading to Angle turning on and assaulting Styles later in the episode due to his jealousy of the affection Karen showed for Styles. On the May29 episode of Impact!, Cornette announced Angle versus Styles for the event. Angle sustained a severe neck injury in early May with several TNA officials believing Angle would not recover in time to perform at the show. Angle was still in pain a few days prior to Slammiversary but was expected to perform normally despite some officials feeling <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>soon</b> to compete.|$|E

25|$|In {{the morning}} session of 6 July, Israeli {{witnesses}} and representatives testified {{in front of}} the committee, describing years of living under rocket attack. The last to take the floor during the session was Noam Shalit, father of the Israeli captive soldier Gilad Shalit who at that time had been imprisoned in Gaza for three years, with no visit by the Red Cross permitted. Later that day, pro-Palestinian witnesses and experts from Israel and the West Bank testified. The next day, a military expert testified on weapons use by Hamas and Israel and an international law expert testified at Goldstone's Gaza hearings. Following the two-day session, Goldstone said that the investigation entered its final phase, but that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>soon</b> to conclude that war crimes were committed.|$|E
25|$|The other {{officers}} in Danyang {{were well aware}} that Gai Lan and Dai Yuan were the masterminds behind Sun Yi's murder but were unable {{to take action against}} the two men because their powers were limited. Gai Lan took over Sun Yi's residence and seized Sun's concubines and servants for himself. When he wanted to take Lady Xu (Sun Yi's widow), she declined, said that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>soon</b> after her husband's death to remarry, and told him to wait for a month. During the intervening period, Lady Xu secretly contacted Sun Gao (孫高), Fu Ying (傅嬰) and other former subordinates of Sun Yi, informed them of the circumstances, and plotted with them to avenge her husband. On the appointed day, Lady Xu changed out of her mourning garments and invited Gai Lan to her personal quarters, where Sun Gao and Fu Ying, in disguise as maids, ambushed and killed Gai while the others slew Dai Yuan. Gai Lan and Dai Yuan's heads were cut off and offered as propitiation at Sun Yi's altar. This incident shocked everyone in Danyang. Shortly thereafter, Sun Quan came to Danyang to reward those who remained loyal to Sun Yi and punish those who conspired with Gai Lan and Dai Yuan.|$|E

Regarding Darren being the father of twin babies and if his relationship with Nancy would survive, Dawson felt the situation was too difficult for Nancy but for Darren it was fine. He felt that the story was [...] "interesting" [...] and hoped the pairing would survive as they have [...] "something special". Darren and Nancy split up when he moves Suzanne and the babies into Nancy's flat. They resume their romance after Suzanne leaves and takes the children with her.|$|E

500|$|Jim Farber of the New York-based Daily News {{wrote in}} his review: [...] "It suffers from a {{similarly}} meandering melody and ponderous progression.

And, fifty years down the line, isn't that all we really expect from a Bond product these days?" [...] Yahoo!'s Rob O'Connor gave the standalone song a positive review, but felt that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>soon</b> to tell how the song would fit into the wider canon of Bond theme songs. Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph was less complimentary, describing the song as [...] "classy", {{but at the same}} time, [...] "overly predictable".|$|E
500|$|Cast {{members have}} commented on their {{performances}} in the episode. Robert Beltran, who played Commander Chakotay, said he felt uncomfortable acting in the facial mask worn for his character's Vidiian disguise. He described the prosthetics as [...] "that raw, wounded face, which made me feel very vulnerable as a person", and viewed it as an acting challenge. Garrett Wang, who portrayed Ensign Harry Kim, said that {{his role in the}} episode was restricted to technobabble. Robert Picardo, who played the Doctor, appreciated the interactions between Torres and his character as they represented how he was originally [...] "just a functionary doing his job." [...] Picardo added that his scenes showed that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>soon</b> for his character to understand the importance of his operation on Torres, or to develop any sort of relationship with her.|$|E
500|$|Critics also commented {{positively}} on {{the development}} of Will and Emma's relationship, with Abrams noting that she had been waiting for them to kiss since the pilot episode, and Goldman deeming their coming together [...] "very hard to not feel good about".

The end of Quinn's pregnancy secret was also well received. Poniewozik wrote that the pregnancy storyline had felt as though [...] "the early Glee wasn't confident that people would be interested in it without these over-the-top soap opera twists." [...] He noted that in concluding the pregnancy deception in [...] "Sectionals", Glee: [...] "seemed to clear the decks for a second half of the season as the confident show it now is." ...|$|E

500|$|Development of Sonic 2 {{began in}} November 1991, {{two months later}} than Cerny had {{intended}} because Sega of America initially felt <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>soon</b> for a sequel. Both American and Japanese Sonic Team staff contributed to development; art director Tim Skelly designed {{the appearance of the}} game's pseudo-3D special stages, based on a tech demo created by Naka. The special stages were created out of pre-rendered 3D polygons, video of which was compressed and halved, both vertically and horizontally, to fit in the game cartridge. Sonic 2 also introduced Sonic's sidekick, a two-tailed fox that could fly named Tails, inspired by Japanese folklore about the kitsune and created by level artist Yasushi Yamaguchi. Sega of America objected to the character's name, Miles Prower (a pun on [...] "miles per hour"), so he was given the nickname Tails as a compromise. Masaharu Yoshii served as the game's director. The staff increased the speed of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 compared to the first game.|$|E
500|$|In 1954, Thatcher was {{defeated}} when she sought selection {{to be the}} Conservative party candidate for the Orpington by-election of January 1955. She chose not to stand as a candidate in the 1955 general election, in later years stating: [...] "I really just felt the twins were... only two, I really felt that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>soon.</b> I couldn't do that." [...] Afterwards, Thatcher began looking for a Conservative safe seat and {{was selected as the}} candidate for Finchley in April 1958 (narrowly beating Ian Montagu Fraser). She was elected as MP for the seat after a hard campaign in the 1959 election. Benefiting from her fortunate result in a lottery for backbenchers to propose new legislation, Thatcher's maiden speech was, unusually, in support of her private member's bill (the Public Bodies (Admission to Meetings) Act 1960), requiring local authorities to hold their council meetings in public; the bill was successful and became law. In 1961 she went against the Conservative Party's official position by voting for the restoration of birching as a judicial corporal punishment.|$|E
500|$|Critics were {{complimentary}} {{towards the}} episode, praising the acting talent of January Jones and the ensemble cast {{as well as}} Jon Hamm's debut in the director's chair. Some, however, were not as impressed by the fat suit techniques used on January Jones to both hide her pregnancy and convey the character's weight gain. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+. He felt {{that some of the}} scenes were too on-the-nose and that some of the symbolism was a little overt. VanDerWerff specifically cited the scenes where Don talks with the young girl at the concert as on-the-nose, comparing Don in this scene to Joe Friday. He did, however, praise the subplot involving Betty's weight gain as well as the final scene. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix said that all of the stories were linked by the threat of replacement and liked the interaction between Roger and Peggy, which he felt was a rare occurrence. He said that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>soon</b> to judge the Ginsberg character and that the Betty storyline was the weakest of the main plots. Writer Myles McNutt found January Jones [...] "highly compelling" [...] and the storyline offering a [...] "decidedly human turn for the character, with her lunch with Joyce offering insight that we are robbed of without Betty having any friends to confide in normally." ...|$|E

500|$|Critics commented {{positively}} on {{the development}} of Will and Emma's relationship; TV Guide Natalie Abrams wrote that she had been waiting for them to kiss since the pilot episode. Flandez felt that the kiss made the [...] "poignant moment" [...] of the glee club's final performance [...] "even more dear", and hoped {{that it would not be}} the last between them, while Aly Semigran of MTV praised the development and called the kiss [...] "sweet [...] longing". Goldman wrote: [...] "Schue and Emma finally coming together was very hard to not feel good about, even though you know it just won't be that easy when the show returns". Gerrick Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times opined that it was clear Ken and Emma would not marry, and added that when Will kissed Emma: [...] "I died". In discussing Will and Emma's conversation about how she would have left Ken if Will had shown any interest in her, Pardue commented: [...] "That's maybe the sweetest and the saddest thing I've ever heard." [...] She called the kiss between Will and Emma [...] "romantic" [...] commenting that it made her [...] "heart happy". Entertainment Weekly Dan Snierson commented that although there was satisfaction in the episode ending on the kiss, it may have been [...] "more intriguing" [...] to conclude with Will finding Emma's office empty, or [...] "before she smiled approvingly after their kiss", questioning whether <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>soon</b> for the two of them to begin a relationship, or [...] "about freakin' time".|$|E
500|$|Emma's {{relationship}} with glee club coach Will Schuester {{is an integral}} part of her character. They have had an on and off relationship since the show's first season. Television critics have responded extremely well to the pairing between the two. Mandi Bierly for Entertainment Weekly said of the episode [...] "Vitamin D": [...] "Matthew Morrison communicates so much with his eyes. There’s a softness and a longing in them that I’m always surprised Emma (Jayma Mays) matches." [...] Critics also commented positively on the development of Will and Emma's relationship in the episode Sectionals. Natalie Abrams of TV Guide noted that she had been waiting for them to kiss since the pilot episode, and Eric Goldman of IGN has deemed their coming together [...] "very hard to not feel good about". Dan Snierson, however, wrote that although there was satisfaction in the episode ending on the kiss, it may have been [...] "more intriguing" [...] to conclude when Will finds Emma's empty office, and having him then question whether <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>soon</b> for the two of them to begin a relationship. Eric Goldman of IGN commented of the following episode: [...] " [...] I would have liked to at least see Shue and Emma as a couple for a few episodes, rather than such a quick split. It felt rushed." [...] Todd VanDerWerff added: [...] "I loved Emma's eruption to Will about how Sue Sylvester must have cheated and the kids deserved to win." [...] Robert Canning said of the Britney Spears oriented episode: [...] "The true focus of the episode was Will dealing with his lack of spontaneity. This stood as a contrast to the impulsiveness of Emma's new boyfriend, sexy dentist Carl played by the somehow always charming John Stamos. There's a fun love triangle building here which should only get better as Will becomes less of an insecure whiner." ...|$|E
