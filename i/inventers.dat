Yet least they faint [...] At the sad Sentence rigorously urg'd, [...] For I behold them soft'nd and with tears [...] 110 [...] Bewailing thir excess, all terror hide. [...] If patiently thy bidding they obey, [...] Dismiss them not disconsolate; reveale [...] To Adam what shall come in future dayes, [...] As I shall thee enlighten, intermix [...] My Cov'nant in the Womans seed renewd; [...] So send them forth, though sorrowing, yet in peace: [...] And on the East side of the Garden place, [...] Where entrance up from Eden easiest climbes, [...] Cherubic watch, and of a Sword the flame [...] 120 [...] Wide waving, all approach farr off to fright, [...] And guard all passage to the Tree of Life: [...] Least Paradise a receptacle prove [...] To Spirits foule, and all my Trees thir prey, [...] With whose stol'n Fruit Man once more to delude.

For since I saught [...] By Prayer th' offended Deitie to appease, [...] Kneel'd and before him humbl'd all my heart, [...] 150 [...] Methought I saw him placable and mild, [...] Bending his eare; perswasion in me grew [...] That I was heard with favour; peace returnd [...] Home to my brest, and to my memorie [...] His promise, that thy Seed shall bruise our Foe; [...] Which then not minded in dismay, yet now [...] Assures me that the bitterness of death [...] Is past, and we shall live. Whence Haile to thee, [...] Eve rightly call'd, Mother of all Mankind, [...] Mother of all things living, since by thee [...] 160 [...] Man is to live, and all things live for Man. [...] To whom thus Eve with sad demeanour meek. [...] Ill worthie I such title should belong [...] To me transgressour, who for thee ordaind [...] A help, became thy snare; to mee reproach [...] Rather belongs, distrust and all dispraise: [...] But infinite in pardon was my Judge, [...] That I who first brought Death on all, am grac't [...] The sourse of life; next favourable thou, [...] Who highly thus to entitle me voutsaf't, [...] 170 [...] Farr other name deserving. But the Field [...] To labour calls us now with sweat impos'd, [...] Though after sleepless Night; for see the Morn, [...] All unconcern'd with our unrest, begins [...] Her rosie progress smiling; let us forth, [...] I never from thy side henceforth to stray, [...] Wherere our days work lies, though now enjoind [...] Laborious, till day droop; while here we dwell, [...] What can be toilsom in these pleasant Walkes? [...] Here let us live, though in fall'n state, content. [...] 180 [...] So spake, so wish'd much-humbl'd Eve, but Fate [...] Subscrib'd not; Nature first gave Signs, imprest [...] On Bird, Beast, Aire, Aire suddenly eclips'd [...] After short blush of Morn; nigh in her sight [...] The Bird of Jove, stoopt from his aerie tour, [...] Two Birds of gayest plume before him drove: [...] Down from a Hill the Beast that reigns in Woods, [...] First Hunter then, pursu'd a gentle brace, [...] Goodliest of all the Forrest, Hart and Hinde; [...] Direct to th' Eastern Gate was bent thir flight. [...] 190 [...] Adam observ'd, and with his Eye the chase [...] Pursuing, not unmov'd to Eve thus spake. [...] O Eve, some furder change awaits us nigh, [...] Which Heav'n by these mute signs in Nature shews [...] Forerunners of his purpose, or to warn [...] Us haply too secure of our discharge [...] From penaltie, because from death releast [...] Some days; how long, and what till then our life, [...] Who knows, or more then this, that we are dust, [...] And thither must return and be no more. [...] 200 [...] Why else this double object in our sight [...] Of flight pursu'd in th' Air and ore the ground [...] One way the self-same hour? why in the East [...] Darkness ere Dayes mid-course, and Morning light [...] More orient in yon Western Cloud that draws [...] O're the blew Firmament a radiant white, [...] And slow descends, with somthing heav'nly fraught. [...] He err'd not, for by this the heav'nly Bands [...] Down from a Skie of Jasper lighted now [...] In Paradise, and on a Hill made alt, [...] 210 [...] A glorious Apparition, had not doubt [...] And carnal fear that day dimm'd Adams eye. [...] Not that more glorious, when the Angels met [...] Jacob in Mahanaim, where he saw [...] The field Pavilion'd with his Guardians bright; [...] Nor that which on the flaming Mount appeerd [...] In Dothan, cover'd with a Camp of Fire, [...] Against the Syrian King, who to surprize [...] One man, Assassin-like had levied Warr, [...] Warr unproclam'd. The Princely Hierarch [...] 220 [...] In thir bright stand, there left his Powers to seise [...] Possession of the Garden; hee alone, [...] To finde where Adam shelterd, took his way, [...] Not unperceav'd of Adam, who to Eve, [...] While the great Visitant approachd, thus spake. [...] Eve, now expect great tidings, which perhaps [...] Of us will soon determin, or impose [...] New Laws to be observ'd; for I descrie [...] From yonder blazing Cloud that veils the Hill [...] One of the heav'nly Host, and by his Gate [...] 230 [...] None of the meanest, some great Potentate [...] Or of the Thrones above, such Majestie [...] Invests him coming; yet not terrible, [...] That I should fear, nor sociably mild, [...] As Raphael, that I should much confide, [...] But solemn and sublime, whom not to offend, [...] With reverence I must meet, and thou retire. [...] He ended; and th' Arch-Angel soon drew nigh, [...] Not in his shape Celestial, but as Man [...] Clad to meet Man; over his lucid Armes [...] 240 [...] A militarie Vest of purple flowd [...] Livelier then Meliboean, or the graine [...] Of Sarra, worn by Kings and Hero's old [...] In time of Truce; Iris had dipt the wooff; [...] His starrie Helme unbuckl'd shew'd him prime [...] In Manhood where Youth ended; by his side [...] As in a glistering Zodiac hung the Sword, [...] Satans dire dread, and in his hand the Spear. [...] Adam bowd low, hee Kingly from his State [...] Inclin'd not, but his coming thus declar'd. [...] 250 [...] Adam, Heav'ns high behest no Preface needs: [...] Sufficient that thy Prayers are heard, and Death, [...] Then due by sentence when thou didst transgress, [...] Defeated of his seisure many dayes [...] Giv'n thee of Grace, wherein thou may'st repent, [...] And one bad act with many deeds well done [...] Mayst cover: well may then thy Lord appeas'd [...] Redeem thee quite from Deaths rapacious claimes; [...] But longer in this Paradise to dwell [...] Permits not; to remove thee I am come, [...] 260 [...] And send thee from the Garden forth to till [...] The ground whence thou wast tak'n, fitter Soile. [...] He added not, for Adam at the newes [...] Heart-strook with chilling gripe of sorrow stood, [...] That all his senses bound; Eve, who unseen [...] Yet all had heard, with audible lament [...] Discover'd soon the place of her retire. [...] O unexpected stroke, worse then of Death! [...] Must I thus leave thee Paradise? thus leave [...] Thee Native Soile, these happie Walks and Shades, [...] 270 [...] Fit haunt of Gods? where I had hope to spend, [...] Quiet though sad, the respit of that day [...] That must be mortal to us both. O flours, [...] That never will in other Climate grow, [...] My early visitation, and my last [...] At Eev'n, which I bred up with tender hand [...] From the first op'ning bud, and gave ye Names, [...] Who now shall reare ye to the Sun, or ranke [...] Your Tribes, and water from th' ambrosial Fount? [...] Thee lastly nuptial Bowre, by mee adornd [...] 280 [...] With what to sight or smell was sweet; from thee [...] How shall I part, and whither wander down [...] Into a lower World, to this obscure [...] And wilde, how shall we breath in other Aire [...] Less pure, accustomd to immortal Fruits? [...] Whom thus the Angel interrupted milde. [...] Lament not Eve, but patiently resigne [...] What justly thou hast lost; nor set thy heart, [...] Thus over fond, on that which is not thine; [...] Thy going is not lonely, with thee goes [...] 290 [...] Thy Husband, him to follow thou art bound; [...] Where he abides, think there thy native soile. [...] Adam by this from the cold sudden damp [...] Recovering, and his scatterd spirits returnd, [...] To Michael thus his humble words addressd. [...] Celestial, whether among the Thrones, or nam'd [...] Of them the Highest, for such of shape may seem [...] Prince above Princes, gently hast thou tould [...] Thy message, which might else in telling wound, [...] And in performing end us; what besides [...] 300 [...] Of sorrow and dejection and despair [...] Our frailtie can sustain, thy tidings bring, [...] Departure from this happy place, our sweet [...] Recess, and onely consolation left [...] Familiar to our eyes, all places else [...] Inhospitable appeer and desolate, [...] Nor knowing us nor known: and if by prayer [...] Incessant I could hope to change the will [...] Of him who all things can, I would not cease [...] To wearie him with my assiduous cries: [...] 310 [...] But prayer against his absolute Decree [...] No more availes then breath against the winde, [...] Blown stifling back on him that breaths it forth: [...] Therefore to his great bidding I submit. [...] This most afflicts me, that departing hence, [...] As from his face I shall be hid, deprivd [...] His blessed count'nance; here I could frequent, [...] With worship, place by place where he voutsaf'd [...] Presence Divine, and to my Sons relate; [...] On this Mount he appeerd, under this Tree [...] 320 [...] Stood visible, among these Pines his voice [...] I heard, here with him at this Fountain talk'd: [...] So many grateful Altars I would reare [...] Of grassie Terfe, and pile up every Stone [...] Of lustre from the brook, in memorie, [...] Or monument to Ages, and thereon [...] Offer sweet smelling Gumms & Fruits and Flours: [...] In yonder nether World where shall I seek [...] His bright appearances, or footstep trace? [...] For though I fled him angrie, yet recall'd [...] 330 [...] To life prolongd and promisd Race, I now [...] Gladly behold though but his utmost skirts [...] Of glory, and farr off his steps adore. [...] To whom thus Michael with regard benigne. [...] Adam, thou know'st Heav'n his, and all the Earth [...] Not this Rock onely; his Omnipresence fills [...] Land, Sea, and Aire, and every kinde that lives, [...] Fomented by his virtual power and warmd: [...] All th' Earth he gave thee to possess and rule, [...] No despicable gift; surmise not then [...] 340 [...] His presence to these narrow bounds confin'd [...] Of Paradise or Eden: this had been [...] Perhaps thy Capital Seate, from whence had spred [...] All generations, and had hither come [...] From all the ends of th' Earth, to celebrate [...] And reverence thee thir great Progenitor. [...] But this praeeminence thou hast lost, brought down [...] To dwell on eeven ground now with thy Sons: [...] Yet doubt not but in Vallie and in Plaine [...] God is as here, and will be found alike [...] 350 [...] Present, and of his presence many a signe [...] Still following thee, still compassing thee round [...] With goodness and paternal Love, his Face [...] Express, and of his steps the track Divine. [...] Which that thou mayst beleeve, and be confirmd, [...] Ere thou from hence depart, know I am sent [...] To shew thee what shall come in future dayes [...] To thee and to thy Ofspring; good with bad [...] Expect to hear, supernal Grace contending [...] With sinfulness of Men; thereby to learn [...] 360 [...] True patience, and to temper joy with fear [...] And pious sorrow, equally enur'd [...] By moderation either state to beare, [...] Prosperous or adverse: so shalt thou lead [...] Safest thy life, and best prepar'd endure [...] Thy mortal passage when it comes. Ascend [...] This Hill; let Eve (for I have drencht her eyes) [...] Here sleep below while thou to foresight wak'st, [...] As once thou slepst, while Shee to life was formd. [...] To whom thus Adam gratefully repli'd. [...] 370 [...] Ascend, I follow thee, safe Guide, the path [...] Thou lead'st me, and to the hand of Heav'n submit, [...] However chast'ning, to the evil turne [...] My obvious breast, arming to overcom [...] By suffering, and earne rest from labour won, [...] If so I may attain. So both ascend [...] In the Visions of God: It was a Hill [...] Of Paradise the highest, from whose top [...] The Hemisphere of Earth in cleerest Ken [...] Stretcht out to amplest reach of prospect lay. [...] 380 [...] Not higher that Hill nor wider looking round, [...] Whereon for different cause the Tempter set [...] Our second Adam in the Wilderness, [...] To shew him all Earths Kingdomes and thir Glory. [...] His Eye might there command wherever stood [...] City of old or modern Fame, the Seat [...] Of mightiest Empire, from the destind Walls [...] Of Cambalu, seat of Cathaian Can [...] And Samarchand by Oxus, Temirs Throne, [...] To Paquin of Sinaean Kings, and thence [...] 390 [...] To Agra and Lahor of great Mogul [...] Down to the golden Chersonese, or where [...] The Persian in Ecbatan sate, or since [...] In Hispahan, or where the Russian Ksar [...] In Mosco, or the Sultan in Bizance, [...] Turchestan-born; nor could his eye not ken [...] Th' Empire of Negus to his utmost Port [...] Ercoco and the less Maritine Kings [...] Mombaza, and Quiloa, and Melind, [...] And Sofala thought Ophir, to the Realme [...] 400 [...] Of Congo, and Angola fardest South; [...] Or thence from Niger Flood to Atlas Mount [...] The Kingdoms of Almansor, Fez, and Sus, [...] Marocco and Algiers, and Tremisen; [...] On Europe thence, and where Rome was to sway [...] The World: in Spirit perhaps he also saw [...] Rich Mexico the seat of Motezume, [...] And Cusco in Peru, the richer seat [...] Of Atabalipa, and yet unspoil'd [...] Guiana, whose great Citie Geryons Sons [...] 410 [...] Call El Dorado: but to nobler sights [...] Michael from Adams eyes the Filme remov'd [...] Which that false Fruit that promis'd clearer sight [...] Had bred; then purg'd with Euphrasie and Rue [...] The visual Nerve, for he had much to see; [...] And from the Well of Life three drops instill'd. [...] So deep the power of these Ingredients pierc'd, [...] Eevn to the inmost seat of mental sight, [...] That Adam now enforc't to close his eyes, [...] Sunk down and all his Spirits became intranst: [...] 420 [...] But him the gentle Angel by the hand [...] Soon rais'd, and his attention thus recall'd. [...] Adam, now ope thine eyes, and first behold [...] Th' effects which thy original crime hath wrought [...] In some to spring from thee, who never touch'd [...] Th' excepted Tree, nor with the Snake conspir'd, [...] Nor sinn'd thy sin, yet from that sin derive [...] Corruption to bring forth more violent deeds. [...] His eyes he op'nd, and beheld a field, [...] Part arable and tilth, whereon were Sheaves [...] 430 [...] New reapt, the other part sheep-walks and foulds; [...] Ith' midst an Altar as the Land-mark stood [...] Rustic, of grassie sord; thither anon [...] A sweatie Reaper from his Tillage brought [...] First Fruits, the green Eare, and the yellow Sheaf, [...] Uncull'd, as came to hand; a Shepherd next [...] More meek came with the Firstlings of his Flock [...] Choicest and best; then sacrificing, laid [...] The Inwards and thir Fat, with Incense strew'd, [...] On the cleft Wood, and all due Rites perform'd. [...] 440 [...] His Offring soon propitious Fire from Heav'n [...] Consum'd with nimble glance, and grateful steame; [...] The others not, for his was not sincere; [...] Whereat hee inlie rag'd, and as they talk'd, [...] Smote him into the Midriff with a stone [...] That beat out life; he fell, and deadly pale [...] Groand out his Soul with gushing bloud effus'd. [...] Much at that sight was Adam in his heart [...] Dismai'd, and thus in haste to th' Angel cri'd. [...] O Teacher, some great mischief hath befall'n [...] 450 [...] To that meek man, who well had sacrific'd; [...] Is Pietie thus and pure Devotion paid? [...] T' whom Michael thus, hee also mov'd, repli'd. [...] These two are Brethren, Adam, and to come [...] Out of thy loyns; th' unjust the just hath slain, [...] For envie that his Brothers Offering found [...] From Heav'n acceptance; but the bloodie Fact [...] Will be aveng'd, and th' others Faith approv'd [...] Loose no reward, though here thou see him die, [...] Rowling in dust and gore. To which our Sire. [...] 460 [...] Alas, both for the deed and for the cause! [...] But have I now seen Death? Is this the way [...] I must return to native dust? O sight [...] Of terrour, foul and ugly to behold, [...] Horrid to think, how horrible to feel! [...] To whom thus Michael. Death thou hast seen [...] In his first shape on man; but many shapes [...] Of Death, and many are the wayes that lead [...] To his grim Cave, all dismal; yet to sense [...] More terrible at th' entrance then within. [...] 470 [...] Some, as thou saw'st, by violent stroke shall die, [...] By Fire, Flood, Famin, by Intemperance more [...] In Meats and Drinks, which on the Earth shal bring [...] Diseases dire, of which a monstrous crew [...] Before thee shall appear; that thou mayst know [...] What miserie th' inabstinence of Eve [...] Shall bring on men. Immediately a place [...] Before his eyes appeard, sad, noysom, dark, [...] A Lazar-house it seemd, wherein were laid [...] Numbers of all diseas'd, all maladies [...] 480 [...] Of gastly Spasm, or racking torture, qualmes [...] Of heart-sick Agonie, all feavorous kinds, [...] Convulsions, Epilepsies, fierce Catarrhs, [...] Intestin Stone and Ulcer, Colic pangs, [...] Dropsies, and Asthma's, and Joint-racking Rheums. [...] Dire was the tossing, deep the groans, despair [...] Tended the sick busiest from Couch to Couch; [...] And over them triumphant Death his Dart [...] Shook, but delaid to strike, though oft invok't [...] With vows, as thir chief good, and final hope. [...] 490 [...] Sight so deform what heart of Rock could long [...] Drie-ey'd behold? Adam could not, but wept, [...] Though not of Woman born; compassion quell'd [...] His best of Man, and gave him up to tears [...] A space, till firmer thoughts restraind excess, [...] And scarce recovering words his plaint renew'd. [...] O miserable Mankind, to what fall [...] Degraded, to what wretched state reserv'd? [...] Better end heer unborn. Why is life giv'n [...] To be thus wrested from us? rather why [...] 500 [...] Obtruded on us thus? who if we knew [...] What we receive, would either not accept [...] Life offer'd, or soon beg to lay it down, [...] Glad to be so dismist in peace. Can thus [...] Th' Image of God in man created once [...] So goodly and erect, though faultie since, [...] To such unsightly sufferings be debas't [...] Under inhuman pains? Why should not Man, [...] Retaining still Divine similitude [...] In part, from such deformities be free, [...] 510 [...] And for his Makers Image sake exempt? [...] Thir Makers Image, answerd Michael, then [...] Forsook them, when themselves they villifi'd [...] To serve ungovern'd appetite, and took [...] His Image whom they serv'd, a brutish vice, [...] Inductive mainly to the sin of Eve. [...] Therefore so abject is thir punishment, [...] Disfiguring not Gods likeness, but thir own, [...] Or if his likeness, by themselves defac't [...] While they pervert pure Natures healthful rules [...] 520 [...] To loathsom sickness, worthily, since they [...] Gods Image did not reverence in themselves. [...] I yeild it just, said Adam, and submit. [...] But is there yet no other way, besides [...] These painful passages, how we may come [...] To Death, and mix with our connatural dust? [...] There is, said Michael, if thou well observe [...] The rule of not too much, by temperance taught [...] In what thou eatst and drinkst, seeking from thence [...] Due nourishment, not gluttonous delight, [...] 530 [...] Till many years over thy head return: [...] So maist thou live, till like ripe Fruit thou drop [...] Into thy Mothers lap, or be with ease [...] Gatherd, not harshly pluckt, for death mature: [...] This is old age; but then thou must outlive [...] Thy youth, thy strength, thy beauty, which will change [...] To witherd weak & gray; thy Senses then [...] Obtuse, all taste of pleasure must forgoe, [...] To what thou hast, and for the Aire of youth [...] Hopeful and cheerful, in thy blood will reigne [...] 540 [...] A melancholly damp of cold and dry [...] To waigh thy spirits down, and last consume [...] The Balme of Life. To whom our Ancestor. [...] Henceforth I flie not Death, nor would prolong [...] Life much, bent rather how I may be quit [...] Fairest and easiest of this combrous charge, [...] Which I must keep till my appointed day [...] Of rendring up, Michael to him repli'd. [...] Nor love thy Life, nor hate; but what thou livst [...] Live well, how long or short permit to Heav'n: [...] 550 [...] And now prepare thee for another sight. [...] He lookd and saw a spacious Plaine, whereon [...] Were Tents of various hue; by some were herds [...] Of Cattel grazing: others, whence the sound [...] Of Instruments that made melodious chime [...] Was heard, of Harp and Organ; and who moovd [...] Thir stops and chords was seen: his volant touch [...] Instinct through all proportions low and high [...] Fled and pursu'd transverse the resonant fugue. [...] In other part stood one who at the Forge [...] 560 [...] Labouring, two massie clods of Iron and Brass [...] Had melted (whether found where casual fire [...] Had wasted woods on Mountain or in Vale, [...] Down to the veins of Earth, thence gliding hot [...] To som Caves mouth, or whether washt by stream [...] From underground) the liquid Ore he dreind [...] Into fit moulds prepar'd; from which he formd [...] First his own Tooles; then, what might else be wrought [...] Fulfil or grav'n in mettle. After these, [...] But on the hether side a different sort [...] 570 [...] From the high neighbouring Hills, which was thir Seat, [...] Down to the Plain descended: by thir guise [...] Just men they seemd, and all thir study bent [...] To worship God aright, and know his works [...] Not hid, nor those things lost which might preserve [...] Freedom and Peace to men: they on the Plain [...] Long had not walkt, when from the Tents behold [...] A Beavie of fair Women, richly gay [...] In Gems and wanton dress; to the Harp they sung [...] Soft amorous Ditties, and in dance came on: [...] 580 [...] The Men though grave, ey'd them, and let thir eyes [...] Rove without rein, till in the amorous Net [...] Fast caught, they lik'd, and each his liking chose; [...] And now of love they treat till th' Eevning Star [...] Loves Harbinger appeerd; then all in heat [...] They light the Nuptial Torch, and bid invoke [...] Hymen, then first to marriage Rites invok't; [...] With Feast and Musick all the Tents resound. [...] Such happy interview and fair event [...] Of love & youth not lost, Songs, Garlands, Flours, [...] 590 [...] And charming Symphonies attach'd the heart [...] Of Adam, soon enclin'd to admit delight, [...] The bent of Nature; which he thus express'd. [...] True opener of mine eyes, prime Angel blest, [...] Much better seems this Vision, and more hope [...] Of peaceful dayes portends, then those two past; [...] Those were of hate and death, or pain much worse, [...] Here Nature seems fulfilld in all her ends. [...] To whom thus Michael. Judg not what is best [...] By pleasure, though to Nature seeming meet, [...] 600 [...] Created, as thou art, to nobler end [...] Holie and pure, conformitie divine. [...] Those Tents thou sawst so pleasant, were the Tents [...] Of wickedness, wherein shall dwell his Race [...] Who slew his Brother; studious they appere [...] Of Arts that polish Life, <b>Inventers</b> rare, [...] Unmindful of thir Maker, though his Spirit [...] Taught them, but they his gifts acknowledg'd none. [...] Yet they a beauteous ofspring shall beget; [...] For that fair femal Troop thou sawst, that seemd [...] 610 [...] Of Goddesses, so blithe, so smooth, so gay, [...] Yet empty of all good wherein consists [...] Womans domestic honour and chief praise; [...] Bred onely and completed to the taste [...] Of lustful apperence, to sing, to dance, [...] To dress, and troule the Tongue, and roule the Eye. [...] To these that sober Race of Men, whose lives [...] Religious titl'd them the Sons of God, [...] Shall yeild up all thir vertue, all thir fame [...] Ignobly, to the trains and to the smiles [...] 620 [...] Of these fair Atheists, and now swim in joy, [...] (Erelong to swim at larg) and laugh; for which [...] The world erelong a world of tears must weepe. [...] To whom thus Adam of short joy bereft. [...] O pittie and shame, that they who to live well [...] Enterd so faire, should turn aside to tread [...] Paths indirect, or in the mid way faint! [...] But still I see the tenor of Mans woe [...] Holds on the same, from Woman to begin.

In the medieval centuries, the Islamic civilization paid wonderful attention to mechanical engineering. Banu Mosa invented 100 ingenious devices including automatic fountains and automatic feedback level control systems.

40|$|Believing that {{renewable}} energy innovation {{is just one}} of many ways to wean humankind's dependence on fossil fuels, this paper explores alternative methods by which a firm may align the needs of those stakeholders (<b>Inventers,</b> Entrepreneurs, and Consumers) deemed critical to the creation and commercialization of {{renewable energy}} solutions. The literature suggests that innovative efforts are best served when Inventors work in peer-driven communities founded on open source principles, Entrepreneurs adopt open innovation in which they actively source R&D beyond their walls, and Consumers allow Inventors and Entrepreneurs to work harmoniously together. While all three stakeholder groups may be singularly focused on renewable energy innovation, combining them within one framework proves challenging due to competing interests regarding funding, intellectual property ownership, and governance. Instrumental stakeholder theory suggests that resolving these competing interests is a job best suited for a centralized firm capable of identifying, prioritizing, and balancing the different needs within the stakeholder constellation. However, the inclusion of this firm introduces one additional stakeholder (the shareholder) whose profit-maximization interests, by law, take priority over all others needs and interests. Using Delphi-inspired research methodology, this paper explores what might emerge if stakeholders created a self-sustaining system in which managerial decisions were governed solely by the renewable energy goals of Consumers, Inventors, and Entrepreneurs rather than by the profit-maximization goals of shareholders...|$|E
40|$|This book {{presents}} a timely reconfiguration of {{the relations between}} art, philosophy, ethics, and aesthetics. Through connection {{with a range of}} contemporary social and philosophical issues and movements, this collection of essays highlights the imperative of sensorial aesthetics. The book focuses on the radical philosophical approach to aesthetics enabled by the works of Jean-François Lyotard and Gilles Deleuze. From these philosophers an older meaning of aesthetic has been recalled. Before it indicated primarily the theory of art and beauty, aesthetic referred to the sensibility, the capacity to receive sensations. In summoning this sensorial meaning of aesthetics in their respective works, Lyotard, Deleuze, and other recent thinkers turn the philosophical theory of aesthetics away from the dominance of cognitivist and reception theories, and towards a thinking of aesthetics through considerations of the movements of matter, affect, and sensation. This vital transformation of aesthetics in turn allows a reconfiguration {{of the relationship between the}} domains of art, aesthetics, and philosophy. If aesthetics focuses on sensation, rather than cognition, then artists, musicians, and philosophers alike appear not only as phenomenological and empirical thinkers, but as experimenters with the parameters of the sensible, able to extend our perceptual interface with the world. Rather than artists deferring to philosophers in regard to the meaning of their works, this new understanding of aesthetics suggests that philosophers ought to defer to artists, who are understood as <b>inventers</b> in the realm of sensibility...|$|E

Contre cette {{indolence}} intellectuelle qui nous prive peu à peu de notre sens des nouveautés spirituelles, l’enseignement des découvertes le long de l’histoire scientifique est d’un grand secours. Pour apprendre aux élèves à <b>inventer,</b> il est bon de leur donner le sentiment qu’ils auraient pu découvrir. "First year university {{courses in}} Physics, as we led them over years, {{do not seem}} to work out anymore [2]. Starting from this observation, we propose a reaction consisting in the rewriting and enrichment of these courses oriented by the idea of introducing the students to the original sense and motivation of their contents. As an example, we will present the structure of a course of basic geometrical optics focused on the essential part of the usual formal contents of geometrical optics, but which gives priority to discovery, self-investment and reflection. An ambitious objective that we try to get closer to by a structural interaction between the classic formalism of physics and fundamental questions arising from history of sciences...|$|R

The invention shall be be susceptible of industrial application, which means that {{it should be possible to}} reproduce or use in any other industrial way. The reqirement that the invention shall be new means that the technique must not be previously known because of patents, published articles, etc. That an invention shall be a contribution to the state of the art in a technical field means that the invention shall not be obvious to invent for a person skilled in the art. Patents do effect the innovation among the <b>inventers,</b> but in most industries most inventions would be invented independent if there was a patent system or not. Only in pharmaceuticals- and chemicals industries, the patent is of a great importance. Patents are probably of lesser importance for the computer industry than for those industries, even though the industry is of great importance for many other industries and therefor, the patent system can be of great importance for some computer-implemented inventions as well. There is a risque the the competition is negatively affected by the patent system, becuase of the monopoly it gives. I believe, though, that the gain of the patent system compensates for the risque of imperfections in the market. The free movement for goods, persons, services and capital will probably not be affected if the proposal of the directive about patentibility of computer-implemented invention will get passed...|$|E
40|$|Contrary to {{the idea}} of {{following}} a precise conceptual plan in what concerns translation choices and beliefs, and to the detriment of traditional more prescriptive views on translation techniques, the possibility of intuition and creativity surface from contemporary critiques upon the matter. Such shift has not only bestowed translations with a deserved arena for them to perform their task, but has actually provided them with important tools for one to position him/herself socially and politically in what regards an issue that have always been social and political: the text. When I kidnap meaning from the original and suggest it actually belongs to every instance that happens to touch it, the autonomy inevitably directed by this process towards translator and reader ultimately grants both an opportunity to inflict a material and consistent influence on such meaning. That  is, when I pose that meanings do not belong to the original, such meanings end up losing their status of “possessions” – and eventually one learns they do not belong to anyone at all. The question one might be asking is: why would this autonomy to transform necessarily change anything for those involved in the enterprise of translation? Well, it does change many things; not to say everything. As translators acknowledge the active role they play for the maintenance or alteration of certain narratives, their task is no longer taken as a simple – uncontrollable – code transferring; i. e., translators are turned from rewriters into writers, from carriers  of old meanings into <b>inventers</b> of new ones. In the book Interconnecting Translation Studies and Imagology (2015) – edited by Peter Flynn, Luc van Doorslaer, and Joep Leerssen – the authors and compiled articles address {{the fact that it is}} only through a more autonomous notion of translation that questionable cultural aspects, as well as prejudiced images of this or that tradition, might be finally overcome...|$|E
40|$|Purpose- Just {{before the}} {{approval}} of the Bayh dole Act, universities and colleges in the United States of America were used to be associations with the main aim focused on research and education and they could not imagine taking other missions. The approval of this act gave universities the right to submit and take advantage of their research results and academic achievements as intellectual properties which were done by governmental budget. Still over fifty years the Bayh dole Act is considered as the most inspiring act and significant factor in salient development of innovation and its consequent national productivity in the 1990 s economy of America. With the encouraging economic and financial outcomes, many other countries like Iran got enthusiastic to authorize and implement the same act. Although Islamic Republic of Iran with developing economy has approved similar academic commercialization rules, they were not successful in practice. Consequently they could not result to similar effects of the Bayh dole Act such as the mutation in development of academic innovation or the commercialization of knowledge base products in universities and, apparently they could not even increase the transfer technology offices (TTO) or the number of university patents and products either. Design/methodology/approach- This article first introduces the background and the contexts of the Bayh dole passage in America and then explains the Act‟s main outcomes in America‟s innovation and academic commercialization system. Also it takes a brief look at the similar rules and regulations in other countries including Singapore, China and India. Findings- Moreover, this article contains the comparative study of these regulations and related acts in other countries, especially in America, and their similarities and differences. Finally, by interviewing the Iranian <b>inventers</b> and experts, the defect of internal acts, factors and reasons of their disappointed implementation are illustrated.

40|$|Learning as Thinking Up, an {{introduction}} to the didactic concept of "insension". ”Apprendre” in French, is an activity, meaning both “to teach” {{from the point of view}} of the teacher, and “to learn” from the perspective of the student (hereafter referred to as the “Subject” or the “Uninitiated”). The activity’s analysis by Professional Didactic, that is to say an analysis of what is productive and constructive within an action, can be applied to “learning”. However, in attempting to understand the learning process, one recognizes that there do exist, along with the conceptualization within the action, times when the subject learns by self-incorporating knowledge. This is when the Subject reacts, by use of induction, that is to say by the colligation of scattered elements, as they are perceived and/or imagined. Thus, the Subject accesses to the meaning he or she gives to learning. This grasping of the meaning or "insension" is an invention of the Subject which participates in a double development: on the one hand, the knowledge appropriated to the Subject by the Subject, initiates his skills’ development, and on the other hand, the thinking up learning activity is linked to the development of the Subject’s identity. Educational training planning requires taking into account the Subject’s personal reference framework. In order to lead the Uninitiated towards “knowing”, that is to say, the incorporation of referenced knowledge, it is necessary that the training schemes have, as a starting point, the point of view of the Uninitiated. The Uninitiated is recognized as being able to learn from his or her personal reference framework, that is to say able to act on referenced knowledge for its self-incorporation. The insension (colligation) transforms it into personal knowledge. Therefore, the Subject accesses to social recognition of its skills. Apprendre comme <b>Inventer,</b> essai pour introduire le concept didactique d'insension. Apprendre est une activité, aussi bien au sens de « to teach », du point de vue de l’enseignant, apprendre comme enseigner, qu’au sens de « to learn », du point de vue de l’apprenant, c’est-à-dire apprendre comme connaître. L’analyse de l’activité par la Didactique professionnelle en tant qu’analyse de ce qui est productif et constructif dans l’action, peut s’appliquer à l’action d’apprendre. Or il existe, à côté de la conceptualisation dans l’action, des moments où le Sujet apprend en s’incorporant à lui-même la connaissance. Ce moment est un acte du Sujet par induction, c’est-à-dire par colligation d’éléments épars, perçus et/ou imaginés. Le Sujet accède ainsi au sens qu’il donne en acte à l’apprendre. Cette saisie du sens, ou « insension » est une invention du Sujet qui participe doublement à son développement : d’une part, les connaissances appropriées au Sujet par le Sujet engagent le développement de sa compétence, d’autre part, l’activité d’apprendre comme <b>inventer</b> est conjointe au développement identitaire du Sujet. Pour l’ingénierie didactique de formation, apprendre à enseigner demande l’écoute de la singularité du cadre de référence du Sujet. Pour faciliter à l’ignorant le passage à la connaissance, c’est-à-dire à l’incorporation des savoirs référencés, il faut que les dispositifs de formation aient pour point de départ la perspective de l’apprenant. Le Sujet ignorant est reconnu capable d’apprendre à partir de son cadre de référence, tel qu’il est, c’est-à-dire capable d’un acte d’incorporation pour soi des savoirs que l’insension (colligation) transforme en connaissances. Le Sujet peut alors accéder socialement à la reconnaissance de sa compétence...|$|R
