40|$|For {{individuals}} with vision-touch synaesthesia, {{the sight of}} touch on another person elicits synaesthetic tactile sensation on the observer's own body. Here we used the traditional rubber <b>hand</b> paradigm (Botvinick and Cohen, 1998) and a no-touch rubber <b>hand</b> paradigm to investigate and to authenticate synaesthetic tactile sensation. In the traditional rubber <b>hand</b> paradigm, the participant views a prosthetic <b>hand</b> being touched by the Examiner while the participant's <b>hand</b> - hidden from view - is also touched by the Examiner. Synchronous stimulation of the prosthetic <b>hand</b> and the participant's hidden <b>hand</b> elicits the rubber <b>hand</b> illusion. It may seem to the participant that she is feeling touch {{at the location of}} the viewed prosthetic <b>hand</b> - visual capture of touch, and that the prosthetic <b>hand</b> is the participant's own <b>hand</b> - illusion of ownership. Thus, for participants who experience the traditional rubber <b>hand</b> illusion, tactile sensation on the participant's hidden <b>hand</b> is referred to the prosthetic <b>hand.</b> In our no-touch rubber <b>hand</b> paradigm, the participant views a prosthetic <b>hand</b> being touched by the Examiner but the participant's <b>hand</b> - hidden from view - is not touched by the Examiner. Questionnaire ratings indicated that only {{individuals with}} vision-touch synaesthesia experienced the no-touch rubber <b>hand</b> illusion. Thus, synaesthetic tactile sensation on the (untouched) hidden <b>hand</b> was referred to the prosthetic <b>hand.</b> These individuals also demonstrated proprioceptive drift (a change, from baseline, in proprioceptively perceived position) of the hidden <b>hand</b> towards the location of the prosthetic <b>hand,</b> and a pattern of increased proprioceptive drift with increased trial duration (60 sec, 180 sec, 300 sec). The no-touch rubber <b>hand</b> paradigm was an excellent method to authenticate vision-touch synaesthesia because participants were naïve about the rubber <b>hand</b> illusion, and they could not have known how they were expected to perform on either the traditional or the no-touch rubber <b>hand</b> paradigm...|$|R

40|$|Lateral biases {{are evident}} {{in a number of}} {{behaviors}} across many organisms. The present work was concerned with the particular lateral phenomenon known as handedness. Previous research has suggested that handedness is not a one-dimensional trait. This study evaluated handedness using two factors: <b>hand</b> preference and <b>hand</b> performance. <b>Hand</b> preference refers to the <b>hand</b> chosen to carry out a given action whereas <b>hand</b> performance refers to each <b>hand’s</b> ability, or skill, at carrying out that action. The relationship between <b>hand</b> preference and <b>hand</b> performance has been studied extensively in adults, but the larger body of work with human infants has only assessed <b>hand</b> preference. The goals of this study were to develop a methodology to measure infant <b>hand</b> performance and to begin {{to examine the relationship between}} <b>hand</b> preference and <b>hand</b> performance in development. To this end, thirty-six 11 -month-old infants were videotaped completing three tasks. The first task assessed <b>hand</b> preference and consisted of a free-play period during which infants were presented with a series of toys that afforded different types of manipulation. The second and third tasks were novel measures of infant <b>hand</b> performance. The second task assessed the infant’s gross motor skills and involved fitting a ball into the top aperture of a toy. The third task assessed the infant’s fine motor skills by requiring infants to retrieve a Cheerio from a stationary plastic cup. Overall, the majority of infants were found to be right-preferent. This was in agreement with previous studies of <b>hand</b> preference in 11 -month-olds as well as the pattern of <b>hand</b> preference seen in adults. There was no group-level asymmetry on either measure of <b>hand</b> performance. <b>Hand</b> preference was regressed on <b>hand</b> performance in an overall model of handedness. The right <b>hand’s</b> performance on each task significantly predicted <b>hand</b> preference scores. This was the first study to demonstrate that <b>hand</b> preference can be predicted by <b>hand</b> performance in infants. Future work will examine infant <b>hand</b> proficiency in greater detail as well as the relationship between <b>hand</b> preference and <b>hand</b> performance in nonhuman primate infants...|$|R
40|$|<b>Hand</b> 1 {{is a basic}} helix-loop-helix {{transcription}} factor that is essential for development of the placenta, yolk sac and heart during mouse development. While <b>Hand</b> 1 is essential for trophoblast giant cell (TGC) differentiation, its potential heterodimer partners are not co-expressed in TGCs. To test the hypothesis that <b>Hand</b> 1 functions as homodimer, we generated knock-in mice in which the <b>Hand</b> 1 gene was altered to encode a tethered homodimer (TH). Some <b>Hand</b> 1 conceptuses in which the only form of <b>Hand</b> 1 is <b>Hand</b> 1 are viable and fertile, indicating that homodimer <b>Hand</b> 1 is sufficient for mouse survival. ~ 2 / 3 of <b>Hand</b> 1 and all <b>Hand</b> 1 mice died in utero and displayed severe placental defects and variable cardial and cranial-facial abnormalities, indicating a dosage-dependent effect of <b>Hand</b> 1. Meanwhile, expression of the <b>Hand</b> 1 protein did not have negative effects on viability or fertility in all <b>Hand</b> 1 mice. These data imply that <b>Hand</b> 1 homodimer plays a dominant role during development and its expression dosage is critical for survival, whereas <b>Hand</b> 1 heterodimers can be either dispensable or play a regulatory role to modulate the activity of <b>Hand</b> 1 homodimer in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) The basic Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) {{transcription}} factors <b>Hand</b> 1 and <b>Hand</b> 2 play critical {{roles in}} the development of multiple organ systems during embryogenesis. The dynamic expression patterns of these two factors within developing tissues obfuscates their respective unique and redundant organogenic functions. To define cell lineages potentially dependent upon <b>Hand</b> gene expression, we generated a mutant allele in which the coding region of <b>Hand</b> 1 is replaced by Cre recombinase. Subsequent Cre-mediated activation of β-galactosidase or eYFP reporter alleles enabled lineage trace analyses that clearly define the fate of <b>Hand</b> 1 -expressing cells. Comparisons between <b>Hand</b> 1 expression and <b>Hand</b> 1 -lineage greatly refine our understanding of its dynamic spatio-temporal expression domains and raise the possibility of novel <b>Hand</b> 1 functions in structures not thought to be <b>Hand</b> 1 -dependent. To genetically examine functional overlap between <b>Hand</b> 1 and <b>Hand</b> 2, we conditionally deleted <b>Hand</b> 2 from <b>Hand</b> 1 -expressing cells. <b>Hand</b> 2 conditional knockout mice die midgestation and exhibit cardiovascular and limb defects.
