5|$|Counsel for the Commonwealth Crown Solicitor {{presented}} {{evidence that}} the Amana was on fire before it first struck trees. Counsel for the widow {{of one of the}} victims suggested the crash may have been caused by the <b>elevator</b> <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> jamming in the diving position.|$|E
25|$|Investigation of {{the crash}} {{uncovered}} some errors in the information {{used to determine the}} position of the aircraft's centre of gravity. It became clear that the aircraft had taken off with its centre of gravity slightly outside the approved limits. Investigators also found evidence that the takeoff may have been performed with the <b>elevator</b> <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> still set for landing. If the <b>elevator</b> <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> had not been set for takeoff this would have been exacerbated by the incorrect position of the centre of gravity and the aircraft would have been uncontrollable.|$|E
25|$|Developmental {{evolution}} of the Parrot to include common engine cowling, nose gear and rudder assemblies with the PS-28 Cruiser, plus the addition of rear windows, larger <b>elevator</b> <b>trim</b> <b>tab,</b> removal of rudder horn and the empty weight was reduced. First flown 6 December 2010.|$|E
50|$|On 23 December 1937, {{the first}} {{production}} Wellington Mk I, L4212, conducted its first flight; L4212 subsequently {{participated in an}} intensive flight programme. Flight trials with L4212 confirmed the aerodynamic stability initially encountered by K4049, but also revealed the aircraft to be nose-heavy during dives, which was attributed to the redesigned elevator. Accordingly, modifications, including the interlinked of the flaps and the <b>elevator</b> <b>trim</b> <b>tabs,</b> were successfully trialled on L4212 to resolve the issue.|$|R
5000|$|The {{accident}} {{flight was}} the first flight after maintenance personnel replaced the forward <b>elevator</b> <b>trim</b> cable. When the flightcrew received the airplane, the captain {{did not address the}} recent cable change noted on his maintenance release. The captain also did not perform a first flight of the day checklist, which included an <b>elevator</b> <b>trim</b> check. Shortly after takeoff, the flightcrew reported a runway (sic) trim, and manually selected nose-up <b>trim.</b> However, the <b>elevator</b> <b>trim</b> then traveled to the full nose-down position. The control column forces subsequently increased to 250 pounds, and the flightcrew was unable to maintain control of the airplane. During the replacement of the cable, the maintenance personnel skipped a step in the manufacturer's airliner maintenance manual (AMM). They did not use a lead wire to assist with cable orientation. In addition, the AMM incorrectly depicted the <b>elevator</b> <b>trim</b> drum, and the depiction of the orientation of the cable around the drum was ambiguous. The maintenance personnel stated that they had completed an operational check of the airplane after maintenance. The Safety Board performed a mis-rigging demonstration on an exemplar airplane, which reversed the <b>elevator</b> <b>trim</b> system. An operational check on that airplane revealed that when the electric trim motor was activated in one direction, the <b>elevator</b> <b>trim</b> <b>tabs</b> moved in the correct direction, but the trim wheel moved opposite of the corresponding correct direction. When the manual trim wheel was moved in one direction, the <b>elevator</b> <b>trim</b> <b>tabs</b> moved opposite of the corresponding correct direction. NTSB ...|$|R
50|$|When a {{servo tab}} is employed, it is {{moved into the}} {{slipstream}} opposite to the control surface's desired deflection. For example, in order to <b>trim</b> an <b>elevator</b> to hold the nose down, the <b>elevator's</b> <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> will actually rise up into the slipstream. The increased pressure {{on top of the}} <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> surface caused by raising it will then deflect the entire elevator slab down slightly, causing the tail to rise and the aircraft's nose to move down. In the case of an aircraft where deployment of high-lift devices (flaps) would significantly alter the longitudinal trim, a supplementary <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> is arranged to simultaneously deploy with the flaps so that pitch attitude is not markedly changed.|$|R
25|$|With the {{information}} obtained from Learmonth’s radio commentary the problem plaguing the Australian-built Beauforts was {{traced to a}} component in the <b>elevator</b> <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> actuating unit. All the RAAF Beauforts were grounded until they were modified to eliminate the problem. Learmonth is credited with supplying the vital information that was necessary to identify the problem and eventually solve it. A secret World War II landing field at Exmouth Gulf, Western Australia, known only by the code-name Potshot, was eventually developed into a permanent military base and named RAAF Learmonth in honour of Wing Commander Charles Learmonth.|$|E
25|$|The PT-22 {{fuel system}} {{consists}} of a single tank mounted forward of the front cockpit. Fuel is gravity fed to the carburetor. The oil system is a dry-sump type, with all oil stored in a tank located on the front side of the firewall in the upper section of the fuselage. The wing flaps are mechanically operated from a lever located {{on the left side}} of each cockpit. Adjustable elevator trim is provided via an <b>elevator</b> <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> controllable from a handwheel mounted {{on the left side of}} each cockpit. In its original configuration, the aircraft was not equipped with an electrical system. Hydraulic brakes are provided for each wheel, controllable via the rudder pedals in each cockpit.|$|E
500|$|On {{learning}} of the crash at nearby Seven-Mile Beach employees of Australian National Airways raced from Cambridge aerodrome to lend assistance. [...] About 11:15pm the rear fuselage came to the surface a short distance off-shore. Donald Butler, one of the employees, feared the air hostess might still be trapped in her seat {{in the rear of}} the fuselage. [...] He took a length of rope, swam out to the floating piece of structure, attached the rope to the tailwheel and then swam back to the beach. [...] A motor lorry was used to drag the rear fuselage ashore but there was no-one inside. The right tailplane, elevator and trim tab were almost undamaged. [...] The <b>elevator</b> <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> was still set appropriately for a shallow climb after take-off.|$|E
50|$|The plywood covered wing {{is built}} around a single glass fibre spar using foam {{reinforced}} ribs. Aft of the engine, the fuselage is a wooden semi-monocoque. The single seat cockpit is enclosed with a rearward sliding canopy. The fin and balanced rudder are straight tapered and square tipped, as is the rearward set horizontal tail. The prototype had <b>elevator</b> <b>trim</b> <b>tabs</b> but these were removed in favour of the flap trims noted above. Extra fin area is provided by a long strake on the lower fuselage, extending aft to the tailwheel.|$|R
50|$|On many aircraft, the {{tailplane}} assembly {{consists of}} a fixed surface fitted with a hinged aft <b>elevator</b> surface. <b>Trim</b> <b>tabs</b> {{may be used to}} relieve pilot input forces; conversely in some cases, such as small aircraft with all-moving stabilizers, anti-servo tabs are used to increase these forces.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development and}} wind tunnel evaluation of an SMA based smart <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> for a typical two seater civil aircraft. The SMA actuator was housed in the port side of the elevator {{for the purpose of}} actuating the <b>trim</b> <b>tab.</b> Wind tunnel tests were conducted on a full scale horizontal tail model with <b>elevator</b> and <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> at free stream speeds of 25, 35 and 45 m...|$|R
2500|$|In {{its report}} the panel stated the {{accident}} {{was caused by the}} aircraft being loaded so its centre of gravity was behind the rear limit. [...] The report also stated that incorrect setting of the <b>elevator</b> <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> may have been a contributory cause.|$|E
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} {{had been}} in daily civil operations in Australia since November 1946 so the investigators assumed {{there must have been}} numerous flights with the centre of gravity significantly more than 39% of Mean Aerodynamic Chord. [...] It was necessary for the investigators to find something unique about the fatal flight of VH-BAG that would explain its sudden climb immediately after take-off and the pilot's inability to regain control and prevent the aircraft crashing. [...] The aircraft's tailplane {{was one of the few}} parts of the aircraft not destroyed by fire. [...] The position of the <b>elevator</b> <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> spool appeared to be in the normal position for landing rather than a typical position for take-off. The investigators concluded that on the final takeoff it was likely that the <b>elevator</b> <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> was still set for landing. [...] This, coupled with the aircraft being tail-heavy and longitudinally unstable after undercarriage retraction, caused the aircraft to pitch nose-up so strongly that the pilot was unable to retain control or prevent the aircraft stalling.|$|E
2500|$|The Delta first flew on 11 March 1939, {{registered}} as G-AFPX. On 14 May 1939, piloted by A.N. Kingwill, it was demonstrated at the Royal Aeronautical Society's garden party fly-in at Great West Aerodrome, also at Heston Aerodrome. On 10 July 1939, it crashed near Bicester, killing the pilot Hugh Olley and the Delta's designer, Percival Willoughby. [...] The crash was not {{attributed to the}} novel configuration but to an ill-designed <b>elevator</b> <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> that sent the Delta into a dive. [...] Nonetheless, {{with the death of}} the designer and the coming of war, no more was heard of this type of flying wing.|$|E
50|$|The {{tail unit}} was metal framed and fabric covered. The {{tailplane}} was externally braced and the <b>elevators</b> carried <b>trim</b> <b>tabs.</b> The fin was straight edged but the rudder, which {{extended to the}} bottom of the fuselage and worked in a cut-out between the elevators, had a full, curved trailing edge.|$|R
25|$|As {{well the}} new engines, the AX2000 differs chiefly from the AX3 {{in having a}} {{completely}} double surface wing of reduced area and modified structure, a change of alloy for the main keel beam, a revised and lightened fuselage with new undercarriage, an increased fuel capacity {{and the addition of}} an <b>elevator</b> anti-balance <b>trim</b> <b>tab.</b>|$|R
50|$|The PL.3 had a {{low wing}} built entirely of wood, covered with plywood, {{tapering}} uniformly both in chord and thickness from wide, deep roots to rounded tips. The tail was conventional, the tailplane set at mid-fuselage with straight swept leading edges and carrying <b>elevators</b> with <b>trim</b> <b>tabs.</b> The fin was triangular, with a rounded rudder ending above the fuselage.|$|R
2500|$|However, in 2002 {{a review}} process {{conducted}} by the AAIU (Air Accident Investigation Unit) disclosed that Aer Lingus paperwork relating to a routine maintenance inspection carried out on the aircraft in December 1967 {{was found to be}} missing in 1968. [...] Moreover, a large body of research was done by the investigators after the accident, regarding the maintenance operating plan used for EI-AOM and defects on the aircraft found during analysis of the maintenance records. [...] This research was not referred to in the 1970 report. A new board of investigation was set up by the Irish Government and found that the crash was the consequence of a chain of events starting with a failure to the left tail-plane caused by metal fatigue, corrosion, flutter or a bird strike, with the most likely cause being a flutter-induced fatigue failure of the <b>elevator</b> <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> operating mechanism.|$|E
2500|$|The Escapade has a Chromoloy {{steel frame}} and is largely fabric covered. The wings have {{constant}} chord, ending in Hoerner-type wingtips; the trailing edges are aluminum. The ailerons and flaps, which can extend to 40°, have glass fiber leading edges. [...] The wings are braced {{to the lower}} fuselage longerons with V-form struts and vertical jury struts. [...] The fuselage is polygonal in section, sloping inwards {{above and below the}} center line, with a flat aluminum upper surface that slopes upwards from the tail to the wing trailing edge, {{at the rear of the}} cabin. [...] The empennage is conventional, the low aspect ratio tailplane with its swept leading edge and rounded elevators located at the top of the fuselage. [...] There is a portside flight-adjustable <b>elevator</b> <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> with optional electric drive. [...] The unbalanced rudder extends to the keel, moving in a V-shaped gap between the elevators.|$|E
2500|$|On 6 January 1944, Learmonth led a {{formation}} of three No. 14 Squadron Bristol Beauforts on an exercise off Rottnest Island with ships of the US Navy. At {{a height of}} [...] and about [...] north-west of Rottnest Island his Beaufort began to shake violently. The Australian-built Beauforts were plagued by a mysterious problem that had destroyed over 90 aircraft and killed many crews, including many under training at RAAF East Sale. Learmonth recognised that the violent shaking was driven by the tail of his aircraft and he called Flight Lieutenant Ken Hewitt, the pilot {{of one of the}} other Beauforts, to fly in close and observe his tail. Hewitt could see the control rod to the <b>elevator</b> <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> on Learmonth’s Beaufort, hanging down. It had separated from the tab, allowing the tab and elevator to oscillate and drive the violent shaking of the whole aircraft. Learmonth used his radio to advise the crews of the other two Beauforts what he was observing. Shortly afterwards, the trim tab flicked to the extreme up position, over-powering Learmonth and forcing the aircraft to descend rapidly. After less than a minute Learmonth’s Beaufort crashed into the sea, killing Learmonth and his three crew members. The wireless operator on one of the other Beauforts reported sighting a parachute {{on the surface of the}} water.|$|E

50|$|It is a {{conventional}} single-engine low-wing monoplane, seating two in tandem. The wings are wooden structures with fabric covering. They carry 5° of dihedral and are braced with struts {{running from the}} upper fuselage longerons to the upper wing surface. There are no flaps. The tail surfaces are also built of wood, with fabric covering. The fin and rudder are tall, tapered and straight edged. The <b>elevators</b> carry <b>trim</b> <b>tabs.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In June 1938, the U.S. Navy {{signed a}} {{contract}} with Vought for a prototype bearing the factory designation V-166B, the XF4U-1, BuNo 1443. The Corsair design team was headed up by Rex Beisel. After mock-up inspection in February 1939, construction of the XF4U-1 powered by an XR-2800-4 prototype of the Pratt & Whitney Double Wasp twin-row, 18-cylinder radial engine, rated at [...] went ahead quickly, as the very first airframe ever designed from the start to have a Double Wasp engine fitted for flight. When the prototype was completed it had the biggest and most powerful engine, largest propeller and probably the largest wing on any naval fighter to date. The first flight of the XF4U-1 was made on 29 May 1940, with Lyman A. Bullard, Jr. at the controls. The maiden flight proceeded normally until a hurried landing was made when the <b>elevator</b> <b>trim</b> <b>tabs</b> failed because of flutter.|$|R

50|$|A {{single piece}} canopy covers the tandem seats, with {{the rear seat}} higher than the other. Behind the cockpit the {{fuselage}} line falls to the tail. The tailplane is straight edged with rounded tips and carries marked anhedral. The fin and rudder are also straight edged but swept; {{there is a small}} additional ventral fin. <b>Elevator</b> has <b>trim</b> <b>tabs.</b> The Master has a tricycle undercarriage, the nosewheel retracting rearwards and the main legs inwards into the wings. The track is 2.01 m (6 ft 7 in).|$|R
5000|$|The Merchantman had {{a similar}} boom mounted tail to the Aerovan, with an almost {{straight}} leading edge to the horizontal stabiliser, carrying <b>elevators</b> with <b>trim</b> <b>tabs</b> on a strongly tapered trailing edge. There were three vertical surfaces, one central with a rudder and two endplate fins with large moveable surfaces that acted as <b>trim</b> <b>tabs.</b> [...] The outer fins had the same shape found on many Miles aircraft: symmetrical and elliptical at the top but blunted below. The Aerovan's central fin was semi-elliptical, but the initial arrangement on the Merchantman continued the ellipse below the boom. This form was changed quite soon after the first flight tests, when a dorsal fin above the boom replaced the lower surface.|$|R
