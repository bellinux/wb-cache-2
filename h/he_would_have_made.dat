5|$|The {{timing of}} Frederick's {{death and the}} length of his reign are {{important}} topics among historians. The premature demise of Frederick III is considered a potential turning point in German history; and whether or not <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> the Empire more liberal if he had lived longer is still discussed.|$|E

25|$|The game then cuts to {{the past}} as a young Dauragon arrives at a hospital, telling them his sister is dying. However, they turn him away. As he walks though the rain, a {{limousine}} pulls up alongside him, and Master Mikado and Wong get out, taking Dauragon and Dominique with them. Later, Mikado adopts Dauragon as his heir. After Mikado dies, Dauragon takes over the company, with Wong praising him for the man he has become, saying <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> his father proud.|$|E
25|$|On May 3, Carl Crawford set a team {{record and}} tied a modern-day league record with six stolen bases. The last player to steal six bases was Eric Young {{while he was}} a member of the Colorado Rockies on June 30, 1996. It was only the fifth time since 1912 that a player had stolen that many bases, which was also the last year it had {{happened}} in the American League. After the game Crawford stated that he didn't know he had tied a record, or else <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> an attempt for seven.|$|E
500|$|Miller often {{required}} a contest to retain {{interest in the}} game. He deplored Bradman's ruthless attitude towards annihilating the opposition and sometimes refused to try when Australia was in an unassailable position. At Southend in 1948, as the Australians scored a world record 721 runs {{in a single day}} against Essex, Miller, coming in to bat when the score was 2/364, allowed himself to be bowled first ball. Indeed, he [...] "turned to the wicketkeeper and said: [...] "Thank God that's over"." [...] His teammate Sid Barnes said that if Miller [...] "had the same outlook as Bradman or Ponsford <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> colossal scores" [...] and become [...] "the statisticians' greatest customer".|$|E

500|$|Commenting on the {{controversy}} the book generated, Steiner admitted to literary journalist and critic Ron Rosenbaum (author of Explaining Hitler) {{that he too}} was disturbed by it, adding that his fictional Hitler had gotten the better of him, [...] "golem- or Frankenstein-like". He said that {{it felt like the}} book [...] "wrote me". Steiner also pointed out that the novella is not only about his thoughts on the Holocaust, but also about the horrific events that took place in countries like Cambodia, Vietnam, El Salvador and Burundi: [...] "My feeling is that one has to grapple with the abyss if one can." [...] In his 1997 memoir, Errata: An Examined Life, Steiner remarked that had he known what the response to The Portage and its stage interpretation would be, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> the novella [...] "my foremost business".|$|E
500|$|Since {{his first}} visit to London with the Ballets Russes in 1911, Monteux had had a [...] "love affair with London and with British musicians". He had {{conducted}} for the fledgling BBC in an orchestral concert at Covent Garden in 1924, where he conducted the first public performance of the BBC Wireless Orchestra, and for the Royal Philharmonic Society at the Queen's Hall in the 1920s and 1930s. In 1932 he was one of four conductors who took charge of the Hallé Orchestra in Manchester in the absence of its principal conductor; the other three substitutes were Sir Edward Elgar, Beecham and the young Barbirolli. The Hallé players were immensely impressed with Monteux, and said that his orchestral technique and knowledge easily beat those of most other conductors. In 1951 he conducted the BBC Symphony Orchestra in a concert of Mozart, Beethoven and Bartók in the new Royal Festival Hall, and made further appearances with London orchestras {{during the rest of the}} 1950s. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> more but for Britain's strict quarantine laws, which prevented the Monteuxs from bringing their pet French poodle with them; Doris Monteux would not travel without the poodle, and Monteux would not travel without his wife.|$|E
500|$|There were a {{large number}} of changes made to the game. Additional stages and {{divisions}} between battle and exploration were created; defense and dodge actions were added for characters; extensive vertical plains were added to environments; enemy and boss AI was redesigned and refined; additional enemies and subbosses were included; a new difficulty level was added; and the POW gauge, inventory and Psypher systems were redesigned. At the time Odin Sphere was made, it was fully intended to be a successor to Princess Crown, but Vanillaware had since become better known for fast-paced action over simple side-scrolling combat. The gameplay was thus adjusted so that it would be familiar to players of the later and more refined [...] and Dragon's Crown. [...] Kamitani later commented that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> extensive changes such as removing the alchemy system, but other staff members—who were fans of Odin Sphere and were employed after the game's release—successfully pushed to retain and improve rather than remove the original features. According to Ohnishi, how to adjust the gameplay was difficult for the team to decide: elements included the way health and magic energies were raised separately, and how the alchemy system worked. With this in mind, these systems were adjusted so they would be more accessible for people with varied playing styles. The revamped system drew from the team's work on Dragon's Crown. There was no original story content created, although additional text archives were created and the existing text was rewritten in places. The ability to skip story sequences, unavailable in the original release, was included. It was also decided not to have the different sections be playable out of order, as that would negatively impact the story.|$|E

2500|$|The Sydney Cricket Ground had an outfield {{of thick}} grass {{which made it}} very {{difficult}} to score boundaries.

[...] "Frankly, this makes it very difficult for the Republican Party," [...] Berkman is quoted as saying.

2500|$|Beyond this, nothing {{certain is}} known of Fiore's {{activities}} in the 15th century. Francesco Novati and D. Luigi Zanutto both assume that some time before 1409 he accepted an appointment as court fencing master to Niccolò III d'Este, Marquis of Ferrara, Modena, and Parma; presumably <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> this change when Milan fell into disarray in 1402, though Zanutto {{went so far as}} to speculate that he trained Niccolò for his 1399 passage at arms. However, while two surviving copies of [...] "the Flower of Battle" [...] are dedicated to the marquis, it seems more likely that the manuscripts were written as a diplomatic gift to Ferrara from Milan when they made peace in 1404.|$|E
2500|$|Director John Goldschmidt's film The Other Spike dramatised Milligan's nervous {{breakdown}} {{in a film}} for Granada Television, for which Milligan wrote the screenplay and in which he played himself. Later that year, he was commissioned by the BBC to write and star in Q5, {{the first in the}} innovative [...] "Q" [...] TV series, acknowledged as an important precursor to Monty Python's Flying Circus, which premiered several months later. There was a hiatus of several years, before the BBC commissioned Q6 in 1975. Q7 appeared in 1977, Q8 in 1978, Q9 in 1980 and There's a Lot of It About in 1982. Milligan later complained of the BBC's cold attitude towards the series and stated that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> more programs, had he been given the opportunity. A number of episodes of the earlier [...] "Q" [...] series are missing, presumed wiped. In 1979 he hosted an episode of The Muppet Show.|$|E

2500|$|Star Wars creator George Lucas {{considered}} {{adding a}} shot of Fett escaping the Sarlacc in Return of the Jedi, but decided against it {{because it would have}} detracted from the story's focus, instead leaving the task of [...] "reviving" [...] Fett to Expanded Universe canon. Lucas also said that, had he known Fett would be so popular, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> the character's death [...] "more exciting." [...] Lucas at one point considered depicting Vader and Fett as brothers in the prequel films, but discounted it as too [...] "hokey." [...] In continuing to develop the character in the prequel films, Lucas closed some avenues for expanding the character's story while opening others. Fett escaped from the Sarlacc in the Star Wars Legends continuity, but since that continuity no longer counts as canon in the official canon, Fett's final fate was left unknown, although it is likely that he died. However, in July 2014, Star Wars historian Jonathan W. Winzler revealed that Lucas had told him that Fett escaped from the Sarlacc, but this still needs to be demonstrated in the official canon.|$|E
2500|$|Hill escorted the Russian convoys PQ 15, PQ 16 and {{the unfortunate}} PQ 17, in which twenty-three out of thirty-four freighters were sunk after {{a signal to}} scatter was {{received}} from the Admiralty. Hill's Senior Officer on PQ 17, Captain Jack Broome, wrote that [...] "after PQ 17 [...] had little faith in the shore staff who directed operations at sea. He was part rebel: in another age <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> an excellent – if humane – pirate". After taking part in Russian convoy escort duty, the Ledbury {{was transferred to the}} Mediterranean, arriving in the Straits of Gibraltar to join the escort for Convoy Pedestal. In early August, thirteen merchant ships and the tanker Ohio, with an escort of aircraft carriers, battleships, cruisers, destroyers and submarines, left Gibraltar. The convoy was continuously assaulted by Axis airpower, U-boats and E-boats. After a few days at sea, the convoy was attacked by Luftwaffe Ju 88 dive bombers and torpedo bombers. During this attack, Hill took the Ledbury through the columns of freighters, crossing and reaching the head of the column to have [...] "a better place to shoot at these planes".|$|E
2500|$|A similar {{incident}} {{occurred in the}} Second Test, though {{it might not have}} been seen as a problem if it had not followed the events of the first. Bradman was on 22 when he appeared to snick another catch to Ikin at short leg, but [...] "this time there may have been some cause for doubt; it was an appeal that could have gone either way". Bradman was given not out and made 234, so in his first two innings he made 421 runs, but if he had he been given out <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> only 50. In the Fourth Test at Adelaide Cyril Washbrook was given out to Ray Lindwall to a ball that Don Tallon scooped off the ground. Washbrook [...] "stood there transfixed. Even some of the Australian leg-side fielders expressed amazement". Tallon was known for his impetuous appealing - [...] "he was often roaring before he had studied facts and it was his over-eagerness that brought about the shocking decision" [...] - and Bradman asked him if he still wanted to appeal. Tallon said he did and Bradman stood by the decision. It was later suggested that Tallon told Bradman {{that it was not a}} clean catch and Clif Cary thought if Bradman had gone into the matter further he would have recalled Washbrook as had happened in other such cases. The Australian reporter Ray Robinson wrote [...] "I believe nearby fieldsmen were impetuous in appealing as the wicket-keeper scooped up the ball, and that the hesitant umpire would have been wiser to have asked his square-leg colleague whether it carried to the gloves or was gathered on the half-volley". Hammond tried to locate a press photograph of the ball touching the ground to show the ABC, who demanded proof of the incompetence of the umpires before they were willing to change them, but no photo was found.|$|E
