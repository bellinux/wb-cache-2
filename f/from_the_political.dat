5|$|Most Polish historians {{agree that}} the Polish {{capitulation}} was a mistake both from the military perspective, and the political one. In the realm of military, the Poles had reasonable chances to defend the Vistula river line, and exhaust the Russian invading forces. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> one, showing willingness to fight could have persuaded the partitioning powers that their plan was too costly.|$|E

The civilian arm of the government was replaced with Khánh appointees, and Thơ left politics, having personally enriched himself during his period in government. His activities after leaving politics are not known. He died in 1976 in Saigon.|$|E
5|$|As {{a show of}} {{communist}} rule and Soviet domination, sixteen prominent leaders of the Polish anti-Nazi underground were brought to trial in Moscow in June 1945. Their removal <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> scene precluded {{the possibility of a}} democratic transition called for by the Yalta agreements. The trial of the defendants, falsely and absurdly accused of collaboration with the Nazis, was watched by British and American diplomats without protest. The absence of the expected death sentences was their relief. The exiled government in London, after Mikołajczyk's resignation led by Tomasz Arciszewski, ceased to be officially recognized by Great Britain and the United States on 5 July 1945.|$|E
5|$|Behan {{utilized}} his existing {{position and}} his superior political connections to successfully lobby for the position. He also promised Wyatt {{a position as}} his undersheriff if he was appointed over Wyatt. Wyatt withdrew <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> contest and the governor and legislature appointed Behan to the job of Cochise County sheriff on February 10, 1881. Behan reneged on his deal with Earp and appointed Harry Woods as undersheriff instead. Behan said he broke his promise to appoint Earp because Wyatt Earp used Behan's name to threaten Ike Clanton when Wyatt recovered his stolen horse from Clanton.|$|E

5|$|During the 15th {{century in}} Japan, peasant revolts, known as ikki, {{became much more}} commonplace. During the turmoil of the Ōnin War (1467–1477) and {{subsequent}} years, these rebellions increased in both frequency and success. Many of these rebels became known as Ikkō-ikki, a collection of peasant farmers, Buddhist monks, Shinto priests, and jizamurai (lesser nobles) who all espoused belief in the Jōdo Shinshū sect of Buddhism. Rennyo, the Hongan-ji abbot who led the Jōdo Shinshū movement, attracted a large following in Kaga and Echizen Province, but distanced himself <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> goals of the ikki, advocating violence only for self-defense or defense of one's religion.|$|E
5|$|France closely {{followed}} the election, deporting a Peace Corps teacher. The UDSG disappeared <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> scene, and M'ba's opposition {{was composed of}} parties that lacked national focus and maintained only regional or pro-democracy platforms. Nevertheless, the opposition garnered 46% of the vote and 16 of 47 seats in the assembly, while the BDG received 54% of the vote and 31 seats. The opposition disputed this, and held strikes across the country, though these {{did not have a}} sizable impact on business.|$|E
5|$|From 1890 to 1910, poll {{taxes and}} {{literacy}} tests were instituted across the South, effectively disenfranchising {{the great majority}} of black men. White male-only primary elections also served to reduce the influence of black men in the political system. Along with increasing legal obstacles, blacks were excluded <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> system by threats of violent reprisals by whites in the form of lynch mobs and terrorist attacks by the Ku Klux Klan. Some Democrats even advocated a repeal of the amendment, such as William Bourke Cockran of New York.|$|E

5|$|In a {{departure}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> {{traditions of the}} day, Weaver himself campaigned, making speeches across the South in July and August. As the Greenbackers had the only ticket that included a Southerner, Weaver and Chambers hoped to make inroads in the South. As the campaign progressed, however, Weaver's message of racial inclusion drew violent protests in the South, as the Greenbackers faced the same obstacles the Republicans did {{in the face of}} increasing black disenfranchisement. In the autumn, Weaver campaigned in the North, but the Greenbackers' lack of support was compounded by Weaver's refusal to run a fusion ticket in states where Democratic and Greenbacker strength might have combined to outvote the Republicans.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, federal {{prosecutors}} such as Eugene Reese attempted to prosecute responsible parties under federal laws against debt peonage. But such efforts received little support nationally and {{none in the}} South, which had disenfranchised most blacks to exclude them <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> system. Northern attention was focused on immigration and World War I. The convict lease system finally ended {{with the advent of}} World War II. National and presidential attention was focused on racial issues because of the need for national unity and mobilization of the military.|$|E
5|$|Jackson {{sided with}} the Eatons. He and his late wife Rachel Donelson had {{undergone}} similar political attacks stemming from their marriage in 1791. The two had married in 1791 not knowing that Rachel's first husband, Lewis Robards, had failed to finalize the expected divorce. Once the divorce was finalized, they married legally in 1794, but the episode caused a major controversy, and was used against him in the 1828 campaign. Jackson saw attacks on Eaton stemming ultimately <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> opposition of Calhoun, who had failed to silence his wife's criticisms. The Calhouns were {{widely regarded as the}} chief instigators.|$|E

While the pacifist faction carried damage control and held two toy give always for Three Kings Day in Puerto Rico, Ojeda was removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> branch on June 4, 1985, due to these conflicts, being only left in charge of his unit. Besides the boldness of the action, the EPB strategists were also unsatisfied when Ramírez failed to account for food expenses in his report.|$|E
5|$|The War of the Second Coalition (1799–1802) {{resulted}} in {{the defeat of the}} imperial and allied forces by Napoleon Bonaparte. The treaties of Lunéville (1801) and Amiens (1802) and the Mediatization of 1803 transferred large portions of the Holy Roman Empire to the dynastic states and secularized ecclesiastical territories. Most of the imperial cities disappeared <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> and legal landscape, and the populations living in these territories acquired new allegiances to dukes and kings. This transfer particularly enhanced the territories of Württemberg and Baden. In 1806, after a successful invasion of Prussia and the defeat of Prussia and Russia at the joint battles of Jena-Auerstedt, Napoleon dictated the Treaty of Pressburg, in which the Emperor dissolved the Holy Roman Empire.|$|E
5|$|The {{rest of the}} National Constituent Assembly {{followed}} the king within two weeks to new quarters in Paris. In short order, the entire body settled {{in only a few}} steps from the Tuileries at a former riding school, the Salle du Manège. However, some fifty-six monarchien deputies did not come with them, believing the mob threat in the capital to be personally dangerous. The October journées thus effectively deprived the monarchist faction of significant representation in the Assembly as most of these deputies retreated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> scene; many, like Mounier, fled the country altogether.|$|E

5|$|The topics the Drapier {{addresses}} span from absentee land {{owners to}} importing of goods from Britain to the favouring of Englishmen over Irishmen for Irish governmental positions. These issues were the many issues that Swift cared about and saw as threatening Ireland before Wood's halfpence controversy. However, these individual issues {{were not as}} important as the independence and unity of Ireland: the specifics of independence were less important than self-rule. Some argue that Swift, after Wood's patent was withdrawn, removed himself <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> landscape to focus on writing Gulliver's Travels, in which he picked up many of the same ideas.|$|E
5|$|To {{minimize}} Soviet opposition, Norway {{attempted to}} move the debate <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> to the specialist scene, {{while at the same}} time establishing a protocol for Norwegian control and operation of the facility. To achieve this, Norwegian authorities worked towards establishing an inspection procedure to insure that the facilities remained solely used for 'peaceful activities'. This would particularly focus on the regular inspection of auxiliary equipment. To depoliticize the issue further, the government appointed the semi-independent NTNF as the operator of the facility. The first oral consultations between the Soviet embassy and the Norwegian government took place in November 1964.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Cromwell in 1658, Monck {{remained}} aloof <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> manoeuvring in London {{that led to the}} brief establishment of a regime under the protector's son Richard Cromwell and after its fall the subsequent contest for power between the army leaders. When this proved incapable of producing a stable government in 1659 Monk opened negotiations with Charles II and began a slow march south with his army. After reaching London he restored the English Long Parliament that had existed {{at the beginning of the}} civil wars. This body, having received some assurances from Charles II, voted for a restoration of the monarchy in England and then dissolved itself. This created a de facto restoration of the monarchy in Scotland, but without any safeguards as to the constitutional position in the country. Scottish notables were in a weak position in negotiations with the crown as to what the settlement would be.|$|E
