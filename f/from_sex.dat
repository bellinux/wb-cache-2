25|$|In some religions, {{some groups}} of people are {{expected}} to remain unmarried and to abstain <b>from</b> <b>sex</b> completely. These groups include monks, nuns, and priests in various sects of Hinduism, Buddhism and Christianity. Chastity is required of the respective sacerdotal orders.

25|$|Bahá'í law limits {{permissible}} {{sexual relations}} to those {{between a man}} and a woman in marriage. Believers are expected to abstain <b>from</b> <b>sex</b> outside matrimony. Bahá'ís do not, however, attempt to impose their moral standards on those who have not accepted the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh. While requiring uprightness in all matters of morality, whether sexual or otherwise, the Bahá’í teachings also take account of human frailty and call for tolerance and understanding in regard to human failings. In this context, to regard homosexuals with prejudice would be contrary to the spirit of the Bahá’í teachings.|$|E
25|$|In a {{book written}} by Yehuda Berg, {{a former teacher}} at the center, he {{recommended}} that men not masturbate as semen generated without loving, shared intention does not serve its purpose. He also wrote that a man should not orgasm before the woman, as it injects selfishness into the act of love making. Other thoughts on sex include that a man should not orgasm with the woman positioned above him, as she is then drawing energies into herself from below, instead of above.

25|$|For the Indians of {{the central}} {{highlands}} of Mexico, the imbibing of pulque was done only by certain people, under certain conditions. It was a ritual drink, consumed during certain festivals, {{such as that of}} the goddess Mayahuel, and the god Mixcoatl. It was drunk by priests and sacrificial victims, to increase the priests' enthusiasm and to ease the suffering of the victim. There are many references in Aztec codices, such as the Borbonicus Codex, of pulque's use by nobility and priesthood to celebrate victories. Among commoners, it was permitted only to the elderly and pregnant women. Production of pulque was ritualized and the brewers were superstitious. They would abstain <b>from</b> <b>sex</b> during the fermentation period because they believed that sexual intercourse would sour the process.|$|E

25|$|This is {{one reason}} that the {{probability}} of transmitting many infections is far higher <b>from</b> <b>sex</b> than by more casual means of transmission, such as non-sexual contact—touching, hugging, shaking hands—but {{it is not the}} only reason. Although mucous membranes exist in the mouth as in the genitals, many STIs seem to be easier to transmit through oral sex than through deep kissing. According to a safe sex chart, many infections that are easily transmitted from the mouth to the genitals or from the genitals to the mouth are much harder to transmit from one mouth to another. With HIV, genital fluids happen to contain much more of the pathogen than saliva. Some infections labeled as STIs can be transmitted by direct skin contact. Herpes simplex and HPV are both examples. KSHV, on the other hand, may be transmitted by deep-kissing but also when saliva is used as a sexual lubricant.|$|E
