5000|$|The {{majority}} of modern agate cameos are carved {{with the aid}} of the Ultrasonic Mill. This is a process where multiple copies of a master design can be produced very quickly by pressing a master die onto the agate cameo blank. A film of <b>diamond</b> <b>slurry</b> is used to aid cutting and the die vibrates ultrasonically in a vertical motion. The master is often hand carved by a skilled cameo artist.The result is a cameo that has a satin surface texture described as [...] "freshly fallen snow" [...] (FFS) by Anna Miller. This texture and the lack of any undercutting are used by appraisers as markers to prove that the cameo is machine-made.|$|E

The self-developed bamboo charcoal polishing spindle and ultrasonic- assisted vibration mechanism {{are attached to}} a single lapping machine. In the machining process, ultrasonic vibration enables the <b>diamond</b> <b>slurry</b> to smoothly pass through the microscopic holes of bamboo charcoal; {{the end of the}} bamboo charcoalis able to continue machining {{on the surface of the}} workpiece through the grasping force which exists in the microscopic holes. Under the polishing and machining parameters of ultrasonic-assisted vibration, with a <b>diamond</b> <b>slurry</b> concentration of 0. 3 %, the experimental results show a polishing time of 20 [*]min, a loading of 25 [*]N on the workpiece surface, a spindle speed of 1200 [*]rpm, a vibration frequency of 30 [*]kHz and the original surface roughness value of Ra 0. 252 [*]μm equals that of a mirror-like surface at Ra 0. 017 [*]μm. These research results prove that by using bamboo charcoal and ultrasonic-assisted vibration for polishing, a very good improvement can be achieved on the workpiece surface...|$|E

30|$|Cylindrical (20 -mm {{diameter}} and 3  mm in height) and rectangular (45 [*]×[*] 4 [*]×[*] 4  mm) specimens were prepared firstly by uniaxial cold pressing, then by isostatic pressing at 200  MPa, and finally by pressureless sintering at 1500  °C for 1  h in air atmosphere {{in case of}} ZrO 2 - 3  mol% Y 2 O 3 and ZrO 2 - 3  mol% Y 2 O 3 + Al 2 O 3 and in argon atmosphere in case of ZrO 2 - 3  mol% Y 2 O 3 -NiO. The sintering of ZrO 2 - 3  mol% Y 2 O 3 -NiO composites was performed in argon atmosphere because the total sample destruction took place in case of sintering in air. The specimens used for mechanical testing were ground with a 180 -grit diamond wheel and were subsequently polished with <b>diamond</b> <b>slurries</b> to minimize machining flaws.|$|R

Polishing erases grinding marks and smooths the specimen to a mirror-like finish. Polishing on a bare metallic platen is called lapping. A typical polishing sequence for ceramics is 5 - 10 minutes each on 15-, 6- and 1-µm <b>diamond</b> paste or <b>slurry</b> on napless paper rotating at 240 rpm.

40|$|Mechanical {{amplitude}} magnified mechanism Abstract. Precision polishing of micro structured mold {{has been}} highly demanded {{due to the}} increasing demand for optics manufacturing such as solar optics and DVD pick-up system, and medical devices like µ-TAS [1 - 5]. These micro structured molds usually have complicated structure {{and need to be}} polished after grinding or cutting. In this paper, a three-axis low frequency vibration (3 DLFV) polishing actuator is proposed. The actuator consists of 3 multilayers-stacked piezoelectric actuators (PZT) incorporated with mechanical amplitude magnified mechanism. The mechanical amplitude magnified mechanism utilizes mechanical structures which is also called mechanical transformer, which is capable to elongate the stroke of the piezoelectric actuator to almost 13 times to 225 µm. By driving the PZT in sine wave with particular phase different, dual direction trajectory such as circle can be achieved, and is proved to be effective in precision mold polishing [8]. With the 3 DLFV actuations, polishing tool with polyurethane is actuated to stir the <b>diamond</b> <b>slurry</b> to achieve polishing effects. In polishing experiments, nickel-plating metal used as work pieces are polished with <b>diamond</b> <b>slurry</b> and the polished depths are measured. As a result, three-axis low frequency vibration (3 DLFV) is proposed and developed. Its capability in polishing precise mold is studied and confirmed to be efficient. In order to improve the work piece surface, a dwell time control method can be applied with the 3 DLFV...|$|E
40|$|The surface {{residual}} stress state induced by {{grinding and polishing}} an alumina/silicon carbide nanocomposite and monolithic alumina has been investigated using Hertzian indentation and fluorescence spectroscopy. Specimens were ground and then polished with <b>diamond</b> <b>slurry</b> with grit sizes ranging between 8 eta m and 1 mu m.

Surfaces of both ceramics were examined in cross-section by TEM and direct observations were made of the plastic deformation induced by different surface treatments. There is a change in the predominant deformation micromechanism from twinning in the alumina to dislocation generation in the nanocomposites...|$|E
40|$|Polycrystalline bare gold {{electrodes}} {{have been}} used as substrate for the preparation of self assembled monolayers (SAMs) of alkanethiols. Chemical cleaning and several mechanical polishing procedures of the electrode have been carefully tested in order to prepare monolayers of octadecyl-, mercaptans. By analyzing the cyclic voltammetric curves of hexacyanoferrate III and chlorpromazine and the electrochemical desorption of the coated monolayer, it appeared that the response at the bare electrodes is related to the cleaning procedure and that the structure of SAM coated gold electrodes is influenced by the polishing material used, i. e. <b>diamond</b> or alumina <b>slurry.</b> Electrochemical results have been confirmed by Auger analysis of the electrode surface. © 1995. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper will}} discuss recent advancements in cycle time {{reduction}} and process simplification of rapid lap-ping of sapphire and other materials. When cycle time is reduced, {{so is the}} amount of waste generated during the process. Reduction in process waste and higher through-put are two of the major benefits of the developed process. The technology discussed in this presentation can be applied to many different materials, among them SiC, GaN, AlN and other compound semiconductor materials. Diamond lapping process produces fraction of waste of conventional abrasive process. New <b>diamond</b> <b>slurry</b> has been developed. Perfor-mance, as compared to existing commercially available product, is over 25 % higher removal rate and equal or better surface finish.

40|$|Sapphire is a {{hard and}} {{anti-scratch}} material commonly used as cover glass of mobile devices such as watches and mobile phones. A mechanical polishing using <b>diamond</b> <b>slurry</b> is usually necessary to create mirror surface. Additional chamfering at the edge is sometimes needed by mechanical grinding. These processes induce residual stresses and the mechanical strength of the sapphire work piece is impaired. In this study wet etching by phosphate acid process is applied to relief the induced stress in a 1 ” diameter sapphire cover glass. The sapphire is polished before the edge is chamfered by a picosecond laser. Residual stresses are measured by laser curvature method {{at different stages of}} machining. The results show that the wet etching process effectively relief the stress and the laser machining does not incur serious residual stress...|$|E
40|$|Lapping for {{sapphire}} substrates {{was evaluated}} {{with respect to}} material removal modes. Firstly, a 3 -body removal mode that consists of <b>diamond</b> <b>slurry</b> and a metal-resin platen was tested. The metal-resin platen was produced by mixing metal particles (Cu, Al, and Sn) and resin. Secondly, we analyzed a 2 -body system using a fixed diamond abrasive pad with a low concentration of alumina slurry as a dressing for the pad surface. For each lapping process, we examined {{the function of the}} diamond abrasive particles. The fundamental characteristics of each process were observed to suggest optimal conditions for sapphire processing for various applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|Mechanical {{amplitude}} magnified mechanism Abstract. Demands {{of precision}} molds with complicated microstructures for digital {{devices such as}} DVD pick-up system, medical devices such as µ-TAS and solar optics etc. are increasing [1 - 5]. The structured molds must be polished after grinding or cutting {{in order to improve}} the surface roughness. In this paper, a two dimensional low frequency vibration (2 DLFV) polishing actuator using PZT is proposed and developed. The 2 DLFV consists of 4 mechanical amplitude magnified actuators (MechaTrans), a multilayer stacked piezoelectric actuator (PZT) incorporated with mechanical transformer, and a center piece. Mechanical transformer is a kind of flexure hinges structured that magnifies the stroke of the multilayer stacked piezoelectric actuator around 7 times to 120 µm. With this actuation, the tool vibrates in a circle trajectory to achieve polishing effect. In the polishing experiments, tungsten carbide molds (workpieces) are polished with <b>diamond</b> <b>slurry.</b> The surface roughness of the work pieces and polishing efficiency are evaluated.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the effect of methods of photoactivation and {{insertion}} on the Knoop hardness of the Z 100 and Alert composite resins. The specimens were confected in cavities measuring 4 x 4 mm. The insertion of material was carried out by means of two methods: single-portion technique and insertion of two 2 -mm-thick layers. When inserted in a single portion, the resin was compressed with a static load of 1 kgf on a glass slab recovered with a polyester strip, in order to remove the excess of material. After the removal of the glass slab and polyester strip, the materials were photoactivated by means of continuous light emitted by a XL 3000 unit with a light intensity of 520 mW/cm 2 for 40 seconds; double pulse, with light emission of 150 mW/cm 2 for 10 seconds, plus 30 seconds with light intensity of 520 mW/cm 2 emitted by a XL 3000 unit; and pulsatile light of 520 mW/cm emitted by the Optilux 400 unit, turned on for 2 seconds and off for 2 seconds, during 60 seconds. The two layers of the material submitted to double insertion were photoactivated in the same conditions as the bulk-inserted material, and the excess of material was also removed from the second layer. After storage in a stove at 37 C and 100 % relative humidity for 24 hours, the specimens were embedded in polyester resin, trimmed and polished with sandpaper and <b>diamond</b> <b>slurry.</b> Knoop hardness was assessed in 4 depths with a HMV Shimadzu penetrometer under the load of 50 g during 30 seconds.

For Z 100, all activation methods produced smaller hardness values when double insertion was carried out. Meanwhile, for Alert, continuous light promoted statistical similarity between the insertion techniques. For Z 100, there was statistical similarity between the activation methods only when the double-insertion technique was employed.

40|$|Este trabalho verificou o efeito do tipo de inserção (duas camadas ou bloco único) e dos métodos de fotoativação (luz contínua, duplo pulso ou intermitente), sobre a dureza Knoop dos compósitos Z 100 e Alert. Os corpos-de-prova foram confeccionados em cavidades de 4 x 4 mm, com o {{material}} inserido de duas maneiras diferentes: porção única ou em duas camadas de 2 mm de espessura cada uma. O material inserido numa única porção foi comprimido com carga estática de 1 kgf exercido sobre uma lâmina de vidro, interposta por uma tira de poliéster, para remoção do excesso. Depois de retirar a lâmina de vidro e a tira de poliéster, a fotoativação foi por luz contínua emitida pelo aparelho XL 3000, com intensidade de 520 mW/cm², por 40 segundos; duplo pulso, 10 segundos com emissão de 150 mW/cm² mais 30 segundos com 520 mW/cm² com o aparelho XL 3000; e luz pulsátil de 520 mW/cm² emitida pelo aparelho Optilux 400, sendo 2 segundos ligado e 1 segundo desligado, por 60 segundos. As duas camadas da inserção dupla foram fotoativadas nas mesmas condições da inserção única, assim como a remoção do excesso de material da última camada. Após armazenagem em estufa a 37 ºC e umidade relativa de 100 % por 24 horas, os corpos-de-prova foram embutidos em resina de poliéster, desgastados e submetidos ao polimento com lixas de granulação decrescente e pasta de diamante. A dureza Knoop foi avaliada em diferentes profundidades com penetrômetro HMV Shimadzu, sob carga de 50 g durante 30 segundos. Os resultados submetidos à análise de variância e ao teste de Tukey (5 %) mostraram que o Z 100 apresentou maior valor de dureza; a inserção dupla foi melhor que a inserção única e a dureza de superfície foi maior que nas demais profundidades, independente dos demais fatores. No Z 100 todos os métodos de fotoativação promoveram maior dureza na inserção dupla, enquanto no Alert a ativação por luz contínua promoveu similaridade estatística entre os dois tipos de inserção. O Z 100 mostrou similaridade estatística entre os métodos de fotoativação somente na inserção dupla, enquanto no Alert a similaridade estatística ocorreu na inserção única entre as ativações por duplo pulso e luz pulsátil.
