500|$|In September 2013, it was {{reported}} that many senior members of the organizing committee, including then-CEO Ian Troop, expensed Ontario taxpayers for things such as a cup of tea. This led to outrage among provincial politicians including Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne, [...] "I'm <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it's ridiculous. It is the kind of entitlement that is unacceptable". In response to the backlash the organization released an updated expenses and travel policy in November 2013. In December 2013, the CEO Ian Troop was ousted by the organization's board of directors, just three months after the expense scandal came into light. He was replaced by Saad Rafi. In 2014, more expenses by the organization came under scrutiny including boxes of South American wine.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Selfish things!' thought Alice, {{and she was}} <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> 'Good-night' {{and leave}} them, when Tweedledum sprang {{out from under the}} {{umbrella}} and seized her by the wrist.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said James, [...] "I was <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{we would}} make it your way. I rather {{think it would be}} better to make it towards the land." ...|$|E
60|$|Mortimer had <b>just</b> been <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{something}} else, but {{he checked}} himself.|$|R
6000|$|... 'By your leave, Father,' he said, after exchanging salutations with a priest, who was <b>just</b> <b>going</b> out <b>to</b> <b>say</b> his morning's mass, {{and leaving}} his tiny bare cell empty. Here Sir Patrick could incredulously tell his story, and the {{merchant}} could only sigh and own that {{he feared that}} there was {{every reason to believe}} that the intention was real. Jaques Coeur, religiously, was shocked at the idea, and, politically, wished the Dauphin to make a more profitable alliance. He whispered that the sooner the lady was out of reach the better, and even offered to advance a loan to facilitate the journey.|$|R
6000|$|Polly was <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> shrink away, <b>saying,</b> [...] "Oh I can't!" [...] {{when she}} remembered that Tom once called her a coward. Here {{was a chance to}} prove that she was n't; besides, poor Tom had no one else to help him; so she came up to the sofa where he lay, and nodded reassuringly, as she put a soft little hand {{on either side of the}} damaged head.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hush, Rusha," [...] said Patience, {{not much}} liking this disclosure, however Jerusha {{might have come}} by the knowledge, [...] "you and Emlyn don't want to quarrel when she is <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> good-bye!" ...|$|E
60|$|Gentleman Jack had {{lowered his}} revolver, and was {{standing}} waiting to explain all, with the insufferable {{look of the}} man who is <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that he has only done his duty and requires no thanks.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{got such}} a funny expression--just the mate of the look in your eyes; {{as if you were}} <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{something}} ridiculous. He said, the very first time he saw you, that he knew you were humorous." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{tell you}} what I can do!" [...] Joey was confronting all the world now, with his head thrown back and his face flushed with his earnestness. [...] "I can love him and stand by him, and I will. When he gets out of--of prison, he'll come to see me, I know he will. And I'm <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> hug him and kiss him and say, 'Never mind, Father. I know you're sorry for what you've done, and you're never <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do it any more. You're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be a good man and I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> stand by you.' Yes, sir, that's <b>just</b> what I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> him. I'm all the {{children}} he has and there's nobody else to love him, because I know Aunt Beatrice doesn't. And I'm going with him wherever he goes." ...|$|R
5000|$|Souled Out {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 76, based on 10 reviews. Kyle Anderson, writer for Entertainment Weekly, found the album {{to be more}} pop friendly that her debut extended play Sail Out, continuing to call the album a [...] "parallel dimension where the future of R&B arrived a long time ago." [...] Pitchforks Craig Jenkins concluded [...] "Souled Out capably buffs Jhené Aiko's strengths and shellacks her faults, but the moments where she steps out into the depth of her story transcend the synergy {{of a group of}} musicians with good chemistry." [...] Marcus K. Dowling of HipHopDX felt Aiko's writing was [...] "intentionally simple and evocative," [...] continuing <b>to</b> <b>say</b> [...] "you're as much sucked into wondering <b>just</b> what she's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> next as much as you just want to hear a high-quality song." [...] Tshepo Mokoena of The Guardian said, [...] "She may purr like a revamped Ashanti, but she sounds tough as nails when it matters." [...] Ken Capobianco from The Boston Globe concluded that [...] "Aiko's producers, including No I.D. and Dot da Genius, create expansive, inventive tracks that mirror the allure of her lithe vocals and intimate phrasing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> explain, {{though you}} {{might take a}} lady's word for it without asking any questions. Now, what I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> is <b>just</b> between you four, and must go no farther. I have my own reasons for wishing {{to keep it from}} the police. Who {{do you think it was}} who struck me last night, Admiral?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The Andersons!" [...] cried Ethel, laughing. [...] "Margaret was <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it. We {{only want}} Harry, to exact the forfeit! Poor dear little humming-bird! It gives one an oppression on the chest, {{to think of}} her having that great do-nothing brother on her hands all day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't {{understand}} this at all, sir. Mr. Savine made that drawing. I know his arrows on the measurement lines, and I was <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{so when you}} stopped me. I have a confession to make. I believe I dropped that paper out of my wallet on board the steamer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Aye, very true, my dear," [...] {{cried the}} latter, though Jane {{had not spoken}} a word--"I was <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> the same thing. It is {{time for us to}} be going indeed. The evening is closing in, and grandmama will be looking for us. My dear sir, you are too obliging. We really must wish you good night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. I {{had to come}} back. I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Europe next week, and I {{had to come to}} {{look after}} my boat, here; and I wanted <b>to</b> <b>say</b> good-by <b>to</b> Maynard. I was <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> speak to Maynard, and then sail my boat over to Leyden." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But {{you would}} enter San Francisco, Miss Melmotte, under such much better auspices,--if I may be allowed <b>to</b> <b>say</b> so,--as a married lady or as a lady <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be married.' ...|$|R
60|$|Oh, you be {{soon enough}} good-now. He's <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be lighted.|$|R
60|$|The old gentleman was <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that Oliver {{should not}} go out on any account; when a most {{malicious}} cough from Mr. Grimwig determined him that he should; and that, by his prompt discharge of the commission, he should prove to him the injustice of his suspicions: on this head at least: at once.|$|E
6000|$|Mother leaped up, furious, and snapped, [...] "I'm simply {{ashamed of}} you, {{the way you}} act, like you never would grow up and get a little common sense, what with scaring me into conniption fits, and as I was <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> and I only say it for your own good, if you haven't got enough sense to know how little sense you have got, you at your time of life, why, well, all I can say is--you ought to know better." ...|$|E
6000|$|Ethel did {{not like}} {{anything}} to {{be said to be}} too hard for her, and was very near pleading she only wanted time, but some recollection came across her, and presently she said, [...] "I suppose it is a wrong sort of ambition to want to learn more, in one's own way, when one is told it is not good for one. I was <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> I hated being a woman, and having these tiresome little trifles--my duty--instead of learning, which is yours, Norman." ...|$|E
60|$|All right. We'll be back. We're <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have {{a little}} talk.|$|R

2500|$|Masters {{attempted}} to keep Nova Studios afloat by finally producing sound films. [...] Masters {{had refused to}} make films with synchronous sound until 1983—long after most other gay pornographic studios had not only begun using dialogue synched to the actor's lip movements but also had moved from film to video. Masters' friend, William Higgins, had been recording sound for his films (but not using it) since 1978, and Falcon Studios released their first sound film in 1979. [...] "I hated sound at this time. [...] Because of my experience with Greek Lightning, partially, and I said, 'What will sound do for these films except make them ludicrous?' Because {{the kind of people}} we use in these films can't talk, can't act, have no background—they can't do any of these things, and it's <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be absurd <b>to</b> make them <b>say</b> things when they aren't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> them well." ...|$|R
60|$|There stood Mr. Chipperton, {{holding a}} lighted match, {{which he had}} just struck. He was looking at {{something}} on the wall. As we ran in, he turned and smiled, and was <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> something, when Corny threw herself into his arms, and his wife, squeezing by, took him around his neck so suddenly that his hat flew off and bumped on the floor, like an empty tin can. He always wore a high silk hat. He made a grab for his hat, and the match burned his fingers.|$|E
6000|$|Leaving the river, {{they began}} to ascend a steep chalky lane, which had been wet all the winter, and was now full of rough {{hardened}} wheel-ruts and holes made by slipping horses. Elizabeth thought that Robert Bruce's calthorps could hardly have made the ground more uneven, and she was <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> so, when Helen groaned out, 'What a horrid place! I slip and bruise my ancle every minute.' Upon which she immediately took {{the other side of}} the question, and answered, 'It is not nearly so bad as the long lane on the down, and you never complain of that.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Bud peeped out and was <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "I {{see nothing}} but snow," [...] when she saw that {{what looked like a}} party of flakes blowing up to the door was really the seven Kobolds loaded with great piles of white silkweed for their spinning. She dropped her best courtesy, smiled her sweetest smile, and called out, [...] "Welcome home, my masters!" [...] like a little maidservant, as she led the way to the large room, now bright and warm with the fire roaring up the chimney made by a hole in the old roots.|$|E
60|$|Adieu, my Clarinda! I am <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> propose {{your health}} {{by way of}} grace-drink. SYLVANDER.|$|R
6000|$|... "Only in name apparently," [...] said Clym {{with rising}} excitement. [...] "I believe she means to elope tonight with Wildeve. I am <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> look to it." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'I did, indeed,' responded Bob Sawyer, 'and I was <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that I wasn't at home, but if you'd leave {{a message}} I'd be sure {{to give it to}} myself; for he don't know me; no more does the Lighting and Paving. I think the Church-rates guesses who I am, and I know the Water-works does, because I drew a tooth of his when I first came down here. But come in, come in!' Chattering in this way, Mr. Bob Sawyer pushed Mr. Winkle into the back room, where, amusing himself by boring little {{circular}} caverns in the chimney-piece with a red-hot poker, sat no less a person than Mr. Benjamin Allen.|$|E
60|$|It {{was a year}} or two ago now. I {{was sitting}} one evening at the gate, smoking a pipe and looking at a {{newspaper}} I 'ad found in the office, when I see a gentleman coming along from the swing-bridge. Well- dressed, clean-shaved chap 'e was, smoking a cigarette. He was walking slow and looking about 'im casual-like, until his eyes fell on me, when he gave a perfect jump of surprise, and, arter looking at me very 'ard, walked on a little way and then turned back. He did it twice, and I was <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> something to 'im, something that I 'ad been getting ready for 'im, when he spoke to me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Sir Claude, [...] "I was <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> Let me {{tell you}} it will {{surprise}} you." [...] She had finished breakfast now and she sat {{back in her chair}} again: she waited in silence to hear. He had pushed the things before him a little way and had his elbows on the table. This time, she was convinced, she knew what was coming, and once more, for the crash, as with Mrs. Wix lately in her room, she held her breath and drew together her eyelids. He was going to say she must give him up. He looked hard at her again; then he made his effort. [...] "Should you see your way to let her go?" ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I'm <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> go home, {{sit on my}} {{couch and}} {{probably}} cry", said Sharpe after the game.|$|R
