60|$|Beginning to despair, I {{applied for}} one or two minor {{appointments}} in answer to advertisements inserted by the Board of Guardians and other public bodies. In each case was I not only unsuccessful, but men equally unknown, though with a greatly inferior college and <b>hospital</b> <b>record,</b> were chosen over my head. At length, suspecting that I was not being fairly dealt by, I made inquiries to discover that at the bottom of all this ill success was none other than Sir John Bell. It appeared that in several instances, by the shrugs of his thick shoulders and shakes of his ponderous head, he had prevented my being employed. Indeed, {{in the case of the}} public bodies, with all of which he had authority either as an official or as an honorary adviser, he had directly vetoed my appointment by the oracular announcement that, after ample inquiry among medical friends in London, he had satisfied himself that I was not a suitable person for the post.|$|E

40|$|Background: Population health {{attributes}} (such as disease {{incidence and}} prevalence) are often estimated using sentinel <b>hospital</b> <b>records,</b> which {{are subject to}} multiple sources of uncertainty. When applied to these health attributes, commonly used biased estimation techniques can lead to false conclusions and ineffective disease intervention and control. Although some estimators can account for measurement error (in the form of white noise, usually after de-trending), most mainstream health statistics techniques cannot generate unbiased and minimum error variance estimates when the available data are biased. Methods and Findings: A new technique, called the Biased Sample Hospital-based Area Disease Estimation (B-SHADE), is introduced that generates space-time population disease estimates using biased <b>hospital</b> <b>records.</b> The effectiveness of the technique is empirically evaluated in terms of <b>hospital</b> <b>records</b> of disease incidence (for hand-foot-mouth disease and fever syndrome cases) in Shanghai (China) during a two-year period. The B-SHADE technique uses a weighted summation of sentinel <b>hospital</b> <b>records</b> to derive unbiased and minimum error variance estimates of area incidence. The calculation of these weights is {{the outcome of a}} process that combines: the available space-time information; a rigorous assessment of both, the horizontal relationships between <b>hospital</b> <b>records</b> and the vertical links between each <b>hospital’s</b> <b>records</b> and th...|$|R

In 1957 it was sold again, and used as offices, a reading room, a <b>hospital</b> <b>record</b> room and four apartments. It was later turned into the law offices of Macuga, Liddle & Dubin, P.C.|$|E

50|$|Feeling {{threatened}} by the infant heir of the Khoury family, Felix kidnaps the child and leaves her in a dumpster in an alley. When she awakes, Paloma cannot find the baby and is convinced that her daughter was mysteriously stolen without a trace. Paloma's path will soon intersect with Bruno (Malvino Salvador), a kind man who just lost {{his wife and his}} newborn son due to complications in childbirth. While distressed by that incident, and wandering the streets, Bruno finds Paloma's daughter in a dumpster after he hears her crying. Bruno sees the incident as a divine sign, a chance for him to start a new life, and takes the baby girl home. Bruno receives help from his mother, a nurse named Ordália (Eliane Giardini), who works at the San Magno hospital, as well as an ob/gyn named Glauce (Leona Cavalli). Glauce helps Bruno keep the baby without having to go through the formal adoption process. He asks Glauce to change the <b>hospital</b> <b>record</b> to report that his wife gave birth to two children: a boy, who died, and a surviving girl. In love with Bruno, Glauce does what he asks, risking her career. A pact is made between Bruno, Ordália, and Glauce that this secret will never be revealed.|$|E

40|$|SummaryObjectivesThe {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to assess the case ascertainment and completeness of neonatal tetanus (NT) reporting and to estimate the incidence of NT in Dadu District, Pakistan. MethodsWe conducted active surveillance and <b>hospital</b> <b>record</b> reviews for suspected NT cases. We compared the cases of NT reported to the routine surveillance system with the cases identified through the <b>hospital</b> <b>record</b> reviews for 1993 through 2003. The two-source capture–recapture method was used to evaluate case ascertainment in the routine surveillance system and to estimate the incidence of cases of NT. ResultsActive surveillance and <b>hospital</b> <b>record</b> reviews identified 134 cases in addition to 274 cases in the routine surveillance system. The two-source capture–recapture method indicated that there would have been 463 cases during this period (95 % confidence interval (CI) = 418 – 508), representing an average annual incidence of 0. 62 per 1000 live-births. The overall completeness of routine reporting was 59. 2 %. The proportions of cases reported were 68. 1 % for government hospitals and 53. 8 % for private reporting sites. ConclusionsReporting of NT cases is incomplete. Active promotion of private sector participation, community involvement, and strengthening of the government sector as a way of improving NT reporting and surveillance is strongly suggested...|$|E
