5|$|The 11 snake species {{occurring}} in Puerto Rico are generally considered non-venomous, although research {{has concluded that}} at least one species, the Puerto Rican racer (Alsophis portoricensis), secretes venom. These species belong to 3 families and 4 genera: Typhlopidae (Typhlops genus), Boidae (Epicrates) and Colubridae (Alsophis and Arrhyton). The largest snake in Puerto Rico is the endemic Puerto Rican boa (<b>Epicrates</b> <b>inornatus)</b> with a maximum length of 12ft (3.7m). The diet of snakes in Puerto Rico consists of reptiles (Ameiva, Anolis, geckos), coquís and other frogs, and, to a lesser extent, mice, birds and bats (exclusively by the Puerto Rican Boa).|$|R
25|$|There are 20 {{species of}} {{reptiles}} and amphibians and, {{with the exception of}} Bufo marinus (Spanish: Sapo común), all are endemic. Reptiles include the Lagarto verde (Anolis cuvieri), lagartijo pigmeo (Anolis occultus), and boa de Puerto Rico (<b>Epicrates</b> <b>inornatus),</b> which is in danger of extinction; amphibians include the siguana (Ameiva exsul) and the culebra ciega (Amphisbaena caeca). Amphibians include coquí común (Eleutherodactylus coqui) and the coquí de la montaña (Eleutherodactylus portoricensis), a species denominated as vulnerable under Puerto Rico Law 6766. The Small Asian mongoose (Vernacular Spanish: Mangosta pequeña asiática; Taxonomy: Herpestes javanicus), has also been spotted inhabiting this forest.|$|R

2500|$|Toro Negro State Forest {{is home to}} 11 {{species of}} snakes, all non-venomous to humans. The Puerto Rican boa (<b>Epicrates</b> <b>inornatus)</b> grows to [...] in length and weighs about [...] It is a {{heavy-bodied}} snake with tan to dark brown body color and dark blotches down its back. It will defend itself with a bite, but kills its prey by suffocation. It is a protected species due to over-harvesting to collect oil and skins. It is nocturnal and prefers to remain under cover {{during the day and}} hunt at night. The Puerto Rican racer (Culebra Corredora; Alsophis portoricensis) grows to [...] It slinks around in the trees of the Toro Negro Forest. His body sports a solid brown color with each of his scales edged by a darker brown. Like the forest's other various garden snakes, it is a daytime hunter. The forest also features blind snakes. They spend nearly their entire lives underground but do sometimes take cover under rotting trees. They do not bite as they do not have teeth.|$|R
40|$|With a {{total area}} of 8900 km 2, Puerto Rico is the {{smallest}} of the Greater Antilles. It is divided in three physiographic regions or areas of relief: the mountainous interior, the karst region, and the coastal plains and valleys. The island comprises six ecological life zones: subtropical dry forest, subtropical moist forest, subtropical wet forest, subtropical rain forest, lower montane wet forest and lower montane rain forest. The herpetofauna of Puerto Rico consists of 25 species of amphibians (19 native, six introduced) and 56 species of reptiles (52 native, four introduced). The goal {{of this paper is to}} describe some of the present studies directed towards the conservation of Puerto Rican herpetofauna. Eleutherodactylus karlschmidti, E. jasperi and E. eneidae have not been seen or heard since 1976, 1981 and 1990, respectively, and are probably extinct.

Recovery efforts for Peltophryne lemur include a captivebreeding program, reintroductions island-wide educational outreach, protection and restoration of existing habitat, and the creation of new breeding ponds. Among reptiles, the first conservation efforts to protect <b>Epicrates</b> <b>inornatus</b> were limited to trying to halt collection and hunting. However, current strategies to preserve the boa include gathering basic biological information, habitat conservation, and educational outreach. Recent efforts for the conservation of Trachemys s. stejnegeri combine three research approaches to clarify the status of local populations: a mark-recapture-release study, field monitoring of reproductive activity (i. e., nocturnal patrolling to identify nesting activity), and field assessment of the potential impact of introduced species, particularly identification of predatory species and exotic turtles. Recovery initiatives for Cyclura stejnegeri include management of invasive mammals, a headstart program for hatchling iguanas, and the assessment of the etiology of a condition causing blindness in adult iguanas. A reforestation project aimed at recovering a local herpetofaunal assemblage after disturbances in a limestone valley in northern Puerto Rico is discussed. As population sizes of common colonizers such as Eleutherodactylus and Anolis increased, larger forest-interior and predatory species like <b>Epicrates</b> <b>inornatus,</b> Alsophis portoricensis and Anolis cuvieri followed. Finally, the Mona Island marine turtle monitoring program is discussed and compared to other similar programs in Puerto Rico. As these and other similar conservation efforts provide scientifically based management recommendations, we hope to succeed in conserving the diverse herpetofauna that characterizes Puerto Rico...|$|R
40|$|The endemic Puerto Rican boa (<b>Epicrates</b> <b>inornatus)</b> {{has spent}} 42 {{years on the}} Endangered Species List with little {{evidence}} for recovery. One significant impediment to effective conservation planning has been {{a lack of knowledge}} of the distribution of genetic variability in the species. It has previously been suggested that boas might best be protected around caves that harbor large populations of bats. Prior study has found Puerto Rican boas at relatively high densities in and around bat caves, which they use both to feed and seek shelter. However, it is unknown whether these behaviorally distinctive populations represent a distinct evolutionary lineage, or (conversely) whether caves harbor representative genetic diversity for the species across the island. We provide the first genetic study of the Puerto Rican boa, and we examine and compare genetic diversity and divergence among two cave populations and two surface populations of boas. We find three haplogroups and an apparent lack of phylogeographic structure across the island. In addition, we find that the two cave populations appear no less diverse than the two surface populations, and harbor multiple mtDNA lineages. We discuss the conservation implications of these findings, including a call for the immediate protection of the remaining cave-associated populations of boas...|$|R
40|$|Ornithologists have {{hypothesized}} that some tropical forest birds avoid snake predation by nesting in isolated trees {{that do not}} have vines and canopy contact with neighbouring trees. Here we review two complementary studies that support this hypothesis by demonstrating (1) that an abundance of vines and an interlocking canopy characterized Jamaican Black-billed Parrot Amazona agilis nest-trees that failed due to chick loss, presumably to snakes, and (2) that such trees were used preferentially by an arboreal snake congeneric to the snake implicated in the parrot losses. Evidence strongly suggested that losses of nestling Black-billed Parrots were due in substantial part to predation by the Jamaican (yellow) Boa Epicrates subflavus (Boidae). Studies of the closely related <b>Epicrates</b> <b>inornatus</b> on Puerto Rico revealed that trees used by boas had more vine cover and more crown or canopy contact with neighbouring trees than did randomly selected trees. Moreover, the boas had relatively large home ranges and were most active during March to July, which corresponds with the breeding season of parrots as well as other bird species. We suggest that nest failure due to snakes may be reduced in endangered bird species through isolating the nest-tree by eliminating vines and canopy contact with neighbouring trees and shrubs and by placing barriers on the nest-tree trunk...|$|R
