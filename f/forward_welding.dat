30|$|Brushing flux on the weld {{surface is}} the common way to {{introduce}} active elements. According to the variable properties of base metal and activating fluxes, several brushing methods [20 – 22] were put <b>forward</b> to <b>welding</b> different metal. Among these, the method called Activating flux TIG (A-TIG) welding pre-coating flux on the whole weld surface is the most deeply investigated and widely applied in industrial fabrication. To overcome the shortcoming of restricting weld efficiency and affecting the weld quality resulting from the flux coating process above-mentioned, Huang et al. [23, 24] creatively transferred the activating flux into the arc-pool coupling system through the argon shielding gas of TIG welding.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In actual welding process, swing welding {{was a very}} {{important}} way to improve the efficiency and quality of welding. This paper put <b>forward</b> a <b>welding</b> torch swing control system based on the DSP chip TMS 320 LF 2407 A, and described its structure, working principle, software implementation and anti-interference design. The control system could realize the swing welding methods set by control panel, control the running motor and swing motor motion, and could realize arbitrary adjustment of the welding torch swing parameters such as speed, amplitude and lag time. On site operation shows that the system is stable, high reliable and meets the demands of industrial field...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Aluminium Schottky {{contacts}} to n- and p-type SiC were fabricated by diffusion <b>welding.</b> <b>Forward</b> current-voltage {{measurements were}} made in a temperature range of 300 ÷ 773 °K. The basic Schottky parameters, such as saturation current (JS), barrier height (ФB), the ideality factor (η), the effective Richardson’s constant (A**) and the series on-resistance (Rsp) were obtained from U-I curves at different temperatures. The comparative analysis of temperature variations of these parameters is presented...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Thermal {{deformation}} of welding structure is inevitable in welding process. The deformation {{will not only}} change the appearance, shape and geometry size of the welding structure, reduce assembly quality but also may reduce the bearing capacity. On this basis, a welding deformation measurement based on visual method was proposed for {{the problem of the}} thermal deformation measurement in welding process. Theoretical calculations were carried out and an image processing and measurement algorithm based on MATLAB was also put <b>forward.</b> Then <b>welding</b> deformation measurement experiment was carried out and the results show that the welding deformation obtained by actual measurement is consistent with the theoretical analysis, proving the feasibility of welding deformation measurement based on vision. The welding deformation measurement based on visual method lays a foundation for automatic measurement of welding deformation...|$|R
5000|$|Construction of the SZD-40 Halny uses mixed materials, with a fibeglass {{laminated}} <b>forward</b> fuselage, <b>welded</b> {{steel tube}} centre-section truss, rolled aluminum tube rear fuselage boom and fibreglass laminate tail section.The wings, extended to 20m span by adding extensions {{to the roots}} using a section substantially modified from the Zefir 4's original NACA 66 216 416, were constructed from plywood, pressure moulded in concrete moulds {{and covered with a}} layer of glass-fibre, to give a very smooth and accurate finish. [...] Another meaningful modification from the original Zefir series wing was a change from Fowler (wing loading decreasing) flaps to camber increasing slotless flaps. This (flap) modification was a definite departure from previous (Zefir) attempts in variable wing geometry glider design. Notes by Eng. Jerzy Śmielkiewicz suggest that this was due to realisation that a laminar flow could not be sustained over the wing with (high speed retracted configuration) Fowler flap mechanism.|$|R

40|$|Vehicles {{could save}} ~ 110 {{million gallons of}} {{gasoline}} {{per year in the}} U. S. with heat exchangers acting as heat recovery ventilators in the air conditioning systems. Even more energy could be saved with in-vehicle heat exchangers by reducing heating energy in plug-in vehicles.
