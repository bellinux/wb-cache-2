25|$|A study {{performed}} by the Environmental Protection Agency (<b>EPA)</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Gas Research Institute (GRI) in 1997 sought to discover whether the reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from increased natural gas (predominantly methane) use would be offset by a possible increased level of methane emissions from sources such as leaks and emissions. The study concluded that the reduction in emissions from increased natural gas use outweighs the detrimental effects of increased methane emissions. More recent peer-reviewed studies have challenged {{the findings of this}} study, with researchers from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reconfirming findings of high rates of methane (CH4) leakage from natural gas fields.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background PUFAs are potent inhibitors of 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl {{coenzyme}} A (HMG-CoA) reductase, {{an enzyme}} catalyzing {{the conversion of}} HMGCoA to mevalonate, the rate limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis. Statins represent a class of drugs that are widely used to treat hypercholesterolemia {{for their ability to}} inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis <b>and</b> to up-regulate <b>the</b> synthesis of Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. PUFAs mediate many, if not all, actions of statins and this could be one mechanism by which they lower cholesterol levels. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate whether combined treatment with Eicosapentaenoic acid (<b>EPA)</b> <b>and</b> lovastatin enhanced <b>the</b> regulatory effect on gene expression of HMGCoA reductase and LDL receptor in HepG 2 cell line. Results The combined treatment with <b>EPA</b> <b>and</b> lovastatin enhanced <b>the</b> regulatory effect on gene expression of HMGCoA reductase and LDL receptor in HepG 2 cell line. Moreover, we detected a synergistic effect on the inhibition of cancer cell proliferation obtained by combination of <b>EPA</b> <b>and</b> Lovastatin.

25|$|All {{forms of}} {{chlorine}} are widely used, despite their respective drawbacks. One drawback is that chlorine from any source reacts with natural organic compounds {{in the water}} to form potentially harmful chemical by-products. These by-products, trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs), are both carcinogenic in large quantities and are regulated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (<b>EPA)</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Drinking Water Inspectorate in the UK. The formation of THMs and haloacetic acids may be minimized by effective removal of as many organics from the water as possible prior to chlorine addition. Although chlorine is effective in killing bacteria, it has limited effectiveness against protozoa that form cysts in water (Giardia lamblia and Cryptosporidium, {{both of which are}} pathogenic).|$|E

25|$|Early (1973) {{evaluations}} of the processes for removing dissolved arsenic from drinking water demonstrated the efficacy of co-precipitation with either iron or aluminum oxides. In particular, iron as a coagulant was found to remove arsenic with an efficacy exceeding 90%.

A team of European and Indian scientists and engineers have set up six arsenic treatment plants in West Bengal based on in-situ remediation method (SAR Technology). This technology does not use any chemicals and arsenic is left in an insoluble form (+5 state) in the subterranean zone by recharging aerated water into the aquifer and developing an oxidation zone that supports arsenic oxidizing micro-organisms. This process does not produce any waste stream or sludge and is relatively cheap.|$|E
40|$|Fish {{represent}} {{a rich source}} of the n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), particularly <b>the</b> eicosapentaenoic <b>and</b> docosahexaenoic acids (<b>EPA</b> <b>and</b> DHA) for <b>the</b> human consumer. Although <b>EPA</b> <b>and</b> DHA are more abundant in membrane phospholipids than in triacylglycerols, <b>the</b> content in <b>EPA</b> <b>and</b> DHA generally increases with the lipid content of fish muscle.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2008 Multi-factorial diseases, like obesity, {{are caused}} by genetic and {{environmental}} factors. Few studies examine potential interactions between genetic and environmental factors. Understanding these interactions can lead to better disease prevention. One important environmental factor related to obesity is omega- 3 fatty acids. Yup’ik Eskimos consume a high amount of two omega- 3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (<b>EPA)</b> <b>and</b> docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). This study examined 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in three genes: ADIPOQ, PPARG, and PPARGC 1 A. Also, 7 obesity phenotypes were examined: BMI, percent body fat, waist circumference, sum of skin-folds, plasma adiponectin, plasma triglycerides, and HDL cholesterol. Associations between these SNPs and phenotypes in 981 related Yup’ik Eskimos were examined using mixed models. Interactions were investigated with these SNPs and δ 15 N, a biomarker used to determine intake of <b>EPA</b> <b>and</b> DHA. <b>The</b> results showed that <b>EPA</b> <b>and</b> DHA modify <b>the</b> expression of all three genes. Additionally, SNPs in all three genes were associated {{with one or more}} obesity phenotypes. The most statistically significant results were with two SNPs in ADIPOQ and plasma adiponectin. This study supports the role of these genes in the etiology of obesity. Finally, this study demonstrates that these genes are influenced by <b>EPA</b> <b>and</b> DHA...|$|R

25|$|On May 9, 2000, a fire {{destroyed}} a seven-story aging warehouse {{at the company}} in Anderson County, Kentucky. It contained more than 17,000 wooden barrels of whiskey. Burning whiskey flowed from the warehouse, setting the woods on fire, causing limestone deposits to explode. Firefighters saved Lawrenceburg's water treatment plant from destruction. However, an estimated 20% of the whiskey flowed into the Kentucky River. The river contamination required the temporary shutdown of the water treatment plant. Officials ordered water usage restrictions. Businesses and schools were closed because of the water shortage. The alcohol spill also depleted the oxygen in the river, killing an estimated 228,000 fish along a 66-mile stretch.
