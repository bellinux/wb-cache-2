5|$|On 23 December 1972 at 16:30, the company's most fatal {{accident}} occurred. F-28 LN-SUY Sverre Sigurdson on Flight 239 from Ålesund to Oslo crashed at Asker, killing 40 of the 45 people on board, including {{the crew of}} three. The cause of the accident was never discovered, although a possibility could have been faults with the <b>instrument</b> <b>landing</b> system.|$|E
5|$|The AW101's {{navigation}} system includes a GPS receiver and inertial {{navigation system}}, VHF omnidirectional radio range (VOR), <b>instrument</b> <b>landing</b> system (ILS), TACAN, and automatic direction finding. The Mk1 and Mk3 {{are equipped with}} a Doppler velocity system (DVS) which provides relative ground velocities; the DVS is also linked into the AFCS {{as part of the}} autostabilisation system. For safety, the aircraft is equipped with obstacle and terrain avoidance warning systems, traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS), and both voice and flight data recorders.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Hornets {{were very}} similar to the {{standard}} USNavy variants, but incorporated a number of minor modifications. These included the addition of an <b>Instrument</b> <b>Landing</b> System/Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (ILS/VOR) system, a high-frequency radio, a different ejection seat harness and the deletion of all equipment used only to launch the aircraft from catapults. In addition, two of the Australian aircraft were fitted with flight-test instrumentation so that they could be used as part of trials.|$|E
40|$|<b>Instruments</b> of <b>land</b> {{policies}} {{are tied to}} its goals, as well as defined relations on property and law as set in the Constitution. Since these relations have changed in Slovenia, the <b>instruments</b> of <b>land</b> policy also have to change. When devising particular instruments, basic principles have to be respected, which are {{the starting point for}} particular procedures. Only adequate legally defined <b>instruments</b> of <b>land</b> policies can be implemented in practice and affect the growth and development of cities in Slovenia...|$|R

5|$|By 1959 the United States was {{concerned}} that the militarization of the Kola Peninsula would become the prime source of a Soviet attack on North America. A new discussion about location arose, with Alta and Kautokeino as the main alternatives. Banak was estimated to cost NOK4.9 million, NOK2.8 million less than Alta, had better <b>instrument</b> <b>landing</b> and weather conditions and allowed a longer runway. The main advantage of Alta {{was that it would}} be better suited for civilian traffic. The government and Parliament approved construction of Banak in 1959 on condition that it receive NATO funding.|$|E
5|$|See then {{elected to}} perform a visual {{circling}} approach, a simplified landing procedure allowing flight under instrument rules, {{as long as the}} pilot can keep the airfield and any preceding aircraft in sight. The reported weather conditions at the airport were adequate for this type of approach, but visibility was irregular and deteriorating rapidly. Stafford began to follow See's plane, but when he lost sight of it in the clouds he instead followed the standard procedure for a missed approach and pulled his aircraft up, back into the clouds for another attempt at an <b>instrument</b> <b>landing.</b>|$|E
5|$|The airport {{had very}} poor {{operating}} conditions. Whenever an aircraft was to land, the cranes at the shipyard {{had to be}} moved to allow sufficient clearance. Conversely, the airport {{could not be used}} when ships were launched. The industrial buildings were located just next to the taxiway. The control tower was located such that it did not have visual sight of the entire runway. The surrounding terrain, consisting of deep fjords, mountains and a town, made it impossible to install an <b>instrument</b> <b>landing</b> system. This again meant that the airport could only be served during daylight. The airport never received a permanent operating license.|$|E
50|$|Environmental finance {{is the use}} {{of various}} {{financial}} <b>instruments</b> (usually <b>land</b> trusts and emissions trading) to protect the environment. The field is part of both environmental economics and the conservation movement.|$|R
50|$|As {{is evident}} from this plot, the most densely {{instrumented}} portion of the globe is in the United States, while Antarctica is the most sparsely <b>instrumented</b> <b>land</b> area. Parts of the Pacific and other oceans are more isolated from fixed temperature stations, but this is supplemented by volunteer observing ships that record temperature information during their normal travels. This image shows 3,832 records longer than 50 years, 1,656 records longer than 100 years, and 226 records longer than 150 years. The longest record in the collection began in Berlin in 1701 and is still collected in the present day.|$|R
50|$|Schultz is a {{licensed}} airplane pilot (Commercial and Multi-Engine <b>Land</b> <b>Instrument</b> Rating).|$|R
5|$|The {{autopilot}} {{system used}} at the time had four basic control modes: HEADING, VOR/LOC, ILS, and INS. The HEADING mode maintained a constant magnetic course selected by the pilot. The VOR/LOC mode maintained the plane on a specific course, transmitted from a VOR (VHF omnidirectional range, a type of short-range radio signal transmitted from ground beacons) or Localizer (LOC) beacon selected by the pilot. The ILS (<b>instrument</b> <b>landing</b> system) mode caused the plane to track both vertical and lateral course beacons, {{which led to a}} specific runway selected by the pilot. The INS (inertial navigation system) mode maintained the plane on lateral course lines between selected flight plan waypoints programmed into the INS computer.|$|E
5|$|In March 1985, Partnair {{was granted}} {{concession}} for scheduled services from Fornebu via Notodden to Stavanger. The route was started on 15 August using a ten-seat Beechcraft 200 Super King Air and flew twice a day, {{five days a}} week. This route was made possible after an <b>instrument</b> <b>landing</b> system was installed at the airport. The NOK2 million cost had been paid for by Norsk Hydro, while Tinfos had paid NOK100,000 for new landing lights. The upgrades also included a new terminal, which included a café in the second story and seating for 14 people. Ticket sales and check-in was managed by NSB Reisebyrå, {{a subsidiary of the}} Norwegian State Railways. After five months, Partnair had lost NOK1.2 million on the route. In average, they were selling three to four tickets per flight to Stavanger, and one to Oslo. From March 1986, the leg from Notodden to Oslo was dropped and the service to Stavanger reduced. However, the route proved unprofitable and was eventually terminated later the same month.|$|E
5|$|On 1 June 1960, an Avro Anson {{aircraft}} suffered {{engine failure}} soon after take-off from Northolt and crash-landed {{on top of}} the nearby Express Dairies plant in South Ruislip. There were no fatalities. Later that year, on 25 October, a Pan Am Boeing 707, heading for Heathrow, mistakenly landed at Northolt with forty-one passengers on board. A Lufthansa Boeing 707 also attempted to land at the station on 28 April 1964 but was dissuaded by a red signal flare fired by personnel from Air Traffic Control. In the days before navigational aids such as <b>instrument</b> <b>landing</b> systems (ILS) and the global positioning system (GPS) were available, the letters NO (for Northolt) and LH (for Heathrow) were painted on two gasometers on the approach to each airfield, one at Southall for the approach to Heathrow's diagonal runway (coded 23L) and one at South Harrow for the approach to Northolt's runway (then coded 26), in an effort to prevent a recurrence of such errors. By the 1980s movements of privately owned aircraft, mainly corporate jets, outnumbered military aircraft. Civil flights were limited to 28 per day, with a maximum of 7,000 a year. This limit remained in force in 2008.|$|E
40|$|The {{design and}} {{fabrication}} {{of a novel}} soft <b>landing</b> <b>instrument</b> Soft <b>Landing</b> Ion Mobility (SLIM) is described here. Topics covered include history of soft landing, gas phase mobility theory, the design and fabrication of SLIM, as well as applications pertaining to soft landing. Principle applications devised for this instrument involved the gas phase separation and selection of an ionized component from a multicomponent gas phase mixture as combing technique to optimize coatings, catalyst, {{and a variety of}} alternative application in the sciences...|$|R
50|$|The {{airport was}} {{upgraded}} in 2005 {{at a cost}} of €10 million. The runway was lengthened from 1090 m to its present 1240 m; and in January 2006 a GPS <b>instrument</b> approach <b>landing</b> system was installed.|$|R
40|$|Classification-based global {{emissivity}} {{is needed}} for the NASA EOS/MODIS satel-lite <b>instrument</b> <b>land</b> surface temperature (LST) algorithm. It is also useful for Land-sat, AVHRR, and other thermal infrared instruments and studies. For our approach, a pixel is classified as one of fourteen “emissivity classes ” based on the conventional land cover classification and dynamic and seasonal factors, such as snow cover and vegetation index. The emissivity models we present provide the range of values for each emissivity class by combining various spectral component measurements with structural factors. Emissivity statistics are reported for the EOS/MODIS channels 31 and 32, which are the channels {{that will be used}} in the LST split-window algo-rithm. ...|$|R

40|$|Current {{knowledge}} about the gravity and geometry of the moon is discussed which has been obtained by Doppler tracking of lunar orbiters, laser ranging, metric photography, and various <b>instruments</b> <b>landed</b> on the moon. Determinations of spherical harmonic coefficients of the lunar gravitational field are described, significant features observed {{in the field are}} noted (including the Orientale complex), and measurements of physical librations are reviewed. Systems for determining the lunar geometry and topography are described along with their intrinsic disadvantages. Tectonic implications of the lunar gravitational field and shape are discussed in regard to thermal evolution, marked variations in elevations, crustal and mascon formation, and volcanism...|$|R
5000|$|Boyne Mountain Airport {{is located}} {{southwest}} of the US-131 and M-75 intersection. The airport is privately {{owned and operated by}} Boyne Resorts. The airport supports a 5,200-foot paved and lighted jet strip, and permits <b>instrument</b> approach <b>landing.</b>|$|R
50|$|San Salvador International Airport {{is one of}} the few {{airports}} in the Bahamas that has <b>Instrument</b> rating <b>landing</b> for aeroplanes, and as a result aircraft can now land at ZSA after official sunset (with local civil aviation permission).|$|R
25|$|Because of the above, St Helena Airport was {{equipped}} with an <b>instrument</b> <b>landing</b> system (ILS) and a Doppler VHF Omni-directional Radio Range system (DVOR) supplied by Thales Group. Further to that Honeywell Aerospace supplied a SmartPath ground-based augmentation system (GBAS), a technology that augments global positioning system (GPS) signals to make them suitable for precision approach and landing. It overcomes many {{of the limitations of}} <b>instrument</b> <b>landing</b> systems (ILS) traditionally used by airports to guide aircraft as they approach the runway.|$|E

40|$|Aquarius is a {{spaceborne}} {{instrument that}} uses L-band radiometers to monitor sea surface salinity globally. Other applications of its data over {{land and the}} cryosphere are being developed. Combining its measurements with existing and upcoming L-band sensors will allow for long term studies. For that purpose, the radiometers calibration is critical. Aquarius measurements are currently calibrated over the oceans. They have been found too cold {{at the low end}} (celestial sky) of the brightness temperature scale, and too warm at the warm end (land and ice). We assess the impact of the antenna pattern model on the biases and propose a correction. We re-calibrate Aquarius measurements using the corrected antenna pattern and measurements over the Sky and oceans. The performances of the new calibration are evaluated using measurements over well <b>instrument</b> <b>land</b> sites...|$|R
25|$|The <b>instrument</b> <b>landing</b> system (ILS) for runway 21 was {{upgraded}} to category III in 2008, which allows landings in very low visibility conditions. Amsterdam Airport Schiphol {{is the only}} other airport in the Netherlands that has category III ILS.|$|E
25|$|In 1961 {{an airport}} traffic control tower was built and the main runway was {{extended}} from 3,900 feet to 5,300. In 1963 an <b>instrument</b> <b>landing</b> system was installed to help during poor weather. In 1977 the runway was further lengthened to 6,500 feet.|$|E
25|$|The <b>instrument</b> <b>landing</b> system's {{vertical}} guidance (glide slope) on runway 28L {{was out of}} service, as scheduled, beginning on June 1 (and a Notice To Airmen (NOTAM) to that effect had been issued); therefore, a Precision ILS approach to this runway was not possible.|$|E
50|$|The video, {{directed}} by Phil Harder, shows the band in {{a remake of}} the Apollo 11 moon mission and incorporates heavy use of NASA stock footage. They experience zero-gravity in the space capsule (where they conduct experiments and perform the song with <b>instruments),</b> <b>land</b> on the moon, plant a Foo Fighters flag, and return to Earth where they are welcomed back as heroes during a ticker-tape parade. Many moments and images of the Apollo era are re-enacted, such as the band meeting President Richard Nixon, bassist Nate Mendel golfing on the moon (a nod to Alan Shepard during Apollo 14), and depictions of Vietnam war protests. The video ends with {{a portrait of the}} band in the style of a traditional astronaut crew photo. This bears a strong resemblance to the cover of Led Zeppelin's Best of Led Zeppelin compilation.|$|R
