40|$|We {{study the}} {{connections}} between the sun's convection zone {{and the evolution of}} the solar wind and corona. We let the magnetic fields generated by a 2. 5 D axisymmetric kinematic dynamo code (STELEM) evolve in a 2. 5 D axisymmetric coronal isothermal MHD code (DIP). The computations cover an 11 year activity cycle. The solar wind's asymptotic velocity varies in latitude and in time in good agreement with the available observations. The magnetic polarity reversal happens at different paces at different coronal <b>heights.</b> <b>Overall</b> sun's mass loss rate, momentum flux and magnetic braking torque vary considerably throughout the cycle. This cyclic modulation is determined by the latitudinal distribution of the sources of open flux and solar wind and the geometry of the Alfvén surface. Wind sources and braking torque application zones also vary accordingly...|$|R
