40|$|Los auteurs remercient le docteur V. ARAÑA de l'Institut Lucas Mallada (C. S. I. C.) la lecture {{critique}} du manuscrit. Le docteur F. DIMANCHE de l'Université de Liége a réalisé la traduction en français du travail. Tertiary dacites and rhyodacites in SE Spain contain <b>garnets,</b> both as phenocrysts in the lavas {{and within}} their enclosed metamorphic xenoliths. Microprobe analyses show that calc-alkaline and metamorphic rocks <b>garnets</b> are quite similar in composition (almandine-rich). However, the zoning patterns {{displayed in the}} two types of <b>garnets</b> differ. <b>Garnets</b> included in lavas show normal zoning (or a slight enrichment of Mn at the borders), while <b>garnets</b> in xenoliths have Mn-enriched rims or reverse zoning. The differences in zonation, as well as in petrographic features, indicate that the <b>garnets</b> in volcanic rocks crystallized directly from the calc-alkaline magma at an early stage of its crystallization. On the other hand, the uniform composition of dacitic and rhyodacitic <b>garnets,</b> as well as its low pyrope and grossular content, suggest that the conditions in which the <b>garnets</b> crystallized were rapidly exceeded.

40|$|This work {{presents}} a geochemical {{study of a}} set of <b>garnets,</b> selected by their colors, from the CamafucaCamazambo kimberlite, located on northeast Angola. Mantle-derived <b>garnets</b> were classified according to the scheme proposed by Grütter et al. (2004) and belong to the G 1, G 4, G 9 and G 10 groups. Both sub-calcic (G 10) and Ca-saturated (G 9) <b>garnets,</b> typical, respectively, of harzburgites and lherzolites, were identified. The solubility limit of knorringite molecule in G 10 D <b>garnets</b> suggests they have crystallized at a minimum pressure of about 40 to 45 kbar (4 – 4. 5 GPa). The occurrence of diamond stability field <b>garnets</b> (G 10 D) is a clear indicator of the potential of this kimberlite for diamond.

40|$|The mineral {{chemistry}} of melanite <b>garnets</b> from the Crowsnest volcanic rocks of SW Alberta, Canada, {{has been investigated}} by using electron microprobe scans, quantitative analyses and multivariate statistical analysis. The <b>garnets</b> occur with aegirine-augite, sanidine, analcite and rare plagioclase as phenocrysts in trachyte and phonolite flows, agglomerates and tuffs. Wavelength dispersive microprobe scans reveal complex zonation patterns, both normal and oscillatory. The results of fifty quantitative analyses were subjected to R-mode factor analysis to delineate the chemical exchanges producing the zonation. The chemical zonation of the <b>garnets</b> {{may be attributed to}} four independent binary exchanges; Al-Fe 3 +, Si-Ti, Ca-Mn and Mg-Fe 2 +. The stoichiometry of these <b>garnets,</b> based on microprobe and wet chemical Fe analyses, combined with the strongly antithetic behavior of Si and Ti lead us to infer that the Ti in these <b>garnets</b> is dominantly tetravalent.

The principal properties of interest are formula volume, heat capacity, entropy, and formation enthalpy (from which the Gibbs free energy may be obtained), and isothermal compressibility. We also establish additive single-ion values for trivalent lanthanide cations which may be applied in estimating properties for related materials.
