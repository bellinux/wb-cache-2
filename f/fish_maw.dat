50|$|In some Asian cultures, {{the swim}} {{bladders}} of certain large fishes {{are considered a}} food delicacy. In China they are known as <b>fish</b> <b>maw,</b> 花膠/鱼鳔, and are served in soups or stews.|$|E
50|$|Poon Choi {{includes}} ingredients such as pork, beef, lamb, chicken, duck, abalone, ginseng, shark fin, <b>fish</b> <b>maw,</b> prawn, crab, dried mushroom, fishballs, squid, dried eel, dried shrimp, pigskin, {{bean curd}} and Chinese white radish.|$|E
50|$|The soup or stew {{consists}} of many ingredients, especially animal products, and requires {{one to two}} full days to prepare. A typical recipe requires many ingredients including quail eggs, bamboo shoots, scallops, sea cucumber, abalone, shark fin, <b>fish</b> <b>maw,</b> chicken, Jinhua ham, pork tendon, ginseng, mushrooms, and taro. Some recipes require up to thirty main ingredients and twelve condiments. Use of shark fin, which is sometimes harvested by shark finning, and abalone, which is implicated in destructive fishing practices, are controversial for both environmental and ethical reasons.|$|E
5|$|The presidency's fishing {{industry}} thrived, with Shark's fins, <b>fish</b> <b>maws</b> and <b>fish</b> curing-operations the {{main sources of}} income for fishermen. The southern port of Tuticorin was a centre of conch-fishing but Madras, along with Ceylon, was mainly known for its pearl fisheries. Pearl fisheries were harvested by the Paravas and was a lucrative profession.|$|R
40|$|Traditional fishery {{by-products}} such as fish meal, {{fish liver}} oil, shark fins and <b>fish</b> <b>maws</b> are produced commercially in India for domestic consumption and for export. However, an organized attempt to mo-dernize {{the industry and}} to vary the products utilizing the cheap varieties of fish (prawn by-catch) and other fish waste is required. The present status of this diversification is reviewed...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} during July, 2003 to June, 2013 about landing volumes of shark fishery (sharks and rays) in artisanal and industrial fishing sector only in group- wise not in species wise. In these periods, in artisanal fisheries gill nets (shark nets), set bag nets, long lines and trammel nets exploiting data were analyzed. But from 2012 - 13 periods in industrial fisheries harvesting data of sharks and rays by trawl fishing were started to record keeping in group wise. During 2012 - 13 total sharks and rays landing volume contributes only 0. 85 % (5017 MT) of total the marine fish production of Bangladesh. During 2010 - 11 to 2012 - 13 no sharks and rays product items had been traded from Bangladesh due to international market ban But from 2003 - 04 to 2009 - 10 period sharks and rays product with <b>fish</b> <b>maws</b> export to the Myanmar, India, Singapore, Thailand, Hong Kong, China, USA and other countries. Dried and iced sliced meat of shark and rays, its sun-dried hide, bones, fins, tails, teeth and shark liver oil all are sold for local consumers, but only sets of fins (2 pectoral, 2 pelvic, 1 dorsal, 2 anal and 1 caudal fin) and skins were exporting to the foreign markets, which has been stopped now. In the year 2009 - 10 total 955 MT of sharks and rays product (with <b>fish</b> <b>maws)</b> were exporting and earning (app.) USD 1. 60 million. For the conservation and management of shark fishery need National Plan of Action, which exploiting in the MSY and help to banning of critically endangered sharks and rays species. Appropriate law in the Fish Act (at present Fish Act has no forms of restriction for harvesting sharks, while Forestry Act restricts it in Sundarbans area) for sustainable harvesting and conservation of the elasmobranchs. Such law should include how many boats (motorized- and non-motorized) and industrial trawlers could be allowed to harvest sharks from which area, in which season and the allowable limit of harvests; in every case proper ways of fishing methods should strictly be followed. Coastal areas around Saint Martin’s Island and Sundarbans proposed by the Bay of Bengal should be declared as Marine Protected Area as most sharks use these areas as their nursing grounds...|$|R
5000|$|The swim bladder, gas bladder, <b>fish</b> <b>maw</b> or {{air bladder}} is an {{internal}} gas-filled organ {{that contributes to}} the ability of many bony fish (but not cartilaginous fish) to control their buoyancy, and thus to stay at their current water depth without having to waste energy in swimming. [...] Also, the dorsal position of the swim bladder means the center of mass is below the center of volume, allowing it to act as a stabilizing agent. Additionally, the swim bladder functions as a resonating chamber, to produce or receive sound.|$|E

Various {{traditional}} Foochow dishes such as Red Rice Wine Vermicelli, [...] "Kompiang" [...] or [...] "Kong Piang" [...] (traditional Foochow buns made with a type of unleavened flatbread stuffed with seasoned pork and baked in a clay oven), as well as [...] "Goroow" [...] (a thick sweet and sour broth cooked with <b>fish</b> <b>maw)</b> are served in Sitiawan restaurants and households alike. Traditional local produce such as red rice wine, and Foochow vermicelli continue to play a vital part in the livelihood of some families from Kampung Koh.Kampong Koh Sauce (M) Sdn Bhd makes one of the finest and widely liked chilly sauces.|$|E
5000|$|Typical snake soup recipe {{calls for}} at least two types of snakes whose flesh is {{shredded}} into thread-like wires, boiled with chicken, pork bone, lean meat, <b>fish</b> <b>maw,</b> fungus, ginger, lemon leaves and other spices for flavour. The mixture is stewed for over six hours to turn into a thick soup, seasoned with salt pepper and dark soy to taste. Most importantly, a thickener, typically corn starch or water caltrop paste, is added, making it a thick soup ("羹") with a transparent appearance, rather than broth ("湯"). More elaborate snake soup preparations involve additional ingredients such as pork chops, and herbs and spices, including star anise.|$|E

40|$|Fish maws (dried swimbladders of fishes) are {{regarded}} as traditional luxurious delicacies, medicine and tonics, which have been recommended and consumed in Asia over many centuries. At the commercial level, they are ranked as different values based on species. However, <b>fish</b> <b>maw</b> species and the trade are still unknown and undocumented. The processing treatments make them difficult for species identification based on morphological characterization. In the present study, the genetic identification of the main commercialized species of fish maws has been carried out, based on the amplification of a fragment of mitochondrial 16 S rRNA gene and subsequent BLAST analysis. The applicability {{of all kinds of}} processed. products was verified, including dried, water soaked; salt fried and salt fried plus water soaked forms. The result indicated this method was applicable to all of them, showed that 53. 3 % of the products were incorrectly labeled and 58. 3 % of "croaker" products were substituted with catfish or perch species. Moreover, results indicated that besides traditional trade in Asia, the <b>fish</b> <b>maw</b> trade has been globally expanded to meet the growing demand of market. Therefore, this method can be useful in normative control of processed products, particularly in the authenticity of imported species, verifying the correct traceability in commercial trade, the correct labeling, and also for fisheries control of endangered species to conserve stocks biodiversity.
