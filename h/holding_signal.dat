30|$|A TA signal {{does not}} always mean taking actions; for instance, a buy signal for the stock {{which is in the}} {{portfolio}} does not necessarily imply increasing its share in the portfolio. In fact, a buy signal means that the stock price will increase in the future, and it is recommended to have the stock; thus, if the stock trader has the stock, the TA processor implies keeping of it. This is similar for a sell signal that recommends not keeping the stock and selling it completely. As a matter of fact, if the investor does not have the stock, a selling signal implies to do nothing. Hence, t uninterrupted buy (sell) signals tell the investor to (not to) have the stock in his/her portfolio for the t-day period. Lastly, a <b>hold</b> <b>signal</b> means there will be no considerable change in the price of the stock in the future.|$|R

In this {{paper we propose a}} novel approach to improve the random pattern testability of sequential circuits. We introduce the concept of <b>holding</b> <b>signals</b> at primary inputs and scan flip-flops for a certain length of time instead of applying a new random vector at each clock cycle. When a random vector is held at the primary inputs of the circuit under test or at the scan flip-flops, the system clock is applied and the primary outputs of the circuit are observed. The number of clock cycles, k, for which each random input is held at a fixed value, before applying the next random vector, is determined by using testability analysis or a test pattern generator for {{a very small number of}} lines or faults in the circuit. The lines or faults that are analyzed are the primary inputs to flip-flops. The information obtained from the testabili [...] ...|$|R

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract The neutral lipids diacylglycerols (DAGs) {{are involved in}} a plethora of metabolic pathways. They func-tion as components of cellular membranes, as building blocks for glycero(phospho) lipids, and as lipid second messengers. Considering their central role in multiple metabolic processes and signaling pathways, cellular DAG levels require a tight regulation to ensure a constant and controlled availability. Interestingly, DAG species are versatile in their chemical structure. Besides the different fatty acid species esterified to the glycerol backbone, DAGs can occur in three different stereo/regioisoforms, each with unique biological properties. Recent scientific advances have revealed that DAG metabolizing enzymes generate and distinguish different DAG isoforms, and that only one DAG isoform <b>holds</b> <b>signaling</b> properties. Herein, we review the current knowledge of DAG stereochemistry and their impact on cellular metabolism and signaling. Further, we describe intracellular DAG turnover and its stereochemistry in a 3 -pool model to illustrate the spatial and stereochemical separation and hereby the diversity of cellular DAG metabolism...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The timing-mismatch/jitter {{effects in}} time-inter-leaved (TI) {{systems have been}} {{traditionally}} characterized by digital spectra analysis of nonuniformly sampled signals; however, {{the nature of that}} output with sample-and-hold (SH) effects has not yet been well established. This paper will present a complete analysis of signal spectra for general TI systems with practical nonuniformly holding outputs imposed by timing-jitter effects. The analysis reveals first the extra spectra representation for different forms of nonuniformly <b>holding</b> <b>signals</b> and then their closed-form expressions of signal-to-noise-and-distortion-ratio (SINAD), {{in terms of the number}} of channels, signal frequency, and jitter errors. Such analysis describes both the timing mis-matches imposed by random clock-jitter and fixed periodic clock-skew. MATLAB simulation results confirm the accuracy of the derived formula. Finally, such timing effects and the effectiveness of the formula will be demonstrated through the comparison of calculated and simulated results, as well as in some examples of measured data also, obtained from several practical integrated circuit (IC) applications, including a very high-speed data converter, analog front-end (AFE) filtering and an IF sampled-data radio filter.

METHODS: One hundred seven subjects without venous sinus abnormality were studied. Coronal 2 D PC MR venography and axial 2 D PC images with peripheral pulse gating were acquired with a 1. 5 -T MR unit, during regular breathing and deep inspiratory breath <b>holding.</b> The <b>signal</b> intensity changes of bilateral sigmoid sinuses on MR venograms and the changes of flow velocity and direction on the axial 2 D PC images were analyzed.

40|$|The {{reinforcement}} omission effect (ROE) {{has been}} attributed to both motivational and attentional consequences of surprising reinforcement omission. Recent evidence suggests that the basolateral complex of the amygdala is involved in motivational components related to reinforcement value, whereas the central nucleus of the amygdala is involved in the processing of the attentional consequences of surprise. This study was designed to verify whether the mechanisms involved in the ROE depend on the integrity of either the basolateral amygdala complex or central nucleus of the amygdala. The ROE was evaluated in rats with lesions of either the central nucleus or basolateral complex of the amygdala and trained on a fixed-interval schedule procedure (Experiment 1) and fixed-interval with limited <b>hold</b> <b>signaled</b> schedule procedure (Experiment 2). The results of Experiment 1 showed that sham-operated rats and rats with lesions of either the central nucleus or basolateral area displayed the ROE. In contrast, in Experiment 2, subjects with lesions of the central nucleus or basolateral complex of the amygdala exhibited a smaller ROE compared with sham-operated subjects. Thus, the effects of selective lesions of amygdala subregions on the ROE in rats depended on the training procedure. Furthermore, the absence of differences between the lesioned groups in either experiment did not allow the dissociation of attentional or motivational components of the ROE with functions of specific areas of th...|$|R
