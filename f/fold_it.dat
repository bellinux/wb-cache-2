5|$|On 30 January 2006, NBN {{adopted a}} new logo and on air graphics, {{in line with}} Nine's new logo. However, the news {{department}} did not update its graphics until 15 March. During April 2007, SP Telemedia {{announced that it would}} consider selling NBN Television, and had received at least two bids, one each from WIN Corporation and PBL Media. On 9 May 2007, PBL Media's (now Nine Entertainment Co.) A$250 million bid became final, winning the sale. However, upon acquiring NBN, PBL did not <b>fold</b> <b>it</b> into the main Nine Network, but continued to operate it as a regional station. The purchase also secured permanent status of supplying Nine's content to the station's entire coverage area, sparing any future affiliation switches (particularly the 2016 Australian television shakeup involving Southern Cross Austereo and WIN Corporation).|$|E
5|$|Peter then {{returned}} to Constantinople with letters from Theodahad and the Roman Senate to the imperial couple, bearing pleas for a peaceful solution, {{but by the time}} he reached the imperial capital, Emperor Justinian had resolved on war and was preparing his forces. Consequently, Peter returned to Italy in the summer of 535 conveying an ultimatum: only if Theodahad abdicated and returned Italy to imperial rule, could war be averted. A two-pronged Byzantine offensive followed soon thereafter, attacking the outlying possessions of the Ostrogothic kingdom: Belisarius took Sicily, while Mundus invaded Dalmatia. Upon hearing these news, Theodahad despaired, and Peter was able to secure wide-ranging concessions from him: Sicily was to be ceded to the Byzantine Empire; the Gothic king's authority within Italy was severely restricted; a gold crown was to be sent as an annual tribute and up to 3,000 men were to be provided for the imperial army, underlining Theodahad's subject status. Theodahad, however, fearing that his first offer would be rejected, then instructed Peter, under oath, to offer the cession of all Italy, but only if the original concessions were rejected by Justinian. In the event, Justinian rejected the first proposal, and was delighted to learn of the second one. Peter was sent back to Italy with Athanasius, bearing letters to Theodahad and the Gothic nobles, and for a time it seemed as if the cradle of the Roman Empire would return peacefully to the <b>fold.</b> <b>It</b> was not to be: upon their arrival in Ravenna, the Byzantine envoys found Theodahad in a changed disposition. Supported by the Gothic nobility and buoyed up by a success against Mundus in Dalmatia, he resolved to resist, and imprisoned the ambassadors.|$|E
25|$|This {{arrangement}} {{lasted until}} 1980, when 7th SIB was re-organized into a formation consisting of Guardsmen only. The Commando units were moved elsewhere, and 7th SIR {{returned to the}} <b>fold.</b> <b>It</b> was renamed 3rd Battalion, Singapore Guards.|$|E

25|$|This {{pattern in}} turn {{suggests}} the following method of creating models of iterations of the Heighway dragon curve by folding {{a strip of}} paper. Take a strip of paper and <b>fold</b> <b>it</b> in half to the right. <b>Fold</b> <b>it</b> in half again to the right. If the strip was opened out now, unbending each fold to become a 90 degree turn, the turn sequence would be RRL i.e. the second iteration of the Heighway dragon. Fold the strip in half again to the right, and the turn sequence of the unfolded strip is now RRLRRLL – the third iteration of the Heighway dragon. Continuing folding the strip in half {{to the right to}} create further iterations of the Heighway dragon (in practice, the strip becomes too thick to fold sharply after four or five iterations).|$|E
25|$|The axis of {{symmetry}} of a two-dimensional figure is a line such that, if a perpendicular is constructed, any two points lying on the perpendicular at equal distances from the {{axis of symmetry}} are identical. Another {{way to think about}} it is that if the shape were to be folded in half over the axis, the two halves would be identical: the two halves are each other's mirror image. Thus a square has four axes of symmetry, because there are four different ways to <b>fold</b> <b>it</b> and have the edges all match. A circle has infinitely many axes of symmetry passing through its center, for the same reason.|$|E
500|$|The {{author of}} The Sena Story, Vaibhav Purandare, said Raj resorted to this measure to stem his party's eroding credibility. He said, [...] "When Raj {{launched}} his party, he first {{started out with}} an inclusive approach. When he found {{that it is not}} working, he had to do something drastic {{to get back into the}} limelight. On the other hand, the Sena was actually becoming inclusive. It even began attracting Muslims into its <b>fold.</b> <b>It</b> also began taking up the common man's issues like farmer suicides and power supply. This is Raj's attempt to take the Sena's mass base away to completely embarrass the Sena. And he has succeeded." [...] Both Ketkar and Purandare, however, agreed that Raj was trying to position himself as Bal Thackeray's potential successor.|$|E

500|$|Sheila gives Berger {{a yellow}} shirt. He goofs around {{and ends up}} tearing it in two. [...] Sheila voices her {{distress}} that Berger seems to care more about the [...] "bleeding crowd" [...] than about her ("Easy to Be Hard"). [...] Jeanie summarizes everyone's romantic entanglements: [...] "I'm hung up on Claude, Sheila's hung up on Berger, Berger is hung up everywhere. Claude is hung up on a cross over Sheila and Berger." [...] The tribe runs out to the audience with fliers inviting them to a Be-In. [...] Berger, Woof and another tribe member pay satiric tribute to the American flag as they <b>fold</b> <b>it</b> ("Don't Put it Down"). [...] After young and innocent Crissy describes [...] "Frank Mills", a boy she's looking for, the tribe participates in the [...] "Be-In". [...] The men of the tribe burn their draft cards. [...] Claude puts his card in the fire, then changes his mind and pulls it out. [...] He asks, [...] "where is the something, where is the someone, that tells me why I live and die?" [...] ("Where Do I Go"). [...] The tribe emerges naked, intoning [...] "beads, flowers, freedom, happiness." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wilson was not {{by nature}} an {{intolerant}} man, nor were his sympathies {{limited to the}} Anglican <b>fold.</b> <b>It</b> is said that Cardinal Fleury wrote to him, [...] "as they were the two oldest bishops", and, he believed, [...] "the poorest in Europe" [...] invited him to France. [...] He was so pleased with Wilson's reply that he got an order prohibiting French privateers from ravaging the Isle of Man. Roman Catholics [...] "not unfrequently attended" [...] his services. He allowed dissenters to sit or stand at the communion and not being compelled to kneel, they did so. The Quakers loved and respected him.|$|E
2500|$|In late 1916, Sopwith, whose earlier 1½ Strutter {{had proved}} {{successful}} {{as a light}} bomber, (particularly when operated as a single seater), designed a new, single-engined bomber aircraft. The new bomber was developed in parallel with the Cuckoo carrier based torpedo bomber and closely resembled the Cuckoo. It, like the Cuckoo, was a compact tractor biplane, powered by a 200hp (149kW) Hispano-Suiza water-cooled engine. Unlike the Cuckoo, the bomber's two-bay wings did not <b>fold.</b> <b>It</b> {{was designed as a}} single-seat aircraft, with the pilot sitting in a cockpit under the wing centre section to give a good view forwards and downwards for bombing. [...] The aircraft bombload of up to 560lb (255kg) was carried vertically within the fuselage, in cells behind the pilot.|$|E

2500|$|Tim Evans, a Director of Elections Systems and Policy of the AEC, {{wrote in}} 2006 that [...] "It {{is not the}} case, as some people have claimed, {{that it is only}} {{compulsory}} to attend the polling place and have your name marked off and this has been upheld by a number of legal decisions." [...] Yet, practically, it remains the fact that having received a ballot paper, the elector can simply <b>fold</b> <b>it</b> up and put it into the ballot box without formally marking it, if he or she objects, in principle, to casting a vote. However, the consistently low number of informal votes each election indicates that having attended, had his or her name marked off, very few electors then choose not to vote formally.|$|E
2500|$|In 1995, the parapsychologist David Fontana {{proposed}} {{in an article}} that poltergeists could haunt tape recorders. He speculated that this may have happened to the parapsychologist Maurice Grosse who investigated the Enfield Poltergeist case. However, Tom Flynn a media expert for the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry examined Fontana's article and suggested an entirely naturalistic explanation for the phenomena. According to the skeptical investigator Joe Nickell [...] "Occasionally, especially with older tape and under humid conditions, as the tape travels it can adhere {{to one of the}} guide posts. When this happens on a deck where both supply and take-up spindles are powered, the tape continues to feed, creating a <b>fold.</b> <b>It</b> was such a loop of tape, Flynn theorizes, that threaded its way amid the works of Grosse’s recorder." ...|$|E
2500|$|Though {{the league}} {{had a few}} successes, the league had {{significant}} problems gaining acceptance in the American sports community. The 17 teams included only 30 North American players. The expenses of high salaries for foreign players and renting of large stadiums, coupled with low attendances, resulted in every team losing money in 1968, and investors quickly pulled the plug after their year's commitment ended. [...] At {{the end of the}} year, CBS pulled its TV contract, and all but five of the teams folded.The league moved its offices to a basement in Atlanta's stadium, {{and at the end of}} the eight game 1969 season, the league declared Kansas City the league champions without a playoff, and the Baltimore Bays announced they would <b>fold.</b> <b>It</b> appeared top-tier professional soccer would not survive in North America.|$|E

2500|$|At the December 15, 1971, taping of The Dick Cavett Show, with Janet Flanner and Gore Vidal, [...] Mailer, {{annoyed with}} a less-than-stellar review by Vidal of Prisoner of Sex, {{apparently}} headbutted Vidal and traded insults with him backstage. As the show began taping, a visibly belligerent Mailer, who admitted {{he had been}} drinking, goaded Vidal and Cavett into trading insults with him on air and continually referred to his [...] "greater intellect". He openly taunted and mocked Vidal (who responded in kind), finally earning the ire of Flanner, who announced during the discussion that she was [...] "becoming very, very bored", telling Mailer [...] "You act as if you're the only people here." [...] As Cavett made jokes comparing Mailer's intellect to his ego, Mailer stated [...] "Why don't {{you look at your}} question sheet and ask your question?", to which Cavett responded [...] "Why don't you <b>fold</b> <b>it</b> five ways and put it where the moon don't shine?" [...] A long laugh ensued, after which Mailer asked Cavett if he had come up with that line and Cavett replied [...] "I have to tell you a quote from Tolstoy?". The headbutting and later on-air altercation was described by Mailer himself in his essay [...] "Of a Small and Modest Malignancy, Wicked and Bristling with Dots".|$|E
2500|$|B.O.A.T.S. II: Me Time {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 67, based on 16 reviews. Jordan Sargent of Spin said, [...] "B.O.A.T.S. II ups the production values {{like a true}} sequel should. Whereas his last album felt at times like a mixtape in expensive packaging, the beats here are full and gleaming with the fruits of success." [...] Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone said [...] "his second LP further displays his knack for playfully hollering about money like he's the first guy who ever had so much paper he couldn't <b>fold</b> <b>it.</b> He tries on some new looks here but nothing slows down the self-described Black Unicorn's scene-chewing charisma." [...] At USA Today, Elysa Garnder evoked that [...] "2 Chainz wraps his gritty flow in bright, crisp arrangements. And he's not afraid to wax lyrical now and then, notably on the pining, lushly orchestrated [...] "Black Unicorn"." [...] Dan Rys of XXL stated, [...] "while the album is billed as the continuation of his first record, last year’s No. 1-debuting Based on a T.R.U. Story, Chainz also branches out a bit {{in a way that}} makes the album feel like he’s bringing at least some new records to the table while remaining stylistically consistent." [...] Kevin Ritchie of Now said, [...] "Sonically, B.O.A.T.S. II is slightly more adventurous than its predecessor thanks to Pharrell’s funky summer jam [...] "Feds Watching" [...] and the EDM-influenced [...] "Netflix", a Diplo-Fergie tag team. 2 Chainz likes to offset the raunchy with the heartfelt, but when the tone shifts to earnestly autobiographical, he sounds derivative." [...] Paul Cantor of Vibe stated, [...] "B.O.A.T.S. II: Me Time really does what it set out to do—prove that 2 Chainz, while occasionally unfocused, is more than a guy who just makes trap music. Make no mistake, there’s a lot of that here, and he’s almost got that formula down to science." ...|$|E
