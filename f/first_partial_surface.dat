The appearance of electrostatic potential, which {{is caused by the}} imbalance of positive and negative ions, was measured by the high impedance electrostatic voltmeter. The result from these <b>partial</b> <b>surfaces</b> was compared with the standard test method which is using the 6 ″× 6 ″ charged plate. The average voltages of all segments of the <b>partial</b> <b>surfaces</b> are correlated to the electrostatic potential values which were measured by the standard 6 ″× 6 ″ charged plate. Moreover, the <b>partial</b> <b>surfaces</b> offer the fine-grained level of results. It validates that the precision of the ion balance measurement can be improved by the <b>partial</b> <b>surfaces...</b>|$|R

40|$|An {{approach}} is proposed for <b>partial</b> <b>surface</b> reconstruction from point cloud using RBF. Traditionally RBF based shape approximation method {{is used for}} entire object, but in many applications only partial part of the points needs to be reconstructed. Our method <b>first</b> transforms the <b>partial</b> point cloud with PCA, then generates off-surface points by plane fitting for the local neighborhood of each point. The implicit surface is generated with constructed RBF while the surface edge is constrained by checking whether the marching cube is within the points' range, and octree-based subdivision {{is also used to}} speed the procedure. The proposed approach can reconstruct <b>partial</b> <b>surface</b> with constrained edge in much less computational time, and its efficiency is tested with experiments on different point clouds...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} novel {{approach}} to reconstruct complete 3 D deformable models over time by a single depth camera, provided that {{most parts of the}} models are observed by the camera at least once. The core of this algorithm {{is based on the assumption}} that the deformation is continuous and predictable in a short temporal interval. While the camera can only capture part of a whole surface at any time instant, <b>partial</b> <b>surfaces</b> reconstructed from different times are assembled together to form a complete 3 D surface for each time instant, even when the shape is under severe deformation. A mesh warping algorithm based on linear mesh deformation is used to align different <b>partial</b> <b>surfaces.</b> A volumetric method is then used to combine <b>partial</b> <b>surfaces,</b> fix missing holes, and smooth alignment errors. Our experiment shows that this approach is able to reconstruct visually plausible 3 D surface deformation results with a single camera. 1...|$|R

The partial slip is applied on the stationary surface, the moving surface, and both of them.

Controlling the <b>partial</b> slip <b>surface</b> of the stationary surface can give many advanced properties compared with the traditional no-slip contact, i. e., a large fluid load support in combination with low friction coefficient.

40|$|Surface {{acquisition}} {{deals with}} the reconstruction of three dimensional objects from a set of data points. The most straightforward techniques require human intervention, a time consuming proposition. It is desirable to develop a fully automated alternative. Such a method is proposed in this paper. It makes use of surface measurements obtained from a 3 -D laser digitizer - an instrument which provides the (x,y,z) coordinates of surface data points from various viewpoints. These points are assembled into several <b>partial</b> <b>surfaces</b> using a visibility constraint and a 2 -D triangulation technique. Reconstruction of the final object requires merging these <b>partial</b> <b>surfaces.</b> This is accomplished through a procedure that emulates milling, a standard machining operation.

40|$|Textured surface {{models of}} {{three-dimensional}} objects are gaining importance in computer graphics applications. These models {{often have to}} be merged from several overlapping partial models which have to be registered (i. e. the relative transformation between the partial models has to be determined) prior to the merging process. In this paper a method is presented that makes use of both camera-based depth information (e. g. from stereo) and the luminance image. The luminance information is exploited to determine corresponding point sets on the <b>partial</b> <b>surfaces</b> using an optical flow approach. Quaternions are then employed to determine the transformation between the partial models which minimizes {{the sum of the}} 3 -D Euclidian distances between the corresponding point sets.

The cooling water required to prevent surface and core body temperatures of the hen from escalating was expressed in terms of water spray interval (SI 10, min) at a constant spray dosage (10 mL hen– 1) and evaporation rate (ER, mL min– 1) of the sprayed water. The thermal conditions used in this study consisted of air velocity (V) of 0. 2 to 1. 2 m s– 1 in combination with air vapor pressure deficit (VPDair) of 2. 1 to 5. 3 kPa that corresponds to dry–bulb temperature (tdb) of 35 ³C to 41 ³C and dew–point temperature (tdp) of 21 ³C to 27 ³C.
