Klein. Knott recorded over 10 tackles in five games while Klein achieved that feat four times. <b>Iowa</b> <b>State</b> was expected to get both safety Durrell Givens and defensive back Jansen Watson back from injury for the game. The remainder of the Cyclone secondary was rounded out by senior Jeremy Reeves and junior Jacques Washington.

50|$|Nebraska {{traveled}} to Ames {{for their first}} appearance on <b>Iowa</b> <b>State's</b> new Clyde Williams Field, and made relatively easy work of the Cyclones on their own turf, recording another shutout victory on the year. To <b>Iowa</b> <b>State's</b> credit, however, the 21 Cornhusker points would be the lowest points scored against any opponent in 1915 except for Notre Dame. <b>Iowa</b> <b>State's</b> chances {{to catch up to}} Nebraska in the series were beginning to look bleak, as the Cornhuskers held a dominant lead at 11-3-1.|$|R

5|$|The pre-game buildup was {{primarily}} {{focused on the}} rematch. A slight plurality of experts picked Tulsa over <b>Iowa</b> <b>State,</b> but most predicted the game to be very close. Tulsa was considered a strong running team with a solid defense, while <b>Iowa</b> <b>State</b> was balanced offensively and struggled at times on defense. This was the only rematch of the 2012-13 college bowl season.|$|E
50|$|Nebraska held <b>Iowa</b> <b>State's</b> star {{receiver}} to two catches for 11 yards, and the Cyclones offense to just five first downs, as the Blackshirts posted their first shutout in two years.

5|$|Because White did {{not officially}} depart Minnesota {{until the middle}} of his second semester, he was academically ineligible to receive a {{scholarship}} from any Division I school in 2010.

He transferred to <b>Iowa</b> <b>State</b> prior to using any of his athletic eligibility at Minnesota and applied to the NCAA for a waiver to be eligible to play during the 2010–11 NCAA Division I men's basketball season, but the NCAA denied his waiver. <b>Iowa</b> <b>State</b> appealed the decision, but their appeal was denied.|$|E

5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1895, Warner was asked for a {{reference}} to fill the vacant head coaching position at <b>Iowa</b> <b>State</b> University, in Ames, Iowa. Instead of giving a reference, Warner himself applied for the job and received an offer for $25 (approximately $670 in 2016) a week. At the same time, he decided to apply to other schools and received an offer of $34 (approximately $915 in 2016) per week from the University of Georgia in Athens, Georgia. Because <b>Iowa</b> <b>State</b> began its season in Augustalmost {{one and a half}} months prior to the beginning in Georgia, Warner was able to work out a deal. For $150 (Approximately $4,000 in 2016), he would coach in Iowa from August until the second week of September; and then head to Georgia and begin coaching there.|$|E
5|$|<b>Iowa</b> <b>State</b> {{has played}} in 1,140 games during its 120 seasons. In those seasons, four coaches have led the Cyclones to postseason bowl games: Johnny Majors, Earle Bruce, Dan McCarney, and Paul Rhoads. One coach, Clyde Williams, has won a conference {{championship}} with the Cyclones. McCarney is the all-time leader in games coached (141), years coached (11) and wins (56), while Bert German is the all-time leader in winning percentage (.833). W. P. Finney is, in terms of winning percentage, the worst coach {{in the history of}} the <b>Iowa</b> <b>State</b> football program having never won a game.|$|E
5|$|On 17 May 1947, the AEC {{awarded the}} {{contract}} to run the Ames Laboratory, which now had {{the status of a}} national laboratory, to <b>Iowa</b> <b>State</b> College. The laboratory remained on the <b>Iowa</b> <b>State</b> College campus, and its faculty and graduate students made up most the staff. Spedding remained its director until he retired in 1968. Administration was delegated to the IAR. Permanent buildings were constructed that were opened in 1948 and 1950, and subsequently named Wilhelm Hall and Spedding Hall. The Ames Laboratory retained a focus on chemistry and metallurgy, particularly of the rare-earth metals.|$|E

5|$|After Georgia's {{outstanding}} 1896 performance, Warner {{returned to}} his alma mater Cornell at twice his Georgia salary. While remaining head coach at <b>Iowa</b> <b>State,</b> he coached Cornell to records of 5–3–1 in 1897 and 10–2 in 1898; in the latter season, Cornell outscored its opponents 296–29. Despite its 1898 success, tension existed within the team, as its assistant coach (backed by {{a large proportion of}} the players) lobbied to replace Warner. Acknowledging an issue with his leadership, Warner resigned.|$|E
5|$|After he {{declined}} offers {{to pursue a}} professional playing career, Ward coached the game for 22years. Most of that time was spent as an assistant coach, and he served in that capacity at Maryland from 1952 to 1957, Oklahoma from 1957 to 1958, <b>Iowa</b> <b>State</b> from 1958 to 1965, and Army in 1966. At the United States Military Academy, Ward enjoyed the strictly regimented environment, and the players appreciated his aggressiveness.|$|E
