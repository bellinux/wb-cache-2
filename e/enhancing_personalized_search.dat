However, effective <b>personalized</b> <b>search</b> requires collecting and aggregating user information, which often raise serious concerns of privacy infringement for many users. Indeed, these concerns have {{become one of the}} main barriers for deploying <b>personalized</b> <b>search</b> applications, and how to do privacy-preserving personalization is a great challenge. In this paper, we systematically examine the issue of privacy preservation in <b>personalized</b> <b>search.</b> We distinguish and define four levels of privacy protection, and analyze various software architectures for <b>personalized</b> <b>search.</b> We show that client-side personalization has advantages over the existing server-side <b>personalized</b> <b>search</b> services in preserving privacy, and envision possible future strategies to fully protect user privacy. ...|$|R

Search engines respond to a user’s query by using the bag-of-words model, which matches keyword between the query and web documents but ignore contexts and users’ preferences. <b>Personalized</b> <b>search</b> greatly improves the search results as of the results provided by the search engine without personalization. In this paper, the performance of <b>personalized</b> <b>search</b> based on content analysis and <b>personalized</b> <b>search</b> based on user group have been evaluated. In <b>personalized</b> <b>search</b> based on content analysis the contents are traced by finding the user’s browsed documents and search history, which reduce the users search time.

Research has indicated low success rates among major search engines in providing relevant results; in 52% of 20,000 queries, searchers did not find any relevant results within the documents that Google returned. <b>Personalized</b> <b>search</b> can improve search quality significantly and there are mainly two ways to achieve this goal.|$|R
40|$|Although <b>personalized</b> <b>search</b> {{has been}} {{proposed}} {{for many years and}} many personalization strategies have been investigated, it is still unclear whether personalization is consistently effective on different queries for different users, and under different search contexts. In this paper, we study this problem and provide some preliminary conclusions. We present a large-scale evaluation framework for <b>personalized</b> <b>search</b> based on query logs, and then evaluate five <b>personalized</b> <b>search</b> strategies (including two click-based and three profile-based ones) using 12 -day MSN query logs. By analyzing the results, we reveal that <b>personalized</b> <b>search</b> has significant improvement over common web search on some queries but it has little effect on other queries (e. g., queries with small click entropy). It even harms search accuracy under some situations. Furthermore, we show that straightforward click-based personalization strategies perform consistently and considerably well, while profile-based ones are unstable in our experiments. We also reveal that both longterm and short-term contexts are very important in improving search performance for profile-based <b>personalized</b> <b>search</b> strategies...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>Personalized</b> <b>search</b> has {{recently}} got significant {{attention in the}} web search. Accordingly, user’s intention of search is very important information to retrieval information in aspect of <b>personalized</b> <b>Search.</b> Although many <b>personalized</b> <b>search</b> and strategies have been proposed, the majority of web users are difficulty in retrieval information corresponding their search intention. In this paper, we present <b>personalized</b> <b>search</b> based on User Intention through the HPVM(Hierarchical Phrase Vector Model) to solve these problems using and machine learning methodology. Users can navigate through the prior user’s intention by their own needs. This is especially useful for various meaning and poor queries. By analyzing the results, {{we find out that}} there is an unique representation of user intention under different queries, contexts and users. Furthermore, we can find out that this knowledge is very important in improving personalized information retrieval performance by filtering the results, recommending a new query, and distinguishing user’s characteristics. With this approach, search engines can provide more predictive information for Web searchers. Based on this approach, we developed a <b>personalized</b> <b>search</b> engine, HPS (Hierarchical Phrase Search) ...|$|R

50|$|Search engines such as Google and Yahoo! utilize <b>personalized</b> <b>search</b> {{to attract}} {{possible}} customers to products that fit their presumed desires. Based {{on a large}} amount of collected data aggregated from an individual's web clicks, search engines can use <b>personalized</b> <b>search</b> to put advertisements that may pique the interest of an individual. Utilizing <b>personalized</b> <b>search</b> can help consumers find what they want faster, as well as help match up products and services to individuals within more specialized and/or niche markets. Many of these products or services that are sold via personalized online results would struggle to sell in brick-and-mortar stores. These types of products and services are called long tail items. Using <b>personalized</b> <b>search</b> allows faster product and service discoveries for consumers, and reduces the amount of necessary advertisement money spent to reach those consumers. In addition, utilizing <b>personalized</b> <b>search</b> can help companies determine which individuals should be offered online coupon codes to their products and/or services. By tracking if an individual has perused their website, considered purchasing an item, or has previously made a purchase a company can post advertisements on other websites to reach that particular consumer in an attempt to have them make a purchase.|$|R

50|$|There {{are several}} {{publicly}} available systems for <b>personalizing</b> Web <b>search</b> results (e.g., Google <b>Personalized</b> <b>Search</b> and Bing's search result personalization). However, the technical details and evaluations of these commercial systems are proprietary. One technique Google uses to <b>personalize</b> <b>searches</b> for its users is to track log {{in time and}} if the user has enabled web history in his browser. If a user accesses the same site through a search result from Google many times, it believes that they like that page. So when users carry out certain <b>searches,</b> Google's <b>personalized</b> <b>search</b> algorithm gives the page a boost, moving it up through the ranks. Even if a user is signed out, Google may personalize their results because it keeps a 180-day record of what a particular web browser has searched for, linked to a cookie in that browser.|$|R

It is realized that similarity measure of the users profile is not the sufficient criterion for identifying the trusted users profile who are good in generating the effective <b>personalized</b> <b>search</b> results. One of the Research done in <b>Personalized</b> Web <b>Search</b> in [10] in which clustered user query sessions are used for generating the <b>personalized</b> web <b>search</b> results for the current user using the similarity measure alone. However the method proved to be effective but the use of similarity measure alone could not help in determining how good the clustered user profiles are in generating the reliable recommendations for effective <b>personalized</b> web <b>search.</b> In this paper an algorithm is proposed in which trust is introduced in <b>personalized</b> web <b>search</b> based on clustered query session for which trust metric is defined for clustered user sessions which measure the goodness of the clusters of query sessions in making the reliable recommendations for effective <b>personalized</b> web <b>search</b> and furthermore trust is not static but updated dynamically depending on the response of the user to the <b>personalized</b> <b>search</b> results generated by the selected trusted cluster. The proposed algorithm uses both the trust metric and the similarity measure for selecting the trusted cluster which is similar to the information need of the current user for the personalization of the web search effectively.

40|$|As {{the volume}} and breadth of online {{information}} is rapidly increasing, ad hoc search systems become less and less efficient to answer information needs of modern users. To support the growing complexity of search tasks, researchers {{in the field of}} information developed and explored a range of approaches that extend the traditional ad hoc retrieval paradigm. Among these approaches, <b>personalized</b> <b>search</b> systems and exploratory search systems attracted many followers. <b>Personalized</b> <b>search</b> explored the power of artificial intelligence techniques to provide tailored search results according to different user interests, contexts, and tasks. In contrast, exploratory search capitalized on the power of human intelligence by providing users with more powerful interfaces to support the search process. As these approaches are not contradictory, we believe that they can re-enforce each other. We argue that the effectiveness of <b>personalized</b> <b>search</b> systems may be increased by allowing users to interact with the system and learn/investigate the problem in order to reach the final goal. We also suggest that an interactive visualization approach could offer a good ground to combine the strong sides of <b>personalized</b> and exploratory <b>search</b> approaches. This paper proposes a specific way to integrate interactive visualization and <b>personalized</b> <b>search</b> and introduces an adaptive visualization based search system Adaptive VIBE that implements it. We tested the effectiveness of Adaptive VIBE and investigated its strengths and weaknesses by conducting a full-scale user study. The results show that Adaptive VIBE can improve the precision and the productivity of the <b>personalized</b> <b>search</b> system while helping users to discover more diverse sets of information. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
