40|$|Objectives: This work {{aimed to}} {{elucidate}} {{the role of}} electroosmosis during trans-nail iontophoresis. Methods: Passive and iontophoretic experiments were performed after short hydration (10 - 15 min) of human nail tips. The electroosmotic fluxes of mannitol were determined during anodal and cathodal iontophoresis and at different pH values. Passive controls were also carried out. Four sets of experiments were performed: (a) three anodal delivery experiments using different nails, at pH 4. 0, 5. 0 and 7. 4, (b) one anodal delivery experiment that kept the same nails across two pH stages, (c) one experiment, comprising an anodal <b>delivery</b> <b>stage</b> (pH 4 and 7. 4) followed by a cathodal <b>delivery</b> <b>stage</b> (pH 7. 4 and 4), which kept the same nails across the different polarities and pH stages, and (d) a passive experiment keeping the same nails across different pH values (4 and 7. 4). Results: The fluxes of mannitol measured were very variable and little difference between passive and electroosmotic transport was observed. Cathodal and anodal fluxes were not always significantly different. Experiments which minimised internail variability suggested that the nails were negatively charged at physiological pH, and that this negative charge was lost at pH 4. Conclusions: These results suggest a modest and highly variable contribution of electroosmosis to the iontophoretic transungual flux...|$|E

40|$|In the {{automotive}} segment, quality and reliability {{can no longer}} distinguish a premium vehicle from other automotive brands. Therefore premium manufacturers must compete on the perceived quality that a product exhibits, known as craftsmanship.

Also with more complex design and manufacturing processes being outsourced to the supply base, the relationship between suppliers and the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) is critical to craftsmanship definition and execution. This paper focuses upon how conformance to craftsmanship design can be achieved through the introduction of a common product audit methodology throughout the supply base.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{constructability}} uses integration art of individual functions through a valuable and timely construction inputs into {{planning and design}} development stages. It results in significant savings in cost and time needed to finalize infrastructure projects. However, available constructability principles, developed by CII Australia (1993), do not cover Operation and Maintenance (O&M) phases of projects, whilst major cost and time in multifaceted infrastructure projects are spent in post-occupancy stages. This paper discusses the need to extend the constructability concept by examining current O&M issues {{in the provision of}} multifaceted building projects. It highlights available O&M problems and shortcomings of building projects, as well as their causes and reasons in different categories. This initial categorization is an efficient start point for testing probable present O&M issues in various cases of complex infrastructure building projects. This preliminary categorization serve as a benchmark to develop an extended constructability model that considers the whole project life cycle phases rather than a specific phase.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Construction projects experience design changes and much time and effort is put into trying to address fluctuations in client and project requirements; however, in many cases, insufficient value is delivered to the client. The successful use of Lean Management in the construction stage has opened up {{the possibility of using}} it in the design stage – thus helping to establish a systematic approach to managing construction projects and business. Attention is turning towards Lean Design Management to address deficiencies in the design phases that many would argue should have been dealt with in the early project <b>delivery</b> <b>stages.</b> Aspects of ineffective briefing process practice have been shown to have negative consequences and implications for the efficient performance of design management. The client is asked to provide requirements without ensuring that they have established sufficient knowledge of the project to do so. These requirements, most likely, will change then over time, because in most cases the initial decision was not made based on sufficient project knowledge or a well-established vision. The client needs to be made smarter and to learn about the building early on in the project, long before the architect sketches the concept design. [Continues. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of vaccines in transgenic plants was first proposed in 1990 however no product has yet reached commercialization. There are several risks during {{the production and}} <b>delivery</b> <b>stages</b> of this technology, with potential {{impact on the environment}} and on human health. Risks to the environment include gene transfer and exposure to antigens or selectable marker proteins. Risks to human health include oral tolerance, allergenicity, inconsistent dosage, worker exposure and unintended exposure to antigens or selectable marker proteins in the food chain. These risks are controllable through appropriate regulatory measures at all stages of production and distribution of a potential plant-made vaccine. Successful use of this technology is highly dependant on stewardship and active risk management by the developers of this technology, and through quality standards for production, which will be set by regulatory agencies. Regulatory agencies can also negatively affect the future viability of this technology by requiring that all risks must be controlled, or by applying conventional regulations which are overly cumbersome for a plant production and oral delivery system. The value of new or replacement vaccines produced in plant cells and delivered orally must be considered alongside the probability and severity of potential risks in their pro-duction and use, and the cost of not deploying this technology – the risk of continuing with the status quo alternative...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{wireless}} sensor networks (WSNs) {{have attracted}} significant attentions from both academia and industry, and are widely proposed for {{a broad range of}} applications, where data collection is often a core service to facilitate sensed data being forwarded to a central base station for further processing. Powered by batteries and using wireless communications, a WSN is more flexible than its wired counterpart. However, wireless losses/collisions may be prevalent when nodes communicate with each other. Moreover, the lifetime of a WSN largely depends on that of individual nodes, which is further constrained by the generally non-replenishable batteries. Energy-efficiency thus becomes a critical concern that must be addressed. In practice, using WSNs for data collection can be broken into three major stages, namely, deployment, message dissemination and data delivery. The deployment stage focuses on best deploying the network in the sensing field. In the message dissemination stage, network setup/management and/or collection command messages are disseminated from the base station to all sensor nodes, where the challenges lie in how to disseminate messages with low transmission costs and latencies in the presence of error-prone wireless communications. The data <b>delivery</b> <b>stage</b> fulfills the main task of data collection. Based on the information indicated by the message dissemination stage, sensed data are gathered at different nodes and delivered to the base station, with application-specified Quality-of-Service requirements to be fulfilled. In this thesis, we tackle the design issues for each of these stages. For the deployment stage, we propose to use relay nodes for traffic relaying and suggest that the deployment {{should be aware of the}} data traffic to be collected by specific applications. We then discuss how to efficiently disseminate message in a low duty-cycle scenario, where nodes alternate between active and dormant states to conserve energy and thus extend the network lifetime. To address the traffic accumulation problem, particularly in the data <b>delivery</b> <b>stage,</b> we take a case study on high-rise structure monitoring application and propose to use elevators to facilitate data collection.
