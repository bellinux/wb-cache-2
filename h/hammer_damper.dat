40|$|AbstractEstimating damping in {{structure}} composed of different materials (steel, brass, aluminum) and processes still remains {{as one of the}} most extremely vast challengers. The paper presents Structural damping effect on beam vibration by impact <b>hammer.</b> Structural <b>damping</b> contributes to about 10 - 15 % of total system damping. The main objective of this work is to estimate the natural frequency and damping ratio of cantilever beams of Aluminum, Brass, and Steel by LabVIEW software and validate the result with vibration analysis and Harmonic analysis utilizing ANSYS. Free vibration analysis was carried out for identifying the natural frequencies and the harmonic analysis was carried out for obtaining frequency replication curves from which damping ratios were estimated utilizing Half- power Band Width Method. It is observed that damping ratio is higher for brass than steel than aluminum...|$|R
50|$|The Yamaha CP-300 has 88 {{graduated}} weighted keys. This {{means that}} the keys are somewhat heavier on the low end than the high. It has onboard stereo speakers, {{as well as an}} output for PA usage. Yamaha digitally sampled in stereo each key at multiple attack intensities to obtain the tonal quality, presence, <b>hammer</b> and <b>damper</b> noises of an acoustic piano. The harpsichord (including pick noise), pipe organ, and other sampled instruments in main instrument set were also sampled. The extended instrument set of over a hundred instruments are generated, rather than sampled. The MIDI interface can control other instruments or be controlled. It also has onboard digital recording and editing capabilities. Like other stage pianos, it is built for touring. Despite its age, the CP-300 remains a very serviceable instrument - particularly when extended through software sound patches.|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} a new device (PCD) for {{prevention}} of water hammer due to fast valve closure in liquid filled pipe systems is developed. Investigations on {{the influence of}} the steady state initial velocity and pressure of the medium in the pipe, the valve closing time and check valves on water and cavitational hammer as well as investigations concerning the performance and the operational reliability of a PCD are made by the use of modern measurement technology. The theoretical part of this thesis contains simulations, which are concerned with the fast valve closure in liquids carrying pipelines with and without a PCD, taking fundamental operating conditions into account. Furthermore, a new code for the computing of water <b>hammer</b> <b>damping</b> with a PCD is developed, which uses the implicit Euler-Method for numerical solution. The new code is embedded as a dynamic boundary condition "shut-off valve" into thesimulation procedure. It is shown that the pressuretime course during the fast closure of single, liquid filled pipe systems is estimated well {{with the help of a}} PCD. Therefore, the new model is suitable for the design of a PCD in order to prevent unacceptable water hammer in piping systems. Several operating conditions can be analysed and compared cost-efficiently. Because of that particularly suitable operating conditions can be determined with the help of the new model. The new device distinguishes from common methods for prevention of water hammer, like surge tanks and air chambers, by omitting direct contact of the medium with gases (i. e. air). In contrast to air chambers and bladder accumulators, the PCD is not liable to the German "Druckbeh√§lterverordnung" Due to its compact design it can be easily implemented in already existing plants. Collector and separator systems, required when using safety valves and rupture discs, are not necessary. A significant improvementtowards common positioner devices lies in its closed control loop. As a consequence, good damping can be achieved even at different steady state initial velocities of the medium...|$|R
40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{analysis for}} the dynamic performance characteristics of laminar flow, capillar/orifice compensated hydrostatic journal bearings is presented. The analysis considers in detail the effect of fluid compressibility in the bearing recesses. At high frequency excitations beyond a break frequency, the bearing hydrostatic stiffness increases sharply and it {{is accompanied by a}} rapid decrease in direct damping. Also, the potential of pneumatic <b>hammer</b> instability (negative <b>damping)</b> at low frequencies is likely to occur in hydrostatic bearing applications handling highly compressible fluids. Useful design criteria to avoid undesirable dynamic operating conditions at low and high frequencies are determined. The effect of fluid recess compressibility is brought into perspective, and found to be of utmost importance on the entire frequency spectrum response and stability characteristics of hydrostatic/hybrid journal bearings...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a stable ceramic stand {{in order to support}} high-precision BPMs: beam position monitors and focusing elements along the SCSS X-ray FEL accelerator. The support is made of a cordierite material that has a very low thermal-expansion coefficient of ~ 2 x 10 - 6 / 0 K. The inside of the stand is filled with sand to increase the inertia by sand weight and to increase its vibration damping by friction among its grains. By employing the above-mentioned devices, the stand provides lower mechanical vibration amplification. In this paper, we describe the stability of the cordierite stand. For example, the vibration amplification was evaluated by a comparison between earth background vibration data measured with seismometers set on the stand and the floor. The low-frequency components below 0. 1 Hz of the data include amplification dependent on the thermal expansion of the stand. The effect of vibration damping was compared between the cordierite and a stainless-steel stand. The impulse responses for the comparison between them were measured by vibration generated with a <b>hammer.</b> The <b>damping</b> time of the cordierite stand was about one hundred-times lower than that of the stainless-steel stand. The responses of the stands to strong vibration were also measured by using a shaker having a rotating eccentric mass on the stands. In each case of the above-mentioned measurements, the cordierite stand had smaller vibration amplification and bigger damping than those of the stainless-steel stand. 1...|$|R
40|$|Two {{independent}} principles {{could potentially}} govern integration {{of information in}} the perception of a sound source. First, higher perceptual weights should be given to acoustical parameters that specify accurately and unambiguously a sound source property. Second, lower perceptual weights should be given to acoustical parameters related to less perceptually accessible information (e. g., impaired discrimination). The relevance of these principles to source perception was investigated. Hardness perception was investigated for the two objects whose interaction generates an impact sound: a highly <b>damped</b> <b>hammer</b> and a freely vibrating sounding object. Acoustical analyses identified unambiguous and relatively accurate acoustical specifiers of the impacted sound source. A first experiment assessed the ability of a listener to learn to discriminate hammer or sounding object hardness, providing a measure of the perceptual accessibility of the two source properties. A second experiment investigated hardness estimation in trained and untrained listeners, providing quantification of the relative perceptual relevance of the informational sources. A final experiment conducted on simulated sound sources further characterized weighting profiles in untrained listeners, decorrelating otherwise covarying source properties. Results concerning both mechanical and acoustical correlates suggest a relevance of both principles...|$|R
6000|$|This washhandstand {{had been}} made of deal by some one with an excess of turnery {{appliances}} in a hurry, who had tried to distract attention from the rough economies of his workmanship by an arresting ornamentation of blobs and bulbs upon the joints and legs. Apparently the piece had then been placed in the hands of some person of infinite leisure equipped with a pot of ocherous paint, varnish, and a set of flexible combs. This person had first painted the article, then, I fancy, smeared it with varnish, and then sat down to work with the combs to streak and comb the varnish into a weird imitation of the grain of some nightmare timber. The washhandstand so made had evidently had a prolonged career of violent use, had been chipped, kicked, splintered, punched, stained, scorched, <b>hammered,</b> dessicated, <b>damped,</b> and defiled, had met indeed with almost every possible adventure except a conflagration or a scrubbing, until at last it had come to this high refuge of Parload's attic to sustain the simple requirements of Parload's personal cleanliness. There were, in chief, a basin and a jug of water and a slop-pail of tin, and, further, a piece of yellow soap in a tray, a tooth-brush, a rat-tailed shaving brush, one huckaback towel, and one or two other minor articles. In those days only very prosperous people had more than such an equipage, and it is to be remarked that every drop of water Parload used had to be carried by an unfortunate servant girl,--the [...] "slavey," [...] Parload called her--up from the basement {{to the top of the}} house and subsequently down again. Already we begin to forget how modern an invention is personal cleanliness. It is a fact that Parload had never stripped for a swim in his life; never had a simultaneous bath all over his body since his childhood. Not one in fifty of us did in the days of which I am telling you.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the problem of the wall shear stress during rapid {{transient}} 1 D flows in a piping system caused by water hammers in two-phase flow induced by a fast valve closure. The evolution of the transient wall shear stress is interpreted in terms of two steps. The first step is a sudden and dramatic change of the wall shear stress due to the passage of the pressure wave. The second step is a relaxation process of the shear stress which is modeled from the Extended Irreversible Thermodynamics theory. The friction relaxation model (FRM) presented {{in the first part of}} this paper describes both steps of the evolution of the wall shear stress during water hammers. The second part of the paper {{deals with the}} application of the FRM model as a closure law in the WAHA code. The main purpose of the WAHA code is to predict various situations relative to single- and two-phase water hammer transients in piping systems. The last part of the paper deals with the simulation of several cases from the UMSICHT databank using the adapted WAHA computer code with the FRM model. The results of these simulations are systematically compared with the experimental data. It is concluded that the new FRM model has a clear effect on water <b>hammer</b> pressure wave <b>damping</b> and on the pressure wave propagation velocity. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Simple {{viscoelastic}} dampers {{have been}} invented {{for use on}} the root attachments of turbomachine blades. These dampers suppress bending- and torsion-mode blade vibrations, which are excited by unsteady aerodynamic forces during operation. In suppressing vibrations, these dampers reduce fatigue (thereby prolonging blade lifetimes) while reducing noise. These dampers can be installed in new turbomachines or in previously constructed turbomachines, without need for structural modifications. Moreover, because these dampers are not exposed to flows, they do not affect the aerodynamic performances of turbomachines. Figure 1 depicts a basic turbomachine rotor, which includes multiple blades affixed to a hub by means of dovetail root attachments. Prior to mounting of the blades, thin layers of a viscoelastic material are applied to selected areas of the blade roots. Once the blades have been installed in the hub and the rotor is set into rotation, centrifugal force compresses these layers between the mating load-bearing surfaces of the hub and the blade root. The layers of viscoelastic material provide load paths through which the vibration energy of the blade can be dissipated. The viscoelasticity of the material converts mechanical vibration energy into shear strain energy and then from shear strain energy to heat. Of the viscoelastic materials that have been considered thus far for this application, the one of choice is a commercial polyurethane that is available in tape form, coated on one side with an adhesive that facilitates bonding to blade roots. The thickness of the tape can be chosen to suit the specific application. The typical thickness of 0. 012 in. (. 0. 3 mm) is small enough that the tape can fit in the clearance between the mating blade-root and hub surfaces in a typical turbomachine. In an experiment, a blade was mounted in a test fixture designed to simulate the blade-end conditions that prevail in a turbocompressor. Vibrations were excited in the blade by use of an impact <b>hammer,</b> and <b>damping</b> of the vibrations was measured by use of a dynamic signal analyzer. Tests were performed without and with viscoelastic dampers installed in the dovetail root attachment. The results of the measurements, {{some of which are}} presented in Figure 2, show that the viscoelastic dampers greatly increased the rate of damping of vibrations. Accordingly, dynamic stresses on rotor blades were significantly reduced, as shown in Figure 2...|$|R
40|$|Wave {{equation}} analysis programs (WEAP) such as GRLWEAP and TNOWave {{were primarily}} developed for pre-driving analysis. They {{can also be}} used for post-driving measurement applications with some refinements. In the case of pre-driving analysis, the programs are used for the purpose of selecting the right equipment for a given ground condition and controlling stresses during pile driving processes. Recently, the program is increasingly used for the post-driving measurement application, where an assessment based on a variety of input parameters such as hammer, driving system and dynamic behaviour of soil is carried out. The process of this type of analysis is quite simple and it is performed by matching accurately known parameters, such as from CAPWAP analysis, to the parameters used in GRLWEAP analysis. The parameters that are refined in the typical analysis are pile stresses, <b>hammer</b> energy, capacity, <b>damping</b> and quakes. Matching of these known quantities by adjusting hammer, cushion and soil parameters in the wave equation program results in blow counts or sets and stresses for other hammer energies and capacities and cushion configuration. The result of this analysis is output on a Bearing Graph that establishes a relationship between ultimate capacity and net set per blow. A further application of this refinement method {{can be applied to the}} assessment of dynamic formulae, which are extensively used in pile capacity calculation during pile driving process. In this paper, WEAP analysis is carried out to establish the relationship between the ultimate capacities and sets using the various parameters and using this relationship to recalibrate the dynamic formula. The results of this analysis presented show that some of the shortcoming of the dynamic formula can be overcome and the results can be improved by the introduction of a correction factor...|$|R
