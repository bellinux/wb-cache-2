40|$|Background: In {{the context}} of {{evidence-based}} management of historic collections, a damage function combines aspects of material degradation, use, and consideration of material attributes that are important for satisfactory extraction of benefits from user interaction with heritage. In libraries and archives, {{it has been shown}} that users (readers and visitors) are mainly concerned with loss of textual information, which could lead to degradation being described as unacceptable, at which an object might become unfit for use and therefore damaged. The contribution explores the development of the damage function for historic paper based on data available in the literature. Results: We have modelled the dose–response function taking into account 121 paper degradation experiments with known T, RH of the environment, and pH of paper. The function is based on the Arrhenius equation and published water absorption isotherm functions for paper. New isoperm plots have been calculated and isochrones have been developed. These are plots linking points of equal expected ‘lifetime’, i. e. time until an object is expected to reach the state of threshold fitness-for-use. We also modelled <b>demographic</b> <b>curves</b> for a well-characterised research collection of historic papers, exploring the loss of fitness for use with time. Conclusions: The new tools enable us to evaluate scenarios of management of the storage environment as well as levels of access, for different types of library and archival paper. In addition, the costs and benefits of conservation interventions can be evaluated. The limitations of the function are {{the context of}} use (dark storage and reading), exclusive focus on the properties of an average paper type, and de-prioritised effect of pollutants; however, the latter can be considered separately. This work also demonstrates that transparent and publically accountable collection management decisions can be informed, and challenged by, effective interaction with a variety of stakeholders including the lay public...|$|R

40|$|Surveillance for {{influenza}} deaths {{has been}} used to gauge the severity of influenza seasons. Traditional surveillance, which relies on medical records review and laboratory testing, might not be sustainable during a pandemic. We examined whether electronic death certificates might provide a surveillance alternative.

Electronic death certificate surveillance provided timely information, matched the <b>demographics</b> and epidemiologic <b>curve</b> of that obtained from traditional influenza-related death surveillance, and had a moderately positive predictive value. However, risk factors were underreported on death certificates. Because surveillance by electronic death certificates does not require obtaining and reviewing medical records, it requires fewer resources and is less burdensome on public health staff...|$|R

40|$|Background context As {{in other}} fields of medicine, there is an {{increasing}} interest among orthopedic surgeons to measure health-related {{quality of life in}} adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients and to evaluate the burden of disease and the effectiveness of different treatment strategies. The development of the revised Scoliosis Research Society 22 -item patient questionnaire (SRS- 22 r) enabled a comprehensive evaluation of health-related quality of life of these patients. Over the years, the SRS- 22 r gained wide acceptance and has been used in several different countries, languages, and cultures. The SRS- 22 r has not been translated into Dutch to date. Purpose To translate the SRS- 22 r into Dutch and adapt it cross-culturally as outlined by international guidelines and to test its psychometric properties to measure health-related quality of life of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients in the Netherlands. Study design/setting A cross-sectional, multicenter validation study. Patient sample A total of 135 adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients (mean age 15. 1 years old) of three major scoliosis centers in the Netherlands were enrolled in this study. Ninety-two (68 %) subjects completed the Dutch SRS- 22 r, Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ) -CF 87 (golden standard for adolescents), and Short Form (SF) - 36 (golden standard for adults). Two weeks later, 73 (79 %) of 92 respondents returned a second SRS- 22 r. <b>Demographics,</b> <b>curve</b> type, Risser stage, and treatment status were documented. Outcome measures Floor and ceiling effects, internal consistency, reproducibility, concurrent validity, and discriminative ability of the Dutch version of the SRS- 22 r questionnaire. Methods For content analysis, SRS- 22 r domain scores (function, pain, self-image, mental health, and satisfaction with management) were explored and floor and ceiling effects were determined. Cronbach's α was calculated for internal consistency of each domain of the questionnaires and reproducibility was assessed by test-retest reliability analysis. Using Pearson's correlation coefficient, comparison of the domains of the Dutch SRS- 22 r with the domains of the SF- 36 and Child Health Questionnaire-CF 87 assessed the concurrent validity. Differences in SRS- 22 r domain scores between untreated patients with different curve severity determined the discriminative ability of the questionnaire. Results The SRS- 22 r domains as well as the SF- 36 and CHQ-CF 87 domains demonstrated no floor effects, but the function, pain, and satisfaction with management domains had ceiling effects, indicating the proportion of subjects with the maximum score between 19. 6 % and 33. 0 %. Internal consistency was very satisfactory for all SRS- 22 r domains: Cronbach's α was between 0. 718 and 0. 852. By omitting question 15, {{the internal consistency of the}} function domain increased from 0. 746 to 0. 827. Test-retest reliability was ≥ 0. 799 for all SRS- 22 r domains. The function, pain, mental health, and self-image domains correlated under the 0. 001 significance level with the corresponding CHQ-CF 87 and SF- 36 domains. The satisfaction with management domain did not correlate with the other questionnaires. The SRS- 22 r had the ability to detect differences between groups with different curve severity; patients with a severe scoliotic curvature had significantly lower pain and self-image domain scores than patients with relatively mild scoliosis. Conclusions The Dutch SRS- 22 r had the properties needed for the measurement of patient perceived health-related quality of life of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients in the Netherlands. The Dutch SRS- 22 r could be used for the longitudinal follow-up of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients from adolescence to adulthood and for establishing the effects of conservative or invasive surgical treatment. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

A high value of H′ was manifested by: a) high species richness (S = 123), b) good equitability (70.6 %), c) ‘fair’ resource apportionment, and d) abundance of rare species (84 % species with less than one per cent of total individuals, 67 % species with two or less individuals ha− 1 and 59 % species with one or less individuals ha− 1). The compositional heterogeneity was ‘fair’ (Whittaker’s βw = 3.15). The presence of Fagaceae with six species commanding 4.3 % of importance value (IVI) and of a pine (P. kesiya) in sal forest was remarkable. As many as 58 species showed ‘low density (≤ 10 individuals ha− 1), uniform dispersion’, five species achieved ‘higher density (> 10 individuals ha− 1), uniform dispersion’ and six of the top 10 species were ‘clumped’. The forest showed an exponential <b>demographic</b> <b>curve</b> illustrating ‘good’ regeneration of an expanding community. Vertical stratification was simple with a poor canopy and fair subcanopy, which together with low basal area (15.65 m 2 · ha− 1 for individuals ≥ 10 cm gbh) indicated logging of mature sal trees in the past.|$|E
30|$|The ‘Khasi hill sal’ forest {{showed a}} healthy <b>demographic</b> <b>curve</b> with an {{exponential}} fit, illustrating ‘fair’ regeneration of an expanding community. Clearly, the forest community {{is able to}} maintain continual supply of juveniles (stems in 10 to[*]<[*] 30  cm girth size) to higher girth classes {{in a pool of}} species despite anthropogenic stresses in form of wood extraction, fire and grazing. However, the individuals in[*]<[*] 30  cm girth class were less than two-fold of those in 30 to[*]<[*] 60  cm girth class, indicating stressed regeneration. Evidently, 24 % (29) species were lacking regeneration as they were present in[*]≥[*] 30  cm girth class but not in[*]<[*] 30  cm girth class. All these species were rare: 27 species with one or less stems per hectare and two large trees (C. purpurella and Lithocarpus elegans) with[*]>[*] 1 but[*]<[*] 5 stems per hectare. The remaining 76 % (94) species were present in both[*]<[*]  30 and[*]≥[*]  30  cm girth classes and apparently regenerating well. Of these, 69 species were rare (with one or less stems per hectare) and 25 species with more than one stem per hectare were not so rare. In a pool of species, plenty of juveniles of some species could be compensating for the paucity of juveniles of other species and the species might be replacing each other temporarily in cyclic succession. These observations are in line with the classic ‘Mosaic Theory of Regeneration’ (Aubréville [1938]) developed from patterns in mixed tropical forests on the Ivory Coast (see Richards [1952]).|$|E
40|$|Background: Cancer is {{the second}} {{leading cause of death}} in the United States and a major {{contributor}} to healthcare expenditure. There are few studies examining disparities in treatment costs. Studies that do exist are dominated by the cost of hospital care. Methods: Utilizing Maryland Medicaid administrative claims data, a retrospective cohort, design was employed to examine disparities in ambulatory treatment costs of breast, colorectal and prostate cancer treatment by region, race and gender. We report mean and median results by each demographic category and test for the statistical signifi-cance of each. Lorenz curves are plotted and Gini coeffi-cients calculated for each type of cancer. Results: We do not find a consistent trend in ambulatory costs across the three cancers by traditional <b>demographic</b> variables. Lorenz <b>curves</b> indicate highly unequal distributions of costs. Gini coefficients are 0. 687 for breast cancer, 0. 757 for colorectal cancer and 0. 774 for prostate cancer. Conclusion: Significant variation in nonhospital-based expenditures exists for breast, colorectal and prostate can-cers in a population of homogeneous socioeconomic status and uniform insurance entitlement. Observed individual-lev-el disparities are not consistent across cancers by region, race or gender, but the majority of this low-income popula-tion receives very little ambulatory care.

40|$|This paper {{utilizes}} household-level budget {{data from}} the 1889 / 90 United States Commissioner of Labor survey to estimate the full Almost Ideal Demand System with demographic and other covariates. Price data {{were obtained from the}} Aldrich Report of 1892. The purpose is to make better use of the entire data set by incorporating demographic variation and then to examine whether the consumption patterns of immigrants and the native born were significantly different once the effects of total expenditure, prices, family composition, region of residence, industry, occupation, and age of household head were taken into account. Comparisons of Engel curves are also made to households in Great Britain and Germany. Results from estimation of Engel curves and the full model (with prices) for six commodity categories (food, housing, clothing, fuel and lighting, liquor and tobacco, and "Other" goods and services) revealed that differences across ethnic groups within the United States could be reduced but not eliminated by the effects of the covariates. The foreign born spent relatively more on food and on liquor and tobacco. Although differences by ethnicity existed, both British and German immigrants to the United States were closer in their consumption patterns to workers in the area of destination than in the area of origin. Inclusion of prices did reduce the regional effects (within the United States) found in the Engel <b>curves.</b> <b>Demographic</b> effects were important. Food, housing, and fuel and lighting appeared as necessities, while clothing, liquor and tobacco, and "Other" goods and services were luxuries. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Probabilistic {{reasoning}} under uncertainty suits well {{to analysis}} of disease dynamics. The stochastic nature of disease progression is modeled {{by applying the}} principles of Bayesian learning. Bayesian learning predicts the disease progression, including prevalence and incidence, for a geographic region and demographic composition. Public health resources, prioritized by the order of risk levels of the population, will efficiently minimize the disease spread and curtail the epidemic at the earliest. A Bayesian network representing the outbreak of influenza and pneumonia in a geographic region is ported to a newer region with different demographic composition. Upon analysis for the newer region, the corresponding prevalence of influenza and pneumonia among the different demographic subgroups is inferred for the newer region. Bayesian reasoning coupled with disease timeline is used to reverse engineer an influenza outbreak for a given geographic and demographic setting. The temporal flow of the epidemic among the different sections {{of the population is}} analyzed to identify the corresponding risk levels. In comparison to spread vaccination, prioritizing the limited vaccination resources to the higher risk groups results in relatively lower influenza prevalence. HIV incidence in Texas from 1989 - 2002 is analyzed using <b>demographic</b> based epidemic <b>curves.</b> Dynamic Bayesian networks are integrated with probability distributions of HIV surveillance data coupled with the census population data to estimate the proportion of HIV incidence among the different demographic subgroups. Demographic based risk analysis lends to observation of varied spectrum of HIV risk among the different demographic subgroups. A methodology using hidden Markov models is introduced that enables to investigate the impact of social behavioral interactions in the incidence and prevalence of infectious diseases. The methodology is presented in the context of simulated disease outbreak data for influenza. Probabilistic reasoning analysis enhances the understanding of disease progression in order to identify the critical points of surveillance, control and prevention. Public health resources, prioritized by the order of risk levels of the population, will efficiently minimize the disease spread and curtail the epidemic at the earliest...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{examines the}} development of Swiss school buildings during the 1950 s and 1960 s, including their architectural, pedagogical and social implications. The work focuses on buildings of compulsory education. Educational theories have, indeed, had {{a major impact on}} educational architecture, particularly buildings for primary and secondary schools. Following the great baby boom of the postwar period, school buildings acted as a stimulant for Swiss modern architecture, especially thanks to competitions which gave young architects the opportunity to develop and test new proposals. The great attention which modern architects dedicated to school buildings and educational issues was both pragmatic and ideological. Since modern architects were convinced that the new architecture needed a new human being, they assigned to school buildings an important formative role. Moreover, the paradigm promoted by the Neues Bauen - light, air, sun - was very close to the hygienist principles of the nineteenth century and to the new educational theories of the 1920 s. Swiss modern architects realised that the school building was a forceful medium to spread the culture and the form of modern architecture. Two deeply rooted beliefs, both ingrained parts of Helvetian self-awareness, are at the basis of the importance given to school buildings. On the one hand it is often stressed that Switzerland is a land of educationalists, starting with Rousseau and Pestalozzi, right down to the leading Swiss figures in modern pedagogy, such as Adolphe Ferrière, cofounder of the Bureau International d'Education in 1925. On the other hand it is seen as self-evident that the mission of education is to train the moral being even more than to instruct. «The moral man is the main goal of education» and «Aesthetic education is a necessary premise to moral education» Alfred Roth wrote in the last part of his trilingual book The New School, first published in 1950. Such a mission was to be entrusted to schools, and the school building would be its most tangible sign. The dissertation explores how the modern Swiss school, as a cultural and architectural form, emerged from a complex interaction of technical concerns, educational theory, and the larger social forces of the period. The research is organised according to three distinct but interrelated paths of investigation. Firstly, I study the relationship between school building and urban context; the evolution of the typology with respect to both technical and educational concerns; and the migration of ideas. Schools are strongly related to the evolution of urban theories and the debate on school building was linked to debates on the territory and its development, its economic growth and its <b>demographic</b> <b>curve.</b> The second path examines how architects, educators, and administrators created and disseminated an image of school bound to modern architectural forms and progressive methods of teaching, combined with a persistently romantic notion of childhood. The close relationships with other countries have always played an essential role in Swiss culture. The dissertation therefore applies international comparison, looking into the network of exchanges that Swiss architects secured {{with the rest of the}} world, in particular with the so called "creative periphery" - Denmark, Sweden and Finland - as well as with The United States and England in which the most progressive ideas on education and school buildings were being developed. The archival research has been conducted primarily at the gta Archiv of the ETH Zurich, looking into the main protagonists of the Swiss debate on modern school buildings, such as Werner M. Moser and Alfred Roth. The literature studies provide an accurate survey of period journals on education and architecture, paying particular attention to the many special issues dedicated to the subject of schools in this perio...|$|E
40|$|This is a {{prospective}} study to establish prediction models that map the refined Scoliosis Research Society 22 -item (SRS- 22 r) onto EuroQoL- 5 dimension 5 -level (EQ- 5 D- 5 L) utility scores in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) patients. Comparison of treatment outcomes in AIS {{can be determined}} by cost-utility analysis. However, the mainstay spine-specific health-related quality of life outcome measure, the SRS- 22 r questionnaire does not provide utility assessment. In this study, AIS patients were prospectively recruited to complete both the EQ- 5 D- 5 L and SRS- 22 r questionnaires by trained interviewers. Ordinary least squares regression was undertaken to develop mapping models, which the validity and robustness were assessed by using the 10 -fold cross-validation procedure. EQ- 5 D- 5 L utility scores were regressed on <b>demographics,</b> Cobb angle, <b>curve</b> types, treatment modalities, and five domains of the SRS- 22 r questionnaire. Three models were developed using stepwise selection method. EQ- 5 D- 5 L scores were regressed on 1) main effects of SRS- 22 r subscale scores, 2) as per 1 plus squared and interaction terms, and 3) as per 2 plus demographic and clinical characteristics. Model goodness-of-fit was assessed using R-square, adjusted R-square, and information criteria; whereas the predictive performance was evaluated using {{root mean square error}} (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and the proportion of absolute error within the threshold of 0. 05 and 0. 10. A total of 227 AIS patients with mean age of 15. 6 years were recruited. The EQ- 5 D- 5 L scores were predicted by four domains of SRS- 22 r (main effects of ‘Function’, ‘Pain’, ‘Appearance’ and ‘Mental Health’, and squared term of ‘Function’ and ‘Pain’), and Cobb angle in Model 3 with the best goodness-of-fit (R-square/adjusted R-square: 62. 1 %/ 60. 9 %). Three models demonstrated an acceptance predictive performance in error analysis applying 10 -fold cross-validation to three models where RMSE and MAE were between 0. 063 – 0. 065 and between 0. 039 – 0. 044, respectively. Model 3 was therefore recommended out of three mapping models established in this paper. To our knowledge, this is the first study to map a spine-specific health-related quality of life measure onto EQ- 5 D- 5 L for AIS patients. With the consideration and incorporation of demographic and clinical characteristics, over 60 % variance explained by mapping model 3 enabled the satisfactory prediction of EQ- 5 D- 5 L utility scores from existing SRS- 22 r data for health economic appraisal of different treatment options. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
