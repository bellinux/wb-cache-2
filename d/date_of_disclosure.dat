Methods Adults with CF participated in the survey via the United States national network of CF Centers. Descriptive and inferential statistics were utilized. Results Participants (n = 865) {{were more likely to}} disclose to relatives (94 %) and close friends (81 %) than to dating partners (73 %), bosses/supervisors/teachers (51 %) or co-workers (39 %).

40|$|A {{high and}} {{increasing}} proportion {{of people in}} the United Kingdom are living with a long-term condition (DH, 2005 a). The National Health Service is facing the challenge of increased pressure on its service provision. Government Policy has placed emphasis on supporting individuals to self-care (Department of Health, 2005 a, c). However, there are specific challenges associated with living with a long-term condition, and in particular the psychosocial aspects of illness when set alongside a clinical approach to care (Gabe et al, 2004, Bury et al, 2005) It has been argued that <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> illness may in itself be a self-care strategy (Munir et al, 2005). However, to <b>date</b> individuals‟ experiences <b>of</b> <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> long-term conditions are neither clearly defined nor its role in managing a long-term condition fully understood. The aims of the study were to explore the role <b>of</b> <b>disclosure</b> in the management of a long-term health condition. The study drew on constructivist grounded theory (Charmaz, 2006) undertaking thirty-five in-depth qualitative interviews (fifteen people living with epilepsy, and twenty people living with type 1 diabetes) recruited from patient support groups and clinical nurse specialist‟s clinics. This study identified that strategies <b>of</b> <b>disclosure</b> are not necessarily fixed but may be subject to change over time. “Learning about disclosure” {{is an integral part of}} living with a long-term condition. Three key disclosure roles were identified: (1) access to self-care and social support, (2) non-disclosure (concealment) of the condition to protect one‟s identity from stigma. (3) redressing myths about the condition in advance: to avoid perceived stigma. The findings provide important insights that could enable health care professionals to develop more of an emphasis on including disclosure as an issue when talking to patients about managing type 1 diabetes and epilepsy and this is also relevant to a broad spectrum of long-term conditions.

40|$|The first {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to analyse the level <b>of</b> <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> executive directors’ remuneration before and after introduction of the Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance in 2001, the changes in accounting standards FRS 2 ‘Share based payments’ in 2005 and FRS 124 ‘Related party disclosure’ in 2006 and the changes to the Bursa Malaysia Listing Rule. The study seeks to examine the effectiveness of these reforms in improving the level <b>of</b> <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> executive directors’ remuneration. The second objective is to fill the gaps in prior study by empirically testing the determinants of the level <b>of</b> <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> executive directors’ remuneration based on agency theory, legitimacy theory, signaling theory and proprietary costs. These theories are represented by several ownership variables, corporate governance variables and firm characteristics. Using an un-weighted disclosure index, this study scored the level <b>of</b> <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> executive directors’ remuneration of 200 publicly listed Malaysian companies over the period of 2000 to 2008. The period captured the revolving nature of the Malaysian regulatory framework on <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> executive directors’ remuneration. The disclosure index is based on prior studies and the regulatory framework. The dataset is in the form of a panel data and consisted of 1788 company-years. The study employed non-parametric tests and multivariate analysis to examine any significant changes in the level <b>of</b> <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> executive directors’ remuneration and the determinants of the level <b>of</b> <b>disclosure.</b> The results showed that there were significant improvements in the level <b>of</b> <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> executive directors’ remuneration after the reforms. However, Malaysian companies appeared to take advantage of weaknesses in the reforms to fall back on the practice of disclosing minimum of the mandatory requirements. A significant number of Malaysian companies continued not to disclose on their individual executive directors’ remuneration. The inconsistencies between the mandatory Listing Rule and the voluntary MCCG made it easier for companies not to do so. These implied that the ‘hybrid’ approach adopted by the regulators in implementing in the reforms was not sufficient in ensuring comprehensive <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> executive directors’ remuneration. Hypothesis tests on the determinants of the level <b>of</b> <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> executive directors’ remuneration found that traditional dominance by family shareholders was significant and limit the extent <b>of</b> <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> executive directors’ remuneration. Other agency players (regulators, foreign investors and creditors) roles appeared to be dwarfed by the presence of controlling family shareholders. However, government shareholdings alleviated to a certain extent, this dominance by significantly pushing for compliance with the reforms. Corporate governance mechanisms of independent directors and level of audit quality were shown to work differently in different disclosure environments in improving the level <b>of</b> <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> executive directors’ remuneration. The findings also supported the notions of legitimacy theory and signaling theory that company size, industry differences and profitability were significantly associated with the level <b>of</b> <b>disclosure.</b> This study also showed that contrary to expectations of proprietary costs, companies with higher growth were more likely to disclose the remuneration of individual executive directors.

40|$|<b>Disclosure</b> <b>of</b> {{sexual assault}} is a {{complicated}} process which depends upon a host of factors, such as assault characteristics, the victim’s interpretation, {{and the level of}} distress she experiences. Comprehensive theories of adult sexual assault disclosure have not been proposed. Most studies concentrate on a particular aspect <b>of</b> <b>disclosure,</b> such as outcomes <b>of</b> <b>disclosure</b> and reasons for disclosing versus not disclosing. A number of gaps exist in the current literature on adult sexual assault disclosure. These include the conceptualization <b>of</b> <b>disclosure</b> as a discrete or continuous variable; how it may evolve during stages of recovery; the progression <b>of</b> <b>disclosure</b> (e. g., observable patterns to disclosing); the potential variety of motivations for disclosing beyond help-seeking; and the role of culture (e. g., how one’s cultural and familial upbringing influences comfort and acceptance <b>of</b> <b>disclosure</b> as a viable option). The present study aimed to clarify and expand our previous knowledge about <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> sexual assault by investigating the overall process. A qualitative study, using a grounded theory approach, was conducted with a diverse sample of women who were sexually victimized after age 12. Findings from the study reveal the complex nature <b>of</b> <b>disclosure</b> and expand on previous conceptions of its process and behavioral manifestations, such as evidence supporting a disclosure continuum, a variety of motivations for disclosing and not disclosing, the roles of culture and parenting practices that may influence disclosure, and the interactive nature <b>of</b> <b>disclosure</b> and recovery. The results suggest that the <b>disclosure</b> process consists <b>of</b> the factors that contribute to whether a disclosure is made, the disclosure itself, and the aftereffects <b>of</b> the <b>disclosure,</b> a process which could be conceived as occurring in circular manner. Thus, decisions <b>of</b> <b>disclosure</b> appear to be very complex, and all of these factors potentially interact with one another and collectively influence whether a woman discloses and how much.
