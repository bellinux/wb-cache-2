40|$|In {{the absence}} of a vaccine, there is an urgent need for the {{development}} of safe and effective topical microbicides to prevent the sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1). In this study, we proposed to develop a novel class of microbicides using syndecan as the antiviral agent. Specifically, we generated a soluble syndecan-Fc <b>hybrid</b> <b>molecule</b> by fusing the ectodomain of syndecan- 1 to the Fc domain of a human IgG. We then tested the syndecan-Fc <b>hybrid</b> <b>molecule</b> for various in vitro microbicidal anti-HIV- 1 properties. Remarkably, the syndecan-Fc <b>hybrid</b> <b>molecule</b> possesses multiple attractive microbicidal properties: (i) it blocks HIV- 1 infection of primary targets including T cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DC); (ii) it exhibits a broad range of antiviral activity against primary HIV- 1 isolates, multidrug resistant HIV- 1 isolates, HIV- 2, and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV); (iii) it prevents transmigration of HIV- 1 through human primary genital epithelial cells; (iv) it prevents HIV- 1 transfer from dendritic cells to CD 4 + T cells; (v) it is potent when added 2 h prior to addition of HIV- 1 to target cells; (vi) it is potent at a low pH; (vii) it blocks HIV- 1 infectivity when diluted in genital fluids; and (viii) it prevents herpes simplex virus infection. The heparan sulfate chains of the syndecan-Fc <b>hybrid</b> <b>molecule</b> are absolutely required for HIV- 1 neutralization. Several lines of evidence suggest that the highly conserved Arg 298 in the V 3 region of gp 120 serves as the locus for the syndecan-Fc <b>hybrid</b> <b>molecule</b> neutralization. In conclusion, this study suggests that the syndecan-Fc <b>hybrid</b> <b>molecule</b> represents the prototype {{of a new generation of}} microbicidal agents that may have promise for HIV- 1 prevention...|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} for the {{determination}} of hydroxyl radicals is proposed. The method {{is based on the}} use of a <b>hybrid</b> <b>molecule</b> consisting of a fluorescent chromophore, anthracene, and a nitroxide radical. In the <b>hybrid</b> <b>molecule,</b> the nitroxide quenches the fluorescence of anthracene strongly. The reaction of hydroxyl radicals with dimethyl sulfoxide generates quantitatively methyl radicals, which then combine with the nitroxide moiety of the hybrid molecules to result in an increase in the fluorescence intensity. The fluorescence increase is proportional to the concentration of hydroxyl radicals. The proposed method is capable of detecting hydroxyl radicals generated in the Fenton system. It is a simple and sensitive technique for {{the determination of}} hydroxyl radicals...|$|E

40|$|Peptide {{nucleic acids}} (PNAs) are DNA mimics {{composed}} of N-(2 -aminoethyl) glycine units. This structure gives to PNAs (a) resistance to DNases and proteinases, (b) capacity to hybridize with high affinity to complementary sequences of single-stranded RNA and DNA and (c) capacity to form highly stable (PNA) 2 -RNA triplexes with RNA targets.

Six samples are discussed here of varying molecular weights of poly(hexyl methacrylate) (PHMA). These six samples targeted degrees of polymerization of PHMA of 5, 7, 9, 11, 15, and 20. Each sample contained approximately the same amount of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). Three samples of poly(ethylene glycol) monomethyl ether-b-poly(hexyl methacrylate) (MPEG-PHMA) are also discussed here for comparison purposes. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) shows a percentage of weight remaining after heating to 550 debree C indicating presence of inorganic material in the hybrid samples. TGA of the free samples show 100 % weight loss by 400 degree C. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) of the hybrid samples showed one glass transition temperature (Tg), a melting point, and a crystallization point for each sample. The Tg was found not to correspond to the Tg of PEG or of PHMA. The crystallization point was found to depend on volume fraction of the silica.
