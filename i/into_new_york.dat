5|$|Escape from New York is a 1981 American dystopian science-fiction action film co-written, co-scored and {{directed}} by John Carpenter. The film is set in what was near-future of 1997, in a crime-ridden United States that has converted Manhattan Island in New York City into the country's maximum security prison. When Air Force One is hijacked by terrorists and crashes <b>into</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City, ex-soldier and federal prisoner Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell) is given 24 hours to rescue the President of the United States.|$|E

A tornado watch was declared for {{central and eastern}} North Carolina on August 17; similar advisories were placed into effect over parts of New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia. Flash flood advisories were also issued northward <b>into</b> <b>New</b> <b>York.</b>|$|E
5|$|King's Highway 405, {{also known}} as Highway405 and the General Brock Parkway, is a 400-Series Highway in the Canadian {{province}} of Ontario connecting the Queen Elizabeth Way(QEW) near St.Catharines with the Lewiston–Queenston Bridge {{in the village of}} Queenston.

5|$|NY83 was {{assigned}} {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to an alignment extending from Frewsburg in the south to Laona in the north. US62 was extended <b>into</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> , overlapping NY83 from Frewsburg to Conewango Valley. The overlap was eliminated in the 1940s when NY83 was truncated to its junction with US62 in Conewango Valley.|$|E
5|$|North of this station, two {{additional}} tracks are {{located within the}} right-of-way. One of the tracks is used to allow for Rockaway Park Shuttle trains to relay and {{to go back into}} service to the Rockaways, while the other track is called the Far Rockaway Test Track. The latter of the two tracks is used to test new subway cars {{to make sure that they}} are ready for acceptance <b>into</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City Transit's fleet of subway cars.|$|E
5|$|On August 30, Arnold sent {{a letter}} {{accepting}} Clinton's terms and proposing a meeting to André through yet another intermediary: William Heron, {{a member of the}} Connecticut Assembly whom he thought he could trust. In an ironic twist, Heron went <b>into</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> unaware of the significance of the letter and offered his own services to the British as a spy. He then took the letter back to Connecticut, suspicious of Arnold's actions, where he delivered it {{to the head of the}} Connecticut militia. General Parsons laid it aside, seeing a letter written as a coded business discussion. Four days later, Arnold sent a ciphered letter with similar content <b>into</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> through the services of the wife of a prisoner of war. Eventually, a meeting was set for September 11 near Dobb's Ferry. This meeting was thwarted when British gunboats in the river fired on his boat, not being informed of his impending arrival.|$|E

5|$|Past Rye Lake Road, NY120A {{serves the}} Griffith E. Harris Golf Club and several mansions {{on its way}} back to the New York–Connecticut state line. Just north of the airport, NY120A turns westward onto Gateway Lane, a small east–west street leading back <b>into</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> and the town of North Castle. Gateway Lane and NY120A both end just inside the state line at an {{intersection}} with NY120. Here, NY120 changes names from Purchase Street to King Street as the route continues NY120A's course along the state line.|$|E
5|$|Route 3 was the {{inspiration}} for a story in The New Yorker in 2004 by Ian Frazier. In this story, Frazier describes a bus journey along the route, mentioning scenes along the road such as traffic congestion, the Meadowlands Sports Complex, and the Tick Tock Diner off Route 3 in Clifton. He also described a walking journey he once took <b>into</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City along Route 3, encountering heavy, noisy traffic speeding by and debris {{along the side of}} the road.|$|E
5|$|The {{steamship}} Celtic pulled <b>into</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> Harbor on September 23, carrying Kalākaua, Judd, Macfarlane, and von Oelhoffen. Awaiting them on {{the dock}} were Armstrong, Hawaiian consul general Elisha Hunt Allen, Jr. and Claus Spreckels. New York was in mourning over the September 19 death of President Garfield. Out of respect to the solemnity of the tragedy, Kalākaua attended no public or private functions in the city. The royal party did, however, spend a day as private tourists at Coney Island.|$|E

One {{is killed}} by a zombie, which falls overboard after being shot by another officer. The police question the boat owner's daughter, Anne Bowles (Tisa Farrow), who claims she hasn't seen her father for months. At the morgue, the officer's corpse stirs. Anne meets journalist Peter West (Ian McCulloch), and the pair follows her father's trail to the Caribbean island Matul. En route, they befriend Brian Hull (Al Cliver) and Susan Barrett (Auretta Gay), who are sailing around the area and agree {{to take them to}} Matul.|$|E
5|$|Returning to the {{character}} she fantasized about the most, the last book in the series, Beebo Brinker, published in 1962, was Bannon's prequel to Odd Girl Out. It follows Beebo around Greenwich Village ten years before she meets Laura in I Am a Woman. Beebo gets off the bus from her rural hometown <b>into</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City to find a waiting friend in Jack, and to discover herself. She begins {{an affair with a}} famous and fading movie star, and follows her to California, only to return to be more honest about what she wants in her life.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of NY18's routing {{south of the}} village of Lewiston was incorporated into the U.S. Highway System in the early 1930s after US62 and US219 were extended <b>into</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> and US104 was assigned. NY18 now began concurrent to US219 at the state line and overlapped the route northward {{to the city of}} Salamanca. US219 left NY18 here, and the latter continued independently to the town of Dayton, where it intersected US62. From there, US62 followed NY18 north to a junction with US104 (Main Street) in Niagara Falls. US62 ended here, and NY18 became concurrent to US104 upon turning onto Main Street. The overlap ended in the village of Lewiston, where US104 turned east to follow Ridge Road instead.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} NY9A {{date back to}} the 1920s when an {{alternate}} route of then-NY6 from Yonkers to Tarrytown was designated as New York State Route6A. NY6 was redesignated as US9 in 1927; however, NY6A was not renumbered to NY9A until the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. NY9A was extended south <b>into</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City in 1934 and north to Ossining in the late 1930s. In 1933, the Briarcliff–Peekskill Parkway opened as New York State Route404. All of NY404 was incorporated into an extended NY9A on January 1, 1949. NY9A was extended northward to Peekskill in 1967 following the completion of the Croton Expressway and southward to the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel in the mid-1990s.|$|E
5|$|When {{presented}} {{with evidence of}} Benedict Arnold's activities, it is reported that Washington remained calm. He did, however, investigate its extent, and suggested {{that he was willing}} to exchange André for Arnold during negotiations with General Clinton over the fate of Major André. Clinton refused this suggestion; after a military tribunal, André was hanged at Tappan, New York on October 2. Washington also infiltrated men <b>into</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> in an attempt to capture Arnold. This plan very nearly succeeded, but failed when Arnold changed living quarters prior to sailing for Virginia in December.|$|E
5|$|By late on September15, the {{hurricane}} {{was beginning to}} affect the North Carolina coastline. The high winds near the center prompted the United States Weather Bureau to issue storm warnings {{on the morning of}} September16 into the next day. Turning northward, {{the hurricane}} weakened slightly and made landfall near Atlantic City, New Jersey, shortly before 12:00UTC on September16. The estimated barometric pressure was , suggesting hurricane-force winds of 80mph (130km/h) at landfall. This made it the first and only known hurricane to strike New Jersey since the Atlantic hurricane database's beginning in 1851. The storm structure broadened after landfall, and the Weather Bureau assessed one center splitting off and tracking north-northeastward <b>into</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> and Connecticut. The main center continued northwestward, weakening into a tropical storm near Trenton, New Jersey. After crossing northeastern Pennsylvania, the system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone near Syracuse, New York on September17. The extratropical remnant persisted for another six hours before losing its identity over eastern Ontario.|$|E

5|$|In the 1930 {{state highway}} renumbering, NY5 was {{truncated}} even further {{to begin in}} downtown Buffalo. The portion between Buffalo and Athol Springs was assigned as part of NY62. Southwest of Buffalo, Southwestern Boulevard, an alternate route of US20 between Irving and Big Tree (east of Athol Springs) became NY20B. Further southwest, another alternate route of US20 between the Pennsylvania line and Silver Creek, running along the shore of Lake Erie, was designated as NY20A. The NY20A and NY20B designations proved to be short-lived. US62 was extended <b>into</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> , causing NY62 to be renumbered. Around the same time, US20 was realigned to follow NY20B from Irving to Big Tree. NY5 was extended along part of old NY62 to Athol Springs, from where it continued to the Pennsylvania state line by way of US20's old routing to Irving and all of NY20A.|$|E
5|$|The British {{evacuated}} Philadelphia to New York City before d'Estaing's arrival, {{and their}} North American fleet {{was no longer}} in the river when his fleet arrived at Delaware Bay in early July. D'Estaing decided to sail for New York, but its well-defended harbour presented a daunting challenge to the French fleet. Since the French and their American pilots believed his largest ships were unable to cross the sandbar <b>into</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> harbour, their leaders decided to deploy their forces agaynst British-occupied Newport, Rhode Island. While d'Estaing was outside the harbour, British Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Clinton and Vice-Admiral Lord Richard Howe dispatched a fleet of transports carrying 2,000 troops to reinforce Newport via Long Island Sound; these reached their destination on 15 July, raising the size of Major General Sir Robert Pigot's garrison to over 6,700 men.|$|E
5|$|The Palisades Interstate Parkway {{begins at}} the George Washington Bridge (GWB) in Fort Lee, New Jersey. Passengers from the upper level of the GWB can {{directly}} get on the PIP northbound, while passengers from the lower level of the bridge must travel through GWB Plaza on US9W before getting on the parkway. Passengers riding northbound on the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95) must be in local lanes to directly get on the PIP. Once the PIP leaves the GWB, it proceeds north along the New Jersey Palisades, past the Englewood Cliffs Service Area. Unlike service areas further north along the parkway, there are two in Englewood, one for northbound drivers and one for southbound drivers. The others are in the center median shared by drivers going in both directions. There are also three different scenic lookout points over the Palisades near {{the northern tip of}} the island of Manhattan at the Harlem River. After this, the PIP parallels US9W and the Hudson River for its entire run in New Jersey. All four exits in New Jersey are either with US9W, or within mere feet of the route. The PIP leaves New Jersey <b>into</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> in the borough of Rockleigh.|$|E
