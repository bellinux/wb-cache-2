50|$|Besides the {{volcanic}} {{area of the}} south, there are significant mud hot springs {{in the northern part}} of the island, around Beppu.

5000|$|The {{park has}} {{a variety of}} wildlife, such as over 300 species of birds, such as the three-wattled bellbird (Procnias tricarunculata) and emerald toucanet (Aulacorhynchus prasinus), and also various quetzals, curassows, eagles, etc. Mammals seen in the park include cougars, monkeys, kinkajous, jaguars and many more.

50|$|The {{surrounding}} area {{is part of}} the Hengill central volcano, and is geothermally active and experiences very frequent (usually minor) earthquakes. The town is known for its greenhouses, which are heated by hot water from volcanic hot springs. These springs are the site of occurrence of certain <b>extremophile</b> <b>micro-organisms,</b> that are capable of surviving in extremely hot environments. Close to the church is a hot spring called Sandhólshver, formed during the violent South Iceland earthquake of 1896. A fenced-off geothermal area in the town has numerous hot springs and fumaroles.|$|R
50|$|This harsh {{dry land}} with little {{vegetation}} and {{small amounts of}} salty water, when it is present at all, supports little wildlife all year round but is used by {{a large number of}} migratory birds. The hypersaline pan supports brine shrimp and a number of <b>extremophile</b> <b>micro-organisms</b> tolerant of the high saline conditions.(C.Michael Hogan. 2010.) In particularly rainy years the Etosha pan becomes a lake approximately 10 cm in depth and becomes a breeding ground for flamingos, which arrive in their thousands, and great white pelican (Pelecanus onocrotalus).|$|R
50|$|The salt pans are {{the most}} {{noticeable}} geological features in the Etosha national park. The main depression covers an area of about 5000 km2, and is roughly 130 km long and as wide as 50 km places. The hypersaline conditions of the pan limit the species that can permanently inhabit the pan itself; occurrences of <b>extremophile</b> <b>micro-organisms</b> are present, which species can tolerate the hypersaline conditions. The salt pan is usually dry, but fills with water briefly in the summer, when it attracts pelicans and flamingos in particular.|$|R
50|$|Gilroy Yamato Hot Springs, a California Historical Landmark and on {{the list}} of National Register of Historical Places, is a {{property}} near Gilroy, California famed for its mineral hot springs and historic development by early settlers and Japanese immigrants. The earliest extant Italianate-Victorian style structures date from the 1870s, and the earliest bathhouse dates from 1890. Other early structures are a Buddhist shrine from 1939 and a Japanese garden teahouse from that same year. The property is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The hot spring's temperature ranges from 99° to 111 °F (37° to 44 °C). These springs are the site of occurrence of certain <b>extremophile</b> <b>micro-organisms,</b> that are capable of surviving in extremely hot environments.|$|R

40|$|Astrobiology is a {{relatively}} recent scientific field that seeks to understand the origin and dynamics {{of life in the}} Universe. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain life in the cosmic context throughout human history, but only now, technology has allowed many of them to be tested. Laboratory experiments have been able to show how chemical elements essential to life, such as carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and hydrogen combine in biologically important compounds. Interestingly, these compounds are ubiquitous. How these compounds were combined to the point of originating cells and complex organisms is still to be unveiled by science. However, our 4. 5 billion years old Solar system appeared in a 10 billion years old Universe. Thus, simple cells such as micro-organisms may have had time to form in planets older than ours or in other suitable places in the Universe. One hypothesis related to the appearance of life on Earth is called panspermia, which predicts that microbial life could have been formed in the Universe billions of years ago, travelling between planets, and inseminating units of life that could have become more complex in habitable planets such as Earth. A project designed to test the viability of <b>extremophile</b> <b>micro-organisms</b> exposed to simulated extraterrestrial environments is in progress at the Carlos Chagas Filho Institute of Biophysics (UFRJ, Brazil) to test whether microbial life could withstand inhospitable environments. Radiation-resistant (known or novel ones) micro-organisms collected from extreme terrestrial environments have been exposed (at synchrotron accelerators) to intense radiation sources simulating Solar radiation, capable of emitting radiation in a few hours equivalent to many years of accumulated doses. The results obtained in these experiments reveal an interesting possibility of the existence of microbial life beyond Earth.

40|$|Archaea {{are best}} known in their {{capacities}} as <b>extremophiles,</b> i. e. <b>micro-organisms</b> able {{to thrive in}} some of the most drastic environments on Earth. The protein-based surface layer that envelopes many archaeal strains must thus correctly assemble and maintain its structural integrity in the face of the physical challenges associated with, for instance, life in high salinity, at elevated temperatures or in acidic surroundings. Study of archaeal surface-layer (glyco) proteins has thus offered insight into the strategies employed by these proteins to survive direct contact with extreme environments, yet has also served to elucidate other aspects of archaeal protein biosynthesis, including glycosylation, lipid modification and protein export. In this mini-review, recent advances in the study of archaeal surface-layer (glyco) proteins are discussed. Overview The fascinating ability of members of the Archaea to thrive in extremes of temperature, salt and pH as well as in other seemingly hostile niches has generated substantial interest in the molecular mechanisms responsible for mediating survival in the face of such environmental challenges.

40|$|Extremophiles are organisms {{adapted to}} grow at extreme ranges of {{environmental}} variables, such as high or low temperatures, acid or alkaline medium, high salt concentration, high pressures and so forth. Most <b>extremophiles</b> are <b>micro-organisms</b> that belong to the Archaea and Bacteria domains, and are widely spread across the world, which include the polar regions, volcanoes, deserts, deep oceanic sediments, hydrothermal vents, hypersaline lakes, acid and alkaline water bodies, and other extreme environments considered hostile to human life. Despite the tropical climate, Brazil has {{a wide range of}} ecosystems which include some permanent or seasonally extreme environments. For example, the Cerrado is a biome with very low soil pH with high Al+ 3 concentration, the mangroves in the Brazilian coast are anaerobic and saline, Pantanal has thousands of alkaline-saline lakes, the Caatinga arid and hot soils and the deep sea sediments in the Brazilian ocean shelf. These environments harbour extremophilic organisms that, coupled with the high natural biodiversity in Brazil, could be explored for different purposes. However, only a few projects in Brazil intended to study the extremophiles. In the frame of astrobiology, for example, these organisms could provide important models for defining the limits of life and hypothesize about life outside Earth. Brazilian microbiologists have, however, studied the extremophilic micro-organisms inhabiting non-Brazilian environments, such as the Antarctic continent. The experience and previous results obtained from the Brazilian Antarctic Program (PROANTAR) provide important results that are directly related to astrobiology. This article is a brief synopsis of the Brazilian experience in researching extremophiles, indicating the most important results related to astrobiology and some future perspectives in this area.
