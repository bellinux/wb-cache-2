50|$|As {{there are}} few {{instrumental}} records before 1850, temperatures before then must be reconstructed based on proxy methods.

50|$|Climatology is {{approached}} {{in various ways}} such as Paleoclimatology, which seeks to reconstruct past climates by examining records such as ice cores and tree rings (<b>dendroclimatology).</b> Paleotempestology uses these same records to help determine hurricane frequency over millennia. The study of contemporary climates incorporates meteorological data accumulated over many years, such as records of rainfall, temperature and atmospheric composition. Knowledge of the atmosphere and its dynamics is also embodied in models, either statistical or mathematical, which help by integrating different observations and testing how they fit together. Modeling is used for understanding past, present and potential future climates. Historical climatology {{is the study of}} climate as related to human history and thus focuses only on the last few thousand years.|$|E
5000|$|Trees do {{not cover}} the Earth. Polar and marine climates cannot be {{estimated}} from tree rings. In perhumid tropical regions, Australia and southern Africa, trees generally grow {{all year round}} and don't show clear annual rings. In some forest areas, the tree growth is too much influenced by multiple factors (no [...] "limiting stand") to allow clear climate reconstruction. The coverage difficulty is dealt with by acknowledging it and by using other proxies (e.g. ice cores, corals) in difficult areas. In some cases it can be shown that the parameter of interest (temperature, precipitation, etc.) varies similarly from area to area, for example by looking at patterns in the instrumental record. Then one is justified in extending the <b>dendroclimatology</b> inferences to areas where no suitable tree ring samples are obtainable.|$|E
5000|$|Individual proxy records, such as {{tree ring}} widths and densities used in <b>dendroclimatology,</b> are {{calibrated}} against the instrumental {{record for the}} period of overlap. Networks of such records are used to reconstruct past temperatures for regions: tree ring proxies have been used to reconstruct Northern Hemisphere extratropical temperatures (within the tropics trees do not form rings) but are confined to land areas and are scarce in the Southern Hemisphere which is largely ocean. Wider coverage is provided by multiproxy reconstructions, incorporating proxies such as lake sediments, ice cores and corals which are found in different regions, and using statistical methods to relate these sparser proxies to the greater numbers of tree ring records. The [...] "Composite Plus Scaling" [...] (CPS) method is widely used for large-scale multiproxy reconstructions of hemispheric or global average temperatures; this is complemented by Climate Field Reconstruction (CFR) methods which show how climate patterns have developed over large spatial areas, making the reconstruction useful for investigating natural variability and long-term oscillations as well as for comparisons with patterns produced by climate models.|$|E
50|$|The first truly {{quantitative}} {{reconstruction of}} Northern Hemisphere temperatures {{had been published}} in 1993 by Bradley and Phil Jones, but it and subsequent reconstructions compiled averages for decades, covering the whole hemisphere. Mann wanted temperatures of individual years showing differences between regions, to find spatial patterns showing natural oscillations {{and the effect of}} events such as volcanic eruptions. Sophisticated statistical methods had already been applied to <b>dendroclimatology,</b> but to get wider geographical coverage these tree ring records had to be related to sparser proxies such as ice cores, corals and lake sediments. To avoid giving too much weight to the more numerous tree data, Mann, Bradley and Hughes used the statistical procedure of principal component analysis to represent these larger datasets in terms of a small number of representative series and compare them to the sparser proxy records. The same procedure was also used to represent key information in the instrumental temperature record for comparison with the proxy series, enabling validation of the reconstruction. They chose the period 1902-1980 for calibration, leaving the previous 50 years of instrumental data for validation. This showed that the statistical reconstructions were only skillful (statistically meaningful) back to 1400.|$|E

40|$|<b>Dendroclimatology,</b> i. e. using tree-ring data to {{reconstruct}} past climates, in Fennoscandia {{has a strong}} tradition. Due to the high-latitude location of the region, trees are sensitive to climate; in general to temperatures during summer.

Situated in a sparsely populated part of the Boreal belt, Fennoscandia with its large areas of old-growth forests is suitable for constructing tree-ring chronologies reaching far back in time. Indeed, some of the world longest tree-ring chronologies are found in the region, covering all, or most of, the Holocene.

40|$|Tree {{rings are}} widely used {{long-term}} proxy data which, if combined with longterm instrumental climate records, can provide excellent information on global climate variability. This research aimed to determine whether interannual climate– growth responses in Alpine treeline forests are stationary over time. • We used tree-ring width chronologies of Larix decidua (European larch) from 17 sites and monthly temperatures and precipitation data for the period 1800 – 1999. Climate–growth relationships were assessed with correlation and response functions, and their stationarity and consistency over time were measured using moving correlation. • Tree-ring chronologies showed similar interannual variations {{over the last two}} centuries, suggesting that the same climatic factors synchronously limited growth at most sites. The most sensitive variables showed significant transient responses varying within the time period, indicating a possible deviation from the uniformitarian principle applied to <b>dendroclimatology.</b> • If these findings are confirmed in future studies on other species and in other regions, we suggest that time-dependent variables should be taken into account to avoid overestimation of treeline advance, future forest carbon storage in temperaturelimited environments and inaccurate reconstruction of past climate variability.

40|$|International audienceDendrochronology (i. e., {{the study}} of {{annually}} dated tree-ring time series) {{has proved to be}} a powerful technique to understand tree-growth. This paper intends to show the interest of using ecophysiological modeling not only to understand and predict tree-growth (dendroecology) but also to reconstruct past climates (<b>dendroclimatology).</b> Process models have been used for several decades in <b>dendroclimatology,</b> but it is only recently that methods of model-data fusion have led to significant progress in modeling tree-growth as a function of climate and in reconstructing past climates. These model-data fusion (MDF) methods, mainly based on the Bayesian paradigm, have been shown to be powerful for both model calibration and model inversion. After a rapid survey of tree-growth modeling, we illustrate MDF with examples based on series of Southern France Aleppo pines and Central France oaks. These examples show that if plants experienced CO 2 fertilization, this would have a significant effect on tree-growth which in turn would bias the climate reconstructions. This bias could be extended to other environmental non-climatic factors directly or indirectly affecting annual ring formation and not taken into account in classical empirical models, which supports the use of more complex process-based models. Finally, we conclude by showing the interest of the data assimilation methods applied in climatology to produce climate re-analyses...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Long tree-ring chronologies {{have been}} {{constructed}} in the Northern Hemisphere for <b>dendroclimatology</b> and palaeoenvironmental studies, radiocarbon calibration and archaeological dating. Numerous tree-ring chronologies have also {{been built in the}} Southern Hemisphere, primarily for <b>dendroclimatology,</b> but multimillennial chronologies are rare. Development of long chronologies from the Southern Hemisphere is therefore important to provide a long-term perspective on environmental change at local, regional and global scales. This paper describes the extension of the New Zealand Agathis australis (kauri) chronology from AD 911 to 1724 BC. Subfossil (swamp) kauri was collected from 17 swamp sites in the upper North Island. Kauri timbers were also obtained from an early twentieth century house on the University of Auckland campus. Twelve site chronologies and 11 independent tree-sequences were constructed and crossmatched to produce a 3631 -yr record, which was calendar dated to 1724 BC-AD 1907 against the modern kauri master chronology. A new long chronology, AGAUc 04 a, was built by combining the modern kauri data with house timbers and subfossil kauri. This new chronology spans 1724 BC-AD 1998. It is of similar length to chronologies from Tasmania and South America and is the longest tree-ring chronology yet built in New Zealand. The greatest significance of the long kauri chronology lies in its potential as a high-quality palaeoclimate proxy, especially with regard to investigation of the El Ninio-Southern Oscillation phenomenon. The chronology also has application to investigation of extreme environmental events, dendroecology, archaeology and radiocarbon calibration...|$|E

40|$|International audienceTree species {{responses}} {{to climate change}} will be greatly influenced by their evolutionary potential and their phenotypic plasticity. Investigating tree-rings {{responses to}} climate and population genetics at the regional scale is crucial in assessing the tree behavior to climate change. This study combined in situ <b>dendroclimatology</b> and population genetics over a latitudinal gradient and compared the variations between the two at the intra- and inter-population levels. This approach was applied on the northern marginal populations of Thuja occidentalis (eastern white-cedar) in the Canadian boreal forest. We aimed first to assess the radial growth variability (response functional trait) within populations across the gradient and to compare it with the genetic diversity (microsatellites). Second, we investigated the variability in the growth response to climate at the regional scale through the radial growth-climate relationships, and tested its correlation with environmental variables and population genetic structure. Model selection based on the Akaike Information Criteria revealed that the growth synchronicity between pairs of trees of a population covariates with both the genetic diversity of this population {{and the amount of}} precipitation (inverse correlations), although these variables only explained {{a small fraction of the}} observed variance. At the regional scale, variance partitioning and partial redundancy analysis indicate that the growth response to climate was greatly modulated by stand environmental variables, suggesting predominant plastic variations in growth-response to climate. Combining in situ <b>dendroclimatology</b> and population genetics is a promising way to investigate species’ response capacity to climate change in natural stands. We stress the need to control for local climate and site conditions effects on dendroclimatic response to climate to avoid misleading conclusions regarding the associations with genetic variables...|$|E
