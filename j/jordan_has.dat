The result was $3.4 billion in tourism revenues, $4.4 billion with the inclusion of medical tourists. The majority of tourists coming to Jordan are from European and Arab countries. The tourism sector in <b>Jordan</b> <b>has</b> been severely affected by regional turbulence.

5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that {{reserves}} of crude oil are non-commercial, <b>Jordan</b> <b>has</b> the 5th largest oil-shale reserves in the world, which could be commercially exploited in the central and northwestern regions of the country. Official figures estimate the kingdom's oil shale reserves at more than 70 billion tonnes. Attarat Power Plant, which will start construction in late 2017, is a $2.2 billion oil shale-dependent power plant that will be completed in 2020 with a total capacity of 470 megawatts. The project {{is part of the}} kingdom's visionary plan that aims to diversify its energy resources by 2025. The extraction of shale oil had been delayed by a couple of years due to: the advanced level of technology that is required for extraction; and the relatively higher cost.|$|E
5|$|Jordan {{is rich in}} Paleolithic remains, holding {{evidence}} of inhabitance by Homo erectus, Neanderthal and modern humans. The oldest {{evidence of}} human habitation dates back around 250,000 years. The Kharanah area in eastern <b>Jordan</b> <b>has</b> evidence of human huts from about 20,000 years ago. Other Paleolithic sites include Pella and Al-Azraq. In the Neolithic period, several settlements began to develop, most notably an agricultural community called 'Ain Ghazal {{in what is now}} Amman, one of the largest known prehistoric settlements in the Near East. Plaster statues estimated to date back to around 7250 BC were uncovered there, and are among the oldest large human statues ever found. Villages of Bab edh-Dhra in the Dead Sea area, Tal Hujayrat Al-Ghuzlan in Aqaba and Tulaylet Ghassul in the Jordan Valley all date to the Chalcolithic period.|$|E

5|$|Many of Jordan's contemporaries {{say that}} Jordan is the {{greatest}} basketball player of all time. In 1999, an ESPN survey of journalists, athletes and other sports figures ranked Jordan the greatest North American athlete of the 20th century, above such luminaries as Babe Ruth and Muhammad Ali. Jordan placed second to Babe Ruth in the Associated Press's December 1999 list of 20th century athletes. In addition, the Associated Press voted him as the greatest basketball player of the 20th century. <b>Jordan</b> <b>has</b> also appeared on the front cover of Sports Illustrated a record 50 times. In the September 1996 issue of Sport, which was the publication's 50th anniversary issue, Jordan was named the greatest athlete of the past 50 years.|$|E
5|$|Michael <b>Jordan</b> <b>has</b> won {{the most}} scoring titles, with ten. Jordan and Chamberlain {{are the only}} players to have won seven {{consecutive}} scoring titles (this was also Chamberlain's career total). George Gervin, Allen Iverson and Durant have won four scoring titles in their career, and George Mikan, Neil Johnston and Bob McAdoo have achieved it three times. Paul Arizin, Bob Pettit, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Shaquille O'Neal, Tracy McGrady, Kobe Bryant, and Russell Westbrook have each won the scoring title twice. Since the 1946–47 season, five players have won both the scoring title and the NBA championship in the same season: Fulks in 1947 with the Philadelphia Warriors, Mikan from 1949 to 1950 with the Minneapolis Lakers, Abdul-Jabbar (then Alcindor) in 1971 with the Milwaukee Bucks, Jordan from 1991 to 1993 and from 1996 to 1998 with the Chicago Bulls, and O'Neal in 2000 with the Los Angeles Lakers. Since {{the introduction of the}} three-point field goal, O'Neal is the only scoring leader to have made no three-point field goals in his winning season.|$|E
5|$|The {{boundaries}} of Palestine have varied throughout history. The Jordan Rift Valley (comprising Wadi Arabah, the Dead Sea and River <b>Jordan)</b> <b>has</b> at times formed {{a political and}} administrative frontier, even within empires that have controlled both territories. At other times, such as during certain periods during the Hasmonean and Crusader states for example, as well as during the biblical period, territories {{on both sides of}} the river formed part of the same administrative unit. During the Arab Caliphate period, parts of southern Lebanon and the northern highland areas of Palestine and Jordan were administered as Jund al-Urdun, while the southern parts of the latter two formed part of Jund Dimashq, which during the 9th century was attached to the administrative unit of Jund Filastin.|$|E

5|$|The current monarch, Abdullah II, {{ascended to}} the throne in February 1999 {{after the death of}} his father Hussein. Abdullah re-affirmed Jordan's {{commitment}} to the peace treaty with Israel and its relations with the United States. He refocused the government's agenda on economic reform, during his first year. King Abdullah's eldest son, Prince Hussein, is the current Crown Prince of Jordan. The current prime minister is Hani Al-Mulki who received his position on 29 May 2016. Abdullah had announced his intentions of turning Jordan into a parliamentary system, where the largest bloc in parliament forms a government. However, the underdevelopment of political parties in the country have hampered such moves. <b>Jordan</b> <b>has</b> around 50 political parties representing nationalist, leftist, Islamist, and liberal ideologies. Political parties contested a fifth of the seats in the 2016 elections, the remainder belonging to independent politicians.|$|E
5|$|The game also {{remains the}} only {{national}} championship game to have featured three of the NBA 50 Greatest Players – Jordan, Ewing and Worthy – chosen in 1996 to mark the NBA's 50th anniversary. In addition to Jordan's, Ewing's and Worthy's Hall of Fame NBA careers with the Chicago Bulls, New York Knicks and Los Angeles Lakers respectively (including a combined 9 NBA championships), Floyd was named an NBA All-Star and still holds playoff records for most points in a quarter and half, while Perkins played in the league for 17 seasons. For Jordan's part, his game-winner is often seen as the launching point of his career - the moment that gave him the confidence to become what many {{believe to be the}} greatest basketball player of all time, in no small part due to his clutch performance. <b>Jordan</b> <b>has</b> said multiple times that before he would take game-winning shots with the Bulls, he would sometimes think back to his shot in the 1982 game that propelled North Carolina past Georgetown.|$|E
5|$|The {{project is}} funded through an equity {{contribution}} of about USD 200m from Diwaco, a USD 300m grant and a USD 100m stand-by facility from the Jordanian government, {{as well as}} USD 475m in foreign loans to Diwaco. The project's total cost {{is expected to be}} $1.1 billion USD. The U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation has lent USD 250m to Diwaco to support U.S. foreign investment on the basis that General Electric partially owns GAMA Energy. The state-owned French bank PROPARCO, which is the part of the French Development Agency (AFD) that supports private sector development, and the European Investment Bank (EIB) each lent about USD 100m to Diwaco. The loan package has been put together by the Arab Banking Corporation. Much of the government grant supporting the project comes from sovereign soft loans that the government of <b>Jordan</b> <b>has</b> borrowed from the EIB and AFD and passes on as a grant to the project.
