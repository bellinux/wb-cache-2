5000|$|It {{is often}} unclear whether recent discussions of anti-American bias at Al Jazeera are {{referring}} also to Al Jazeera English or only to Al Jazeera's Arabic-language channel.

An {{example of this is}} a 2011 claim by Bill O'Reilly that Al Jazeera is [...] "anti-Semitic" [...] and [...] "anti-American" [...] and a subsequent defense of Al Jazeera against these claims made by former Al Jazeera English anchor <b>Dave</b> <b>Marash</b> on the O'Reilly Factor. Another example concerns statements by former US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, who in April 2004 denounced Al-Jazeera's Arabic-language coverage of the Iraq War as [...] "vicious, inaccurate and inexcusable," [...] but took a more conciliatory tone in a 2011 interview for Frost Over The World, Al Jazeera English's news and public affairs program hosted by David Frost, praising the network as [...] "an important means of communication in the world." ...|$|R
