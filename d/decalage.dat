5000|$|Some psychologists take a {{neural network}} model {{approach}} {{to the idea of}} horizontal and vertical <b>décalage.</b> According to these psychologists, horizontal and vertical <b>décalage</b> are the product of the development of the prefrontal cortex in children, which “contributes to age-related advances in flexible behavior”. [...] Certain tests and studies have been conducted to show how horizontal and vertical <b>décalage</b> are related to neural functioning. For example, scientists presented children with two identical balls of clay and then rolled one into a cylinder, changing its shape. When scientists then asked children which clump of clay contained more clay (conservation of mass), children were able to answer correctly that both clumps had equal amounts of clay. Children of the same age, however, were unable to answer which clump of clay weighed more (conservation of weight). This is an example of horizontal <b>decalage</b> because children were able to solve certain conservation tasks but not others despite their similarities. According to the neural network approach, as a child’s prefrontal cortex develops, he or she is better able to maintain their knowledge “rules” and apply problem solving techniques across different situations. The development of the prefrontal cortex comes from the strengthening of neural synapses, a process which is remarkably heightened in childhood.|$|E

40|$|Multi Object Adaptive Optics (MOAO) is a {{solution}} developed to perform a correction by adaptive optics (AO) in a science large field of view. As many wide field AO scheme, a tomographic reconstruction of the turbulent volume is {{required in order to}} compute the MOAO corrections to be applied in the dedicated directions of the observed very faint targets. The specificity of MOAO is the open loop control of the deformable mirrors by a number of the wavefront sensors which are coupled to bright guide stars in different directions. MOAO calls for new procedures both for the cross registration of all the channels and for the computation of the tomographic reconstructor. The proposed approach, called Learn and Apply (L&A), allows us to retrieve the tomographic reconstructor using the on-sky wavefront measurements from an MOAO instrument. This method is also used to calibrate the registrations between the off-axis wavefront sensors and the deformable mirrors placed in the science optical paths. The procedure links the WFSs in the different directions and measures directly on-sky the required covariance matrices needed for the reconstructor. The theoretical expressions of the turbulence spatial covariance of wavefront slopes allows to derive any turbulent covariance matrix between two wavefront sensors. It is discussed the convergence issue on the measured covariance matrices, and proposed the fitting of the data based on the theoretical slope covariance using a reduced number of turbulence parameters. The Learn and Apply tomography method has been fully tested and validated in laboratory, on the SESAME bench, and will be tested on-sky, on the MOAO demonstrator called CANARY installed in 2010 at the William Herschel Telescope (Canaries Islands).

40|$|Layered silicates like smectites are {{important}} soil components. Many works have {{been devoted to}} functionalize these materials {{in order to increase}} their chelating properties which may help retain heavy metals. It is well known that Cd 2 +, Hg 2 +, Pb 2 +, Co 2 + and Zn 2 + forms stable complexes with sulfur-containing organic ligands like cysteine. The first step of this work was the preparation of cysteine-montmorillonite composite through procedures that are well mastered. The second step was the study of the capacity of these composite materials to adsorb heavy metal cations. The chemical data demonstrates that the amount of cysteine detected on montmorillonite increases rapidly during the first few hours to attain a plateau after 24 h. A comparison between the chelating properties of the resulting hybrid inorganic-organic materials and the pure montmorillonite was carried out for the following heavy metal cations Cd 2 +, Hg 2 +, Pb 2 +, Co 2 + and Zn 2 +. It appears that the adsorption capacity of both materials is comparable. However, in release experiments, the heavy metal cations are more strongly retained by the hybrid material. Thermogravimetric analysis shows a special behavior with mercury and copper cations. Interactions between the hybrid clay mineral and the inorganic hosts were studied by spectroscopic methods such as solid-state NMR and FTIR. The experimental data were interpreted and supported by the use of theoretical periodic DFT calculations. Experiments with co-adsorption of heavy metal cations and emergent pollutants were also conducted. Interactions between the pollutants and the composite were highlighted by spectroscopic techniques. Des matériaux verts biodégradables à base de Montmorillonite et de cystéine ont été préparés dans le but de co-adsorber des cations de métaux lourds et des polluants émergeants en combinant l’expérience et la théorie (calculs DFT). Les analyses thermiques différentielles ont permis d’estimer le pourcentage d’eau et de matière organique, informations indispensables permettant de lancer les calculs théoriques. La première étape a consisté en l’adsorption des cations de métaux lourds tels que Pb 2 +, Cu 2 +, Co 2 +, Zn 2 + et Hg 2 + par le composite montmorillonite-cystéine et leurs caractérisations physico-chimiques. La deuxième étape a consisté à co-adsorber le sulfadiazine dans le composite montmorillonite-cystéine-cation de métal lourd.

The workers tend rather to acquire a variety of different tasks. Now the tasks of « baccalauréat »-holders employed on a production line and/or in a maintenance capacity will always consist mainly of production and maintenance jobs. There is no scope for finding ways of improving the product, the process or the equipment. Technical reforms do not always affect the contents of workers' activity to the extent or in the way they were intended to do.

In a variation of this task, called the “hidden length experiment,” the children were made to order the sticks, but were only {{able to look at}} two sticks at a time, forcing them to employ the transitive property. Finally, the children were forced to place seven identical cubes of different densities in order from lightest to heaviest. The results revealed that the “hidden length” seriation task and the weight seriation task were much more difficult for the children than were the normal seriation tasks, thereby supporting the notion of horizontal <b>décalage.</b> [...] While the children were able to successfully complete certain seriation tasks, they were unable to complete others. Studies have also been conducted regarding vertical <b>decalage.</b> In a study by Redpath and Rogers, fifteen males and fifteen females from both preschool and second grade were interviewed.

The second graders demonstrated a heightened ability to understand said concepts as compared to the preschool aged children, thus supporting the notion of vertical <b>decalage.</b> Interestingly, the researchers discovered that if the second graders had been previously hospitalized, the experience improved their grasp of hospital concepts.

40|$|Collecting {{information}} on past strong earthquakes {{is crucial to}} anticipate {{the characteristics of the}} future strong earthquakes that threaten us. A part of the traces left by the past earthquakes remains hidden in the first few meters of the ground. Until now, paleoseismological trenches across faults have been used to search for these traces. Though relevant, this method is destructive and allows, at best, detecting the few most recent events. The objective of my PhD work, done in the framework of the ANR project CENTURISK, was to develop a novel form of paleoseismology, of geophysical type, based on multi-frequency, pseudo- 3 D GPR surveys. The idea is to image at high-resolution the architecture of the first ≈ 10 m of the ground over wide areas along active faults, in order to detect the possibly buried traces, especially the offsets, produced by the last 10 - 20 strong earthquakes on the fault. We have first developed the approach by adapting the acquisition and processing of GPR data to the selected targets. We have then applied the approach on some of the largest active strike-slip faults in New Zealand, where sedimentation conditions are ideal. Twelve sites were investigated, 5 of them are presented in this work. At each site, we first analyzed the surface morphology in the greatest detail on LiDAR data and high resolution GPS DEMs. This analysis allowed us to identify all the morphological markers preserved at the ground surface, and being offset by the fault. We measured these surface offsets, doing so collecting a dense population of cumulative displacement values. We then surveyed each site with 40 - 60, 100 and 250 MHz, hundreds of meters long GPR profiles, parallel to the fault and regularly spaced by 5 - 10 m {{on either side of the}} fault trace. At each site, the processing of the GPR data revealed a large number of buried markers – palaeosurfaces and incision features, hidden in the first 5 - 10 m of the ground. Most of the buried markers were observed cut and laterally displaced by the fault, and these offsets could be measured. The measures provide a dense collection of cumulative offsets on each investigated fault, generally 10 - 20 times more than ever reported. To analyze these dense surface and sub-surface data collections, we used statistical methods made to define and retain only the best constrained offset values. These best values are separated by slip increments that are directly related to the successive coseismic slips that we search. The entire analysis revealed that the offsets measured in the sub-surface fill the gaps in the surface record, and that the surface offsets are systematically lower than those measured in the sub-surface on the same markers. Additionally, the buried record is longer than the surface record. Applied to the Hope Fault, our novel approach allowed identifying the last 30 - 35 strong earthquakes that broke the fault, each had produced a lateral offset at surface of 3. 2 ± 1 m and got a magnitude ≈ Mw 7. 0 - 7. 4. Applied to the Wellington Fault (at Te Marua site), the approach allowed identifying a minimum of 15 past strong earthquakes, each had produced a lateral offset at surface of 3. 7 ± 1. 7 m and got a magnitude ≈ Mw 6. 9 - 7. 6. My PhD work thus confirms the great potential of pseudo- 3 D Ground Penetrating Radar survey to detect a significant part of the fault seismic history, and thus to provide critical information to determine the displacements and magnitudes of the past strong earthquakes on faults. Applied to seismogenic faults worldwide, in complement to surface approaches, the geophysical GPR paleoseismology should help better assessing seismic hazard. Acquérir des informations sur les forts séismes passés est crucial pour anticiper les caractéristiques des forts séismes futurs. Une partie des traces laissées par les forts séismes passés sont enfouies dans les premiers mètres du sol et sont en général révélées par des tranchées de quelques mètres de profondeur ouvertes à travers les failles sismogènes. Bien que pertinente, cette méthode est destructive. L'objectif a été de développer une nouvelle forme de paléosismologie, non destructive, basée sur l'imagerie géoradar pseudo 3 D, capable de retrouver ces traces enfouies des séismes passés. Dans ce travail, cinq sites d’étude sont présentés, situés le long de failles actives décrochantes de Nouvelle Zélande. Notre nouvelle approche débute, dans un premier temps, par l’analyse ‘classique’ de la morphologie de surface à partir de données LiDAR et de MNT GPS haute résolution. Ceci nous permet d’identifier l'ensemble des marqueurs morphologiques préservés à la surface et les déplacements horizontaux qu’ils ont enregistrés. Dans un second temps, l’analyse des profils GPR pseudo- 3 D acquis en chacun des sites révèlent des réflecteurs principaux dans les premiers 5 - 10 m du sol recoupés par un grand nombre de marqueurs morphologiques, partiellement ou totalement invisibles en surface. La plupart de ces marqueurs enfouis sont coupés et décalés par la faille considérée. Les mesures de ces <b>décalages</b> fournissent des collections denses de déplacements cumulés sur chacune des failles investiguées avec généralement un nombre de mesures effectués en sub-surface 10 à 20 fois plus important qu’en surface et couvrant une plus large gamme de valeurs. L’application sur la faille de Hope de cette approche a notamment permis de mettre en évidence un déplacement latéral caractéristique de 3. 2 ± 1 m lors des 30 - 35 derniers forts séismes. Ce travail démontre le potentiel de l'imagerie géoradar pseudo- 3 D à détecter une partie de l'histoire sismique des failles et, ce faisant, à fournir des informations sur les caractéristiques des forts séismes passés...|$|R
5000|$|An {{example of}} {{horizontal}} <b>décalage</b> is the invariance of quantity, which is typically mastered around {{the age of}} 6 or 7 when matter is concerned, {{at the age of}} 9 or 10 when weight is concerned, and around 11 or 12 years old when the invariant is volume. [...] A 7-year-old child understands that when one of two equivalent balls of clay is transformed into a sausage-shape, the two lumps still consist of equal amounts of clay. The child, however, fails to correctly comprehend that the differently shaped clumps of clay weigh the same. Both tasks are similar, but the child is clearly unable to apply his understanding about the first situation to the second situation. A comparable phenomenon can be seen in a child’s increasing ability to perform seriation tasks, which consists of ordering objects according to increasing or decreasing size. The ability to arrange rods in order of decreasing/increasing size is always acquired prior to the capacity to seriate according to weight. [...] A commonly cited example of vertical <b>décalage</b> “can be observed between the constitution of practical or sensorimotor space and that of representative space ” For example, at the age of 2, a child can navigate around a familiar environment, such as their home. It is not until years later that they can represent this knowledge symbolically by drawing a map. There is vertical <b>décalage</b> between a problem that a child can physically master and their ability to solve it in an abstract manner.|$|E

The two worked together again on the script of <b>Decalage</b> horaire (aka Jet Lag, 2001), and their script for Fauteuils d'orchestre (aka Orchestra Seats or Avenue Montaigne, 2006) was a nominee {{in the category of}} Best Writing at the César Awards. A later collaboration, the comedy Change of Plans, was released in 2009.|$|E
50|$|There {{have been}} many criticisms of Piaget’s theories, {{including}} his ideas of horizontal and vertical <b>décalage.</b> A further criticism is that restructuring the presentation of a problem has a significant bearing on the child’s ability to solve the problem, which demonstrates that problem solving ability might depend on {{the presentation of the}} problem more so than on the child’s cognitive development. According to Wordsworth and other Piagetian supporters, however, Piaget’s main idea that all children have the same general course of development is so significant that it outweighs the criticisms of his methodology in which so many others find fault.|$|E
50|$|Thus {{it seems}} that the {{dislocation}} <b>décalage</b> between the connexions and instances in transition periods merely reflects the coexistence of two (or more) modes of production in a single 'simultaneity ', and the dominance of one of them over the other. This confirms the fact that the problems of diachrony, too, must be thought within the problematic of a theoretical 'synchrony': the problems of the transition and of the forms of the transition from one mode of production to another are problems of a more general synchrony than that of the mode of production itself, englobing several systems and their relations.|$|E

It {{examines}} black {{writers in the}} interwar period, focusing on sites of interaction between Anglophone and Francophone black writers to develop an argument about the generative potential of translation, specifically in the black diaspora. Among other influences, Edwards draws on Stuart Hall's use {{of the concept of}} articulation to develop a theoretical use of the French term <b>décalage,</b> [...] "referring to a shift in space or time or the gap that results from it...argues that these disparate locations are, like joints, sites of potential forward motion." ...|$|E
50|$|Stages of {{development}} may overlap or {{be associated with}} specific other aspects {{of development}}, such as speech or movement. Even within a particular developmental area, transition into a stage may {{not mean that the}} previous stage is completely finished. For example, in Erikson's discussion of stages of personality, this theorist suggests that a lifetime is spent in reworking issues that were originally characteristic of a childhood stage. Similarly, the theorist of cognitive development, Piaget, described situations in which children could solve one type of problem using mature thinking skills, but could not accomplish this for less familiar problems, a phenomenon he called horizontal <b>decalage.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the DuBois reference, Edwards also draws on Stuart Hall {{and the concept of}} articulation to develop a theoretical use of the French word <b>décalage,</b> [...] "referring to a shift in space or time or the gap that results from it, and applies the term to describe the way in which members of the black diaspora share similar conditions of oppression yet often find ourselves on opposite ends of the political spectrum—for example, black writers seeking solace from Jim Crow in Paris, while simultaneously Africans were struggling against French colonialism. These countering political locations create tensions within our diaspora, but Edwards does not see these sites of difference as global movement killer...instead that these disparate locations are, like joints, sites of potential forward motion." ...|$|E
5000|$|Piagetian {{accounts}} of development have been challenged on several grounds. First, as Piaget himself noted, development {{does not always}} progress in the smooth manner his theory seems to predict. <b>Décalage,</b> or progressive forms of cognitive developmental progression in a specific domain, suggest that the stage model is, at best, a useful approximation. Furthermore, {{studies have found that}} children may be able to learn concepts and capability of complex reasoning that supposedly represented in more advanced stages with relative ease (Lourenço & Machado, 1996, p. 145). [...] More broadly, Piaget's theory is [...] "domain general," [...] predicting that cognitive maturation occurs concurrently across different domains of knowledge (such as mathematics, logic, and understanding of physics or language). Piaget did not take into account variability in a child's performance notably how a child can differ in sophistication across several domains.|$|E
