5|$|The park {{is among}} the most biologically diverse of Turkey's {{national}} parks. It is the native and migratory habitat of hundreds of species of birds, mammals, plants, and marine life, some of which are entirely endemic to the park and cannot be observed anywhere <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> For these reasons, it is protected by numerous wildlife and wetland conventions, and is of great national and international importance in these areas.|$|E

5|$|The {{selection}} of Leech and Morgan for the 6 December final generated controversy, {{as they were}} the two youngest swimmers in the squad and lacked experience at open level competition. Both had competed only once at senior Australian level; Morgan had twice false started at the 1956 Australian Championships, while Leech had been too ill to compete. Australia was the favourite for the relay, having swept the medals in the individual 100-metre event; Fraser, Crapp and Leech finished first, second and third. The favouritism was even more marked because Fraser and Crapp were three seconds faster than everyone <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E
5|$|More than 80percent of Madagascar's 14,883 {{plant species}} are found nowhere <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> {{including}} five plant families. The family Didiereaceae, composed of four genera and 11 species, {{is limited to}} the spiny forests of southwestern Madagascar. Four-fifths of the world's Pachypodium species are endemic to the island. Three-fourths of Madagascar's 860 orchid species are found here alone, as are six of the world's nine baobab species. The island is home to around 170 palm species, three times as many as on all of mainland Africa; 165 of them are endemic. Many native plant species are used as herbal remedies for a variety of afflictions. The drugs vinblastine and vincristine are vinca alkaloids, used to treat Hodgkin's disease, leukemia, and other cancers, were derived from the Madagascar periwinkle. The traveler's palm, known locally as ravinala and endemic to the eastern rain forests, is highly iconic of Madagascar and is featured in the national emblem as well as the Air Madagascar logo.|$|E
5|$|To {{prevent any}} similar {{incidents}} from reoccurring, Nintendo quickly ordered the episode pulled, {{and it has}} not aired since, not even outside Japan. Maddie Blaustein, the English dub voice of Meowth, said twice on the Serebii.net forums that this episode was dubbed in the United States by 4Kids Entertainment. On the other hand, Veronica Taylor, the English voice of Ash, claimed that this episode was never dubbed and will not be dubbed, though this was contradicted again on September 25, 2016, when Eric Stuart, the English dub voice of Brock and James, said that 4Kids did indeed dub the episode. Regardless, any plans to release this episode outside Japan were abandoned after Nintendo objected, and it was never broadcast anywhere <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> Coincidentally, the episode aired around the same time Pokémon was being adapted for American audiences. 4Kids Entertainment's dub took extra precaution in bright and flashing lights in the show, using the post-1997 versions altering lighting and the frequency of flashing lights for earlier episodes of their American release.|$|E

5|$|By the mid-18th century {{smallpox}} {{was a major}} {{endemic disease}} {{everywhere in the world}} except in Australia and in several small islands. In Europe smallpox was a leading cause of death in the 18th century, killing an estimated 400,000 Europeans each year. Up to 10 percent of Swedish infants died of smallpox each year, and the death rate of infants in Russia may have been even higher. The widespread use of variolation in a few countries, notably Great Britain, its North American colonies, and China, somewhat reduced the impact of smallpox among the wealthy classes during {{the latter part of the}} 18th century, but a real reduction in its incidence did not occur until vaccination became a common practice toward the end of the 19th century. Improved vaccines and the practice of re-vaccination led to a substantial reduction in cases in Europe and North America, but smallpox remained almost unchecked everywhere <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> In the United States and South Africa a much milder form of smallpox, variola minor, was recognized just before the close of the 19th century. By the mid-20th century variola minor occurred along with variola major, in varying proportions, in many parts of Africa. Patients with variola minor experience only a mild systemic illness, are often ambulant throughout the course of the disease, and are therefore able to more easily spread disease. Infection with v. minor induces immunity against the more deadly variola major form. Thus as v. minor spread all over the USA, into Canada, the South American countries and Great Britain it became the dominant form of smallpox, further reducing mortality rates.|$|E
