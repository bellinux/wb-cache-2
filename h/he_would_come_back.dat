25|$|Minos {{appeared}} as an antagonist against Percy Jackson in The Battle of the Labyrinth, the fourth {{book in the}} Percy Jackson series by Rick Riordan. Minos appeared to be helping the character Nico di Angelo raise his sister, who died in The Titan's Curse. It was later revealed that {{he was working with}} Luke Castellan to destroy Olympus. He revealed that he only helped Nico to trick him into killing Daedalus so <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> instead of Bianca.|$|E

Another legend maintains that he threw himself into the volcano to prove to his disciples that he was immortal; he believed <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> as a god after being consumed by the fire. Horace also refers the death of Empedocles in his work Ars Poetica and admits poets the right to destroy themselves.|$|E

25|$|In late 2007, Tania {{became friends}} with Joey Henderson during the 'Ferndale Strangler' storyline and became dangerously close to {{becoming}} one of his victims after she told Alice Piper {{that he was just}} a 'boy' and she wasn't interested in dating him. When Joey overheard this, he was revealed to be the Ferndale Strangler in the 2007 Christmas cliffhanger with him preparing to strangle Tania with IV tubing inside her apartment. When Tania cut her finger with a knife, Joey panicked and put the IV line away, with her narrowly avoiding death without even knowing it. After this he stalked her in a shopping mall and hoped to kidnap her by offering her a lift but Yvonne picked her up and took her up north for Christmas. Joey missed his chance, and once again Tania avoided death unknowingly. Tania dated both Kip Denton (Will Hall) and Hone Ropata (Temuera Morrison) before she began an abusive relationship with gang member Kingi Te Wake (Te Kohe Tuhaka). Kingi left her and Tania dated Ben Goodall (Shaun Edwards-Brown), only to lose him to her mother. Ben was assaulted by a small gang of hoodlums and later it was discovered he had a brain hemorrhage. He fell brain dead and after several arguments between Yvonne and his sister Anita (Lara Fischel-Chisholm) as to whether <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> alive or not, his life support was turned off a week later. Tania was very upset over his death and she and Yvonne reunited. She rebounded with Isaac Worthington (Matt Minto) but left him when he cheated on her. In late 2010 {{she fell in love with}} Rafe Durville (Simon London) and left the country with him to Australia to start a clinic. She returned briefly in 2012 for Yvonne's birthday. In 2013, Bella Durville (Amelia Reid-Meredith) visited Tania and Rafe.|$|E

[...] In May, Minnesota Vikings head coach Brad Childress {{set up a meeting}} with Favre to discuss him possibly playing with the team. In July, Childress said Favre would not be coming out of retirement. However, in August Favre announced <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> and play for the Vikings.|$|E
500|$|Simpson in his {{adolescence}} {{was described}} as fearsome in descent by fellow Scala Wheelers club member George Shaw, who explained that if Simpson dropped behind on a climb, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> on the descent. Simpson's risk-taking on descents was evident throughout his career, crashing in four out of the seven Tours de France he competed in. Track rider Norman Sheil recalled: [...] "When racing on a banked velodrome, Simpson would sometimes ride up the advertising boards {{at the top of}} the bankings, Wall of Death-style, to please the crowds." [...] Simpson's death was attributed to his unwillingness to admit defeat ascending Mont Ventoux. He described a near-death experience during a race in 1964, the Trofeo Baracchi two-man time trial, to Vin Denson, who recalled: [...] "He said he felt peace of mind and wasn't afraid to die. He said he would have been happy dying." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, Cowan became Manchester City captain, {{succeeding}} Jimmy McMullan. During his captaincy the club reached two further FA Cup Finals. The {{first of these}} was in 1933, against Everton. During the match Cowan was up against Everton captain Dixie Dean. Both players were renowned for their heading ability. Matt Busby claimed that Cowan could [...] "head a ball as far as most of us could kick it", but Dean prevailed in the aerial battle, scoring Everton's second goal with a header. The Daily Mail observed that Dean's presence gave Cowan a dilemma: [...] "He was torn between a determination not to leave Dean {{and a desire to}} help his forwards. He broke down between the two." [...] Everton were 3–0 victors, but when Cowan received his runner's up medal from the Duke of York, he remarked that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> next year to win. True to Cowan's word, City returned to Wembley the following year. In the 1934 FA Cup Final, Cowan became the first and thus far only Manchester City player to represent the club in three FA Cup finals. He captained City to a 2–1 victory over Portsmouth. As team captain Cowan held primary responsibility for motivating his fellow players and match tactics. This was typical for a captain of his era, as managers of the period were chiefly administrators who had little input into coaching and tactics.|$|E

500|$|Depp {{signed on}} to return as Captain Jack Sparrow in September 2008, saying that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> if the script was good. Almost a year later, Disney {{announced}} that Depp would be paid $55.5 million for his role, realizing that without him the franchise would be [...] "dead and buried." [...] Geoffrey Rush expressed interest in returning to his role as Barbossa, and Bruckheimer later confirmed his presence. Rush was positive on Barbossa having lost a leg, as he considered the disability made him [...] "angrier, more forceful and resilient as a character", and {{had to work with}} the stunt team for an accurate portrayal of the limp and usage of crutch, particularly during sword fighting scenes. While the production team considered a prop pegleg to be put over Rush's leg, the tight schedule caused it to be replaced with a blue sock that was replaced digitally, with a knob on the shoe to give Rush a reference for his walk. Three other actors from the previous films returned, Kevin McNally as Joshamee Gibbs, Greg Ellis as Lt. Theodore Groves, and Damian O'Hare as Lt. Gilette. Keith Richards also had a cameo, reprising his role as Captain Teague from At World's End; he and Depp tried to persuade Mick Jagger to audition for the part of a pirate elder. Previous cast members Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley stated that they would not reprise their roles, as they wanted to be involved in different films. They both thought the storyline involving their characters had gone as far as it could. On August 1, 2009, Bill Nighy expressed his desire to return as Davy Jones, who died in the [...] saying the possibility to resurrect the character, but at the end, his inclusion was scrapped. On February 5, 2010, Mackenzie Crook also announced he would not be reprising his role of Ragetti, stating, [...] "They haven't asked me. But actually I don't mind that at all. I'm a fan of the first one especially and I think the trilogy we've made is great. I'd almost like them to leave it there." ...|$|E

2500|$|García {{flew out}} of the gate with a birdie and eagle on the first two holes. He went the first 15 holes without {{registering}} a bogey allowing him to play with the lead most of the day. However, his fortunes would change when he found the water at the 16th hole. He would lose sole ownership of the lead on this hole, and ultimately the tournament after failing to match the crucial putts made by Harrington. This marked the second time that Garcia has lost a major to Harrington going down the stretch after his playoff defeat to Harrington at the 2007 Open Championship. Curtis held at least a share of the lead until he bogeyed the final two holes on the front nine. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> and tie García briefly for the lead when he birdied the 14th hole.
