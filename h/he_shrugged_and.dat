500|$|As {{members of}} the Round Table moved into ventures outside New York City, inevitably the group drifted apart. By the early 1930s the Vicious Circle was broken. Edna Ferber said she {{realized}} it when {{she arrived at the}} Rose Room for lunch one day in 1932 and found the group's table occupied by a family from Kansas. Frank Case was asked what happened to the group. <b>He</b> <b>shrugged</b> <b>and</b> replied, [...] "What became of the reservoir at Fifth Avenue and Forty-Second Street? These things do not last forever." [...] Some {{members of the}} group remained friends after its dissolution. Parker and Benchley in particular remained close up until his death in 1945, although her political leanings did strain their relationship. Others, as the group itself would come to understand when it gathered following Woollcott's death in 1943, simply realized that they had nothing to say to one another.|$|E
2500|$|Beauclerk {{wore a white}} beaver hat when playing, the {{remainder}} of his outfit being a white shirt, nankeen breeches, a scarlet sash and white stockings. He once threw his hat down on the pitch in frustration at his inability to dismiss the obdurate batsman Tom Walker, known as [...] "Old Everlasting". Beauclerk called Walker a [...] "confounded old beast" [...] but, when Walker was asked about it afterwards, <b>he</b> <b>shrugged</b> <b>and</b> said: [...] "I don't care what he says".|$|E
2500|$|Gein's {{house and}} {{property}} {{were scheduled to}} be auctioned March 30, 1958, amid rumors the house {{was to become a}} tourist attraction. On March 27, the house was destroyed by fire. Arson was suspected, but the cause was never officially determined. When Gein learned of the incident while in detention, <b>he</b> <b>shrugged</b> <b>and</b> said, [...] "Just as well." [...] Gein's car, which he used to haul the bodies of his victims, was sold at public auction for $760 to carnival sideshow operator Bunny Gibbons. Gibbons later charged carnival goers 25Â¢ admission to see it.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>shrugged</b> his shoulders, <b>and</b> Carmintel {{glowered at}} him, speechless.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>shrugged</b> his shoulders, <b>and</b> laughed {{without any}} {{conspicuous}} mirth.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hum!" [...] said Feversham, and he {{loosened}} {{and removed}} the scarf from his head. <b>He</b> <b>shrugged</b> slightly <b>and</b> looked at Wentworth. [...] "Finissons!" [...] said he.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>shrugged</b> <b>and</b> smiled, as {{one whose}} modesty forbade {{the mention of}} conquests.|$|E
60|$|Superbly Cosimo looked {{round at}} the Court; <b>he</b> <b>shrugged,</b> <b>and</b> {{shook his head}} as if in utter pity.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>shrugged</b> <b>and</b> smiled. [...] "But proves my contention. That I {{might explain}} myself, {{you made me}} for a moment serious, set me squirming in my turn." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>shrugged</b> his {{shoulders}} <b>and</b> smiled {{a sort of}} smile of relief.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>shrugged</b> his shoulders, <b>and</b> cast Francesco's {{letter on}} to the table.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>shrugged</b> his shoulders, <b>and</b> laughed, a short, sarcastic, almost cruel laugh.|$|R
6000|$|His lordship {{surveyed}} {{him with}} an eye that was {{not by any means}} admiring. [...] "Why, if that is your wish..." [...] he began. Then <b>he</b> <b>shrugged,</b> <b>and</b> turned again to Blood.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>shrugged</b> <b>and</b> smiled whimsically. [...] "It is my way," [...] he said apologetically. [...] "Nature {{has made}} me expectant, and life, whilst showing me the folly of it, has not yet cured me." ...|$|E
60|$|Taylor stopped {{listening}} and {{glanced back at}} the location of the Tube. Mary was undersurface there. He hated to leave her, even though he couldn't see her again until the Tube was unsealed. But then <b>he</b> <b>shrugged</b> <b>and</b> followed the others.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>shrugged</b> his {{shoulders}} <b>and</b> turned his eyes elsewhere, {{but did not}} reply.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>shrugged</b> his shoulders, <b>and</b> {{his face}} {{put on a}} look of annoyance.|$|R
60|$|Then <b>he</b> <b>shrugged</b> his {{shoulders}} <b>and</b> {{pulled down the}} corners of his mouth.|$|R
6000|$|... "Monastic!" [...] quoth he, {{in a sort}} of horror, {{and looking}} as if a bad smell had {{suddenly}} been thrust under his nose. <b>He</b> <b>shrugged</b> <b>and</b> pouted and had fresh recourse to his pomander. [...] "O, well! Friars have become popes before to-day." ...|$|E
60|$|At last he {{had drawn}} her, pumped her dry, as he imagined. Indeed, indeed, he thought, {{he had been}} right {{to say she was}} not subtle. He had been a fool to have {{permitted}} himself to be intrigued by so shallow, so obvious a purpose. <b>He</b> <b>shrugged</b> <b>and</b> turned away from her.|$|E
6000|$|... "If it is Rozales, say nothing," [...] said Miguel. [...] "It will do no good; but we {{may then}} be on the watch, and if {{possible}} you might find the means to obtain a couple of revolvers for us. In which case--" [...] <b>he</b> <b>shrugged</b> <b>and</b> permitted a faint smile to flex his lips.|$|E
5000|$|Next he {{encounters}} the [...] "sweet senora" [...] (probably {{the same}} actress) {{at a table}} in an outdoor restaurant. After stumbling up the curb, he introduces himself. During the lyric, [...] "My heart went jingle jingle", Alfonso's chest pulses visibly under his vest. He asks the woman to dance, and she stands up. Alfonso is shocked to find she is a foot taller than <b>he</b> is. <b>He</b> <b>shrugs,</b> <b>and</b> proceeds to dance.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>shrugged</b> his {{shoulders}} <b>and</b> came {{to stare at}} the torrent under the bridge.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>shrugged</b> his {{shoulders}} <b>and</b> waited. She turned towards the servant who presently appeared.|$|R
6000|$|... "What I {{may have}} promised," [...] said his lordship, [...] "your own conduct makes it {{difficult}} to perform." [...] He rose. [...] "You did me a service, Captain Blood, and I had hoped that we might be friends. But since you prefer to have it otherwise...." [...] <b>He</b> <b>shrugged,</b> <b>and</b> waved a hand towards the Deputy-Governor.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps I do," [...] said Wellington. [...] "But what am I to do {{with you}} now?" [...] <b>He</b> <b>shrugged,</b> <b>and</b> strode towards the window. [...] "You had better go home, O'Moy. Your health has {{suffered}} out here, and you are not equal to the heat of summer that is now increasing. That is the reason of this resignation. You understand?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>shrugged,</b> <b>and</b> {{there was}} {{contempt}} in {{the lines of}} his mouth. He distrusted Arcolano, the regular cleric who was my mother's confessor and spiritual adviser, exerting over her a very considerable influence. She, herself, had admitted that it was this Arcolano who had induced her to that horrid traffic in my father's life and liberty which she was mercifully spared from putting into effect.|$|E
60|$|Granet hesitated, {{but only}} for a moment. Then <b>he</b> <b>shrugged</b> his {{shoulders}} <b>and</b> turned away.|$|R
60|$|When Reff Ritter {{heard about}} the {{accidents}} <b>he</b> <b>shrugged</b> his shoulders <b>and</b> tossed his head.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>shrugged</b> his shoulders, <b>and</b> murmured {{something}} very uncomplimentary anent the ultimate destination of those neighbours.|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>shrugged</b> <b>and</b> smiled. [...] "It {{has been}} alleged against me on occasion. But I {{think it was}} pure spite." [...] Then {{he waved his hand}} towards the long seat that stood {{at the back of the}} arbor. [...] "Will your ladyship not sit? You will forgive that I urge it in my own interest. They tell me that it is not good for me to stand too long just yet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir!" [...] Lord Julian's {{voice was}} harsh as a rasp, his eyes flashed. Instinctively he swung {{a hand to}} the place where his sword habitually hung. Then <b>he</b> <b>shrugged</b> <b>and</b> sneered: [...] "Of course," [...] said he, [...] "it sorts with all I have heard of Spanish honour and all that I have seen of yours that you should insult a man who is unarmed and your prisoner." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{swept the}} {{consideration}} aside by a contemptuous, almost angry gesture. [...] "Does that matter? I am {{concerned with what}} is to become of you. I was born for your service, my princess, and the service being rendered..." [...] <b>He</b> <b>shrugged</b> <b>and</b> smiled, threw out his hands and let them fall again to his sides in an eloquent gesture. He was the complete courtier, the knight-errant, the romantic preux-chevalier all in one.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Bennet, {{followed}} by Bennet, {{are entering the}} room. <b>He</b> <b>shrugs</b> his shoulders <b>and</b> turns away.|$|R
60|$|WILLIS: 'I don't {{know what}} you're up to.' <b>He</b> <b>shrugs</b> his {{shoulders}} <b>and</b> {{walks up the}} room.|$|R
60|$|Da Souza was {{no longer}} cringing. <b>He</b> <b>shrugged</b> his {{shoulders}} <b>and</b> thrust his fat little hands into his trousers pockets.|$|R
