40|$|A {{nitrogen}} <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> was designed, {{built and}} {{tested for the}} purpose of providing a thermal shunt between the two stages of a Gifford-McMahan (GM) cryocooler during cooldown. The nitrogen <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> has an operating temperature range between 63 and 123 K. While the <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> is in the temperature range during the system cooldown, it acts as a thermal shunt {{between the first and second}} stage of the cryocooler. The <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> increases the <b>heat</b> transfer to the first stage of the cryocooler, thereby reducing the cooldown time of the system. When the <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> temperature drops below the triple point, the nitrogen working fluid freezes, effectively stopping the <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> operation. A small heat leak between cryocooler stages remains because of axial conduction along the <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> wall. As long as the <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> remains below 63 K, the <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> remains inactive. <b>Heat</b> <b>pipe</b> performance limits were measured and the optimum fluid charge was determined...|$|R

40|$|The {{principal}} {{objective of this}} program was to demonstrate technology {{that will make a}} sodium <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> tolerant of hydrogen permeation for a bimodal space reactor application. Special focus was placed on techniques which enhance the permeation of hydrogen out of the <b>heat</b> <b>pipe.</b> Specific objectives include: define the detailed requirements for the bimodal reactor application; design and fabricate a prototype <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> tolerant of hydrogen permeation; and test the prototype <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> and demonstrate that hydrogen which permeates into the <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> is removed or reduced to acceptable levels. The results of the program were fully successful. Analyses were performed on two different <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> designs and an experimental <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> was fabricated and tested. A model of the experimental <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> was developed to predict the enhancement in the hydrogen permeation rate out of the <b>heat</b> <b>pipe.</b> A significant improvement in the rate at which hydrogen permeates out of a <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> was predicted {{for the use of the}} special condenser geometry developed here.

25|$|Copper and {{aluminium}} {{are used}} as heat sinks and <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> in electronic cooling applications. A heat sink is a passive component that cools semiconductor and optoelectronic devices by dissipating heat into the surrounding air. Heat sinks have temperatures higher than their surrounding environments so that heat can be transferred into the air by convection, radiation, and conduction.|$|E
25|$|A {{heat pipe}} {{typically}} {{consists of a}} sealed pipe or tube at both the hot and cold ends. <b>Heat</b> <b>pipes</b> utilize evaporative cooling to transfer thermal energy from one point to another by the evaporation and condensation of a working fluid or coolant. They are fundamentally better at heat conduction over larger distances than heat sinks because their effective thermal conductivity is several orders of magnitude {{greater than that of}} the equivalent solid conductor.|$|E
25|$|The station's {{systems and}} {{experiments}} consume {{a large amount}} of electrical power, almost all of which converts to heat. Little of this heat dissipates through the walls of the station. To keep the internal ambient temperature within comfortable, workable limits, ammonia is continuously pumped through pipes throughout the station to collect heat, then into external radiators to emit infrared radiation, then back into the station. Thus this passive thermal control system (PTCS) is made of external surface materials, insulation such as MLI, and <b>heat</b> <b>pipes.</b>|$|E
40|$|This work used {{experimental}} methods to study heat transfer behavior inside a <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> {{and found that}} heat transfer behavior inside the <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> was changed due to its integration with cooling plates. This change caused the <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> to have copper-like heat transfer behavior.

A commercial CPU <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> cooler was also used as reference object in this work. Integration of the <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> with cooling plates causes the <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> to have the copper-like heat transfer behavior.

2500|$|Rotary engines have {{a problem}} not found in {{reciprocating}} piston four-stroke engines in that the block housing has intake, compression, combustion, and exhaust occurring at fixed locations around the housing. In contrast, reciprocating engines perform these four strokes in one chamber, so that extremes of [...] "freezing" [...] intake and [...] "flaming" [...] exhaust are averaged and shielded by a boundary layer from overheating working parts. The use of <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> in an air-cooled Wankel was proposed by the University of Florida to overcome this uneven heating of the block housing. Pre-heating of certain housing sections with exhaust gas improved performance and fuel economy, also reducing wear and emissions.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike a piston engine, {{in which}} the {{cylinder}} is heated by the combustion process and then cooled by the incoming charge, Wankel rotor housings are constantly heated {{on one side and}} cooled on the other, leading to high local temperatures and unequal thermal expansion. While this places great demands on the materials used, the simplicity of the Wankel makes it easier to use alternative materials, such as exotic alloys and ceramics. With water cooling in a radial or axial flow direction, and the hot water from the hot bow heating the cold bow, the thermal expansion remains tolerable. Top engine temperature has been reduced to , with a maximum temperature difference between engine parts of [...] by the use of <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> around the housing and in side plates as a cooling means.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Separate type <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> <b>heat</b> {{exchangers}} {{are often}} used for large-scale heat exchanging. The arrangement of such a heat exchanger conveniently allows heat input to and output from the heat exchanger at remote locations. The traditional method of designing an ordinary HPHE (<b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger) is commonly applied in the separate type exchanger design, but the calculations have {{to be carried out}} separately, which makes it very complicated. In this work, the ε-NTU (effectiveness-Number of Transfer Units) method was applied for optimization analysis of single- or multi-level separate type <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> <b>heat</b> exchangers. An optimizing formula for single-level separate type <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> <b>heat</b> exchangers was obtained. The optimizing principles of effec-tiveness-NTU and heat transfer rate by the equal distribution method for multi-level separate type <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger are presented. The design of separate type <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> <b>heat</b> exchangers by the optimizing method is more convenient and faster than by the traditional method...|$|R
