40|$|A {{traditional}} mulching {{technique used}} in Lanzarote, Canary Islands, allows dry fanning {{as well as}} pronounced water savings in irrigation. It is known to reduce evaporational losses, but is also supposed to enhance the nocturnal condensation of water vapour from the atmosphere. The mulch layer consists of porous volcanic rock fragments abundantly available on the island. The mulched surface is believed to cool rapidly and to be more hygroscopic than a bare soil surface. This was investigated during a field experiment conducted over 68 nights during different seasons in 2001 and 2002, {{as well as some}} simple laboratory measurements. It was found that nocturnal condensation on the mulch surface (max 0. 33 mm) was lower than on the bare soil surface (max 0. 57 mm) or any one of three alternative mulch substrates. However, a slightly stronger nocturnal cooling of the mulched as compared to the bare surface was present. It is shown that these contrary findings {{can be explained by the}} higher hygroscopicity of the dry loam soil, resulting in condensation gains beyond the strict definition of dew. Differences in plant-availability of non-hygroscopic dew water and hygroscopic water uptakes are discussed, and conditions under which mulching would show positive condensation effects are defined. This includes a theoretical section demonstrating that non-hygroscopic mulch layers of a proper thickness can provide small amounts of <b>dew</b> to <b>plant</b> roots at the mulch-soil interface. This condensation could also happen during the day and would be favoured by a high amplitude of the diurnal atmospheric moisture cycle. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Harvesting dew {{can be used}} as a {{renewable}} complementary {{source of}} water both for drinking and agriculture in specific arid or semi-arid water-stressed areas. Condensation of water vapor by nighttime radiative cooling is the phenomenon that can be explained the <b>dew</b> formation on <b>plants</b> or surfaces. In this paper, we propose the lawsonite mineral, as a potential radiative cooling material, for exploiting this natural phenomenon. Furthermore, a computer model that includes meteorological parameters, obtained from the coastal region of Southern Morrocco (Mirleft-South of Agadir), is used to determine the thermal balance and fit to dew mass evolution. In order to form global estimates of dew formation potential via our dew formation model, we combined different meteorological data with radiative properties of natural lawsonite condenser (CaAl 2 Si 2 O 7 (OH) 2 Â·H 2 O) to enhance the modelled dew yield. The daily modelled yields show that significant amounts of dew water can be calculated as a function of the condenser temperature, the thickness condenser as well as the wind speed.

The experiment was in situ carried out during the growing season from mid-May through mid-October in a mire wetland where Carex lasiocarpa is the dominant <b>plant.</b> <b>Dew</b> was measured by using four different kinds of collectors which were glass, poplar woodstick, sunflower stick and filter paper, respectively.

Dew began to condense from one and a half hour after sunset and Dew Intensity reached the peak at about half an hour before sunrise. The factual Dewfall in unit field area was calculated by the factors of leaf area index, Dew Days, Dew Intensity, etc. Based on the synchronous meteorological factors, a stepwise linearmulti-variation regression model was established to predict Dew Intensity.

Inoculum density, <b>dew</b> period, and <b>plant</b> height are factors influencing biocontrol of S. zeylanica with this indigenous pathogen. Significantly higher percent reductions in plant height and dry weight were obtained and all plants were killed at higher inoculum concentrations with 8 h of dew. The number, germination, and virulence of conidia were significantly affected by production techniques, temperature, light condition, and incubation period. Exposure to continuous near-ultraviolet (NUV) light at 28 $ sp circ$C stimulated sporulation on agar media and on solid substrates. Overall, the best production technique was the use of sorghum seeds using an equal quantity of sorghum seeds and water (w/v) incubated for four weeks. Another conidia production method using the sporulation medium (S-medium) technique was evaluated with the addition of 20 g L$ sp{- 1 }$ of calcium carbonate (CaCO$ sb 3) $ and 2 ml of sterile distilled water. Primary 1 / 2 PDA at 18 $ sp circ$C in the dark produced the most virulent conidia. This technique produced conidia relatively rapid, but was labour intensive.

40|$|Background: Pesticide use {{continues}} to be a serious public health problem in developing countries, despite decades of safe pesticide use strategies. In Nicaragua, organophosphate insecticides, in particular chlorpyrifos and methamidophos are responsible for about half of the acute pesticide poisonings. Contamination of the skin occurs frequently in the occupational setting. There is extensive research to improve methods to assess dermal exposure. The applicability and feasibility of such methods in developing countries is uncertain. Aim: This thesis aims at increasing the understanding of risk factors underlying exposure, evaluating dermal exposure among Nicaraguan subsistence farmers, and proposing more suitable methods for developing country conditions. Methods: A group of 29 subsistence farmers were interviewed in four focus groups and their responses were analyzed using grounded theory. Field data for semi-quantitative and quantitative exposure measurements of 31 farmers were collected during 33 pesticide applications, using observation, supplementary video recording, a fluorescent tracer, and skin wiping. A visual scoring system developed in the US was modified into a Nicaraguan Visual Scoring System suitable for developing country conditions. Pesticides were traced during application. Skin fluorescence was videotaped in a foldaway darkened room which was later measured through Body Segment Scores (BSS), Contaminated Body Area (CBA) and Total Visual Score (TVS). TVS was used as a criterion indicator for the identification of main exposure determinants by observation. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. Hundred and ten potential exposure determinants were reduced to 27 variables grouped as worksite, spray equipment, work practices, clothing, and hygiene practices. Reliability of the visual score was tested with intraclass correlation coefficients, in a sub-sample of five farmers evaluated by five raters. Observations of hand exposure events (direct and indirect contacts) were summarized into a Concentrate Contamination Index (CCI) and a Solution Contamination Index (SCI). Chemical residues were quantified for the hands and selected body parts according to fluorescent intensities. Spearman rank correlation coefficients were computed to compare the observational indices (CCI+SCI), fluorescent visual scores and quantitative residues. Results: Reasons for unsafe practices were connected with poverty, inadequacy of personal protective equipment, climatic factors, and limited knowledge influenced by beliefs and traditions. Farmers felt affection towards their traditional crops and this relationship seemed to have strong meanings for pest removal and pesticide use, contributing to dangerous work practices. The observed fluorescent images on the skin of farmers reflected work practices and contamination mechanisms and pathways. Novel determinants included spraying on a muddy terrain, <b>dew</b> on <b>plants,</b> sealing of tank lids with a cloth, and wiping sweat from the face. The Visual Scoring System was highly consistent (Cronbach alpha = 0. 96) and reasonably reliable (0. 75; 95 % CI: 0. 62 - 0. 83), with scoring of extent being more reliable than scoring of intensity. The highest CBA was 66 % and the farmer with the highest TVS scored 60 % of the maximum possible. Hands were most frequently contaminated and the back had the highest BSS. Hand contact was most frequently indirect, by touching contaminated surfaces. All farmers had quantifiable pesticide residues on their hands. Spearman correlation coefficients between the observational contamination scores, fluorescent visual scores and residues in relation to the hands ranged from 0. 65 to 0. 74 for chlorpyrifos and 0. 62 to 0. 87 for methamidophos. Differences in scores could be explained by limitations of the different methods. Conclusions: Poverty and cultural factors contribute to pesticide use and unsafe use conditions. Education programs should be culturally appropriate to achieve pesticide exposure reduction. Each method studied in this thesis can be used independently. However, they can also complement each other, providing {{a better understanding of the}} mechanisms of skin exposure. With further improvements, a combination of observation and fluorescent visual scoring techniques, both lowcost and practical, would become highly accessible methods for surveillance and for epidemiological studies in developing countries...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MScAgric (Soil Science)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2005. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} and identify the occurrence of specific soil properties that may be important for vegetation functioning and the possible effect of the loss of or changes in these properties on rehabilitation success on the sandy coastal plains of the West Coast, South Africa. The study area covered approximately 9 400 ha on the Namaqualand coast in the vicinity of Brand-se-Baai (31 º 18 'S 17 º 54 'E), approximately 350 km north of Cape Town and 70 km north-west of the nearest town, Lutzville. A soil survey was done to reveal the presence of important pedological features. The 20 soil profiles surveyed are situated within six vegetation communities. Pedological features such as surface water repellency, permeable apedal subsurface horizons, subsurface impediments such as cemented (calcrete or dorbank) hardpans and significantly more clayey (cutanic, luvic) horizons were identified. A comparative study between rehabilitated and natural soils indicates that mining operations result in the formation of saline sand tailings, stripped of a large portion of the clay and organic matter fraction. The natural leaching of solutes, over a period of 25 months, is sufficient to lower salinity of the tailings to levels comparable to natural soils. This leaching can also results in lowering of soil fertility. Removal of the dorbank and the dense neocutanic horizon in the western side of the mine, loss of topographical features such as small dune systems and heuweltjies, destruction of natural soil profile morphology and the lowering of organic carbon and clay plus silt fraction can have detrimental effects on attempts at rehabilitation of this area to a natural condition similar to that which preceded the mining operation. Infiltration fingering and deep percolation results in the development of an aquifer below the reach of shallow-rooted desert shrubs. A method of water acquisition by vegetation through water distillation is investigated as a possible solution to the apparent discontinuum between the shallow root systems and deeper-lying aquifer. Volumetric water content measurements indicated that precipitation of 29. 5 mm, over a period of 10 days, did not result in any variation at 235 mm, 360 mm and 900 mm depths. An average volumetric water content increase of 0. 4 mm per night was measured in the first 23. 5 cm of soil surface. This amount is a significant source of water that can explain the shallow root distribution. Water vapour movement due to temperature gradients can explain the diurnal volumetric water content fluctuations observed. Further studies are necessary to determine to what extent the depth of water infiltration influences the capacity of subsurface <b>dew</b> to provide <b>plants</b> with a nocturnal water source. Findings of this study can be summarised into two concepts namely: • Heuweltjies, small dune systems, and variation in depth of cemented hardpans are the main features that contribute to pedosphere variation and possibly to biodiversity. • Pedogenic features such as topsoil hydrophobicity, and cemented dorbank and dense more clayey (cutanic, luvic) subsurface horizons are important components of a soil water distillation process that could be a driving force behind vegetation functioning in this region. Mine activities result in the loss of certain pedogenic features and soil properties that that could be key ingredients to ecosystem functioning. The inability to recognise their significance and ignorance thereof when planning rehabilitation methods might prevent sustainable restoration of the environment...|$|R
