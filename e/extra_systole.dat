30|$|Singh and Dutta [50] used time, probability, and {{spectrogram}} for automatic {{analysis of}} PCG for cardiac disorders. Barma [51] considered decomposition method called Hilbert Vibration Decomposition (HVD) along with time-frequency representation of smoothed pseudo Wigner-Ville distribution (SPWVD) for detection of third heart sound. HVD was proposed {{to overcome the}} limitations associated with Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT). HHT is unable to separate low-energy noise from heart sound which has major energy in low frequency spectrum. It also generates low amplitudes at low frequency which has no physical interpretation. In another work, Zhang et al. [52] proposed a method based on spectrogram and partial least squares regression to classify heart sound into normal, murmur, extra heart sound, <b>extra</b> <b>systole,</b> and artifacts. In an extension of this work [53], authors employed a number of machine learning algorithms for classification of heart sounds.|$|E
40|$|Theileriosis is an {{important}} protozoal disease of domestic ruminants especially cattle, sheep and goats which is transmitted by various species of Theileria infected ticks. Anemia, electrolytic disorders and vasculitis are amongst the cardiovascular complications of theileriosis. In this study, 90 cows with theileriosis were evaluated by clinical examination, parasitologic tests and electrocardiography. In Theileria infected cattle, after 30 minutes of rest and any treatment, a 30 second ECG was recorded in lead I to determine the types of arrhythmias present. Based on electrocardiographic findings frequently observed arrhythmias included 62 cases of sinus tachycardia, 15 cases of sinus arrhythmia, 6 cases of first degree atrio-ventricular block, 1 case of ventricular <b>extra</b> <b>systole</b> and 1 case of atrial fibrillation. According {{to the type of}} arrhythmias, it can be concluded that arrhythmias in cows with theileriosis are functional and nonpathologic...|$|E

40|$|A 30 {{year old}} patient {{presented}} {{to us with}} recurrent episodes of palpitation and documented tachycardia. In all his presentations a wide QRS tachycardia was recorded. The baseline ECG showed pre excitation. The 12 lead ECG of the tachycardia and the baseline ECG is shown in Fig.   1 A. During EP study the patient had baseline pre excitation and the HV interval was 16  ms. A duo-decapolar halo (HL) catheter was used to map right atrium and a decapolar coronary sinus (CS) catheter was used to map coronary sinus. In addition a His bundle and right ventricular (RV) quadripolar catheters were used. The delta wave morphology was suggestive of a posteroseptal pathway. Ventricular pacing from RV apex showing central decremental conduction with ventriculo-atrial Wenkebach at 290  ms. Ventricular extrastimulation also showed decremental conduction and VA block at S 1 S 2 of 400, 240. The intra cardiac recording of tachycardia and its initiation is shown in Fig.   1 B. Pacing from lateral RA (HL 5, 6 electrodes) showed progressive pre excitation with extrastimulation and induction of tachycardia. The QRS morphology was same as the patient's clinical tachycardia and the tachycardia cycle length (TCL) was 304  ms. An atrial entrainment protocol showed entrainment with the same QRS morphology while pacing from right atrium.

40|$|Tea {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular {{beverages}} having a great beneficial effect on human health. This is because of the tea contains a lot of worthy compounds consist of polyphenol, theophiline, flavoniod/methylxanthine, tannin, vitamin C and E, catechin, and some mineral such as Zn, Se, Mo, Ge, Mg. However, tea also contains an undesirable compound called caffeine. This compound can cause some undesirable reactions such as insomnia, nervous, delirium, tachycardia, <b>extra</b> <b>systole,</b> respiratory increase, tremor, and dieresis. In order to reduce negative effect of caffeine, general method have been applied for reducing caffeine content by using solvent extraction and supercritical extraction with CO 2. This research was focused on production of low caffeine content tea using extraction with ethyl acetate as solvent. Specifically, this research was conducted in order to study the effect of temperature and time on reduction of caffeine content to obtain optimum condition of production of low caffeine content tea, to carried out organoleptic test to check the flavor of low caffeine content tea, and to make a mathematical modeling for extraction of caffeine from tea. Experimental works were executed in 10 runs with operation time (63, 4 – 176, 6 minutes) and temperature (45, 8 - 74, 1 °C) as the independent variable. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) was used to analyze the caffeine content.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study is to assess the risk of {{inducing}} rhythm disturbances of the heart during colonoscopy. Patients and methods used: 80 patients had undergone colonoscopyper formed by two experienced specialists of endoscopy for the period from March to December 2011. The endoscopies were performed without premedication and sedation. Holter was placed on each patient one hour before the endoscopic examination, and the record continued one hour after the manipulation. The blood pressure was measured before, during and after the procedure. Results: During colonoscopy 25 patients (31, 25 %) manifested rhythm disorders. In 15 patients (18, 75 %) sinus tachycardia occurred. In 7 patients (8, 75 %) suptraventricular <b>extra</b> <b>systoles</b> were observed and in 3 patients (3, 75 %) - ventricular <b>extra</b> <b>systoles.</b> No ST-T changes were found. Highest values of the blood pressure were measured before and during the endoscopy, but the values did not exceed 160 / 105 mmHg. In 10 patients (12, 5 %) a hypotensive reaction was observed, bur the values were not lower than 80 / 50. In 2 patients there was a short bradycardia with a heart frequency 50 - 55 /min. Conclusions: Our results showed that the rhythm disorders during lower colonoscopy occur in approximately 1 / 3 of the examined patients, there is an increase or decrease of the blood pressure in some patients, but that doesn’t require physician’s aid and the examination can be carried out safely without monitoring...|$|R
40|$|Thin trabeculae were {{dissected}} {{from the}} right ventricle of guinea-pig heart and stimulated to contract isometrically at 0. 5 Hz (26 degrees C). Rapid and transient changes of force were obtained by inducing three <b>extra</b> <b>systoles</b> (ES 1 - 3) at 450 -ms intervals. The two regular contractions (P 1 - 2) following (ES 1 - 3) were potentiated. Fura- 2 salt was microinjected into the preparation to monitor intracellular calcium ([Ca 2 +]i). Three distinct phases of [Ca 2 +]i were seen: (1) a rapid rising phase to about 200 nmol L(- 1), (2) a slower rising phase to a peak at 400 nmol L(- 1), and (3) a slow decline to about 50 nmol L(- 1). During ES 1, there was a discrepancy between force, which decreased, and peak [Ca 2 +]i, which increased to 600 nmol L(- 1). It {{is likely that the}} increased [Ca 2 +]i during the <b>extra</b> <b>systoles</b> reflects increased sarcolemmal calcium inflow, causing post-extra-systolic potentiation. Ryanodine (1 - 2 microM) was added to inhibit the intracellular calcium release and thus reduce the intracellular [Ca 2 +]i gradients following excitation. Ryanodine inhibited phase 1 of [Ca 2 +]i and abolished post-extra-systolic potentiation. There was a close relationship between dF/dt and [Ca 2 +]i with ryanodine during control and ES 1 - 3. It is likely that fura- 2 reports a spatially averaged [Ca 2 +]i and that phase 1 of the signal therefore apparently underestimates activator calcium in the close vicinity of the contractile elements...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the use of prophylactic magnesium sulphate and amiodarone in treating arrhythmias that may occur following coronary bypass grafting operations. Methods The study population consisted of 192 consecutive patients who were undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Sixty-four patients were given 3 g of magnesium sulphate (MgSO 4) [20 ml = 24. 32 mEq/L Mg + 2] in 100 cc of isotonic 0. 9 % solution over 2 hours intravenously at the following times: 12 hours prior to the operation, immediately following the operation, and on postoperative days 1, 2, and 3 (Group 1). Another group of 64 patients was given a preoperative infusion of amiodarone (1200 mg) on first post-operative day (Group 2). After the operation amiodarone was administered orally at a dose of 600 mg/day. Sixty-four patients in group 3 (control group) had 100 cc. isotonic 0. 9 % as placebo, during the same time periods. Results In the postoperative period, the magnesium values were significantly higher in Group 1 than in Group 2 for all measurements. The use of amiodarone for total arrhythmia was significantly more effective than prophylactic treatment with magnesium sulphate (p = 0. 015). There was no difference between the two drugs in preventing supraventricular arrhythmia, although amiodarone significantly delayed the revealing time of atrial fibrillation (p = 0. 026). Ventricular arrhythmia, in the form of ventricular <b>extra</b> <b>systole,</b> was more common in the magnesium prophylaxis group. The two groups showed no significant differences in other operative or postoperative measurements. No side effects of the drugs were observed. Conclusion Prophylactic use of magnesium sulphate and amiodarone are both effective at preventing arrhythmia that may occur following coronary by-pass operations. Magnesium sulphate should be used in prophylactic treatment since it may decrease arrhythmia at low doses. If arrhythmia should occur despite this treatment, intervention with amiodarone may be preferable. </p...|$|E
40|$|SA node dysfunction, or {{known as}} Sick Sinus Syndrome {{is the common}} cause of disrythmia and {{can be caused by}} {{intrinsic}} and extrinsic factors of the SA node. The diagnose performed by the occurrence of bradi- takhikardia episode and the clinical symptoms, could be syncope, palpitation, or maybe asymptomatic. Some of the literature defined that the perioperative management of sick sinus syndrome is preoperative insertion of pacemaker (transcutaneal or transvenous pacing). A 75 years old man underwent laparotomy with diffuse peritonitis caused by gastric perforation. In preoperative clinical evaluation the patients revealed full awake (compos mentis), with history of uncontrolled hypertension. In physical exammination a severe bradicardia was found with pulse of 31 x/minute, and the blood pressure was 190 / 100 mmHg. In this rural hospital there was no fascility to insert the pace-maker. The organ perfusion was considered to be optimal from clinical evaluation (proved by the wakefullness, SpO 2 99 %, and diuresis 1 cc/kgBW after optimalization). The chest X’ray showed a cardiomegali without the sign of pulmonary congestion. The laboratory test were within normal limit including the renal function test (creatinin; 0, 97 mg/dl, and ureum 82, 6 mg/dl). We decided to perform general anesthesia in this procedure. Before the induction while patient still awake, fentanyl 2 µg/kgBW was given intravenously. Fifteen menue after fentanyl administration induction of anesthesia performed and initiated with propofol intravenous injection slowly until patients felt asleep, than intubated after muscle relaxant intravenous reached the onset After intubation the pulse / heart rate of patients rose to 44 – 90 x/minute.

40|$|Aim. To {{evaluate}} {{effects of}} broncholytic therapy on ventricular rhythm disorders and high resolution electrocardiogram indices {{in patients with}} {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). Material and methods. 144 patients (54 women and 90 men; aged 47, 1 ± 1, 5 y. o.) with COPD and 35 patients of control group without respiratory and cardiovascular diseases (23 men and 12 women; aged 42, 4 ± 2, 8 y. o.) were examined. 24 -hour ECG monitoring and high resolution ECG with time and spectral-time mapping of ventricular ECG complex were performed in patients additionally to routine examination. Results. Reduction of ventricular rhythm disorders rate was detected during therapy with extended-release theophylline or salmeterol/fluticasone in patients with moderate and severe COPD. This effect was more significant for salmeterol/fluticasone treatment. Treatment with extended-release theophylline led to increase of a number of ventricular <b>extra</b> <b>systoles</b> in patients with severe COPD. Salmeterol/fluticasone treatment did not influence number of ventricular extrasystoles. Broncholytic therapy had positive influence on processes of ventricular depolarization. It was shown by high resolution ECG indicators improvement and by late ventricular potential rate reduction. Conclusion. Salmeterol/fluticasone combination is more reasonable than extended-release theophylline for broncholytic therapy in patients with severe COPD and ventricular rhythm disorders. </p...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} supplemental oxygen on cardiac rhythm during gastroscopy, 103 patients aged over 60 were randomised to receive either supplemental oxygen or air at 2 litres/minute during the procedure. Pulse rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and a Holter cardiac trace were monitored before, during, and for one hour after the gastroscopy. A wide range of electrocardiographic abnormalities were recorded in both oxygen and air groups, of which ventricular and supraventricular ectopic beats were the most common. There {{were no significant differences}} in the rate of occurrence of any clinically important cardiac abnormality either between the oxygen and air groups or between the three monitored periods before, during, and after gastroscopy. There were significantly fewer patients, however, with supraventricular <b>extra</b> <b>systoles</b> when oxygen was given during gastroscopy (p < 0. 05). Although supplemental oxygen during gastroscopy significantly improved oxygen saturation (p < 0. 001; 95 % confidence intervals for the difference between the means: 2. 9 to 4. 7), there was no correlation between oxygen saturation and any electrocardiographic changes. It is concluded that electrocardiographic abnormalities are common in patients over 60, but this study found no evidence that they are induced by gastroscopy.

40|$|A {{pulmonary}} early systolic {{sound was}} investigated in 50 patients.

Potain (1900) described systolic gallop rhythm when the extra sound was loudest in the aortic area in cases of aortic atheroma and in typhoid fever, and he attributed this sound to the sudden checking of aortic expansion. Wolferth and Margolies (1940) {{came to the conclusion that}} this description concerned a rare mid-systolic sound. Gallavardin (1913) described late, occasionally mid-systolic, clicking sounds, different in quality from the heart sounds, usually loudest at the apex and varying with the phase of respiration; he considered them of extracardiac origin and found pleuro-pericardial adhesions in three cases. Subsequent authors including Lian and Deparis (1933), Johnston (1938), and Evans (1943) confirmed that mid or late systolic clicks were of no significance except in differential diag-nosis. An exception is the systolic clicking sound in cases of mediastinal emphysema and left-sided pneumothorax (Hamman, 1937; Scadding and Wood, 1939). Mid or late systolic clicks or sounds, or " gallops " will not be considered in this paper...|$|R
