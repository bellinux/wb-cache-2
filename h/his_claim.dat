5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} by writer Dilip Sakar that Lock was shot down by the German ace Oberleutnant Johann Schmid from Jagdgeschwader 26 near Calais since {{he was the only}} German pilot to make a claim. However, Lock was posted missing on an early morning sortie. The war diary for JG 26 shows that Schmid made <b>his</b> <b>claim</b> at 18:32 in the evening and that the location of <b>his</b> <b>claim</b> was not listed in Schmid's combat report.|$|E

5|$|Henry I of Jerusalem came to Antioch {{to mediate}} {{a peace treaty}} in early 1195.

5|$|In 1340, {{following}} {{the extinction of}} the House of Capet, Edward III claimed the French throne. In addition to initiating the Hundred Years' War, Edward III expressed <b>his</b> <b>claim</b> in heraldic form by quartering the royal arms of England with the Arms of France. This quartering continued until 1801, with intervals in 1360–1369 and 1420–1422.|$|E
5|$|In the Treaty of Paris (1259), the English king {{formally}} surrendered <b>his</b> <b>claim</b> to the duchy and ducal title, {{and since}} then the islands have been internally self-governing territories of the English crown and latterly the British crown.|$|E
5|$|Maximilian of Habsburg renounced <b>his</b> <b>claim</b> to Hungary in the Peace of Pressburg on 7 November 1491.

In the same year, Ernuszt and Ladislaus Kanizsai were jointly appointed Bans of Croatia, Dalmatia and Slavonia.|$|E

25|$|Harry Cohen {{announced}} he would not stand for re-election. He said the strain caused by the criticism over his expenses, and the formal investigation into <b>his</b> <b>claims,</b> were the main factors behind his departure.

5|$|On 28 April 2015, the Augsburger Allgemeine, a German {{regional}} daily newspaper, {{published an}} article stating that according to Erich Bäcker, Lützow attempted an emergency landing at Donaumünster/Erlingshofen and crashed into the Danube. Bäcker made <b>his</b> <b>claim</b> based on reports made by eye-witnesses who saw a low flying Me262 crashing into the Danube that day.|$|E
5|$|Talks {{began on}} 30 April 1634, and the Treaty of Polyanovka {{was signed in}} May, {{putting an end to}} hostilities. The treaty {{confirmed}} the pre-war status quo, with Russia paying a large war indemnity (20,000 rubles in gold), while Władysław agreed to surrender <b>his</b> <b>claim</b> to the Russian throne and return the royal insignia to Moscow. Jasienica notes that from the Russian perspective it was likely that Władysław's abnegation of <b>his</b> <b>claim</b> was more important, in terms of the subsequent increase in internal stability, than the loss of disputed borderland. Despite not winning militarily, the Russians may have scored a diplomatic triumph. Other authors, such as Hellie, support this interpretation.|$|E
5|$|Willem Janszoon {{returned}} to the Netherlands apparently {{in the belief that}} the south coast of New Guinea was joined to the land along which he sailed, although his own chart did not verify <b>his</b> <b>claim</b> to have continuously followed the coastline where the Torres Strait is found.|$|E

5|$|After Alfred's {{death in}} 899, Æthelwold disputed the throne with Alfred's son, Edward the Elder. As senior ætheling (prince {{of the royal}} dynasty {{eligible}} for kingship), Æthelwold had a strong claim to the throne. He attempted to raise an army to support <b>his</b> <b>claim,</b> {{but was unable to}} get sufficient support to meet Edward in battle and fled to Viking-controlled Northumbria, where he was accepted as king. In 901 or 902 he sailed with a fleet to Essex, where he was also accepted as king.|$|E
5|$|After {{becoming}} a cause célèbre {{from the late}} 1960s to the 1980s, the mythical Priory of Sion was exposed as a ludibrium created by Plantard {{as a framework for}} <b>his</b> <b>claim</b> of being the Great Monarch prophesied by Nostradamus. Evidence presented in support of its historical existence and activities before 1956 was discovered to have been forged and then planted in various locations around France by Plantard and his accomplices. Nevertheless, many conspiracy theorists still persist in believing that the Priory of Sion is an age-old cabal that conceals a subversive secret.|$|E
5|$|Around 1968, Clarence13X fathered a {{son with}} a young convert named Gusavia. That year, Gloria Steinem {{published}} an article about Clarence13X in New York magazine.

Clarence13X also received coverage from international media, including a Canadian television program.|$|E

5|$|Arthur {{was murdered}} (allegedly by John), {{and his sister}} Eleanor would {{spend the rest of}} her life in captivity. John's {{behaviour}} drove a number of French barons to side with Philip, and the resulting rebellions by Norman and Angevin barons ended John's control of his continental possessions—the de facto end of the Angevin Empire, although Henry III would maintain <b>his</b> <b>claim</b> until 1259.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in October 2004, the Writers Guild of America, west {{conducted}} arbitration {{through the}} scripts {{that had been}} written since Barry Levinson developed the film at Warner Bros. in 1987. Lewis Colick, James Toback and Tom Epperson disassociated themselves for credit by the WGA. The Guild justified credit to Lewis Colick, who wrote {{the first draft of}} The Bobby Darin Story in 1987, and Kevin Spacey. Actor-writer Jeffrey Meek believed he should have deserved credit; he was paid $85,000 of a promised $125,000 to settle <b>his</b> <b>claim</b> to have performed writing services.|$|E
5|$|Born into a rural working-class family, Pickingill {{grew up in}} Hockley, Essex and was baptised {{into the}} Church of England. Working as a farm labourer, in 1856 he married Sarah Ann Bateman in Gravesend, Kent. The couple moved back to Essex, settled in Canewdon and had four children. Pickingill's wife died in 1887, and in later life he {{attracted}} limited press attention for <b>his</b> <b>claim</b> {{to be one of}} the oldest men in England. These claims also appeared in his obituaries, although were later shown to be incorrect.|$|E
