I didn't quite register it right. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had forgotten it was a comedy since the shoot. I got all embarrassed because I'd never really had such a positive response before." ...|$|E

It took {{me back to}} the way that I {{naturally}} was as a child growing up way in the country, rarely seeing people. I was in that state of oneness with creation and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> didn't exist except as a part of everything." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the time}} when Bukhari saw the earlier works and {{conveyed}} them, he found them, in their presentation, combining between what would be considered sahih (correct) and hasan (good) and {{that many of them}} included daʻīf (weak) hadith. This aroused his interest in compiling hadith whose authenticity was beyond doubt. What further strengthened his resolve was something his teacher, hadith scholar Ishaq ibn Ibrahim al-Hanthalee – better known as Ishaq Ibn Rahwayh – had told him. [...] "We were with Ishaq Ibn Rahwayh who said, ‘If only you would compile a book of only authentic narrations of the Prophet.’ This suggestion remained in my heart so I began compiling the Sahih." [...] Bukhari also said, [...] "I saw the Prophet in a dream and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{was standing in front of}} him. In my hand was a fan with which I was protecting him. I asked some dream interpreters, who said to me, ‘You will protect him from lies.’ This is what compelled me to produce the Sahih." ...|$|E

60|$|Forthwith {{flashes of}} actual flame, a bright glare leaping {{from one to}} another, sprang from the {{scattered}} group of men. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> some invisible jet impinged upon them and flashed into white flame. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> each man <b>were</b> suddenly and momentarily turned to fire.|$|R

60|$|I {{never heard}} such sweet forbearing {{kindness}} {{expressed in a}} voice, as she expressed in making this reply. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had seen her admiringly and tenderly embracing Dora, and tacitly reproving me, by her considerate protection, for my hot haste in fluttering that little heart. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had seen Dora, in all her fascinating artlessness, caressing Agnes, and thanking her, and coaxingly appealing against me, and loving me with all her childish innocence.|$|E

60|$|I was thunderstruck! <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had {{suddenly}} been {{confronted with a}} mirror--and beheld myself! Of course he was not quite so good-looking, or so tall, {{but he was still}} a colorable imitation! I was delighted.|$|E

6000|$|The glen and sky spun round: {{the hills}} heaved! <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{had heard a}} summons from Heaven--as if a visionary messenger, like him of Macedonia, had enounced, [...] "Come over and help us!"
