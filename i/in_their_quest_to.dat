40|$|This paper explores how the {{traumatic}} experience of 9 / 11 is featured in post- 9 / 11 fiction {{by focusing on}} Jonathan Safran Foer’s Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close. American post- 9 / 11 authors have often been criticized for their focus on the domestic, mostly ignoring the global intricacies that 9 / 11 has spawned. Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close engages the domestic by chronicling the life of young Oskar Schell in post- 9 / 11 New York City and actively links his traumatic experiences with those of his grandparents, crossing generational and national boundaries, questioning conceived notions of victimhood and empathy. This strategy of transferring trauma is shown to be ineffective in aiding the characters <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>quests</b> <b>to</b> cope with <b>their</b> individual traumas, but when considered in conjunction with Foer’s distinct heterogeneous compositional style, could potentially help the reader with processing (9 / 11) trauma...|$|R

It is based on Resource-based theory, combined with the Strategy process perspective and with existing literature on information technology and ERP. The theoretic framework is extended through a detailed case study of a specific in-house ERP venture in a European multinational manufacturing company in the paper packaging industry. The emergent resource management framework describes cognitive and cultural factors that support or hamper progress, including uncertainty, knowledge gaps, knowledge transfer issues and the problems of ensuring that ERP usage is converted into competitive advantage. The framework also addresses managerial implications and potential solutions to such obstacles, throughout the process. Jel-codes M 1, MO 3.

40|$|This essay appraises {{the work}} of fiction in {{representing}} and generating semiotic consciousness in education by examining three intertextual continuities between crime fiction and stories of educational inquiry.

Second, the characteristic ways in which detective stories generate interpretations are compared with the textual strategies deployed in producing meanings and narratives in educational inquiry. Third, recent transformations of both detective fiction and educational inquiry are shown to be comparable — and intertextually linked — manifestations of cultural and semiotic shifts associated with postmodernity. I conclude by suggesting that authors of “anti-detective” crime fiction might provide more appropriate models of educational inquiry than do fictional detectives. <br /...|$|R

40|$|This {{article is}} {{motivated}} by the increasing concern about the ever-declining security of pharmaceutical products due to the abundance of counterfeit network actors. We argue that if networks are effective mechanisms for criminal organizations to infiltrate into any value chain, then networks should also work for responsible businesses <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>quests</b> <b>to</b> counter this phenomenon of value destruction, which is ultimately detrimental to the value co-creation process. Thus, this article demonstrates a nuanced understanding of the strategic impact of corporate responsibility of actors in networks on value co-creation. The current discourse on value co-creation in business networks is structured {{in such a way}} that it precludes its inherent corporate responsibility component even though they are not mutually exclusive. Moreover, research on value co-creation aimed at the proactive and responsible defence of a network substance via value co-protection has been mostly scant. We propose a model of value-optimization through value co-protection and ethical responsibility. This way of theorizing has several implications for both policy making and managerial decision making in the pharmaceutical industry and beyond...|$|R

500|$|In What's So Amazing About Grace?, Yancey {{discusses}} grace, {{calling it}} [...] "our last best word". The book's thesis is that, although people crave grace {{and it is}} centrally important to the gospel, many local churches ignore grace <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>quest</b> <b>to</b> exterminate immorality. Yancey uses the word [...] "ungrace" [...] to describe actions that fail to demonstrate grace. According to the author, the greatest gift the Christian Church can give the world is grace, but the church sometimes offers ungrace instead. Yancey writes that there are secular analogues to most Christian activities benefiting the world, such as social justice work and community service, but that [...] "grace is theological; it comes from God. It's one thing the church can offer that isn't found anywhere else". He describes his experiences attempting to make grace {{part of the way}} he lived and not just part of his theology. Yancey quotes Christian counselor David Seamands: [...] "The two major causes of most emotional problems among Evangelical Christians are these: the failure to understand, receive and live out God's unconditional grace and forgiveness; and the failure to give out that unconditional love, forgiveness, and grace to other people".|$|E
