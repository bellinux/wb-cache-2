60|$|That {{these were}} of a perplexing nature was evident from his movements. Allowing his eyes to resume their {{ordinary}} aspect, he looked round him with a troubled expression, while his fingers played slowly with the loose earth that still covered his legs. Then he shook his head, after that he scratched it, and put on his fez, which had fallen off. Finding, apparently, that meditation was of no avail, he finally heaved a deep sigh, rose, shook off the <b>dust,</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> his rifle and marched away.|$|R
50|$|Coal devils {{are common}} at the coal town of Tsagaan Khad in South Gobi Province, Mongolia. They occur when <b>dust</b> devils <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> {{large amounts of}} stockpiled coal. Their dark color makes them {{resemble}} some tornados.|$|R
50|$|The {{core of a}} vortex in air is {{sometimes}} visible because of a plume of water vapor caused by condensation in the low pressure and low temperature of the core; the spout of a tornado is an example. When a vortex line ends at a boundary surface, the reduced pressure may also draw matter from that surface into the core. For example, a dust devil is a column of <b>dust</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> by the core of an air vortex attached to the ground. A vortex that ends at the free surface of {{a body of water}} (like the whirlpool that often forms over a bathtub drain) may draw a column of air down the core. The forward vortex extending from a jet engine of a parked airplane can suck water and small stones into the core and then into the engine.|$|R
50|$|Dust devils, {{even small}} ones (on Earth), can produce radio noise and {{electrical}} fields greater than 10,000 volts per meter. A <b>dust</b> devil <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> small dirt and dust particles. As the particles whirl around, they bump and scrape {{into each other}} and become electrically charged. The whirling charged particles also create a magnetic field that fluctuates between 3 and 30 times each second.|$|R

50|$|The first moonwalk (EVA) of {{the mission}} began {{approximately}} four hours after landing, at about 6:55 pm on December 11. The first task of the first lunar excursion was to offload the Lunar Roving Vehicle and other equipment from the Lunar Module. While working near the rover, a fender was accidentally broken off when Gene Cernan brushed up against it, his hammer getting caught under the right-rear fender, breaking off the rear extension. The same incident had also occurred on Apollo 16 as Commander John Young maneuvered around the rover. Although {{this was not a}} mission-critical issue, the loss of the fender caused Cernan and Schmitt to be covered with dust thrown up when the rover was in motion. The crew used duct tape to fix the problem by attaching a map to the damaged fender, but the <b>dust</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> on the tape surface prevented it from sticking properly and the first fix was short lived. After an overnight rethink by the flight controllers, a better method of applying the tape resulted in a satisfactory fix that lasted for the length of the exploration. The crew then deployed the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package (ALSEP) west of the immediate landing site. After completing this, Cernan and Schmitt departed on the first geologic traverse {{of the mission}} towards Steno crater to the south of the landing site, during which they gathered 14 kg of samples; took seven gravimeter measurements; and deployed two explosive packages, which were later detonated remotely to test geophones that had been placed by the astronauts and seismometers that had been placed on previous Apollo missions. The EVA ended after seven hours and twelve minutes.|$|R
40|$|In April 2002, {{a severe}} dust storm {{occurred}} in the Taklimakan Desert. A large amount of the dust was lifted up by the dust storm and gradually removed in the following few days. The whole event of the dust storm was observed by the Mie-scattering depolarization lidar at Aksu, Xinjiang, China (40. 62 degrees N, 80. 83 degrees E, 1028 m above mean sea level). This paper describes the dust event and the removal process that was observed by the lidar. During the dust storm (April 13 - 16), a dense dust layer developed {{from the ground up}} to 5. 5 km. The backscattering ratio was 20 or more, and the depolarization ratio was 15 - 25 %. Due to the absorption of the laser beam by the heavy dust, a normal lidar observation was impossible for several hours. In this study, we estimated the backscattering ratio at the lowest height during the dust storm by solving the lidar equation directly. After the dust storm (April 17 - 20), a clear diurnal variation of the top of the dust layer was found by the lidar. An investigation of the lidar signals at different heights shows that there were two types of the removal process of the dust. The lidar signals at lower heights (less than the 2 km) gradually decreased during the post-dust storm period. This result indicates that the gravitational settling of the relatively large sized dust (coarse particles with a diameter of 10 mu m or more) occurs near the ground. On the other hand, lidar signals at 2 - 4 km had a clear diurnal variation with spike-like peaks from evening to midnight. These peaks suggest that the advection of the relatively small sized <b>dust</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> in other location is due to the local circulation that occurs in the Tianshan Mountains and Tarim Basin...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] The geltape {{method is}} a new method for optical {{measurement}} of total amount of dust on surfaces. The objectives were to study the potential applicability of this method to measurements of work related cobalt exposure during painting of plates with cobalt dye. METHODS [...] Consecutive series of work related geltape prints were taken from surfaces {{inside and outside the}} ventilation cabins of two plate painters during two full working days. The amount of <b>dust</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> by the geltapes was measured optically with a field monitor. Also, personal air samples were collected on filters at the different work processes. In the laboratory the contents of cobalt on the geltape prints and the filters were measured with inductive coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy. RESULTS [...] The key results were: (a) when the geltape prints were taken from surfaces inside the cabins the optically measured area of the geltapes covered with total dust (area (%)) correlated well with the chemically measured amount of cobalt present on the geltapes. Linear correlation coefficient (R 2) was 0. 91 for geltape prints taken on the floor and 0. 94 for prints taken on the ceiling; (b) the cumulative airborne cobalt exposure, calculated from data on work related exposure by personal sampling, correlated with the area (%) of geltape prints taken from the ceiling of the cabin (R 2 = 0. 98); (c) the geltape method could be used to distinguish both between work processes with different levels of cobalt exposure, and between plate painters subjected to significant differences in airborne cobalt exposure. CONCLUSION [...] The geltape method could produce measures of the work related exposures as well as whole day exposure for cobalt. The geltape results correlated with measurements of personal airborne cobalt exposure. In this industry the profile of exposure is well-defined in time, and it seems reasonable to apply this fast and low cost method in routine exposure surveillance to obtain a more detailed description of the exposure than can be obtained by the use of airborne measurements only...|$|R
5000|$|Mars {{is covered}} with vast expanses of sand and dust and its surface is {{littered}} with rocks and boulders. The <b>dust</b> is occasionally <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> in vast planet-wide dust storms. Mars dust is very fine, and enough remains suspended in the atmosphere to give the sky a reddish hue. The reddish hue is due to rusting iron minerals presumably formed a few billion years ago when Mars was warm and wet, but now that Mars is cold and dry, modern rusting {{may be due to}} a superoxide that forms on minerals exposed to ultraviolet rays in sunlight. [...] The sand is believed to move only slowly in the Martian winds due to the very low density of the atmosphere in the present epoch. In the past, liquid water flowing in gullies and river valleys may have shaped the Martian regolith. Mars researchers are studying whether groundwater sapping is shaping the Martian regolith in the present epoch, and whether carbon dioxide hydrates exist on Mars and play a role.|$|R
