Dealing with a logic and topos of the switchboard, it engages the destabilization of the addressee. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is {{to learn how to}} read with your ears. In {{addition}} to listening for the telephone, you are being asked to tune your ears to noise frequencies, to anticoding, to the inflated reserves of random indeterminateness—in a word, you are expected to stay open to the static and interference that will occupy these lines. We have attempted to install a switchboard which, vibrating a continuous current of electricity, also replicates the effects of scrambling. At first you may find the way the book runs to be disturbing, but we have had to break up its logic typographically. Like the electronic impulse, it is flooded with signals. To crack open the closural sovereignty of the Book, we have feigned silence and disconnection, suspending the tranquil cadencing of paragraphs and conventional divisions. At indicated times, schizophrenia lights up, jamming the switchboard, fracturing a latent semantics with multiple calls. You will become sensitive to the switching on and off of interjected voices. Our problem was how to maintain an open switchboard, one that disrupts a normally functioning text equipped with proper shock absorbers. Respond as you would to the telephone, for the call of the telephone is incessant and unremitting. When you hang up, it does not disappear but goes into remission. This constitutes its Dasein. There is no off switch to the technological. Remember: When you're on the telephone, there is always an <b>electronic</b> <b>flow,</b> even when that flow is unmarked.

40|$|Major {{universities}} with {{a number}} of branches, located throughout the country, have joined Plekhanov Russian University of Economics and there was a problem of operational coordination of managerial decision-making, coordination of command and control of their implementation. The problem needed to be solved very quickly as many orders have to be issued in a short period. It was necessary to develop and introduce the <b>electronic</b> document <b>flow</b> system to provide coordination of the projects’ orders on the number of students at the university branches on higher education programmes, postgraduate and vocational secondary education, and ensuring legal validity of the electronic documents. Cryptography techniques, encryption standard (National State Standard, Russian Federation legislation), university’s corporate network, <b>electronic</b> document <b>flow</b> system “DELO”, enhanced electronic signature services such as Crypto Pro CSP, CARMA and EDSIGN. Electronic approval technology between the head University and its branches {{with the use of the}} enhanced unqualified electronic signature was suggested. Two ways of exchanging documents were developed and implemented in order to make the scheme work: 1) Sending documents via the corporate e-mail, using National State Standard encryption. 2) Document exchange via “DELO”, <b>electronic</b> document <b>flow</b> system. The first stage has provided the document exchange, using the enciphered information with the enhanced electronic signature. At the same time, the problem of creating secure data channels between the remote university branches was solved. During the second stage, when the branches were introduced into the university’s corporate network through the secure data channels, they also gained access to the “DELO”, <b>electronic</b> document <b>flow</b> system. From the end of December 2014 up to November 2016, around 3000 orders, concerning the students were entered into the system. This method was applied not only at the branches, but also at Moscow university grounds. It is used in a slightly modified way in the vocational education department, is now being implemented in Moscow colleges. The use of the enhanced unqualified electronic signature and encryption methods has allowed to organise an efficient legal way of documents’ exchange between the head University and its numerous branches. The developed technology has solved the problem of meeting deadlines to issue the orders, concerning the students and had a certain economical effect, saving mail, transport and travel expenses. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} a dc on the interdiffusivity D in the Cu-Ni system was {{investigated}} over the temperature range of 650 - 850 degrees C and at current densities {{in the range of}} 0 - 1000 A cm(- 2). Interdiffusivities were calculated using the Sauer-Freise-den Broeder method and the values calculated {{in the absence of a}} current were in agreement with previously published results. The influence of the current on D depended on its direction relative to the two interfaces in the trilayered Cu-Ni-Cu samples. When the <b>electronic</b> <b>flow</b> was from Ni to Cu (cocurrent interface), the interdiffusivity showed a marked increase relative to copper content but was unchanged when the <b>electronic</b> <b>flow</b> was from Cu to Ni (countercurrent interface). The increase of D in the cocurrent interface depended on concentration and temperature. At lower temperatures, the increase becomes significant at higher copper concentrations but for the same value of current density, the increase is apparent at lower concentrations. The effective activation energy of interdiffusivity depended on concentration and decreased with the application of a current. The decrease was largest for higher copper concentrations. The results are interpreted in terms of a proposed vacancy-atom interaction for copper with the implication that the electron wind effect on Cu is counteracted by the effect of vacancies.

40|$|SCOTT LASH’S Critique of Information (2002) {{is one of}} {{the most}} ambitious and provocative works on the theory of the global {{information}} revolution to have appeared in recent years. Yet if the book is received simply as another account of the <b>electronic</b> <b>flows</b> and circuitry of the information age it will be misunderstood. Its fate would be one of eager, if temporary, academic consumption and relegation to the limbo of courses in social theory and cultural analysis. This book, like its predecessor Another Modernity: A Different Rationality (1999), deserves better than this. As a highly original exercise in critical theorizing, it is a speculative tour de force, forging a site of radical interrogation of the place of theory and political critique in the digital maelstrom of the e-society and exemplifying the possibilities of a renewed engagement with some of the most intractable problems of modern culture. The chapters of the book are organized into three thematic sections: ‘Information’, ‘Critique’, and ‘Critique of Information’. The development of the argument is woven around a grammar of four interrelated concerns: a theory of information as the new cultural capital of global communicationsociety, the limits of information-based power and the effects of disinformation as the central object of informationcritique, the resurgence of ‘the idea’, and the place of radical reflexivity within the new power flows of cyberculture...|$|R
