5|$|In February 2014, Politico {{reported}} that in October 2008, Bevin had signed a report for his investment fund that praised the federal Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and the government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. During the campaign, Bevin criticized McConnell for voting in favor of those actions as a senator. When Beck asked Bevin about the issue during an interview, Bevin said {{the content of the}} report had been written by the fund's chief <b>investment</b> <b>officer,</b> and that he had only signed it because he was legally required to do so as president of the fund. Later, Bevin added that he had not physically signed the letter, but that his signature was added to the document digitally. Lawyers interviewed by the Lexington Herald-Leader said it would have been legal for Bevin to change the content of the letter, but not the accompanying facts and financial data. The Herald-Leader further noted that Bevin had not signed some previous investor letters. His campaign offered no explanation for the inconsistency.|$|E

500|$|In 1994, SBC {{followed}} up its acquisition of O'Connor by acquiring Brinson Partners an asset management firm focused on providing access for US institutions to global markets. [...] Founded by Gary P. Brinson, an innovator in financial management, Brinson Partners had {{emerged as one}} of largest managers of pension plans and also managed a series of mutual funds. [...] Brinson was a pioneer {{in the development of the}} theory of asset allocation which had largely become conventional wisdom among money managers in the 1980s and 1990s. [...] Brinson had begun working at First Chicago Corporation in the 1970s and by 1981 began building the business that would become Brinson Partners. [...] In 1989, Brinson led a US$100million management buyout of his firm from First Chicago Corporation and over the next five years built up the firm to approximately US$36billion of assets under management. [...] SBC paid US$750million to acquire Brinson Partners, which resulted in a profit to Brinson and his partners of US$460million on the sale of their 75% stake in the company.

40|$|Fund {{managers}} {{are the primary}} investment decision-makers in the stock market, and corporate executives are their primary sources of information. Meetings between the two are therefore central to stock market investment decisions but are surprisingly under-researched. There is little in the academic literature concerning their aims, content and outcomes. We report findings from interview research conducted with chief financial officers (CFOs) and investor relations managers from FTSE 100 companies and with chief <b>investment</b> <b>officers</b> (CIOs) and fund managers (FMs) from large institutional investors. Of particular interest we note that FMs place great reliance on discounted cash flow valuation models (despite informational asymmetry in favour of CFOs). This leads the former to seek to control encounters with the latter and to place great store on the clarity and consistency of corporate messages, ultimately relying on them for purposes other than estimating fundamental value.

5000|$|In {{addition}} to its research and lobbying activities, the trade association has developed best practice guidelines. In 2009, it developed a set of [...] "guidelines for responsible investment", which were adopted by its members, covering such issues as health, safety, labor, governance, transparency for stakeholders and respect for human rights. The guidelines were produced {{in accordance with the}} United Nations' Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), from discussions between AIC members and a group of institutional investors. The guidelines focus on transparency of private equity transactions and ensuring compliance with all applicable laws, both in the United States and overseas, and encourage adding value to members' portfolio companies. The AIC received positive feedback on its guidelines from PRI executive director James Gifford, and the chief <b>investment</b> <b>officers</b> of California Public Employees Retirement Systems (CalPERS) and California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS), but the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) remained critical of the industry, arguing that outside regulation was needed rather than internal guidelines.|$|R
40|$|Since mining {{companies}} depend on debt and/or equity funding {{to sustain their}} operations, investors, in theory, could influence mining company policy by making financing conditional on environmental and social performance factors. The rise in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) reporting combined with the increasing trend of Socially Responsible Investing (SRI) - different {{sides of the same}} coin - CSR provides sustainability information to the market and SRI principles influence the investment decisions of investors. The purpose of this research was to gain a deeper insight into the influence of sustainability metrics on the investment behaviour of investors when investing in the South African mining industry. The research was conducted by performing in-depth, qualitative interviews with members of the investment community which included asset owners, asset managers, chief <b>investment</b> <b>officers,</b> <b>investment</b> analysts and fund managers. By and large, the investment community does not consider sustainability metrics published by {{mining companies}} when making investment decisions, and the principles and use of sustainability metrics have yet to be integrated into the decision-making process of most asset managers. There is, however, an increasing awareness of the principles of responsible investment and a correlating increase in the number of asset owners and asset managers subscribing to the principle guiding bodies which augurs well for the future.
