5|$|The creek whaler {{is a minor}} bycatch of inshore <b>gillnet</b> {{fisheries}} {{operating in}} northern Australia; the meat is sold for human consumption. Given its relatively high reproductive rate, its population appears capable of withstanding present levels of fishing. Therefore, the IUCN has listed this species under Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|Fisheries {{operating}} off Portugal and Japan {{are responsible}} for most commercial landings of the kitefin shark, generally as bycatch in bottom trawls and on hook-and-line. Portugal reported a kitefin shark bycatch of 282 tons in 2000 and 119 tons in 2003. In {{other areas of the}} northeastern Atlantic this shark is rare and reported catches are likely confounded by misidentifications of other species; some are caught by mixed-species <b>gillnet</b> fisheries operating in deep water west of the British Isles, where surveys suggest that kitefin shark numbers may have declined by 94% since the 1970s. In the Mediterranean, this shark is caught incidentally by bottom trawl and <b>gillnet</b> fisheries. Although it is generally discarded alive, many are unable to return to deep water and do not survive. In the Southern Hemisphere, catches by the Australian South East Trawl Fishery are increasing following the relaxation of regulations regarding seafood mercury content; this species is not included under Australian fishery quotas. New Zealand kitefin shark catches peaked from 1986 to 1997. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the kitefin shark as Near Threatened worldwide, and as Vulnerable in the northeastern Atlantic in light of documented population declines.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, a drift <b>gillnet</b> fishery for {{the common}} {{thresher}} developed in southern California in 1977, beginning with 10 vessels experimenting with a larger-sized mesh. Within two years the fleet had increased to 40 vessels, and the fishery peaked in 1982 when 228 vessels landed 1,091 metric tons. The common thresher population rapidly collapsed from overfishing, with landings decreasing to less than 300 metric tons a year by the late 1980s and larger size classes disappearing from the population. Common threshers are still taken commercially in the United States, with about 85% coming from the Pacific and 15% from the Atlantic. The largest catches remain from the California-Oregon <b>gillnet</b> fishery, which had shifted its focus to the more valuable swordfish (Xiphius gladius) but still take threshers as bycatch. Small numbers of Pacific threshers are also taken by harpoons, small-mesh driftnets, and longlines. In the Atlantic, threshers are primarily taken on longlines meant for swordfish and tuna.|$|E
40|$|An {{estimated}} 2882 t of tuna were landed by <b>gillnets</b> and {{hook and}} line at Tuticorin duringthe year 2006. They were exploited by smallmeshed <b>gillnets</b> locally known as podivalai with 3. 3 to 7. 5 cm mesh size, large meshed <b>gillnets</b> known as paruvalai with 8 - 16 cmmesh size and hooks and line operated from mechanized boats and motorized vallams. Small meshed <b>gillnets</b> operate in shallow waters within 10 - 15 m depth and land tunas {{along with other}} medium sized pelagics. Podivalai accounted for 8. 3 % tuna landings. Large meshed <b>gillnets</b> and hooks and line operate in 50 - 150 m depth zone beyond 10 km from the coast and land large tunas and pelagics.

5|$|Feeding almost {{exclusively}} on octopuses and other cephalopods, the Australian weasel shark mostly hunts near the sea floor. It is viviparous, with the developing embryos nourished through a placental connection and born after a six-month gestation period. This species is productive for a shark, with females bearing litters of 1–19 pups usually twice per year. The Australian weasel shark is caught by trawl {{and to a lesser}} extent <b>gillnet</b> and longline fisheries, though not in such numbers that its population is threatened. Thus, it has been listed as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
5|$|Fishing gear is {{the biggest}} threat to loggerheads in the open ocean. They often become {{entangled}} in longlines or gillnets. According to the 2009 status review of loggerheads by the Fisheries Service, drowning from entanglement in longline and <b>gillnet</b> fishing gear is the turtles’ primary threat in the North Pacific. They also become stuck in traps, pots, trawls, and dredges. Caught in this unattended equipment, loggerheads risk serious injury or drowning. Turtle excluder devices for nets and other traps reduce the number being accidentally caught.|$|E
5|$|Harmless to humans, the smalltail shark {{is caught}} {{incidentally}} by <b>gillnet</b> and longline fisheries throughout its range. The meat is sold fresh, frozen, or dried and salted. In addition, the dried fins are exported {{for use in}} shark fin soup, the liver oil and cartilage are used medicinally, and the carcass is processed into fishmeal. In 2006, the IUCN assessed this species, including Pacific populations now separated as C. cerdale, as Data Deficient {{due to a lack}} of fishery data. In Trinidad, its abundance makes it the most economically important shark. Off northern Brazil, substantial numbers are caught by <b>gillnet</b> fisheries targeting the Serra Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus brasiliensis). In the 1980s, this species constituted roughly 43% of the shark and ray catch, but has since declined to around 17%. This apparent decline is thought to have resulted from increasing fishing effort, the large proportion of juveniles captured, and the shark's low reproductive rate. Consequently, the IUCN has assessed the smalltail shark in Brazil as Vulnerable, and noted the urgent need for conservation measures given that northern Brazil represents the center of the species' range. Although the smalltail shark was ostensibly given protection by inclusion on the 2004 Official List of Endangered Animals in Brazil, fishing remains effectively unmanaged.|$|E

5|$|Pacific {{angelsharks}} are {{not dangerous}} to humans unless provoked, {{in which case}} their bite can cause a painful injury. They are valued for their meat and are captured by commercial and recreational fishers across their range. A targeted <b>gillnet</b> fishery for this species began off Santa Barbara, California in 1976 and ended in 1994, after overfishing and new regulations led to its near-collapse. This species is now mainly fished in Mexican waters. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Near Threatened, as the Californian population is largely protected and recovering, while the impact of Mexican fisheries is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Porpoises {{are highly}} {{affected}} by bycatch. Many porpoises, mainly the vaquita, {{are subject to}} great mortality due to gillnetting. Although it is the world's most endangered marine cetacean, the vaquita continues {{to be caught in}} small-mesh <b>gillnet</b> fisheries throughout much of its range. Incidental mortality caused by the fleet of El Golfo de Santa Clara was estimated to be at around 39 vaquitas per year, which is over 17% of the population size. Harbour porpoises also suffer drowning by gillnetting, but on a less threatening scale due to their high population; their mortality rate per year increases a mere 5% due to this.|$|E
5|$|Shy and {{difficult}} to approach, the nervous shark is harmless to humans. It is occasionally marketed for food. This species is susceptible to being caught incidentally in coastal gillnets, such as the barramundi (Lates calcarifer) <b>gillnet</b> fishery operating off northern Australia. It may also be caught on line gear and in prawn trawls. The Australian nervous shark population {{does not appear to}} be threatened by fishing activities, and there the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Least Concern. No data on the impact of fishing are available elsewhere in its range, and thus the IUCN has listed it overall under Data Deficient.|$|E

5|$|The common {{thresher}} {{is widely}} caught by offshore longline and pelagic <b>gillnet</b> fisheries, {{especially in the}} northwestern Indian Ocean, the western, central, and eastern Pacific, and the North Atlantic. Participating countries include the former USSR, Japan, Taiwan, Spain, the United States, Brazil, Uruguay, and Mexico. The meat is highly prized for human consumption cooked, dried and salted, or smoked. In addition, their skin is made into leather, their liver oil is processed for vitamins, and their fins are used for shark fin soup. The United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) reported a worldwide common thresher take of 411 metric tons in 2006.|$|E
5|$|The {{milk shark}} is {{harmless}} to humans {{because of its}} small size and teeth. Caught using longlines, gillnets, trawls, and hook-and-line, this shark is marketed fresh or dried and salted for human consumption, and is also used for shark fin soup and fishmeal. Its abundance makes it a significant component of artisanal and commercial fisheries across its range. Off northern Australia, it ranks among the most common sharks caught in trawls, and comprises 2% and 6% of the annual <b>gillnet</b> and longline catches, respectively. This species {{is also one of}} the most commercially important sharks caught off Senegal, Mauritania, Oman, and India. Some sport fishers regard it as a game fish.|$|E
5|$|Valued for its meat, the finetooth shark {{forms an}} {{important}} component of the commercial <b>gillnet</b> shark fishery operating off the southeastern United States. Population assessments suggest that this fishery does not currently pose a threat to U.S. populations of the species. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has therefore listed the finetooth shark under Least Concern, though no fishery data are available for this species off South America. This shark is not known to pose a danger to humans, though it snaps vigorously when captured and should be handled with caution.|$|E
50|$|Atlantic salmon {{were once}} {{abundant}} throughout the North Atlantic. European fishermen <b>gillnetted</b> for Atlantic salmon in rivers using hand-made nets {{for at least}} several centuries.

5|$|Despite its size, {{the common}} {{thresher}} is minimally dangerous to humans {{due to its}} relatively small teeth and timid disposition. It is highly valued by commercial fishers for its meat, fins, hide, and liver oil; large numbers are taken by longline and <b>gillnet</b> fisheries throughout its range. This shark is also esteemed by recreational anglers for the exceptional fight it offers on hook-and-line. The common thresher has a low rate of reproduction and cannot withstand heavy fishing pressure for long, {{a case in point}} being the rapid collapse of the thresher shark fishery off California in the 1980s. With commercial exploitation increasing {{in many parts of the}} world, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Vulnerable.|$|E
5|$|Harmless to humans, the hardnose shark {{is caught}} with {{gillnets}} and line gear by artisanal and commercial fisheries {{across much of}} its range. It is used for meat, which is sold fresh or dried and salted, though its small size limits its economic importance. Its low reproductive rate may render it susceptible to overfishing, and given existing levels of exploitation, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Near Threatened. Off northern Australia, the hardnose shark makes up 13.6% of the <b>gillnet</b> catch and 4.0% of the longline catch. Since these losses {{do not appear to}} have diminished its population there, the IUCN has given it a regional assessment of Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|Larger {{species of}} procellariid face similar {{problems}} to the albatrosses with long-line fisheries. These species readily take offal from fishing boats and will also steal bait {{from the long}} lines as they are being set, risking becoming snared on the hooks and drowning. In {{the case of the}} spectacled petrel this has led to the species undergoing a large decline and its listing as critically endangered. Diving species, most especially the shearwaters, are also vulnerable to <b>gillnet</b> fisheries. Studies of gill-net fisheries show that shearwaters (sooty and short-tailed) compose 60% of the seabirds killed by gill-nets in Japanese waters and 40% in Monterey Bay, California in the 1980s, with the total number of shearwaters killed in Japan being between 65,000 and 125,000 per annum over the same study period (1978–1981).|$|E
50|$|Bycatch by unwary {{fishermen}} may be {{a factor}} for the ongoing decline of the Yangtze finless porpoise. Illegal fishing and hazardous gear, like <b>gillnets,</b> is widely used in the Yangtze river. The preferred habitat of the Yangtze Finless Porpoise overlaps extensively with the usage of <b>gillnets,</b> which makes the species particularly vulnerable to entanglement and subsequent drowning. However, a recent large-scale interview survey conducted in fishing communities {{along the banks of}} the Yangtze, by the IUCN, suggests that mortality due to bycatch may have decreased over the past two decades as the porpoise population has declined, and have concluded that <b>gillnetting</b> is unlikely to be the primary cause of their decline.|$|R
50|$|Encircling <b>gillnets</b> are <b>gillnets</b> set {{vertically}} {{in shallow}} water, with the floatline remaining {{at the surface}} so they encircle fish. Small open boats or canoes {{can be used to}} set the net around the fish. Once the fish are encircled, the fishers shout and splash the water to panic the fish so they gill or entangle themselves. There is little negative impact on the environment. As soon as the gear is set the scaring takes place and the net is hauled back in. The fish are alive and discards can be returned to the sea. Encircling <b>gillnets</b> are commonly used by groups of small-scale fishers, and does not require other equipment.|$|R

5|$|Prior to {{the finding}} of {{additional}} specimens in Kuwait, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) assessed the smoothtooth blacktip shark as Vulnerable based on its presumed small range and population. Despite {{the discovery of a}} second subpopulation off Kuwait, this species likely still warrants a Vulnerable assessment (or higher) because the waters around the Arabian Peninsula are subject to heavy fishing pressure and habitat degradation. <b>Gillnet</b> and other fisheries off Kuwait are known to take the smoothtooth blacktip shark as bycatch, while intensive Yemeni and Somalian shark fisheries operate in the Gulf of Aden. The status of the Yemen subpopulation is uncertain because no further specimens have been recorded since the original over a century ago.|$|E
5|$|Small {{bony fishes}} {{are the main}} prey of the nervous shark, while crustaceans, molluscs, and snakes may also be eaten. It is viviparous, with the {{developing}} embryos nourished through a placental connection. The details of its life history seem to vary depending on latitudefor example, {{the timing of the}} breeding season and the length of the gestation period. Females produce litters of one to six young either annually or biennially. The harmless nervous shark is caught incidentally by coastal <b>gillnet</b> fisheries and perhaps also by line and trawl fisheries. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lacks sufficient data to assess the conservation status of this species except in Australian waters, where its population seems healthy and has been listed under Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature has {{listed the}} milk shark under Least Concern; despite being heavily fished, {{it has a}} wide {{distribution}} and remains fairly common. The reproductive characteristics of this species suggests {{it is capable of}} withstanding a somewhat high level of exploitation, though not as much as the grey sharpnose shark (R. oligolinx) or Australian sharpnose shark (R. taylori). In the 1980s and early 1990s, stock assessments of the milk shark off India's Verval coast concluded catches by <b>gillnet</b> and trawl fisheries were below the maximum sustainable level. However, these studies were based on methodologies that have subsequently been proven unreliable for shark populations. Moreover, fishing pressure in the region has increased substantially since the assessments were conducted.|$|E
25|$|<b>Gillnets</b> are so {{effective}} that their use is closely monitored and regulated by fisheries management and enforcement agencies.
