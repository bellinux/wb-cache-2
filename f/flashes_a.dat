5|$|The Presque Isle Light was {{constructed}} in 1872 {{on the north side}} of Presque Isle and was lit on July12, 1873. This light is , with a red brick house that was used as a lighthouse keeper residence, and later a park residence. Today the lighthouse is maintained by the United States Coast Guard and <b>flashes</b> <b>a</b> white light to warn ships of the sandy peninsula that juts into Lake Erie. The light station is open to public tours from Memorial Day through Labor Day on weekends, weather permitting (see presqueislelighthouse.org). A third, smaller lighthouse was built in 1906 by the Erie Waterworks on the Presque Isle Bay side of the peninsula. Today it stands in the ferry landing for the Presque Isle Water Taxi service, south of the former waterworks along the state park's multi-purpose trail on the southeast side of Presque Isle.|$|E

25|$|These delays {{prevented}} Borlaug's {{group from}} conducting the germination tests {{needed to determine}} seed quality and proper seeding levels. They started planting immediately, and often worked in sight of artillery <b>flashes.</b> <b>A</b> week later, Borlaug discovered that his seeds were germinating at {{less than half the}} normal rate. It later turned out that the seeds had been damaged in a Mexican warehouse by over-fumigation with a pesticide. He immediately ordered all locations to double their seeding rates.|$|E

500|$|In {{the video}} the Pussycat Dolls are shown {{sitting in a}} car {{in the middle of a}} traffic jam, where Scherzinger <b>flashes</b> <b>a</b> ring that says [...] "famous". They sing the {{introduction}} of the song in the car before jumping out. When the chorus kicks in, the women leave the car and stand on the roofs of the other cars and start dancing a routine. Then they walk down a street of Hollywood stars with bubbles floating all around them. As they walk down the street, they also stop to sing on a bench. As the second chorus starts, the Dolls climb scaffolding and begin to dance. During Scherzinger's solo, she stands in a small area with the Pussycat Dolls logo to the left and a mirror to the right, with lights flashing. The Dolls then dance in the breakdown section with the logo behind them and the camera zooms out to reveal filming equipment and playback screens.|$|E

6000|$|She {{followed}} him along the dark passage, {{in the side}} of which he opened a little trap, when she saw a great slimy cavern, where the long arms of the mill-wheel flung themselves slowly and distractedly round, and splashing water-drops caught the little light that strayed into the gloomy place, turning it into stars and <b>flashes.</b> <b>A</b> cold mist-laden puff of air came into their faces, and the roar from within made it necessary for Anne to shout as she said, 'It is dismal! let us go on.' ...|$|E
60|$|He {{had stuck}} his ricking-rod, or poniard, {{as it was}} indifferently called--a long iron lance, {{polished}} by handling--into the stack, used to support the sheaves instead of the support called a groom used on houses. A blue light appeared in the zenith, and in some indescribable manner flickered down {{near the top of}} the rod. It was the fourth of the larger <b>flashes.</b> <b>A</b> moment later and there was a smack--smart, clear, and short. Gabriel felt his position to be anything but a safe one, and he resolved to descend.|$|E

6000|$|The Bedouin {{returned}} {{with an empty}} skin but a full budget. I will offer you, dear L., a specimen of the [...] "palaver" [...] [6] {{which is supposed to}} prove the aphorism that all barbarians are orators. Demosthenes leisurely dismounts, advances, stands for a moment cross-legged--the favourite posture in this region--supporting each hand with a spear planted in the ground: thence he slips to squat, looks around, ejects saliva, shifts his quid to behind his ear, places his weapons before him, takes up a bit of stick, and traces lines which he carefully smooths away--it being ill- omened to mark the earth. The listeners sit gravely in a semicircle upon their heels, with their spears, from whose bright heads <b>flashes</b> <b>a</b> ring of troubled light, planted upright, and look stedfastly on his countenance over the upper edges of their shields with eyes apparently planted, like those of the Blemmyes, in their breasts. When the moment for delivery is come, the head man inquires, [...] "What is the news?" [...] The informant would communicate the important fact that he has been to the well: he proceeds as follows, noting emphasis by raising his voice, at times about six notes, and often violently striking at the ground in front.|$|E
60|$|Isabel {{did not get}} out of the {{carriage}} to verify his report; she preferred to refute his story of her former panic on those islands by remaining serenely seated while he visited them. She thus lost a superb novelty which nature has lately added to the wonders of this Fall, in that place {{at the edge of the}} great Horse Shoe where the rock has fallen and left a peculiarly shaped chasm: through this the spray leaps up from below, and <b>flashes</b> <b>a</b> hundred feet into the air, in rocket-like jets and points, and then breaks and dissolves away in the pyrotechnic curves of a perpetual Fourth of July. Basil said something like this in celebrating the display, with the purpose of rendering her loss more poignant; but she replied, with tranquil piety, that she would rather keep her Niagara unchanged; and she declared that, as she understood him, there must be something rather cheap and conscious in the new feature. She approved, however, of the change that had removed that foolish little Terrapin Tower from the brink on which it stood, and she confessed that she could have enjoyed a little variety in the stories the driver told them of the Indian burial-ground on the island: they were exactly the stories she and Basil had heard twelve years before, and the ill-starred goats, from which the island took its name, perished once more in his narrative.|$|E
6000|$|Some five or {{six years}} ago I heard a speech about birds {{delivered}} by Sir Edward Grey, in which he said that the love and appreciation and study of birds was something fresher and brighter than the second-hand interests and conventional amusements in which so many in this day try to live; that the pleasure of seeing and listening to them was purer and more lasting than any pleasures of excitement, and, in the long-run, [...] "happier than personal success." [...] That was a saying to stick in the mind, and it is probable that some who listened failed to understand. Let us imagine that in addition to this miraculous faculty of the brain of storing innumerable brilliant images of things seen and heard, to be reproduced at call to the inner sense, there existed in a few gifted persons a correlated faculty by means of which these treasured images could be thrown at will into the mind of another; let us further imagine that some one in the audience who had wondered at that saying, finding it both dark and hard, had asked me to explain it; and that in response I had shown him, as by a swift succession of lightning <b>flashes</b> <b>a</b> score or a hundred images of birds at their best--the unimaginable loveliness, the sunlit colour, the grace of form and of motion, and the melody--how great the effect of even that brief glance into a new unknown world would have been! And if I had then said: All that you have seen--the pictures in one small room in a house of many rooms--is not after all the main thing; that it would be idle to speak of, since you cannot know what you do not feel, though it should be told you many times; this only can be told--the enduring images are but an incidental result of a feeling which existed already; they were never looked for, and are a free gift from nature to her worshipper;--if I had said this to him, the words of the speech which has seemed almost sheer insanity a little while before would have acquired a meaning and an appearance of truth.|$|E
