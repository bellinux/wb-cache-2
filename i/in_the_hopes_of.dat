5|$|A league-wide {{change in}} {{philosophy}} {{prior to the}} 2014–15 NHL season favouring speed over strength for a team's role players resulted in the near elimination of the enforcer role. As a consequence, McGrattan appeared in only 8 of Calgary's first 42 games. The team ultimately placed him on waivers, and upon clearing, demoted him to the AHL's Adirondack Flames in mid-January. With Adirondack, McGrattan abandoned fighting and tried to play an all-round game <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hopes</b> <b>of</b> returning to the NHL.|$|E

5|$|During {{their first}} three appearances, the art {{competitions}} were grouped into five broad categories: architecture, literature, music, painting, and sculpture.

5|$|After a {{bill that}} would have {{provided}} funds to protect the site failed, then-President Lyndon B. Johnson signed an Executive Order that authorized funding for the Army Corps of Engineers to build a levee around the site to protect it from the imminent flooding caused by construction of the Lower Monumental Dam. Late that year, Daugherty left the dig, leaving Fryxell to lead the project. Once the Lower Monumental Dam was closed in February 1969, within three days, the site was completely underwater, due to the seepage of thick layers of gravel that had not been accounted for. However, as the site was being flooded, the excavation team laid down plastic sheeting topped with gravel <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hopes</b> <b>of</b> being able to return to the dig in the future.|$|E

Rucks is unsure if there is any way to prevent the Calamity from reoccurring if the time is rewound, as {{there was no way to}} test the process. The game ends either way, showing images of the characters (with the inclusion of Zulf if the player chose to rescue him) flying away or of their lives before the Calamity along with the credits. In the New Game+ mode, which is unlocked after beating the game once, it is hinted that restoring the world didn't prevent the Calamity.|$|E
5|$|After the {{government}} of Nova Scotia established a lifesaving station on Sable Island in 1801, workers trained some of the horses to haul supplies and rescue equipment. Lifesaving staff recorded the importation of a stallion, Jolly, taken there in 1801, who was probably similar in type to the original Acadian horses released on the island. Although Jolly {{was not the first}} horse on the island, {{he was the first to}} be identified by name in historic records, and is known to have survived on the island until at least 1812. Other breeding stock, probably including horses of Thoroughbred, Morgan and Clydesdale breeding, were sent to the island during the first half of the 19th century, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hopes</b> <b>of</b> improving the type of horses found on the island and raising the price for which they could be sold on the mainland.|$|E
