5|$|At Panxian, {{there appears}} to have been a {{transition}} in the endemic marine reptile fauna, possibly caused by volcanism. This volcanism is indicated by the presence of a bentonite layer between the Middle and Upper Reptile Horizons. From lower in the Upper Reptile Horizon, fossils have also been found of the ubiquitous mixosaurian <b>ichthyosaur</b> Mixosaurus panxianensis (which occurs in all layers), the pachypleurosaurs Keichousaurus sp. and Wumengosaurus delicatomandibularis, and fish, although fossils of the latter are fragmentary. The lower Middle and Lower Reptile Horizons also include the mixosaurian Phalarodon cf. fraasi, the primitive <b>ichthyosaur</b> Xinminosaurus catactes, the placodont Placodus inexpectatus, the nothosaurs Lariosaurus hongguoensis and Nothosaurus yangjuanensis, and the archosaur Qianosuchus mixtus, alongside bivalves and saurichthyid fish.|$|E
5|$|Long before England existed, {{this area}} {{was at the bottom}} of a primeval sea. The most notable of the fossils {{uncovered}} is that of an <b>ichthyosaur</b> from Caldecotte, now on display in the central library.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} 1821 paper he co-authored with Henry De la Beche on <b>ichthyosaur</b> anatomy, William Conybeare named and {{described}} the genus Plesiosaurus (near lizard), called so {{because he thought it}} more like modern reptiles than the <b>ichthyosaur</b> had been. The description was based on a number of fossils, the most complete of them specimen OUMNH J.50146, a paddle and vertebral column that had been obtained by Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas James Birch. Christopher McGowan has hypothesised that this specimen had originally been much more complete and had been collected by Anning, during the winter of 1820/1821. If so, it would have been Anning's next major discovery, providing essential information about the newly recognised type of marine reptile. No records by Anning of the find are known. The paper thanked Birch for giving Conybeare access to it, but does not mention who discovered and prepared it.|$|E
5000|$|Cymbospondylus {{was one of}} {{the largest}} <b>ichthyosaurs,</b> with fossils ranging from 6 to 10 m long. It {{was also one of the}} least fish-like of the <b>ichthyosaurs,</b> lacking a dorsal fin and fluked tail. It did, however, have an {{elongated}} snout like other <b>ichthyosaurs.</b>|$|R
50|$|The most {{prominent}} feature {{that has created}} controversy in the assignment of Omphalosaurus is {{the placement of the}} teeth. Unlike other <b>Ichthyosaurs,</b> for which teeth form distinct rows, Omphalosaurus teeth form an irregular pavement. Additionally, no other <b>Ichthyosaurs</b> have maxillary grinding surfaces at right angles of each other. The tooth crowns of Omphalosaurus are lower and more irregular than other durophagus <b>Ichthyosaurs,</b> and the enamel typically has an orange-peel textured surface rather than <b>Ichthyosaur’s</b> typical longitudinal wrinkles. Omphalosaurus also have hollow ribs and humerus with prominent deltopectoral crest, neither of which are found in other <b>Ichthyosaurs.</b>|$|R
50|$|Omphalosaurus are {{currently}} considered small-to-medium sized <b>Ichthyosaurs.</b> Like other <b>Ichthyosaurs,</b> they have deeply amphicoelous vertebrae with no distinct transverse processes, and their centra are shorter {{than they are}} wide. The ribs of Omphalosaurus share the dorsoventrally articulation of Ichthyosaurian family Shastasauridae and O. wolfi was shown {{to have the same}} cancellous bone structure as <b>Ichthyosaurs,</b> though this is common in several other aquatic species. One of the most distinct traits placing Omphalosaurus within Ichthyosauria is that they share the same microunit enamel in mature teeth that <b>Ichthyosaurs</b> are known to have, but that is rare in other reptiles.|$|R
5|$|Mary Anning (1799–1847) {{lived in}} Lyme Regis and {{followed}} in her father's footsteps as a collector. She became {{an expert on}} the fossils {{to be found in the}} Blue Lias around the town and discovered the first complete <b>Ichthyosaur</b> skeleton at The Spittles. Other important discoveries of ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs and a pterosaur followed, as well as invertebrates such as cephalopods and their ink sacs.|$|E
5|$|At {{the mouth}} of the Rogue River, along the coast of Curry County, is the Otter Point Formation, a mélange of metamorphosed {{sedimentary}} rocks such as shales, sandstones, and chert. Although the rocks formed in the Jurassic, evidence suggests that they faulted north as part of the Gold Beach Terrane after the Klamaths merged with North America. Oregon's only dinosaur fragments, those of a hadrosaur or duck-billed dinosaur, were found here. In the mid-1960s, a geologist also discovered the beak and teeth of an <b>ichthyosaur</b> in the Otter Point Formation.|$|E
5|$|Anning {{searched for}} fossils in the area's Blue Lias cliffs, {{particularly}} {{during the winter months}} when landslides exposed new fossils that had to be collected quickly before they were lost to the sea. She nearly died in 1833 during a landslide that killed her dog, Tray. Her discoveries included the first <b>ichthyosaur</b> skeleton correctly identified; the first two more complete plesiosaur skeletons found; the first pterosaur skeleton located outside Germany; and important fish fossils. Her observations {{played a key role in}} the discovery that coprolites, known as bezoar stones at the time, were fossilised faeces. She also discovered that belemnite fossils contained fossilised ink sacs like those of modern cephalopods. When geologist Henry De la Beche painted Duria Antiquior, the first widely circulated pictorial representation of a scene from prehistoric life derived from fossil reconstructions, he based it largely on fossils Anning had found, and sold prints of it for her benefit.|$|E
50|$|Grippia are {{believed}} to have lived from 250-235 Ma during the Olenekian - Anisian of the early to mid-Triassic. Grippia are considered to be basal <b>ichthyosaurs</b> along with several other early genus, with Grippia being the most basal out of all of them. This is due to its primitive anatomy when compared to older <b>ichthyosaurs</b> and because Grippia is the most thoroughly studied out of all basal <b>ichthyosaurs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Based on {{analysis}} of tooth size {{relative to the}} skull width, Parvinatator {{is estimated to be}} less than 1 meter long, approximately the same size and general shape of other basal <b>ichthyosaurs,</b> although it is unknown if Parvinatator lacked a dorsal fin like Utatsusaurus and Grippia. Also like other early <b>ichthyosaurs,</b> Parvinatator most likely used an eel-like lateral body movement for propulsion, known as anguilliform. Based on jaw size and tooth shape, Parvinatator is thought to have feed on small fish and cephalopods similarly to other basal <b>ichthyosaurs,</b> as opposed to hard shelled organisms such as mollusks and clams. [...] <b>Ichthyosaurs</b> typically had large eyes suggesting they would hunt in the dark, either at night or in deep water. [...] After the skull’s dis-articulated orbit was reconstructed, it matched the approximate shape and typical size of other <b>ichthyosaurs</b> eyes.|$|R
25|$|Nathalie Bardet {{published}} {{a discussion of}} the possible causes for the extinction of the <b>ichthyosaurs.</b> She expressed doubt that <b>ichthyosaurs</b> were replaced by mosasaurs because they would not be in direct competition with each other. Instead she posited a connection to an extinction event that affected cephalopods at the boundary between the Cenomanian and Turonian ages. She proposed that the disappearance of these many cephalopod species may have deprived <b>ichthyosaurs</b> of their food source and caused their extinction.|$|R
5|$|Other <b>ichthyosaur</b> remains {{had been}} {{discovered}} in years past at Lyme and elsewhere, but the specimen found by the Annings {{was the first to}} come to the attention of scientific circles in London. It was purchased by the lord of a local manor, who passed it to William Bullock for public display in London where it created a sensation. At a time when most people in Britain still believed in a literal interpretation of Genesis, that the Earth was only a few thousand years old and that species did not evolve or become extinct, the find raised questions in scientific and religious circles about what the new science of geology was revealing about ancient life and the history of the Earth. Its notoriety increased when Sir Everard Home wrote a series of six papers, starting in 1814, describing it for the Royal Society. The papers never mentioned who had collected the fossil, and in the first one he even mistakenly credited the painstaking cleaning and preparation of the fossil performed by Anning to the staff at Bullock's museum. Perplexed by the creature, Home kept changing his mind about its classification, first thinking {{it was a kind of}} fish, then thinking it might have some kind of affinity with the duck-billed platypus (only recently known to science); finally in 1819 he reasoned it might be a kind of intermediate form between salamanders and lizards, which led him to propose naming it Proteo-Saurus. By then Charles Konig, an assistant curator of the British Museum, had already suggested the name Ichthyosaurus (fish lizard) for the specimen and that name stuck. Konig purchased the skeleton for the museum in 1819. The skull of the specimen is still in the possession of the Natural History Museum in London (to which the fossil collections of the British Museum were transferred later in the century), but at some point, it became separated from the rest of the skeleton, the location of which is not known.|$|E
25|$|Though fossils {{revealing}} <b>ichthyosaur</b> behavior remain rare, one <b>ichthyosaur</b> fossil {{is known}} to have sustained bites to the snout region. Discovered in Australia, and analyzed by Benjamin Kear et alii in 2011, measurements of the wounds reveal that the bite marks were inflicted by another <b>ichthyosaur,</b> likely of the same species, a probable case of face biting during a conflict. The wounds show signs of healing in the form of bone growth, meaning that the victim survived the attack. Another, very large <b>ichthyosaur</b> close to nine metres in length was found in Svalbard; it was nearly complete save for its tail. Scrutiny of the find revealed that while hunting ammonites (as evidenced by an ammonite shell in the throat region), the <b>ichthyosaur</b> was ambushed and attacked, likely by a pliosaurid (known from the same habitat), which severed its tail. The <b>ichthyosaur</b> then sank to the depths, drowning and eventually becoming fossilized in the deep water. The find was revealed to the public in the National Geographic special Death of a Sea Monster.|$|E
25|$|The {{first known}} {{illustrations}} of <b>ichthyosaur</b> bones, vertebrae, and limb elements were {{published by the}} Welshman Edward Lhuyd in his Lithophylacii Brittannici Ichnographia of 1699. Lhuyd thought that they represented fish remains. In 1708, the Swiss naturalist Johann Jakob Scheuchzer described two <b>ichthyosaur</b> vertebrae assuming they belonged to a man drowned in the Universal Deluge. In 1766, an <b>ichthyosaur</b> jaw with teeth was found at Weston near Bath. In 1783, this piece was exhibited by the Society for Promoting Natural History as those of a crocodilian. In 1779, <b>ichthyosaur</b> bones were illustrated in John Walcott's Descriptions and Figures of Petrifications. Towards {{the end of the}} eighteenth century, British fossil collections quickly increased in size. Those of the naturalists Ashton Lever and John Hunter were acquired in their totality by museums; later, it was established that they contained dozens of <b>ichthyosaur</b> bones and teeth. The bones had typically been labelled as belonging to fish, dolphins, or crocodiles; the teeth had been seen as those of sea lions.|$|E
50|$|Following the Permian-Triassic {{extinction}} event (also colloquially {{known as}} The Great Dying), the decline and disappearance of eugeneodonts and giant nautiloids left an environmental niche empty that many marine reptiles began to fill. Guizhouichthyosaurus {{was one of}} the largest marine vertebrates of the time, whose only predators composed of large macro-predatory <b>Ichthyosaurs</b> (that of which preferred to hunt smaller <b>ichthyosaurs).</b> The rise of the shelled cephalopods (ammonites that survived the Permian-Triassic extinction event, along with the appearance of belemnites) gave <b>ichthyosaurs</b> an abundant food supply with little competition.Guizhouichthyosaurus and other <b>ichthyosaurs</b> began to adapt to hunting these cephalopods through larger eyes, and thick bodies, to handle the pressures of diving deep to hunt for their prey.|$|R

25|$|Similar {{to modern}} cetaceans, such as whales and {{dolphins}}, <b>ichthyosaurs</b> were air-breathing. Whales and dolphins are mammals and warm-blooded. Of <b>ichthyosaurs</b> it was traditionally assumed {{that they were}} cold-blooded, being reptiles. However, since the 1970s many dominant reptile groups of the Mesozoic, such as theropod dinosaurs, pterosaurs and plesiosaurs, have been considered warm-blooded, as this offers an elegant explanation of their dominance. Some direct evidence is available that <b>ichthyosaurs</b> too might have been endothermic. In 1990, Vivian de Buffrénil published a histological study, indicating that <b>ichthyosaurs</b> possessed a fibrolamellar bone structure, as with warm-blooded animals in general, typified by fast growth and a strong vascularisation. Early Triassic species already show these traits. In 2012, {{it was reported that}} even the very basal form Utatsusaurus had this bone type, indicating that the ancestors of <b>ichthyosaurs</b> were already warm-blooded. Additional direct proof for a high metabolism is the isotopes of oxygen ratio in the teeth, which indicates a body temperature of between 35 – 39°C, about 20° higher than the surrounding seawater.|$|R
25|$|Gastroliths, stomach {{stones that}} might have {{assisted}} digestion or regulated buoyancy, have only on a few occasions been found associated with <b>ichthyosaur</b> skeletons, once with a specimen of Nannopterygius and a second time in a Panjiangsaurus fossil. <b>Ichthyosaur</b> coproliths, petrified faeces, are very common, though, already being sold by Mary Anning.|$|E
25|$|Temnodontosaurus {{are known}} for being {{gigantic}} Ichthyosaurs. According to the paleontologist Michael Maisch, species of Temnodontosaurus were large, exceeding 12 meters (39ft) in length. There {{is a possibility that}} they reached a similar size to another giant <b>Ichthyosaur,</b> Shonisaurus popularis, which was previously considered the largest <b>ichthyosaur.</b> There seems to be a general consensus between paleontologists that they could at least have reached 9m.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ichthyosaur</b> {{teeth are}} {{typically}} conical. Fish-eating species have long and slender tooth crowns that are slightly recurved. Forms specialised in catching larger prey have shorter, broader, and straighter teeth; sometimes, cutting edges are present. Thalattoarchon, an apex predator, had larger teeth formed like flattened blades. Durophagous species, that ate shellfish, have low, convex teeth that are closely packed. Many <b>ichthyosaur</b> dentitions are heterodont, combining several tooth shapes, e.g. small {{teeth in the}} front and larger teeth at the rear. The teeth are usually placed in tooth sockets; derived species possess a common tooth groove. In the latter case, adult individuals sometimes become toothless. Teeth in tooth sockets sometimes fuse with the jawbone. With <b>ichthyosaur</b> teeth, the dentine shows prominent vertical wrinkles. Durophagous forms have teeth with deep vertical grooves and wrinkles in the enamel.|$|E

25|$|The {{demise of}} the ichthyosaurs has {{recently}} {{been described as a}} two-step process. A first extinction event {{in the beginning of the}} Cenomanian eliminated two of the three <b>ichthyosaur</b> feeding guilds then present, the 'soft-prey specialists' and the 'generalists', leaving only an apex predator group, which probably was not particularly specialized. The second major <b>ichthyosaur</b> extinction took place during the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary event, an 'anoxic event', eliminating the apex predators, after which just a single lineage survived, Platypterygius hercynicus, which disappeared shortly afterwards, about 93 million years ago. <b>Ichthyosaur</b> extinction was thus a pair of abrupt events rather than a long decline, probably related to the environmental upheavals and climatic changes in the Cenomanian and Turonian. If so, it was not caused by mosasaurid competition; large mosasaurs did not appear until 3 million years after the <b>ichthyosaur</b> extinction, likely to fill the resulting ecological void. Plesiosaurian Polycotylidae perhaps also filled some of the niches previously occupied by ichthyosaurs, although they had coexisted for 19 million years. The extinction was most likely the result of ecological change and volatility that caused changes in migration, food availability, and birthing grounds. This part of the Cretaceous was one in which many other marine extinctions occurred, including those of some types of microplankton, ammonites, belemnites, and reef-building bivalves.|$|E

25|$|In 1994, Judy Massare {{concluded}} that <b>ichthyosaurs</b> {{had been the}} fastest marine reptiles. Their length/depth ratio was between three and five, the optimal number to minimise water resistance or drag. Their smooth skin and streamlined bodies prevented excessive turbulence. Their hydrodynamic efficiency, {{the degree to which}} energy is converted into a forward movement, would approach that of dolphins and measure about 0.8. <b>Ichthyosaurs</b> would be a fifth faster than plesiosaurs, though half of the difference was explained by assuming a 30% higher metabolism for <b>ichthyosaurs.</b> Together, within Massare's model these effects resulted in a cruising speed of slightly less than five kilometres per hour. However, in 2002, Motani corrected certain mistakes in Massare's formulae and revised the estimated cruising speed to less than two kilometres per hour, somewhat below that of modern Cetacea. However, as the speeds estimated for plesiosaurs and mosasaurids were also revised downwards, <b>ichthyosaurs</b> maintained their relative position.|$|R
25|$|Thegarten Lingham-Soliar {{argued against}} Nathalie Bardet's {{attribution}} of <b>ichthyosaur</b> extinction {{to the loss}} of their preferred food sources in the Cenomanian-Turonian extinction event expanded on his own 1999 attribution of <b>ichthyosaur</b> extinction to biotic factors. During the Cretaceous the evolution of many fish groups trended towards faster swimming body types, making them harder to hunt for adult ichthyosaurs and harder to escape from for newborn ichthyosaurs. This ecological scene favored ambush predators like plesiosaurs and the newly evolved mosasaurs over the ichthyosaurs, who succumbed to the competition.|$|E
25|$|A newly {{discovered}} <b>ichthyosaur</b> fossil has revealed the earliest live reptile birth, dating back 248 million years. It suggests that live-bearing evolved {{on land and}} not in the sea.|$|E
25|$|During the ninteenth century, {{the number}} of {{described}} <b>ichthyosaur</b> genera gradually increased. New finds allowed for {{a better understanding of}} their anatomy. Owen had noted that many fossils showed a downward bend in the rear tail. At first, he explained this as a post mortem effect, a tendon pulling the tail end downwards after death. However, after an article on the subject by Philip Grey Egerton, Owen considered the possibility that the oblique section could have supported the lower lobe of a tail fin. This hypothesis was confirmed by new finds from Germany. In the Posidonia Shale at Holzmaden, dating from the early Jurassic, already in the early nineteenth century, the first <b>ichthyosaur</b> skeletons had been found. During {{the latter half of the}} century, the rate of discovery quickly increased to a few hundred each year. Ultimately, over four thousand were uncovered, forming the bulk of <b>ichthyosaur</b> specimens displayed today. The sites were also a Konservat-Lagerstätte, meaning not only the quantity, but also the quality was exceptional. The skeletons were very complete and often preserved soft tissues, including tail and dorsal fins. Additionally, female individuals were discovered with embryos.|$|E

25|$|Like other <b>Ichthyosaurs,</b> Temnodontosaurus {{species were}} fast cruisers or swimmers. Jurassic <b>Ichthyosaurs,</b> like Temnodontosaurus species, swim with lateral {{oscillation}} of their caudal fluke on a flexible tail stock. The body form for swimming of T. trigonodon were described by Emily Buchholtz. T. trigonodon species had highly flexible, long, thin bodies {{with a high}} vertebral count and modest regional differentiation. They used their large limbs as rudders. The style of swimming was thunniform (unlike the earlier <b>Ichthyosaurs</b> which did anguilliform styled swimming instead). This is shown in Temnodontosaurus and other forms in the Jurassic (and after) because of their semi-lunate tail fin and shortened body relative to the tail.|$|R
