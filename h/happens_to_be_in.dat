It is now summer, and the story focuses on a new protagonist named [...] Kyosuke is an {{acquaintance}} of Hiro's and <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the same grade and school. He has a passion for filming, and constantly carries a digital video recorder around with him. On Christmas night, he saw Kei Shindo, who is the main heroine of the second chapter, running down the street and tried to get a shot of her, but a truck passed by, so he could not get a clean shot of the mystery girl. After thinking about the mystery girl, he ends up quitting the film club and agrees with his girlfriend, Emi Izumi (voiced by: Kaori Nobiki (Japanese), Allison Sumrall (English)), to break up.|$|E

500|$|Set {{some time}} before {{the events of the}} first game, the main character, whose name is later {{revealed}} to be Jeremy Fitzgerald, has started working as a night watch security guard at the [...] "new and improved" [...] Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. The [...] "upgraded" [...] versions of the animatronic characters, which have special facial recognition software to protect the children from potential harm, were not programmed with a proper night mode; when things go silent, their programming tells them that they are in the wrong room and they seek out the nearest source of noise to find people to entertain, which <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the player's office. The player must again listen to the instructions of a [...] "phone guy", and attempt to defend themselves from the animatronics using several mechanics. Like the previous game, the player must survive from midnight to 6 AM. Jeremy is apparently moved to day shift after Night 6 as the animatronics' hostility becomes too dangerous, with the restaurant closing down shortly after.|$|E

He regales Animal Farm's denizens with tales of a wondrous place beyond the clouds called [...] "Sugarcandy Mountain, that happy country where we poor animals shall rest forever from our labours!" [...] Orwell portrays established religion as [...] "the black raven of priestcraft—promising pie in the sky when you die, and faithfully serving whoever <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> power." [...] Napoleon brings the raven back (Ch. IX), as Stalin brought back the Russian Orthodox Church.|$|E
2500|$|Arturo Toscanini, a {{prominent}} anti-fascist, was furious {{to learn that}} Furtwängler {{would be at the}} Festival. He accepted his engagement in Salzburg on the condition that he would not have to meet Furtwängler. But the two did meet, and argued over Furtwängler's actions. Toscanini argued: [...] "I know quite well that you are {{not a member of the}} Party. I am also aware that you have helped your Jewish friends [...] But everyone who conducts in the Third Reich is a Nazi!". Furtwängler emphatically denied this and said: [...] "By that, you imply that art and music are merely propaganda, a false front, as it were, for any Government which <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> power. If a Nazi Government is in power, then, as a conductor, I am a Nazi; under the communists, I would be a Communist; under the democrats, a democrat... No, a thousand times no! Music belongs to a different world, and is above chance political events." [...] Toscanini disagreed and that ended the discussion.|$|E

2500|$|Though using profanity on occasion, Butters {{does not}} indulge in foul-mouthed {{language}} {{as often as}} the other children on the show, instead preferring to use minced oaths; [...] "oh hamburgers" [...] is one he uses frequently, as well as [...] "gee whiz" [...] mostly in earlier seasons. Butters speaks with a mild stutter and tends to fidget with his hands. The other characters perceive him as [...] "nerdy", and he obliviously maintains a wholesome attitude and mild disposition despite the tragedy and abuse that he frequently encounters. His happy-go-lucky persona {{has been described as}} resembling that of a typical 1950s sitcom child character, and is usually presented {{in stark contrast to the}} harsh treatment he receives at the hands of his friends and strict parents, including his mother's deranged attempt to murder him after discovering his father's bisexuality, as well as when his grandmother <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> town and constantly bullies him during her stay. Stone describes him as embodying [...] "permanent innocence". [...] Butters, however, sees himself as a problem child because his parents tell him so and often expresses remorse at being [...] "out-of-control". Exceptions to this include the episode [...] "The Ungroundable", in which Butters makes his parents worry about their ability to ground him when he refuses to be punished. This rebellious behavior begins after he joins the vampire kids at his school, but ends when he helps the Goth kids burn down a Hot Topic store. He is also known for being gullible, quickly believing anything told to him by others and tending to do whatever he is told to do with little protest, no matter how ridiculous these things seem to be. As such, he is always made an unknowing accomplice in Cartman's various devious schemes. There are cases, however, where Butters has shown a darker side, such as in episodes like [...] "The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs" [...] and [...] "Butterballs"; in the latter of which he viciously assaulted Dr. Oz and verbally castigated his abusive grandmother.|$|E
