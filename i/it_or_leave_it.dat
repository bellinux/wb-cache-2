Written and directed by Vishal Bharadwaj, Kaminey requires patience and attention but the pay off is more than worth it." [...] Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama rated the film 4 out of 5 and wrote [...] "Kaminey is bold, stark, funny and unpredictable and is a film with an attitude. Like <b>it</b> <b>or</b> <b>leave</b> <b>it,</b> but you'd {{never be able to}} ignore it. Word from the wise: Go for this hatke (different) experience!"

He also said, [...] "Its lyrics are the blow-up-your-brains-out kind...and its music, composed by the multi-talented Bharadwaj is perfectly in sync with a narrative that doesn't pause for breath." [...] Namrata Joshi from Outlook gave {{a rating of}} 4 out 5 and called Kaminey [...] "a strikingly anarchic, unusually energetic, quirky and frenetic film". Sudhish Kamath of The Hindu gave the film 4 stars and wrote, [...] "Kaminey takes the post-postmodern noir genre to a whole new level, to a sophistication the Indian audience isn't used to. Watch it at least twice to fully appreciate this masterpiece." [...] Writing for Variety, critic Joe Leydon described the film as a [...] "tasty cinematic masala that is energetically entertaining, if not consistently coherent".|$|E

The product of years of research, the prototype is deployed by the Umbrella Corporation as a field test to hunt and kill the STARS police team before they can expose Umbrella's activity in the Arklay mountains.

Despite later being doused in acid, the Nemesis continues its pursuit, and mutates into a much larger monster after absorbing a dead Tyrant, gaining the ability to spew poison.
