5|$|During a lunchtime tryst in Phoenix, Arizona, a {{real estate}} {{secretary}} named Marion Crane discusses with her boyfriend, Sam Loomis, how they cannot afford to get married because of Sam's debts. After lunch, Marion returns to work, where a client drops off a $40,000 cash payment on a property. Her boss asks her to deposit {{the money in the}} bank, and she asks if she can take {{the rest of the afternoon}} off. Returning home, she begins to pack, deciding to steal the money and give it to Sam in Fairvale, California. She is seen by her boss on <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> town, which makes her nervous. During the trip, she pulls over on the side of the road and falls asleep, only to be awakened by a state patrol officer.

5|$|She is then tasked {{to escort}} Dr. Otto Schenker, an East German scientist, to England. Later on, as Cate and Dr. Schenker {{fly back to}} England, he is {{captured}} by H.A.R.M., led by Magnus Armstrong, who knocks Cate unconscious. Armstrong decides to spare Cate's life, believing {{that she is a}} fellow Scot. Cate awakens and is soon thrown from the plane as it explodes. After surviving the fall via parachute, Cate is later introduced to a new partner, Tom Goodman, a UNITY agent from the American branch. After meeting him in a nightclub in Hamburg, they are ambushed by H.A.R.M. but manage to escape. The nightclub is owned by a German singer named Inge Wagner, whom Cate suspects is connected with H.A.R.M. The two are then tasked to investigate a cargo freighter containing several suspicious chemical containers that UNITY believes are linked to Dr. Schenker. Cate gets in the freighter, and after taking photos of the containers, is knocked unconscious by Armstrong, who spares her life by locking her in a cargo hold, thus ignoring Wagner's insistence that she must be liquidated. As the freighter heads out to sea, it slowly begins to sink, due to a huge explosion. Wagner and Armstrong escape immediately, but Cate has to fight <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the bowels of the freighter. Because Cate could not obtain the required information, she and Tom must return to the sunken freighter to finish gathering intelligence aboard. Cate goes scuba diving, and after investigating the shipwreck and obtaining the captain's log and the cargo manifest, she is ambushed by H.A.R.M. divers sent from a submarine commanded by Armstrong and Wagner but manages to escape.|$|E

500|$|Human {{evolution}} and {{the resilience of}} life may {{also be seen as}} key themes of Gravity. The film opens with the exploration of spacethe climax of human civilizationand ends with an allegory of the dawn of mankind when Dr. Ryan Stone fights <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the water after the crash-landing, passing a frog, grabs the soil, and slowly regains her capacity to stand upright and walk. Director CuarÃ³n said, [...] "Sheâs in these murky waters almost like an amniotic fluid or a primordial soup. In which you see amphibians swimming. She crawls out of the water, not unlike early creatures in evolution. And then she goes on all fours. And after going on all fours sheâs a bit curved until she is completely erect. It was the evolution of life in one, quick shot". Other imagery depicting the formation of life includes a scene in which Stone rests in an embryonic position, surrounded by a rope strongly resembling an umbilical cord. Stone's return from space, accompanied by meteorite-like debris, may be seen as a hint that elements essential to the development of life on Earth may have come from outer space in the form of meteorites.|$|E

They turned and started in the other direction, opening fire on an armed trawler in passing. Return fire from the trawler set their engine on fire.|$|E
500|$|Shawn Kellner {{from the}} Chicago Music Magazine praised the costumes and the dancing, while Jodi Duckett from The Morning Call {{felt that the}} [...] "characters that looked like Tibetan monks , the gonging of bells and Madonna {{arriving}} in a gilded cage" [...] made the performance seem [...] "very 'Da Vinci Code' like".

Barbara Vandenburgh from The Arizona Republic called the performance as [...] "raucous". Shirley Halperin from The Hollywood Reporter was confused as how the religious iconography portrayed during the performance was tied to the song's theme of a [...] "girl gone wild". San Jose Mercury News editor Jim Harrington called the selection of [...] "Girl Gone Wild" [...] as [...] "commonplace". Jim Farber from New York Daily News described the performance as transitioning from a girl gone wild to [...] "girl gone bloodthirsty" [...] with the subsequent violence depictions. Ben Crandell from Florida's Sun-Sentinel newspaper observed that Madonna turned around the [...] "solemn" [...] introduction to a dance number with [...] "Girl Gone Wild". According to her the performance portrayed Madonna as [...] "fashionable, powerful, but vulnerable sex toy", which became [...] "an ongoing theme for the night".|$|E
