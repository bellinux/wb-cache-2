Working according to evidencebased procedures within both medicine and nursing means using in one’s work the recommendations which have been based on literature studies that have compiled, reviewed, assessed and interpreted the published research.

The literature review according to SBU originates from Goodman’s definitions, which results in an order of precedence for the reviewed studies. Implementation at the work place is made easier by literature studies and discussions at meetings with the nurses. A literature review requires a structured way of working where the question is clearly defined, the project plan prepared and the literature search published. The relevant material is clearly defined, while the quality of the studies, precision and generalization taken from the results produces a combination and conclusion.

5|$|All puzzles {{are based}} on a {{mechanic}} of tracing a path through a maze-like route from a starting point, represented as a circle, to a goal point, represented as a line segment with a rounded end, without crossing one's path. The goal of these puzzles is not always to simply complete the maze but to <b>find</b> the <b>right</b> <b>path</b> that completes the puzzle correctly. Mazes may have several starting points and goals; the player may have to <b>find</b> the <b>right</b> starting point that can complete the maze, or they may {{have to figure out how}} to reach a specific end point to trigger an event in the surrounding environment such as moving a platform. The puzzles include a symbolic language that denotes the mechanics for that maze. For example, puzzles that present mazes with black and white squares in the spaces between traceable paths require the player to find a path through the maze that separates these squares by color. Other puzzles require the player to use the environment to determine how to solve the puzzle, such as studying a nearby tree with branches that mimic the puzzle, or by observing symbols on nearby floors and walls that align with the puzzle's configuration. The puzzles within each island section {{are based on}} common mechanic, often with a sequence of puzzles appearing early in each section that are designed to help the player identify and understand the mechanic and meaning of the symbols. Later puzzles combine two or more different mechanics into the same puzzle using the consistent symbolic language.|$|R
40|$|A {{disaster}} usually severely harms {{human health}} and property. After a disaster, great amount of information of a disaster area is needed urgently. The information not only indicates {{the severity of the}} disaster, but also is crucial for an efficient search and rescue process. In order to quickly and accurately collect real time information in a disaster scenario, a mobile platform is developed for an outdoor scenario and a localization and navigation system for responders is introduced for an indoor scenario. The mobile platform has been integrated to the DIORAMA system. It is built with a 6 -wheel robot chassis along with an Arduino microcontroller. Controlled by a mounted Android smartphone, the mobile platform can receive commands from incident commanders and quickly respond to the commands. While patrolling in a disaster area, a constant RFID signal is collected to improve the localization accuracy of victims. Pictures and videos are also captured in order to enhance the situational awareness of rescuers. The design of the indoor information collection is focused on the responder side. During a disaster scenario, it is hard to track responders’ locations in an indoor environment. In this thesis, an indoor localization and navigation system based on Bluetooth low energy and Android is developed for helping responders report current location and quickly <b>find</b> the <b>right</b> <b>path</b> in the environment.

The same applies to the world of sport. On the contrary, many times it happens that successful athletes decide to end the career at an early age because of prioritizing the family, or vice versa–they prioritize sport at the expense of their family. The aim is to show that it may not always be the choice of either-or, but that it may be possible to combine maternal duties with the sport provided certain principles are followed.

Suitable criteria have been devised to distinguish with 80 % accuracy those who were and those who were not as completely recovered as patients who imderwent treatment under local analgesia alone. Repetition of the test is expected to give an indication of when the individual patient is sufficiently recovered to go home from the outpatient clinic.

Chapuis (1959) devised a test which depended on the ability of the subject to <b>find</b> the <b>right</b> <b>path</b> out of a labyrinth as quickly as possible. This test demands a grasp of the situation, logical thought, and quick reaction. Duker (1959) suggested a test which consisted of a repetition of calculations.

This test measures concentration and continuous mental activity. The subject counts from 1000 as many numbers as possible, inscribing them into a "field " five squares by five squares. The performance of the subject is evaluated by points based on the total number of squares used. All these three tests have the ability to express disturbances at higher integration levels of the brain. The reaction time is a test which has been used by psychologists for many years.
