5|$|Clay {{is usually}} hard and strong when dry, but becomes very soft when it absorbs water. The dry clay helps hold an earth wall together, {{but if the}} wall is {{directly}} exposed to rain, or to water leaking down <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof,</b> it may become saturated and collapse.|$|E
5|$|Non-Hindus are not {{permitted}} to enter the shrines but are allowed to view the temple and the proceedings <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> of the Raghunandan library, located within the precincts of the temple, for a small donation.|$|E

5|$|Right after Gaga {{performed}} in the Super Bowl LI halftime show, many media outlets pointed out similarities between {{the beginning of the}} show where she descended <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> of NRG Stadium from a harness to a similar scene in this episode in which she descends from a helicopter on a harness.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the main}} central shrine there are slab {{coverings}} which have perforations in them to drain rainwater {{to a large}} underground storage. The pipe lines <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> lead the rain water to the storage are also visible. The temple needs conservation measures to preserve the ancient monument in good shape.|$|E
5|$|Continued ingress {{of water}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> and from unroofed {{exterior}} walkways above the ceiling level had caused seepage which carried down salts from the building mortar and deposited them on the ceiling through evaporation. In places this caused {{the surface of the}} frescoes to bubble and lift. Although discolouration was a serious problem, bubbling was not, because the thinness and transparency of the paint which Michelangelo employed on the greater part of the ceiling permitted the salts to pass through rather than accumulating beneath the surface.|$|E
50|$|As {{water was}} {{difficult}} to come by where the villa was built, Roman engineers constructed an intricate system for the collection of rainwater <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>roofs</b> and a large cistern that supplied the palace with fresh water.|$|R

By punishing a known friend and prominent citizen, he hopes to intimidate the Jewish populace. Judah swears to take revenge.|$|E
5|$|Sestero recalls in {{his book}} The Disaster Artist that Wiseau {{intended}} for the film to contain a subplot in which Johnny was revealed to be a vampire, due to Wiseau's own fascination with the creatures. Sestero recounts how, {{at the outset of}} production, Wiseau tasked members of the crew with figuring out a way to execute a sequence in which Johnny's Mercedes-Benz would lift off <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> of the townhouse and fly across the San Francisco skyline, revealing Johnny's vampiric nature. However, this scene did not end up being created for the film.|$|E
5|$|The abbey {{relatively}} quickly {{fell into}} disuse and eventual disrepair after its dissolution at the Reformation, the lead <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> rumoured {{to have been}} used in the 16th century civil wars and the stonework plundered for housebuilding throughout the town. The ruins were a popular site for travellers during the 17th and 18th centuries, and finally in 1815 the remains were taken into the care of the State for preservation. The remains are now administered by Historic Scotland.|$|E

5|$|The office {{moved to}} the fourth floor of the U.S. Federal Building {{now known as the}} U.S. Public Building on March 16, 1905. The {{building}} was expanded in the late 1920s and the U.S. Weather Bureau {{moved to the}} fourth floor of the new annex on November 13, 1930. In additions to the regular surface observations of temperature, precipitation and wind, the office started taking PIBAL observations <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> of the building.|$|E
5|$|The rebels, {{heading for}} Warminster {{got as far}} as Trowbridge, but royalist forces cut off the route and Monmouth turned back towards Somerset through Shepton Mallet, {{arriving}} in Wells on 1 July.

5|$|A book {{published}} in November 2011, Seal Target Geronimo, by Chuck Pfarrer, a former SEAL, contradicted the account {{as given by}} U.S. government sources. According to Pfarrer, neither helicopter crashed {{at the beginning of}} the raid. Instead, the SEALs jumped onto the roof from the hovering Razor 1 helicopter and entered a third-floor hallway <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> terrace. Osama's third wife, Khairah, was in the hallway, headed towards the SEALs. She was blinded by a strobe light and pushed to the floor as the SEALs went past her. Osama bin Laden stuck his head out of a bedroom door, saw the SEALs, and slammed the door closed. At the same time, Osama's son Khalid bin Laden ran up the stairs to the third floor and was killed with two shots.|$|E
60|$|Murder! that is {{what the}} cheiromantist had seen there. Murder! The very night seemed to know it, and the desolate wind to howl it in his ear. The dark corners of the streets were full of it. It grinned at him <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>roofs</b> of <b>the</b> houses.|$|R
60|$|There {{was little}} rest for the besieged now.

5|$|Amid {{reports of}} looting, {{concerns}} were {{raised about the}} safety of the antiquities of the famous Egyptian Museum, near the epicenter of the Cairo protests. Egyptian state television announced in the evening that army commandos had secured the museum. Protesters joined soldiers in protecting the museum, situated beside the burning ruling party headquarters. Looters managed to enter during the night <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> to damage a number of small artifacts, and it was initially reported that they had ripped the heads off two mummies, but subsequent reports claimed that Egypt's top archaeologist had mistaken skulls from other skeletons, and that the mummies were intact.|$|E
5|$|Ann {{discovers that}} her predecessor, Emily Jessel (Lightfoot), {{is buried in}} Bly's church, and is told that Jessel killed herself. She also begins to see the figures {{of a young man}} and a young woman around Bly. Mrs Grose dismisses Ann's stories, but one maid, Carla (Walker), tells Ann of the sexually abusive former valet Peter Quint (MacLiam). Mrs Grose reveals that Carla had been badly {{affected}} by the War, and is prone to flights of fancy. Later, Ann is woken at night by the figure of the woman, and follows her to find Flora standing next to an open window. The pair see Carla fall <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof,</b> landing near Miles, who is in the garden. Ann rushes outside, and sees the male figure on the roof. Inside again, Mrs Grose assures Ann that she must be confused.|$|E
5|$|By {{the sixth}} {{day of the}} siege the gunmen had become {{increasingly}} frustrated {{at the lack of}} progress in meeting their demands. That evening, they killed one of the hostages and threw his body out of the embassy. As a result, the government ordered the Special Air Service (SAS), a special forces regiment of the British Army, to conduct an assault—Operation Nimrod—to rescue the remaining hostages. Shortly afterwards, SAS soldiers abseiled <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> of the building and forced entry through the windows. During the 17-minute raid, they rescued {{all but one of the}} remaining hostages, and killed five of the six hostage-takers. The soldiers later faced accusations of unnecessarily killing two of the five, but an inquest into the deaths eventually cleared the SAS of any wrongdoing. The sole remaining gunman was prosecuted and served 27 years in British prisons.|$|E
50|$|When the {{prosperity}} of the village suffered, there were insufficient funds to maintain the church, and in the 1690s, the parish obtained permission to demolish the old church and build a much smaller one. This {{was funded by the}} sale of lead <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>roofs</b> and <b>the</b> bells <b>from</b> <b>the</b> tower.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly a great cry arose <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>roofs</b> of <b>the</b> temples; a cry {{of alarm}} and warning that, taken up from point to point, ran off {{to the east and}} to <b>the</b> west, <b>from</b> temple, court, and rampart, until it sounded as a dim echo in the distance.|$|R

5|$|During the Civil War, and {{the siege}} of Basing House between 1643 and 1645, the town played host to large numbers of Parliamentarians. During this time, St. Michael's Church was damaged whilst being used as an {{explosive}} store and lead was stripped <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> of the Chapel of the Holy Ghost, Basingstoke leading to its eventual ruin. It had been incorporated in 1524, but was effectively out of use after the Civil War. The 17th century saw serious damage {{to much of the}} town and its churches, because of the great fires of 1601 and 1656. Cromwell is thought to have stayed here towards the end of {{the siege of}} Basing House, and wrote a letter to the Speaker of the House of Commons addressed from Basingstoke.|$|E
5|$|In 1661, after Charles II was {{restored}} to the throne, Robert Creighton, the king's chaplain in exile, was appointed dean and was bishop {{for two years before}} his death in 1672. His brass lectern, given in thanksgiving, {{can be seen in the}} cathedral. He donated the nave's great west window at a cost of £140. Following Creighton's appointment as bishop, the post of dean went to Ralph Bathurst, who had been chaplain to the king, president of Trinity College, Oxford and fellow of the Royal Society. During Bathurst's long tenure the cathedral {{was restored}}, but in the Monmouth Rebellion of 1685, Puritan soldiers damaged the west front, tore lead <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> to make bullets, broke the windows, smashed the organ and furnishings, and for a time stabled their horses in the nave.|$|E
5|$|In 1685, the Duke of Monmouth led the Monmouth Rebellion {{in which}} Somerset people fought against James II. The rebels landed at Lyme Regis and {{travelled}} north hoping to capture Bristol and Bath, puritan soldiers damaged the west front of Wells Cathedral, tore lead <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> to make bullets, broke the windows, smashed the organ and the furnishings, {{and for a}} time stabled their horses in the nave. They were defeated in the Battle of Sedgemoor at Westonzoyland, the last battle fought on English soil. The Bloody Assizes which followed saw the losers being sentenced to death or transportation.|$|E

50|$|In 2009 {{the site}} was offered for sale. By this time, several {{properties}} that once belonged to the hospital, such as the gatehouse, had been sold off and the buildings were becoming derelict. There are signs of demolition throughout the site {{and many of the}} original slates (believed to be worth in excess of £1 million) were stripped <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>roofs.</b> <b>The</b> large derelict site has recently become an attraction to many urban explorers despite improved security measures.|$|R
