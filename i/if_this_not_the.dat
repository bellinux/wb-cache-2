40|$|Parameter {{estimation}} {{causes a}} considerable stochastic error in standard Shewhart charts. This {{problem can be}} solved using suitable correction factors. But if the normality assumption itself fails, in addition a nonvanishing model error will occur. By then, a nonparametric alternative, such as the recently proposed MIN chart, {{might be a better}} idea throughout. However, for those reluctant to give up on the Shewhart chart, a third possibility is offered here. One sticks with this traditional chart as long as the data suggest that the resulting model error is acceptable. Only <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> case, the MIN chart kicks in and as such serves as a nonparametric safeguard. ...|$|E
