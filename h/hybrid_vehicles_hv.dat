40|$|<b>Hybrid</b> <b>vehicles</b> (<b>HV),</b> {{comprising}} {{a conventional}} ICE-based powertrain and a secondary energy source, {{to be converted}} into mechanical power as well, represent a well-established alternative to substantially reduce both fuel consumption and tailpipe emissions of passenger cars. Several HV architectures are either being studied or already available on market, e. g. Mechanical, Electric, Hydraulic and Pneumatic Hybrid Vehicles. Among the others, Electric (HEV) and Mechanical (HSF-HV) parallel Hybrid configurations are examined throughout this Thesis. To fully exploit the HVs potential, an optimal choice of the hybrid components to be installed must be properly designed, while an effective Supervisory Control must be adopted to coordinate the way the different power sources are managed and how they interact. Real-time controllers can be derived starting from the obtained optimal benchmark results. However, the application of these powerful instruments require a simplified and yet reliable and accurate model of the hybrid vehicle system. This can be a complex task, especially when {{the complexity of the}} system grows, i. e. a HSF-HV system assessed in this Thesis. The first task of the following dissertation is to establish the optimal modeling approach for an innovative and promising mechanical hybrid vehicle architecture. It will be shown how the chosen modeling paradigm can affect the goodness and the amount of computational effort of the solution, using an optimization technique based on Dynamic Programming. The second goal concerns the control of pollutant emissions in a parallel Diesel-HEV. The emissions level obtained under real world driving conditions is substantially higher than the usual result obtained in a homologation cycle. For this reason, an on-line control strategy capable of guaranteeing the respect of the desired emissions level, while minimizing fuel consumption and avoiding excessive battery depletion is the target of the corresponding section of the Thesis. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>Hybrid</b> <b>Vehicles</b> (<b>HVs)</b> are {{proposed}} {{as a candidate}} to conventional <b>vehicles.</b> Characteristic for <b>HVs</b> {{is the use of}} a temporary energy buffer. But the control of the Primary Power Unit (PPU), e. g. an otto engine or a fuel cell, is much more complex than in conventional vehicles. This paper deals with a method to design a control algorithm for the PPU in a HV. Here, a Finite State Machine (FSM) is used as the control architecture and is trained using an evolutionary algorithm. A control sequence is derived from a simplified vehicle model and used to train the FSM. The evolved FSM is then used to control a much more accurate computer model of a vehicle. A special technique, which is introduced in this paper, has been developed, which considerably increases the speed of evolution. A realistic example of an implementation of a control algorithm in a virtual prototype is also presented...|$|R
40|$|In {{spite of}} {{occasional}} criticism they have attracted, <b>hybrid</b> <b>vehicles</b> (<b>HVs)</b> have been warmly welcomed by industry and academia alike. The key advantages of an HV, including fuel economy and environment friendliness, however, depend greatly on its energy management strategy {{and the way}} its design parameters are “tuned. ” The optimal design and sizing of the HV remain a challenge for the engineering community, due to the variety of criteria and especially dynamic measures related to nature of its working conditions. This paper proposes an optimal design scheme that begins with presenting an energy management strategy based on minimum fuel consumption in finite driving cycle horizon. The strategy utilizes a dynamic programming approach and is consistent with charge sustenance. The sensitivity of the vehicle’s performance metrics to multiple design parameters is then studied using a design of experiments (DOE) methodology.

40|$|One of the {{benefits}} of electric <b>vehicles</b> (EVs) and <b>hybrid</b> <b>vehicles</b> (<b>HVs)</b> is their potential to recuperate braking energy. Regenerative braking (RB) will minimize duty levels on the brakes, giving advantages including extended brake rotor and friction material life and, more significantly, reduced brake mass and minimised brake pad wear. In this thesis, a mathematical analysis (MATLAB) has been used to analyse the accessibility of regenerative braking energy during a single-stop braking event. The results have indicated that a friction brake could be downsized while maintaining the same functional requirements of the vehicle braking in the standard brakes, including thermomechanical performance (heat transfer coefficient estimation, temperature distribution, cooling and stress deformation). This would allow lighter brakes to be designed and fitted with confidence in a normal passenger car alongside a hybrid electric drive. An approach has been established and a lightweight brake disc design analysed FEA and experimentally verified is presented in this research. Thermal performance was a key factor which was studied using the 3 D model in FEA simulations. Ultimately, a design approach for lightweight brake discs suitable for use in any car-sized <b>hybrid</b> <b>vehicle</b> has been developed and tested. The results from experiments on a prototype lightweight brake disc were shown to illustrate the effects of RBS/friction combination in terms of weight reduction. The design requirement, including reducing the thickness, would affect the temperature distribution and increase stress at the critical area. Based on the relationship obtained between rotor weight, thickness and each performance requirement, criteria have been established for designing lightweight brake discs in a vehicle with regenerative braking.

40|$|One of {{the stated}} {{advantages}} of electric <b>vehicles</b> (EVs), and <b>hybrid</b> <b>vehicles</b> (<b>HVs)</b> is {{their ability to}} recuperate braking energy. Regenerative braking (RB) would extend the working range of an EV or HV provided that any extra energy consumption e. g. from increased vehicle mass and system losses did not outweigh the saving from energy recuperation, also reduce duty levels on the brakes themselves, giving advantages including extended brake rotor and friction material life, but more importantly reduced brake mass, minimise brake pad wear. The objective {{of this paper is}} to define how much braking energy could be absorbed by a regenerative braking system (RBS) on a passenger car, hence defining the duty envelope of the friction brake. This will enable lighter brakes to be designed and fitted with confidence in a normal passenger car alongside a hybrid electric drive. In this paper, a mathematical analysis (MATLAB) is used to analyse the availability of regenerative braking energy during a single stop braking event. Secondly a computer simulation model based on Advanced Vehicle Simulator (ADVISOR) is used to simulate both single stop and drive cycle braking. Based on both sets of results it is shown how much of the total braking energy could be absorbed by the RBS of an example hybrid car in single stop braking and drive cycle braking. Thermal performance is a key factor which is studied using FEA simulations. Ultimately a design method for lightweight brakes suitable for use on any car-sized <b>hybrid</b> <b>vehicle</b> will be developed.

40|$|Pollution {{in urban}} centres is {{becoming}} a major societal problem. While pollution is a concern for all urban dwellers, cyclists {{are one of the}} most exposed groups due to their proximity to vehicle tailpipes. Consequently, new solutions are required to help protect citizens, especially cyclists, from the harmful effects of exhaust-gas emissions. In this context, <b>hybrid</b> <b>vehicles</b> (<b>HVs)</b> offer new actuation possibilities that can be exploited in this direction. More specifically, such vehicles when working together as a group, have the ability to dynamically lower the emissions in a given area, thus benefiting citizens, whilst still giving the vehicle owner the flexibility of using an Internal Combustion Engine (ICE). This paper aims to develop an algorithm, that can be deployed in such vehicles, whereby geofences (virtual geographic boundaries) are used to specify areas of low pollution around cyclists. The emissions level inside the geofence is controlled via a coin tossing algorithm to switch the HV motor into, and out of, electric mode, in a manner that is in some sense optimal. The optimality criterion is based on how polluting vehicles inside the geofence are, and the expected density of cyclists near each vehicle. The algorithm is triggered once a vehicle detects a cyclist. Implementations are presented, both in simulation, and in a real vehicle, and the system is tested using a Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) platform (video provided).
