Johnson had told the media {{that he would not}} run the 40-yard dash at the combine but would wait until his March15 workout at Georgia Tech.

500|$|In a 2003 interview, Jordison {{explained}} {{that despite the}} initial problems more than enough material was written for the album and added that [...] "it's better to have stuff to pick from than to settle for shit", in contrast to how Slipknot settled too soon with fewer songs on previous albums. Band members were divided over their experience of working with producer Rubin; some doubted his commitment to Slipknot as he split his time between many artists at once. Lead vocalist Corey Taylor admitted {{in an interview that}} he drank heavily throughout their time in the mansion, saying [...] "I would drink from the moment <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> until the moment I passed out." [...] He {{explained that}}; [...] "everything I did while I was drinking sounded like shit", while expressing how unhappy he was with the choice of vocal takes which ended up on the album.

In his July 29, 1954, review, The New York Times critic A. H. Weiler praised the film, calling it [...] "an uncommonly powerful, exciting, and imaginative use of the screen by gifted professionals." [...] Film critic Roger Ebert lauded the film, stating that Brando and Kazan changed acting in American films forever and added it to his [...] "Great Movies" [...] list. In his autobiography, Brando was typically dismissive of his performance: [...] "On the day Gadg showed me the complete picture, I was so depressed by my performance <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> and left the screening room...

After drinking yet another pint of whiskey, he passed out on the tour bus. By morning he started hallucinating [...] "big spiders, and dinosaurs, huge, and they were gonna step on me". The bus was parked on a beach at the ocean. He was tempted by yet another pint of whiskey that he had hidden. He took the bottle with him onto the beach and fell on his knees and said, [...] "Lord,... I'm gonna throw this bottle. I'm gonna show You that I believe in you. I sailed it into the Pacific... <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up,</b> I knew I had done the right thing."

2500|$|In late 1986, Faith No More {{was signed}} to Los Angeles label Slash Records by Anna Statman. The label had {{recently}} been sold to the Warner Music Group subsidiary London Records, ensuring a widespread release for the band's following albums. Introduce Yourself was released in 1987, and a revamped version of their debut album's title track [...] "We Care a Lot" [...] saw minor success on MTV. Mosley's behaviour had started to become increasingly erratic, particularly during a troubled tour of Europe in 1988. Incidents include him allegedly punching Billy Gould on stage, the release party for the album Introduce Yourself — during which he fell asleep on stage — and one of Mosley's roadies getting into a fist fight with guitarist Jim Martin during the European tour. Mosley was eventually fired after the band returned home from Europe. Billy Gould reflected [...] "There was a certain point when I went to rehearsal, and Chuck wanted to do all acoustic guitar songs. It was just so far off the mark. The upshot was that <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up,</b> walked out and quit the band. I Just said: ‘I’m done – I can’t take this any longer. It’s just so ridiculous’. The same day, I talked to Bordin, and he said: ‘Well, I still {{want to play with}} you’. Bottum did the same thing.

2500|$|With {{about two}} {{minutes left in the}} half, the Dolphins finally managed to get a good drive going on their next possession. Marino {{completed}} seven out of nine passes, the last one being a 30-yard pass to tight end Joe Rose, to reach the 49ers' 12-yard line. However, San Francisco's defense tightened up on the next three plays, forcing two incompletions and a completed pass for no gain, and Miami was forced to settle for von Schamann's second field goal of the game to cut their deficit to 28–13 with 12 seconds left in the half. Then Miami caught a break as the 49ers botched the ensuing kickoff. San Francisco lineman Guy McIntyre received von Schamann's short kick and was about to down the ball, but then changed his mind at the last second and decided to return it. This {{turned out to be a}} big mistake; McIntyre fumbled while being leveled by rookie Joe Carter, and Jim Jensen recovered the ball for Miami at the 49ers' 12-yard line. After that, von Schamann kicked his third field goal on the last play of the half, cutting the score to 28–16. [...] "I can laugh about the play now, but it wasn't funny at the time," [...] McIntyre said after the game. [...] "My first instinct when I got the ball was to fall down. Then I heard everyone yelling, 'Get up! Get up!' So <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up,</b> and here comes someone sneaking underneath me, and he hit the ball." ...|$|E

2500|$|Neely was {{captain of}} the undefeated 1922 team. In {{the second week of}} play Vanderbilt shut out Henderson-Brown 33–0, with Neely scoring a third-quarter touchdown. Despite an injured left arm, he started in the [...] at the {{dedication}} at Dudley Field. Vanderbilt was forced to punt from its seven-yard line early in the first quarter. [...] The Wolverines completed their first pass (from Doug Roby to Paul Goebel), setting in motion a change in field position which placed them inside the five-yard line. The Commodore punt was partially blocked, giving Michigan the ball at Vanderbilt's 25-yard line. Two end runs, two line bucks and a forward pass brought them to first and goal after six minutes. The Commodore defense stiffened, repelling four touchdown tries; three runs up the middle were stopped before the goal line. Franklin Cappon gained a yard, Harry Kipke lost one and Cappon drove to within a foot of the goal; Neely was heard shouting, [...] "Stop 'em!" [...] On fourth down, Michigan faked a field goal and ran with Harry Kipke off tackle to the right. Kipke was tackled inches from the end zone. A Vanderbilt player pushed himself off the goal post to generate a greater backwards push as the crowd cheered. Vanderbilt's only noteworthy offensive play occurred soon afterwards. The Commodores punted out of the shadow of their goalpost after a goal line stand; Neely tackled Kipke (or Irwin Uteritz) hard on the punt return, causing a fumble which he recovered. He then connected on a 20–plus-yard pass to Tot McCullough. This gave Vanderbilt the ball at Michigan's 20-yard line, but subsequent Vanderbilt plays saw runs stopped with little gain and a pass intercepted by Uteritz. The tie was reportedly preserved when Neely recovered a fumble near the Commodore goal. He and Lynn Bomar were acknowledged as Vanderbilt's players of the game, and Neely wept tears of joy by the game's end. Bomar spent much of his day tackling Michigan runners, and Neely was a battered, bruised captain playing hard despite his injuries. Franklin Cappon said after the game, [...] "What sort of a crazy man is this Neely? He played like a fiend and when he tackled me I thought I was broken in two. When <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> he was crying and cussed me out. I was the one who should have been crying".|$|E
