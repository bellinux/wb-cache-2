40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} an experimental and numerical {{study of the}} dynamics and structure of an atmospheric-pressure helium discharge with nitrogen admixture propagating through a thin dielectric tube surrounded by two ring electrodes. The experimental unfiltered optical emission of the discharge {{has been compared to}} the computed emission of the second positive system of nitrogen and shows very good agreement. In all studied cases, the discharge ignition occurs inside the tube at the outer edges of the high-voltage <b>electrode</b> <b>ring,</b> and the discharge propagates outward of both sides of the high-voltage ring with a rather homogeneous discharge front structure. When the discharge ap- proaches the grounded ring, the emission is enhanced and moves from the symmetry axis to the tube surface. In both simulation and experiment, an initial front propagation velocity of about 3 × 106 cm/s is observed as the plasma traverses {{the first part of the}} electrode gap. This velocity increases in the later part of the electrode gap as the plasma approaches the grounded ring, and the observed velocity in the experiment is slightly higher than that in the simulation. In experiments, when the admixture is decreased, the discharge constricts close to the tube axis during its propaga- tion between the electrode rings before moving to the tube surface close to the grounded ring. In simulations, as a first step, we have considered that, in reducing the amount of nitrogen admixture, the efficiency of photoionization decreases significantly. This allows the formation of an electron depleted volume close to the grounded <b>electrode</b> <b>ring,</b> which then constrains the discharge to propagate close to the tube axis, in agreement with experiments...|$|E

The system studied {{consists of an}} insulating cylindrical tube with a ring electrode within its inner circumference, which is filled with electroactive solution, such that electron transfer occurs on the tube's interior surface. The voltammetry is examined {{in terms of the}} dimensions of the <b>electrode</b> <b>ring</b> (radius, re, and width, ze) as well as the voltammetric scan rate and the diffusion coefficient of the electroactive species. Four limiting cases are observed. In the limit re← 1, the voltammetry varies between that expected for a macro-electrode of equivalent area (as ze← 1) and that expected for a microband electrode of equivalent area (as ze← 0). In the limit re← 0, the voltammetry demonstrates thin-layer behaviour as ze← 1. Finally, in the case where re, ze← 0, the confinement of the solution leads to the unusual case of planar diffusion towards a micro/nanoscale electrode with a current response that is equivalent to hypothetical 'macro-electrode' of area twice that of the cross sectional area of the cylinder 2 πr 2 e.

40|$|Electrospinning is {{a useful}} {{technique}} that can generate micro- and nano-meter sized fibers from polymer materials. Modification of the electrospinning parameters and apparatus can generate nanofibers for use in diverse applications ranging from tissue engineering to nanocomposite fabrication; however, electrospun fibers are typically collected in a random orientation and over large areas limiting their applications.   Here we present several methods to control the deposition of electrospun nanofibers, {{such as the use}} of a single auxiliary <b>electrode</b> <b>ring</b> and a negatively charged collector substrate to control the deposition area and the construction of a parallel electrode collector known as the triple electrode setup to control the uniaxial alignment of nanofibers. The numerous constructed setups were advanced by the use of electric field computations to assess the distribution of the electric field and its effect on the deposition behavior and morphology of the electrospun nanofibers. The electrostatic force imposed by the auxiliary electrodes provides converged electric fields that direct the nanofibers to their desired deposition targets. Here it is shown that the use of the auxiliary <b>electrode</b> <b>ring</b> dramatically decreased the deposition area of nanofibers, the negatively charged substrate yielded more uniform nanofibers and the triple electrode setup is a viable method to achieve uniaxially aligned nanofiber mats.    The electrospinning of copolymers appears as an attractive option for enhancing the overall properties of nanofibers as it offers possibility of an intrinsic control of the polymeric material itself. The poly(methyl methacrylate) -graft-poly(dimethylsiloxane) graft copolymer  (PMMA-g-PDMS) is considered to be an organic-inorganic hybrid material with much potential in its use in nanocomposites, and in this work has been successfully synthesized and electrospun via the various constructed electrospinning setups.   In the final elements of this work, the triple electrode setup is used in combination with a dynamic rotating collector to yield a novel collector and has been successfully used to produce PMMA-g-PDMS nanofiber sheets that were further incorporated in a PDMS matrix to yield nanocomposite sheets. A variant of the triple electrode setup with partially insulated electrodes is devised in combination with a methodology to remove the nanofibers from the collector. The nanofibers once removed and dried were incorporated in a PDMS matrix to yield nanocomposites. The preferential dissolution of the fibers from the matrix rendered the fibers to templates and a final porous material with uniaxial nanochannels could be obtained.   This work is believed to be able to lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms of nanofiber deposition and alignment, and should be of help to the design of more practical collecting structures, hence promoting the applications of the electrospinning technique...|$|E
