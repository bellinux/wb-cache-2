40|$|Background/Aim: Dental {{impressions}} {{present a}} negative imprint of intraoral tissues {{of a patient}} which is, by pouring in gypsum, transferred extraorally on the working cast. Casting an accurate and precise working cast presents the first and very important step, since {{each of the following}} stages contributes to the overall error of the production process, which can lead to <b>inadequately</b> <b>fitting</b> dental restorations. The aim {{of this study was to}} promote and test a new model and technique for in vitro evaluation of the dental impression accuracy, as well as to asses the dimensional stability of impression material depending on the material bulk, and its effect on the accuracy of working casts. Methods. Impressions were made by the monophasic technique using the experimental master model. Custom trays with spacing of 1, 2 and 3 mm were constructed by rapid prototyping. The overall of 10 impressions were made with each custom tray. Working casts were made with gypsum type IV. Measurement of working casts was done 24 h later using a co-ordinate measuring machine. Results. The obtained results show that the working casts of all the three custom trays were in most cases significantly different in the transversal and sagittal planes in relation to the master model. The height of abutments was mainly unaffected. The degree of convergence showed certain significance in all the three custom trays, most pronounced in the tray with 3 mm spacing. Conclusion. The impression material bulk of 1 – 3 mm could provide accurate working casts when using the monophasic impression technique. The increase of the distance between abutment teeth influences the accuracy of working casts depending on the material bulk. [Projekat Ministarstva nauke Republike Srbije, br.

The sub-nanometre precision of fitting was reached with this new robust and fast algorithm. The algorithm also does not need precise estimation of parameters for the initial iteration. It allows ISO 10110 characterization with the conic section parameters of surfaces that are rotated and translated as it is common in the data output from measurement devices and alignment markers on lens are not needed. The additional criterion for residuals can effectively remove unuseful data to keep results for the main part of aperture unaffected by local imperfections.

40|$|International audienceAn {{experimental}} {{device for}} textile composite reinforcement forming is presented. A strongly double curved tetrahedral shape is formed by punch and die. This shape is {{those of the}} corner <b>fitting</b> <b>parts</b> used as corner brackets. The device shows that is possible to obtain such geometry by punch and die forming thanks to strong blank holder loads and an appropriate reinforcement. There is no wrinkle in the tetrahedral part of the formed shape but the six blank holders create wrinkles in the plane part of the preform. The shear angles reach 60 ° {{but there is no}} wrinkling in this zone. The presented forming process enables the experimental validation of a semi-discrete simulation approach. It is shown that shear angles and wrinkle shapes obtained by this numerical approach are in good agreement with the forming experiment.

A similarity index between each pair of verbs has been defined as the number of times both verbs of the pair have been ascribed to the same class, and using multidimensional methods six semantic fields have resulted from the analysis : movement and change in place, possession and transfer of possession, modification of a property of an entity or construction of a new entity by <b>fitting</b> <b>parts</b> together, causing damage to an entity by attack or destruction, basic activities necessary for life, processes describing the course of action.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{critical}} issues in the material handling of compliant objects is excessive part deformation. The deformation of compliant sheet metal parts during the handling process can significantly impact both part dimensional quality and production rate. Increasing production rate while maintaining part quality requires an optimal design of the part transfer trajectory. This paper describes a new methodology of time-optimal trajectory planning for compliant parts by discretizing the part transfer path into N segments that have equal horizontal distance and by approximating the trajectory as having piecewise constant acceleration that can only change its value {{at the end of each}} segment. The contribution of the methodology is that part deformation determined by transfer velocity and acceleration is considered as a nonlinear constraint, which is obtained from FEA simulation and model <b>fitting.</b> <b>Part</b> permanent deformation, trajectory smoothness, and static obstacle avoidance are also considered. The methodology is validated by simulations at different motion conditions and obstacle configurations.
