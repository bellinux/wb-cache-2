The main advantages of PNCC over conventional sensors are exceptional sensitivity in finger pressure range and possibility to be embedded into soft structures. The current PNCC {{can be made}} when certain amount (usually percolative concentration) of high structure electroconductive filler is dispersed into elastomer matrix and vulcanized afterwards. In this work we specify the percolation threshold for natural polyisoprene rubber filled with Degussa Printex XE 2 extra electro-conductive high structure (nanostructured) carbon black, depending on methods of dispersing. After obtaining optimal composition we present a completely soft PNCC pressure sensor prototype, made using multi-gradient approach, when elementary layers with different filler concentration are cured together and forms uniform sensor body with integrated soft electrodes. Afterwards we couple it with simplified analog <b>impulse</b> <b>counter.</b> The prototype system elaborated {{could be used for}} counting of interface events between sensor and external environmental factor.

These SNARE proteins work together to drive fusion, but the individual effects of each of these proteins are still undetermined. We show that syntaxin can be reconstituted into the membranes of artificial vesicles for in vitro fusion experiments. The nystatin/ergosterol fusion assay was used to measure individual fusion events of artificial vesicles to a planar lipid bilayer formed on hole of a plastic cup. We found that reconstituted syntaxin has a possible hindering effect on fusion in the absence of other SNARE proteins, but further testing is necessary to confirm this hypothesis. Furthermore, we suggest that syntaxin keeps vesicles from sticking together, The nervous system of the human body is quite complex.

50|$|Tsai's {{interactive}} sculpture {{marked a}} major step {{in the development of}} kinetic art:A major portion of luminist and kinetic art originated in Europe, beginning with the formation in 1960 of GRAV (Groupe de Recherche d’Art Visuel) by eleven artists of different nationalities, all resident in Paris. Wen-Ying Tsai is an American associate who showed with that group at the Galerie Denise Rene, which made its reputation on technology art. Tsai is a Chinese-born sculptor now living in New York. The slender, stainless steel “cybernetic” rods of his sculpture vibrate in different patterns in response to <b>electronic</b> <b>impulses,</b> to the clapping of human hands, or to the flashes of a strobe light. In the artist’s words, they are designed to simulate “the intensity of a living creature.” While the contemporary interest in light and kinetic sculpture is in a sense traditional, and dates back at least to Naum Gabo, to Marcel Duchamp, Moholy-Nagy and the Bauhaus, only in the postwar era has the artist tried consciously to use available computer and electronic technology to create robot works of art which can be activated environmentally.|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{character}} of the original source materials and the nature of batch digitization, quality control issues may be present in this document. Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Experiments were conducted to determine the reproductive potential of herd sires by: 1) an evaluation of age and genotype effects on semen quality and response to electroejaculation, 2) a serving capacity test to compare the profile of copulatory activity between two genotypes and, 3) a combination of both semen evaluation and a social interaction test to categorize bulls as either dominant or subordinate. In Experiment 1, fewer <b>electronic</b> <b>impulses</b> were needed to ejaculate 1 -year-old than 2 -year-old bulls (P<. 001) via electroejaculation. In 3 -year-old bulls, a genotype difference was observed with the Fl Gelbvieh x Red Angus requiring fewer <b>electronic</b> <b>impulses</b> than either the Santa Gertrudis or Simmental bulls (P<. 002). Scrotal circumference was influenced by age and genotype. One-year-old bulls had a smaller scrotal circumference than 2 -year-old bulls (P<. 0004), and F, Gelbvieh x Red Angus bulls had a larger scrotal circumference than the Composite (1 / 2 Santa Gertrudis, 1 / 4 Red Angus, 1 / 4 Gelbvieh) and Santa Gertrudis genotypes (P<. 003). An age by genotype effect (P<. 02) on sperm motility was observed for the 1 -and 2 -year-old bulls. The percentages of normal and motile sperm increased from 1 to 2 years of age (P<. 0001). Santa Gertrudis bulls had a lower percentage of motile sperm than the Fl Gelbvieh x Red Angus and Composite genotypes (P<. 0053). Results of Experiment 2 indicate that serving capacity may be assessed by a 20 minute test duration in Composite bulls, while a 30 -minute serving capacity test is suggested to evaluate copulatory proficiency of Santa Gertrudis bulls. Pregnancy rate, interval to conception and calving date in single-sire breeding groups were significantly influenced by bull social rank in Experiment 3. Subordinate bulls had a shorter interval to conception (P<. 0001) and had a higher pregnancy rate than dominant bulls (P<. 0001). We conclude that yearling bulls respond more rapidly to electroejaculation stimuli than older bulls, duration of a serving capacity test can be reduced for Composite genotypes and social rank can influence pregnancy rate in a single-sire breeding group...|$|R

The relative shares of each of the three modes of communication may vary as one mode partially substitutes for another, but the absolute amounts of communication via each mode are likely to increase. Two empirical studies are summarized, one illustrating that teleconferencing increased travel, the other illustrating that telecommuting decreased travel.

40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the manipulation of a virtual character using real-time movement of 6 -degree-of-freedom controllers. To this end, several Jacobian-based IK methods were implemented, which use an approximation of the inverse of the Jacobian matrix to calculate changes in DOF values {{that will lead to}} the desired position and orientation of the end effector (the last link in the joint chain representing the arm). These methods include the Jacobian Tranpose, Jacobian Pseudoinverse, and Damped Least Squares. Joint limits are enforced through clamping of orientation, as well as the temporary removal of some of the joint's degrees of freedom. Collisions are handled within the Jacobian matrix itself by adding additional effectors for each contact, with a correctional <b>impulse</b> <b>counter</b> to the contact's direction and magnitude based on contact depth. A weight-based approach is used to handle priority of the constraints, those being the end effector's position, its rotation, and contact constraints. The ?final solution is a set of joint angle changes for each frame in the simulation that should result in a realistic motion closely approximating the actual controller's movement, while taking collision constraints into account. The context of the implementation of these techniques is the BirthPlay application, which simulates uncommon or difficult birth operations to train obstetricians in the proper procedures. The implementation produces good solutions for basic inverse kinematics problems, but the collision response method results in extremely slow convergence for configurations with contacts...|$|R

Such errors can be avoided by using opto-electronic measuring devices that enable measurement of particles from 10 μm up to a few dozen millimetres in size. The results of measurement of each particle size fraction are summed up proportionally to its weight with the use of Elsieve software system and for every type of material particle-size distribution can be obtained. The software allows further statistical interpretation of the results. Beam of infrared radiation identifies size of particles and counts them precisely. Every particle is represented by an <b>electronic</b> <b>impulse</b> proportional to its size.
