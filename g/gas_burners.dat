40|$|Abstract: The {{characteristics}} of the combustion temperature, flow velocity, CO distribution and NOx emissions of a 10 MW <b>gas</b> <b>burner</b> at different primary to secondary air ratios are numerically studied using computational fluid dynamics software Fluent. The {{results indicate that the}} primary to secondary air ratio in <b>gas</b> <b>burner</b> determines the combustion quality through influencing some parameters directly, such as the combustion efficiency, combustion intensity, profile and stability of flame as well as emission of NOx. Then two evaluation indexes of combustion quality are summarized after analyzing the flame structure and {{characteristics of}} the flow. The detailed results reported in this paper may provide a useful basis for NOx reduction and premixed <b>gas</b> <b>burner</b> design. Finally some proposals are given to choose the optimal primary to secondary air ratio for a <b>gas</b> <b>burner...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to study the promotion combustion efficiency of the domestic <b>gas</b> <b>burner</b> with various <b>gas</b> <b>burner,</b> height of frame, first air, nozzle diameter, and gas pressure. The production quantity of nature gas is offered with shortage in Taiwan. The phenomenon had not been shown until 1990 {{due to the fact that}} our country import liquefied natura 1 gas from abroad. The natural gas powerhouse, compressed natural gas car, LNG cold energy utilization and LNG air-conditioning, etc. are therefore needed to develop so that a higher technology level and perversive environment could be achieved. Relevant definitions for the fundamental theory in combustion and burner design for domestic natural gas appliances also needs to making. This paper studies the fundamental aspects of the four main components of the Bunser burner, such as the injector, air entrainment, mixing tube design, and burner port geometry. The experiment results are shown that the LPG and NG <b>gas</b> <b>burner</b> can converse to LNG <b>gas</b> <b>burner</b> when the inner ring is 0. 7 0. 9 mm and the outer ring is 1. 7 1. 9 mm. The effect of the height of <b>gas</b> <b>burner</b> frame with combustion efficiency is very strong. The optimum of the height of <b>gas</b> <b>burner</b> frame are 2. 0 3. 5 cm and 3. 0 4. 5 cm for small and large type pot respectively. The maximum input heat of the domestic <b>gas</b> <b>burner</b> is optimum when the value is 0. 40 0. 50 m□/hr. The gas pressure should be adapted to 150 ± 50 mmH□O.

60|$|A {{long walk}} through smooth, asphaltum-paved streets bordered by blocks of vast new mercantile houses of cream-colored stone every house and every block {{precisely}} {{like all the}} other houses and all the other blocks for a mile, and all brilliantly lighted--brought us at last to the principal thoroughfare. On every hand were bright colors, flashing constellations of <b>gas</b> <b>burners,</b> gaily dressed men and women thronging the sidewalks --hurry, life, activity, cheerfulness, conversation, and laughter everywhere! We found the Grand Hotel du Louvre et de la Paix, and wrote down who we were, where we were born, what our occupations were, the place we came from last, whether we were married or single, how we liked it, how old we were, where we were bound for and when we expected to get there, {{and a great deal of}} information of similar importance--all for the benefit of the landlord and the secret police. We hired a guide and began the business of sightseeing immediately. That first night on French soil was a stirring one. I cannot think of half the places we went to or what we particularly saw; we had no disposition to examine carefully into anything at all--we only wanted to glance and go--to move, keep moving! The spirit of the country was upon us. We sat down, finally, at a late hour, in the great Casino, and called for unstinted champagne. It is so easy to be bloated aristocrats where it costs nothing of consequence! There were about five hundred people in that dazzling place, I suppose, though the walls being papered entirely with mirrors, so to speak, one could not really tell but that there were a hundred thousand. Young, daintily dressed exquisites and young, stylishly dressed women, and also old gentlemen and old ladies, sat in couples and groups about innumerable marble-topped tables and ate fancy suppers, drank wine, and kept up a chattering din of conversation that was dazing to the senses. There was a stage at the far end and a large orchestra; and every now and then actors and actresses in preposterous comic dresses came out and sang the most extravagantly funny songs, to judge by their absurd actions; but that audience merely suspended its chatter, stared cynically, and never once smiled, never once applauded! I had always thought that Frenchmen were ready to laugh at any thing.|$|E

40|$|It {{is known}} that the Pressurized Water Reactors (PWRs), which {{are the most common}} type of nuclear reactor {{existing}} today, usually used to provide a base load electricity. In order to be able to compete with other generation types (fossil and renewables), it would be desirable to develop PWRs with flexible load following capabilities to cope with varying electricity demand, especially in deregulated markets. The thermal efficiency of PWRs can be increased by fitting the power plant with conventional fossil fuel superheaters. This hybrid system has been hypothesised to be able to adjust the power output and the cycle efficiency of PWRs. Such mode of operation would also improve the efficiency of converting the fossil fuel heat because it is applied only at the superheater stage. There are several ways to supply the heat to the superheaters, for example, by using the exhaust gas from the gas turbines and using the conventional <b>gas</b> <b>burner.</b> In this paper, the thermodynamic performance of the hybrid system (PWR with superheater) is investigated for large reactor and Small Modular Reactor (SMR) application. The thermal efficiency of the AP 1000 can be improved from 30. 2 % to 45. 8 % (with CCGT), 35. 6 % (with <b>gas</b> <b>burner),</b> and 36. 6 % (<b>gas</b> <b>burner</b> with reheating). The thermal efficiency of the SMR can be improved from 33. 4 % to nearly 45 % (with CCGT), 35. 5 % (with <b>gas</b> <b>burner),</b> and 37. 4 % (<b>gas</b> <b>burner</b> with reheating). The analysis results show that it is possible for the hybrid system to operate between 65 % and the full power load.
