5|$|Chard {{claims to}} be the birthplace of powered flight, as it was here in 1848 that the Victorian {{aeronautical}} pioneer John Stringfellow (1799–1883) first demonstrated that <b>engine-powered</b> flight was possible through his work on the Aerial Steam Carriage. James Gillingham (1839–1924) from Chard pioneered the development of articulated artificial limbs when he produced a prosthesis for a man who lost his arm in a cannon accident in 1863. Chard Museum has a display of Gillingham's work.|$|E
5|$|Pettigrew State Park is {{open for}} year-round recreation, {{including}} hiking, fishing, camping, boating and picnicking. Lake Phelps is open to canoes, kayaks, rowboats and <b>engine-powered</b> boats. Launch ramps are available at Cypress Point and behind the park offices on Lake Shore Drive. There is a canoe trail in the canals that were built during the plantation era. The Scuppernong River is also open to most types of watercraft.|$|E
5|$|Word of the dogfight spread {{throughout}} the area, and an air alert was quickly posted over Seoul. In response, four F-80C Shooting Star aircraft of the 35th Fighter-Bomber Squadron under US Captain Raymond E. Schillereff were posted in the skies over Seoul to counter any North Korean aircraft appearing in the area. The F-80s were jet <b>engine-powered</b> fighter aircraft which would easily defeat all of the aircraft known in the North Koreans' air force.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} the Medal of Honor, Hudner {{was transferred to}} the United States and served as a flight instructor at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi in Texas in 1952 and 1953. Following this, he served as a staff officer for Carrier Division 3, which at the time was part of Task Force 77 and operating around Japan, in 1953 and 1954. In 1955 and 1956, he served in Air Development Squadron 3 at Naval Air Station Atlantic City in New Jersey, where he flew developmental and experimental aircraft. During this time, he was trained on jet <b>engine-powered</b> aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Chard {{claims to}} be the birthplace of powered flight, as it was here in 1848 that the Victorian {{aeronautical}} pioneer John Stringfellow first demonstrated that <b>engine-powered</b> flight was possible through his work on the Aerial Steam Carriage. North Petherton was the first town in England (and one of the few ever) to be lit by acetylene gas lighting, supplied by the North Petherton Rosco Acetylene Company. Street lights were provided in 1906. Acetylene was replaced in 1931 by coal gas produced in Bridgwater, {{as well as by the}} provision of an electricity supply.|$|E
5|$|Textile {{manufacture}} {{was important}} to the town during the Middle Ages. Chard is the birthplace of powered flight as in 1848 John Stringfellow first demonstrated that <b>engine-powered</b> flight was possible. Percy and Ernist Petter, who formed Westland Aircraft Works, witnessed some of Stringfellow's demonstrations in Chard and often asked for help {{in the formation of}} Westland's first aircraft development factory on the outskirts of Yeovil. AgustaWestland now holds the Henson and Stringfellow lecture yearly for the RAeS. James Gillingham developed articulated artificial limbs. Chard is a key point on the Taunton Stop Line, a World War II defensive line.|$|E
5|$|Upon the {{outbreak}} of the Korean War, Davis continued to serve in the 71st Squadron and did not see combat in the initial phase of the war. As it progressed, however, Davis began training on the F-86 Sabre (Sabrejet), the latest jet <b>engine-powered</b> fighter. On February 15, 1951, he was promoted to major and in October 1951 he was assigned to the headquarters of the 4th Fighter-Interceptor Wing, which was based in Japan and operating aircraft throughout Korea. As such, Davis was sent to the conflict as a fighter pilot.|$|E

25|$|The 19th century saw {{improvements}} to {{roads in the}} region {{with the introduction of}} turnpikes and the building of canals and railways. The usefulness of the canals was short-lived, though they have now been restored for recreation. Chard claims to be the birthplace of powered flight, in 1848 when the Victorian aeronautical pioneer John Stringfellow first demonstrated that <b>engine-powered</b> flight was possible through his work on the Aerial Steam Carriage. North Petherton was the first town in England (and one of the few ever) to be lit by acetylene gas lighting.|$|E
25|$|Many of the {{earliest}} locomotives for American railroads were imported from Great Britain, including first the Stourbridge Lion and later the John Bull (still the oldest operable <b>engine-powered</b> vehicle in the United States of any kind, as of 1981) however a domestic locomotive-manufacturing industry was quickly established. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's Tom Thumb in 1830, designed and built by Peter Cooper, was the first US-built locomotive to run in America, although it {{was intended as a}} demonstration of the potential of steam traction, rather than as a revenue-earning locomotive. The DeWitt Clinton was also built in the 1830s.|$|E
25|$|They {{became popular}} in industrialised {{countries}} from around 1850, {{when the first}} self-propelled portable steam engines for agricultural use were developed. Production continued well into {{the early part of}} the 20th century, when competition from internal combustion <b>engine–powered</b> tractors saw them fall out of favour, although some continued in commercial use in the United Kingdom well into the 1950s and later. All types of traction engines have now been superseded, in commercial use. However, several thousand examples have been preserved worldwide, many in working order. Steam fairs are held throughout the year in the United Kingdom, and in other countries, where visitors can experience working traction engines at close hand.|$|E
25|$|An {{autogyro}} (from Greek αὐτός + γύρος, self-turning), {{also known}} as gyroplane, gyrocopter, or rotaplane, {{is a type of}} rotorcraft that uses an unpowered rotor in autorotation to develop lift, and an <b>engine-powered</b> propeller, similar to that of a fixed-wing aircraft, to provide thrust. While similar to a helicopter rotor in appearance, the autogyro's rotor must have air flowing through the rotor disc to generate rotation. Invented by the Spanish engineer Juan de la Cierva to create an aircraft that could fly safely at low speeds, the autogyro was first flown on 9 January 1923, at Cuatro Vientos Airfield in Madrid. De la Cierva's aircraft resembled the fixed-wing aircraft of the day, with a front-mounted engine and propeller in a tractor configuration to pull the aircraft through the air.|$|E
25|$|A {{skid loader}} or {{skid steer loader}} is a small rigid frame, <b>engine-powered</b> machine with lift arms used to attach {{a wide variety of}} {{labor-saving}} tools or attachments. Though sometimes they are equipped with tracks, skid-steer loaders are typically four-wheel drive vehicles that can push material from one location to another, carry material in its bucket, or load material into a truck or trailer. Brothers Louis and Cyrill Keller co-invented the first skid-steer loader, which was based around a three-wheeled loader they developed in 1957 for a turkey farmer near Rothsay, Minnesota. In September 1958, they were hired by the Melroe brothers at Melroe Manufacturing Company in Gwinner, North Dakota, which was later to become Bobcat Company. Using the brothers' design, Melroe introduced the M60 Self-Propelled Loader and, in 1960, Louis added a rear drive axle, resulting in the M400 model, the world's first true skid-steer loader.|$|E
25|$|Turbochargers {{were first}} used in {{production}} aircraft engines {{such as the}} Napier Lioness in the 1920s, although they were less common than engine-driven centrifugal superchargers. Ships and locomotives equipped with turbocharged diesel engines began appearing in the 1920s. Turbochargers were also used in aviation, most widely used by the United States. During World War II, notable examples of U.S. aircraft with turbochargers — which included mass-produced ones designed by General Electric for American aviation use — include the B-17 Flying Fortress, B-24 Liberator, P-38 Lightning, and P-47 Thunderbolt. The technology was also used in experimental fittings {{by a number of}} other manufacturers, notably a variety of experimental inline <b>engine-powered</b> Focke-Wulf Fw 190 prototype models, with some developments for their design coming from the DVL, a predecessor of today's DLR agency, but the need for advanced high-temperature metals in the turbine, that were not readily available for production purposes during wartime, kept them out of widespread use.|$|E
500|$|The United States Air Force had 1,172 {{aircraft}} in the Pacific region {{at the time of}} the outbreak of the Korean War, including hundreds of F-80 Shooting Stars [...] as well as numerous F-82 Twin Mustangs, B-26 Invaders, B-29 Superfortresses, among others. Hundreds of aircraft were available to be immediately mustered against the North Korean invasion, many of them the newest jet <b>engine-powered</b> fighter aircraft. The aircraft could fulfill a variety of missions and were well equipped, well armed and out of reach of North Korean attack, with many bases safely in Japan. Additionally, the Fleet Air Arm of the United Kingdom, and the Royal Australian Air Force of Australia provided assistance as 800 Naval Air Squadron, 802 Naval Air Squadron, and No. 77 Squadron RAAF were dispatched to provide additional support for ground operations. The combined airpower had about 33,975 personnel.|$|E
500|$|In 1913 Bielovucic was {{the first}} to {{successfully}} cross the Alps by airplane, flying a Hanriot monoplane powered by a [...] engine, completing the crossing first attempted by his late countrymate Jorge Chávez on 23 September 1910. Chávez had almost completed his flight, but lost control of his final descent, crashed from an altitude of , and sustained fatal injuries. Bielovucic chose to cross the Alps in winter because he noted that the Alpine winds were less frequent then. His first attempt of 14 January failed, and he returned to the starting airfield. He made a second attempt to cross on 25 January, taking off from Brig-Glis, Switzerland at noon, and successfully landed in Domodossola in Italy at 12:25. During the flight, he reached an altitude of , setting another record. Later that year, he set another climb rate record, climbing [...] in 150 seconds in a [...] Le Rhône <b>engine-powered</b> Ponnier monoplane.|$|E
500|$|Ice cores are {{collected}} by cutting around a cylinder {{of ice in}} a way that enables it to be brought to the surface. [...] Early cores were often collected with hand augers and they are still used for short holes. A design for ice core augers was patented in 1932 and they have changed little since. [...] An auger is essentially a cylinder with helical metal ribs (known as flights) wrapped around the outside, {{at the lower end of}} which are cutting blades. [...] Hand augers can be rotated by a T handle or a brace handle, and some can be attached to handheld electric drills to power the rotation. [...] With the aid of a tripod for lowering and raising the auger, cores up to 50m deep can be retrieved, but the practical limit is about 30m for <b>engine-powered</b> augers, and less for hand augers. [...] Below this depth, electromechanical or thermal drills are used.|$|E
500|$|Employment {{of local}} people {{is low in}} the {{industrial}} facilities. The main occupations of the local people by industry are service (28.76%), commerce (21.53%), and agriculture (24.12%). Out of [...] of cultivable land 25.46% yield a single crop, 57.95% yield double and 16.59% a treble crop annually. Bean, melon, rubber and betel leaf are the main agricultural exports. Fishing has traditionally been an industry restricted to low caste Hindus belonging to the fisher class, although since the last decades of the 20th century {{an increasing number of}} Muslims have joined the sector. Due to the introduction of <b>engine-powered</b> boats and gill nets, there was a rise in fish catches between the 1970s and 1990s, especially in the major fishing season (mid-July to mid-November). Over-fishing, however, has depleted the fish population and some fish species are facing extinction in the area, leading to seasonal food insecurity (February to April). According to a 2001 survey, 4,000 people in Sitakunda were engaged in wild shrimp fry collection, harvesting an average of five-and-a-half million fries a year.|$|E
2500|$|Early {{internal}} combustion <b>engine-powered</b> locomotives and railmotors used gasoline as their fuel. Soon after Dr. Rudolf Diesel patented his first {{compression ignition engine}} in 1898, it was considered for railway propulsion. [...] Progress was slow, however, as several problems had to be overcome.|$|E
2500|$|Vittorio Bonomi, an Italian {{sailplane}} manufacturer, was {{contracted to}} build the aircraft.

2500|$|A HICE {{forklift}} or HICE {{lift truck}} is a hydrogen fueled, internal combustion <b>engine-powered</b> industrial forklift truck used for lifting and transporting materials. [...] The first production HICE forklift truck {{based on the}} Linde X39 Diesel was presented at an exposition in Hannover on May 27, 2008. It used a 2.0 litre, [...] diesel internal combustion engine converted to use hydrogen as a fuel {{with the use of}} a compressor and direct injection.|$|E
2500|$|However, as the 1960s progressed, {{more and}} more {{specialised}} versions were developed. As well as the standard 'GS' (General Service) vehicles, a common variant was the 'FFR' (Fitted For Radio', which had 24-volt electrics and a large <b>engine-powered</b> generator to power on-board radios. There were also Ambulances on the [...] Series II and Series III chassis. A well-known version was the LRDPV (Long-Range Desert Patrol Vehicle), commonly called the 'Pink Panther', on account of their distinctive light pink sand camouflage. These [...] Series IIs were converted by Marshall's of Cambridge by being stripped of doors and windscreens and fitted with grenade launchers, a machine gun mounting ring and long-range fuel tanks and water tanks. They were used by the SAS for desert patrol and special operations.|$|E
2500|$|A Philippine pedicab {{is called}} a traysikad, trisikad [...] or simply sikad or padyak, from the Philippine word meaning to tramp or stamp one's feet. [...] It is made by {{mounting}} a sidecar to a regular bicycle. They are used mainly to ferry passengers short distances along smaller, more residential streets, often to or from jeepneys or other public utility vehicles. [...] They are also used for transporting cargo too heavy to carry by hand and over a distance too short or roads too congested for motor transport, such as a live pig. During rainy seasons, they are useful {{as a way to}} avoid walking through flood waters. [...] Along with the jeepney, the motorcycle-powered tricycle, and the <b>engine-powered</b> kuliglig, the open-air pedicab provides shade when needed.|$|E
2500|$|The United States Army Air Forces {{activated}} Air Defense Command (ADC) in 1946, with a Numbered Air Force of {{the former}} Continental Air Forces, from which it took its mission of air warning and air defense. [...] In September 1947, it {{became part of the}} newly established United States Air Force. [...] The command become a subordinate organization of Continental Air Command (ConAC) on 1 December 1948. [...] ConAC gradually assumed direct charge of ADC air defense components, and ADC inactivated on 1 July 1950. [...] But five months later, on 10 November 1950, Generals Vandenberg and Twining notified General Whitehead that [...] "the Air Force had approved activation of a separate Air Defense Command [...] with headquarters on Ent" [...] with the mission to stop a handful of conventionally armed piston <b>engine-powered</b> bombers on a one-way mission. The command was formally reactivated on 1 January 1951.|$|E
2500|$|Before World War II, Mare Island {{had been}} in a continual state of upbuilding. By 1941, new {{projects}} included improvements to the central power plant, a new pattern storage building, a large foundry, machine shop, magazine building, paint shop, new administration building, and a huge storehouse. The yard was expected to be able to repair and paint six to eight large naval vessels at a time. Several finger piers had recently been built, as well as a new shipbuilding wharf, adding one [...] and one [...] berth. It employed 5,593 workers at the beginning of 1939, and rapidly increased to 18,500 busily engaged by May 1941, with a monthly payroll of $3,500,000 (1941). Then came the attack on Pearl Harbor. In 1941, the drafting department had expanded to three buildings accommodating over 400 naval architects, engineers and draftsmen. The hospital carried 584 bed patients. Mare Island became one of the Navy's shipbuilding sites in World War II specializing in building diesel <b>engine-powered</b> submarines; they eventually built 32 of them. After the war was over, Mare Island became a premier site for building nuclear-powered submarines, building 27 of them.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{example of}} a {{rotating}} device in which a reactive centrifugal force can be identified {{used to describe the}} system behavior is the centrifugal clutch. [...] A centrifugal clutch is used in small <b>engine-powered</b> devices such as chain saws, go-karts and model helicopters. It allows the engine to start and idle without driving the device, but automatically and smoothly engages the drive as the engine speed rises. A spring is used to constrain the spinning clutch shoes. At low speeds, the spring provides the centripetal force to the shoes, which move to larger radius as the speed increases and the spring stretches under tension. [...] At higher speeds, when the shoes can't move any further out to increase the spring tension, due to the outer drum, the drum provides some of the centripetal force that keeps the shoes moving in a circular path. The force of tension applied to the spring, and the outward force applied to the drum by the spinning shoes are the corresponding reactive centrifugal forces. [...] The mutual force between the drum and the shoes provides the friction needed to engage the output drive shaft that is connected to the drum. Thus the centrifugal clutch illustrates both the fictitious centrifugal force and the reactive centrifugal force.|$|E
2500|$|In closed environments, the {{concentration}} of carbon monoxide can easily rise to lethal levels. On average, 170 people in the United States die every year from carbon monoxide produced by non-automotive consumer products. However, according to the Florida Department of Health, [...] "every year more than 500 Americans die from accidental exposure to carbon monoxide and thousands more across the U.S. require emergency medical care for non-fatal carbon monoxide poisoning" [...] These products include malfunctioning fuel-burning appliances such as furnaces, ranges, water heaters, and gas and kerosene room heaters; <b>engine-powered</b> equipment such as portable generators; fireplaces; and charcoal that is burned in homes and other enclosed areas. The American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC) reported 15,769 cases of carbon monoxide poisoning resulting in 39 deaths in 2007. In 2005, the CPSC reported 94 generator-related carbon monoxide poisoning deaths. Forty-seven of these deaths were known to have occurred during power outages due to severe weather, including Hurricane Katrina. Still others die from carbon monoxide produced by non-consumer products, such as cars left running in attached garages. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that several thousand people go to hospital emergency rooms every year to be treated for carbon monoxide poisoning.|$|E
