5|$|In {{standard}} {{models of}} international trade a fall {{in the price of}} a country's export good – a deterioration in its terms of trade – generally decreases the home country's welfare. In the Brander–Spencer model however the opposite is true. This is because in this model the markets are not perfectly competitive and the revenue from the expanded quantity sold compensates the firm for the revenue lost from the lower <b>export</b> <b>price.</b> If the good produced by the firm is also consumed domestically however the result is a bit more complicated. In the case where the firm is able to separate the home and export market (charge different prices in each with no possibility of third party arbitrage) then the level of the optimal subsidies will depend on whether marginal costs of production are constant, increasing or decreasing. The optimal subsidy level is either the same, higher or lower, respectively, compared to the level with no domestic consumption. This underscores the need {{on the part of the}} government for very precise information on industry structure and firm's cost functions.|$|E

[...] A U.S. {{producer}} exporting a car to Germany will not be charged the U.S. sales tax, but will be charged the VAT. [...] Since a German domestic producer will also be charged a VAT, both companies are on equal footing in Germany. [...] Similarly, a U.S. company selling a car domestically will be charged a sales tax as will the German manufacturer attempting to sell in the U.S. [...] However, if Germany did not remit the VAT on export, the German producer would be charged both the sales tax and the VAT tax, thus facing a price distortion.

This paper examines the extent to which Australia’s <b>export</b> <b>prices</b> relate to the world prices using quarterly time-series data spanning the period 1969 q 4 - 2002 q 3. The empirical results based on dynamic least squares method show that Australia’s <b>export</b> <b>prices</b> are cointegrated with the global <b>export</b> <b>prices.</b> A short-term dynamic ARCH-in Mean model, which captures the time varying nature of price volatility, has been used to explain the growth rate of Australia’s <b>export</b> <b>prices.</b> It is found that (a) changes in Australia’s <b>export</b> <b>prices</b> are highly associated with systematic changes in world export prices; (b) the diversification of Australia’s export base has contributed to a significant reduction in the volatility of <b>export</b> <b>prices</b> during the study period; and (c) the time varying volatility has not undermined, in a significant manner, the growth rate of Australia’s <b>export</b> <b>prices...</b>|$|R

A vast sample of Italian micro data is used to study the behavior of relative <b>export</b> <b>prices</b> in imperfect markets. It is shown that relative <b>export</b> <b>prices,</b> the relation of prices a firm charges on export and domestic markets, are, in general, downward biased. Moreover, relative <b>export</b> <b>prices</b> depend negatively on firm size and market concentration, but positively on the average export share of the industry.

In particular, it evaluates the impact of <b>export</b> <b>prices</b> on the Australian rate of inflation, {{the rate of growth}} of the economy and the unemployment rate. In the first analysis inflation is decomposed into two sources-one due to the growth of wages and the other due to the growth of non-wage income. The latter depends strongly on the growth in <b>export</b> <b>prices.</b> A macroeonometric model shows that <b>export</b> <b>prices</b> affected economic growth and the unemployment rate which was also negatively related to wages and the tariff rate.

The finding of a positive and significant correlation between less credit-constrained exporters and <b>export</b> <b>prices</b> contradicts the prediction of standard models of trade with heterogeneous firms and credit constraints.
