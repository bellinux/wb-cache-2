[...] Under aerobic, moderate pH conditions ferrous iron is oxidized spontaneously to the ferric (...) form and is hydrolyzed abiotically to insoluble <b>ferric</b> <b>hydroxide</b> (...) [...] [...] There are three distinct types of ferrous iron-oxidizing microbes. [...] The first are acidophiles, {{such as the}} bacteria Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans and Leptospirillum ferrooxidans, {{as well as the}} archaeon Ferroplasma. [...] These microbes oxidize iron in environments that have a very low pH and are important in acid mine drainage. [...] The second type of microbes oxidize ferrous iron at near-neutral pH. These micro-organisms (for example Gallionella ferruginea, Leptothrix ochracea, or Mariprofundus ferrooxydans) live at the oxic-anoxic interfaces and are [...] microaerophiles. [...] The third type of iron-oxidizing microbes are anaerobic photosynthetic bacteria such as Rhodopseudomonas, which use ferrous iron to produce NADH for autotrophic carbon dioxide fixation. [...] Biochemically, aerobic iron oxidation is a very energetically poor process which therefore requires large amounts of iron to be oxidized by the enzyme rusticyanin to facilitate the formation of proton motive force. [...] Like sulfur oxidation, reverse electron flow must be used to form the NADH used for carbon dioxide fixation via the Calvin cycle.|$|E

A composite cement based on the partial replacement of ordinary Portland cement (OPC) with pulverised fuel ash (PFA) is used.

The BioIronTech process comprises the following steps: 1) anoxic bacterial reduction of Fe(III), for example in iron ore powder; 2) surface renovation of iron ore particles due to the formation of dissolved Fe 2 + ions; 3) precipitation of insoluble ferrous salts of inorganic anions (phosphate) or organic anions (phenols and organic acids); 4) (bio) oxidation of ferrous compunds with the formation of negatively, positively, or neutrally charged <b>ferric</b> <b>hydroxides,</b> which are good adsorbents of many pollutants; 5) disposal or thermal regeration of ferric (hydr) oxide. Different organic substances can be used as electron donors in bioreduction of Fe(III). Ferrous ions and fresh ferrous or <b>ferric</b> <b>hydroxides</b> that are produced after iron bioreduction and (bio) oxidation adsorb and precipitate diferent negatively charged molecules, for example chlorinated compounds of sucralose production wastewater or other halogenated organics, as well as phenols, organic acids, phosphate, and sulphide. Reject water (return liquor) from the stage of sewage sludge dewatering on municipal wastewater treatment plants represents from 10 to 50 % of phosphorus load when being recycled to the aeration tank. BioIronTech process can remove/recover more than 90 % of phosphorous from this reject water thus replacing the conventional process of phosphate precipitation by ferric/ferrous salts, which are 20 – 100 times more expensive than iron ore, which is used in BioIronTech process. BioIronTech process can remarkably improve the aerobic and anaerobic treatments of municipal and industrial wastewaters, especially anaerobic digestion of lipid- and sulphate-containing food-processing wastewater. It can also remove the recalcitrant compounds from industrial wastewater, enhance sustainability and quality of water resources,restore eutrophicated lakes due to removal of phosphate, ammonium, and pesticides from water, and recover ammonium and phosphate from municipal and food-processing wastes...|$|R

The model also applies to Martian impact melt sheets, which have a total volume greater than a global layer 60 m thick. Hydrothermal circulation of steam in Martian melt sheets may have produced iron-rich alteration clays, <b>ferric</b> <b>hydroxides,</b> and near-surface accumulations of salts.

Sulphur dioxide has many impurities such as vapours, dust particles and arsenous oxide. Therefore, {{it must be}} purified to avoid catalyst poisoning (i.e.: destroying catalytic activity and loss of efficiency). In this process, the gas is washed with water, and dried by sulphuric acid. In the dusting tower, the sulphur dioxide is exposed to a steam which removes the dust particles. After the gas is cooled, the sulphur dioxide enters the washing tower where it is sprayed by water to remove any soluble impurities. In the drying tower, sulphuric acid is sprayed on the gas to remove the moisture from it. Finally, arsenic oxide is removed when the gas is exposed to <b>ferric</b> <b>hydroxide.</b>|$|E

Anodic films are most commonly applied to protect aluminium alloys, although processes also exist for titanium, zinc, magnesium, niobium, zirconium, hafnium, and tantalum. Iron or carbon steel metal exfoliates when oxidized under neutral or alkaline microelectrolytic conditions; i.e., the iron oxide (actually <b>ferric</b> <b>hydroxide</b> or hydrated iron oxide, also known as rust) forms by anoxic anodic pits and large cathodic surface, these pits concentrate anions such as sulfate and chloride accelerating the underlying metal to corrosion. Carbon flakes or nodules in iron or steel with high carbon content (high-carbon steel, cast iron) may cause an electrolytic potential and interfere with coating or plating. Ferrous metals are commonly anodized electrolytically in nitric acid or by treatment with red fuming nitric acid to form hard black ferric oxide. This oxide remains conformal even when plated on wire and the wire is bent.|$|E

Although ultraviolet B (UVB: 280 - 315 nm) is the most effective wavelength region for Fe(II) photoproduction, the impact of UVB was small due to the relatively low flux of UVB into the ocean surface waters. However, the impact of UVB did indeed increase significantly from 3. 54 to 6. 15 % during the austral ozone minimum...|$|R
