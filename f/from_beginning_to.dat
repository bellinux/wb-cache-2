5|$|Amin's {{short-lived}} {{presidency was}} marked by controversies <b>from</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> end. He came to power by ordering {{the death of his}} predecessor Nur Muhammad Taraki. The revolt against communist rule which had begun under Taraki worsened under Amin, and was a problem that his government was unable to solve. The Soviet Union, which alleged that Amin was an agent of the CIA, intervened in Afghanistan while invoking the Twenty-Year Treaty of Friendship between Afghanistan and the Soviet Union. Amin was assassinated by the Soviets in December 1979 as part of Operation Storm-333, having ruled for slightly longer than three months.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} project {{received}} the {{cease and desist}} letter, an alpha version of the patch was leaked on the internet.

In January 2011, a more complete beta version was leaked which could be played <b>from</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> end, {{believed to be the}} final build of the project prior to cancellation.|$|E

5|$|Unlike most artisan cheese makers, Beecher's mainly uses {{pasteurized milk}} and {{operates}} a high-volume modern production facility, with multiple farms supplying milk.

Beecher's uses various cheese cultures when mixing cheeses, so a cheddar cheese produced by Beecher's may use cultures not normally intended for cheddar cheese production.|$|E
5|$|The Browns {{beat the}} Bills {{in the second}} game of the regular season. Cleveland {{dominated}} the game <b>from</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> end, scoring 42 points and amassing 504 total yards on offense. The scoring began with touchdowns in the first quarter by halfback Bob Cowan and Marion Motley. End Mac Speedie caught another touchdown in the second quarter, giving the Browns three scores in a span of just 18 minutes. Buffalo scored two touchdowns of its own in the second period, however, and the score stood at 21–13 at halftime. The Browns pulled away in the second half, scoring three more unanswered touchdowns. Otto Graham ran for a score in the third period, but was taken out of the game when the Browns' lead widened. Motley ran for 136 yards on 17 carries, and Speedie matched an AAFC single-game record by recording 10 receptions for 151 yards. Despite the loss, Bills backs Vic Kulbitski and Julie Rykovich ran for 187 yards combined. The final score was 42–13.|$|E

5|$|The {{production}} of each colossal head {{must have been}} carefully planned, given the effort required to ensure the necessary resources were available; {{it seems likely that}} only the more powerful Olmec rulers were able to mobilise such resources. The workforce would have included sculptors, labourers, overseers, boatmen, woodworkers and other artesans producing the tools to make and move the monument, in addition to the support needed to feed and otherwise attend to these workers.

5|$|While Drive {{is set in}} {{the present}} day, it carries a heavy 1980s {{atmosphere}} that is cautiously set <b>from</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> end and is underlined not only by the vehicles or music and clothes, but also by its architecture. The parts of the city seen in the Valley and by downtown Los Angeles are cheap stucco and mirrored glass, often leaving out more contemporary buildings. Drab background settings include the southern California commercial strip. As the Los Angeles Times pointed out, whenever gleaming buildings are shown, it is because they are being seen from a distance. Refn shot those scenes from a helicopter at night in Bunker Hill, Los Angeles.|$|E

The Sun is growing brighter; early in its main-sequence life its brightness was 70% that of what it is today.|$|E
