50|$|Geological sites {{fall into}} two types, having {{different}} conservation priorities: exposure <b>sites,</b> and <b>deposit</b> <b>sites.</b> Exposure sites are where quarries, disused railway cuttings, cliffs or outcrops give access to extensive geological features, such as particular rock layers. If the exposure becomes obscured, the feature could in principle be re-exposed elsewhere. Conservation of these sites usually concentrates on maintenance of access for future study. <b>Deposit</b> <b>sites</b> are features which are limited in extent or physically delicate—for example, they include small lenses of sediment, mine tailings, caves and other landforms. If such features become damaged they cannot be recreated, and conservation usually involves protecting the feature from erosion or other damage.|$|R
40|$|Mercury {{contents}} of selected species of mushrooms, their substrates (humus ground), leaves of woody plants, air, soil-air and exhaust gas of factory were analysed {{to learn the}} mechanism of mercury accumulation by the mushrooms. The samples were obtained from 4 stations {{in the vicinity of}} the K-Denko Factory which have still remained ten <b>deposit</b> <b>sites</b> of industrial sludge. Mercury detected in air and exhaust gas of the factory was not so higher now. But mercury levels in the soil-air of sludge <b>deposit</b> <b>sites</b> were 10 times higher than these of other stations. Neither thin gold wire nor the growing Shiitake, Lentinus edodes, left at 4 stations for about a week has trapped and accumulated the mercury from the surrounding air. In addition, mercury {{contents of}} leaves of woody plants were also negligible. Wild mushrooms and their substrates obtained from the vicinity of the factory, especially the sludge <b>deposit</b> <b>sites</b> contained higher level of mercury. There is corelation in mercury content between the mushrooms and their substrates examined in 4 species of them, Lycoperdon gemmatum, Mycena pura, Psathyrella velutina and Stropharia servginsa. However, no relationship is seen in Coprius spp. It is presumed that the mushrooms growing near the factory accumulated the mercury through the mycellium from the humus ground that has been contaminated when the acetoaldehyde plant was operated...|$|R
40|$|Non-sulfide zinc {{deposits}} (zinc “oxide ” deposits) {{are becoming}} favored exploration targets due to {{new developments in}} metallurgy allowing for solvent-extraction and electrowinning. While geologic understanding of the genesis {{of these types of}} deposits is improving, there has been little work aimed at documenting their geophysical responses. We therefore investigate the geophysical signature of two major hypogene non-sulfide deposits, Vazante in Brazil and Beltana in Australia. Physical property values were measured for each <b>deposit</b> <b>site</b> and combined with geologic information to generate two- and three-dimensional models for geophysical modeling. Results indicate that gravity method will be valuable at both <b>deposit</b> <b>sites</b> for direct detection of either ore and/or the alteration halo associated with mineralization. Simulated magnetic data indicate that the responses will not be large enough at either site to warrant magnetic method in exploration for willemite. Electrical method simulations vary for the two <b>deposit</b> <b>sites.</b> At Vazante, neither DC resistivity or induced polarization (IP) will generate a detectable response based on physical property values; while at Beltana, simulated data and inversion results indicate that both techniques will be valuable as an exploration tool. It is clear based on these simulations that geophysics can be effectively used to explore for non-sulfide zinc deposits either through direct detection of ore bodies or through imaging of associated hydrothermal alteration...|$|R

(Diptera: Culicidae) is the {{mosquito}} which presents most interest because of its wide geographical distribution and of its abundance which engender a strong nuisance. Besides, its role of vector of the virus West Nile arouses a particular interest in the Mediterranean Basin. These insects are generally controlled by conventional insecticides for the greater part, chemicals which cause {{in the long term}} side effects (effects on the not aimed bodies and the resistance of the aimed species). A research for the effect of the bioinsec ticide Bacillus thuringiensis (granulated commercial shape in 200 IUT 1 /mg) was realized on préimaginales populations of the artificial <b>deposits</b> <b>sites</b> (taken directly of them natural the <b>deposits</b> <b>sites)</b> and cleansed populations (stemming from a breeding) having never been handled previously, taking into account local weather and physico-chemical conditions. Analyses of variance, allowed to determine the combined effect of the factor measure and of the factor time which by increasing, increase the efficiency of the product. The results of the rates of mortalities registered after treatment allowed to loosen the DL 50 and the DL 90 for every embryonic stage.

In the latter case we generalize the Voronoi diagrams for disjoint weighted convex polygons in the plane.
