Calves in nurseries engage in playfights. Weaning starts between six and eight months after birth, and most calves are fully weaned after a year. Like many other large mammals, hippos are described as K-strategists, in this case typically producing just one large, well-developed infant <b>every</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> years (rather than many small, poorly developed young several times per year as is common among small mammals such as rodents).|$|E

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of entanglement in some hybrid qubit-qutrit systems {{under the influence}} of global, collective, local and multilocal depolarizing noise is studied. It is shown that the depolarizing noise can be used to induce entanglement. A critical point exists under <b>every</b> <b>coupling</b> <b>of</b> the system with the environment at which all the states are equally entangled. Furthermore, it is seen that no ESD occurs when either only the qubit is coupled to its local environment or the system is coupled to multilocal or global environment. This is an important result for various quantum information processing tasks and hence needs further investigation. Comment: Pages 11, Figures...|$|R

40|$|It is a {{fundamental}} paradigm that the physical effects induced by electric fields are qualitatively different from those induced by magnetic fields.

This counter-intuitive duality of matter-field interactions enables novel ways to create and manipulate spin and pseudo-spin polarizations in bilayer graphene via external fields and leads {{to the emergence of}} a valley-contrasting axion electrodynamics, where the traditional association of charges at rest with electric fields and charge currents with magnetic fields is reversed.

25|$|Within the Mountain State, these tribal villages can be {{characterized}} as rather small and scattered as they moved about the old fields <b>every</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> generations.

30|$|Family {{life cycle}} theory and natural {{evolution}} theory share a default hypothesis, i.e., the research population (couples) are highly homogenous.

On the other hand, <b>every</b> <b>couple’s</b> endurance <b>of</b> marital conflicts {{and the ability to}} deal with them also differ. As a consequence, the marriage satisfaction and divorce risk for <b>every</b> specific <b>couple</b> vary widely at any given point of time.

25|$|Mars' {{atmosphere}} is so thin and wispy that solar heating {{of dust and}} ice in the atmosphere - not heating of the atmospheric gases - is more important in driving weather. Small, suspended particles of dust and water ice - aerosols - intercept 20–30% of incoming sunlight, even under relatively clear conditions. So variations in the amounts of these aerosols have a huge influence on climate. CRISM has taken three major kinds of measurements of dust and ice in the atmosphere: targeted observations whose repeated views of the surface provide a sensitive estimate of aerosol abundance; special global grids of targeted observations <b>every</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> months designed especially to track spatial and seasonal variations; and scans across the planet's limb to show how dust and ice vary with height above the surface.|$|E
25|$|Egyptian pottery in the {{southern}} Sinai during the Late Bronze and Early Iron I (Ramesside) periods has been discovered at the mining camps of Serabit el-Khadim and Timna. Objects which bore Proto-Sinaitic inscriptions, {{the same as those}} found in Canaan, were discovered at Serabit el Khadim in the Southern Sinai. Several of these were dated in the later Bronze Age. These encampments provide evidence of miners from southern Canaan. The remote site of Serabit el-Khadem was used for a few months at a time, <b>every</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> years at best, more often once in a generation.

25|$|A {{station is}} set by specifying an artist or song, or a {{combination}} of multiple items of any kind in a single station. Listeners can tune into established genre stations, other users' stations or create their own stations based on their musical interests. Each track played can be responded to with favorable (thumbs up) or unfavorable (thumbs down) buttons, which determine if it should be played, and if similarly classified songs should be played in the station. A second negative response to the same artist will ban that artist from the selected station unless the user has marked the artist positively on another occasion or if that artist is listed under the station's variety. No response is applicable to musical attributes or to albums. An unfavorable response immediately stops play of the track. Clicking the thumbs down or skipping to the next song too many times in a row will result in a short ban of skips. Pandora also utilizes short advertisements between <b>every</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> songs.|$|E

25|$|The Northern and Western {{parts of}} the city, which are closer to the Fijeh springs, receive better service than the Southern and Eastern parts {{that are at the}} end of the {{distribution}} network.

During winter residents in the Northwestern parts of Damascus typically receive a continuous flow of water, while residents in the Southeastern {{parts of the}} city receive water for only a few hours per day or even <b>every</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> days during summer. For example, the town of Sahenya, 16km south-west of Damascus, was for 10 days without water in 2006. Most houses in Damascus have rooftop tanks to store water during periods of supply. Many houses have dual plumbing systems, with one tap for water that comes directly from the network and another tap for water that comes from the rooftop tank. As a consequence, many residents do not perceive a water crisis during most of the year, because they have sufficient water either from the network or from their rooftop tanks.|$|E

30|$|At first glance, Vaupel and Yashin have {{provided}} a seemingly convincing explanation for the inverted U-shape divorce pattern. Yet, their explanation to some extent is an ex post facto explanation. In terms of the ending of each marriage, {{it is true that}} some couples divorce and some couples do not, or with the words of Vaupel and Yashin, some couple’s divorce risk is 0 whereas others are greater than 0. However, in terms of the process of marriage, the risk of divorce should always be greater than 0 as long as a couple remains married. Therefore, we cannot tell <b>couples</b> <b>of</b> subpopulation 1 from <b>couples</b> <b>of</b> subpopulation 2 unless we observe the end <b>of</b> <b>every</b> <b>couple.</b> In spite <b>of</b> this, explaining the divorce pattern from the perspective of population heterogeneity is still very novel and attractive. And from this perspective, we can further extrapolate that the shape of the overall divorce risk function is mainly influenced by two factors: first is the proportion (p) <b>of</b> the <b>couples</b> who will eventually divorce—the greater the proportion, the higher the position of the risk function, and the later the divorce pattern arrives at its peak value (i.e., the “itch’”); second is the rate of divorce—the faster the rate, the higher the position of the risk function, and the earlier the risk function reaches its peak value (Vaupel & Yashin, 1985).|$|R
