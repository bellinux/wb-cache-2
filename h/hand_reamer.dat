50|$|A <b>hand</b> <b>reamer</b> has {{a longer}} taper or lead {{in at the}} front than a machine reamer. This is to {{compensate}} for the difficulty of starting a hole by hand power alone. It also allows the reamer to start straight and reduce the risk of breakage. The flutes may be straight or spiral.|$|E
50|$|The spiral may be {{clockwise}} or counter-clockwise {{depending on}} usage. For example, a tapered <b>hand</b> <b>reamer</b> with a clockwise spiral {{will tend to}} self feed as it is used, possibly leading to a wedging action and consequent breakage. A counter-clockwise spiral is therefore preferred even though the reamer is still turned in the clockwise direction.|$|E
50|$|To use a <b>hand</b> <b>reamer,</b> {{the user}} first slices a chosen fruit in half {{with a knife}} along its {{equatorial}} midsection. Grasping the fruit {{in one hand and}} the reamer in the other, the user first pierces the exposed flesh of the fruit with the tip of the reamer blade, then grinds out the inside with a twisting wrist motion until nearly all of the juice is extracted. This dislodges the seeds and some amount of pith, so the juice must generally be strained before use. It works well with limes and lemons, but larger citrus fruits (grapefruit in particular) require a larger device.|$|E
50|$|A {{tap wrench}} is a hand tool used to turn taps or other small tools, such as <b>hand</b> <b>reamers</b> and screw extractors.|$|R
50|$|An {{adjustable}} <b>hand</b> <b>reamer</b> {{can cover}} a small range of sizes. They are generally referenced by a letter which equates to a size range. The disposable blades slide along a tapered groove. The act of tightening and loosening the restraining nuts {{at each end}} varies the size that may be cut. The absence of any spiral in the flutes restricts them to light usage (minimal material removal per setting) as they {{have a tendency to}} chatter. They are also restricted to usage in unbroken holes. If a hole has an axial split along it, such as a split bush or a clamping hole, each straight tooth will in turn drop into the gap causing the other teeth to retract from their cutting position. This also gives rise to chatter marks and defeats the purpose of using the reamer to size a hole.|$|E
40|$|Between 2000 and 2003 we treated 23 {{patients}} who sustained open tibial shaft fractures with tightly fitted interlocking intramedullary nailing. There were three grade I, eight grade II, nine grade IIIa, and three grade IIIb open fractures. Nail diameters were decided on using preoperative and intraoperative radiographs. Nails were introduced after gentle passage with a 7 - to 8 -mm <b>hand</b> <b>reamer.</b> Union was obtained in all cases. Nine (37. 5 %) fractures, however, required additional procedures before union. Three of them gained union through exchange nailing, bone graft, and bone transport, respectively. The remaining six underwent dynamisation. Two of them required an additional exchange nailing for non-union; thereafter one healed {{and the other}} gained union through an additional bone graft. Deep infection occurred in one case. Screw breakage occurred in one case only. Tightly fitted nailing produced a significantly lower incidence of locking screw breakage. However, even with this advantage, this technical modification has failed to show clinical advantage in terms of higher healing rate or lower rate of secondary procedures...|$|E
30|$|Under general anesthesia, {{the patient}} was placed in beach-chair {{position}} on a radiolucent operating table. A longitudinal skin incision was made along the greater tuberosity of the humerus. The deltoid muscle was bluntly split to expose the rotator cuff. In cases of 2 -part (surgical neck) fracture, a Kirschner pin was inserted through the rotator cuff, and its position was confirmed by C-arm. A 10 Â mm longitudinal incision was made on the supraspinatus tendon right medial to the greater tuberosity and the entry portal of the nail was created with a drill and enlarged with a <b>hand</b> <b>reamer.</b> While maintaining fracture reduction by manual manipulation, a 2.0 -mm guide wire was passed across the fracture and then the nail was inserted correctly. Finally, the nail was locked proximally and distally. In cases of 3 - or 4 -part fracture, the rotated or displaced articular fragment was reduced first and lined up with the shaft fragment. The entry portal of the nail was created on the articular fragment carefully, not to crack the articular fragment. Next, the displaced greater or lesser tuberosity fragment was identified and reduced. One suture inserted on the supraspinatus tendon pulled out the greater tuberosity fragment. The lesser tuberosity fragment was also manipulated by a suture inserted on the infraspinatus tendon. A guide wire was passed across the head-shaft fracture and then the nail was inserted. The fragment of greater or lesser tuberosity was reduced and then fixed with the locking screws or nonabsorbable sutures. Finally, the supraspinatus tendon and deltoid muscle were meticulously closed.|$|E
