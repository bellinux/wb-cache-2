50|$|Towards {{the end of}} 2011 Haven {{appointed}} Don <b>Gailer</b> {{from the}} North Devils in Australia as new head coach, with the remit being promotion to the Championship. Haven finished 4th, thus securing the final promotion berth after Doncaster, Barrow and local rivals Workington Town. <b>Gailer</b> was sacked {{just two weeks after}} securing promotion following a rift between the coach and Haven players.|$|E

50|$|As {{a result}} of the move, <b>Gailer's</b> student and staff {{turnover}} was over 50% per year in the period between 1998 and 2000. At the end of the 1999-2000 academic year, the school lost over half of its students and approximately half of its staff.|$|R

50|$|During {{its first}} year, the <b>Gailer</b> School {{operated}} out of Chaucer's living room. From 1990 to 1998, it rented an unused school building in Middlebury, Vermont, from the Catholic diocese. It drew its student body primarily from Addison, Chittenden, and Rutland counties and hosted {{a number of}} international students, primarily from Indonesia. During the 1997-1998 school year, the school had its highest enrollment, with over 80 students. In 1998, <b>Gailer</b> was quietly evicted from this location because the diocese wanted to restart its Catholic grammar school and needed its building back.|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "da Vinci" [...] {{curriculum}} stressed interdisciplinary learning, encouraging {{students to}} see the interconnectedness of science, history, mathematics, language and the written word. Classes included seminar-based discussions, lectures, student presentations, field work and group projects. Each student also took a weekly [...] "master class", allowing the in-depth study of a chosen subject. Students also were required to perform community service to encourage and understand their connectedness to their community. <b>Gailer</b> {{was one of the}} first schools in Vermont to introduce community service into its curriculum.|$|E
50|$|During {{the summer}} of 1998, <b>Gailer</b> moved from Middlebury to Shelburne, Vermont, where it would rent a space from 1998 through 2006. At this time the Board of Trustees was {{controlled}} by parents from the greater Burlington area {{who did not want}} their own children to be inconvenienced by a long commute. Chaucer also believed at the time that replacing the less affluent Rutland County segment of the school population with more affluent students from greater Burlington would guarantee a steady source of revenue for the school. Analysis of a student and staff phone list from this time shows that approximately 1/3 of staff and students each came from Addison, Chittenden, and Rutland counties. However, a report penned by Chaucer and the Board from this time claimed that over 75% of their students were traveling from the Burlington area in 1997-98.|$|E
50|$|Van Osdel built {{some of the}} city's first grain {{elevators}} {{upon his}} return. In 1843, he co-founded an iron foundry and machine factory with Elihu Granger. With his health continuing to fail, he left the partnership two years later to focus on his architecture. Van Osdel opened an office on Clark Street, the first architectural office in Chicago. During his time there he designed the Cook County Courthouse, the Chicago City Hall, and the Tremont House. He also designed a house for Governor Joel Aldrich Matteson which later saw use as the Illinois Executive Mansion. By 1859, Van Osdel was making over $32,000 in profit per year.Van Osdel married Caroline <b>Gailer</b> in 1832. After her death, he married Martha McClellan. Van Osdel had no biological children, although he did adopt a few. He was named a trustee of the Illinois Industrial University, {{now known as the}} University of Illinois. As a member of its Committee on Buildings and Grounds, he was instrumental in the founding of a branch university in Chicago, today known as the University of Illinois at Chicago. Upon completion of the branch, he was named its Treasurer. Politically, Van Osdel was active in the abolition movement. Previously unaffiliated, Van Osdel became a Republican in 1860, printing pamphlets supporting the party.|$|E
40|$|Copyright © 2004 American Chemical SocietyClinical {{chelation}} therapy {{of mercury}} poisoning generally uses {{one or both}} of two drugs [...] meso-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and dimercaptopropanesulfonic acid (DMPS), commercially sold as Chemet and Dimaval, respectively. We have used a combination of mercury L(III) -edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations to investigate the chemistry of interaction of mercuric ions with each of these chelation therapy drugs. We show that neither DMSA nor DMPS forms a true chelate complex with mercuric ions and that these drugs should be considered suboptimal for their clinical task of binding mercuric ions. We discuss the design criteria for a mercuric specific chelator molecule or "custom chelator", which might form the basis for an improved clinical treatment. Graham N. George, Roger C.

40|$|Copyright © 2003 American Chemical SocietyWilson's {{disease is}} an {{autosomal}} recessive human illness in which {{large quantities of}} copper accumulate in various organs, including the brain and the liver. If left untreated, it results in hepatitis, neurological complications, and death. Long-Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rats have a homologous mutation to Wilson's disease and thus provide an animal model. Liver lysosomes from tetrathiomolybdate-treated LEC rats were isolated and analyzed by Cu and Mo K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The lysosomes contained a Cu-Mo-S cluster in which the Mo is coordinated by four sulfurs at 2. 24 A with approximately three copper neighbors at 2. 70 A. Each Cu is coordinated to 3 - 4 sulfurs at 2. 28 A with approximately one Mo neighbor at 2. 70 A. These results indicate {{the formation of a}} biologically novel molybdenum-copper-sulfur cluster.

40|$|Copyright © 2002 American Chemical SocietyA novel arsenic-selenium {{solution}} {{species was}} synthesized by reacting equimolar sodium selenite and sodium dimethylarsinate with 10 mol equiv of glutathione (pH 7. 5) in aqueous solution. The solution species showed a single (77) Se NMR resonance at 112. 8 ppm. Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) using an {{inductively coupled plasma}} atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES) as the simultaneous arsenic-, selenium-, sulfur-, and carbon-specific detector revealed an arsenic-selenium moiety with an As:Se molar ratio of 1 : 2. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) of the chromatographically purified compound showed a molecular mass peak at m/z 263 in the negative ion mode. Fragmentation of the parent ion (ESI-MS-MS) produced (CH(3)) (2) As(-) and Se(2) (-) fragments. Arsenic and selenium extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS) of the purified species revealed two As-C interactions at 1. 943 A and two As-Se interactions at 2. 279 A. On {{the basis of these}} results this novel solution species is identified as the dimethyldiselenoarsinate anion. Jürgen <b>Gailer,</b> Graham N. George, Hugh H. Harris, Ingrid J.
