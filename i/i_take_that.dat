Now <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> punk in me to Washington, and I fight for something important." [...] Owing to her extensive activism, her Q Score—the industry's measure of celebrities' likability—nearly doubled to 25 between 2000 and 2006. Her recognizability grew accordingly; by 2006, she was familiar to 81% of Americans, compared to 31% in 2000. She became noted for her ability to positively influence her public image through the media, without employing a publicist or an agent. Her Q Score remained above average even when, in 2005, she was accused of ending Brad Pitt's marriage to Jennifer Aniston, at which point her public persona became an unlikely combination of alleged homewrecker, mother, sex symbol, and humanitarian. A decade later, Jolie {{was found to be}} the most admired woman in the world in global surveys conducted by YouGov in 2015 and 2016.|$|E

6000|$|... "Assuredly, Niccolo; else I {{should not}} have ventured to {{interrupt}} you when you are working out of hours, since <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> {{as a sign that}} your work is pressing." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{clasped her}} hands with delighted sympathy. [...] "She {{has given me}} leave to mention the matter," [...] he continued, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> {{as a sign that}} her {{resistance}} will give way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{we are to}} take boat so soon, Mr. Griffith, {{it would}} be seemly that due {{preparations}} {{should be made to}} receive the ladies, who are to honor us with their presence; shall <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> duty on myself?" ...|$|E
60|$|Mr Bloom set {{his thigh}} down. Glad <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>that</b> bath. Feel my feet quite clean. But I wish Mrs Fleming had darned these socks better.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not a particle. He was {{the first}} to answer my call, and <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>that</b> as a sign we should get away without leaving a trail." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Colonel," [...] said he, [...] "I reckon I wouldn't be {{much use}} to Abe if <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>that.</b> But if you'll send Ephum after, cup of coffee--" ...|$|R
6000|$|My pipe is smoked out, and the grog runs [...] slack; But bowse away, wife, at your blessed Bohea; This empty can here must needs solace me-- Nay, sweetheart, nay; <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> back; Dick drinks {{from your}} eyes and he finds no [...] lack! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Only this, {{that if you}} fire Miss Mariner, <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> neat script which I've {{prepared}} and I tear it into a thousand fragments. Or nine hundred. Anyway, I tear it. Miss Mariner opens in New York, or I pack up my work and leave." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In gold?" [...] says Mr. Bagnet. [...] "I'll {{tell you}} what. The old girl's weight--is twelve stone six. Would <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> weight--in any metal--for the old girl?

6000|$|... "The French do {{not open}} their lower ports, Greenly," [...] {{observed}} the vice-admiral, dropping the glass {{after one of}} his long looks at the enemy, [...] "although they {{have the advantage of}} being to leeward. <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> to be a sign they intend nothing very serious." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> back, Madge. If you'd been a numbskull you'd {{have won}} him, or any one else, on your looks, and form, and carriage. I ought to know. I've been through that {{particular}} mill, and, the devil take me, I'm not through it yet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Prince," [...] {{she said}} again, [...] "once more {{and for the}} last time I say: Bethink you well, for it comes upon me that your words are true, and that if <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> which to-night you offer, it will be for ever and for aye." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{know it is}} {{commonly}} said, boni judicis est ampliare juridictionem. But <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> to be better advice which was given by the Lord Chancellor Bacon upon swearing a judge; That he would take care to contain {{the jurisdiction of the}} court within the ancient mere-stones without removing the mark.|$|E
6000|$|... "I thank you," [...] I said; [...] "I {{feel you}} have said as much as possible, and more than I had any right to ask. <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> as a mark of confidence, which I will try to deserve. I hope, sir, you will let me regard you as a friend." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Miss, <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> back," [...] added Jean, shortly. [...] "I'm sorry. I didn't {{mean to be}} rude. It was a mean {{trick for}} me to kiss you.

6000|$|... "Ten {{thousand}} francs!" [...] {{she murmured}} to herself. [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>that</b> with me they would receive me at home. I might {{start all over}} again. It is worth a little risk. Heavens, how nervous I am!" ...|$|R
60|$|My case {{grew more}} and more serious every day. A Plain gin was recommended; <b>I</b> <b>took</b> it. Then gin and molasses; <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>that</b> also.

60|$|The {{principal}} {{masters of}} this faithful religious school in painting, known to me, are Giotto, Angelico, Sandro Botticelli, Filippo Lippi, Luini, and Carpaccio; {{but for a}} central illustration of their mind, <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> piece of work by the sculptor of Quercia,[48] of which some shadow of representation, true to an available degree, is within reach of my reader.|$|E
60|$|Rod.

60|$|I confess <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> to be {{the meaning}} of the word counsel, but I am certain that is not all that is meant by it, that is what must be {{understood}} when it is called the king's counsel, id est, the counsel or reasons for which the king by his servants, his attorney-general or coroner, has drawn and sent to the grand jury a charge against a subject.|$|E
60|$|So I {{thought at}} the time, not knowing the {{resources}} of science. Afterwards, however, <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>that</b> huge bundle to a friend, a learned friend whose business in life it was and is, to deal with and to decipher old manuscripts.|$|R
