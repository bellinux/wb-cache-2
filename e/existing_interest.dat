Because of the <b>existing</b> <b>interest,</b> a project was started in 1995 with 50 Ford Taurus E85 flexifuel {{in different parts of}} Sweden: Umeå, Örnsköldsvik, Härnösand, Stockholm, Karlstad, Linköping, and Växjö. From 1997 to 1998 an additional 300 Taurus were imported, and the number of E85 fueling grew to 40. Then in 1998 the city of Stockholm placed an order for 2,000 of FFVs for any car manufacturer willing to produce them. The objective was to jump-start the FFV industry in Sweden. The two domestic car makers Volvo Group and Saab AB refused to participate arguing there were not in place any ethanol filling stations. However, Ford Motor Company took the offer and began importing the flexifuel version of its Focus model, delivering the first cars in 2001, and selling more than 15,000 FFV Focus by 2005, then representing an 80% market share of the flexifuel market.|$|E

Notre Dame ultimately played Stanford that year because they were the Pacific Coast Conference champs. But due to the large alumni support for an annual season ending game in Los Angeles and the still <b>existing</b> <b>interest</b> for a home-and-home series, Notre Dame and USC started playing the series the following year in 1926. The series creation was also likely aided by USC coach Howard Jones, whom Rockne recommended USC hire due to their long friendship.|$|E

Social protection has yet to displace <b>existing</b> <b>interests,</b> ideas, and rent-allocation practices. However, cash transfers are gaining localized support.

40|$|Systems of {{land law}} must balance {{competing}} goals of securing title for <b>existing</b> <b>interests</b> in land with facilitating their transfer. Title registration systems operate to facilitate transfers of interests in land. They reflect {{a choice to}} enhance the security of transfers of interests, providing what has been characterized as dynamic security {{at the expense of}} the static security of <b>existing</b> <b>interests.</b> One of the cardinal principles of title registration is the abolition of the doctrine of notice. In equity, if purchasers of a legal interest have notice of a prior equitable interest, then they take their interest subject to that prior interest. To do otherwise is to perpetrate a fraud. Most title registration systems abolish notice; prior unregistered interests do not affect purchasers who register their interests, whether or not they have notice of the prior interest, except, so many title registration statutes provide, in the case of fraud. This article investigates the evolution of provisions purporting to abolish notice in Torrens title jurisdictions, it describes the variety of provisions that emerged, it reviews the longstanding uncertainty in British Columbia over the extent to which the doctrine of notice is abolished, and it considers a number of proposals for reform. It concludes that the uncertainty is a function of an unresolved policy choice between static and dynamic security, and that the British Columbia Court of Appeal or the legislature needs to intervene to clarify that choice...|$|R

This revision made possible a version that combined the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the procedures.

To develop this version and ensure it covered everything from both Luria and Christensen, Golden first created an exam that took approximately 18 hours to administer and contained nearly 2,000 procedures. From this base items were selectively removed if they were found to lack reliability or validity, be repetitive, be too long, or fail to accurately discriminate a brain injury. <b>Existing</b> <b>interest</b> in Luria’s work made this battery instantly popular, and as it was circulated, demand and research only grew.
