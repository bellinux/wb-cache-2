Reid Sutton in 2016 in the journal Genome Medicine. The index subject was diagnosed with left ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy (LVNC) and Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome at 5 1/2 months of age. In an attempt to identify the etiology of this cardiac phenotype, {{a series of tests}} were performed, including clinical whole exome sequencing. Because the clinical diagnostic laboratory did not identify pathogenic variants in known <b>disease-associated</b> <b>genes,</b> re-analysis of the exome data was performed by Dr. Mohammad Eldomery as part of the Baylor-Johns Hopkins Center for Mendelian Genomics. Biallelic variants were identified in the MIPEP gene, which was known in yeast and other organisms to be important in mitochondrial protein processing. Because LVNC is seen in other mitochondrial disorders, this was considered the best candidate gene. After interrogating the Baylor Genetic Laboratory clinical database and submitting the MIPEP gene to GeneMatcher, four other affected individuals from three families were identified with biallelic variants in MIPEP. In all cases, the phenotype is LVNC with severe hypotonia and developmental delay. All of the affected individuals, {{with the exception of the}} index case, died before 2 years of age from cardiac failure. Seizures and cataracts were also noted in some of the affected individuals. The MIPEP variants included missense variants, stop variants as well as a 1.4 Megabase deletion involving the MIPEP gene. Confirmation of the pathogenicity of these variants in MIPEP was performed in a yeast model system by Nora Vögtle and Chris Meisinger at the University of Freiburg, Germany.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: About 5 % {{of western}} populations are afflicted by {{autoimmune}} diseases {{many of which}} are affected by sex hormones. Autoimmune diseases are complex and involve many genes. Identifying these <b>disease-associated</b> <b>genes</b> contributes to development of more effective therapies. Also, association studies frequently imply genomic regions that contain <b>disease-associated</b> <b>genes</b> but fall short of pinpointing these genes. The identification of <b>disease-associated</b> <b>genes</b> has always been challenging and to date there is no universal and effective method developed. RESULTS: We have developed a method to prioritize <b>disease-associated</b> <b>genes</b> for diseases affected strongly by sex hormones. Our method uses various types of information available for the genes, but no information that directly links genes with the disease. It generates a score for each of the considered genes and ranks genes based on that score. We illustrate our method on early-onset myasthenia gravis (MG) using genes potentially controlled by estrogen and localized in a genomic segment (which contains the MHC and surrounding region) strongly associated with MG. Based on the considered genomic segment 283 genes are ranked for their relevance to MG and responsiveness to estrogen. The top three ranked genes, HLA-G, TAP 2 and HLA-DRB 1, are implicated in autoimmune diseases, while TAP 2 is associated with SNPs characteristic for MG. Within the top 35 prioritized genes our method identifies 90 % of the 10 already known MG-associated genes from the considered region without using any information that directly links genes to MG. Among the top eight genes we identified HLA-G and TUBB as new candidates. We show that our ab-initio approach outperforms the other methods for prioritizing <b>disease-associated</b> <b>genes.</b> CONCLUSION: We have developed a method to prioritize <b>disease-associated</b> <b>genes</b> under the potential control of sex hormones. We demonstrate the success of this method by prioritizing the genes localized in the MHC and surrounding region and evaluating the role of these genes as potential candidates for estrogen control as well as MG. We show that our method outperforms the other methods. The method has a potential to be adapted to prioritize genes relevant to other diseases...|$|E
40|$|Many common {{diseases}} are complex, {{meaning that they}} are caused by many interacting genes. This makes them difficult to study; to determine disease mechanisms, <b>disease-associated</b> <b>genes</b> must be analyzed in combination. <b>Disease-associated</b> <b>genes</b> can be detected using high-throughput methods, such as mRNA expression microarrays, DNA methylation microarrays and genome-wide association studies (GWAS), but determining how they interact to cause disease is an intricate challenge. One approach is to organize <b>disease-associated</b> <b>genes</b> into networks using protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and dissect them to identify disease causing pathways. Studies of complex disease can also be greatly facilitated by using an appropriate model system. In this dissertation, seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) served as a model disease. SAR is a common disease that {{is relatively easy to}} study. Also, the key disease cell types, like the CD 4 + T cell, are known and can be cultured and activated in vitro by the disease causing pollen. The aim of this dissertation was to determine network properties of <b>disease-associated</b> <b>genes,</b> and develop methods to identify and validate networks of <b>disease-associated</b> <b>genes.</b> First, we showed that <b>disease-associated</b> <b>genes</b> have distinguishing network properties, one being that they co-localize in the human PPI network. This supported the existence of disease modules within the PPI network. We then identified network modules of genes whose mRNA expression was perturbed in human disease, and showed that the most central genes in those network modules were enriched for disease-associated polymorphisms identified by GWAS. As a case study, we identified disease modules using mRNA expression data from allergen-challenged CD 4 + cells from patients with SAR. The case study identified and validated a novel disease-associated gene, FGF 2 using GWAS data and RNAi mediated knockdown. Lastly, we examined how DNA methylation caused disease-associated mRNA expression changes in SAR. DNA methylation, but not mRNA expression profiles, could accurately distinguish allergic patients from healthy controls. Also, we found that disease-associated mRNA expression changes were associated with a low DNA methylation content and absence of CpG islands. Specifically within this group, we found a correlation between disease-associated mRNA expression changes and DNA methylation changes. Using ChIP-chip analysis, we found that targets of a known disease relevant transcription factor, IRF 4, were also enriched among non CpG island genes with low methylation levels. Taken together, in this dissertation the network properties of <b>disease-associated</b> <b>genes</b> were examined, and then used to validate disease networks defined by mRNA expression data. We then examined regulatory mechanisms underlying disease-associated mRNA expression changes in a model disease. These studies support network-based analyses as a method to understand disease mechanisms and identify important disease causing genes, such as treatment targets or markers for personalized medication...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Several {{statistical}} {{tests have}} been developed for analyzing genome-wide association data by incorporating gene pathway information in terms of gene sets. Using these methods, hundreds of gene sets are typically tested, and the tested gene sets often overlap. This overlapping greatly increases the probability of generating false positives, and the results obtained are difficult to interpret, particularly when many gene sets show statistical significance. Results We propose a flexible statistical framework to circumvent these problems. Inspired by spatial scan statistics for detecting clustering of disease occurrence in the field of epidemiology, we developed a scan statistic to extract <b>disease-associated</b> <b>gene</b> clusters from a whole gene pathway. Extracting one or a few significant gene clusters from a global pathway limits the overall false positive probability, which results in increased statistical power, and facilitates the interpretation of test results. In the present study, we applied our method to genome-wide association data for rare copy-number variations, which have been strongly implicated in common diseases. Application of our method to a simulated dataset demonstrated the high accuracy of this method in detecting <b>disease-associated</b> <b>gene</b> clusters in a whole gene pathway. Conclusions The scan statistic approach proposed here shows a high level of accuracy in detecting gene clusters in a whole gene pathway.

There is little known about how microRNAs contribute specifically to the emphysema phenotype. We examined how genome-wide microRNA expression is altered with regional emphysema severity and how these microRNAs regulate <b>disease-associated</b> <b>gene</b> expression networks. Methods: We profiled microRNAs in {{different regions of the}} lung with varying degrees of emphysema from 6 smokers with COPD and 2 controls (8 regions x 8 lungs = 64 samples). Regional emphysema severity was quantified by mean linear intercept. Whole genome microRNA and gene expression data were integrated in the same samples to build co-expression networks. Candidate microRNAs were perturbed in human lung fibroblasts in order to validate these networks. Results: The expression levels of 63 microRNAs (P < 0. 05) were altered with regional emphysema. A subset, including miR- 638, miR- 30 c, and miR- 181 d, had expression levels that were associated with those of their predicted mRNA targets. Genes correlated with these microRNAs were enriched in pathways associated with emphysema pathophysiology (for example, oxidative stress and accelerated aging). Inhibition of miR- 638 expression in lung fibroblasts led to modulation of these same emphysema-related pathways. Gene targets of miR- 638 in these pathways were amongst those negatively correlated with miR- 638 expression in emphysema. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that microRNAs are altered with regional emphysema severity and modulate <b>disease-associated</b> <b>gene</b> expression networks. Furthermore, miR- 638 may regulate gene expression pathways related to the oxidative stress response and aging in emphysematous lung tissue and lung fibroblasts...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{identification}} of novel genes by high-throughput studies of complex diseases {{is complicated by}} the large number of potential genes. However, since <b>disease-associated</b> <b>genes</b> tend to interact, one solution is to arrange them in modules based on co-expression data and known gene interactions. The hypothesis of this study was that such a module could be a) found and validated in allergic disease and b) used to find and validate one ore more novel <b>disease-associated</b> <b>genes.</b> Results To test these hypotheses integrated analysis {{of a large number of}} gene expression microarray experiments from different forms of allergy was performed. This led to the {{identification of}} an experimentally validated reference gene that was used to construct a module of co-expressed and interacting genes. This module was validated in an independent material, by replicating the expression changes in allergen-challenged CD 4 + cells. Moreover, the changes were reversed following treatment with corticosteroids. The module contained several novel <b>disease-associated</b> <b>genes,</b> of which the one with the highest number of interactions with known disease genes, IL 7 R, was selected for further validation. The expression levels of IL 7 R in allergen challenged CD 4 + cells decreased following challenge but increased after treatment. This suggested an inhibitory role, which was confirmed by functional studies. Conclusion We propose that a module-based analytical strategy is generally applicable to find novel genes in complex diseases. </p...|$|E

Therefore, ranking/prioritization methods for such candidate genes are introduced (i.e., genes are ranked by their relevance to a disease of interest).

40|$|Magister Scientiae - MScThis is a {{pilot study}} to {{investigate}} the relationship between disease gene status {{and the structure of}} the human genome with specific reference to regions of recombination. It compares certain characteristics of a control set of genes, with no reported association or function in any known disease, with a second set of well-curated genes with a known association to a disease. One of the benefits of recombination is the introduction of new combinations of genetic variation in the genome. Recombination hotspots are regions on the chromosome where higher than normal frequencies of breaking and rejoining between homologous chromosomes occur during meiosis. The hotspot regions exhibit both a non-random distribution across the human genome and varying frequencies of breaking and rejoining. The study analyzed a set of features that represent general properties of human genes; namely base composition (percentage GC content), genetic variation (single nucleotide polymorphisms - SNPs), gene length, and positional effect (distance from chromosome end), in both the disease-associated gene set and the control set. These features were linked to recombination hotspots in the human genome and the frequency of recombination at these hotspots. Descriptive statistics was used to determine differences between the occurrences of these features in <b>disease-associated</b> <b>genes</b> compared to the control set, as well as differences in the occurrence of these same features in subset of genes containing an internal recombination hotspot compared to the genes with no internal recombination hotspot. The study found that <b>disease-associated</b> <b>genes</b> are generally longer than those in the control set, which is consistent with previous studies. It also found that <b>disease-associated</b> <b>genes</b> {{are much more likely to}} contain a recombination hotspot than those genes with no disease association.

30|$|It was {{reported}} in previous studies that disease similarity improves the performance of prediction of novel <b>disease-associated</b> <b>genes,</b> since it better exploits the “disease module” principle. Based on this, methods on a heterogeneous networks comprising a disease similarity network and a gene/protein network are superior to those which are solely based on the gene/protein network. However, construction of the disease similarity network in previous studies are limited since they mostly based on an out-of-date disease similarity matrix, which was constructed using text mining algorithms on OMIM records. Considering that human phenotype ontology is now available and it well annotates to disease phenotypes, disease similarity can be semantically calculated based on such the controlled vocabulary using semantic-based similarity measures. Therefore, in this study, instead of using the OMIM-based disease similarity network, we construct a HPO-based one using a semantic similarity measure. Using the random walk with restart algorithm on a heterogeneous network, we compared {{the performance of the}} heterogeneous network built based on our method with that based on the OMIM-based disease similarity network. Simulation results show that our method is better irrespective of gene/protein networks. This indicates that the HPO-based disease similarity network better exposed functional similarities among diseases than that of OMIM-based one. A case study on Alzheimer’s disease has been done to show the ability of our method in predicting novel <b>disease-associated</b> <b>genes.</b> We also note that, many other semantic similarity measures proposed to calculate similarity between annotated biomedical entities can be used to construct disease similarity networks. In addition, these networks can be constructed based on shared pathways [35], shared miRNA [36], shared protein complex [37], shared disease ontology [38] and disease comorbidity [39].

40|$|Over 3, 000 human {{diseases}} {{are known to}} be linked to heritable genetic variation, mapping to over 1, 700 unique genes. Dating of the evolutionary age of these <b>disease-associated</b> <b>genes</b> has suggested that they have a tendency to be ancient, specifically coming into existence with early metazoa. The approach taken by past studies, however, assumes that the age of a disease {{is the same as the}} age of its common ancestor, ignoring the fundamental contribution of duplication events in the evolution of new genes and function. Here, we date both the common ancestor and the duplication history of known human <b>disease-associated</b> <b>genes.</b> We find that the majority of disease genes (80 %) are genes that have been duplicated in their evolutionary history. Periods for which there are more <b>disease-associated</b> <b>genes,</b> for example, at the origins of bony vertebrates, are explained by the emergence of more genes at that time, and the majority of these are duplicates inferred to have arisen by whole-genome duplication. These relationships are similar for different disease types and the disease-associated gene's cellular function. This indicates that the emergence of duplication-associated diseases has been ongoing and approximately constant (relative to the retention of duplicate genes) throughout the evolution of life. This continued until approximately 390 Ma from which time relatively fewer novel genes came into existence on the human lineage, let alone disease genes. For single-copy genes associated with disease, we find that the numbers of disease genes decreases with recency. For the majority of duplicates, the disease-associated mutation is associated with just one of the duplicate copies. A universal explanation for heritable disease is, thus, that it is merely a by-product of the evolutionary process; the evolution of new genes (de novo or by duplication) results in the potential for new diseases to emerge...|$|E

40|$|Detection of <b>disease-associated</b> <b>gene</b> {{transcripts}} {{in primary}} disease tissues is frequently confounded {{by the presence}} of non-involved cell types. Alternative methods of detecting gene expression directly within tissues involve either the generation of antibodies, which can be a lengthy process and may suffer from lack of specificity, or amplification of reverse-transcribed cDNA in tissue sections (in situ RT-PCR). The latter method is highly specific and enables detection of transcripts in the cells originally responsible for their synthesis, but is highly destructive of tissue structures and can be carried out on only one or a few sections per experiment, resulting in low reproducibility. In this study, in situ RT-PCR was applied {{for the first time to}} commercially available tissue section microarrays enabling the examination of up to 70 different samples simultaneously. Modifications to the technique are detailed that preserved visible tissue and cellular structures and improved transcript detection whilst preventing significant generation of artefacts...|$|R
