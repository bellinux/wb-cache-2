Doro Pesch {{was one of the}} few exceptions; her qualities as vocalist and songwriter in Warlock, her commitment in promoting their music and her avoidance of posturing as a sex symbol won the respect of a solid fan base in the expanding European metal scene of that period, ensuring a long string of favorable articles and covers on the principal European metal magazines. In an interview in 2006 Doro remembered how [...] "we lived in paradise and had not noticed it, (...) we thought at the time, that now <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>on</b> and the success would continue automatically, (...) then came the great awakening".|$|E

Of course without success. A few years ago, Mr van Rensburg saw {{that this was not a}} fight he would ever win. It's a piece of tradition at Rob that could not be eradicated. He allowed the elephant to be painted. If it's Valentine's Day, he is pink painted with hearts. If the Blue Bulls play against the Lions, one day he is blue and the next day red and white. And so <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>on.</b> But one thing is certain: his blood is definitely orange! The little elephant even became the inspiration for the school's mascot ...|$|E

5000|$|Eastwood's {{views on}} war and {{politics}} were {{called into question}} and misjudged again {{with the release of}} his 2014 movie American Sniper, which was a #1 hit at the box office making over $90 million its opening weekend, the highest debut ever for an Eastwood film. The film was met with both strong critical praise and heavy criticism. Some Democrats in the media were labeling the film Republican propaganda, that Eastwood was a warmonger. Republicans however were calling it a Pro-War, Pro-Republican film; Eastwood responded by saying it was a [...] "stupid analysis" [...] and that the movie {{had nothing to do with}} political parties. Due to his speech at the 2012 Republican National Convention, some see him as a warmonger or right-wing poster boy, however, Eastwood said he has always opposed war, and is a pragmatic Libertarian rather than a red-meat Republican. Eastwood further explained his anti-war stance by saying [...] "I was a child growing up during World War II. That was supposed to be the one to end all wars.

40|$|The {{copyright}} {{law on the}} books is a large aggregation of specific statutory provisions; <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>on</b> for pages and pages.

They understand that those principles are expressed, if sometimes imperfectly, in the statutory language and the case law interpreting it, but they tend to believe that the underlying principles are what count. It is, thus, unsurprising that the rhetoric used in copyright litigation and copyright lobbying is more often drawn from the principles than the provisions...|$|E

Major cities in India now have numerous schools that offer lessons in Bharatanatyam, and these cities host hundreds of shows every year.|$|R
