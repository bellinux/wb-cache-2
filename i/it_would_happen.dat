5|$|In January 1942, Terboven {{announced}} the German administration would be wound down. Soon afterwards he told Quisling that Hitler had approved {{the transfer of}} power, scheduled for 30 January. Quisling remained doubtful <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> since Germany and Norway {{were in the midst}} of complex peace negotiations that could not be completed until peace had been reached on the Eastern Front, while Terboven insisted that the Reichskommissariat would remain in power until such peace came about. Quisling could nevertheless be reasonably confident that his position within the party and with Berlin was unassailable, even if he was unpopular within Norway, something of which he was well aware.|$|E
5|$|Blizzard {{posted a}} release {{date for the}} game's first beta of Summer 2009, but failed to release a beta during that time. Since May 6, 2009, it was {{possible}} to sign up for the beta phase of the game. In November 2009, the game's producer Chris Sigaty confirmed there would be no public beta for the game taking place in 2009 but assured fans that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> next year. In February 2010, Blizzard CEO Mike Morhaime announced that a closed beta would open later that month. On February 17, 2010, StarCraft II began closed beta testing, as promised. The beta was expected to last for 3–5 months. Beta keys for the initial release were sold on eBay for prices as high as $400. Blizzard also released a map editor for the beta as part of Patch 9. According to the company, they had planned to release a major content patch towards the end of beta testing. As of July 23, 2010, eighteen patches had been released for the beta (only seventeen on European servers), including a patch which provided access to the Galaxy map editor. On May 12, 2010 Blizzard released the beta client for computers running Mac OS X, for the users who had signed up. On May 17, 2010, Blizzard announced that {{the first phase of the}} beta test would be coming to an end in all regions on May 31, but it was later extended to June 7. The second phase began on July 7, 2010, and ended on July 19, 2010.|$|E
25|$|The {{sense of}} agency {{refers to the}} {{subjective}} feeling of having chosen a particular action. Some conditions, such as schizophrenia, {{can lead to a}} loss of this sense, causing a person to feel like a machine or even leading to delusions of being controlled from some outside source. The opposite extreme occurs too, with some people experiencing everything in their environment as if they had decided that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen.</b>|$|E

50|$|One {{possible}} reconstruction is as follows: For Diodorus, if {{a future}} event {{is not going}} to happen, then it was true in the past that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> not <b>happen.</b> Since every past truth is necessary (proposition 1), it was necessary that in the past <b>it</b> <b>would</b> not <b>happen.</b> Since the impossible cannot follow from the possible (proposition 2), it must have always been impossible for the event to occur. Therefore if something will not be true, it will never be possible for it to be true, and thus proposition 3 is shown to be false.|$|R

25|$|Around May 2016, another rumor {{started that}} a {{crossover}} fight between Mayweather and MMA star Conor McGregor {{was in the}} works. On May 7, 2016, Mayweather confirmed {{that he was the}} one who started the rumors regarding the potential clash. Mayweather followed it through with an Instagram post of an unofficial teaser poster showcasing both fighters. Mayweather reportedly talked to Freddie Roach to train McGregor for the fight in case <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen.</b> Dana White dismissed all the rumors and stated that Mayweather had yet to contact him in case he wanted the fight to push through, since McGregor was in contract with the UFC. On January 13, 2017, White continued his stance against a Mayweather-McGregor boxing matchup and insisted it would never happen due to McGregor's contract and even went as far as offering Mayweather to box McGregor in the UFC for $25 million.|$|E
25|$|Media outlets began {{reporting}} in late September 2009 that Comcast was in talks to buy NBCUniversal. Comcast denied the rumors at first, while NBC {{would not comment}} on them. However, CNBC itself reported on October 1 that General Electric was considering spinning NBCUniversal off into a separate company that would merge the NBC television network and its cable properties such as USA Network, Syfy and MSNBC, as well as Universal Studios, with Comcast's content assets. GE would maintain 49% control of the new company, while Comcast owned 51%. Vivendi, which owns 20%, would have to sell its stake to GE. It was reported that under the current deal with GE that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> in November or December. It was also reported that Time Warner would be interested in placing a bid, until CEO Jeffrey L. Bewkes directly denied interest, leaving Comcast the sole bidder. On November 1, 2009, The New York Times reported Comcast had moved closer to a deal to purchase NBCUniversal and that a formal announcement could be made sometime the following week.|$|E

The paper said, [...] "alf-covered in blue tarps, their rusted steel girders sticking out of concrete like veins from a freshly amputated arm, they await the political momentum to rescue them from rot". Real estate developer John Carroll hoped to site the columns at the Elizabeth Lofts, but former Rigga member James Harrison said {{he was reluctant to}} believe <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen,</b> given their history.

500|$|Another re-introduction {{involved}} the storyline surrounding the Siege of Riverrun, with actor Clive Russell {{returning to the}} show as Brynden [...] "the Blackfish" [...] Tully, who last appeared since the third-season episode [...] "The Rains of Castamere", in which the Red Wedding took place, and the Blackfish successfully evaded. In an interview with IGN, Clive Russell stated he was hopeful {{to return to the}} role saying [...] "I'd hoped that he'd come back because he comes back in the books again. But they're not doing the books -- there is no book to do it from. I'd hoped that would happen. I don't think I was surprised <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> because they bring back all kinds of people at all kinds of times. But it was good to go back there, I must say." ...|$|E
500|$|Bieber {{begins his}} verse {{approximately}} {{one minute and}} forty-five seconds in, singing the new lyrics [...] "It’s like every time you call me/ You know I can’t leave you lonely/ 'Cause I was always there when you need/ You said that you'd be there 'til the end/ What must I say/ I never thought <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> this way oh/ But I can tell if you're gone again/ got my number… things til the end.” Followed by another chorus and a verse by T.I., the song ends with a fade. A reviewer for the Inquisitor praised the collaboration, however Idolator's Christina Lee was critical of the remix, writing [...] "Two of them don’t sound like grown men — and they get the longer verses. French’s loopy rapping and off-key warbling is incoherent. Justin’s attempts to sound pained just sounds whiny." [...] It {{is the second time}} that Carey and Bieber have collaborated, the first being when the two re-recorded Carey's 1994 song [...] "All I Want for Christmas Is You" [...] for Bieber's 2011 Christmas album Under the Mistletoe.|$|E
500|$|... "First Strike" [...] first {{surfaced}} on September 2006. It {{was conceived}} {{after the completion}} of the mid-season two-parter, [...] "The Return", where writer Martin Gero wanted Atlantis leave the planet, but didn't know how and why <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> until the episode was written. Gero also wanted Atlantis damaged and drop out of hyperspace into deep space by the end, so the following episode [...] "Adrift" [...] would follow. The Stargate satellite was originally meant to be a moon-sized satellite sent to destroy Lantea, but was dropped in favour for the Stargate satellite to destroy Atlantis, since a previous episode [...] "Echoes" [...] involved the saving of Lantea, and Brad Wright deemed its proposed destruction inappropriate. The scene where Weir thought her leadership challenged was needed to be written, since there were several instances in past episodes where the military step in as leaders. The scene where Ronon Dex says he needs to learn more science was written to parallel Ronon's appearance in only a few scenes. Gero also wrote the Fantastic Four into the scene, where Sheppard compared Teyla Emmagan to the Invisible Woman, paralleling the lack of Teyla's appearance as well.|$|E

[...] Jim Ross said that Chyna had an [...] "overwhelming desire" [...] to be inducted during her lifetime. [...] On February 9, 2015, during a WWE Network podcast with Stone Cold Steve Austin, Triple H mentioned that Chyna deserved to be in the Hall of Fame but that problems with children Googling her prohibited it. The day following her death, a post on WWE.com expressed sadness about it and featured a video of her winning the Women's Championship. In an interview with The Daily Mirror shortly after her death, Triple H said that she [...] "definitely warranted" [...] a place in the Hall of Fame. [...] The following month, Stephanie McMahon said she was sure Chyna would be inducted but was not sure what year <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen.</b> After a long time without the WWE acknowledging anything about Laurer's career, on the April 25 episode of Raw, WWE played a memory posthumous tribute in her honor.|$|E
500|$|The Beatles {{were always}} {{assisted}} by Evans on their American tours, {{and when they}} played two shows at the Hollywood Bowl {{in the summer of}} 1965 Epstein arranged for them all to have a four-day rest in a luxurious horseshoe-shaped house on stilts in Benedict Canyon off Mulholland Drive in Los Angeles. They spent their time there smoking cannabis joints. Evans and Lennon swam in the large outdoor swimming pool with cigarettes in their mouths, to see who could keep them alight the longest. After recording sessions in London, Lennon, Harrison, and Starr would be chauffeured back to their houses in the [...] "stockbroker belt" [...] of southern England, but Evans, Aspinall, and McCartney would drive to a late-night club to eat steak, chips, and mushy peas. The Bag O'Nails nightclub was one of their favourites, at 8 Kingly Street in Soho, London, as it also presented live music. In his memoirs Evans wrote: 19 January and 20: [...] "Ended up smashed in Bag O'Nails with Paul [...] and Neil [...] Quite a number of people attached themselves, oh that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> to me... freak out time baby for Mal." ...|$|E
500|$|Johnston's {{plan was}} to attack Grant's left, {{separate}} the Union army from its gunboat support and avenue of retreat on the Tennessee River, and drive it west into the swamps of Snake and Owl Creeks, where it could be destroyed. The attack on Grant was originally planned for April 4, but it was delayed forty-eight hours due to a heavy rain storm that turned roads into seas of mud, causing some units {{to get lost in}} the woods and others to grind to a halt faced with heavy traffic jams. [...] It ended up taking Johnston 3 days to move his army just 23 miles. This was a significant setback for the Confederate Army, as the originally scheduled attack would have commenced when Buell's Army of the Ohio was too far away to be of any aid to Grant. [...] Instead, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> on the 6th with Buell's army close at hand and able to re-enforce Grant on the second day. [...] Furthermore, the delay left the Confederate Army desperately short of rations. [...] They had issued their troops 5 days of rations just before leaving Corinth, but failure to properly conserve their food intake and the 2-day delay left most troops completely out rations by the time the battle commenced.|$|E

500|$|... "Bop Gun" [...] {{marked the}} first episode in its new time slot on Thursdays at 10 p.m., occupying a period {{previously}} filled by L.A. Law. The show previously aired 9 p.m. on Wednesdays, where it was regularly defeated in the ratings by the ABC comedy Home Improvement. [...] "Bop Gun" [...] was written by David Mills and David Simon based on a story by Fontana. It was directed by Stephen Gyllenhaal, a feature director then-best known for such films as Waterland (1992) and A Dangerous Woman (1993). It was the first television script written by Mills, who previously worked as a reporter and became friends with Simon while studying journalism at the University of Maryland, College Park. Mills said of [...] "Bop Gun", [...] "That script inspired me to quit journalism. It was a golden opportunity, even though I didn't know what I was doing. I developed bad habits as a newspaper feature writer. I would always stretch a project to fill the available time." [...] "Bop Gun" [...] served as a departure from previous Homicide: Life on the Street episodes by focusing more strongly on a murder victim, {{rather than on the}} detectives. Simon felt the script's dialogue, particularly the detectives' use of dark humor as a coping mechanism for dealing with the horrors of the homicide unit, were faithful to reality. He particularly cited the scene in which Felton angers Ellison by talking excitedly about how much overtime he expected to get. Simon said, [...] "That's a conversation that would happen. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> in any homicide unit in America, and when I saw it actually being acted out I got a real kick in the pants because I thought, 'Wherever there are homicide detectives watching this, they're cracking up because they know how true it is.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Due to {{the changed}} situation, Molotov made {{a visit to}} Berlin on 12–13 November.

Hitler asked how the Soviet Union planned to settle the [...] "Finnish question". Molotov answered that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> {{in the same manner}} as in Bessarabia and the Baltic states. Hitler rejected this. In December, the Soviet Union, Germany, and the United Kingdom all voiced opinions concerning suitable Finnish presidential candidates. Risto Ryti was the only candidate none of these three powers objected to. He was elected on 19 December.|$|E
