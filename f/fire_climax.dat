50|$|The {{longleaf}} pine ecosystem is {{a diverse}} <b>fire</b> <b>climax</b> conifer pine dominate habitat that includes many rare {{plant and animal}} species found within the southeastern United States. Once a dominant ecosystem of the southeastern portion of the United States, it now occupies {{less than a quarter of}} the original range.

Although the ecosystem is broken up in present time, it still carries various {{plant and animal species}}. Many of the relevant species found in the longleaf pine ecosystem can be found in the ecosystem alone. The great concern for the ecosystem at the present is the continuation and health of the overall plant and animal species which reside within the area.

5000|$|The Poales are {{the most}} {{economically}} important order of monocots and possibly the most important order of plants in general. Within the order, {{by far the most}} important family economically is the family of grasses (Poaceae, syn. Gramineae), which includes the starch staples barley, maize, millet, rice, and wheat as well as bamboos (mostly used structurally, like wood, but somewhat as vegetables), and a few [...] "seasonings" [...] like sugarcane and lemongrass. Graminoids, especially the grasses, are typically dominant in open (low moisture but not yet arid, or also <b>fire</b> <b>climax)</b> habitats like prairie/steppe and savannah and thus form {{a large proportion of the}} forage of grazing livestock. Possibly due to pastoral nostalgia or simply a desire for open areas for play, they dominate most Western yards as lawns, which consume vast sums of money in upkeep (artificial grazing--mowing--for aesthetics and to keep the allergenic flowers suppressed, irrigation, and fertilizer). Many Bromeliaceae are used as ornamental plants (and one, the pineapple, is internationally grown in the tropics for fruit). Many wetland species of sedges, rushes, grasses, and cattails are important habitat plants for waterfowl, are used in weaving chair seats, and (especially cattails) were important pre-agricultural food sources for man. Two sedges, chufa (Cyperus esculentus, also a significant weed) and water chestnut (Eleocharis dulcis) are still at least locally important wetland starchy root crops.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. In {{this paper}} we propose a timber {{management}} scheme which mimics the patchy stand structure of a <b>fire</b> <b>climax</b> forest and has the desirable characteristic of retaining stands of trees of very old ages. We go on to do a preliminary economic analysis and determine that if management is taking place under the restriction that a certain fraction of the forest must be of at least some given age then this approach may be far superior to standard single age rotation schemes. KEY WORDS: Timber harvest, rotation, land management t biodiversity, economics. Introduction. With the current concern for the conservation of many forest dwelling species, harvest restrictions are arising on both public and private timber lands. Frequently, this results in a desire (or mandate) to maintain some fraction of the forest in stands much older than would naturally arise from standard timber managemen...|$|E

40|$|Aim of study: The {{objectives}} {{of this work}} were to determine which morphological and fire severity variables may help explain the mortality of adult Abies religiosa (Kunth) Schltdl. & Cham., to model the probability of this species after being affected by crown fire, and to obtain more elements to classify the sacred fir in terms of fire resistance. This type of study is relevant to understand and estimate the impacts of crown <b>fires</b> on the <b>climax</b> forests formed by this species. Area of study: The burned forest was located in the southern Mexico City, borough. Material and methods: Morphological variables and fire severity indicators were collected for 335 Abies religiosa trees burned by a mixed severity fire. Logistic regression was used to analyze data and develop models that best explained tree mortality. Main results: Survival was 26. 9 %. The models for height (p≤ 0. 0001), diameter at breast height (p= 0. 0082), crown length (p≤ 0. 0001) and crown base height (p≤ 0. 0001) were significant, with a negative relationship between {{each one of these}} variables and probability of mortality. The significant severity variables were lethal scorch height (p≤ 0. 0001) and crown kill (p≤ 0. 0001), which have a direct relationship with probability of mortality. Highlights: This species is moderately fire-resistant. Crown kill ≥ 70 % markedly increases mortality. Silvicultural activities such as pruning, thinning and fuel management can reduce the risk of crown fires...|$|R

40|$|The {{endangered}} red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis) {{has become}} a high-profile management issue in the southeastern United States. Suitable habitat consists of mature to old pine, or mixed pine-hardwood forest, with minimal hardwood midstory vegetation.

40|$|Abstract: Growing {{population}} and enhanced demand for fuelwood, timber and agricultural land are causing a rapid deforestation process throughout the tropics and subtropics. This {{pressure on the}} forest land is being accompanied by increasing occurrence of human-caused wildfires. In most cases the fires are following {{in the wake of}} the exploitation of natural forests and the slash-and-burn shifting agriculture, or they are set deliberately by graziers, hunters and collectors of minor forest products. It is estimated that each year wildfires affect more than 50 million hectares of forested land and about 600 million hectares of savannah and bush land within the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. An increasing tendency towards wildfire occurrence can be expected during the next decades. The collective scenario in the remaining noncommercial forest land will therefore be characterized by degraded and open formations, and the overall development of many forest communities will lead to an extended transformation into highly flammable <b>fire</b> <b>climax</b> savannas. Examples of this process are given by describing the development of the most prevailing forest types in tropical and subtropical Asia. Relevant concepts of future wildland fire management and research need to be oriented towards this future scenario...|$|E
40|$|Tropical {{mountain}} forest on Jawa is degrading fast {{because of the}} increasing demand for timber, fuelwood and fodder by the growing human population. In the upper watershed of the river Konto (total 233 km 2), 113 km 2 is covered by natural forest (65 km 2) or scrubland (39 km 2). Monitoring of aerial photograph interpretations of 1979 and 1984 showed almost no reduction of total 'natural vegetation', but big changes in structural density in the forest and transition of forest to scrub. Structure degradation seemed to be concentrated in the zone between 1400 and 1700 m on Mt. Kawi and Andjasmoro, while recuperation of the forest structure occured below 1400 m, especially on Mt. Dorowati. In a qualitative analysis of the vegetation composition, distinction has been made between two main forest types: Casuarina junghuhniana forest above 2000 m altitude on Mt. Kawi and Butak (<b>fire</b> <b>climax</b> vegetation), and mixed oak forest (Lithocarpus ssp.) below 2000 m. The mixed oak forests have been subdivided according to composition differences related to altitudinal zonation and basal structural differences. The distribution of height of saplings and trees has been analyzed per species group per vegetation type to test the probability of transitions between types. By combining results of the monitoring of aerial photograph interpretations and the vegetation analysis, processes of degradation and regeneration have been described roughly for the {{different parts of the}} area. The most important cause of degradation appeared to be the selective cutting of economical valuable species for timber, which gradually induces a change in composition to a secondary forest without primary forest species. The forests on lower altitude are not interesting for timber any more, here some recuperation of structure has been found. In this zone collection of fuelwood and fodder seemed to be important, because cutting of saplings has disturbed the age distribution of the trees. In some parts of this forest, natural gaps will be taken too easily by Eupatorium inulifolium because a new canopy cannot be formed quickly enough, regeneration of forest from dense Eupatorium scrub is very difficult. The present processes probably result in the vanishing of primary species within a few years period, while steadily more scrubland develops from secondary forest. Big management changes will be necessary to save the forest from further degradation. However, this is only possible when less people are dependent on the natural forest products to have a living. ...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1969 This {{analysis}} {{is the study}} of Oregon's wildlife resources from the period prior to white settlement up to the present time, including critical projections, based on present trends and expected conditions for both human and wildlife populations in the state up to the year 2010. Prior to white settlement Oregon was apparently part of a well balanced ecosystem. The fertile, moist valley regions were areas where an abundance of wildlife was found. Elk, deer, bear, antelope and their associated predators occupied these favorable sites. The Oregon Indian lived harmoniously within this environment. He conducted himself as a "prudent predator" and generally sought game which was most easily available. These animals were abundant enough to withstand the hunting pressure exerted by the limited Indian population. The only major deliberate control the Indian extended over his environment was burning. Indians ignited large areas to enhance the harvest of wild plants and animals. One of these areas was the Willamette Valley, parts of which were apparently maintained in a condition of <b>fire</b> <b>climax</b> or disclimax long prior to the arrival of white settlers. White pioneers arriving in Oregon in the 1840 's settled first in locations where the best agricultural land and available moisture was found. These areas coincided with prime game habitat and the immediate effect of settlement was the displacement of wildlife from their traditional ranges to areas of inferior fertility and moisture. The pattern of development of white civilization had a severe impact on wildlife populations from the late 1800 's to the early 1900 's. Drainage and reclamation projects coupled with prolonged drought periods drastically reduced waterfowl populations. Excessive killing of game for the meat, hide and feather value further reduced wildlife populations when market hunting reached its peak between 1870 and 1900. Predator and rodent cool efforts were directed toward improving agricultural conditions but often resulted in upsetting previous balances among several forms of wildlife. After 1893 wildlife management evolved through periods of protection, stocking, refuges, and systematic management. The Oregon State Game Commission and the United States Bureau of Biological Survey attempted to work cooperatively with several state and federal agencies in the 1920 's and 1930 's in an effort to restore depleted wildlife populations. The Taylor Grazing Act helped prevent further mismanagement of rangeland. The Migratory Bird Stamp Act allowed funds for waterfowl habitat purchases. Other legislation such as the Pittman-Robertson Federal Aid to Wildlife Restoration Act is further testimony of Federal Programs which have provided the means for wildlife restoration since the 1930 's. The general development of cooperative wildlife research units in the United States together with the formation of Oregon State University's Department of Fisheries and Wildlife were important steps in the movement toward more scientific wildlife management during the 1930 's. Several important wildlife management programs were developed in Oregon and successful wildlife restoration programs have continued up to the present time. Although wildlife populations have been largely restored through systematic management, they are again being lost. The next losses will be from severe competition with man for living space and resources. Based on demographic projections and current trends, it appears that the burgeoning human population will eventually cause the annihilation of many wildlife species. Upset watersheds, widespread pollution, increased competition for natural resources, and competition for living space between man and wildlife are unpleasant but real prospects for Oregon's future...|$|E
40|$|The {{conservation}} of biodiversity {{and natural resources}} relies {{to a large extent}} on the establishment of protected areas. However, protected areas often fail to meet the objectives that lead to their establishment, due to poor control over the manifold, legal and illegal human activities within protected areas, insufficient knowledge about system characteristics, in particular with respect to disturbance regimes, and due to inappropriate management strategies and means of implementation. The study investigates the responses of large herbivores to anthropogenic disturbances in Queen Elizabeth National Park (QENP), Uganda. Unique features of QENP are high human population densities within and outside the park and a high degree of habitat fragmentation, resulting from natural (topography, lakes, channel) and anthropogenic (villages, roads, cattle pastures) factors. Outstanding disturbances are man-made fires that frequently devastate large parts of the park. Fire frequency and severity have increased over the last decades, leading to widespread and long-lasting loss of herbivore feeding grounds. The study {{is based on the assumption}} that the present fire regime, in combination with other anthropogenic disturbances adversely affects the population development of the abundant large grazers in QENP under the local geo-ecological conditions. The main goals of this study are (1) to establish spatial and temporal habitat utilisation patterns of buffalo (Syncerus caffer), Uganda kob (Kobus kob thomasi) and hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius) in relation to the prevailing fire regime and other anthropogenic disturbances, and (2) to provide baseline data for the elaboration of a fire management plan. The study area is dominated by grassland in the central parts and bush-land with variable densities of bushes towards the water. Most of the study area is surrounded by water. Point surveys were conducted to estimate the distribution and abundance of the focal species, using Distance sampling. Environmental and anthropogenic factors were quantified by distances from each observation point using a Geographic Information System (GIS). All geo-referenced data were subject to multiple regression analyses. Regression models for several stages of vegetation development before and after burning were used to evaluate the spatial and temporal relationship between different disturbance factors and large herbivore abundance. The effects of increasingly frequent fires over the last decades in the study area are the spread of <b>fire</b> <b>climax</b> plant species such as Acacia sieberiana and shrubs of Acacia hockii, the spread of Imperata cylindrica, a widely indigestible grass species, and species-poor overgrazed grasslands in the main distribution area of Uganda kob. The distribution of Uganda kob is generally restricted to open grasslands and near to water in the North and East of the study area. Their movements in postfire-periods largely depend on the locality of burnt areas. Fresh pasture after burns is highly attractive to Uganda kob in all stages of postfire-development. However, adult males can suffer from food shortage after burns due to their strong attachment to their mating grounds (leks). Uganda kob does not show significant avoidance with regard to human activities, villages and roads. They are mostly affected by the decrease of suitable pasture in parts of the study area due to the encroachment of Imperata cylindrica. The data collected show that density of Uganda kob has significantly reduced in the western part of the study area where they were widely distributed two decades ago. In addition, the combination of frequent fires and heavy grazing after burns led to a loss of high quality grass species in their main distribution areas. The distribution patterns of buffalo are characterised by an accumulation of large herds in the central grasslands of the study area, while smaller herds occupy bush-land closer to the water. In postfireperiods buffaloes prefer tall grass savanna in the southern part of the study area. They utilise postfire pasture in burnt areas only in advanced stages of vegetation development. Buffaloes are affected by all quantified anthropogenic disturbances. They clearly avoid the vicinity of villages. The main road through the park restricts the movements of buffalo herds. Adverse effects of the habitat fragmentation become evident when home ranges of buffalo herds are burnt to a large extent. One of the outstanding threats to buffalo is, however, competition with life-stock. Over the last decades buffaloes have nearly disappeared in areas with live-stock occupancy. Furthermore, inter-specific competition is probable between buffalo and hippopotamus in their feeding grounds along the water in postfire-periods. Hippopotamuses are still abundant in large numbers in the study area. At present, they seem not to be affected by anthropogenic disturbances, apart from poaching. The equilibrium of population sizes of the mega-herbivores hippopotamus and elephant (Loxodonta africana) is important for maintaining the savanna structure in the study area, and in consequence for the viability of other herbivores. Since elephants are not abundant in high numbers, the spread of bushes is one of the aspects to be monitored with respect to habitat availability (open grasslands) for other large herbivores. Appropriate fire management strategies could regulate the grassland-bushland mosaic in the study area. Fire management is a tool to avoid adverse and amplify advantageous effects of fire on the habitats of herbivores. Recommendations for fire management in terms of controlled burning and protection from fires are given on the base of habitat classification that specifies temporal, spatial and functional aspects of the habitat use of large herbivores in time and space. The dynamic interrelations of anthropogenic and natural factors described may additionally contribute to adaptive strategies for the protection of wildlife in QENP...|$|E
