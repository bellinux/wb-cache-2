Two different types of configurations were designed for the filter <b>bed.</b> Single <b>media</b> <b>bed</b> consisted of 150 mm depth of silica sand with average particle diameter of 0. 5 mm. Dual <b>media</b> <b>bed</b> consisted of 100 mm depth of granulated charcoal with average particle diameter of 1. 0 mm and 50 mm of silica sand with average particle diameter of 0. 5 mm. Design considerations important to achieving this level of treatment include; pretreatment, media characteristics, hydraulic and organic loading rates and filter dosing techniques. Each sand filter configuration was operated daily for a period of 12 days.

Several granular m aterials {{can be used for}} generation, recycling, processing and recovery of oxygen and water. For example, they may include soft <b>bed</b> <b>media,</b> e. g. ion exchange resins for oxygen generation assembly and hard <b>bed</b> <b>media</b> such as, activated alumina, magchem (Magnesium oxide) and activa ted carbon to remove organic species like ethanol, methanol, and urea from wastewater in Water recovery/processing assembly. These beds are generally packed using a plate-spring mechanism to provide sufficien t compaction to the <b>bed</b> <b>media</b> throughout the course of operation. This paper presents results from an experimental study of a full-scale, 3 8. 1 cm (15 inches) long and 3. 7 cm (1. 44 inches) diameter. activated alumina bed enclosed in a cylinder determining its force-displacement behavior, friction mobilizing force, and axial normal stress distribu tion under various axially applied loads and at different levels of packing. It is observed that force-displacement behavior is non-linear for low compaction level and becomes linear with increase in compaction of the <b>bed</b> <b>media.</b> Axial normal stress distribution {{along the length of the}} <b>bed</b> <b>media</b> decreased non-linearly with increase in depth from the loading end of the granular media. This paper also presents experimental results on the amount of particulates generated corresponding to various compaction levels. Particulates generated from each of the tests were measured using standard US sieves. It was found that the p articulates and the overall displacement of the <b>bed</b> <b>media</b> increased with decrease in initial compaction of the <b>bed</b> <b>media.</b> This effect could be attributed to the greater tendency for inter-particle sliding/rub bing due to smaller internal friction angles, as seen from the shear tests, at lesser initial compacted levels. Upon unloading, it was obse rved that there was no change in displacement (especially rebounding) in the <b>bed</b> <b>media.</b> This effect could be attributed to the fact that th e porous activated alumina particles fracture/break upon increase in applied load (during loading phase) and occupy void spaces in between the material grains; thereby leading to settling of the media. The lo ad-displacement curve becomes more linear with increase in initial compaction of the <b>bed</b> <b>media.</b> It is concluded that compaction considerabl y affects the load-displacement behavior of the <b>bed</b> <b>media.</b> A series of tests were also conducted on the packed <b>bed</b> <b>media</b> to determine the f orce required to mobilize the friction between the <b>bed</b> <b>media</b> and the housing cylinder. The results from these tests showed the existence of significant friction between the <b>bed</b> <b>media</b> and the encasing stainles s steel cylinder. Further, it was found that friction effects were more pronounced for media with higher initial compaction. Internal frict ion of the granular media was measured using direct shear apparatus. It was observed that the internal friction increased with increase in initial compaction of the <b>bed</b> <b>media.</b> In this study, a computational m odel (CM) is also developed using finite element software ANSYS to verify experimental results obtained for the distribution of the axial n ormal stress and axial displacement along the length of the full-scal e activated alumina <b>bed</b> <b>media.</b> In the computational model, the granular material is considered to have appropriate failure and frictional c ontact exists between the wall and the granular media.

They {{were found to}} be effective at removing H 2 S from biogas in a previous study. A scrubber system utilizing TDRPTM and ORMTM was tested at the Ames Water Pollution Control Facility (WPCF) to determine operational conditions that would optimize the amount of H 2 S removed from biogas in order to allow for systematic sizing of biogas scrubbers. Operational conditions tested were empty bed contact time, mass of the <b>media</b> <b>bed,</b> compaction of the <b>media</b> <b>bed,</b> and temperature of the biogas and scrubber media. Additionally, siloxane concentrations were tested before and after passing through the scrubber. The two different types of products, TDRPTM and ORMTM, differed in metal concentrations and particle size distribution. A scrubber system was set up and maintained in the Gas Handling Building at the WPCF from February to December 2009. Results showed that longer contact times, compaction, and higher inlet H 2 S concentrations improved the amount of H 2 S that was adsorbed by the TDRPTM and ORMTM. The inlet H 2 S concentration of the biogas was found to be variable over time and was affected by large additions of fats, oils, and grease (FOG). The effect of temperature was not found to be significant. In excess of 98 % siloxane reduction was observed from the biogas.

The coagulant was dosed immediately prior to the filter inlet, with subsequent flocculation and deposition occurring in the filter bed. This single stage treatment option was considered appropriate for developing countries, due to observed treatment performance, robustness of operation and reduced treatment costs. This work extends and complements previously successful studies on the treatment of medium to high turbidity raw waters using M. oleifera seed.;Laboratory studies using twin 100 mm diameter filter columns, were undertaken with the following variables: turbidities of 5 - 75 NTU; filtration rates of 5 - 20 m/h; filter depths of 70 and 120 cm; dual and single <b>media</b> <b>beds,</b> and <b>media</b> sizes of 0. 50 - 1. 00 mm and 0. 85 - 1. 70 mm. Deeper <b>beds</b> and smaller <b>media</b> were found to considerably reduce filtrate turbidity when using M. oleifera seed. The consequent headloss increase was only significant with the higher turbidity waters; dual <b>media</b> <b>beds</b> were most effective on such waters. Turbidity removal was reduced at higher filtration rates (10 m/h), due to lower retention times in the bed, and increased detachment of retained particles causing early turbidity breakthrough. Higher filtration rates with another natural coagulant, chitosan, increased turbidity removal and prolonged the time to breakthrough, due to the reduction in surface removal in the filter. At lower loading rates (5 NTU at 5 m/h), removal with M. oleifera seed was comparable with chitosan and aluminium sulphate, with the additional advantage of a lower headloss. Optimisation of the hydraulic variables for a specific coagulant was considered necessary to ensure maximum output and filtrate quality.;Field trials on a low turbidity natural raw water indicated that M. oleifera reduced the turbidity by > 95 % and bacterial numbers by 100 % at the optimum dose.

40|$|Biological aerated filters {{operate as}} fixed film systems in which {{micro-organisms}} grow on a submerged fixed structured or granular inert support media within an aerated reactor (Stephenson et al., 1993). Periodic backwashing of the filter is required as the <b>media</b> <b>bed</b> gradually clogs {{due to the}} growth of biomass and retention of solids. The advantage of the BAF process is the small footprint it occupies relative to comparable processes such as activated sludge and trickling filters. The small footprint {{is due to the fact}} that the fixed film of biomass on the support material (media) leads to a high concentration of active bacteria per unit volume of the media and thereby to relatively small reactors. Another advantage is the retention of suspended solids that eliminate the need for final sedimentation tanks (Hagedorn et al., 1994). For the same degree of treatment, biofilters require approximately three times less aeration volume than activated sludge units, and twenty times less than trickling filters (Smith et al., 1992).

40|$|We {{previously}} reported that gas-phase byproducts of incomplete oxidation were generated when a prototype ultraviolet photocatalytic oxidation (UVPCO) air cleaner was operated {{in the laboratory}} with indoor-relevant mixtures of VOCs at realistic concentrations. Under these conditions, there was net production of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, two important indoor air toxicants. Here, we further explore the issue of byproduct generation. Using the same UVPCO air cleaner, we conducted experiments to identify common VOCs {{that lead to the}} production of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde and to quantify their production rates. We sought to reduce the production of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde to acceptable levels by employing different chemisorbent scrubbers downstream of the UVPCO device. Additionally, we made preliminary measurements to estimate the capacity and expected lifetime of the chemisorbent media. For most experiments, the system was operated at 680 - 780 m{sup 3 }/h (400 - 460 cfm). A set of experiments was conducted with common VOCs introduced into the UVPCO device individually and in mixture. Compound conversion efficiencies and the production of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde were determined by comparison of compound concentrations upstream and downstream of the reactor. There was general agreement between compound conversions efficiencies determined individually and in the mixture. This suggests that competition among compounds for active sites on the photocatalyst surface will not limit the performance of the UVPCO device when the total VOC concentration is low. A possible exception was the very volatile alcohols, for which there were some indications of competitive adsorption. The results also showed that formaldehyde was produced from many commonly encountered VOCs, while acetaldehyde was generated by specific VOCs, particularly ethanol. The implication is that formaldehyde concentrations are likely to increase when an effective UVPCO air cleaner is used in buildings containing typical VOC sources. The magnitude of the expected increase will depend upon a number of interrelated factors. Series of experiments were conducted to determine if the oxidizer, sodium permanganate (NaMnO{sub 4 }{center_dot}H{sub 2 }O), has sufficient reaction rates and capacity to counteract formaldehyde and acetaldehyde production and enable a 50 % reduction in building ventilation rate without net increases in indoor aldehyde concentrations. A commercially produced filter element and two laboratory-fabricated <b>media</b> <b>beds</b> containing NaMnO{sub 4 }{center_dot}H{sub 2 }O chemisorbent media were evaluated. The effectiveness of a device for removal of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and other VOCs was determined by measurement of concentrations immediately upstream and downstream of the device. In some experiments, conversion efficiencies and byproduct generation by the UVPCO device also were determined. Six experiments were conducted with the commercial filter element installed downstream of the UVPCO reactor. Eleven experiments were conducted with a single panel <b>media</b> <b>bed</b> (30 cm by 61 cm by 2. 5 cm deep) installed downstream of the UVPCO reactor; in these, the effects of temperature and air residence time on conversion efficiency were examined. Two experiments were conducted with a four-panel, folded, <b>media</b> <b>bed</b> (approximately four {{times the size of the}} single panel bed) installed downstream of the reactor. Because the commercial unit contained activated carbon as an additional component, it was effective at removing lower volatility compounds that typically have low oxidation rates in the UVPCO reactor. The filter element also met the minimum efficiency objective for formaldehyde. However, the removal of acetaldehyde was less than required. The air residence time in the single panel bed was not optimized as the removal efficiencies for both formaldehyde and acetaldehyde were strongly inversely related to the air flow rate through the device. In addition, the acetaldehyde removal efficiency decreased to less than 10 % with extended use of the device. The folded bed was considerably more effective; formaldehyde was removed with greater than 90 % efficiency, and acetaldehyde was removed at about 70 % efficiency. With the combined UVPCO/chemisorbent system, the net removal efficiencies for formaldehyde and acetaldehyde were 90 % and 40 %, respectively. In summary, the use of a multi-panel, folded scrubber filled with NaMnO{sub 4 }{center_dot}H{sub 2 }O chemisorbent media downstream of the prototype UVPCO air cleaner effectively counteracted the generation of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde due to incomplete oxidation of VOCs in the UVPCO reactor. Thus, this combined UVPCO air cleaner and chemisorbent system appears to have sufficient VOC removal efficiency to enable a 50 % reduction in ventilation rate without increasing indoor aldehyde concentrations...|$|R

30|$|Membrane {{technology}} {{is now a}} major component of water production, wastewater treatment and reclamation. The technology has technical challenges that include improved performance in terms of permeate quality and fouling control and socio-economic challenges in response to climate change and the MDGs. In desalination, there are opportunities to improve both membranes and modules. The future may also include novel techniques such as MD, FO and advanced EDR. Water treatment could see better membranes with both higher permeability and tighter cutoff, and the more common use of ceramic membranes. For both desalination and water treatment, there are examples where lower energy, and GHG emissions, can be obtained but at a capital cost penalty; this points to a possible paradigm shift in process specification. Water reclamation by RO could be assisted by improved biofouling control strategies under development. An alternative low pressure process combining a bioreactor and MD or FO has the potential to provide reclaimed water with less GHG emissions. MBRs continue to evolve including the moving biofilm MBR which has biomass supported on <b>floating</b> <b>media</b> and thereby achieves higher sustainable fluxes. Wastewater processing also provides opportunities to reduce net GHG emissions by using anaerobic MBRs. In the longer term energy from wastewater could come from the MFC, another form of MBR. Finally, membranes are very well suited to decentralized processing of water and wastewater, which is required to satisfy the MDGs. Improvements in affordability and integrity monitoring are required.|$|R
