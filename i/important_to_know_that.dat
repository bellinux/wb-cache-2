Prominent are Lady Ingegjerd Ottesdotter Rømer of Austrått and Lady Gørvel Fadersdotter (Sparre) of Giske. It is, however, <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> they acted as so-called 'pseudo men', i.e. in the formal rôle of a man (usually their deceased husband's, father's or brother's).

25|$|It is also {{interesting}} to note that different scholars frequently have different opinions regarding any given question. This is why there is usually more than one fatwa regarding any one question. In fact, {{there are a number of}} methodologies for how to understand evidence gathered from the previously mentioned sources of Islamic law. Scholars who follow different methodologies will frequently arrive at different answers to the same question. It is well known that in Islam there are four schools of thought, and each of them differ with respect to certain aspects. However, it is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> these differences are usually about minor issues. For example, in terms of beliefs, the vast majority of Muslims agree on most aspects of belief, most importantly the concept of monotheism, and belief in the angels, Prophets, holy books and the Day of Judgment.|$|E

[...] Then during the video shoot of the song Rowland said [...] "I feel like I've finally come into my own," [...] a reference to the exploration of a new musical sound. [...] "With the sound of dance music getting embraced more, I'm very excited, seeing how fans have been responding to the music. Dance music is more of a European thing, but I've been looking on Twitter and seeing fans (in different parts of the country) talking about playing 'Commander'." [...] She said working with Guetta was [...] "amazing" [...] because it is [...] "effortless" [...] and she feels a great sense of [...] "chemistry" [...] when working with him. Rowland felt she was trying something different: [...] "In this generation and this day and time, no one is putting soul in dance music... no pop artist. I thought maybe that was something I could try. And then it works." [...] In an interview for MSN Xin Rowland admitted the song was [...] "darker" [...] than her previous material but still fun. [...] "I just thought it'd be so much fun to be a commander of course. It's just a statement for me definitely, coming out on my own, filling my space. I'm happy being a commander".|$|E

2500|$|Botvinnik used almost {{exclusively}} queen-side pawn openings with the White pieces, in his eight World Championship matches, he never started {{a game with}} an e4 opening, and his usual choices as White were the English Opening or Queen's Gambit. When playing the Black pieces, he preferred the French Defense or Sicilian Defense in response to 1. e4 and the Slav Defense or Nimzo-Indian Defense in response to 1. d4. While Botvinnik did not use {{a wide range of}} openings, he made major contributions to those he did use, for example: the Botvinnik variation of the Semi-Slav Defense in the Queen's Gambit Declined, the Kasparov/Botvinnik system in the Exchange Variation of the Queen's Gambit Declined, the Caro-Kann Defence (both the Panov-Botvinnik Attack for White and various approaches for Black), the Winawer Variation of the French Defence, the Botvinnik System in the English Opening. In his openings research Botvinnik did not aim to produce tactical tricks that would only be effective once but rather systems in which he aimed to understand typical positions and their possibilities better than his rivals. His advice to his pupils included [...] "My theory of the openings fitted into one notebook" [...] and [...] "You don’t have to know that which everyone knows, but it is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> which not everyone knows."

40|$|Abstract: The radar {{ambiguity}} function plays {{a central}} role in the theory of radar signals. Its absolute value (jA(u) j) measures the correlation between the signal u emitted by the radar transmitter and its echo after reaching a moving target. It is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> signals <b>that</b> give rise to ambiguity functions of given shapes. Therefore, it is also <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>to</b> what extent jA(u) j determines the signal. This problem is called the ambiguity problem" by Bueckner [Bu]. Using methods developed for phase retrieval problems, we give here a partial answer for some classes of time limited (compactly supported) signals. In doing so, we also obtain results for Pauli's problem, in particular, we build functions that have innitely many Pauli partners...|$|R
