40|$|The {{ability of}} {{patients}} {{in many parts of}} the world to benefit from transplantation is limited by growing shortages of transplantable organs. The choice architecture of donation systems is said to play a pivotal role in explaining this gap. In this paper we examine the question how different defaults affect the decision to register as organ donor. Three defaults in organ donation systems are compared: mandated choice, presumed consent and explicit consent. Hypothetical choices from a national survey of 2069 respondents in May 2011 in the Netherlands – a country with an <b>explicit</b> <b>consent</b> <b>system</b> – suggests that mandated choice and presumed consent are more effective at generating registered donors than explicit consent.

40|$|In {{the last}} 25 years almost every West European country has enacted a {{transplantation}} law. During {{the preparation of}} these laws an important issue was whether to base the transplantation law on <b>explicit</b> or presumed <b>consent</b> regarding organ donation post-mortem. A common view of supporters of the presumed <b>consent</b> <b>system</b> {{is that it will}} result in more organ donors than the rule of <b>explicit</b> <b>consent.</b> In this article the difference between the different systems is further explored. For that purpose, the systems for post mortem donation in 10 West European countries will be discussed. Focus will be on the legal role of relatives within the consent process and finally on the role of relatives in practice. It will be argued that {{the difference between the two}} types of systems is less important than it seems to be at first sigh...|$|R
40|$|Next of kin decisive on organ {{donation}} Changing the donor registration systems {{is not expected}} to result in more donor organs. We better try to solve the bottlenecks in the donation process within hospitals and {{to reduce the number of}} refusals by next of kin, as NIVEL research shows, based on which study Remco Coppen took his doctor’s degree on 3 September at Tranzo, Tilburg university in the Netherlands In the Netherlands, about 1300 people are on the waiting list for a donor organ, but there are no more than about 200 to 220 donors each year. Consequently, there is a serious shortage of donor organs. Amendments to the Dutch Organ Donation Act or changes in the Dutch <b>consent</b> <b>system,</b> which is based on <b>explicit</b> <b>consent,</b> to a presumed <b>consent</b> <b>system</b> does not solve this shortage according to the PhD-thesis of Remco Coppen. "Indeed, countries with a presumed <b>consent</b> <b>system</b> have more donors, but those countries also have for example more traffic deaths. After adjusting the national donation rates for differences in mortality rates which are relevant for {{organ donation}} (e. g. traffic-deaths and CVA), the differences in donation rates between presumed and <b>explicit</b> <b>consent</b> countries disappear. The absence of differences in organ donor procurement between presumed and <b>explicit</b> <b>consent</b> countries can be explained by a similar practice around organ donation. In each country the medical staff consults the next of kin about the donation of organs: in practice, next of kin give their final approval, regardless of the <b>consent</b> <b>system.</b> ” Close contact with relatives Taking into account the differences in mortality rates for CVA and traffic-accidents between 10 Western European countries, only Spain and Austria have more donors than the Netherlands. In these countries, next of kin seem to be more willing to consent to organ donation. In Austria, this can probably be explained by its autopsy custom which makes the decision to donate organs easier. Spain is well-known for its intensive system and organisation of organ donation. An important element of the Spanish system is a very intensive contact between the medical staff and the relatives. Decision under pressure "It is remarkable that despite the positive attitude towards organ donation of the Dutch population, relatives often refuse a donation procedure," says Coppen. "The consultation of next of kin always takes place under very emotional and stressful circumstances. On the one hand, it is, therefore, required to educate people and to make sure they reflect about their view on organ donation, which may lead to consent registration or a family discussion on this topic. On the other hand, it is also important for the medical staff to be prepared for a consultation with next of kin regarding organ donation and to train them how to conduct such a consultation. However, there is still little known on communication styles which work in Dutch practice. We also hardly know why next of kin refuse the donation of organs. " No magic bullet "That a system change will not solve the organ shortage is a very disappointing message for people on the waiting list," says Coppen. "Although a system in which everyone is a donor (presumed consent) does not lead to more donor organs, such a system may show, for example, more solidarity with the people on the waiting list than our current <b>system</b> based on <b>explicit</b> <b>consent.</b> This may explain why there is still much debate about the Dutch <b>consent</b> <b>system.</b> " Hospitals Currently NIVEL studies the process of organ donation in hospitals, in collaboration with the Erasmus Medical Centre and iBMG of the Erasmus University. "There are disparities in the number of donations between similar hospitals. This suggests that there are still opportunities to increase the number of successful organ donation procedures", argues Coppen. "We now search for bottlenecks in the donation process in hospitals. These bottlenecks should be solved in order to prevent procedures being more difficult than necessary, and to prevent that for this reason organ donation procedures do not proceed. ...|$|R

As opportunities to save lives increase with new technologies and procedures, {{the number of people}} willing to donate organs needs to increase as well. In order to respect individual autonomy, voluntary consent must be determined for the individual's disposition of their remains following death. There are two main methods for determining voluntary consent: [...] "opt in" [...] (only those who have given <b>explicit</b> <b>consent</b> are donors) and [...] "opt out" [...] (anyone who has not refused consent to donate is a donor). In terms of an opt-out or presumed <b>consent</b> <b>system,</b> it is assumed that individuals do intend to donate their organs to medical use when they expire. Opt-out legislative systems dramatically increase effective rates of consent for donation (the so-called default effect). For example, Germany, which uses an opt-in system, has an organ donation consent rate of 12% among its population, while Austria, a country with a very similar culture and economic development, but which uses an opt-out <b>system,</b> has a <b>consent</b> rate of 99.98%.|$|R

40|$|Background. The {{degree of}} {{involvement}} by the next-of-kin in deceased organ procurement worldwide is unclear.

We collected data from 54 nations, 25 with presumed consent and 29 with <b>explicit</b> <b>consent.</b> We char-acterized {{the authority of the}} next-of-kin in the decision to donate deceased organs. Specifically, we examined whether the next-of-kin’s consent to procure organs was always required and whether the next-of-kin were able to veto procurement when the deceased had expressed a wish to donate. Results. The next-of-kin are involved in the organ procure-ment process in most nations regardless of the consent principle and whether the wishes of the deceased to be a donor were expressed or unknown. Nineteen of the 25 nations with presumed consent provide a method for individuals to express a wish to be a donor. However, health professionals in only four of these nations responded that they do not override a deceased’s expressed wish because of a family’s objection. Similarly, health profes-sionals in only four of the 29 nations with <b>explicit</b> <b>consent</b> proceed with a deceased’s pre-existing wish to be a donor and do not require next-of-kin’s consent, but caveats still remain for when this is done.

25|$|The term consent is {{typically}} {{defined as a}} subject adhering to an agreement of principals and regulations; however, the definition becomes difficult to execute concerning the topic of organ donation, mainly because the subject is incapable of consent due to death or mental impairment.

Of possible donors an estimated twenty-five percent of families refuse to donate a loved one's organs. Consent is defined as adhering to an agreement of principals.

The names and contact details of family members may also be recorded to facilitate further investigation.
