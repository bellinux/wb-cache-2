60|$|No marvel {{was it that}} Bill and his helper were as grimy as stokers of a furnace. Lenore {{began to}} choke with the fine dust and to feel her eyes smart and to see it settle {{on her hands and}} dress. She then had {{appreciation}} of the nature of a ten-hour day for workmen cutting eighteen acres of barley. How would they ever cut the two thousand acres of wheat? No wonder many men were needed. Lenore sympathized with the operators of that <b>harvester-thresher,</b> but she did not like the dirt. If she had been a man, though, that labor, hard as it was, would have appealed to her. Harvesting the grain was beautiful, whether in the old, slow method of threshing or with one of these modern man-saving machines.|$|E
50|$|The Canadian branch plant of the Plymouth Cordage Company {{was started}} in 1904 due to Parliament's {{initiation}} of a 25% import duty on rope and related products. Plymouth, with roots in Massachusetts, moved to secure its business in binding twine, necessary to package farm crops such as grass, wheat or straw. The city of Welland grew up around the Plymouth plant, which was prior to 1904, farmland (owned by Morwood, McCoppen, Leitch and Gunn). The cordage industry {{was a victim of}} the <b>harvester-thresher,</b> which obviated the need for binding (or baling) twine, as the threshing operation is now performed in a contiguous step immediately when the stalk is cut.|$|E
40|$|Frequent inquiry from wheat {{growers in}} Nebraska {{and others as}} to the {{relative}} merits of the combined <b>harvester-thresher</b> as an efficienct and economical harvesting machine led the Nebraska Agricultural College to make a study of this problem in the summer of 1926. The work was carried on by the Departments of Rural Economics and Agricultural Engineering, cooperating with the United States Department of Agriculture which was conducting a similar survey {{in different parts of the}} United States. Perkins county, Nebraska, was the area selected for study as it is more or less typical of those parts of the state where combines are used extensively. The purpose of this circular is merely to give such informaition as is available regarding harvesting costs by different methods in Nebraska and not to recommend one method over another since location, acreage, climatic conditions, and topopgraphy all have their influence in determining the most economic method for different communities...|$|E
