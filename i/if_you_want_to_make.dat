500|$|The Peregrine, by J. A. Baker, {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as one of the best nature books in English written in the twentieth century. Admirers of the book include Robert Macfarlane, Mark Cocker, who regards the book as [...] "one of the most outstanding books on nature in the twentieth century" [...] and Werner Herzog, who called it [...] "the one book I would ask you to read <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> films," [...] and said elsewhere [...] "... it has prose of the calibre that we have not seen since Joseph Conrad." [...] In the book, Baker recounts, in diary form, his detailed observations of peregrines (and their interaction with other birds) near his home in Chelmsford, Essex, over a single winter from October to April.|$|E

However, a competing meeting forced ISMB to change venues at short notice. The conference was held at Stanford University in August 1994 and was organised by Russ Altman, a research scientist at Stanford University School of Medicine. To emphasise the international aspect of the conference, ISMB 1995 was held at Robinson College, Cambridge. ISMB 1995 also marked a shift in the focus of the conference. ISCB Board member and Director of the Spanish National Bioinformatics Institute Alfonso Valencia has stated that, in 1995, [...] "the conference changed from a computer science-based conference to a point where everyone realized that, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> progress, there has to be more focus in biology." ...|$|E
