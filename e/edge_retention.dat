40|$|Biological {{edge effects}} are often {{assessed}} in high quality focal habitats that are negatively influenced by human-modified low quality matrix habitats. A {{deeper understanding of}} the possibilities for positive edge effects in matrix habitats bordering focal habitats (e. g. spillover effects) is, however, essential for enhancing landscape-level resilience to human alterations. We surveyed epixylic (dead wood inhabiting) forest-interior cryptogams (lichens, bryophytes, and fungi) associated with mature old-growth forests in 30 young managed Swedish boreal forest stands bordering a mature forest of high conservation value. In each young stand we registered species occurrences on coarse dead wood in transects 0 – 50 m from the border between stand types. We quantified the effect of distance from the mature forest on the occurrence of forest-interior species in the young stands, while accounting for local environment and propagule sources. For comparison we also surveyed epixylic open-habitat (associated with open forests) and generalist cryptogams. Species composition of epixylic cryptogams in young stands differed with distance from the mature forest: the frequency of occurrence of forest-interior species decreased with increasing distance whereas it increased for open-habitat species. Generalists were unaffected by distance. Epixylic, boreal forest-interior cryptogams do occur in matrix habitats such as clear-cuts. In addition, they are associated with the matrix edge because of a favourable microclimate closer to the mature forest on southern matrix <b>edges.</b> <b>Retention</b> and creation of dead wood in clear-cuts along the edges to focal habitats is a feasible way to enhance the long-term persistenc...|$|R
40|$|The {{retention}} of methyl iodide in charcoal beds {{was found to}} vary with {{the distance from the}} leading edges of the beds. Near the leading <b>edges,</b> <b>retention</b> was less than in the deeper regions, probably due to the chemi-sorption of competing vapours in the airstream drawn through the beds. One of the poisoning agents was identified as di-methyl sulphate vapour. The penetration of methyl iodide fell exponentially with distance in the deeper regions of the beds. The slope of the penetration curves in these deeper regions was dependent on the relative humidity and the face velocity in a more complex manner than the simple relationship assumed in the 'Stay Time" concept. An empirical formula, which gave the slope of the penetration curve within a standard deviation of 7 per cent, was derived to correlate the parameters over the range of practical interest, i. e. 30 - 99 per cent relative humidity and from 1. 1 m s- 1 down to at least 0. 16 m s- 1, and probably much lower. The uncertainty in the results could have been caused by variations within the batches of charcoal. A formula was derived to translate the results of an in situ test at a measured flowrate and humidity into an expected performance at high humidity and any other flowrate. The expression is independent of the slope of the penetration curve and the thicknesses of both the poisoned and unpoisoned regions of the bed, which suggests that it may be valid even for heavily poisoned beds...|$|R

40|$|The waters around South Georgia {{are among}} the most {{productive}} in the Southern Ocean, with zooplankton populations close to the island, in particular Antarctic krill, supporting vast colonies of higher predators. However, our understanding of the processes governing variability in the supply of these food resources is limited by the poor spatial and temporal resolution of available data. Here, we use a numerical modeling approach to examine the underlying physical processes driving the recruitment and retention of zooplankton to the South Georgia shelf. Variability in the magnitude and spatial distribution of recruitment was dominated by the proximity and orientation of the southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current front to the shelf <b>edge.</b> Shelf <b>retention</b> was highest for source sites on the southwest shelf, with the main transport routes off the shelf to the north and northwest. Retention was lowest in the austral summer and winter; in summer increased glacial melt drives stronger off-shelf near-surface currents, while in winter, stronger winds lead to an increase in off-shelf transport. Of particular note was the prediction of a significant increase in retention for particles released throughout the shelf in April and July 2000. This period coincided with the development of pronounced anticlockwise shelf flows, associated with horizontal density gradients due to reduced wind mixing of shelf waters, and differences between shelf and oceanic waters, which significantly reduced off-shelf transport rates. Such findings are crucial for understanding the influence of variability in physical processes on the ecosystem at South Georgia...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2004 There is {{widespread}} {{interest in the}} ecological effects of timber harvest, the resultant fragmentation of forest habitat, and the increased area of forest edges. However, there has been surprisingly little research devoted to the consequences of these management activities for understory plants. I investigated short-term responses of understory plants to timber harvest and creation of <b>edges</b> in aggregated <b>retention</b> harvest units at two sites in the western Cascade Range of Washington. Pre- and post-treatment abundance of vascular plants and ground-layer bryophytes was measured in four, 1 -ha aggregates (patches of intact forest) and in surrounding harvest areas along 16 transects placed perpendicular {{to the edges of}} these aggregates. For three late-seral herbs, Asarum caudatum, Clintonia uniflora, and Pyrola picta, demographic data (ramet survival, clonal growth, flowering rate, and seedling density) were collected before and for 2 yr after treatment within nine plots in the harvest area and nine in adjacent undisturbed forest. For these same species, morphological and physiological acclimation to removal of the forest overstory was assessed by comparing leaf mass per unit area and leaf chlorophyll content from 20 leaves of plants representing each environment (harvest area and undisturbed forest). Two years after logging, 25 % of common vascular plants and 60 % of common bryophytes showed significant harvest-related declines in abundance. Forest aggregates retained populations of species that disappeared from or declined substantially in harvest areas, but showed edge-related changes in plant abundance. Within aggregates, herbaceous species showed larger declines in abundance with proximity to edge than did shrubs or bryophytes, with declines becoming more prominent over time. Asarum, Clintonia, and Pyrola showed different demographic and physiological responses to timber harvest, suggesting that late-seral species that are assumed to respond similarly to timber harvest and associated environmental stresses employ different strategies for re-establishment and long-term recovery. Forest aggregates, which are integral components of current harvest prescriptions, may be especially important as refugia for those plant species that require long periods of time to recover from harvest-related declines...|$|R
40|$|Trace {{contaminant}} adsorption on activated charcoal, Barnebey Cheney type 208, was studied using a gas chromatogram. Chromatograms {{were obtained}} experimentally by eluting pulses of different volumes through charcoal columns, using nitrogen as the carrier gas. Experimental data are reported for methanol, ethanol, 2 -propanol, 1 -butanol, toluene and trichloroethylene at 50, 100 and 150 C. For the alcohols and trichloroethylene, the following cases were considered: adsorption on (a) a clean bed, (b) a bed {{having the same}} compound adsorbed on it, and (c) a bed having toluene preadsorbed on it. All compounds were irreversibly adsorbed, the amount increasing {{with an increase in}} molecular weight and decreasing at higher temperatures. The elution curves have pronounced asymmetry, with a sharp leading edge and a long trailing <b>edge.</b> The average <b>retention</b> time varied with the pulse volume injected. The presence of toluene preadsorbed on the charcoal reduced the average retention time of each contaminant. The observed data are interpreted by a model that takes into account the nonlinearity of the adsorption isotherm at low surface coverages and axial dispersion. The adsorption isotherms are well represented by the Dubinin-Radushkevich-Stoeckli (DRS) characteristic curve equation. The micropore volume of charcoal was found to depend on the adsorbate used as a molecular probe. Effective axial dispersion coefficients were calculated from the first moments of the chromatographic peak. The effective axial dispersion coefficient was correlated with the superficial velocity and molecular diffusivity. The breakthrough times of toluene vapor at 100, 150 and 200 (DEGREES) C were obtained by subjecting the charcoal column to an inlet containing a fixed vapor concentration. Up to c(,z) /c(, 0) = 0. 05, the breakthrough time varied linearly with {A + B ln(c(,z) /c(, 0)) }. The intercept A, obtained from a linear regression analysis, was found close to t(, 0. 5), the time to reach 50 % of inlet concentration. The predicted values based on the absorption isotherm equation, compared well with those obtained experimentally, the maximum deviation being 30 %. The pseudo first order rate constant was calculated from the slope B. This rate constant was correlated with superficial velocity and temperature...|$|R

The other is a composite structure made by welding together iron and steel to give a visible pattern on the surface, called pattern welded steel. Although both were referred to as Damascus steels, true Damascus steels were not replicated in Europe until 1821.|$|E

Our method has three main steps: suppressing high-contrast details via a windowed variation similarity measure, detecting salient edges to produce an edge-guided image, and fitting the original shape using a weighted least squares framework. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach can appropriately smooth non-edge regions even when textures and structures are similar in scale. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated in the contexts of detail manipulation, HDR tone mapping, and image abstraction.|$|E
