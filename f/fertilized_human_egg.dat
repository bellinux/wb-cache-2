50|$|Many {{supporters}} {{and opponents of}} abortion rights justify their position on NAP grounds. One important question {{to determine whether or}} not abortion is consistent with NAP is at what stage of development a <b>fertilized</b> <b>human</b> <b>egg</b> cell can be considered a human being with the status and rights attributed to personhood. Some supporters of NAP argue this occurs at the moment of conception. Others argue that since they believe the fetus lacks sentience until a certain stage of development, it does not qualify as a human being, and as such may be considered property of the mother. Opponents of abortion, on the other hand, state sentience is not a qualifying factor. They refer to the animal rights discussion and point out the Argument from marginal cases that concludes NAP also applies to non-sentient (i.e. mentally handicapped) humans.|$|E
5000|$|There are, however, some exceptions. Since 2007 Mexico City —where {{approximately}} 7.87% of {{the national}} population lives— offers abortion on request to any woman up to 12 weeks into a pregnancy which, along with Cuba and Uruguay, {{is one of the}} most liberal legislations on this matter in Latin America. In contrast, recent political lobbying on behalf of the dominant Roman Catholic Church and pro-life organizations has resulted in the amendment of more than half of the state constitutions, which now define a <b>fertilized</b> <b>human</b> <b>egg</b> as a person with a right to legal protection. , none of those states removed its exceptions to abortion to reflect the changes in its constitution, but according to Human Rights Watch and a local NGO, over the past eight years the conservative-leaning state of Guanajuato [...] "has denied every petition by a pregnant rape victim for abortion services", and about 130 of its residents have been sentenced for seeking or providing illegal abortion. However, these days the government is aware of the existence of the institution called 'Las Libres de Guanajuato' which provides abortions and support for women in need, and ignores its existence.|$|E
40|$|Development of a <b>fertilized</b> <b>human</b> <b>egg</b> into {{an average}} sized adult {{requires}} about 29 trillion cell divisions, thereby producing enough DNA to stretch to the Sun and back 200 times (DePamphilis and Bell, 2011) ! Even more amazing {{is the fact}} that throughout these mitotic cell cycles, the human genome is duplicated once and only once each time a cell divides. If a cell accidentally begins to re-replicate its nuclear DNA prior to cell division, checkpoint pathways trigger apoptosis. And yet, some cells are developmentally programmed to respond to environmental cues by switching from mitotic cell cycles to endocycles, a process in which multiple S phases occur in the absence of either mitosis or cytokinesis. Endocycles allow production of viable, differentiated, polyploid cells that no longer proliferate. What is surprising is that among the 516 (Manning et al., 2002) to 557 (BioMart web site) protein kinases encoded by the human genome, only eight regulate nuclear DNA replication directly. These are Cdk 1, Cdk 2, Cdk 4, Cdk 6, Cdk 7, Cdc 7, Chk 1 and Chk 2. Even more remarkable {{is the fact that}} only four of these enzymes (Cdk 1, Cdk 7, Cdc 7 and Chk 1) are essential for mammalian development. Here we describe how these protein kinases determine when DNA replication occurs during mitotic cell cycles, how mammalian cells switch from mitotic cell cycles to endocycles, and how cancer cells can be selectively targeted for destruction by inducing them to begin a second S phase before mitosis is complete...|$|E

Utdrag fra innledningen: Arguments {{concerning}} organ {{donors and}} other so called ‘bio-ethical’ {{questions have been}} numerous both in the popular press and in more specialized publications during {{the last couple of}} years. Questions regarding selection of and research on <b>fertilized</b> <b>human</b> <b>eggs,</b> abortion, organ donation and euthanasia have been aggressively debated both by the general public and by professional philosophers, and in all likelihood these arguments will continue and grow in the foreseeable future as we see the possibilities of intervention and ‘improvement’ increasing through medical research. However, several of these arguments arise from positions that appear to take certain ideas about both moral philosophy and the human body for granted. Usually these ideas point to a certain ‘location’ within our lives or our bodies as the starting point or foundation of our moral worth or lack thereof; and many of the disputes and the participants in these subsequently disagree more about where exactly this marker {{is to be found in}} a ‘technical’ sense than anything else.

40|$|Excessive {{amounts of}} {{reactive}} oxygen species (ROS) cause a state of oxidative stress, which result in sperm membrane lipid peroxidation, DNA damage and apoptosis, leading to decreased sperm viability and motility. Elevated levels of ROS are {{a major cause of}} idiopathic male factor infertility, which is an increasingly common problem today. Lycopene, the most potent singlet oxygen quencher of all carotenoids, is a possible treatment option for male infertility because of its antioxidant properties. By reacting with and neutralizing free radicals, lycopene could reduce the incidence of oxidative stress and thus, lessen the damage that would otherwise be inflicted on spermatozoa. It is postulated that lycopene may have other beneficial effects via nonoxidative mechanisms in the testis, such as gap junction communication, modulation of gene expression, regulation of the cell cycle and immunoenhancement. Various lycopene supplementation studies conducted on both humans and animals have shown promising results in alleviating male infertility-lipid peroxidation and DNA damage were decreased, while sperm count and viability, and general immunity were increased. Improvement of these parameters indicates a reduction in oxidative stress, and thus the spermatozoa is less vulnerable to oxidative damage, which increases the chances of a normal sperm <b>fertilizing</b> the <b>egg.</b> <b>Human</b> trials have reported improvement in sperm parameters and pregnancy rates with supplementation of 4 - 8 mg of lycopene daily for 3 - 12 months. However, further detailed and extensive research is still required to determine the dosage and the usefulness of lycopene as a treatment for male infertility...|$|R

40|$|Rapid {{expansion}} {{of technology in}} medicine {{over the last few}} decades has both enhanced our lives and complicated our laws. For example, thanks to advances in science and medicine, couples who were previously unable to reproduce are now able to do so with the help of donors, medical personnel, {{and a host of other}} middlemen facilitating the process. The growth of medical technology has also lead to the advent of using <b>human</b> <b>eggs</b> for medical research. However, despite competing for eggs from a small pool of willing donors, there is a disparity in the law between the treatment of <b>human</b> <b>egg</b> donation for reproduction purposes and <b>human</b> <b>egg</b> donation for research purposes (stem-cell research and <b>human</b> cloning). Similarly, <b>egg</b> donors for reproductive purposes may earn a substantial profit for their 2 ̆ 2 donations, 2 ̆ 2 but donors for research generally are not compensated. This disparity is the result of legislation reflecting refusal by the public to make allowance for payment for eggs used for research because human embryos are often manipulated and destroyed by the research process. The public disapproval of human cloning and stem cell research has resulted in ill advised state and national legislation which provides bad actors the ability to treat both donors and recipients of donor eggs unethically. Recent research has revealed serious medical risks involved in harvesting <b>human</b> <b>eggs.</b> These risks have lead the medical community to question whether donors are truly able to give informed consent to donation. Nevertheless, few states have enacted legislation to protect egg donors, and there are no systematic regulations in place to ensure that donors and recipients are truly aware of the risks involved in egg harvesting procedures. Compounding these concerns, clinics often outsource recruitment of donors to independent egg brokers who are not subject to ethical guidelines, thereby enabling clinics using the brokers to avoid regulations without being tainted by unethical activity.
