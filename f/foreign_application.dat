50|$|Prior art on an IDS is {{typically}} broken up into three categories: US patent literature, foreign patent literature, and non-patent literature (NPL). US patent literature consists of issued US patents and US patent application publications. Copies of listed US patent literature {{do not need}} to be submitted along with the IDS as USPTO examiners have access to all US patent literature. Foreign patent literature consists of patents issued in foreign countries, <b>foreign</b> <b>application</b> publications if they exist, and PCT international application publications. Non-patent literature consists of any publication that is not a US or foreign patent publication, such as magazine articles or research journals. Copies of listed non-patent literature (NPL) and foreign patent publications need to be submitted along with the IDS or they will not be considered by USPTO examiners. If the copies of NPL or foreign patent publications are not in the English language, the applicant must also submit an English translation or a summary of relevancy in the English language in order for the piece of art to be considered by the examiner.|$|E

Thus, the valuation of intellectual property, specifically patents, {{has been one of the}} most difficult investment problems both for practitioners and academics. Traditional valuation methods fail to account for the unique characteristics of patents; uncertainty and management flexibility.

40|$|One {{important}} {{intention of}} human-centered information visualization is to represent {{huge amounts of}} abstract data in a visual representation that allows even users from <b>foreign</b> <b>application</b> domains {{to interact with the}} visualization, to understand the underlying data, and finally, to gain new, application-related knowledge. The visualization will help experts as well as non-experts to link previously or isolated knowledge-items in their mental map with new insights. Our approach explicitly supports the process of linking knowledge-items with three concepts. At first, the representation of data items in an ontology categorizes and relates them. Secondly, the use of various visualization techniques visually correlates isolated items by graph-structures, layout, attachment, integration, or hyperlink techniques. Thirdly, the intensive use of visual metaphors relates a known source domain to a less known target domain. In order to realize a scenario of these concepts, we developed a visual interface for non-experts to maintain complex wastewater treatment plants. This domain-specific application is used to give our concepts a meaningful background...|$|E
40|$|This work {{studies the}} problem of {{semantic}} analysis of multimedia data. Given a segment of a multimedia document {{and a set of}} clearly defined concepts, our goal is to compute the probabilities that each concept exists in the input multimedia data. We follow the machine learning approach, where multiple low-level features are extracted from the content, which are subsequently fused, normalized and processed before the computation of probabilities by a classifier. These probabilities are used for the indexing and retrieval of multimedia data, even if the data have not been manually annotated. We first examine the use of classifiers that have been trained at <b>foreign</b> <b>application</b> domains for improving retrieval effectiveness. We propose a concept fusion scheme where a layer of base classifiers is used. These classifiers have been trained at a <b>foreign</b> <b>application</b> domain for each low-level feature separately. Using their outputs we train a final classifier that computes the output probabilities. We introduce the Maximum Information and Top-k criteria for selecting the base classifiers. The effectiveness of the proposed fusion scheme is experimentally evaluated on two large scale multimedia datasets (TRECVID- 2005 and a collection of images from the Belga news agency), for a large number of concepts. We subsequently seek ways to replace the base classifiers with “property detectors”, that are simply probability distributions in the feature space. Our approach is to partition the feature space and assign one distribution to each partition subset, where the distribution is defined parametrically from the data. A set of experiments is performed where the proposed method increases the effectiveness in both classification and multimedia retrieval problems. Furthermore, we examine a set of problems that are related to the practical application of the detection system for a large number of concepts. We propose a protocol for concept selection and disambiguation, as well as the generation of the classifier training sets. This protocol was applied efficiently for more than 500 concepts. Furthermore, we evaluate a set of methods for the automatic construction of training sets using clickthrough data. A novel audio low-level feature is also proposed, that allows the effective detection of concepts that are related to the audio channel. Finally, a short report is included about two systems that achieved competitive results at the TRECVID large scale international video retrieval benchmark. ...|$|E

40|$|We present Cider, an {{operating}} system compatibility architecture that can run applications built for different mobile ecosystems, iOS or Android, {{together on the}} same smartphone or tablet. Cider enhances the domestic operating system, Android, of a device with kernel-managed, per-thread personas to mimic the application binary interface of a foreign operating system, iOS, enabling it to run unmodified foreign binaries. This is accomplished using a novel combination of binary compatibility techniques including two new mechanisms: compile-time code adaptation, and diplomatic functions. Compile-time code adaptation enables existing unmodified foreign source code to be reused in the domestic kernel, reducing implementation effort required to support multiple binary interfaces for executing domestic and <b>foreign</b> <b>applications.</b> Diplomatic functions leverage perthread personas, and allow <b>foreign</b> <b>applications</b> to use domestic libraries to access proprietary software and hardware interfaces.

40|$|Abstract — Computing {{utilities}} {{based on}} virtual machines (VMs) migrating among distributed computing resources {{are becoming increasingly}} practical and emerging as a viable infrastructure for outsourcing computer services. Here, we present a large scale distributed computing architecture named public public computing utility (PCU), where nondedicated public resources are augmented with privately owned dedicated resources to obtain higher levels of quality of service (QoS) for compute intensive applications. Virtual machines are used to isolate <b>foreign</b> <b>applications</b> from the host systems and to facilitate seamless migrations. We have proposed several heuristics for scheduling VMs among the resources in PCU. Extensive simulations we performed indicate that the proposed heuristics are able to improve the QoS delivered by the PCU by utilizing {{the public and private}} resource combinations while reducing the VM migrations...|$|R

40|$|<b>Foreign</b> <b>applications</b> for Chinese patents {{have been}} growing by over 30 % a year. This paper explores two {{hypotheses}} in explaining the foreign patenting surge in China: market covering and competitive threat. With foreign companies more deeply engaged with the Chinese economy, returns from protecting their intellectual property in China have increased. As domestic Chinese firms' ability to imitate foreign technology gains strength and competition between foreign firms intensifies in the Chinese market, such competitive threat creates an urgency for protecting intellectual property. Using a database that comprises China's State Intellectual Property Office patents and the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office patents, I find {{strong support for the}} competitive threat hypothesis. The estimates imply that competition between foreign firms in China can account for 36 % of the annual growth of foreign patenting in China. Foreign patenting China Competition Imports...|$|R
