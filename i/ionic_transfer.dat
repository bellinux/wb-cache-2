50|$|Liquid {{junction}} potential {{occurs when}} two electrolytic solutions of different concentrations are {{in contact with}} each other. The more concentrated solution will {{have a tendency to}} diffuse into the comparatively less concentrated one. The rate of diffusion of each ion will be roughly proportional to its speed in an electric field. If the anions diffuse more rapidly than the cations, they will diffuse ahead into the dilute solution, leaving the latter negatively charged and the concentrated solution positively charged. This will result in an electrical double layer of positive and negative charges at the junction of the two solutions. Thus at the point of junction, a potential difference will develop because of the <b>ionic</b> <b>transfer.</b> This potential is called liquid junction potential or diffusion potential which is non-equilibrium potential. The magnitude of the potential depends on the relative speeds of the ions' movement.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, the redox {{switching}} behaviour of Prussian blue (PB) in KCl {{environment at}} pH 2. 5 and 5. 4 was investigated by using ac-electrogravimetry in a potential range around {{the conversion of}} PB to ES (Everitt Salt). This technique allows the electrochemical impedance and a mass-potential transfer function to be simultaneously measured. From the impedance the charge-potential transfer function is calculated. A model of the PB film, is presented, it {{takes into account the}} porous structure of the material, the insertion of two cations on the pore wall, and the electronic charge transfer from the electrode. A fitting procedure was employed to obtain the kinetic parameters. Attractive information extracted from the impedance concerns the porosity of the PB film which is related to the zeolitic nature of the film. The resistivity of the pore depends obviously on the electrolyte conductance and changes with respect to the potential with a minimum, {{in the vicinity of the}} PB ES conversion potential. Ac-electrogravimetry and the charge-potential transfer function gave essentially information on the kinetics of the <b>ionic</b> <b>transfer.</b> Thanks to the model of electroactive porous films and the digital fitting procedure, for the first time, the two cations K+ and H 3 O+ are identified with well separated kinetics for each cation. Several attractive informations were reached. First, it confirms that <b>ionic</b> <b>transfer</b> at the film/electrolyte interface limits the kinetics of the film reduction or oxidation as electronic transfer at the electrode/film interface is faster. Moreover, the rates of the electronic and <b>ionic</b> <b>transfer</b> kinetics vary with the potential. They are faster around the potential where the PB ES conversion occurs. It was confirmed that charge compensation occurs only by K+ and H 3 O+ movements whatever the pH of the solution. However, H 3 O+ transfer kinetics is faster than K+ transfer, whatever the KCl concentration, and the role of H 3 O+ is more important for large KCl concentrations where the process is more limited by the kinetics of the hydronium ions. In addition, in these situations, even if <b>ionic</b> <b>transfer</b> is also accelerated the global charge transfer is nevertheless more controlled by electronic transfer...|$|E

We consider here α-lactalbumin (α-LA), a metalloprotein predominant in whey and attractive due to its properties. This work aims at determining the impact of filtration at molecular and macroscopic levels by considering both α-LA functional / structural characteristics. Methodology (do not include for Commercial Appeal submission) Dead-end ultrafiltration was conducted on purified apo-α-LA solutions using polyethersulfone (PES 10 - 100 kg. mol- 1) or polyacrylonitrile (PAN 40 kg. mol- 1) membranes. Collected samples were systematically described in terms of composition, structure (e. g. spectroscopy) and functionality (e. g. solubility). Results and Discussion Regardless of the membrane, the Ca 2 +/α-LA ratio increased in the permeate. This induced a (partial) transition from the apo- to the holo-form of the protein as noticed by structural analyses. With PES 100 kg. mol- 1, functional modifications were not significant after permeation because of a slight increase in Ca 2 +/α-LA ratio. Oppositely, after permeation through a 30 - 40 kg. mol- 1 membrane, α-LA solubility and thermal stability were increased even if <b>ionic</b> <b>transfers</b> were highly affected by the membrane nature. Using PES 10 kg. mol- 1, protein functionality was altered: all structural results suggested a protein compaction after permeation and thus a predominant role of pore shear stress. Simultaneously, modifications noticed in retentates (e. g. aggregation) are discussed in terms of filtration performances.
