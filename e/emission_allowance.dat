5000|$|The PG&E {{and other}} {{investor}} owned utilities that are essentially granted monopoly status in California are guaranteed a negotiated fair {{rate of return}} on equity (ROE). PG&E's ROE rate was set at 10.4% and a return on rate base (ROR) was set at 8.06% by the CPUC in December 2012. PG&E electricity rates are {{among the highest in the}} United States. In his 2013 paper Jonathan Cook of the UC Davis Energy Efficiency Center, described the 'unique factors' that explain why PG&E's rates are higher than other utilities in California. According to Cook, PG&E procures 60% of its electricity supply from 3rd party generators and 40% from nuclear, fossil fuel and hydroelectric power plants. Many of the dams that produce PG&E's hydroelectric power were built in the early 1900s and require high maintenance. The cost of hydroelectric power maintenance is estimated to rise from $28 million in 2012 to $48 million. PG&E [...] "current and near-term capital expenditures are dominated by Diablo Canyon and its hydroelectric system." [...] Operations and Maintenance (O&M) expenses are expected to rise especially with new regulations in place after the Fukushima accident. PG&E uses less natural gas than its competitors and is expected [...] "to experience slower price growth rates" [...] particularly if there are high <b>emission</b> <b>allowance</b> prices.|$|E

This study examines two methods of CO 2 emission reduction—CO 2 <b>emission</b> <b>allowance</b> and an international agreement—by applying the Zero Sum Gains Model and the Cooperation and Alliance Model.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the valuation implications {{of greenhouse gas}} (GHG) <b>emissions</b> <b>allowances.</b> We posit {{that the value of}} a firm's bank of <b>emission</b> <b>allowances</b> has two components that are likely to be positively valued by the capital market: (1) an asset value component; and (2) a real option value component. Since the necessary data to examine this research hypothesis in the setting of GHG <b>emission</b> <b>allowances</b> is not yet available, we test our conjecture by examining the value relevance of sulfur dioxide (SO 2) <b>emission</b> <b>allowances</b> held by US electric utilities. Empirical results reveal that the capital market assigns a positive price to a firm's bank of SO 2 <b>emission</b> <b>allowances,</b> consistent with the argument that <b>emission</b> <b>allowances</b> have, at least, an asset value component that is assigned a positive price by the market. We also find weak evidence consistent with the market assigning a real option value to the allowance banks. ...|$|R

This paper presents {{an analysis of}} the scientific literature on how effort-sharing approaches affect <b>emission</b> <b>allowances</b> and abatement costs of China and India. We find that reductions for both China and India differ greatly in time, across- and within approaches and between concentration stabilisation targets. For China, allocated <b>emission</b> <b>allowances</b> in 2020 are substantially below baseline projections. Moreover, they may be below 2005 emission levels, particularly for low concentration targets (below 490 ppm CO 2 -eq). Effort-sharing approaches based on allocating reduction targets lead to relatively lower reductions for China than approaches that are based on allocating <b>emission</b> <b>allowances.</b> For 2050, <b>emission</b> <b>allowances</b> for China are 50 - 80 % below 2005 levels for low concentration targets with minor differences between approaches. Still, mitigation costs of China (including emissions trading) remain mostly below global average. According to literature, Chinese <b>emission</b> <b>allowances</b> peak before 2025 - 2030 for low concentration targets. India's <b>emission</b> <b>allowances</b> show high increases compared to 2005 levels. If emission trading is allowed, financial revenues from selling credits might compensate mitigation costs in most approaches, even for low concentration targets.

40|$|Since the 1990 s, {{governmental}} agencies have increasingly turned to market based {{cap and trade}} programs to control the emission of pollutants. Firms subject to cap and trade regulation are typically required to acquire <b>emissions</b> <b>allowances</b> via open auction markets. The cost to acquire allowances may impose a substantial financial burden on a firm. While emissions reduction efforts may eliminate some firm 2 ̆ 7 s need to acquire additional allowances, there are still numerous firms that need to purchase additional allowances on the open market. This study presents a new forward buying heuristic, designed for those firms that need to purchase <b>emissions</b> <b>allowances</b> via auctions, which reduces the impact of <b>emissions</b> <b>allowance</b> acquisitions on the firms 2 ̆ 7 financial performance. The heuristic, designated as the Newsvendor Production Planning with <b>Emissions</b> <b>Allowance</b> Forward Buying (NPPAFB) method, applies a forward buying algorithm {{to determine the number}} of periods for which to forward buy allowances, the current production order up to level, and the current and future <b>emissions</b> <b>allowance</b> requirements (which serves as the order up to level for allowance purchases). Additionally, NPPAFB also authorizes unused <b>emissions</b> <b>allowances</b> to be sold when market conditions are favorable. Compared against three existing production planning and allowance procurement strategies, a simulation exercise finds that the NPPAFB method significantly reduces a firm 2 ̆ 7 s <b>emissions</b> <b>allowance</b> expenditures.

40|$|Equity is an {{essential}} issue to consider in <b>emission</b> <b>allowance</b> allocation problems to ensure the participation of as many market participants as possible. Various equity principles have been practiced in <b>emission</b> <b>allowance</b> allocations, {{and some of them}} conflict. The main purpose of this work is to present an <b>emission</b> <b>allowance</b> allocation methodology that takes into account both individual interests and different versions of equity and makes progress toward reaching a global consensus for <b>emission</b> <b>allowance</b> allocation in deregulated power systems. We propose nine equity principles for <b>emission</b> <b>allowance</b> allocation. We combine a hierarchical system with a voting mechanism to incorporate various definitions of equity and to find a compromise solution. The voting mechanism is used for selecting equity principles for each power plant (market participant). The hierarchical system is composed of two subsystems. The upper level subsystem computes the emission allowances among all regions, while the lower level subsystem obtains the emission allowances among the power plants in each region. A test power system serves to illustrate the essential features of the proposed methodology, and the results are used to investigate the choice of equity principles of different types of power plants located in different regions.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} a production model involving a manufacturer that uses two different technologies, the green {{technology and the}} standard technology. The green product produced by the green technology {{can be used as}} a substitute for the traditional product produced by the standard technology, but not vice versa. Three models are considered. The first model concerns with product substitution only and serves as a benchmark model for the next two models, the carbon <b>emission</b> <b>allowance</b> model and the carbon emission trading model. The second model extends the product substitution model by imposing an upper limit on the total carbon <b>emission</b> <b>allowance</b> for each firm. The third model extends the second model to cater for carbon emission trading. For the carbon <b>emission</b> <b>allowance</b> model, analytical result shows that the optimal production quantity of any product depends on both its total carbon <b>emission</b> <b>allowance</b> quota and its unit carbon emission profit, and the effect of substitution improves the service level, the expected profit of the manufacturer, and the green of product mix. For the carbon emission trading model, analytical result shows that whenever the production quantity of any product is optimal, the marginal profit of production (i. e. the additional profit obtained by producing an extra item) should be equal to the unit price of carbon emission trading within the market. Moreover, the optimal policy of either model reduces the total amount of carbon emission, thus producing less pollution to the environment. Lastly, the optimal profits obtained by using the carbon emission trading model are larger than the corresponding optimal profits obtained by using the carbon <b>emission</b> <b>allowance</b> model.

40|$|Many {{countries}} and scholars have used various strategies {{to improve and}} optimize the allocation ratios for carbon emission allowances. This issue is more urgent for China due to the uneven development across the country. This paper proposes a new method that divides low-carbon economy development processes into two separate periods: from 2020 to 2029 and from 2030 to 2050. These two periods have unique requirements and emissions reduction potential; therefore, they must involve different allocation methods, so that reduction behaviors do not stall the development of regional low-carbon economies. During the first period, a more deterministic economic development approach for the carbon <b>emission</b> <b>allowance</b> allocation ratio should be used. During the second period, more adaptive and optimized policy guidance should be employed. We developed a low-carbon economy index evaluation system using the entropy weight method to measure information filtering levels. We conducted vector autoregressive correlation tests, consulted 60 experts for the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process, and we conducted max-min standardized data processing tests. This article presents first- and second-period carbon <b>emission</b> <b>allowance</b> models in combination with a low-carbon economy index evaluation system. Finally, we forecast reasonable carbon <b>emission</b> <b>allowance</b> allocation ratios for China for the periods starting in 2020 and 2030. A good allocation ratio for the carbon <b>emission</b> <b>allowance</b> can help boost China’s economic development and help the country reach its energy conservation and emissions reduction goals...|$|E

Based on secondary data, I used a binomial real option’s model that I programmed with Microsoft Visual Basic 6. 5. The principal conclusion was that the present value is only slightly affected by an increase in the price of emissions (3. 8 % reduction in PV in the highest price scenario), but much more so by the removal of free <b>emission</b> <b>allowances</b> (34 % reduction in PV).

Different copulas are applied in order to model the complex dependence structure between the return series of carbon <b>emission</b> <b>allowance</b> prices and those of various commodities {{as well as other}} financial series. As suggested in the literature, the use of correlation as the only measure of dependence can lead to an underestimation of the risk of joint extreme price movements. What is more, copula models represent a more flexible method for deriving the nature of dependence and provide an appropriate fit also for the tails of multivariate distributions. The findings suggest that {{the relationship between}} EU <b>emission</b> <b>allowance</b> (EUA) future returns and those of the other commodities- in particular gas and oil markets- is relatively weak. However, we find some dependence between EUA futures and equity or energy index returns.

40|$|The {{electricity}} generation sector in Korea is {{under pressure to}} mitigate greenhouse gases as directed by the Kyoto Protocol. The principal compliance options for power companies under the cap-and-trade include the application of direct CO 2 emission abatement and the procurement of emission allowances. The objective {{of this paper is}} to provide an analytical framework for assessing the cost-effectiveness of these options. We attempt to derive the marginal abatement cost for CO 2 using the output distance function and analyze the relative advantages of <b>emission</b> <b>allowance</b> procurement option as compared to direct abatement option. Real-option approach is adopted to incorporate <b>emission</b> <b>allowance</b> price uncertainty. Empirical result shows the marginal abatement cost with an average of [euro] 14. 04 /ton CO 2 for fossil-fueled power plants and confirms the existence of substantial cost heterogeneity among plants which is sufficient to achieve trading gains in allowance market. The comparison of two options enables us to identify the optimal position of the compliance for each plant. Sensitivity analyses are also presented with regard to several key parameters including the initial allowance prices and interest rate.
