500|$|Several factors {{served to}} {{restrain}} Tirpitzs <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> in Norway. The most pressing were shortages {{of fuel and}} {{the withdrawal of the}} German destroyer forces to support Operation Cerberus, the movement of the battleships [...] and [...] and the heavy cruiser [...] up through the English Channel. These caused a planned attack against the outbound convoy PQ 8 at the end of January to be abandoned. A planned British air attack at the end of January by four-engined heavy bombers was disrupted by poor weather over the target, which prevented the aircraft from finding the ship. In early February, Tirpitz took part in the deceptions that distracted the British in the run-up to Operation Cerberus. These included steaming out of the fjord and the appearance of preparations for a sortie into the North Sea.

5000|$|On {{the other}} hand, pearl diving was {{controlled}} by Sunni Arab tribesmen, who had their own estates, enjoyed {{a high level of}} autonomy and <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> within them, and were not directly taxed. Only few Baharnah were engaged in this occupation. The most powerful tribe was Al Dawasir who lived in Budaiya and Zallaq; they were wealthy, numerous and only second in power to Al Khalifa; they had 400 manpower, while the total manpower of Al Khalifa was 540. They had a pearling fleet and many divers. They were allied to other tribes residing in Eastern Arabia. When Al Dawasir migrated to Bahrain from central Arabia in 1845, they expelled the Baharnah living in the north west side of the island. In the years preceding administrative reforms, they had stopped paying the diving tax, which used to be [...] "small" [...] and paid in [...] "reduced form". Shaikh Isa [...] "was too nervous of Ibn Saud's intervention to insist on them".

50|$|Honolulu {{took part}} in bombardments of the southeastern part of Saipan Island in early June as the Navy and Marines leaped across the Pacific. While bombarding Guam in mid-June, Honolulu was {{deployed}} northwest to intercept the Japanese fleet.

She remained on station for three weeks, performing great service with her accurate gunfire, before returning to Purvis Bay on Florida Island in the Solomons on 18 August. Honolulu steamed out on 6 September to provide fire support for the landings in the Palau Islands, such as at Peleliu Island and Anguar, remaining in this area during September unopposed by the Japanese fleet.

40|$|Abstract This paper investigates {{motivations for}} {{patenting}} {{and their impact}} on companies ’ propensity to patent. Amongst the main findings, the strong importance of exclusion motives must be emphasized. Irrespective of the country, the industry or the characteristics of the company, patenting in order to prevent imitation is the main reason for patenting, and this motivation strongly affects the propensity to patent. The patent system still performs its traditional mission to a large extent. Another major finding is the important role played by defensive patenting: companies patent in order to preserve their <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> which, in turn, significantly impacts the propensity to patent. Finally, monetary motivations are found to be of particular interest to small, R&D intensive companies, especially in the biotechnology, pharmaceuticals and computers industries, but only US companies actively patent for this reason. Key words freedom to operate, licensing, motivation, propensity to patent...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} twenty years, there have been {{significant}} reforms in the Moroccan agricultural sector. In the early 1980 s, Moroccan agriculture, indeed the Moroccan economy, was highly regulated with important state interventions throughout the system. Sectoral adjustment in the industrial sector {{began in the early}} 1980 s and in agriculture in the late 1980 s. Morocco was an active participant in the GATT round of trade negotiations, and even hosted the signing of the agreement in Marrakech. In accordance with its GATT offer, Morocco converted its quantitative (licensing) import restrictions to tariffs. In 1996, a major reform was implementing in its agricultural tariff regime as well as domestic marketing regulations. Private importers and domestic traders gained substantial <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation.</b> In 1998, protection was reduced on maize. In 2000, the entire system of oilseed chain protection and subsidies of vegetable oils was reformed. In 2003, another tariff reform was implemented for cereals. In Morocco, as in most countries, the most sensitive sector is agriculture, and the most sensitive products are agricultural products. In Morocco 16 - 20 percent of GD...|$|E
40|$|The Companies Act, 1956 is the {{principal}} landmark legislation that governs companies in India. The Act prescribes provisions for protection {{of the interests of}} the investors, creditors and public at large {{but at the same time}} permits the management to utilize its resources for optimum results and prosperity. In the functioning of corporate sector, along with <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> of companies, protection of investors and shareholders are considered equally important. The Companies Act enables a statutory platform for essential Corporate Governance requirements essential for functioning of the companies with transparency and accountability, recognizing and protecting the interests of various stakeholders. In response to the changing business environment, the Companies Act, 1956 has been amended from time to time so as to provide more transparency in corporate governance and protect the interests of small investors, depositors and debenture holders, etc. Corporate Governance is the mechanisms by which the values, principles, policies and procedures of a corporation are inculcated and manifested. The Companies Act, 1956 has been amended from time to time in response to the demands of the corporate sector and sometimes to plug the holes detected by the administration in enforcing various provisions. The recent amendments constitute a good step towards improving corporate governance in this country...|$|E

50|$|In 1906, at {{the request}} of Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany, Roosevelt {{convinced}} France to attend an international conference to resolve the First Moroccan Crisis over the degree of influence of European powers in Morocco. France was positioning itself to dominate Morocco, which angered Germany. Germany was annoyed that it had no presence in North Africa, and hinted darkly that a failure to adjust the crisis might lead to war between Germany and France. The Sultan of Morocco was a weak figure who could not control his own cities. The conference was held in the city of Algeciras, Spain, and 13 nations attended. The American delegate was Henry White, who mediated between France and Germany. The main issue was control of the police forces in the Moroccan cities, and Germany, with a weak diplomatic delegation, found itself in a decided minority. Roosevelt secretly supported France and did not want Germany to gain a more powerful position in Morocco. Roosevelt cooperated closely with the French ambassador, while gaining from the Germans a promise that Roosevelt would have a decisive role. Agreement was reached on April 7, 1906, which slightly reduced French influence by reaffirming the independence of the Sultan and the economic independence and <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> <b>of</b> all European powers. Germany gained nothing of importance but was mollified and stopped threatening war.|$|R

40|$|Clustering is a {{well-known}} technique to improve the implementation of single register file VLIW processors. Many previous studies in clustering adhere to an intercluster communication means in the form <b>of</b> copy <b>operations.</b> This paper, however, identifies and evaluates five different inter-cluster communication models, including copy operations, dedicated issue slots, extended operands, extended results, and broadcasting. Our study reveals that these models {{have a major impact}} on performance and implementation of the clustered VLIW.
