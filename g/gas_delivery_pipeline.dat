The engine, of the aero-derivative type, is employed in a natural gas recompression plant. The paper deals, in its first part, with the reconstruction of the whole operating region of both the gas generator set and the power turbine including its matching with the centrifugal compressor for natural <b>gas</b> <b>delivery</b> in the <b>pipeline.</b> This phase also leads to an effective prediction of pollutant emission, with a chemical kinetics based sub-model.

40|$|Differential Evolution (DE), an {{evolutionary}} computation technique, is {{applied for the}} optimal design of gas transmission network in this study. The design of an efficient and economical network involves many parameters in a gas transmission system such as source of <b>gas,</b> <b>delivery</b> sites with <b>pipeline</b> segments and compressors, etc. In addition, there are many equality and inequality constraints to be satisfied making the problem highly complex. Hence an efficient strategy is needed in searching for the global optimum. DE has been successfully applied for this complex and highly non-linear problem. The results obtained are {{compared with those of}} nonlinear programming technique and branch and bound algorithm. DE is able to find an optimal solution satisfying all the constraints. The proposed strategy takes less computational time to converge when compared to the existing techniques without compromising with the accuracy of the parameter estimates. 1...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – Aims to {{show that}} {{material}} flow concepts developed and successfully applied to commercial products and services can form equally well the architectural infrastructure of effective healthcare delivery systems. Design/methodology/approach – The methodology {{is based on the}} “power of analogy” which demonstrates that healthcare pipelines may be classified via the Time-Space Matrix. Findings – A small number (circa 4) of substantially different healthcare <b>delivery</b> <b>pipelines</b> will cover the vast majority of patient needs and simultaneously create adequate added value from their perspective. Research limitations/implications – The emphasis is firmly placed on total process mapping and analysis via established identification techniques. Healthcare <b>delivery</b> <b>pipelines</b> must be properly engineered and matched to life cycle phase if the service is to be effective. Practical implications – This small family of healthcare <b>delivery</b> <b>pipelines</b> needs to be designed via adherence to very specific-to-purpose principles. These vary from “lean production” through to “agile delivery”. Originality/value – The proposition for a strategic approach to healthcare <b>delivery</b> <b>pipeline</b> design is novel and positions much currently isolated research into a comprehensive organisational framework. It therefore provides a synthesis of the needs of global healthcare...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Atomic layer {{deposition}} (ALD) is a {{very attractive}} ultra-thin film deposition technique. With the feature size of IC industry continues going down, ALD has received more and more attentions for its accurate sub-nanometer thickness control as well as superior uniformity and conformality. The further development of ALD technology emphasizes on both process and equipment innovations. A single-wafer bottom-heated reactor is constructed successfully, and the Al 2 O 3 is deposited with ~ 2 % uniformity across a 4 -inch wafer. Furthermore, the <b>gas</b> <b>delivery</b> system and heating devices are studied by the combination of ANSYS simulation and experiments. These parameters that influence the uniformity and conformality of deposited films have been further optimized to obtain better performance. As a result, a new reactor with showerhead <b>gas</b> <b>delivery</b> and radiation heating system is designed. 1...|$|R
