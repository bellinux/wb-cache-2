5|$|In {{permafrost}} soils with {{an active}} upper layer subject to annual <b>freeze</b> <b>and</b> thaw, patterned ground can form, creating circles, nets, ice wedge polygons, steps, and stripes. Thermal contraction causes shrinkage cracks to form; in a thaw, water fills the cracks, expanding to form ice when next frozen, and widening the cracks into wedges. These cracks may join up to form polygons and other shapes.|$|E

5|$|A {{snowflake}} is {{a single}} ice crystal that has achieved a sufficient size, and may have amalgamated with others, then falls through the Earth's atmosphere as snow. Each flake nucleates around a dust particle in supersaturated air masses by attracting supercooled cloud water droplets, which <b>freeze</b> <b>and</b> accrete in crystal form. Complex shapes emerge as the flake moves through differing temperature and humidity zones in the atmosphere, such that individual snowflakes differ in detail from one another, but may be categorized in eight broad classifications and at least 80 individual variants. The main constituent shapes for ice crystals, from which combinations may occur, are needle, column, plate and rime. Snowflakes appear white in color despite being made of clear ice. This is due to diffuse reflection of the whole spectrum of light by the small crystal facets.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, rapid <b>freezing</b> <b>and</b> thawing test of air-entrained fly–ash {{concrete}} {{was carried}} out. Gas adsorption of concrete pores, mass loss, dynamic elastic modulus, and chloride diffusion coefficient of concrete after different <b>freezing</b> <b>and</b> thawing cycles was tested; scanning electron image {{was used to}} study the microscopic pore structure of the specimens. Results show that after certain <b>freezing</b> <b>and</b> thawing cycles, microscopic pores of the sample had a brittle failure, which results in sudden changes of cumulative desorption pore volume and cumulative desorption surface area obtained by Barrett, Joyner, and Halenda method. It {{was found that the}} variation of maximum cumulative desorption surface area is in good agreement with that of mass loss rate and chloride diffusion coefficient. At different stages of <b>freezing</b> <b>and</b> thawing, rate of mass loss shows a linear relationship with maximum cumulative desorption pore volume and maximum cumulative desorption surface area. In the range of <b>freezing</b> <b>and</b> thawing cycle between 0 and 150, chloride diffusion coefficient demonstrates a linear relationship with maximum cumulative desorption pore volume and maximum cumulative desorption surface area; in the range of <b>freezing</b> <b>and</b> thawing cycle between 200 and 300, this relationship becomes nonlinear...|$|R
5|$|Bernardo Grinspun, {{the first}} {{minister}} of the economy, arranged an increase in wages, reaching the levels of 1975. This caused inflation to reach 32%. He also tried to negotiate more favourable terms on the country's foreign debt, but the negotiations failed. Risking a default, he negotiated with the IMF, which requested spending cuts. International credits prevented default {{at the end of}} 1984, but he resigned in March 1985 when the debt reached $1billion and the IMF denied further credits. Grinspun was succeeded by Juan Vital Sourrouille, who designed the Austral plan. This plan froze prices and wages, stopped the printing of money, arranged spending cuts, and established a new currency, the Austral. The plan was a success in the short term, and choked inflation. Inflation rose again {{by the end of the}} year, the CGT opposed the wage <b>freeze,</b> <b>and</b> business community opposed the price freeze. Alfonsín thought that the privatization of some state assets and a deregulation of the economy might work, but those proposals were opposed by both the PJ and his own party.|$|E

5|$|The {{ultimate}} {{fate of the}} Universe {{is still}} unknown, because it depends critically on the curvature index k and the cosmological constant Λ. If the Universe were sufficiently dense, k would equal +1, meaning that its average curvature throughout is positive and the Universe will eventually recollapse in a Big Crunch, possibly starting a new Universe in a Big Bounce. Conversely, if the Universe were insufficiently dense, k would equal 0 or −1 and the Universe would expand forever, cooling off and eventually reaching the Big <b>Freeze</b> <b>and</b> the heat death of the Universe. Modern data suggests {{that the rate of}} expansion of the Universe is not decreasing, as originally expected, but increasing; if this continues indefinitely, the Universe may eventually reach a Big Rip. Observationally, the Universe appears to be flat (k = 0), with an overall density that is very close to the critical value between recollapse and eternal expansion.|$|E

30|$|There {{are many}} tests {{that can be}} used to {{determine}} the frost resistance of UHPC. How many cycles of <b>freezing</b> <b>and</b> thawing should be performed to consider it resistant to <b>freezing</b> <b>and</b> thawing remains an open question. ASTM C  666 recommends procedure A (<b>freezing</b> <b>and</b> thawing in water) or procedure B (<b>freezing</b> in air <b>and</b> thawing in water) to determine freeze–thaw resistance.

Meanwhile Batman and Freeze begin to fight each other, with Batman defeating Freeze. Batgirl and Robin manage to unfreeze Gotham; and Batman shows Freeze a recording of Ivy during her fight with Batgirl. Freeze learns that Ivy has betrayed him over the death of wife. Ivy blamed Batman for Nora's death, but she informs Batgirl that it was her idea. Freeze is angered by the betrayal and is informed by Batman that his wife is not dead; she is restored in cryogenic slumber and has been moved to Arkham waiting for him to finish his research. Batman proceeds to ask Freeze for the cure Freeze has created for the first stage of MacGregor's Syndrome to administer to Alfred. Freeze atones for his misunderstanding by giving him medicine he had developed. Ivy is detained in Arkham alongside Freeze, who promises to torment Ivy during their sentence. After Alfred is cured, everyone agrees to let Barbara stay at Wayne Manor.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy easily {{defeated}} Republican businessman Ray Shamie to win {{re-election in}} 1982. Senate leaders granted him {{a seat on}} the Armed Services Committee, while allowing him to keep his other major seats despite the traditional limit of two such seats. Kennedy became very visible in opposing aspects of the foreign policy of the Reagan administration, including U.S. intervention in the Salvadoran Civil War and U.S. support for the Contras in Nicaragua, and in opposing Reagan-supported weapons systems, including the B-1 bomber, the MX missile, and the Strategic Defense Initiative. Kennedy became the Senate's leading advocate for a nuclear <b>freeze</b> <b>and</b> was a critic of Reagan's confrontational policies toward the Soviet Union. A 1983 memorandum from KGB chairman Viktor Chebrikov to general secretary Yuri Andropov noted this stance and asserted that Kennedy, through former Senator John Tunney's discussions with Soviet contacts, had suggested that U.S.-Soviet relations might be improved if Kennedy and Andropov could meet in person to discuss arms control issues and if top Soviet officials, via Kennedy's help, were able to address the American public through the U.S. news media. Andropov was unimpressed by the idea.|$|E
