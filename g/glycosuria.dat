25|$|The Scottish {{military}} surgeon, John Rollo, published Notes of a Diabetic Case in 1797. It {{described the}} benefits of a meat diet for those suffering from diabetes, basing this recommendation on Matthew Dobson's discovery of <b>glycosuria</b> in diabetes mellitus. By means of Dobson's testing procedure (for glucose in the urine) Rollo worked out a diet that had success for what is now called type 2 diabetes.|$|E
25|$|Phodopus {{species have}} {{developed}} into important laboratory organisms. They provide an excellent model {{system for the}} evolution of hormonal control of photoperiod and seasonal physiological and behavioral changes, sociality, biparental offspring care, and behavioral ecology. Because Phodopus species have small chromosome numbers with easily distinguished chromosomes, they have been used for cytogenetic and cancer research. Because of their extreme cold tolerance, they have been used to study thermoregulation. One population of laboratory animals developed both <b>glycosuria</b> and ketonuria independently and {{has been used as a}} model for diabetes mellitus.|$|E
25|$|Proximal RTA (pRTA) {{is caused}} by a failure of the {{proximal}} tubular cells to reabsorb filtered bicarbonate from the urine, leading to urinary bicarbonate wasting and subsequent acidemia. The distal intercalated cells function normally, so the acidemia is less severe than dRTA and the alpha intercalated cells can produce H+ to acidify the urine to a pH of less than 5.3. pRTA also has several causes, and may occasionally be present as a solitary defect, but is usually associated with a more generalized dysfunction of the proximal tubular cells called Fanconi syndrome, in which there is also phosphaturia, <b>glycosuria,</b> aminoaciduria, uricosuria, and tubular proteinuria.|$|E
25|$|Since the glucose that {{normally}} enters the cells {{is unable to}} do so without insulin, it begins to build up in the blood where it can be seen as hyperglycemia or high blood glucose levels. The tubules of the kidneys are normally able to re-absorb glucose, but they are unable to handle and process the amount of glucose they are being presented with. At this point, which is called the renal threshold, the excess glucose spills into the urine (<b>glycosuria),</b> where it can be seen in urine glucose testing. It is the polyuria, or over-frequent urination, which causes polydipsia, or excessive water consumption, through an osmotic process. Even though there is an overabundance of glucose, the lack of insulin does not allow it to enter the cells. As a result, they are not able to receive nourishment from their normal glucose source. The body begins using fat for this purpose, causing weight loss; the process {{is similar to that of}} starvation.|$|E
2500|$|... "Insipidus" [...] {{comes from}} Latin {{language}} insipidus (tasteless), from Latin: in- [...] "not" [...] + sapidus [...] "tasty" [...] from sapere [...] "have a taste" [...] — the full meaning is [...] "lacking flavor or zest; not tasty". Application of this name to DI arose from [...] {{the fact that}} diabetes insipidus does not cause <b>glycosuria</b> (excretion of glucose into the urine).|$|E
2500|$|He {{coined the}} term {{mellitus}} in diabetes mellitus. An old name for the condition is [...] "Willis's disease". He observed what had been known for many centuries elsewhere, that the urine is sweet in patients (<b>glycosuria).</b> His observations on diabetes formed a chapter of Pharmaceutice rationalis (1674). Further research came from Johann Conrad Brunner, who had met Willis in London.|$|E
2500|$|When the glucose {{concentration}} in the blood remains high over time, the kidneys will reach a threshold of reabsorption, and glucose will be excreted in the urine (<b>glycosuria).</b> [...] This increases the osmotic pressure of the urine and inhibits reabsorption of water by the kidney, resulting in increased urine production (polyuria) and increased fluid loss. Lost blood volume will be replaced osmotically from water held in body cells and other body compartments, causing dehydration and increased thirst (polydipsia).|$|E
2500|$|The word [...] ( [...] or [...] ) {{comes from}} the {{classical}} Latin word mellītus, meaning [...] "mellite" [...] (i.e. sweetened with honey; honey-sweet). The Latin word comes from mell-, which comes from mel, meaning [...] "honey"; sweetness; pleasant thing, and the suffix -ītus, whose meaning {{is the same as}} that of the English suffix [...] "-ite". It was Thomas Willis who in 1675 added [...] "mellitus" [...] to the word [...] "diabetes" [...] as a designation for the disease, when he noticed the urine of a diabetic had a sweet taste [...] (<b>glycosuria).</b> This sweet taste had been noticed in urine by the ancient Greeks, Chinese, Egyptians, Indians, and Persians.|$|E
2500|$|On January 11, 1922, Leonard Thompson, a 14-year-old {{diabetic}} who {{lay dying}} at the Toronto General Hospital, {{was given the}} first injection of insulin. However, the extract was so impure, Thompson suffered a severe allergic reaction, and further injections were canceled. Over the next 12days, Collip worked day and night to improve the ox-pancreas extract, and a second dose was injected on January 23. This was completely successful, not only in having no obvious side-effects but also in completely eliminating the <b>glycosuria</b> sign of diabetes. The first American patient was Elizabeth Hughes Gossett, the daughter of U.S. Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes. [...] The first patient treated in the U.S. was future woodcut artist James D. Havens; Dr. John Ralston Williams imported insulin from Toronto to Rochester, New York, to treat Havens.|$|E
50|$|<b>Glycosuria</b> or glucosuria is the {{excretion}} of glucose {{into the}} urine. Ordinarily, urine contains no glucose because the kidneys {{are able to}} reabsorb all of the filtered glucose from the tubular fluid back into the bloodstream. <b>Glycosuria</b> is nearly always caused by elevated blood glucose levels, most commonly due to untreated diabetes mellitus. Rarely, <b>glycosuria</b> is due to an intrinsic problem with glucose reabsorption within the kidneys (such as Fanconi syndrome), producing a condition termed renal <b>glycosuria.</b> <b>Glycosuria</b> leads to excessive water loss into the urine with resultant dehydration, a process called osmotic diuresis.|$|E

50|$|Late in the 19th century, {{sugar in}} the urine (<b>glycosuria)</b> was {{associated}} with diabetes. Various doctors studied the connection. Frederick Madison Allen studied diabetes in 1909-12, then published a large volume, Studies Concerning <b>Glycosuria</b> and Diabetes, (Boston, 1913). He invented a fasting treatment for diabetes called the Allen treatment for diabetes. His diet was an early attempt at managing diabetes.|$|E

50|$|<b>Glycosuria</b> is not {{necessary}} for mild impaired glucose tolerance (e.g. at approx 140-180 mg/dL range of blood glucose), is necessary for oxyhyperglycemia (i.e. peak >renal threshold).|$|E
50|$|Laboratory tests {{may show}} an {{increase}} in alanine transaminase (ALT), hematuria, <b>glycosuria,</b> and {{an increase in}} lipase. Periodic monitoring of hepatic function and hematology are recommended.|$|E
50|$|Renal <b>glycosuria,</b> {{also known}} as renal glucosuria, is a rare {{condition}} in which the simple sugar glucose is excreted in the urine despite normal or low blood glucose levels. With normal kidney (renal) function, glucose is excreted in the urine only when there are abnormally elevated levels of glucose in the blood. However, in those with renal <b>glycosuria,</b> glucose is abnormally elevated in the urine due to improper functioning of the renal tubules, which are primary components of nephrons, the filtering units of the kidneys.|$|E
5000|$|Excessive {{losses of}} water from the urinary tract, which may be caused by <b>glycosuria,</b> or other osmotic diuretics - leads to a {{combination}} of sodium and free water losses.|$|E
50|$|A doctor {{normally}} can diagnose renal <b>glycosuria</b> when {{a routine}} urine test (Urinalysis) detects glucose in the urine, while {{a blood test}} indicates that the blood glucose level is normal.|$|E

50|$|If renal <b>glycosuria</b> (sugar {{excreted}} in {{the urine}} despite normal levels in the blood) is suspected, urine samples may also be collected for testing along with the fasting and 2 hour blood tests.|$|E
50|$|Pigs {{are likely}} to consume {{citrinin}} from the feed. It is observed that after administration of 20 and 40 mg citrinin/kg bodyweight, pigs suffer from growth depression, weight loss and <b>glycosuria</b> and decreasing β-globulin after 3 days.|$|E
50|$|Alimentary <b>glycosuria</b> is a {{temporary}} condition, when a high amount of carbohydrate is taken, it is rapidly absorbed in some cases where {{a part of the}} stomach is surgically removed, the excessive glucose appears in urine producing glucosuria.|$|E
50|$|In most {{affected}} individuals, the condition causes no apparent symptoms (asymptomatic) or serious effects. When renal <b>glycosuria</b> occurs as an isolated finding with otherwise normal kidney function, {{the condition is}} thought to be inherited as an autosomal recessive trait.|$|E
50|$|Non-obese {{diabetic}} or NOD mice, {{like the}} Biobreeding rat, {{are used as}} an animal model for type 1 diabetes. Diabetes develops in NOD mice {{as a result of}} insulitis, a leukocytic infiltrate of the pancreatic islets. Onset of diabetes is associated with a moderate <b>glycosuria</b> and a non-fasting hyperglycemia. It is recommended to monitor for development of <b>glycosuria</b> from 10 weeks of age; this can be carried out using urine glucose dipsticks. NOD mice will develop spontaneous diabetes when left in a sterile environment. The incidence of spontaneous diabetes in the NOD mouse is 60-80% in females and 20-30% in males. Onset of diabetes also varies between males and females: commonly, onset is delayed in males by several weeks.|$|E
5000|$|Dastre {{specialized}} {{in the field}} of physiological chemistry. He is remembered for his studies of <b>glycosuria</b> and diabetes, as well as for his investigations involving the proteolytic properties of blood. In 1893, he introduced the term [...] "fibrinolysis", to define a process involving the spontaneous dissolution of blood clots.|$|E
50|$|There {{has been}} {{long history of}} dietary {{treatment}} of diabetes mellitus. Dietary treatment of diabetes mellitus was used in Egypt since 3,500 B.C. and was used in India by Sushruta and Charaka more than 2000 years ago. In the 18th century, John Rollo argued that calorie restriction could reduce <b>glycosuria</b> in diabetes.|$|E

50|$|Urine sample or {{urinalysis}} {{can reveal}} {{the presence of}} proteinuria (protein in the urine), a possible indicator of infection or kidney disease, or the presence of blood which can indicate a urinary tract infection. Urinalysis might also show the presence of glucose (<b>glycosuria),</b> but women of child bearing age are unlikely to have undiagnosed diabetes (this is separate from gestational diabetes that may occasionally develop {{during the course of}} a subsequent pregnancy).|$|E
50|$|Bouchardat {{is often}} {{credited}} as {{the founder of}} diabetology, and was a major figure involving dietetic therapy for treatment of diabetes prior to the advent of insulin therapy. He recognized that fasting was a method to reduce <b>glycosuria,</b> and speculated that the principal cause of diabetes was located in the pancreas. In {{the treatment of the}} disease, he stressed the importance of exercise, and developed a procedure for self-testing urine to determine the presence of glucose.|$|E
50|$|Systemic {{absorption}} of topical corticosteroids can produce adverse effects. Indication of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and <b>glycosuria</b> {{have been observed}} in some patients receiving treatment. After stopping treatment, reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression {{with the potential for}} glucocorticosteroid insufficiency is possible. The cosyntropin (ACTH1-24) laboratory test can evaluate patients for HPA axis suppression. HPA function can be reversed after the cessation of treatment or replacement with another less potent corticosteroid. If glucocorticosteroid insufficiency occurs, supplemental systemic corticosteroids may be required.|$|E
