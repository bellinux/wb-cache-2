40|$|We have {{developed}} an interface which allows to perform rigorous electromagnetic field (EMF) simulations with the simulator JCMsuite and subsequent aerial imaging and resist simulations with the simulator Dr. LiTHO. With the combined tools we investigate the convergence of near-field and far-field results for different <b>DUV</b> <b>masks.</b> We also benchmark results obtained with the waveguide-method EMF solver included in Dr. LiTHO and with the finite-element-method EMF solver JCMsuite. We demonstrate results on convergence for dense and isolated hole arrays, for masks including diagonal structures, and for a large 3 D mask pattern of lateral size 10 microns by 10 microns.

40|$|This master’s project report {{deals with}} the process {{development}} for patterning thesub-micron features using Deep-UV photolithography. Patterning of the sub-micronstructures in the resists UV 26 and ZEP 520 A- 7 has been demonstrated successfully. Using theKarl Süss-MJB 4 <b>DUV</b> <b>mask</b> aligner, trenches of width down to 535 nm have been obtained. Good results have been obtained in these experiments considering the development time andthe exposure time, which {{are found to be}} shorter compared to previously published results. This provides a faster process and higher throughput. Experimental steps along with thefurther improvement areas are discussed. Equipment used include a Karl Süss-MJB 4 <b>DUV</b> <b>mask</b> aligner, an optical microscope anda Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) ...|$|R
40|$|Analog Spatial Light Modulators (ASLM) {{are highly}} {{specialised}} MOEMS devices, which, in our case, {{are used as}} programmable mask in extremely high-resolution <b>DUV</b> <b>mask</b> writing systems. Resolution, precision, contrast and optical uniformity of the mask patterns produced by this new type of mask writers depend on the local and global planarity {{as well as on}} the optical contrast of the ASLM devices. Definition, measurement and calculation of the global flatness (GF) of the active area of one-mega pixel ASLM devices, developed and fabricated at the Fraunhofer IPMS in Dresden, is described and applied for the investigations of parameters influencing the chip planarity. Parameters of an adhesive chip bonding technique have been varied and optimised with respect to improved GF. In particular, the influence of the die bonding layers printed on the die attach was investigated. Additionally, an approach based on ultraprecision micro-milling of a sacrificial layer deposited on the die attaches to improve its planarity and thus the GF of the die-bonded chip has been successfully performed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} charging {{effects on}} spatial light modulators (SLM). These light modulators consist {{of up to}} one million mirrors that can be addressed individually and are operated at a frame rate of up to 2 kHz. They are used for <b>DUV</b> <b>mask</b> writing {{where they have to}} meet very high requirements with respect to accuracy. In order to be usable in a mask-writing tool, the chips {{have to be able to}} work under DUV light and maintain their performance with high accuracy over a long time. Charging effects are a problem frequently encountered with MEMS, especially when they are operated in an analog mode. In this paper, the issue of charging effects in SLMs used for microlithography, their causes and methods of their reduction or elimination, by means of addressing methods as well as technological changes, will be discussed. The first method deals with the way charges can accumulate within the actuator, it is a simple method that requires no technological changes but cannot always be implemented. The second involves the removal of the materials within the actuator where charges can accumulate...|$|R
40|$|The Fraunhofer Institute for Microelectronic Circuits and Systems (FhG-IMS) has {{developed}} spatial light modulators (SLM), {{which are used}} in a pattern generator for <b>DUV</b> laser <b>mask</b> writing developed by Micronic Laser Systems. They consist of micromirror arrays and allow massive parallel writing in UV mask writers. The chip discussed here consists of 2048 × 512 individually addressable mirrors and can be run at a frame rate of 1 to 2 kHz. For this application {{it is necessary that}} the SLMs can be operated under DUV light without changing their performance. This paper discusses a failure mechanism of the SLMs when operated in DUV light and countermeasures to eliminate this effect...|$|R
40|$|In <b>DUV</b> photolithography, <b>mask</b> {{patterns}} and processes are increasing in complexity, while IC critical dimensions continue to shrink {{at a rapid}} pace. As a result, the proportional variability of the process will increase to unacceptable levels unless a means of more advanced process control is introduced. Previously standard offline pilot-lot experiments now prove to be too costly and difficult. One attractive and potentially highly viable alternative is simulation-based advanced process control [1, 2]. The proposed control framework exploits scatterometry, which provides in-situ, full-profile metrol-ogy [3]. The major obstacle to implementing scatterometry in a process control setting is profile inversion—deriving estimated input conditions from the measured profile. In this work, a first-principle-based process simulator (PROLITH [4]) is used to simulate the lithography process and create a library of profile-to-input-conditions pairs. These profiles are then used to generate sim-ulated diffraction responses, resulting in a library of diffraction-response-to-input-conditions pairs. Finally, the empirically measured diffraction response will be matched to a simulated diffraction re-sponse in this library, whose accompanying set of input conditions should estimate the actual inpu...|$|R

Finally, the empirically measured diffraction response is matched to a simulated diffraction response in this library, allowing for estimation of actual process conditions. Preliminary, simulation-only results suggest that the framework {{has the potential to be}} successful even with limited library size, particularly if approximate values of some input conditions are provided by independent sensors...|$|R
