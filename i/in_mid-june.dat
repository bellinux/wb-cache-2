5|$|McKinley {{remained}} well ahead {{when the state}} conventions concluded, leaving his opponents' only hope the Republican National Committee (RNC), which would make initial rulings on which delegates would be seated; there were contested seats or rival delegations in several states, and rulings against McKinley could still deprive him of a first-ballot majority.

According to {{historian}} Antony Beevor, in contrast, Soviet aviation apparently succeeded in destroying more than 500 Luftwaffe aircraft on the ground. The Soviet deception efforts were {{so successful that}} German estimates issued <b>in</b> <b>mid-June</b> placed the total Soviet armoured strength at 1,500 tanks. The result {{was not only a}} vast underestimation of Soviet strength, but a misperception of Soviet strategic intentions.|$|E

For its part, Philadelphia was mainly engaged in a fierce division race with the Atlanta Braves, trailing them as late in the season as September 6. However, Philadelphia would surge at the end of the month and once again be crowned division champs. 2010 ultimately served as a disappointment for the Mets–Phillies rivalry.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>mid-June</b> 1941, the {{division}} received new orders to relocate. The 16th Panzer Division crossed the German–Polish border at Groß Wartenberg heading for Ożarów at the Vistula, which was reached on 19 June 1941. The German soldiers initially {{believed that they}} were just going to transit through Russia, {{on their way to the}} Middle East where they would link up with Erwin Rommel's Afrika Corps. But Generalfeldmarschall (Field Marshal) Walther von Reichenau, who visited his son, a Leutnant in the 4th company of Panzer-Regiment 2, revealed to them the true objective of the next campaign.

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>mid-June,</b> a broad {{cyclonic}} area of cloudiness persisted to {{the south}} of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. A low-level circulation and banding features became more prominent on June16, and further development was aided by the presence of a tropical wave that first departed the western coastline of Africa on June5. As extremely deep convection festered within a band west of the disturbance's center, it is estimated the first tropical depression of the season formed around 06:00UTC on June18, located about 260mi (420km) southeast of Acapulco, Mexico. The newly-formed cyclone tracked west-northwest parallel to the coastline, steered by a strong area of high pressure to its north and east.|$|E
