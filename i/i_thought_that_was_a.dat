And <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> foolish, wicked thing to say, because it put such an onus and such a responsibility onto me, which I simply wasn't able to carry. And it took me years to learn enough to live up to what they said for those first notices. I find it so stupid. I remember the critic very well and have never forgiven him." ...|$|E

She had been {{attracted}} to Pilobolus growing up: [...] "I was taller than most girls my age, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> company I could be with because the women were always lifting the men." [...] There she joined up with Daniel Ezralow, Jamey Hampton, and Ashley Roland, and the four created the Connecticut-based, dancer-illusionist company MOMIX. From 1983 to 1986, Steinberg toured nationally with MOMIX. The group became known for their visual humour, contorted positions, and Trompe-l'œil effects.|$|E
500|$|Gittings {{began to}} {{hitchhike}} on weekends to New York City, {{dressed as a}} man, to visit gay bars since she knew of none in Philadelphia, and knew of no other places to go to get [...] "plugged into the gay community." [...] In a 1975 interview, she recalled, [...] "I wore drag because <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> way to show I was gay. It's changed now, {{but in the early}} 50s there were basically two types of women in the gay bars: the so-called butch ones in short hair and plain masculine attire and the so-called femme ones in dresses and high heels and makeup. I knew high heels and makeup weren't my personal style, so I thought...I must be the other kind!" [...] However, Gittings found very little in common with the women she met in the bars, and after witnessing a gay male acquaintance get beaten up after leaving a bar, began to focus her energies on collecting books.|$|E

500|$|Kesha re-recorded [...] "Dirty Picture" [...] for {{her debut}} studio album, Animal. The song was {{selective}} in its release only being sold as an album bonus track in United Kingdom and Ireland, and was dubbed [...] "Kesha edit" [...] or [...] "Dirty Picture, Pt. 2". The song {{is similar to}} the original recording of the song with the only noticeable change being that Kesha now sings the song's first verse. While being interviewed by Digital Spy Cruz explained how the cover initially came about and his view on the cover, [...] "she asked me if she could do a version of the song where she sang the first verse and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> really cool idea. I really like both versions, and it's good that there are these two different versions out there, because fans of me get more of me on mine and [...] fans get more of her on hers." ...|$|E

[...] Nitin replies. [...] "I've got kids myself, and I know I'd react {{the same way}} if I found out that some other guy had taken my child to somebody's house who the child doesn't even know. Masood is still {{the only person who}} can see Yusef for what he really is, so he goes into a blind panic over the situation. Masood calls in the police, and they make sure that Kamil is safe, but we're left to wonder if he will stay that way. The police say that they can't get involved in domestic disputes, so Masood says, 'Well, what about the father's rights? If a mother reported this, you'd see it as kidnap'. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> great line and really interesting - I think in that moment, Masood's representing a lot of fathers who have separated or divorced and don't have access to their children in the same way." ...|$|E
500|$|One of {{the qualities}} of The Basement Tapes that sets it apart from {{contemporaneous}} works is its simple, down-to-earth sound. The songs were recorded in mid-1967, the [...] "Summer of Love" [...] that produced The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, their most technically elaborate album. In a 1978 interview, Dylan reflected on the period: [...] "I didn't know how to record the way other people were recording, and I didn't want to. The Beatles had just released Sgt. Pepper which I didn't like at all. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> very indulgent album, though the songs on it were real good. I didn't think all that production was necessary." [...] Of the sound and atmosphere of the basement recordings, Barney Hoskyns wrote that [...] "Big Pink itself determined {{the nature of this}} homemade brew." [...] "One of the things is that if you played loud in the basement, it was really annoying, because it was a cement-walled room", recalled Robertson. [...] "So we played in a little huddle: if you couldn't hear the singing, you were playing too loud." ...|$|E

2500|$|However, {{after the}} war, Hitchens scolded those within the US who had {{opposed the war}} by observing that [...] "the peace {{movement}} {{in this country in}} my opinion acted in a very narrow, isolationist, and almost chauvinistic way. It said that a war was more or less alright with it as long as it could be guaranteed in advance that American casualties could be kept low... <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> dishonourably narrow way of approaching the question. ... When large numbers of Iraqis were turned into soap...and many others, as we've since found out, were bulldozed and buried alive and in other ways done away with and people don't {{even want to think about}} the body count ...because they’re afraid of what they might find out." ...|$|E

60|$|At the time, however, I felt {{thoroughly}} exasperated. I {{was in a}} {{hurry to}} get on. Important business engagements would be unhinged by the delay. I was a stranger in Broughton. It looked like a stupid, stuffy little town. I went to a hotel in an atrocious humor. After I had fumed until I wanted a change, it occurred to me that I might as well hunt up Clark Oliver by way of passing the time. I had never been overly fond of Clark Oliver, although he was my cousin. He was a bit of a cad, and stupider than anyone belonging to our family had a right to be. Moreover, he was in politics, and I detest politics. But I rather wanted to see if he looked as much like me as he used to. I hadn't seen him for three years and I hoped that the time might have differentiated us to a saving degree. It was over a year since I had last been blown up by some unknown, excited individual on the ground that I was that scoundrel Oliver--politically speaking. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> good omen.|$|E

[...] "Should you have believed so?" [...] said I warmly; [...] "I am very sorry for that. Why, would you have taken me for an actress, or a French stage-player?" [...] "No," [...] says the good kind creature, [...] "thou carriest it too far; as soon as thou madest thy reflections upon her, I knew it could not be; but who could think any other when she described the Turkish dress which thou hast here, with the head-tire and jewels, and when she named thy maid Amy too, and several other circumstances concurring? I should certainly have believed it," [...] said she, [...] "if thou hadst not contradicted it; but as soon as I heard thee speak, I concluded it was otherwise."

[...] <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> very kind offer, but was at a loss how {{she would be able to}} do it; and the thought of seeing her there again half distracted me, not knowing what temper she would come in, much less what manner to receive her in; but my fast friend and constant comforter, the Quaker, said she perceived the girl was impertinent, and that I had no inclination to converse with her, and she was resolved I should not be troubled with her.
