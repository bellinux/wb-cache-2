5000|$|Sweden: Swedish-style cheesecake differs {{greatly from}} other cheesecakes. A Swedish cheesecake is not layered and is {{traditionally}} produced by adding rennet to milk {{and letting the}} casein coagulate. It is then baked in an oven and served warm.

40|$|This Master thesis called Comparison {{of methods}} for {{measuring}} milk coagulation {{deals with a}} major technological step {{in the production of}} cheese, which is the process <b>of</b> <b>curdling</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk.</b> Two methods for measuring this process were compared, particularly the visual and instrumental method utilizing nephelo-turbidimeter. Based on statistical data processing in three cases, a difference was observered between the average visual measurement and instrumental measurement of significant 99 %. Furthermore, the impacts on <b>curdling</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> were assessed what showed that the best default property for the process <b>of</b> <b>curdling</b> had a pasteurized milk sample with the addition of CaCl 2. On the basis of calculations in this thesis it has been concluded that to curdle a 100 l of milk with rennet CHY-MAX a 0, 2 liters of the rennet is required. The same amount <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> is <b>curdled</b> with 1 litre of rennet Lactochym. In assessing the economics of using rennet Lactochym and CHY-MAX it has been found that for cost optimization it is more appropriate to use rennet CHY-MAX with a strentgh of at least 190 IMCU/ml diluted in distilled water at a ratio of 1 : 5...|$|R
50|$|Shards {{of pottery}} pierced with holes found in pile-dwellings are {{hypothesized}} to be cheese-strainers. They {{are of the}} Urnfield culture on Lake Neuchatel and date back to 6,000 BC. The earliest evidence of cheese-making dates back to 5,500 BC in Kujawy, Poland. For preservation purposes, cheese-making may have begun by the pressing and salting <b>of</b> <b>curdled</b> <b>milk.</b> <b>Curdling</b> <b>milk</b> in an animal's stomach made solid and better-textured curds, leading to the addition of rennet. Dairying existed around 4,000 BC in the grasslands of the Sahara. Hard salted cheese {{is likely to have}} accompanied dairying from the outset. It is the only form in which milk can be kept in a hot climate. Animal skins and inflated internal organs provided storage vessels for a range of foodstuffs. Cheese produced in Europe, where climates are cooler than in the Middle East, required less salt for preservation. With less salt and acidity, the cheese became a suitable environment for useful microbes and molds, giving aged cheeses their pronounced and interesting flavors.|$|R
5000|$|A lack of fat often accompanies a lack {{of protein}}. A lack of protein in a South African's diet {{can lead to a}} form of severe {{malnutrition}} known as [...] "kwashiorkor." [...] Research was done to compare the frequency of kwashiorkor among five African groups: the Maasai, the Kikuyu, the Batussi, the Bahutu, the Pieraerts, and the Wakamba. The Masai are pastoral people who consume milk and on occasion, meat. The Wakamba, Kikuyu, and Bahutu are non-pastoral agricultural people who cultivate the foods that they eat. The Batussi people are livestock raisers who consume large amounts <b>of</b> <b>curdled</b> <b>milk.</b> The Pieraert people are lake-side dwellers who consume fresh fish and dried fish. The research found no incidences of kwashiorkor among the Masai, Batussi, the Pieraert, and {{a small part of the}} Bahutu who in addition to vegetables and grains, also cultivate beans.|$|R
50|$|Cheesemaking {{may have}} begun {{independently}} of this by the pressing and salting <b>of</b> <b>curdled</b> <b>milk</b> to preserve it. Observation {{that the effect of}} making cheese in an animal stomach gave more solid and better-textured curds may have led to the deliberate addition of rennet. Early archeological evidence of Egyptian cheese has been found in Egyptian tomb murals, dating to about 2000 BCE. The earliest cheeses were likely to have been quite sour and salty, similar in texture to rustic cottage cheese or feta, a crumbly, flavorful Greek cheese. Cheese produced in Europe, where climates are cooler than the Middle East, required less salt for preservation. With less salt and acidity, the cheese became a suitable environment for useful microbes and molds, giving aged cheeses their respective flavors. The earliest ever discovered preserved cheese was found in the Taklamakan Desert in Xinjiang, China, and it dates back as early as 1615 BCE.|$|R

40|$|During the 1984 cholera {{epidemic}} in Mali, 1793 cases and 406 deaths were reported, a death-to-case ratio of 23 %. In four affected villages, the mean {{clinical attack rate}} was 1. 5 and 29 % of affected persons died. In 66 % of cases the illness began more than 48 h after the village outbreak began, when supplies from outside the village were potentially available. Deaths occurred because patients failed to seek care or received only limited rehydration therapy when they did. Case-control studies identified two routes of transmission: drinking water from one well in a village outside the drought area, and eating left-over millet gruel in a drought-affected village. Drought-related scarcity <b>of</b> <b>curdled</b> <b>milk</b> may permit millet gruel to be a vehicle for cholera. Cholera mortality in the Sahel could be greatly reduced by rapid intervention in affected villages, wide distribution of effective rehydration materials, and educating the population to seek treatment quickly...|$|R

Every Eastern tribe and nation seemed to be represented in the motley crowd. Yonder stalked savages, naked except for their girdles, and armed with huge spears, who gazed with bewilderment on the wonders of this mart of the white man; there moved grave, long-bearded Arab merchants or Phoenicians in their pointed caps, or bare-headed white-robed Egyptians, or half-bred mercenaries clad in mail. Their variety was without end, while from them came a very babel of different tongues as they cried their wares, bargained and quarrelled.|$|R

During early morning, lamps in the cella are lit to awaken Lingaraja from his sleep, ablution is performed, followed by adoration and arati (waving of light). The temple is closed at about 12 noon until about 3.30 p.m. A ceremony known as Mahasnana (ablution) is performed once {{the doors are}} closed, followed by pouring of Panchamrita (a mixture <b>of</b> <b>milk,</b> <b>curdled</b> <b>milk,</b> clarified butter, honey and ghee) upon the deity for purification. At about 1:00 p.m., a ripe plantain is divided into two, one half is offered to Sun god {{and the other half}} to Dwarapala (the guarding deities in the doorway). Between 1 p.m. and 1:30 p.m. the food offering called Ballabha Bhoga (breakfast containing <b>curdled</b> <b>milk,</b> curd and vegetables) is offered to the deity. The consecrated food is carried to the temple of Parvati and placed before her as an offering, a practice commonly observed by the orthodox Hindu housewives. At about 2 p.m., the Sakala Dhupa (morning's offering of food) takes place. After the food is offered to Lingaraja, the offerings are carried to the temple of Parvati to serve her. An offering called Bhanda Dhupa is carried out at 3:30 p.m. at the hall of offering. This food is later offered by the inmates to the pilgrims as Mahaprasada.|$|R
50|$|The {{production}} of the cheese has to follow very rigorous rules. It is made from sheep's milk, mostly during the months of November to March. Its maturation period has specific norms and must last thirty days at least. The texture of the paste varies depending on its age, from a very soft semi-liquid when young, to a soft but sliceable solid when older. It is a cured cheese created by artisanal producers with a white or slightly yellow color and a uniform creamy consistency with at most a few small holes in it. Its particular qualities result from slow draining <b>of</b> <b>curdled</b> raw sheep's <b>milk</b> which has been coagulated by using local Cynara cadunculus thistle rather than rennet.|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Protection of {{traditional}} knowledge and traditional cultural expressions of indigenous communities {{is one of}} the most contentious and complicated issues on both international and national agendas. The historical development of the protection of intellectual property in the wake of the industrial revolution and its subsequent jurisprudential justification, based on private property rights, pushed TK and the practice based on it, outside the purview of the formal intellectual protection regime. There is substantial evidence that TK has in past decades been used in a range of industries and has accordingly led to new products as well as the development of existing products. Evidence of this can be found in the areas of special foods and beverages, the cosmetic sector, personal care, agriculture, horticulture and pharmaceuticals. Industries sometimes make use of this knowledge to formulate new products, which they do in a slightly different manner so as to market the products as their own. Currently, there are certain products in Namibia that use the traditional terms of products as trademarks. Despite the fact that some of these terms are not registered with the Ministry of Trade and Industries, these owners enjoy common law protection under trademark law. This is especially so for well-known products such as Omaere milk, which is a product of the Namibia Dairies (Pty) Ltd. The term Omaere is used by the OvaHerero and OvaHimba speaking communities of Namibia and Botswana to refer to traditionally processed <b>curdled</b> <b>milk.</b> The Namibian Dairies (Pty) Ltd has been making use of this name for one <b>of</b> their <b>curdled</b> <b>milk</b> products for more than 15 years.
