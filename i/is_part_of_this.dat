25|$|Christmas Island is {{well known}} for its {{biological}} diversity. There are many rare species of animals and plants on the island, making nature-walking a popular activity. Along with the diversity of species, many different types of caves exist, such as plateau caves, coastal caves, raised coastal caves and alcoves, sea caves, fissure caves, collapse caves and basalt caves; most of these are near the sea and have been formed by the action of water. Altogether, there are 46 caves on the island, with Lost Lake Cave, Daniel Roux Cave and Full Frontal Cave being the most well-known. The many freshwater springs include Hosnies Spring Ramsar, which also has a mangrove stand. The Dales is a rainforest {{in the western part of}} the island and consists of seven deep valleys, all of which were formed by spring streams. Hugh's Dale waterfall <b>is</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> area and is a popular attraction. The annual breeding migration of the red crabs is a popular event. Fishing is another common activity. There are many distinctive species of fish in the oceans surrounding Christmas Island. Snorkeling and swimming in the ocean are two other activities that are extremely popular. Walking trails are also very popular, for there are many beautiful trails surrounded by extravagant flora and fauna. 63% of the island is national park making it one of the main attractions to experience when visiting.|$|E

500|$|The Maya Sita motif is {{considered}} as the [...] "most important instance of an addition" [...] in the Ramayana. The Kurma Purana ( [...] 550–850 CE) {{is the first}} text where Maya Sita appears. The key event of the Ramayana story – the kidnapping of Sita by Ravana – was replaced with the abduction of Maya Sita (an unreal Sita) by Ravana; meanwhile Sita is protected in the refuge of Agni, the fire god. This [...] "important ideological development" [...] in Vaishnavism (Vishnu-centric sect) protected Sita's chastity. Some versions of the Ramayana {{such as the ones}} in the Mahabharata (5th to 4th century BCE), the Vishnu Purana (1st century BCE–4th century CE), the Harivamsa (1–300 CE) and several Puranas (the suffix Purana denotes that the text <b>is</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> genre) omit the Agni Pariksha altogether to avoid questioning Sita's purity. In contrast, this very Agni Pariksha became a device for the return of the unblemished Sita, as Sita and Maya Sita switch places again, in some later versions.|$|E

In 1730 he was apprenticed to his father, also named Peter, known in the records as Captain Lekeux from his rank in the Trained Band. After his father's death, the younger Peter became a master in the Flowered Silks branch of the Worshipful Company of Weavers and rose to the Company's highest office, upper bailiff, in July 1764.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{issues are}} water {{pollution}} from agricultural and animal runoff, and erosion. Water pollution is particularly critical in karsted regions such as this, {{in that it}} can degrade or destroy prime cold water fish habitat.

2500|$|One {{must then}} have P2ψ(r)=e'iφψ(r), since an overall phase is unobservable. The {{operator}} P2, which reverses the parity {{of a state}} twice, leaves the spacetime invariant, and so is an internal symmetry which rotates its eigenstates by phases e'iφ. [...] If P2 is an element e'iQ of a continuous U(1) symmetry group of phase rotations, then e−iQ/2 <b>is</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> U(1) and so is also a symmetry. [...] In particular, we can define P′=Pe−iQ/2, {{which is also a}} symmetry, and so we can choose to call P′ our parity operator, instead of P. [...] Note that P′2=1 and so P′ has eigenvalues ±1. [...] However, when no such symmetry group exists, it may be that all parity transformations have some eigenvalues which are phases other than ±1.|$|E

[...] Interrupted for a moment by the people, who take up the angels' words: [...] "Sanctus, sanctus, sanctus", etc., the priest goes on with the same prayer, obviously joining the next part to the beginning by the word [...] "igitur". It is not then surprising that we find in the oldest sacramentary that contains a Canon, the Gelasian, the heading [...] "Incipit Canon Actionis" [...] placed before the Sursum Corda; so that the preface was then still looked upon {{as part of the}} Canon.|$|E
