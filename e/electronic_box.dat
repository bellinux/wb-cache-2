500|$|After the race, it was {{announced}} that the FIA was investigating irregularities with an <b>electronic</b> <b>box</b> in Hakkinen's car. This was due to Formula One's governing body discovering that one mandatory seal was missing. Further samples from the <b>electronic</b> <b>box</b> were taken after the race; this was software downloaded which did not discover any issues with the coding. A spokesman for the McLaren team said that: [...] "No one changed the software, so there's no reason for us to be worried." [...] At the hearing on 25 July, the FIA ruled that McLaren did not gain an advantage from the missing seal and that Häkkinen's victory would stand. However, McLaren were deducted 10 points from the Constructors' Championship and fined $50,000 for contravening Article 7 of the 2000 Formula One Sporting Regulations, which stated that competitors had to maintain some conditions of safety and eligibility during the event. McLaren International managing director Martin Whitmarsh announced that the team would not appeal the penalty. The Vice-President of Mercedes-Benz Motorsport Norbert Haug later criticised the decision and believed that the seal was never put on Häkkinen's car. Haug also said he would not take any further action regarding the matter.|$|E

40|$|We {{report on}} the {{development}} of a heat switch for autonomous temperature control of electronic components in a satellite. A heat switch can modulate when needed between roles of a good thermal conductor and a good thermal insulator. Electronic boxes on a satellite should be maintained within a typical optimum temperature range of 260 to 310 K. The heat sinking is usually by means of a radiator. When the operating temperature of the <b>electronic</b> <b>box</b> increases beyond 310 K, a good contact to the radiator is desired for maximum cooling. On the other hand, when the satellite is in a cold dormant state, the electronics box should be heated by the onboard batteries. In this state a weak thermal contact is desired between the <b>electronic</b> <b>box</b> and the heat sink. In the present study, we are developing a gas gap heat switch in which the sorber material is thermally anchored to the <b>electronic</b> <b>box.</b> A temperature change of the <b>electronic</b> <b>box</b> triggers the (de-) sorption of gas from the sorber material and subsequently the gas pressure in the gas gap. This paper describes the physical principles and the current status of this technology. This approach can be extended to cryogenic temperature rang...|$|E

40|$|The {{previous}} {{haptic interface}} {{in the research}} lab was prohibitively expensive for distribution to a class of students and required a specialized Input/Output board. In order to solve these problems a new device was designed with the stipulations that its interface did not require an I/O board and that it have half {{the power of the}} previous device and cost less than $ 400 cdn. The resulting design is called the Twiddler. The Twiddler is a single degree of freedom rotary haptic device. An <b>electronic</b> <b>box</b> and an electric DC motor make up the Twiddler. The <b>electronic</b> <b>box</b> reads the current rotational position of the motor sends it to the host PC through the Parallel Port. The algorithm for the output force command {{as a function of the}} position is easily accessed and changed on the host PC to make prototyping and development simple. The host sends the command through the Parallel Port back to the <b>electronic</b> <b>box.</b> The command is converted to a motor driving signal and sent to the motor. This loop happens ever millisecond so that reliable haptic forces can be simulated on the rotational axis of the motor. The parts for the Twiddler cost approximately $ 400 and the peak torque output is approximately 0. 04 Nm (or six oz-in). The software, mechanical and electrical designs are freely available fo...|$|E
