40|$|BACKGROUND: Postoperative {{pancreatic}} <b>fistula</b> is one <b>of</b> {{the most}} common complications after pancreatectomy. This study aimed to assess the occurrence and severity <b>of</b> pancreatic <b>fistula</b> after central pancreatectomy. METHODS: The medical records of 13 patients who had undergone central pancreatectomy were retrospectively studied, together with a literature review of studies including at least five cases of central pancreatectomy. Pancreatic fistula was defined and graded according to {{the recommendations of the}} International Study Group on Pancreatic Fistula (ISGPF). RESULTS: No death was observed in the 13 patients. Pancreatic fistula developed in 7 patients and was successfully treated non-operatively. None of these patients required re-operation. A total of 40 studies involving 867 patients who underwent central pancreatectomy were reviewed. The overall pancreatic <b>fistula</b> rate <b>of</b> the patients was 33. 4 % (0 - 100 %). Of 279 patients, 250 (89. 6 %) had grade A or B <b>fistulae</b> <b>of</b> ISGPF and were treated non-operatively, and the remaining 29 (10. 4 %) had grade C <b>fistulae</b> <b>of</b> ISGPF. In 194 patients, 15 (7. 7 %) were re-operated upon. Only one patient with grade C <b>fistula</b> <b>of</b> ISGPF died from multiple organ failure after re-operation. CONCLUSION: Despite the relatively high occurrence, most pancreatic fistulae after central pancreatectomy are recognized a grade A or B <b>fistula</b> <b>of</b> ISGPF, which can be treated conservatively or by mini-invasive approaches...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{acquisition}} <b>of</b> <b>jaws</b> {{constitutes a}} landmark event in vertebrate evolution, one that {{in large part}} potentiated their success and diversification. Jaw development and patterning involves an intricate spatiotemporal series of reciprocal inductive and responsive interactions between the cephalic epithelia and the cranial neural crest (CNC) and cephalic mesodermal mesenchyme. The coordinated regulation of these interactions is critical for both the ontogenetic registration <b>of</b> the <b>jaws</b> and the evolutionary elaboration <b>of</b> variable <b>jaw</b> morphologies and designs. Current models <b>of</b> <b>jaw</b> development and evolution have been built on molecular and cellular evidence gathered mostly in amniotes such as mice, chicks and humans, and augmented by a much smaller body of work on the zebrafish. These have been partnered by essential work attempting to understand the origins <b>of</b> <b>jaws</b> that {{has focused on the}} jawless lamprey. Chondrichthyans (cartilaginous fish) are the most distant group to amniotes within extant gnathostomes, and comprise the crucial clade uniting amniotes and agnathans; yet despite their critical phylogenetic position, evidence of the molecular and cellular underpinnings <b>of</b> <b>jaw</b> development in chondrichthyans is still lacking. Recent advances in genome and molecular developmental biology of the lesser spotted dogfish shark, Scyliorhinus canicula, make it ideal for the molecular study <b>of</b> chondrichthyan <b>jaw</b> development. Here, following the ‘Hinge and Caps' model <b>of</b> <b>jaw</b> development, we have investigated evidence of heterotopic (relative changes in position) and heterochronic (relative changes in timing) shifts in gene expression, relative to amniotes, in the <b>jaw</b> primordia <b>of</b> S. canicula embryos. We demonstrate the presence of clear proximo-distal polarity in gene expression patterns in the shark embryo, thus establishing a baseline molecular baüplan for branchial arch-derived jaw development and further validating the utility of the ‘Hinge and Caps’ model in comparative studies <b>of</b> <b>jaw</b> development and evolution. Moreover, we correlate gene expression patterns with the absence of a lambdoidal junction (formed where the maxillary first arch meets the frontonasal processes) in chondrichthyans, further highlighting the importance of this region for the development and evolution <b>of</b> <b>jaw</b> structure in advanced gnathostomes...|$|R

INTRODUCTION: The objective of this analysis was to explore the potential association between jaw surgery (as {{a surrogate}} marker for osteonecrosis <b>of</b> the <b>jaw)</b> and the use of oral bisphosphonates in postmenopausal women. METHODS: A claims database was used to identify female patients > or = 45 years <b>of</b> age with <b>jaw</b> surgery claims from January 1, 2002 to December 31, 2005. Four controls (patients with no claims for jaw surgery) were matched to each jaw surgery case. Additional patient data collected included oral bisphosphonate prescriptions (including alendronate, risedronate, or ibandronate) and comorbid conditions. RESULTS: A total <b>of</b> 697 <b>jaw</b> surgery cases and 2, 808 controls were identified. <b>Of</b> those <b>jaw</b> surgery cases, 96 (13. 8 %) received at least one prescription for an oral bisphosphonate. After adjustment for confounding variables, receiving at least one oral bisphosphonate prescription was not shown to significantly increase the risk <b>of</b> <b>jaw</b> surgery (odds ratio(adjusted) = 0. 91; 95 % confidence interval = 0. 70 - 1. 19). When bisphosphonate use was stratified by duration on therapy, no significant increases in the risk <b>of</b> <b>jaw</b> surgery were observed in any group. CONCLUSIONS: This exploratory analysis did not find a significant association between oral bisphosphonate use and increased risk <b>of</b> <b>jaw</b> surgery, a surrogate marker for osteonecrosis <b>of</b> the <b>jaw...</b>|$|R
