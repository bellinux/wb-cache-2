40|$|A q-deformed free scalar {{relativistic}} particle {{is discussed in}} the framework of the BRST formalism. The q-deformed local gauge symmetry and reparametrization invariance of the first-order Lagrangian have been exploited for the BRST quantization of this system on a GL_q(2) invariant quantum world-line. The on-shell <b>equivalence</b> <b>of</b> these BRST <b>charges</b> requires the deformation parameter to be ± 1 under certain identifications. The same restriction (q= ± 1) emerges from the conservation of the q-deformed BRST charge on an arbitrary (unconstrained) manifold and the validity of the BRST algebra. The solutions for the equations of motion respect GL_q(2) invariance on the mass-shell at any arbitrary value of the evolution parameter characterizing the quantum world-line.

40|$|We {{construct}} a quasi-local formalism for conserved charges in {{a theory of}} gravity {{in the presence of}} matter fields which may have slow falloff behaviors at the asymptotic infinity. This construction depends only on equations of motion and so it is irrespective of ambiguities in the total derivatives of the Lagrangian. By using identically conserved currents, we show that this formalism leads to the same expressions <b>of</b> conserved <b>charges</b> as those in the covariant phase space approach. At the boundary of the asymptotic AdS space, we also introduce an identically conserved boundary current which has the same structure as the bulk current and then show that this boundary current gives us the holographic conserved charges identical with those from the boundary stress tensor method. In our quasi-local formalism we present a general proof that conserved charges from the bulk potential are identical with those from the boundary current. Our results can be regarded as the extension of the existing results on the <b>equivalence</b> <b>of</b> conserved <b>charges</b> by the covariant phase space approach and by the boundary stress tensor method.

5000|$|... "Dram" [...] {{equivalence}} {{is sometimes}} still {{used as a}} measure <b>of</b> the powder <b>charge</b> power in a shotgun shell. Today, it is an anachronistic equivalence that represents the equivalent power of a shotgun shell containing this equivalent amount of black-powder measured in drams avoirdupois. [...] A dram in the avoirdupois system is the mass of [...] pound or [...] ounce or 27.3 grains. The reasoning behind this archaic equivalence is that when smokeless powder first came out, some method <b>of</b> establishing an <b>equivalence</b> with common shotgun shell loads was {{needed in order to}} sell a box of shotgun shells. For example, a shotgun shell containing a 3 or 3 1/2 dram load of black-powder was a common hunting field load, and a heavy full power load would have contained about a 4 to 4-1/2 dram load, whereas a shotgun shell containing only a 2 dram load of black-powder was a common target practice load. A hunter looking for a field or full power load familiar with black-powder shotgun loads would have known exactly what the <b>equivalence</b> <b>of</b> the shotgun shells {{would have been in the}} newly introduced smokeless powder. Today, however, this represents a poorly understood <b>equivalence</b> <b>of</b> the powder <b>charge</b> power in a shotgun shell. To further complicate matters, [...] "dram" [...] equivalence was only defined for 12 gauge shotgun shells, and only for lead shot, although it has often been used for describing other gauges of shells, and even steel shot loaded shells. Furthermore, [...] "dram" [...] equivalence only came around about 15 years after smokeless powder had been introduced, long after the need for an equivalence had started to fade, and actual black-powder loaded shotshells had largely vanished. In practice, [...] "dram" [...] equivalence today most commonly equates just to a velocity rating equivalence in fps (feet-per-second), while assuming lead shot.|$|R

40|$|The {{method of}} scaling algebras, {{which has been}} {{introduced}} earlier {{as a means for}} analyzing the short-distance behavior of quantum field theories in the setting of the model-independent, operator algebraic approach, is extended to the case of fields carrying superselection charges.

40|$|AbstractWe {{investigate}} when {{an exact}} functor F≅−⊗ΛMΓ:mod-Λ→mod-Γ which induces a stable <b>equivalence</b> is part <b>of</b> a stable <b>equivalence</b> <b>of</b> Morita type. If Λ and Γ are finite dimensional algebras over a field k whose semisimple quotients are separable, we give a necessary and sufficient condition {{for this to}} be the case.
