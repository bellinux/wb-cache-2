5|$|In 1942 Oppenheimer {{attempted}} to recruit Rabi and Robert Bacher {{to work at}} the Los Alamos Laboratory on a new secret project. They convinced Oppenheimer that his plan for a military laboratory would not work, since a scientific effort would need to be a civilian affair. The plan was modified, and the new laboratory would be a civilian one, run by the University of California under contract from the War Department. In the end, Rabi still did not <b>go</b> <b>west,</b> but did agree to serve as a consultant to the Manhattan Project. Rabi attended the Trinity test in July 1945. The scientists working on Trinity set up a betting pool on the yield of the test, with predictions ranging from total dud to 45 kilotons of TNT equivalent (kt). Rabi arrived late and found the only entry left was for 18 kilotons, which he purchased. Wearing welding goggles, he waited for the result with Ramsey and Enrico Fermi. The blast was rated at 18.6 kilotons, and Rabi won the pool.|$|E
25|$|That same year, 1936, West played {{opposite}} Randolph Scott in <b>Go</b> <b>West,</b> Young Man. In this film, she adapted Lawrence Riley's Broadway hit Personal Appearance into a screenplay. Directed by Henry Hathaway, <b>Go</b> <b>West,</b> Young Man {{is considered}} one of West's weaker films of the era, due to the censor's cuts.|$|E

25|$|Gladys George {{had made}} her mark on Broadway with her {{starring}} role in Lawrence Riley's Personal Appearance (1934) (adapted for the screen in 1936 as <b>Go</b> <b>West,</b> Young Man); this comedy's huge success had been credited in great part to her comic performance. Her role as Archer's wife thus displays her versatility.|$|E
25|$|According to some accounts, an 18-year-old John persuaded his 11-year-old {{half-brother}} Nathaniel to <b>go</b> <b>west</b> {{with him}} in 1792. The duo apparently lived a nomadic life until their father brought his large family west in 1805 and met up with them in Ohio. The younger Nathaniel decided to stay and help their father farm the land.|$|E
25|$|Erik the Red (Old Norse: Eiríkr rauði) migrates from Norway to Iceland {{with his}} father, Þorvaldr Ásvaldsson, {{because of some}} killings.

25|$|Three {{possible}} alignments {{were considered}} for the westward extension. The least expensive would follow the railway right-of-way past the Exhibition {{and up to the}} Galt-Weston railway corridor, taking it to Dundas West station. Another alternative would <b>go</b> <b>west</b> of Strachan along the Oakville Subdivision rail lines to Roncesvalles, where it would turn north to connect to the Bloor line at Dundas West. The third alignment considered ran along an elevated guideway on Parkside Drive at the edge of High Park to Keele Station.|$|E
25|$|After a short {{experience}} at RKO (Room Service, 1938), the Marx Brothers returned to MGM and made three more films: At the Circus (1939), <b>Go</b> <b>West</b> (1940) and The Big Store (1941). Prior {{to the release}} of The Big Store the team announced they were retiring from the screen. Four years later, however, Chico persuaded his brothers to make two additional films, A Night in Casablanca (1946) and Love Happy (1949), to alleviate his severe gambling debts. Both pictures were released by United Artists.|$|E
25|$|After passing rest {{areas on}} either side, I-390 reaches the NY408 exit {{adjacent}} to the American Rock Salt mine at Hampton Corners. Here, most traffic bound for the Buffalo area exits to <b>go</b> <b>west</b> to Mount Morris, visible across the flats from the freeway, where it follows NY36 north. To the immediate east of the exit Route408 ends at Route63, which carries traffic from the interstate into Geneseo, the county seat. A mile north of the exit, Canaseraga Creek drains into the Genesee River on the road's west side.|$|E

[...] "Don't Look Down - The Sequel" [...] would become <b>Go</b> <b>West's</b> first top 40 stateside hit.|$|R

25|$|In Poland, Seel parted {{ways with}} the Russian army and joined {{a group of}} {{concentration}} camp survivors soon to be brought back to France. The Red Cross soon took over and organised a train convoy. This however did not <b>go</b> <b>west</b> but south, through Odessa and the Black Sea, in terrible sanitary conditions. Seel was still in Poland on 8 May 1945 when the Armistice was declared. In Odessa, as he {{was put in charge}} of order in the refugee camp he was in, he contracted malaria. At this time he was also advised to change his name to Celle and hide {{the fact that he was}} Alsatian by saying he was from Belfort.|$|E
25|$|The {{situation}} grew worse. A {{group of}} whites assaulted some Indians {{sitting around a}} campfire. Two more Indians came up during the assault and opened fire on the whites. Three whites were wounded, and one Indian was killed and one wounded. In August 1835, Private Kinsley Dalton (for whom Dalton, Georgia is named) was killed by Seminoles as he was carrying the mail from Fort Brooke to Fort King. In November, Chief Charley Emathla, wanting no part of a war, led his people to Fort Brooke, where they were to board ships to <b>go</b> <b>west.</b> This was considered a betrayal by other Seminoles. Osceola met Charley Emathla on the trail and killed him.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the band}} {{seemed to have}} {{maintained}} their momentum and recovered well from the split of the original lineup, {{they were about to}} be hit by a serious tragedy. Unknown to the rest of Level 42, guitarist Alan Murphy was suffering from AIDS, something which he himself may have been aware of before joining the band. At the time, his previous band <b>Go</b> <b>West</b> had been stalled by internal disagreements, and one of Murphy's reasons for joining Level 42 was to ensure that he spent his last days playing the music that he loved. During 1989, Murphy contracted pneumonia: weakened by his existing condition, his decline was rapid and he died on 19 October 1989.|$|E

He had six sons: John (died a young man), Daniel (who <b>went</b> <b>west),</b> George (lived near Hyersvill, and had a son Isaih), Jacob (who <b>went</b> <b>west</b> and became a Methodist minister, and had one daughter), Jonathan (settled in Washington Co, {{in the area of}} Hagerstown) and David (bachelor who lived and died near Myersville); and daughters: Elizabeth (1804-1857) Mrs John Harp, and Catherine (1807-1859) Mrs Joseph Bowlus.|$|R
25|$|The Act {{empowering}} the Toronto, Grey and Bruce specified that the railway should extend from Toronto via Orangeville, to Mount Forest and Durham, {{where it would}} split into a northerly branch to Southampton and a southerly one to Kincardine. Another branch north to Owen Sound was to commence at Mount Forest or Durham. A line from Toronto must first get to the Humber Valley at Weston {{by means of a}} third rail in the 5ft 6in gauge track of the Grand Trunk Railway, proceed up the Humber Valley to Bolton, Ontario and then traverse the Caledon Mountain to gain Orangeville via the Credit Valley. The line would then <b>go</b> <b>west</b> to Arthur, and then north to Mount Forest.|$|E
25|$|Following the tour, Level 42 {{recruited}} Gary Husband as the band's new full-time drummer. He in turn recommended Steve Topping as {{a replacement}} guitarist. However, Topping and King's personalities clashed and Topping eventually left the band in early 1988 after initial writing and rehearsing sessions in Dublin. Most of the next Level 42 album, Staring at the Sun, was recorded without a permanent guitarist. Rhythm guitar on the studio recordings was handled either by the band's old friend Dominic Miller or by an uncredited Mark King. In April 1988, {{towards the end of}} the sessions, the band recruited lead guitarist Alan Murphy (a session guitarist who had worked extensively with Kate Bush and had also been a member of <b>Go</b> <b>West).</b>|$|E
25|$|In the Town of Poughkeepsie, {{just after}} the {{northern}} terminus of NY9D, 9 passes another distressed mall, South Hills and its healthier, newer counterpart, the Poughkeepsie Galleria. A mile further north, NY113 swings to the west at a cloverleaf interchange near the IBM plant, once the region's major employer. Entering the city of Poughkeepsie, at Sharon Drive, 9 returns to expressway status once again. Two miles (3.2km) north of Sharon, the highway connects to the US44/NY55 concurrency at an interchange {{in close proximity to}} the Mid-Hudson Bridge. This creates some unusual left exits, as traffic from 44/55 east wanting to go north on 9 is routed into a U-turn south of the highway, and likewise northbound drivers on 9 must get turned around to <b>go</b> <b>west</b> over the river. The limited-access highway comes to an end at the intersection with NY9G near Marist College.|$|E
