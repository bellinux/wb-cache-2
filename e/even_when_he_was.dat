5|$|Cascioferro's life {{is full of}} {{myth and}} mystery. He became a legend <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> alive, and that legend is {{partially}} responsible for creating {{the image of the}} gallant gentleman capomafia (Mafia boss). He is widely considered to have been responsible for the 1909 murder of Joseph Petrosino, head of the New York City police department's Italian Squad. However, he was never convicted of the crime.|$|E
5|$|In December 2011, with Paul's {{increased}} support, {{the controversy}} over racist and homophobic statements in several Ron Paul newsletters in the 1980s and early 1990s once again gained media attention. During this time Paul supporters asserted that he was continually ignored by the media despite his significant support, citing examples of where television news shows would fail to mention Paul in discussions of the Republican presidential hopefuls <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> polling second.|$|E
5|$|When Feynman {{was nearing}} death, he asked Danny Hillis {{why he was}} so sad. Hillis replied that he thought Feynman was going to die soon. Feynman said that that {{sometimes}} bothered him, too, adding, when you get to be as old as he was, and have told so many stories to so many people, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> dead he would not be completely gone.|$|E

5|$|McKay {{stated that}} he {{believed}} Kimball could still serve as an apostle even if he underwent a complete laryngectomy and advised him {{to go forward with}} the procedure. Martin subsequently surgically removed one of Kimball's vocal cords and half of the other, leaving him barely able to speak above a hoarse whisper. After several weeks of enforced silence, Kimball slowly recovered, and by November 1957, he was allowed by his physician to resume speaking in public. Kimball's voice remained raspy throughout the rest of his life, and he usually wore an ear-mounted microphone to help magnify his voice, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> speaking at normal microphone-equipped pulpits.|$|E
5|$|At Auschwitz, {{the actual}} {{delivery}} of gas {{to the victims}} was always handled by the SS, {{on the order of}} the supervising SS doctor. Many of the SS doctors also conducted inhumane medical experiments on camp prisoners. The most infamous SS doctor, Josef Mengele, served as a medical officer at Auschwitz under the command of Eduard Wirths of the camp's medical corps. Mengele undertook selections <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not assigned {{to do so in the}} hope of finding subjects for his experiments. He was particularly interested in locating sets of twins. In contrast to most of the doctors, who viewed undertaking selections as one of their most stressful and horrible duties, Mengele undertook the task with a flamboyant air, often smiling or whistling a tune. After the war, many SS doctors were charged with war crimes for their inhumane medical experiments and for their role in gas chamber selections.|$|E
5|$|During the tour, Miller {{generally}} {{played in}} the Tests as an opening bowler alongside Lindwall and as a middle-order batsman, coming in at No. 4 or No. 5. His batting ability was such that he played as a specialist batsman <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> unable to bowl due to injury, such as during the Second Test. Miller wanted to play purely as a batsman, feeling that the workload of bowling would hinder his run-scoring. However, Bradman was intent on going through the tour undefeated, and utilised his bowling options to the full, to maximise the Australians’ chances of winning. Lindwall and Miller were the first-choice pace duo, {{regarded as one of}} the greatest speed pairings in the history of cricket, whereas the latter was just one of many accomplished batsmen in the team. As a result, the Australian skipper valued Miller more as an opening bowler. He ended the Tests with 184runs at 26.28 and 13wickets at 23.15 from 138.1overs and took eight catches.|$|E

25|$|However, Ventura {{would still}} {{occasionally}} give credit {{where it was}} due, praising the athleticism of wrestlers such as Ricky Steamboat and Randy Savage, who was championed by Ventura for years, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a face, a point Ventura regularly made on-air to McMahon and Monsoon. Occasionally he would even acknowledge mistakes made by the heels, including those made by his personal favorites such as Savage or wrestlers managed by heels Bobby Heenan and Jimmy Hart.|$|E
25|$|Wei Zhao's Book of Wu (吳書) {{described}} Lu Su as follows: Lu Su was {{a strict}} person who rarely indulged in material pleasures, led a frugal life, {{and had no}} interest in common hobbies. He maintained good military discipline and executed orders without fail. <b>Even</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> in the army, he was often seen reading books. He was proficient in arguing and writing. He could think far and possessed an exemplary sense of judgment. He was the best after Zhou Yu.|$|E
25|$|His music {{consists}} of dances such as galliards, voltas and correntes, grouped loosely into suites, organized by musical mode. Each suite is {{preceded by a}} toccata, and the book closes with two paired passamezzos and saltarellos. Stylistically they are written in the most modern manner of the time, with dissonances, ornaments, and functional tonal progressions indicative of the developing early Baroque style. His musical style was particularly influential in southern Germany, {{as shown by the}} demand for his music, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> still in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.|$|E

25|$|In 1872 Griffith {{was elected}} to the Legislative Assembly of Queensland, for East Moreton. Throughout his career he saw himself as a lawyer first and a {{politician}} second, and continued to appear at the Bar <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> in office. Griffith took silk in 1876 as a Queen's Counsel. In Parliament he gained a reputation as a liberal reformer. He was Attorney-General, Minister for Education and Minister for Works, and became leader of the liberal party in 1879. His great enemy was the conservative leader Sir Thomas McIlwraith, whom he accused (correctly) of corruption.|$|E
25|$|Ling Tong {{respected}} and befriended {{members of the}} scholar-gentry. They admired him {{even though he was}} a military serviceman. Being receptive, he had a reputation for being accommodating towards men of talent. <b>Even</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> busy with work, he always took time to receive visitors. He viewed righteousness and loyalty as important values and saw wealth as inferior. He was thus praised by Chen Shou as a guoshi. Once, Sun Quan's subjects recommended a famous talent, Sheng Xian, to him. Ling Tong was asleep when he heard that Sheng Xian had arrived to meet his lord. He immediately got out of bed to receive Sheng Xian and held Sheng's hand while leading him to meet Sun Quan.|$|E
25|$|After {{months of}} testing by specialists the doctors {{concluded}} {{he had a}} genetic condition called Alexander's disease. They warned her against having more children. Messenger states that her son did not progress past a 4-month old's development <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> one year old. She concluded {{that because of the}} timing of the vaccinations, the baby's reactions and other parents' stories it was the vaccine that killed him and not a genetic disease. She has since stated that there is a conspiracy with pharmaceutical companies and the medical community to cover-up vaccine related problems, because of financial incentives. She feels like she was lied to by the doctors and believes parents should have all the information about vaccinations in order for the parent to make good decisions.|$|E

25|$|On 5 April 1932 Goddard was {{appointed}} a full-time Judge of the King's Bench Division of the High Court of England and Wales, receiving a knighthood later that year. After only six {{years he was}} promoted again to be a Lord Justice of Appeal. Goddard was known for turning out well-argued and legally convincing judgments. He would deliver stern diatribes to criminals, but his sentences were usually moderate, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> personally offended by the crime. After another six-year stint, he {{was appointed}} as a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary upon the death of Lord Atkin in 1944 and received as a Law lord a life peerage. He chose the title Baron Goddard of Aldbourne in the County of Wiltshire.|$|E
25|$|Returning to the South African Test {{team in the}} 1938-39 {{series against}} England, Rowan {{appeared}} to have cemented his place with 284 runs in four matches, with a top score of 89 not out. But it was another 10 years before he played Test cricket again, as his clashes with authority led to his omission. <b>Even</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> reinstated, in the 1948-49 home series against England, it was announced during the second Test at Johannesburg {{that he would be}} dropped for the next match: he responded by scoring an unbeaten 156 that enabled his team to salvage a draw after they had been 293 behind on the first innings. He played another match-saving innings in the fourth Test of the series.|$|E
25|$|Neither caliph {{participated in}} the direct {{military}} operations of the war. In Al-Musta'in's case, he was generally content to leave the responsibility of conducting the war effort to Muhammad b. 'Abdallah. As commander, Muhammad opted for an overall defensive strategy. Relying on his position in Baghdad, {{he was reluctant to}} engage in any sort of offensive operations outside the city and its surrounding districts, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> advised by others to do so. While he did make an effort to securing the nearby towns that controlled access to the city, {{there is no mention of}} any attempt to attack Samarra. By staying within Baghdad and keeping the city's supply routes open, while at the same time cutting off foodstuffs and tax receipts meant for Samarra, Muhammad likely believed that he could outlast al-Mu'tazz's armies.|$|E

25|$|One {{aspect of}} cricket-keeping, that of growing molded, custom-shaped gourds {{destined to become}} cricket homes, was an {{exclusive}} monopoly of the Forbidden City. The royal gardeners would place the ovary of an emerging Lagenaria fruit inside an earthen mould, forcing the fruit {{to take up the}} desired shape. The oldest surviving molded gourd, Hasshin Hyōko dated 1238, is preserved in Hōryū-ji temple in Japan. The art reached its peak in the 18th century, when the gardeners implemented reusable carved wood and disposable clay molds. The shapes of the gourds were tailored to different species of cricket: larger gourds for larger species, long-bottle gourds for the species known for long hops, and so on. Immature fruit easily reproduces the artwork carved into the mold, but also easily picks up any natural or man-made impurities. The finest craftsmen exploited, rather than concealed, these blemishes. Molded gourds were a symbol of the highest social standing. The ones held by Chinese royalty depicted in medieval portraits were actually prized cricket containers. The Yongzheng Emperor held a gourd in his hand <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> sleeping, the Qianlong Emperor maintained a private molded gourd garden. In the 1800s the Jiaqing Emperor lifted the monopoly on molded gourds, but they remained expensive even for the upper classes.|$|E
25|$|In March 2007, Herbalife {{signed a}} five-year {{deal with the}} Galaxy, worth between $4–5million a year, to be the club's primary shirt sponsor. Four months later, the club signed David Beckham from Real Madrid. His debut was made at Home Depot Center before a record crowd of nearly 35,000, {{including}} many celebrities, coming on in the 78th minute in a 1–0 loss to Chelsea in a match during the World Series of Football tournament. The match brought unprecedented TV coverage from ESPN, who used 19 cameras to cover it, including one trained only on Beckham, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> on the bench. In that season's SuperLiga, LA reached the final but lost to Mexican side Pachuca on penalties after extra time. LA nearly made the end-of-season play-offs, but were eliminated following a 1–0 loss to the Chicago Fire. In the off-season, Cobi Jones retired and, amidst rumors {{that he was going}} to be sacked, Yallop resigned as head coach following a friendly match at Home Depot Center. The San Jose Earthquakes bought out his contract and offered a third round draft pick to the Galaxy as compensation to hire Yallop as their new head coach. Yallop was replaced at LA by Ruud Gullit, who signed a three-year contract with the club, making him the highest paid coach in MLS history. Cobi Jones returned as assistant coach. LA went on a promotional tour of Australia and New Zealand, setting attendance records in both countries. 80,295 people showed up at Stadium Australia for the match between Sydney FC and LA Galaxy, which the home side won 5–3. They also played a tour of Asia, and competed in the inaugural Pan-Pacific Championship in Honolulu, finishing third after beating Sydney 2–1 in the third-place match.|$|E
500|$|The Western {{world not}} only {{inspired}} Jinnah in his political life, but also greatly influenced his personal preferences, {{particularly when it}} came to dress. Jinnah abandoned local garb for Western-style clothing, and throughout his life he was always impeccably dressed in public.
