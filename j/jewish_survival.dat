2500|$|Alongside the {{noticeable}} {{change in}} fortunes on the Eastern Front, a main motivator for all post-1943 changes, noted by various historians, was the manifold financial opportunity of <b>Jewish</b> <b>survival.</b> Wealthier Jews were financially extorted {{in order to}} avoid community work and deportation, and the work of some professionals was harnessed by the public sector, and even by the Army. From the beginning, the regime had excepted from deportations some Jews who were experts in fields such as forestry and chemistry, and some others were even allowed to return despite antisemitic protests in their home provinces. Economic exploitation was institutionalized in late 1941-early 1942, with the creation of a Central Jewish Office. Supervised by Commissioner Radu Lecca and formally led by the Jewish intellectuals Nandor Gingold and Henric Streitman, it collected funds which were in part redirected toward Maria Antonescu's charities. Small numbers of Romanian Jews left independently for the Palestine as early as 1941, but British opposition to Zionist plans made their transfer perilous (one notorious example of this being the MV Struma). On a personal level, Antonescu's encouragement of crimes alternated with periods when he gave in to the pleas of Jewish community leader Wilhelm Filderman. In one such instance, he reversed his own 1942 decision to impose the wearing of yellow badges, which nevertheless remained in use everywhere outside the Old Kingdom and, in theory, to any Romanian Jews elsewhere in Axis-controlled Europe. Assessing these contradictions, commentators also mention the effect of Allied promises to prosecute those responsible for genocide throughout Europe. In the late stages of the war, Antonescu was attempting to shift all blame for crimes from his regime while accusing Jews of [...] "bring destruction upon themselves".|$|E

Snieg connected with Rabbi Philip S.

Israel’s illusions are that it can be ‘like other nations’; that it can replicate in short order the civic nations that France and the United States became after many generations; and that it must ‘de-ethnicise’ and de-Judaise to become acceptable to its neighbours...|$|R

40|$|Dissertação de mestrado em Relações Internacionais, apresentada à Faculdade de Economia da Universidade de Coimbra, sob a orientação de Carmen Amado Mendes. The Securitization Process as {{the main}} {{strategy}} {{for the establishment of}} the Israeli State and the consequent definition of its boundaries focuses on the development of an alternative perspective regarding the establishment of the State of Israel and the consequential definition of its boundaries. In order to avoid any methodological mistakes based on the premise of a partial analysis, the author of the present dissertation initially focuses on the analysis of the concept of “Securitization”, provided by the Copenhagen School, since the standard established by the previous allows to verify the influence of the discursive acts performed by the recognized leaders that are involved throughout the key events of the conflict in analysis. The acts in question were determining factors for the evolution of the conflict, since, as it is approached in the first chapter, the discursive acts of the leaders are able to affect the creation of perceptions, not only by the affected population but, as well, by the International Community. As a result, the author felt the need to explore the theoretical conception of the “Securitization” process, with a special focus on the consequences that the previous allows, in order to contribute as well for the discussion of the theme in question, within the field of Security Studies. Afterwards, the author develops an analysis of the Zionist ideology, with the goal of verifying that its leaders, through the use of discursive acts, directly iv influenced the perceptions of the community that was covered by it, being that the Jewish population, and, as well, the leaders of the States that had the capability to directly influence the issues identified by the previously referred ideology. By doing so, the author will try to prove that the establishment of the State of Israel, even before the development of the Nazi doctrine, was an achievable goal, since the structures to do so had been, until then, created. Consequently, after proving that the establishment of the State of Israel is a result of a successful developed process of “Securitization” of the <b>Jewish</b> community <b>survival,</b> by the Zionist leaders, the author will focus on an analysis directed to the events that allowed the strengthening of the Israeli sovereignty, in its territory, and, afterwards, on the definition of the territory that was subject to it. By doing so, together with a brief scrutiny regarding the facilitating element that the structures created by the Zionist movement added to the relationship between Israel and the remaining States, the author will try to prove that the State of Israel possesses a regime of exception, within the International Community, which was acquired through the development of successive processes of “Securitization” of the Jewish identity...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} explores {{issues of}} identification, relatedness, and belonging {{on a global}} scale, through an ethnographic study of Portugal's urban Marranos (descendants of fifteenth-century forced converts to Catholicism) and foreign Jews who travel from abroad to meet them. Although not Jewish according to Jewish law, given centuries of intermarriage, Marranos are nonetheless widely considered {{to be part of}} "the Jewish family," "lost brethren" who should be welcomed back to the Jewish people. Many Jews view them within the metanarrative of <b>Jewish</b> destruction and <b>survival,</b> the "eternal spark" that remains despite the Inquisition's attempted elimination of Judaism from the Portuguese landscape. However, for numerous local reasons the present-day Marranos are not welcomed by Portugal's tiny normative Jewish community. As a result, the urban Marranos, who feel strongly that they are Jews by descent, turn to foreign Jewish travelers as sources of educational, spiritual, and material assistance in their bid to join the Jewish world and attain recognition as Jews in the present. Based on two years of fieldwork in Marrano organizations in Lisbon and Porto and traveling alongside Jewish tourists and outreach workers, the dissertation undertakes a processual analysis of the constitution of ancestral Jewish identity and of the role of transnational, cross-cultural affective ties in affording a sense of global Jewish belonging. The primary questions driving this work are, first, how and why do far-flung people come to feel that they are related to one another, and what terms do they use to characterize and think through that feeling of relatedness? Second, to what extent are their perceptions of essential connection disrupted or transformed by face-to-face contact? By interrogating the cultural logics of kinship writ large [...] the language and conceptual frameworks people use to articulate and make sense of their feelings of relatedness to one another [...] and then examining how those logics play out "on the ground," this study provides a fine-grained ethnographic analysis of the mechanisms through which global and ancestral imaginings become concretized in social interaction. Ultimately, I argue, physical proximity remains the productive sphere for identification and belonging, even as global interconnection provides new opportunities for encounter...|$|R

40|$|Recently, several {{demographic}} factors, including increasing {{rates of}} intermarriage, a declining Jewish birth rate, decreased giving to Jewish causes, and {{low levels of}} affiliation with Jewish organizations, have been of great concern to the Jewish community. The response in the community has been fear for <b>Jewish</b> continuity and <b>survival</b> and a subsequent search for the Jewish character of Jewish communal organizations to both legitimate their existence and facilitate their role in perpetuating and enhancing Jewish culture. Jewish character can be defined as any actions done which serve to ensure Jewish continuity. These actions entail both the transmission of Jewish knowledge and traditions and the transmission of Jewish values. Evidence of Jewish character can be found within an agency 2 ̆ 7 s organizational culture. Thus, this dissertation sought to examine the organizational culture of Jewish Family and Children 2 ̆ 7 s Service of Philadelphia (JFCS) from an historical perspective, in part, to trace the agency 2 ̆ 7 s Jewish character from 1822 to 1995. Organizational culture {{can be seen as a}} matrix of beliefs, values, norms, and expectations held by an organization 2 ̆ 7 s members in relation to the organization, manifested in its artifacts, values, and underlying assumptions. The organizational culture of JFCS was explored through content analysis of historical documents from JFCS and its predecessor organizations as well as 108 years of the newspaper The Jewish Exponent. A composite of Monson 2 ̆ 7 s (1992) typology dealing with 2 ̆ 2 What is Jewish about the constitutional documents of American Jewry? 2 ̆ 2 and Sarna 2 ̆ 7 s (1992) typology examining the American influence found in Jewish documents was used. This study revealed the organizational culture of JFCS to be characterized by an adaptive nature, a professional orientation, and a decidedly Jewish character. Further, the Jewish character was present throughout every phase of the agency 2 ̆ 7 s development. Findings demonstrate ways in which JFCS has maintained its cultural heritage in the face of assimilation which can be useful for other ethnic groups facing the same dilemma. ...|$|R
5000|$|After {{the death}} of his mother in 1980, Kamenetz turned from poetry to the autobiographical essay in Terra Infirma (University of Arkansas, 1985) and reprinted by Schocken Books in 1999. [...] The book is {{structured}} as the interpretation of a single dream of his late mother, which Kamenetz modeled on Michel Butor's Histoire extraordinaire: essai sur un rêve de Baudelaire (1961). In October 1990, Kamenetz was invited to observe an historic dialogue between rabbis and the XIV Dalai Lama in Dharamsala, India. The Dalai Lama had asked the Jewish delegates to share with him [...] "the secret of <b>Jewish</b> spiritual <b>survival</b> in exile." [...] His account of this exchange, The Jew in the Lotus (1994), was a popular success and became an international best-seller. Writing in the New York Times, Verlyn Klinkenborg cited its broader relevance as a book [...] "about the survival of esoteric traditions in a world bent on destroying them." [...] The book was primarily potent in capturing an ongoing engagement in the US between Jews, often highly secularized, and Buddhist teachings. Kamenetz popularized the term JUBU or Jewish Buddhist, interviewing poet Allen Ginsberg, vipassana teacher Joseph Goldstein, Ram Dass and other American Jews involved with bringing Eastern traditions to the West. The book also made prominent a Jewish mystical response to Eastern spirituality in the Jewish renewal movement, led by Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi, and Jewish meditation as taught by Rabbi Jonathan Omer-Man. The Jew in the Lotus inspired a PBS documentary of the same name produced and directed by Laurel Chiten, released theatrically in New York, Los Angeles and Boston, and subsequently on Independent Lens on September 1, 1999. Kamenetz followed The Jew in the Lotus with Stalking Elijah: Adventures with Today's Jewish Mystical Masters (Harper, 1997), which received the National Jewish Book Award for Jewish Thought in 1997. Kamenetz interviews a number of Jewish leaders who attempt to blend together Jewish mysticism, feminism and innovations in prayer and meditation practice. Among them were Rabbis Zalman Schachter-Shalomi, Jonathan Omer-Man, Arthur Green and Shefa Gold. The book ends with the account of a seder held in Dharamsala India, which included as guests the Tibetan teacher Geshe Sonam Rinchen. During that same visit, Kamenetz met with the Dalai Lama, which inspired him to work with the Interfaith Action Network of the International Campaign to free the young Panchen Lama Gedhun Choekyi Nyima from Chinese government detainment. The world's youngest prisoner of conscience, the Panchen Lama's eighth birthday fell {{during the first week of}} Passover. Struck by this coincidence, Kamenetz created a nationwide campaign of Passover Seders for Tibet, uniting the Jewish memory of slavery and oppression in Egypt long ago with the lack of religious freedom in today's Tibet under Chinese rule. A special seder was held in Washington D.C. on April 24, 1997 and attended by the Dalai Lama, as well as by numerous U.S. dignitaries and celebrities, including Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer and Adam Yauch of the Beastie Boys. The seder, as well as Kamenetz's visit with the Dalai Lama in 1997 was featured in the 1999 documentary, The Jew in the Lotus and is recounted in Stalking Elijah [...] In fall 2007, Harper One published The History of Last Night's Dream which explores the spiritual possibilities of dreaming from Genesis to now.
