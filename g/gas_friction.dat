Such vehicles have kinetic energies typically between 50 and 1800 MJoules, and atmospheric dissipation {{is the only}} way of expending the kinetic energy. The amount of rocket fuel required to slow the vehicle would be nearly equal to the amount used to accelerate it initially, and it is thus highly impractical to use retro rockets for the entire Earth re-entry procedure. While the high temperature generated at the surface of the heat shield is due to adiabatic compression, the vehicle's kinetic energy is ultimately lost to <b>gas</b> <b>friction</b> (viscosity) after the vehicle has passed by. Other smaller energy losses include black body radiation directly from the hot gasses and chemical reactions between ionized gasses.|$|E

40|$|Nonlinear {{numerical}} simulations {{are performed}} {{to investigate the}} density evolution in the dust layer of a protoplanetary disk due to the gravitational instability and dust settling toward the midplane. We assume the region where the radial pressure gradient at equilibrium is negligible so that the shear-induced instability is avoided, and also restrict to an axisymmetric perturbation {{as a first step}} of nonlinear numerical simulations of the gravitational instability. We find that there are two different evolutional paths of the gravitational instability depending on the nondimensional <b>gas</b> <b>friction</b> time, which is defined as the product of the <b>gas</b> <b>friction</b> time and the Keplerian angular velocity. If the nondimensional <b>gas</b> <b>friction</b> time is equal to 0. 01, the gravitational instability grows faster than dust settling. On the other hand, if the nondimensional <b>gas</b> <b>friction</b> time is equal to 0. 1, dust aggregates settle sufficiently before the gravitational instability grows. In the latter case, an approximate analytical calculation reveals that dust settling is faster than the growth of the gravitational instability regardless of the dust density at the midplane. Thus, the dust layer becomes extremely thin and may reach a few tenth of the material density of the dust before the gravitational instability grows. Comment: 4 pages, 3 figure...|$|E

40|$|Instabilities of {{the dust}} layer in a protoplanetary disk are investigated. It is known that the {{streaming}} instability develops and dust density concentration occurs {{in a situation where}} the initial dust density is uniform. This work considers the effect of initial dust density gradient vertical to the midplane. Dust and gas are treated as different fluids. Pressure of dust fluid is assumed to be zero. The <b>gas</b> <b>friction</b> time is assumed to be constant. Axisymmetric two-dimensional numerical simulation was performed using the spectral method. We found that an instability develops with a growth rate on the order of the Keplerian angular velocity even if the <b>gas</b> <b>friction</b> time multiplied by the Keplerian angular velocity is as small as 0. 001. This instability is powered by two sources: (1) the vertical shear of the azimuthal velocity, and (2) the relative motion of dust and gas coupled with the dust density fluctuation due to advection. This instability diffuses dust by turbulent advection and the maximum dust density decreases. This means that the dust concentration by the streaming instability which is seen {{in the case of a}} uniform initial dust density becomes ineffective as dust density gradient increases by the dust settling toward the midplane.

40|$|Dust grains {{immersed}} in plasma discharges acquire a large negative charge and {{settle into a}} dust cloud {{at the edge of}} the sheath. In this region, the plasma ions stream toward the electrode at a velocity u approx. cs=(T(sub e) /m(sub i)) (exp 1 / 2). Experimentally at sufficiently high gas pressure P, the random kinetic energy of the grains is damped by <b>gas</b> <b>friction,</b> and the grains are strongly coupled and self-organize into a crystalline configuration. For lower pressures despite the dissipation of grain kinetic energy to <b>gas</b> <b>friction,</b> the dust grains reach a steady-state kinetic temperature T(sub d) which is much larger than the temperature of any other component in the plasma. T(sub d) is so large that the dust acts like a fluid. We have used the dynamically shielded dust (DSD) model to simulate these physical processes. We find that the known experimental features are nicely reproduced in the simulations, and that additional features are revealed. In the figure we plot the variation of T(sub d) as P is continuously varied in a DSD code run. A marked difference is evident between the critical pressure P(sub m) for the melting transition as P is decreased, and the critical pressure P(sub c) for the condensation transition as P is increased. For P(sub m) is less than P is less than P(sub c), mixed phase states are seen. This hysteresis occurs because the instability which triggers melting is different from the instability that heats the dust in the fluid phase and inhibits freezing. At low pressure, the dust is subject to a two-stream instability with the ions. This instability is responsible for the high temperature of the dust at low pressure. The basic physics underlying the melting transition has been elucidated in a series of papers.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{modeling}} of transient diesel engine operation {{appeared in the}} early seventies and continues to be in the focal point of research, due to the importance of transient response in the everyday operating conditions of engines. The majority of the simulations have focused so far on thermodynamics, as this directly affects performance and pollutants emissions. As far as dynamic modeling is concerned, simplified approaches are usually adopted in order to save execution time of the simulation code. In this paper, one of the basic simplifications of transient dynamic modeling, i. e. the assumption of the crankshaft being sufficiently rigid is being investigated. In real engine operation, different, instantaneous torsional angles for the engine and load are experienced that lead to angular deformation of the crankshaft. This deformation can assume significant values, particularly during transients, and as such it is of great importance for safe engine operation.
