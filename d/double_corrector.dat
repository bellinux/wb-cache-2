40|$|Aberration {{correction}} {{leads to}} a substantial improvement in the directly interpretable resolution of transmission electron microscopes. Correction of the aberrations has been achieved electron-optically through a hexapole-based corrector and also indirectly by computational analysis of a focal or tilt series of images. These direct and indirect methods are complementary, and {{a combination of the}} two offers further advantages. Materials characterization has benefitted from the reduced delocalization and higher resolution in the corrected images. It is now possible, for example, to locate atomic columns at surfaces to higher accuracy and reliability. This article describes the JEM- 2200 FS in Oxford, which is equipped with correctors for both the image-forming and probe-forming lenses. Examples of the use of this instrument in the characterization of nanocrystalline catalysts are given together with initial results combining direct and indirect methods. The <b>double</b> <b>corrector</b> configuration enables direct imaging of the corrected probe, and a potential confocal imaging mode is described. Finally, modifications to a second generation instrument are outlined...|$|E
30|$|Environmental TEM and STEM {{have been}} used for {{catalysis}} research for decades [3 – 10]. Notably, Gai and Boyes pioneered the development of environmental cell and heating stage for in situ study of catalysts [3 – 5]. They achieved sub-Ångström resolution using the aforementioned setup in a TEM/STEM with <b>double</b> <b>correctors</b> [8 – 10]. Our work was carried out using a TEM/STEM without an aberration corrector. The goal of this work was to demonstrate the advantage of obtaining surface and bulk information of catalysts by simultaneous imaging using both transmitted (ADF, TE) and secondary electron signals (SE).|$|R
40|$|Optical {{sectioning}} using scanning confocal {{electron microscopy}} (SCEM) {{is a new}} three-dimensional (3 D) imaging technique which promises improved depth resolution, particularly for laterally extended objects. Using a stage-scanning system to move the specimen in three dimensions, two-dimensional (2 D) images sliced from any plane in XYZ space can be obtained in shorter acquisition times than those required for conventional electron tomography. In this paper, a double aberration-corrected SCEM used in annular dark-field mode was used to observe the 3 D structure of SiO(2) hollow spheres fabricated by a carbon template method. The double-shell structure {{of the sample was}} clearly reflected in both XY- and XZ-sliced images. However, elongation along the optical axis was still evident in the XZ-sliced images even when <b>double</b> aberration <b>correctors</b> were used. Application of a deconvolution technique to the experimental XZ-sliced images reduced the elongated shell thicknesses of the SiO(2) sphere by 40 - 50 % and the selectivity of information at a certain sample depth was also enhanced. Subsequently, 3 D reconstruction by stacking the deconvoluted slice images restored the spherical surface of a SiO(2) sphere...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{targets to}} {{demonstrate}} {{the importance of the}} choice of the algorithm references detection to be applied with a <b>double</b> fuzzy PI <b>corrector</b> (DFPI) for the control and the regulation of a shunt active power filter (SAPF) DC bus voltage. In a previous work, the synchronous reference frame (SRF) algorithm was applied and gave satisfactory results. In the present paper, the SRF is compared to the positive sequence of the fundamental of the source voltage algorithm (PSF) which offered better results regarding the power quality of the considered main utility feeding a variable DC RL load throughout a diode bridge. The results were carried out using computer simulation performed under MATLAB/Simulink environment. To make the obtained results more convenient, a compariso...|$|R
