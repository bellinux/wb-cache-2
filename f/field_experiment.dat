This was conceptualized after the ERICA <b>field</b> <b>experiment</b> of the late 1980s, which produced observations of intense marine cyclones that indicated an anomalously warm low-level thermal structure, secluded (or surrounded) by a bent-back warm front and a coincident chevron-shaped band of intense surface winds. The Norwegian Cyclone Model, as developed by the Bergen School of Meteorology, largely observed cyclones {{at the tail end}} of their lifecycle and used the term occlusion to identify the decaying stages.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{a team of}} {{scientists}} led by the National Institute of Beekeeping in Bologna, Italy, found pollen obtained from seeds dressed with imidacloprid contain significant levels of the insecticide, and suggested the polluted pollen might cause honey bee colony death. Analysis of maize and sunflower crops originating from seeds dressed with imidacloprid suggest large amounts of the insecticide will be carried back to honey bee colonies. Sublethal doses of imidacloprid in sucrose solution have also been documented to affect homing and foraging activity of honey bees. Imidacloprid in sucrose solution fed to bees in the laboratory impaired their communication for a few hours. Sublethal doses of imidacloprid in laboratory and <b>field</b> <b>experiment</b> decreased flight activity and olfactory discrimination, and olfactory learning performance was impaired.|$|E

40|$|<b>Field</b> <b>experiments</b> {{have grown}} {{significantly}} in prominence {{over the past}} decade. In this essay, we provide {{a summary of the}} major types of <b>field</b> <b>experiments,</b> explore their uses, and describe a few examples. We show how <b>field</b> <b>experiments</b> can be used for both positive and normative purposes within economics. We also discuss more generally why data collection is useful in science, and more narrowly discuss the question of generalizability. In this regard, we envision <b>field</b> <b>experiments</b> playing a classic role in helping investigators learn about the behavioral principles that are shared across different domains...|$|R

Nonetheless, for political scientists, conducting <b>field</b> <b>experiments</b> with elites can seem prohibitively chal-lenging. Drawing on four <b>field</b> <b>experiments</b> with political elites, two in Benin and two in Canada, we outline key lessons on negotiating and conducting <b>field</b> <b>experiments</b> with political elites. Specifically, we outline how ethical concerns can be addressed and overcome. We discuss how the expectations and timelines of campaigns and elites can be managed, particularly when they (appear to conflict) with academic timing and process. Finally, we outline several general concerns about implementation of <b>field</b> <b>experiments</b> and provide some unique solutions...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} project {{focused on a}} status-quo analysis of long-term <b>field</b> <b>experiments</b> for organic farming in Germany, Austria and the German speaking part of Switzerland. The study comprised long-term <b>field</b> <b>experiments</b> with an expected minimum duration of five years. The status-quo analysis categorized the long-term <b>field</b> <b>experiments</b> into four main research fields: a) system comparison, b) production engineering, c) fertilisation and d) soil fertility and further key aspects. All in all, 47 long-term <b>field</b> <b>experiments</b> were identified. The four main research fields chosen were investigated in 20, 24, 27 and 46 long-term <b>field</b> <b>experiments,</b> respectively. The system comparison of the main research fields identified the major research into “conventional versus organic farming” and “organic farming: ‘stocking ratio’ versus stockless” with eight resp. twelve experiments. In production engineering research focused on “soil cultivation” with 14 experiments. Soil fertility and further key aspects, yield and humus formation/humus balance were investigated in 40 resp. 35 <b>field</b> <b>experiments.</b> ...|$|R

25|$|Racial {{discrimination}} in hiring {{has been shown}} to exist in the United States and in Europe. By means of their path breaking <b>field</b> <b>experiment,</b> Marianne Bertrand and Sendhil Mullainathan, showed that applications from job candidates with white-sounding names got 50 percent more callbacks for interviews than those with African-American-sounding names in the United States at the start of this millennium. A 2009 study by Devah Pager, Bruce Western, and Bart Bonikowski found that black applicants to low-wage jobs were half as likely as identically qualified white applicants to receive callbacks or job offers. More recently, Stijn Baert, Bart Cockx, Niels Gheyle and Cora Vandamme replicated and extended their <b>field</b> <b>experiment</b> in Belgium, Europe. They found that racial {{discrimination in}} the labour market is heterogeneous by the labour market tightness in the occupation: compared to natives, candidates with a foreign-sounding name are equally often invited to a job interview in Belgium if they apply for occupations for which vacancies are difficult to fill, but they have to send twice as many applications for occupations for which labor market tightness is low.|$|E
25|$|In the {{discussion}} of special relativity, forces played {{no more than a}} background role. Special relativity assumes the ability to define inertial frames that fill all of spacetime, all of whose clocks run {{at the same rate as}} the clock at the origin. Is this really possible? In a nonuniform gravitational <b>field,</b> <b>experiment</b> dictates that the answer is no. Gravitational fields make it impossible to construct a global inertial frame. In small enough regions of spacetime, local inertial frames are still possible. General relativity involves the systematic stitching together of these local frames into a more general picture of spacetime.|$|E

25|$|One {{source of}} {{evidence}} for hiring discrimination against openly gay men comes from a <b>field</b> <b>experiment</b> that sent two fictitious but realistic resumes to roughly 1,700 entry-level job openings. The two resumes were very similar {{in terms of the}} applicant's qualifications, but one resume for each opening mentioned that the applicant had been part of a gay organization in college. The results showed that applicants without the gay signal had an 11.5 percent chance of being called for an interview; openly gay applicants had only a 7.2 percent chance. The callback gap varied widely according to the location of the job. Most of the overall gap detected in the study was driven by the Southern and Midwestern states in the sample – Texas, Florida, and Ohio. The Western and Northeastern states in the sample (California, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and New York) had only small and statistically insignificant callback gaps.|$|E
25|$|Most recently, Bertness {{and colleagues}} (Bertness et al. 2014b) {{performed}} a <b>field</b> <b>experiment</b> excluding predators from plots on the grazing {{border of the}} marsh. Within one growing season, exclusion of top predators triggered die-off by increasing the abundances of Sesarma crabs {{and the intensity of}} herbivory. To further test the trophic cascade hypothesis, Bertness and colleagues used the spread of die-off into Narragansett Bay to assess all proposed drivers of die-off, including: 1) eutrophication decreases plant investment into belowground biomass causing plant collapse, 2) boat wakes erode creek banks, 3) pollution or disease affect plant health, 4) substrate hardness controls herbivorous crab distributions and 5) trophic dysfunction releases Sesarma from predator control. Nitrogen availability, wave intensity and plant growth did not explain any variation in die-off. However, herbivory explained over 70% of inter-site variation in die-off. (Bertness et al. 2014a) This work highlighted one particular example where top-down interactions were experimentally shown to be the primary driver of ecological community state change.|$|E
500|$|In general, {{honeyeaters}} require extensive {{corridors of}} mature trees along their migratory routes, and flowering woodlands for nesting, {{so they are}} vulnerable {{to the effects of}} land clearing, grazing and weed infestation. The woodland habitat they prefer is considered an endangered ecological community. However, as it is common and widespread, the yellow-faced honeyeater is considered by the IUCN to be of least concern for conservation. A <b>field</b> <b>experiment</b> to determine whether yellow-faced honeyeater nests were less successful in fragmented habitats found nests closer to forest margins actually had a higher success rate than those deeper within the forest. While the yellow-faced honeyeater tends to nest away from the edge of forest remnants, experiments with natural and artificial nests at varying distances from the open areas showed no {{increase in the number of}} avian predators at the forest edge. The experiment results do not support the [...] "ecological trap" [...] and [...] "predator influx" [...] theories and contribute to a belief that fragmented habitats may not be as problematic as previously thought. In some areas the species is considered a pest because of its intrusion into orchards and urban gardens where it damages fruit.|$|E

50|$|<b>Field</b> <b>experiments</b> are {{so named}} to {{distinguish}} them from laboratory experiments, which enforce scientific control by testing a hypothesis in the artificial and highly controlled setting of a laboratory.
