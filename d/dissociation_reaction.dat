We use the cross sections for charmonium dissociation in collisions with pion, rho meson, kaon, vector kaon, and eta meson to calculate dissociation rates of charmonium with the five types of mesons.

However, their instability under humid conditions severely restricts practical use. We {{show that this}} instability and the accompanying reduction of the CO_ 2 uptake capacity of MOF- 74 under humid conditions originate in the water <b>dissociation</b> <b>reaction</b> H_ 2 O→OH+H at the metal centers.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{pressure}} on the <b>dissociation</b> <b>reaction</b> of the TePixD decamer was investigated by high-pressure transient grating (TG). The TG signal intensity representing the <b>dissociation</b> <b>reaction</b> of the TePixD decamer significantly decreased by applying a relatively small pressure. On the other hand, the reaction rate increased with increasing pressure. The equilibrium between the pentamer and the decamer was investigated by high-pressure dynamic light scattering. The results indicated that the fraction of the decamer slightly increased in the high-pressure region. From these measurements, it was concluded that the pressure-dependent signal intensity originated from the decrease of the quantum yield of the <b>dissociation</b> <b>reaction</b> of the decamer, indicating that this reaction efficiency is very sensitive to pressure. Using densimetry at high pressures, the compressibility was found to be pressure dependent even in a relatively low pressure range. We attributed the origin of the pressure-sensitive reaction yield to the decrease of compressibility at high pressure. Because the compressibility is related to the volume fluctuation, this observation suggests that the driving force for this reaction is fluctuation of the protein.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{dissociation}} of CO catalyzed by platinum single crystals. At 40 torr of CO, the Pt(111) crystal dissociates CO at 673 K. Under the same conditions, Pt(100) dissociates CO at 500 K, and Pt(557) dissociates CO at 548 K. Hence, the CO <b>dissociation</b> <b>reaction</b> is a structure sensitive reaction. SFG was used to monitor the CO top site resonance as the platinum crystals were heated to the dissociation temperature when exposed to 40 torr of CO. In all three systems, the CO resonance shifts to lower frequency as the platinum crystal is heated. However, {{the frequency of the}} CO resonance at the dissociation frequency is lower on the (100) and (111) crystal faces than on the Pt(557) crystal. We believe that the (111) and (100) crystal faces must undergo roughening to expose step or kink sites in order to facilitate the <b>dissociation</b> <b>reaction.</b> This is supported by UHV studies of CO dissociation catalyzed by platinum crystals. These studies observe dissociation only when step or kink sites are present. Since the Pt(111) surface is very stable, it needs to be heated to 673 K to produce the low coordination number sites needed for CO dissociation. Since the Pt(100) surface easily reconstructs, it is able to form the active sites for CO dissociation at relatively low temperatures. The SFG spectra support our conclusion that the CO molecules are sitting on low coordination number platinum atoms at the dissociation temperature. Since the Pt(557) surface already has step sites, the <b>dissociation</b> <b>reaction</b> can take place without further roughening of the surface. The CO resonance on the (557) crystal face at the dissociation temperature is at a very similar frequency to CO molecules adsorbed on only the step sites of the crystal. Further studies showed that the <b>dissociation</b> <b>reaction</b> takes place on the (557) surface at CO pressures as low as 1 torr.
