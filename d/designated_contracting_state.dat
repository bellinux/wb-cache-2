5000|$|A {{translation}} of a granted European patent must be filed in some EPC Contracting States to avoid loss of right. Namely, in the Contracting States which have [...] "prescribed {{that if the}} text, in which the European Patent Office intends to grant a European patent (...) is not drawn {{up in one of}} its official languages, the applicant for or proprietor of the patent shall supply to its central industrial property office a {{translation of}} this text in one of its official languages at his option or, where that State has prescribed the use of one specific official language, in that language". The European patent is void ab initio in a <b>designated</b> <b>Contracting</b> <b>State</b> where the required translation (if required) is not filed within the prescribed time limit after grant. In other Contracting States, no translation needs to be filed, for example in Ireland if the European patent is in English. In those Contracting States where the London Agreement is in force the requirement to file a translation of the European patent has been entirely or partially waived. If a translation is required, a fee covering the publication of said translation may be due as well.|$|E
5000|$|During the {{prosecution}} phase, a European patent {{is a single}} regional proceeding, and [...] "the grant of a European patent may be requested for {{one or more of}} the Contracting States." [...] An applicant for a European patent <b>designates</b> those <b>Contracting</b> <b>States</b> in which protection for the invention is desired, [...] and the designations need to be [...] "confirmed" [...] later during the procedure through the payment of designation fees. Once granted by the EPO, a European patent comes into existence effectively as a group of national patents in each of the <b>designated</b> <b>Contracting</b> <b>States.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Once granted, a European patent {{effectively}} {{comes into}} existence {{as a group}} of national patents in each of the <b>designated</b> <b>Contracting</b> <b>States,</b> and the European patent is enforceable on a country-by-country basis. Furthermore, once the 9-month opposition period is terminated, third parties have to institute revocation proceedings in each country in which they wish to invalidate a European patent.|$|R
50|$|A European patent confers {{rights on}} its proprietor, in each <b>Contracting</b> <b>State</b> {{in respect of}} which it is granted, from the date of {{publication}} of the mention of its grant in the European Patent Bulletin. That is also the date of publication of the B1 document, i.e. the European patent specification. This means that the European patent is granted and confers rights in all its <b>designated</b> <b>Contracting</b> <b>States</b> at the date of mention of the grant, whether or not a prescribed translation is filed with a national patent office later on (though the right may later be deemed never to have existed in any particular State if a translation is not subsequently filed in time, as described below).|$|R
2500|$|The patent is {{maintained}} as granted. This is the outcome if {{the opposition is}} rejected or if the Opposition Division decides to discontinue the opposition proceedings. The Opposition Division may decide to discontinue the opposition proceedings notably if the sole opposition or all the oppositions have been withdrawn and the patent proprietor is therefore the only remaining party to the proceedings. The withdrawal of an opposition may result from a settlement reached between the proprietor and the opponent. The opposition proceedings may also be discontinued [...] "f the European patent has been surrendered in all the <b>designated</b> <b>Contracting</b> <b>States</b> or has lapsed in all those States".|$|R
5000|$|Article III of the {{convention}} outlines the responsibilities that the entire process must be authorized by central adoption authorities <b>designated</b> by the <b>contracting</b> <b>states</b> [...] If fully implemented at the national level, the Convention offers a protective framework against the potential risks of private adoption (when the adoptive parents set {{the terms of the}} adoption directly with the biological parents or with children's institutions placed in the country of origin, without recurring to accredited adoption service providers).|$|R
5000|$|The Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) of 1970 is an {{international}} treatise participated upon by 148 member nations that allows applicants to simultaneously apply for patent protection for an invention within the participating countries. The Philippines was bound to the treaty on August 17, 2001. The international patent application is available to citizens or residents of the participating states by accomplishing the application at their respective national patent office or at the WIPO International Bureau. Accomplishing the application [...] "has the effect of automatically <b>designating</b> all <b>Contracting</b> <b>States</b> bound by the PCT on the international filing date. The effect of the international application is the same in each designated State as if a national patent application had been filed with the national patent office of that State." ...|$|R
50|$|The Convention also {{requires}} that all processes should be authorized by central adoption authorities <b>designated</b> by the <b>contracting</b> <b>states.</b> (Chapter III of the Convention outlines {{the roles and}} responsibilities of this authority.) If fully implemented at the national level, the Convention offers also a protective framework against the risks potentially implied in private adoption (when the adoptive parents set {{the terms of the}} adoption directly with the birth parents or with children's institutions placed in the country of origin, without recurring to accredited adoption service providers).|$|R

40|$|This report {{develops}} {{an economic}} model {{that provides the}} theoretical framework for the econometric analyses presented in the report's companion volume, WIC and the Retail Price of Infant Formula (FANRR- 39). The model examines supermarket retail prices for infant formula in a local market area, and identifies the theoretical effects of the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) and its infant formula rebate program. Special attention {{is given to the}} rebate program's sole-source procurement system by which a single manufacturer becomes a State's "contract brand"-the State's one supplier of formula to WIC infants-in exchange for paying rebates to WIC. When a manufacturer's brand is <b>designated</b> a <b>State's</b> <b>contract</b> brand, the model predicts that supermarkets increase that brand's retail price. The model also predicts that an increase in the ratio of WIC to non-WIC formula-fed infants in a local market results in an increase in the price of the contract brand and, through demand substitution, a relatively small price increase for noncontract brands.

On March 17, 2008, Chicago based CME Group signed a definitive agreement to acquire NYMEX Holdings, Inc. for $11.2 billion in cash and stock and the takeover was completed in August 2008.

40|$|Although the Refugee Convention 1951 {{generally}} {{provided that}} <b>contracting</b> <b>states</b> should recognise {{those who came}} within its definition as refugees, it did not prescribe how <b>contracting</b> <b>states</b> should determine this in order {{to enable them to}} balance this obligation with their national interests. However, evidence from the background and drafting of the Refugee Convention 1951 suggests that the provisions that a <b>contracting</b> <b>states</b> would implement in order to protect its interests would be commensurate with the human rights spirit of the treaty. This implied that <b>contracting</b> <b>states</b> would act fairly in balancing the competing interests in devising status determination policies and would take into account decent considerations. But, from a theoretical viewpoint, it is arguable that some recent asylum determination policies have been based on the threats posed by asylum seekers.
