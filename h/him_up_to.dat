5|$|A {{slightly}} variant way of executing {{people by}} means of impalement was to force an iron meat hook beneath a person's ribs and hang <b>him</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> die slowly. This technique was in 18th century Ottoman-controlled Bosnia called the cengela, but the practice is also attested, for example, in 1770s Dutch Suriname as a punishment meted out to rebellious slaves.|$|E
5|$|The Phillies called <b>him</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> {{the major}} leagues and he became the team's {{starting}} third baseman in 2014. Many compare his playing style, particularly his demeanor and work ethic, to that of former Phillies' teammate Chase Utley. As a hitter, he is better as a contact hitter than a power hitter; defensively, he has improved, which has drawn accolades from former Phillies manager Ryne Sandberg.|$|E
5|$|As a {{consequence}} of the race, Hamilton extended his lead in the World Drivers' Championship to be seven points ahead of Button. This ensured the pair would enter the next, and their home race - the British Grand Prix - as first and second in the championship. Vettel's victory moved <b>him</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> third in standings; he became six points behind Button after surpassing the totals of teammate Mark Webber and Fernando Alonso. By gaining the most points from the race, McLaren extended their lead in the World Constructors' Championship to thirty over Red Bull.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the points}} won by Moreno's second-place finish, Katusha {{were not able}} to win enough points to win the UCI World Tour rankings. The 60 points that Valverde won were enough to secure the overall victory in the team's competition, as well as {{increasing}} his own margin of victory in the individual classification. Pinot's third-place finish earned him 70 points and moved <b>him</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> tenth place in the World Tour rankings, while the success of the Italian riders moved Italy ahead of both Colombia and Great Britain to finish second behind Spain in the national rankings.|$|E
5|$|Hussein Saeed {{started playing}} {{football}} {{in the streets}} before joining Al-Iskan's youth center. He led them to an Iraq Youth Centers' Championship, scoring a hat-trick in a 4–2 win against Al-Zawra'a youth team and catching the eye of Dawoud Al-Azzawi, {{the manager of the}} Iraq national under-17 football team and Iraq national varsity football team. Al-Azzawi called <b>him</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the varsity team and, in his first competitive tournament with the team, he won the gold medal in the 1975 Arab Schools Games in Egypt.|$|E
5|$|Sánchez rebounded to turn {{in another}} strong ride on Alpe d'Huez in stage 19. He, along with Contador and Pierre Rolland formed the leading group {{on the way up}} the climb. Contador, who had been riding out front much of the stage after an early attack, faded first and {{finished}} the day in third place. Rolland eventually rode away from Sánchez for the stage win, but Sánchez' second place on the day moved <b>him</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> seventh overall, and back into the mountains classification lead. Sánchez, as well as Contador, moved up a place in the stage 20 individual time trial. Damiano Cunego, who had been in fifth place and is considered a poor time trialist, had a bad race against the clock even by his standards, losing two minutes to most of the race's top overall riders and more than three to the stage winner. This moved <b>him</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> sixth place overall, the position in which he concluded the race the next day, while also finishing as mountains classification winner.|$|E

5|$|There {{were four}} cautions, totalling 12 laps during the race. It was Dixon's first win {{of the season}} and the 28th of his career, which moved <b>him</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> second in the drivers' standings. Of the 25 drivers that started, 19 {{completed}} the race, two retired after contact and four retired due to mechanical issues. Justin Wilson recorded the fastest lap of the race, completing a circuit in 1:12.0651.|$|E
5|$|When Manchester City {{returned}} to the Premier League for the 2000–01 season, it appeared that Dickov's chances of playing would be limited as City signed former FIFA World Player of the Year George Weah and Costa Rican international Paulo Wanchope. However, Dickov earned {{a place in the}} team, his performances attracting the attention of Scotland manager Craig Brown, who called <b>him</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the Scotland squad for the first time.|$|E
5|$|When Nancy is {{diagnosed}} with multiple schlerosis, Darren struggles {{to support her}} and the kids financially and begins selling cannabis with Kyle. However, when the drugs are found in Darren's attick, he and Ryan set <b>him</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> take the fall. Kyle is then sent to prison and manipulates Darren to continue selling cannabis with Shane or he'll tell Nancy everything. But when Tom and Alfie find the drugs and dispose of them, Shane is angry and tells Darren he must transport heroin for him. Darren is sentence to 6 months in prison.|$|E

5|$|After {{departing from}} the bus, Peter goes off as Spider-Man to an armored truck, which Sandman is robbing. In their struggle, the truck {{goes out of}} control and lands in a {{construction}} site. When Spider-Man tries to web him up, it proves to be ineffective as Sandman can slip through them; the villain then starts to attack Spider-Man with girders. Meanwhile, at the soda shop, Harry tries to impress the jocks, catching Kenny's girlfriend Glory's attention. Kenny plays a prank on Harry, which enrages Glory and she asks Harry to take her home. Back on the construction site, Spider-Man gets out from the pile of girders and gets the head on Sandman. He lures <b>him</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the roof and encasing him in cement from the nearby cement maker.|$|E
5|$|As the Giro left Austria, {{the race}} began {{to enter the}} Dolomites during stage fourteen. The {{eventual}} stage winner Marco Pantani was in a chasing group on the final climb of the stage, the Passo di Monte Giovo. He attacked, bridged the gap to the leading group, and left them behind to claim his first professional victory of his career. The next stage saw Pantani win again after he rode away from the attack group on the last climb of the Valico di Santa Cristina and he then soloed to the finish in Stradella. Pantani's efforts on the day moved <b>him</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> second overall in the race. The race's sixteenth stage took {{a break from the}} mountains with the stage being primarily fled, which ultimately led to the sprint finish that was won by Italian Maximilian Sciandri. Ján Svorada won the next day's stage after attacking from the breakaway group in the closing seconds.|$|E
5|$|Cú Chulainn {{has many}} lovers, but Emer's only jealousy comes when he {{falls in love}} with Fand, wife of Manannán mac Lir. Manannán has left her and she has been {{attacked}} by three Fomorians who want to control the Irish Sea. Cú Chulainn agrees to help defend her as long as she marries him. She agrees reluctantly, but they fall in love when they meet. Manannán knows their relationship is doomed because Cú Chulainn is mortal and Fand is a fairy; Cú Chulainn's presence would destroy the fairies. Emer, meanwhile, tries to kill her rival, but when she sees the strength of Fand's love for Cú Chulainn she decides to give <b>him</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> her. Fand, touched by Emer's magnanimity, decides to return to her own husband. Manannan shakes his cloak between Cú Chulainn and Fand, ensuring the two will never meet again, and Cú Chulainn and Emer drink a potion to wipe the whole affair from their memories.|$|E

5|$|Fearful {{that the}} Pandes would re-establish their power, Fatte Jang Shah, Rangnath Poudel, and the Junior Queen Rajya Laxmi Devi {{obtained}} from the King the liberation of Bhimsen, Mathabar, {{and the rest of}} the party, about eight months after they were incarcerated for the poisoning case. Some of their confiscated land as well as the Bagh Durbar was also returned. Upon his release, the soldiers loyal to Bhimsen crowded behind him in jubilation and followed <b>him</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> his house; a similar treatment was given to Mathabar Singh and Sherjung Thapa. Although pardon had been granted to Bhimsen, his former office was not re-instated; thus he went to live in retirement at his patrimony in Borlang, Gorkha.|$|E
5|$|Following the Draft, the 1994–95 NHL {{season was}} {{suspended}} for three-and-a-half months due to a labour dispute between NHL players and owners. Consequently, Jovanovski remained in junior {{for the beginning of}} the 1994–95 OHL season. When NHL was set to resume play in January 1995, it was speculated that the Panthers might sign Jovanovski and call <b>him</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the NHL. However, then-Panthers General Manager Bryan Murray announced that Jovanovski would remain with Windsor, citing that he would likely not receive much playing time with the club. He averaged approximately 40 minutes per game with Windsor that season, scoring 23 goals and 65 points over 50 contests. He also added nine points in nine playoff games before Windsor was eliminated. Jovanovski was named to the OHL First All-Star Team.|$|E
5|$|Immediately after filming Basic Instinct 2, {{he began}} work on The Reaping (2007) in Louisiana, in which he played science teacher Doug Blackwell {{opposite}} Hilary Swank. The role had been offered to him quite late in pre-production, and he flew to Baton Rouge the Monday after Basic Instinct 2 wrapped. He took the role {{because he was a}} fan of Swank, and Hopkins' film The Life and Death of Peter Sellers (2004), and he preferred the thriller aspect of the Reaping script above the horror aspect. After a week of filming, production had to be suspended when Hurricane Katrina hit the state. He found the filming schedule quite demanding, particularly the three weeks of night filming and a scene in which his character is attacked by a plague of locusts, most of which were computer-generated in post-production but some were real on camera. The Reaping was released in 2007 and performed badly in cinemas. Despite the failures of both films, Morrissey was grateful that they opened <b>him</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> more film offers from Hollywood.|$|E

5|$|In 1993, Hamilton {{was ranked}} {{as the second}} best {{prospect}} in the Padres organization. He {{was sent to the}} Padres' affiliate, the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes. One of Hamilton's teammates with the Quakes was 17-year-old and future All-Star Derrek Lee. During his time with the Quakes, he went 10 with a 4.09 ERA in 11 innings during two starts. The Padres then called <b>him</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> their Double-A affiliate, the Wichita Wranglers. In Wichita, Hamilton had four wins and nine losses with a 3.97 ERA in 15 starts. After a combined 39 appearances during two seasons, Hamilton was called up to Triple-A Las Vegas. With Las Vegas he went 32 with a 4.40 ERA in eight starts.|$|E
5|$|It took Đurić three {{personal}} attempts {{before he}} received his Singaporean citizenship on 27 September 2007 as he {{was not on the}} Football Association of Singapore's Foreign Sports Talent Scheme. Despite obtaining his Singapore passport for non-footballing reasons, coach Radojko Avramović called <b>him</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the Singapore national team on 1 November 2007. He made his international debut at the age of 37 years and 89 days against Tajikistan in the first leg of {{the second round of the}} 2010 World Cup qualifiers on 9 November, contributing with an immediate impact by scoring both goals in a 2–0 victory. Đurić started the match following injuries to attacking midfielder Shi Jiayi and striker Indra Shahdan Daud. The result coupled with a 1–1 draw in the second leg meant that Singapore progressed to the third round of the Asian Qualifying Tournament for the first time, where they were drawn against Saudi Arabia, Lebanon and Uzbekistan. He continued his fine form on the international stage, scoring against Lebanon and Uzbekistan as Singapore finished third in Group 4.|$|E
5|$|Males {{sexually mature}} {{at the age}} of 15, but do not {{typically}} reproduce until age 21. Wild males live around 29 years on average, with a maximum of about 60 years. One male, known as Old Tom, was reportedly spotted every winter between the 1840s and 1930 off New South Wales, Australia. This would have made <b>him</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 90 years old. Examination of his teeth indicated he died around age 35, but this method of age determination is now believed to be inaccurate for older animals. One male known to researchers in the Pacific Northwest (identified as J1) was estimated to have been 59 years old when he died in 2010.|$|E
