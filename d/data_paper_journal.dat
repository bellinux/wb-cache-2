40|$|The {{process of}} {{compiling}} and submitting <b>data</b> <b>papers</b> to <b>journals</b> {{has long been}} a frustrating one to the minority of researchers that have tried. Fiona Murphy, part of a project team working to automate this process, outlines why publishing <b>data</b> <b>papers</b> is important and how open data can be of benefit to all stakeholders across scholarly communications and higher education...|$|R
50|$|Scientific Data is a peer-reviewed {{open access}} {{scientific}} journal {{published by the}} Nature Publishing Group since 2014. It focuses on descriptions of data sets relevant to the natural sciences, which are provided as machine readable data, complemented with a human oriented narrative. The journal {{was not the first}} to publish <b>data</b> <b>papers,</b> but is one of few journals that purely publish <b>data</b> <b>papers.</b> The <b>journal</b> is abstracted and indexed by Index Medicus/MEDLINE/PubMed.|$|R
40|$|Selection of {{the best}} {{alternative}} for treatment of low-level mixed waste (LLMW) involves implementation of many steps. In addition to cost, other factors have to be considered. The objectives of this paper are 1) develop costs for treatment alternatives, and 2) develop multiobjective criteria {{for the evaluation of}} each treatment process. Costs are obtained from government documents, technical project <b>data,</b> <b>papers,</b> <b>journals</b> and professional contacts. The multiobjective evaluation criteria includes: volume reduction, resource recovery, energy efficiency, simplicity of process, health risks, and costs. By assigning weighted values to each criterion, a comparison is made between the treatment processes for different types of contaminants. The results identify which treatments are more desirable. There are also other factors that may influence the actual selection of an alternative and may impact the final cost. Those factors may increase cost significantly or cancel the use of a chosen treatment...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss {{globalization}} 2 ̆ 7 s impacts on the world 2 ̆ 7 s financial characteristics today. The findings inform that globalization promotes entrepreneurship because through globalization, financial markets have grown to be more efficient and flexible which can be seen through lower transaction costs, less binding financial regulations than before, less governments 2 ̆ 7 intervention within private sector and national economy structures, increasing number of market participants which leads to more access to information. Thus, globalization does create a better environment for entrepreneurs in achieving their competitive advantages and further to sustain them. This research was done by collecting <b>data</b> from <b>papers,</b> <b>journals,</b> modules, and internet databases. The data was analyzed and then concluded. Having applied the analytical process, it can be concluded that globalization does promotes entrepreneurship because it enables entrepreneurs to gain greater benefits at a certain degree of freedom than before in order to achieve and maintain their competitive advantages...|$|R
40|$|Scientific {{journals}} {{can capture}} a scholar’s research career. A researcher’s publication data often reflects his/her research interests and their social relations. It is demonstrated that scientist collaboration networks {{can be constructed}} based on co-authorship <b>data</b> from <b>journal</b> <b>papers.</b> The problem with such a network is that researchers are limited within their professional social network. This work proposes the idea of constructing a researcher’s social network based on data harvested from metadata of scientific publications and personal online profiles. We hypothesize that data, such as...|$|R
40|$|There {{are several}} simple and {{sophisticated}} scientometric indicators generally {{applied in the}} literature (e. g. total number of publications and citations, citations per <b>journal</b> <b>paper,</b> relative citedness indexes, Hirsch index, etc.), which may characterize the publications of scientists both qualitatively and quantitatively. The calculation methods generally use data referring to the total set of papers studied. Scientific progress, how-ever, may be attributed primarily to information in the highly cited publications. Therefore, a new indicator (π-index) is suggested for comparative assessment of scientists active in similar subject fields. The π-index is equal to one hundredth {{of the number of}} citations obtained to the top square root {{of the total number of}} jour-nal papers (‘elite set of papers’) ranked by the decreasing number of citations. The relation of the π-index to other indexes and its dependence on the field is studied, using <b>data</b> of <b>journal</b> <b>papers</b> of ‘highly cited researchers’...|$|R
40|$|Using bibliometric {{data for}} the {{evaluation}} of the research of institutions and individuals is becoming increasingly common. Bibliometric evaluations across disciplines require that the data be normalized to the field because the fields are very different in their citation processes. Generally, the major bibliographic databases such as Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus are used for this but they have the disadvantage of limited coverage in the social science and humanities. Coverage in Google Scholar (GS) is much better but GS has less reliable data and fewer bibliometric tools. This paper tests a method for GS normalization developed by Bornmann et al. (J Assoc Inf Sci Technol 67 : 2778 – 2789, 2016) on an alternative set of <b>data</b> involving <b>journal</b> <b>papers,</b> book chapters and conference papers. The results show that GS normalization is possible although at the moment it requires extensive manual involvement in generating and validating the data. A comparison of the normalized results for <b>journal</b> <b>papers</b> with WoS <b>data</b> shows a high degree of convergent validity. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The Medical Article Records System (MARS) {{developed}} by the Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications uses scanning, OCR and automated recognition and reformatting algorithms to generate electronic bibliographic citation <b>data</b> from <b>paper</b> biomedical <b>journal</b> articles. The multi-engine OCR server incorporated in MARS performs well in general, but fares less well with text printed in small or italic fonts. Affiliations are often printed in small italic fonts in the journals processed by MARS. Consequently, although the automatic processes generate much of the citation data correctly, the affiliation field frequently contains incorrect data, which must be manually corrected by verification operators. In contrast, author names are usually printed in large, normal fonts that are correctly converted to text by the OCR server. The National Library of Medicine's MEDLINE ® database contains 11 million indexed citations for biomedical <b>journal</b> articles. This <b>paper</b> documents our effort to use the historical author, affiliation relationships from this large dataset to find potential correct affiliations for MARS articles based on the author and the affiliation in the OCR output.
