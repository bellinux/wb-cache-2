5|$|Banksia ericifolia 'Bronzed Aussie' is a white-budded terminal-flowering form to 2m with bronzed foliage; the inflorescences have honey-coloured pistils. It {{has been}} {{propagated}} by Victorian nurseryman Rod Parsons of Carawah Nursery in Hoddles Creek. A new release in 2003, its provenance is unknown; seed <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> Rod's father by an SGAP member many years ago.|$|E
5|$|Círdan (Shipwright) is the epessë of a Telerin Elf who {{remained}} in Beleriand, and later Lindon, {{until the end of}} the Third Age. His original name was only rarely remembered in traditions as Nōwē, and he was referred to always as Círdan, a title which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> him as Lord of the Falas.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, {{there was}} a state {{proposal}} to remove SR 209 from the state highway system, which the City of San Diego objected to. However, SR 209 was deleted from the system in 2003, and <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> the City of San Diego in 2001.|$|E

500|$|Because of {{the ease}} of finding maximal cliques, and their {{potential}} small size, [...] more attention <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> the much harder algorithmic problem of finding a maximum or otherwise large clique than <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> the problem of finding a single maximal clique.|$|R
5|$|The {{declaration}} {{represented the}} first public support for Zionism by a major political power – its publication galvanized Zionism, which finally had obtained an official charter. In addition to its publication in major newspapers, leaflets were circulated throughout Jewish communities. These leaflets were airdropped over Jewish communities in Germany and Austria, {{as well as the}} Pale of Settlement, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> the Central Powers following the Russian withdrawal.|$|E
5|$|Akizzi {{contacted}} Egypt {{and declared}} himself a servant to the pharaoh. An anti-Hittite coalition, probably organized by Akizzi, was established. Šuppiluliuma tried diplomatic means {{to solve the}} conflict but Akizzi rejected them. Hittite military intervention soon followed and Akizzi asked Egypt for troops, but received none. Šuppiluliuma himself came to Qatna, aided by Aziru of Amurru. The Hittite monarch took with him a statue of the sun deity, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> Qatna by an ancestor of Akhenaten. This move symbolized the final capitulation of the kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Controversy {{surrounds}} the breakout {{before the last}} stand—which various writers have posited might have actually been desertion—and a box of gold sovereigns, which a Matabele inDuna (leader) later claimed <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> two unidentified men from Forbes's rear guard on 2 December, along with a message that Lobengula admitted defeat and wanted the column to stop pursuing him. Two batmen were initially found guilty of accepting the gold, keeping it for themselves and not passing on the message, but the evidence against them was inconclusive and largely circumstantial; the convictions were ultimately overturned.|$|E

50|$|One {{reason why}} sock monkeys are popular is that sock monkeys {{are said to}} be good luck charms, and as a result, people offer sock monkeys as gifts. Sock monkeys <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> {{patients}} in hospitals as a symbol of a quick recovery. They <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> employees to relieve stress and sock monkeys <b>have</b> even <b>been</b> sent to soldiers overseas to relieve homesickness.|$|R

5|$|Despite his pessimism {{expressed}} to the Dutch {{government and the}} mandate he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> surrender the Army, General Winkelman awaited the outcome of events, avoiding actually capitulating until it was absolutely necessary. In this he was perhaps motivated {{by a desire to}} engage the opposing German troops for as long as possible, to assist the Allied war effort. In the early morning of 14 May, though the situation remained critical, a certain calm was evident in the Dutch Headquarters.|$|E
5|$|In 1916 the Russian {{government}} decided to reinforce its naval strength outside the Baltic and Black Seas. As Japan and Russia were allies during the war, the Japanese government sold Tango {{and some other}} ex-Russian warships back to Russia in March. The battleship arrived at Vladivostok on 2 April and {{was turned over to}} the Russians on either 3 or 4 April. Her former name <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> the new dreadnought battleship Poltava, so Tango was renamed Chesma, after the 1770 Battle of Chesma. She departed Vladivostok on 2 July and arrived at Port Said, Egypt, on 19 September.|$|E
5|$|In September 1939, as {{with most}} other aspects of A/S, no clear plan existed for the {{armament}} of Coastal Command's aircraft. While operational control {{was given to the}} Admiralty, the faith of both services in ASDIC proved ill-founded. It ruled out the submarine threat, and caused a refocusing on surface attacks. In addition, no A/S weapons had been developed properly in the inter-war period. Most of the munitions were left over from the First World War, due in part to a wish to economise and the fact no order <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> dispose of them.|$|E

5|$|On July 22, 1983, {{martial law}} was lifted, and amnesty was granted to many imprisoned Solidarity members, who were released. On October 5, Wałęsa {{was awarded the}} Nobel Peace Prize. The Polish government, however, refused to issue him a {{passport}} to travel to Oslo; Wałęsa's prize was accepted on his behalf by his wife. It later transpired that the SB had prepared bogus documents, accusing Wałęsa of immoral and illegal activities that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> the Nobel committee {{in an attempt to}} derail his nomination.|$|E
5|$|The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies made {{an appeal}} for almost 6million Swiss francs ($4.8million, 2006USD) to assist {{stricken}} {{families in the}} PRC. As of August 11, 2006, about 1.8million Chinese yuan ($220,000) worth of relief items and financial assistance <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> the victims. The PRC government also allocated 120million yuan ($15.2million) for disaster relief in areas affected by Saomai and earlier storms. The funds were used to provide food and water for displaced victims and pay for the rebuilding effort in Zhejiang and Fujian.|$|E
5|$|The River Weaver is a river, navigable in {{its lower}} reaches, {{running in a}} curving route {{anti-clockwise}} across west Cheshire, northern England. Improvements to the river to make it navigable were authorised in 1720 and the work, which included eleven locks, was completed in 1732. An unusual clause in the enabling Act of Parliament stipulated that profits {{should be given to}} the County of Cheshire for the improvement of roads and bridges, but the navigation was not initially profitable, and it was 1775 before the first payments were made. Trade continued to rise, and by 1845, over £500,000 <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> the county.|$|E

5|$|The young Harriet {{spent much}} of her {{childhood}} at the family home at Fulbeck Hall in Lincolnshire, sited high on the limestone hills above Grantham. The house, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> Henry Fane by his father, was a not over-large modern mansion at the time of Arbuthnot's childhood. It was rebuilt following a fire in 1733, and further extended and modernised in 1784 by Henry Fane. At Fulbeck Harriet and her 13 siblings enjoyed a comfortable and reasonably affluent rural childhood.|$|E
5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 12th century the former {{territory}} of the kingdom of the Rhinns was part of Galloway kingdom, but the area to the north was not. Strathgryfe, Kyle and Cunningham had come {{under the control of the}} Scottish king in the early 12th century, much of it given over to soldiers of French or Anglo-French origin. Strathgryfe and most of Kyle <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> Walter fitz Alan under King David I, with Hugh de Morville taking Cunningham. Strathnith still had a Gaelic ruler (ancestor of the famous Thomas Randolph, 1st Earl of Moray), but he was not part of the kingdom of Galloway. The rest of the region—the Rhinns, Farines, Carrick, Desnes Mór and Desnes Ioan, and the sparsely settled uplands of Glenken—was probably under the control of the sons of Fergus, King of Galloway, in the years before Donnchadh's career in the region.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, she bombarded German fortifications {{during the}} Siege of Tsingtao. The Japanese {{government}} sold Tango {{back to the}} Russians at their request in 1916. She was renamed Chesma (Чесма) as her former name <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> a new ship. En route to the White Sea, she joined an Allied force that persuaded the Greek government to disarm their ships. Her crew declared for the Bolsheviks in October 1917, but {{made no effort to}} resist when the British decided to intervene in the Russian Civil War in early 1918. In poor condition, the ship was used as a prison hulk. Abandoned by the British when they withdrew in 1919 and recaptured by the Bolsheviks, she was scrapped in 1924.|$|E

5|$|Fairley tackled an {{outbreak}} of bacilliary dysentery among the troops in Egypt. In most cases the patients recovered {{of their own accord}} but some cases of shigellosis became seriously ill and died. Fairley had some Shiga anti-toxin with him, but it proved ineffective in serious cases, even when administered in large doses. However, he also had an experimental supply of sulphaguanidine that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> him by Dr E. K. Marshall of Johns Hopkins Hospital. The drug was administered to a patient with severe shigellosis who was not expected to live, and the patient soon recovered. Of the 21,015 Australian soldiers who contracted bacilliary dysentery during the Second World War, only 21 died.|$|E
5|$|Returning to naval service {{some months}} after the action, Harvey was given the 80-gun HMS Tonnant as his first flagship, in which he {{remained}} until 1809. Serving under Lord Gambier in the Channel Fleet, Harvey was outraged not to be given command of the British ships in action at the Battle of Basque Roads. Harvey expressed his disgust that command <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> the more junior Lord Cochrane {{in no uncertain terms}} to Gambier, and was dismissed from the admiral's council as a result. When the operation was initially successful, Gambier refused to support Cochrane and as a result an opportunity to annihilate the French Atlantic Fleet was lost. The ensuing dispute lasted years and involved a court martial that eventually acquitted Gambier, and only ended with Cochrane's dismissal from the service five years later.|$|E
5|$|The {{extensive}} campaigning abroad by Rome, and the rewarding {{of soldiers}} with plunder from those campaigns, {{led to the}} trend of soldiers becoming increasingly loyal to their commanders {{rather than to the}} state, and a willingness to follow their generals in battle against the state. Rome was plagued by several slave uprisings during this period, in part because in the past century vast tracts of land <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> veterans who farmed by use of slaves and who came to greatly outnumber their Roman masters. In the last century BC, at least twelve civil wars and rebellions occurred. This pattern did not break until Octavian (later Caesar Augustus) ended it by becoming a successful challenger to the Senate's authority, and was made princeps (emperor).|$|E

Jelme's father Jarchiudai again <b>gives</b> his son <b>to</b> Temujin when Temujin was meeting with the Wang Khan. The reason for Jelme's <b>having</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> Genghis <b>is</b> unclear.|$|R
