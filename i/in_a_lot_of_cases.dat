25|$|We’re {{so lucky}} to have gotten here, and if we {{look back on the}} fact that we were on Capitol Records at a certain point, being {{distributed}} and making these albums under budget… there was one year when we were the only band on the label to profit, when MC Hammer lost a shitload of money. I can still appreciate how odd it was that we had the chance to do that because it doesn’t really happen <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases.</b>|$|E
25|$|In general, non-medical use of {{morphine}} entails taking more than prescribed or outside of medical supervision, injecting oral formulations, mixing it with unapproved potentiators such as alcohol, cocaine, and the like, or defeating the extended-release mechanism by chewing the tablets or {{turning into a}} powder for snorting or preparing injectables. The latter method can be as time-consuming and involved as traditional methods of smoking opium. This {{and the fact that}} the liver destroys a large percentage of the drug on the first pass impacts the demand side of the equation for clandestine re-sellers, as many customers are not needle users and may have been disappointed with ingesting the drug orally. As morphine is generally as hard or harder to divert than oxycodone <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases,</b> morphine in any form is uncommon on the street, although ampoules and phials {{of morphine}} injection, pure pharmaceutical morphine powder, and soluble multi-purpose tablets are very popular where available.|$|E
500|$|Of his law {{practice}} in Manchester, Combs later noted: [...] "I {{had too many}} kinfolks and friends in Manchester, and they all expected me to handle things as a favor... Then they'd get their feelings hurt if I charged them. I was taking <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases,</b> but not sending out many bills." [...] In 1938, Combs accepted an offer from a law school classmate named LeRoy Combs (no relation) to join his father and uncle's law firm in Prestonsburg. Prestonsburg was closer to his wife's home in Knott County. Combs' son Tommy suffered from a form of mental retardation, {{the result of an}} injury sustained at birth. After moving to Prestonsburg, Combs started a class for people with mental retardation, in part so Tommy could attend the class.|$|E

2500|$|Enigk confessed in an {{interview}} in December 2008 that because the band had already broken up during the recording of LP2, he and Hoerner never sat down to complete the lyrics; [...] "We broke up and we just felt like we were done. We put no energy into the artwork or into anything. On a lot of songs, there aren’t lyrics! <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases,</b> we never sat down to write them, because we just wanted {{to get it out of}} the way as fast as possible.

2500|$|The {{districts of}} Kohistan, Mahmud Raqi, and Kohband districts, {{all of which}} are Jamiat-i Islami and almost all Tajik, have become {{targeted}} zones of interest for the insurgency. Because they are close enough to Kabul, the militants count attacks there as attacks in Kabul. Whilst the districts of Tagab, Alasay and Nijrab are Hizb-i Islami Gulbuddin supporters and are a mixture of Pashtuns, Tajiks and Pashai. [...] The importance of Kapisa comes as it lies along the approach to the Panjshir River valley and most of the major Jamiat figures have managed to secure wealth and power in the post-2001 Afghanistan, while most of the HiG figures have not. As a result, most of the violence in the area is not actually “Taliban” as we would normally consider it, but HiG fighters (and <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> petty thugs) calling themselves Taliban.|$|E
2500|$|To be honest, I wasn't {{very smart}} about things. At that stage I was still {{averaging}} 40 after nine Tests {{or so and}} with the Packer players away, {{most of the other}} guys in the Aussie Test team were very new to the team. I thought {{it was up to me}} to compete with the Packer boys. When the Packer catchcry was [...] "Lillee getting wickets and Hookesy clearing pickets" [...] I felt that anyone who was coming to watch me play needed to be entertained. I probably played more aggressively than I should have. My feeling was I wanted to give the crowd something to look at when they came in the gates. I should have been more circumspect. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> I was happy to get out for 30 or 40. But I felt we needed to compete with WSC boys.|$|E

50|$|However, an {{important}} factor {{that has to be}} kept in mind while analyzing binding between the host and the guest is the time taken for data acquisition compared to the time for the binding event. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases,</b> the binding events are much faster than the time-scale of data acquisition, in which case the output is an averaged signal for the individual molecules and the complex.

50|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the fighting in Korea Australian soldiers were then sent to Malaya for the Emergency.
