50|$|The <b>grinding</b> <b>stock</b> is fed to {{the mill}} via an inlet box and is pre-crushed by the tools {{on top of}} the rotor. The precrushing tools also carry the product into the milling zone {{at the side of the}} rotor. There the <b>grinding</b> <b>stock</b> is {{fluidised}} in the air stream between rotor and stator caused by rotation and the U-shaped grinding tools. The special design of these tools creates massive air whirls in the grinding zone (this is where the name of the mill comes from). These air whirls cause the main grinding effect. The particles collide with each other in these whirlwinds. The final particle size can be adjusted by changing the clearance between rotor and stator, air flow and rotor speed.|$|E
50|$|The {{product to}} be {{processed}} is fed to the mill centrally via an inlet box {{at the top and}} is pre-crushed by primary beater tools when reaching the top of the rotor. The beaters also accelerate the product, moving it into the milling zone proper, {{at the side of the}} rotor. There the <b>grinding</b> <b>stock</b> fluidised in the air flow is comminuted by the grinding tools (rotor, stator). The stator is formed by a cover enclosing the rotor. The inside of this cover is provided with toothed grooves running vertical, i.e. crosswise to the sense of rotation of the rotor. The outside of the rotor is covered by numerous U-shaped sections which form a deep cassette-type structure. This geometry creates extreme air whirls in the rotor's grinding zone which induce intense secondary comminution processes due to the particles crashing into each other and due to friction and shearing forces. The final particle size can be adjusted over a wide range by changing the grinding rotor clearance, air flow and rotor speed.|$|E

50|$|The Swiss Army Knife is {{an example}} of a knife with a primary bevel and an edge bevel. By contrast, a blade {{composed}} of a single flat <b>grind</b> from <b>stock</b> thickness to the cutting edge is known as a 'full flat ground' blade. The cutting properties of a blade are determined by the type of metal, the hardness of the blade, and the grinding pattern (e.g. convex, concave, teardrop).|$|R
50|$|Glidcop {{material}} is often acquired {{with a layer}} of cladding, typically 10-15 % of the cross-sectional area of the stock piece, though this varies depending on the production process. The cladding, which is a remnant of the extrusion process often used with Glidcop, must be machined (usually by milling or <b>grinding)</b> off the <b>stock</b> piece in order {{to take full advantage of}} the Glidcop properties. After the cladding is removed, machining and working with Glidcop is similar to that of pure copper.|$|R

A new main {{building}} {{was completed in}} 1967, incorporating a former stock warehouse, and measuring 500 by 59 ft in plan and more than 18 ft high, with a further 200-foot long bay containing the new heat treatment workshop. This building contained several large furnaces, using butane in a first for the city. This allowed many buildings {{to be put to}} new uses: the south-east crucible shops as stores, the heat treatment workshop as a <b>stock</b> <b>grinding</b> plant, and the steel working shop as an annealing and cleaning plant. [...] The gas-fired crucible furnaces and the gas plant were demolished, but English Heritage believe that substantial remains of these exist below ground.|$|R
30|$|Interestingly, if Φ MB {{was changed}} from 0.21 to 0.3, a huge {{difference}} in the measured heating curve was observed. As the amount of <b>grinding</b> <b>stock</b> was kept constant at Φ GS =  0.15, we calculated Φ GS, rel (Eq.  3) defined as the <b>grinding</b> <b>stock</b> filling degree with regard to the void volume in the milling ball packing. The complete void volume is filled with the <b>grinding</b> <b>stock</b> if Φ GS, rel =  1. Results show that the change in the heat up curve occurs if Φ GS, rel is approximately at this value. The milling beakers warm up significantly slower for Φ GS, rel > 1 (see Online resource 1). The <b>grinding</b> <b>stock</b> overfills the void volume, the velocity of the milling balls is reduced and thus less heat is generated.|$|E
30|$|The {{influence}} of the operating frequency, the milling ball and <b>grinding</b> <b>stock</b> filling degree, the material of the milling balls and beakers, the milling ball diameter {{and the size of}} the milling beakers on the temperature increase inside the milling beakers in a mixer ball mill was investigated. These parameters influence the temperature progression and the equilibrium temperature of the system. The <b>grinding</b> <b>stock</b> filling degree with regard to the void volume in the milling ball package showed huge influence on the heating rate and the equilibrium temperature. In this context, the behavior of the temperature progression changes if the complete void volume is filled with the <b>grinding</b> <b>stock.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{observed}} that the lubrication effect {{is greater than the}} cooling effect for decreasing the friction heat in face grinding. It was clarified that cool-air grinding is difficult to apply to face grinding under the present grinding conditions. We could obtain the minimum ground surface roughness (hereafter noted as surface roughness) at a mist suppｌy volume of 15 to 30 ml/h in mist <b>grinding.</b> The largest <b>stock</b> removal rate (hereafter noted as grinding efficiency) is obtained in mist grinding. However, grinding efficient was small in cool-air mist grinding, by which a large cooling effect of cool air was expected. Though mist and cool-air mist grinding perform similar to wet grinding in few grinding passes, wet grinding is properly applied by large chip removal action in many grinding passes...|$|R

The milling beakers were equipped with the respective number of milling balls; the <b>grinding</b> <b>stock</b> was added and milling was accomplished at the respective frequency, ν osc, and milling time t. Afterward, the beaker was opened and the thermocouple placed {{in the middle of}} the beaker. The time for measurement was < 1  min.

40|$|This work {{deals with}} the study of {{limestone}} and corundum dry milling using attritor-type stirred mill in a batch mode. There were stearin and polyethylene glycol used as surfactants and spherical shaped steel grinding elements used for the experimental part of the work. The main idea was to examine behavior of the selected <b>grinding</b> <b>stock</b> type within a long-term grinding forces exposure in selected conditions of ultrafine dry milling {{leading up to the}} submicron area. Characterization of samples was performed by laser granulometry, X-ray powder diffraction analysis, flame atomic absorption spectroscopy, objective color determination and electrokinetic potential measurement.

30|$|The {{temperature}} {{that was}} measured after 90  min milling strongly {{depends on the}} loaded material. The highest temperature was measured without any <b>grinding</b> <b>stock</b> (compare section <b>grinding</b> <b>stock</b> filling degree, Fig.  3). The addition of powder led to lower temperatures in every case. The temperature ranges between 40 and 63  °C for quartz sand and vanillin, respectively (Online resource 1). The material influence on the temperature {{seems to be a}} complicated interaction of material properties like Young´s modulus and hardness [13]. The kind of material influences the elasticity of the collision and the motion of the balls, as shown for planetary ball mills [32]. Thus, it acts on the temperature progression and on the heat transfer from the balls to the wall of the beaker [13]. Young´s modulus for example is insufficient to describe the increase of temperature. For example, with MgF 2 and CaF 2 as grinding stocks, final temperatures of 51  °C were measured, although Young’s modulus is considerably different with 139 and 76  GPa, respectively [33]. In addition to the material properties of the <b>grinding</b> <b>stock,</b> physical phenomena like the compaction of the material on the milling wall influence T milling bed. If the <b>grinding</b> <b>stock</b> material adheres to the wall, less material is trapped when the balls collide. Furthermore, the compact layers reduce the free space for acceleration of the balls.|$|E

30|$|Ball milling {{procedures}} are {{often referred to}} as “milling at room temperature” [9, 10]. This term should be used carefully, as even within short milling times a temperature increase can be observed, if there are no precautions for temperature control. For example, it was shown that milling in a mixer ball mill (MBM) for 10  min with two milling balls in a 10  ml beaker raised the temperature from 25 to 30  °C, and Colacino and co-workers measured a temperature increase of approximately 14  K after 30  min milling in an MM 200 mixer mill [6, 11]. McKissic et al. observed a temperature of 50  °C after 1  h milling in a Spex mixer mill and Takacs and McHenry reported milling ball temperatures of 66  °C [12, 13]. Comparably higher temperatures can be reached in planetary ball mills (PBMs), where temperatures from 60 to 600  °C can be measured, {{depending on the type of}} PBM, the <b>grinding</b> <b>stock,</b> the grinding material and the filling degree [5, 13, 14].|$|E

Besides educational activities, the equipment has been involved in two research tracks. In a first track, the investigation of vibration assisted machining of ZrO 2 is being studied. The development of machining strategies has led to surface roughness values (Ra) below 0. 2 µm. In addition, the results are also compared with earlier performed machining experiments where no vibration is used. In the second track, focusing on energy efficient machining, a systematic energy-efficient approach, based on minimizing the production energy while complying with the required surface roughness, has been developed and validated to optimize the <b>grinding</b> <b>stock</b> for the turning-grinding process sequence.

40|$|Confronted with {{substantial}} environmental burden induced by ever-rising consumption {{of energy and}} resources, the manufacturing sector has been urged to shift its production towards a more environmentally conscious paradigm. Hence, sustainable manufacturing has drawn significant attention in recent years. To accomplish this aim, reducing production energy has been acknowledged {{as one of the}} essential tasks. As the key element in manufacturing, machine tools dominate the energy consumption during production. Accordingly, reducing the energy consumption of machine tools can effectively mitigate the adverse environmental impact of manufacturing. This research aims to develop energy-efficient approaches to diminish the energy footprint of machining processes (e. g. turning, milling, and grinding) at machine tool level. Several research subjects have been investigated to address this issue, which mainly involve energy modelling of machine tools, optimization approaches for energy-efficient machining strategies, simulation of energy consumption in computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) systems, and enhancement of the energy conservation of process planning. Firstly, the energy characteristics of machine tools are investigated. The results indicate that the machine energy is significantly influenced by the process parameters. Based on the analysis, the energy model of the machine tool is then developed as a function of process parameters. Two modelling methods, the black-box approach (BBA) and the bottom-up approach (BUA), are developed to establish the energy model of machine tools. The black-box approach considers the machine tool as an opaque object, and the energy characteristic is established empirically by correlating the input machining parameters and their corresponding output energy. In the bottom-up approach, the energy consumption of a machine tool is decomposed into different elements based on either machine state (e. g. startup, standby, cutting) or machine component (e. g. spindle, axis drives). By accumulating the energy of all elements, the total machine energy can be obtained. A modelling accuracy of 95 % can be realized by applying the developed energy models. To develop energy-efficient machining strategies, a surface roughness based approach is proposed to optimize the parameter of the finishing turning process. In this approach, process parameters which can satisfy the surface roughness requirement are firstly selected based on the surface roughness model; then the machining parameters that would lead to minimum energy consumption are determined by applying the established energy model. In addition, the machine energy can also be dramatically affected by different toolpath strategies and non-cutting movement. For selection of toolpath patterns, the investigation for the milling process shows that process time plays a critical role in the energy consumption. A longer toolpath prolongs the machining time and thus requires more energy. The mass of the activated axis also influences the energy, showing that heavier moving axes will result in more energy consumption. For settings in the non-cutting movement, a higher feed rate will increase the energy consumption of axis drives and decrease the energy of auxiliary parts; thus it demonstrates that machine energy presents a U-shape over feed rate, and an optimum feed rate can be selected for non-cutting movement. Moreover, the investigated machining case shows that an overall 50. 6 % of the total machine energy can be reduced through changing process settings (parameters, toolpath pattern, and non-cutting movement). At process chain level, in order to quantitatively allocate the machining stock, a systematic energy-efficient approach, which is based on minimizing the production energy while complying with the required surface roughness, is developed to optimize the <b>grinding</b> <b>stock</b> for the turning-grinding process sequence. The validation results present that, compared to the conventional method (Halevi method), the developed approach reduces 16. 6 % of energy consumption for the turning-grinding process sequence. Furthermore, using the developed energy models, an operation-mode based simulation approach, which incorporates material removal simulation to precisely track the energy of removing material, is developed and validated to predict the energy consumption of machining processes. It is shown from the validation result that by applying the developed approach, the energy consumption of machining one product with a sequence of operations can be simulated accurately within a deviation of 10 %. By merging the developed approach into current CAM systems, energy-efficient computer-aided manufacturing can be achieved, and the process settings can be optimized before the workpiece is loaded onto the machine for execution. The investigated case shows that an overall energy-saving potential of 80 % can be identified by adjusting process settings. Therefore, applying the developed simulation approach will help to facilitate process planning, enhance the energy conservation of machine tools as well as cut down the production cost. Finally, to foster the energy conservation of process planning, a comparative analysis is carried out to investigate how the manufacturing energy footprint is affected by the decision-making at each stage of process planning (selection of blank shape and selection of process settings). Process chains, consisting of primary shaping and machining processes for manufacturing conventional shape and near-net-shape products, are analyzed. At the stage of blank shape selection, the process chain for near-net-shape consumes much less energy in contrast with the process chain of conventional shape, showing that for the studied cases more than 50 % of energy can be mitigated for the whole manufacturing chain. As for the selection of process settings, energy saving of up to 20 % can be realized. It shows that using process chain of near-net-shape saves more energy than modifying process settings. In addition to saving energy consumption, manufacturing of near-net-shape products can also reduce the material usage. About 60 % less material is utilized by manufacturing of near-net-shape products. Therefore, applying near-net-shape is able to achieve both energy- and resource- efficient manufacturing. Besides, it also implies that early decision-makings in process planning would help to save more energy consumption in manufacturing. status: publishe...|$|E
