5|$|A cold front, {{the leading}} edge of a cooler mass of air, can produce frontal snowsqualls—an intense frontal {{convective}} line (similar to a rainband), when temperature is near freezing at the surface. The strong convection that develops has enough moisture to produce whiteout conditions at places which line passes over as the wind causes intense blowing snow. This type of snowsquall generally lasts less than 30 minutes at any point along its path but the motion of the line can cover large distances. Frontal squalls may form a short distance ahead of the surface cold front or behind the cold front where there may be a deepening low pressure system or a series of trough lines which act similar to a traditional cold <b>frontal</b> <b>passage.</b> In situations where squalls develop post-frontally it is not unusual to have two or three linear squall bands pass in rapid succession only separated by 25 miles (40 kilometers) with each passing the same point in roughly 30 minutes apart. In cases where there is a large amount of vertical growth and mixing the squall may develop embedded cumulonimbus clouds resulting in lightning and thunder which is dubbed thundersnow.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) {{model was}} {{run as a}} {{regional}} model without data assimilation or nudging (31 36 h-simulations) for July and December 2005 over a limited area domain covering Siberia to examine weather formation in an air-mass source region. The WRF-results were compared to NCEP 1 /NCAR-reanalysis, International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project, Global Precipitation Climatology Centre and Canadian Meteorological Centre data to assess model performance and identify shortcomings. WRF is capable of predicting air-mass formation. Simulation errors are within the error range of other models. The timing of best/worst agreement differs among quantities depending on their sensitivity to systematic (model deficiencies) and/or unsystematic errors (e. g. initial conditions). Overall, the WRF-results agree better with reanalysis for July than December. WRF-results and reanalysis agree best under persistent high pressure and worst during <b>frontal</b> <b>passages</b> and transition from one pressure regime to another. In July, WRF provides smaller diurnal amplitudes of 2 m-temperature with up to 5. 4 K lower, and 3. 5 K higher values at 0000 and 1200 UTC than the reanalysis. In December, WRF overestimates 2 m-temperature by 1. 4 K. WRF-temperatures excellently agree with the reanalysis from 700 hPa to 300 hPa. Except during <b>frontal</b> <b>passages,</b> wind-speed shows positive bias. Typically root-mean-square errors and standard deviation of errors of wind-speed (temperature) increase (decrease) with height.

40|$|Abstract. Horizontal wind–vector fields can be {{measured}} in real–time by a bistatic Doppler radar network and can be applied directly for hazard warnings and weather surveil-lance. But most applications especially for meteorologi-cal research and operational meteorology require quality– controlled wind–fields. Therefore, a quality–control scheme is developed which includes algorithms to determine the data quality by measured or fixed parameters. The algorithms are applied in the fuzzy logic sense weighting the quality of wind measurement with values ranging from one to zero. The re-sults of each weighting algorithm are merged to an average quality–index field which represents the confidence of each horizontal wind measurement. This averaged field is avail-able together with the measured horizontal wind–vector field for further applications. An overview about the determina-tion and the quality control of three–dimensional wind–fields is presented for two <b>frontal</b> <b>passages</b> with stratiform precipi-tation and a convective situation. ...|$|R
