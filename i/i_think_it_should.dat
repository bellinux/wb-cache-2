25|$|Why did I take my own life? Well, {{when you}} {{committed}} two double murders you would too. Yes I did kill Betty Jo Booker and Paul Martin {{in the city}} park that night, and killed Mr. Starks {{and tried to get}} Mrs. Starks. You wouldn't have guessed it, I did it when Mother was either out or asleep, and no one saw me do it. For the guns, I disassembled them and discarded them in different places. When I am found, which has already been done, please give this typewriter to Craig , and tell him that I hope that his child is a boy, it will (help) him in his work. Everything can go wherever you think it will do best except for the View-Master which will go to Belva Jo. Please take my bankroll and give it to Daddy, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> go to him, and tell him I don't want the car now.|$|E
500|$|In March 2008 Ghayasuddin Siddiqui, {{co-founder of}} the Muslim Parliament of Great Britain, {{publicly}} opposed {{the construction of the}} mosque, stating that [...] "We have too many mosques. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> not be built. What we need first is more integration between the existing mosques and the wider community." [...] Siddiqui's opposition joins that of Craig, together with that of Irfan Al-Alawi, the director of the Center for Islamic Pluralism Europe, who expressed extreme concern about the spread of Tablighi Jamaat. Both Siddiqui and Al-Alawi have different and opposed Islamic viewpoints to that of the Tablighi.|$|E
500|$|Lord of Scoundrels is {{typically}} {{classified as a}} Regency romance novel, though its story {{is set in the}} post-Regency era of 1828. It features a strong female heroine, a characteristic that Chase has become known for including in her romances. The author explains that [...] "for most of history, and in too many cases today, women are considered (and too often consider themselves) lesser beings who do not matter. In my books, the women are not lesser, and they do matter. In other words, I make the world the way <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be". Romantic fiction scholars have identified Jessica Trent as a [...] "feminist heroine" [...] with whom the [...] "alpha male hero" [...] has met his match. Chase inverts many qualities typical of the archetypical romantic hero and heroine. Near the end of the story, Jessica is the one who initiates consummation of their marriage, by seducing Dain. Afterwards, Jessica promptly falls asleep, causing her husband to seethe [...] "that was what he was supposed to do".|$|E

"I have {{no doubt}} it was all right," [...] he said, [...] "and {{as it was to}} be sold, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> {{preferred}} <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be to your father rather than anybody else. I believe I rather liked the thought that as {{it was not to be}} my home it would be yours." ...|$|R

"My solo LP is {{one thing}} that, well, {{to tell you the}} truth, <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be worth {{releasing}} because I did it a while ago, and I was under a great depression at the time when I did it, because I missed the boys very much. I just did it because I thought I had to do it." ...|$|R
500|$|Jay Boyar of the Orlando Sentinel {{gave the}} film {{four out of}} five stars, saying [...] "It's not an {{especially}} scary movie, but right from the start, you can tell that this Beauty and the Beast has a beauty of a bite." [...] John Hartl of The Seattle Times gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "It's exceptionally difficult to make an audience care for animated characters unless they're mermaids or anthropomorphized animals or insects, yet the Disney animators, with a big assist from the vocal talents of a superb cast, have pulled it off." [...] Gene Siskel, also of the Chicago Tribune, gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "Beauty and the Beast is one of the year`s most entertaining films for both adults and children." [...] On their Beauty and the Beast edition of Siskel & Ebert, both Siskel and Roger Ebert proclaimed that the film is [...] "a legitimate contender for Oscar consideration as Best Picture of the Year." [...] Michael Sragow of The New Yorker gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "It's got storytelling vigor and clarity, bright, eclectic animation, and a frisky musical wit." [...] Eric Smoodin writes in his book Animating Culture that the studio was trying to make up for earlier gender stereotypes with this film. Smoodin also states that, in the way it has been viewed as bringing together traditional fairy tales and feminism as well as computer and traditional animation, the film's [...] "greatness could be proved in terms of technology narrative or even politics". Animation legend Chuck Jones praised the film, in a 1992 guest appearance on Later with Bob Costas he claimed he [...] "Loved it. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> have won ... I think the animation on the beast {{is one of the greatest}} pieces of animation I've seen." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2001, Alexander {{finished}} {{his first book}} called African-American History at a Glance, which also included several pen and ink drawings of African-Americans who have contributed substantially to the American success story. [...] "There {{is a lack of}} input regarding African-Americans in the American history curriculum of schools all over America" [...] Mr. Alexander says. [...] "There are a lot of schools that offer it as a choice to students, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be a part of regular American history".|$|E
2500|$|Sprague also {{predicted}} that the lake would [...] "be visited by thousands hereafter." [...] Finally, he recommended that the lake not be named after its discoverer, saying: [...] "I do not know who first saw this lake, nor do <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be named after the discoverer." [...] Sprague suggested it be called [...] "Lake Majestic." [...] Today, it is known as Crater Lake. [...] Since {{he was the first}} to identify the lake's volcanic origin, Sprague deserves some credit for the name.|$|E

50|$|Phil {{asked me}} to arrange the song. <b>I</b> really didn't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be arranged, because its power is in the {{simplicity}} of the lyric. But he wanted the kitchen sink: Schoenberg, Stravinsky, Cage, electronic sound.|$|R
2500|$|Although {{initially}} {{a supporter}} of Thatcherism, Hitchens has criticised the Conservative Party for its free-market economic policies, calling it a [...] "wild form of liberalism", rather than conservatism. He once clashed with Iain Duncan Smith on Question Time over the privatisation of railways. On this issue, Hitchens has written [...] "I have always believed that the electric power grid should be nationalised. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be renationalised {{as a prelude to}} an enormous programme of nuclear power station building, without which we face an appalling energy crisis within 20 years." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 23 December 2008, Angel Villar restated [...] "We need {{to present}} a strong, {{consistent}} and winning bid for the 2018 World Cup." [...] He further confessed [...] "Personally, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be with Portugal." [...] Subsequently, {{in the aftermath of}} a RFEF meeting board, Spain and Portugal announced their intention to bid together. Spanish sports newspaper Marca advanced some details about the potential bid: Spain would lead a twelve-stadium project with eight of the venues, and the opening and final games would be held in Lisbon and Madrid, respectively. Spain has previously hosted the 1982 World Cup, while Portugal organised the Euro 2004.|$|E
2500|$|During production, Lucas and Taylor—whom Kurtz called [...] "old-school" [...] and [...] "crotchety"—had {{disputes}} over filming. With {{a background in}} independent filmmaking, Lucas was accustomed to creating most {{of the elements of}} the film himself. His lighting suggestions were rejected by Taylor, who felt that Lucas was overstepping his boundaries by giving specific instructions, sometimes even moving lights and cameras himself. Taylor refused to use the soft-focus lenses and gauze Lucas wanted after Fox executives complained about the look. Kurtz stated that [...] "In a couple of scenes [...] rather than saying, 'It looks a bit over lit, can you fix that?', [...] say, 'turn off this light, and turn off that light.' And Gil would say, 'No, I won't do that, I've lit it the way <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be—tell me what's the effect that you want, and I'll make a judgment {{about what to do with}} my lights.|$|E
6000|$|... "What I have said," [...] replied Julian Peveril, [...] "being the unbiassed {{sentiments of}} my heart, shall, upon no proper occasion, want {{the support of}} my open avowal; and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> strange you <b>should</b> doubt me so far." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, I don't know," [...] Prescott {{answered}} with a smile. [...] "I follow the course you mention, because I have to. It's my business to drive the plow, and the hazard of having a crop hailed out is adventure enough. But <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> make one hard {{on the people who}} prefer the other thing. After all, they may be right; the life they take pleasure in may be the best for them, though it wouldn't appeal to you or me." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{never had}} the money, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be bought." [...] And Sir Alured rejoiced in the idea that when his ghost should look at the survey map, that hiatus of Barnton Spinnies would not trouble his {{spectral}} eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "No! no!" [...] he said soothingly, [...] "you mustn't {{think of}} it! Please let me speak." [...] He {{addressed}} the officer.

2500|$|The track [...] "Can't Stop This" [...] {{contains}} {{a sample of}} The Jackson 5's [...] "All <b>I</b> Do <b>Is</b> <b>Think</b> Of You". <b>It</b> <b>should</b> be noted that this song's backing track is an extended version of J Dilla's [...] "Time: The Donut of the Heart" [...] from his third solo album Donuts.|$|R
2500|$|In August 2013, New York Post sports {{reporter}} Justin Terranova {{wrote that}} the butt fumble [...] "has come to define Sanchez’s downfall with the Jets." [...] Terranova {{wrote that the}} play had unfairly overshadowed Sanchez's AFC Championship campaigns in the previous two seasons, as well as Moore's [...] "ten years manning a generally-solid Jets offensive line." [...] When Moore retired in 2013, he reflected on the play, [...] "It's amusing to me that people <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> so amusing. The way I look at <b>it,</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> have any link to my career. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> stands for what I was as a player for 10 years.

6000|$|I do not insist by {{any farther}} {{argument}} on this, for <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> commend itself {{at once to}} your knowledge {{of what has been}} and to your feeling of what should be. You cannot think that the buckling on of the knight's armour by his lady's hand was a mere caprice of romantic fashion. It is the type of an eternal truth-- that the soul's armour is never well set to the heart unless a woman's hand has braced it; and it is only when she braces it loosely that the honour of manhood fails.

5000|$|Smith {{encourages}} {{women to}} become engineers although she dislikes being {{referred to as}} a woman engineer. [...] "Actually, because my class involves humanitarian engineering, I very rarely have more men than women. There have been times where there have been ten women and one man. This isn't surprising, given that women often want to see an application to what they're learning that they feel is worthwhile", says Smith. [...] "But I'm not involved in any particular projects to encourage women engineers, because I dislike being {{referred to as a}} woman engineer. I don't like programs that single out woman engineers as particular achievers just for being women. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be coincidental." ...|$|R
