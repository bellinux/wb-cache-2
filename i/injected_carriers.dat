Two different Er 3 + doped active layers were fabricated in {{the slot}} region: a pure SiO 2 and a Si-rich oxide. Pulsed polarization driving of the waveguides was used to characterize the time response of the electroluminescence (EL) and of the signal probe transmission in 1 mm long waveguides. <b>Injected</b> <b>carrier</b> absorption losses modulate the EL signal and, since the carrier lifetime is much smaller than that of Er 3 + ions, a sharp EL peak was observed when the polarization was switched off. A time-resolved electrical pump & probe measurement in combination with lock-in amplifier techniques allowed to quantify the <b>injected</b> <b>carrier</b> absorption losses. We found an extinction ratio of 6 dB, passive propagation losses of about 4 dB/mm, and a spectral bandwidth > 25 nm at an effective d. c. power consumption of 120 μW.

Most important, the pre-TMIn flow treatment evidently reduces the dependence of the external quantum efficiency on temperature and efficiency droop of green LEDs.

Direct injection of carriers with high degree of spin polarisation along a given axis should lead to preferential population of either singlet or triplet excited states, depending on the relative electrodes polarisation.
