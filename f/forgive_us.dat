An earlier book thought to be set in Southwold is Beside the Guns (1902) by the Christian author Mary Elizabeth Shipley. The German writer W. G. Sebald describes Southwold in The Rings of Saturn, an account of a walk through East Anglia.|$|E

500|$|In January 1961, Castro ordered Havana's U.S. Embassy {{to reduce}} its 300-member staff, suspecting {{that many of them}} were spies. The U.S. responded by ending {{diplomatic}} relations, and it increased CIA funding for exiled dissidents; these militants began attacking ships that traded with Cuba, and bombed factories, shops, and sugar mills. Both Eisenhower and his successor John F. Kennedy supported a CIA plan to aid a dissident militia, the Democratic Revolutionary Front, to invade Cuba and overthrow Castro; the plan resulted in the Bay of Pigs Invasion in April 1961. On April 15, CIA-supplied B-26's bombed 3 Cuban military airfields; the U.S. announced that the perpetrators were defecting Cuban air force pilots, but Castro exposed these claims as false flag misinformation. Fearing invasion, he ordered the arrest of between 20,000 and 100,000 suspected counter-revolutionaries, publicly proclaiming, [...] "What the imperialists cannot <b>forgive</b> <b>us,</b> is that we have made a Socialist revolution under their noses", his first announcement that the government was socialist.|$|E

[...] The author identifies the press as a key figure in the tenor of the 2016 campaign, [...] "The public hates us reporters in the best of times.

500|$|According to {{historian}} Mark McLeod, these postulated {{explanations of}} Định's behaviour are plausible, given the chaos engulfing Vietnam {{at the time}} and the lack of conclusive documentation. However, Định and his supporters asserted their loyalty to the monarch and justified their struggle in his name, {{both before and after the}} signing of the treaty. These declarations show no hint of rejecting Tự Đức's authority nor any reference to a worthier, idealised monarch. Conversely, many of these proclamations display an intense feeling of personal loyalty. A placard that French forces found floating downstream near Định's base in Gò Công asserted: [...] "Gratitude ties us to our king. We will avenge the insults he has received , or we will die for him." [...] One of Định's proclamations to his followers read: [...] "The Emperor does not recognise us, but it is indeed our duty to carry on our struggle.... The Emperor calls us rebels, but in the depth of his heart he cannot help but praise our loyalty. When the day of victory arrives, not only will the Emperor <b>forgive</b> <b>us,</b> he will furthermore grant us all kinds of awards." ...|$|E
500|$|A coach from Manchester {{eventually}} arrived bearing four surgeons, led by William Robert Whatton. By {{this time}} Huskisson was suffering severe spasms, and those present were having {{to hold his}} arms and legs down to stop him falling off the sofa. Whatton assessed that Huskisson was suffering from severe haemorrhaging from the initial wound and subsequent blood loss, and that amputation was necessary to prevent a fatal loss of blood. However, in Huskisson's agitated condition Whatton felt that traumatic surgery would likely prove fatal. Whatton and his colleagues applied warm water to Huskisson's chest, feet and hands, and gave him warm cordials and further laudanum in an effort to calm him enough to withstand the shock of surgery. At around 3.00pm the party heard the sound of cannon fire from the west. Told that the cannons were probably being fired to mark the arrival of the Prime Minister in Manchester, Huskisson said [...] "I hope to God the Duke may get safe through the day". At around 4.00pm Huskisson had regained enough strength to dictate to William Wainewright, his secretary, a brief amendment to his will ensuring that Emily Huskisson would inherit all his property, and shakily signed it. He then requested the sacrament, which was performed by the Rev Blackburne, and read the Lord's Prayer with Wilton. When Huskisson came to the line [...] "and <b>forgive</b> <b>us</b> our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us", he said [...] "That I do most heartily; and I declare to God that I have not the slightest feeling of ill-will towards any human being." ...|$|E
5000|$|... is {{sometimes}} presented {{as proof of}} Paul's antinomistic views. For example, the NIV translates these verses: [...] "... he <b>forgave</b> <b>us</b> all our sins, having canceled the written code, with its regulations, that was against us and that stood opposed to us; he took it away, nailing it to the cross." [...] But, the NRSV translates this same verse as: [...] "... he <b>forgave</b> <b>us</b> all our trespasses, erasing the record that stood against us with its legal demands. He set this aside, nailing it to the cross." [...] This latter translation makes it sound as {{though it is a}} record of trespasses, rather than the Law itself, that was [...] "nailed to the cross." [...] The interpretation partly depends on the original Greek word [...] which, according to Strong's G5498, literally means [...] "something written by hand;" [...] it is variously translated as [...] "written code" [...] or [...] "record", as in a record of debt.|$|R

6000|$|... (1.) We received, by our thus being {{counted in}} him, that benefit which did precede his {{rising from the}} dead; {{and what was that}} but the {{forgiveness}} of sins? For this stands clear to reason, that if Christ had our sins charged upon him at his death, he then must be discharged of them in order to his resurrection. Now, though it is not proper to say they were forgiven to him, because they were purged from him by merit; yet they may be said to be <b>forgiven</b> <b>us,</b> because we receive this benefit by grace. And this, I say, was done precedent to his resurrection from the dead. 'He hath quickened us together with him, HAVING <b>forgiven</b> <b>us</b> all trespasses.' He could not be 'quickened' till we were 'discharged'; because it was not for himself, but for us, that he died. Hence we are said to be at that time, as to our own personal estate, dead in our sins, even when we are 'quickened together with him' (Col 2:13).|$|R

2500|$|In the Orthodox Church {{there are}} no [...] "categories" [...] of sin as found in the Christian West. In the pre-Vatican II Catholic catechism, sins were {{categorized}} as [...] "mortal" [...] and [...] "venial." [...] In this definition, a [...] "mortal" [...] sin was one which would prevent someone from entering heaven unless one confessed it before death... These categories do {{not exist in the}} Orthodox Church. Sin is sin. Concerning Confession, having a list of deadly sins could, in fact, become an obstacle to genuine repentance. For example, imagine that you commit a sin. You look on the list and do not find it listed. It would be very easy to take the attitude that, since it is not on a list of deadly sins, it is not too serious. Hence, you do not feel the need to seek God's forgiveness right away. A week passes and you have completely forgotten about what you had done. You never sought God's forgiveness; as a result, you did not receive it, either. We should go to Confession when we sin—at the very least, we should ask God to <b>forgive</b> <b>us</b> daily in our personal prayers. We should not see Confession as a time to confess only those sins which may be found on a list.|$|E
2500|$|Common to {{the trilogy}} was a {{somewhat}} morbid {{look at the}} history of the Russian monarchy of the previous three centuries, where, as the author saw it, all the efficient rulers happened to be evil, and all the 'good' ones proved to be inefficient. The three stories of three different historical figures had similarly didactic finales: [...] "God help you, Tsar Ivan, and God <b>forgive</b> <b>us</b> all! That's the fate autocracy deserved! Here's the result of our disintegration!" [...] (Zakharyin's words over Ivan the Terrible's dead body), [...] "I am to blame for all of this... Oh God, why did you make me Tsar?!" [...] (Tsar Fyodor), [...] "What Evil spawns is only more evil and nothing else." [...] (Boris Godunov). All three parts of the trilogy, which, according to Nestor Kotlyarevsky, were [...] "united by the idea of tragedy being intrinsic to Tsarist power in Russia," [...] had serious problems with the censorship. The trilogy continued to divide opinion in Russia up until 1917. Not long before the Revolution, in Alexandrinsky Theatre the public reacted to Tsar Boris in an overtly political fashion. Monarchists applauded Boris Godunov's words, the left [...] "supported" [...] boyarin Sitsky, seeing in him a fighter of despotism.|$|E
