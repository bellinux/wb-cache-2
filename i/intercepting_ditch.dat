40|$|My {{thesis is}} focused on project of water {{management}} measure which should intercept torrential water endangering municipality Starovice. Intensity of soil ablation of affected land is evaluated by Wischmeier-Smith method. Based on the result of long-term soil lost and gathered materials and information three options of erosion control are suggested. Thereafter these options are compared {{on the basis of}} efficiency and the most suitable and the most effective option is selected. Also parameters of <b>intercepting</b> <b>ditch</b> are recommended and it is projected for capacity of direct water runoff from slopes above the ditch. As part of thesis maps were created using ArcGIS program and sample diagonal incisions of the <b>intercepting</b> <b>ditch</b> were created in AutoCad program...|$|E
40|$|My diploma {{thesis is}} focused on project of water {{management}} measure which should intercept torrential water endangering municipality Starovice. In diploma thesis I assess the degree of erosion washes of soil on the solving land. Intensity of soil ablation of affected land is evaluated by Wischmeier-Smith method. Based on the result of long-term soil lost and gathered materials are designed erosion control and water management measures. Graphic part of the thesis contains cartograms with an assessment rate of erosion threat to the investigated area. As part of thesis maps were created using ArcGIS. The essence of the work are drawings situations, longitudinal profiles, sample diagonal incisions of the <b>intercepting</b> <b>ditch</b> were created in Bentley PowerCivil...|$|E
5|$|Route 75 {{starts at}} a T {{intersection}} at Route 80 east of East Prairie, and it travels north through farmland as a two-lane road. The road intersects County Road 334 (CRD 334) and crosses over <b>Intercept</b> <b>Ditch.</b> It intersects CRD 332 after crossing over the ditch, {{and it turns}} west at the western and southern termini of Route DD and CRD 337, respectively. Route 75 then enters the city of Anniston, crossing over the White Pond inside the city limits. At Kaycee Lane (CRD 341), the road turns north towards {{the center of the}} city, where it intersects CRD 328 and other streets. Route 75 turns west at B Street (CRD 339), leaving the city limits. The route re-enters the farmland, intersecting CRD 343. It then crosses over the Wolf Hole Lateral, and ends at another T intersection at Route 105, south of the Mississippi County Airport.|$|R
40|$|Large volume {{oil spills}} {{generally}} {{occur as a}} result of a failure of the carrier pipeline before a leak can be detected. The oil issuing from a buried pipeline will spread by gravity initially below the surface, but it will eventually reach the surface, depending on the porosity of the soil and the position of the water or permafrost table. The surface flow of the oil will follow natural drainage ways and may eventually reach streams and rivers. Some of the oil will collect in natural depressions, which in the arctic and subarctic regions are occupied by water saturated peatlands or lakes. Peatlands occupy 30 - 40 % of the land surface in the boreal, subarctic and arctic portions of the Interior Plains of Canada and equal proportions of the northern sections of western Siberia and European Russia. If a large volume oil spill occurs in these regions, it is likely that the oil spill will affect peatlands. In fens (peatlands with moving water table) the oil will move with the seepage water through the peat and on the surface, and will eventually reach a water course. This oil can be <b>intercepted</b> by <b>ditches</b> and collected from dugout pools. Intensive mopping-up operations are likely to damage the vegetation that may otherwise survive. This strategy has been suggested for the large (617, 000 bbl, 78, 000 tonne) pool of oil now in a fen in northern Russia. Reprinted from...|$|R
40|$|The {{extent of}} {{drainage}} impact was studied in five transitional mires along a hydrosequence. The principal environmental variables driven by drainage are the {{minimum water level}} in the peat layer, together with the dry matter and total-N contents of peat. The drawdown effect of a cutoff <b>ditch</b> (<b>intercepting</b> surface and subsurface flow) on the minimum water level extends to a distance of 250 â€“ 320 m. Peat water levels above - 50 cm {{are associated with a}} sharp increase in Sphagnum cover, and the percentage of bog-specific species increases markedly when the minimum water level is higher than - 25 cm. The girths and heights of trees and canopy closure of the tree layer decrease rapidly up to a distance of 200 m from the cutoff ditch. Negative impacts of the cutoff ditch on the canopy cover and average height of trees, estimated using LIDAR data, can be followed for distances up to 400 m and 350 m, respectively. The density and height of shrub stems start to increase at a distance of 16 m and continue to increase up to 400 m from the cutoff ditch. The percentage of bog-specific species increases up to a distance of 100 m, whilst the percentage of fen-specific species begins to decrease remarkably at a distance of about 200 m from the cutoff ditch...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWater {{erosion of}} {{cultivated}} soils {{is a threat}} to the sustainability of agriculture, especially in Mediterranean areas. For a long time, Mediterranean farmers have thus adopted some soil conservation practices. Actual ditch networks, which are generally associated with terraces, result from historical successive farmer settlements and are one of these soil conservation practices. By <b>intercepting</b> surface run-off, <b>ditches</b> decrease slope length and prevent soil erosion on downstream plots. However, since water erosion hazard and ditch network geometries are highly variable in vineyards landscape and since ditch building and maintaining are costly, the objective {{of this study was to}} identify and map the resulting efficiency of ditch networks in preventing soil erosion. For a given area, a ditch network efficiency is defined here as the balance between the network density, i. e. network cumulated length for a given area unit, and the erosion sensitivity over an area which measures the performance of the ditch network in limiting soil erosion. The erosion efficiency of ditch networks was thus identified using both i) computer generated ditch networks with various spatial configurations and ii) the stream power index as an erosion sensitivity indicator, computed from a DTM in which each ditch network was burned. The stream power index of the actual networks were compared with a set of generated networks whose density and topology were selected to maximize the performance in preventing soil erosion thanks to the use of a self-developed optimized stochastic network generator. For four 1 km 2 hillslopes, we showed that the performances of actual networks to prevent soil erosion was among the best that were obtained by simulated networks with even greater densities. Furthermore, we showed that the stream power index values that accounted for the actual ditch networks to prevent soil erosion hazard was both minimal and weakly variable in the whole study area (30 km 2) at hillslope scale, whatever the other erosion factors, namely topography and landuse. This suggested that densities and topologies of actual ditch networks in the catchment have been optimized by farmers through individual acts along the last centuries in order to limit the soil erosion hazard. This also confirms there is very little room to propose new ditch network spatial configurations that better prevent vineyards soil erosion...|$|R
