5|$|Bivalves <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>open</b> {{circulatory system}} that bathes the organs in hemolymph. The heart has three chambers: two {{auricles}} receiving {{blood from the}} gills, and a single ventricle. The ventricle is muscular and pumps hemolymph into the aorta, {{and then to the}} rest of the body. Some bivalves have a single aorta, but most also have a second, usually smaller, aorta serving the hind parts of the animal.|$|E
5|$|Like other crustaceans, malacostracans <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>open</b> {{circulatory system}} in which the heart pumps blood into the hemocoel (body cavity) where it {{supplies}} the needs of the organs for oxygen and nutrients before diffusing back to the heart. The typical respiratory pigment in malacostracans is haemocyanin. Structures that function as kidneys are located near the base of the antennae. A brain exists in the form of ganglia close to the antennae, there are ganglia in each segment and a collection of major ganglia below the oesophagus. Sensory organs include compound eyes (often stalked), ocelli (simple eyes), statocysts and sensory bristles. The naupliar eye is a characteristic of the nauplius larva and consists of four cup-shaped ocelli facing in different directions and able to distinguish between light and darkness.|$|E
5|$|It {{is illegal}} in New Jersey to <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>open</b> {{container}} of {{alcohol in the}} passenger portion of a private automobile, but open bottles of alcohol may be transported {{in the trunk of}} a car, and consumption of alcohol on a bus, train, taxi, limousine, or boat is permitted. The penalty for having an open container of alcohol in a car is $200 fine for the first offense, and a $250 fine or 10 days of community service for repeat violations. The state Motor Vehicle Commission does not impose license points for open container convictions, but some automobile insurance companies impose a surcharge. New Jersey's law on open containers in motor vehicles is compliant with the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), a federal act passed in 1998 which reduces the highway funding of states that do not prohibit open containers in passenger areas of automobiles.|$|E

In 1977 Terry Lawson proved that for odd m > 6, every m-dimensional manifold <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>open</b> book decomposition. For even m > 6, <b>an</b> m-dimensional manifold <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>open</b> book decomposition {{if and only if}} an asymmetric Witt group obstruction is 0, by a 1979 theorem of Frank Quinn.|$|R

5|$|Like other insects, {{grasshoppers}} <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>open</b> {{circulatory system}} and their body cavities {{are filled with}} haemolymph. A heart-like structure in {{the upper part of}} the abdomen pumps the fluid to the head from where it percolates past the tissues and organs on its way back to the abdomen. This system circulates nutrients throughout the body and carries metabolic wastes to be excreted into the gut. Other functions of the haemolymph include wound healing, heat transfer and the provision of hydrostatic pressure, but the circulatory system is not involved in gaseous exchange. Respiration is performed using tracheae, air-filled tubes, which open at the surfaces of the thorax and abdomen through pairs of valved spiracles. Larger insects may need to actively ventilate their bodies by opening some spiracles while others remain closed, using abdominal muscles to expand and contract the body and pump air through the system.|$|E
5|$|Plans {{called for}} a four-story {{structure}} covered with zinc panels on the exterior {{with a total of}} , including a three story tall atrium. Plans for zinc on the exterior were later changed to stainless steel due to costs. Designed by Mayne and the DLR Group, the building was to be built using concrete and steel with a goal of earning Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification for sustainability, with large amounts of natural lighting designed to help secure that distinction. On the outside many security measures were incorporated into the design. The building was to include six courtrooms, administrative offices, and space for the offices of the U.S. Marshals Service. Despite security concerns as a federal building, the architect and judge Michael Robert Hogan sought to <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>open</b> feel to the structure. Hogan, the chief judge of the United States District Court for the District of Oregon, was the primary government official tasked with working with the architect to design the courthouse.|$|E
5|$|Rushes, tussock sedge, cattails, jewelweed, sphagnum, {{and various}} native true grasses {{are found in}} the bog turtle's habitat, as well as some shrubs and trees such as willows, red maples, and alders. It is {{important}} for their habitat to <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>open</b> canopy, because bog turtles spend a considerable amount of time basking in the sunlight. An open canopy allows sufficient sunlight to reach the ground so that the bog turtles can manage their metabolic processes through thermoregulation. The incubation of eggs also requires levels of sunlight and humidity that shaded areas typically lack. The ideal bog turtle habitat is early successional. Late successional habitats contain taller trees that block the necessary sunlight. Erosion and runoff of nutrients into the wetlands accelerate succession. Changes caused by humans have begun to eliminate bog turtles from areas where they would normally survive.|$|E

5|$|The {{evening before}} Fischer's burial, over 600 people {{attended}} a Catholic service at St. Mary's Church in Brownsville. His parents decided to <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>open</b> casket to allow attendees to kneel and pray {{next to the}} coffin. The funeral {{took place in the}} same church. Many people were in attendance including Buddy and Corinne's acquaintances, and Fischer's high school classmates. His girlfriend Marianela Caballero and her mother attended both services. Cristina, his ex-girlfriend, was also at the services, but her mother was not present. Fischer was buried at the Mont Meta Memorial Park in San Benito, Texas. In the days after the funeral, several of Fischer's longtime friends and their parents gathered at Buddy's house for moral support. Fischer's family moved out of the house where he was killed, and went to live with Corinne's mother. The day of the murder, the Brownsville police offered a reward of US$5,000 to anyone who could assist in the arrest of any individual involved in the murder. A week later the reward was increased to US$20,000. Five months after the murder, Fischer's house was sold at a US$18,000 loss.|$|E

25|$|While humans, as well {{as other}} vertebrates, have a closed {{cardiovascular}} system (meaning that the blood never leaves the network of arteries, veins and capillaries), some invertebrate groups <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>open</b> cardiovascular system. The lymphatic system, on the other hand, is an open system providing an accessory route for excess interstitial fluid to be returned to the blood. The more primitive, diploblastic animal phyla lack circulatory systems.|$|E

25|$|Spiders, {{like most}} arthropods, <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>open</b> circulatory system, i.e., {{they do not}} have true blood, or veins to convey it. Rather, their bodies are filled with haemolymph, which is pumped through arteries by a heart into spaces called sinuses {{surrounding}} their internal organs. The haemolymph contains hemocyanin, a respiratory protein similar in function to hemoglobin. Hemocyanin contains two copper atoms, tinting the haemolymph with a faint blue color.|$|E
25|$|During {{this time}} Boas {{played a key}} role in {{organizing}} the American Anthropological Association(AAA) as an umbrella organization for the emerging field. Boas originally wanted the AAA to be limited to professional anthropologists, but W.J.McGee (another geologist who had joined the BAE under Powell's leadership) argued that the organization should <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>open</b> membership. McGee's position prevailed and he was elected the organization's first president in 1902; Boas was elected a vice-president, along with Putnam, Powell, and Holmes.|$|E

Early houses might <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>open</b> stone hearth and a smoke hole in the roof. The interiors of houses developed with separate chambers and partitions of stone or wood. Additional rooms might be accessed from an external wooden gallery, cantilevered from holes and corbels along the walls, as seen the 13th-century house at Poreč, Czech Republic.|$|E

25|$|In {{humans and}} other complex life forms, blood and lymph {{circulate}} {{in two different}} systems, the circulatory system and lymphatic system, which are enclosed by systems of capillaries, veins, arteries, and nodes. This {{is known as a}} closed circulatory system. Insects, however, <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>open</b> circulatory system in which blood and lymph circulate unenclosed, and mix to form a substance called hemolymph. All organs of the insect are bathed in hemolymph, which provides oxygen and nutrients to all of the insect's organs.|$|E

On some variants, {{the rear of}} the canopy could be opened for a gunner to fire to the rear. A variety of air-cooled radial engines, including the Wright Whirlwind, Pratt & Whitney Wasp and Pratt & Whitney Wasp Junior of varying horsepowers, could be installed depending on customer preferences. The fuselage was built up from steel tubes and normally fabric covered; however, later versions were provided with aluminium monocoque structures.|$|E
25|$|Impacted wisdom teeth (or {{impacted}} third molars) are wisdom teeth {{which do}} not fully erupt into the mouth because of blockage from other teeth (impaction). If the wisdom teeth do not <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>open</b> connection to the mouth, pain can develop {{with the onset of}} inflammation or infection or damage to the adjacent teeth. Common accepted hypothesis that determine eruption is the angle at which the 3rd molars sit, the stage of root formation of 3rd molars at the point of screening, depth of impaction, how much room there is for eruption as well as the size of the 3rd molar.|$|E

25|$|The {{issue of}} a court {{descending}} into the arena and depriving a party {{of the right to}} a fair trial was also distinguished from that of prejudgment, as in Roseli bin Amat v. Public Prosecutor (1989). When a judge is found to have prejudged, he will not <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>open</b> mind and is likely to have determined issues adversely against a party before the presentation of a case. However, when he descends into the arena, he may not necessarily have taken sides before the hearing. The difference may lie in how actively the judge pursues this position and how he comes to be persuaded.|$|E
25|$|The Reverend John Wilson and the {{minister}} of Hester's church, Arthur Dimmesdale, question the woman, but she refuses to name her lover. After she returns to her prison cell, the jailer brings in Roger Chillingworth, a physician, to calm Hester and her child with his roots and herbs. He and Hester <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>open</b> conversation regarding their marriage {{and the fact that}} they were both in the wrong. Her lover, however, is another matter and he demands to know who it is; Hester refuses to divulge such information. He accepts this, stating that he will find out anyway, and forces her to hide that he is her husband. If she ever reveals him, he warns her, he will destroy the child's father. Hester agrees to Chillingworth's terms although she suspects she will regret it.|$|E
25|$|In 1982, a {{consortium}} consisting of Kristian Jebsens Rederi, BMV and Lau Eide made {{a proposal to}} borrow money privately abroad and hire Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries of Japan to build the bridge. The proposal {{was rejected by the}} Public Roads Administration, who wanted to <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>open</b> tender to build the bridge, and wanted the project organized as a regular road construction administrated by themselves. The Public Roads Administration continued to work with a model which involved a foreign loan, but eventually failed to receive permission from the Ministry of Finance. Instead the toll company started negotiating with domestic banks, and in September 1984 the company agreed to borrow up to 600 million 1983-NOK and 1.2 billion 1991-NOK, without public guarantees, from Den norske Creditbank (DnC) and Nevi.|$|E
