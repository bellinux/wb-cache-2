We show that the dynamical realization admits a unique minimal set provided G is not infinite cyclic. We show that convex subgroup of an isolated left order is finite in number.

40|$|Nonrelativistic QED bound {{states are}} {{difficult}} to study {{because of the presence}} of at least three widely different scales: the masses, three-momenta (p_i) and kinetic energies (K_i) of the constituents. Nonrelativistic QED (NRQED), an effective field theory developed by Caswell and Lepage, simplifies greatly bound state calculations by eliminating the masses as dynamical scales. As we demonstrate, NRQED diagrams involving only photons of energy E_γ is not the case, however, for diagrams involving photons with energies E_γ≃ K_i ("retardation effects"), for which no simple counting counting rules can be given. We present a new effective field theory in which the contribution of those ultra-soft photons can be <b>isolated</b> <b>order</b> by order in of the NRQED vertices...|$|E

In particular, we present theoretical analysis to results of the numerical simulations in two dimensions. Moreover, there is a critical value for the system within the linear regime.

40|$|A {{panel of}} five serovar-specific {{monoclonal}} antibodies which distinguish the five known avian serovars of Chlamydia psittaci {{was used to}} serotype 45 European avian Chlamydia psittaci isolates. Chlamydial antigen was grown in Buffalo green monkey (BGM) cells or in embryonated chicken eggs and was then inoculated into BGM cells. Serotyping was performed in an indirect immunofluorescence test. The 45 European isolates included 22 <b>isolates</b> from the <b>order</b> Psittaciformes, 9 <b>isolates</b> from the <b>order</b> Columbiformes, 6 <b>isolates</b> from the <b>order</b> Galliformes, 5 <b>isolates</b> from the <b>order</b> Passeriformes, and 3 <b>isolates</b> from the <b>order</b> Anseriformes. All of these were successfully serotyped. No additional serovars were found. One isolate from a duck and two isolates from psittacine birds gave positive immunofluorescences with two monoclonal antibodies considered to be specific for two different serovars. These three isolates were cloned by an agar overlay method. Serotyping of the clones demonstrated that the duck and one psittacine bird each were infected with two different serovars. After cloning, one isolate from a psittacine bird reacted only with serovar A. From these results {{it was concluded that}} this serotyping system allows the classification of all isolates tested so far. The results show that similar serovars are prevalent in avian species in Europe and the United States. The results also indicate that birds from a certain order are more susceptible to a distinct serovar. The use of a panel of serovar-specific monoclonal antibodies in the immunofluorescence test provides a reliable method for serotyping avian isolates. Monoclona...|$|R

They were directly coated on tubular macropotous alumina supports without any intermediate mesoporous layer contrary to conventional membrane architectures.

In order to avoid any possible interconnection between macropores, several strategies were investigated, which prevented sot infiltration in the macroporous support during the deposition process.

Observing that the optimality conditions for the constrained problem coincide with those for a suitable unconstrained problem, we introduce sense I solutions (those of the initial constrained problem) and sense II solutions (those of the unconstrained problem). Further, we obtain relations between sense I and sense II isolated minimizers and p-minimizers...|$|R
