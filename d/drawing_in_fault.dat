40|$|Abstract: Problem statement: The {{growing demand}} for reliability, {{maintainability}} and survivability in industrial processes has <b>drawn</b> significant research <b>in</b> <b>fault</b> detection and fault tolerant control domain. A fault is usually defined as an unexpected change in a system, such as component malfunction and variations in operating condition, which tends to degrade the overall system performance. The purpose of fault detection is to detect these malfunctions to take proper action {{in order to prevent}} faults from developing into a total system failure. Approach: In this study an effective integrated fault detection and fault tolerant control scheme was developed for a class of LTI system. The scheme was based on a Kalman filter for simultaneous state and fault parameter estimation, statistical decisions for fault detection and activation of controller reconfiguration. Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control schemes continue to provide the simplest and yet effective solutions to most of the control engineering applications today. Determination or tuning of the PID parameters continues to be important as these parameters have a great influence on the stability and performance of the control system. In this study GA was proposed to tune the PID controller. Results: The results reflect that proposed scheme improves the performance of the process in terms of time domain specifications, robustness to parametri...|$|R

Also, A comparison with the conventional Ziegler-Nichols method proves the superiority of GA based system. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the effectiveness of genetic algorithm in tuning of a PID controller with optimum parameters. It is, moreover, proved to be robust to the variations in plant dynamic characteristics and disturbances assuring a parameter-insensitive operation of the process. </P...|$|R

40|$|Fault {{localization}} is a core element <b>in</b> <b>fault</b> management. Many fault reasoning techniques use deterministic or probabilistic symptom-fault causality {{model for}} fault diagnoses and localization. Symptom-Fault map {{is commonly used}} to describe Symptom-Fault causality <b>in</b> <b>fault</b> reasoning. However, due to lost and spurious symptoms <b>in</b> <b>fault</b> reasoning systems that passively collect symptoms, the performance and accuracy of the fault localization can be significantly degraded. In this paper, we propose an extended Symptom-Fault-Action model to incorporate actions into fault reasoning process to tackle the above problem. This technique is called Active Integrated fault Reasoning (AIR), which contains three modules: fault reasoning, fidelity evaluation and action selection. Corresponding fault reasoning and action selection algorithms are elaborated. Simulation study shows both performance and accuracy of fault reasoning can be greatly improved by taking actions, especially when the rate of spurious and lost symptoms is high...|$|R
