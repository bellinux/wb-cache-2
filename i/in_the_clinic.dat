While there, Bond witnesses a mysterious nurse named Fatima Blush giving a sadomasochistic beating to a patient in a nearby room. The man's face is bandaged and after Blush finishes her beating, Bond sees the patient using a machine which scans his eye. Bond is seen by Blush, who sends an assassin to kill him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>clinic</b> gym, but Bond manages to defeat the assassin.|$|E
5|$|Like {{all of the}} hospital's doctors, House is {{required}} to treat patients in the facility's walk-in clinic. His grudging fulfillment of this duty, or his creative methods of avoiding it, constitute a recurring subplot, which often serves as the series' comic relief. During clinic duty, House confounds patients with unwelcome observations into their personal lives, eccentric prescriptions, and unorthodox treatments. However, after seeming to be inattentive to their complaints, he regularly impresses them with rapid and accurate diagnoses. Analogies {{with some of the}} simple cases <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>clinic</b> occasionally inspire insights that help solve the team's case.|$|E

Ric is furious with Kumi for telling Kwame about his problems, but Kwame states that he could not deceive him, and that Ric is does not understand Ghanaian honour. Without Kwame's support, the clinic goes bankrupt and Kumi chains the doors closed.|$|E

5|$|In the interim, {{rather than}} await a decision, Ferrari {{continued}} her studies. Between 1921 and 1923 she visited many clinics in Europe, including facilities in Austria, Belgium, England, France, Germany and Italy. She assisted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>clinic</b> of Marie Curie in Paris {{as well as}} in the Columbia Hospital for Women and Lying-In Asylum in Washington, DC. The Faculty of Medicine of Paris awarded her the first diploma ever given to a woman for studies in urinary tract monitoring. In 1924, she designed a vaginoscope, which was much easier to sterilize and was more adaptable to multiple specula than previous models. The device significantly improved services which were available to women in Brazil, and was featured in the articles of the Journal of Gynecology and Obstetrics of Rio de Janeiro. The innovation won the Grand Prize at the 1924 Congreso Hispano Lusitano Americano de Ciencias Médicas held in Seville, Spain.|$|E
25|$|This {{device is}} useful <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>clinic</b> setting. However, {{due to the}} fact that it is not {{validated}} nor standardised, it must be used carefully in researches and screenings.|$|E

30|$|If {{the skills}} and {{equipment}} required for TVS are available in a general gynaecology clinic, 40 % (n= 29) of women were reassured and discharged after their first consultation, compared with 15 % (n= 11) in a clinic without TVS. Overall, the numbers of women added to <b>the</b> waiting lists <b>in</b> both types of clinics were comparable [36 % (n= 45) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>clinics</b> with TVS, and 28 % (n= 39) from <b>the</b> <b>clinics</b> without TVS]. However, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>clinics</b> without TVS only 74 % of these cases {{were added to the}} waiting list after their initial consultation, whereas almost all those women who required surgery were identified at <b>the</b> first visit <b>in</b> <b>clinics</b> with TVS. More women were added to <b>the</b> waiting list <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>clinics</b> with TVS, as these clinics had more referrals with women complaining of pelvic pain than those clinics without TVS (17 % and 9 %, respectively), who wished to have a diagnostic laparoscopy, even <b>in</b> <b>the</b> presence of a normal scan finding.|$|R

25|$|It {{was during}} this {{productive}} period of research, {{in the summer of}} 1934, prior to the eventual invention of nylon, that Carothers disappeared.

25|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinic</b> sample, 48% of the 29 alcoholics who {{achieved}} sobriety eventually attended 300 or more AA meetings, and AA {{attendance was}} associated with good outcomes in patients who {{otherwise would have been}} predicted not to remit. In the Core City sample the more severe alcoholics attended AA, possibly because all other avenues had failed—after all, AA meetings are rarely attended for hedonistic reasons. The implication from all three samples was simply that many alcoholics find help through AA.|$|E

40|$|In 1990, Kupat Holim Clalit (KHC), Israel's largest health {{insurance}} fund, initiated a demonstration program for transforming primary care <b>clinics</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Negev district of southern Israel into autonomous budget-holding units. Four program components were implemented in nine clinics: allocation of a fixed budget; expansion of day-to-day decision-making authority; {{establishment of a}} computerized information system for producing monthly reports on expenditure; and provision of incentives for budgetary responsibility (returning part of a clinic's savings for use at its discretion). The demonstration program had three objectives: budgetary control and cost containment; improvement of services and increased client satisfaction; and improvement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> motivation, initiative, responsibility, and satisfaction of clinic staff. This report presents interim findings from an evaluation study of the budget-holding program conducted in 1991 - 1992. The report considers three questions: How was the demonstration program implemented? Did work procedures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>clinics</b> change following implementation of the program? How did budget-holding influence levels of expenditure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>clinics?</b> <b>The</b> program components were implemented gradually <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nine <b>clinics</b> during 1991 - 1992. Not all, however, were fully implemented. The staff survey conducted after implementation of the program {{identified a number of}} changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> work procedures of the clinics: heightened cost consciousness, discussion of the monthly expenditure reports, emphasis on the need to economize, and attempts to economize. Data on expenditure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> budget-holding <b>clinics</b> were analyzed and compared to data on expenditure in primary care <b>clinics</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Negev district as a whole. It was found that while the average quarterly per capita expenses <b>in</b> <b>the</b> district increased <b>in</b> real terms from 1991 - 1992, expenses <b>in</b> <b>the</b> budget-holding <b>clinics</b> remained stable or, in some cases, actually decreased. While we cannot conclude categorically from the existing data that the budget-holding program is responsible for the unique patterns of expenditure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nine <b>clinics,</b> we can confidently state that work procedures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nine <b>clinics</b> changed following implementation of the program and that <b>the</b> <b>clinics</b> achieved cost containment relative to the district as a whole. Findings from the various research tools support one another, and reinforce the conclusion that budget-holding can potentially promote cost containment. primary care evaluation cost containment budget decentralization...|$|R

25|$|A 1967 study where a judge {{randomly}} assigned (ordered) offenders to either clinical treatment, AA treatment, or to a no treatment (control) group.

No {{statistically significant differences between}} the three groups were discovered in recidivism rate, in the number of subsequent rearrests or in time elapsed prior to rearrest. Like the Brandsma study, the results are inaccurate since the studies did not stop people not assigned to AA treatment from going to AA meetings.|$|E

The post-op patient’s arms were strapped to the bed for the first night after the procedure. The drain was removed 48 hours after surgery, the catheter four days, and the stent eight. The new vagina was managed by frequent or daily insertion of fingers or retractors, and the new urethra was kept open by the daily introduction of the catheter, ensuring against neomeatal stenosis.

In July 1969, after hearing of his indictment to stand trial once more, Leggio checked into a private health clinic in Rome to have treatment for Pott's disease, which he had suffered from most of his life and for which he had to wear a brace.

25|$|Hepatitis C {{virus is}} {{predominantly}} a blood-borne virus, with very low risk of sexual or vertical transmission.

Common setting for transmission of HCV is also intra-hospital (nosocomial) transmission, when practices of hygiene and sterilization are not correctly followed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>clinic.</b> A number of cultural or ritual practices have been proposed as a potential historical mode of spread for hepatitis C virus, including circumcision, genital mutilation, ritual scarification, traditional tattooing and acupuncture.
