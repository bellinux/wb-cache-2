Although Chris wins a joking bet with Elaine that he can get Gwen to dance with him, Elaine grows despondent watching her would-be rival dance. Sure that Chris will come to resent her paralysis, Elaine leaves suddenly for Florida. When she returns at Christmas, however, Chris resumes his pursuit, and by New Year's Eve, the two are deeply in love. Chris's newfound happiness is short-lived, however, as Whitey shows up, broke and scared. Chris insists that Whitey, who is being chased by Bowen, stay locked up in Mrs. Brentman's house until he can figure out an escape plan. Whitey's nerves are soon frayed, and he begins tearing apart Chris's room in search of Bowen's money.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} whether men's self-reported health-related {{quality of life}} and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are associated with acceptance of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing and subsequent prostate biopsy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a prospective questionnaire study of men aged 50 - 69 years, nested within the primary-care-based Prostate testing for cancer and Treatment study in nine UK areas, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), 12 -item Short Form Health Survey (SF- 12) and a self-reported LUTS measure (ICSmaleSF) were completed immediately before having a PSA test or prostate biopsy, or after not responding to <b>an</b> <b>invitation</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> PSA test or refusing a biopsy. Analyses compared 348 men accepting or 232 not responding to <b>invitations</b> <b>for</b> PSA testing and 318 accepting or 48 refusing a prostate biopsy. RESULTS: Men accepting or not responding to the <b>invitation</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> PSA test had similar HADS, SF- 12 and LUTS scores. Men accepting a biopsy had similar HADS and SF- 12 scores to those refusing biopsy, but significantly more LUTS (P < 0. 01 for hesitancy, reduced stream, intermittency, incomplete emptying, frequency during the day). CONCLUSION: Depressed or anxious mood, comorbidity and LUTS were not associated with the decision to respond to <b>invitations</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> PSA test. Men agreeing to a biopsy {{were more likely to have}} LUTS than those refusing, suggesting that men believe that LUTS are a symptom of prostate cancer. Men needing a prostate biopsy require more information about LUTS so that they can make informed choices about testing for prostate cancer...|$|R
