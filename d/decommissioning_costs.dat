40|$|Identification of optimum {{reliability}} {{levels for}} coastal structures is considered. A class of breakwaters is considered where no human injuries {{can be expected}} in cases of failure. The optimum reliability level is identified by minimizing the total costs over the service life of the structure, including building costs, maintenance and repair costs, downtime <b>costs</b> and <b>decommission</b> <b>costs.</b> Different formulations are considered. Stochastic models are presented for the main failure modes for rubble mound breakwaters without superstructures, typically used for outer protection of basins. The influence on the minimumcost reliability levels is investigated for different values of the real rate of interest, the service lifetime, the downtime costs due to malfunction and the <b>decommission</b> <b>costs...</b>|$|R
25|$|Capital costs (including waste {{disposal}} and <b>decommissioning</b> <b>costs</b> for nuclear energy) – {{tend to be}} low for fossil fuel power stations; high for wind turbines, solar PV (photovoltaics); very high for waste to energy, wave and tidal, solar thermal, and nuclear.|$|E
25|$|Uncertain <b>decommissioning</b> <b>costs</b> - Cleanup of the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment {{was about}} $130 million, {{for a small}} 8 MW(th) unit. Much of the high cost {{was caused by the}} {{unexpected}} evolution of fluorine and uranium hexafluoride from cold fuel salt in storage that ORNL did not defuel and store correctly, but this has now been taken into consideration in MSR design. In addition, <b>decommissioning</b> <b>costs</b> don't scale strongly with plant size based on previous experience, and costs are incurred at the end of plant life, so a small per kilowatthour fee is sufficient. For example, a GWe reactor plant produces over 300 billion kWh of electricity over a 40-year lifetime, so a $0.001/kWh decommissioning fee delivers $300 million plus interest {{at the end of the}} plant lifetime.|$|E
25|$|When the {{government}} started on privatising the electricity generation {{industry in the}} 1980s, a cost analysis for potential investors revealed that true operating costs had been obscured for many years. <b>Decommissioning</b> <b>costs</b> especially had been significantly underestimated. These uncertainties caused nuclear power to be omitted from the privatisation at that time.|$|E
50|$|Similar {{concerns}} {{exist in}} the United States, where the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission has located apparent decommissioning funding assurance shortfalls and requested 18 power plants to address that issue.

50|$|A {{new company}} called Dounreay Site Restoration (DSRL) was {{formed as a}} {{subsidiary}} of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) to handle the decommissioning process. By May 2008, <b>decommissioning</b> <b>cost</b> estimates had been revised. Removal of all waste from the site was expected to take until the late 2070s to complete and the end-point of the project was scheduled for 2300.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} 9 years UKAEA has {{developed}} a formalized approach to <b>decommissioning</b> <b>cost</b> estimating. The estimating methodology and computer-based application are known collectively as the PRICE system. At {{the heart of the}} system is a database (the knowledge base) which holds resource demand data on a comprehensive range of decommissioning activities. This data is used in conjunction with project specific information (the quantities of specific components) to produce <b>decommissioning</b> <b>cost</b> estimates. PRICE is a dynamic cost-estimating tool, which can satisfy both strategic planning and project management needs. With a relatively limited analysis a basic PRICE estimate can be produced and used for the purposes of strategic planning. This same estimate can be enhanced and improved, primarily by the improvement of detail, to support sanction expenditure proposals, and also as a tender assessment and project management tool. The paper will: describe the principles of the PRICE estimating system; report on the experiences of applying the system {{to a wide range of}} projects from contaminated car parks to nuclear reactors; provide information on the performance of the system in relation to historic estimates, tender bids, and outturn costs...|$|R
25|$|In June 2003 the Department of Trade and Industry {{estimated}} that <b>decommissioning</b> <b>costs,</b> including {{the cost of}} running the facilities still in operation for their remaining life, were approximately £56 billion at 2003 prices, although the figure was 'almost certainly' expected to rise. This estimate was revised in subsequent years; to £57 billion in September 2004; £63 billion in September 2005; £65 billion in March 2006; and to £73 billion in March 2007. Around £46 billion of the £73 billion is for the decommissioning and clean-up of the Sellafield site.|$|E
25|$|These are {{generally}} graphite moderated and CO2 cooled. They {{can have a}} high thermal efficiency compared with PWRs due to higher operating temperatures. There {{are a number of}} operating reactors of this design, mostly in the United Kingdom, where the concept was developed. Older designs (i.e. Magnox stations) are either shut down or will be in the near future. However, the AGCRs have an anticipated life of a further 10 to 20years. This is a thermal neutron reactor design. <b>Decommissioning</b> <b>costs</b> can be high due to large volume of reactor core.|$|E
25|$|In January 2012, the {{campaign}} group Energy Fair, {{supported by a}} number of other organisations and environmentalists, filed a formal complaint with the European Commission over alleged unlawful State aid in the form of subsidies for nuclear power industry, in breach of European Union competition law. It claims that the subsidies arise from underwriting commercial risk and <b>decommissioning</b> <b>costs,</b> protection against terrorist attacks, the disposal of nuclear waste, and by providing 'institutional support' in the form of various government funded or subsidised bodies such as the National Nuclear Laboratory, the Nuclear Institute, and Nuclear Decommissioning Authority without providing corresponding levels of support for renewable technologies, without which nuclear power would not be commercially viable, so distorting the energy market. The group claims that the subsidies divert resources from renewable technologies that would 'cut emissions more deeply, more quickly, more cheaply, and with none of the risks and other problems with nuclear power'.|$|E

40|$|While the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has had {{specific}} and dose-based {{standards for the}} release of liquids and gases for a long time, there are no regulatory mechanisms in place {{for the release of}} solid bulk materials from a nuclear power plant. Even though free releases of small quantities of solid materials continue under existing guidelines from the operating plants, the regulatory void creates major difficulties for the bulk materials that result from the decommissioning of a nuclear site. Decommissioning of a commercial nuclear power plant generates large quantities of solid bulk materials such as concrete, metal, and demolition debris. Disposition of such materials has a large impact on the overall <b>decommissioning</b> <b>cost.</b> Yet, there are no clear and cost-effective alternatives for the disposal of these materials from a regulatory perspective.

40|$|Nuclear {{facility}} decommissioning, {{satisfactorily completed}} {{at the lowest}} cost, relies on a systematic approach to the planning, estimating, and documenting the work. High quality information is needed to properly perform the planning and estimating. A systematic approach to collecting and maintaining the needed information is recommended using a knowledgebase system for information management. A systematic approach is also recommended to develop the <b>decommissioning</b> plan, <b>cost</b> estimate and schedule. A probabilistic project cost and schedule risk analysis is included {{as part of the}} planning process. The entire effort is performed by a experienced team of <b>decommissioning</b> planners, <b>cost</b> estimators, schedulers, and facility knowledgeable owner representatives.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to {{document}} the updates to the Electricity Financial Pricing Module (EFP) to reflect the rate impacts of nuclear decommissioning. The EFP {{is part of the}} National Energy Modeling System (NEMS). The updates to the EFP related to nuclear decommissioning include both changes to the underlying data base and the methodology. Nuclear decommissioning refers to the activities performed to take a nuclear plant permanently out of service. The <b>costs</b> of nuclear <b>decommissioning</b> are substantial and uncertain. The recovery of these costs from ratepayers is to occur over the operating life of the nuclear plant. Utilities are obligated to make estimates of the nuclear <b>decommissioning</b> <b>cost</b> every few years. Given this estimate, utilities are to assess a charge upon ratepayers, such that over the operating life of the plant they collect sufficient funds to pay for the <b>decommissioning.</b> However, <b>cost</b> estimates for <b>decommissioning</b> have been increasing and it appears that utilities have not been collecting adequate funds to date. In addition, there is a real risk that many nuclear plants may be closed earlier than originally planned, further exacerbating the under collection problem. The updates performed in this project provide the EFP with the capability to analyze these issues.
