David Berry Knapp (known to Rajneesh followers as Swami Krishna Deva) stated in an FBI affidavit that the murder conspiracy was motivated by Ma Anand Sheela's [...] "tremendous anger" [...] towards Turner.|$|E

50|$|According to § 1, genocide, {{crimes against}} humanity, and war crimes {{are subject to}} {{universal}} jurisdiction, thus German courts can punish offenses committed by foreign citizens abroad.

So far the Public Prosecutor General's office has suspended persecator measures for 128 cases brought to its attention involving international crimes pursuant to the German International Criminal Code.|$|R
