5|$|We {{all had a}} {{collective}} feeling like we'd had enough {{of this kind of}} shit. It wasn't anything tangible anybody said to anyone else, it was just kind of like everything over the years had come to a head on that one particular night in the one particular place, and it was not an organized demonstration... Everyone in the crowd felt that we were never going to go back. It was like the last straw. It was time to reclaim something that had always been taken from us.... All kinds of people, all different reasons, but mostly it was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and everything just kind of ran its course. It was the police who were doing most of the destruction. We were really trying to get back in and break free. And we felt that we had freedom at last, or freedom to at least show that we demanded freedom. We weren't going to be walking meekly in the night and letting them shove us around—it's like standing your ground {{for the first time and}} in a really strong way, and that's what caught the police by surprise. There was something in the air, freedom a long time overdue, and we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>for</b> it. It took different forms, but the bottom line was, we weren't going to go away. And we didn't.|$|E
25|$|Lake {{expressed}} interest in renegotiating her deal with Paramount:The studio feels that way about it too. They have indicated {{they are going to}} fuss more about the pictures in which I appear. I think I'll enjoy being fussed about... I want this to be the turning point and I think that it will. I am free and clear of unpleasant characters, unless they are strongly justified. I've had a varied experience playing them and also appearing as heroines. The roles themselves haven't been noteworthy and sometimes not even especially spotlighted, but I think they've all been beneficial in one way or another. From here on there should be a certain pattern of development, and that is what I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>for</b> if necessary, though I don't believe it will be because they are so understanding here at Paramount.|$|E
500|$|In July 1896, the Democrats {{nominated}} former Nebraska congressman William Jennings Bryan for president. [...] Bryan had electrified the Democratic National Convention {{with his}} Cross of Gold speech. Bryan was an eloquent supporter of [...] "free silver", a policy which would inflate the currency by allowing silver bullion to be {{submitted by the}} public and converted into coins even though the intrinsic value of a silver dollar was about half its stated value. Bryan's candidacy divided the Democratic Party and its supporters, and caused many normally Democratic papers to abandon him. [...] Hearst called a meeting of his senior staff to decide the Journals policy. [...] Though few favored the Democrat, Hearst decided, [...] "Unlimber the guns; we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>for</b> Bryan." ...|$|E

2500|$|On October 18, McCain told a {{campaign}} rally in Melbourne, Florida {{that he had}} phoned Wurzelbacher {{for the first time}} on October 17. McCain said, [...] "He's a great guy, proud of his grandfather who served in the US Marine Corps. We're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>for</b> Joe, my friends, we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>for</b> him. The question Joe asked about our economy is important, because Senator Obama's plan would raise taxes on small businesses that employ 16 million Americans. Senator Obama's plan will kill those jobs at just the time when we need to be creating more jobs. My plan will create jobs, and that's what America needs." ...|$|E

2500|$|Somalia's {{envoy to}} Ethiopia has {{confirmed}} that Ethiopian-backed Somali government troops will lay siege to Mogadishu until it surrenders.

6000|$|... "As {{we may be}} {{possibly}} {{ordered to}} Spain," [...] Kennedy said, [...] "I should like {{to know a little}} about what we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> about; <b>for,</b> although I know a good deal about the war in Flanders, no news about that in Spain ever reached Kilkargan." ...|$|R
2500|$|Hughes {{met with}} the Victorian Political Executive of the Labor Party, chaired by Executive President E.J. Holloway. [...] "For an hour, he {{addressed}} members, trying by {{every one of his}} many oratorical, logical and political tricks to convert all, or at least some, of the Executive members to support his referendum campaign". Arguing on points of morale and maintaining Australian honour, Hughes concluded that he [...] "was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>for</b> a 'Yes' vote as though he were fighting for his very life". Holloway and his supporters were unconvinced, and were not moved by the speech. Hughes would have a similar lack of success at other state Labor organisations. Days later he spoke before the New South Wales Labor executive and then a special meeting convened of the New South Wales Trades and Labor Council. No records are kept of those meetings; however, motions were passed at their conclusion reaffirming opposition to conscription. Some prominent Labor politicians, though, including New South Wales Premier William Holman and South Australian Premier Crawford Vaughan, backed Hughes and rejected the party line. Ultimately, Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria declared themselves against the proposal in state caucuses. South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania did not take a position, and supported the principle of the referendum for the people to decide. Hughes had been unsuccessful in taking the bulk of his party along with him.|$|E

50|$|The {{war ended}} with the Kumanovo Treaty, with Yugoslav forces agreeing to {{withdraw}} from Kosovo {{to make way for}} an international presence. The Kosovo Liberation Army disbanded soon after this, with some of its members <b>going</b> on <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>for</b> the UÇPMB in the Preševo Valley and others joining the National Liberation Army (NLA) and Albanian National Army (ANA) during the armed ethnic conflict in Macedonia.|$|R

60|$|Slowly he {{went back}} to the old house and climbed the stairs. Only three rooms were there up-stairs, and one of these, his mother's, had not been opened for a long time. It seemed just the same as when he used to go to her with his stubbed toes and his troubles. She had died in that room. And now he was a man, <b>going</b> out <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>for</b> his country. How strange! Why? In his mother's room he could not answer that puzzling question. It stung him, and with a last look, a good-by, and a word of prayer on his lips, he turned to his own little room.|$|R

60|$|Walter shuddered--not so {{much from}} fear of the threat as from {{repulsion}} over the ugliness and vulgarity of it. But he held his head high and marched into school. Faith followed in a conflict of emotions. She hated to think of Walter fighting that little sneak, but oh, he had been splendid! And he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>for</b> HER--Faith Meredith--to punish her insulter! Of course he would win--such eyes spelled victory.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't expect he does {{think that}} we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>for</b> him, unless he can show us that it is to our {{interest}} to do so. I should imagine that he hopes that the effect of our appearance here will be to either induce his neighbors to come to some arrangement with him, or that he will endeavor to make peace with them by offering to throw us over, and to join with them against us." ...|$|E
2500|$|The actress {{said that}} Lynsey feels guilty {{because she is}} in a {{relationship}} with Riley behind Mercedes' back, but Lynsey feels that she deserves to be happy because she usually places everyone else's needs above her own. Mercedes discovers Lynsey's relationship with Riley, which Metcalfe explained comes as a shock to Mercedes who has developed a close friendship with Lynsey so does not react as expected. Hassan said that her character's love rivals, Mercedes and Mitzeee, [...] "won't be looking after Lynsey's best interests, so she's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>for</b> Riley's love. She's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take care of number one - and if other people get hurt in the process, then so be it". She added that Lynsey values her friendship with Mercedes and would not want to lose it while Mitzeee {{is a different kind of}} threat. Hassan went on to say that the storyline will become [...] "deeper and darker" [...] and is not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> end happily, as even though Lynsey and Riley make a good couple Lynsey has never been lucky with men.|$|R
60|$|The {{first thing}} was to provide funds. A {{great deal of money}} was {{required}} for these expeditions. Ships were to be bought and equipped for the purpose of transporting the troops to the East. Arms and ammunition were to be provided, and large supplies of food. Then the princes, and barons, and knights who were to accompany the expedition required very expensive armor, and costly trappings and equipments of all sorts; for, though the pretense was that they were <b>going</b> out <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>for</b> the recovery of the Holy Sepulchre under the influence of religious zeal, the real motive which animated them was love of glory and display. Thus it happened that the expense which a sovereign incurred in fitting out a crusade was enormous.|$|R
5000|$|In May 1918, {{tensions}} with the Bolsheviks provoked what is generally {{referred to as}} the Revolt of the Legions. Conflict already existed between trains of legionaries <b>going</b> east <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> on the Allied side and German and Austro-Hungarian prisoners (including some Czechs and Slovaks) <b>going</b> west <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>for</b> [...] "the other" [...] side. On 14 May 1918, the legionaries stopped a Hungarian train at Chelyabinsk in the Urals and shot a soldier who had thrown a stone at the Czechs, hitting one of Czechs and injuring him , killing a man. Then the local Bolshevik government arrested some of the Czechoslovaks and ordered them to be executed. Members of the Legion stormed the railway station, freed their men and subsequently occupied the city of Chelyabinsk. This incident triggered further hostilities between the Legion and the Bolsheviks.|$|R
60|$|O'FLAHERTY. I {{never told}} her one word that wasn't the {{truth and nothing but}} the truth.

That was how it was, sir. And sure the poor woman kissed me and went about the house singing in her old cracky voice that the French was on the sea, and they'd be here without delay, and the Orange will decay, says the Shan Van Vocht.|$|E

6000|$|If {{this war}} only lets me {{live long enough}} to {{understand}} its meaning! [...] Perhaps that meaning will be the meaning of life, in which case I am [...] longing for the unattainable.

When I ask myself what I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> [...] <b>for,</b> I answer--for my country, as a patriot--for my hate, as an [...] individual. My time is almost up. I go on duty.
