2500|$|... (2013), is a {{video game}} and tie-in comic book {{depicting}} {{a world in which}} Superman presides over an authoritarian regime. In an alternate universe Superman is married to Lois Lane, who becomes pregnant with his child. However, the Joker tricks Superman into killing Lois and their unborn son, which leads to the destruction of Metropolis (as there was a nuke located on Lois' heart that went off the moment her heart stopped beating). Driven over the edge by this, Superman kills the Joker in retaliation. Now corrupted, Superman takes drastic measures to [...] "save" [...] the world, forcing people to follow his will and killing those who resist. Many Justice League members join Superman's cause, though a few (such as Shazam and the Flash) are not as easily swayed. Batman sees the tyranny in this and created a group—the Insurgency—that is bent on stopping the new Regime. While Superman is able to achieve peace throughout the planet, he comes across obstacles other than the Insurgency: in Year Two the Green Lantern Corps try to overthrow him, causing him to develop a partnership with Sinestro. He pulls through after acquiring a Qwardian Power Ring to defeat the Corps. In Year Three he faces magic users—-magic being one of his few vulnerabilities. He is put into a magical sleep by Batman that leaves him trapped in a dream world of his own devices: the events that set him on his current path never took place, where he saved Lois and their unborn child. He imagines he and Lois go on to have a daughter named Lara Lane-Kent, a superhero in her own right, but is awoken by Ares, forcing him {{to live in a world}} where he has lost everything. His Regime and the Insurgency <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>fight</b> near the end of the Year, though their fray is put aside when Trigon and Mxyzptlk threaten to engulf them all with their fight. He and the others pull through after they and Doctor Fate are banished to another dimension. During the events of Year Four he finds the Greek Gods do not tolerate his actions, believing Superman is portraying himself as a false god. Superman eventually discovers that Ares and Darkseid are working together, so he confronts the latter and fights him to a standstill. He then goes on to confront Zeus, but the New God Highfather interrupts and convinces the Greek gods to permanently step down. Superman tries to capture Batman once more, but is convinced by Wonder Woman to focus on expanding his influence instead. The annual sees Superman placing the son of Plastic Man in an underwater maximum prison for captured super-villains called the Trench; when Plastic Man tries and fails to convince Superman to be lenient, he goes on to break into the prison and free all the villains and his son, destroying the Trench. The beginning of Year Five sees Superman simultaneously dealing with recapturing the villains and his obsession with finding Batman. He makes the controversial decision to employ villains like Bane and Killer Frost in the Regime for more help, much to the chargin of the others. This coupled with his more demanding personality puts him further at odds. When he discovers a group of people who oppose him and worship the Joker as a symbol, he finds them and kills over 200 innocent people in cold blood. He later sends serial killer Victor Zsasz after Alfred Pennyworth in an attempt to lure Batman out, though the plan fails when the Flash intervenes, causing Superman to lash out. Superman's brutality concerning the Jokers comes back to haunt him when Cyborg is abducted by the Insurgency, but Raven intervenes before the video can be leaked. Near the end of Year Five Catwoman reveals to Superman where the Insurgency is, and he Wonder Woman, and Hal go to confront him. Batman keeps them distracted as Batwoman and Batgirl work to bring over an alternate Justice League, succeeding and transporting the Regime across the world. After being defeated, the fallen Man of Steel is placed in a chamber that radiates red sun energy to negate his powers, though the final scene implies he may still have some degree of them.|$|E
