500|$|Due to {{the success}} of [...] "Give it Away", the band did not foresee [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] as being equally viable. Warner Bros. sent representatives to a Chili Peppers' concert in order to figure out what would {{ultimately}} be the next single. When Frusciante began playing [...] "Under the Bridge", Kiedis missed his cue; the entire audience began singing the song, instead. Kiedis was initially [...] "mortified that I had fucked up in front of Warner's people... I apologized for fucking up but they said 'Fucking up? Are you kidding me? When every single <b>kid</b> <b>at</b> the show sings a song, that's our next single.'" [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] was, therefore, selected as Blood Sugar Sex Magiks second single. By January 1992, [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] had exploded, peaking at number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100.|$|E

500|$|On February 2, 2011, {{at the age}} of twenty-seven, Peirsol {{announced}} that he was officially retiring from professional swimming. This ended months of speculation after Peirsol withdrew from his spots in both the 2010 FINA World Swimming Championships (25 m) in Dubai and the 2011 World Aquatics Championships in Shanghai. [...] Peirsol said he contemplated retirement after the 2008 Summer Olympics. [...] In 2010, he said he had no further goals and found it difficult to swim because he [...] "ended up doing everything (he) set out to do." [...] He added, [...] "Things outside of the sport started to interest me." [...] Peirsol said it was [...] "poetic" [...] that he ended his career at the same pool he trained in as a <b>kid</b> <b>at</b> the 2010 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships. Peirsol plans to go to graduate school at the University of Texas at Austin to study political science.|$|E
500|$|The {{film has}} {{received}} substantial criticism for its strong violence and language. One scene that viewers found particularly unnerving was the ear-cutting scene; Madsen himself reportedly had great difficulty finishing it, especially after Kirk Baltz ad-libbed the desperate plea [...] "I've {{got a little}} <b>kid</b> <b>at</b> home." [...] Many people walked out during the film. During a screening at Sitges Film Festival, fifteen people walked out, including horror film director Wes Craven and special makeup effects artist Rick Baker. Baker later told Tarantino to take the walkout as a [...] "compliment" [...] and explained that he found the violence unnerving because of its heightened sense of realism. Tarantino commented {{about it at the}} time: [...] "It happens at every single screening. For some people the violence, or the rudeness of the language, is a mountain they can't climb. That's OK. It's not their cup of tea. But I am affecting them. I wanted that scene to be disturbing." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first single}} off Blood Sugar Sex Magik was [...] "Give It Away", which reached {{number one on}} the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart in late 1991.

Records sent representatives to a Chili Peppers concert to determine which song should be the next single.

[...] "Under the Bridge" [...] became the album's second single in March 1992; upon release, journalist Jeff Apter noted that it [...] "was the bona fide, across-all-formats radio hit that the band had been working towards for seven years." [...] It spent twenty-six cumulative weeks on the United States Billboard Hot 100 chart, peaking at number two, being one of the several songs stuck behind Kris Kross' 8-week reign of [...] "Jump".

500|$|In 1970, Volk {{helped lead}} the Colts to another Super Bowl appearance, but were now {{representing}} the AFC following the merger of the two leagues (NFL and AFL) that year. [...] This time, the Colts defeated the Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowl V. [...] Volk was responsible for covering Pro Football Hall of Famers Bob Hayes and Mike Ditka in the Super Bowl, and he {{played a key role}} in the Colts' victory. [...] In the fourth quarter, the Colts trailed the Cowboys 136. [...] Volk intercepted a pass by Cowboys quarterback Craig Morton at the Dallas 33-yard line and returned it 30 yards to the 3-yard line to set up the tying touchdown. [...] Baltimore quarterback Earl Morrall later referred to Volk's interception as the play of the game. [...] Interviewed in 2009, Volk cited Super Bowl V as his fondest memory of playing in Baltimore. [...] He recalled team owner Carroll Rosenbloom flying the whole team, families included, to the Bahamas the day after the game: [...] "The next day we all got on the plane and flew over to the Bahamas. He took the whole family – my wife and one <b>kid,</b> <b>at</b> the time. I remember we were on the beach, Tom Mitchell and I, and we got the paper to make sure it was really true - that we did win.

500|$|After [...] "Freakshow" [...] is Blackouts eight track, [...] "Toy Soldier", a R and dance-pop song {{reminiscent}} of Destiny's Child's song [...] "Lose My Breath" [...] (2004) that showcases a military drumroll and Spears singing about needing a new lover. In [...] "Hot as Ice", a R song featuring background vocals by T-Pain, she sings {{in a higher}} register: [...] "I'm just a girl {{with the ability to}} drive a man crazy / Make him call me 'mama', make him my new baby." [...] Blackouts tenth track [...] "Ooh Ooh Baby" [...] contains a flamenco guitar and blends the beat from Gary Glitter's [...] "Rock and Roll" [...] (1972) and the melody of The Turtles' [...] "Happy Together" [...] (1967). In the lyrics, she sings to a lover [...] "Touch me and I come alive / I can feel you on my lips / I can feel you deep inside". Kara DioGuardi said she was inspired by the relationship between Spears and her first son in the studio, saying: [...] "I would look at the two of them, the way {{they looked at each other}} and the way she would hold the baby. It kind of struck me as interesting. At times it'd be about a <b>kid</b> <b>at</b> times about a lover." [...] "Perfect Lover", an R song, has a propulsive, clattery belly-dance beat in which Spears sings lyrics such as [...] "Tick-tock / Tick-tock / Come and get me while I'm hot". The twelfth track is [...] "Why Should I Be Sad", a midtempo R song directed to her ex-husband Kevin Federline. One of the bonus tracks, [...] "Everybody", samples Eurythmics' [...] "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)" [...] (1983). It features Spears singing about the dancefloor in a breathy lower register.|$|E
500|$|A {{teenager}} {{struggling to}} find his place in life ever since his parents disappeared {{when he was a}} child. A spider bites him {{on the back of his}} neck, giving him spider-powers. He becomes Spider-Man. Garfield described Parker as someone he can relate to and stated that the character had been an important influence on him since he was little. [...] Garfield drew from his life experiences as inspiration for the role, revealing, [...] "I was thinking of my history and thinking of the <b>kid</b> <b>at</b> school who I wasn't as strong as, who behaved badly to a lot of people– including myself– and who I constantly tried to stand up to but never had the physical prowess to". Discussing his predecessor, Garfield said he respects Tobey Maguire as an actor and that when he first saw Maguire play Spider-Man he [...] "was blown away by his interpretation." [...] Garfield said in interviews, including one in which he was interviewed by Maguire, that when he watched the film Spider-Man when he was younger, he would jokingly recite Maguire's lines in the mirror with a friend who joked that he would never be Spider-Man. On accepting the role Garfield explained, [...] "I see it as a massive challenge in many ways... To make it authentic. To make the character live and breathe in a new way. The audience already has a relationship with many different incarnations of the character. I do, as well. I'm probably going to be the guy in the movie theater shouting abuse at myself. But I have to let that go. No turning back. And I wouldn't want to." [...] After taking the role, Garfield studied the movements of athletes and spiders and tried to incorporate them, saying Parker is [...] "a boy/spider in terms of how he moves, and not just in the suit." [...] He did yoga and Pilates for the role in order to be as flexible as possible. When first wearing his costume Garfield admitted to shedding tears and trying to imagine [...] "a better actor in the suit", which he described as [...] "uncomfortable" [...] and admitted to wearing nothing beneath it since it is skintight. When filming Garfield explained that he had four months of training and described his physical roles on stunts as terribly challenging and exhausting.|$|E
