40|$|The first aim of {{this study}} is to {{identify}} possible natural <b>disasters</b> <b>and</b> catastrophes and to summarize the state of economic literature in the domain. Further are analyzed the methodologies used for estimating the economic impacts of <b>disasters</b> <b>and</b> catastrophes. The second aim is to compare <b>disasters</b> <b>and</b> catastrophes from several transition countries (Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Republic of Moldova, Poland, Romania and Ukraine) in the 1900 - 2014 time period, underlining their negative impact on the economy...|$|R

5|$|Owner Bill Veeck was {{concerned}} the promotion might {{turn into a}} <b>disaster</b> <b>and</b> checked {{himself out of the}} hospital, where he had been undergoing tests. The elder Veeck's fears were substantiated when he saw the people walking towards the ballpark that afternoon; many carried signs that described disco in profane terms.|$|E

40|$|The {{links between}} <b>disasters</b> <b>and</b> {{violence}} either self-directed or interpersonal {{are now more}} recognized. Nevertheless, the amount of research is limited.

Microsoft's public relations response to the debacle is also considered to be one of the poorest in the company's history, given Microsoft's reputation for micro-managing news releases, interviews and promotional events.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Thelma {{struck the}} Philippines just {{five months after}} the Ultra-Plinian {{eruption}} of Mount Pinatubo. The eruption resulted in the deaths of roughly 800people and left nearly 1million homeless.

30|$|Given {{the complex}} {{relationship}} between natural <b>disasters</b> <b>and</b> economic growth, researchers {{need to examine}} the potential effects of natural disasters in three distinctive phases: short-run (for example, emphasizing political transitions through economic growth), medium- to long-run (for example, focusing directly on natural <b>disasters</b> <b>and</b> economic growth), and very long-run (for example, highlighting deeper indicators of growth). On {{the basis of the}} literature review conducted, this article discusses the data and measurement issues as well as the estimation framework regarding natural <b>disasters</b> <b>and</b> economic growth within the same framework.|$|R
5|$|A {{few days}} after Babs struck the Philippines, then-Philippine {{president}} Joseph Estrada declared four provinces as a state of calamity and ordered the release of ₱200million (PHP) in emergency funds. Estrada later released an additional ₱50million (PHP) specifically for Catanduanes, as well as ₱10,000 sent {{to the family of}} each storm fatality. The Philippine Navy sent rubber boats to Bato, Catanduanes to help with relief there. The president ordered agencies to work together to respond to the <b>disaster</b> <b>and</b> for his Trade Secretary to watch for price gouging. However, food prices tripled following Babs and Zeb, especially after roads were blocked from agriculture areas, and ferries from unaffected areas were unable to travel due to the storm.|$|E
5|$|After Mao Zedong purged Peng in 1959, Mao {{appointed}} Marshal He Long to {{the head}} of an office to investigate Peng's past in order to find additional reasons to criticize Peng. He accepted the position but was sympathetic to Peng, and stalled for over a year before submitting his report. Mao's prestige weakened when it became widely known that Mao's Great Leap Forward had been a <b>disaster,</b> <b>and</b> He eventually presented a report that was positive, and which attempted to vindicate Peng.|$|E
5|$|Another tragedy {{occurred}} {{on the morning of}} 16 May 1968 when Ronan Point, a 23-storey tower block in Newham, suffered a structural collapse due to a natural gas explosion. Four people were killed in the <b>disaster</b> <b>and</b> seventeen were injured, as an entire corner of the building slid away. The collapse caused major changes in UK building regulations and led to the decline of further building of high rise council flats that had characterised 1960s public architecture.|$|E

5|$|Depression set {{in among}} members {{throughout}} the storm-battered community once the rebuilding process began. Fears of possible emigration stemming soon arose. Mayor Tai Herman feared that survivors would consider selling {{their homes and}} leave the Cook Islands altogether. Even Prime Minister Jim Marurai {{was reported to be}} left in shock by the scale of damage. The government enacted a three-month psychological support plan accordingly to help residents cope with the <b>disaster</b> <b>and</b> maintain social integrity among victims. Through September, 265people took advantage of this program.|$|E
5|$|Gulf {{also participated}} in a {{partnership}} with other majors, including Texaco, to build the Pembroke Catalytic Cracker refinery at Milford Haven and the associated Mainline Pipelines fuel distribution network. The eventual reopening of the Suez canal and upgrading of the older European oil terminals (Europoort and Marchwood) meant that the financial return from these projects was not all that had been hoped for. The Bantry terminal was devastated by the explosion of a Total tanker, the Betelgeuse, in January 1979 (Whiddy Island <b>Disaster)</b> <b>and</b> it was never fully reopened. The Irish government took over ownership of the terminal in 1986 and held its strategic oil reserve there.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Gyllenhaal {{starred in}} a dual {{role of a}} history teacher and his doppelgänger in the thriller Enemy, and in 2014, he {{produced}} and starred in the crime thriller Nightcrawler, receiving a Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild Award nomination for the latter role. In 2015, he starred in Antoine Fuqua's sports drama Southpaw, Baltasar Kormákur's Everest, {{an account of the}} 1996 Mount Everest <b>disaster,</b> <b>and</b> Jean-Marc Vallée's romantic comedy-drama Demolition. He was also on the jury for the main competition section of the 2015 Cannes Film Festival. In 2016, he starred in Tom Ford's thriller film Nocturnal Animals.|$|E
40|$|All {{forms of}} {{documentary}} materials {{are prone to}} <b>disasters</b> <b>and</b> theft. Security <b>and</b> <b>disaster</b> management are keys {{to the protection of}} library materials from theft and risks. However, librarians often overlook <b>disaster</b> preparedness <b>and</b> security control yet they are fundamental aspects of preservation management as they make it possible for people to have access to library materials, and to respond to <b>and</b> recover from <b>disasters.</b> A cross-sectional survey carried out between December 2005 and February 2006 in public libraries of KwaZulu-Natal revealed that the libraries were not adequately prepared for protecting documents against <b>disasters</b> <b>and</b> theft. Furthermore, most of the public libraries did not have disaster plans, adequate procedures for <b>disaster</b> response <b>and</b> recovery, satisfactory theft management strategies and sufficient staff with <b>disaster</b> management knowledge <b>and</b> skills...|$|R

5|$|In April 1878, L'Estrange reappeared on the Australian {{scene with}} a new {{performance}} – gas ballooning. The first balloon ascent in Australia {{had been made in}} Melbourne in 1853, with Sydney following five years later in December 1858. The idea that people could be lifted from the ground to fly and return safely fired the imagination of the public, and the novelty of balloon ascents continued to draw large crowds through the 1860s and 1870s. No doubt the very real chance of <b>disaster</b> <b>and</b> injury added to the crowd's keen interest, as mishaps were not uncommon.|$|E
5|$|In June 1627, George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham led an {{expedition}} to the island of Île de Ré to support the Huguenots besieged in La Rochelle by King Louis XIII of France. With no standing army, Buckingham's forces were largely volunteers and mercenaries. Since public opinion in England (particularly among extreme Protestants) supported the Huguenots, a number of well connected gentry came forward. The volunteers to join Buckingham included Temple, his elder brother John {{and other members of}} his family. The expedition to the Isle of Ré, was a <b>disaster</b> <b>and</b> altogether, Buckingham lost more than 5,000 men in the campaign out of a force of 7,000. Among those who died was Temple's brother.|$|E
5|$|In early 348 BC, the Athenians were {{distracted by}} events on Euboea, {{and were in}} no {{position}} to send much help to Olynthos. However, the expedition the Athenians sent to Euboea to try to maintain their position on the island was a <b>disaster,</b> <b>and</b> the Athenians had to seek peace with Chalcis, thereby effectively losing control of the island. It is possible that Philip actually incited the revolt on Euboea, though it considered more likely that this is a misreading of a speech of the Athenian politician Aeschines.|$|E
