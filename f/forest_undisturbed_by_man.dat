Outdoor recreational activities include hunting, fishing, wildlife viewing, hiking, horseback riding, and paddling, although there are few established trails.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{findings}} of a study to determine if using Mobile AR (augmented reality) to render an exhibit’s supplemental information increased the level of learning and enjoyment of visitors to a living museum, specifically the Pocock Trail located within the Bergen Swamp, which is classified as a “Living Museum”. A museum is identified as “Living” when it “is a natural, wild area that is relatively <b>undisturbed</b> <b>by</b> <b>man.</b> It is an area where the native plant and animal life are maintaining themselves in a natural, biological manner” (BSPS, 2016). When an area is <b>undisturbed</b> <b>by</b> <b>man</b> {{it is not possible to}} add traditional text-based exhibit descriptions on plaques or posters. AR adds digital content to the real world that visitors can interact with in the same manner that they interact with the physical world. It is used to evoke emotion, to tell a story, or to document an event (Craig, 2013). AR was used to augment the real world of the Bergen Swamp to add supplemental information that was viewed on a mobile device. The goal of this study was to determine whether the use of AR technology would enhance a visitor experience to this living museum compared to a traditional guided tour by a docent. Visitors were first provided a docent to guide them through the Pocock trail, and then the same visitors were provided an app to download which used an AR browser to guide them through the same trail...|$|R

Their halting-places were for the most part at religious houses, which then served the purpose of inns for travellers, being freely opened to those whom necessity or pleasure might cause to journey. Everywhere they found the monks in a state of alarm at the progress of the Danes, who, wherever they went, destroyed the churches and religious houses, and slew the monks.|$|R

50|$|Non-climate {{factors include}} soil, tree age, fire, tree-to-tree competition, genetic differences, logging or other human disturbance, {{herbivore}} impact (particularly sheep grazing), pest outbreaks, disease, and CO2 concentration. For factors which vary randomly over space (tree to tree or stand to stand), {{the best solution}} is to collect sufficient data (more samples) to compensate for confounding noise. Tree age is corrected for with various statistical methods: either fitting spline curves to the overall tree record or using similar aged trees for comparison over different periods (regional curve standardization). Careful examination and site selection helps to limit some confounding effects, for example picking sites <b>undisturbed</b> <b>by</b> modern <b>man.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Regardless of the {{presence}} of humans in Brazilian forests, titi monkeys customarily venture to dwell in [...] "disturbed" [...] forests (forests that have been cut down or invaded by humans) as long as the food availability is higher than in <b>undisturbed</b> <b>forests.</b> The use of disturbed and <b>undisturbed</b> <b>forest</b> <b>by</b> masked titi monkeys Callicebus personatus melanochir is proportional to food availability. The Atlantic Forest of eastern Brazil has been cut down to 5% of its original state with only 2% of that being <b>undisturbed</b> <b>forest.</b> Their existence is completely dependent on their ability to successfully reside in disturbed forests. However, titis {{do not seem to be}} aware of the difference between a disturbed and <b>undisturbed</b> <b>forest.</b> As previously mentioned, they feed opportunistically and therefore will reside in whatever forest has the most food available. As long as food is available to them (even if humans provide this food), it is feasible that the monkeys survive the deforestation of much of the Southern American rain forests.|$|R
40|$|The {{structural}} {{complexity of}} old-growth forests {{allows them to}} play many distinctive functional and compositional roles that are not fulfilled <b>by</b> younger <b>forests.</b> Left <b>undisturbed</b> <b>by</b> humans, these <b>forests</b> function as reservoirs of biological diversity, regulate energy and material cycles, and allow {{us the opportunity to}} study and understand natural forest processes, {{while at the same time}} providing significant recreational, existence, and heritage values. While old-growth forests are relatively rare in the eastern United States due to historic land use patterns, the Blue Ridge province in western North Carolina contains one of the highest remaining concentrations of these forests. Management of the Pisgah National Forest provides a wonderful opportunity to conserve many areas of old-growth in this region. In this master’s project, a series of Geographical Information System models was developed to prioritize a network of small, medium, and large patches of forest on the Pisgah National Forest to be conserved and managed as old-growth. The prioritization was based on criteria established by the USDA Forest Service, the amount of high quality old-growth forest contained by the patches, and other ecological considerations. Patches selected by the models were well distributed spatially and would conserve most of the identified high quality old-growth habitat on the Forest, though they underrepresented certain natural community types. Many of the chosen patches may not currently exhibit old-growth conditions and will have to be restored. It is important that selected patches for old-growth conservation be given permanent protective status so that natural processes are allowed to proceed uninterrupted. The set of models developed in this project can be used to help guide policy and management decisions by the Forest Service relating to its plans to conserve and restore old-growth across the Pisgah National Forest...|$|R
40|$|A {{modelling}} system (MS) {{for evaluation of}} current increment (net and gross growth) and mortality in Russian forests is presented. The informational basis of the MS are the data of the Russian forest state account (growing stock by dominant species, age, site indices, stocking) and some additional indicators (types of age structure, average species composition, type and intensity of disturbance regimes by ecoregions and/or landscapes. The MS includes model blocks generated with available information including yield tables (general, regional, full-stocked, with different stocking and types of age structure), growth tables, models, and experimental data for managed and unmanaged, disturbed and <b>undisturbed</b> <b>forests.</b> Two-dimensional (<b>by</b> age and site index) and three-dimensional (age, site index and stocking) models by species and ecoregions, based on regularities of coefficients of Mitscherlich growing functions, were used as the nuclei of the MS. The preliminary results, received for several Russian forest forming species gave a good fit to experimental data...|$|R
5000|$|The Sierra de Tamaulipas has the {{characteristics}} of a Sky island—isolated from the Sierra Madre Oriental and rising high enough to have cooler and wetter conditions than the adjacent land at lower elevations. The area surrounding the Sierra at elevations below 1000 ft is vegetated primarily by a tropical thorn forest (Tamaulipan mezquital). The Sierra, with higher rainfall and lower temperatures, has three major vegetation types. Tropical deciduous forest (Veracruz moist forests) is found at elevations of 1000 to 2300 ft. The average height of this closed-canopy forest is about 25 ft. Montane scrub is found in dry areas between 2000 and 2900 ft elevation. This vegetation type consists of low thickets and savanna. Huisache is a common shrub. Pine-oak forests found at elevations of greater than 2600 ft are an island of temperate forest in the ecoregion of Sierra Madre Oriental pine-oak <b>forests.</b> In areas <b>undisturbed</b> <b>by</b> agriculture and logging, vegetation at the higher altitudes can be luxuriant with many ferns. [...] In the southeastern part of the Sierra in the municipality of Aldama, Tamaulipas is a limestone karst area in which many caves and cenotes (water-filled sinkholes) are found, including Zacatón which is the deepest sinkhole in the world with a depth of 1112 ft. In 1994, cave-diving pioneer Sheck Exley died attempting to dive to the bottom of Zacatón.|$|R
40|$|Although {{increasing}} {{efforts are}} being made to restore tropical forests, little information is available regarding the time scales required for carbon and plant biodiversity to recover to the values associated with <b>undisturbed</b> <b>forests.</b> To address this knowledge gap, we carried out a meta-analysis comparing data from more than 600 secondary tropical forest sites with nearby <b>undisturbed</b> reference <b>forests.</b> Above-ground biomass approached equivalence to reference values within 80 years since last disturbance, whereas below-ground biomass took longer to recover. Soil carbon content showed little relationship with time since disturbance. Tree species richness recovered after about 50 years. By contrast, epiphyte richness did not reach equivalence to <b>undisturbed</b> <b>forests.</b> The proportion of <b>undisturbed</b> <b>forest</b> trees and epiphyte species found in secondary forests was low and changed little over time. Our results indicate that carbon pools and biodiversity show different recovery rates under passive, secondary succession and that colonization <b>by</b> <b>undisturbed</b> <b>forest</b> plant species is slow. Initiatives such as the Convention on Biological Diversity and REDD+ should therefore encourage active management to help to achieve their aims of restoring both carbon and biodiversity in tropical forests...|$|R
