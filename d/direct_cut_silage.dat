40|$|The aim was {{to compare}} the effects of {{additives}} on <b>direct</b> <b>cut</b> <b>silages</b> of pure timothy and timothy mixed with tetraploid red clover. First and second growth cuts were ensiled during three consecutive years, 1994, 1995 and 1996, either without any additive or {{with the addition of}} formic acid, or lactic acid bacteria in combination with molasses. Effects of the additives on the degradation characteristics of the herbage and the silages were analysed using an automatic in vitro gas production (GP) technique. At the end of the in vitro procedures, organic matter and neutral-detergent fibre (NDF) degradabilities were determined. The tetraploid red clover persisted in the leys during the 3 years and was the dominant species at the second growth in the mixed leys. The herbage from the mixed crops had lower dry-matter contents, higher crude protein concentrations and higher buffering capacity compared with the pure timothy at both cuts. In general, the additives reduced pH, and the concentrations of ammonium-N and acetic acid in the silages. The treated silages had a more rapid faster GP in both crops. The silages from the mixed crop benefited more from the additives compared with the grass silages. The additives affected the soluble fractions as well as the NDF degradability of the silages of the mixed crop more than those fractions of the grass silages. The addition of molasses in combination with a commercial inocula resulted in increased production of lactic acid and ethanol in silages from both crops.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{describe}} and compare timothy (Phleum pratense L.) and red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) as forage for dairy cattle {{on the basis of}} the chemical composition and the in vitro degradation characteristics. Initially the degradation characteristics determined with an in vitro gas production technique and an in vitro filter bag technique were compared. Both techniques were found to be interesting tools for providing relevant degradation parameters for feed evaluation models. Thereafter the degradation characteristics and nutritive value of forages of timothy and red clover were described with recordings of in vitro gas production and chemical analysis. Analysis of the herbage of red clover and timothy showed that red clover contained lower concentrations of neutral detergent fibre (NDF) and had lower degradability of neutral detergent fibre (NDFD) on all harvest occasions. Red clover had on average a higher maximal fractional degradation rate (FDRmax) of the whole forage compared to timothy. The FDRmax for the NDF in red clover was not different from that in timothy. In timothy the components soluble in neutral detergent solution had a higher FDRmax compared to those in red clover. Timothy and red clover were conserved as <b>direct</b> <b>cut</b> <b>silages</b> with the addition of conservation additives. It was found that timothy and red clover herbage responded differently to the silage additives. Silages treated with additives had a shorter time until half of the gas was produced, as well as a shorter time until the maximal fractional degradation rate was reached, indicating a faster in vitro degradation compared to that of untreated silages. The use of additives improved the NDFD in silage with red clover but not that in the silage of pure timothy. The relationships between the feed characteristics and the relative silage intake in dairy cows were evaluated. It was found that the preparation technique for silage samples was important and that wet silage samples had a higher gas production and different kinetics compared to dried samples. It was concluded that chemical analysis in combination with the in vitro gas production technique can be a cost-efficient tool for relative prediction of silage intake based on feed characteristics. The predictions can be used to compose feed rations that will optimize silage intake in relation to milk production and to improve conservation management...|$|R

40|$|Economic {{values were}} {{calculated}} for grass traits of economic importance in Irish grass-based ruminant production systems.

The Moorepark Dairy Systems Model was used to simulate a dairy farm. Economic values were calculated by simulating {{the effect of a}} unit change in the trait of interest while holding all other traits constant. The base scenario involved a fixed herd size and land area (40 ha), and an annual DM yield of 13 t/ha. The economic values generated under the base scenario were: € 0. 152 /kg for DM yield in spring, € 0. 030 /kg for DM yield in mid-season and € 0. 103 /kg for DM yield in autumn; € 0. 001, € 0. 008, € 0. 010, € 0. 009, € 0. 008 and € 0. 006 per 1 g/kg change in DMD for the months of April to September, respectively; € 0. 03 /kg for 1 st <b>cut</b> <b>silage</b> DM yield, € 0. 02 /kg for 2 nd <b>cut</b> <b>silage</b> DM yield; and − € 4. 961 for a 1 percent reduction in persistency. Alternative scenarios were examined to determine the sensitivity of the economic values to changes in annual DM yield, sward utilisation and a scenario where silage production was the focus of the system. The economic values were used to calculate a total merit index for each of 20 perennial ryegrass cultivars based on production data from a 3 year plot study. The rank correlation between the merit index values for the cultivars under the base scenario and the scenario involving a reduction in herbage utilisation was 1. 0, while that with the scenario involving reduced annual DM yield was 0. 94. It is concluded that the total merit index can be used to identify cultivars that can generate the greatest economic contribution to a grass-based production system, regardless of system or intensity of grass production. peer-reviewedDepartment of Agriculture and Food, Stimulus Funding RSF 07 52...|$|R

The advantage of this parameter over possible alternatives is that it allows for an a priori estimation of the total cost of labelling all vertices.

Grass clover silage was harvested in three maturity stages of orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.) that was a dominant grass in the sward: late vegetative (GS 1), internode elongation (GS 2) i and flowering (GS 3). Classical chemical analysis methods were used to analyse 16 samples of each of the maturity stage. Dry matter (DM) content of GS 1, GS 2 and GS 3 was 396, 408 and 463 g kg- 1 of the fresh sample, respectively, while crude protein (CP) content was 120, 98 and 90 g kg- 1 DM respectively.

40|$|Organic cereal {{production}} in southeast Australia is challenging for producers {{due to a}} range of e of influences such as weeds and low soil available phosphorus. Two experiments were conducted on a certified organic property at Berrigan NSW during 2001 - 2003 to investigate ‘within crop’ weed management and forage crop management for weed control. Sowing later using a short season wheat cultivar did not affect yield and reduced (P< 0. 05) levels of annual ryegrass (Lolium rigidum Gaud.). Incorporating a forage crop into the rotation prior to sowing a cereal resulted in improved (P< 0. 05) weed management for the cereal crop, in comparison to retaining annual pasture. There were no differences between forage treatments in weed management in the following wheat crop. Where forage was <b>cut</b> for <b>silage</b> and then grazed, grain yield was higher (P< 0. 05) than where forage was only grazed or <b>cut</b> for <b>silage,</b> or where annual pasture was retained...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop new {{algorithmic}} machinery for solving hard problems on graphs of bounded rank-width and on digraphs of bounded bi-rank-width in polynomial (XP, to be precise) time. These include, particularly, graph colour-ing and chromatic polynomial problems, the Hamiltonian path and c-min-leaf outbranching, the <b>directed</b> <b>cut,</b> and more generally MSOL-partitioning prob-lems on digraphs. Our {{focus on a}} formally clean and unified approach for the considered algorithmic problems is in contrast with many previous published XP algorithms running on graphs of bounded clique-width, which mostly used ad hoc techniques and ideas. The new contributions include faster algorithms for computing the chromatic number and the chromatic polynomial on graphs of bounded rank-width, and new algorithms for solving the defective colouring, the min-leaf outbranching, and the <b>directed</b> <b>cut</b> problems...|$|R

The impact of non-ideal initial conditions is studied through <b>direct</b> <b>cut</b> back measurements of the longitudinal evolution of the emerging soliton dynamics, and is shown {{to be associated with}} the splitting of the Peregrine soliton into two subpulses...|$|R
40|$|Several of {{the finest}} {{unclaimed}} prizes in directed graph theory involve the packing of directed joins. One difficulty in claiming these prizes is that the broad conjecture posed by Edmonds and Giles, whether {{the maximum number of}} disjoint directed joins equals the smallest weight of a <b>directed</b> <b>cut</b> in every weighted directed graph, is not true in general. This is {{despite the fact that the}} conjecture is true in several special cases, and is also true if the roles of directed joins and <b>directed</b> <b>cuts</b> are reversed. Another difficulty is that the known minimal counterexamples, one found by Schrijver and two found by Cornuéjols and Guenin during a computer search, are mysterious in nature. We dispel some of this mystery by providing a framework for understanding the known counterexamples. We then use this framework to construct several new counterexamples, and to prove that every “smallest ” minimal counterexample has now been found. Finally, we temper these advances by introducing an NP-completeness result for a more difficult problem...|$|R
