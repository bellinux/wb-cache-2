30|$|Since {{the first}} {{development}} of a cell surface display system on bacteriophage by ([Smith 1985]), various yeast cell surface displaying systems {{have been developed for}} expression of <b>heterologous</b> <b>proteins</b> ([Sergeeva et al. 2006]). Yeast cell surface display {{has been used as a}} method of choice for expression of <b>heterologous</b> <b>proteins.</b> This is because yeast cell surface display is convenient, shows ease of handling of displayed <b>heterologous</b> <b>proteins</b> and has been found to be comparatively stable against environmental changes ([Inaba et al. 2010]). In addition, the advantage of yeast cell surface display over bacterial display is that yeast has a post-translational modification system that resembles the mammalian system for efficient processing and folding of proteins ([Kondo and Ueda, 2004]). Cell surface displaying systems in yeast, in particular Saccharomyces cerevisiae, have been studied extensively ([Kondo and Ueda, 2004];[Furukawa et al. 2006]). Although S. cerevisiae emerged as the most favourable microorganism for displaying <b>heterologous</b> <b>proteins</b> ([Kondo and Ueda, 2004]), hyperglycosylation of expressed proteins has remained a major drawback ([Gemmill and Trimble, 1999]). Hyperglycosylation of <b>heterologous</b> <b>proteins</b> has a potential to affect protein activity ([Wang et al. 2007]). Other yeasts, such as Pichia pastoris have been reported to express <b>heterologous</b> <b>proteins</b> with reduced glycosylation ([Choi et al. 2003]). More recently, cell surface display of active <b>heterologous</b> <b>proteins</b> in both Y. lipolytica and P. pastoris has gained momentum.|$|R

Another method of <b>heterologous</b> <b>protein</b> fusion is fusion with fimbriae/flagella, which are filamentous protrusions on the cell surface.

S. lividans cells lacking intact proteasome genes are phenotypically indistinguishable from the wild-type or the complemented strain containing functional proteasomes. Using the expression and secretion signals of the subtilisin inhibitor of Streptomyces venezuelae CBS 762. 70 (Vsi) for shuTNFRII and those of tyrosinase of Streptomyces antibioticus (MelC 1) for the production of sCT, both proteins were secreted in significantly higher amounts in the strain PRO 41 than in the wild-type S. lividans TK 24 or the complemented strain PRO 41 R. However, the secretion of other <b>heterologous</b> <b>proteins</b> such as shuTNFRI was not enhanced in the proteasome-deficient strain.

50|$|Heterologous gene {{expression}} {{is used in}} many biotechnological applications, including protein production and metabolic engineering. Because tRNA pools vary between different organisms, the rate of transcription and translation of a particular coding sequence can be less efficient when placed in a non-native context. For an overexpressed transgene, the corresponding mRNA makes a large percent of total cellular RNA, {{and the presence of}} rare codons along the transcript can lead to inefficient use and depletion of ribosomes and ultimately reduce levels of <b>heterologous</b> <b>protein</b> production. However, using codons that are optimized for tRNA pools in a particular host to overexpress a heterologous gene may also cause amino acid starvation and alter the equilibrium of tRNA pools. This method of adjusting codons to match host tRNA abundances, called codon optimization, has traditionally been used for expression of a heterologous gene. However, new strategies for optimization of heterologous expression consider global nucleotide content such as local mRNA folding, codon pair bias, a codon ramp or codon correlations.|$|E

50|$|Inclusion {{bodies are}} dense electron-refractile {{particles}} of aggregated protein found {{in both the}} cytoplasmic and periplasmic spaces of E. coli during high-level expression of <b>heterologous</b> <b>protein.</b> It is generally assumed that high level expression of non-native protein (higher than 2% of cellular protein) and highly hydrophobic protein is more prone to lead to accumulation as inclusion bodies in E. coli. In the case of proteins having disulfide bonds, formation of protein aggregates as inclusion bodies is anticipated since the reducing environment of bacterial cytosol inhibits the formation of disulfide bonds. The diameter of spherical bacterial inclusion bodies varies from 0.5-1.3 μm and the protein aggregates have either an amorphous or paracrystalline nature depending on the localization.

40|$|Streptomycetes {{have become}} {{attractive}} hosts for <b>heterologous</b> <b>protein</b> production due to for instance, {{their ability to}} efficiently secrete their proteins in the extracellular environment. Among these microbes, Streptomyces lividans, known to have a reduced restriction-modification barrier, has been used more extensively for <b>heterologous</b> <b>protein</b> production. Hitherto, studies on metabolic characterization and engineering of S. lividans for <b>heterologous</b> <b>protein</b> production are limited, and of these, few are performed in (upscale) controlled fermentation environments. Without metabolomics, the metabolic impact/load that <b>heterologous</b> <b>protein</b> production exerts on the central carbon metabolism of S. lividans remains loosely understood, and can not easily be relieved. Therefore, the general objective of this dissertation was to characterize the growth and metabolism of S. lividans producing heterologous proteins in (upscale) controlled fermentation environments. The study is further extended to assess the effect of overexpressing the gene (pck) encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase on <b>heterologous</b> <b>protein</b> production in S. lividans. A genome scale metabolic network model of wild-type S. lividans was extended to include mouse tumor necrosis factor-alpha (mTNF-alpha) production. The resulting model matrix was mathematically analyzed to check for its inherent properties and sensitivity to key measurable fluxes. Results obtained showed that model sensitivity to mTNF-alpha was tenfold higher than biomass production, while the latter was at least tenfold more sensitive than the measurable amino acid fluxes. Metabolic characterization of recombinant S. lividans, {{in comparison with the}} wild-type S. lividans, was done to assess metabolic impact based on both extracellular metabolomics and constraint-based modeling. Results obtained showed that the metabolic impact due to <b>heterologous</b> <b>protein</b> production results in lower substrate uptake and slower growth, the former an indication for metabolic channeling. The metabolic impact is widely-distributed in the genome of S. lividans, causing a great shift in its performance. Critical exchange fluxes in the recombinant cells or models performance have been identified as biomass, mTNF-alpha, histidine, valine and alanine. Finally, based on metabolic engineering techniques, it was revealed that pck overexpression in S. lividans TK 24 results in up to 1. 7 -fold increase in hTNF-alpha production. The major findings in this dissertation are an indication of metabolic shifts within the recombinant cell as well as a positive correlation between the explored metabolic engineering approach and <b>heterologous</b> <b>protein</b> production. status: publishe...|$|E

However, saturated translocation of <b>heterologous</b> <b>proteins</b> through the SecYEG pathway might cause severe cell death. A threshold ratio (Critical Value, CV) of pre-mature protein to mature protein in the lysate was previously formulated to correlate with host cell viability to enable maximum secretory production of <b>heterologous</b> <b>proteins.</b> In this study, {{based on the}} guidance of CV, we demonstrated the use of four efficient B. subtilis promoters, vegG P and its three variants, which exhibited different transcriptional strengths to furnish graded expression of a Cellulomonas fimi endoglucanase (Eng) in E. coli. A practical approach of viable cell counts was established to predict the maximum tolerable level of secretory Eng, thereby enabling a fast access to a secretory level of Eng that was close to its CV. Furthermore, employing a C. fimi exoglucanase (Exg) as a model, it was shown that its CV, which identified the tolerable limit of secretory production of Exg, might be largely increased from a ratio of 20 / 80 to 45 / 55 upon co-expression of the phage shock protein A (PspA). Using the E. coli (pM 1 VegGCexLpspA) co-expression system, after induced expression of Exg and PspA with IPTG and L-arabinose, respectively, the Exg activity detected in the culture medium was 1. 65 U/ml, which was 80 % higher than the best yield ever reported for this protein.
