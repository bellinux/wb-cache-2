50|$|Twelve Quays has a <b>floating</b> <b>landing</b> <b>stage</b> in {{the river}} that can take two ro-ro ferries at the same time. The {{terminal}} provides vehicle parking space {{on the site of}} the former Wallasey Dock.|$|E
50|$|In 1847, {{the first}} <b>floating</b> <b>landing</b> <b>stage,</b> which {{rose and fell}} with the tide so that boats could dock at any time, was opened at Liverpool. The first portion, known as the Georges' landing stage, was {{designed}} by William Cubitt and was 500 feet long. It was rebuilt and extended in 1874.|$|E
50|$|Until the {{establishment}} of the Mersey Railway in 1886, the ferries were the only means of crossing the river, and so all of the routes were heavily used. All of the ferry routes were owned by private interests before coming under municipal ownership in the mid 19th century. The Woodside ferry was taken over by the Birkenhead Commissioners in 1858 and, in 1861, the Wallasey Local Board took over the ferry services at Seacombe, Egremont and New Brighton. At Woodside, land between the Woodside Hotel {{and the end of the}} old pier was reclaimed, and in 1861 the <b>floating</b> <b>landing</b> <b>stage</b> was opened. The pontoons were towed into position, moored by chains originally made for the SS Great Eastern, and linked to the mainland by two double bridges.|$|E
50|$|The current {{ferry boat}} is {{constructed}} principally of wood, and {{was built in}} 1946. The hull is 10.7 m long and 5.1 m wide, with 4.95 m long landing ramps at each end. The engine house is cantilevered approximately 1.1 m out to the side. Because {{of the variation in}} the water level in Lake Hume, the ferry operates between <b>floating</b> <b>landing</b> <b>stages</b> which are attached to each bank. The position of the <b>landing</b> <b>stages</b> is adjusted by hand winch to suit the level of the water.|$|R
50|$|It had {{two main}} {{platforms}} of 795 ft and 698 ft, with a centre release track between them, and a 560 ft bay platform, all {{covered by a}} roof. Beyond the buffers were waiting rooms and an inspector's office. It was rebuilt in 1945 after bomb damage. On {{the opposite side of}} Princes Parade from the station were the Customs examination rooms and the <b>floating</b> Princes <b>Landing</b> <b>Stage,</b> where the ships berthed.|$|R
50|$|The {{full length}} of the pier was {{refurbished}} in 2011-2012 and a <b>floating</b> pontoon <b>landing</b> <b>stage</b> was installed at the seaward end of the pier. The works included replacing all of the timber decking and the steel beams supporting the deck, and restoring the pier to its full width. The pier was reopened in May 2012. The designer of the pier refurbshment was the Colwyn Bay office of Capita Symonds Ltd, and the contractor was BAM Nuttall Ltd.|$|R
50|$|There {{followed}} {{a period of}} private ownership by local landowners of the numerous ferry services on the Wirral bank of the River Mersey, including at Woodside. By the 18th century, an increase in stage coach traffic from Chester spurred {{the growth of the}} transportation of passengers and goods across the river. With the rapid development of Birkenhead from the 1820s, facilities at Woodside would eventually need expanding. By 1842, the ferry service had been taken over by the Birkenhead Commissioners.A stone pier with two slipways and a small lighthouse at the pier head were constructed.There {{followed a}}nother period of major rebuilding, which included land reclamation up {{to the end of the}} pier. Construction of a <b>floating</b> <b>landing</b> <b>stage</b> in 1861 allowed for combined usage by the ferries and the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board. Improvements were made to the ferry's fleet at Woodside in 1890, with the replacement of paddle steamers for twin screw steamers.|$|E
5000|$|The £9.2 {{million grant}} [...] from the UK {{government}} {{came with the}} strange condition that the terminal could only be used for cruise port-of-calls, which meant cruises {{would not be allowed}} to begin or end at the terminal. [...] "Turnaround" [...] visits generate more revenue for the port and city than port-of-calls. The reason for the strange restriction was that it was to minimize unfair competition with other ports that had been built with private funding, particularly Southampton. [...] Liverpool City Council tried unsuccessfully to have this restriction removed in 2009. In July 2011, the council offered to pay back part of the UK government funding in exchange for being allowed turnaround visits, which led Associated British Ports, the owner of Southampton Docks, to take legal advice. [...] The Southampton Chamber of Commerce collected 12,000 signatures on a petition against the change. [...] Liverpool city council did cite that £70 million of public money was spent in upgrading the rail link from Southampton Docks to the Midlands container terminals competing directly with the Port of Liverpool. This fell on deaf ears. However, in March 2012, the government agreed a repayment offer from Liverpool Council and construction of a temporary terminal buildings began on the shore and <b>floating</b> terminal <b>landing</b> <b>stage.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to identify ways in which people think about climate change and possible responses to it, and the value of events such as the <b>Floating</b> <b>Land</b> Festival. We invited artists, visitors to the <b>Floating</b> <b>Land</b> event and residents of Boreen Point to participate in a photovoice workshop. Participants were asked to take photos with their digital cameras about their perceptions of being at or living at the water’s edge in a time of uncertainty caused by climate change. Each of the 3 categories of participants then shared their photos in a small group and selected photos to present the group’s views to a wider audience {{on the last day of}} the festival. Attendees at the presentation completed a questionnaire which provided researchers with feedback on the effect of the photos, the ‘At the Water’s Edge’ project, the <b>Floating</b> <b>Land</b> event, and on participants’ attitudes to climate change. The 3 group presentations are presented here. We welcome your comments about the ideas these photos communicate about the festival and issues of rising seas and climate change.
