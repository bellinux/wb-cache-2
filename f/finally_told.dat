5|$|Henry's {{succession}} {{plans were}} thrown into chaos by {{the sinking of}} the White Ship on 25 November 1120. Henry had left the port of Barfleur for England in the early evening, leaving William Adelin and many of the younger members of the court to follow on that night in a separate vessel, the White Ship. Both the crew and passengers were drunk and, just outside the harbour, the ship hit a submerged rock. The ship sank, killing as many as 300 people, with only one survivor, a butcher from Rouen. Henry's court was initially too scared to report William's death to the King. When he was <b>finally</b> <b>told,</b> he collapsed with grief.|$|E
5|$|Max and Steph become {{attracted}} to each other. Max plunges into grief and remorse for bringing estranged wife Clare Cunningham (Gemma Bissix) {{into the lives}} of the people he cares about. Steph feels sorry for him and invites him out. Max tries to kiss her. Steph and Max began to misread each other and, even as they developed feelings for each other, assume there is no chance at a relationship. When Max took Tom to the safari park to see an elephant named Romeo, that Steph had sponsored for him, Steph found him and they <b>finally</b> <b>told</b> each other that they liked each other and agreed to get into a relationship. Tom initially disapproves of their relationship, but comes around to the idea.|$|E
25|$|On 28 May, he was <b>finally</b> <b>told</b> {{that the}} lottery was approved, {{but only on}} {{condition}} that the Universal-Lexicon {{was removed from the}} offer. This was probably the most attractive prize.|$|E
25|$|<b>Finally,</b> Spínola <b>told</b> the {{audience}} {{that there was a}} political goal from the Exposition: to serve as a pacific event to work toward the unification of the Central American republics.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Finally,</b> Pocahontas <b>told</b> Smith {{that she}} and her fellow Native Americans had thought him dead, but her father had told Tomocomo to seek him [...] "because your countrymen will lie much".|$|R

25|$|Barry is a cockney barrow-boy, and an {{unlikely}} partner for the gay, middle classed yuppie, Colin Russell (Michael Cashman). He is {{much younger than}} his middle-aged boyfriend and as such Colin's role is almost paternal. Barry is open about his sexuality to everyone except his volatile father — and when he is <b>finally</b> <b>told</b> he takes the news so badly that Barry turns straight just to appease him — although he is never very successful at it.|$|E
25|$|The Trojan {{survivors}} escape with {{a number}} of ships, seeking to establish a new homeland elsewhere. They land in several nearby countries that prove inhospitable, and are <b>finally</b> <b>told</b> by an oracle that they must return to the land of their forebears. They first try to establish themselves in Crete, where Dardanus had once settled, but find it ravaged by the same plague that had driven Idomeneus away. They find the colony led by Helenus and Andromache, but decline to remain. After seven years they arrive in Carthage, where Aeneas has an affair with Queen Dido. (Since according to tradition Carthage was founded in 814 BC, the arrival of Trojan refugees a few hundred years earlier exposes chronological difficulties within the mythic tradition.) Eventually the gods order Aeneas to continue onward, and he and his people arrive {{at the mouth of the}} Tiber River in Italy. Dido commits suicide, and Aeneas's betrayal of her was regarded as an element in the long enmity between Rome and Carthage that expressed itself in the Punic Wars and led to Roman hegemony.|$|E
500|$|Jamie Delano {{returned}} to the title on several occasions. Between the Garth Ennis and Paul Jenkins runs on Hellblazer, he <b>finally</b> <b>told</b> the story of why John's best friend Chas 'owes' him, and he returned again {{for one of the}} five Christmas stories in issue #250. He also wrote the mini series The Horrorist in 1995, and [...] in 2000, both featuring John Constantine. A more substantial return was made in 2010 for a hardcover graphic novel [...] with artist Jock to commemorate the 25th anniversary of John Constantine's first appearance in Swamp Thing.|$|E
5000|$|William Christensen was {{interested}} in producing a comic adaptation of Miller's [...] "lost" [...] screenplay, of which he possessed a copy. Christensen soon got in contact with Miller, who was enthusiastic {{about the idea of}} his story <b>finally</b> being <b>told</b> uncensored.|$|R
60|$|The crab began {{laughing}} again, {{which so}} provoked the zebra {{that he tried}} to shake the little creature off. This resulted in more ear-pinching, and <b>finally</b> Dorothy <b>told</b> them that if they could not behave they must go back to the forest.|$|R
60|$|Peter hesitated {{and looked}} {{a wee bit}} foolish. <b>Finally</b> he <b>told</b> Tommy Tit all about the two soft, gentle eyes he had seen peeping at him from behind a big fern, and how {{he wanted to know}} who the eyes belonged to.|$|R
500|$|Pinter and Merchant {{had both}} met Fraser in 1969, when all three worked {{together}} on a National Gallery programme about Mary, Queen of Scots; several years later, on 8–9 January 1975, Pinter and Fraser became romantically involved. [...] That meeting initiated their five-year extramarital love affair. After hiding the relationship from Merchant {{for two and a}} half months, on 21 March 1975, Pinter <b>finally</b> <b>told</b> her [...] "I've met somebody". [...] After that, [...] "Life in Hanover Terrace gradually became impossible", and Pinter moved out of their house on 28 April 1975, five days after the première of No Man's Land.|$|E
500|$|In the beginning, Margaret Weis had {{problems}} depicting Tanis Half-Elven in the novels. Tracy Hickman <b>finally</b> <b>told</b> her [...] "He's James T. Kirk of the Starship Enterprise." [...] After that explanation, Margaret {{had no more}} difficulty writing about Tanis. Other noteworthy antagonists, and sometimes protagonists, are the Death Knight Lord Soth and Kitiara Uth Matar, the half-sister of Raistlin and Caramon, and leader {{of one of the}} Dragonarmies of Ansalon. According to Hickman, Lord Soth is the most unpredictable character to write about, saying [...] "Every time that character made an appearance in one of our books he would try to run off with the story." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{working at}} the Fair, Sarria learned that his {{longtime}} companion, Jimmy Moore, had died. Moore had been a frequent drinker throughout their relationship and had been arrested {{a number of times}} for public drunkenness. A judge <b>finally</b> <b>told</b> Moore that the next time he was arrested he would be given the maximum sentence. Moore was arrested again and, scared of a long prison term, hanged himself in jail. Although devastated, Sarria could not come home from the exposition. At {{the end of the season}} he returned and he and Moore's father consoled each other. [...] "And so, that ended my big romance. The great love of my life. It carried on for nine years." ...|$|E

40|$|Robert Campbell 2 ̆ 7 s {{story has}} <b>finally</b> been <b>told.</b> Although {{at least three}} theses and one {{dissertation}} covering some aspect or period of his life (1804 - 1879) do exist, William Nester has now rendered an excellent full-dress biography of this Rocky Mountain entrepreneur, St. Louis businessman, and Indian commissioner...|$|R
500|$|By this time, Booth {{was arguing}} so vehemently with his older, pro-Union brother Edwin about Lincoln {{and the war}} that Edwin <b>finally</b> <b>told</b> {{him that he was}} no longer welcome at his New York home. Booth also railed against Lincoln in conversations with his sister Asia, saying, [...] "That man's appearance, his pedigree, his coarse low jokes and anecdotes, his vulgar similes, and his policy are a disgrace to the seat he holds. He is made the tool of the North, to crush out slavery." [...] As the Confederacy's defeat became more certain in 1865, Booth decried the end of slavery and Lincoln's {{election}} to a second term, [...] "making himself a king", the actor fumed, in [...] "wild tirades", his sister recalled.|$|E
500|$|A dispute arose {{over who}} would be {{installed}} as judge and sheriff at the Colfax courthouse in Grant Parish. Kellogg's two appointees had seized control of the Court House on March 25 with aid and protection of black state militia troops. Then on April 13, White League forces attacked the courthouse and massacred 50 black militiamen who had been captured. A total of 105 blacks were killed trying to defend the Colfax courthouse for Governor Kellogg. On April 21, Grant sent in the U.S. 19th Infantry Regiment to restore order. On May 22, Grant issued a new proclamation to restore order in Louisiana. On May 31, McEnry <b>finally</b> <b>told</b> his followers to obey [...] "peremptory orders" [...] of the President. [...] The orders brought a brief peace to New Orleans and most of Louisiana, except, ironically, Grant Parish.|$|E
500|$|During {{the first}} part of the queue, guests viewed a sample repair and test shop. As guests entered the queue in the welcome center they were shown tests {{performed}} on cars and parts before being released. [...] The queue wound by different tests for tires and car doors, an anechoic chamber for radio receivers, and an area for crash test dummies to be tested. [...] At the end of the queue a group of guests would be brought into a briefing room where they were shown automobile testing facilities and examples of tests being performed. [...] The host, Bill McKim (John Michael Higgins) told the guests that they would take part in some of these tests and also told the technician Sherrie what tests to set up. [...] Small videos of each test were shown as he spoke. [...] He <b>finally</b> <b>told</b> her to choose one final [...] "surprise test," [...] and a video of a car crashing into a barrier was shown as a door opened for guests to enter the interior queue.|$|E

They stopped at several Carlton hotels in search of Cutmore and, <b>finally,</b> Taylor <b>told</b> the driver to take them to Barkly Street, Carlton.|$|R
5000|$|This {{story is}} {{described}} in Bhakti Ratnakara, by Narahari Cakravarti Thakur. Chaitanya das and his wife went to the Gambhira and there they met Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.

I {{want you to have}} a child and I want you to call that child Srinivas." ...|$|R
6000|$|There was {{something}} unusually {{still in the}} evening ... a stillness as of waiting. It set me thinking of the last time Mr. Lawrence had been ill ... nearly {{a year ago in}} August. One night during his convalescence I had watched by him to relieve the nurse. He had been sleepless and talkative, telling me many things about his life. <b>Finally</b> he <b>told</b> me of Margaret.|$|R
500|$|After {{staying with}} the show for eight seasons, Gray ran into trouble when she {{requested}} the producers of the show to adjust her contract {{to allow her to}} direct, as did the contracts of male co-stars Duffy and Hagman. The request initially led to producers' firing the actress from the serial, though the decision was later reversed when Dallas star Larry Hagman threatened to quit the show unless Gray were rehired. Gray stated in an interview with TV Guide, [...] "The producers said, 'But you're doing so well.' I thought, 'Oh, look out! I'm on the warpath now.' It was a struggle, though, because it was a man's show. And they fired me. When I <b>finally</b> <b>told</b> Larry, he went with me into the office and said, 'If she doesn't come back, I don't come back. I can't be playing J.R. Ewing without Sue Ellen.' He was very loyal and, honestly, a very smart businessman. He knew that truly, it was a huge relationship to the show." [...] We'll drink to that!" ...|$|E
500|$|On Saturday, August 5, {{with his}} {{patience}} exhausted, Hayes moved 5,000 army troops into the city. He {{announced that they}} would operate all idle PTC vehicles and ride as guards on active vehicles. He also made a plea to the strikers to support the war effort: [...] "We cannot kill any Germans or Japs with the troops who drive transit vehicles in Philadelphia". Later on August 5, Hayes issued an ultimatum to the strikers, which was posted at all carbarns. The PTC workers were given a deadline of 12:01a.m. on August 7 to resume their work. Those who refused would be fired and refused the WMC job availability certificates {{for the duration of}} the war; those between the ages of 18 and 37 would also lose their military draft deferments. The Justice Department obtained federal warrants for McMenamin, Carney and two other strike leaders; they were quickly arrested, and McMenamin <b>finally</b> <b>told</b> his followers to return to work on Monday, August 7, as the government demanded. However, he expressed no regret for his actions before and during the strike.|$|E
500|$|Marie became {{seriously ill}} on 15 November, and Alice {{was called to}} her bedside, {{but by the time}} she arrived, Marie had choked to death. A distraught Alice wrote to Queen Victoria that the [...] "pain is beyond words". Alice kept the news of Marie's death secret from her {{children}} for several weeks, but she <b>finally</b> <b>told</b> Ernest in early December. His reaction was even worse than she had anticipated; at first he refused to believe it. As he sat up crying, Alice broke her rule about physical contact with the ill and gave him a kiss. At first, however, Alice did not fall ill. She met her sister Victoria as the latter was passing through Darmstadt on the way to England, and wrote to her mother with [...] "a hint of resumed cheerfulness" [...] on the same day. However, by Saturday, 14 December, the anniversary of her father's death, she became seriously ill with the diphtheria caught from her son. Her last words were [...] "dear Papa", and she fell unconscious at 2:30am. Just after 8:30am, she died. Alice was buried on 18 December 1878 at the Grand Ducal mausoleum at Rosenhöhe outside Darmstadt, with the Union Flag draped over her coffin. A special monument of Alice and her daughter Marie was erected there by Joseph Boehm.|$|E
60|$|In {{this way}} almost {{everybody}} in Clavering {{came to know}} Ned Strong. He told Madame Fribsby, he told the landlord of the George, he told Baker at the reading-rooms, he told Mrs. Glanders, and the young ones, at dinner: and, <b>finally,</b> he <b>told</b> Mr. Arthur Pendennis, who, yawning into Clavering one day, found the Chevalier Strong in company with Captain Glanders; and who was delighted with his new acquaintance.|$|R
50|$|The losgann came to {{the door}} and told her to {{remember}} her pledge. First she put him behind the door, then under a bucket, then in a little bed by the fireplace, then a bed beside her own bed, but nothing stopped him. <b>Finally,</b> he <b>told</b> her to take down a rusty sword behind the bed and cut off his head. She did, and he became a handsome young prince, who married her.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Finally,</b> Odin/Gestumblindi <b>told</b> Heidrek {{the same}} riddle {{that he had}} once asked Vafthruthnir, i.e. [...] "What did Odin whisper in Balder's ear before Balder was cremated?" [...] Heidrek, {{realising}} that Gestumblindi was Odin, became very angry and wanted to strike Odin with his cursed sword Tyrfing. Odin turned into a hawk, but Heidrek's sword cut {{off a piece of}} the bird's tail, which is why the hawk has the tail he has.|$|R
500|$|In October 1562 the Queen {{fell ill}} with {{smallpox}} and, believing {{her life to}} be in danger, she asked the Privy Council to make Robert Dudley Protector of the Realm and {{to give him a}} suitable title together with twenty thousand pounds a year. There was universal relief when she recovered her health; Dudley was made a privy councillor. He was already deeply involved in foreign politics, including Scotland. In 1563 Elizabeth suggested Dudley as a consort to the widowed Mary, Queen of Scots, the idea being to achieve firm amity between England and Scotland and diminish the influence of foreign powers. Elizabeth's preferred solution was that they should all live together at the English court, so that she would not have to forgo her favourite's company. Mary of Scotland at first enquired if Elizabeth was serious, wanting above all to know her chances of inheriting the English crown. Elizabeth repeatedly declared that she was only prepared to acknowledge Mary as her heir on condition that she marry Robert Dudley. Mary's Protestant advisors warmed to the prospect of having Dudley as their prince, and in September 1564 he was created Earl of Leicester, a move designed to make him more acceptable to Mary. In January 1565 Thomas Randolph, the English ambassador to Scotland, was told by the Scottish queen that she would accept the proposal. To his amazement, Dudley was not to be moved to comply: But a man of that nature I never found any ... he whom I go about to make as happy as ever was any, to put him in possession of a kingdom, to lay in his naked arms a most fair ... lady ... nothing regardeth the good that shall ensue unto him thereby ... but so uncertainly dealeth that I know not where to find him. Dudley indeed had made it clear to the Scots at the beginning that he was not a candidate for Mary's hand and forthwith had behaved with passive resistance. He also worked in the interest of Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, Mary's eventual choice of husband. Elizabeth herself wavered as to declaring Mary her heir, until in March 1565 she decided she could not bring herself to it. Still, she <b>finally</b> <b>told</b> the Spanish ambassador that the proposal fell through because the Earl of Leicester refused to cooperate.|$|E
2500|$|Oliver had <b>finally</b> <b>told</b> {{her that}} he wasn't a real count, but she didn't care (it was clear she never cared about him) and thusly didn't believe her husband's words, believing {{that he had been}} called [...] "Count" [...] in Paris, that MADE him the Count, as far as she was concerned.|$|E
2500|$|... {{the boys}} who had the money won it in a fair game and they should keep it. He also {{said he had a}} hundred men who would stand behind him and see that they were protected. The judge <b>finally</b> <b>told</b> him he [...] could not afford to stand up for a gang of thieves, but he [...] almost screamed—“Well, Judge, declare me in with the thieves. I’ll stay with them,” and with that he passionately beat the table with his fist and left the room.|$|E
6000|$|But {{in spite}} of all his friends, Unc' Billy was lonesome. The longer he stayed, the more lonesome he grew, Unc' Billy wanted his family, whom he had left way down in [...] "Ol' Virginny." [...] <b>Finally</b> he <b>told</b> Jimmy Skunk all about it, and for once Unc' Billy had {{forgotten}} how to grin. Yes, Sir, Unc' Billy had forgotten how to grin. Instead he just wept, wept great big tears of lonesomeness.|$|R
50|$|Her {{children}} sought everywhere {{for medical}} help until <b>finally</b> they were <b>told</b> {{that the only}} cure was to cauterize her head. This was done. The treatment, with a red hot iron, was more terrible than all the headaches she suffered.|$|R
2500|$|Lawrence {{offered a}} variety of {{explanations}} for the shooting. He blamed Jackson {{for the loss of}} his job. He claimed that with the President dead, [...] "money would be more plenty," [...] (a reference to Jackson's struggle with the Bank of the United States) and that he [...] "could not rise until the President fell." [...] <b>Finally,</b> Lawrence <b>told</b> his interrogators that he was a deposed English king—specifically, Richard III, dead since 1485—and that Jackson was his clerk. He was deemed insane and was institutionalized.|$|R
