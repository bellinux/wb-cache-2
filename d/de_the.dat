Myles Standish had used data from Voyager 2s 1989 flyby of Neptune, which had revised the planet's total mass {{downward}} by 0.5%—an amount {{comparable to the}} mass of Mars—to recalculate its gravitational effect on Uranus. When Neptune's newly determined mass {{was used in the}} Jet Propulsion Laboratory Developmental Ephemeris (JPL <b>DE),</b> <b>the</b> supposed discrepancies in the Uranian orbit, and with them the need for a PlanetX, vanished. There are no discrepancies in the trajectories of any space probes such as Pioneer 10, Pioneer 11, Voyager 1, and Voyager 2 that {{can be attributed to the}} gravitational pull of a large undiscovered object in the outer Solar System. Today, most astronomers agree that PlanetX, as Lowell defined it, does not exist.|$|E

Prior to the battle, Pang De volunteered to lead the vanguard of a reinforcement army to relief Cao Ren's forces, who were besieged in Fan by Guan Yu's army. Cao Cao was delighted and he granted Pang <b>De</b> <b>the</b> post. However, when others advised Cao Cao against granting Pang De command of the vanguard due to Pang's past associations with Ma Chao (who {{had become one of}} the Five Tiger Generals under Liu Bei), Pang knelt down in front of Cao and kowtowed until his face was covered in blood. Cao Cao was moved by Pang De's sincerity and he no longer doubted Pang's allegiance towards him, so he appointed Pang as the vanguard. Pang De later ordered a wooden coffin to be built and he told his men to place Guan Yu's body inside if he succeeded in killing Guan, or place his body inside if he died in battle.|$|E
