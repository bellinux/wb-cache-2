Results are presented to show that with randomized texts there is a close approximation to the Miller-Madow prediction of sample bias. Three samples of English of varying complexity show slightly more <b>information</b> <b>per</b> single letter and much more information in an average letter for the more difficult material. Conversely, samples from Samoan, English, and Russian show some constancy in the average <b>information</b> <b>per</b> letter in spite of wide differences in size of their alphabets. Thus, greater redundancy is correlated with a larger alphabet...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a multilingual study {{on how much}} information is contained in a single post of microblog text from Twitter in 26 different languages. In order {{to answer this question}} in a quantitative fashion, we take an information-theoretic approach, using entropy as our criterion for quantifying “how much is said ” in a tweet. Our results find that, as expected, languages with larger character sets such as Chinese and Japanese contain more <b>information</b> <b>per</b> character than other languages. However, we also find that, somewhat surprisingly, in-formation per character does not have a strong corre-lation with <b>information</b> <b>per</b> microblog post, as authors of microblog posts in languages with more <b>information</b> <b>per</b> character do not necessarily use all of the space al-lotted to them. Finally, we examine the relative impor-tance of a number of factors that contribute to whether a language has more or less information content in each character or post, and also compare the information con-tent of microblog text with more traditional text from Wikipedia...|$|R

50|$|MLC NAND flash is a {{flash memory}} {{technology}} using multiple levels per cell to allow more bits to be stored using {{the same number of}} transistors. In SLC NAND flash technology, each cell can exist in one of two states, storing one bit of <b>information</b> <b>per</b> cell. Most MLC NAND flash memory has four possible states per cell, so it can store two bits of <b>information</b> <b>per</b> cell. This reduces the amount of margin separating the states and results in the possibility of more errors. Multi-level cells which are designed for low error rates are sometimes called enterprise MLC (eMLC).|$|R
5000|$|In every given moment, {{there is}} a great deal of {{information}} made available to each individual. Psychologists have found that one's mind can attend to only a certain amount of information at a time. According to Csikszentmihályi's 2004 TED talk, that number is about [...] "110 bits of <b>information</b> <b>per</b> second". That may seem like a lot of information, but simple daily tasks take quite a lot of information. Just decoding speech takes about 60 bits of <b>information</b> <b>per</b> second. That is why when having a conversation one cannot focus as much attention on other things.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} the areas {{which must be}} considered in weighing {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} chord keyboard devices with respect to one-key-at-a-time devices such as the standard typewriter. These areas include: <b>information</b> <b>per</b> stroke, stroke rate, motor djiculty of chord strokes, motor learning for chord k y n g, memorixation of code, characteristics of use and users of the device in terms of skillleveland trainability, schemes for encoding the material to be transcribed so as to achieve more <b>information</b> <b>per</b> stroke, and detremental effects of requiring unfamiliar sequences of keying responses. A particular compromise chord keying system called Rapid-Type is described. The results of a feasibility demonstration of it are reviewed and certain details of coding d@cuZties are discussed. Finalb, some indirect evidence is presented for supporting the statement that the <b>information</b> <b>per</b> stroke has little, or no, effect on keying rate. A chord stroke on a keyboard is defined as a stroke involving the “ simultaneous ” activation of more than one key. In general, though no...|$|R

30|$|The {{manner in}} which Representamen is adopted in IG aligns with how Nöth’s (2014) {{description}} of the linguistic sign type rheme, Peirce’s semiotic concept of a logical predicate. As Nöth explains a singular rheme cannot convey any particular <b>information</b> <b>per</b> se, unless it is brought into relationship with other things (2014, 16). A single (linguistic) noun, {{as one of a}} list of individual elements, does not convey any particular <b>information</b> <b>per</b> se (a man or a pen could be any man or any pen in any possible world). That is why Representamen, as they come into an interpreter’s interpretation, suppose a rhematic syntax: this means that the elements in the video are simply listed.|$|R
