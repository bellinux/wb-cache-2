5|$|The {{longfin mako}} has large eyes and is {{attracted}} to cyalume sticks (chemical lights), implying {{that it is}} a visual hunter. Its diet consists mainly of small, schooling bony fishes and squids. In October 1972, a 3.4-m-long female with the broken bill from a swordfish (Xiphius gladias) lodged in her abdomen was caught in the northeastern Indian Ocean; whether the shark was preying on swordfish as the shortfin mako <b>does,</b> <b>or</b> encountered the swordfish in some other aggressive context is not known. Adult longfin makos have no natural predators except for killer whales, while young individuals may fall prey to larger sharks.|$|E
5|$|Others have redefined this concept, {{making it}} {{compatible}} with forming a belief, and only incompatible with absolute certainty. George H. Smith, while admitting that the narrow definition of atheist was the common usage definition of that word, and admitting that the broad definition of agnostic was the common usage definition of that word, promoted broadening {{the definition of}} atheist and narrowing the definition of agnostic. Smith rejects agnosticism as a third alternative to theism and atheism and promotes terms such as agnostic atheism (the view {{of those who do}} not believe in the existence of any deity, but do not claim to know if a deity <b>does</b> <b>or</b> does not exist) and agnostic theism (the view of those who do not claim to know of the existence of any deity, but still believe in such an existence).|$|E
5|$|Karl Marx {{distinguished}} {{social classes}} by their {{connection to the}} means of production in the capitalist system: the bourgeoisie own the means, but this effectively includes the proletariat itself as the workers can only sell their own labour power (forming the material base of the cultural superstructure). Max Weber critiqued Marxist economic determinism, arguing that social stratification is not based purely on economic inequalities, but on other status and power differentials (e.g. patriarchy). According to Weber, stratification may occur among at least three complex variables: (1) Property (class): A person's economic position in a society, based on birth and individual achievement. Weber differs from Marx in that he does not see this as the supreme factor in stratification. Weber noted how managers of corporations or industries control firms they do not own; Marx would have placed such a person in the proletariat. (2) Prestige (status): A person's prestige, or popularity in a society. This could be determined by the kind of job this person <b>does</b> <b>or</b> wealth. and (3) Power (political party): A person's ability to get their way despite the resistance of others. For example, individuals in state jobs, such as an employee of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, or a member of the United States Congress, may hold little property or status but they still hold immense power Pierre Bourdieu provides a modern example in the concepts of cultural and symbolic capital. Theorists such as Ralf Dahrendorf have noted the tendency towards an enlarged middle-class in modern Western societies, particularly in relation to the necessity of an educated work force in technological or service-based economies. Perspectives concerning globalization, such as dependency theory, suggest this effect owes to the shift of workers to the developing countries.|$|E

25|$|The first {{concerns}} traditional grammar, {{which tends}} to view a predicate as one of two main parts of a sentence, the other part being the subject; {{the purpose of the}} predicate is to complete an idea about the subject, such as what it <b>does</b> <b>or</b> what it is like.|$|E

When we combine these processes, we can determine that M <b>does,</b> <b>or</b> does not, go on printing 1’s and 0’s ad infinitum. Thus we have a method for determining if M is circle-free. By Proof 1 this is impossible. So the first assertion that E exists, is wrong: E does not exist.|$|E
25|$|Before {{determining}} which federal programs to examine, the auditor must first study the recipient itself.

25|$|Typical {{algorithms}} {{that are}} exact and yet run in sub-linear time use parallel processing (as the NC1 matrix determinant calculation does), non-classical processing (as Grover's search <b>does),</b> <b>or</b> alternatively have guaranteed assumptions on the input structure (as the logarithmic time binary search and many tree maintenance algorithms do).

Though the two are described as being entirely independent, the Mutants & Masterminds manual recommends that the Power Level be increased by one with each 15 Power Points awarded.|$|E

25|$|Players are not {{permitted}} to carry the ring over the two blue lines; they can advance the ring over the line only by passing it to another player. The ring must be touched by any other player first, but {{does not need to be}} under control before the passer take possession again (e.g., the passer bounces the ring off a player's skate and then picks it up). If a player touches the ring consecutively on both sides of the blue line their team loses possession and the opposing team is given a free pass.

25|$|The {{extent to}} which the Common Heritage of Mankind {{principle}} <b>does</b> <b>or</b> should control the activities of private multinational corporations as well as nation states, particularly with regard to mining activities, remains controversial. underdeveloped nations often see the principle as a means of protecting critical resources from exploitation by capitalist nations and their corporations. As world oil, coal and mineral reserves are depleted there will be increasing pressure to commercially exploit Common Heritage of Mankind areas. It appears at the present time that exploration of outer space is unlikely to initially proceed under the jurisdiction of a supranational organization, but rather through the coordination of national space programs. It has been argued that photosynthesis in its natural or artificial forms should be considered the common heritage of humanity.|$|E

25|$|Feeling of Knowing (FOK) {{judgments}} {{refer to}} the predictions {{of being able to}} retrieve specific information an individual makes, regarding his or her knowledge for a specific subject, more specifically whether that knowledge exists within memory. These judgments are made either prior to the memory target being found or following a failed attempt to locate the target. Consequently, FOK judgments focus not on the actual answer to a question, but rather on whether an individual predicts that he or she <b>does</b> <b>or</b> does not know the answer (high and low FOK ratings respectively). FOK judgments can also be made regarding the likelihood of remembering information later on and have proven to give fairly accurate indications of future memory. An example of FOK is if you can't remember the answer when someone asks you what city you're traveling to, but you feel that you would recognize the name if you saw it on a map of the country.|$|E

500|$|In any graph, {{directed}} or undirected, {{there is}} a straightforward algorithm for finding a widest path once the weight of its minimum-weight edge is known: simply delete all smaller edges and search for any path among the remaining edges using breadth first search or depth first search. Based on this test, there also exists a linear time algorithm for finding a widest [...] path in an undirected graph, that does not use the maximum spanning tree. The main idea of the algorithm is to apply the linear-time path-finding algorithm to the median edge weight in the graph, and then either to delete all smaller edges or contract all larger edges according to whether a path <b>does</b> <b>or</b> does not exist, and recurse in the resulting smaller graph.|$|E
500|$|Each {{character}} has unique [...] "universal techniques"—special attacks {{that are more}} powerful than normal moves—that require complex control inputs.

Certain universal techniques are usable by all characters; for example, each character possesses one that launches opponents upward, rendering them vulnerable to an [...] "air combo". Other common universal techniques include the [...] "Baroque Combo", which sacrifices the regenerable portion of a character's life gauge, but allows players to extend combos and deal more damage; and the [...] "Mega Crash", which creates a temporary barrier around the character to knock back opponents, but partially drains their Hyper Combo and life gauges.|$|E

[...] Todd Gilchrist of IGN Entertainment expressed hope in the further development of the series, noting the complex backgrounds of each character as being the series' focal point. He noted that the ensemble, composed of [...] "countless comely females and enough strong, competitive males" [...] remains outstanding in prime time, being iconic, due to the vast interpretations regarding the main cast. Whereas Gilchrist acknowledged that the show gives the impression of it being only for women, he stated that he can attest to its universal, equal-opportunity appeal, assessing that the show [...] "explores the medical world with both a sense of testosterone-fueled intensity and estrogen-laced sensitivity" [...] and deserved to have viewers from both genders, championing its merits. In response to the bomb story arc, he called the two episodes [...] "juicy", while assessing that they [...] "followed a story line that not only explained the series up to that point, but featured all of the characters in their more or less purest from". Gilchrist provided an outlook on each character, describing Grey as a [...] "prodigiously talented but insecure surgeon, waylaid by her love for attending Derek Shepherd", while stating that Yang, [...] "an aggressively ambitious intern" [...] lacks knowledge on any topic, except medicine, comparing her to boyfriend Burke, described as her opposite. In response to George O'Malley's story line, he noted how his sensitive personality constantly results in difficulty in his path to becoming a proper surgeon. He also expressed excitement in the doors opened by the previous season's cliffhanger, seeing the arrival of Montgomery (Walsh) as [...] "certainly speaking to the show's focus on relationships over {{the nuts and bolts of}} being a surgeon", while praising Rhimes for continuing to [...] "merge those disparate elements in the way that <b>does,</b> <b>or</b> at least should be a source of enthusiasm for both men and women, creating an atmosphere both professional and intimately personal, often at the same time".|$|E
