500|$|In May 1977 Genesis {{released}} Spot the Pigeon, {{an extended}} play of three tracks left off Wind & Wuthering. It peaked at No. 14 on the UK singles chart. It {{was the final}} Genesis release before Hackett left the group. He had been writing more material {{on his own and}} found it increasingly difficult to contribute more of his ideas within a group context. He wished to embark on a solo career and [...] "take the risk in order to <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>just</b> how good I was on my own".

It reached No. 4 in the UK and No. 47 in the US.|$|E
2500|$|No {{knowledge}} of electronics {{was needed to}} assemble a Heathkit. The assembly process did not teach much about electronics, but provided {{a great deal of}} what could have been called [...] "electronics literacy," [...] such as the ability to identify tube pin numbers or read a resistor color code. [...] Many hobbyists began by assembling Heathkits, became familiar with the appearance of components like capacitors, transformers, resistors, and tubes, and were motivated to <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>just</b> what these components actually did. For those builders who had a deeper {{knowledge of}} electronics (or for those who {{wanted to be able to}} troubleshoot/repair the product in the future), the assembly manuals usually included a detailed [...] "Theory of Operation" [...] chapter, which explained the functioning of the kit's circuitry, section by section. Heath developed a relationship with electronics correspondence schools (e.g., NRI). Heath supplied electronic kits to be assembled as part of courses, with the school basing its texts and lessons around the kit.|$|E

40|$|The {{intention}} of this master thesis {{is dealing with}} homiletical hermeneutics by Augustin and Comenius. The thesis introduces their main works and the subject. First it explains concept of homiletical hermeneutics, then the theoretical background of both authors and method of their biblical interpretation. As far as possible the thesis compares works. Augustin ́s influence on Comenius is intermediated by humanistical scholars, {{that is why the}} thesis <b>finds</b> <b>out</b> <b>just</b> a trace not the direct reference to the influence. Augustin ́s main interpretation criterion is love, therefore all interpretations and readings have to refer to it. Comenius ́ method is based on close reading of the text and on respect to hearer.
