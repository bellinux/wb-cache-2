500|$|... "Hung Up" [...] {{was ranked}} at number 76 on Rolling Stones [...] "100 Best Songs of the 2000s" [...] decade-end list, calling it [...] "One of her [...] most {{captivating}} hits ever — {{and thanks to}} those deceptively hard-hitting lyrics, {{one of her most}} personal."

60|$|The {{old man of}} Torn fairly trembled with {{suppressed}} rage as {{the full}} purport of this letter flashed upon him. It <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>years</b> <b>since</b> he had heard aught {{of the search for}} the little lost prince of England, and now that the period of his silence was drawing to a close, now that more and more often opportunities were opening up to him to wreak the last shred of his terrible vengeance, the very thought of being thwarted at the final moment staggered his comprehension.|$|E

6000|$|She was {{as ready}} as I {{was to take}} her, and {{promptly}} on the minute we sent up our names and took seats in the Ladies' Parlor. It <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>years</b> <b>since</b> I had entered the Palmer House, and as we waited we compared memories of its old-time splendor. [...] "My father still regards it as the grandest hotel in the West, and {{it is probable that}} Mr. Howells knew of no other. So far as I know he has never been in Chicago before, unless possibly for a few days during the World's Fair." ...|$|E
60|$|It <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>years</b> <b>since</b> the poor, lonely {{woman had}} felt such warmth of love. Her sons {{had been like}} her husband, chary of expressing their affection; and like most Puritan families, there was little of caressing among them. Sitting there with the rain {{on the roof and}} driving through the trees, they planned getting back into the old house. Howard's plan seemed to her full of splendor and audacity. She began to {{understand}} his power and wealth now, as he put it into concrete form before her.|$|E
60|$|They now {{separated}} {{to prepare}} for the sad ceremony; for whenever an appeal is made to law sorrow is almost certain to follow--even in a fairyland like Oz. But is must be stated that the people of that Land were generally so well-behaved that {{there was not a single}} lawyer amongst them, and it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>years</b> <b>since</b> any Ruler had sat in judgment upon an offender of the law. The crime of murder being the most dreadful crime of all, tremendous excitement prevailed in the Emerald City when the news of Eureka's arrest and trial became known.|$|E

50|$|Prince Bhisadej's {{favourite}} {{sports in}} Chiang Mai {{used to be}} windsurfing and horse riding, but it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>years</b> <b>since</b> he <b>has</b> practiced these. He fell from horseback three times and he broke three ribs during one of those falls. Nowadays, his exercises mostly relate to walking while inspecting his numerous agricultural centers on the highlands.|$|R
6000|$|The Queen {{was silent}} for a time, and {{appeared}} to be thinking without her machine, which made the girl anxious.

60|$|Thus he {{came upon}} the trail of The Sheik's band as it {{traveled}} down river from the point where The Sheik had captured Meriem to his own stockaded village. Korak pretty well knew who it was that had passed, for there were few in the great jungle with whom he was not familiar, though it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>years</b> <b>since</b> he had come this far north. He had no particular business, however, with the old Sheik {{and so he did}} not propose following him--the further from men he could stay the better pleased he would be--he wished that he might never see a human face again. Men always brought him sorrow and misery.|$|E
6000|$|By and by {{she fell}} asleep, only to dream that the package was a caressing hand {{stealing}} about her, feeling for hers, and holding it with soft, strong clasp. When she awoke {{she had the}} strangest sensation in her right palm. It was moist, throbbing, hot, and the feel of it on her cheek was strangely thrilling and comforting. She lay awake then. The night was dark and still. Only a low moan of wind in the pines and the faint tinkle of a sheep bell broke the serenity. She felt very small and lonely lying there in the deep forest, and, try how she would, {{it was impossible to}} think the same then as she did in the clear light of day. Resentment, pride, anger--these seemed abated now. If {{the events of the day}} had not changed her, they had at least brought up softer and kinder memories and emotions than she had known for long. Nothing hurt and saddened her so much as to remember the gay, happy days of her childhood, her sweet mother, her, old home. Then her thought returned to Isbel and his gift. It <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>years</b> <b>since</b> anyone had made her a gift. What could this one be? It did not matter. The wonder was that Jean Isbel should bring it to her and that she could be perturbed by its presence. [...] "He meant it for his sister and so he thought well of me," [...] she said, in finality.|$|E

25|$|When Superintendent Spence arrives to see Poirot, {{the detective}} reacts {{to him as}} though it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> many <b>years</b> <b>since</b> the case on which they worked. The case in {{question}} was, however, the one retold in Taken at the Flood, which is the previous novel in the series, and was explicitly set in 1946. At most, it can only <b>have</b> <b>been</b> six <b>years</b> <b>since</b> they last worked together. Of course, chronologies are difficult to construct, especially with Poirot's career.|$|R
50|$|While there, {{the prince}} bought a nightingale, {{and found it}} could talk. It {{asked him why he}} was so sad, and when he told the bird his story, she told him to go, and when the princess would not speak, he must tell her he would instead {{converse}} with the candlestick, where the nightingale would be hidden. The prince obeyed. The princess would not speak to him, so he spoke to the candlestick, and the nightingale said it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>years</b> <b>since</b> anyone had spoken to her, so she would tell him a story.|$|E

I do like cover songs, and Disney movies, but it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>years</b> <b>since</b> I enjoyed {{anything}} Stellar Kart had done. A Whole New World exceeded my expectations, and it's a very enjoyable EP. Obviously, you'll {{get the most out of}} it if you're a fellow Disney fan and if you've grown up watching these four movies. But even if you've never seen a Disney movie, you can probably get something out of this as well." ...|$|E
