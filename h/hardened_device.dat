40|$|The {{vertical}} {{metal oxide}} semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) is a widely used power transistor onboard a spacecraft. The MOSFET is typically employed in power supplies and high current switching applications. Due to the inherent high electric fields in the device, power MOSFETs are sensitive to heavy ion irradiation and can fail catastrophically {{as a result of}} single event gate rupture (SEGR) or single event burnout (SEB). Manufacturers have designed radiation-hardened power MOSFETs for space applications. These radiation <b>hardened</b> <b>devices</b> are not immune to SEGR or SEB but, rather, can exhibit them at a much more damaging ion than their non-radiation hardened counterparts.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis {{research is part}} of a continued effort to simulate the effects of total dose radiation on the performance of single and composite operational amplifiers using PSPICE. This research provides further verification that the composite operational amplifier has a superior performance to the single operational amplifier while operating in a radiation flux. In this experiment, a single and composite op amp were constructed in PSPICE and implemented in a finite gain amplifier circuit. The effects of ionizing radiation were simulated by varying the parameters of the components that made up the op amps. These component parameters were varied in ways that would mimic the response of the actual components that were irradiated in previous research. The simulations were incrementally run to simulate an increasing radiation dose. The results of these simulations were then compared with the results of an actual study conducted at Naval Postgraduate School where similar circuits were irradiated using the school's LINAC. This procedure proved to be an improved method for predicting the effects of total dose radiation for radiation <b>hardened</b> <b>devices</b> and provided additional confirmation of the superior performance of the composite op amp over the single op amp.

As an example, one can cite the broad and powerful supercontinuum sources used for fluorescence imaging, flow cytometry or characterization of optical components. Another interest of these PCFs lies {{in the possibility of}} using only pure silica glasses to design the fibers.

40|$|Efficacy of {{existing}} on-board propulsion systems health management systems (HMS) are severely impacted by computational limitations (e. g., low sampling rates); paradigmatic limitations (e. g., low-fidelity logic/parameter redlining only, false alarms due to noisy/corrupted sensor signatures, preprogrammed diagnostics only); and telemetry bandwidth limitations on space/ground interactions. Ultra-compact/light, adaptive neural networks with massively parallel, asynchronous, fast reconfigurable and fault-tolerant information processing properties have already demonstrated significant potential for inflight diagnostic analyses and resource allocation with reduced ground dependence. In particular, they can automatically exploit correlation effects across multiple sensor streams (plume analyzer, flow meters, vibration detectors, etc.) {{so as to}} detect anomaly signatures that cannot be determined from the exploitation of single sensor. Furthermore, neural networks have already demonstrated the potential for impacting real-time fault recovery in vehicle subsystems by adaptively regulating combustion mixture/power subsystems and optimizing resource utilization under degraded conditions.

40|$|Terminal groin usage in North Carolina is a {{contentious}} issue amongst coastal managers, homeowners, and policymakers. My {{research shows that}} this issue consists of a mixture of cultural, political, economic, and historical factors that all impact opinions {{on whether or not}} terminal groins should be implemented. A stakeholder analysis was performed asking questions that focused on gauging coastal residents’ knowledge of terminal groins’ function and structure, their potential impacts, and residents were asked which direction they wanted to see North Carolina move, hardening methods or other methods. North Carolina’s historical stance prevented the use of any shoreline <b>hardening</b> <b>devices,</b> such as terminal groins. However, a policy shift in 2011 allowed for four pilot sites along the North Carolina coast. With the potential for terminal groin usage expanding and a potential policy shift in coastal management on the horizon, it is important to find out what coastal residents think about terminal groins. The use of terminal groins has the potential to affect coastal residents in many ways including economically, socially, and environmentally. A quick synopsis of my conclusions are included here: Coastal residents are more aware of the topic then expected but they are split on their effectiveness, split on whether or not they want to move towards using terminal groins, and have mixed opinions on their impacts. Policymakers are equally split and express frustration regarding how the topic is discussed and perceived. There is no consistent reason for terminal groin usage as that differs by region and the rational for interviewee stances depends on whether or not they view the beach as natural. Areas of agreement amongst both homeowner and policymaker interviewees include the need for site specific usage if terminal groins are used, a need for comprehensive scientific study before they are considered, and the desire to not see them used willy-nilly...|$|R
