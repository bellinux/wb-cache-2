25|$|Passed {{out to the}} {{occasional}} friend and published in a few small Cuban publications, Che's image remained relatively unknown for 7 years. A print was sold or given to wealthy Italian publisher and intellectual Giangiacomo Feltrinelli in 1967. Feltrinelli {{had just returned from}} Bolivia where he had hoped his fame would help in negotiating the release of French journalist and professor Régis <b>Debray.</b> <b>Debray</b> had been arrested in Bolivia in connection with guerrilla operations led by Che Guevara. As Guevara's eventual capture or death appeared to be imminent with the CIA closing in on his whereabouts, Feltrinelli acquired the rights to publish Che's captured Bolivian Diary. At this time Feltrinelli asked Cuban officials where to obtain Guevara images and was directed to Korda's studio where he presented a letter of introduction from the government. The document asked for Korda's assistance in finding a good portrait of Che. Korda knew right away that his favorite image of Che was perfect and pointed to the 1960 shot of Che hanging on the wall, saying that the photograph was the best of those he had taken of Che. Feltrinelli agreed and ordered 2 prints. When he returned the next day to pick them up Korda told him that because he was a friend of the revolution {{he did not have to}} pay.|$|E

In addition to publishing winners of the literary contest, Casa also published book length material deemed important enough for widespread distribution. Perhaps the most important and influential piece published was Regis <b>Debray’s</b> Revolution within the Revolution? in 1967. This book meant to complement Che Guevara’s Bolivian uprising.|$|R

25|$|All {{four of the}} {{defendants}} charged with arson and endangering human life were convicted, {{for which they were}} sentenced to three years in prison. In June 1969, however, they were temporarily paroled under an amnesty for political prisoners, but in November of that year, the Federal Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) demanded that they return to custody. Only Horst Söhnlein complied with the order; the rest went underground and made their way to France, where they stayed for a time in a house owned by prominent French journalist and revolutionary, Régis <b>Debray,</b> famous for his friendship with Che Guevara and the focus theory of guerrilla warfare. Eventually they made their way to Italy, where the lawyer Mahler visited them and encouraged them to return to Germany with him to form an underground guerrilla group.|$|E
25|$|Because of this, {{even though}} Jazani never stroked out nonviolent struggle, {{but in the}} current {{circumstance}} {{came to the conclusion}} that open political activity is inconceivable. The government has left no possibility for this kind of activity; therefore the only method of struggle is guerrilla warfare. In the selection of this tactic Jazani and the members of the group were effected by the guerrilla warfare of South America and Vietnam and the works of Che Guevara, Fidel Castro, and Régis <b>Debray</b> were their main teachers. It should be noted that it was only Jazani and Zia-Zarifi that worked on the ideology of the group. The reaction towards secret activities and book reading resulted in the unimportance of theory in the group. Some of the members of the group were disgusted of any kind of research and made joke of it. From early 1957, the group acted to address this problem but its effects on the group remained. The change of the stance of the group resulted in the decrease of the importance of struggle in the mountains and between the villagers and increase in the importance of the struggle in the cities and the group prepared its activities according to that. But this change of tactics led to problems in the center of the group. Manoochehr Kallantari that he does not believe in the ideology of the group and Shahrzad believed that the group could not make it work. Even though after discussions they changed their positions and accepted the decision of the center of the group but in reality they were sidelined from the group's activities. Kallantari was sent to London and Shahrzad was transferred to the reserve force and in October 1967 because of disagreement with the method of stealing from the bank, after the ruling from the center of the group he was let off from the organization.|$|E

They required burning more than 300liters of pure [...] and [...] gas for each kilogram of iridium.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We suggest that, as an {{extension}} to traditional historical analysis, it is potentially insightful and useful to model guerrilla wars in agent-based terms. Accordingly, the Iruba agent-based model of a guerrilla war has been designed and implemented. Some experimental results obtained with the model and conclusions that may be drawn from them are reported, particularly in relation to Guevara and <b>Debray’s</b> theory of “foco ” and {{to a set of}} sufficient conditions for insurgent success asserted by T. E. Lawrence. Then the limitations of the Iruba and similar models are considered and the need for and possibility of direct analysis of an agent-based computational model discussed...|$|R
40|$|Transmission {{functions}} as a key image of communication in media, communications, and cultural study. At times, largely linked to the mathematical theory of communication, it has played a foundational role in defining this field, {{and the study of}} the process of communication. At other times it has become a key object of critique. A conventional argument is that transmission represents a simplistic, inadequate and inferior model of communication. But this does not explain how, for some critics, transmission can be activated as an enabling, productive term. This essay explores aspects of the critique of the so-called transmission model of communication. But it is also interested in what authors do with the concept. It looks at how Wilbur Schramm and Stuart Hall engage with ideas of transmission, and then explores how transmission is deployed in parts of Régis <b>Debray’s</b> work...|$|R
5000|$|International {{politics}} - A {{majority in}} France approved of President Jacques Chirac's {{opposition to the}} 2003 invasion of Iraq by the United States. Sarkozy is considered as pro-Washington, while Royal, although seen as probably also in line with Washington, {{is thought to be}} more moderate. Left-wing intellectual Régis <b>Debray's</b> metaphor was that Sarkozy was like a direct flight to Washington, D.C., while Royal was a flight to Washington with a stop-off in Oslo, referring to her European inclinations. Chirac's public opposition to the Iraq War should however be relativised, as he toned down his criticisms after a while. Furthermore, he has involved French troops in Afghanistan and agreed, immediately after the 11 September 2001 attacks, on increased cooperation between Western intelligence services, materialised by the creation of Alliance Base in the centre of Paris, a joint international Counterterrorist Intelligence Centre.|$|R
500|$|By Day 113, some of {{the guerrillas}} have deserted, and, upon capture, have led the Bolivian Army to the revolutionaries' base camp, which {{contained}} vast stockpiles of food, much-needed supplies, and intelligence identifying much of the group as Cubans. Much to Che's disappointment Tamara [...] "Tania" [...] Bunke, Guevara's revolutionary contact has botched elaborate preparations and given away their identity. On Day 141, the guerrillas capture Bolivian soldiers that refuse to join the revolution and are free {{to return to their}} villages. CIA and US Army Special Forces advisers arrive to supervise anti-insurgent activity and to train the Bolivian Army. On Day 169, Guevara's visiting friend, the French intellectual Régis <b>Debray,</b> is captured at Muyupampa by the Bolivian Army along with two of Che's last contacts with the outside world. A Bolivian airstrike then occurs against Che's guerrillas on Day 219, driving them deeper into hiding. By this time, Che has split his forces; his best fighters travel with him in one column, while another column contains other personnel, including Tania, and carries much of the remaining supplies.|$|E

40|$|The article explores two {{poems by}} Hart Crane, “Interludium” and “To the Empress Josephine’s Statue,” {{both of which}} are {{examples}} of ekphrasis. Inspired by two sculptures of women, Gaston Lachaise’s La Montagne and Vital <b>Debray’s</b> statue of Joséphine de Beauharnais, the poems in question are at once representations of works of art and of femininity. It is as such that they are scrutinized in an analysis which focuses on poetry, the visual arts and femininity. The article deals with Crane’s use of ekphrasis as a genre, but also with his reflections on time and space, the domains of poetry and sculpture respectively. It also delves into a number of connections evidenced in “Interludium” and “To the Empress Josephine’s Statue”: the one between creation and procreation, understood as maternity, and thus between art and femininity, as well as the ones between femininity on the one hand, and nature, mysticism, morality and history on the other.

40|$|In 1985, Marcel Gauchet {{wrote of}} the ‘retour du religieux’ as {{an end to the}} social role of {{religion}} and the beginning of its privatisation. However, far from an indication of the withering of religion on the vine of modernity, the return of a religious discourse was resurrected by the democratisation of the ‘croyant’ in the mid- 1980 s. The ‘âge égalitaire’, coupled with the specificity of the ‘croyant’, created a platform on which to challenge the model of laïcité in contemporary France. This discourse sought to re-appropriate reason from the logic of secular objectivity and postmodern self-reliance, and re-signify it within a Catholic theological language of belief and faith. The transmission of religious ‘knowledge’ would also be seen to compete for intellectual equality with the forms and transmission of knowledge approved by laïcité in the republican school. Régis <b>Debray's</b> report to the Ministry of Education in 2002 on the teaching of the ‘fait religieux’ in French schools advances this debate by defending the introduction of the study of religion in school from the perspectives of theological rigour, the indivisibility of knowledge (the coexistence of ‘témoin’ and ‘savant’), and the inextricable links between faith and reason in their production of knowledge with a valid claim for public consumption...|$|R
5000|$|Patterned {{after the}} Freedom Summer {{campaign}} of 1964, [...] "Vietnam Summer" [...] was a nationwide student anti-war campaign to raise off-campus consciousness about current events in Vietnam. SDS activists around Columbia set up tables {{on the sidewalks}} and canvassed Upper West Side apartment buildings. In late July 1967, Gold and other Columbia SDS steering committee people started {{to meet in the}} high-rise apartment on LaSalle Street of the two Columbia SDS activists who were already married, Peter and Linda Schneider, a few blocks from Columbia's campus. Meetings were held in the evening during the week, on a weekly or bi-weekly basis. Political strategy for the coming 67-68 school year was discussed. At one of the meetings, two Princeton University SDS activists also participated in the strategic discussion, talking about common experiences in attempting to mobilize students in opposition to both Princeton and Columbia's Institute for Defense Analyses connections and both Princeton and Columbia's performance of Pentagon-sponsored basic research and weapons development activity on campus. Nearly all the people attending the informal summer Columbia SDS steering with Gold were [...] "Praxis Axis" [...] people. Columbia SDS activist Bob Feldman brought to one of the meetings new research about IDA's involvement in [...] "Project Agile" [...] which directly related to weapons research for Vietnam War operational activity. There was also much theoretical discussion at these informal summer meetings about New Left political strategy and Columbia SDS chapter internal organization and education. Peter Schneider, Columbia SDS Chairman Teddy Kaptchuk and Gold, especially, seemed to feel that too great a gap existed between the political consciousness level of Columbia SDS's leadership and its rank-and-file's political consciousness level. Each felt that in the 67-68 academic year a special effort should be made to involve rank-and-file members in smaller groups to maximize their participation in Columbia SDS chapter activity. In the summer of 1967, Monthly Review published an English translation of Régis <b>Debray's</b> Revolution In The Revolution?, which argued in support of Che Guevara's [...] "foci theory of revolution". Near the end of the summer, a New York SDS regional organizer named Halliwell appeared at one meeting {{to make the case for}} applying <b>Debray's</b> theory of [...] "mobile tactics" [...] to Columbia University conditions, with Columbia SDS acting as the non-violent equivalent of Che's [...] "guerrilla foci group". According to Halliwell's analogy, the mass of Columbia students, like the mass of Latin American peasants, could only be aroused if Columbia SDS developed the capacity to act on an off-campus level as a mobile non-violent guerrilla foci at anti-war demonstrations. In Halliwell's view, Columbia SDS should continue to use its usual educational methods to persuade future members of the new working-class (the mass of Columbia University student [...] "peasants") to become off-campus mobile demonstrators who pushed the U.S. anti-war movement [...] "from protest to resistance" [...] by their mobile tactics. In July 1967, however, Gold seemed only lukewarm about having Columbia SDS adopt some variant of Halliwell's [...] "Debrayist" [...] New Working-class organizing strategy.|$|R

50|$|Burke, {{by his own}} account, was of Irish {{descent and}} born in Louisville, Kentucky. Burke's initial career started with the railroads. At the age of {{thirteen}} he was employed as a railroad telegraph operator in Urbana, Illinois. By the age of seventeen, he had been promoted to a division superintendent. The outbreak of the Civil War found Burke working for a railroad in Texas. On October 7, 1861 he was commissioned as a Confederate officer into <b>Debray's</b> Mounted Battalion. His knowledge of transportation logistics gained through his years of railroad experience resulted in his temporary transfer to Texas' Office of Field Transportation in March 1863. By December of that year the transfer was permanent. By war's end Burke had reached the rank of major with a duty assignment as Quartermaster and Chief Inspector of Field Transportation, District of Texas. After the war Burke's business career wavered. In Galveston he initially found work as telegraph operator {{and then as a}} manager of a cotton factorage. He later teamed up with another former Confederate officer, H. B. Stoddart, and formed the import export firm, Stoddart & Burk. The firm primarily exported cotton and imported liquor. In January 1869, the firm faced tax evasion charges from failure to pay federal taxes due on the imported alcohol. The charges against Burke were eventually dismissed, but the litigation left the firm and Burke in bankruptcy. Burke tried to revitalize his fortunes by being elected the Chief Engineer of Galveston's volunteer fire department.|$|R
40|$|This is not {{the first}} essay to look at the film 'Elizabeth' (UK, Shekhar Kapur, 1999) but it is the first essay to link it up with the two other 'royal' films which preceded it in the 1990 s. It argues that these three films advance beyond the {{previously}} acknowledged confines of the 'heritage' film and so change the trajectory of heritage cinema. By linking 'heritage' cinema with contemporary social and political events, these films take on a new significance and create a new climate for film-makers within this genre, rather than the previous tendency simply to idealize 'the world we have lost'. The essay takes as its starting-point Guy Debord's famous polemic 'The Society of the Spectacle', and argues that now, as never before, the concept of 'spectacle' - and of culture as the star commodity of the 'spectacular' society - are not only central to any social critique but inform all cultural production. The essay draws on Regis <b>Debray's</b> controversial article' Admirable England?', delineating the social and political implications of Princess Diana's funeral and the attendant public hysteria. It concludes by suggesting that not only do the trilogy of films under scrutiny form a new strand within the genre - but that 'Elizabeth' goes further, making of itself the first postmodern heritage film, the first to jettison period fidelity, to engage in ostentatious pastiche, and to open up new artistic and political possibilities for future 'heritage' cinema...|$|R
