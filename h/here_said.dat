It stands on the site of earlier buildings, with the first church <b>here</b> <b>said</b> to have been {{established}} by St Elaeth (or Eleth) in the 6th century. Increasing prosperity in the town through copper mining during the 18th century led to {{the construction of a new}} church to serve the growing population.|$|E
5|$|A {{soldier on}} {{vacation}} <b>here</b> <b>said</b> he witnessed a terrible atrocity {{in the occupied}} parts of Poland. He watched as naked Jewish {{men and women were}} placed in front of a long deep ditch and upon the order of the SS were shot by Ukrainians {{in the back of their}} heads and they fell into the ditch. Then the ditch was filled with dirt even as he could still hear screams coming from people still alive in the ditch. These inhuman atrocities were so terrible that some of the Ukrainians, who were used as tools, suffered nervous breakdowns. All the soldiers who had knowledge of these bestial actions of these Nazi sub-humans were of the opinion that the German people should be shaking in their shoes because of the coming retribution. There is no punishment that would be hard enough to be applied to these Nazi beasts. Of course, when the retribution comes, the innocent will have to suffer along with them. But because ninety-nine percent of the German population is guilty, directly or indirectly, for the present situation, we can only say that those who travel together will hang together. , Friedrich Kellner exhibit.

2500|$|Milošević's critics {{claim that}} he cynically planned and {{organized}} the anti-bureaucratic revolution to strengthen his political power.

[...] Commenting on Milošević's role in the anti-bureaucratic revolution, Slovene president Milan Kučan said, [...] "none of us believed in Slovenia that these were spontaneous meetings and rallies." [...] He accused the Serbian government of deliberately fanning nationalist passions and Slovene newspapers published articles comparing Milošević to Italian Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini, a one-time Marxist who turned to nationalism. Milošević contended that such criticism was unfounded and amounted to [...] "spreading fear of Serbia".|$|E
2500|$|African {{historian}} Lidwien Kapteijns {{describes the}} ordeal of Isaaqs refugees fleeing their homes as follows:Throughout this period, the whole civilian population appears to have become a target, {{in their homes and}} anywhere they sought refuge. Even during their long and harrowing exodus - on foot, without water or food, carrying the young and weak, giving birth on the way - across the border to Ethiopia, planes strafed them from the air.Genocide scholar Adam Jones also discusses this particular aspect of the Siad Barre's campaign against the Isaaq: In two months, from May to July 1988, between 50,000 and 100,000 people were massacred by the regime's forces. By then, any surviving urban Isaaks - that is to say, hundreds of thousands of members of the main northern clan community - had fled across the border into Ethiopia. They were pursued along the way by British-made fighter-bombers piloted by mercenary South African and ex-Rhodesian pilots, paid $2,000 per sortie.Despite the government's continued refusal to grant international human rights organisations and foreign journalists [...] access to the north to report on the situation, The New York Times reported the strafing of Isaaq refugees as part of its coverage of the conflict:Western diplomats <b>here</b> <b>said</b> they believed that the fighting in Somalia, which has gone largely unreported in the West, was continuing unabated. More than 10,000 people were killed in the first month after the conflict began in late May, according to reports reaching diplomats here. The Somali Government has bombed towns and strafed fleeing residents and used artillery indiscriminately, according to the officials.|$|E
