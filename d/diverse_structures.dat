5|$|Variations in the toolkit {{may have}} {{produced}} {{a large part of}} the morphological evolution of animals. The toolkit can drive evolution in two ways. A toolkit gene can be expressed in a different pattern, as when the beak of Darwin's large ground-finch was enlarged by the BMP gene, or when snakes lost their legs as distal-less became under-expressed or not expressed at all in the places where other reptiles continued to form their limbs. Or, a toolkit gene can acquire a new function, as seen in the many functions of that same gene, distal-less, which controls such <b>diverse</b> <b>structures</b> as the mandible in vertebrates, legs and antennae in the fruit fly, and eyespot pattern in butterfly wings. Given that small changes in toolbox genes can cause significant changes in body structures, they have often enabled the same function convergently or in parallel. distal-less generates wing patterns in the butterflies Heliconius erato and Heliconius melpomene, which are Müllerian mimics. In so-called facilitated variation, their wing patterns arose in different evolutionary events, but are controlled by the same genes. Developmental changes can contribute directly to speciation.|$|E

2500|$|Before la Jeune Parque, Valéry's only {{publications}} of note were dialogues, articles, some poems, and {{a study of}} Leonardo da Vinci. In 1920 and 1922, he published two slim collections of verses. The first, Album des vers anciens (Album of ancient verses), was a revision of early but beautifully wrought smaller poems, some {{of which had been}} published individually before 1900. The second, Charmes (from the Latin carmina, meaning [...] "songs" [...] and also [...] "incantations"), further confirmed his reputation as a major French poet. [...] The collection includes le Cimetière marin, and many smaller poems with <b>diverse</b> <b>structures.</b> 'Le Cimetière marin' is mentioned or indirectly implied or referred to in at least four of Iris Murdoch's novels, The Unicorn, The Time of the Angels, The Nice and the Good and The Sea, The Sea.|$|E
2500|$|When lipids are {{extracted}} or {{isolated from}} biomembranes, Polymorphism and mesomorphism can occur {{because they are}} then no longer under the intermolecular constraints that are present within the biomembrane. This can lead to formation of non-lamellar (non-bilayer) or lamellar phases in phospholipids. [...] "Polymorphism" [...] refers to formation of <b>diverse</b> <b>structures</b> such as three-dimensional tubes, rods, and structures with cubic symmetry. Mesomorphism refers to phase transitions when heat is applied. For example, a lipid {{can be in the}} lamellar phase at a lower temperature, but as the temperature increases it transitions into a non-lamellar phase. It is important to consider the size of the hydrophilic region versus the hydrophobic region. For example, if the hydrophilic region and hydrophobic region are similar, a cylindrical shape lipid bilayer is formed; but when the hydrophilic regions is smaller than the hydrophobic region a cone shaped lipid bilayer is formed. Another example is the formation of micelles which has a non-lamellar formation in which the hydrophilic region is significantly larger compared to the hydrophobic region. There are various liquid-crystalline phases that can exist in lipids. Liquid-crystalline phases are when the hydrophobic chain regions are not motionless but are allowed to move about freely in a fluid-like melted state. The lamellar phase (Lα) is the most common and dominant phase in lipids and are aligned as stacks of bilayers on top of bilayers oriented in one single direction.|$|E
