5|$|In 1948, De Mauro {{moved to}} Palermo in Sicily under an assumed name, {{and worked for}} local {{newspapers}} such as Il Tempo di Sicilia, and Il Mattino di Sicilia. In 1959 he started working for L'Ora, a Communist-oriented paper. Other journalists were puzzled about De Mauro's presence at the newspaper: {{he had been a}} supporter of Mussolini until the bitter end and fought in the brutal war against the anti-Fascist partisans. Rumour <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> his nose had been broken by partisans.|$|E
5|$|Later Spruyt {{acted as}} State President during the {{absences}} of President Pretorius from Bloemfontein. Although general opinion <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> Spruyt {{was a man}} of lesser qualities, on his resignation he was praised by State President Pretorius as very loyal and accurate in his work.|$|E
5|$|Over the years, {{the name}} has {{attracted}} many mythicising explanations. The earliest attested appears in Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae, written around 1136. This <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> the name originated from a supposed King Lud, who had allegedly {{taken over the}} city and named it Kaerlud.|$|E
50|$|Legend <b>has</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> Garudan, Markandeya, Lakshmi and Sibi Chakravarti offered worship here. Legend <b>has</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> Vishnu blessed Markandeya, Bhudevi and Sibi Chakravarti 4 chaturyugas ago (17.3 million years).|$|R
50|$|Legend <b>has</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> Indra and Agastyar worshipped Subramanyar here. Legend also <b>has</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> the Saravanapoikai {{tank was}} created when Murugan struck his spear to the ground, upon being {{requested}} by his consort.|$|R
50|$|Local legend <b>has</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was {{originally}} named Rossville after Ds Ross {{and that the}} name was changed to Rhodes {{in the hopes that}} the mining magnate and then Prime Minister of the Cape, Cecil John Rhodes, would bless the village with his beneficence. Alas, this was not to be and the legend <b>has</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> he sent a wagonload of Stone Pine trees instead. Another variation <b>has</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> he sent the trees as well as £500. The story continues that the funds disappeared together with the official who received them. More recent speculation would <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> the trees could not have been donated by Rhodes as the species reputed to have been supplied by him have a life-expectancy which has long been exceeded.|$|R
5|$|According to Plutarch, one {{tradition}} <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> the Persian king (who at {{the time}} would still have been Xerxes) agreed a humiliating peace treaty {{in the aftermath of}} the Eurymedon. However, as Plutarch admits, other authors denied that such a peace was made at this time, and the more logical date for any peace treaty would have been after the Cyprus campaign of 450 BC. The alternative suggested by Plutarch is that the Persian king acted as if he had made a humiliating peace with the Greeks, because he was so fearful of engaging in battle with them again. It is generally considered unlikely by modern historians that a peace treaty was made in the aftermath of Eurymedon.|$|E
5|$|After this, Baker {{appeared}} in the independent British-German film Station Six-Sahara (1962) {{as a woman who}} provokes tensions at an oil station in the Sahara Desert, as well as the blockbuster Western epic How the West Was Won (1962), opposite Debbie Reynolds and former co-stars Gregory Peck and Karl Malden. In addition to film acting, Baker also found time to appear again on Broadway, starring in the 1962 production of Garson Kanin's Come on Strong in the fall of that year. In 1963, Baker relocated permanently with then-husband Jack Garfein and their two children to Los Angeles, where she based herself for the next several years. She traveled to Kenya to film Mister Moses (1965), where publicized rumors spread that she and co-star Robert Mitchum were having an affair, which they both vehemently denied. Another story, now considered apocryphal, <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> a Maasai chief in Kenya offered 150 cows, 200 goats, sheep, and $750 for her hand in marriage. She subsequently appeared with Maasai warriors on the cover of Lifes July 1964 issue.|$|E
5|$|At 5ft 4in (1.62m), Burnham was slight, but he {{was also}} muscular and bronzed, with a finely formed square jaw. He had a boyish {{appearance}} which he used to his advantage on numerous occasions. His most noticeable feature was his steady, grey-blue eyes. Contemporary reports <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> Burnham's gaze appeared to never leave those of the person he was looking at, and yet somehow could simultaneously monitor all the details of the physical surroundings. It was also said that Burnham's eyes possessed a far-away look such as those acquired by people whose occupation has caused them to watch continually at sea or on great plains.|$|E
50|$|This vast temple {{known is}} for its shrine to Rahu, {{one of the}} nine {{celestial}} bodies in the Navagraha. A legend <b>has</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> the mythological serpents Adiseshan, Dakshan and Kaarkotakan worshipped Shiva here. Legend also <b>has</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> King Nala worshipped Shiva here as in Thirunallar.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are quite}} a few conjectures on how Piat got its name. One <b>has</b> <b>it</b> is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> derives from [...] "piyas," [...] an Ilokano word, in Ibanag [...] "addulu" [...] and in Tagalog, [...] "kamiyas." [...] Another <b>has</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> the word comes from [...] "aggapiya," [...] meaning [...] "healer, masseuse," [...] and a more {{credible}} version <b>has</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is derived from the Ibanag and Itawes word [...] "piya" [...] which means [...] "goodness, kindness, health." ...|$|R

5|$|In the 1960s, the Soviet Union {{originated}} Project 1144 Orlan, {{a project}} intended {{to design and}} build a large, nuclear powered anti-submarine vessel. At the time, the Soviets did not envisage that arming surface ships with anti-ship missiles was required, as then current doctrine <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> submarines were the main platform for attacking enemy shipping. However, {{the sinking of the}} Israeli destroyer INS Eilat in 1967 by anti-ship missiles fired from an Egyptian missile boat led to a re-think of the use of surface ships in the role. The threat of US Navy surface ships, which were increasingly capable of a range of different missions, led {{to the idea of a}} single ship combining anti-aircraft, anti-ship and anti-submarine capabilities crystalising.|$|E
5|$|Kogălniceanu's nephew, Grigore, {{himself a}} local {{leader of the}} Conservative Party and a major landowner, married to Adela Cantacuzino-Pașcanu, {{a member of the}} Cantacuzino family. He died in 1904, leaving his wife a large fortune, which she spent on a large {{collection}} of jewels and fortune-telling séances. Adela Kogălniceanu was robbed and murdered in October 1920; rumor <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> she had been killed by her own son, but this path was never pursued by authorities, who were quick to cancel the investigation (at the time, they were faced with the major strikes of 1920).|$|E
5|$|Several {{suggestions}} {{have been}} made {{for the history of}} the Great Stone. There was a succession of plagues in Manchester from the 14th century onwards, and during the Great Plague of 1655–56 the holes {{in the top of the}} stone were filled with vinegar or holy water, through which coins were passed in the belief that would halt the spread of the disease. But the holes are probably too deep for that to have been the stone's original purpose. It may have been a marker on the Roman road between Northwich and Manchester, or some kind of boundary marker. The Great Stone is also thought to have been the base of an Anglo-Saxon cross shaft. A local legend <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> the stone was slowly sinking into the earth, and that its ultimate disappearance would mark the end of the world.|$|E

5|$|The Dominican Order had {{its origins}} in the reformist {{ideology}} of Dominic de Guzmán, later Saint Dominic. By 1219, Dominic had established houses as far apart as Paris, Bologna, Madrid and Segovia; at his death in 1221, there were 21 houses. Expansion of the order continued into England as houses were established at Oxford in 1221 and London in 1224. There were five houses in England by 1230, by which time the Order was poised to enter Scotland. Later tradition <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> the Dominican Order entered Scotland in 1230, encouraged by King Alexander II and William de Malveisin, Bishop of St Andrews. However, the earliest certain date for {{the foundation of a}} Dominican house in Scotland is 1234.|$|E
5|$|Wiesenthal was {{nominated}} for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1985, the fortieth anniversary {{of the end of}} the war. Rumour <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> the Nobel Committee would give the prize to a Holocaust-related candidate. Fellow Holocaust survivor and author Elie Wiesel, also nominated, began a campaign in hopes of winning the prize, travelling to France, Ethiopia and Oslo for speaking tours and humanitarian work. Rabbi Hier of the Wiesenthal Center urged Wiesenthal to lobby for the prize as well, but other than delivering a lecture in Oslo, Wiesenthal did little to promote his candidacy. When Wiesel was awarded the 1986 prize, Wiesenthal claimed the World Jewish Congress must have influenced the Committee's decision, a claim the WJC denied. Biographer Tom Segev speculates that the loss may have been because of the negative publicity over the Waldheim affair.|$|E
5|$|Monarchs {{sometimes}} went {{to great}} lengths to prevent this. On her marriage to Louis XIV of France, Maria Theresa, daughter of Philip IV of Spain, was forced to renounce her claim to the Spanish throne. When monarchs or heirs apparent wed other monarchs or heirs, special agreements, sometimes in the form of treaties, were negotiated to determine inheritance rights. The marriage contract of Philip II of Spain and Mary I of England, for example, stipulated that the maternal possessions, as well as Burgundy and the Low Countries, were to pass to any future children of the couple, whereas the remaining paternal possessions (including Spain, Naples, Sicily, Milan) would first of all go to Philip's son Don Carlos, from his previous marriage to Maria Manuela of Portugal. If Carlos were to die without any descendants, only then would they pass to the children of his second marriage. On the other hand, the Franco-Scottish treaty that arranged the 1558 marriage of Mary, Queen of Scots and Francis, the son and heir of Henry II of France, <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> if the queen died without descendants, Scotland would fall to the throne of France.|$|E

25|$|Village {{tradition}} <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> {{the current}} St Catherine's Church was predated by an older building which {{was destroyed by}} fire.

25|$|Together with Kiriloff, Cătărău was {{the main}} suspect behind an act of violence, carried out against Romania's rival neighbor, Austria-Hungary, and {{targeting}} the symbols of Hungarian identity. The two are credited as responsible for the planting of dynamite around a Hungarian monument on Tâmpa Hill, which heavily damaged the structure (September 27, 1913). Later investigation <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> Cătărău and Kiriloff had several times crossed into Transylvania using false papers.|$|E
25|$|By 12 October, {{the royal}} {{children}} {{had arrived at}} Siriraj Hospital and Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn had met with the prime minister.

25|$|The {{rivalry between}} the two actresses is cited as an {{alternative}} to the Martina Lawrence-Elizabeth Bergner origin of Mary Orr's short story, The Wisdom of Eve (1946), the basis of the 1950 film All About Eve. Broadway legend <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> Bankhead was being victimized by Scott, who was supposedly the real-life Eve Harrington. During her eight months as the understudy, Scott never had an opportunity to substitute for Bankhead, as Scott's presence guaranteed Bankhead's.|$|E
