5000|$|An <b>immediate</b> <b>or</b> <b>cancel</b> (IOC) <b>order,</b> {{also known}} as an [...] "accept order", is a finance term used in {{investment}} banking or securities transactions that refers [...] "an order {{to buy or sell}} a stock that must be executed immediately". In case the entire order is not available at that moment for purchase a partial fulfillment is possible, but any portion of an IOC order that cannot be filled immediately is cancelled, obviating the need for manual cancellation. This [...] "partial fulfillment" [...] aspect is what differentiates IOC orders from all or none (AON) and fill or kill (FOK) orders.|$|R

40|$|The International Association of Machinists (IAM) and Boeing Company Quality Through Training Program (QTTP) {{is playing}} a vital role within the Boeing Company {{to cope with a}} {{complicated}} situation: reducing the workforce, implementing lean manufacturing, and the upcoming training of a new workforce as thousands of workers prepare for retirement in the coming years. QTTP Joint Training Programs were not created with these specific uses in mind, but because the programs are already established, they provide a foundation on which to build these new roles. Internal union and management groups are now relying on the credibility and connections of the QTTP leadership to facilitate organizational problem-solving. This case study describes how the joint program has responded to new organizational needs heightened by sudden changes in the aerospace industry. The events of September 11, 2001 were devastating for the aerospace industry. One year after the tragic events, (you say below that airlines postponed <b>or</b> <b>cancelled</b> <b>orders)</b> business air travel had declined approximately 30 % while air travel overall was off approximately 11 %. The airline industry was projected to lose more than $ 5 billion in 2002, on top of losing $ 7. 7 billion in 2001. United Airlines filed for bankruptcy, while most other airlines continue to post stunning losses. In response to the drop in air travel demand, the airlines reduced the number of flights – requiring less aircraft. As a result, airlines postponed <b>or</b> <b>cancelled</b> <b>orders</b> for new planes. Boeing’s commercial business was hit hard and the company has announced the layoff of 30, 000 workers. Despite this rather bleak picture, the QTTP leaders and representatives continue to skillfully promote joint, innovative activities that are mutually beneficial to those they represent. The activities described in this case are examples of the initiatives that QTTP is promoting. Of note is the consideration and respect that form the basis upon which decisions are made within the group...|$|R

40|$|Supply chain {{management}} (SCM) addresses the strategic, tactical, and operational decision making that optimizes {{the supply chain}} performance. The strategic level defines the supply chain configuration: the selection of suppliers, transportation routes, manufacturing facilities, production levels, technologies. The tactical level plans and schedules the supply chain to meet actual demand. The operational level executes plans. Tactical and operational level decision-making functions are distributed across the supply chain. To increase or optimize performance, supply-chain functions must be perfectly coordinated. But the cycles of the enterprise and the market make this difficult: raw material does not arrive on time, production facilities fail, workers are ill, customers change <b>or</b> <b>cancel</b> <b>orders,</b> therefore, causing deviations from the plan. In some cases, these situations may be dealt with locally. In other cases, the problem cannot be ”locally contained” and modifications across many functions are required. Consequently, the supply {{chain management}} system must coordinate the revision of plans or schedules. The ability to better understand an algorithm is important {{to focus on the}} following variables: tactical and operational levels of the supply chain so that the timely dissemination of information, accurate coordination of decisions, and management of actions among people and systems is achieved ultimately determines the efficient, coordinated achievement of enterprise goal...|$|R

40|$|We {{perform a}} {{comprehensive}} test of order choice theory from a sample {{period when the}} NYSE trades in decimals and allows automatic executions. We analyze the decision to submit <b>or</b> <b>cancel</b> an <b>order</b> <b>or</b> to take no action. For submitted orders we distinguish order type (market vs. limit), order side (buy vs sell), execution method (floor vs. automatic), and order pricing aggressiveness. We use a multinomial logit specification and a new statistical test. We find a negative autocorrelation in changes in order flow exists over five-minute intervals supporting dynamic limit order book theory, despite a positive first-order autocorrelation in order type. Orders routed to the NYSE’s floor are sensitive to market conditions (e. g., spread, depth, volume, volatility, market and individual-stock returns, and private information), but those using the automatic execution system (Direct+) are insensitive to market conditions.

40|$|Large, multi-national {{retailers}} have massive, worldwide supply chain networks which move product from a supplier {{to the end}} consumer. During the product's transit from a factory to a regional distribution center, customers may change <b>or</b> <b>cancel</b> their <b>order,</b> <b>or</b> the planned arrival date of the product at the distribution center may change. These products are packed in containers and arrive at the distribution center daily. Each day, humans may make decisions of which containers will be received at a distribution center and there are opportunity costs associated with selecting the wrong container to receive, namely, that the distribution center will become filled with product which is not immediately needed to meet outbound demand. This thesis analyzes one method of receiving containers at a distribution center and the impacts it has on satisfying customers' orders. A model for a lean inventory management system and a container selection optimization model are described in it. Representative data is presented and the model is used to solve which containers should be received.

30|$|Many {{manufacturing}} companies use computer-based planning systems (e.g., advanced planning systems (APS), enterprise resources planning (ERP) or manufacturing resources planning (MRP II) systems) to support strategic, tactical, and operational decisions. Planning systems not only require consideration of interdependencies between several planning tasks, but also must incorporate data uncertainty to react flexibly to data changes. This helps to minimize costs {{and to ensure}} service-level agreements. Short-medium-term production planning problems (e.g., lot-sizing and scheduling in a make-to-stock environment) are especially susceptible to demand uncertainty (e.g., last-minute <b>canceled</b> <b>or</b> rushed <b>orders).</b> However, current commercial mixed-integer programming (MIP) solvers cannot provide (even near) optimum solutions for such a problem in a total model, while successively solved partial models ignore most interdependencies between decisions. In a compromise between interdependencies and variety of decisions in a model, hierarchical planning systems (HPS) are used to meet requirements of short-medium-term production planning problems (Fleischmann et al. 2015).|$|R

40|$|Global supply chains, shorter {{product life}} cycles, and {{technological}} innovation have made {{supply chain management}} a critical issue for firm’s success. By improving service and reducing costs, efficient supply chain management brings companies competitive advantage and helps them to outperform their competitors. Due to tight supply or unfavorable conditions, Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) might occasionally find itself in a situation where it is not able or willing to source its required raw material form authorized channel. In this case, OEM options narrow down to waiting until the item become available in authorized channel (backlogging its customer orders), sourcing from unauthorized channel, <b>or</b> <b>cancelling</b> customer <b>orders.</b> Each one of these scenarios causes particular consequences. Main objective {{of this study is}} to clarify the consequences of sourcing form unauthorized distributors on the supply chain performance and its financial performance of OEM. Study is composed of a qualitative phase and a quantitative phase. During each phase, a proper set of supply chain metrics and financial measures are employed to understand the effects of sourcing from unauthorized distributors and counterfeits parts. In both phases, SCOR model is used as a reference for supply chain metrics as well as to understand the supply chain processes. Based on the study results, there is obviously a trade-off involved in sourcing from unauthorized channel. It may help the OEM in some respects; however, it may pose a risk to the OEM performance at the same time. Particular circumstance of each business is a key factor to determine the effects. Among the factors studied, raw material quality, sourcing volume, and accusation price are the most important ones respectively. The most influential factor is raw material quality and it mostly outweighs the effect of the unauthorized distributors’ lower prices. It implies that lower prices should not be the sole incentive to source from unauthorized channel. Concerning all factors is a must. In case that OEM decide to source from unauthorized channel, proper risk mitigation methods should be employed to reduce the risk of receiving low quality articles...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBased on {{the first}} results, the French {{government}} estimates that the tax on <b>cancelled</b> <b>orders,</b> considered as tax on High Frequency Trading (HFT), generated no revenue in 2012. Our paper question {{the effectiveness of a}} modified <b>cancelled</b> <b>order</b> tax with no exemptions, all <b>orders</b> <b>cancelled</b> <b>or</b> modified within half-second time span are taxed. Our study has important implications for the regulation of HFT; we provide recommendations for regulators in relation to market rules which have yet to be introduced, using an artificial market framework. This paper addresses the question of whether this tax leads to a reduction in HFT activities and, as a result, to deterioration or amelioration of market quality. The evidence we provide should help market regulators to better understand the role played by HFT firms as liquidity suppliers. We show that HFT liquidity is short-lived. With the implementation of tax, decreased HFT activities do not have a statistically significant impact on market volatility and market liquidity measured by bid/ask spreads, but decrease dollar volumes as a liquidity measure. In addition, reduced HFT activities lead to less efficient markets as the deviation from fundamentals increases...|$|R
