2500|$|Democrats in the House of Representatives {{and in the}} Senate near-unanimously {{voted for}} the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists against [...] "those {{responsible}} for the recent attacks launched against the United States" [...] in Afghanistan in 2001, supporting the NATO coalition invasion of the nation. Most elected Democrats continue to support the Afghanistan conflict, and some, such as a Democratic National Committee spokesperson, have voiced concerns that the Iraq War shifted too many resources away from the presence in Afghanistan. Since 2006, Democratic candidate Barack Obama {{has called for a}} [...] "surge" [...] of troops into Afghanistan and, since 2008, Republican candidate <b>John</b> <b>McCain</b> <b>has</b> also called for a [...] "surge".

Obama plans to bring all the troops home by 2014.|$|E
2500|$|After the {{new rules}} were issued, two {{campaign}} staffers, regional campaign manager Doug Davenport and Republican National Convention chief Doug Goodyear, both of whom had represented the Burmese military government, departed. So too did Eric Burgeson, who had lobbied the U.S. government on energy issues. Republican political consultant Craig Shirley left the campaign due to ties with anti-Hillary Clinton group Stop Her Now. National finance co-chair Tom Loeffler left the campaign due to his lobbying group's work for Saudi Arabia and other foreign countries. Other top campaign staff such as campaign manager Rick Davis (who devised {{the new rules}}), strategist Charles Black, and foreign policy advisor Randy Scheunemann, had already stopped such activities and remained with the campaign. McCain was criticized by Campaign Money Watch and MoveOn.org for retaining Black, but Public Citizen came to McCain's defense, saying that [...] "Regardless of how many lobbyists are working on his campaign or raising money for him, <b>John</b> <b>McCain</b> <b>has</b> fought for 14 long, hard years for reforms that seriously limit lobbyists' power." [...] Some other lobbyists and academics said that despite highly publicized abuses, lobbyists were {{an important part of}} the governmental process, and that the campaign-time criticisms and reactions were grandstanding. Meanwhile, outside Republicans feared the lobbying rules activities were hampering the McCain campaign, which was lagging in organizational and fundraising progress.|$|E

5000|$|On February 20, {{the night}} before the article {{appeared}} in the printed newspaper, but just after the story was available online, the McCain presidential campaign issued the following statement: [...] "It is a shame that The New York Times has lowered its standards to engage in a hit-and-run smear campaign. <b>John</b> <b>McCain</b> <b>has</b> a 24-year record of serving our country with honor and integrity. He has never violated the public trust, never done favors for special interests or lobbyists, and he will not allow a smear campaign to distract from the issues at stake in this election. Americans {{are sick and tired of}} this kind of gutter politics, and there is nothing in this story to suggest that <b>John</b> <b>McCain</b> <b>has</b> ever violated the principles that have guided his career.” A McCain campaign adviser added that the report “reads like a tabloid gossip sheet”.|$|E
5000|$|<b>John</b> <b>McCain</b> <b>has</b> {{said of his}} mother: [...] "My {{mother was}} raised to be a strong, {{determined}} woman who thoroughly enjoyed life, and always {{tried to make the}} most of her opportunities.

I am grateful to her for the strengths she taught me by example." ...|$|E
50|$|The United States Senate {{is split}} {{over how to}} handle the issue, with Democrats urging the {{creation}} of a special court to review the matrix. Senate Armed Services Committee chair <b>John</b> <b>McCain</b> <b>has</b> called for control of all armed drones to be transferred from the CIA to the U.S. Department of Defense, while Dianne Feinstein has expressed doubt that the Pentagon would take the same level of care to avoid collateral damage.|$|E
5000|$|<b>John</b> <b>McCain</b> <b>had</b> already {{secured the}} {{majority}} of delegates for the Republican Party nomination, and captured 73% of Republican votes in the Pennsylvania primary.

5000|$|O'Reilly {{criticized the}} paper for running an article alleging Senator <b>John</b> <b>McCain</b> <b>had</b> an [...] "inappropriate relationship" [...] during the {{lobbyist}} controversy story the paper had.

25|$|Lieberman's {{embrace of}} certain {{conservative}} policies {{and in particular}} his endorsement of <b>John</b> <b>McCain</b> <b>have</b> been cited as factors for his high approval rating among Republicans in Connecticut with 66% of Republicans approving of him along with 52% of independents also approving of his job performance, this however is also cited for his mediocre approval rating among Democrats: 44% approving and 46% disapproving.|$|R

5000|$|As a Latina {{and a new}} American citizen, I {{believe in}} this country and its people, and I believe that we need more than just [...] "change." [...] We need a leader who can bring about the right kind of change, and <b>John</b> <b>McCain</b> <b>has</b> the {{experience}} and judgment necessary to lead us in these uncertain times. I grew up in Cuba and Venezuela, and I am appalled that Barack Obama apparently wants to emulate the [...] "spread the wealth" [...] economic policies of those countries and negotiate with their leaders.|$|E
50|$|Construction {{of the dam}} was a {{contentious}} issue for Arizona. Built {{as part of the}} larger Colorado River Compact of 1922, several political groups, their members and privately owned utility companies in Arizona were not pleased with the plan in general and refused to sign it until 1944. Even then Arizona continued to dispute its water allotments until a 1963 Supreme Court decision settled the issue. The court has had to adjust the agreement several times since, most recently in 2000. As recently as 2008 Arizona Senator <b>John</b> <b>McCain</b> <b>has</b> called for a renegotiation of the plan.|$|E
50|$|Ed Rollins, Huckabee's {{campaign}} chairman, directly challenged Esser’s move, {{saying the}} count was incomplete {{because the other}} 12.8 percent of precincts could tip the scales. “The chairman showed very bad judgment in stopping the voting last night when announcing <b>John</b> <b>McCain</b> <b>had</b> won, when there {{was less than a}} 200-vote margin between the two candidates,” Rollins told FOX News in an exclusive interview.|$|R

50|$|The Republican Party {{does not}} mandate a {{proportional}} representation system for delegate selection, but instead allows each state {{to determine its}} selection process.

50|$|Although the February 5, 2008 primary was {{the eighth}} presidential cycle since Connecticut {{replaced}} local primaries with a statewide primary in 1977, {{it was only}} the sixth primary to feature Republican candidates due to the unchallenged incumbents of Ronald Reagan in 1984 and George W. Bush in 2004. With <b>John</b> <b>McCain</b> <b>having</b> won the 2008 Republican nomination, Connecticut selected the eventual Republican nominee 67 percent of the time.|$|R
5000|$|Between 2005 and 2009, Cusack wrote blogs for The Huffington Post, which {{included}} {{an interview with}} Naomi Klein.

He also appeared in a June 2008 MoveOn.org advertisement, where he made the claim that George W. Bush and <b>John</b> <b>McCain</b> <b>have</b> the same governing priorities.|$|R
5000|$|As the {{campaign}} progressed, many parodies and imitations of Fairey's design appeared.

[...] In January 2009 Paste magazine launched a site allowing users {{to create their}} own versions of the poster. More than 10,000 images were uploaded to the site in its first two weeks.|$|R
