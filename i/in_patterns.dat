5|$|In mimesis (also called masquerade), the camouflaged object {{looks like}} {{something}} else which is of no special interest to the observer. Mimesis is common in prey animals, for example when a peppered moth caterpillar mimics a twig, or a grasshopper mimics a dry leaf. It {{is also found in}} nest structures; some eusocial wasps, such as Leipomeles dorsata, build a nest envelope <b>in</b> <b>patterns</b> that mimic the leaves surrounding the nest.|$|E

The text lists types of aromatic woods, such as sandalwood and their qualities. The text describes the art of painting as three types — Viddha (representational), Aviddha (sketch, outline) and Bhava (narrative). The text includes a recipe for making various types of paints, as well as crayons for drawing, and then recommends the steps in making a drawing.|$|E

These were originally quarters for officers but have since been converted into laboratory and office space. The buildings {{are in the same}} style as the {{main building}} with facades that include terracotta and brick <b>in</b> <b>patterns</b> resembling woven baskets. Other additions include a parking garage and smaller metal buildings. The property is surrounded by a detailed wrought iron fence.|$|E
40|$|Nonylphenol {{ethoxylate}} (NPEO) -degrading bacteria {{were isolated}} from activated sludge using an improved isolation method, {{and the corresponding}} degradation behaviours were investigated. Eight NPEO-degrading strains distributed in genera Pseudomonas, Sphingomonas, Sphingobium, Cupriavidus, Ralstonia, Achromobacter, and Staphylococcus were acquired. The latter five genera have never been reported for the degradation of NPEOs. Four degradation patterns were observed for the eight pure strains. <b>In</b> <b>pattern</b> A, NPEOs were converted to short-chain NPEOs and carboxylated products, while <b>in</b> <b>pattern</b> B, lower ethoxylated oligomers appeared. Nonylphenol monoethoxylate was the main product <b>in</b> <b>pattern</b> C, while <b>in</b> <b>pattern</b> D ethoxylated units was oxidized but not shortened.

It means that there is a good mobility control <b>in</b> <b>Pattern</b> 3. <b>In</b> contrary, the oil cut during Pattern 1 decreases sharply during the ASP slug oil bank production which means an unfavorable mobility ratio is found that results in less oil recovery <b>in</b> <b>Pattern</b> 1.|$|R

5|$|Twin {{depth charge}} tunnels were {{built into the}} rear hull of the Mogador-class ships. Each tunnel housed eight Guirard depth charges, with another sixteen stowed in the rear magazine. They were {{launched}} by remote control <b>in</b> <b>patterns</b> of four using a chain system. Since no sonar equipment was fitted these depth charges were unlikely to actually damage a submarine.|$|E
5|$|In endometrioid adenocarcinoma, {{the cancer}} cells grow <b>in</b> <b>patterns</b> {{reminiscent}} of normal endometrium, with many new glands formed from columnar epithelium with some abnormal nuclei. Low-grade endometrioid adenocarcinomas have well differentiated cells, have not invaded the myometrium, and are seen alongside endometrial hyperplasia. The tumor's glands form very close together, without the stromal tissue that normally separates them. Higher-grade endometrioid adenocarcinomas have less well-differentiated cells, have more solid sheets of tumor cells no longer organized into glands, and {{are associated with}} an atrophied endometrium. There are several subtypes of endometrioid adenocarcinoma with similar prognoses, including villoglandular, secretory, and ciliated cell variants. There is also a subtype characterized by squamous differentiation. Some endometrioid adenocarcinomas have foci of mucinous carcinoma.|$|E
5|$|Individuals with AS {{often have}} {{excellent}} auditory and visual perception. Children with ASD often demonstrate enhanced perception of small changes <b>in</b> <b>patterns</b> such as arrangements of objects or well-known images; typically this is domain-specific and involves processing of fine-grained features. Conversely, compared with individuals with high-functioning autism, individuals with AS have deficits in some tasks involving visual-spatial perception, auditory perception, or visual memory. Many accounts {{of individuals with}} AS and ASD report other unusual sensory and perceptual skills and experiences. They may be unusually sensitive or insensitive to sound, light, and other stimuli; these sensory responses are found in other developmental disorders and are not specific to AS or to ASD. There is little support for increased fight-or-flight response or failure of habituation in autism; there is more evidence of decreased responsiveness to sensory stimuli, although several studies show no differences.|$|E

5|$|The second type, {{triggered}} by entering giant rings found in secret passages, involves running around a 3D map and passing {{through all of}} a number of blue spheres arranged <b>in</b> <b>patterns.</b> Passing through a blue sphere turns it red, and touching a red sphere causes the player to leave the stage, unless the player has just completed a cycle around an arrangement of blue spheres, in which case all of these spheres turn to harmless rings. Removing all of the blue spheres gives the player a Chaos Emerald; if Sonic (not Tails) collects all seven, he can become Super Sonic at will, which makes him invincible to most obstacles. Failing to collect the seven Chaos Emeralds triggers a post-credits scene in which Robotnik and Knuckles taunt the player.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{technologies}} in use {{to achieve the}} flashing effect. These include flashing a light bulb or LED, flashing or rotating halogen, and strobe lights, which are usually brighter than incandescent lights. Each of these can be programmed to flash singly or in groups, and can be programmed to flash <b>in</b> <b>patterns</b> (such as a left -> right pattern for use when the ambulance is parked on the left hand side of the road, indicating to other road users that they should move to the right (away from the ambulance)). Incandescent and LED lights may also be programmed to burn steadily, without flashing, which is required in some provinces.|$|E
5|$|Increasing {{contacts}} with England after the Union of 1707 {{led to a}} conscious attempt to improve agriculture among the gentry and nobility. The Society of Improvers was founded in 1723, including in its 300 members dukes, earls, lairds and landlords. Haymaking was introduced along with the English plough and foreign grasses, the sowing of rye grass and clover. Turnips and cabbages were introduced, lands enclosed and marshes drained, lime was put down, roads built and woods planted. Drilling and sowing and crop rotation were introduced. The introduction of the potato to Scotland in 1739 greatly improved the diet of the peasantry. Enclosures began to displace the run rig system and free pasture. New farm buildings, often based on designs <b>in</b> <b>patterns</b> books, replaced the fermtoun and regional diversity was replaced with a standardisation of building forms. Smaller farms retained the linear outline of the longhouse, with dwelling house, barn and byre in a row, but in larger farms a three- or four-sided layout became common, separating the dwelling house from barns and servants quarters. There was increasing regional specialisation. The Lothians became a major centre of grain, Ayrshire of cattle breading and the Borders of sheep. However, although some estate holders improved {{the quality of life}} of their displaced workers, enclosures led to unemployment and forced migrations to the burghs or abroad.|$|E
