Results In the presented study, infusion of CCK- 8 at physiological concentration combining with conditional training significantly increased the CRD-induced CPA scores, and <b>enhanced</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> affective memory retention. In contrast, CCK had no effect on CPA induced by non-nociceptive aversive stimulus (U 69, 593). The physiological implications were further strengthened by the similar effects observed in the rats with duodenal infusion of 5 % peptone, which has been shown to induce increases in plasma CCK levels. CCK- 8 receptor antagonist CR- 1409 or perivagal application of capsaicin abolished the effect of CCK on aversive visceral pain memory, which was consistent with the notion that vagal afferent modulates affective aspects of visceral pain. CCK does not change the nociceptive response (visceral pain sensitivity) and anterior cingulate cortex neuronal responses to CRD. Conclusion CCK activating vagal afferent C fibers enhances memory consolidation and retention involved in long-term visceral negative affective state. Thus, in a number of gastrointestinal disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome, nutrient content may contribute to painful visceral perception by enhancing visceral aversive memory via acts on vagal afferent pathway. </p...|$|E

50|$|On {{the other}} hand, there are analgesics that are {{commonly}} associated with anti-inflammatory drugs but that have no anti-inflammatory effects. An example is paracetamol (known as acetaminophen or Tylenol in the U.S). As opposed to NSAIDs, which reduce pain and inflammation by inhibiting COX enzymes, paracetamol has - as early as 2006 - been shown to block the reuptake of endocannabinoids, which only reduces pain, likely explaining why it has minimal effect on inflammation; paracetamol is sometimes combined with an NSAID (in place of an opioid) in clinical practice to <b>enhance</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> relief of <b>the</b> NSAID while still receiving the injury/disease modulating effect of NSAID-induced inflammation reduction (which is not received from opioid/paracetamol combinations).|$|R
5|$|Amphetamine {{stimulates the}} {{medullary}} respiratory centers, producing faster and deeper breaths. In {{a normal person}} at therapeutic doses, this effect is usually not noticeable, but when respiration is already compromised, it may be evident. Amphetamine also induces contraction in the urinary bladder sphincter, the muscle which controls urination, which can result in difficulty urinating. This effect {{can be useful in}} treating bed wetting and loss of bladder control. The effects of amphetamine on the gastrointestinal tract are unpredictable. If intestinal activity is high, amphetamine may reduce gastrointestinal motility (the rate at which content moves through the digestive system); however, amphetamine may increase motility when the smooth muscle of the tract is relaxed. Amphetamine also has a slight analgesic effect and can <b>enhance</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> relieving effects of opioids.|$|R
40|$|The potent {{analgesic}} {{effects of}} cannabis-like drugs 1 - 4 {{and the presence}} of CB 1 -type cannabinoid receptors in pain-processing areas of the brain and spinal cord 5, 6 indicate that endogenous cannabinoids such as anandamide 7 may contribute to <b>the</b> control of <b>pain</b> transmission within <b>the</b> central nervous system (CNS) 8. Here we show that anandamide attenuates <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> behaviour produced by chemical damage to cutaneous tissue by interacting with CB 1 -like cannabinoid receptors located outside the CNS. Palmitylethanolamide (PEA), which is released together with anandamide from a common phospholipid precursor 9, exerts a similar effect by activating peripheral CB 2 -like receptors. When administered together, the two compounds act synergistically, reducing pain responses 100 -fold more potently than does each compound alone. Gas-chromatography/mass-spectrometry measurements indicate that the levels of anandamide and PEA in the skin are enough to cause a tonic activation of local cannabinoid receptors. In agreement with this possibility, the CB 1 antagonist SR 141716 A and the CB 2 antagonist SR 144528 prolong and <b>enhance</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> behaviour produced by tissue damage. These results indicate that peripheral CB 1 -like and CB 2 -like receptors participate in the intrinsic control of pain initiation and that locally generated anandamide and PA may mediate this effect...|$|R

40|$|AIM: To {{observe the}} {{analgesic}} effects of moxibustion in rats with chronic visceral hyperalgesia {{and its influence}} on the concentration of dynorphin (Dyn) and endomorphin (EM) in spinal cord. METHODS: The rat model of chronic visceral hyperalgesia was established by colorectal distention (CRD). In moxibustion (MX) group, moxibustion was applied once daily for 7 d; in sham moxibustion (SM) group, moxibustion {{was given to the}} same acupoints but with the non-smoldered end of the moxa stick. Model control (MC) group and normal control group were also studied. The scoring system of abdominal withdrawal reflex was used to evaluate visceral pain for behavioral assessment. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay was performed to determine the concentrations of Dyn and EM in spinal cord. RESULTS: Moxibustion significantly decreased visceral pain to CRD in this rat model, and no significant difference was detected between the SM group and the MC group. In MX group, moxibustion also increased the concentrations of Dyn and EM in spinal cord, and no significant difference was found between the SM group and the MC group.

40|$|Introduction: A burn injury causes pain {{which leads}} to {{decreased}} use and loss of function. Pain and decreased function are themselves distressing and when excessive may impede healing of the burn. Hyperalgesia will <b>enhance</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> experience and may contribute to avoidant behaviours. Primary hyperalgesia is driven largely by local tissue events; however central nervous system changes appear to contribute strongly to secondary hyperalgesia. Within days, neural system changes such as reorganization of the cortical representation of the injured area can occur. Such cortical re-organization {{has been linked to}} hypersensitivity and {{may play a role in}} the development of ongoing pain states. This study investigates a cortical training programme (CTr), which addresses both motor and sensory representation of the injured area. The aim is to minimise the cortical consequences of the acute burn and possibly influence <b>the</b> development chronic <b>pain.</b> Evidence for <b>the</b> use of a cortical training approach are found in other clinical populations such as chronic regional pain syndrome and phantom limb pain. Objective: This prospective randomized pilot trial will investigate the efficacy and feasibility of CTr in acute upper limb burns (AULB). Method: Patients with minor AULB are randomized to control (usual care) or intervention (usual care + CTr) groups. Patients receive treatment during regular outpatient clinic attendance as well as a comprehensive home programme. Outcome measures: QuickDASH, Pain Detect Measure, Modified Tampa Scale of Kinesophobia, Pain self-efficacy questionnaire, Post-traumatic checklist, hand laterality.

40|$|Spinal cord {{stimulation}} (SCS) is {{an effective}} surgical treatment for neuropathic pain refractory to pharmacological therapy. For many patients suffering from this type of chronic pain, SCS {{is in fact the}} ultimate treatment option. However, 30 to 40 percent of well selected patients fail to obtain useful pain relief with SCS, and in some patients an initial good analgesic effect diminishes over time. Therefore, the need to improve the efficacy of SCS in these patients, prompted us to perform experimental research in order to advance the comprehension of the underlying mechanisms of SCS and further, to apply this knowledge clinically in order to develop new therapeutic strategies. When SCS is applied to the dorsal columns, multiple neuronal networks may be activated and several neurotransmitters are released in the spinal dorsal horn. This neuronal response to SCS may be regarded as equivalent to in situ drug delivery to the spinal cord in physiological amounts. The present thesis provides evidence that the analgesic effect of SCS partially relies on the activation of the cholinergic system because stimulation applied in rats with nerve injury produces a release of acetylcholine (ACh) in the dorsal horn. This effect occurred only in rats that in preceding experiments have been found to respond to SCS. It was also demonstrated that the SCS effect on signs of neuropathy was mediated via the activation of muscarinic, particularly M 4, receptors. Intrathecal clonidine, a partial α 2 receptor agonist, has proven to be an effective drug for both neuropathic and nociceptive pain. It is known that its analgesic action is in part related to an augmented spinal release of ACh, binding mainly to M 4 receptors. In this thesis it was demonstrated that in nerve injured rats, concurrent administration of clonidine and SCS may potentiate the suppressive effect of SCS on mechanical hypersensitivity. In a previous experimental study, it was shown that the administration of subeffective doses of a GABAB receptor agonist, baclofen, may <b>enhance</b> <b>the</b> effect of SCS. It is now demonstrated that also two anticonvulsants, gabapentin and pregabalin, in low and by themselves ineffective doses, may potentiate the suppressive effect of SCS on signs of neuropathy in rats. On the basis of these experimental studies, a double-blind, placebocontrolled clinical trial was performed, demonstrating that clonidine and baclofen in low intrathecal doses may <b>enhance</b> <b>the</b> analgesic effect of SCS in neuropathic pain, improving also quality of life. A long-term follow-up of a group of patients with combined SCS and baclofen treatment revealed that they still enjoyed good <b>pain</b> relief. <b>The</b> present studies contribute {{to the understanding of the}} mode of action of SCS and it provides a new therapeutic option to <b>enhance</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> relieving effect of SCS by concomitant administration of low doses of intrathecal drugs for patients who obtain insufficient analgesia by SCS alone.

40|$|The chemokines use G protein-coupled receptors to {{regulate}} the migratory and proadhesive responses of leukocytes. Based on observations that G protein-coupled receptors undergo heterologous desensitization, we have examined the ability of chemokines to also influence <b>the</b> perception of <b>pain</b> by cross-desensitizing opioid G protein-coupled receptors function in vitro and in vivo. We find that the chemotactic activities of both μ- and δ-opioid receptors are desensitized following activation of the chemokine receptors CCR 5, CCR 2, CCR 7, and CXCR 4 but not of the CXCR 1 or CXCR 2 receptors. Furthermore, we also find that pretreatment with RANTES/CCL 5, the ligand for CCR 1, and CCR 5 or SDF- 1 α/CXCL 12, the ligand for CXCR 4, followed by opioid administration into the periaqueductal gray matter of the brain results in an increased rat tail flick response to a painful stimulus. Because chemokine administration into the periaqueductal gray matter inhibits opioid-induced analgesia, we propose that the activation of proinflammatory chemokine receptors down-regulates the analgesic functions of opioid receptors, and this <b>enhances</b> <b>the</b> perception of <b>pain</b> at inflammatory sites...|$|R

These overactivations occurred predominantly within the high theta (6 - 9 Hz) and low beta frequency ranges (12 - 16 Hz). Theta and beta overactivations were localized to multiple pain-associated areas, primarily to insular (IC), anterior cingulate (ACC), prefrontal, and inferior posterior parietal cortices, as well as to primary (S 1), secondary (S 2), and supplementary somatosensory (SSA) cortices.

40|$|Nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs) {{act upon}} peripheral tissues and upon {{the central nervous}} system to produce analgesia. A major central target of NSAIDs is <b>the</b> descending <b>pain</b> control system. <b>The</b> rostral structures of <b>the</b> descending <b>pain</b> control system send impulses towards the spinal cord and regulate <b>the</b> transmission of <b>pain</b> messages. Key structures of <b>the</b> descending <b>pain</b> control system are the periaqueductal gray matter (PAG) and the rostral ventromedial region of the medulla (RVM), both of which are critical targets for endogenous opioids and opiate pharmaceuticals. NSAIDs also act upon PAG and RVM to produce analgesia and, if repeatedly administered, induce tolerance to themselves and cross-tolerance to opioids. Experimental evidence shows that this is due to an interaction of NSAIDs with endogenous opioids along <b>the</b> descending <b>pain</b> control system. Analgesia by NSAIDs along <b>the</b> descending <b>pain</b> control system also requires an activation of the CB 1 endocannabinoid receptor. Several experimental approaches suggest that opioids, NSAIDs and cannabinoids in PAG and RVM cooperate to decrease GABAergic inhibition and thus <b>enhance</b> <b>the</b> descending flow of impulses that inhibit pain...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> {{idea that}} <b>pain</b> {{may serve to}} produce pleasurable states has been noted by theorists and, more recently, {{substantiated}} by empirical findings. We explored the possibility that, beyond producing positive hedonic states, <b>the</b> offset of <b>pain</b> may serve to <b>enhance</b> <b>the</b> capacity for gustatory pleasure. Across three studies we examined whether pain offset may enhance responsiveness to taste. In Study 1 participants enjoyed chocolate more after <b>the</b> experience of <b>pain</b> compared to completing a similar but non-painful task. In Study 2, <b>pain</b> offset increased <b>the</b> perceived intensity {{of a range of}} tastes, both pleasant and unpleasant, indicating that <b>the</b> effects of <b>pain</b> offset are not limited to the processing of positive hedonic stimuli. In Study 3, pain offset increased sensitivity to different flavors. The findings suggest that the offset of acute pain increases awareness of, and therefore sensitivity to, gustatory input, thereby <b>enhancing</b> <b>the</b> capacity for gustatory pleasure.

40|$|Pain {{is one of}} {{the first}} {{symptoms}} that alert you to the various diseases. It affects and reduces the quality of patient?s life and their physical, mental and emotional abilities. It depends on man how feels <b>the</b> <b>pain,</b> how succumbs to it or how much affects him. But <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> cannot be clearly quantified. The medical staffs often underestimate patient´s intensity, character and process of pain. As a result, the patients are more reserved in relation to the medical staffs. Unfortunately, there is an increase of dissatisfaction which is in conflict with the progress of their treatment. And there should be the nurses for contact with patients when they want it. Especially the nurses are the mediator between the patient and the doctor; thereby they perform the important roles in the health care centres. On the other hand, the patient care is very difficult. Therefore it was important to determine the quantity of nurse´s work in <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> management institutions, particularly <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> management clinics, an affect their psyche, an attitude to patients, their view of <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> management institutions, including information about <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> management clinics processing, the methods and the provided care. There were determined six aims: to find out the most common diagnosis and methods of <b>pain</b> treatment in <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> management institutions, as well as how nurses perceive the patients and care for their mental status in <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> management clinics, <b>the</b> daily routines which the nurses recommend to the patients and finally find out information about <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> management institutions in the Czech Republic. Based on the aims there were determined six research questions. Firstly, what is the most common diagnosis in <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> management clinic? Secondly, what are the most common methods for pain treatment? Thirdly, how are successful <b>the</b> methods of <b>pain</b> treatment by nurses?

40|$|Ingestion of {{amniotic fluid}} or {{placenta}} by rats {{has been shown}} to enhance several types of opioid-mediated analgesia: that induced by morphine, footshock, vaginal/cervical stimulation, and late pregnancy. This enhancement has also been blocked by administration of opioid antagonists. The present study was designed to examine further the specificity of the enhancement effect for opioid-mediated analgesia by testing for enhancement following administration of aspirin, a nonopioid analgesic. The formalin test was used as <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> threshold assay. Amniotic fluid or beef bouillon was administered by orogastric tube to rats that were treated either with morphine sulfate or saline. or pretreated with naltrexone, then treated with aspirin or vehicle. Both morphine and aspirin treatments produced analgesia. Amniotic fluid significantly <b>enhanced</b> <b>the</b> analgesia produced by morphine, but did not <b>enhance</b> <b>the</b> analgesia produced by aspirin, further suggesting that <b>the</b> <b>enhancing</b> effect of amniotic fluid ingestion is specific for opioid-mediated analgesia, such as that existing at the start of parturition...|$|R
