40|$|The flow in a <b>horizontal</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>bulb</b> turbine is {{calculated}} as a two-phase flow with a commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD-) -code including cavitation model. The results are compared with experimental results achieved at a closed loop test rig for model turbines. On the model test rig, {{for a certain}} operating point (i. e. volume flow, net head, blade angle, guide vane opening) the pressure behind the turbine is lowered (i. e. the Thomacoefficient s is lowered) and {{the efficiency of the}} turbine is recorded. The measured values can be depicted in a so-called s?break curve or h-s?diagram. Usually, the efficiency is independent of the Thoma-coefficient up to a certain value. When lowering the Thoma-coefficient below this value the efficiency will drop rapidly. Visual observations of the different cavitation conditions complete the experiment. In analogy, several calculations are done for different Thoma-coefficients s and the corresponding hydraulic losses of the runner are evaluated quantitatively. Besides, the fraction of water vapour as an indication {{of the size of the}} cavitation cavity is analyzed qualitatively. The experimentally and the numerically obtained results are compared and show a good agreement. Especially the drop in efficiency can be calculated with satisfying accuracy. This drop in efficiency is of high practical importance since it is one criterion to determine the admissible cavitation in a bulbturbine. The visual impression of the cavitation in the CFDanalysis is well in accordance with the observed cavitation bubbles recorded on sketches and/or photographs...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, the {{commercial}} 3 D Navier-Stokes CFD-solver Ansys CFX {{was used to}} investigate the flow through a <b>horizontal</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>bulb</b> turbine in a stationary and transient way. The draft tube {{is one of the}} most critical parts for the performance of bulb turbines and highly influences the efficiency of the whole configuration with a level of several percent of the total efficiency. A calculation of the existing situation was the basis for a modification and adaptation of the draft tube geometry to realize a shorter machine construction and also to compare the results with hydraulic model tests from a closed loop turbine test stand. For all influences on the draft tube rotor stator effects are decisive – in reality as well as in numerical simulations. In a first part, several modifications were analyzed, e. g. inlet variations, as those cause different space requirements of the generator as far as the flow rate is concerned, the operating points differ more than 300 %. For the flow through the runner the meridional velocity was analyzed on 5 different planes around the runner. In front and also after the runner the flow over the radius was nearly on an equal level – this means that the hydraulic is good and that no fluid transport in radial direction is needed. In a second part, an investigation of different influences of rotor stator interactions was carried out, based on a large full 360 °-model of the whole machine configuration of this 3 -blade runner and 16 guide vane turbine. The simulations were done after tests with different grids, turbulence models, grid interfaces and settings. To compare the simulation results with experimental test results, the histogram pressure method for the sigma calculation developed by the Astroetea...|$|R

50|$|Small {{turbines}} (mostly under 10 MW) {{may have}} <b>horizontal</b> <b>shafts,</b> and even fairly large bulb-type turbines up to 100 MW or so may be horizontal. Very large Francis and Kaplan machines usually have vertical shafts because this makes {{best use of}} the available head, and makes installation of a generator more economical. Pelton wheels may be either vertical or <b>horizontal</b> <b>shaft</b> machines because {{the size of the}} machine is so much less than the available head. Some impulse turbines use multiple jets per runner to balance shaft thrust. This also allows for the use of a smaller turbine runner, which can decrease costs and mechanical losses.|$|R
