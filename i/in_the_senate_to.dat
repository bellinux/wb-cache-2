5|$|Letcher {{supported}} Adams' administration, {{but became}} anti-administration when Jackson won the 1828 presidential contest. Consistent with {{his support of}} Clay, he promoted expansion of internal improvements, including the Maysville Road bill vetoed by Jackson. In 1833, Clay proposed a compromise <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>to</b> quell the Nullification Crisis; Letcher introduced Clay's compromise in the House.|$|E
5|$|Flanders {{was noted}} for {{introducing}} a 1954 motion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>to</b> censure Senator Joseph McCarthy. McCarthy had made sensational claims {{that there were}} large numbers of Communists and Soviet spies and sympathizers inside {{the federal government and}} elsewhere. He used his Senate committee as a nationally televised forum for attacks on individuals whom he accused. Flanders felt that McCarthy’s attacks distracted the nation from a much greater threat of Communist successes elsewhere in the world and that they had the effect of creating division and confusion within the United States, to the advantage of its enemies. Ultimately, McCarthy's tactics and his inability to substantiate his claims led to his being discredited and censured by the United States Senate.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, {{he became}} the longest-serving senator from Oregon, surpassing the record of 9,726days in office {{previously}} held by Charles McNary. In 1995, Hatfield was the only Republican <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>to</b> vote against the proposed balanced budget amendment, and was the deciding vote that prevented {{the passage of the}} bill.

Jefferson also displaced two district judgesRay Greene and Jacob Readciting technical {{flaws in}} their appointments. Further, District Judge John Pickering was impeached and {{removed from office}} on a party-line vote. The following day, the House impeached Justice Samuel Chase, but six Democratic-Republicans crossed party lines <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>to</b> prevent his conviction by a single vote.|$|E
5|$|The {{reign of}} the first four kings was {{distinct}} {{from that of the}} last three kings. The first kings were elected. Between the reigns of the final three kings, however, the monarchy became hereditary, and as such, the senate became subordinated to the king. This breach in the senate's sovereignty, rather than an intolerable tyranny, was probably what led the Patricians <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>senate</b> <b>to</b> overthrow the last king. The king may have sought the support of the Plebeians; however, the Plebeians were no doubt exhausted from their continued military service, and from their forced labor in the construction of public works. They were probably also embittered by their lack of political power, and therefore did not come to the aide of either the king or the senate.|$|E
25|$|Burr's {{farewell}} {{speech in}} March 1805 moved {{some of his}} harshest critics <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>to</b> tears.

25|$|In 1990, Feinstein made an {{unsuccessful}} bid for Governor of California.

25|$|During {{his time}} as governor, Gray {{accomplished}} very little, as {{there were only three}} months remaining in the term. Gray and Landers lost the election, and Gray attempted one last move to stay in public office. He was able to use his friends <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>to</b> have his name entered as the Democratic candidate for Senator in 1881, but was defeated in the vote 8162. He then returned to his law practice, but attempted a run for governor again in 1884 at the Democratic convention. By then, resistance to him had dissipated somewhat, and he won the nomination.|$|E

Both González and Rios expressed their lack of concern over the reprimand and were handily renominated in the March 2008 primary and reelected in the November 2008 general election.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of August 7, 1974, Senators Barry Goldwater and Hugh Scott and Congressman John Jacob Rhodes met with Nixon in the Oval Office. Scott and Rhodes were the Republican leaders in the Senate and House, respectively; Goldwater was brought along as an elder statesman. The three lawmakers told Nixon that his support in Congress had all but disappeared. Rhodes told Nixon that he would face certain {{impeachment}} when the articles came up for vote in the full House. Goldwater and Scott told the president that there were enough votes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>to</b> convict him, and that no more than 15 Senators were willing to vote for acquittal.|$|E
25|$|J. G. Strijdom, {{known as}} the Lion of the North, worked to {{restrict}} Coloured rights. He removed their ability to exercise their franchise. Strijdom's government expanded the number of Senate seats from 48 to 89. All of the additional 41 members hailed from the National Party. It increased its representation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>to</b> 77 in total. The Appellate Division Quorum Bill {{increased the number of}} judges necessary for constitutional decisions in the Appeal Court from five to eleven. Strijdom, knowing that he had his two-thirds majority, held a joint sitting of parliament in May 1956. The entrenchment clause regarding the Coloured vote, {{known as the}} South African Act, was amended.|$|E

25|$|Miller {{established}} himself as a conservative on virtually all economic issues. He was the first Democrat <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>to</b> publicly declare his support for the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, a broad-based tax cut which was criticized by opponents for favoring the rich and being fiscally irresponsible. Miller was the only Democrat to vote against an amendment to that same bill submitted by Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) to scale back portions of that tax cut in order to spend more on education and debt reduction. He strongly opposed the estate tax and voted a number of times for its repeal. He also advocated drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.|$|E
25|$|The Act also limited {{debate over}} {{discharge}} petitions (to bring concurrent resolutions out of committee {{and onto the}} floor for a vote) to one hour, and debate on concurrent resolutions themselves to 10 hours. The Act required a simple majority vote <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>to</b> approve a concurrent resolution on any reorganization plan. The Act did not authorize the establishment of any new executive branch agency, banned the abolition of any such agency, and exempted 21 independent agencies, boards, commissions, and departments (including the Comptroller General of the United States and the Government Accounting Office) from reorganization. It also denied the president the power to use reorganization authority to extend the life or functions of any agency beyond the period authorized by law.|$|E
25|$|As in all Australian elections, {{the flow}} of {{preferences}} from minor parties can be crucial in determining the final outcome. The close of nominations {{was followed by a}} period of bargaining among the parties. Howard made a pitch for the preferences of the Australian Greens by appearing to offer concessions on the issue of logging in old-growth forests in Tasmania, and the Coalition directed its preferences to the Greens ahead of Labor in the Senate, but the Greens nevertheless decided to allocate preferences to Labor in most electorates. In exchange, Labor agreed to direct its preferences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>to</b> the Greens ahead of the Democrats (but critically, not ahead of other minor parties), increasing the chances that the Greens would displace Australian Democrats Senators in New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia.|$|E

25|$|Johnson was {{appointed}} to the Senate Armed Services Committee, and later in 1950, he helped create the Preparedness Investigating Subcommittee. Johnson became its chairman and conducted investigations of defense costs and efficiency. These investigations revealed old investigations and demanded actions that were already being taken in part by the Truman Administration, although {{it can be said that}} the committee's investigations reinforced the need for changes. Johnson gained headlines and national attention through his handling of the press, the efficiency with which his committee issued new reports, and the fact that he ensured that every report was endorsed unanimously by the committee. Johnson used his political influence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>to</b> receive broadcast licenses from the Federal Communications Commission in his wife's name. After the 1950 general elections, Johnson was chosen as Senate Majority Whip in 1951 under the new Majority Leader, Ernest McFarland of Arizona, and served from 1951 to 1953.|$|E
25|$|Arriving on Coruscant, Padmé consults with Senator Palpatine, who {{encourages}} her {{to appeal}} to the Senate to resolve Naboo's dispute with the Trade Federation.

(She is unaware that he is in fact the Sith lord Darth Sidious, and is responsible for the crisis.) Padmé returns to Naboo to fight for her planet's freedom, enlisting the aid of Jar Jar Binks's Gungan warriors and having the handmaiden Sabé pose as her. As Sabé attempts a peace deal between Naboo and the Gungans, Padmé intervenes and reveals her true identity. The Gungans agree to help and offer a diversion to lure the droid armies away from the palace. Once in the palace, Padmé's forces storm the throne room and capture the Viceroy, ending the trade blockade of Naboo once and for all. A celebration is held to announce the unity between Naboo and the Gungans.|$|E
25|$|President Grant was livid at the treaty's {{failure to}} pass the Senate and blamed Sen. Sumner's {{opposition}} for the defeat; Grant having believed Sumner had originally agreed to support the treaty at their January 2, 1870 meeting. Grant then retaliated by firing U.S. Ambassador to Britain, John Lothrop Motley, Sen. Sumner's close friend. Then in March 1871, President Grant having influence in the Senate got his allied Senators to remove Sumner as Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. President Grant {{was able to get}} Congress to allow an investigation Commission to be sent and make an objective assessment as to whether annexation would be beneficial to both the United States and the Dominican Republic. The Commission, sent in 1871, included civil rights activist Frederick Douglass and reported favorably on the annexation of the Dominican Republic to the United States. The Commission, however, failed to generate enough enthusiasm <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>to</b> overcome opposition to Dominican Republic annexation. The whole affair never took into account the wishes of the Dominican people who desired to remain independent.|$|E
