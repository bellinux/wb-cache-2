40|$|Abstract — We {{propose a}} real-time, direct monocular SLAM method for {{omnidirectional}} or wide field-of-view fisheye cam-eras. Both tracking (<b>direct</b> image <b>alignment)</b> and mapping (pixel-wise distance filtering) are directly formulated for the unified omnidirectional model, which can model central imaging devices with {{a field of}} view well above 150 ◦. This is {{in stark contrast to}} existing direct mono-SLAM approaches like DTAM or LSD-SLAM, which operate on rectified images, limiting the field of view to well below 180 ◦. Not only does this allow to observe – and reconstruct – a larger portion of the surrounding environment, but it also makes the system more robust to degenerate (rotation-only) movement. The two main contribution are (1) the formulation of <b>direct</b> image <b>alignment</b> for the unified omnidirectional model, and (2) a fast yet accurate approach to incremental stereo directly on distorted images. We evaluated our framework on real-world sequences taken with a 185 ◦ fish-eye lens, and compare it to a rectified and a piecewise rectified approach...|$|R

This work shows that neural networks can be used to produce robust sequencers.

The long-range objective is to use neural networks to automate the alignment and operation of optical measurement systems in remote, harsh, or dangerous aerospace environments. This work also shows that when neural networks are trained by a human operator, training sets should be recorded, training should be executed, and testing should be done in a manner that does not depend on intellectual judgments of the human operator...|$|R
