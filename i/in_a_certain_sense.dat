Akshaya is a female character {{with a firm}} personality, and belongs to the band although she often acts as an antepole in regard to Costello. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>sense</b> she represents the matriarchal form of governance by daring to disagree with the alpha and making her own decisions.|$|E
5|$|The homological mirror {{symmetry}} conjecture of Maxim Kontsevich {{states that}} the derived category of coherent sheaves on one Calabi–Yau manifold is equivalent <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>sense</b> to the Fukaya category of its mirror. This equivalence provides a precise mathematical formulation of mirror symmetry in topological string theory. In addition, it provides an unexpected bridge between two branches of geometry, namely complex and symplectic geometry.|$|E
25|$|Like intuitionism, constructivism {{involves}} the regulative principle that only mathematical entities {{which can be}} explicitly constructed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>sense</b> should be admitted to mathematical discourse. In this view, mathematics is an exercise of the human intuition, not a game played with meaningless symbols. Instead, it is about entities that we can create directly through mental activity. In addition, some adherents of these schools reject non-constructive proofs, such as a proof by contradiction.|$|E

25|$|For most {{applications}} {{a special}} kind of topological manifold, namely a differentiable manifold, is used. If the local charts on a manifold are compatible <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>sense,</b> one can define directions, tangent spaces, and differentiable functions on that manifold. In particular it is possible to use calculus on a differentiable manifold. Each point of an n-dimensional differentiable manifold has a tangent space. This is an n-dimensional Euclidean space consisting of the tangent vectors of the curves through the point.|$|E
25|$|The Byzantines had slowly been {{creeping}} eastward towards Armenia in {{the final}} decade of the 10th century. Emperor Basil II's numerous victories against the Arabs and internal Arab struggles helped clear a path towards the Caucasus. Constantinople's official policy was that no Christian ruler is equal to or independent of the Byzantine emperor, {{and even if it}} was at time masked with diplomatic compromises, the empire's ultimate goal was the complete annexation of the Armenian realms. By the middle of the 10th century, the Byzantine Empire lay along the full length of the western border of Armenia. Taron was the first Armenian region annexed by the Byzantine Empire. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>sense,</b> the Byzantines considered the Bagratuni princes of Taron as their vassals, for they had consistently accepted titles, such as that of strategos, and stipends from Constantinople. With the death of Ashot Bagratuni of Taron in 967 (not to be confused with Ashot III), his sons Gregory and Bagrat were not able to withstand the pressure from the empire, which annexed their principality outright and converted it to a theme.|$|E

500|$|Indeed, the {{computation}} of Taylor series {{requires the}} knowledge of the function on an arbitrary small neighbourhood of a point, whereas the computation of the Fourier series requires knowing the function on its whole domain interval. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>sense</b> one could say that the Taylor series is [...] "local" [...] and the Fourier series is [...] "global".|$|E
500|$|According to the {{historian}} Matthew Gordon, Ibn Tulun's relations with, and quest for autonomy from, the Abbasids is a [...] "central problem of Tulunid history". Modern scholars see in Ibn Tulun's policies a [...] "careful balancing act" [...] and {{notice that he}} never fully severed himself from the Caliphate, remaining conspicuously loyal to the person of al-Mu'tamid, who, after all, was a powerless figurehead. Nevertheless, the move towards increasing autonomy is evident throughout his reign. His relations with the Abbasid government were dominated by his conflict with al-Muwaffaq, resulting from the latter's attempts to establish control over Egypt—whose wealth was direly needed during the costly war against the Zanj—and prevent the further rise of Ibn Tulun. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>sense,</b> writes Matthew Gordon, many of Ibn Tulun's measures [...] "were as much {{the means by which}} imperial interests were protected against the ambitions of al-Muwaffaq and his (largely Turkish) military coterie in Iraq as they were efforts to secure Tulunid authority". Given that Ibn Tulun at least twice (in 871 and 875/6) remitted huge sums to the caliphal treasury, it remains an open question whether without the conflict with al-Muwaffaq, this would have been a more regular occurrence.|$|E

500|$|According to the {{response}} by Robert van Voren, Pekhterev {{in his article}} condescendingly argues that the Serbsky Institute was not so bad place and that Nekipelov exaggerates and slanders it, but Pekhterev, by doing so, misses the main point: living conditions in the Serbsky Institute were not bad, those who passed through psychiatric examination there were <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>sense</b> [...] "on holiday" [...] {{in comparison with the}} living conditions of the Gulag; and all the same, everyone was aware that the Serbsky Institute was more than the [...] "gates of hell" [...] from where people were sent to specialized psychiatric hospitals in Chernyakhovsk, Dnepropetrovsk, Kazan, Blagoveshchensk, and that is not all. Their life was transformed to unimaginable horror with daily tortures by forced administration of drugs, beatings and other forms of punishment. Many went crazy, could not endure what was happening to them, some even died during the [...] "treatment" [...] (for example, a miner from Donetsk Alexey Nikitin). Many books and memoirs are written about the life in the psychiatric Gulag and every time when reading them a shiver seizes us. The Soviet psychiatric terror in its brutality and targeting the mentally ill as the most vulnerable group of society had nothing on the Nazi euthanasia programs. The punishment by placement in a mental hospital was as effective as imprisonment in Mordovian concentration camps in breaking persons psychologically and physically. The recent history of the USSR should be given a wide publicity to immunize society against possible repetitions of the Soviet practice of political abuse of psychiatry. The issue remains highly relevant.|$|E
500|$|The Chinese warlord General Henry Chang (Warner Oland) in the 1932 film Shanghai Express, who is {{presented}} as being not only as Eurasian, but as having a menacing asexuality that places him outside of the conventionally defined world of Western sexuality and racial order, making him as dangerous to the Western characters who he has taken hostage {{as much as the}} fact that he is a vicious warlord. Though Chang is Eurasian, he takes pride in his Chinese heritage while rejecting his American heritage, which confirms his Eastern identity. War-torn China, circa 1931 {{is presented}} as a [...] "hell", which a diverse group of Westerners must travel through on a nightmarish train trip from Beijing to Shanghai, which takes a turn for the worse when the train is hijacked by Chang and his men. The film strongly hints that Chang is bisexual, who not only wants to rape the heroine Shanghai Lily (Marlene Dietrich), but also the hero Captain Donald [...] "Doc" [...] Harvey (Clive Brook). When the German opium smuggler Erich Baum (Gustav von Seyffertitz) insults Chang, the result is a scene where the warlord commits a symbolic rape, as the sadistic Chang clearly takes sexual pleasure in branding Baum with a red-hot poker. After he is branded (the symbol of slavery), the once proud Baum becomes notably cowed and submissive towards Chang who <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>sense</b> now [...] "owes" [...] him , which reflected the ultimate Yellow Peril fear of Westerners becoming the slaves of the East and its perverted sexuality. Later on, Chang does actually rape Hui Fei (Anna May Wong). Gina Marchetti suggests that Chang's desire to blind Harvey is not only meant literally, but is also a metaphor for castration, which even under the more permissive Production code in effect in 1932 would have been a taboo subject. In a marked contrast to Chang's twisted sexuality and his [...] "almost effeminate polish" [...] , the British Army Captain Harvey is a resolutely heterosexual, ruggedly tough soldier with a deep romantic streak who more than amply proved his manliness in the trenches of World War I, presenting a model of Western masculinity and strength.|$|E
