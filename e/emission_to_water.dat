40|$|An {{inventory}} of chromium emission {{into the atmosphere}} and water from anthropogenic activities in China was compiled for 1990 through to 2009. We estimate that the total emission of chromium to the atmosphere is about 1. 92 × 10 ⁵ t. Coal and oil combustion were the two leading sources of chromium emission to the atmosphere in China, while the contribution of them showed opposite annual growth trend. In total, nearly 1. 34 × 10 ⁴ t of chromium was discharged to water, mainly from six industrial categories in 20 years. Among them, the metal fabrication industry and the leather tanning sector were the dominant sources of chromium emissions, accounting for approximately 68. 0 % and 20. 0 % of the total emissions and representing increases of 15. 6 % and 10. 3 % annually, respectively. The spatial trends of Cr emissions show significant variation based on emissions from 2005 to 2009. The emission to the atmosphere was heaviest in Hebei, Shandong, Guangdong, Zhejiang and Shanxi, whose annual emissions reached more than 1000 t for {{the high level of}} coal and oil consumption. In terms of <b>emission</b> <b>to</b> <b>water,</b> the largest contributors were Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shandong and Zhejiang, where most of the leather production and metal manufacturing occur and these four regions accounted for nearly 47. 4 % of the total <b>emission</b> <b>to</b> <b>water...</b>|$|E

Our environment is being polluted day by day due to rapid industrialization. Today the delicate ecosystem of our planet is facing a danger of destruction on a scale as never before in the history of mankind. Forests are diminishing at an alarming rate, landmasses are getting eroded, climate {{in different parts of the}} world is undergoing a change due to global warming and clean air and water are increasingly becoming rare commodities. So it is high time to be aware and alert about environmental protection which cannot be done without understanding the environmental aspects. Present study tried to explain the significant environmental aspects arising from Indian manufacturing industries by analyzing the data collected through questionnaire survey. It is observed from collected data that emission to air is most significant environmental aspect in Indian manufacturing industries in respect to severity i. e. the effect of this environmental aspect is more harmful for human beings. Noise environmental aspect is having more efficiency, probability and duration, it means this environmental aspect is produced in each and every manufacturing company and affects the environment. <b>Emission</b> <b>to</b> <b>water</b> is second most important environmental aspect with respect to severity, probability and frequency.

40|$|The {{multimedia}} model SimpleTreat, {{evaluates the}} distribution and elimination of chemicals by municipal sewage treatment plants (STP). It is applied {{in the framework of}} REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals). This article describes an adaptation of this model for application to industrial sewage treatment plants (I-STP). The intended use of this re-parametrized model is focused on risk assessment during manufacture and subsequent uses of chemicals, also in the framework of REACH. The results of an inquiry on the operational characteristics of industrial sewage treatment installations were used to re-parameterize the model. It appeared that one property of industrial sewage, i. e. Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) in combination with one parameter of the activated sludge process, the hydraulic retention time (HRT) is satisfactory to define treatment of industrial wastewater by means of the activated sludge process. The adapted model was compared to the original municipal version, SimpleTreat 4. 0, by means of a sensitivity analysis. The consistency of the model output was assessed by computing the <b>emission</b> <b>to</b> <b>water</b> from an I-STP of a set of fictitious chemicals. This set of chemicals exhibit a range of physico-chemical and biodegradability properties occurring in industrial wastewater. Predicted removal rates of a chemical from raw sewage are higher in industrial than in municipal STPs. The latter have typically shorter hydraulic retention times with diminished opportunity for elimination of the chemical due to volatilization and biodegradation...|$|E

Agri-environmental policy and land management practices have, in many areas, reduced nutrient <b>emissions</b> <b>to</b> <b>water.</b> However, additional measures may be required in Ireland to further decouple the relationship between agricultural productivity and <b>emissions</b> <b>to</b> <b>water,</b> which is of vital importance given on-going agricultural intensification. The Source Load Apportionment Model (SLAM) framework characterises sources of phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) <b>emissions</b> <b>to</b> <b>water</b> at a range of scales from sub-catchment to national. The SLAM synthesises land use and physical characteristics <b>to</b> predict <b>emissions</b> from point (wastewater, industry discharges and septic tank systems) and diffuse sources (agriculture, forestry, etc.). The predicted annual nutrient emissions were assessed against monitoring data for 16 major river catchments covering 50 % of the area of Ireland.

40|$|The {{relationships}} of CO 2 <b>emission</b> <b>to</b> <b>water</b> table, peat moisture and humification were studied in a secondary peat swamp forest {{floor at the}} Vodoi National Park, Vietnam. Water table level is artificially maintained high and the forest floor is flooded {{for most of the}} year in order to reduce risks of fire. The lowest water table was at- 30 cm below the peat surface and the moisture of peat above the water table level was at the lowest 70 % w/w (from the 80 % water holding capacity). At these water tables CO 2 release from the peat surface was directly proportional to the water table level. The rate of CO 2 release from peat, excluding plant root respiration, was significantly higher and not clearly dependent on peat moisture content in the less humified topmost 10 cm peat (litter) layer compared to the more humified deeper peat. The highest CO 2 release rate from decomposition and faunal activity was found in the topmost 10 cm litter layer at a moisture content of 67 - 85 % w/w (from the 80 % water holding capacity). The CO 2 release rate below the litter layer was less than 0. 02 mg CO 2 g- 1 h- 1, and this decreased significantly when the water content was < 40 % of the water holding capacity. As the water table level in the forest floor never fell lower than- 30 cm from the ground surface and the moisture of peat above the water table was always above 80 % of water holding capacity, it was concluded that the near surface litter played the major role in CO 2 emission from peat in Vodoi National Park...|$|E

40|$|The EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) {{requires}} {{member states}} to take measures to ensure that bodies of water will be in good chemical and ecological condition by 2015. Important measures {{to achieve this goal}} include reducing emissions of nitrogen (N) and phosphate (P 2 O 5) from manure and mineral fertilizers into the environment. In regions with a high livestock density, this measure is expected to affect agricultural production and income. To quantify these effects, an environmental economic model is required that can assess alternatives capable of reducing N and P 2 O 5 potential <b>emissions</b> <b>to</b> <b>water.</b> In this paper, we develop a model that is capable of analysing changes in potential <b>emissions</b> <b>to</b> <b>water</b> of N and P 2 O 5 and apply it to the Netherlands, a country with large nutrient <b>emissions.</b> Compared <b>to</b> a 2015 reference scenario based on current efforts <b>to</b> reduce nutrient <b>emissions,</b> we found that the WFD measures will increase regional transport and export of manure and reduce the number of animals in the Netherlands. Fodder adjustments (defined as lower N and P 2 O 5 input in purchased fodder) to decrease nutrient excretion in manure were a less attractive option than amongst others export, transportation of manure to another region, land use changes or reduction of the number of livestock. Compared to the reference scenario in 2015, total agricultural income will decrease by about € 81. 5 million per year (about € 49 /ha per year), although the effects will differ among parts of the Netherlands and agricultural sectors.

This study determines how {{and to which}} extent the management of phosphorus in Austria can be optimized. A detailed national model, obtained for the year 2013 through Material Flow Analysis, represents the reference situation. Applicability and limitations are discussed {{for a range of}} actions aimed at reducing consumption, increasing recycling, and lowering emissions. The potential contribution of each field of action is quantified and compared using three indicators: Import dependency, Consumption of fossil-P fertilizers and <b>Emissions</b> <b>to</b> <b>water</b> bodies. Further, the uncertainty of this assessment is characterized and priorities for the upgrade of data collection are identified. Moreover, all the potential gains discussed in the article are applied to the reference situation to generate an ideal target model. The results show that in Austria a large scope for phosphorus stewardship exists. Strategies based exclusively either on recycling or on the decline of P consumption hold a similar potential to reduce import dependency by 50 % each. An enhanced P recycling from meat and bone meal, sewage sludge and compost could replace the current use of fossil-P fertilizers by 70 %. The target model, i. e. the maximum that could be achieved taking into account trade-offs between different actions, is characterized by an extremely low import dependency of 0. 23 kgPcap− 1 y− 1 (2. 2 kgPcap− 1 y− 1 in 2013), by a 28 % decline of <b>emissions</b> <b>to</b> <b>water</b> bodies and by null consumption of fossil-P fertilizers.

The document {{is to be}} considered as a start for the national discussion during an exploratory meeting on integrated criteria documents. Pure nickel is not produced in the Netherlands, but nickel and nickel compounds are widely used. The most important sources of <b>emissions</b> <b>to</b> air are refineries and usage of diesel oil, whereas industry and agriculture contribute significantly <b>to</b> <b>emissions</b> <b>to</b> <b>water</b> and soil, respectively. By far the most important nickel-containing waste stream is domestic waste. In general the <b>emissions</b> are expected <b>to</b> decrease. Concentration levels in surface water, sediment, soil, groundwater, outdoor air and food are available. In most cases the actual standards and guidelines are not exceeded; higher environmental concentrations are found in some local areas. Nickel is an essential dietary trace element, but inhalatory exposure to nickel compounds can result in respiratory tract cancer. With respect to risks to the general population in the Netherlands, the current nickel concentrations in ambient air and in the diet appear to be within acceptable limits. Calculated maximum permissible concentrations for aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems are below natural occuring background levels. Locally these levels are exceeded, but in most of these cases the risks involved may be qualified as small...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of the study {{presented in this paper}} is to estimate the direct and indirect economic impacts of water quality policy scenarios in the Netherlands focusing on the reduction of emission levels of nutrients and a number of eco-toxicological substances. For this purpose, an Applied General Equilibrium (AGE) model consisting of 27 production sectors is extended <b>to</b> <b>water</b> through the inclusion of substitution elasticities between labour, capital and <b>emissions</b> <b>to</b> <b>water</b> in the sectors' production functions. The macro-economic costs of a 10, 20 and 50 % reduction of the emission levels in the year 2000 of ten priority substances in the EU Water Framework Directive vary between 0. 2 and 9. 4 % of Net National Income (NNI). A large share of the total economic costs are borne by important sources of pollution like commercial shipping, the chemical and metal industry. However, important spin-off effects due to adaptation take place in the tertiary service sector. Besides the estimation of the economy-wide impacts of water quality improvements, the novelty of the study presented here is found in the downscaling of national and sector results to river basin level and the estimation of shadow prices for water-polluting substances through the introduction of an emission permits marke...|$|R
5000|$|The EcoCute can derive {{over two}} units of heat {{energy from ambient}} air for every unit of input {{electrical}} energy. In combination it can produce more than three units of hot water energy, resulting in reduced CO2 <b>emissions</b> compared <b>to</b> <b>water</b> heating via electricity or natural gas. To produce 90°C hot water, an EcoCute consumes 66% less electricity than an electric water heater, and costs 80% less than heating water via natural gas in Japan. Also, by reducing use of fossil fuels, the EcoCute results in more than 50% reductions in CO2 emissions ...|$|R
40|$|Life cycle {{assessment}} (LCA) methodology {{was used}} to compare the environmental loads from wastewater systems with different technical solutions. This study compared proposed conventional wastewater systems, both large and small scale, with separation systems: one in which urine is handled separately and one in which black water is treated in a liquid composting process. The study showed that large economies of scale, in environmental terms, could be gained both for the operation and for the construction phase. The separation systems outperformed the conventional systems by showing lower <b>emissions</b> <b>to</b> <b>water</b> and more efficient recycling of nutrients to agriculture, especially of nitrogen but also of phosphorus. This implies that the use of separation systems could significantly reduce the need for, and hence the production of, mineral fertilizers and thus reduce the overall use of energy and phosphate minerals. The combination of large-scale wastewater treatment and urine separation was found to be especially advantageous in these respects. It is concluded that {{some of the most important}} environmental advantages of separation systems emerge only when models of wastewater systems are expanded to also include potential effects on the production of fertilizers...|$|R
40|$|The {{traditional}} approach to U. S. environmental {{policy has been}} <b>to</b> regulate <b>emissions</b> <b>to</b> air, land and water separately. Recognizing that efforts to enforce medium-specific environmental regulations are also medium-specific, we hypothesize that the enforcement of regulations pertaining to one environment medium may cause polluters to alter their releases to other media. This dissertation examines the impacts of the enforcement of air and water regulations faced by the U. S. pulp industry on their toxic chemical releases <b>to</b> air and <b>water</b> pathways and the human-health risks associated with these releases. ^ The results suggest that pulp facilities respond to {{a greater number of}} inspections for compliance to air regulations by reducing their TRI <b>emissions</b> <b>to</b> <b>water</b> pathways. On the other hand, these firms seem to respond to a greater number of inspections for water regulation compliance and efforts taken against violators of water regulations by increasing their toxic chemical releases to air pathways. Using the EPA 2 ̆ 7 s Risk-Screening Environmental Indicators Model enforcement-induced cross-media transfers of human-health risks from air and water releases of toxic chemicals are also examined. This study finds that cross-media risk impacts can differ substantially from cross-media release impacts. ^ Additionally, TRI release trends and their associated human-health risks are examined for the U. S. pulp industry between 1988 and 1997. This analysis finds that while combined air and water releases did not change much during the decade, the overall risk impact of these releases declined by more than 70...|$|R
