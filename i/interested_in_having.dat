40|$|This study {{compared}} {{women with}} a highly positive <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> becoming mothers with women <b>having</b> little <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>having</b> children,with respect to biographical data, childrearing attitudes, and personality characteristics. One hundred twenty-one undergraduate college women were administered a biographical questionnaire, the Parental Attitude Research Instrument, the Adjective Check List, and an attitude index designed to assess level of <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>having</b> children. A statistical analysis revealed the remarkable similarity {{of the two groups}} of women, as the groups differed significantly in only two areas.

5|$|In 1967, Warner Bros.-Seven Arts {{producers}} Kenneth Hyman and Phil Feldman were <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>having</b> Sam Peckinpah rewrite {{and direct}} an adventure film called The Diamond Story. A professional outcast {{due to the}} production difficulties of his previous film Major Dundee (1965) and his firing from the set of The Cincinnati Kid (1965), Peckinpah's stock had improved following his critically acclaimed work on the television film Noon Wine (1966). An alternative screenplay available at the studio was The Wild Bunch, written by Roy Sickner and Walon Green. At the time, William Goldman's screenplay Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid had recently been purchased by 20th Century Fox. It was quickly decided that The Wild Bunch, which had several similarities to Goldman's work, would be produced in order to beat Butch Cassidy to the theaters.|$|E
5|$|With the {{development}} of Neverwinter Nights II coming to an end, Obsidian was contacted by three different publishers. Electronic Arts wanted Obsidian to develop a role-playing game to compete with , and another publisher was also <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>having</b> Obsidian develop a fantasy RPG. The third publisher was Sega, who wanted the studio to develop an action role-playing game set within the Alien franchise. The game, titled Aliens: Crucible, was to feature base-building, dialogue choices, and character customization. In February 2009 Obsidian sent a prototype to Sega. Sega decided to cancel the game three weeks later without inspecting the demo. The cancellation was officially confirmed in June of that year. At around the same time, Atari again approached Obsidian, this time to revive Baldur's Gate III. Obsidian requested a large budget, which Atari could not afford, and the deal between the two companies fell apart when Atari Europe was sold to Namco Bandai Games.|$|E
5|$|Kosmos {{was bought}} by the Skaugen Group in 1988, and on 21 October, Kosmos' Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Bjørn Bettum and Chairman Otto Grieg Tidemand were fired. The Skaugen Group decided to {{integrate}} Kosmos' shipping and oil-related activities into their group. All other investments, including Norsk Air, were to be sold or closed. At the time, Norsk Air had 140 employees. Norsk Air's CEO, Mr. Røsjodet, made contact with Bård Mikkelsen, who was CEO of Widerøe, {{to try to convince}} them to purchase Norsk Air. Widerøe was a that time solely occupied with flying on the subsidized regional routes. The company was <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>having</b> some non-subsidized routes to better benchmark its operations. The two largest owners, Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) and Braathens SAFE, did not want to purchase Norsk Air, but the third-largest owner, Fred. Olsen & Co. liked the idea, and bought SAS' and Braathens SAFE's 62.3 percent stake in Widerøe to make the deal possible. Other possible purchasers who had negotiated with Norsk Air were Sterling Airlines, Partnair and Jan Einar Johansen, former owner of Scandi Line.|$|E

25|$|Income {{taxation}} has {{the worst}} effect on {{division of labor}} {{in the form of}} barter. Suppose that the person doing job B is actually <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>having</b> job A done for him. Now suppose you could amazingly do job A four times over, selling half your work on the market for cash just to pay your tax bill. The other half of the work you do for somebody who does job B twice over but he has to sell off half to pay his tax bill. You're left with one unit of job B, but only if you were 400% as productive doing job A! In this case of 50% tax on barter income, anything less than 400% productivity will cause the division of labor to fail.|$|E
