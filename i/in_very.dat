5|$|A yellowish-brown pigment is {{diffused}} {{through the}} cytosol of the hyphae and is much deeper in color {{just below the}} cuticle of the cap. <b>In</b> <b>very</b> young fruit bodies, stems and caps are very pale buff, but soon {{the color of the}} cap deepens and becomes cinnamon. The intensity of the color appears to be dependent on light, for when fruit bodies are grown in diffuse light (temperature and humidity being constant) they are a uniform pale buff color, but in bright light they are cinnamon or tan.|$|E
5|$|An acute {{exacerbation}} of COPD {{is defined}} as increased shortness of breath, increased sputum production, {{a change in the}} color of the sputum from clear to green or yellow, or an increase in cough in someone with COPD. This may present with signs of increased work of breathing such as fast breathing, a fast heart rate, sweating, active use of muscles in the neck, a bluish tinge to the skin, and confusion or combative behavior <b>in</b> <b>very</b> severe exacerbations. Crackles may also be heard over the lungs on examination with a stethoscope.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} {{concern for}} Barnes, when {{returning from the}} United Kingdom to Australia, was to avoid paying customs duties on the enormous amount of goods he acquired through various deals during the tour. This included good quality English cloth, <b>in</b> <b>very</b> short supply in Australia at this time. Hearing a rumour that Customs officials were waiting in Sydney for him, Barnes disembarked at Melbourne and travelled to Sydney by train. The move worked and he sold his stock at a substantial profit, conservatively estimated to be equal to his tour fee.|$|E

5|$|Antlion larvae require loose soil, not {{necessarily}} but often sand. The larvae prefer dry places {{protected from the}} rain.

5|$|As much as 80% of {{the lead}} <b>in</b> <b>very</b> high-content initial {{concentrates}} can be obtained as bullion; the remaining 20% forms a slag rich in lead monoxide. For a low-grade feed, all {{of the lead}} can be oxidized to a high-lead slag. Metallic lead is further obtained from the high-lead (25–40%) slags via submerged fuel combustion or injection, reduction assisted by an electric furnace, {{or a combination of}} both.|$|E
5|$|As the {{efficiency}} {{is proportional to}} Fs3, small improvements in low frequency extension with the same driver and box volume will result <b>in</b> <b>very</b> significant reductions in efficiency. For these reasons, subwoofers are typically very inefficient at converting electrical energy into sound energy. This combination of factors accounts for the higher amplifier power required to drive subwoofers, and the requirement for greater power handling for subwoofer drivers. Enclosure variations (e.g., bass reflex designs with a port in the cabinet) are often used for subwoofers to increase {{the efficiency}} of the driver/enclosure system, helping to reduce the amplifier power requirements.|$|E
