5|$|In Britain the Scottish Crop Research Institute was {{tasked with}} {{developing}} new varieties suitable for {{growing in the}} north of the country. They produced new cultivars that had greater cold tolerance, especially in the spring, ripened earlier and more evenly and had greater fungal disease resistance. Frost tolerance was improved by selecting for late flowering and genetic research identified genes involved in resistance to <b>gall</b> <b>mite</b> and the blackcurrant reversion virus. 'Ben Lomond' {{was the first of the}} 'Ben' varieties and was released in 1975. This was followed by several other cultivars for the juicing industry such as 'Ben Alder' and 'Ben Tirran'. The cultivar 'Ben Hope' was released in 1998 with increased tolerance to <b>gall</b> <b>mite,</b> and in the same year, 'Ben Gairn' became available. It shows resistance to the reversion virus. For gardeners and the pick-your-own market, 'Ben Sarek', 'Ben Connan' and 'Big Ben' were introduced and have large, sweet berries. The cultivars 'Ben Connan', 'Ben Lomond' and 'Ben Sarek' have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. and new varieties are being developed continually to improve frost tolerance, disease resistance, machine harvesting, fruit quality, nutritional content and fruit flavour.|$|E
5|$|Reversion is {{a serious}} disease {{transmitted}} by the blackcurrant <b>gall</b> <b>mite</b> Cecidophyopsis ribis. It causes a decline in yield and is quite widespread in Europe but is rarely encountered on other continents. Symptoms include a modification of leaf shape in summer and swollen buds ("big bud") in winter, each housing thousands of microscopic mites. As pest control has limited effectiveness, severely infected bushes should be destroyed. All new plants purchased should be certified as virus-free.|$|E
5|$|As a crop, the {{blackcurrant}} {{suffers from}} several pests and diseases. The most serious disease is reversion, {{caused by a}} virus transmitted by the blackcurrant <b>gall</b> <b>mite.</b> Another is {{white pine blister rust}} which alternates between two unrelated hosts, one in the genus Ribes (blackcurrant included) and the other a white pine. This fungus caused damage to forests when the fruit was first introduced into North America, where the native white pines have no genetic resistance to the disease. As a result, the blackcurrant has for most of the 20th century been subject to restrictions in parts of the United States as a disease vector. The effectiveness of these restrictions is questionable, since other Ribes species also host the disease and are native to North America.|$|E

25|$|The affinities of tongue worms {{have long}} proved controversial. Historically, they were {{initially}} compared to various groups of parasitic worms. Once the arthropod-like {{nature of their}} cuticle was recognised, similarities were drawn with <b>mites,</b> particularly <b>gall</b> <b>mites</b> (Eriophyidae). Although <b>gall</b> <b>mites</b> are much smaller than tongue worms {{they also have a}} long, segmented body and only two pairs of legs. Later work drew comparisons with millipedes and centipedes (Myriapoda), with velvet worms (Onychophora) and water bears (Tardigrada). Some authors interpreted tongue worms as essentially intermediate between annelids and arthropods, while others suggested that they deserved a phylum of their own. Tongue worms grow by moulting, which suggests they belong to Ecdysozoa, while other work has identified the arthropod-like nature of their larvae, In general, there are two current alternative interpretations: pentastomids are highly modified and parasitic crustaceans, probably related to fish lice, or they are an ancient group of stem-arthropods, close to the origins of Arthropoda.|$|R
50|$|Aceria is a genus of mites {{belonging}} to the family Eriophyidae, the <b>gall</b> <b>mites.</b> These tiny animals are parasites of plants. Several species can cause blistering and galls, including erineum galls.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of arthropods in amber exclusively from the Cretaceous and Cenozoic {{is widely regarded}} to {{be a result of}} the production and preservation of large amounts of tree resin beginning ca. 130 million years (Ma) ago. Abundant 230 million-year-old amber from the Late Triassic (Carnian) of northeastern Italy has previously yielded myriad microorganisms, but we report here that it also preserves arthropods some 100 Ma older than the earliest prior records in amber. The Triassic specimens are a nematoceran fly (Diptera) and two disparate species of mites, Triasacarus fedelei gen. et sp. nov., and Ampezzoa triassica gen. et sp. nov. These mites are the oldest definitive fossils of a group, the Eriophyoidea, which includes the <b>gall</b> <b>mites</b> and comprises at least 3, 500 Recent species, 97 % of which feed on angiosperms and represents one of the most specialized lineages of phytophagous arthropods. Antiquity of the <b>gall</b> <b>mites</b> in much their extant form was unexpected, particularly with the Triassic species already having many of their present-day features (such as only two pairs of legs); further, it establishes conifer feeding as an ancestral trait. Feeding by the fossil mites {{may have contributed to the}} formation of the amber droplets, but we find that the abundance of amber during the Carnian (ca. 230 Ma) is globally anomalous for the pre-Cretaceous and may, alternatively, be related to paleoclimate. Further recovery of arthropods in Carnian-aged amber is promising and will have profound implications for understanding the evolution of terrestrial members of the most diverse phylum of organisms...|$|R

50|$|Eriophyidae is {{a family}} of more than 200 genera of mites, which live as plant parasites, {{commonly}} causing galls or other damage to the plant tissues and hence known as <b>gall</b> <b>mites.</b> About 3,600 species have been described, but this is probably less than 10% of the actual number existing in this poorly researched family. They are tiny, microscopic mites and are yellow to pinkish white to purplish in color. The mites are worm like, and have only two pairs of legs. Their primary method of population spread is by wind. They affect {{a wide range of}} plants, and several are major pest species causing substantial economic damage to crops. Some species, however, are used as biological agents to control weeds and invasive plant species.|$|R
25|$|Only {{the faintest}} traces of primary {{segmentation}} remain in mites, the prosoma and opisthosoma being insensibly fused, and {{a region of}} flexible cuticle (the cirumcapitular furrow) separates the chelicerae and pedipalps {{from the rest of}} the body. This anterior body region is called the gnathosoma (or capitulum) and is also found in the Ricinulei. The remainder of the body is called the idiosoma and is unique to mites. Most adult mites have four pairs of legs, like other arachnids, but some have fewer. For example, <b>gall</b> <b>mites</b> like Phyllocoptes variabilis (superfamily Eriophyioidea) have a wormlike body with only two pairs of legs; some parasitic mites have only one or three pairs of legs in the adult stage.
