5|$|A {{mammalian}} virus, {{the rabbit}} haemorrhagic disease virus {{was introduced to}} Australia to attempt to control the European rabbit populations there. It escaped from quarantine and spread across the country, killing large numbers of rabbits. Very young animals survived, passing immunity to their offspring in due course and eventually producing a virus-resistant population. Introduction into New Zealand in the 1990s was similarly successful at first, but a <b>decade</b> <b>later,</b> immunity had developed and populations had returned to pre-RHD levels.|$|E
5|$|A third bore of the tunnel, {{replacing}} the old Victorian northbound bore, was proposed by Transport Secretary Cecil Parkinson in 1989, but {{had yet to}} see any progress towards construction over a <b>decade</b> <b>later.</b> This option is not currently favoured by TfL due to technical problems with construction and engineering, difficulty tying in with the existing road network, and concern about increased traffic on the A12.|$|E

Around a <b>decade</b> <b>later</b> Bach prepared two Latin Magnificats by other composers for performance (BWV1082, BWV Anh. 30). Probably {{around the same time}} Bach performed BWV10 again.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of this attack, a 4-inch Mark III QF gun was erected on a {{promontory}} overlooking Village Bay, but it never saw action against the enemy. Of greater long-term significance to the islanders were the introduction of regular {{contact with the outside world}} and the slow development of a money-based economy. This made life easier for the St Kildans but also made them less self-reliant. Both were factors in the evacuation of the island little more than a <b>decade</b> <b>later.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Kalamazoo-class {{monitors}} were a {{class of}} ocean-going ironclad monitors begun during the American Civil War.

If the four ships had been finished they would have been the most seaworthy monitors in the US Navy. One was scrapped in 1874 while the other three were disposed of a <b>decade</b> <b>later.</b>|$|E
