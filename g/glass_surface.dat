5|$|Most of the {{physical}} properties of astatine have been estimated (by interpolation or extrapolation), using theoretically or empirically derived methods. For example, halogens get darker with increasing atomic weight– fluorine is nearly colorless, chlorine is yellow-green, bromine is red-brown, and iodine is dark gray/violet. Astatine is sometimes described as probably being a black solid (assuming it follows this trend), or as having a metallic appearance (if it is a metalloid or a metal). The melting and boiling points of astatine are also expected to follow the trend seen in the halogen series, increasing with atomic number. On this basis they {{are estimated to be}} , respectively. Some experimental evidence suggests astatine may have lower melting and boiling points than those implied by the halogen trend. Astatine sublimes less readily than does iodine, having a lower vapor pressure. Even so, half of a given quantity of astatine will vaporize in approximately an hour if put on a clean <b>glass</b> <b>surface</b> at room temperature. The absorption spectrum of astatine in the middle ultraviolet region has lines at 224.401 and 216.225nm, suggestive of 6p to 7s transitions.|$|E

25|$|However, metal spacers conduct heat (unless {{the metal}} is {{thermally}} improved), undermining {{the ability of}} the insulated glass unit (IGU) to reduce heat flow. It may also result in water or ice forming {{at the bottom of the}} sealed unit because of the sharp temperature difference between the window and surrounding air. To reduce heat transfer through the spacer and increase overall thermal performance, manufacturers may make the spacer out of a less-conductive material such as structural foam. A spacer made of aluminum that also contains a highly structural thermal barrier reduces condensation on the <b>glass</b> <b>surface</b> and improves insulation, as measured by the overall U-value.|$|E

25|$|The {{ability of}} geckos – which can {{hang on a}} <b>glass</b> <b>surface</b> using only one toe – to climb on sheer {{surfaces}} {{has been attributed to}} the van der Waals forces between these surfaces and the spatulae, or microscopic projections, which cover the hair-like setae found on their footpads. A later study suggested that capillary adhesion might play a role, but that hypothesis has been rejected by more recent studies. There were efforts in 2008 to create a dry glue that exploits the effect, and success was achieved in 2011 to create an adhesive tape on similar grounds. In 2011, a paper was published relating the effect to both velcro-like hairs and the presence of lipids in gecko footprints.|$|E
25|$|Glass doors {{pose the}} risk of unintentional {{collision}} if a person believes the door to be open when it is closed, or is unaware there is a door at all. This risk may be particularly pronounced with sliding glass doors because they often have large single panes which are hard to see. To prevent injury from glass doors, stickers or other types of warnings are sometimes placed on the <b>glass</b> <b>surface</b> {{to make it more}} visible. For instance, in the UK, Regulation 14 of the Workplace (Health and Safety Regulations) 1992 requires the marking of windows and glass doors to make them conspicuous. Australian Standards: AS1288 and AS2208 require glass doors to be made from laminated or toughened glass.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} type of optical glass is crown glass, which has an index of {{refraction}} of about 1.52. An optimal single-layer coating would have to be made of a material with an index of about 1.23. Unfortunately, there are no solid materials with such a low refractive index. The closest materials with good physical properties for a coating are magnesium fluoride, MgF2 (with an index of 1.38), and fluoropolymers (which can have indices as low as 1.30, but are more difficult to apply). MgF2 on a crown <b>glass</b> <b>surface</b> gives a reflectance of about 1%, compared to 4% for bare glass. MgF2 coatings perform much better on higher-index glasses, especially those with index of refraction close to 1.9. MgF2 coatings are commonly used because they are cheap, and when they are designed for a wavelength {{in the middle of the}} visible band, they give reasonably good anti-reflection over the entire band. Researchers have produced films of mesoporous silica nanoparticles with refractive indices as low as 1.12, which function as antireflection coatings.|$|E

25|$|Bubble flow meters: A simple, yet highly {{accurate}} way {{to measure}} flow rates involves timing movement of bubbles of soap film up glass tubes between marks of known volume. The glass tube is connected at the bottom (for push systems) or at the top (for pull systems) to the air stream. A small rubber pipette bulb attached {{at the base of}} the tube acts as both a reservoir and delivery system for the soap bubbles. Operation is simple. First, wet the <b>glass</b> <b>surface</b> along the path bubbles travel (e.g., press the bulb so that copious amounts of soap are pushed up the glass by the air flow) to provide a virtually friction-free surface. Second, pinch the bulb so that one clean bubble is produced. With a stopwatch in hand, record the time required for the bubble to travel between marks on the glass. Note the volume recorded on the upper mark (e.g., 125 = 125ml), divide the volume by the time required to travel between marks and the result is the flow rate (ml/s). These instruments can be purchased from a variety of sources, but they may also be constructed from appropriate-sized, glass volumetric pipettes.|$|E

500|$|The most {{striking}} {{outcomes of the}} analysis of Kinesin-5 motility {{is that it is}} slow – about 10 times slower than conventional Kinesin-1 – with a velocity in the range of 50 nanometers per second and that it could generate very high levels of mechanical force (7-9 picoNewtons per molecule). [...] These values come from three types of experimental data: microtubule gliding assays, single molecule motility assays, and optical trap assays. In microtubule gliding assays, kinesins are attached to a <b>glass</b> <b>surface</b> and microtubules are laid down over the top. [...] Since the motors are attached to the glass, their motile behavior translates into movement of the microtubule across the anchored kinesins, akin to someone crowd surfing. [...] These experiments gave us the first analysis of Kinesin-5 motility. [...] By attaching microtubules to the <b>glass</b> <b>surface</b> first, then adding Kinesin-5 with free microtubules in solution, it was possible to adapt the microtubule gliding assays to show that Kinesin-5 can crosslink two microtubules and move them in opposite directions. [...] This experiment showed that Kinesin-5 was indeed capable of carrying out the role that had been proposed for it in mitosis – sliding oppositely oriented microtubules in the mitotic spindle. [...] To study the behavior of individual Kinesin-5 molecules, single molecule motility assays were performed by attaching microtubules to a <b>glass</b> <b>surface,</b> then adding a dilute solution of Kinesin-5 with a fluorophore attached. [...] This experimental setup enables the observer to follow separate Kinesin-5 molecules as they “walk” along the microtubule, providing not only information about velocity, but also about processivity – the ability of a kinesin to take multiple steps along the microtubule without dissociating. [...] In single molecule motility assays, velocities for Kinesin-5 were similar to those seen in microtubule gliding assays, and the motor was observed to be weakly processive. In optical trap experiments, Kinesin-5 molecules are attached to a bead that can be held in place by a finely focused laser. [...] By moving the bead close to a microtubule, the kinesin can bind to the microtubule and begin stepping, pulling the bead along behind it. [...] Since the bead is being held in place by the trap laser, it acts like a spring and exerts a force that resists the forward movement of the kinesin. [...] This allows for the measurement of the stall force – the maximum amount of force that can be exerted by a motor before it releases from the microtubule. [...] Optical trap experiments showed that Kinesin-5 generates a maximum of 7 picoNewtons of force before releasing, but that its behavior differs from that of other kinesins in that there was no observable plateau phase in which the motor “struggles” at its maximal force generation before letting go. [...] Extrapolation of kinetic data suggests that the maximal observed force generated in the optical trap by Kinesin-5 is actually an underestimate and that it theoretically can exert up to 9 picoNewtons of force as a maximum, although further experimental work is required to test this.|$|E
