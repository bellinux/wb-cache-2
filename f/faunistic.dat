5|$|Carl Arend Friedrich Wiegmann (1893, 1898) {{discussed}} {{portions of}} the anatomy of A. adamsii, A. porcellanus, A. contrarius, and A. sinistralis. Walter Edward Collinge (1901, 1902) briefly noted features of A. palaceus and A. parakensis (reported as A. perversus). Haniel (1921) dissected A. contrarius and A. reflexilabris, and Bernhard Rensch published a few scattered notes in his various <b>faunistic</b> surveys. A few earlier notes are mentioned in Pilsbry (1900).|$|E
5|$|Since 1900, {{the major}} taxonomic studies on Amphidromus have been <b>faunistic</b> (a {{study of the}} fauna of some {{territory}} or area) in scope. The papers of American malacologist Paul Bartsch (1917, 1918, 1919) on the Philippine species, Bernhard Rensch (1932) on the Lesser Sunda Islands forms, and Tera van Benthem Jutting (1950, 1959) on Javan and Sumatran populations are especially comprehensive. Potentially the most valuable contribution is that of Curt Haniel (1921), who discussed the variation within A. contrarius and A. reflexilabris on Timor; the variations in color and form were well illustrated {{in a series of}} color plates.|$|E

25|$|The fauna of Palm Springs {{is mostly}} species adapted to desert, {{temperature}} extremes and {{to lack of}} moisture. It is located within the Nearctic <b>faunistic</b> realm in a region containing an assemblage of species similar to Northern Africa. Native fauna includes Pronghorns, Desert Bighorn Sheep, Desert Tortoise, Kit Fox, Desert Iguanas, Horned Lizards, Chuckwalla, Bobcats, Mountain lions and Gila Monsters. Other animals include ground squirrels, rock squirrels, porcupines, skunks, cactus mice, kangaroo rats, pocket gophers and raccoons. Desert birds here include the iconic Roadrunner, which can run at speeds exceeding 15 mp/h. Other avifauna includes the Ladder-backed woodpecker, flycatchers, elf owls, great horned owls, sparrow hawks {{and a variety of}} raptors.|$|E

50|$|<b>Faunistic</b> Park La Torbiera {{is located}} in a border area between the Po Valley and the Prealps, {{characterized}} by a mild but damp climate, and plenty of small lakes.

In wet soil, the oxygen deficiency prevents the oxidation processes and the complete decomposition of plants.|$|E
