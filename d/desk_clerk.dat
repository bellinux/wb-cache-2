The other NRA members arrive and foil Snake, who escapes. Homer then says he does not trust himself and asks Marge to throw the gun away herself. However, Marge sees a {{reflection}} of herself holding it in the trash can and decides to keep it.|$|E

6000|$|... "As for the {{business}} premises, they were, and, in fact, are, of the usual pattern; an office with its rows of <b>desks,</b> <b>clerks,</b> and cashiers, and beyond, through a glass door, the manager's private room, with the ponderous safe, and desk, and so on.|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, Krichell focused on Ivy League pitchers, saying he {{preferred}} signing pitchers who could think. From Harvard University, he signed Charlie Devens later saying {{he could have}} been great had he continued to play baseball, and from Yale University, he scouted pitcher Johnny Broaca who seemed to be heading for stardom after winning 12 games in his first three seasons with the Yankees, but suddenly retired to become a professional boxer. In 1935, a local scout who worked with Krichell placed Long Island University pitcher Marius Russo in a semi-professional team. When Krichell deemed Russo ready, he signed with the Yankees for $750, twice becoming a 14-game winner and being an All-Star in 1941 before injuring his arm. Other Krichell signings from this period included Johnny Murphy, Hank Borowy and Johnny Allen. Murphy, a relief pitcher and four time saves leader, was signed while still in high school in the Bronx and at Krichell's behest, the Yankees followed Murphy's education at Fordham University, where he gained baseball experience. Krichell signed Borowy from Fordham University for $8,500 and the player later became the ace for the Yankees during the wartime era. Krichell supposedly discovered Allen by a chance encounter when Allen worked as a <b>desk</b> <b>clerk</b> at a Sanford hotel. The story said he recognized Krichell as a scout, told him that he was a pitcher, and that he wanted to try out. Krichell agreed, and impressed by Allen's ability, signed him to a minor league contract. However, in an interview with J. G. Taylor Spink of The Sporting News, Krichell said while he signed Allen, he did not discover him.|$|E
25|$|To {{improve his}} own image, Chalmers {{requests}} SFPD Lieutenant Frank Bullitt, who is well-liked {{by the local}} media. Bullitt and his team, Delgetti and Stanton, put Ross under around-the-clock protection in a cheap hotel selected by Chalmers. At 1:00a.m., while Bullitt is with his girlfriend Cathy, Stanton is on solo duty when the <b>desk</b> <b>clerk</b> unexpectedly calls to announce that Chalmers wants to come up. While Stanton checks by phone with Bullitt, Ross unchains the hotel room door. A pair of hitmen burst in and shoot Stanton and Ross, seriously wounding both.|$|E

The oldest of five children, Walker lived in Vidor with his father, who gave him a guitar when he was nine years old. Walker began {{entering}} talent competitions at age fifteen. After leaving his shift as nighttime <b>desk</b> <b>clerk</b> at a Super 8 Motel, he stopped at a local radio station to deliver a tape of a song that he had written. Although the morning disc jockey {{told him that the}} station's policies prohibited playing self-submitted tapes, he played Walker's song and said that it was [...] "too good to pass up." ...|$|E
5000|$|In another {{episode of}} the Jack Benny Radio Program from 21 January 1945, Mary {{complains}} that the hotel is so far underground that they are mining coal in the lobby, and the bellhops have lamps on their Helmets.

While crying, she tells him of a troubling dream {{in which she was}} having sex with the naval officer and many other men, and laughing at the idea of Bill seeing her with them. The next morning, Bill goes to Nick's hotel, where the <b>desk</b> <b>clerk</b> tells Bill that a bruised and frightened Nick checked out a few hours earlier after returning with two large, dangerous-looking men. Bill goes to return the costume, but not the mask, which he has misplaced, and learns Milich has sold his daughter into prostitution.|$|E
5000|$|Between 1968 and 1973 {{he was a}} Deputy Director-General at the Department of Health. In January 1973 he was {{appointed}} Director-General of the Department of Social Security.

50|$|The pulpit is Jacobean, {{possibly}} {{by the same}} craftsman who provided much of the panelling in Chastleton House, is etched with the date 1623.

2500|$|Peggy Caserta and Seth Morgan {{had both}} {{failed to meet}} Joplin the Friday {{immediately}} prior to her death, October 2, and Joplin had been expecting both of them to keep her company that night. According to Caserta, Joplin was saddened that neither of her friends visited her at the Landmark as they had promised. During the 24 hours Joplin lived after this disappointment, Caserta did not phone her to explain why she had failed to show up. Caserta admitted to waiting until late Saturday night to dial the Landmark switchboard, only to learn that Joplin had instructed the <b>desk</b> <b>clerk</b> not to accept any incoming phone calls for her after midnight. [...] Morgan did speak to Joplin via telephone within 24 hours of her death, {{but it is not}} known whether he admitted to her that he had broken his promise.|$|E
2500|$|Two {{days after}} the murders, Speck was {{identified}} by a drifter named Claude Lunsford. Speck, Lunsford, and another man had been drinking the evening of July 15 on the fire escape of the Starr Hotel at 617 W. Madison. On July 16, Lunsford recognized a sketch of the murderer in the evening paper and phoned the police at 9:30p.m. after finding Speck in his (Lunsford's) room at the Starr Hotel. The police, however, {{did not respond to}} the call although their records showed it had been made. Speck then attempted suicide, and the Starr Hotel <b>desk</b> <b>clerk</b> phoned in the emergency around midnight. Speck was taken to Cook County Hospital at 12:30a.m. on July 17. At the hospital, Speck was recognized by Dr. LeRoy Smith, a 25-year-old surgical resident physician, who had read about the [...] "Born To Raise Hell" [...] tattoo in a newspaper story. The police were called. Speck was arrested. Concerns over the recent Miranda case that had vacated the convictions of a number of criminals meant Speck was not even questioned for three weeks after his arrest.|$|E
2500|$|There were {{at least}} two occurrences of {{immediate}} censorship of the series. The original broadcast of the segment [...] "Road Rash" [...] featured {{a scene in which}} Rocko and Heffer stop at what is suggested to be a love hotel (the [...] "No-Tell Motel") advertising [...] "hourly rates" [...] and ask the horse <b>desk</b> <b>clerk</b> for a room, who infers the two will be engaging in intercourse: [...] "All night? [...] Wheeeooo! Okay." [...] The first airing of [...] "Hut Sut Raw" [...] included a scene in which Rocko is picking berries; upon picking one lower on the bush, a bear rushes out whimpering and grasping his crotch. This scene is untouched in Canada. Both scenes were edited by Nickelodeon after their first broadcasts and are the only instances of censorship on the season two DVD, released in 2012. On the season three DVD, the [...] "Wacky Delly" [...] segment was shortened by approximately ten seconds to remove footage of Sal Ami repeatedly whacking Betty Bologna over the head with a telephone receiver. In addition, the restaurant named [...] "Chokey Chicken" [...] (a term for masturbation) was renamed [...] "Chewy Chicken" [...] for the series' fourth season. As the series entered reruns after cancellation, more scenes were cut. The entire episode [...] "Leap Frogs", in which Bev Bighead attempts to seduce Rocko, was skipped.|$|E
5000|$|British {{actor and}} playwright David Horne began his film {{career in the}} 1930s, after a {{distinguished}} early career in the theatre. He was generally seen portraying pompous, self-satisfied characters. He never managed {{to rise to the}} [...] "star" [...] level in his silver screen acting career, but he was an indispensable character actor, and played many utility parts such as <b>desk</b> <b>clerks,</b> newspaper editors, police officials, lawyers and doctors. He continued his theatre work until his death in 1970.|$|R
5000|$|He played many parts: storekeepers, hotel <b>desk</b> <b>clerks,</b> morticians, professors, bank tellers, ministers, {{confidence}} men, {{and a host}} {{of other}} characterizations, usually timid, whining, weak-willed, shifty, sanctimonious or sycophantic. His earliest films show him clean-shaven, but in the 1940s he adopted a wispy mustache that emphasized his characters worried manner. When the mustache went gray in the 1950s, he reverted to a clean-shaven look. Foulger was a resourceful actor and often embellished his scripted lines with memorable bits of business: in The Falcon Strikes Back, for example, hotel clerk Foulger announces a homicide by bellowing across the lobby: [...] "Mur-der! Mur-der! ...|$|R
5000|$|... ==Premise== Each episode {{features}} a particular hotel struggling with problems and not {{living up to}} its full potential. Twenty-plus year veteran hotelier Anthony Melchiorri secretly scouts each hotel and identifies the property's most urgent issues. He meets with staff, including front <b>desk</b> <b>clerks,</b> housekeeping staff, the maintenance team, and the owners themselves, to determine the key operation failures. Some owners risk losing their hotels if Melchiorri's innovations don't work. After devising a plan for physical, cosmetic, and procedural changes with his designer (usually Casey Noble or former Design Star contestant Blanche Garcia), Melchiorri works to revamp the hotel and its usually biggest problem—the hotel owners themselves.|$|R

60|$|So, too, when Alf left, {{the use of}} the French language, as such, {{fell off}} tremendously in the caff. Even now they use it to some extent. You can still get fillet de beef, and saucisson au juice, but Billy the <b>desk</b> <b>clerk</b> has {{considerable}} trouble with the spelling.|$|E
6000|$|The {{end of it}} {{was bound}} to come. Even in Mariposa {{some of the people}} must have thought so. Else how was it that Henry Mullins made such a fuss about selling a draft for forty {{thousand}} on New York? And why was it that Mr. Smith wouldn't pay Billy, the <b>desk</b> <b>clerk,</b> his back wages when he wanted to put it into Cuba? ...|$|E

25|$|On the right, or south, is the pulpit, reader’s <b>desk,</b> and <b>clerk’s</b> <b>desk,</b> the reader’s desk {{supposedly}} {{made from}} {{portions of the}} original pulpit. The reader’s desk stands {{just in front of}} (north) of the main pulpit. All of this stands to {{the west side of the}} south window on a raised platform but, unlike the chancel, has no separating rail. Between the chancel and the raised area for the pulpit is a small organ enclosed by vertical panels. Behind the organ are two choir pews facing north. (This is a crowded church with very narrow aisles.) In front of the <b>clerk’s</b> <b>desk</b> is the baptismal font. To the west of the raised pulpit are two rows of three slip pews with a central aisle. The rest of the ground level of the church is taken up by rows of slip pews facing south in what is essentially a nave area.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1970s, Morgan {{stopped using}} the byline [...] "Sanche de Gramont". He became an American citizen in 1977, renouncing his titles of nobility. The name he adopted as a U.S. citizen, [...] "Ted Morgan", is an anagram of [...] "de Gramont". The new name was a {{conscious}} attempt to discard his aristocratic French past. He had {{settled on a}} [...] "name that conformed with the language and cultural norms of American society, a name that telephone operators and <b>desk</b> <b>clerks</b> could hear without flinching" [...] (On Becoming American, 1978). Morgan was featured in the CBS news program 60 Minutes in 1978. The segment explored Morgan's reasons for embracing American culture and showed him eating dinner {{with his family in}} a fast food restaurant.|$|R
6000|$|... "Billy," [...] {{he said to}} the <b>desk</b> <b>clerk,</b> [...] "get {{a couple}} more and put them up {{on the roof of the}} caff behind the hotel. Wire down to the city and get a {{quotation}} on a hundred of them. Take them signs 'American Drinks' out of the bar. Put up noo ones with 'British Beer at all Hours'; clear out the rye whiskey and order in Scotch and Irish, and then go up to the printing office and get me them placards." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{first the}} Mariposa court quashed all indictments. The {{presiding}} judge, with his spectacles on {{and a pile}} of books in front of him, threatened the informer with the penitentiary. The whole bar of Mariposa was with Mr. Smith. But by sheer iteration the informations had proved successful. Judge Pepperleigh learned that Mr. Smith had subscribed a hundred dollars for the Liberal party and at once fined him for keeping open after hours. That made one conviction. On the top of this had come the untoward incident just mentioned and that made two. Beyond that was the deluge. This then was the exact situation when Billy, the <b>desk</b> <b>clerk,</b> entered the back bar with the telegram in his hand.|$|E
6000|$|It {{would be}} presumptuous to {{anticipate}} the National Plan that must emerge from so vast a debate, but certain conclusions I feel in my bones will {{stand the test of}} an exhaustive criticism. The first is that a distinction will be drawn between what I would call [...] "interesting work" [...] and what I would call [...] "mere labour." [...] The two things, I admit, pass by insensible gradations into one another, but while on the one hand such work as being a master gardener and growing roses, or a master cabinet maker and making fine pieces, or an artist of almost any sort, or a story writer, or a consulting physician, or a scientific investigator, or a keeper of wild animals, or a forester, or a librarian, or a good printer, or many sorts of engineer, is work that will always find men of a certain temperament enthusiastically glad to do it, if they can only do it for comfortable pay--for such work is in itself living--there is, on the other hand, work so irksome and toilsome, such as coal mining, or being a private soldier during a peace, or attending upon lunatics, or stoking, or doing over and over again, almost mechanically, little bits of a modern industrial process, or being a cash <b>desk</b> <b>clerk</b> in a busy shop, that few people would undertake if they could avoid it.|$|E
50|$|A {{receptionist}} is {{an employee}} taking an office or administrative support position. The work is usually {{performed in a}} waiting area such as a lobby or front office desk of an organization or business. The title receptionist is attributed {{to the person who}} is employed by an organization to receive or greet any visitors, patients, or clients and answer telephone calls. The term front desk is used in many hotels for an administrative department where a receptionist's duties also may include room reservations and assignment, guest registration, cashier work, credit checks, key control as well as mail and message service. Such receptionists are often called front <b>desk</b> <b>clerks.</b> Receptionists cover many areas of work to assist the businesses they work for, including setting appointments, filing, record keeping, and other office tasks.|$|R
50|$|The petitioner, Joey Stoner, {{had been}} arrested {{following}} a 1960 supermarket robbery in the Los Angeles area. Eyewitness accounts and evidence left at the scene led the police to a hotel elsewhere in the region where Stoner was staying. Two days later, detectives went to the hotel and, with the <b>desk</b> <b>clerk's</b> permission, searched the room and found further evidence linking him to the robbery. Stoner was arrested two days later in Nevada, and extradited. The evidence from the hotel room was used to convict him of the robbery at trial. Stoner unsuccessfully challenged the admissibility of the evidence at trial and on appeal, since police had lacked a warrant and relied on the clerk's permission. The appeals {{court held that the}} search was incident to arrest and thus permissible.|$|R
60|$|He found a gentlemanly looking party {{standing}} {{just outside the}} <b>clerk's</b> <b>desk,</b> who appeared particularly pleased on observing the number on his cap.|$|R
