40|$|A {{new system}} of {{magnetic}} probes was installed during the 2005 shutdown and was commissioned during the 2005 / 2006 restart phase of JET. The system is made of traditional pick-up coils and Hall sensors, all located outside the vessel. Direct ﬁeld measurements from Hall sensors are used to correct the drift of the integrators of the pick-up coils signals. This feature will be crucial for future ITER-like devices, where long-lasting ﬂat top phases are expected, in a high neutron yield and a high temperature environment. After a general overview of the system, the paper describes the major manufacturing and installation issues, including {{the construction of the}} supports and probes as well as the acceptance tests before and after installation. The <b>functional</b> <b>commissioning</b> of the system includes the integration of the new signals in the JET Data Acquisition System and the analysis of several discharges with and without plasma.

The HCS system includes four sets of probes located in four octants equally spaced along the toroidal coordinate, with a total of 24 Rogowski coils and 5 toroidal field pick-up coils. These sensors are meant to provide a measurement of the current flowing through each single tile of the upper dump plate and an estimate of the total poloidal halo current flowing through the first wall structures. The HCS system was installed in the JET vacuum vessel in March 2005 during the 2004 / 2005 shutdown and the acquisition of signals started during the restart phase of the machine in autumn 2005. This paper firstly summarises the critical aspects encountered during the final phase of the procurement of the system and the in-vessel installation, which was accomplished using the remote handling system.

40|$|The paper reviews {{a set of}} {{magnetic}} probes which was installed in JET {{in order to improve}} the field measurements in the proximity of the iron, and focuses in particular on one of them. The set consists of six Limb probes, attached to the upper horizontal iron yokes, and one Collar Probe, inserted in the collar region of the iron structure. The probes include pick-up coils, flux loops, Hall sensors, and a temperature sensor. The data provided by the system are regularly acquired and recorded within the set of JET Pulse Files. They can be used in studies implying measurement of the stray field due to the residual magnetization, as well as for all the modeling activities involving 3 D studies, in particular resistive wall mode studies, more accurate modeling for the vertical stabilization, interactions between NBI and magnetic field. In addition, the experience gained with Hall transducers is considered valuable in view of their potential use in ITER. Unlike the limb probes, the collar probe did not pass the <b>functional</b> <b>commissioning,</b> due to an unexpected discrepancy between the signals from Hall sensors and pick-up coils. The analysis illustrated in the paper shows that a critical assessment of the local configuration and a suitable magnetic modeling solve the issue of the observed discordance, by putting it in relation with a local geometrical effect due to the peculiar shape of the ferromagnetic collar teeth. The improvement {{of magnetic}} models targeted to the prediction of signals produced by magnetic sensors is important, also considering {{that a large number of}} magnetic probes in ITER will be located close to the ferromagnetic inserts...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Migration of {{nanomaterials}} {{from food}} containers into {{food is a}} matter of concern because of the potential risk for exposed consumers. The aims of this study were to evaluate silver migration from a commercially available food packaging containing silver nanoparticles into a real food matrix (chicken meat) under plausible domestic storage conditions and to test the contribution of such packaging to limit food spoilage bacteria proliferation. Chemical analysis revealed the absence of silver in chicken meatballs under the experimental conditions in compliance with current European Union legislation, which establishes a maximum level of 0. 010 mg kg– 1 for the migration of non-authorised substances through a <b>functional</b> barrier (<b>Commission</b> Regulation (EU) No. 10 / 2011). On the other hand, microbiological tests (total microbial count, Pseudomonas spp. and Enterobacteriaceae) showed no relevant difference in the tested bacteria levels between meatballs stored in silver-nanoparticle plastic bags or control bags. This study shows the impor- tance of testing food packaging not only to verify potential silver migration as an indicator of potential nanoparticle migration, but also to evaluate the benefits in terms of food preservation so as to avoid unjustified usage of silver nanoparticles and possible negative impacts on the environment...|$|R

40|$|The {{formulation}} of innovative packaging solutions, exerting a functional antimicrobial role in slowing down food spoilage, {{is expected to}} {{have a significant impact on}} the food industry, allowing both the maintenance of food safety criteria for longer periods and the reduction of food waste. Different materials are considered able to exert the required antimicrobial activity, among which are materials containing silver. However, challenges exist in the application of silver to food contact materials due to knowledge gaps in the production of ingredients, stability of delivery systems in food matrices and health risks caused by the same properties which also offer the benefits. Aims of the present study were to test the effectiveness and suitability of two packaging systems, one of which contained silver, for packaging and storing Stracchino cheese, a typical Italian fresh cheese, and to investigate if there was any potential for consumers to be exposed to silver, via migration from the packaging to the cheese. Results did not show any significant difference in the effectiveness of the packaging systems on packaged Stracchino cheese, excluding that the active packaging systems exerted an inhibitory effect on the growth of spoilage microorganisms. Moreover, silver migrated into the cheese matrix throughout the storage time (24 days). Silver levels in cheese finally exceeded the maximum established level for the migration of a non-authorised substance through a <b>functional</b> barrier (<b>Commission</b> Regulation (EC) No. 450 / 2009). This result poses safety concerns and strongly suggests the need for more research aimed at better characterizing the new packaging materials in terms of their potential impacts on human health and the environment...|$|R
50|$|Building {{commissioning}} is a quality-focused process {{necessary for}} both non-complex and complex modern construction projects. Normally the initial commissioning {{team and a}} team leader (typically known as the commissioning authority or CA) is involved from project initiation through one year of occupancy. In many cases and ideally, there is an ongoing building enhancing and commissioning program and team {{for the life of}} the building. While the service method can vary from owner to owner and project to project, the basic formula for a successful building commissioning process involves a synergy team from pre-design to develop the owner's project requirements (OPR), commissioning scope and plan, including benchmarks for success, review of design documents and checklists for achieving the Owner's Project Requirements (OPR), development of checklists and verifying a sample of construction checklists and submittals, developing training needs and evaluating training delivered by the contractors, witnessing and verifying construction phase tests, and periodic site observations during the construction phase, and performing <b>commissioning</b> <b>functional</b> testing as the project nears completion. While the practice of building commissioning process is still fairly new in the construction industry, it has quickly become common practice as building owners and developers try to get more out of their investment.

40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{graphical}} user interface program GrafLab (GRAvity Field LABoratory) for spherical harmonic synthesis (SHS) created in MATLAB®. This program allows to comfortably compute 38 various functionals of the geopotential up to ultra-high degrees and orders of spherical harmonic expansion. For {{the most difficult part}} of the SHS, namely the evaluation of the fully normalized associated Legendre functions (fnALFs), we used three different approaches according to required maximum degree: (i) the standard forward column method (up to maximum degree 1800, in some cases up to degree 2190); (ii) the modified forward column method combined with Horner's scheme (up to maximum degree 2700); (iii) the extended-range arithmetic (up to an arbitrary maximum degree). For the maximum degree 2190, the SHS with fnALFs evaluated using the extended-range arithmetic approach takes only approximately 2 - 3 times longer than its standard arithmetic counterpart, i. e. the standard forward column method. In the GrafLab, the functionals of the geopotential can be evaluated on a regular grid or point-wise, while the input coordinates can either be read from a data file or entered manually. For the computation on a regular grid we decided to apply the lumped coefficients approach due to significant time-efficiency of this method. Furthermore, if a full variance-covariance matrix of spherical harmonic coefficients is available, it is possible to compute the commission errors of the functionals. When computing on a regular grid, the output <b>functionals</b> or their <b>commission</b> errors may be depicted on a map using automatically selected cartographic projection...|$|R
