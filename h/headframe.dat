25|$|The chief {{remaining}} {{structure is}} a wood <b>headframe</b> on Cable Mountain. The structures {{at the bottom}} of the cables consisted of snubbing posts to separate the cables. Nothing remains of the lower end of the draw works.|$|E
5000|$|In 1919, Cliffs Shaft {{engineers}} {{determined that}} the two wooden <b>headframes</b> atop their A and B shafts were deteriorating and would soon be unsafe. When Cliffs Shaft engineers presented company president William G. Mather with proposals to update the <b>headframes,</b> Mather suggested that, because of the prominence of their location, the <b>headframes</b> combine practicality with architectural beauty. [...] The company retained George Washington Maher, a Prairie School architect from Chicago's Condron Company, to design the new <b>headframes.</b> Maher {{came up with a}} distinctive obelisk-shaped, Egyptian Revival design for the <b>headframes.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Headframes</b> {{have become}} {{prominent}} features in historic mining regions. The Ruhr district of Germany and the South Wales Valleys in Britain are both examples of areas {{which are now}} associated with <b>headframes</b> due to the large number constructed to mine coal during the Industrial Revolution. Most of these <b>headframes</b> have now been removed although both regions have turned non-operating mines with <b>headframes</b> into national museums; the German Mining Museum in Bochum and Big Pit National Coal Museum in Blaenavon. Sporting teams from former coal mining regions such as Llanharan RFC and Cilfynydd RFC have <b>headframes</b> included in their club badges.|$|R
5000|$|The company {{immediately}} began building the new <b>headframes</b> {{around the old}} wooden ones. [...] The new <b>headframes</b> were of reinforced concrete, with an interior measurement of 33 ft square at the base, eventually tapering to 21 ft square at the top. A pyramidal roof brought the full height to 96 ft. [...] The structures are substantially similar, but mirror images of each other. The positions of interior beams were largely determined by available openings in the wooden <b>headframes</b> being built around. Work continued from July into December 1919.|$|R
25|$|In 1894 {{the mine}} {{was sold to}} an English company, Croydon Consols Limited (nominal capital of £100,000 in 400,000 shares), for £16,000, to be paid in instalments. The new company managed the mine well, {{straightening}} and timbering the shaft, erecting a <b>headframe</b> and introducing steel buckets in place of greenhide. In 1896 the main shaft was sunk to 380 feet (116m), making Golden Gate Consols the deepest mine on the field. In that year the mine produced 22,815 ounces of gold, which enabled the company to declare a dividend of £28,000 - in excess of profits obtained from any mine on the Croydon goldfield to that date. The following year the company undertook further sinking and produced 11,390 ounces of gold from 2,871 tons of quartz.|$|E
25|$|A good-sized mining camp {{developed}} at the site, which included a blacksmith shop, butcher shop, electric lighting, and at least 150 homes. There were four mining shafts, and a period photo of Shaft #1 shows a large enclosed <b>headframe</b> (shafthouse) tram and {{what appears to be}} a reduction works of some kind (smokestack and large building). It is said the mine produced about 100 tons of pyrite a day, and the iron sulfide was used to produce sulfuric acid, a commercially important chemical. Charlemont claims to be the first electrified town in Massachusetts, so it is possible that power was then run to the mining camp. The miners are said to have earned $12–15 per day (that claim has not been verified), which in those days was excellent pay.|$|E
500|$|In 1909, after Heinze {{abandoned}} his properties in Basin, the Butte and Superior Mining Company used buildings and machinery {{at the site}} of the Basin Reduction Works to treat zinc ore by a new process called froth flotation. Sued for patent infringement, the company shut down its Basin plant in 1912. Max Atwater, a mining engineer who had worked for Butte and Superior, obtained a license for the process and ran a smaller zinc-extraction plant in Basin from 1914 through 1918. His wife, Mary Meigs Atwater, described Basin as [...] "a mining camp, subject to recurring periods of [...] boom and bust... A tiny telephone office and a drugstore died with the end of our era of boom... Just above the town were the <b>headframe</b> of our mine, and the old mill, and the never-quite-finished skeleton of a projected smelter." ...|$|E

2500|$|The most {{prominent}} {{structure in the}} complex is the 120-foot tall steel Hiawatha Mine Number One <b>headframe,</b> dating from 1904. [...] It is the oldest surviving <b>headframe</b> in Michigan. [...] The <b>headframe</b> is a stepped configuration, about 50feet by 30feet at the base and 10feet by 10feet at the top. [...] Corrugated metal siding covers much of the <b>headframe.</b> Most of the <b>headframe</b> load is borne by a 25-foot concrete foundation pier located inside the steel framework. Also included in the complex are four single-story buildings with gable roofs, one stone and theothers frame, built in the early 20th century.|$|E
2500|$|This <b>headframe</b> is {{significant}} {{as the oldest}} remaining <b>headframe</b> in Iron County. The Caspian Mine was the most productive mine in the county from its opening in 1903 until its closing in 1937. [...] Pickands-Mather Company, the operator of the Caspian, eventually deeded the <b>headframe,</b> engine house, and the surrounding 5.5acres to the Iron County Historical and Museum Society. [...] The area now serves as the Iron County Historical Museum.|$|E
2500|$|The Caspian Mine <b>Headframe</b> is a steel mining {{building}} {{located at}} north of Caspian Road. [...] The Caspian Mine opened in 1903, {{the second of}} three mines opened by the Verona Mining Company. [...] Verona later sold the mine to the Pickands-Mather Company. [...] The original <b>headframe</b> was wooden; the current structure was built as a replacement in 1920. The <b>headframe</b> is a 106foot high steel-framed structure clad in corrugated steel siding. It is about 25feet by 10feet at the base and tapers to about 10feet by 10feet at the top. The stanchions constructed to support steel cables leading from the hoisthouse to the <b>headframe</b> are located nearby.|$|E

50|$|Patient {{registration}} {{for the head}} area has developed {{for nearly two decades}} on the same principle of combining CT scans with mechanical reference devices such as <b>headframes</b> or halo rings. But the clinical experience showed that headgear is very uncomfortable to wear and even impossible to apply on little children, because their lack of cooperation; furthermore, the <b>headframes</b> can create artifacts in preoperative data gathering, or during surgery.|$|R
2500|$|The local tourism {{industry}} {{has provided a}} much needed depth to the local economy. Star attractions include the Museum of Northern History at the Sir Harry Oakes Chateau, the Miners' Memorial, and Hockey Heritage North (an [...] interactive facility {{telling the story of}} hockey in the north). Upcoming attractions include a refurbishment of the historical Toburn <b>Headframe.</b> Event based tourism is also strong. Some of the most popular draws include a drag racing event in the summer and a national snow cross racing event in the winter.|$|E
2500|$|Work {{began in}} September 1936 by Goodfish Mining Company Limited. Mine buildings, {{consisting}} of a power house, shaft house and <b>headframe,</b> office, storehouse, cookery, bunk houses, stables, pump house and gunpowder magazine, were built. These were all of frame or log construction. The plant consisted of a 150horsepower boiler, a 17.7 m3 (625 cu ft) air compressor, a [...] wide and [...] long steam hoist, steel-sharpening equipment and three duplex pumps. A vertical, 3-compartment shaft was sunk {{to a depth of}} [...] Some [...] of surface trenching was also completed during the year. An average of 17men was employed in 1936. Douglas Briden was mine manager and the mine office was in Temagami.|$|E

5000|$|An intact steel <b>headframe</b> of {{asymmetrical}} {{design is}} located over the Urquhart shaft (...) [...] The <b>headframe,</b> occupying a hilltop position, {{is a community}} landmark and a symbol of Mount Isa Mines Limited and the City of Mount Isa. <b>Headframe</b> steelwork is attached to concrete foundations. The Urquhart <b>headframe</b> steelwork bears {{the name of the}} manufacturer, F Rodingham Iron & Steel Co Ltd., England. The concrete mounts of the original development <b>headframe</b> winding plant survive beneath the main structure. As the former main ore haulage shaft, the <b>headframe</b> is equipped with a large steel ore bin, which emptied directly into a primary crusher. The jaw crusher plant has been removed but the concrete structure of the crusher remains. From here the ore was conveyed to the three No.1 Concentrator mills.|$|E

50|$|The {{belltower}} {{is framed}} and cross-braced in substantial timber members. Its construction {{is reminiscent of}} the mining <b>headframes</b> of the area, and similar to the bell tower of St Columba's Catholic Church further along High Street, which is believed to be of later construction. The belltower has a corrugated iron bellcast pyramid roof, mounted by a finial. It houses two large bells.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} has aesthetic merit {{as a simple}} brick church with Gothic detailing including a steeply pitched roof and lancet windows. The substantial timber bell tower is a prominent element of the streetscape and reminiscent {{of the construction of}} mine <b>headframes</b> once common in the area. The juxtaposition of the two distinct and unusual elements contributes to the aesthetic interest of the site.|$|R
50|$|The first {{stereotactic}} {{device for}} humans was also developed in neurosurgery, by E. Spiegel and H. Wycis in 1947. It {{was used for}} surgical treatment of Parkinson's disease and, during time, its applicability was extended for the surgical treatment of tumors, vascular malformations, functional neurosurgery etc. The system was based both on <b>headframes</b> and X-ray images taken for all three planes of space.|$|R
