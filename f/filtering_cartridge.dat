With this test method comparative statements can be made concerning the rinseup behaviour, the particle retentina and the reaction of <b>filter</b> <b>cartridges</b> on pressure shocks.

At low salt simulant conditions, the instantaneous decontamination factor (D{sub F}) for Sr- 85 with MST impregnated <b>filter</b> membrane <b>cartridges</b> measured 26, representing 96 % Sr- 85 removal efficiency. On the other hand, the Sr- 85 instantaneous D{sub F} with co-sintered active MST cartridges measured 40 or 98 % Sr- 85 removal efficiency. Strontium- 85 removal with the MST impregnated membrane cartridges and CST impregnated membrane cartridges, placed in series arrangement, produced an instantaneous decontamination factor of 41 compared to an instantaneous decontamination factor of 368 for strontium- 85 with co-sintered active MST cartridges and co-sintered active CST cartridges placed in series. Overall, polyethylene co-sintered active titanates cartridges performed as well as titanate impregnated <b>filter</b> membrane <b>cartridges</b> in the uptake of strontium.

40|$|Porous {{titanium}} {{is a new}} {{structural and}} functional material. It is widely used in many fields since it integrates the properties of biomaterials with those of metallic foam. A new technology that combines both the preparation and forming of porous materials has been proposed in this paper. Moreover, a new solder was developed that could be employed in the joining of porous materials. Influencing factors for microstructure and mechanical properties of the parent material and joint interface are identified. Metal injection molding (MIM) technology was used for fabricating porous materials. The feedstock for injection molding of porous titanium powders was prepared from titanium powders and a polymer-based binder system. In addition, the proportion of powder loading and binders was optimized. Through MIM technology, a porous titanium <b>filter</b> <b>cartridge</b> was prepared. For the purpose of investigating the thermal debinding technology of the <b>filter</b> <b>cartridge,</b> effects of the sintering temperature on the porosity, morphology of micropores and mechanical properties were analyzed. It could be found that when the sintering temperature increased, the relative density, bending and compression strength of the components also increased. Moreover, the porosity reached 32. 28 % when the sintering temperature was 1000 °C. The microstructure morphology indicated that micropores connected with each other. Meanwhile, {{the strength of the}} components was relatively high, i. e., the bending and compression strength was 65 and 60 MPa, respectively. By investigating the joining technology of porous <b>filter</b> <b>cartridges,</b> the ideal components of the solder and pressure were determined.

40|$|A {{large amount}} of radiocesium was {{released}} from the accident at Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant of Tokyo Electric Power Company. The determination of dissolved and particulate radiocesium concentrations in water is important, which can be used as basic information for understanding the long-term radiocesium dynamics in the environment and the transfer of radiocesium to crops. Conventional quantitative methods include the evaporative concentration to the dryness method and the AMP method. These methods need to concentrate about 20 – 200 L of water due to the low concentration of the dissolved radiocesium. After the accident, several new methods, such as the Prussian blue <b>filter</b> <b>cartridge</b> method and the solid-phase disk method, have been developed and put to practical use.

40|$|AUTORAMP, {{designed}} and {{developed at the}} Environmental Measurements Laboratory (EML), is a completely automatic, field deployable system that performs sampling and gamma-ray spectrometry analyses of <b>filter</b> <b>cartridges.</b> However, for certain measurement applications such as airborne plutonium, gamma-ray analysis alone does not suffice. Plutonium cannot be detected by gamma-ray analysis, but is detectable with alpha analysis. This paper describes the initial research towards giving the AUTORAMP the dual capability of both alpha and gamma measurements. Because of the geometry used in the AUTORAMP cartridge, the only compatible alpha analysis involves the measurement of the ionization produced by an alpha particle as its energy is adsorbed in air. Although this type of alpha measurement has been done before, the associated technology is difficult and requires many of the techniques used in the measurement of currents at the fempto-amp (10 - 15) level. Fortunately, EML pioneered MOSFET (metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor) technology at currents in the atto-amp (10 - 18) region, and is, therefore, uniquely qualified for this research. The paper presents the results obtained from the initial chambers and electronic circuits for gross alpha counting and for alpha spectrometry analysis.
