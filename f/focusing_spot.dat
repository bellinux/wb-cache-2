40|$|Titanium dioxide (TiO 2) {{film has}} {{photocatalytic}} properties and good biocompatibility. To ex-pand the film application, formation of oxygen {{deficiencies in the}} film {{was one of the}} useful meth-ods. Electrical resistance of the film can be decreased due to oxygen deficiencies formation. The lo-cal heating process in vacuum is a useful method to create the oxygen deficiencies in local area of the film. Electrical resistance might be locally decreased by local heating with a CW fiber laser. In our experiment, the films were irradiated with the laser in vacuum. Control of temperature on the film was very important for reducing the electrical resistance. Therefore, temperature monitoring of the laser <b>focusing</b> <b>spot</b> area on the film was performed. Temperature of the laser <b>focusing</b> <b>spot</b> area was increased as the laser intensity was increased. Then, the electrical resistance of the laser focus-ing spot area was decreased as the laser intensity was increased. Thus, electrical resistance of the la-ser <b>focusing</b> <b>spot</b> area was decreased as temperature of the laser <b>focusing</b> <b>spot</b> area was increased. These results indicated that electrical resistance of the laser <b>focusing</b> <b>spot</b> area was controlled by changing temperature on the laser <b>focusing</b> <b>spot</b> area...|$|E

30|$|The focused LEF {{is formed}} to a dense bright spot and several weaker side lobes {{in the central}} region of the PL either with 632.8 or 532  nm illumination.

For 632.8 -nm illuminations, the full width at half maximum of the <b>focusing</b> <b>spot</b> is about 170  nm in the x-axis direction, beyond the diffraction limit. It is further demonstrated that the induced electric field is more confined in the x-direction than in the y-direction.

While under the green laser illumination, there is about 30 -nm deviation of the position of the spot along the x-axis.

40|$|AbstractIn {{comparison}} with high-speed cutting and electrical discharge machining, laser milling {{is the most}} universal method for shaping of any type of materials (including natural and artificial diamonds, alloys etc.).

The main reason for the low quality of milling of super-hard materials is uncontrollable surface roughness that is formed when liquid phase is expelled from the hole that is formed under the influence of laser beam. The height of micro-roughness of the processed surface is equal to the thickness of the removed layer.
