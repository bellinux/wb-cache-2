A PELV circuit, just as with SELV, requires a design that guarantees a low risk of accidental contact with a higher voltage.

50|$|A {{way to stop}} {{spreading}} of {{the flame}} over the material {{is to create a}} thermal <b>insulation</b> <b>barrier</b> between the burning and unburned parts. Intumescent additives are often employed; their role is to turn the polymer surface into a char, which separates the flame from the material and slows the heat transfer to the unburned fuel. Non-halogenated inorganic and organic phosphate flame retardants typically act through this mechanism by generating a polymeric layer of charred phosphoric acid.|$|E
50|$|Alternative {{isolators}} {{are typically}} built using ultra thin (0.01 mm - 0.02 mm) insulation layers, whereas optocouplers have insulation thicknesses up to 2 mm. The thinner <b>insulation</b> <b>barrier</b> means that alternative isolators experience much higher electric-field stress than optocouplers, {{and could be}} less robust under high voltages. Currently, there are no IEC component level safety standard available for such isolators. As a result, some manufacturers might seek IEC 60747-5-2 (older revision) or IEC 60747-5-5 (current revision) certification (a standard originally intended for optocouplers). Alternative isolators are structurally different from optocouplers and thus do not qualify for full IEC60747-5-2/5 certification, but only for BASIC insulation.|$|E

30|$|The {{weight or}} {{thickness}} of a nonwoven fabric is reported by a term called loft. Highlofts have low density {{with a greater}} volume of air than fiber. Generally, highlofts with a thickness ranging from 7 [*]mm to 51 [*]mm and a basis weight of 75 [*]g/m 2 to 375 [*]g/m 2 are preferred for soft furnishing applications. When exposed to an open flame ignition source, highloft barrier materials containing char-forming fibers form a thick char that blocks the flow of oxygen and volatile decomposition gases and also slows heat transfer by creating an effective thermal <b>insulation</b> <b>barrier</b> ([Hendermann & Bridges 2006]). Highloft high porosity structures also inhibit flame spread.

The reasons are the advantages {{in the area}} of ecological compatibility and resource-saving provision. The intention to use ester-based insulation fluids in high voltage direct current (HVDC) equipment is new.

Despite environmentally friendliness has become an issue of paramount importance, the use of natural fibers has some limitations, especially when high temperature exposure is concerned.

40|$|Slender {{boiler tubes}} {{are subject to}} {{localised}} swelling when they are expose to excessive heat. The latter {{is due to the}} formation of an oxide layer, which acts as an <b>insulation</b> <b>barrier.</b> This excessive heat can lead to microstructural changes in the material that would reduce the mechanical strength and would eventually lead to critical and catastrophic failure. Detecting such creep damage remains a formidable challenge for boiler operators. It involves a costly process of shutting down the plant, performing electromagnetic and ultrasonic non-destructive inspection, repairing or replacing damaged tubes and finally restarting the plant to resume its service. This research explores through a model developed using a finite element computer simulation platform the thermal behaviour of slender tubes under constant temperature exceeding 723 °K. Our simulation results demonstrate that hematite layers up to 15 μm thickness inside the tubes do not act as insulation.

40|$|Liquid Nitrogen (LN 2) {{has been}} used as a coolant as well as a part of the {{insulation}} system in High Temperature Superconducting power apparatus. In recent decades,there has been scientific research into the pre-breakdown phenomena in this liquid. The focus of previous studies is on streamer behavior and their governing mechanisms. However, research into the characterization of partial discharge patterns in a composite insulation of liquid nitrogen and solid dielectrics has not been widely reported. This paper presents a characterization of partial discharges in LN 2 under AC voltages by the means of phase resolved analysis. The results suggest that discharges in a LN 2 /solid insulation system occur primarily in the first and third quadrant of the applied voltage waveform due to charge storage effects. Partial Discharge (PD) pulses were also observed before the zero crossing of the waveform under higher electric stress. The conditions under which density change streamers cross a LN 2 gap and reach the solid <b>insulation</b> <b>barrier</b> are also discussed. Different PD patterns were observed for different solid dielectric barriers indicating the effects of the solid/liquid interface on the behavior of discharges in point-plane composite systems at cryogenic temperature...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{applications of}} High Temperature Superconductors (HTS) require {{the understanding of}} dielectric behavior at cryogenic temperature. Liquid dielectrics such as liquid nitrogen (LN 2) {{have the ability to}} recover after discharges provided that efficient cooling is available. However, partial discharge streamers during the pre-breakdown phenomena in LN 2 can significantly erode solid insulation. This damage is irreversible and degrades the solid dielectric, therefore, affecting the reliability of the insulation system. The paper investigates the erosion phenomena of cryogenic solid dielectrics caused by partial discharges in LN 2 under AC applied voltages. The experiment set-up consists of a sharp tungsten point and a solid <b>insulation</b> <b>barrier</b> on top of a planar electrode. The materials investigated were polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and glass fiber reinforced plastic (GRP). Partial discharges were measured during the tests following IEC 60720 standard and streamer channels were recorded using a high speed camera.

The as-milled powders and the extruded materials were studied using X-ray diffraction, optical microscopy, scanning and transmission electron microscopy and microhardness measurements. Also, the TEM observation of the extruded sample indicates a mean grain size of about 50 nm. This evidences a higher thermal stability of the as-milled powders and the advantage of using a fast consolidation process, at a relatively low temperature. Therefore, the consolidated material did not show the dramatic softening associated with recrystallization. The consolidation of nanostructured copper-copper nitride composite powders via warm extrusion, without major grain coarsening, was demonstrated...|$|R

In practice, an economical mixture satisfying the hydraulic requirements is generally concerned. First, in order to get an adequate dune sand–bentonite mixture compacted to the optimum Proctor condition, an investigation on saturated hydraulic behavior is carried out in this study for different mixtures. Using oedometer test (indirect measurement), the adequate mixture of 85 % dune sand and 15 % bentonite satisfies the conditions of saturated hydraulic conductivity (k    3  MPa). This technique is conducted based on the exploitation of the water retention curve in order to establish the relationships between hydraulic conductivity, degree of saturation, and suction. It shows that the hydraulic conductivity increases with the degree of saturation and decreases with the suction. However, the hydraulic conductivity has a constant value for suctions larger than 20  MPa. The selected dune sand–bentonite mixture satisfies the regulation requirements and hence constitutes a good local and economical material for the conception of barrier base liners...|$|R
