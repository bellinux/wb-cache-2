Nonfood products include essential oils, natural dyes, pigments, waxes, resins, tannins, alkaloids, amber and cork. Products derived from plants include soaps, shampoos, perfumes, cosmetics, paint, varnish, turpentine, rubber, latex, lubricants, linoleum, plastics, inks, and gums. Renewable fuels from plants include firewood, peat and other biofuels. The fossil fuels coal, petroleum and natural gas are derived from the remains of aquatic organisms including phytoplankton in geological time.|$|E

The river's predictability and the fertile soil allowed the Egyptians to build an empire {{on the basis of}} great agricultural wealth. Egyptians were among the first peoples to practice agriculture on a large scale, starting in the pre-dynastic period {{from the end of the}} Paleolithic into the Neolithic, between around 10,000 and 4,000 BC. This was made possible with the development of basin irrigation. Their staple food crops were grains such as wheat and barley, alongside <b>industrial</b> <b>crops</b> such as flax and papyrus.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} biodiversity of <b>industrial</b> <b>crop</b> in Iran, an investigation was made {{based on the}} statistical data available on acreage and production of this crop in the country. Cultivated area of <b>industrial</b> <b>crop</b> from 29 provinces were analyzed and Shannon biodiversity index was calculated. The highest biodiversity index compare to the total crop species was observed in Golestan, Semnan and Isfehan. Higher biodiversity in these provinces is due to higher cultivated area for potato, sugar beet, cotton, tobacco, and oil crop. The lowest biodiversity was observed for Sistan and Balochestan and also Ilam provinces. In these tow provinces, only potato, oil crop and tobacco were cultivated. Cluster analysis for the ratio of cultivated area for the functional group to total <b>industrial</b> <b>crop</b> acreage in different provinces showed that at % 75 similarity level, Golestan, Ghom, Mazandaran, Kohkiloueh were located on one group and Azarbijan, Kermanshah, Ilam and Khozestan were located in other group.

50|$|Egyptians {{relied on}} {{agriculture}} {{for more than}} just the production of food. They were creative in their use of plants, using them for medicine, as part of their religious practices, and in the production of clothing. Herbs perhaps had the most varied purposes; they were used in cooking, medicine, as cosmetics and in the process of embalming. Over 2000 different species of flowering or aromatic plants have been found in tombs. Papyrus was an extremely versatile crop that grew wild and was also cultivated. The roots of the plant were eaten as food, but it was primarily used as an <b>industrial</b> <b>crop.</b> The stem of the plant was used to make boats, mats and paper. Flax was another important <b>industrial</b> <b>crop</b> that had several uses. Its primary use was in the production of rope, and for linen which was the Egyptians' principal material for making their clothing. Henna was grown for the production of dye.|$|R

2500|$|For Mustafa Kemal, {{as for his}} supporters, tobacco {{remained}} {{wedded to}} his policy {{in the pursuit of}} economic independence. Turkish tobacco was an important <b>industrial</b> <b>crop,</b> while its cultivation and manufacture had been French monopolies under capitulations of the Ottoman Empire. The tobacco and cigarette trade was controlled by two French companies: the [...] "Regie Company" [...] and [...] "Narquileh Tobacco". The Ottoman Empire had given the tobacco monopoly to the Ottoman Bank as a limited company under the [...] "Council of the Public Debt". Regie, as part of the Council of the Public Debt, had control over production, storing, and distribution (including export) with an unchallenged price control. Consequently, Turkish farmers were dependent on the company for their livelihood. In 1925, this company was taken over by the state and named [...] "Tekel". The control of tobacco was the biggest achievement of the Kemalist political machinery's [...] "nationalization" [...] of the economy for a country that did not produce oil. They accompanied this achievement with the development of the cotton industry, which peaked during the early 1930s. Cotton was the second biggest <b>industrial</b> <b>crop</b> in Turkey at the time.|$|R
