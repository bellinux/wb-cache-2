40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} enlarge the {{operating}} range at HCCI (Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition) mode and explore the scientific methods to realize the ultra-low emission with DME（ Dimethyl Ether）as alternative fuel. Experimental investigation on the realization of PCCI-DI (Partial Premixed Charge Compression Ignition – Direct Injection) combustion is carried out on a single cylinder and naturally aspirated direct injection diesel engine. The method to achieve the PCCI-DI mode is that feeding part of DME into intake pipe to produce Pre-mixed homogeneous mixture and injecting {{the other part of}} the DME fuel into the combustion chamber by the original <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>device</b> in the late stage of compression stroke. Results indicate that the engine can be operated at a wider range of speeds and loads at PCCI-DI mode. The brake thermal efficiency increases and NOx emission reduces. However, HC and CO emission increase. It is also indicated from experiments that NOx, HC and CO emission increase with an increase of DME premixed quantity.

5000|$|In 1874, George Brayton {{developed}} and patented a 2 stroke, oil fueled constant pressure engine [...] "The Ready Motor". This engine used a metered pump to supply <b>fuel</b> to an <b>injection</b> <b>device</b> {{in which the}} oil was vaporized by air and burned as it entered the cylinder. These {{were some of the}} first practical internal combustion engines to supply motive power. Brayton's engines were installed in several boats, a rail car, 2 submarines and a bus.

40|$|The {{high-level}} {{goal of this}} multi-year {{effort was}} to facilitate the Advanced Combustion Engine goal of 20 % improvement (compared to 2009 baseline) of commercial engine efficiency by 2015. A sub-goal {{is to increase the}} reliability of diesel fuel injectors by investigating modelbased scenarios that cannot be achieved by empirical, trial and error methodologies alone. During this three-year project, ORNL developed the methodology to evaluate origins and to record the initiation and propagation of fatigue cracks emanating from holes that were electrodischarge machined (EDM), the method used to form spray holes in fuel injector tips. Both x-ray and neutron-based methods for measuring residual stress at four different research facilities were evaluated to determine which, if any, was most applicable to the fuel injector tip geometry. Owing to the shape and small volumes of material involved in the sack area, residual stress data could only be obtained in the walls of the nozzle a few millimeters back from the tip, and there was a hint of only a small compressive stress. This result was consistent with prior studies by Caterpillar. Residual stress studies were suspended after the second year, reserving the possibility of pursuing this in the future, if and when methodology suitable for injector sacks becomes available. The smooth specimen fatigue behavior of current fuel injector steel materials was evaluated and displayed a dual mode initiation behavior. At high stresses, cracks started at machining flaws in the surface; however, below a critical threshold stress of approximately 800 MPa, cracks initiated in the bulk microstructure, below the surface. This suggests that for the next generation for high-pressure fuel injector nozzles, it becomes increasingly important to control the machining and finishing processes, especially if the stress in the tip approaches or exceeds that threshold level. Fatigue tests were also conducted using EDM notches in the gage sections. Compared to the smooth specimens, EDM notching led to a severe reduction in total fatigue life. A reduction in fatigue life of nearly four orders of magnitude can occur at an EDM notch the approximate size of fuel injector spray holes. Consequently, the initiation and propagation behavior of cracks from small spray holes is relevant for generation of design quality data for the next generation diesel <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>devices.</b> This is especially true since the current design methodologies usually rely on the less conservative smooth specimen fatigue testing results, and since different materials can have varying levels of notch fatigue resistance...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} the <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> ratio on the {{combustion}} and emission characteristics of stratified lean mixture combustion was investigated for a spray-guided liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) direct injection engine. Inter-injection spark-ignition combustion—a specially designed combustion strategy for LPG fuel derived from a two-staged injection—was employed to maximize the improvement in thermal efficiency when combustion stability is secured. When changing the <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> ratio, the optimum spark advance and <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> timings were experimentally determined to maximize the thermal efficiency based on sweeping timings. The optimum <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> ratio with the highest thermal efficiency (42. 76 %) and stable operation was 60 %/ 40 %, with the optimization of the spark advance and <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> timing, because of the locally rich mixture region in the recirculation zone.

40|$|The {{potential}} of lean burn in a spark-ignition (SI) engine with optimized <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> was experimentally investigated and numerically simulated. The experiments {{were carried out}} on a production SI engine which has a port <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> (PFI) system. The previous port electronic <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> system was modified and the technique of double-pulse <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> (DFI) was employed. By regulating injection timings and proportions of DFI, the air-fuel mixture stratification was significantly improved and the expected lean burn was implemented.

The mixture in the cylinder was divided into different regions that distribute spherically around the spark plug and consist of a central region of stoichiometric air-fuel mixture and a gradually leaner outside region.

40|$|The inner {{diameter}} of {{high pressure fuel}} pipe has {{a significant effect on}} the <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> process and the performance of a diesel engine. The spray impact force of each nozzle hole of a conventional injection system of pump-line-nozzle for diesel engine (based on the spray momentum flux) and the injection pressure (on a <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> pump test rig) were measured. With varying <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> quantities and pump speed, the effects of the {{inner diameter}} of the high pressure fuel pipe on <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> process and the <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> characteristics of each nozzle hole were analyzed. It was noted from experimental results that the <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> pressure changes with variations in the inner diameter of the high pressure fuel pipe and also the injection duration gradually increases with increase in the inner diameter. At low injection pump speed, even with the same geometric fuel deliver rate, the injection duration also increases gradually. Due to throttling effect and reduction in <b>injection</b> pressure, the <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> quantities of the injection nozzle were relatively minimal when the inner diameters of the high pressure fuel pipe were respectively small and large. The optimum injection pipe inner diameter for the right quantity for <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> falls between the two cases (between small and large).
