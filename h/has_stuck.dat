25|$|Many years later, in 1855, an English Quaker named William Howitt {{published}} a popular history of Australia. Like many teetotallers, he was keen to blame alcohol {{for all the}} problems in the world. Howitt took Bligh's side and invented the phrase Rum Rebellion, and it <b>has</b> <b>stuck</b> ever since.|$|E
25|$|The {{community}} of Dhahran {{is composed of}} two sections: Dhahran main camp and Dhahran Hills. These two sections are separated by Dhahran's 18-hole Rolling Hills golf course and club house. The term 'camp' <b>has</b> <b>stuck</b> with Dhahran and the other communities, since its early development in the 1930s and 1940s. However, in reality, Dhahran is a community with tree-lined streets, stone houses and grass lawns.|$|E

25|$|This {{outstanding}} Gothic {{bridge was}} not actually {{built at the}} time of the tournament and even the previous bridge, originally located 100 yards further up the river, had been in place for at least 25 years {{at the time of}} the tournament. The label Tournament Bridge <b>has</b> <b>stuck,</b> despite the inaccuracy. Contemporary engravings and paintings show that it was however heavily embellished with Gothic additions for the event and possibly an ornamental archway.|$|E
25|$|The Babylonian Talmud {{discusses}} {{two types}} of washing at meals: washing before a meal is described as first waters (the Hebrew term is mayim rishonim), and after a meal is known as last waters (the Hebrew term is mayim aharonim). The first term has generally fallen from contemporary usage; the second term <b>has</b> <b>stuck.</b> The modern term for the former is Ntillat yadayim, washing of hands. Washing before meals is normative in Orthodox Judaism.|$|E
25|$|Other {{influential}} exhibitions {{include the}} 1989 {{opening of the}} Wexner Center for the Arts in Columbus, designed by Peter Eisenman. The New York exhibition has featured works by Frank Gehry, Daniel Libeskind, Rem Koolhaas, Peter Eisenman, Zaha Hadid, Coop Himmelb(l)au, and Bernard Tschumi. Since their exhibitions, some architects associated with Deconstructivism have distanced themselves from it; nonetheless, the term <b>has</b> <b>stuck</b> and has come to embrace a general trend within contemporary architecture.|$|E

25|$|British railway {{signalling}} {{is unusual}} in that it employs the direction signalling philosophy, rather than that of speed signalling; in other words, a driver is informed of which route he will take at a junction, rather than {{the speed at which}} he should travel through it. This probably stems from the early days of railways when points and signals were not interlocked, and it was therefore important for a driver to know whether the points had been correctly set for him or not, and <b>has</b> <b>stuck</b> ever since.|$|E
25|$|Today {{the federal}} {{government}} <b>has</b> <b>stuck</b> with modernist simplicity for its functional buildings, but has turned again to monumental architecture for projects of national significance. Most notable are the three museums that have {{been built in the}} national capital over the last three decades. The new homes of the Canadian Museum of Civilization, National Gallery of Canada, and the Canadian War Museum are unique examples of postmodern architecture. All cost vast amounts of money, but they have also met with international acclaim. They also have allowed the capital to become a showcase for buildings by three of Canada's most prominent architects: Moshe Safdie, Douglas Cardinal, and Raymond Moriyama.|$|E
25|$|Tajin Chico is a {{multilevel}} {{portion of}} the site that stretches north-northwest from the older {{parts of the city}} up a hill. Much of this section was created by using massive amounts of landfill. It is an immense acropolis composed of numerous palaces and other civil structures. There are relatively few temples here. It is also more easily defended than other parts of the city. Tajin Chico is so named because it was initially thought to be a separate but related site. It is now known that it belonged {{to the center of the}} city. However, as the term was already in the literature about the site, it <b>has</b> <b>stuck.</b>|$|E

25|$|On 3 May 2015, The Economist {{published}} a report outlining Pakistan's economic performance. It highlighted that Pakistan's economic performance {{said that the}} economy will grow by 4.7% next year, the fastest rate in eight years. Consumer prices rose by 2.5% in between January to March 2015, the smallest increase {{for more than a}} decade. Twice already this year the central bank has lowered its benchmark interest rate. It said that the government of Nawaz Sharif takes some credit for the economy's new stability. It <b>has</b> <b>stuck</b> to an IMF programme agreed to in 2013, a few months after it came to power in Pakistan's first-ever handover from one civilian government to another. Foreign-exchange reserves have more than doubled, to $17.7billion.|$|E
25|$|In the Soviet Union, {{sparkling}} wine was produced {{under the name}} Soviet Champagne, or Sovetskoye Shampanskoye, most of it sweet. This designation continues {{to be used for}} {{sparkling wine}} produced in several countries formerly part of the Soviet Union, including Armenia, Belarus, Moldova, Russia and Ukraine. Most likely, the name <b>has</b> <b>stuck</b> since Sovetskoye Shampanskoye {{was one of the few}} products or brands of the Soviet era which were seen as luxurious. Often the names have been altered to fit the exact country, e.g. Armenian Champagne. Nowadays, it is more common to encounter Sovetskoye Shampanskoye produced in a dry or semi-dry style. The products have some international popularity, thus Russian made dry and semi-dry versions can be found in the European markets and Moldovan made semi-sweet version from Muscat grapes has been regularly available in the U.S.|$|E
25|$|In 1776, the Continental Congress {{authorized}} {{plans to}} produce a silver coin {{to prop up the}} rapidly failing Continentalâ€”the first attempt by the fledgling U.S. at paper currency. Several examples were struck in brass, pewter, and silver, but a circulating coin was not produced, {{due in large part to}} the financial difficulties of running the Revolutionary War. The Continental Dollar bears a date of 1776, and while its true denomination is not known, it is generally the size of later dollars, and the name <b>has</b> <b>stuck.</b> The failure of the Continental exacerbated a distrust of paper money among both politicians and the populace at large. The letters of Thomas Jefferson indicate that he wished the United States to eschew paper money and instead mint coins of similar perceived value and worth to those foreign coins circulating at the time.|$|E

25|$|While the theorem {{that now}} {{bears his name}} was known and {{previously}} utilised by the Babylonians and Indians, he, or his students, are often said to have constructed the first proof. It must, however, be stressed that {{the way in which}} the Babylonians handled Pythagorean numbers implies that they knew that the principle was generally applicable, and knew some kind of proof, which has not yet been found in the (still largely unpublished) cuneiform sources. Because of the secretive nature of his school and the custom of its students to attribute everything to their teacher, there is no evidence that Pythagoras himself worked on or proved this theorem. For that matter, there is no evidence that he worked on any mathematical or meta-mathematical problems. Some attribute it as a carefully constructed myth by followers of Plato over two centuries after the death of Pythagoras, mainly to bolster the case for Platonic meta-physics, which resonate well with the ideas they attributed to Pythagoras. This attribution <b>has</b> <b>stuck</b> down the centuries up to modern times. The earliest known mention of Pythagoras's name in connection with the theorem occurred five centuries after his death, in the writings of Cicero and Plutarch.|$|E

[...] Another suggestion for the small figures are that they are the daughters of the hero Pandareus who were carried away to become the Furies.|$|E
500|$|Reportedly {{the result}} of a {{fraudulent}} investment scheme by a confidence man, the Newby-McMahon Building was a source of great embarrassment to the city and its residents after its completion in 1919. During the 1920s, the Newby-McMahon Building was featured in Robert Ripley's Ripley's Believe It or Not! syndicated column as [...] "the world's littlest skyscraper", a nickname that <b>has</b> <b>stuck</b> with it ever since. The Newby-McMahon Building is now part of the Depot Square Historic District of Wichita Falls, a Texas Historic Landmark.|$|E

500|$|Upon its {{completion}} and opening in 1919, the Newby-McMahon Building {{was an immediate}} source of great embarrassment {{to the city and}} its residents. The ground floor had six desks representing the six different companies that occupied the building as its original tenants. Throughout most of the 1920s, the building housed only two firms. During the 1920s, the Newby-McMahon Building was featured in Robert Ripley's Ripley's Believe It or Not! syndicated column as [...] "the world's littlest skyscraper", which is a name that <b>has</b> <b>stuck</b> with it ever since.|$|E

He prefers to employ a 4â€“3â€“3 formation, explaining it allows his teams to play entertaining football and makes them hard to beat, and it brought him success when at Tamworth and York. He <b>has</b> <b>stuck</b> with this formation despite charges from some of being tactically stubborn, saying: [...] "I'm not going to change the way my teams play, the systems. I've not even had a thought about that".|$|E
500|$|Michael Lewis's 2003 best-seller [...] {{focuses on}} Oakland Athletics' General Manager Billy Beane's use of Sabermetrics {{as a tool}} in the {{evaluation}} of potential prospects. In the book, Lewis discusses then-prospect Youkilis in detail, and refers to him as [...] "Euclis, the Greek God of Walks", a moniker that <b>has</b> <b>stuck.</b> Beane put more stock in empirical evidence than in scouts' hunches, and did not care that Youkilis was pudgy (or, as Lewis put it in the book, [...] "a fat third baseman who couldn't run, throw, or field"), but just loved his ability to get on base (helped in no small part by his 20/11 vision). The book brought minor leaguer Youkilis his first national recognition.|$|E
