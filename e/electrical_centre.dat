40|$|This paper {{discusses}} potential extreme scenarios {{which could}} result in unstable conditions on the main interconnected electricity transmission system of Oman. Case studies on loss-of-stability scenarios between {{different parts of the}} network are examined. The objectives of the study are to identify possible locations of the <b>electrical</b> <b>centre</b> of swing and to develop an approach for controllable system splitting. A controllable splitting approach has been proposed and sensitivity analysis has been utilised to identify potential locations for controllable system splitting. In the final recommendations, trade-off considerations should compare the introduction of a system-wide out-of-step protection framework and its associated potential complications versus alternatives (e. g. improved protection performance) ...|$|E
40|$|The Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) {{requires}} a low emittance beam transport and preservation, thus a precise {{control of the}} beam orbit along up to 50 km of the accelerator components in the sub-μm regime is required.

The aim, at these universities and laboratories, is to achieve an accelerating gradient in excess of 50 MV/m in 9 -cell superconducting cavities whilst maintaining a high quality and stable electron beam. At these gradients, electrical breakdown is an important cause for concern and the wakefields excited by the energetic electron beams are also potentially damaging to the beam's emittance.

40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with the generation of sensitivity maps in electrical capacitance tomography based on the concepts of <b>electrical</b> field <b>centre</b> lines. <b>Electrical</b> capacitance tomography systems are normalized at the upper and lower permittivity values for image reconstruction. Conventional normalization assumes the distribution of materials in parallel and results in normalized capacitance as a linear function of measured capacitance. A recent approach is the usage of a series sensor model which results in normalized capacitance as a nonlinear function of measured capacitance. In this study different forms of normalizations are combined with sensitivity maps based on <b>electrical</b> field <b>centre</b> lines and it is shown that a mix of two normalization models improves the reconstruction performance...|$|R
40|$|In a {{freehand}} 3 D ultrasound system, a {{probe calibration}} {{is required to}} find the rigid body transformation {{from the corner of}} the B-scan to the <b>electrical</b> <b>centre</b> of the position sensor. The most intuitive way to perform such a calibration is by locating fiducial points in the scan plane directly with a stylus. The main problem of using this approach is the difficulty in aligning the tip of the stylus with the scan plane. The thick beam width makes the tip of the stylus visible in the B-scan even if the tip is not exactly in the elevational centre of the scan plane. In this paper, we present two novel phantoms that simplify the alignment process for more accurate probe calibration. We also compare our calibration techniques with a range of styli and show that our phantom outperforms other approaches in both accuracy and simplicity. ...|$|E
40|$|The CLIC linear {{collider}} aims at accelerating multiple {{bunches of}} electrons and positrons and colliding {{them at a}} centre of mass energy of 3 TeV. These bunches will be accelerated through X-band linacs, operating at an accelerating frequency of 12 GHz. Each beam readily excites wake-fields within the accelerating cavities of each linac. The transverse components of the wake-fields, if left unchecked, can dilute the beam emittance. The present CLIC design relies on heavy damping of these wake-fields in order to ameliorate {{the effects of the}} wake-fields on the beam emittance. Here we present initial results on simulations of the long-range wake-fields in these structures and on beam dynamics simulations. In particular, detailed simulations are performed, on emittance dilution due to beams initially injected with realistic offsets from the <b>electrical</b> <b>centre</b> of the cavities.

40|$|Faculty of Engineering and the Built Environment; School of Electrical and Information Engineering; MSC DissertationIn {{the recent}} past the Eskom network {{operated}} out-of-step at three occasions. Eskom questions whether the out-of-step relays responded as they should have. This {{is based on the}} fact that not all the out-of-step relays operated during these events. This dissertation shows that shunts can make the impedance locus behave nonclassically to the extent that the present practices Eskom uses for out-of-step relaying become inappropriate for application at certain busbars of the network. This is illustrated by showing that when the characteristic of the relay at Hydra, situated on the Mpumalanga side of Hydra, is set using the classical approach, the mentioned relay will not detect swings that have their <b>electrical</b> <b>centre</b> south of Hydra. A modified two generator model is used to show the effect shunts have. The phrase “improved two generator model” refers to this model.

40|$|To {{achieve a}} high {{accelerating}} gradient of 100  MV/m, the CLIC project under study at CERN uses a 23  cm long tapered normal-conducting travelling wave Accelerating Structure (AS) operating at 12  GHz. Minimisation of the long-range wakefields (WF) is assured by damping of the HOM through four radial waveguides in each cell without distorting the accelerating mode. As {{an extension of}} them, there are four bent waveguides called WF monitors (WFM) in the middle cell with two RF pick-ups. To obtain a small beam emittance in the collision point, micro-metric pre-alignment of the AS is required. We work to find the <b>electrical</b> <b>centre</b> of the AS {{through the use of}} the asymmetry in the RF scattering parameters created by an off-centre conductive wire, stretched along the axis.

40|$|For the Compact LInear Collider (CLIC) {{project at}} CERN, {{maintaining}} low emittance beams, {{as they are}} transported along the two independent 10 - 20 km long main linacs, is crucial. The beam trajectory therefore {{has to be very}} well aligned to the magnetic centre of the quadrupole magnets. A series of microwave cavity beam position monitors (BPM) is foreseen to detect the position of the beam along the main linacs to precisely monitor the beam trajectory in the circular beam pipe of only 8 mm diameter. The PACMAN project aims to demonstrate the pre-alignment of the magnetic field of a main CLIC quadrupole with the electro-magnetic centre of a 15 GHz RF-BPM to the required sub-micron accuracy. This paper focuses on stretched-wire measurements of a CLIC Test Facility (CTF) cavity BPM, to locate its <b>electrical</b> <b>centre.</b> Details of two measurement methods are discussed: RF signal excitation of the wire and analysis of RF signal transfer through the slot-coupled waveguides of the cavity, using the stretched wire as a passive target.

40|$|To {{monitor the}} {{position}} of the electron beam during transport from the Booster Synchrotron to the Storage Ring at the Australian Synchrotron, a stripline Beam Position Monitor (BPM) has been designed, fabricated and installed in-house. The design was based on an existing stripline in the Booster and modified for the transfer line with a particular emphasis on ensuring the line impedance is properly matched to the detector system. The initial bench tests of a prototype stripline showed that the fabrication of the four individual striplines in the BPM was made precisely, each with a measured standing wave ratio (SWR) of 1. 8 at 500 MHz. Further optimization for impedance matching will be done for new stripline BPMs. The linearity and gain factor was measured with the detector system. The detector system that digitizes the signals is an Instrumentation Technologies Brilliance Single Pass [1]. The results show an error of 1 mm at an offset (from the <b>electrical</b> <b>centre)</b> of 10 mm when a linear gain factor is assumed and an RMS noise of ~ 150 um that decreases to < 10 um with increasing signal intensity.

40|$|Silicon carbide, {{which has}} many polytypic {{modifications}} {{of a very}} simple and very symmetric structure, is an excellent model system for exploring, the relationship between chemical shift, long-range dipolar shielding, and crystal structure in network solids. A simple McConnell equation treatment of bond anisotropy effects in a poly type predicts chemical shifts for silicon and carbon sites which agree well with the experiment, provided that contributions from bonds up to 100 A {{are included in the}} calculation. The calculated chemical shifts depend on three factors: the layer stacking sequence, <b>electrical</b> <b>centre</b> of gravity, and the spacings between silicon and carbon layers. The assignment of peaks to lattice sites is proved possible for three polytypes (6 H, 15 R, and 3 C). The fact that the calculated chemical shifts are very sensitive to layer spacings provides us a potential way to detennine and refine a crystal structure. In this work, the layer spacings of 6 H SiC have been calculated and are within X-ray standard deviations. Under this premise, the layer spacings of 15 R have been detennined. 29 Si and 13 C single crystal nmr studies of 6 H SiC polytype indicate that all silicons and carbons are magnetically anisotropic. The relationship between a magnetic shielding tensor component and layer spacings has been derived. The comparisons between experimental and semi-empirical chemical shielding tensor components indicate that the paramagnetic shielding of silicon {{should be included in the}} single crystal chemical shift calculation...|$|E

40|$|Effective optical {{interconnect}} {{is a fundamental}} requisite to realize Internet-scale data centres due to the capabilities and benefits of optical devices. Optical interconnects are energy efficient and support massive bandwidths. The performance of {{optical interconnect}}s {{is directly related to}} the type of optical switches and optical switching techniques used. Optical switches may be categorized into slow optical switches and fast optical switches. The optical switching techniques are Optical Circuit Switching (OCS), Optical Packet Switching (OPS) and Optical Burst Switching (OBS). This thesis presents three novel optical interconnection schemes which are based on optical burst switching. These schemes are called Hybrid Optical Switch Architecture (HOSA), HOSA with Traffic Demand Scheduling (TDS) and Fast Optical Switch Architecture (FOSA). The first two schemes are based on a hybrid design that utilizes fast and slow optical switches while the third scheme is based on using only fast optical switches. The proposed schemes consider OBS with a two-way reservation protocol that ensures zero burst loss. In the two-way reservation protocol, the connection is established for each burst before transmission. To evaluate the performance of these schemes, network-level simulation is used. The proposed architectures consider a single stage core topology that can be easily scaled up (in capacity) and scaled out (in the number of racks) without requiring major re-cabling and network reconfiguration. The proposed schemes feature separate data and control planes. The control plane comprises a centralized controller while the data plane contains an array of optical switches. A scalability analysis of the proposed topology is presented and shows that this topology is scalable to hundreds of thousands of servers. This thesis also presents a trade-off between cost and power consumption of the proposed designs by comparing them with conventional interconnects using analytical modelling. In HOSA, the key idea is to route high volume traffic through a fast optical switch during the reconfiguration of a slow optical switch. The traffic is moved to the slow optical switch once it is reconfigured. The aggregated traffic should be large enough so that it can bypass the slow optical switch during its reconfiguration phase. This technique hides the reconfiguration time of slow optical switch but the latency introduced due to burst aggregation is still high. In HOSA with TDS, small bursts are considered to reduce the latency of burst aggregation. The controller in HOSA with TDS technique maintains a traffic demand matrix which updates traffic demand on periodic intervals and assigns slow paths for the high traffic volume. A resource allocation algorithm is proposed that allocates paths of fast and slow optical switches efficiently. In HOSA with TDS, the control plane can only support applications that have high traffic stability. So for dynamically changing communication patterns, this thesis presents a new design called FOSA. The FOSA is based on only fast optical switches and it also uses OBS with the two-way reservation i. e. there is no additional burden on the control plane for maintaining traffic demands as was done in HOSA with TDS. The proposed technique shows considerable improvement in terms of throughput and packet loss ratio as compared to the traditional methods of OBS while performance comparable in terms of delay with the traditional methods of OBS is also achieved. The proposed technique also demonstrates performance comparable to that of <b>electrical</b> data <b>centre</b> networks. The performance of TCP over traditional OBS network is degraded by the bursts losses due to contention even at a low traffic load. In FOSA, the performance of the TCP is evaluated. Since in the proposed scheme, the burst loss is zero due to two way reservation, the results show significant improvement of TCP performance in terms of throughput, time and packets loss as compared to the traditional methods of OBS and the conventional electronic packet switching data centre networks for all types of workloads...|$|R
