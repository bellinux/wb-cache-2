5|$|Olivia rejoins Henry {{and then}} leaves him to swim {{the rest of}} the way <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>make</b> her way to the {{isolation}} tank. After injecting herself with the same drugs Walternate (John Noble) had used on her, she enters the tank and soon finds herself back in her own universe. She encounters a cleaning lady, and as Olivia feels herself being dragged back to the parallel universe, she gives the cleaning lady a message to pass along to Peter (Joshua Jackson). Back in the isolation tank, Walternate has had Olivia extracted from the tank and directs his agents to lock her up and sedate her.|$|E
25|$|The Flyers {{began the}} 2009–10 season with some major changes, {{allowing}} goaltenders Martin Biron and Antero Niittymaki to depart via free agency, {{replacing them with}} former Ottawa netminder Ray Emery and former Flyer Brian Boucher, and significantly upgrading the defense {{with the addition of}} Chris Pronger from Anaheim. Pronger came at a price, however, costing the Flyers Joffrey Lupul, Luca Sbisa and the Flyers' first-round draft picks in both 2009 and 2010. The season began in earnest, though it soon unraveled with mediocre play that cost Head Coach John Stevens his job in December. Peter Laviolette was hired as his replacement in order to re institute accountability and restore success to the Flyers, though the results were not immediate; the Flyers suffered a 2–7–1 stretch immediately following his arrival. Injuries took a major toll on the Flyers, with Blair Betts, Daniel Briere, Jeff Carter, Simon Gagne and Kimmo Timonen all missing significant numbers of games, though no position was nearly affected as much with injuries as goaltending. Emery suffered a hip injury in December, played sporadically afterwards and ultimately underwent season-ending surgery. Boucher suffered a hand injury shortly thereafter, which allowed journeyman goaltender Michael Leighton to step <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>make</b> an immediate impact. Leighton went 8–0–1 in his first ten starts, including a tough 2–1 overtime loss in the 2010 Winter Classic to Boston at Fenway Park on New Year's Day. Leighton, however, was forced out of the line-up in March with a high ankle sprain, necessitating Boucher's return as starter. All told, seven different goaltenders suited up for the Flyers at various points throughout the year. Mediocre play down the stretch forced the Flyers into a do-or-die shootout with the Rangers in what could have been their final game of the year, with the contest being hosted at the Wachovia Center. Boucher stopped final shooter Olli Jokinen to clinch the seventh seed in the East and a first round matchup with New Jersey.|$|E

500|$|In 2004, OutKast's {{original}} {{record label}} Arista Records was restructured under the Jive label group. During their hiatus, Big Boi and André 3000 were pressured by Jive {{to produce an}} OutKast album {{instead of focusing on}} their solo work. In July 2009, Big Boi left Jive Records, following creative differences and the label's unwillingness to release and promote his solo album. According to Big Boi, Jive gave him an ultimatum to shop the album elsewhere. In an interview for GQ, he discussed his release from Jive and his discontent with the label for proposing he record a cover of rapper Lil Wayne's [...] "Lollipop", stating [...] "They told me to go <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>make</b> my version of Lil Wayne's Lollipop! I love that song... But how you gonna tell me to go bite another MCs style?... That's the highest form of disrespect ever. So that's when I wanted to get off Jive.

ZsaZsa finds three dates for Fatboy, {{but none of them}} are genuine. Fatboy borrows Darren Miller's (Charlie G. Hawkins) ice cream van to practice for his driving test, which he fails, but he buys the van from Darren. He helps Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty) sell T-shirts but sells them to Mo Harris (Laila Morse), who has been asked by Becca Swanson (Simone James) to buy them so she can sell them for a greater profit. Becca insists she did not know they were Whitney's and then flirts with Fatboy. However, he later humiliates her by designing T-shirts for her that show a mirror image of the word [...] "chav". He finally passes his driving test and DJs for Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack) at R nightclub. Fatboy, Leon, ZsaZsa, Whitney, Lucy and Lucy's brother Peter (Thomas Law) go to Hampshire and he attends a party with Peter while the others spend time in the woods.

Fatboy is then shocked to discover that Mercy is planning to move back to Nigeria. He realises that neither Mercy nor her grandmother Grace (Ellen Thomas) want to leave London, and convinces them to stay.|$|E
500|$|After graduating, Hedlund {{signed with}} the Trenton Titans of the East Coast Hockey League for the final games of the 2001–02 season. He played in two games as a rookie and did not record a stat during the regular season, but in six playoff games he spent six minutes in the penalty box. In the 2002–03 season, he played in 13 games for Trenton {{recording}} a goal and two assists before he was called up to the American Hockey League's Binghamton Senators. In Binghamton, he played in 59 games scoring one goal and adding seven assists. On January 16, 2004, against the Albany River Rats, Hedlund broke a 17-game streak {{in which he had}} gone scoreless after he recorded his first career overtime goal and his second career game-winner. His previous goal was a game-winning shot against Syracuse. He ended the 2003–04 season with four goals and 19 assists in 80 games. Before the 2004–05 season, Hedlund spent time in training camp with the Ottawa Senators before he was reassigned to Binghamton. The NHL season would eventually be locked out which saw players such as goaltender Dominik Hašek join the AHL. When Hasek began working out with Binghamton, Hedlund commented, [...] "He's just one of the guys when he's here, he just wants to put in his time and get some good work <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> <b>make</b> sure he's ready to go, so you just got to appreciate a guy like that being here and doing that kind of work, so its pretty fun." [...] A season preview produced by the website Hockey's Future commented about Hedlund saying that, [...] "A fan-favorite, Hedlund gives it everything he has despite limited talent." [...] Against the Manitoba Moose on October 31, Hedlund scored a goal from the blue line that tied the game, however the Senators ended up losing 5–3. Following the season, he and Philadelphia Phantoms player Ben Stafford were named the AHL's Men of the Year. During the season he played in 75 games, scoring two goals with 13 assists. In the playoffs, he played in six games recording two assists.|$|E
500|$|The band members' {{main goal}} was to reinvent the group's sound from scratch, {{creating}} what Trohman called a [...] "reimagining of the band," [...] which focuses more on pop. Sessions were not without difficulties, as the band struggled initially to produce new material. Walker had doubts about the band's volatility, feeling the record would not get made following [...] "meltdown after meltdown." [...] The entire album was recorded in secrecy from the music industry, critics, and fans of the band. While specifically denying that the group's announcement was a reunion because [...] " [...] never broke up", the band announced a reunion tour and details of Save Rock and Roll on February 4, 2013. The quartet's announcement included {{a photo of the}} group that had been taken earlier that morning of the band members huddled around a bonfire tossing copies of their back catalog into flames at the original location of Comiskey Park, the location of 1979's Disco Demolition Night, a baseball promotional event which involved destroying disco records. A message on the group's website read [...] "when we were kids the only thing that got us through most days was music. It's why we started Fall Out Boy in the first place. This isn't a reunion because we never broke up. We needed to plug back <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>make</b> some music that matters to us. The future of Fall Out Boy starts now. Save rock and roll..." [...] Save Rock and Roll debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, with first week sales of 154,000 copies in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan. The arrival of Save Rock and Roll posted the quartet's third-biggest sales week, and earned the group's second career number one on the chart. The band's chart success was best described as unexpected by music journalists. Rolling Stone called the band's comeback a [...] "rather stunning renaissance", and Entertainment Weekly called the number one a [...] "major accomplishment for a band whom many in the industry had dismissed as kings of a genre whose time had passed." ...|$|E

2500|$|Given {{that the}} band's {{background}} was exclusively in heavy music at that point, some band members experienced difficulties expanding their sound early on. In particular, Spruance noted that Mike Patton {{had to teach}} him to play the ska stroke for a performance at their high school talent show. Spruance later explained, [...] "Oh, what I remember was... this was our first... like, we had only done, uh, death metal up to that point. And so this was our first time trying to ever play ska.
