Two experiments were conducted in consecutive years to examine the ability of different genotypes to compete against grass weeds. <b>Field</b> <b>pea</b> was grown in {{the presence or absence}} of Lolium rigidum or wheat. In each experiment significant genotypic differences in <b>field</b> <b>pea</b> competitiveness occurred and some genotypes had consistently high or low levels of competitiveness in both years.

Sites were established at Vonda, Vanscoy and Delisle, SK using a randomized complete block designs with summerfallow and green manure treatments included for each crop. Seed yield increased with increasing seeding rate for both crops, up to 1725 kg ha- 1 for <b>field</b> <b>pea</b> and 1290 kg ha- 1 for lentil. Weed biomass at physiological maturity decreased with increasing seeding rate for both crops. In <b>field</b> <b>pea,</b> weeds were reduced in weight by 68 %, while lentil reduced weed biomass by 59 % between the lowest and highest seeding rates. Post-harvest soil phosphate-P levels did not change consistently between treatments, indicating that there was no trend in soil P concentration with seeding rate. Post-harvest soil inorganic N, however, was higher for the summerfallow and green manure treatments than for the seeding rate treatments in both crops. Inorganic N was higher at some sites for the highest two seeding rates in <b>field</b> <b>pea.</b> Soil water storage following harvest was not affected by treatment.

Levels of inositol- 3 -phosphate-phos phate (IP 3 -P; 0. 6 mg·g - 1) and inorganic P (1. 8 - 2. 0 mg·g - 1) were higher in low-PA lines than in the <b>field</b> <b>pea</b> cultivars. Reduction of PA in low-PA line seeds may reduce seed Fe and total P concentrations, as levels in the low-PA lines (37 - 42 mg·kg - 1 Fe; 4003 - 4473 mg·kg - 1 total P) were typically less than in <b>field</b> <b>pea</b> cultivars (37 - 55 mg·kg - 1 Fe; 3208 - 4985 mg·kg - 1 total P) at different P fertilizer rates.

Forage (turnip, Brassica rapa) was also infected. None of 9, 816 canola (Brassica napus, at least 19 cultivars) or 1, 967 faba bean (Vicia faba, three cultivars) plants were infected. Six isolates from weeds, mustard, and chickpea were inoculated {{on a range}} of weed and crop species including four B. napus pathotype differential lines. Inoculated Brassicaceae weeds, mustard, <b>field</b> <b>pea</b> cv. ‘Cressy Blue’, coriander, Chinese cabbage (B. rapa), and forage turnip (B. rapa) were usually infected. <b>Field</b> <b>pea</b> cv. Dundale and radishes (Raphanus sativus) were infected infrequently. Symptoms were severe in mustard, forage turnip, chickpea, and <b>field</b> <b>pea.</b> The reportedly susceptible canola cv. ‘Outback’ displayed only variable infectivity and mild symptoms for five isolates and no infectivity for one isolate. Faba bean, <b>field</b> <b>pea</b> cv. ‘Excell’, and two B. napus differentials appeared to be non-hosts. The results suggest that TuMV strains naturalised in Brassicaceae weeds in NSW in 1999 – 2007 could damage mustard, <b>field</b> <b>pea,</b> and forage turnip, but not canola or faba bean. These NSW strains appeared to be distinct from strains that damage canola in Europe, North America, and Asia...|$|R

40|$|<b>Field</b> <b>pea</b> Pisum sativum L.) {{is a well}} {{established}} crop {{around the world and}} over the last ten years, the production of this grain has been increasing in Australia. As with other grain legumes, <b>field</b> <b>pea</b> proteins contain high levels of lysine which may be important in balancing the deficiencies of this essential amino acid in cereal-based diets. In recent years, interest in plant proteins for feed and food led to the evaluation of <b>field</b> <b>peas</b> as an economical and nutritional source of proteins. Although some research work has been done on the production of <b>field</b> <b>pea</b> protein, starch and fiber as food ingredients in Europe and Canada, none of these attempts have resulted in a commercial scale applications of pea proteins in the food market. The primary limitation to the development of pea proteins as food ingredients is the lack of information on the technology and characterisation of the resulting products, in comparison with well-established soy proteins. The major purpose of this project has been focused on the isolation and characterisation of <b>field</b> <b>pea</b> proteins, both on a laboratory scale and on a pilot scale, as well as the functional properties evaluation of the resultant products for appropriate food applications. The feasibility of chemical modification in order to enhance the functional properties of the proteins is also included...|$|R

40|$|Smooth barley is {{an annual}} weed species that is infesting crops and {{pastures}} in South Australia. Complicating control options {{is the presence}} of herbicide-resistant biotypes. A field trial was conducted to identify alternative herbicides for the management of acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACCase) -inhibiting herbicide-resistant smooth barley in <b>field</b> <b>pea.</b> Preplant (PP) soil applications of pyroxasulfone; prosulfocarb plus S-metolachlor; dimethenamid-P; propyzamide; trifluralin alone or with triallate or with diuron; or imazamox applied POST were evaluated for their effectiveness and crop safety. Propyzamide, pyroxasulfone, or imazamox applied POST provided a high level of smooth barley control, did not cause any crop injury, and increased <b>field</b> <b>pea</b> grain or forage yield compared with the nontreated. Furthermore, propyzamide or pyroxasulfone reduced panicle density and seed production in smooth barley, whereas the effectiveness of POST imazamox varied over the two seasons. Dimethenamid-P reduced the impact of smooth barley on <b>field</b> <b>pea</b> yield, but cause stunting, and was less effective than propyzamide, pyroxasulfone, and imazamox in reducing smooth barley seed production. Negative relationship between <b>field</b> <b>pea</b> yield and smooth barley panicle density indicated that smooth barley is highly competitive in <b>field</b> <b>pea</b> crops and can cause large yield losses. The results of this investigation suggest that propyzamide or pyroxasulfone applied PP and imazamox applied POST could be used effectively in the field for the management of ACCase-inhibiting herbicide-resistant smooth barley in South Australia.

40|$|<b>Field</b> <b>pea</b> (Pisum sativum L.) is {{frequently}} grown as a rotation crop with cereals in Australia. Modelling capacity to simulate <b>field</b> <b>pea</b> growth and production {{would be a}} useful tool for assessing crop management options in response to the fungal disease, blackspot. Field studies in South Australia (SA), Western Australia (WA) and Gansu, China were used to develop and test a <b>field</b> <b>pea</b> module for inclusion in APSIM. A new crop species was created using the “legume” template. Data on phenology, leaf area, biomass and components and grain yield were collected in field experiments in 2002 and 2003 in SA, and used to derive phenology parameters to test the model for biomass accumulation and yield. Data from WA and a wheat-field pea rotation experiment in Gansu, China were used to independently test the APSIM <b>field</b> <b>pea</b> module performance. Flowering dates, ranging from 80 to 105 days after sowing, were accurately predicted. The developed <b>field</b> <b>pea</b> module was also able to accurately simulate biomass accumulation, leaf area index and grain yield across the different seasons and experimental sites. Biomass accumulation was simulated with a RMSD of 555, 719 and 208 kg/ha, respectively in experiments in SA, WA and China. Observed grain yield ranged from 1000 to 3000 kg/ha and were also well simulated with a RMSD of 253 kg/ha. The above results suggest that the developed APSIM-field pea module can be used for assessing agronomic management options and quantifying potential yields for different environmental and soil conditions...|$|R
