Primer <b>dimer</b> <b>formation</b> often competes with formation of the DNA fragment of interest, and may be avoided using primers that are designed such that they lack complementarity—especially at the 3' ends—to itself or the other primer used in the reaction. If primer design is constrained by other factors and if primer-dimers do occur, methods to limit their formation may include optimisation of the MgCl2 concentration or increasing the annealing temperature in the PCR.|$|E
25|$|The MOF {{encapsulation}} approach invites {{comparison to}} earlier studies of oxidative catalysis by zeolite-encapsulated Fe(porphyrin) {{as well as}} Mn(porphyrin) systems. The zeolite studies generally employed iodosylbenzene (PhIO), rather than TPHP as oxidant. The difference is likely mechanistically significant, thus complicating comparisons. Briefly, PhIO is a single oxygen atom donor, while TBHP is capable of more complex behavior. In addition, for the MOF-based system, {{it is conceivable that}} oxidation proceeds via both oxygen transfer from a manganese oxo intermediate as well as a manganese-initiated radical chain reaction pathway. Regardless of mechanism, the approach is a promising one for isolating and thereby stabilizing the porphyrins against both oxo-bridged <b>dimer</b> <b>formation</b> and oxidative degradation.|$|E
25|$|The 3-dimensional {{structure}} of native antithrombin was first determined in 1994. Unexpectedly the protein crystallized as a heterodimer composed of one molecule of native antithrombin and one molecule of latent antithrombin. Latent antithrombin on formation immediately links to a molecule of native antithrombin {{to form the}} heterodimer, {{and it is not}} until the concentration of latent antithrombin exceeds 50% of the total antithrombin that it can be detected analytically. Not only is the latent form of antithrombin inactive against its target coagulation proteases, but its dimerisation with an otherwise active native antithrombin molecule also results in the native molecules inactivation. The physiological impact of the loss of antithrombin activity either through latent antithrombin formation or through subsequent <b>dimer</b> <b>formation</b> is exacerbated by the preference for dimerisation to occur between heparin activated β-antithrombin and latent antithrombin as opposed to α-antithrombin.|$|E

25|$|<b>Dimer</b> <b>formation</b> {{of the two}} ABC {{domains of}} {{transporters}} requires ATP binding. It is generally observed that the ATP bound state {{is associated with the}} most extensive interface between ABC domains, whereas the structures of nucleotide-free transporters exhibit conformations with greater separations between the ABC domains. Structures of the ATP-bound state of isolated NBDs have been reported for importers including HisP, GlcV, MJ1267, E. coli MalK (E.c.MalK), T. litoralis MalK (TlMalK), and exporters such as TAP, HlyB, MJ0796, Sav1866, and MsbA. In these transporters, ATP is bound to the ABC domain. Two molecules of ATP are positioned at the interface of the dimer, sandwiched between the Walker A motif of one subunit and the LSGGQ motif of the other. This was first observed in Rad50 and reported in structures of MJ0796, the NBD subunit of the LolD transporter from Methanococcus jannaschii and E.c.MalK of a maltose transporter. These structures were also consistent with results from biochemical studies revealing that ATP is in close contact with residues in the P-loop and LSGGQ motif during catalysis.|$|E
25|$|Some {{evidence}} to show that ATP binding is indeed the power stroke of the transport cycle was reported. It has been shown that ATP binding induces changes in the substrate-binding properties of the TMDs. The affinity of ABC transporters for substrates has been difficult to measure directly, and indirect measurements, for instance through stimulation of ATPase activity, often reflects other rate-limiting steps. Recently, direct measurement of vinblastine binding to permease-glycoprotein (P-glycoprotein) in the presence of nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs, e.g. 5’-adenylyl-β-γ-imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP), showed that ATP binding, in the absence of hydrolysis, is sufficient to reduce substrate-binding affinity. Also, ATP binding induces substantial conformational changes in the TMDs. Spectroscopic, protease accessibility and crosslinking studies have shown that ATP binding to the NBDs induces conformational changes in multidrug resistance-associated protein-1 (MRP1), HisPMQ, LmrA, and Pgp. Two dimensional crystal structures of AMP-PNP-bound Pgp showed that the major conformational change during the transport cycle occurs upon ATP binding and that subsequent ATP hydrolysis introduces more limited changes. Rotation and tilting of transmembrane α-helices may both contribute to these conformational changes. Other studies have focused on confirming that ATP binding induces NBD closed <b>dimer</b> <b>formation.</b> Biochemical studies of intact transport complexes suggest that the conformational changes in the NBDs are relatively small. In the absence of ATP, the NBDs may be relatively flexible, but they do not involve a major reorientation of the NBDs with respect to the other domains. ATP binding induces a rigid body rotation of the two ABC subdomains with respect to each other, which allows the proper alignment of the nucleotide in the active site and interaction with the designated motifs. There is strong biochemical evidence that binding of two ATP molecules can be cooperative, that is, ATP must bind to the two active site pockets before the NBDs can dimerize and form the closed, catalytically active conformation.|$|E

40|$|CD 4 {{is engaged}} in APC-mediated T-cell {{activation}} and serves as the primary receptor for HIV. CD 4 dimerization and location in specific microdomains has been previously suggested to control its pathophysiological activity. In this study, we investigated (i) whether the CD 4 cytoplasmic domain contributes to its dimerization by evaluating the dimerization of mutants, bearing deletions or point mutations in their cytoplasmic tail, (ii) whether CD 4 monomers and dimers segregate in distinct microdomains by subcellular fractionation, and (iii) how CD 4 dimerization is affected by T-cell activation or HIV- 1 viral proteins. Our results indicated that within the cytoplasmic tail of CD 4, two cysteines {{played a crucial role}} in the <b>dimers</b> <b>formation,</b> since point mutations or truncation upstream of these residues prevented dimerization. The solubility of CD 4 dimers and monomers in various detergents was different and CD 4 dimers were poorly associated with lipid rafts, but strongly interacted with the tetraspanin CD 81. Neither cytoskeleton-disrupting drugs nor cholesterol-sequestering agents had an effect on the CD 4 dimerization indicating that <b>dimers</b> <b>formation</b> was independent of CD 4 association with the cytoskeleton or lipid rafts. Finally, whereas T-cell activation poorly impact on CD 4 dimerization, HIV- 1 gp 120 and Nef drastically reduced the ratio of CD 4 dimers/monomers. Together, these findings demonstrate that two cysteines within the CD 4 cytoplasmic tail are critical for dimerization, that CD 4 dimers locate preferentially in microdomains distinct than classical lipid rafts, likely tetraspanin-enriched microdomains, and that CD 4 dimers are implicated in the process of HIV infection...|$|R

Although structures are available for the isolated DAD segment in complex with the interacting region in the N-terminus, it remains unclear how this leads to inhibition of actin assembly by the FH 2 domain. Here we describe the crystal structure of the N-terminal regulatory region of formin mDia 1 in complex with a C-terminal fragment containing both the FH 2 and DAD domains.
