5|$|The police, who suspect an <b>illegal</b> <b>abortion,</b> {{find the}} remains of the baby in the garden furnace. Wayne quickly confesses to {{destroying}} the evidence. He asserts that his wife had aborted the child while in a trance-like state and attempts to convince her of this. Laura takes the blame for the abortion and goes to jail. While visiting Laura in her cell, Wayne attempts to steal her soul, but the EMT is able to save her life, much to Wayne's surprise. Meanwhile, Wayne has another wife, Betsy Monroe, who is also pregnant.|$|E
5|$|One of Reich's first {{patients}} was Lore Kahn, a 19-year-old woman {{with whom he}} had an affair. Freud had warned analysts not to involve themselves with their patients, but {{in the early days of}} psychoanalysis the warnings went unheeded. According to Reich's diaries, Kahn became ill in November 1920 and died of sepsis after sleeping in a bitterly cold room she had rented as a place for her and Reich to meet (both his landlady and her parents had forbidden their meetings). Kahn's mother suspected that her daughter had died after a botched <b>illegal</b> <b>abortion,</b> possibly performed by Reich himself. According to Christopher Turner, she found some of her daughter's bloodied underwear in a cupboard.|$|E
50|$|When the {{maternal}} hygiene offices reopened in 1950, abortion counseling {{became one of}} their main services. An estimated 3,000 legal abortions and 7,000 - 10,000 <b>illegal</b> <b>abortions</b> were performed {{each year in the}} 1950s. In 1956, the prevalence of <b>illegal</b> <b>abortions</b> reached such levels that a council on penal law recommended stiffer penalties for <b>illegal</b> <b>abortions.</b>|$|R
50|$|Due {{to legal}} {{restrictions}} against abortion, {{as well as}} its significant financial cost, <b>illegal</b> <b>abortions</b> are common in Belize, especially for low-income women. In 1998, an estimated one in seven maternal deaths in Belize were due to unsafe, <b>illegal</b> <b>abortions.</b>|$|R
50|$|Abortions in Costa Rica {{are most}} {{commonly}} practiced in secret, either in private clinics or {{by other means}} where statistics of maternal deaths are difficult to obtain. In 2007, data revealed {{that the number of}} <b>illegal</b> <b>abortions</b> is on the rise, up to 22.3 for every 1,000 from 10.6 for every 1,000 women. This comes out to about 27,000 <b>illegal</b> <b>abortions</b> being performed in Costa Rica annually.|$|R
5|$|After Baby {{discovers that}} Johnny's dance partner, Penny Johnson (Cynthia Rhodes), is {{pregnant}} by Robbie Gould (Max Cantor), a womanizing waiter {{who is also}} dating and cheating on Baby's older sister, Lisa (Jane Brucker) and several other female guests, she borrows money from her father {{to pay for an}} <b>illegal</b> <b>abortion</b> for Penny. Jake agrees to give the money to Baby even though she says she can't tell him what it's for. Penny eventually accepts the money, but says there is another issue. Johnny and Penny perform a weekly dance at the Sheldrake, another nearby resort. Penny will miss her performance if she goes for the abortion, and they will forfeit their salary for the season. Billy suggests that Baby fill in for her. Johnny scoffs at this, which overcomes Baby's initial resistance. Billy and Penny insist that Johnny can teach anyone to dance. Johnny begins to teach Baby the mambo, and the two spend several awkward practice sessions together. Baby gradually begins to improve, and a romantic attraction grows between them.|$|E
5|$|After {{a fashion}} model dies while {{undergoing}} an <b>illegal</b> <b>abortion,</b> the attending doctor moves her body {{back to her}} home, staging her death to remove any trace of his involvement. However, he is murdered by a stranger disguised in racing leathers and a motorcycle helmet. At the Albatross Modelling Agency, womanising photographer Carlo (Nino Castelnuovo) embarks on an affair with fellow photographer Magda (Edwige Fenech). Meanwhile, a newly hired model, Patrizia (Solvi Stubing), fends off the unwanted advances of Maurizio (Franco Diogene), whose wife owns the agency. One evening, Mario (Claudio Pellegrini), who also works at the agency, invites a woman in racing leathers into his home for a drink, and is stabbed to death. The police question the agency's owner Gisella (Lia Amanda) and another model, Lucia (Femi Benussi) about the killing, but learn very little. Gisella and Lucia are sleeping together; one night when Gisella leaves after a fight, Lucia is attacked and killed.|$|E
25|$|On 13 April 1955 Janine Graetz, {{with whom}} Koestler had an on-off {{relationship}} {{over a period}} of years, gave birth to his daughter Cristina. Despite repeated attempts by Janine to persuade Koestler to show some interest in her, Koestler had almost no contact with Cristina throughout his life. Early in 1956 he arranged for Cynthia to have an <b>illegal</b> <b>abortion.</b>|$|E

25|$|In {{subsequent}} issues OZ {{made several}} {{investigations into the}} murky realms of Sydney's underworld. One celebrated feature delved into the <b>illegal</b> <b>abortion</b> rackets which were then flourishing in Sydney (and around Australia), because at that time abortion was still illegal {{for all but the}} most exceptional cases, and corrupt police were widely believed to be running lucrative protection rackets that netted them substantial sums.|$|E
25|$|Until 1998, Western Australian law {{apparently}} mirrored that of Queensland, {{though it}} was never clarified by case law or legislation. Following the 1998 announcement of the prosecution of two Perth doctors for performing an <b>illegal</b> <b>abortion</b> – the first such prosecution in over 30 years – a private member's bill was introduced by Cheryl Davenport, {{a member of the}} Australian Labor Party in the Upper House of the Western Australian parliament to amend the law.|$|E
25|$|Reports {{state that}} state {{officials}} {{had failed to}} visit or inspect Gosnell's practices since 1993. The grand jury report noted that the medical examiner of Delaware County alerted the Pennsylvania Department of Health that Gosnell had performed an <b>illegal</b> <b>abortion</b> on a 14-year-old who was thirty weeks pregnant; it is also claimed the Pennsylvania Department of Health did not act when they became aware of Gosnell's involvement {{in the death of}} Karnamaya Mongar.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, the Chinese {{government}} made <b>abortion</b> <b>illegal,</b> with punishments {{for those who}} received or performed <b>illegal</b> <b>abortions</b> written into the law. These restrictions were seen as the government's way of emphasizing the importance of population growth.|$|R
25|$|In 1971, Shirley Wheeler {{was charged}} with {{manslaughter}} after Florida hospital staff reported her <b>illegal</b> <b>abortion</b> to the police. She received a sentence of two years' probation and under her probation, she had to move back into her parents' house in North Carolina. The Boston Women's Abortion Coalition held a rally for Wheeler in Boston to raise money and awareness of her charges as well as had staff members from the Women's National Abortion Action Coalition (WONAAC) speak at the rally.|$|E
25|$|This was {{expanded}} by CES v Superclinics Australia Pty Ltd (1995) 38 NSWLR 47 which extended the {{period during which}} health concerns might be considered from the duration of pregnancy to any period during the woman's life, even {{after the birth of}} the child. This arguably precludes any successful prosecutions for illegal abortions. Despite this, in 2006, a doctor, Suman Sood, was convicted of two counts of performing an <b>illegal</b> <b>abortion</b> where she failed to enquire as to whether a lawful reason for performing the abortion did exist.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} year, the show had a {{controversial}} storyline involving Pat having an <b>illegal</b> <b>abortion</b> after becoming pregnant. This {{was the first}} time that American television had covered the subject. In the story, the abortion made her sterile, and the shock from the news caused her to find her ex-boyfriend, Tom Baxter (Nicholas Pryor), and shoot him in cold blood. Pat was eventually brought to trial and acquitted. She then fell in love with and married her lawyer, John Randolph (Michael M. Ryan). Trustman left the role of Pat in 1967 and was replaced by Beverly Penberthy.|$|E

25|$|During {{high school}} Rosalie participated in theater as had her parents while in college. She acted and sang in many productions, garnering praise for her {{performances}} in the local media. It was during this period that Rosalie became pregnant and had an <b>illegal</b> <b>abortion.</b> This experience {{had a profound effect}} on her, showing up in later poetry and song. She earned a scholarship to the University of Idaho, but as a result of a rape, she became pregnant and went to a home for unwed mothers in California to await the birth of her child, a daughter. Again, the experience of making the difficult choice of adoption shows in her later writings and music.|$|E
25|$|The volume {{contains}} five {{poems and}} six short stories, {{all on the}} theme of Christianity. Some of the poems can be taken as comments or epilogues on the short stories (e.g. Gold, Frankincense and Myrrh refers to the gifts in the stable which The Naughty Donkey in the preceding story attempts to eat). Although relatively unknown, this work, when referred to at all, is often stated as being for children; however the stories it contains are firmly aimed at an adult audience and with adult themes, especially for 1965. For instance, in the story The Water Bus, Mrs Hargreaves's cleaner tries to offload her woes to her employer, the main one of which is that her daughter is dying in hospital after an <b>illegal</b> <b>abortion</b> went wrong.|$|E
25|$|In 1968, he {{published}} two novels, Easy Go and A Case of Need, {{the second of}} which was re-published in 1993, under his real name. Easy Go relates the story of Harold Barnaby, a brilliant Egyptologist, who discovers a concealed message while translating hieroglyphics, informing him of an unnamed Pharaoh whose tomb {{is yet to be}} discovered. A Case of Need, on the other hand, was a medical thriller in which a Boston pathologist, Dr. John Berry, investigates an apparent <b>illegal</b> <b>abortion</b> conducted by an obstetrician friend, which caused the early demise of a young woman. The novel would prove a turning point in Crichton's future novels, in which technology is important in the subject matter, although this novel was as much about medical practice. The novel earned him an Edgar Award in 1969.|$|E

25|$|In Britain, the Abortion Law Reform Association {{continued}} its campaigning after the War, and this, combined with broad social changes brought {{the issue of}} abortion back into the political arena in the 1960s. President of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists John Peel chaired the committee advising the British Government on what became the 1967 Abortion Act. On the grounds of reducing the amount of disease and death associated with <b>illegal</b> <b>abortion,</b> the Abortion Act allowed for legal abortion on a number of grounds, including to prevent grave permanent injury to the woman's physical or mental health, to avoid injury to the physical or mental health of the woman or her existing child(ren) if the pregnancy was still under 28 weeks, or if the child was likely to be severely physically or mentally handicapped. The free provision of abortions was provided through the National Health Service.|$|E
500|$|Approximately {{ten days}} after the forced {{abortion}} occurred, the Shaanxi Provincial Population and Family Planning Commission launched an investigation. [...] On June 13, Yu Yanmei, the deputy head of Ankang, visited the Deng household. [...] Two days later, the commission concluded that Feng had indeed been forced into an <b>illegal</b> <b>abortion,</b> writing, [...] "Such practice has seriously violated the relevant policies... harmed the image of our family planning work, and caused extremely poor effects in society." [...] Three officials, including {{the head of the}} local family-planning department, were suspended from their jobs on June 14. An employee of the Ankang Family Planning Bureau said that [...] "grass-roots comrades aren't stupid, but this is what they're forced to do... This is a problem with the entire system." ...|$|E
500|$|When Sinatra's {{mother was}} a child, her pretty face earned her the {{nickname}} [...] "Dolly." [...] Energetic and driven, biographers {{believe that she was}} the dominant factor in the development of her son's personality traits and extraordinary self-confidence. Barbara Sinatra claims that Dolly was abusive to him as a child, and [...] "knocked him around a lot". Dolly became influential in Hoboken and in local Democratic Party circles. She worked as a midwife, earning $50 for each delivery, and according to Sinatra biographer Kitty Kelley, also ran an <b>illegal</b> <b>abortion</b> service that catered to Italian Catholic girls for which she was nicknamed [...] "Hatpin Dolly". She also had a gift for languages and served as a local interpreter. [...] Sinatra's illiterate father was a bantamweight boxer who fought under the name Marty O'Brien. He later worked for 24 years at the Hoboken Fire Department, working his way up to captain. Sinatra spent much time at his parents' tavern in Hoboken, [...] working on his homework and occasionally singing a song on top of the player piano for spare change. During the Great Depression, Dolly provided money to her son for outings with friends and to buy expensive clothes, resulting in neighbors describing him as the [...] "best-dressed kid in the neighborhood". Excessively thin and small as a child and young man, Sinatra's skinny frame later became a staple of jokes during stage shows.|$|E
50|$|In 2015, Phyllis Mbanje {{wrote that}} {{statistics}} indicate <b>illegal</b> <b>abortions</b> result {{in at least}} 20,000 maternal deaths, at least 5% of all maternal deaths, and over 80,000 terminated pregnancies every year in Zimbabwe.|$|R
50|$|Abortions are {{provided}} free-of-charge in hospitals. It is <b>illegal</b> to perform <b>abortions</b> in clinics, though doctors are empowered to provide abortions outside of hospitals in emergency circumstances. <b>Illegal</b> <b>abortions</b> remain very rare because, {{due to the}} generality of the conditions specified in the law, in practice a woman can get an abortion under almost any circumstance.|$|R
