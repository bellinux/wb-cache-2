For example, in 2001 less than 1% of the sexually active urban population in Africa had been tested, and this proportion is even lower in rural populations. Furthermore, in 2001 only 0.5% of pregnant women attending urban health facilities were counselled, tested or receive their test results. Again, this proportion is even lower in rural health facilities. Since donors may therefore be unaware of their infection, <b>donor</b> <b>blood</b> and blood products used in medicine and medical research are routinely screened for HIV.|$|E

25|$|Immunohaematology, or Blood bank determines blood groups, and {{performs}} {{compatibility testing}} on <b>donor</b> <b>blood</b> and recipients. It also prepares blood components, derivatives, and products for transfusion. Regulated by the FDA since giving blood {{is considered a}} drug, this unit determines a patient's blood type and Rh status, checks for antibodies to common antigens found on red blood cells, and cross matches units that are negative for the antigen.|$|E
25|$|Febrile nonhemolytic {{reactions}} {{are the most}} common type of blood transfusion reaction and occur due to the release of inflammatory chemical signals released by white blood cells in stored <b>donor</b> <b>blood</b> or attack on donor's white blood cells by recipient's antibodies. This type of reaction occurs in about 7% of transfusions. Fever is generally short lived and is treated with antipyretics, and transfusions may be finished as long as an acute hemolytic reaction is excluded. This is a reason for the now-widespread use of leukoreduction – the filtration of donor white cells from red cell product units.|$|E
25|$|Before a {{recipient}} receives a transfusion, compatibility testing between {{donor and recipient}} blood must be done. The first step before a transfusion is given is to type and screen the recipient's blood. Typing of recipient's blood determines the ABO and Rh status. The sample is then screened for any alloantibodies that may react with <b>donor</b> <b>blood.</b> It takes about 45 minutes to complete (depending on the method used). The blood bank scientist also checks for special requirements of the patient (e.g. need for washed, irradiated or CMV negative blood) {{and the history of}} the patient to see if they have previously identified antibodies and any other serological anomalies.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Hepatitis B virus (HBV) {{was among}} the first virus known to be {{transmitted}} by blood and blood productions. The objective {{of this study is to}} determine the trend of hepatitis B virus in <b>blood</b> <b>donors.</b> Materials and methods In this study 79274 <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> were retrospectively evaluated for HBsAg. The donors were selected using personal questionnaire, physical examination and testing blood before donation. Blood banks records are used as source of information. The <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> samples were analyzed for the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) by commercial available kits ELISA method, third generation (from Abbott laboratory, Germany). A sample was considered as HBsAg positive when found twice repeatedly reactive. Reactive samples were not confirmed with addition tests. Results In the evaluation data, we found out that from 79274 of the total healthy <b>blood</b> <b>donors,</b> 15983 were voluntary donors, 52876 were family replacement donors and 10424 commercial <b>blood</b> <b>donors.</b> The prevalence of HBsAg in <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> was 7. 9 %. It was increased steadily from 5. 9 % in 1999 to 9. 1 % in 2006 and decreased in 7. 9 % in 2009. According to <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> status the HBsAg prevalence was 10. 5 % in commercial <b>blood</b> <b>donors,</b> 8. 1 % in voluntary donors and 8. 6 % in family replacement donors. The prevalence of anti-HBc in <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> was 59. 1 %. Conclusion The prevalence of HBsAg was lower in voluntary non remunerate <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> than commercial donors and family replacement <b>blood</b> <b>donors.</b> In FDs the prevalence was higher than VDs but lower than CDs.

25|$|Landsteiner {{discovered}} that adverse effects arise from mixing blood from two incompatible individuals. He {{found that when}} incompatible types are mixed, an immune response is triggered and the red blood cells clump. The immunological reaction occurs when the receiver of a blood transfusion has antibodies against the <b>donor</b> <b>blood</b> cells. The destruction of red blood cells releases free hemoglobin into the bloodstream, which can have fatal consequences. Landsteiner's work {{made it possible to}} determine blood group and allowed a way for blood transfusions to be carried out much more safely. For this discovery he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine in 1930, and many other blood groups have been discovered since.|$|E
25|$|Location of a {{transplant}} center {{with respect to}} a donor hospital is given priority due to the effects of Cold Ischemic Time (CIT). Once the organ is removed from the <b>donor,</b> <b>blood</b> no longer perfuses through the vessels and begins to starve the cells of oxygen (ischemia). Each organ tolerates different ischemic times. Hearts and lungs need to be transplanted within 4–6 hours from recovery, liver about 8–10 hours and pancreas about 15 hours; kidneys are the most resilient to ischemia. Kidneys packaged on ice can be successfully transplanted 24–36 hours after recovery. Developments in kidney preservation have yielded a device that pumps cold preservation solution through the kidneys vessels to prevent Delayed Graft Function (DGF) due to ischemia. Perfusion devices, often called kidney pumps, can extend graft survival to 36–48 hours post recovery for kidneys. Recently similar devices have been developed for the heart and lungs, in an effort to increase distances procurement teams may travel to recover an organ.|$|E
25|$|On rare occasions, blood {{products}} are contaminated with bacteria. This {{can result in}} a life-threatening infection known as transfusion-transmitted bacterial infection. The risk of severe bacterial infection is estimated, as of 2002, at about 1 in 50,000 platelet transfusions, and 1 in 500,000 red blood cell transfusions. Blood product contamination, while rare, is still more common than actual infection. The reason platelets are more often contaminated than other {{blood products}} is that they are stored at room temperature for short periods of time. Contamination is also more common with longer duration of storage, especially if that means more than 5 days. Sources of contaminants include the donor's blood, donor's skin, phlebotomist's skin, and containers. Contaminating organisms vary greatly, and include skin flora, gut flora, and environmental organisms. There are many strategies in place at blood donation centers and laboratories {{to reduce the risk of}} contamination. A definite diagnosis of transfusion-transmitted bacterial infection includes the identification of a positive culture in the recipient (without an alternative diagnosis) as well as the identification of the same organism in the <b>donor</b> <b>blood.</b>|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Iron {{deficiency}} anemia is {{an important}} limiting factor {{for the number of}} donations in regular donors. Limited data is available on the iron status in Iranian donors. This study was conduced to evaluate the prevalence of iron deficiency and its related factors in <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> at Shiraz <b>blood</b> transfusion centre in 2005. Methods: This descriptive study was done on all <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> who donated their blood at Shiraz BTO in 2005. We selected 200 first time <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> (100 female & 100 male), 200 <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> who had history of one blood donation every year for at least 3 years and 200 <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> who had history of 3 to 4 times blood donation per year. Then we filled out a questionnaire and measured Hb, ferretin, MCV and MCHC. Results: The results showed that reduction in iron stores was directly related to the number of donations. (P< 0. 05). In this study, 34 % of female first time <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> and 11. 9 % of male first time donors had decreased iron stores. 34 % of female first time <b>blood</b> <b>donors,</b> 47. 9 % of female <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> with history of one blood donation a year and 77 % of female <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> who had history of 3 time blood donations in one year had decreased levels of iron. 11. 9 % of male first time <b>blood</b> <b>donors,</b> 14. 5 % of male <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> who had history of one blood donation a year and 37. 5 % of male <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> who had history of 3 blood donations every year had iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia. Conclusion: It seems that blood donation affects the iron status and if not compensated, it may cause complication in <b>blood</b> <b>donors.</b> The prevalence of iron deficiency in female <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> is more who therefore require more attention. Iron store levels are more related to number of blood donations per year rather than the number of blood donations in a lifetime. Therefore, these donors as a group require more attention...|$|R
40|$|Context: Blood {{donation}} {{results in}} a substantial loss of iron (200 to 250 mg) at each bleeding procedure (425 to 475 ml) and subsequent mobilization of iron from body stores. Recent reports have shown that body iron reserves generally are small and iron depletion is more frequent in <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> than in non-donors. Objective: The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the frequency of iron deficiency in <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> and to establish the frequency of iron deficiency in <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> according to sex, whether they were first-time or multi-time donors. Design: From march 20 to April 5, 2004, three hundred potential <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> from Hemocentro del Café y Tolima Grande were studied. Diagnostic tests: Using a combination of biochemical measurements of iron status: serum ferritin (RIA, ANNAR) and the hemoglobin pre and post-donation (HEMOCUE Vital technology medical). Results: The frequency of iron deficiency in potential <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> was 5 %, and <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> accepted was 5. 1 %; in <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> rejected for low hemoglobin the frequency of iron deficiency was 3. 7 % and accepted <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> was 1. 7 % in male and 12. 6 % in female.
