5|$|Ants are eusocial insects of {{the family}} Formicidae and, along with the related wasps and bees, belong to the order Hymenoptera. Ants evolved from wasp-like {{ancestors}} in the Cretaceous period, about 99 million years ago, and diversified after the rise of flowering plants. More than 12,500 of an estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified. They are easily identified by their <b>elbowed</b> antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists.|$|E
5|$|Ants are {{distinct}} in their morphology from other insects in having <b>elbowed</b> antennae, metapleural glands, {{and a strong}} constriction of their second abdominal segment into a node-like petiole. The head, mesosoma, and metasoma are the three distinct body segments. The petiole forms a narrow waist between their mesosoma (thorax plus the first abdominal segment, which is fused to it) and gaster (abdomen less the abdominal segments in the petiole). The petiole may be formed by one or two nodes (the second alone, or {{the second and third}} abdominal segments).|$|E
5|$|On 26 April 2008, Drogba faced {{controversy}} after a {{clash with}} Manchester United defender Nemanja Vidić. The Serbian centre-back {{had to have}} stitches under his lip after losing a tooth in the clash. There was discussion whether Drogba had the intention or not to injure his rival. The debate also called into question an earlier incident on 26 November 2006 where Drogba <b>elbowed</b> Vidić. Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson expressed concerns over elbowing in the Premier League. Despite media speculation, Drogba's yellow card for the clash was deemed adequate punishment by the Football Association.|$|E

5|$|Tatanka {{gained the}} early {{advantage}} over Lex Luger {{in the next}} match. He performed a crossbody to knock Luger down to the mat. Luger <b>elbowed</b> Tatanka to escape from a hold and then executed a chinlock on Tatanka. Tatanka came back by performing a knife-edge chop on Luger. He attempted the same move from the top rope, but Luger blocked him. Luger performed a clothesline on Tatanka to knock him down, but {{he was unable to}} pin him. The time limit expired, and both wrestlers were eliminated from the tournament. As a result, Bigelow received a bye into the final round.|$|E
5|$|The {{differences}} between millipedes and centipedes {{are a common}} question from the general public. Both groups of myriapods share similarities, such as long, multi-segmented bodies, many legs, {{a single pair of}} antennae, and the presence of postanntennal organs, but have many differences and distinct evolutionary histories, as the most recent common ancestor of centipedes and millipedes lived around 450 to 475 million years ago in the Silurian. The head alone exemplifies the differences; millipedes have short, <b>elbowed</b> antennae for probing the substrate, a pair of robust mandibles and a single pair of maxillae fused into a lip; centipedes have long, threadlike antennae, a pair of small mandibles, two pairs of maxillae and a pair of large poison claws.|$|E

5|$|Beardsley {{was signed}} by Conference Premier club York City on 19 June 2007, to provide {{competition}} for Richard Brodie, Craig Farrell and Onome Sodje. He made his debut as a starter in their 2–1 home defeat to Cambridge on 11 August 2007, {{in which he was}} substituted on 62 minutes. Despite struggling for a place in the team, Beardsley turned down a loan move to Conference North club Tamworth in September 2007, in order to prove his worth at York. He suffered a broken jaw in two places during York's 2–0 away win over Grays Athletic on 22 September 2007, after being <b>elbowed</b> by Jamie Stuart in an off-the-ball incident, which was likely to rule Beardsley out for at least three months. Essex Police confirmed they were making enquiries following the incident. Beardsley returned to the team as a 73rd-minute substitute in York's 1–1 home draw with Crawley Town on 1 December 2007. He finished his York career with nine appearances.|$|E

Charlton {{finished}} the 1986–87 season in the relegation play-off place, but retained their top-flight status after beating Leeds United 2–1 in a replay in the play-off final, following a 1–1 aggregate draw. Milne only played as a late substitute in the first leg at Selhurst Park, and ended the game with a broken jaw after being <b>elbowed</b> by Micky Adams. He dropped out of manager Lennie Lawrence's first team plans during the 1987–88 season, and was allowed to leave the club.|$|E
5|$|Late in the 1999–2000 season, Niedermayer was {{involved}} in a violent incident with Peter Worell of the Florida Panthers. After being <b>elbowed</b> by Worell, Niedermayer responded by swinging his stick at his opponents head. Worell suffered a concussion and missed six games, while Niedermayer was suspended for ten games – nine in the regular season, and New Jersey's first playoff game. After returning from his ban, Niedermayer's steady defensive contributions in the playoffs helped the Devils win their second Stanley Cup by defeating the Dallas Stars in six games in the 2000 Stanley Cup Final. While celebrating his day with the Cup, Niedermayer took the trophy to Fisher Peak, overlooking his hometown of Cranbrook and was famously pictured hoisting it over his head.|$|E

5|$|Returning for a {{third season}} with Hamilton in 1962–63, Henderson led the Ontario Hockey Association in scoring with 49 goals in 48 games. He added 27 assists to finish the season with 76 points. A bout of strep throat {{resulted}} in his missing Hamilton's playoff games, but he was called up to the Detroit Red Wings late in their season when they were short of players. Henderson played his first two NHL games against the Toronto Maple Leafs, with only one shift in each game. In his first game, Henderson <b>elbowed</b> Dick Duff in the head, sparking a fight. He {{spent the rest of}} the game on the bench after several Toronto players threatened retaliation against him. In his second, he incurred a slashing penalty during his only time on the ice. Henderson estimated that he was on the ice for only 20 seconds over the two games, but drew nine penalties in minutes.|$|E
5|$|By the 2008–09 campaign, Lapierre had {{established}} himself as a full-time NHLer and earned a roster spot with the Canadiens out of training camp {{for the first time in}} his career. Just over a month into the season, he was <b>elbowed</b> in the head by opposing forward Jarkko Ruutu during a game against the Ottawa Senators on November 11, 2008. Lapierre was not injured on the play, while Ruutu received a two-game suspension for the infraction. The following month, Lapierre recorded a Gordie Howe hat trick (a goal, an assist and a fight) in a 6–2 win against the New York Rangers on December 4, 2008. Later that month, on December 29, 2008, Lapierre recorded his first career NHL hat-trick during a 5–2 win against the Florida Panthers. Lapierre had a career year in 2008–09, finishing with 15 goals and 13 assists for 28 points over 79 games. After going scoreless in four playoff games, as the Canadiens were eliminated in the first round by the Boston Bruins, it was revealed that Lapierre had played the majority of the season in pain with an ankle injury. He underwent surgery in the off-season, recovering in time for the 2009 training camp.|$|E
5|$|During the 1991 SEA Games, Fandi scored both Singapore goals against Myanmar in {{the group}} stage, but was {{substituted}} in the semi-final match, after Indonesian fullback Herry Setyawan <b>elbowed</b> him in the eye. That match ended goalless and the Lions lost on penalties. Fandi also missed Singapore's failed attempt {{to qualify for the}} 1992 Asian Cup, having sustained a heel injury. At the 1993 SEA Games, captain Fandi scored a hat-trick in the 7–0 defeat of the Philippines, followed by the second Singapore goal in the 3–3 semi-final draw with Myanmar and scored once in the 3–1 win over Indonesia that secured a bronze medal for Singapore. Fandi also played in the inaugural Tiger Cup, and scored an equaliser against Malaysia, a goal against Brunei and two against the Philippines. 1997 was a disappointing year for Fandi, who failed to score in the Dunhill Cup and the World Cup qualifiers. After the 1997 SEA Games, where his goal in the semi-final could not prevent a 1–2 defeat to Indonesia, Fandi retired from international football.|$|E
50|$|There is a {{distinct}} difference between a single <b>elbow</b> and a follow-up <b>elbow.</b> The single <b>elbow</b> is an move independent from any other, whereas a follow-up <b>elbow</b> is the second strike from the same arm, being a hook or straight punch first with an <b>elbow</b> follow-up.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{purpose of}} this study is to assess the valgus and varus laxity of the unlinked version of the Latitude total <b>elbow</b> {{prosthesis}} and the effects of radial head preservation or replacement. METHODS: Biomechanical analysis of the valgus and varus laxity of the unlinked Latitude was performed in fourteen upper limb specimens in the following conditions: (1) native <b>elbow,</b> (2) native <b>elbow</b> after the surgical approach and closing all layers again, (3) <b>elbow</b> with humeral and ulnar component implanted, unlinked, with the native radial head preserved, (4) <b>elbow</b> with humeral and ulnar component implanted, unlinked, with the native radial excised, (5) <b>elbow</b> with humeral, ulnar, and radial head component implanted. FINDINGS: After implantation of the Latitude total <b>elbow</b> prosthesis both the valgus and varus laxity slightly increase from mid to maximal flexion when compared to the native <b>elbow</b> after surgical approach. The unlinked Latitude total <b>elbow</b> prosthesis provides both valgus and varus stability in <b>elbows</b> with intact ligamentous constraints. With intact ligamentous constraints the radial head component only slightly contributes to the stability of the <b>elbow</b> after implantation of the unlinked Latitude total <b>elbow</b> prosthesis. INTERPRETATION: The unlinked Latitude total <b>elbow</b> prosthesis provides both valgus and varus stability in <b>elbows</b> with intact ligamentous constraints.

5|$|The new England manager Glenn Hoddle {{appointed}} Shearer captain for the 1998 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Moldova on 1 September 1996, and {{the player}} held onto the captaincy after scoring once in that match and {{twice in the}} following game against Poland. He scored a total of fivegoals in England's successful qualification campaign for the World Cup; adding strikes against Georgia and away to Poland to his tally. Shearer was sidelined {{for much of the}} 1997–98 season, but recovered to play in the World Cup finals. With Michael Owen replacing Teddy Sheringham as Shearer's strike partner, Shearer's return saw him score England's first goal of the tournament, in a 2–0 win over Tunisia, his only goal in the three group matches. England faced long-time rivals Argentina in the second round. Shearer scored a first-half equaliser from the penalty-spot before David Beckham was sent off early in the second half. In the final minutes of the game Sol Campbell headed in what could have been the winning goal only for the referee to disallow it due to Shearer having <b>elbowed</b> goalkeeper Carlos Roa. The scores tied 2–2, the game went to penalties. Shearer scored again, but England were eliminated after David Batty's shot was saved by the Argentina goalkeeper. This defeat ended England's participation in what was to be Shearer's only World Cup tournament.|$|E
