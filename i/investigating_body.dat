On 15 September, he was given a funeral at the San Ulderico church, Lavis and attended by several drivers, friends and colleagues. Hours after the race, five cars involved in the accident were impounded by Italian authorities.

Magistrate Salvatore Bellomo opened a formal investigation into the crash and interviewed drivers.

The investigation was closed in June 2001 following a technical examination which concluded that Gislimberti was killed instantly. As a result of Gislimberti's death, the strength of the wheel tethers was doubled to stop flying tyres being a danger to the drivers, safety officials and fans. The chassis would be strengthened and enhanced crash resistance would be tested.|$|E

40|$|Background: pH {{is known}} as an {{important}} parameter in epidermal barrier function and homeostasis. Aim: The impact of age and body site on skin surface pH (pH(SS)) of women was evaluated in vivo. Methods: Time domain dual lifetime referencing with luminescent sensor foils was used for pH(SS) measurements. pH(SS) was measured on the forehead, the temple, and the volar forearm of adult females (n = 97, 52. 87 +/- 18. 58 years, 20 - 97 years). Every single measurement contained 2, 500 pH values due to the luminescence imaging technique used. Results: pH(SS) slightly increases with age on all three <b>investigated</b> <b>body</b> sites. There are {{no significant differences in}} pH(SS) between the three <b>investigated</b> <b>body</b> sites. Conclusion: Adult pH(SS) on the forehead, the temple and the volar forearm increases slightly with age. This knowledge is crucial for adapting medical skin care products. Copyright (C) 2012 S.

50|$|The pilot may be {{a factor}} even during adverse weather {{conditions}} if the <b>investigating</b> <b>body</b> deems that the pilot did not exercise due diligence.

50|$|Generally speaking, an {{anti-dumping}} investigation usually develops along the following steps: domestic producer(s) make(s) {{a request to}} the relevant authority to initiate an {{anti-dumping investigation}}. Then investigation to the foreign producer is conducted {{to determine if the}} allegation is valid. It uses questionnaires completed by the interested parties to compare the foreign producer's (or producers') export price to the normal value (the price in the exporter’s domestic market, the price charged by the exporter in another country, or a calculation based on the combination of the exporter’s production costs, other expenses and normal profit margins). If the foreign producer's export price is lower than the normal price and the <b>investigating</b> <b>body</b> proves a causal link between the alleged dumping and the injury suffered by the domestic industry, it comes to a conclusion that the foreign producer is dumping its products. According to Article VI of GATT, dumping investigations shall, except in special circumstances, be concluded within one year, and in no case more than 18 months after initiation. Anti-dumping measures must expire five years after the date of imposition, unless a review shows that ending the measure would lead to injury.|$|E

The {{usefulness of}} a new TOBEC instrument (ACAN) for <b>investigating</b> <b>body</b> composition in small mammals. Acta Theriologica 41 : 107 - 112. Estimates of water mass, lean body mass (LBM) and fat content based on total body electrical conductivity (TOBEC) measured with ACAN- 2 were compared with direct measurements of carcass composition in two species of rodents: the laboratory mouse (n = 20) and the bank vole (n = 14). There was a strong linear relation between ACAN readings and lean mass or water mass. Body temperature did not affected the results, but the readings were dependent on the species and sex of the individuals. That {{could be due to}} differences in the body shape. The accuracy of predicting an average LBM or water mass was very high (1. 5 %), but the errors for predicting individual values were larger (8. 5 %). The predicted fat content values have identical confidence intervals as that for LBM.
