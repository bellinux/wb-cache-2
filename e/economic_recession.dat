40|$|Although {{consumer}} spending typically declines in <b>economic</b> <b>recessions,</b> some observers {{have noted that}} recessions appear to increase women’s spending on beauty products—the so-called lipstick effect. Using both historical spending data and rigorous experiments, the authors examine how and why <b>economic</b> <b>recessions</b> influence women’s consumer behavior. Findings revealed that recessionary cues—whether naturally occurring or experimentally primed—decreased desire for most products (e. g., electronics, household items). However, these cues consistently increased women’s desire for products that increase attractiveness to mates—the first experimental demonstration of the lipstick effect. Additional studies show that this effect is driven by women’s desire to attract mates with resources and depends on the perceived mate attraction function served by these products. In addition to showing how and why <b>economic</b> <b>recessions</b> influence women’s desire for beauty products, this research provides novel insights into women’s mating psychology, consumer behavior, {{and the relationship between}} the two...|$|R

40|$|Before {{the current}} {{financial}} crisis, <b>economic</b> <b>recessions</b> in history were always accompanied by relaxation or abandon of competition policy. However, {{in the current}} financial crisis, although different jurisdictions have different practices, most jurisdictions have kept {{the bottom line of}} competition policy enforcement. Such historical transformation roots in deep reflections on historical failures and the popularization of competition policy as well as the strengthening of the competition authorities. Chinais one of the few countries still weakening competition policy enforcement during the current financial crisis. In fact, there are several mechanisms contained in competition laws and policies, such as the exemption of cartels, the defense of business concentrations and the coordination between competition authorities and sector regulators, which provide some space of flexible competition policy enforcement during <b>economic</b> <b>recessions.</b> Considering China’s short history of competition policy enforcement and consistent tradition of government intervention in economy, it is strongly advised to hold on the bottom line of competition policy and pay more attention to government-led anti-competitive conducts during <b>economic</b> <b>recessions.</b> </p...|$|R

5|$|Buoyed by a {{recovering}} {{global economy and}} ETOPS approval, 767 sales accelerated in the mid-to-late 1980s; 1989 was the most prolific year with 132 firm orders. By the early 1990s, the wide-body twinjet had become its manufacturer's annual best-selling aircraft, despite a slight decrease due to <b>economic</b> <b>recession.</b> During this period, the 767 became the most common airliner for transatlantic flights between North America and Europe. By {{the end of the}} decade, 767s crossed the Atlantic more frequently than all other aircraft types combined. The 767 also propelled the growth of point-to-point flights which bypassed major airline hubs in favor of direct routes. Taking advantage of the aircraft's lower operating costs and smaller capacity, operators added non-stop flights to secondary population centers, thereby eliminating the need for connecting flights. The increased number of cities receiving non-stop services caused a paradigm shift in the airline industry as point-to-point travel gained prominence {{at the expense of the}} traditional hub-and-spoke model.|$|E

Chopra obtained an internship in the marketing department, joining the production company as a public-relations consultant. She considered it a perfect job, because she could use what she had learned and work in films. Chopra had disliked actors and acting; to her, the profession seemed like an excuse to wear too much makeup. This changed when she observed Priyanka's preparations for her role in 7 Khoon Maaf (2011), which highly influenced her and changed her perception towards acting and actors. Once she learnt more about filmmaking, her respect for the profession increased.|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} the {{prediction}} of business cycles, and <b>economic</b> <b>recessions</b> in particular, belongs {{among the most important}} topics of contemporary macroeconomics. However, economists were not considerably successful when dealing with the recession forecasting so far, notably, the Great Recession of the late 2000 s and early 2010 s emerged rather surprisingly. The aim {{of this paper is to}} examine the statistical relationship (in terms of Granger causality) between the Consumer Confi dence Index (CCI) and real GDP growth in the USA from 1960 to 2015 in order to fi nd whether the CCI can be a suitable predictor of the economic growth, or <b>economic</b> <b>recessions</b> respectively. Also the short-term dynamics of four periods covering US <b>economic</b> <b>recessions</b> (1967 - 1978, 1975 - 1985, 1995 - 2005, and 2005 - 2015) was examined. The main results are that the CCI Granger causes GDP in the long-run, with the lag of 6 months. As for shorter periods, the CCI Granger caused GDP in three out of four examined periods, including the Great Recession (with the lag of 3 months), and only for the so called dot-com bubble period Granger causality was reversed, with GDP causing the CCI with the lag of 6 months. These results indicate that the CCI can be considered a suitable predictor of GDP at least for the USA, but more complex and broader study, including other major economics such as the European Union, Germany, or Japan, is certainly needed...|$|R
