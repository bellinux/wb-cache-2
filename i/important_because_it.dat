5|$|Lastly, Asch {{suggested}} that group influence can change how people perceive stimuli (See Asch, 1940 for an example). This {{is the most}} obscure of Asch's major ideas, {{in large part because}} it has not been cited frequently (Levine, 1999), but is none-the-less <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> speaks to the power of group influence.|$|E
5|$|Loughor Castle was {{constructed}} {{on the western}} edge of the Welsh commote, or land unit, of Gwyr. The castle was built shortly after 1106, when Henry de Beaumont, the Earl of Warwick, was given the Gower Peninsula by Henry I. The Anglo-Norman colonisation of the region followed, with Gower becoming a Marcher territory, enjoying extensive local independence. Loughor Castle was strategically <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> controlled the main road running through Gywr from Beaumont's main base at Swansea Castle, and was a valuable coastal port. The castle took its name from a corruption of the title of the Roman fort.|$|E
5|$|The object element: The eyes also {{test support}} of the HTML object element. The object element {{has been a part}} of HTML since HTML 4 was {{released}} in 1998, yet by 2005 it still was not completely supported in all web browsers. The creators of Acid2 considered object element support <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> allows for content fallback—if an object fails to load, then the browser can display alternative (generally simpler, more reliable) content in its place.|$|E

2500|$|Peters {{said that}} [...] "The Galileo is <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>it's</b> really the biggest {{surviving}} movie or TV {{set of the}} modern era. Describing the fictional spacecraft as [...] "the precursor to the space shuttle Enterprise", he added that [...] "it was <b>important</b> to preserve <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> {{is a piece of}} not just TV history, but our space program's history." ...|$|R
5|$|Most {{bacterial}} {{species are}} either spherical, called cocci (sing. coccus, from Greek kókkos, grain, seed), or rod-shaped, called bacilli (sing. bacillus, from Latin baculus, stick). Elongation {{is associated with}} swimming. Some bacteria, called vibrio, are shaped like slightly curved rods or comma-shaped; others can be spiral-shaped, called spirilla, or tightly coiled, called spirochaetes. A small number of species even have tetrahedral or cuboidal shapes. More recently, some bacteria were discovered deep under Earth's crust that grow as branching filamentous types with a star-shaped cross-section. The large surface {{area to volume ratio}} of this morphology may give these bacteria an advantage in nutrient-poor environments. This wide variety of shapes is determined by the bacterial cell wall and cytoskeleton, and is <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> can influence the ability of bacteria to acquire nutrients, attach to surfaces, swim through liquids and escape predators.|$|E
5|$|The first phase, {{known as}} the ‘orange phase’, was {{considered}} to be the most <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> provided South Vietnamese units in I Corps with a platform to stop enemy attacks, and even attack them if necessary. To accomplish the objectives of the ‘orange phase’, General Trưởng placed several elite combat units such as the Ranger groups and armoured forces on constant combat alert. The second phase, {{known as the}} ‘green phase’, was designed to delay enemy forces and buy more time for the South Vietnamese to regroup in order to stage a counter-attack, in the scenario that enemy forces managed to overcome the ‘orange phase’. In the final phase, or the ‘blue phases’, require South Vietnamese units to secure their areas of defence, then destroy and push enemy forces out of I Corps.|$|E
5|$|The {{state of}} Kerala is {{often viewed as}} the ideal {{progressive}} leader in the women’s rights movement in India among states. Kerala maintains very high relative levels of female literacy and women’s health, as well as greater female inheritance and property rights. For example, a 1998 study conducted by Bina Agarwal found that while only 13% of all women in India with landowning fathers inherited that land as daughters, 24% of such women {{were able to do}} so in the state of Kerala. This is <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> has been shown that measures to improve such access to property and economic independence through channels such as education not only directly improve women’s wellbeing and capabilities, but also reduce their risk of exposure to marital or any sort of domestic violence.|$|E

25|$|Geometry is <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> is more {{difficult}} to push water through a long, narrow pipe than a wide, short pipe. In the same way, a long, thin copper wire has higher resistance (lower conductance) than a short, thick copper wire.|$|E

25|$|The {{language}} of category theory provides a concise definition for Lie groups: a Lie {{group is a}} group object {{in the category of}} smooth manifolds. This is <b>important,</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> allows generalization of the notion of a Lie group to Lie supergroups.|$|E
25|$|The {{viscosity}} of lava is <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> {{determines how}} the lava will behave. Lavas with high viscosity are rhyolite, dacite, andesite and trachyte, with cooled basaltic lava also quite viscous; {{those with low}} viscosities are freshly erupted basalt, carbonatite and occasionally andesite.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} thing for Adler is that God (or the idea of God) motivates people to act, and that those actions do have real consequences for ourselves and for others. Our view of God is <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> embodies our goals and directs our social interactions.|$|E

25|$|Sirens {{must also}} be {{approved}} by local agencies, in some cases. For example, the California Highway Patrol approves specific models for use on emergency vehicles in the state.

25|$|The halting {{problem is}} {{historically}} <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> {{was one of}} the first problems to be proved undecidable. (Turing's proof went to press in May 1936, whereas Alonzo Church's proof of the undecidability of a problem in the lambda calculus had already been published in April 1936 (Church, 1936).) Subsequently, many other undecidable problems have been described.|$|E

25|$|The {{investigation}} of the neural correlates of reciprocal imitation is extremely <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> provides an ecological paradigm (a situation close to everyday life) {{to address the issue}} of the sense of agency.

25|$|A copy of {{a revised}} and {{expanded}} Thain's Book was made probably by request of Peregrin's great-grandson and delivered to the Shire.

25|$|Critical {{infrastructure}} protection {{requires the}} development of a national capability to identify and monitor the critical elements and to determine when and if the elements are under attack or are the victim of destructive natural occurrences.
