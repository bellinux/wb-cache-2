5|$|Monetary {{values are}} {{inflated}} to contemporary values using {{changes in the}} British Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This measures the social cost of construction or investment {{as a proportion of}} the economy's total output of goods and services, showing the equivalent social impact in current terms: how much contemporary Britons would need to forgo in order to invest a similar amount of the current British economy.

5|$|Typically {{carried out}} by a {{traditional}} circumciser using a blade, FGM is conducted from days after birth to puberty and beyond. In half the countries for which national <b>figures</b> <b>are</b> <b>available,</b> most girls are cut {{before the age of}} five. Procedures differ according to the country or ethnic group. They include removal of the clitoral hood and clitoral glans; removal of the inner labia; and removal of the inner and outer labia and closure of the vulva. In this last procedure, known as infibulation, a small hole is left for the passage of urine and menstrual fluid; the vagina is opened for intercourse and opened further for childbirth.|$|E
5|$|While Japanese {{submarines}} sank 17 {{ships in}} Australian waters in 1942 (14 {{of which were}} near the Australian coast) the submarine offensive {{did not have a}} serious impact on the Allied war effort in the South West Pacific or the Australian economy. Nevertheless, by forcing ships sailing along the east coast to travel in convoy the Japanese submarines were successful in reducing the efficiency of Australian coastal shipping. This lower efficiency translated into between 7.5% and 22% less tonnage being transported between Australian ports each month (no accurate <b>figures</b> <b>are</b> <b>available</b> and the estimated figure varied between months). These convoys were effective, however, with no ship travelling as part of a convoy being sunk in Australian waters during 1942.|$|E

25|$|Although no exact <b>figures</b> <b>are</b> <b>available,</b> the U.S. Department of Defense {{estimates}} that approximately 15 million Americans are former or current military brats, {{including those who}} spent {{all or part of}} their childhood and/or adolescence in the lifestyle. This population includes an age range from less than 1 years old to over 90 years of age, since there have been military brats for generations. Many military brats spent all of their growing up years in the active lifestyle, some for only part, although military family issues, dynamics and influences may continue nevertheless. Also, not all military brats grow up moving all the time, although many do.|$|E
25|$|In North America, declawing is {{commonly}} performed on cats to prevent damage to household possessions by scratching {{and to prevent}} scratching of people. The surgery involves amputating the distal phalanges of all toes on the front paws, and sometimes the rear paws as well. Although no precise <b>figures</b> <b>are</b> <b>available,</b> peer-reviewed veterinary journal articles estimate that approximately 25% of domestic cats in North America have been declawed. Some privately owned apartment buildings in the U.S. ban cats unless they have been declawed. This {{is not the case}} in publicly subsidized housing, however, because in 2007 the U.S. Congress enacted legislation that forbids public housing authorities from having such rules. Laws have been passed in California (2012) and Rhode Island (2013) that ban landlords from requiring the declawing cats as a condition of occupancy.|$|E
25|$|Since 2002, the ESPY Awards {{ceremony}} {{has been}} conducted on the Wednesday in July following the game.

The show used to air on the subsequent Sunday five days later, with the results announced on ESPN.com and thereafter across media outlets immediately after taping was complete. Since 2010, the ESPY Awards are shown live (the first time was 2003); this helps the network fill airtime that would go unfilled {{because of the lack}} of any major league or high-level college sporting events.|$|E

25|$|The Kurdish {{identity}} {{remains the}} strongest {{of the many}} minorities in modern Turkey. This is perhaps due to the mountainous terrain of the southeast of the country, where they predominate and represent a majority. They inhabit all major towns and cities across Turkey, however. No accurate up-to-date <b>figures</b> <b>are</b> <b>available</b> for the Kurdish population, because the Turkish government has outlawed ethnic or racial censuses. An estimate by the CIA World Factbook places their {{proportion of the population}} at approximately 18%. Another estimate, according to Ibrahim Sirkeci, an ethnic Turk, in his book The Environment of Insecurity in Turkey and the Emigration of Turkish Kurds to Germany, based on the 1990 Turkish Census and 1993 Turkish Demographic Health Survey, is 17.8%. Other estimates include 15.7% of the population according to the newspaper Milliyet, and 23% by Kurdologist David McDowall.|$|E
25|$|Seven Network aired {{the first}} episode as a 90-minute special in January 1982, during the Christmas/New Year non-ratings period, and the {{official}} broadcast date of the final episode was 19 August 1987. There are 972 half-hour episodes, although during the series' original run, later episodes were shown in an hour-long format. No <b>figures</b> <b>are</b> <b>available</b> for {{how many of these}} longer episodes made up the show's run. The series was broadcast on the Seven Network, initially four days a week for half an hour at 19:00, but in later years, in two one-hour shows per week, and finally in one one-hour show per week, although this may have varied in different parts of Australia. Sons and Daughters became the highest rated programme in its slot, and was the most-watched Australian soap of the 1980s. The series eventually began to suffer from declining ratings, and was ultimately cancelled. During the 1990s the programme was repeated throughout Australia, usually in early morning and daytime slots.|$|E
