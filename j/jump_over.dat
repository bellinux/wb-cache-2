They also occur on the ground and in caves, and some are subterranean, {{excavating}} shallow or deep burrows. Some make galleries in rotting wood, and certain beach-dwelling species can run and <b>jump</b> <b>over</b> the surface of pools.|$|E
5|$|Except for {{any move}} of the knight and castling, pieces cannot <b>jump</b> <b>over</b> other pieces. A piece is {{captured}} (or taken) when an attacking enemy piece replaces {{it on its}} square (en passant is the only exception). The captured piece is thereby permanently removed from the game. The king can be put in check but cannot be captured (see below).|$|E
5|$|Lance Murdoch is {{a parody}} of famous daredevils such as Evel Knievel and Matt Murdock, the alter ego of the Marvel Comics superhero Daredevil.

Bart appearing at Springfield Gorge in the distance is based on Omar Sharif's entrance in Lawrence of Arabia.|$|E

5|$|Some affiliative {{behaviors}} are seasonal or gender-specific, {{such as the}} male squeal approach and anogenital inspections performed during the mating season.

5|$|The first {{recorded}} instances of high jumping competitions were in Scotland in the 19th century.

The Gallimimus was the first dinosaur to receive a digital version, being featured in two ILM tests, first as a herd of skeletons and then fully skinned while pursued by the T. rex. Its design was based on ostriches, and to emphasize the birdlike qualities, the animation focused mostly on the herd rather than individual animals. As reference for the dinosaurs' run, the animators were filmed running at the ILM parking lot, with plastic pipes standing in as the tree that the Gallimimus <b>jump</b> <b>over.</b> The footage even inspired to incorporate an animal falling in its leap as one of the artists crashed making the jump. Horse squeals became the Gallimimus sounds.|$|E

5|$|In the {{beginning}} of a match, a 30-second headstart is given to the Monster so that they can have enough time to escape before the Hunters parachute from a plane to where the Monster started. Each map features an open world environment for players to explore and play within. To help the Hunters navigate the environments quickly, they are equipped with jetpacks, allowing them to <b>jump</b> <b>over</b> obstacles and cliffs. The jetpack {{can also be used to}} dodge attacks performed by the monster, though it consumes a Hunter's energy. The team can track the monster, as well as place waypoints on an interactive map. The color of these waypoints are different based on what players have marked. The waypoint mark turns yellow for environment, orange for wildlife or red for the Monster.|$|E
5|$|Slalom is a single-player game {{in which}} players race {{downhill}} {{in a series of}} slalom races. There are 24downhill runs total that are evenly spread across three mountains. Before the game starts, players choose their mountain based on difficulty: Snowy Hill for beginners, Steep Peak for intermediate players, and Mount Nasty for experts. The goal for each run is to reach the finish line within the allotted time. Players must dodge obstacles including trees, flags, snowmen, sledders, and other skiers on their way downhill, or else they will tumble and lose time. With enough momentum, players can <b>jump</b> <b>over</b> these obstacles. Players must ski around flags to maintain their speed. If they ski {{on the wrong side of}} the flag, the racer will snowplow and slow down.|$|E
5|$|Alyeska {{and the oil}} {{companies}} fought objections to the pipeline's construction in both the courts and in Congress, where debates about the pipeline's environmental impact statement continued through 1971. Objections about the caribou herds were countered by observations of Davidson Ditch, a water pipeline with the same diameter of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, which caribou were able to <b>jump</b> <b>over.</b> To those who argued that the pipeline would irrevocably alter Alaska wilderness, proponents pointed to the overgrown remnants of the Fairbanks Gold Rush, most {{of which had been}} erased 70years later. Some pipeline opponents were satisfied by Alyeska's preliminary design, which incorporated underground and raised crossings for caribou and other big game, gravel and styrofoam insulation to prevent permafrost melting, automatic leak detection and shutoff, and other techniques. Other opponents, including fishermen who feared tanker leaks south of Valdez, maintained their disagreement with the plan.|$|E

A few weeks before the division was to participate in a combat <b>jump</b> <b>over</b> the Rhine it was reorganized, after a conference by the War Department had decided that a more efficient composition for an airborne division was two Parachute Infantry Regiments and only a single Glider Infantry Regiment.
