25|$|The {{conventional}} reel or trolling reel {{is similar}} to the baitcasting reel. There are two types of trolling reels, star drag reels and lever drag reels. Star drag reels are like baitcasters, but you move a little lever to put it into free spool. They have a star drag and you have to keep your thumb on them to keep off backlash. The lever drag reel uses the drag to put itself into free spool. It is very difficult to cast a conventional reel, most oven line is dropped behind a boat and left to drift. Conventional reels are <b>for</b> <b>really</b> big fish and are usually used offshore. They are designed for trolling but can also be used for butterfly jigging and Deep-sea fishing ("deep drop"). They are mounted on short rods.|$|E

Alexandra's Woman of the Bedchamber, Charlotte Knollys, the {{daughter}} of Sir William Knollys, served Alexandra loyally for many years. On 10 December 1903, Knollys woke to find her bedroom full of smoke. She roused Alexandra and shepherded her to safety.

500|$|The name [...] "Widmerpool" [...] {{was assumed}} by many critics {{to derive from}} Widmerpool a Nottinghamshire village. In a 1978 interview, Powell said he first came across the name in a 17th-century book, Memoirs of the Life of Colonel Hutchinson, which {{features}} a Captain of Horse, Major Joseph Widmerpoole, who served in Cromwell's army under John Hutchinson during the English Civil War. Powell viewed this Widmerpoole as a mean-spirited and disagreeable character and [...] "had his name down <b>for</b> <b>really</b> {{quite a long time}} as a name I was going to use".|$|E

500|$|Three {{months after}} the release of Goodbye Lullaby (2011), Lavigne {{announced}} that work on her fifth studio album had already begun, having eight songs written. Lavigne stated that the album would musically be the opposite of Goodbye Lullaby, with a release date rumoured for sometime in 2012. Lavigne explained, [...] "Goodbye Lullaby was more mellow, [...] the next one will be pop and more fun again. I already have a song that I know {{is going to be a}} single, I just need to re-record it!." [...] In an interview, Lavigne said about her collaboration with Kroeger: [...] "I have a song called Hello Kitty, which I wrote about Hello Kitty because I'm obsessed, and it's a really fun thing that I've never done before. It kind of has a kind of glitchy, electronic feel to it and it's... the only one on the record that sounds like that. It's really different and a lot of my friends I've played it <b>for</b> <b>really</b> like it. I'm having a lot of fun with that one." ...|$|E

500|$|Writing for The A.V. Club, {{television}} reviewer Hayden Childs {{commented that}} [...] "Exit Through the Kwik-E-Mart" [...] was [...] "somewhat amusing {{and far more}} coherent than many recent episodes, but the satire is relatively mild. The episode curdles a bit while looking for a sweet ending, but it is otherwise solid enough." [...] Critics have praised the opening sequence that parodies Game of Thrones. Tim Surette of TV.com called it [...] "one minute of genius", and MTV's Brandon Freeberg wrote: [...] "Congratulations are in order for Matt Groening and his staff <b>for</b> <b>really</b> knocking this {{one out of the}} park." [...] Jenna Busch of Zap2it and Kelly West of Cinema Blend, both fans of Game of Thrones, named the opening the best {{in the history of the}} show. IGN's Eric Goldman commented: [...] "Ah, The Simpsons. Always there for us with clever/loving parody of something we all love. Such was the case last night, when the animated series opened with an epic opening credit sequence that gave us the Springfield-inspired version of the terrific Game of Thrones credits." ...|$|E
500|$|It had {{not been}} clear to other {{designers}} just what Wright and Chapman had done with the Type 78, but by early 1978, Gordon Murray had grasped how the Lotus design was achieving its remarkable levels of grip. He also realised that the Alfa Romeo flat-12 engine used by Brabham that season was too wide to permit the Venturi tunnels needed <b>for</b> <b>really</b> significant ground effect. At Murray's instigation, Alfa went on to produce a V12 engine for the 1979 season. Ferrari, however, persisted with the flat-12 design and therefore lacked full ground effect until their disastrous 1980 season. In the meantime, Murray's idea was to use another way of reducing the pressure underneath the car. In 1970 the Chaparral 2J [...] "sucker car" [...] had proved significantly faster than its opposition in the North American Can-Am sportscar series. The 2J had two fans {{at the rear of}} the car driven by a dedicated two-stroke engine to draw large amounts of air from under the chassis, reducing pressure and creating downforce. It had suffered from reliability problems with the second engine before being banned by the sporting authorities.|$|E

2500|$|The {{discovery}} {{of gold in}} Australia is traditionally attributed to Edward Hammond Hargraves, near Bathurst, New South Wales, in February 1851.

2500|$|Newkirk {{has been}} accused of {{employing}} a double standard for her organization's practice of euthanizing animals for which it has neither the space nor resources to shelter. Debra Saunders, a critic of Newkirk, argues that [...] "PETA assails other parties for killing animals for food or research. Then it kills animals – but <b>for</b> <b>really</b> important reasons, such as running out of room". Newkirk explains on PETA's website that, [...] "As long as animals are still purposely bred and people aren’t spaying and neutering their companions, open-admission animal shelters and organizations like PETA must do society’s dirty work. Euthanasia is not a solution to overpopulation but rather a tragic necessity given the present crisis." ...|$|E

McLeod considered disbanding the Superjesus but took up lead guitar {{while working for}} their third album as a trio, Rock Music (May 2003), with Marc Waterman producing, which reached No.14. Patch Brown had replaced Henwood, but due to stylistic differences during recording, he was replaced in turn by Jason Slack, a Slippery Rock Graduate. Tim Cashmere of Undercover felt that [...] "they are just as powerful as before" [...] with McLeod [...] "singing better than ever over her chunkier-than-ever riffs." [...] MediaSearch's Carmine Pascuzzi cautioned that [...] "Those who have been ready to write them off should rethink as Sarah McLeod sings beautifully and the band work in harness efficiently to produce a strong effort.

40|$|For {{a variety}} of musical pieces the {{following}} questions are addressed: Are the power spectra of 1 /f form? Are the processes Gaussian? Are the higher-order spectra of 1 /f form?
