40|$|The {{present study}} {{describes}} the biological {{meaning of the}} asymmetrical shape in avian reproduction using quail. During the incubation of eggs, water was gradually lost and the air chamber which appeared in between {{the inner and outer}} shell membranes at the blunt end expanded, so that the angle made by the long egg-axis and the horizontal line increased, presumably because the centre of gravity of the egg contents moved toward the sharp end. The increase in angle occurred in both fertile and infertile eggs, suggesting that this phenomenon occurs irrespective of fertility and is due to the asymmetrical shape. The increase in the volume of the air chamber resulted in an increase {{in the area of the}} <b>inner</b> <b>shell</b> <b>membrane</b> at the chamber to satisfy the amount of gas exchange needed by the developing embryo for better hatching. We isolated a 300 -kDa protein from the <b>inner</b> <b>shell</b> <b>membrane.</b> It was produced by cells in the luminal epithelium of the oviductal isthmus and was found in the cortex of the fibres of shell membranes and a lining surrounding the air chamber. The lining comprised a medial layer between the inner and outer shell membranes in uterine eggs. The asymmetrical ellipsoid produces the air chamber at the blunt end of the avian egg during its sojourn in the oviductal isthmus, to maintain the blunt end up after oviposition and to raise that end during incubation in a dry environment, leading to high hatchability...|$|E
40|$|Thoracosphaera heimii (Lohmann) Kamptner, {{a modern}} thoracosphaerid, and type {{species of the}} genus, was {{isolated}} in Natal, South Africa, and investigated using unialgal cultures and electron microscopy. These observations revealed:(i) The formation of asexual Gymnodinium-like swarmers. (ii) That a calcified coccoid cell, previously {{thought to be a}} coccolithophorid, develops directly from the Gymnodinium-like swarmer. No sexual fusion was observed during the formation of the calcified cell; thus it is not a resting cyst but entirely vegetative. (iii) That the cells contain organelles distinctive of the dinoflagellates, viz. the dinokaryotic nucleus and trichocysts as well as starch which is accumulated in the cytoplasm.

40|$|Abstract — In retinal microsurgery, {{surgeons}} {{are required}} to perform micron scale maneuvers while safely applying forces to the retinal tissue that are below sensory perception. Realtime characterization and precise manipulation of this delicate tissue has thus far been hindered by human limits on tool control {{and the lack of}} a surgically compatible endpoint sensing instrument. Here we present the design of a new generation, cooperatively controlled microsurgery robot with a remote center-of-motion (RCM) mechanism and an integrated custom micro-force sensing surgical hook. Utilizing the forces measured by the end effector, we correct for tool deflections and implement a micro-force guided cooperative control algorithm to actively guide the operator. Preliminary experiments have been carried out to test our new control methods on raw chicken egg <b>inner</b> <b>shell</b> <b>membranes</b> and to capture useful dynamic characteristics associated with delicate tissue manipulations.

40|$|Macroporous ZnO {{membranes}} with {{a strong}} photocatalytic effect and high mechanical flexibility were prepared from <b>inner</b> <b>shell</b> <b>membranes</b> (ISM) of avian eggshells as templates after performing low-temperature ZnO atomic layer deposition (ALD). In order to evaluate the potential merits and general applicability of the ZnO structures, a comparative study of two membranes with coatings of either TiO 2 or ZnO, processed under similar conditions, was performed. The study includes crystallographic features, mechanical and thermal stability and bactericidal efficiency. Both, the ZnO and the TiO 2 coated membranes clearly exhibited bactericidal effects as well as mechanical flexibility and thermal stability even at relatively high temperatures. The ZnO membranes, even though prepared at fairly low temperatures (similar to 100 degrees C), exhibited polycrystalline phases and showed a good bactericidal efficiency as well as higher mechanical flexibility than the TiO 2 coated membranes. This study shows the benefits of low-temperature ZnO ALD i. e., the thermally non-destructive nature, which preserves the mechanical stability and the native morphology of the templates used, together with an added functionality, i. e. the bactericidal effect...|$|R
40|$|Laying hens were {{individually}} caged at 20 {{weeks of}} age and tested for fecal excretion of Campylobacter jejuni (minimum level of detection was 100 cfu/g) during a 42 -week period. Peak rates of C. jejuni isolation (approximately 25 % of hens positive) occurred at two different times, in October and in late April to early May. Before being segregated in late September, birds were allowed to consume fecal matter, litter, and communal drinking water, all likely sources of C. jejuni. The increased excretion rate in late April {{may have been due}} to a climatic change. A small portion (8. 1 %) of the hens chronically excreted (positive less than 30 % of the sampling times) the organism, whereas C. jejuni was not detected in 33 % of the hens, even though birds were likely exposed to the organism before being segregated. No correlation could be made between rates of C. jejuni excretion and egg production. Of 266 eggs from hens fecally excreting C. jejuni, the organism was isolated from two shell surfaces but no egg contents. Egg penetration studies revealed that the organism would not penetrate into the contents of the eggs but could be isolated occasionally from the <b>inner</b> <b>shell</b> and <b>membranes</b> of refrigerated eggs...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: We {{describe}} {{the use of}} chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) as a model system {{for the study of}} the precision and safety of vitreoretinal microsurgical instruments and techniques. Methods: The CAM was prepared for experimentation with and without its <b>inner</b> <b>shell</b> <b>membrane</b> (ISM) attached for in vivo and in vitro experiments that simulated medical and surgical interventions on the retina. Results: The CAM’s ease of use, low cost, and anatomic structure make it a convenient model for surgical retinal and retinal vascular modeling.

40|$|The {{structure}} of the hen 2 ̆ 7 s egg shell {{can be divided into}} five separate layers. The Innermost layer consists of two distinct membranes known as the <b>inner</b> and outer <b>shell</b> <b>membranes.</b> These membranes are compos ed of networks of protein/polysaccharide fibres and are = 70 mm thick. Attached to the outer fibres of the outer membrane are polycrystals of calcite (calcium carbonate) which extend outward in an inverse conical manner until the cones from several sites of crystal i nit iation fuse together. The fibre/ crystal attachment sites, known as basal caps, and the cones form the mammillary knobs layer which is :: 100 - 110 llm thick. After the cones fuse with each other, continuing calcite deposition produces columnar crystals 10 - 30 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 7 m in diameter and ::: 200 llm in length. These crys tals form the palisade layer and are intermingled with a protein/polysaccharide matrix that differs in composition From the <b>shell</b> <b>membranes.</b> Over the columnar crystals is a thin layer (::S - 8 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 7 m thick), known as the vertical crystal layer, of small calcite crystals that are orientated perpendicular to the shell 2 ̆ 7 s surface.

Passing vertically through the palisade layer of the shell from 2 ̆ 2 valleys 2 ̆ 2 between the marrmillary knobs {{to the surface of the}} vertical crystal layer are funnel - shaped, unbranched pores, These pores are capped by the cuticle which is cracked and thus allows the diffusion of gases between the contents of the egg and its environment.

The <b>shell</b> <b>membranes</b> contained relatively large amounts of the sulfur containing amino acids, cystine (9 — 10 %) and methionine (3 — 4 %), suggesting that the protein is a keratin since no hydroxyproline was found.

Acanthoparyphium spinulosum {{was initially}} {{described as an}} intestinal parasite of the plover, Chadrius domincus but may also be obtained experimentally in hatchery-raised chicks. Cloacitrema michiganensis is a cloacal parasite of Actitis macularia, Catotrophorous sempalmatus inornatus, and the seagull, Larus californica.

40|$|A {{practical}} Ship <b>Inner</b> <b>Shell</b> Optimization Method (SISOM), {{the purpose}} {{of which is to}} improve the safety of the seagoing transport ship by decreasing the maximum Still Water Bending Moment (SWBM) of the hull girder under all typical loading conditions, is presented in this paper. The objective of SISOM is to make the maximum SWBM minimum, and the section areas of the <b>inner</b> <b>shell</b> are taken as optimization variables. The main requirements of the ship performances, such as cargo hold capacity, propeller and rudder immersion, bridge visibility, damage stability and prevention of pollution etc., are taken as constraints. The penalty function method is used in SISOM to change the above nonlinear constraint problem into an unconstrained one, which is then solved by applying the steepest descent method. After optimization, the optimal section area distribution of the <b>inner</b> <b>shell</b> is obtained, and the shape of <b>inner</b> <b>shell</b> is adjusted according to the optimal section area.

Subjects and Methods: The particle size of smokeless tobacco forms namely mawa, gutka, khaini, and tobacco leaves was determined by image analysis and the products were subjected on an egg <b>shell</b> <b>membrane</b> subjected to artificial saliva along with constant grinding force. The processed egg <b>shell</b> <b>membrane</b> was then examined by SEM to evaluate the morphology and the degree of diffusion of these particles. Results: The morphometric image analysis revealed khaini to be smallest in size followed by mawa, gutka, and tobacco leaves. The control group (egg <b>shell</b> <b>membrane</b> not subjected to any products) under SEM demonstrated intricately woven collagen meshwork, which was regular in length, branched and anastamosed with each other.
