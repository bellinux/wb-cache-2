40|$|We {{point out}} {{deficiencies}} of previous treatments of liveness. We define a new liveness condition in two forms: {{one based on}} finite trace theory, {{and the other on}} automata.

Finally, we present a verification algorithm for liveness.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to develop surface models of machining processes to simulate machined surface profiles and analyze their structure. In this paper, fractal analysis is used to discover and characterize the variational pattern of turned surfaces. This analysis provides a means of explicitly stating the precision of a machining process. The results are used to further test the validity of the concept of fractal dimensions at tolerance scales and to establish a relation between surface models, experimental surfaces, and fractals. Based on these results, a more complete model of turning is available to designers for choosing process and design parameters and for comparing the precision between competing machining processes. <b>INTRODUCTION</b> Objectives <b>and</b> <b>Scope</b> Manufacturing methods are receiving more attention as a crucial technology for industrial competitiveness.

40|$|<b>INTRODUCTION</b> Purpose <b>and</b> <b>Scope</b> GOME (Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment) is an earth {{observation}} research instrument {{which is}} part of the payload of the European Space Agency's (ESA) ERS [...] 2 (European Remote Sensing Satellite 2) platform. The main objective of GOME is to measure the distribution of ozone and other atmospheric trace gases on a global base. Since for a correct determination of trace gas densities the real absorption path has to be known which differs in cloudy and partial cloudy scenes from clear sky, a cloud recognition algorithm is implemented in the GOME Data Processor (GDP). This recognition algorithm is an initial approach (ICFA = Initial Cloud Fitting Algorithm) which extracts only the fractional cloud cover from radiances in and around the O -band. A more detailed explanation of ICFA is given in [1] and [2].

In fact celebrity endorsers are being used extensively in almost all television advertisements for the promotion of different brands.
