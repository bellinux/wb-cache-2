40|$|The main {{characteristics}} of EU's market in {{fruits and vegetables}} are trend towards overproduction, price fluctuations, and relatively low protection and public support. The key instruments of the CMO are processing aids and support to Operational Funds. The current regulation has been more successful in encouraging improvements in quality and marketing than in stabilising prices and guaranteeing adequate income levels, mainly in fruits and in the great southern countries. The lack of common European action {{in the fields of}} import control and access to new foreign markets creates more pressure in the common market. The proposal of CMO's reform comes after the great CAP's change of 2003 -and its new paradigm- and the budget agricultural agreement until 2013. In practice, this reduces the real policy options for the new regulation. Main changes should occur in processing aids, where forces to decouple are strong; given that <b>exports</b> <b>refunds</b> are already phasing out and markets withdrawals are in decline.

40|$|During 1996 - 2000, U. S. {{imports of}} milk protein {{concentrate}} (MPC) increased rapidly. At the same time, Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) stocks of non-fat dry milk (NFDM) went from nothing {{to more than}} 500 million pounds. Consequently, U. S. milk producers attributed low milk prices and dairy farmer income during this period to the increased imports of MPC. U. S. milk producers were especially concerned with MPC imports for two reasons. First, MPC between 40 and 90 percent protein had been classified in subheading 0404. 90. 10 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS). Thus, MPC was {{not subject to the}} tariff-rate quotas applied to many other dairy products. Second, MPC produced in the European Union (EU) and exported to the United States was eligible for production and export subsidies. Along with the high U. S. internal milk protein prices maintained by the Dairy Price Support Program, and volatile world prices of NFDM, these policies created economic rents for trade in MPC between the European Union and the United States. To test the relationship between these policies and U. S. imports of MPC, these economic rents, which were not directly observable, were estimated by combing a set of identifiable variables: (1) the CCC purchase price, (2) the EU <b>export</b> <b>refund,</b> (3) EU casein production aid, and (4) the world price of NFDM as expressed by the Western Europe export price. A vector autoregression model was then estimated using monthly U. S. imports of MPC and the estimate of economic rents. This estimation showed that nearly 40 percent of the variability in U. S. MPC imports was attributable to the estimate of economic rents. These results demonstrate that U. S. and EU policies can not be analyzed in isolation when evaluating the impact of dairy policies on U. S. MPC imports. Agricultural and Food Policy, International Relations/Trade,...|$|R
40|$|Reports {{from the}} USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) suggest that EU beef {{production}} will be lower in 2003 {{as a result}} of a reduction in both the dairy and beef herds. However, EU beef exports are expected to increase as import restrictions arising from animal disease problems in the EU are lifted. Sales from intervention stocks are likely to continue into 2003. Some beef bought in under the 'special purchase scheme' has already been sent abroad as food aid (to North Korea). It is expected that the market effects of the BSE crisis will continue to fade in 2003 with implications for poultry and pork consumption in the EU. Beef prices in some EU countries have returned to pre-BSE levels. In the long term, however, beef consumption is expected to decline as consumers in France and the UK switch to other meats. Germany, Spain, Ireland and Italy could, however, see some marginal increase in beef consumption. In budgetary terms EU expenditure in the meat sector is expected to grow {{as a result of}} higher <b>export</b> <b>refund</b> allocations to make EU meat exports price competitive, and increased direct aid premiums arising form the Agenda 2000 reforms. A noticeable trend in the EU market is the increased availability of both in-quota and out-of-quota beef imports from South America.

Comment: The growth in less expensive Latin American beef exports could put pressure on ACP beef suppliers, particularly as EU market prices fall in response to further rounds of beef-sector reform.

40|$|In our communication, we give a {{detailed}} analysis {{on the results of}} the EU accession of the Hungarian wine sector, while {{it is one of the}} significant wine producers of New Member States, and we have nearly three years experience of application of the CMO-wine. We show what was expected by the actors of the Hungarian wine industry from this accession. For this reason, we analyze deep interviews made in 2003 with several represents of the wine enterprises and the represents of the professional organizations before the entry to the EU. Then we examine the implementation of the CMO-wine at the level of the national regulation and we analyzed the available statistics (sources: KSH, HNT, MVH) in relation of the measures of the CMO-wine applied in the wine sector, and its effect on the Hungarian wine economy. After that, we study the effect of the EU accession to the Hungarian wine exchange, the wine export and import of the recent period. Finally, we touch upon the probable influence of the actual version of the CMO-wine reform on the Hungarian wine industry. Our study underlines that the operators of the Hungarian wine sector expected a foreseeable and relatively stable regulation system of wine production or wine markets and therefore they projected a rather stable subvention system. Among the CMO-wine measures, for Hungary, the primary is the restructuring and re-conversion of vineyards, but we examine the exploitation of the other CMO-measures like the distillations, the private storage, the aid for musts usage and the <b>export</b> <b>refund</b> for wine exportation into third countries. Then we analyze the tendency of wine export after the EU accession, which reduced drastically during the recent period for the reason that the concurrence is more and more intensive at the international markets and the cause for the lack of marketing investments. At the same time, the structure of wine import has changed. Its volume rests still marginal, but it shows an increasing tendency, particularly in the category of the bottled wine with favourable quality/price rate, which means a direct concurrence for the Hungarian quality wines in the super-, hypermarket and hard discount chains.

40|$|European Union (EU) {{consumers}} pay {{almost twice}} the competitive world price for many agricultural products. Agricultural subsidies accounted {{for almost half}} of the EU's total budget (US$ 40 billion on agriculture in 2000) although agriculture represented 1. 7 percent of the EU's GDP and employs 4. 3 % of the EU's population.

Domestic policies for dairy include <b>export</b> <b>refunds,</b> intervention thresholds, aid for private storage, disposal aid, and milk quotas. The EU's intentions are to enhance agricultural competitiveness by setting product intervention as "a real safety net measure, allowing EU producers to respond to market signals while protecting them from extreme price fluctuations," and promoting market oriented, sustainable agriculture by finishing the transition from product support to producer support, by introducing a "decoupled system of payments per farm" which are not connected to production.

40|$|Proposals for the EU's {{agricultural}} {{offer in}} the WTO negotiations were {{submitted by the}} European Commission to EU agricultural ministers and the Article 133 Committee on December 16 th 2002. The EU proposal suggests the following actions be taken over a six-year period for developed countries and a ten-year period for developing countries: a 55 % cut in trade-distorting farm subsidies; the rolling back of budget expenditures on <b>export</b> <b>refunds</b> by about 45 % on average with the complete dismantling of <b>export</b> <b>refunds</b> on cereals oilseeds, olive oil and tobacco, provided that all other forms of export subsidy are also abandoned for these products (in this context the EU is calling for stronger disciplines to be introduced on export credits, state-run trading enterprises and abuses of food aid); a further opening of agricultural markets by reducing agricultural tariffs by 36 % on average, with a cut of at least 15 % per dutiable item. In addition the EU is proposing that: other developed economies and advanced developing countries should introduce 'Everything but Arms' style treatment for LDCS; there should be support for a 'food security box' involving a special safeguard instrument to ensure food security; there should be recognition of its right to protect the European model of agriculture and the EU position on geographical designations of origin. Securing support for the European model of agriculture includes securing acceptance of the exclusion of internal non trade-distorting rural development support measures from the support reduction commitments. It also involves {{an extension of the}} peace clause, which prevents existing support measures from being challenged in the WTO. The EU sees its proposals as a more practical way of moving the agenda forward rather than the 'extreme and unrealistic position' of the USA and the Cairns Group. In response to the EU proposals the Cairns Group felt that they contravened the Doha commitment to 'reductions of, with a view to phasing out' all forms of export subsidies. The Group also pointed out that the EU make no proposals for phasing out the 'blue box', which allows partly de-coupled payments under production limiting programmes. The Australian Trade Minister Mark Vaile described the EU offer as 'too little too late'. The US described the EU proposal as 'lacking ambition'. Comment: All of the major elements of the EU proposal demand careful scrutiny. For example what is meant by 'trade-distorting subsidies'? The OECD has raised questions as to whether all of the subsidies which the EU describes as non trade-distorting are in fact trade neutral. Second, the EU's commitments on <b>export</b> <b>refunds</b> needs to be seen against the background of the shift to direct aid payments which is allowing the gap between EU and world market prices to be closed. This is doing away with the need for <b>export</b> <b>refunds.</b> During the first round of reform EU export-refund expenditures fell by 45 %. Further reductions in the EU intervention price under the Agenda 2000 reforms have further closed the gap between EU and world market prices. The depreciation of the Euro against the US$ further reduced the need for <b>export</b> <b>refunds</b> (although the recent 10 % appreciation has increased the objective need for <b>export</b> <b>refunds</b> in the last year). It will require detailed calculations based on current price trends and expected exchange rates to determine whether the EU's offer will have any actual impact on the planned level of export-refund expenditures in the coming years Third, the EU's offer to reduce agricultural tariffs by 36 % on average cannot be considered in isolation from the downward trend in EU agricultural market prices driven by the process of CAP reform. With the gap between EU and world market prices closing, the need for tariff protection is diminishing. Here again a detailed consideration of market prices and expected exchange rates is necessary in order to ascertain whether the EU's offer will have any material impact on the agricultural trade position of developing countries. It is possible that the EU is in fact offering very little more than the current trajectory of CAP reform will easily allow, whilst securing benefits in terms of wider recognition of the EU's right to make use of certain support instruments and to secure exclusive use for EU enterprises of some widely recognised geographical labels.

40|$|At the EU Agricultural Council {{meeting on}} April 8 th 2003 the French {{initiative}} for sub-Saharan Africa was discussed. The Commission expressed {{the view that}} it is important to improve preferential market access for sub-Saharan African countries but felt that this required careful scrutiny. The Commission also welcomed the French proposal for a moratorium on all forms of <b>export</b> <b>refunds</b> for goods destined for Africa. Comment: In response to this initiative the ACP Group could usefully put together a dossier of specific market-access improvements which ACP states have been seeking under Declaration XXII and other agricultural trade provisions of the Cotonou Agreement. Such a dossier could be presented to the EU Council of Ministers in the context of further discussions of the French initiative. Possible improvements might include the ending of all quota restrictions on ACP exports of such products as grapes and lamb. It should be borne in mind that the Commission's welcome of a moratorium on <b>export</b> <b>refunds</b> to Africa was conditional upon it being applied by all countries to all types of export support including export credits, food aid and the operations of state enterprises.

40|$|Addressing the UK National Farmers' Union in February 2002, Commissioner Fischler {{reviewed}} the changing pattern of CAP assistance. He pointed out how, before reform, 'the {{primary goal of}} the CAP was to enhance production and make Europe self sufficient' and how this policy had resulted in 'overproduction and exploding costs' which had made reform essential. He pointed out how, before reform, the EU spent 91 % of its agricultural budget on market support but that, in 2002, this had dropped to 28 % of the budget. Instead direct aid payments that compensate farmers for price reductions now account for 63 % of CAP expenditure. He pointed out how, {{as a consequence of}} this shift, 'European products have become more competitive, both domestically and internationally'. He pointed out how price support for wheat had been reduced 40 % since 1992 and that, as a consequence, 'European wheat can be <b>exported</b> without <b>refunds</b> on the world market'. He highlighted that an additional 25 million tons of cereals were now being used on the domestic market. Commissioner Fischler said that the reform process had protected farm incomes and helped 'European farmers to respond to market signals'. The Agenda 2000 reforms involving price reductions were managed in such a way that, across the EU, average farm incomes were not affected. Indeed, in 2001, farm incomes rose on average by 2. 7 %. With reference to the WTO, Commissioner Fischler asserted that 'every society must have the right to choose its own agricultural policy as long as it limits trade distorting effects'. Comment: While Commissioner Fischler maintains that EU farmers are now responding to market signals these signals are fundamentally distorted by the provision of large volumes of direct aid. This means that at any given price level EU farmers are willing to produce more wheat than would be the case if direct aid payments were not being made available. This peculiar meaning given to the concept of 'market signals', needs to be borne in mind in the debate on the impact of CAP reform. It is clear that the EU places a limit on the WTO constraints which it is willing to accept in the agricultural sector.

40|$|The EU and the USA {{presented}} a joint framework to re-launch the WTO agricultural negotiations on August 13 th 2003. The paper makes proposals {{on how to}} deal with each of three major pillars: domestic support; market access; export competition. On domestic support it proposes substantial cuts by all members who use trade-distorting forms of support, recognising that those who subsidise more will have to cut more. Less trade-distorting domestic support should be allowed where: direct payments are based on 'fixed areas and yields or such payments are made on 85 % of less of the base level of production; in the case of livestock programmes payments are made on a fixed number of livestock units; such support does not exceed 5 % of the total value of agricultural production by the end of the implementation period; the sum of allowed support under the aggregate measure of support and de minimis levels are reduced. On market access a hybrid formula is proposed, marrying the gentle across-the-board cuts used in previous international farm agreements with a call for a more aggressive capping of duties in some areas. The importance of the concept of 'sensitive products' is recognised and a special safeguard provision is envisaged for developing countries to protect sensitive products from excessive imports. The framework also proposes lower tariff cuts and longer implementation periods for developing countries. On export competition the framework calls for a 'clearly defined parallelism between the disciplines imposed on <b>export</b> subsidies, <b>refunds</b> and <b>export</b> credits and provides partial elimination of export subsidisation on a list of products of interest to developing countries. Finally it provides a path for parallel reduction of export subsidisation for products on which such support is not eliminated and for the disciplining of the activities of state-trading enterprises. Comment: The EU/US framework has not been warmly received. The Indian representative said it was 'not feasible', adding that 'it does not take account of our farmers interests&# 133; and seems to be an attempt to prise open developing country markets without commitment by rich countries to open theirs'.

40|$|Australia and Brazil are to {{initiate}} action in the WTO against the EU sugar regime, according to the Australian Trade Minister, Mark Vaile, on August 16 th 2002. Mr Vaile maintained that 'EU sugar subsidies have resulted {{in one of the}} least efficient producers becoming one of the largest exporters on the world market'. This he maintained resulted in the distortion of global market conditions and prices. Australia is seeking support from other members of the Global Sugar Alliance for the action it is pursuing through the WTO. The first stage of this action will involve mandatory consultations which should extend over a period of least 60 days, although it could run to over several months. On the basis of this consultation a decision as to whether to proceed with a formal request for legal adjudication will be made. Comment: This challenge, if successfully pursued in the WTO, is likely to result in stricter WTO limits on EU sugar exports, reducing the allowable <b>refunded</b> <b>exports</b> by an amount equivalent to the EU's preferential imports of ACP (plus Indian) sugar. This would not necessarily result in any pressure on the ACP quota, but it may simply (like similar developments in the rice sector) intensify pressure on EU member states to bite the bullet of sugar-sector reform, involving a shift from price support to direct aid payments. Any such process of reform would directly affect the value of ACP sugar preferences, with the European Commission having estimated that a 25 % reduction in the EU sugar price would result in income losses to ACP sugar exporters of around € 250 million a year.

30|$|Agricultural {{policies}} play an import {{role within}} the dairy industry. The EU dairy industry, for example, {{is subject to}} the CAP. In the past, the CAP focused on maintaining adequate and stable prices for particular dairy commodities, such as butter and SMP. In turn, it was expected that the enhanced returns from these commodities would be transmitted to the farm gate price for milk. This aim was mainly achieved by purchasing to intervention stores, setting production quotas, <b>export</b> <b>refunds,</b> import tariffs and subsidized consumption. These measures resulted in isolating EU dairy commodity prices from lower and more volatile World prices. However, more recent changes to the CAP, and in particular the Luxembourg 2003 agreement, resulted in a greater market orientation with a lower level of price support (intervention buying, 9 import tariffs and <b>export</b> <b>refunds)</b> for EU dairy commodities. To compensate for the resultant losses, the Single Payment Scheme (SPS) was introduced to provide income support at farm level. In addition, the supply quota, introduced in 1984, expired in 2015. This aim of bringing EU dairy prices more in line with World prices was observed in O’Connor and Keane (2011) who reported a convergence of volatility between EU and World dairy commodity prices. A more comprehensive discussion of the CAP policy changes can be found in Keane and O’ Connor (2015).|$|E

Changes in the market are expected in response to 'the January 2003 announcement by Russia of its tariff-rate quota, which is expected to limit imports of beef, pork and poultry' and in the longer term the implementation of the CAP mid-term review proposals and EU enlargement. Comment: The Russian decision to limit imports of beef, poultry and pork through a TRQ system could leave considerable volumes of EU poultry meat looking for new markets. The impact this could have on ACP poultry sectors, particularly in west and central Africa will be determined by {{the extent to which these}} markets can directly replace former Russian markets. Already in west Africa there are growing complaints over increased EU poultry exports, which have arisen on the back of EU cereals-sector reform (which has substantially reduced EU poultry production costs).

The accuracy and specificity of the primers was assessed using DNA template extracted from cattle meat of known sex. The protocol was subjected to a blind test and showed 100 % concordance, proving its accuracy and reliability...|$|E
