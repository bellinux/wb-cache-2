5|$|The pouring {{process has}} an {{influence}} on a beer's presentation. The rate of flow from the tap or other serving vessel, tilt of the glass, and position of the pour (in the centre or down the side) <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> all influence the end result, such as the size and longevity of the head, lacing (the pattern left by the head as it moves down the glass as the beer is drunk), and the release of carbonation.|$|E
5|$|Most beers are {{cleared of}} yeast by {{filtering}} when packaged in bottles and cans. However, bottle conditioned beers retain some yeast—either by being unfiltered, or by being filtered and then reseeded with fresh yeast. It is usually {{recommended that the}} beer be poured slowly, leaving any yeast sediment {{at the bottom of}} the bottle. However, some drinkers prefer to pour in the yeast; this practice is customary with wheat beers. Typically, when serving a hefeweizen wheat beer, 90% of the contents are poured, and the remainder is swirled to suspend the sediment before pouring it <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>glass.</b> Alternatively, the bottle may be inverted prior to opening. Glass bottles are always used for bottle conditioned beers.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{returns to}} the present day. Margaret prepares some orange juice and {{paracetamol}} for Glynis's migraine. She finds a scrap book of press cuttings surrounding Victor's death in Glynis's kitchen drawer and realises that her new friend is responsible for his demise. As ominous music plays, Margaret thoughtfully looks at the box of paracetamol. She drops some tablets <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> {{and hands it to}} Glynis, who realises that her secret has been uncovered. Glynis explains that the night she was driving she had been told that her husband was close to death and wasn't concentrating on the road properly. As a result, she didn't realise she was about to hit Victor {{until it was too late}} and had stopped, but left when she saw Margaret arrive. She also tells Margaret how sorry she is and how she never meant to hurt anyone, seeking Margaret out in order to try and help her get over Victor's death. Margaret watches her drink some of the orange juice before leaving the house and driving away, with it never being revealed if she'd followed through with her promise to kill the person responsible for Victor's demise.|$|E

25|$|A small flip tap {{and a short}} spout is the {{standard}} neck for dispensing cask ale. An alternative is a long spout with a tight 180° turn, called a swan-neck, {{which is designed to}} force the beer <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>glass,</b> agitating it so that a fuller head is created. Some drinkers disapprove of swan-necks, believing that flavour is reduced. In some pubs a small device or cap, known as a sparkler, is fitted {{to the end of the}} spout and acts like a sprinkler at the end of a hose pipe. This can be twisted to regulate the flow of the beer. When the sparkler is tight, the beer is severely agitated resulting in a creamy head; it is softer and creamier with less bitterness.|$|E

25|$|The Rangers {{suffered}} {{two more}} injuries during their 0–3 shutout {{loss to the}} Canadiens on February 23. McDonagh was hit <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> by forward Max Pacioretty, requiring 14 stitches near his mouth and forcing {{him out of the}} next game. Dan Girardi was injured when a shot by P. K. Subban struck his ankle, but he did not suffer a fracture and missed no games. The Rangers started a four-game homestead on February 26 with a 4–3 loss to the Winnipeg Jets. Callahan received a standing ovation after blocking two shots and making two hits despite lacking a stick, but it failed to rally the Rangers. New York broke their losing streak with a 4–1 win against Tampa Bay on February 28, a game that also saw the return of Nash, Del Zotto and McDonagh. Nash scored a goal and made a career-high 12 shots in the game, and Hagelin scored his seventh goal of the season, tying him with Gaborik as the team's lead goal-scorer. The game brought their season penalty kill percentage to ninth best in the league. Kreider, who had one goal and one assist in 11 games, was sent back to the Whale on February 28.|$|E
25|$|Work on {{the glass}} panels also proceeded. The DVLMF hired Cloud Gehshan Associates {{to assist with the}} {{selection}} of quotations for the panels. Research into the speeches and writings of famous disabled veterans was made, and hundreds of interviews with disabled veterans conducted. More than 700 quotations were gathered, but just 18 of them—representing a wide diversity of voices spread through time—were used. Initially, a New York-based firm was hired to fabricate the glass panels, but this company backed out of the project. Savoy Studios, a glass manufacturing firm located in Portland, Oregon, was then hired to inscribe and fabricate the panels. Individual sheets of glass were purchased from PPG Industries. Savoy Studios used a computer-controlled water jet cutter to carve the text into them. Moon Shadow Glass, a decorative glass fabricator (known for sandblasting artwork onto vandalized bus shelter glass for the TriMet bus system in Portland) used fine-art abrasive blasting to etch the photo-realistic images <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>glass.</b> Savoy Studios then used GlassLam, a liquid polymer trademarked by the GlassLam company of Pompano Beach, Florida, to laminate the glass sheets together into a panel. The laminate not only cemented the sheets together, but also filled in any empty spaces between the sheet. Savoy Studios then used a computer-controlled water jet to cut the panels to their final size.|$|E

25|$|An {{important}} advance made in {{the early}} 19th century was developing a technique to remove the sediment caused by dead yeast after the secondary fermentation. Early Champagne producers chose not to remove the sediment, which left the wine cloudy and prone to off flavors if the sediment was shaken up or poured <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>glass.</b> At royal courts and banquets, servers would pour new serving of Champagne into a fresh glass to avoid the residue of sediment left over in the previous glass. To remove the sediments, some producers would decant the wine by pouring it a new bottle. However this process caused {{a considerable amount of}} carbon dioxide gas to escape and the resulting wine was noticeably less bubbly. With the aid of her cellar master, Madame Clicquot of the Champagne house Veuve Cliquot developed the process of riddling in the early 19th century {{to solve the problem of}} sediments without losing much gas. This technique, which involves collecting the sediment in the neck of the bottle and using the pressure of the wine to eject just the sediment, led to the popularity of adding sugar-sweet dosage to replace the wine lost during riddling. The Russians, in particular, were fans of very sweet Champagne and Veuve Cliquot was able to tailor the sweetness level of their wines for their customers by the composition of their dosage. At first the house of Veuve Cliquot tried to keep this technique of riddling a secret but by the late 1820s the secret was out and Champagne houses were settling up production lines for riddling. In 1854, the French national railroad system linked Reims with the rest of the country, including its coastal ports. From that point on, Champagne was connected to its worldwide market and sales grew by leaps and bounds. During the 1850s production was averaging 20 million bottles a year.|$|E
