500|$|Dave Mustaine {{served as}} the lead guitarist for Metallica during their early days. However, due to drinking, {{substance}} abuse, violent behavior, and personality conflicts with band mates James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich, Mustaine was soon fired from Metallica. Two months after being dismissed, he and bassist David Ellefson formed Megadeth in Los Angeles. Mustaine later recalled: [...] "After getting fired from Metallica, all <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>is</b> that I wanted blood. Theirs. I wanted to be faster and heavier than them." [...] Fueled by the desire for revenge, Mustaine elevated the intensity of Megadeth's music in order to challenge his former band. He sped up existing songs such as [...] "Mechanix", which Metallica's new line-up adapted into the slower paced [...] "The Four Horsemen". Mustaine included his original version of the song on the album to [...] "straighten Metallica up", as Metallica referred to Mustaine as a drunk and {{said he could not}} play guitar.|$|E
500|$|On the bridge, Beyoncé sings {{about having}} drunken {{sex in the}} kitchen: [...] "We {{woke up in the}} kitchen saying / How the hell did this shit happen / Oh baby, drunk in love, we be all night / Last thing <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>is</b> our {{beautiful}} bodies grinding off in that club". The second verse of the song is half-rapped by her. Jay-Z later appears to provide his rapped verse as he compares his relationship with Beyoncé to that of Ike and Tina Turner. He forgoes subtlety as he raps, [...] "Foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol/ Slid the panties right to the side/ Ain't got the time to take drawers off on sight... your breasteses is my breakfast". Similarly to Beyoncé, Jay-Z sings about the places they have had sex in their house. During his lines, he raps about [...] "reppin' that Third", a reference to the Third Ward area located in Houston.|$|E
2500|$|I {{came through}} a praty street or ever I entered Bermingham. This street, as <b>I</b> <b>remember,</b> <b>is</b> called Dirty (Deritend). In it dwells smiths and cutlers {{and there is}} a brooke that divides this street from Bermingham ........ There be many smiths in the towne, that use to make knives and all manner of cutting tools, and many lorimers that make bittes, and a great many naylours, so that a great part of the towne is {{maintained}} by smiths, who have their iron and sea-coal out of Staffordshire." ...|$|E

2500|$|Pryor is in tears, {{with blood}} {{running down her}} neck, in a {{videotape}} made by artist Clayton Patterson. Another video made by freelance cameraman Paul Garrin shows officers swinging clubs at him and slamming him against a wall. [...] Photographer John McBride, taking still photos of the riot that were {{to be published in}} The Village Voice, was also struck by a policeman's nightstick in the same attack taped by Garrin. Mr. Fish, a travel promoter out for an evening on the town, attempted to hail a taxi on Avenue A near Sixth Street when he was suddenly struck on the head. [...] "I was just standing there watching," [...] he said. [...] "The next thing that <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>is</b> seeing the stick, and then a young woman who was helping me." [...] Patterson's videotape showed that no officers helped Fish until an ambulance arrived. A police helicopter hovered over the scene, contributing to a sense of chaos.|$|E
2500|$|The {{recording}} subsequently drew {{comment from}} the entire band; other than the composer (McCartney), none appear to have fond memories of their work on the song: Lennon said [...] "I was ill after the accident when they did most of that track, and it really ground George and Ringo into the ground recording it", adding later [...] "I hate it, 'cos all <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>is</b> the track... did everything {{to make it into}} a single, and it never was and it never could have been." [...] Harrison characterised the song as [...] "fruity" [...] and commented [...] "we spent {{a hell of a lot}} of time on it", and later [...] "after a while, we did a good job on it". Starr added retrospective input on the finished result in a Rolling Stone article from 2008: [...] "The worst session ever was 'Maxwell's Silver Hammer.' It was the worst track we ever had to record. It went on for fucking weeks. I thought it was mad." [...] McCartney recalled: [...] "The only arguments were about things like me spending three days on Maxwell's Silver Hammer. I remember George saying, 'You've taken three days, it's only a song.' – 'Yeah, but I want to get it right. I've got some thoughts on this one.' It was early-days Moog work and it did take a bit of time".|$|E
