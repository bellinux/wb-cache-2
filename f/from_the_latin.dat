5|$|Rubidium and caesium {{were the}} first {{elements}} to be discovered using the spectroscope, invented in 1859 by Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchhoff.

The names of rubidium and caesium come from the most prominent lines in their emission spectra: a bright red line for rubidium (<b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Latin</b> word rubidus, meaning dark red or bright red), and a sky-blue line for caesium (derived <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Latin</b> word caesius, meaning sky-blue).|$|E

A phrase of Gothic is quoted in an elegiac couplet <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Latin</b> Anthology, and more substantially parts of the Gospels were translated into Gothic and preserved by the 6th-century Codex Argenteus.

5|$|The unit {{structure}} of the Auxilia also differed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Latin</b> alae, which were like legions with a larger cavalry arm. Augustus however organised the Auxilia into regiments the size of cohorts (a tenth the size of legions), due to the much greater flexibility of the smaller unit size. Further, the regiments were of three types: ala (cavalry), cohors (peditata) (infantry) and cohors equitata (mixed cavalry/infantry).|$|E
