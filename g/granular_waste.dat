40|$|Contaminated <b>granular</b> <b>wastes</b> are {{potentially}} reusable {{because they have}} similar {{physical and chemical properties}} as primary raw building materials. From environmental aspects, the reuse must not result in polluting the soil, groundwater and surface water. Therefore the leaching values of inorganic components such as heavy metals and the composition of organics must be under certain limits. From technical aspects, the physical properties must meet the technical requirements of the intended application. Both of environmental contaminants and technical pollutants must be removed or reduced. The main aims of quality improvement are to reduce leaching values and to increase the reusability of materials. For this purpose, the selection of suitable separation and cleansing techniques is important. Effective techniques guarantee the liberation of materials, by which, the useful materials and contaminants are broken apart from each other. Any difference in physical properties of individual components, like size, shape, density, magnetism, surface wettability, electrical conductivity and colour, can be used as the basis for separation of materials. A methodology to improve the quality by separation treatment is proposed in this thesis. Criteria are set up for the selection of techniques, and it discusses how to evaluate separation treatment in a long term by eco-efficiency and in a short term by economic costs and/or benefits. Three waste streams are studied: construction and demolition waste (CDW), municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) bottom ash and dredged sludge.

The granular aggregates {{used in this}} material were crushed recycled concrete and masonry. This results in six different types of phases in the mixture: recycled concrete, recycled masonry, mortar, interface between recycled concrete and mortar, interface between recycled masonry and mortar and interface between recycled concrete and masonry. In order to numerically analyze the fracture behavior of cement treated demolition waste, a cross section image of a cylindrical specimen (? 150 mm) for monotonic indirect tensile test (ITT) was digitized and processed to obtain a multiphase lattice image showing every individual phase. The mesh area used for the lattice model was 1 mm 2. Simulation results show that when the simulated ITT loading direction varies on the image, the simulated indirect tensile strengths (ITS) have a larger scatter compared to the variation of experimental results of ITS in the laboratory. This indicates that the numerical simulation of cemented <b>granular</b> demolition <b>waste</b> using a 2 D lattice model is strongly influenced by the loading direction on the simulated image.

The results demonstrated that the 28 -d compressive strength of sediment blocks produced with coal fly ash and lime partially replacing cement at a binder-to-sediment ratio of 3 : 7 {{could be used as}} fill materials for construction. The X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that hydration products (calcium hydroxide) were difficult to form at high sediment content. Thermal pretreatment of sediment removed 90 % of indigenous organic matter, significantly increased the compressive strength, and enabled reuse as non-load-bearing masonry units. Besides, 2 -h CO 2 curing accelerated early-stage carbonation inside the porous structure, sequestered 5. 6 % of CO 2 (by weight) in the sediment blocks, and acquired strength comparable to 7 -d curing. Thermogravimetric analysis indicated substantial weight loss corresponding to decomposition of poorly and well crystalline calcium carbonate.

Their effective reuse and recycling as fill materials for earthwork construction, embankments and/or structural fill materials in port expansion projects, is economically attractive and environmentally sustainable because it lessens the need for disposal and sourcing of materials from local quarries. As the need for blending these materials arises from their individual adverse geotechnical characteristics, i. e. swelling and breakage behaviour in SFS and CW, it is important to evaluate the suitability of different mixtures ratios particularly in terms of shear strength and swelling potential to meet various performance criteria for structural fills.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the sample selection, sample preparation, environmental, and regulatory considerations for shipment of Hanford radioactive waste samples for treatability {{studies of the}} FBSR process at the Savannah River National Laboratory and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) Hanford tank farms contain approximately 57 million gallons of wastes, most of which originated during the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel to produce plutonium for defense purposes. DOE intends to pre-treat the tank waste to separate the waste into a high level fraction, that will be vitrified and disposed of in a national repository as high-level waste (HLW), and a low-activity waste (LAW) fraction that will be immobilized for on-site disposal at Hanford. The Hanford Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP) {{is the focal point}} for the treatment of Hanford tank waste. However, the WTP lacks the capacity to process all of the LAW within the regulatory required timeframe. Consequently, a supplemental LAW immobilization process will be required to immobilize the remainder of the LAW. One promising supplemental technology is Fluidized Bed Steam Reforming (FBSR) to produce a sodium-alumino-silicate (NAS) waste form. The NAS waste form is primarily composed of nepheline (NaAlSiO{sub 4 }), sodalite (Nas[AlSiO{sub 4 }]{sub 6 }Cl{sub 2 }), and nosean (Na{sub 8 }[AlSiO{sub 4 }]{sub 6 }SO{sub 4 }). Semivolatile anions such as pertechnetate (TcO{sub 4 }{sup -}) and volatiles such as iodine as iodide (I{sup -}) are expected to be entrapped within the mineral structures, thereby immobilizing them (Janzen 2008). Results from preliminary performance tests using surrogates, suggests that the release of semivolatile radionuclides {sup 99 }Tc and volatile {sup 129 }I from <b>granular</b> NAS <b>waste</b> form is limited by Nosean solubility. The predicted release of {sup 99 }Tc from the NAS waste form at a 100 meters down gradient well from the Integrated Disposal Facility (IDF) was found to be comparable to immobilized low-activity waste glass waste form in the initial supplemental LAW treatment technology risk assessment (Mann 2003). To confirm this hypothesis, DOE is funding a treatability study where three actual Hanford tank waste samples (containing both {sup 99 }Tc and {sup 125 }I) will be processed in Savannah River National Laboratory's (SRNL) Bench-Scale Reformer (BSR) to form the mineral product, similar to the <b>granular</b> NAS <b>waste</b> form, that will then be subject to a number of waste form qualification tests. In previous tests, SRNL have demonstrated that the BSR product is chemically and physically equivalent to the FBSR product (Janzen 2005). The objective {{of this paper is to}} describe the sample selection, sample preparation, and environmental and regulatory considerations for treatability studies of the FBSR process using Hanford tank waste samples at the SNRL. The SNRL will process samples in its BSR. These samples will be decontaminated in the 222 -S Laboratory to remove undissolved solids and selected radioisotopes to comply with Department of Transportation (DOT) shipping regulations and to ensure worker safety by limiting radiation exposure to As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA). These decontamination levels will also meet the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's (NRC's) definition of low activity waste (LAW). After the SNRL has processed the tank samples to a granular mineral form, SRNL and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) will conduct waste form testing on both the granular material and monoliths prepared from the granular material.

The primary bioreceptivity of the tiles was evaluated by quantifying colonisation by the algae Chlorella vulgaris (C. vulgaris), which was selected as a model photosynthetic micro-organism. Concentrations of C. vulgaris were measured using chlorophyll-a extraction. Relationships between bioreceptivity and the properties of the porous glass tile, including porosity, sorptivity, translucency and pH are reported. Capillary porosity and water sorptivity were the key factors influencing the bioreceptivity of porous glass. Maximum C. vulgaris growth and colonisation was obtained for tiles sintered at 700 °C, with chlorophyll-a concentrations reaching up to 11. 1 ± 0. 4 μg/cm 2 of tile. Bioreceptivity was positively correlated with sorptivity and porosity and negatively correlated with light transmittance. The research demonstrates that the microstructure of porous glass, determined by the processing conditions, significantly influences bioreceptivity. Porous glass tiles with high bioreceptivity that are colonised by photosynthetic algae have the potential to form carbon-negative façades for buildings and green infrastructure...|$|E
40|$|International audienceStabilization and {{solidification}} {{of hazardous}} waste before storage in an engineered landfill has been used at an industrial scale for more than 10 years in several European countries. The European decision 2003 / 33 specifies a waste acceptance criteria (WAC) for <b>granular</b> <b>waste</b> {{but there is still}} no common rules for monolithic waste. One alternative is to define WAC from reverse environmental impact calculations based on compliance of the storage site release with drinkable water criteria at the local water table. However - and contrarily to reactive transport modeling - most published studies do {{not take into account the}} physical-chemical processes taking place in the waste and the liners, as well as their long-term evolution with time. Such a simplification can lead to very low acceptance criteria, especially for salts. Chloride and sulfates salts are the major species in air pollution control (APC) residues, which represent the majority of treated waste in France and the Netherlands. A model of the stabilized waste material was set on total element content, mineralogy and physical parameters (diffusion, porosity, density). In a first stage, the model was validated on dynamic leaching tests by modeling element release and mineralogical evolution of leached monoliths. The model was also used to simulate a French compliance leaching test. Modeling is in good agreement with experiment in both cases. These results show that limit values defined by European decision on chloride and total dissolved solid (TDS) are not equivalent. For the studied sample, chloride release is very close to the European limit (25 000 mg/kg) while TDS release is well below the European limit (10 %). In a second stage, the model was extended to assess the impact of landfilling stabilized waste on groundwater resources. Modeling hypotheses were similar to the scenario of the European Technical Application Committee (TAC) prescribed for defining acceptance criteria on <b>granular</b> <b>waste,</b> i. e. assuming a complete failure of the geomembranes, a defective drainage system and no effect of the cover slope. The evolution of the waste chemistry and the migration of the pollutant plume were modeled for undamaged monoliths in agreement with recent studies based on the examination of aged site samples. Chloride content in the water table at the point of compliance infinite source term, which is physically impossible as the waste cannot release more chloride than it contains. Chlorides were then assumed to be present in very mobile phases or partly trapped as less soluble Friedel's salts (a chloroaluminate cement phase). Chloride concentrations at POC are below the drinkable water thresholds in both cases, and systematically lower when chlorides are trapped as Friedel's salts. This reactive transport modeling study shows that landfill of monoliths as presently managed should have a negligible impact on the water table. This coupled model is also important for bridging the gap between compliance tests and field conditions. Field modeling is consistent with WAC based on a short monolithic leaching test and the existing TDS limit. Therefore, it is likely that no stricter WAC will need to be defined on salt release for monolithic waste...|$|E
40|$|Fluidized Bed Steam Reforming (FBSR) {{is being}} {{considered}} as a potential technology for the immobilization {{of a wide variety}} of radioactive wastes but especially aqueous high sodium wastes at the Hanford site, at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL), and at the Savannah River Site (SRS). The FBSR technology converts organic compounds to CO{sub 2 } and H{sub 2 }O, converts nitrate/nitrite species to N{sub 2 }, and produces a solid residue through reactions with superheated steam, the fluidizing media. If clay is added during processing a ''mineralized'' <b>granular</b> <b>waste</b> form can be produced. The mineral components of the waste form are primarily Na-Al-Si (NAS) feldspathoid minerals with cage-like and ring structures and iron bearing spinel minerals. The cage and ring structured minerals atomically bond radionuclides like Tc{sup 99 } and Cs{sup 137 } and anions such as SO{sub 4 }, I, F, and Cl. The spinel minerals appear to stabilize Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) hazardous species such as Cr and Ni. Durability testing of the FBSR products was performed using ASTM C 1285 (Product Consistency Test) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Toxic Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP). The FBSR mineral products (bed and fines) evaluated in this study were found to be two orders of magnitude more durable than the Hanford Low Activity Waste (LAW) glass requirement of 2 g/m{sup 2 } release of Na{sup +}. The PCT responses for the FBSR samples tested were consistent with results from previous FBSR Hanford LAW product testing. Differences in the response can be explained by the minerals formed and their effects on PCT leachate chemistry...|$|E
40|$|Sodium bearing waste (SBW) {{disposition}} {{is one of}} the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) Idaho Operation Office’s (NE-ID) and State of Idaho’s {{top priorities}} at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL). Many studies have resulted in the identification of five treatment alternatives that form a short list of perhaps the most appropriate technologies for the DOE to select from. The alternatives are (a) calcination with maximum achievable control technology (MACT) upgrade, (b) steam reforming, (c) cesium ion exchange (CsIX) with immobilization, (d) direct evaporation, and (e) vitrification. Each alternative has undergone some degree of applied technical development and preliminary process design over the past four years. DOE desired further experimental data, with regard to steam reforming technology, to make informed decisions concerning selection of treatment technology for SBW. Mineralizing steam reforming technology, offered by THOR Treatment Technologies, LLC would produce a denitrated, <b>granular</b> mineral <b>waste</b> form using a high-temperature fluidized bed process. A pilot scale demonstration of the technology was performed in a 15 -cm-diameter reactor vessel September 27 through October 1, 2004. The pilot scale equipment is owned by the DOE, and located at the Science and Technology Applications Research (STAR) Center in Idaho Falls, ID. Flowsheet chemistry and operational parameters were defined through a collaborative effort involving Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL), and THOR Treatment Technologies personnel. Personnel from Science Applications International Corporation, owners of the STAR Center, operated the pilot plant. The pilot scale test was terminated as planned after achieving a total of 100 hrs of cumulative/continuous processing operation. About 230 kg of SBW surrogate were processed that resulted in about 88 kg of solid product, a mass reduction of about 62 %. The process achieved about a 90 % turnover of the starting bed. Samples of mineralized solid product materials were analyzed for chemical/physical properties. Results of product performance testing conducted by SRNL will be reported separately by SRNL...|$|R
40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) documented, in 2002, a {{plan for}} {{accelerating}} cleanup of the Hanford Site, located in southeastern Washington State, by at least 35 years. A key element of the plan was acceleration of the tank waste program and completion of &# 39;&# 39;tank waste treatment by 2028 by increasing {{the capacity of the}} planned Waste Treatment Plant (WTP) and using supplemental technologies for waste treatment and immobilization. &# 39;&# 39; The plan identified steam reforming technology as a candidate for supplemental treatment of as much as 70 % of the low-activity waste (LAW). Mineralizing steam reforming technology, offered by THOR Treatment Technologies, LLC would produce a denitrated, <b>granular</b> mineral <b>waste</b> form using a high-temperature fluidized bed process. A pilot scale demonstration of the technology was completed in a 15 -cm-diameter reactor vessel. The pilot scale facility was equipped with a cyclone separator and heated sintered metal filters for particulate removal, a thermal oxidizer for reduced gas species and NOx destruction, and a packed activated carbon bed for residual volatile species capture. The pilot scale equipment is owned by the DOE, but located at the Science and Technology Applications Research (STAR) Center in Idaho Falls, ID. Pilot scale testing was performed August 2 – 5, 2004. Flowsheet chemistry and operational parameters were defined through a collaborative effort involving Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL), Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL), and THOR Treatment Technologies personnel. Science Application International Corporation, owners of the STAR Center, personnel performed actual pilot scale operation. The pilot scale test achieved a total of 68. 4 hours of cumulative/continuous processing operation before termination in response to a bed de-fluidization condition. 178 kg of LAW surrogate were processed that resulted in 148 kg of solid product, a mass reduction of about 17 %.
