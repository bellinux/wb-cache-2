40|$|<b>Insight</b> <b>into</b> {{psychotic}} symptoms {{is typically}} poor in schizophrenia; however, {{it is not}} known whether <b>insight</b> <b>into</b> neurocognitive impairment is similarly impaired. Most people with schizophrenia experience cognitive dysfunction, and the deficits in attention, memory, and critical thinking have been associated with poor functional outcome. As new treatments are developed for the cognitive impairments, it will be important to know whether patients will be receptive to yet another therapy. Insight {{is an important factor in}} treatment compliance and treatment outcome; however, {{it is not known}} if patients have <b>insight</b> <b>into</b> their cognitive dysfunction. In order to assess <b>insight</b> <b>into</b> neuro cognitive dysfunction, 75 subjects were administered the Measure of <b>Insight</b> <b>into</b> Cognition–Clinician Rated, a newly created measure based on the Scale to Access the Unawareness of Mental Disorder, that assesses <b>insight</b> <b>into</b> cognitive impairment. Subjects were also administered the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia and Independent Living Scale–Problem Solving to objectively assess neuropsychological status and problem-solving skills needed for independent living. Results demonstrated that virtually all subjects had cognitive impairment, yet <b>insight</b> <b>into</b> their neuro cognitive symptoms was limited. This finding has potential implications for treatment programs seeking to improve cognitive functioning in schizophreni...|$|R
