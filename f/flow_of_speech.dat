5|$|Stuttering (alalia syllabaris), {{also known}} as {{stammering}} (alalia literalis or anarthria literalis), is a speech disorder in which the <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> is disrupted by involuntary repetitions and prolongations of sounds, syllables, words or phrases, and involuntary silent pauses or blocks during which the person who stutters is unable to produce sounds. The exact etiology of stuttering is unknown; both genetics and neurophysiology are thought to contribute. There are many treatments and speech-language pathology techniques available that may help increase fluency in some stutterers {{to the point where}} an untrained ear cannot identify a problem; however, there is essentially no cure for the disorder at present.|$|E

2500|$|Stuttering, {{also known}} as stammering, is a speech {{disorder}} in which the <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> is disrupted by involuntary repetitions and prolongations of sounds, syllables, words or phrases as well as involuntary silent pauses or blocks in which the person who stutters is unable to produce sounds. The term stuttering is most commonly associated with involuntary sound repetition, but it also encompasses the abnormal hesitation or pausing before speech, referred to by people who stutter as blocks, and the prolongation of certain sounds, usually vowels or semivowels. According to Watkins et al., stuttering is a disorder of [...] "selection, initiation, and execution of motor sequences necessary for fluent speech production." [...] For many people who stutter, repetition is the primary problem. The term [...] "stuttering" [...] covers {{a wide range of}} severity, encompassing barely perceptible impediments that are largely cosmetic to severe symptoms that effectively prevent oral communication. In the world, approximately four times as many men as women stutter, encompassing 70 million people worldwide, or about 1% of the world's population.|$|E

60|$|With an {{involuntary}} gasp Mrs. Travers lowered the glass.

60|$|The exclamation {{came from}} Steve, and it stopped Mrs. Porter like a bullet.

60|$|Mr. Peters, in his {{character}} of showman, {{threw himself into}} his work with even more than his customary energy. His <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> never faltered. He spoke of the New Kingdom, the Middle Kingdom, Osiris and Ammon; waxed eloquent concerning Mut, Bubastis, Cheops, the Hyksos kings, cylinders, bezels and Amenophis III; and became at times almost lyrical when touching on Queen Taia, the Princess Gilukhipa of Mitanni, the lake of Zarukhe, Naucratis and the Book of the Dead. Time slid by.|$|E

And here he was with all his {{excellence}} heightened and accentuated by the polish of the city. He had filled out. His clothes were wonderful. And his voice, when he spoke, had just that same musical quality.|$|E
50|$|A {{milestone}} {{was reached}} in 1694; the final lapse of the Licensing Order of 1643 {{that had been}} put in place by the Stuart kings put an end to heavy-handed censorship that had previously tried to suppress the <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> free <b>speech</b> and ideas across society, and allowed writers to criticise the government freely. From 1694 to the Stamp Act of 1712 the only censure laws forbade treason, seditious libel and the reporting of Parliamentary proceedings.|$|R
60|$|As my {{business}} {{was with the}} manager of this Great National Fancy Shop, I managed to push by the sad-eyed, eager-faced crowd {{of men and women}} in the anteroom, and entered the secretary's room, conscious of having left behind me a great deal of envy and uncharitableness of spirit.

60|$|Several weeks went by, {{during which}} Saxon was often with her.

And then, one afternoon, Saxon found Mrs. Higgins more voluble than usual, with words, clean-uttered, that rippled and tripped in their haste to escape. Her eyes were flaming. So flamed her face. Her words were flames. There was a smell of liquor {{in the air and}} Saxon knew that the old woman had been drinking. Nervous and frightened, at the same time fascinated, Saxon hemstitched a linen handkerchief intended for Billy and listened to Mercedes' wild <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'Good old Jackson,' said Charteris, 'have a shot tonight. I'll {{hold the}} watch. I'm doing a leader on the melancholy {{incident}} for next month's Glow Worm. It appears that Master Reginald Robinson, {{a member of}} Mr Merevale's celebrated boarding-establishment, was passing by the Pavilion at an early hour {{on the morning of}} the second of April--that's today--when his eye was attracted by an excavation or incision in one of the windows of that imposing edifice. His narrative appears on another page. Interviewed by a Glow Worm representative, Master Robinson, who is a fine, healthy, bronzed young Englishman of some thirteen summers, with a delightful, boyish <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech,</b> not wholly free from a suspicion of cheek, gave it as his opinion that the outrage was the work of a burglar--a remarkable display of sagacity in one so young. A portrait of Master Robinson appears on another page.' ...|$|E
60|$|He paused with swift awkwardness, again {{confounded by}} his unwonted <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech.</b> Never {{in his life}} had he been stirred to such utterance, and never in his life had there been cause to be so stirred. For it was the Game that had been questioned, its verity and worth, the Game itself, the biggest thing in the world--or {{what had been the}} biggest thing in the world until that chance {{afternoon}} and that chance purchase in Silverstein's candy store, when Genevieve loomed suddenly colossal in his life, overshadowing all other things. He was beginning to see, though vaguely, the sharp conflict between woman and career, between a man's work in the world and woman's need of the man. But he was not capable of generalization. He saw only the antagonism between the concrete, flesh- and-blood Genevieve and the great, abstract, living Game. Each resented the other, each claimed him; he was torn with the strife, and yet drifted helpless on the currents of their contention.|$|E
50|$|Céline's {{first novel}} is {{probably}} most remarkable for its style. Céline makes {{extensive use of}} ellipsis and hyperbole. His writing has the <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> natural <b>speech</b> patterns and uses the vernacular, while also employing more erudite elements. This has influenced French literature considerably. The novel enjoyed popular success and {{a fair amount of}} critical acclaim when it was published in October 1932. Albert Thibaudet, perhaps the greatest of the entre-deux-guerres critics, said that in January 1933 it was still a common topic of conversation at dinner parties in Paris.|$|R
40|$|Could {{a machine}} have an {{immaterial}} mind? The author argues that true conscious machines can be built, but rejects artificial intelligence and classical neural networks {{in favour of}} the emulation of the cognitive processes <b>of</b> the brain-the <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> inner <b>speech,</b> inner imagery and emotions. This results in a non-numeric meaning-processing machine with distributed information representation and system reactions. It is argued that this machine would be conscious; it would be aware of its own existence and its mental content and perceive this as immaterial. Novel views on consciousness and the mind...|$|R
50|$|Miss Bates has as {{her main}} {{characteristic}} an unending <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> trivial <b>speech,</b> freely associating from one unimportant event to another - something {{which was to}} make her an immediate comic success among Austen's first readership. Many of the clues to the book's intrigue are in fact artfully concealed and revealed within her verbose patter. Her speech is overtly a recognition of her grateful dependence on her neighbours, {{but it can also}} be seen, in its overwhelming impact on all other discourses, as almost tyrannical in its passive-aggressive self-assertion.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was only}} slowly {{that it came}} to him that he might ask for the [...] "wind-vane offices" [...] {{whatever}} the [...] "wind-vane offices" [...] might be. His first enquiry simply resulted in a direction to go on towards Westminster. His second led to the discovery of a short cut in which he was speedily lost. He was told to leave the ways to which he had hitherto confined himself--knowing no other means of transit--and to plunge down one of the middle staircases into the blackness of a cross-way. Thereupon came some trivial adventures; chief of these an ambiguous encounter with a gruff-voiced invisible creature speaking in a strange dialect that seemed at first a strange tongue, a thick <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> with the drifting corpses of English Words therein, the dialect of the latter-day vile. Then another voice drew near, a girl's voice singing, [...] "tralala tralala." [...] She spoke to Graham, her English touched with something of the same quality. She professed to have lost her sister, she blundered needlessly into him he thought, caught hold of him and laughed. But a word of vague remonstrance sent her into the unseen again.|$|E
6000|$|Tallente {{found his}} {{thoughts}} playing strange pranks with him. No man appreciated {{the greatness of}} Dartrey more than he. No man, perhaps, had a more profound conviction as to the truth and future {{of the principles of}} which he had become the spokesman. He realised the irresistible power of the new democracy. He was perfectly well aware that it was within Dartrey's power to rule the country whenever he chose. Yet there seemed something shadowy about these things, something unpleasantly real and repulsive in the familiarity of his companion, in the thought of association with him, He battled with the idea, treated it as a prejudice, analysed it. From head to foot the man wore the wrong clothes in the wrong manner,--boots of a vivid shade of brown, thick socks without garters, an obviously ready-made suit of grey flannel, a hopeless tie, an unimaginable collar. Even his ready <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> suggested the gifts of the tubthumpers his indomitable persistence, a lack of sensibility. He knew his facts, knew all the stock arguments, was brimful of statistics, was argumentative, convincing, in his way sincere. Tallente acknowledged all these things and yet found himself wondering, with a grim sense of irony, how he could call a man [...] "Comrade" [...] with such finger nails! ...|$|E

But you can't see this thing from my side of the fence. Business is business. In business the best man wins. The law upheld those transactions of mine the honesty of which you questioned. As to mining and water claims, you lost on this technical point--that you had nothing to prove you had held them for five years. Five years is the time necessary in law. A dozen men might claim the source of Forlorn River, but if they had no house or papers to prove their squatters' rights any man could go in and fight them for the water. .... Now I want to run that main ditch along the river, through your farm. Can't we make a deal? I'm ready to be liberal--to meet you more than halfway. I'll give you an interest in the company. I think I've influence enough up at the Capitol to have you reinstated as inspector. A little reasonableness on your part will put you right again in Forlorn River, with a chance of growing rich. There's a big future here.... My interest, Belding, has become personal. Radford is in love with your step-daughter. He wants to marry her. I'll admit now if I had foreseen this situation I wouldn't have pushed you so hard. But we can square the thing. Now let's get together not only in business, but in a family way. If my son's happiness depends upon having this girl, you may rest assured I'll do all I can to get her for him. I'll absolutely make good all your losses. Now what do you say?" ...|$|E
