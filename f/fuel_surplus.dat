Great strides have been made in our understanding of the molecular basis for these associations, and a number of hypotheses have been put forward. One seemingly counterintuitive hypothesis is the “adipose tissue expandability hypothesis, ” which suggests that the relative accumulation of adipose mass per se may not be directly causative in obesity-related metabolic abnormalities; instead, adipose tissue function and plasticity are the key determinants. Although adipose tissue is arguably the most plastic organ in our bodies, it cannot expand indefinitely—particularly in the face of years of chronic <b>fuel</b> <b>surplus.</b> Furthermore...|$|E

40|$|Water {{shortages}} {{have been}} {{for a long time}} a serious problem in the Middle East as well as other parts of the world. The large and arid land of the Middle East has also been dependant on water which is provided by few rivers. This issue has been tackled by researchers, orientalists and exploration associations (Palestine Exploration Fund 1882, and Oliphant, 1880). The aim {{of this paper is to}} tackle ways of managing and solving chromic water shortages and hydropolitical tensions in the Middle East. None of the Middle Eastern Countries enjoys water surplus with exception of Turkey. Fortunately, some Arab countries such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, United Arab Emirates and Oman which suffers from water shortages enjoys <b>fuel</b> <b>surplus.</b> These countries are trying to solve their water shortages by using underground water and heavily investing in water desalination. Other countries like Palestine, Lebanon, Syria and Iraq are losing their grip on their national water as a result of sever and perpetuated conflicts which have never ended since the First World War. In terms of technological progress Middle Eastern countries are also differentiated. In this respect, Turkey managed to develop itself and upgrade its social and economic conditions, but most of Arab countries are lacking behind. All of Middle Eastern countries enjoy and share rich cultural heritages related to water management and consumption. Such a richness will help to upgrade peoples’ awareness regarding water consumptions and uses in different economic sectors. Middle Eastern countries suffer from physical water scarcity and the neighboring regions in Africa, Europe and Latin America suffers from economic water scarcity. In addition the regions are of little or no water scarcity lie in Northern Eurasia and Antarctica. As a result of these differences, this paper will suggest ways in which concerned countries and professional organizations may take part in bridging the gap between such physical and economic water scarcities. A projected model of cooperation between Middle Eastern countries in terms of natural resources, cultural, economic, and social enterprises needs to be developed. In addition, International community has to take part in introducing solutions to conflicts of Arabs and Israel, Iraq, Iran, Cyprus, Afghanistan, and Yemen...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} how changes in fueling strategy in the second cycle of engine operation influence the delivered charge fuel mass and engine out hydrocarbon (EOHC) emissions in that and subsequent cycles. Close attention will be paid to cycle-to-cycle interaction of the fueling strategy. It is our intent to see if residual fuel from each cycle has a predicable influence on subsequent cycle's charge mass and EOHC emissions. The fast flame ionization detector is employed to measure both in-cylinder and engine out hydrocarbon concentrations for various cold start strategies. The manufacturer's original fueling strategy is used as a starting point and is compared to a "in-cylinder fuel air ratio (Phi) [approx. ] 1 " case (a fueling strategy that results in an in-cylinder concentration of approximately stoichiometric for each of the first five cycles) and to a number of cases that are chosen to illustrate cycle-to-cycle mixture preparation dependence on second cycle fueling. Significant cycle-to-cycle dependence is observed with the change in second cycle.

As well as producing high yields of sugar, much of the plant 2 ̆ 7 s fibre is also recovered and used as a source of renewable energy. A life cycle assessment (LCA) of sugarcane production and processing in Australia was performed to develop an environmental profile of sugarcane as a source of bio-products. The application examined was fermentation products from sugar. The sugarcane results were compared with results for other sugar producing crops—US corn and UK sugar beet—to gauge its relative environmental performance. The results show sugarcane to have an advantage in respect of energy input, greenhouse gas emissions and possibly acidification potential due to its high saccharide yield and the displacement of fossil <b>fuels</b> with <b>surplus</b> renewable energy from cane fibre (bagasse). However Australian sugarcane can exhibit high nitrous oxide emissions, which would reduce greenhouse gas advantages in some regions.

However, when {{a fuel cell}} is controlled to meet a house's electrical load, {{there may be an}} excess amount of heat that is available in the summer when a house's thermal requirements are minimal. The objective of this work is to investigate the feasibility of coupling an adsorption system to a residential fuel cell cogeneration system for the seasonal storage of the <b>fuel</b> cell's <b>surplus</b> thermal output. A mathematical model of an adsorption storage system is developed, by applying first principles, and implemented into the ESP-r building energy simulation program.

Finally, the predicted annual energy performance of a house served by a fuel cell cogeneration system coupled to an adsorption storage system is compared to the predicted annual energy performance of two alternate heating systems using ESP-r, taking into account the dynamic nature of the house's electrical and thermal loads. For the set of operating conditions considered in the study, the adsorption storage unit is able to improve the overall energy performance of the residential fuel cell cogeneration system in the winter but not in the summer.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{an exercise in}} estimating {{the costs and benefits}} of technology-based fuel economy improvements for automobiles and light trucks. Benefits quantified include vehicle costs, <b>fuel</b> savings, consumers' <b>surplus</b> effects, the effect of reduced weight on vehicle safety, impacts on emissions of CO 2 and criteria pollutants, world oil market and energy security benefits, and the transfer of wealth from U. S. consumers to oil producers. A vehicle stock model represents sales, scrappage and vehicle use effects under three fuel price scenarios. Three alternative fuel economy levels for 2001 are considered, ranging from 32. 9 to 36. 5 miles per gallon (MPG) for cars and 24. 2 to 27. 5 MPG for light trucks. Overall, fuel economy improvements of this size are probably cost-effective. The size of the benefit, and even whether there is a benefit, strongly depends on the financial costs of fuel economy improvement and judgments about the values of energy security, emissions, safety, etc. Three sets of values for eight parameters are used to define the sensitivity of costs and benefits to key assumptions. The net present social value (1989 $) of costs and benefits ranges from a cost of $ 11 billion to a benefit of $ 286 billion. The two largest components are always the direct vehicle costs and fuel savings, but these tend to counterbalance each other for the fuel economy levels examined here. Other major components are the wealth transfer, oil cost savings, CO 2 emissions reductions, and energy security benefits. Safety impacts, emissions of criteria pollutants and consumers' surplus effects are relatively minor components. ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Sugarcane is {{the most}} {{efficient}} crop for production of (1 G) ethanol. Additionally, sugarcane bagasse {{can be used to}} produce (2 G) ethanol. However, the manufacture of 2 G ethanol in large scale is not a consolidated process yet. Thus, a detailed economic analysis, based on consistent simulations of the process, is worthwhile. Moreover, both ethanol and electric energy markets have been extremely volatile in Brazil, which suggests that a flexible biorefinery, able to switch between 2 G ethanol and electric energy production, could be an option to absorb fluctuations in relative prices. Simulations of three cases were run using the software EMSO: production of 1 G ethanol + electric energy, of 1 G + 2 G ethanol and a flexible biorefinery. Bagasse for 2 G ethanol was pretreated with a weak acid solution, followed by enzymatic hydrolysis, while 50 % of sugarcane trash (mostly leaves) was used as <b>surplus</b> <b>fuel.</b> Results: With maximum diversion of bagasse to 2 G ethanol (74 % of the total), an increase of 25. 8 % in ethanol production (reaching 115. 2 L/tonne of sugarcane) was achieved. An increase of 21. 1 % in the current ethanol price would be enough to make all three biorefineries economically viable (11. 5 % for the 1 G + 2 G dedicated biorefinery). For 2012 prices, the flexible biorefinery presented a lower Internal Rate of Return (IRR) than the 1 G + 2 G dedicated biorefinery. The impact of electric energy prices (auction and spot market) and of enzyme costs on the IRR was not as significant as it would be expected...|$|R
40|$|To {{demonstrate}} that buildings can be heated and cooled without burning any carbon <b>fuel</b> by capturing <b>surplus</b> (non-carbon) freely available {{heat in the}} summer and retrieving the heat on demand in winter. Cooling is by storing energy in the ground for use on demand. Specifically, the objectives are: • to prove that hard play/traffic surfaces can be used as efficient large-scale solar collectors • to show that interseasonal heat transfer (IHT) can be achieved by surface treatment of the ground and shallow ground thermal storage without construction of expensive contained heat stores. • to provide an exemplar for active solar heating and interseasonal cooling of buildings capable of widespread replication. SUMMARY The project includes the design, installation and monitoring of a heating and cooling system for a new Exemplar Sustainable Primary School using IHT. IHT is a process by which heat energy is collected and balanced between periods of supply and demand. Heat energy from the sun is collected during the summer and stored for use in the winter. Energy for cooling is collected during the winter and stored for summertime use. This significant new technology is able to meet major energy demands without further depleting carbon fuels or causing environmental damage. Computer modelling is being undertaken in parallel with system monitoring. This will be refined and checked against sensors in the installation and the system will be refined using results of the modelling. This combination of modelling and monitoring ensures that the demonstration is thoroughly checked and verified and can therefore be a reliable and impressive platform for bringing IHT to wider attention and ensuring successful replication...|$|R

40|$|The {{air quality}} of Hong Kong (HK), {{especially}} at the street level, has {{been a matter of}} grave public concern. In 2007, road transport was reportedly the major source for emission of carbon monoxide (CO) and respirable suspended particulates (RSP), as well as the second largest source for emission of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOC). The Government has taken various measures to curb roadside pollution. Recent technological breakthroughs in electric vehicles (EVs) have regenerated the Government's interest in promoting the wider use ofEVs. The main objectives ofthis paper are to examine whether road transport-related measures adopted by the Government have been effective in coping with the air pollution problem and whether the EV policy would improve the air quality ofHK. The Government has taken a more proactive approach, since 1999, in dealing with roadside pollution problems. The emission of all major air pollutants from road transport against the continuous growth in the numbers of vehicles and vehicle kilometers travelled reduced significantly between 1994 and 2007. The reduction of S 02, RSP and CO in this time period was 95 %, 70 % and 59 % respectively. Nonetheless, air pollution in HK remams an unresolved problem as reflected by continuous rising trends in the hours with poor visibility, days with roadside Air Pollution Index exceeding 100, and concentration of some air pollutants exceeding the Air Quality Objectives. EVs have zero tailpipe emission but its potential in improving the air quality has been skeptical because part of the emission may be transferred to the power plants. Through quantitative analysis, it was found that if all vehicles in HK were converted to EVs, the overall emission of NOx, RSP, CO and VOC would reduce by 77. 3 %, 89. 9 %, 99. 4 % and 99. 4 % respectively but that of S 02 would suffer a regrettable 13. 5 -fold increase. It was concluded that the wider use of EVs should be beneficial to the air quality of HK but the potential benefits would depend on the number of vehicles to be converted and simultaneous measures to cut S 02 emission at the power sources. A qualitative analysis was made on factors affecting the change of vehicles to EVs. It was found that consumer decisions on EV purchases are likely influenced by availability, choice of models, driving range, reliability, whole life costing, and adequacy of infra structural support. The use of greener <b>fuel</b> and <b>surplus</b> electricity generation capacity as a means to reduce emissions from power plants were also explored. The paper concludes by making recommendations to encourage use of EVs and to maximize its potential benefits. It is expected that the Goverrunent will {{play an important role in}} implementing EV-related policies and prioritizing measures to reap immediate benefits. published_or_final_versionTransport Policy and PlanningMasterMaster of Arts in Transport Policy and Plannin...|$|R
40|$|This report {{provides}} a comprehensive {{summary of the}} waste package (WP) related impacts of the Plutonium Disposition waste forms that are being developed and evaluated by the Office of Fissile Materials Disposition of the DOE. These waste forms are of two distinct types. One type is mixed oxide spent nuclear fuel (MOX SNF), which would be received from one or more commercial nuclear reactors using MOX <b>fuel</b> prepared from <b>surplus</b> weapons plutonium. The other type is plutonium immobilized in ceramic disks, which would be embedded in HLW glass in the standard HLW glass disposal canister. The ceramic disks would occupy approximately 12 % of the HLW canister volume, {{while most of the}} remaining 88 % of the volume would be occupied by HLW glass. The studies reported here have been ongoing for five years, and much of the work has been presented in one of four previous annual reports. This is the first of the reports to be subject to requirements of the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Quality Assurance Requirements (DOE 1998 a and CRWMS M&O 1999 p). This compliance is necessary in order that the results presented here be applicable to the major upcoming OCRWM project statutory and licensing documents: the Site Recommendation, and the License Application. It is, therefore, necessary to confirm some of the results from the prior year's reports. A summary distinguishing the results that are new this year is given {{at the end of this}} executive summary. The two basic WP designs used for this study are identical to those that have been used for the commercial SNF and the HLW glass; they are used here for the MOX SNF and the immobilized plutonium, respectively. These WP designs were used for the OCRWM Viability Assessment of a Repository at Yucca Mountain (VA) document, which was recently delivered to the US Congress. The improved performance expected with these new WP designs will be covered in the Waste Package Related Impacts report for next year...|$|R
