5|$|<b>Emotions</b> <b>are</b> {{generally}} {{defined as}} two-step multicomponent processes involving elicitation, followed by psychological feelings, appraisal, expression, autonomic responses, and action tendencies. Attempts to localize basic emotions to certain brain regions have been controversial, with some research finding {{no evidence for}} specific locations corresponding to emotions, and instead circuitry involved in general emotional processes. The amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, mid and anterior insula cortex and lateral prefrontal cortex, appeared {{to be involved in}} generating the emotions, while weaker evidence was found for the ventral tegmental area, ventral pallidum and nucleus accumbens in incentive salience. Others, however, have found evidence of activation of specific regions, such as the basal ganglia in happiness, the subcallosal cingulate cortex in sadness, and amygdala in fear.|$|E
25|$|Unilateral {{activation}} of the amygdala due to fearful stimuli may also produce unilateral {{activation of}} other regions. The right middle temporal gyrus, right brainstem, left hippocampus, right cerebellum, right fuisform gyrus, and left lingual gyrus were also activated during fearful stimuli. Activation of multiple brain regions both indicates that <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> processed {{in many parts of}} the brain and that <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> complex.|$|E
25|$|<b>Emotions</b> <b>are</b> also {{expressed}} through the colours of the costumes, {{a key element}} in kabuki. Gaudy and strong colours can convey foolish or joyful emotions, whereas severe or muted colours convey seriousness and focus.|$|E
50|$|Arlie Russell Hochschild, a sociologist, {{depicted}} two {{accounts of}} emotion. The organismic <b>emotion</b> <b>is</b> the outburst of emotions and feelings. In organismic <b>emotion,</b> emotions/feelings <b>are</b> instantly expressed. Social {{and other factors}} do not influence how the <b>emotion</b> <b>is</b> perceived, so these factors have no control on how or if the <b>emotion</b> <b>is</b> suppressed or expressed.|$|R
50|$|Theories on emotion {{have focused}} on perception, {{subjective}} experience, and appraisal. Predominant theories of emotion and emotion perception include what type of <b>emotion</b> <b>is</b> perceived, how <b>emotion</b> <b>is</b> perceived somatically, and at what stage of an event <b>emotion</b> <b>is</b> perceived and translated into subjective, physical experience.|$|R
40|$|<b>Emotion</b> <b>is</b> an {{important}} parameter of chasing between two virtual humans; a computational <b>emotion</b> model <b>is</b> an interesting topic.

25|$|Most {{studies on}} emotion in {{negotiations}} focus {{on the effect of}} the negotiator's own emotions on the process. However, what the other party feels might be just as important, as group <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> known to affect processes both at the group and the personal levels.|$|E
25|$|While some {{research}} indicates that psychological resilience is a relatively stable personality trait, new research suggests that positive <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> critical to trait resilience. This {{is not to say}} that positive <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> merely a by-product of resilience, but rather that feeling positive emotions during stressful experiences may have adaptive benefits in the coping process of the individual. Empirical evidence for this prediction arises from research on resilient individuals who have a propensity for coping strategies that concretely elicit positive emotions, such as benefit-finding and cognitive reappraisal, humor, optimism, and goal-directed problem-focused coping. Individuals who tend to approach problems with these methods of coping may strengthen their resistance to stress by allocating more access to these positive emotional resources. Social support from caring adults encouraged resilience among participants by providing them with access to conventional activities.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the oldest}} issues of <b>emotion</b> <b>is</b> the one that {{believes}} emotion indicates inferiority. In early psychology, {{it was believed that}} passion (<b>emotion)</b> <b>was</b> a part of the soul inherited from the animals and that it must be controlled.

5000|$|Another {{study that}} had 32 {{participants}} listen to twelve musical pieces {{and found that}} the strength of perceived and elicited <b>emotions</b> <b>were</b> dependent on the structures of the piece of music.

On the other hand, elicited <b>emotions</b> <b>were</b> stronger than perceived emotions when rating for pleasantness.|$|R

25|$|The nokasayas or the six non-passions are: hasya (laughing, joking {{or making}} fun of), rati (prejudicial liking or impartiality), arati (improper conduct) soka (sorrow), bhaya (fear), and jugupsa (disgust). All these six <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> charitra mohaniyas, because the soul which is {{subjected}} to them, is hindered through them {{in the practice of}} right conduct.|$|E
25|$|<b>Emotions</b> <b>are</b> {{complex and}} involve {{a variety of}} {{physical}} and cognitive responses, {{many of which are}} not well understood. The general purpose of emotions is to produce a specific response to a stimulus. Feelings are the conscious perception of emotions, and when an emotion occurs frequently or continuously this is called a mood.|$|E

40|$|This study reports {{quantitative}} research into two basic dimensions of emotions: pleasantness and arousal. Fifty-nine participants evaluated these two dimensions {{for a set}} of twenty-five positive emotions in relation to human-product interactions. Three levels of arousal were iden- tified: ‘exciting’, ‘median’ and ‘calm’. Nine <b>emotions</b> <b>were</b> found to be exciting, namely energetic, euphoria, amusement, desire, joy, love, inspiration, lust and surprise. Ten <b>emotions</b> <b>were</b> found to be median in arousal, namely fascination, satisfaction, confidence, pride, anticipation, enchant- ment, courage, hope, worship and admiration. Six <b>emotions</b> <b>were</b> found to be calm, namely relaxation, relief, kindness, dreaminess, respect and sympathy. Three levels of pleasantness were also identified: ‘very pleasant’, ‘mildly pleasant’ and ‘pleasant’. Six <b>emotions</b> <b>were</b> found to be very pleasant, namely amusement, joy, satisfaction, inspiration, euphoria and love. Thirteen <b>emotions</b> <b>were</b> found to be mildly pleasant, namely relief, relaxation, kindness, dreaminess, con- fidence, fascination, pride, enchantment, anticipation, energetic, desire, lust and surprise. Finally six <b>emotions</b> <b>were</b> found to be pleasant, namely respect, sympathy, admiration, courage, hope and worship.

50|$|Similar to the {{sociology}} of emotions or anthropology of emotions, the history of <b>emotions</b> <b>is</b> {{based on the assumption}} that not only the expression of feelings, but also the feelings themselves are learned. Culture and history are changing and so are feelings as well as their expression. The social relevance and potency of <b>emotions</b> <b>is</b> historically and culturally variable. In the view of many historians, <b>emotion</b> <b>is,</b> therefore, just as fundamental a category of history, as class, race or gender.|$|R

40|$|Going {{along the}} {{questions}} of how, when {{and to what extent}} does empathy arise in humans, we propose an approach to model empathy for EMMA – an Empathic MultiModal Agent – based on three processing steps: First, the Empathy Mechanism by which an empathic <b>emotion</b> <b>is</b> produced. Second, the Empathy Modulation by which the empathic <b>emotion</b> <b>is</b> modulated. Third, the Expression of Empathy by which EMMA’s modulated empathic <b>emotion</b> <b>is</b> expressed through her multiple modalities.

25|$|In modern {{scientific}} thought, certain refined <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> {{considered a}} complex neural trait innate {{in a variety}} of domesticated and non-domesticated mammals. These were commonly developed in reaction to superior survival mechanisms and intelligent interaction with each other and the environment; as such, refined emotion is not in all cases as discrete and separate from natural neural function as was once assumed. However, when humans function in civilized tandem, it has been noted that uninhibited acting on extreme emotion can lead to social disorder and crime.|$|E

25|$|Motivations {{direct and}} {{energize}} behavior, while emotions provide the affective component to motivation, positive or negative. In the early 1970s, Paul Ekman and colleagues began {{a line of}} research which suggests that many <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> universal. He found evidence that humans share at least five basic emotions: fear, sadness, happiness, anger, and disgust. Social emotions evidently evolved to motivate social behaviors that were adaptive in the EEA. For example, spite seems to work against the individual but it can establish an individual's reputation as someone to be feared. Shame and pride can motivate behaviors that help one maintain one's standing in a community, and self-esteem is one's estimate of one's status.|$|E

Once receptors were blocked, both the rat and the human were exposed to pleasurable food, but both were disinclined to eat the food.|$|E
