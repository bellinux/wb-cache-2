5|$|Booth's {{body was}} {{shrouded}} {{in a blanket}} and tied {{to the side of}} an old <b>farm</b> <b>wagon</b> for the trip back to Belle Plain. There, his corpse was taken aboard the ironclad USS Montauk and brought to the Washington Navy Yard for identification and an autopsy. The body was identified there as Booth's by more than ten people who knew him. Among the identifying features used {{to make sure that the}} man that was killed was Booth was a tattoo on his left hand with his initials J.W.B., and a distinct scar on the back of his neck.|$|E
60|$|As Tom {{finished}} a large <b>farm</b> <b>wagon</b> rattled into sight, drawn {{by a pair}} of bony horses and driven by a tall, lank farmer.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, Jack! {{what is it}} all about?" [...] demanded Randy, {{while his}} twin looked on questioningly. The boys' {{shotguns}} and game {{had been taken from}} the <b>farm</b> <b>wagon,</b> and now the pair from the Lacy farm drove away.|$|E
50|$|Long before modern {{piggyback}} services, the LIRR began carrying <b>farm</b> <b>wagons</b> aboard flatcars in 1885.|$|R

50|$|He died in 1918 in Wenham, Massachusetts when {{he drove}} his car into a woodpile while {{attempting}} to avoid <b>farm</b> <b>wagons</b> travelling {{side by side on}} the road.|$|R
60|$|The boys {{walked down}} the roadway which had been {{followed}} by the hunters the day before. They had covered only a short distance when they saw a <b>farm</b> <b>wagon</b> approaching, with Captain Dale beside it on his horse.|$|E
60|$|The {{road was}} uphill, leading {{directly}} from the lake shore. But soon Ralph was overtaken by {{a man in a}} <b>farm</b> <b>wagon.</b> It was some one he knew fairly well and the man asked him up on the seat.|$|E
60|$|Sorrowfully we left Huckleberry's {{unfinished}} race, reluctantly {{we climbed}} into the <b>farm</b> <b>wagon,</b> sticky with candy, dusty, tired, some of us suffering with sick-headache, and rolled away homeward to milk the cows, feed the pigs and bed down the horses.|$|E
50|$|<b>Farm</b> <b>wagons</b> {{are built}} for general {{multi-purpose}} usage in an agricultural or rural setting. These include gathering hay, crops and wood, and delivering {{them to the}} farmstead or market.|$|R

60|$|The <b>farm</b> <b>wagon</b> soon {{reached the}} Hall, and Dick ushered Seth Dickerson into Captain Putnam's office. The captain looked {{surprised}} at the unexpected visitor, but listened with deep concern to all the farmer and the Rover boys had to say.|$|E
60|$|The {{two were}} eating breakfast {{when the first}} {{prospective}} buyer rode up in a <b>farm</b> <b>wagon.</b> It was a lumberman from over the ridge behind Basco, who was thinking of settling down to cabin life by himself. He made an offer of fifteen dollars for everything in sight, but Earl held out for forty dollars.|$|E
60|$|All {{strained}} their ears, and presently {{made out}} {{the sounds of}} a <b>farm</b> <b>wagon</b> moving slowly over the rocky roadway that was hidden by the trees. Then the turnout came into view, loaded with freshly-cut cord wood, and drawn by a pair of bony, white horses. On the seat of the wagon sat an aged colored man, talking volubly to his team.|$|E
6000|$|Early in {{the ride}} they passed {{one or two}} cutters and several <b>farm</b> <b>wagons.</b> Then they reached a turn in the road, and to their {{surprise}} saw ahead of them a sign resting on a large wooden horse: ...|$|R
60|$|They {{swept over}} Sherodburg five minutes later, dipping down {{so low that}} they could see every house and every store. They looked along the main street for the touring car, but only {{carriages}} and <b>farm</b> <b>wagons</b> were in view.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{guess this}} is Stockbridge," [...] was Dick's comment, a little later, as they came in sight of a straggling village. Several buggies and <b>farm</b> <b>wagons</b> were in sight and {{likewise}} a couple of cheap automobiles, but nothing {{that looked like a}} stage.|$|R
60|$|Dick did so, and {{his heart}} gave a leap of fear. Below them the stony road was narrow, and on one side was a rocky gully {{and on the other}} some thick bushes. In the roadway was a farmer with a large <b>farm</b> <b>wagon</b> filled with lime. Should they hit the turnout below {{somebody}} would surely be hurt and perhaps killed.|$|E
60|$|He {{also told}} us how {{his father and mother}} came west by way of the Erie Canal, and in a steamer on the Great Lakes, of how they landed in Milwaukee with Susan, their twelve-year-old daughter, sick with the smallpox; of how a farmer from Monticello carried them in his big <b>farm</b> <b>wagon</b> over the long road to their future home in Green county and it was with deep emotion that he {{described}} the bitter reception they encountered in the village.|$|E
6000|$|... "Bubble and squeak! Ah!" [...] And {{with those}} words the agent withdrew to where, in a <b>farm</b> <b>wagon</b> {{drawn up by}} the side of the road, three men were solemnly pulling at their pipes. He moved away from them a little, for, as he {{expressed}} it to his wife afterward: [...] "Look bad, you know, look bad--anybody seeing me! Those three little children--that's where it is! If our friends at the Hall had to do these jobs for themselves, there wouldn't be any to do!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Rope {{are often}} coiled {{and hung up}} in lofts for storage. They are also hung over stakes in <b>farm</b> <b>wagons</b> and on hooks in moving vans, fire {{apparatus}} and linesmen's repair trucks. For such active storage coils must be well made. The Ashley Book of Knots ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Pierre, all I have to say, is, be {{sure that}} Christopher puts the coach-hammer and nails, and plenty of cords and screws into the box. And you had better let him follow you {{in one of the}} <b>farm</b> <b>wagons,</b> with a spare axle and some boards." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{old man was}} obdurate, and he and {{the hired}} man forced the boys into the barn, where the farmer stood guard with the shotgun while the hired man hooked up a team of horses {{to one of the}} <b>farm</b> <b>wagons.</b> Then the lads were told to get into the turnout.|$|R
6000|$|In {{those days}} {{people did not}} [...] "call," [...] they went [...] "visitin'." [...] The women took their {{knitting}} and stayed all the afternoon and sometimes all night. No one owned a carriage. Each family journeyed in a heavy <b>farm</b> <b>wagon</b> with the father and mother riding high on the wooden spring seat while the children jounced {{up and down on}} the hay in the bottom of the box or clung desperately to the side-boards to keep from being jolted out. In such wise we started on our trip to the McClintocks'.|$|E
60|$|Early in {{the cool}} hush of a June morning in the seventies, a curious vehicle left Farmer Councill's door, loaded with a merry group of young people. It was a huge omnibus, {{constructed}} out of a heavy <b>farm</b> <b>wagon</b> and a hay rack, and was drawn by six horses. The driver was Councill's hired man, Bradley Talcott. Councill himself held between his vast knees the staff of a mighty flag in which they all took immense pride. The girls of the grange had made it for the day.|$|E
60|$|It only {{remains to}} be told how Stephen Brice, coming to the Brewster House after the debate, found Mr. Lincoln. On his knee, in {{transports}} of delight, was a small boy, and Mr. Lincoln was serenely playing on the child's Jew's-harp. Standing beside him was a proud father who had dragged his son across two counties in a <b>farm</b> <b>wagon,</b> and who was to return on the morrow to enter this event in the family Bible. In {{a corner of the}} room were several impatient gentlemen of influence who wished to talk about the Question.|$|E
50|$|He {{attended}} public schools, {{and later}} the University of Maine at Farmington. He was first employed in the lumber industry in St. Ignace, Michigan, later {{for a while in}} a Chicago lumberyard, and afterwards at St. Ignace again, where he resided until he came to Racine, Wisconsin in 1890 where he engaged in the manufacture of <b>farm</b> <b>wagons.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The term Conestoga wagon refers {{specifically}} {{to this type}} of vehicle; it is not a generic term for [...] "covered wagon". The wagons used in the westward expansion of the United States were, for the most part, ordinary <b>farm</b> <b>wagons</b> fitted with canvas covers. A true Conestoga wagon was too heavy for use on the prairies.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1940s B.J. Pasker ran a {{blacksmith}} shop in New Vienna, Iowa. In this shop his son, Jerry, produced <b>farm</b> <b>wagons</b> made from discarded automobile spindles and rims. During this period, Pasker {{also developed a}} hydraulically powered front loader which mounted to farm tractors. In 1944 Jerry Pasker outgrew the blacksmith shop and sought a larger facility for his operations.|$|R
60|$|There {{were two}} ways of going down the hill. One was in the {{direction}} of Haven Point, and the other wound around a second smaller hill and ended in the pasture lot of an old farmer. This farmer was an Irishman named Mike O'Toole, a pleasant enough individual, who had often given the boys rides on his <b>farm</b> <b>wagon,</b> and who was not averse to selling them fruit, and also milk, when they desired it. He was such a good-natured old man that very few of the cadets ever thought to molest his orchard.|$|E
60|$|It was a clear, sun-shiny {{morning when}} the boys started off. They had paid a last visit to the various points of {{interest}} about the place and bid good-by to Sarah, who shook hands warmly, and said farewell to the hired men, both of whom hated them to leave, for they had made matters pleasant as well as lively. Their three trunks were loaded in a <b>farm</b> <b>wagon,</b> and now Jack, one of the men-of-all-work, drove up with the two seated carriage to drive them over to Oak Run {{by way of the}} river bridge, half a mile up the stream.|$|E
60|$|All the {{day before}} Cynthia and Milly, and many another housewife, had been making {{wonderful}} things for the dinners they were to bring, and stowing them in the great basket ready for the early morning start. At six o'clock Jethro's three-seated <b>farm</b> <b>wagon</b> {{was in front of}} the store. Cousin Ephraim Prescott, in a blue suit and an army felt hat with a cord, got up behind, a little stiffly by reason of that Wilderness bullet; and there were also William Wetherell and Lem Hallowell, his honest face shining, and Sue, his wife, and young Sue and Jock and Lilian, all a-quiver with excitement in their Sunday best.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, Ertl offered {{a series of}} plastic model kits of heavy {{commercial}} trucks, over-the-road trailers, tractors, plows, and <b>farm</b> <b>wagons.</b> Although these kits never achieved the hoped-for popularity, they led to the acquisition of AMT. In 1983, AMT was purchased by Ertl from Lesney, and renamed AMT/Ertl. AMT/Ertl then had a 24-year relationship until AMT was sold in 2007.|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Guy Weadick saw match races at the 1922 Gleichen (Alberta) Stampede between <b>farm</b> <b>wagons</b> pulled by 4 horses. Or, growing up on cattle ranches, Weadick witnessed many impromptu races between ranch outfits {{at the end of a}} round-up where the wagons would race to the nearest town saloon and the last onesthere had to buy the first round of drinks.|$|R
5000|$|Covered wagon: {{the name}} given to canvas-topped <b>farm</b> <b>wagons</b> used by North American {{settlers}} to move both {{their families and}} household goods westward. Varieties of this wagon include the Conestoga wagon (larger wagons able to carry large amounts of goods and primarily used on flat trails, for example the Santa Fe Trail) and prairie schooner (smaller wagons more suited for mountainous regions, for example the Oregon and California Trails).|$|R
