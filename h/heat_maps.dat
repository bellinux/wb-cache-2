500|$|Windows Server 2012 {{includes}} {{a new version}} of Windows Task Manager together with the old version. In the new version the tabs are hidden by default, showing applications only. In the new Processes tab, the processes are displayed in varying shades of yellow, with darker shades representing heavier resource use. It lists application names and status, as well as CPU, memory, hard disk and network utilization. The process information found in the older versions are now moved to the new Details tab. The Performance tab shows [...] "CPU", [...] "Memory", [...] "Disk", [...] "Wi-Fi" [...] and [...] "Ethernet" [...] graphs. The CPU tab no longer displays individual graphs for every logical processor on the system by default, although that remains an option. Additionally, it can display data for each non-uniform memory access (NUMA) node. When displaying data for each logical processor for machines with more than 64 logical processors, the CPU tab now displays simple utilization percentages on heat-mapping tiles. The color used for these <b>heat</b> <b>maps</b> is blue, with darker shades again indicating heavier utilization. Hovering the cursor over any logical processor's data now shows the NUMA node of that processor and its ID, if applicable. Additionally, a new Startup tab has been added that lists startup applications, however this tab does not exist in Windows Server 2012. The new task manager recognizes when a Windows Store app has the [...] "Suspended" [...] status.|$|E

40|$|The {{dramatic}} changes occurring throughout the agriculture industry are creating {{new and different}} uncertainties that result from a turbulent business climate. The objective {{of this paper is}} to present a methodology to understand, assess and evaluate, and manage strategic uncertainty. The approach is to present a mental model that frames assessment of strategic uncertainty from a potential and exposure perspective. Scorecarding and <b>heat</b> <b>mapping</b> assessment tools operationalize the mental model. Participants in an executive agribusiness educational workshop applied this mental model and the assessment tools to one of three hypothetical seed companies. The participants then provided an evaluation of the usefulness and effectiveness of uncertainty scorecarding and <b>heat</b> <b>mapping.</b> Uncertainty, scorecarding, strategic uncertainty, <b>heat</b> <b>mapping,</b> potential, exposure, likelihood, Risk and Uncertainty,...|$|R
