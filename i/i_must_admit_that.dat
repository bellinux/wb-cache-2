500|$|The Toronto Stars William Burrill {{called it}} [...] "the best fantasy ... {{role-playing}} game in this (or any parallel) world." [...] He praised its automap and noted its increased graphical fidelity. However, {{he found that}} the control system took time to learn, and he stated, [...] "This is not a game you can master quickly or play in a night. It has its frustrations and its flaws, despite its brilliance of design". He summarized that [...] "those who are patient will be richly rewarded with a game like no other." [...] Computer Gaming Worlds Doug Sencat enjoyed the game's graphics and praised the plot, conversations and 3D world for giving a sense of [...] "being there". However, he noted that the game's movement controls were [...] "a pain" [...] and that navigating the environment was initially [...] "frustrating". Sencat was unfavorable toward the linearity of the plot and dialogue trees, and toward NPCs' inability to take actions independent of the player. He described the game as [...] "a long and grueling quest" [...] that often [...] "seems more frustrating than enjoyable". Although Semcat called it [...] "a relatively high-quality game", he finished, [...] "By the time I finally saw daylight again, emerging from the Labyrinth, <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> it wasn't exultation I felt, but sheer relief." [...] The magazine's Scorpia was more positive, calling the game [...] "a good follow-up to the previous entry".|$|E
2500|$|In 1989, Kane {{acknowledged}} Finger as [...] "a contributing force" [...] in the character's creation, and wrote, [...] "Now that my long-time {{friend and}} collaborator is gone, <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> Bill never received the fame and recognition he deserved. He was an unsung hero ... I often tell my wife, if I {{could go back}} fifteen years, before he died, I would like to say. 'I'll put {{your name on it}} now. You deserve it.'" [...] Comics historian Ron Goulart has referred to Batman as the [...] "creation of artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger".|$|E
2500|$|Les Fêtes Chinoises was Noverre's {{first great}} success. In a grudging journal entry the dramatist Charles Collé remarked in July 1754: [...] "This month, all Paris has flocked to a Chinese ballet, {{given at the}} Opéra Comique. I do not like ballets, and my aversion to dancing has greatly {{increased}} since all the theatres have become infected with ballets; but <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> this Chinese ballet is unusual and at least by its novelty and its picturesqueness it has earned {{a share of the}} applause it is given." [...] On 1July 1754, the Mercure de France observed that the ballet was mounted with extraordinary luxury [...] and in August reported that [...] "the multitude flocked to see it with unprecedented furore." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Mr. Orme," [...] she said, [...] "I will do all for {{you that}} a mother can do or ought to do; but <b>I</b> <b>must</b> not <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> {{you have a right}} to ask such a {{question}} as that. If I were to answer that now, you would feel yourself justified in asking it again when perhaps it might not be so easy to answer." ...|$|R
6000|$|Occasionally in our rambles we {{came across}} Inspector Baynes. His fat, red face wreathed itself in smiles and his small eyes glittered as he greeted my companion. He said little about the case, but from that little we {{gathered}} that he also was not dissatisfied at the course of events. <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>admit,</b> however, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was somewhat surprised when, some {{five days after the}} crime, I opened my morning paper to find in large letters: ...|$|R
2500|$|... wasn't like [...] "Dede" [...] – De Sabata: he, too, {{was a great}} conductor, but he was changeable. One day {{he would}} be fine and would conduct a certain way; {{the next day he}} would be full of aches and pains and would conduct a {{different}} way. He was always somewhat ill. He, too, would be transformed, once he picked up the baton... and <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> Tristan und Isolde made an even bigger impression when De Sabata conducted it than with Toscanini. Toscanini was perfection: upright, even. De Sabata, on the other hand, pushed and pulled the music. Afterwards, when Toscanini had left, De Sabata {{was the only one who}} could take his place. Despite his faults, he, too, was a great conductor and a musician of the highest order. Once, in Turandot, he heard a mistake made by the third trombone, and it was discovered to be a printer's error that not even Toscanini had caught.|$|E
2500|$|Criticism of Sămănătorist traditionalism and its {{presence}} in various contexts was also voiced in later years. In one such case, historian Mihai Sorin Rădulescu argued that such tendencies had {{made their way into}} Romanian museology: [...] "the Museum of the Romanian Peasant [...] and the Village Museum both show Romanians in accordance with Semănătorist tradition". In a 2007 article critical of Romania's educational policy, textbook author Dumitriţa Stoica described as an anachronism the presence of topics on Sămănătorism within the standard baccalaureate examination, noting that such subjects had already been stripped from the regular curriculum. In his 2008 book Iluziile literaturii române ("Illusions in Romanian Literature"), literary historian and theorist Eugen Negrici linked the perpetuation of neo-Sămănătorist guidelines with another nationalist current, Protochronism, discussing them as equally negative phenomena: [...] "Even though I feel no pleasure, <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> the ideological-literary movements of a Sămănătorist and Protochronist type appear to be durable, being strictly motivated by the ways in which Romanian society has evolved. They stand for both the protective impulse and the compensatory one [...] At the first sign of a major peril, we shall be hearing the magmatic rumble of myths rising up again from the deep".|$|E

6000|$|... "It is an {{interesting}} psychological problem," [...] Trowse answered, [...] "which we shall know more about shortly. <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>admit,</b> though, <b>that</b> your position is inexplicable to me. Fortune has given you a marvelous opportunity. I cannot conceive how you could have acted differently. I cannot understand your present hesitation. If you wish for any sort of cooperation on my part, {{tell me how you}} first met this young woman, and under what circumstances you persuaded her to become your patient." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't be silly," [...] Pamela protested. [...] "Why, he's German by birth, and {{although}} you English people are much too pig-headed {{to see any}} good in an enemy, <b>I</b> think you <b>must</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> the way they all hang together-- Germans, I mean, all over the world--is perfectly wonderful." ...|$|R

6000|$|When Dr. Tolbridge {{heard what}} had happened, he was sorely troubled. [...] "I {{must go to}} see her," [...] he said. [...] "I cannot allow her to remain in that state of mind. I think I can explain the affair and make her look at it more as we do, although, <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>admit,</b> now <b>that</b> <b>I</b> recall some things she {{recently}} said to me, {{that she may have}} some grave objections to Cicely's residence at Cobhurst. But I shall see her, and I think I can pacify her." ...|$|R
6000|$|You {{say that}} it is [...] "right" [...] to like Virgil, and yet you <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> you admire the Mantuan, as the Scotch editor joked, [...] "wi' deeficulty." [...] <b>I,</b> too, <b>must</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> my liking for much of Virgil's poetry is not enthusiastic, not like the admiration expressed, for example, by Mr. Frederic Myers, in whose [...] "Classical Essays" [...] you will find all that the advocates of the Latin singer can say for him. These heights I cannot reach, any more than I can equal that eloquence. Yet must Virgil always appear to us one of the most {{beautiful}} and moving figures in the whole of literature.|$|R

40|$|Exactly {{twenty years}} ago I bored this conference to desperation with an interminable disquisition on 2 ̆ 2 Smaller Teaching. 2 ̆ 2 While I hope that essay helped open the way to larger learning, <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>admit</b> now <b>that</b> {{it was not only}} too long, but that it fell short of an {{important}} truth about the honors classroom. In the intervening two decades, experience in the peer review panels of the National Endowment for the Humanities and the academic advisory committees of the College Board has helped me understand more deeply this central site of honors education-and, I dare say, liberal learning. I hope to suggest that dimension to you today, albeit very briefly...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hopkins {{has called}} me in seven times, and on each {{occasion}} his summons has been entirely justified," [...] said Holmes. [...] "I fancy {{that every one of}} his cases has found its way into your collection, and <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>admit,</b> Watson, <b>that</b> you have some power of selection, which atones for much which I deplore in your narratives. Your fatal habit of looking at everything {{from the point of view}} of a story instead of as a scientific exercise has ruined what might have been an instructive and even classical series of demonstrations. You slur over work of the utmost finesse and delicacy, in order to dwell upon sensational details which may excite, but cannot possibly instruct, the reader." ...|$|R

People who selfishly {{objected to}} Yoop's taking their cows and sheep for his food. <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>admit,</b> however, <b>that</b> Yoop {{had a bad}} temper, and had the habit of {{knocking}} over a few houses, now and then, when he was angry. So one day the little folks came in a great crowd and captured Mr. Yoop, and carried him away to a cage somewhere in the mountains. I don't know where it is, and I don't care, for my husband treated me badly at times, forgetting the respect a giant owes to a giantess. Often he kicked me on my shins, when I wouldn't wait on him. So I'm glad he is gone." ...|$|R

"Madam," [...] {{he said in}} {{excellent}} accent, [...] "the boys desire me to reply for them, and <b>I</b> <b>must</b> first <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> {{the thought of a}} supper appeals to them and me. Perhaps it would be admissible to say that, having had the honour of dismissal from a good many farms between Dakota and Prince Albert, I know a little about prairie rations and cookery, and I would like to testify that, in respect to both, Prospect stands alone. One might also venture to observe, without making any invidious reflections upon Mrs. Nesbit and the somewhat unvarying Jake, that the menu has become even more attractive lately, {{for which there is no}} doubt a sufficient reason." ...|$|R
5000|$|According to {{his later}} accounts, Finck {{was confronted with}} {{politics}} {{for the very first}} time: [...] "If only I had known that all these people were just Mitläufer. Some even camouflaged as Gauleiter. (...) So quite a few people claim I had disapproved of the Nazis. I would {{like to point out that}} these are defamations. You never know. (...) <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>admit</b> though <b>that</b> the Nazis disapproved of me." [...] The way Finck presented his jokes made it very difficult for authorities to nail him down. His exploits made him a legend in his lifetime, to such an extent that when he introduced himself to British and American journalists after the war, he was met with disbelief as they believed that the [...] "Werner Finck" [...] who joked against the Nazis was a fairy-tale figure.|$|R
60|$|And yet <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> {{there was}} a modicum of truth in what she said. I had been feeling pretty austere about the man all day, and I'll tell you why.|$|E

60|$|Still <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> Van Sweller's {{conduct in}} the park that morning was almost without flaw. The courage, the dash, the modesty, the skill, and {{fidelity}} that he displayed atoned for everything.|$|E
60|$|A eminent Oxford theologian once {{remarked that}} his only {{objection}} to modern progress {{was that it}} progressed forward instead of backward--a view that so fascinated a certain artistic undergraduate that he promptly wrote an essay upon some unnoticed analogies between the development of ideas and {{the movements of the}} common sea-crab. I feel sure the Speaker will not be suspected even by its most enthusiastic friends of holding this dangerous heresy of retrogression. But <b>I</b> <b>must</b> candidly <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{have come to the conclusion}} that the most caustic criticism of modern life I have met with for some time is that contained in the writings of the learned Chuang Tzu, recently translated into the vulgar tongue by Mr. Herbert Giles, Her Majesty's Consul at Tamsui.|$|R
6000|$|She {{answered}} me {{in a tone}} {{which was}} grave, but gentle. [...] "Do you not know you are asking {{me to do something}} which is entirely impossible? In the first place, my official position precludes me from taking part in affairs of this nature; and although I am willing to <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> I see no reason why you might not be a suitable partner for Sylvia, <b>I</b> <b>must</b> also <b>admit</b> <b>that,</b> on the other hand, I {{have no reason to believe}} that Sylvia would be inclined to accept you as such a partner. I have no doubt that she has made herself very agreeable to you,--that is her nature; I know that she used to make herself very agreeable to people. You must remember that, even should Sylvia leave us, your chances may be no better than they are now." ...|$|R
50|$|When {{this was}} {{read to him}} at the Nuremberg trials he said:One has to take the diary as a whole. You can not go through 43 volumes and pick out single {{sentences}} and separate them from their context. I would like to say here that I do not want to argue or quibble about individual phrases. It was a wild and stormy period filled with terrible passions, and when a whole country is on fire and a life and death struggle is going on, such words may easily be used... Some of the words are terrible. <b>I</b> myself <b>must</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was shocked at many of the words which I had used.An assassination attempt by Polish Secret State on 29/30 January 1944 (the night preceding the 11th anniversary of Hitler's appointment as Chancellor of Germany) in Szarów near Kraków failed.
