This resulted in three game concepts: Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, [...] and [...] While developing the story for Call of Duty 4, Infinity Ward chose to avoid referencing current, real-life wars, and keep the series' common theme of two opposing forces of similar strength. To enhance the realistic feel of the game, the development team attended a live-fire exercise at Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center Twentynine Palms, a training facility in the California desert. This helped the developers to simulate the effects of being near an Abrams tank when it fires. The team also talked with U.S. Marines who were recently in combat to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>feel</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> background, emotions, and attitude of Marines in combat.

500|$|To <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>feel</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> era, X-Files {{composer}} Mark Snow {{listened to}} the big band music of Gene Krupa, Glenn Miller, Tommy Dorsey, and Harry James.

Snow later joked that his composition was [...] "the third generation of the same inspiration." [...] Carter had significant musical input when it came to scene transitions, saying, [...] "I got a chance to use some of my favorite '40s music here, too, or '30s and '40s music to transition scenes." [...] The song that is heard {{near the end of the}} ballroom fight and in the scene featuring Scully and the Lone Gunmen searching for the Queen Anne is a piece of stock music called [...] "Hot Liquorice", composed by Dick Walters.

500|$|Lead {{designer}} Fumito Ueda came up {{with the}} concept for Ico in 1997, envisioning a [...] "boy meets girl" [...] story where the two main characters would hold hands during their adventure, forming a bond between them without communication. Ueda's original inspiration for Ico was a TV commercial he saw, of a woman holding the hand of a child while walking through the woods, and the manga series Galaxy Express 999 (1977–1981), where a woman is a guardian for the young hero as they adventure through the galaxy, which he thought about adapting into a new idea for video games. He also cited his work as an animator on Kenji Eno's Sega Saturn game Enemy Zero, which influenced the animation work, cinematic cutscenes, lighting effects, sound design, and mature appeal. Ueda was also inspired by the video game Another World (Outer World in Japan), which used cinematic cutscenes, lacked any head-up display elements as to play like a movie, and also featured an emotional connection between two characters despite the use of minimal dialog. He also cited Sega Mega Drive games, Virtua Fighter, Lemmings, Flashback and the original Prince of Persia games as influences, specifically regarding animation and gameplay style. With the help of an assistant, Ueda created an animation in Lightwave to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>feel</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> final game and to better convey his vision. In the three-minute demonstration reel, Yorda had the horns instead of Ico, and flying robotic creatures were seen firing weapons to destroy the castle. [...] Ueda stated that having this movie that represented his vision helped to keep the team on track for the long development process, and he reused this technique for the development of Shadow of the Colossus, the team's next effort.|$|E
