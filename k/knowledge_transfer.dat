It is hypothesized that the determinants of conventional <b>knowledge</b> <b>transfers</b> from MNC parents to subsidiaries and reverse <b>knowledge</b> <b>transfers</b> from subsidiaries to MNC parents are based on different transfer logics. A sample of 105 acquired subsidiaries revealed that organizational characteristics are important in conventional knowledge flows from headquarters, so that subsidiaries acquired with competence-creating objectives receive significantly larger inflows. Knowledge characteristics are important in reverse flows to headquarters so that subsidiaries whose knowledge is more relevant are able to transmit significantly larger outflows.

40|$|Using Northern Ireland {{as a case}} study, {{this paper}} focuses {{on the issue of}} <b>knowledge</b> <b>transfers</b> from the plants of {{multinational}} enterprises to their local suppliers. This is important both because the potential for <b>knowledge</b> <b>transfers</b> to indigenous firms has often been used as a justification for public support of inward investment and because of the centrality of “knowledge ” and “learning ” in recent debates about economic development. Using quantitative data obtained from structured interviews with senior managers at 33 of the largest multinational plants in Northern Ireland, the paper addresses three main issues. First, for a range of “best practice ” manufacturing techniques it examines the po ential for <b>knowledge</b> <b>transfers</b> by measuring “knowledge gaps ” between each multinational plant and (a) best practice within its parent group, and (b) its best local suppliers. Secondly, the paper examines the incidence of various activities through which <b>knowledge</b> might be <b>transferred</b> from multinational plants to their suppliers.

25|$|In 1952, the {{government}} nationalised the forests which were earlier with the zamindars. India also nationalised {{most of the}} forest wood industry and non-wood forest products industry. Over the years, many rules and regulations were introduced by India. In 1980, the Conservation Act was passed, which stipulated that the central permission is required to practice sustainable agro-forestry in a forest area. Violations or lack of permits was made a criminal offense. These nationalisation wave and laws intended to limit deforestation, conserve biodiversity, and save wildlife. However, the intent of these regulations was not matched by reality that followed. Neither investment aimed at sustainable forestry nor <b>knowledge</b> <b>transfer</b> followed once India had nationalised and heavily regulated forestry. Deforestation increased, biodiversity diminished and wildlife dwindled. India's rural population and impoverished families continued to ignore the laws passed in Delhi, and use the forests near them for sustenance.|$|E
25|$|The {{middle ground}} between the craft {{production}} of skilled workers and full automation is occupied by systems of extensive mechanization and partial automation operated by semiskilled and unskilled workers. Such systems depend on algorithmic workflows and <b>knowledge</b> <b>transfer,</b> which require substantial engineering to succeed. Although Taylor's intention for scientific management was simply to optimize work methods, the process engineering that he pioneered also tends to build the skill into the equipment and processes, removing most need for skill in the workers. Such engineering has governed most industrial engineering since then. It is also the essence of successful offshoring. The common theme in all these cases is that businesses engineer {{their way out of}} their need for large concentrations of skilled workers, and the high-wage environments that sustain them. This creates competitive advantage on the local level of individual firms, although the pressure it exerts systemically on employment and employability is an externality.|$|E
25|$|Scientific {{management}} {{may have}} exacerbated grievances among workers about oppressive or greedy management. It certainly strengthened developments that put workers at a disadvantage: {{the erosion of}} employment in developed economies via both offshoring and automation. Both were {{made possible by the}} deskilling of jobs, which was made possible by the <b>knowledge</b> <b>transfer</b> that scientific management achieved. Knowledge was transferred both to cheaper workers and from workers into tools. Jobs that once would have required craft work first transformed to semiskilled work, then unskilled. At this point the labor had been commoditized, and thus the competition between workers (and worker populations) moved closer to pure than it had been, depressing wages and job security. Jobs could be offshored (giving one human's tasks to others—which could be good for the new worker population but was bad for the old) or they could be rendered nonexistent through automation (giving a human's tasks to machines). Either way, the net result from the perspective of developed-economy workers was that jobs started to pay less, then disappear. The power of labor unions in the mid-twentieth century only led to a push on the part of management to accelerate the process of automation, hastening the onset of the later stages just described.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to develop a web-based expert system for early detection towards characters of investment of people who will invest immediately on their productive ages. The development of this application is encompassing four primary activities in developing an expert system, namely: knowledge acquisition, knowledge representation, knowledge inferencing, and <b>knowledge</b> <b>transfering.</b> <b>Knowledge</b> acquisition is a process of acquisition or <b>transfering</b> <b>knowledge</b> or expertise of an expert through a knowledge engineer. Knowledge representation is a process of <b>transfering</b> <b>knowledge</b> into a computer based system. Knowledge inferencing is a reasoning process performed by an expert system to draw a conclusion or a final result. The reasoning process applies a forward-chaining method. <b>Knowledge</b> <b>transfering</b> is a process of <b>transfering</b> <b>knowledge</b> from an expert system to a user (non-expert one) through a user interface of the expert system. This expert system has been tested to about 300 users. This simple system generally runs quite well although there are still some weakness to refine in the further research. </p...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the question as}} to what sort of role storytelling plays in the formal mentoring process. Firstly, the individual’s personal competence which is divided into knowledge and socially based competencies, and how this competence alters {{in the course of the}} individual’s working life, is illustrated. Secondly, due to the fact that the mentor’s competence is transferred from his or her worldview to the mentee’s worldview, the concept of worldview is described. Then the discussion deals with the main content of the paper – namely mentoring and storytelling, and the characteristics of <b>knowledge</b> <b>transferred</b> through these activities. Due to the need to attain a better understanding of the <b>knowledge</b> <b>transferred</b> through mentoring and storytelling, some results of an empirical study conducted on a formal mentoring process in a large Finnish technological manufacturing company (i. e. comments of interviewees) are picked up in brief and included in the paper. The paper ends with the conclusion according to which <b>knowledge</b> <b>transferred</b> through the formal mentoring process differs from the <b>knowledge</b> <b>transferred</b> through an ordinary storytelling practice, and therefore the storytelling plays only a weak role in the mentoring.

In particular, we examine the roles played by both face-to-face <b>knowledge</b> <b>transfers</b> and also human capital transfers between different types of agents and institutions in the promotion of innovation. In order to examine these issues we employ a unique innovation dataset which provides information about a firm's innovation performance along with information regarding the geographical and sectoral origins of a firm's recent labour acquisitions, disaggregated according to different types of agents and institutions. This allows us to develop proxies for inter-firm face-to-face knowledge exchanges and also human capital <b>knowledge</b> <b>transfers.</b> The analysis of these data allows us to identify the different roles which the geography of knowledge exchanges and labour markets between agents and institutions play in regional innovation processes.
