25|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> a {{reflection}} of the total anxiety and emotion of that period. There's {{a hell of a lot}} of spontaneity about that album. We went in with virtually nothing and everything just came pouring out.|$|E
500|$|Yeah, we {{were kind}} of {{disappointed}} [...] because it sold really well. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> the timing because One Direction at the same time shot straight to number one with 'Little Things'. It's always hard to compete with the 1D lads. And we're chuffed to bits for them; we've always been supportive of them.|$|E
500|$|Actress Natalie Dormer, who {{was cast}} to play Queen Margaery Tyrell in the show's second season, also made her final {{appearance}} {{as a main}} cast member for the series. In contrast to Chapman, Dormer found out about her character's impending death approximately {{six months before the}} rest of the cast, saying [...] "I requested while making season 5 that showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss release me from working on the show earlier than usual so I could do another project, and they ended up phoning me — and that was The Call. But I got it six months ahead of normal. They were like, 'We weren't going to tell you this for a few more months, but we're not going to release you now, so you can't do that job {{you really want to do}} and we're really sorry about that. But on the bright side, we are going to release you proper in the not-so-distant future.' It was good news, bad news — no you can't do this, but don't worry, you're going to have lots more opportunities very soon." [...] Dormer also stated about her departure, [...] "It's the longest time I've ever spent playing a character. I'll always have a little yellow rose after my heart, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> the right length of time, to be honest. It's time for the Westeros story to move on and it's a perfect time for her to exit." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Remember Paul?" [...] {{was written}} by series creator and {{executive}} producer Marc Cherry and directed by David Grossman. It marked the debut of Vanessa Williams as Renee Perry, an old college rival of Lynette Scavo. The addition of Williams to the cast was announced after {{the close of the}} series' sixth season, as well as the finale of the ABC series Ugly Betty, in which Williams starred as Wilhelmina Slater. The character, who was originally named Renee Filmore-Jones, was conceived as a trouble-making vixen, similar to the Edie Britt character (Nicollette Sheridan), who appeared on the series until the fifth season. Following the casting announcement, Williams admitted to having been a fan of the series during its first year, but stopped watching because of the racially insensitive second season mystery storyline. It focused on Betty Applewhite (Alfre Woodard), the series' first black main character. Williams explained to Entertainment Weekly, [...] " [...] had her son in chains in the basement. It was like, 'Really? Do we have to go there with our first Black character?' I honestly fell off the show after that. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> so implausible and just an image that Black folks don't want to see their child chained and shackled in the basement." [...] Cast member Felicity Huffman commented on Williams' addition to the cast, saying [...] "She's such a great dash of vinegar to Wisteria Lane! It's going brilliantlyshe's a wonderful woman, she's really smart, she's really strong, a real team player. She's a great addition." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 11 June 2009 ex-communities {{secretary}} Hazel Blears, {{who chose}} to resign from the government just before the English county council and European elections, said that she regretted the timing of her decision. She also stated that her decision to wear a brooch with the words 'rocking the boat' {{on the same day}} as the resignation was a [...] "stupid thing to do". Speaking to the Manchester Evening News she said of the brooch [...] "It was a brooch my husband had given me. I'd had four weeks of intense media pressure, the like of which I have never known, not just on me but on my husband, my dad, my family. At that point I'd had enough. It was a stupid thing to do but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> trying to put a brave face on—not going out cowed on the basis of expenses claims that genuinely are not true." ...|$|E

[...] This flustered Gavinia; but Grizel, who enjoyed her own jokes too heartily to have more than a polite interest in those of other people, said to her: [...] "How can you be angry! <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> sweet of him." ...|$|E

"Oh, sir, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> tiredness, and may be, {{a little}} {{something}} hot at that supper last night; and, besides, seeing so many queer things in pantermimes might put notions in a child's head. But {{when she came home}} last night, a little late, Lizer was very strange. She vowed and swore she had seen a large Bird, far bigger than any common bird, skim over the street. Then when I had put her to bed in the attic, down she flies, screaming she saw the Bird on the roof. I had hard work to get her to sleep. To-day I made her lay a-bed and wear her theatre pantermime bearskin, that fits her like another skin--and she'll be too big for it next year--just to keep her warm in that cold garret. That's all about it, sir. She'll be well enough in a day or two, will Lizer." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{think the}} house will do splendidly. The Lindens is the name, and {{it is on the}} Maybury Road, not {{more than a quarter of}} a mile from the station. If your mother and you could come down on Tuesday or Wednesday, I should get a half-day off, and you would be able to inspect it. Such a nice little lawn in front, and garden behind. A conservatory, if you please, dining-room and drawing-room. You can never {{assemble}} more than four or five guests. On your at-home days, we shall put up little placards as they do outside the theatres, 'Drawing-room full,' 'Dining-room full,' 'Room in the Conservatory.' There are two good bedrooms, one large maid's room, and a lumber- room. One cook and one housemaid could run it beautifully. Rent 50 pounds on a three years' lease--with taxes, about 62 pounds. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> built for us. Rupton Hale says that we must be careful not to brush against the walls, and that it would be safer to go outside to sneeze--but that is only his fun.|$|E
