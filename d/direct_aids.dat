40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the {{implementation}} of <b>direct</b> <b>aids</b> modulation, as provided for by Regulation 1259 / 99. After a critical review of the most relevant questions arisen around the effectiveness and the viability of modulation, the paper presents results about its possible application in Italy. In {{the first part of}} the paper a special attention is given to the actual distribution of <b>direct</b> <b>aids</b> in Italy, to the number of farms involved and the amount of revenues realised. In the second part four different hypotheses of modulation are tested. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of modulation revenues under the four different hypotheses are compared with the financial resources allotted in Italy to the regional Rural Development Plans (RDPs). While results of modulation are, generally speaking, quite poor in terms of re-distribution of <b>direct</b> <b>aids,</b> there is a more relevant effect in terms of additional resources destined to the RDPs. However, resources are to be destined to measures that receive the highest share of resources within the RDPs. On the contrary, other measures, more genuinely addressing Rural Development and territorial issues within the RDPs, receive a much smaller amount of resources and cannot be funded through modulation. In other words, if the main objective of the modulation is that of shifting resources from the first to the second pillar of the CAP, this is only partially realised, given the mandatory destination of financial resources on measures that are substantially financed and that do not fully address the economic diversification and the development of rural areas.

40|$|The 2003 Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform radically {{changes the}} way the European Union (EU) {{supports}} its agricultural sector by decoupling direct payments. Production is no longer required to get the payment attached to Single Farm Payment (SFP) entitlements. However, the new scheme maintains a specific link between payments and hectares; in addition, SFP entitlements can be exchanged among farmers. These features question the way SFP entitlements should be regarded, hence modelled, i. e., as lump-sum transfers, area payments or… something else. We develop a microeconomic analytical framework which shows that the answer crucially depends on {{the total number of}} entitlements which are initially made available relative to the number of hectares, more specifically the number of cultivated hectares in a zero support regime, the number of cultivated hectares in a policy support regime trough per-hectare <b>direct</b> <b>aids,</b> and the number of cultivated or idled hectares in a policy regime where support is granted through <b>direct</b> <b>aids</b> per hectare and production is not required.

In addition the olive growers, as other farmers, have to comply with stricter obligations to manage their farms in sustainable ways (cross compliance). In this scenario the sector needs new competitive strategies to address these new challenges. In this paper we assess if innovative olive-growing models, like the high trees density orchards, are able to reduce production costs without worsening environmental sustainability. Indeed the intensive olive systems produce higher yields {{within a few years}} of planting and allow a higher level of mechanization (pruning and harvesting) but they could generate higher environmental impacts. In this study we perform an economic and environmental comparison between two olive growing systems: the "high density" and the “super high density”.

40|$|Alessandra Kirsch, PhD {{student in}} Dijon, {{presented}} {{the results of}} her research comparing the distribution of CAP payments and farm environmental performance. It aims to assess {{the extent to which}} the distribution of <b>direct</b> <b>aids</b> of the CAP rewards the supply for environmental public goods by farming. French FADN data are used to analyse the distribution of <b>direct</b> <b>aids</b> received by three farm types: OTEX 15 (cereals and oilseeds), OTEX 45 (milk farms) and OTEX 46 (cattle farms), which represent 44 % of French farms and 50 % of the direct payments in the FADN sample. Eleven indicators of farm pressure on the environment available in the FADN are used to rank farms according to their overall environmental impact. They include the share of grassland, the share of protein crops, or the share of irrigated land in total agricultural area, an index of crop diversity, and information on input costs. The ranking is made in several steps: 1) ranking by indicator: points are attributed to each farm according to its rank in its type of farm decile; 2) for each farm, the points attributed for each indicator are summed; 3) farms are finally ranked in quartiles calculated according to the sum of points, by type of farm. Farms ranked as more environmentally friendly have, on average, larger agricultural area and smaller arable land area, but with higher diversity of crops, and incomes equivalent to those in other farms. For cattle breeding, the best ranked group has fewer cows, and uses more grass and less silage. The income of more environmentally friendly farms is on average less variable over time. During the period 2000 - 13, these farms received lower payments than less environmentally friendly farm categories, but the distribution of payments is changing as the CAP reforms are implemented. Direct payments per hectare are always higher in the farm group with the lowest marks. The difference is not very important for crop farms, but it is large in dairy farming and cattle farming, where the most environmentally friendly farming group receives much lower first pillar payments. They receive higher second pillar payments, but not enough to compensate the difference in first pillar payments. Initial results on UK and German dairy farms point to larger changes in payment distribution over time, mainly due to the regional approach to allocating direct payment from Pillar I among farms...|$|E

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of decreasing support for agricultural incomes by market measures, the per-hectare premiums (ha-premiums) clearly have the task and the effect to stabilise farm incomes. Before <b>direct</b> <b>aids</b> were introduced, there had been periods with decreasing prices for agricultural land and for rented agricultural area in real terms, according to the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) data base (specialised crop farms in 53 regions for 11 years) and EUROSTAT data (B, DK, D-W, F, NL in the period 1975 to 1999). Regression analysis is used to show the relationship between hapremiums, land rental prices and other relevant economic variables, such as land prices, rental share, livestock density, the price index of agricultural products and farm income. The analysis shows increasing price effects due {{to the introduction of}} ha-premiums on prices for agricultural land and on rental prices. Landlords received a share of about 6 % to 18 % of the ha-premiums (depending on the data source). An in-sample simulation, 1999 -continuation scenario, and scenarios of further CAP (Common Agricultural Policy) reforms are used for the assessment of the ex-post and ex-ante developments. The ongoing reforms of the CAP (Agenda 2000, Mid-term Review) and EU enlargement certainly have implications for the land markets. land markets, rental price, per-hectare premiums, Agricultural and Food Policy, Land Economics/Use,...|$|E
40|$|The main {{topic of}} this diploma thesis is the recent {{reform of the}} Common Agricultural Policy of the European Union (CAP). The second topic is the {{agricultural}} negotiations {{in the framework of}} the World Trade Organization (WTO). Last but not least, the question of the influence of the negotiations in the WTO on the CAP reform is discussed. The first chapter concerns with the details of the process of the CAP reform and it also shows the main differences between the previous forms of the CAP and reformed one (e. g. the reforms to the intervention mechanism). Secondly, this chapter includes the description and the analysis of the fundamental key elements of the new CAP - the single farm payment (SFP), cross compliance, modulation and rural development. It is expected that the SFP brings visible and necessary changes in the financing of the CAP. The SFP decouples the payments and production. In the future farmers make decisions firmly according to the situation on the market. There is no more any incentive for the production. Full decoupling was an ideal presented by the European Commission. Member states, however, decide to maintain a proportion of <b>direct</b> <b>aids</b> to farmers in their existing form.

40|$|This paper overviews {{mitigation}} {{perspectives in}} ruminant farming systems and discusses main obstacles and levers for their adoption. Using dietary lipids or nitrates as feed additives {{are the two}} most efficient ways for reducing enteric methane emission without affecting animal performances. However fat use in diets is often expensive and the use of nitrates may be not acceptable by farmers and/or consumers. In the future, genetic selection for low-emitter animals and progress in manipulating rumen microbial ecosystems are two promising ways of progress. Decreasing dietary protein of dairy cows will reduce N excretion and thus nitrous oxide emissions. Improving animal reproduction performances and health through more robust animals and decreasing age at first calving will reduce emissions, possibly resulting in a lower level of production. Increasing carbon sequestration through improvements in pasture management and using legumes in grassland in replacement of mineral fertilizers are considered as win-win strategies; they are not applied currently at large scale because many farmers are not convinced they are sound. Optimizing manure management is an interesting mitigation option, but requires investments. At least, using sexed semen or dual-purpose breeds rather than specialized breeds to better valorize male calves for meat may be solutions for the future, but these strategies will significantly affect dairy and meat chain organization. Larger emission reductions will be achieved by using several options simultaneously. In that context, the last section uses the key reading of the public economics theory to define the principles of a public policy aiming at efficiently reducing GHG emissions from ruminants: this policy should combine transitory <b>direct</b> <b>aids</b> for facilitating adaptation and the internalization of carbon price in production costs of farmers; it should also target research, agricultural advice as well as farmers’ education and organization...|$|E
