5000|$|Monday So <b>I</b> <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone.</b> And I screamed out loud. I felt {{so alone}} ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{read about}} a {{training}} program a major studio had for grooming people for 'stardom.' Being naive about the system, I {{got on the phone}} and called the man in charge and asked if he would interview me, and he told me to come around to the studio," [...] Rhodes told TV Guide in 1968. [...] "I said, 'By the way, I think I should tell you that I am a Negro.' He said, 'Don't waste your time - we don't take Negroes in this program.' <b>I</b> <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone.</b> Almost tore the cradle off the thing." ...|$|E
60|$|I had finished. I had {{no further}} {{observations}} to make. <b>I</b> <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> receiver, and crawled into bed.|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't faint or fall or scream. I didn't feel glad or surprised. I didn't feel anything. I felt numb, just as I {{did when}} I heard Walter had enlisted. <b>I</b> <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> {{receiver}} and turned round. Mother {{was standing in}} her doorway. She wore her old rose kimono, {{and her hair was}} hanging down her back in a long thick braid, and her eyes were shining. She looked just like a young girl.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's strange. I {{was lying}} down here asleep {{about five minutes}} ago, with the door shut {{to keep out the}} weather, when the {{brushing}} of a woman's clothes over the heath-bushes just outside woke me up (for I don't sleep heavy), {{and at the same time}} I heard a sobbing or crying from the same woman. I opened my door and held out my lantern, and just as far as the light would reach I saw a woman: she turned her head when the light sheened on her, and then hurried on downhill. <b>I</b> <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> lantern, and was curious enough to pull on my things and dog her a few steps, but I could see nothing of her any more. That was where I had been when you came up; and when I saw you I thought you were the same one." ...|$|R
60|$|My {{arrival at}} the village created some excitement; but I was plainly no longer {{regarded}} as a friend {{or one of the}} family. Runi was absent, and I looked forward to his return with no little apprehension; he would doubtless decide my fate. Kua-ko was also away. The others sat or stood about the great room, staring at me in silence. I took no notice, but merely asked for food, then for my hammock, which <b>I</b> <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> in <b>the</b> old place, and lying down I fell into a doze. Runi made his appearance at dusk. I rose and greeted him, but he spoke no word and, until he went to his hammock, sat in sullen silence, ignoring my presence.|$|R
5000|$|Johnston {{was born}} in Visalia, California. His {{greatest}} musical influences during his youth included those of Little Richard, Bo Diddley, Elvis Presley, James Brown, and other rhythm and blues artists featured on the radio in the 1950s. After brief school stints with the saxophone and clarinet, {{at the age of}} twelve Johnston took up guitar. [...] "I started out on the clarinet at seven, and I played that for eight years. I also played the saxophone for three years, drums {{for a year and a}} half, and took <b>up</b> <b>the</b> guitar when I was in the seventh grade. That was pretty much of a rebellion/image trip. But I felt at home on the guitar. I loved the saxophone and played tenor and baritone. But unfortunately, when <b>I</b> <b>hung</b> <b>the</b> clarinet <b>up,</b> <b>I</b> <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> all <b>the</b> reed instruments and just started playing guitar, and I never touched them again. I taught myself guitar and a little piano at home. I played piano on the first album The Doobie Brothers, and a little harmonica on a few others." [...] In his early career he played in a variety of bands, including a Mexican wedding band that played half soul and half Latin music. His interest in rhythm and blues led to his singing in a soul group from a neighboring town and, eventually, his own blues band.|$|R
6000|$|My dear Severn--I am {{very sorry}} that on Tuesday I have an {{appointment}} in the City of an undeferable nature; and Brown {{on the same day}} has some business at Guildhall. I {{have not been able to}} figure your manner of executing the Cave of despair,[111] therefore it will be at any rate a novelty and surprise to me--I trust on the right side. I shall call upon you some morning shortly, early enough to catch you before you can get out--when we will proceed to the Academy. I think you must be suited with a good painting light in your Bay window. I wish you to return the Compliment by going with me to see a Poem <b>I</b> have <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> for <b>the</b> Prize in the Lecture Room of the Surry Institution. I have many Rivals, the most threatening are An Ode to Lord Castlereagh, and a new series of Hymns for the New, new Jerusalem Chapel. (You had best put me into your Cave of despair.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The armour <b>I</b> had <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> in <b>the</b> armoury, {{where it}} has been {{carefully}} kept clean. I guessed what it was by the weight of the case when it came, and thought it best to open it, as it might have got spoilt by rust. It is a timely gift, Sir Gervaise, for the siege has played havoc with the suit Genoa gave you; it is sorely battered, dinted, and broken, and, although you can doubtless get it repaired, if I were you I would keep it in its present state as a memorial--and there could be no prouder one--of the part you bore in the siege. I have seen Caretto this morning. He sails for Genoa tomorrow, where he will, I hope, soon recover his strength, for the wounds he received at St. Nicholas have healed but slowly. He said"--and a momentary smile crossed the grand master's face--"that he thought a change might benefit you also, for he was sure that the air here had scarce recovered from the taint of blood. Therefore, here is a paper granting you three months' leave. His commandery is a pleasant one, and well situated on the slopes of the hills; and the fresh air will, doubtless, speedily set you up. I should like nothing better than a stay there myself, but there is much to do to repair the damages caused by the siege, and to place the city in a state of defence should the Turks again lay siege to it; and methinks Mahomet will not sit down quietly under the heavy reverse his troops have met with." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Americans {{were far}} more popular in Newfoundland than Canadians, so <b>I</b> was never <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> about <b>the</b> United States. There's {{always seemed to be}} a hang <b>up</b> with <b>the</b> Toronto {{cultural}} literati about the US. But that's never been the feeling in Newfoundland and Atlantic Canada." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But say, there ain't {{any danger}} in a lock, is there?" [...] respond the querists. [...] "Danger!" [...] exclaims a deaf old lady, poking up her head; [...] "what's the matter? There hain't nothin' burst, has there?" [...] "No, no, no!" [...] exclaim the {{provoked}} and despairing opposition party, who {{find that there}} is no such thing as going to sleep till they have made the old lady below and the young ladies above understand exactly the philosophy of a lock. After a while the conversation again subsides; again all is still; you hear only the trampling of horses and the rippling of the rope in the water, and sleep again is stealing over you. You doze, you dream, and all of a sudden you are started by a cry, [...] "Chambermaid! wake <b>up</b> <b>the</b> lady that wants to be set ashore." [...] Up jumps chambermaid, and <b>up</b> jump <b>the</b> lady and two children, and forthwith form a committee of inquiry as to ways and means. [...] "Where's my bonnet?" [...] says the lady, half awake, and fumbling among the various articles of that name. [...] "I thought <b>I</b> <b>hung</b> it <b>up</b> behind <b>the</b> door." [...] "Can't you find it?" [...] says poor chambermaid, yawning and rubbing her eyes. [...] "O, yes, here it is," [...] says the lady; and then the cloak, the shawl, the gloves, the shoes, receive each a separate discussion. At last all seems ready, and they begin to move off, when, lo! Peter's cap is missing. [...] "Now, where can it be?" [...] soliloquizes the lady. [...] "I put it right here by the table leg; maybe it got into some of the berths." [...] At this suggestion, the chambermaid takes the candle, and goes round deliberately to every berth, poking the light directly in the face of every sleeper. [...] "Here it is," [...] she exclaims, pulling at something black under one pillow. [...] "No, indeed, those are my shoes," [...] says the vexed sleeper. [...] "Maybe it's here," [...] she resumes, darting upon something dark in another berth. [...] "No, that's my bag," [...] responds the occupant. The chambermaid then proceeds to turn over all the children on the floor, to see if it is not under them. In the course of which process they are most agreeably waked up and enlivened; and when every body is broad awake, and most uncharitably wishing the cap, and Peter too, at the bottom of the canal, the good lady exclaims, [...] "Well, if this isn't lucky; here I had it safe in my basket all the time!" [...] And she departs amid the--what shall I say?--execrations?--of the whole company, ladies though they be.|$|R
60|$|Quest <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> {{receiver}} and rang off. Then he turned towards his two assistants.|$|R
60|$|MR. McGREGOR <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> little {{jacket and}} the shoes for a scare-crow to frighten the blackbirds.|$|R
60|$|She <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> {{receiver}} thoughtfully, {{paused a}} moment, {{and went back}} to the drawing-room. Brent looked up.|$|R
50|$|In {{the year}} 2014, and <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> boots, the Nacional de Muria√© and in 2015, assumes another function, {{now out of}} the four lines being {{technical}} assistant of Valeriodoce.|$|R
60|$|He <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> receiver, and, turning, met {{the pale}} {{eye of the}} long boy, who had propped himself <b>up</b> in <b>the</b> doorway.|$|R
6000|$|<b>The</b> butler blushed, <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> fur coat, murmured {{something}} that sounded like: [...] "Nothing, sir, I'm sure, sir," [...] and stealthily withdrew.|$|R
60|$|Then {{we went to}} work. I put <b>up</b> <b>the</b> stove, {{which was}} not much trouble, as {{there was a place}} all ready in the deck for the stove-pipe to be run through. Euphemia was {{somewhat}} surprised at the absence of a chimney, but I assured her that boats were very seldom built with chimneys. My dear little wife bustled about and arranged the pots and kettles on nails that I drove into the kitchen walls. Then she made the bed in <b>the</b> bed-room and <b>I</b> <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> a looking-glass and a few little pictures that we had brought in our trunks.|$|R
60|$|She <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> {{receiver}} quickly, to {{cut short}} a fresh outburst of protest. And {{as she turned}} away a voice spoke behind her.|$|R
50|$|Muhammad made a brief {{comeback}} in 1988, but <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> gloves for good {{later that year}} after losing via TKO to journeyman Arthel Lawhorne.|$|R
60|$|He <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> instrument, {{and going}} back to the dining-room, drained his glass. Then he turned to Mrs. Cartwright, who had remarked his grim look.|$|R
60|$|Jacques, as he <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> hammock, {{explained}} to the sailors who crowded round {{the character of the}} passenger who had so unexpectedly come on board.|$|R
6000|$|Mary <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> garden hat on {{its proper}} peg. 'No,' {{she said after}} consideration. 'I don't imagine I ever should. But I've no imagination, I'm afraid.' ...|$|R
6000|$|He <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> {{receiver}} and slowly turned toward {{his wife and}} daughter. [...] "This sure is our day of trouble," [...] he said, with dejected countenance.|$|R
60|$|He <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> receiver. Benyon {{sprang to}} his feet. He stood, shaking, a pitiable sight. Mr Birdsey had risen with him. They {{stood looking at}} Waterall.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{you take}} good care of yourself, and I'll start right away," [...] {{returned}} the youngest Rover, and after a few words more <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> receiver.|$|R
60|$|All ran to {{the spot}} where the meat had been <b>hung</b> <b>up.</b> <b>The</b> tree was {{scratched}} up and there were curious marks in the damp soil under it.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> {{young man}} <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> receiver. Lenora was filling {{the room with}} her shrieks. He took her by the {{shoulder}} and pushed her back into a chair.|$|R
6000|$|A bear, having spread him {{a notable}} feast, [...] Invited a famishing fox to the place. [...] "I've killed me," [...] quoth he, [...] "an edible beast [...] As ever {{distended}} the girdle of priest [...] With 'spread of religion,' or 'inward grace.' [...] To my den I conveyed her, [...] I bled her and flayed her, [...] <b>I</b> <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> her skin to dry; [...] Then laid her naked, {{to keep her}} cool, [...] On a slab of ice from the frozen pool; [...] And there we will eat her--you and I." ...|$|R
60|$|He <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> receiver, and bounded {{across the}} room to where his coat hung over the back of a chair. The edge of the steamer-trunk caught his shin.|$|R
6000|$|... "Something {{will have}} to be done," [...] said Bince, [...] "at once. I'll be over to see your father in the morning. Good-by, dear," [...] and he <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> receiver.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Pett {{had taken}} the {{receiver}} from the telephone and was talking to some one. The buzzing of a feminine voice came to Jimmy's ears. Mr. Pett <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> receiver.|$|R
6000|$|... "Take {{this message}} down, Mr. Barnes," [...] went on Dick, and {{dictated}} what {{he wished to}} say. [...] "I'll settle next time I see you," [...] he added, and <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> receiver.|$|R
50|$|Well, {{first of}} all, <b>I</b> <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> on him. <b>I</b> {{thought it was}} a crank call. His {{secretary}} was calling and I was like, 'Yeah, right.' Click. And then he called back personally and then talked to me, and I was just freaked out. I mean, who wouldn't be freaked out? Here's this eccentric American God living in the countryside of England, and he's calling me up in Austin, Texas, and saying he wants me to do the music for his film and he wants me to be in his film and he's famous and all that. I didn't even believe it.|$|R
6000|$|Katharine <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> receiver. She {{walked the}} length of the room in such acute {{disappointment}} that she did not at first perceive Mary's absence. Then she called in a harsh and peremptory tone: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell him I'll be {{down and}} that I'll treat him right," [...] replied Flannagan, {{and after the}} chief had {{transmitted}} <b>the</b> message, and <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> receiver: [...] "Where is this here Shawnee, anyhow?" ...|$|R
