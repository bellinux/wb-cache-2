5|$|The {{majority}} of clan or lineage groups {{were not very}} influential in local society. However, prominent <b>kinship</b> groups could enjoy {{a great deal of}} ad hoc influence, especially if a member served as a government official. Wealthy scholars or officials often shared the same <b>kinship</b> group with poor commoners. Since clan members were expected to defend fellow members (even to the point of murder), government authorities constantly struggled to suppress powerful <b>kinship</b> groups. Local lineage groups formed the backbone of rebel forces in the popular uprising against Wang Mang in the early 1st century CE. When central government authority broke down in the late Eastern Han, less-developed areas of the country remained relatively stable due to entrenched <b>kinship</b> groups, while in heavily developed areas (where <b>kinship</b> groups had been effectively broken down by the state) there were many more peasants willing to turn to rebel movements for protection and survival.|$|E

5|$|Family is {{the primary}} social and {{political}} grouping in Torajan society. Each village is one extended family, the seat {{of which is the}} tongkonan, a traditional Torajan house. Each tongkonan has a name, which becomes the name of the village. The familial dons maintain village unity. Marriage between distant cousins (fourth cousins and beyond) is a common practice that strengthens <b>kinship.</b> Toraja society prohibits marriage between close cousins (up to and including the third cousin)â€”except for nobles, to prevent the dispersal of property. <b>Kinship</b> is actively reciprocal, meaning that the extended family helps each other farm, share buffalo rituals, and pay off debts.|$|E

5|$|Unlike in England, where <b>kinship</b> was predominately cognatic (derived {{through both}} males and females), in Scotland <b>kinship</b> was agnatic, with {{members of a group}} sharing a (sometimes fictional) common ancestor. Women {{retained}} their original surname at marriage, symbolising that they did not join their husband's kin, and marriages were intended to create friendship between kin groups, rather than a new bond of <b>kinship.</b> Women could marry from the age of 12 (while for boys it was from 14) and, while many girls from the social elite married in their teens, most in the Lowlands only married after a period of life-cycle service, in their twenties, by which they accrued resources, status and skills {{that would allow them to}} establish a household. Normally marriage followed handfasting, a period of betrothal, which in the Highlands may have effectively been a period of trial marriage, in which sexual activity may have been accepted as legitimate. Highland women, based on the higher birth rate of the Highlands, might have married earlier than their Lowland counterparts.|$|E

40|$|The study {{explored}} the genetic susceptibility and prevalence of epilepsy in twins. The data on epilepsy were retrieved {{from the health}} records of 199 pairs of twins. Proband concordance rate in monozygotic (MZ) twins was four times more than that in dizygotic (DZ) twins (0. 67 vs. 0. 17). Three of 15 (20 &#x 0025;) affected twin <b>kinships</b> had epileptic first-degree relatives. These findings indicated significant underlying genetic susceptibility to epilepsy with the Holzinger&#x 2032;s heritability estimate being 0. 45. The prevalence of epilepsy was similar in MZ (45. 45), DZ (45. 11) twins, and their non-twin siblings (47. 60). In the general population from various nationalities, the mean prevalence rate of epilepsy varied from 5 to 17 per 1000. The appreciably higher prevalence rate in twin <b>kinships</b> {{could be attributed to}} peculiar development factors associated with the twinning process or the intrauterine environment of mothers having tendencies to bear twins. Of the genetic markers, PTC locus seemed {{to be associated with the}} susceptibility to epilepsy. The allele frequency of non-tasters (t) seemed greater in epileptic twin <b>kinships</b> (0. 71) than that in the general population (0. 53). The frequency of non-tasters was similar in MZ and DZ twins and singletons: 27. 3 &#x 0025;, 26 &#x 0025;, and 27. 7 &#x 0025; respectively. The PTC data on the general population was based on a sample of 278 individuals...|$|R

5|$|Before the Reformation, the {{extensive}} prohibited degrees of <b>kinship,</b> {{up to the}} fourth degree through consanguinity, meant that most noble marriages necessitated a papal dispensation. This could later be used as grounds for annulment if the marriage proved politically or personally inconvenient, {{although there was no}} divorce as such. After the mid-sixteenth century the prohibited degrees were reduced to those in Leviticus 13: 4â€“13, which limited them to relationships in the second degree of <b>kinship.</b> Separation from bed and board continued to be allowed in exceptional circumstances, usually adultery, and under the Reformed Kirk divorce was allowed on grounds of adultery or desertion. Scotland {{was one of the first}} countries to allow desertion as legal grounds for divorce and, unlike England, where divorce necessitated and act of parliament, divorce cases were initiated relatively far down the social scale.|$|E
5|$|By {{succeeding}} her husband, Ranavalona {{became the}} first female sovereign of the Kingdom of Imerina {{since its founding in}} 1540. Her rise to power occurred in a cultural milieu that favored men over women in the political sphere. In the traditional culture of Imerina, rulers were specially endowed with the power to innovate in circumvention of established norms and customs. Sovereigns often mobilized innovation through the creation of new forms of <b>kinship,</b> the traditional basis of the political order. Women, however, were associated with the household, a rigid <b>kinship</b> unit in opposition to the innovating role and power of the sovereign, and so were not viewed as suited to rule. Although female rulers had once been common among the Vazimba, described in oral histories as the original inhabitants of Madagascar, this tradition ended in the central highlands with the reign of Andriamanelo (1540â€“1575), founder of the Kingdom of Imerina and successor to his Vazimba mother, Queen Rafohy (1530â€“1540).|$|E

5|$|In Europe, the {{practice}} was most prevalent from the medieval era until the outbreak of World War I, but evidence of intermarriage between royal dynasties {{in other parts of}} the world can be found as far back as the Late Bronze Age. Monarchs were often in pursuit of national and international aggrandisement on behalf of themselves and their dynasties, thus bonds of <b>kinship</b> tended to promote or restrain aggression. Marriage between dynasties could serve to initiate, reinforce or guarantee peace between nations. Alternatively, <b>kinship</b> by marriage could secure an alliance between two dynasties which sought to reduce the sense of threat from or to initiate aggression against the realm of a third dynasty. It could also enhance the prospect of territorial acquisition for a dynasty by procuring legal claim to a foreign throne, or portions of its realm (e.g., colonies), through inheritance from an heiress whenever a monarch failed to leave an undisputed male heir.|$|E
40|$|Up to now, {{prioritization}} {{of animals}} for conservation has been mainly based on pedigree information; however, genomic information may improve prioritization. In this study, we used two Holstein populations {{to investigate the}} consequences for genetic diversity when animals are prioritized with optimal contributions based on pedigree or genomic data and whether consequences are different at the chromosomal level. Selection with genomic <b>kinships</b> resulted in a higher conserved diversity, but differences were small. Largest differences were found when few animals were prioritized and when pedigree errors were present. We found more differences at the chromosomal level, where selection based on genomic <b>kinships</b> resulted in a higher conserved diversity for most chromosomes, but for some chromosomes, pedigree-based selection resulted in a higher conserved diversity. To optimize conservation strategies, genomic information can help to improve the selection of animals for conservation in those situations where pedigree information is unreliable or absent or when we want to conserve diversity at specific genome regions...|$|R
