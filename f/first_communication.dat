It was launched on 13 May 2007, aboard a Chinese Long March 3B carrier rocket, from the Xichang Satellite Launch Centre in China. The spacecraft was operated by NigComSat and the Nigerian Space Agency, NASRDA.

Among the most noteworthy, however, the following can be cited: the Piaggio P.XIbis R.C.40D engine that equipped the Caproni Ca.161bis which, in 1938, established an altitude world record for piston-engine aircraft which stands to the present day; a fragment of the Blériot XI that Jorge Chávez successfully completed the first air crossing of the Alps in 1910; the wing rib of a Wright brothers biplane; Guglielmo Marconi's radio which he used for the <b>first</b> <b>communication</b> by air balloons and airships, and the fuel tank of a Supermarine Spitfire which crashed in Italy during World War II.|$|E

He was more cheerful after visiting McKinley, giving a statement to the press, and went to Washington, as Roosevelt and other officials also dispersed.

2500|$|The {{concept of}} [...] "eternal recurrence", {{the idea that}} with {{infinite}} time and {{a finite number of}} events, events will recur again and again infinitely, is central to the writings of Friedrich Nietzsche.

[...] According to Heidegger, it is the burden imposed by the question of eternal recurrence—whether or not such a thing could possibly be true—that is so significant in modern thought: [...] "The way Nietzsche here patterns the <b>first</b> <b>communication</b> of the thought of the 'greatest burden' [...] makes it clear that this 'thought of thoughts' {{is at the same time}} 'the most burdensome thought.'

Morrison was very doubtful about his <b>first</b> <b>communication</b> to The Times {{and showed it to}} a friend who, in a letter to The Times about the time of Morrison's death, spoke of it as a perfect diagnosis of the then troubled condition of China, masterly in its phrasing, luminous in its broad conception of the general situation".

Sessions released a statement that day, saying [...] "I never met with any Russian officials to discuss issues of the campaign. I have no idea what this allegation is about. It is false."

2500|$|Pakistan started {{pursuing}} {{space technology}} on 16 September 1961, when Pakistan's space agency, SUPARCO was created, with renowned physicist Abdus Salam {{as its first}} administrator. In its early days, SUPARCO researched {{on the development of}} solid-fuel sounding rockets with assistance provided by the United States. On 7 June 1962, with the launch of the Rehbar-I (lit. Teller of the Way) rocket, Pakistan became the Tenth country in Asia and the tenth in the world to successfully conduct the launch of an unmanned spacecraft. This rocket had been developed by a team of scientists and engineers of the Pakistan Air Force, led by Air Commodore (Brigadier-General) Władysław Józef Marian Turowicz in collaboration with NASA and was launched from Sonmiani, Pakistan's first space launch facility. SUPARCO's unmanned space program continued till 1972, with nearly 20 successful launches. SUPARCO's unmanned space program suffered setbacks during the 1970s and the 1980s, delaying the development and launch of Pakistan's first satellite, Badr-I till 1990 when it was launched from China. SUPARCO launched Pakistan's second satellite, Badr-B [...] in 2001 from Baikonur Cosmodrome using a Ukrainian Zenit-2 rocket, followed by Paksat-1R in 2011 which was contracted and actually built and launched by China, was Pakistan's <b>first</b> <b>communication</b> satellite.

2500|$|... "Eternal return" [...] (also {{known as}} [...] "eternal recurrence") is a {{hypothetical}} concept that posits {{that the universe}} has been recurring, {{and will continue to}} recur, in a self-similar form for an infinite number of times across infinite time or space. It is a purely physical concept, involving no supernatural reincarnation, but the return of beings in the same bodies. Nietzsche first invokes the idea of eternal return in a parable in Section 341 of The Gay Science, and also in the chapter [...] "Of the Vision and the Riddle" [...] in Thus Spoke Zarathustra, among other places. Nietzsche contemplates the idea as potentially [...] "horrifying and paralyzing," [...] and says that its burden is the [...] "heaviest weight" [...] imaginable ("das schwerste Gewicht"). The wish for the eternal return of all events would mark the ultimate affirmation of life, a reaction to Schopenhauer's praise of denying the will‐to‐live. To comprehend eternal recurrence in his thought, and to not merely come to peace with it but to embrace it, requires amor fati, [...] "love of fate". As Heidegger points out in his lectures on Nietzsche, Nietzsche's first mention of eternal recurrence presents this concept as a hypothetical question rather than postulating it as a fact. [...] According to Heidegger, it is the burden imposed by the question of eternal recurrence—whether or not such a thing could possibly be true—that is so significant in modern thought: [...] "The way Nietzsche here patterns the <b>first</b> <b>communication</b> of the thought of the 'greatest burden' [...] makes it clear that this 'thought of thoughts' {{is at the same time}} 'the most burdensome thought.'" ...|$|E

60|$|I {{comprise}} {{and conclude}} {{the sum of}} my conviction in this one sentence. Revealed religion (and I know of no religion not revealed) is in its highest contemplation the unity, that is, the identity or co-inherence, of subjective and objective.

But as all power manifests itself in the harmony of correspondent opposites, each supposing and supporting the other; so has religion its objective, or historic and ecclesiastical pole and its subjective, or spiritual and individual pole. In the miracles and miraculous parts of religion--both in the <b>first</b> <b>communication</b> of Divine truths, and in the promulgation of the truths thus communicated--we have the union of the two, that is, the subjective and supernatural displayed objectively--outwardly and phenomenally-- AS subjective and supernatural.|$|E
