5|$|The Danish {{name is not}} unexpected; the {{language}} of the Ormulum, an East Midlands dialect, is stringently of the Danelaw (Bennett and Smithers 1982, pp.174–75). It includes numerous Old Norse phrases (particularly <b>doublets,</b> where an English and Old Norse term are co-joined), but there are very few Old French influences on Orm's language (Bennett 1986, p.33). Another—likely previous—East Midlands work, the Peterborough Chronicle, shows a great deal of French influence. The linguistic contrast between it and the work of Orm demonstrates both the sluggishness of the Norman influence in the formerly Danish areas of England and the assimilation of Old Norse features into early Middle English (Bennett 1986, pp.259–63).|$|E

25|$|Because {{strontium}} titanate {{and glass}} are too soft to survive {{use as a}} ring stone, they {{have been used in}} the construction of composite or doublet diamond simulants.

In glass <b>doublets,</b> the top portion is made of almandine garnet; it is usually a very thin slice which does not modify the stone's overall body color.

25|$|When a proton is {{coupled to}} two {{different}} protons, then the coupling constants {{are likely to}} be different, and instead of a triplet, a doublet of <b>doublets</b> will be seen. Similarly, if a proton is coupled to two other protons of one type, and a third of another type with a different, smaller coupling constant, then a triplet of <b>doublets</b> is seen. In the example below, the triplet coupling constant is larger than the doublet one. By convention the pattern created by the largest coupling constant is indicated first and the splitting patterns of smaller constants are named in turn. In the case below it would be erroneous to refer to the quartet of triplets as a triplet of quartets. The analysis of such multiplets (which can be much more complicated than the ones shown here) provides important clues to the structure of the molecule being studied.|$|E
25|$|The {{predominantly}} blue-green iridescent {{shell of}} abalone (or paua; genus Haliotis) is one last possible imitation. Abalone shell is inexpensive and plentiful {{owing to the}} commercial mariculture of these gastropods for their meat. The shell's structure is distinctive: sinuous bands of blue, green, and rose iridescence are delineated by dark brown lines of conchiolin, a proteinaceous material that holds the shell together. The luster of abalone shell is silky rather than the near vitreous luster of polished ammolite, and {{the colors of the}} two materials do not closely approximate. However, some abalone shell has been dyed and given a transparent cap of synthetic quartz, forming a doublet in the same fashion as ammolite. These <b>doublets</b> are perhaps the most deceptive, and have also been used to imitate opal. Under magnification most abalone <b>doublets</b> will show dye concentrated along certain areas and air bubbles trapped at the shell-quartz interface.|$|E
