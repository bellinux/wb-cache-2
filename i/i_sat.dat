5|$|Jermaine, Manuel and <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> {{down and}} Jermaine {{programmed}} the drums. I {{told him the}} feel I wanted and Manuel {{put his hands on}} the keyboards and I started singing the melody. We went back and forth with the bridge and the B-section. I had the outline of the lyrics and started singing 'Always be my baby' {{off the top of my}} head.|$|E
5|$|We {{destroyed}} the aircraft and all munitions, everything. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> in my fighter and fired the guns {{into the woods}} where all the fuel had been dropped, and then jumped out. We destroyed twenty-five perfectly good fighters. They {{would be nice to}} have in museums now.|$|E
5|$|It {{happened}} {{on my last}} day in Hanoi. I was exhausted and an emotional wreck after the 2-week visit... The translator {{told me that the}} soldiers wanted to sing me a song. He translated as they sung. It was a song about the day 'Uncle Ho' declared their country's independence in Hanoi's Ba Dinh Square. I heard these words: 'All men are created equal; they are given certain rights; among these are life, Liberty and Happiness.' These are the words Ho pronounced at the historic ceremony. I began to cry and clap. 'These young men should not be our enemy. They celebrate the same words Americans do.' The soldiers asked me to sing for them in return... I memorized a song called 'Day Ma Di', written by anti-war South Vietnamese students. I knew I was slaughtering it, but everyone seemed delighted that I was making the attempt. I finished. Everyone was laughing and clapping, including me... Here is my best, honest recollection of what happened: someone (I don't remember who) led me towards the gun, and <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down, still laughing, still applauding. It all {{had nothing to do with}} where I was sitting. I hardly even thought about where I was sitting. The cameras flashed... It is possible that it was a set up, that the Vietnamese had it all planned. I will never know. But if they did I can't blame them. The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen... a two-minute lapse of sanity that will haunt me forever... But the photo exists, delivering its message regardless of what I was doing or feeling. I carry this heavy in my heart. I have apologized numerous times for any pain I may have caused servicemen and their families because of this photograph. It was never my intention to cause harm.|$|E
40|$|A new assay for the {{determination}} of lactosylceramide- 2, 3 -sialyltransferase (<b>SAT</b> <b>I,</b> EC 2. 4. 99. 9) and monosialoganglioside sialyltransferase (SAT IV, EC 2. 4. 99. 2) is described. The assay utilised the commercially available fluorophore labelled sphingolipids, boron dipyrromethene difluoride (BODIPY) lactosylceramide (LacCer), and BODIPY-monosialotetrahexosyl-ganglioside (GM 1) as the acceptor substrates, for <b>SAT</b> <b>I</b> and <b>SAT</b> IV, respectively. HPLC coupled with fluorescence detection was used to analyse product formation. The analysis was performed in a quick and automated fashion. The assay showed good linearity for both BODIPY sphingolipids with a quantitative detection limit of 0. 05 pmol. The high sensitivity enabled the detection of <b>SAT</b> <b>I</b> and <b>SAT</b> IV activities as low as 0. 001 mU, at least 200 fold {{lower than that of}} most radiometric assays. This new assay was applied to the screening of <b>SAT</b> <b>I</b> and <b>SAT</b> IV activities in ovine and bovine organs (liver, heart, kidney, and spleen). The results provided evidence that young animals, such as calves, start to produce ganglioside sialyltransferases as early as 7 days after parturition and that levels change during maturation. Among the organs tested from a bovine source, spleen had the highest specific ganglioside sialyltransferase activity. Due to the organ size, the greatest total ganglioside sialyltransferase activities (<b>SAT</b> <b>I</b> and <b>SAT</b> IV) were detected in the liver of both bovine and ovine origin...|$|R

25|$|It was at Rome, on the 15th of October, 1764, as <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> musing {{amidst the}} ruins of the Capitol, while the bare-footed friars were singing vespers in the temple of Jupiter, that the idea of writing the decline and fall of the city first started to my mind.|$|E

25|$|Elizabeth Smart (December 27, 1913– March 4, 1986) was a Canadian {{poet and}} novelist.

Soon after, she began focusing upon script writing and one of her first screenplays was a feature film adaptation of Elizabeth Smart's poem By Grand Central Station <b>I</b> <b>Sat</b> Down and Wept. Despite interest from various producers, the film was never made. However, the quality of the script opened doors for Lamson.|$|E
25|$|One {{day during}} our lunch {{hour in the}} last week of filming, the craft service man handed out slices of {{watermelon}} to each of us. Richard, the whole camera crew, and <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> together in a big sound studio eating a number of watermelon slices, talking and joking. As a gag, some members of the crew used a piece of watermelon as a Frisbee, and tossed it back and forth to each other. One piece of watermelon landed at Richard's feet. He got up and went home. Filming stopped. The next day, Richard announced that he knew very well what the significance of watermelon was. He said that he was quitting show business and would not return to this film. The day after that, Richard walked in, all smiles. I wasn't privy to all the negotiations that went on between Columbia and Richard's lawyers, but the camera operator who had thrown that errant piece of watermelon had been fired that day. I assume now that Richard was using drugs during Stir Crazy.|$|E
5000|$|In February 2001, Atkinson {{announced}} he was recommending elimination of the [...] College Board's <b>SAT</b> <b>I</b> college entrance examination as a requirement for admission to the University of California. Students, he argued, should be tested on what they had actually achieved academically, {{not on the basis}} of “ill-defined notions of aptitude.” Atkinson’s challenge began a national debate on the relative merits of aptitude versus achievement in testing and ultimately led to a major revision of the <b>SAT</b> <b>I.</b> The new <b>SAT</b> <b>I,</b> introduced in 2005, incorporated higher-level mathematics and a written essay to reflect the quantitative and writing skills students need for success in college-level work.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Two key {{measures}} {{of high school}} performance in Texas public schools are performance on the exit-level Texas Assessment of Academic Skills (TAAS) and performance on the <b>SAT</b> <b>I</b> and ACT. Between 1994 and 2002, TAAS scores increased substantially, whereas <b>SAT</b> <b>I</b> and ACT scores remained essentially stable. This report reviews differences between the TAAS and the <b>SAT</b> <b>I</b> and ACT examinations that contributed to differences in performance trends, namely (1) purpose and type of test; (2) examinee population; and (3) academic proficiency level assessed. Because of these differences, the assessments are valuable, but distinct, measures of high school performance. The gains in exit-level TAAS scores indicate that an increasing percentage of students were mastering the academic skills required to obtain {{a high school diploma}} in Texas. The essentially stable <b>SAT</b> <b>I</b> and ACT performance indicates that high school students in Texas maintained a stable level of college readiness, relative to the mean performance of the national norm groups for the <b>SAT</b> <b>I</b> and ACT...|$|R

500|$|Hardly {{knowing what}} I was doing... <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down {{and started to}} work out an agonized craving for the sun and a furious revolt against that terrible cheerless, heartless food by writing down {{descriptions}} of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cooking.
