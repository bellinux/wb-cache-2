5|$|American {{economist}} and <b>former</b> <b>Chairman</b> of the Federal Reserve Paul Volcker {{has argued that}} the lack of global consensus on key issues threatens efforts to reform the global financial system.

Volcker has expressed an array of potential coordinated measures: increased policy surveillance by the IMF and commitment from nations to adopt agreed-upon best practices, mandatory consultation from multilateral bodies leading to more direct policy recommendations, stricter controls on national qualification for emergency financing facilities (such as those offered by the IMF or by central banks), and improved incentive structures with financial penalties.|$|E
