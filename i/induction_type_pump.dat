40|$|The pumping of plasmas by sawtooth-waveform {{magnetic}} induction variations is studied theoretically and {{by means of}} computer simulations. A sawtooth is a cycle waveform that {{is characterized by a}} slow increase in the {{magnetic induction}} followed by a rapid drop in the <b>induction.</b> Two <b>types</b> of sawtooth <b>pumping</b> are analyzed, and the types classified {{as to whether or not}} the first adiabatic invariants of the plasma particles are conserved during the rapid drops in the magnetic induction. When the invariants are conserved, the sawtooth waveforms are found to be less efficient than square waves for pumping plasmas. When the adiabatic invariations are not conserved, the pumping efficiency is found to be a slight improvement over square waves. Both <b>types</b> of <b>pumping</b> are applied to a hypothetical tokamak plasma and it is concluded that neither <b>type</b> of sawtooth <b>pumping</b> is practical for heating magnetically confined fusion plasmas...|$|R
40|$|Rock {{grouting}} {{is performed}} {{to decrease the}} hydraulic conductivity around underground structures, such as tunnels and caverns. Cement grouts are often used and pumped into joint and fractures of the rock formation. Piston <b>type</b> <b>pumps</b> are mostly used for high pressure rock grouting. A pulsation effect is inevitable when using this <b>type</b> of <b>pump</b> due to {{the movement of the}} piston. The effect of this pulsation on rock grouting is yet to be known but believed to be benefi-cial for the penetration of the grout. Current flow meters used in the field are not accu-rate enough to determine the fluctuation of the flow rate when it is less than 1 l/min. In addition, currently available flow meters measure the average of the flow over a cer-tain period of time, hence the true fluctuation of the flow rate due to the pulsation of the piston remains unknown. In this paper, a new methodology, the so called ‘Ultrasound Velocity Profiling – Pressure Difference’ (UVP+PD) method has been introduced to show the pulsation effect when using a piston <b>type</b> <b>pump.</b> The feasibility of this method was successfully investigated for the direct in-line determination of the rheological properties of micro cement based grouts under field conditions (Rahman & Håkansson, 2011). Subse-quently, it was also found that this method can be very efficient to measure the fluctu-ation of the flow rate for different <b>types</b> of <b>pumps.</b> From a grouting point of view the UVP+PD method can be used to synchronize the pressure and flow of a piston <b>type</b> <b>pump</b> by measuring the pulsation effect. Conse-quently it {{can be used as a}} tool for the efficiency and quality control of different <b>types</b> of <b>pumps.</b> QC 20121221 </p...|$|R
