40|$|The {{intake of}} {{artificial}} sweeteners by young Dutch children {{has been estimated}} and checked against the acceptable daily intake (ADI). An ADI is the quantity of a food additive, expressed in milligrams per kilogram body weight, that can be ingested daily over a whole life span without causing additional health risks. We studied most sweeteners in use, including acesulfame K (E 950), aspartame (E 951), cyclamate (E 952), saccharin (<b>E</b> <b>954)</b> and sucralose (<b>E</b> 955). In the Netherlands almost all children aged between two to six are exposed to artificial sweeteners. The assessment shows that for the sweeteners tested the ADIs were not exceeded. In {{the light of the}} increasing trend to add sweeteners to foods and drinks, {{it is important that the}} intake of artificial sweeteners is regularly monitored. Children are often simultaneously exposed to a number of different sweeteners, and interaction cannot then be ruled out. Safeguards provided by individual ADIs are then not necessarily valid when combinations of sweeteners are involved. Further study is required into the effects of combinations of artificial sweeteners...|$|R

40|$|A {{hypothesis}} is generated that despite high reported rates, suicide among elderly Japanese females is substantially underestimated due to misclassification of drowning suicides (ICD- 9 <b>E</b> <b>954)</b> as unintensional drownings (ICD- 9 E 910). Data are adapted from 1979 - 1981 age-, sex- and cause-specific mortality tabulations for Japan, the United States, Australia, France, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Between ages 55 and 74 years, unintensional drowning rates {{for males and}} females in Japan begin to diverge sharply from those of comparison countries. By ages 75 and older, the rate for Japanese females is 13. 5 per 100, 000, which exceeds comparison rates by 7 - to 15 -fold. Although drowning suicide rates in this population are also high, its ratio of drowning suicides to unintensional drownings declines precipitously beyond ages 35 - 44. Excess drowning suicide underestimation among Japanese females is suggested by the absence of a similar change among the males and evidence of both a lack of drowning witnesses and sex differentials in life expectancy, living arrangements and suicide methods. A preliminary test of the drowning suicide {{hypothesis is}} proposed which incorporates psychological autopsies. suicide drowning injury elderly...|$|R
40|$|The food {{industry}} {{is looking at}} possibilities to reduce, amongst others, the amount of sugar in food. Sugar can be replaced by sweeteners. The intake of artificial, non nutritive sweeteners of young Dutch children was estimated and compared to the health limit (ADI). An ADI (Acceptable Daily Intake) {{is the amount of}} a food additive, expressed as milligrams per kilogram of body weight, which can be ingested daily throughout life without causing additional health risks. The most commonly used sweeteners were examined, namely acesulfame-K (E 950), aspartame (E 951), cyclamate (E 952), saccharin (<b>E</b> <b>954)</b> and sucralose (<b>E</b> 955). In the Netherlands, almost all 2 - 6 year old children were exposed to these artificial sweeteners. The assessment showed that the ADIs for these sweeteners were not exceeded. Given the rising trend in adding sweeteners to foods and drinks, it is important to continue monitoring the intake of sweeteners periodically. Children are often simultaneously exposed to multiple sweeteners. In such cases interactions cannot be excluded and thus, a combined exposure to amounts of sweeteners below the individual ADIs may not be assumed to be safe in all cases. Further research is needed into the effects of mixtures of artificial sweeteners...|$|R

40|$|We {{measured}} the train draft at actual {{passing of the}} type <b>E</b> <b>954</b> Shinkansen high-speed test train on the platform of a station with no passing tracks to investigate the effect of train draft. Based {{on the results of}} those measurements, we checked if the wind speed was within the permissible limit from the perspective of safety and examined the need to reduce train draft intensity by means such as increasing the height of platform safety fences. Furthermore, we carried out measurements at stations and tests using models to establish a quantitative evaluation method for the pressure variation in a fully covered shed when a high-speed train enters. Then we proposed an evaluation formula based on that method. Train Draft Generating Mechanism 2 There are two types of mechanism for train draft. One is wind by pressure variation caused around the moving car body as a train runs due to air viscosity (Fig. 1). The other is wind by compression waves generated when the front part of a train passes. The former is generally observed in many sections, including open sections; the latter is observed in tunnels and at fully covered shed. Train draft caused at one passing of a train can be broken down into the three aspects shown in Fig. 2. 1) · Source flow: Flow put off from the front part of a train in the front and side directions · Boundary layer flow: Flow along the car body side due to friction · Wake: Flow in the area of lower pressure at the rear part of a trai...|$|R

It is not possible to specify, which one from used technologies of producing non-alcoholic beers have got a proven positive effect on the sensorial quality of beer, from identified data. Sample D (Samson) reached maximum values of complex perception of aroma, fullness, briskness and character of bitterness in sensorial evaluation of chosen criterions. The highest value of complex perception of taste was recorded at sample J (Radegast Birell). On the other hand, sample F (Budweiser Budvar) reached the lowest values of fullness, briskness and komplex perception of taste. The lowest values of komplex perception of aroma was noted in sample G (Dudák) and sample C (Bernard) had got the lowest values in complex perception of character of bitterness. Samples B (Platan) and D (Samson) contained additional sweetener <b>E</b> <b>954</b> (Saccharin). Saccharin is weaker than standard sugar but it leaves a bitter taste behind after ingestion.

40|$|Imagens de tomografia computadorizada (TC) permitem a visualização, sem distorções ou sobreposições, do complexo maxilo-facial, principalmente do osso {{alveolar}}. Estudos demonstraram boa reprodutibilidade e precisão da mensuração da altura da borda alveolar, todavia a influência da espessura óssea ainda é pouco descrita. Através da comparação com a mensuração direta, o objetivo deste estudo foi avaliar a precisão, reprodutibilidade e a influência da espessura óssea, na mensuração da altura da borda alveolar em imagens volumétricas e imagens bidimensionais multiplanares em TC de feixe cônico (TCFC) e em TC espiral (TCE). Utilizando 10 mandíbulas secas de humanos, 57 dentes anteriores foram tomografados em equipamentos iCAT (Imaging Science International, Hatfield, PA, EUA) e Brilliance 64 canais (Philips Eletronics, Eindhoven, Holanda), ambos utilizando voxels de 0, 25 mm. Através de imagens volumétricas (3 D) e imagens bidimensionais (2 D) de cortes multiplanares, foi comparada a mensuração da altura da borda alveolar dessas imagens com a mensuração direta nas mandíbulas, feita por vestibular e lingual, por três avaliadores, com o auxílio de um paquímetro, totalizando 114 bordas alveolares medidas. Alta reprodutibilidade intra-avaliador (0, 999 a 0, 902) e interavaliador (0, 998 e 0, 868) foi observada através do índice de correlação intraclasse (ICC). Observou-se alta correlação entre a mensuração direta e indireta da altura da borda alveolar em imagens 2 D, sendo r= 0, 923 ** e 0, 916 **, e em imagens 3 D, com r= 0, 929 ** <b>e</b> 0, <b>954</b> *, em TCFC e TCE, respectivamente. Imagens 2 D superestimam a altura da borda alveolar em 0, 32 e 0, 49 mm e imagens 3 D em 0, 34 e 0, 30 mm, em TCFC e TCE respectivamente. Quando o osso alveolar apresenta espessura de no mínimo 0, 6 mm a média da diferença entre medidas diretas e indiretas é de 0, 16 e 0, 28 mm em imagens 2 D e de 0, 12 e 0, 03 mm em imagens 3 D para TCFC e TCE respectivamente, sendo que 95 % do limite de concordância varia de - 0, 46 a 0, 79 mm e - 0, 32 a 0, 88 mm em imagens 2 D, e de - 0, 64 a 0, 67 mm e - 0, 57 a 0, 62 mm em imagens 3 D, para TCFC e TCE respectivamente. Quando o osso alveolar é mais fino do que 0, 6 mm a TC é imprecisa, pois 95 % do limite de concordância variou de - 1, 74 a 5, 42 mm e - 1, 64 a 5, 42 mm em imagens 2 D, e de - 3, 70 a 4, 28 mm e - 3, 49 a 4, 25 mm em imagens 3 D, para TCFC e TCE respectivamente. Conclui-se que a mensuração da altura da borda alveolar através de imagens tomográficas apresenta alta reprodutibilidade, sendo que quando a borda alveolar apresenta pelo menos 0, 6 mm, a precisão da mensuração é alta, todavia quando esta espessura é menor do que 0, 6 mm a técnica é imprecisa. Computerized tomogoraphy (CT) images {{allow for}} visualization, with no distortions or superimpostions, of the maxillo-facial complex, {{especially of the}} alveolar margins. Studies have demonstrated good reproducibility and precision of the alveolar bone height, however the influence of bone thickness is still scarcely described. The {{purpose of this study}} was, by comparing the direct measurement of alveolar bone height, to evaluate the precision, reproducibility and the influence of bone thickness on the same measurement in cone beam CT (CBCT) and spiral CT (SCT) volumetric and biplane images. Ten dry human mandibles, with a total of 57 anterior teeth were tomographed with an iCAT (Imaging Science International, Hatfield, PA, EUA) and a 64 channels Brilliance 64 tomograph (Philips Eletronics, Eindhoven, Holland), both using voxels of 0. 25 mm. Alveolar bone height was measured on volumetric (3 D) and bidimensional (2 D) images of tomograms and compared with direct caliper measurements performed on the dry mandibles, on the buccal and lingual sides, by three raters in a total of 114 measurements. High intra-rater (0. 999 a 0. 902) and inter-rater (0. 998 e 0. 868) reproducibility was observed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). A high correlation was also observed between the direct and indirect measurements of alveolar bone height in 2 D (r= 0. 923 ** e 0. 916 **), and 3 D images (r= 0. 929 ** <b>e</b> 0. <b>954</b> *), for CBCT and SCT, respectively. Two-dimensional images overestimate alveolar bone height in 0. 32 and 0. 49 mm and 3 D images in 0. 34 and 0. 30 mm, for CBCT and SCT, respectively. When alveolar bone thickness is at least 0. 6 mm the mean difference is of 0. 16 and 0. 28 mm in 2 D images and of 0. 12 and 0. 03 mm in 3 D images for CBCT and SCT, respectively, with 95 % limits of agreement ranging from - 0. 46 to 0. 79 mm and - 0. 32 to 0. 88 mm in 2 D images, and of - 0. 64 to 0. 67 mm and - 0. 57 to 0. 62 mm in 3 D images, for CBCT and SCT, respectively. When alveolar bone thickness is smaller than 0. 6 mm CT evaluation is inaccurate, since 95 % limits of agreement vary from - 1. 74 to 5. 42 mm and - 1. 64 to 5. 42 mm in 2 D images, and from - 3. 70 to 4. 28 mm and - 3. 49 to 4. 25 mm on 3 D images, for CBCT and SCT, respectively. It can be concluded that measurement of alveolar bone height on CT images presents high reproducibility.

A total of eight crossbred geldings at the age of six years and an average body weight of 330 kg were used in a complete randomized design with samples replicated on the same animals. The test-diets consisted of the ensiled high and low tannin sorghum grains replacing 30 % of the dry matter of the reference diet, constituted exclusively by hay. The daily dry matter intake was equivalent to 2. 0 % of the body weight, so, the test diets were constituted by 30 % of ensiled sorghum grains and 70 % of hay. The digestibility coefficients of the nutrients of the low and high tannin sorghum grain silages were obtained by the difference between the coefficient of digestibility of the nutrients of the reference diet and the test-diets. The values of digestibility of dry matter, energy and protein of the high tannin sorghum grain silage were lower (73. 65, 73. 65 and 71. 33 %) than low tanin sorghum grain silage (87. 70, 87. 70 and 82. 36 %). The contents of digestible dry matter, digestible protein, digestible starch, digestible neutral detergent fiber and digestible energy were 59. 08 %, 10. 63 %, 71. 48 %, 2. 32 % and 3, 954 Mcal/kg of dry matter of the low tannin sorghum grain silage and 50. 58 %, 8. 16 %, 67. 80 %, 3. 72 % and 3, 192 Mcal/kg of the dry matter of high tannin sorghum grain silage, respectively, therefore, only contents of digestible neutral detergent fiber and starch were similar among silages.

O objetivo neste trabalho foi determinar, por meio da digestibilidade, o valor nutritivo de silagens de grãos de sorgo de baixo e alto teor de tanino na alimentação de equinos. Foram utilizados oito cavalos castrados sem raça definida com seis anos de idade e 330 kg de peso corporal em delineamento inteiramente casualizado, com amostras repetidas nos mesmos animais. As dietas-teste foram compostas de grãos de sorgo ensilados de baixo e alto teor de tanino em substituição a 30 % da matéria seca da dieta-referência, constituída exclusivamente por feno. A ingestão diária de matéria seca foi equivalente a 2, 0 % do peso vivo, assim as dietas-teste foram compostas de 30 % de grãos de sorgo ensilados e 70 % de feno. Os coeficientes de digestibilidade dos nutrientes das silagens de grãos de sorgo com baixo e alto teores de tanino foram obtidos por diferença entre os coeficientes de digestibilidade dos nutrientes da dieta-referência e das dietas-teste.

A validade de conteÃdo da EACCC-HIV foi verificada pela concordÃncia entre os juÃzes (opiniÃo de cinco especialistas) e a anÃlise semÃntica por um {{professor}} de portuguÃs e tÃcnica de brainstorming. Na validade do construto comparou-se os grupos contrastados. Para a confiabilidade da escala utilizaram-se o alfa de cronbach e o teste-reteste. A pesquisa foi do tipo metodolÃgica com abordagem quantitativa, realizada em duas unidades de referÃncia no atendimento de crianÃas expostas ao HIV em Fortaleza-CE. A amostra aplicada no piloto foi constituÃda de 26 cuidadores de crianÃas expostas ao HIV. Quanto ao desenvolvimento metodolÃgico, ocorreu de fevereiro a outubro de 2008, e neste foram utilizados como instrumentos a escala inicial com 55 itens, a escala para o piloto com 70 itens e os formulÃrios para avaliaÃÃo com os juÃzes. Conforme os resultados revelaram, nos 55 itens iniciais uma concordÃncia de 98, 5 % (p= 0, 470) entre os juÃzes. No entanto, 32 itens foram mantidos, um excluÃdo e 16 incluÃdos, ficando o total de 70 itens para aplicaÃÃo no piloto. ApÃs a anÃlise semÃntica, 14 itens foram reformulados. Com 70 itens, o instrumento piloto foi aplicado na amostra de 26 cuidadores de crianÃas expostas ao HIV. A maioria dos cuidadores tinha entre 20 e 29 anos; convivia com o parceiro, a metade tinha o ensino fundamental completo e incompleto, grande parte estava desempregada e recebia menos de um salÃrio mÃnimo. Nos grupos contrastados, identificou-se nÃo ter havido associaÃÃo estatisticamente significante entre a variÃvel renda e 49 itens da escala. Existiu, porÃm, associaÃÃo significante ou valor limÃtrofe em sete itens (p< 0, 05). Neste caso sugere-se a variÃvel renda na aplicaÃÃo desta escala em outras pesquisas. A confiabilidade pelo alfa de cronbach apresentou valor total de 0, <b>954</b> <b>e</b> p= 0, 0001.

The validity of content of the EACCC-HIV was verified by the agreement enters the judges (opinion of five specialists) and the semantics analysis by Portuguese teacher and technique of Brainstorming. In the validity of construct were compared the contrasted groups. For the trustworthiness of the scale the Alpha of Cronbach and the test-retest had been used. The research was of the methodological type with quantitative boarding, carried through in two units of reference in the attendance of children displayed to the HIV in Fortaleza-CE. The sample applied in the pilot was constituted of 26 caregivers of children displayed to the HIV. How much to the methodological development, occurred of February to October of 2008, and in this had been used as instruments the initial scale with 55 item, the scale for the pilot with 70 item and the forms for evaluation with the judges. As the results had disclosed, in the 55 initial item an agreement of 98, 5 % (p= 0, 470) between the judges. However, 32 item had been kept, one excluded and 16 enclosed ones, being the total of 70 item for application in the pilot. After the semantics analysis, 14 item had been reformulated. With 70 item, the pilot instrument was applied in the sample of 26 caregivers of children displayed to the HIV. The majority of the caregivers had between 20 and 29 years; it coexisted the partner, the half had complete basic education and incomplete, great part was dismissed and received less from one minimum wage. In the contrasted groups, it was identified that not to have had statistical significant association between the changeable income and 49 item of the scale. It existed, however, significant association or bordering value in seven item (p< 0, 05). In this in case that it is suggested changeable income in the application of this scale in other research. The trustworthiness for the Alpha of Cronbach presented total value of 0, 954 and p= 0, 0001. Therefore, it had internal consistency of the item, but for the test-retest {{it was not possible to}} carry through statistical tests. In the second phase with the judges, the total Alpha of Cronbach for clarity, relation dimension-item and relevance got the value of 0, 800 and p= 0. 0001, demonstrating agreement between them.
