This method is relatively easy, inexpensive, {{and has no}} restriction on the scaffold materials that can be used. The procedure involves horizontally overlapping glass plates while keeping them vertically separated by a narrow gap filled with a polymer solution. The upper plate is moved at a constant velocity between 60 and 100µm/s. A thin liquid film of solution is continuously formed {{at the edge of}} the sliding glass following evaporation of the solvent. Stripe patterns prepared at speeds of 60, 70, and 100µm/s created width and groove spacings of 2.2 and 6.1µm, 3.6 and 8.4µm, and 4.3 and 12.7µm, respectively; the range of heights for the ridges was 50–100nm. Tsuruma, Tanaka et al. demonstrated that embryonic neural cells cultured on <b>film</b> <b>coated</b> with poly-L-lysine attached and elongated parallel to poly(ε-caprolactone)/chloroform solution (1g/L) stripes with narrow pattern width and spacing (width: 2.2µm, spacing: 6.1µm). However, the neurons grew across the axis of the patterns with wide width and spacing (width: 4.3µm, spacing: 12.7µm). On average, the neurons on the stripe-patterned films had less neurites per cell and longer neurites compared to the neurons on non-patterned films. Thus, the stripe pattern parameters are able to determine the growth direction, the length of neurites, and the number of neurites per cell.|$|E

During scale-up and scale-down of the <b>film</b> <b>coating</b> process, differences in film density and gaps between the film-coated layer and the uncoated tablet were generated {{due to differences in}} <b>film</b> <b>coating</b> process parameters, such as the tablet-filling rate in the coating machine, spray pressure, and gas–liquid ratio etc. Tablets using the PEO/PEG formulation were employed as uncoated tablets. We found that heat and humidity caused tablets to swell, thereby breaking the film-coated layer. Using our novel approach with terahertz wave nondestructively detect film surface density (FSD) and interface density differences (IDDs) between the film-coated layer and an uncoated tablet. We also found that a reduced FSD and IDD between the film-coated layer and uncoated tablet increased the risk of crack initiation in the film-coated layer, thereby enabling us to nondestructively predict initiation of cracks in the film-coated layer. Using this method, crack initiation can be nondestructively assessed in swelling tablets after the <b>film</b> <b>coating</b> process without conducting accelerated stability tests, and <b>film</b> <b>coating</b> process parameters during scale-up and scale-down studies can be appropriately established...|$|R

50|$|The {{purpose of}} a clean room mat is to keep sterile the areas that require {{ultimate}} protection from dirt, bacteria and any contamination brought from outside. Clean room mats are tacky, sticky, non slip mats that possess multiple layers of clean film that effectively capture dirt and dust from foot traffic and wheels. Peel-off mats {{are made up of}} multiple sheets of polyethylene <b>film</b> <b>coated</b> with acrylic adhesive that traps particles. Each layer peels off to reveal a new clean surface. The adhesive backing prevents microbial growth and contamination. Mats used outside clean rooms and laboratories are designed to withhold foreign pollution elements. This goal is achieved by a sticky surface that serves as a barrier for debris, dirt and dust adhered to shoe soles. Clean room sticky mats can contain two defensive barriers: the first part is a carpet itself, while the second part is sticky surface mat. Another mat type to be used to protect rooms from pollution is sanitizing foot bath floor mats. The mat itself is a small bath that contains sanitizing liquid. The foot bath bottom is covered with pliable rubber scrapers for effective cleaning of footwear soles while the liquid disinfects them.|$|E
