40|$|In July 1993, on the {{initiative}} of the European Commission (<b>DG</b> <b>XXIII),</b> a Round Table was established to develop better co-operation between the European Banks and their SME clients. The Leading Representatives of the Banking Sector and Professional SME Organisations, in their Report of May 1994, highlighted several problems between banks and SMEs. Although {{the main focus of}} the Second Round Table, established in September 1995, was to identify Best Practices used by banks and SME representative bodies, the Final Report published in February 1997 also observed a structural change in the orientation of banks towards their clients in general and SMEs in particular.

40|$|Maintaining and {{improving}} high quality supply in Europe {{is fundamental to}} keeping Europe's leading position as a destination in world tourism, to meeting the challenges of competitors and to increasing its market share. The paper {{presents the results of}} eight best practice case studies of different destinations in four European countries, which were part of a study, assigned by the European Commission (<b>DG</b> <b>XXIII).</b> The {{purpose of the study was}} to determine whether selected European destinations apply integrated quality management as a means to raise their competitiveness. To this end a comparative survey of destinations was conducted, based on the European Foundation for Quality Management (EFQM) model. Its results indicated that integrated quality management in tourist destinations is rather underdeveloped. In general, destinations tend to be strong in one element of the EFQM model, such as policy and strategy or human resources management, as opposed to showing a balanced and integrated approach to quality management.

The seminar was organised by the Otaniemi Science Park Ltd. The event took place as a follow-up to Concerted Actions 2 and 3 between the Member States of the European Union and the European Commission. One of the features of the Enterprise Policy, at a European level, is the “Concerted Actions”, which promotes the exchange of best practices between Member States. The Concerted Actions aim to increase the efficiency of Member States ’ actions in the improvement of the business environment and in the stimulation of business support measures through sharing experiences and examining the results of different actions on the ground. A number of follow-up seminars in 1998, under Concerted Actions 2 & 3, dealt with three important categories of support measures which were identified at the Madrid Forum: finance, training, and infrastructure (particularly in launching technology based enterprises). The first of the series was a seminar in Rome, in February 1998, on th...|$|E
