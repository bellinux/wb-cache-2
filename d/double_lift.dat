40|$|Abstract. The {{horizontal}} boom of {{the tower}} crane in the rotary plane is a cantilever structure with large flexibility. Its stability analysis belongs to critical load problems under double non-conservative forces. In this paper, the second-order theory is used to establish the deflection differential equation in the rotary plane of the horizontal boom. According to the deformation compatibility conditions and the boundary conditions, the exact expression of the deflection equation and the instability characteristic equation in the rotary plane are obtained. The premise of the stability analysis {{is to determine the}} force relationship of the two pulling rods in the horizontal boom with <b>double</b> <b>lifting</b> points, which is a statically indeterminate structure. This paper is aimed at the structural characteristics and the load forms of the general boom. For the calculation of the pulling rod forces in the boom, the general expression is deduced considering the variety of the cross-section, the load and the position of lifting points. A highly efficient method for the stability analysis of the horizontal boom with double pulling rods is provided by the analytic expression of the instability characteristic equation and the internal forces in the statically indeterminate pulling rods.

However, site {{inspection}} suggests that the same (brick) water tanks have been adapted and/or re-used for the later gasholders.

5000|$|A fifth watch {{could have}} been made during the {{development}} period for the échappement naturel. Watch number 2179 is a gold repeating watch of ‘normal’ size and is described on a Breguet certificate from 1971 as having an échappement naturel [...] However, it was catalogued for a sale in 2002 of items from the Time Museum by Anthony Randall as having a <b>double</b> <b>lift</b> Robin escapement. It is quite probable that work was started on this watch with a view to it having an échappement naturel but, like watch 1484, it was completed and taken into stock with a Robin escapement. Photocopies of the workbook entry accompanying the sale of the watch stated that its construction was started in 1806, after the delivery of both watch 1135 and watch 1711. It was sold on 29 December 1823 to the Duchess of Dalmatia for the price of 3200 Francs.|$|E
50|$|Breguet used Robin escapements in {{a number}} of {{carriage}} and chamber clocks, at least one marine chronometer {{and more than a dozen}} watches between 1807 and 1823, mostly between 1807 and 1815. The series included a group of consecutively numbered minute repeating perpetuelles delivered between 1812 and 1816 and at least one tourbillon, number 1297 delivered in 1808. As Daniels pointed out, the <b>double</b> <b>lift</b> Robin escapement suffered from a serious fault as a precision escapement. The necessity for oil on the lever impulse surface resulted in oil being transferred, via the escape wheel teeth, to the direct impulse pin on the balance for the alternative impulse. Some watches and carriage clocks had two separate coaxial escape wheels to keep the oil away from the balance impulse (as in 2179) but the Robin escapement was not apparently developed further after the échappement naturel for serious precision timekeeping in watches, except by Daniels himself in making the crucial developments that totally separate the functions of impulse and locking now used by Omega in his coaxial escapement.|$|E

5000|$|The South African Sheepdog Association was {{established}} in 1961 {{when a group of}} farmers in the Karoo came together to discuss the future of the sheepdog in South Africa.

In the beginning the course was very much like the ones used in Australia but gradually changed to the English version.The current course with the <b>double</b> <b>lift,</b> which has been implemented in 2001, has been taken over virtually as is from the one used for the international championship in the United Kingdom and in so doing putting South African dogs and handlers on the same foot as their overseas counterparts.Through the years the South African Sheepdog Association still strives toward its main objective - to introduce farmers and other interested people to sheepdogs as a labour saving force. This is done through demonstrations and courses, as well as competitions, where breeding success is tested and the best breeding material selected according to working ability.The previous logo appears on the right.|$|E

The lowest unit delivered cooling cost values and solar collector type are obtained, which will provide theoretical foundation for optimization and operation management of the solar LiBr/H 2 O SE/DL absorption refrigeration system.
