This study aimed to determine the model of the determinants of woman fertility of reproductive couples in Islamic study group in South Palu Distric of Palu City. This study used a cross sectional study design. The sample size was 149 of the women reproductive couples in Islamic study group. Sample selection method was a simple random sampling.

5000|$|In {{contrast}} to bicalutamide and other pure antiandrogens or , antigonadotropic antiandrogens suppress gonadotropin secretion, {{which in turn}} diminishes testosterone production by the testes {{as well as the}} maintenance of the testes by , resulting in atrophy and loss of their function.

40|$|National Institute for Child Health and Human Development (P 30 HD 05876). This paper {{examines}} whether son preference has {{a strong}} positive <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>fertility</b> rates. To test this hypothesis, Korea {{was used as a}} case because Korea still shows strong son preference but its fertility rates have reached below the replacement level. To reject the positive effect of sex preference <b>on</b> total <b>fertility</b> rates, number preference must be distinguished from sex preference. Statistical analysis shows that the existence of a son {{has a strong}}er <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>fertility</b> behavior in Korea than the number of children. Through sex-selective technologies, abnormally higher sex ratios at birth have occurred since 1985. I argue that the fertility rates below the replacement level during the late 1980 s are not permanent but a temporary phenomenon, through increased birth intervals and late ages at marriage. 1 Sex preference has generally been assumed to have a significant <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>fertility</b> behaviors (i. e., Cain, 1993; Mason, 1993; Nugent, 1985).
