6000|$|The {{philosophy}} of this transformation will not seem surprizing {{to people who}} search {{into the bottom of}} things. Madam Bourignon, a devout French lady, has shewn us, how man was at first created male and female in one individual, having the faculty of propagation within himself: A circumstance necessary to the state of innocence, wherein a man's happiness was not to depend upon the caprice of another. It was not till after he had made a faux pas, that he had his female mate. Many such transformations of individuals have been well attested; particularly one by Montaigne, and another by the late Bishop of Salisbury. From all which it appears, that this system of male and female has already undergone and may hereafter suffer, several alterations. Every smatterer in anatomy knows, that a woman is but an introverted man; a new fusion and flatus will turn the <b>hollow</b> <b>bottom</b> of a bottle into a convexity; but I forbear, (for the sake of my modest men-readers, who are in a few days to be virgins.) ...|$|E

[...] 260 [...] Again, God said, let ther be Firmament [...] Amid the Waters, and let it divide [...] The Waters from the Waters: and God made [...] The Firmament, expanse of liquid, pure, [...] Transparent, Elemental Air, diffus'd [...] In circuit to the uttermost convex [...] Of this great Round: partition firm and sure, [...] The Waters underneath from those above [...] Dividing: for as Earth, so hee the World [...] Built on circumfluous Waters calme, in wide [...] 270 [...] Crystallin Ocean, and the loud misrule [...] Of Chaos farr remov'd, least fierce extreames [...] Contiguous might distemper the whole frame: [...] And Heav'n he nam'd the Firmament: So Eev'n [...] And Morning Chorus sung the second Day. [...] The Earth was form'd, but in the Womb as yet [...] Of Waters, Embryon immature involv'd, [...] Appeer'd not: over all the face of Earth [...] Main Ocean flow'd, not idle, but with warme [...] Prolific humour soft'ning all her Globe, [...] 280 [...] Fermented the great Mother to conceave, [...] Satiate with genial moisture, when God said [...] Be gather'd now ye Waters under Heav'n [...] Into one place, and let dry Land appeer.

[...] Again th' Almightie spake: Let there be Lights [...] High in th' expanse of Heaven to divide [...] 340 [...] The Day from Night; and let them be for Signes, [...] For Seasons, and for Dayes, and circling Years, [...] And let them be for Lights as I ordaine [...] Thir Office in the Firmament of Heav'n [...] To give Light on the Earth; and it was so.

God saw, [...] Surveying his great Work, that it was good: [...] For of Celestial Bodies first the Sun [...] A mightie Spheare he fram'd, unlightsom first, [...] Though of Ethereal Mould: then form'd the Moon [...] Globose, and everie magnitude of Starrs, [...] And sowd with Starrs the Heav'n thick as a field: [...] Of Light by farr the greater part he took, [...] Transplanted from her cloudie Shrine, and plac'd [...] 360 [...] In the Suns Orb, made porous to receive [...] And drink the liquid Light, firm to retaine [...] Her gather'd beams, great Palace now of Light. [...] Hither as to thir Fountain other Starrs [...] Repairing, in thir gold'n Urns draw Light, [...] And hence the Morning Planet guilds his horns; [...] By tincture or reflection they augment [...] Thir small peculiar, though from human sight [...] So farr remote, with diminution seen. [...] First in his East the glorious Lamp was seen, [...] 370 [...] Regent of Day, and all th' Horizon round [...] Invested with bright Rayes, jocond to run [...] His Longitude through Heav'ns high rode: the gray [...] Dawn, and the Pleiades before him danc'd [...] Shedding sweet influence: less bright the Moon, [...] But opposite in leveld West was set [...] His mirror, with full face borrowing her Light [...] From him, for other light she needed none [...] In that aspect, and still that distance keepes [...] Till night, then in the East her turn she shines, [...] 380 [...] Revolvd on Heav'ns great Axle, and her Reign [...] With thousand lesser Lights dividual holds, [...] With thousand thousand Starres, that then appeer'd [...] Spangling the Hemisphere: then first adornd [...] With thir bright Luminaries that Set and Rose, [...] Glad Eevning & glad Morn crownd the fourth day. [...] And God said, let the Waters generate [...] Reptil with Spawn abundant, living Soule: [...] And let Fowle flie above the Earth, with wings [...] Displayd on the op'n Firmament of Heav'n. [...] 390 [...] And God created the great Whales, and each [...] Soul living, each that crept, which plenteously [...] The waters generated by thir kindes, [...] And every Bird of wing after his kinde; [...] And saw that it was good, and bless'd them, saying, [...] Be fruitful, multiply, and in the Seas [...] And Lakes and running Streams the waters fill; [...] And let the Fowle be multiply'd on the Earth.

40|$|ABSTRACTIn the {{proposed}} paper numerical {{calculations are carried}} out using two versions of a three-dimensional, time-domain panel method developed by the group of Prof. P. Sclavounos at MIT, i. e. the linear code SWAN 2, enabling optionally {{the use of the}} instantaneous non-linear Froude-Krylov and hydrostatic forces and the fully non-linear SWAN 4. The analytical results are compared with experimental results for three hull forms with increasing geometrical complexity, the Series 60, a reefer vessel with stern bulb and a modern fast ROPAX hull form with <b>hollow</b> <b>bottom</b> in the stern region. The details of the geometrical modeling of the hull forms are discussed. In addition, since SWAN 4 does not support transom sterns, only the two versions of SWAN 2 were evaluated over experimental results for the parent hull form of the NTUA double-chine, wide-transom, high-speed monohull series. The effect of speed on the numerical predictions was investigated. It is concluded that both versions of SWAN 2 the linear and the one with the non-linear Froude-Krylov and hydrostatic forces provide a more robust tool for prediction of the dynamic response of the vessels than the non-linear SWAN 4 code. In general, their results are close to what was expected on the basis of experience. Furthermore, the use of the option of non-linear Froude-Krylov and hydrostatic forces is beneficial for the accuracy of the predictions. The content of the paper is based on the Diploma thesis of the second author, supervised by the first one and further refined by the third one...|$|E
40|$|Reducing {{the number}} of {{transitions}} of manufacturing products {{and the increase in}} the degree of deformation at a transition in shaping sheet metal forming processes can improve the performance of manufacturing and makes the resulting products competitive. For the drawing process developed ways of shaping with the use of differential radial flange backwater using liquid drawing in a die of special profile and the combined drawing in the double cone die special profile. Using computer simulation by the method of finite elements, was found that application of backwater significantly reduce the amount of tensile stresses in the dangerous section, which result is the destruction of the wall. Reduction of these strains has increased the degree of deformation in one transition and reduce {{the number of}} drawing transitions. The use of traditional drawing in a die of special profiles and combined drawing in double-cone die of special profile also reduced the number of presswork transitions. The experimental results confirmed the results of the calculations. Was found the analytical dependences for determining the parameters of the combined drawing in the double-cone die. For processes of reducing tubular and <b>hollow</b> <b>bottom</b> blanks were used the application of liquid back pressure to the inner surface of the blanks and reducing was applied in the die of special profile. Calculation found that counter-pressure application with reducing of tubular of steel billets leads to the exclusion of loss of stability of the preform wall and forming of the cross-ribbed on the wall and on the deformed part of the workpiece, which allowed to obtain products with the neck in one transition. During reducing was applied cone and spherical dies of special profile. In such dies deforming surface is formed by the intersection of the circles of constant diameter whose centers are positioned at an angle with a certain step. Forming on these surfaces ensure the reduction of the friction forces in forming and increasing the degree of deformation in one transition. Using the pre-operation profiling wall of tubular or hollow blanks with the bottom results in reducing products of constant wall thickness. Prototypes of products was obtained by experimental way. Was founded the analytical dependences for determining the reducing force, the shape and size of the deformed part of the blanks. The developed method of outward flanging of the holes in the sheet metal blanks and profiles provides receiving of deformed part with a constant wall thickness without distortion. Constant wall thickness leads to an increase in the height of products after outward flanging with thinning and increased reliability and durability detachable and permanent joints which are formed by outward flanging products with other items. Using the pre-profiling of the blanks and profiles by cold extrusion forming holes followed by punching jumper leads to saving metal. Calculations and experiments have shown the possibility of obtaining constant wall thickness. For engineering calculation of parameters of preliminary profiling blanks and parameters of outward flanging was founded analytical according to the definition of power modes, the specific efforts on the instrument and final shape and size of deformed blanks. For various configurations of flanges on tubular workpieces and pipes was developed method of bulging by punch of special profile. At such punch deforming surface is formed by the intersection of the circles of constant diameter whose centers are located at an angle to the corresponding step. By computer simulation was found and confirmed by experiment punch profile, which provides a reduction of the friction forces in the forming in the bulging processes and increase the bulging ratio. ?????????? ?????????? ????????? ???????????? ??????? ? ?????????? ??????? ?????????? ?? ???? ??????? ? ??????????????? ????????? ???????? ????????? ????????? ???????? ?????????????????? ???????????? ? ?????? ?????????? ????????? ???????????????????. ??? ????????? ??????? ??????????? ??????? ???????????????? ?? ??????????? ??????????????????? ??????????? ??????? ?????? ? ??????? ????????, ??????? ? ??????? ???????????? ??????? ? ??????????????? ??????? ? ???????????? ??????? ???????????? ???????. ? ?????????????? ????????????? ????????????? ??????? ???????? ????????? ???????????, ??? ?????????? ??????? ??????????? ????????? ???????? ????????????? ?????????? ? ??????? ???????, ??????? ???????? ? ?????????? ??????. ?????????? ????????? ?????????? ????????? ????????? ??????? ?????????? ?? ???? ??????? ? ??????? ?????????? ????????? ???????. ????????????? ????????????? ??????????? ? ??????? ???????????? ??????? ? ???????????????? ??????????? ? ???????????? ??????? ???????????? ??????? ????? ????????? ????????? ?????????? ????????? ?????????. ??????????? ????????????????? ???????????? ??????????? ?????????? ????????. ???????? ????????????? ??????????? ??? ??????????? ?????????? ??????????????? ??????? ? ???????????? ???????; ??? ????????? ?????? ????????? ? ????? ????????? ? ???? ???? ???????????? ?????????? ??????????????? ? ??????? ???????? ?? ?????????? ??????????? ????????? ? ???????? ????? ? ??????? ???????????? ???????. ???????? ???????????, ??? ?????????? ??????????????? ??? ?????? ????????? ????????? ?? ????? ???????? ? ?????????? ?????? ???????????? ?????? ????????? ? ??????????? ?????????? ???? ?? ?????? ? ???????????????? ????? ?????????, ??? ????????? ???????? ??????? ? ?????????? ?? ???? ???????. ??? ?????? ????????? ???????? ?? ??????????? ??????? ???????????? ???????. ? ????? ???????? ????????????? ??????????? ?????????? ???????????? ??????????? ??????????? ????????, ?????? ??????? ??????????? ??? ????? ? ???????????? ?????. ?????????????? ?? ????? ???????????? ?????????? ?????????? ??????? ??? ?????? ??? ???????????????? ? ?????????? ??????? ?????????? ?? ???? ???????. ????????????? ??????????????? ???????? ?????????????? ?????? ????????? ??? ????? ????????? ? ???? ???????? ? ????????? ??????? ??????? ?? ?????????? ???????? ??????. ????????????????? ????? ???????? ??????? ??????? ???????. ???????? ????????????? ??????????? ??? ??????????? ?????? ??????, ????? ? ???????? ???????????????? ????? ?????????. ????????????? ?????? ?????????? ????????? ? ???????? ?????????? ? ???????? ???????????? ????????? ???????????????? ????? ? ?????????? ???????? ?????? ??? ???????????. ?????????? ??????? ?????? ???????? ? ?????????? ?????? ??????? ????? ?????????? ? ?????????? ? ????????? ?????????? ? ????????????? ????????? ? ??????????? ??????????, ??????? ?????????? ?????????????? ????????? ? ??????? ????????. ????????????? ???????????????? ?????????????? ???????? ????????? ? ???????? ????? ???????????????? ????????? ???????? ????????????? ? ??????????? ????????? ????????? ???????? ? ???????? ???????. ???????? ? ????????????? ???????? ??????????? ????????? ?????? ?????????? ???????. ??? ?????????? ???????? ?????????? ???????????????? ?????????????? ????????? ? ?????????? ?????????? ???????? ????????????? ??????????? ??? ??????????? ??????? ???????, ???????? ?????? ?? ??????????? ? ???????? ????? ? ???????? ???????????????? ?????????. ??? ????????? ??????? ????????? ???????????? ?? ????????? ?????????? ? ?????? ?????????? ?????? ??????? ????????? ???????????? ???????. ? ?????? ???????? ????????????? ??????????? ?????????? ???????????? ??????????? ??????????? ????????, ?????? ??????? ??????????? ??? ????? ? ??????????????? ?????. ???????????? ?????????????? ?????????? ? ??????????? ????????????? ??????? ????????, ??????? ???????????? ?????????? ??????? ??? ?????? ?? ???????????????? ??? ??????? ? ?????????? ???????????? ???????...|$|E
