After a brief skirmish with his old nemeses, the newsboys, <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> shop's window where he suddenly sees the girl, who has been watching him without (of course) knowing who he is. At {{the sight of her}} he is frozen for a few seconds, then breaks into a broad smile. The girl is flattered and giggles to her employee: [...] "I've made a conquest!" [...] Via pantomime through the glass, she kindly offers him a fresh flower (to replace the crushed one he took from the gutter) and a coin.|$|E
500|$|The cloaked figure murders another gangster, Buzz Bronski, in {{the same}} {{cemetery}} Bruce met Andrea. Batman investigates Bronski's death and wanders to his parents' tombstone. He overhears Andrea talking at her mother's grave, {{just as she had}} been when he first met her. She is startled by Batman's appearance and he flees. Batman finds evidence linking Carl Beaumont with Sol, Bronski and a third gangster: Salvatore Valestra. He breaks into Valestra's home and discovers a photograph of Bronski, Valestra, Sol and Beaumont seated at a table. When he visits Andrea to try to get more answers she rebuffs him, intimating that she knows his identity. Meanwhile, Valestra believes Batman killed the others and will come for him, so <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Joker for help.|$|E
500|$|Published in 8 A.D. the Metamorphoses of Ovid {{has become}} one of the most {{influential}} poems by the Latin writers. The Metamorphoses showed that Ovid was more interested in questioning how the laws interfered with people's lives than in writing epic tales like Virgil's Aeneid and Homer's Odyssey. The Metamorphoses is not narrated by Ovid, but rather by the characters inside the stories. The myth of Myrrha and Cinyras is sung by Orpheus in the tenth book of Metamorphoses after he has told the myth of Pygmalion and before <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tale of Venus and Adonis. As the myth of Myrrha is also the longest tale sung by Orpheus (205 lines) and the only story that corresponds to his announced theme of girls punished for forbidden desire, it is considered the centerpiece of the song. Ovid opens the myth with a warning to the audience that this is a myth of great horror, especially to fathers and daughters: ...|$|E

500|$|The {{anonymous}} author dedicates {{his work to}} the activist and author Rigas Feraios and condemns the feudal behavior of the Greek clergy. Moreover, he advocates {{the transition to a}} new economic structure based upon small agricultural producers and craftsmen. By applying the physiocratic principles, he argued that peasants were society's backbone, or as he put it, [...] "the column of society". However, the author argued that because of number of external factors, such as feudalism and state intervention, they had a very low living standard. The main references in the book are to the ancient Greek philosophical works, although the influence of contemporary European thinkers such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Montesquieu, and Voltaire is obvious in the author's endeavor to describe a [...] "fair and humane" [...] society. On the other hand, {{when it comes to the}} struggle for national liberation <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> moral greatness of ancient Greece in order to stimulate collective pride and to describe models of heroism and patriotism: ...|$|E
500|$|The notary arrives, and Schicchi {{starts to}} dictate the new will, declaring any prior will null and void. To general {{satisfaction}} he allocates the minor bequests, {{but when it}} comes to the mule, the house and the mills, he orders that these be left to [...] "my devoted friend Gianni Schicchi". Incredulous, the family can do nothing while the lawyer is present, especially when Schicchi slyly reminds them of the penalties that discovery of the ruse will bring. Their outburst of rage when the notary leaves is countered by a love duet from Lauretta and Rinuccio, [...] "Lauretta mia"; there is now no bar to their marriage, since Schicchi can provide a full dowry. Schicchi chases the relatives out of what is now his house, and when he returns stands moved at the sight of the two lovers. <b>He</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> audience and asks them to agree that no better use could be found for Buoso's wealth. Although the poet Dante has condemned him to hell for this trick, Schicchi asks the audience to forgive him in light of [...] "extenuating circumstances." ...|$|E
500|$|She {{continues}} {{walking down}} the street, where she smashes the camera of a paparazzi photographer who takes pictures of her. More paparazzi appear as she runs away and jumps {{on top of a}} taxi. Spears then stands atop of it, wielding the microphone as a weapon against the paparazzi who are hassling her. Across the street, a marquee of the cinema besides her reads , referencing her film debut Crossroads. After all the paparazzi, revealed to be cyborgs, have been knocked to the floor, they start crawling back with their eyes glowing red and their faces bursting with wires, reminiscent to a scene in [...] (1991). A car suddenly pulls up near to Spears, and the driver Guillermo Díaz tells her to get inside. In the next scene, Spears dances in the passenger seat in a pink bikini top, as Guillermo drives. He attempts to drink some milk while driving but pours the carton of milk over his face. His chest starts to spark, and Spears pulls open his jacket to reveal that he too is a cyborg. The video then cuts back to the press conference, indicating that Spears was daydreaming, due to being asked monotonous and inappropriate questions. Guillermo steps in and leads Spears out of the room. Then, <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> camera with his eyes glowing red, and his laugh is heard, referencing Michael Jackson's Thriller (1983).|$|E

2500|$|In {{the second}} half of the 17th century, it became {{customary}} to place the tabernacle on the main altar of the church. When a priest celebrates Mass at such an altar with his back to the people, he sometimes necessarily turns his back directly to the Blessed Sacrament, as when <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> people at the Orate fratres. This seeming disrepect is absent when the priest stands on the side of the altar away from the people; but locating so large an object on the altar is arguably inconvenient for a celebration in which the priest faces the people. Accordingly, the revised Roman Missal states: ...|$|E

On Sundays, he would discuss theology, and on Wednesdays any other subject, and those who went to hear him would pay a shilling each ("Oh great Restorer of the good old Stage,/ Preacher at once, and Zany of thy Age!" [...] 201–202), while learned bishops and skilled preachers spoke to empty congregations. Next come the theatres: [...] a Dr. Faustus was the toast of the 1726–1727 season, with both Lincoln's Inn Fields and Drury Lane competing {{for more and more}} lavish stage effects to get the audiences in: ...|$|E

Meanwhile, he puts his plan into action to take everything and everyone away from Alison, leaving her with no money and no friends. With Wayne believing his wife Susan is dead, Alison decides to use Susan to get at Wayne but the plan backfires when Susan is left lying dead on the lounge room floor at Dural, having apparently been strangled by Wayne. Realising that he's finally gone too far, <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> telephone and makes a call. He asks for the police... Alison faces bankruptcy but is reunited with David.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the second}} half of the 17th century it became {{customary}} to place the tabernacle on the main altar of the church. When a priest celebrates Mass on the same side as the people at such an altar, he sometimes necessarily turns his back directly to the tabernacle, as when <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> people at the Orate, fratres. While there is no stipulation forbidding that the tabernacle remain on the principal altar of the church – even should the priest say Mass facing the people – the revised Roman Missal states that it is [...] "more appropriate as a sign that on an altar on which Mass is celebrated there not be a tabernacle in which the Most Holy Eucharist is reserved", in which case it is [...] "preferable that the tabernacle be located": ...|$|E
2500|$|However, Giovanni {{rushes in}} {{with the news that}} all is well: Aurelio has been saved. Both father and wife express their joy (Cabaletta: Eustachio, then Eleonora, then both: Un instante i mali obblio / Dell' orrenda e lunga guerra!... / [...] "In one moment I forgot the {{troubles}} / Of the long, horrendous war!"). Pietro enters to confirm that Aurelio is safe but is changing his clothes. [...] His wife demands that he be brought to her and, when Aurelio arrives he brings with him their young son, Filippo. [...] There is a great reunion of all four: (Aurelio's Aria di sortita: cantabile: Al mio cor oggetti amati / Vi congiunga un solo amplesso... / [...] "Let me hold to my heart / All my dearest in one embrace"). [...] Overcoming tears, Aurelio is questioned as to the chances of survival. <b>He</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> problems at hand, fiercely proclaiming that there is nothing {{that can be done to}} survive the English attack except by fighting to the end: (Cabaletta: Aureilo, then ensemble: Giovanni, Eleanora, Eustachio; Aurelio repeats, then all: Giammai del forte l'ardir non langue / [...] "The audacity of the strong never languishes").|$|E
2500|$|In the Enchanted Forest, Prince Henry {{is trying}} to {{convince}} his daughter, Regina, still after Snow White's heart, to give up vengeance, but she is unable {{to let go of}} her anger. <b>He</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Magic Mirror in desperation to speak with Cora, believing {{that the best way to}} force Regina to get over Snow White is to just help her complete her plot, which Prince Henry is not in favor of. Unknown to Prince Henry and Regina, Cora has managed to enter the realm of the Enchanted Forest through the mirror again. Later on, Prince Henry meets with Snow White in the woods. When she sees the real Prince Henry approaching her, she realizes that the first Prince Henry was actually Cora, who rips out her heart while she is distracted. Cora takes Snow's heart to Regina as a birthday present, only to then learn that Snow switched it out with that of a guard. It turned out that Prince Henry saved Snow White by switching the hearts. A furious Regina then shrinks her father and condemns him into the very box that was holding the heart. Regina confronts Cora and sends her mother back into the mirror and seals it forever. [...] At the last minute Cora takes the box containing her husband so Regina will be truly alone.|$|E
