5|$|Cullompton Manor House is a grade II* listed {{building}} with sections built in 1603 (dated panel and initials TT for Thomas Trock {{on the top}} corner of {{the front of the}} house) and 1718 (on a lead cistern head of a <b>drainpipe,</b> are the letters (L) S/WT (R) and the date 1718). It was originally a private residence and now forms part of the Manor House Hotel. It has a jettied half timbered front with four gables and stone end walls with upper windows on carved brackets. It was probably built in the sixteenth century but was refurbished in 1603 for Thomas Trock, a clothier. The original structure consisted only of the front part, in which there were three rooms and a passage on the ground floor, three rooms opening into each other on the floor above, and above again. The front room on the left was the former hall with large oak panels of the Queen Anne period, and a moulded and beamed ceiling. Part of an earlier newel stair which descended to the hall or kitchen survives above a back staircase. The house was remodelled in 1718 for William Sellock. At the front of the building is a hooded shell porch of the early 18th century supported on pilasters and the back of house is also early 18th century of red and blue brick, with windows with thick glazing bars beneath a hipped slate roof with coved eaves. It was given the name of The Manor House in 1850 by J. S. Upcott who owned the property at that time. During World War II it was requisitioned by the army and used to billet officers. The adjacent house, Veryards, was originally a separate residence but was bought by the owners of the Manor House Hotel and incorporated into the hotel in the 1980s.|$|E

25|$|The {{apartment}} where Bembenek and Fred Schultz lived shared drainage with another apartment. In the shared <b>drainpipe</b> was found a brownish-red wig which matched {{some of the}} hairs found on the victim's body. The woman who occupied the other apartment testified that Judy Zess had knocked on her door and asked to use her bathroom; after Zess used the woman's bathroom, the plumbing was mysteriously clogged. Zess had also admitted to owning a brownish-red wig.|$|E

40|$|During {{the second}} half of the 20 th century, {{numerous}} land drainage systems using new materials for the drain channels that often function inadequately due to biochemical and mechanical clogging, were developed. The design of <b>drainpipes</b> and envelope materials used for these land drainage systems was based on both theoretical and experimental investigations. This contribution reviews the simultaneous development of theory and practical experience in Europe and North America. The results of the effect of perforation shape and pattern in <b>drainpipes</b> and of envelope materials on drainage performance are summarized and the latest design criteria of granular materials and synthetic envelopes presented. Theoretical investigations are associated with field data on the performance of drainage materials. A thorough knowledge, not only of the flow conditions, but also of the physical soil properties in the vicinity of the drains is imperative for a correct interpretation of field data. This contribution represents the main features on <b>drainpipes</b> and envelope materials, and the physical soil processes that occur in the vicinity of the drain. It gives an overview of the research work done referring to numerous publications where relevant and detailed information can be found...|$|R

40|$|At several {{landslide}} {{areas in}} Niigata pre f ecture, the reddish-brown microbial mats formed in <b>drainpipes</b> and water catchments {{well for a}} short period such as within three years after the construction. In this study, the damage situation in such an institution by microbial mats formed by iron bacteria, and examined growth environment of iron bacteria on <b>drainpipes</b> at landslide areas in Niigata prefecture. The microbial mats were formed by iron bacteria, such as Toxothrix trichogenes and Leptothrix ocheracea. The microbial mats were more remarkable in areas mainly containing clays than sandstone areas. The microbial mats were seen in the aquatic environment where the oxidation-reduction potential (Eh) was in the range of + 165 to + 244 mV and the concentration of dissolved oxygen (DO) was in the range of 2. 7 to 7. 4 mg/L. In addition, more microbial mats were formed around the part in the range of about 0 to 15 meters from the aperture mouth of <b>drainpipes,</b> while less microbial mats were formed in the deep part of <b>drainpipes.</b> The formation of microbial mats was remarkable under the condition where the reductive groundwater was exposed to the atmosphere and suddenly changed into an oxidation state. The formation of microbial mats changes groundwater quality itself. High pressure wa ter {{is the only way to}} wash off the microbial mats at this moment. However, the microbial mats are formed completely within several months to one year at Ohirota landslide area in Niigata prefecture. 地すべり地域で施工された水抜きボーリングや集水井の中には,施工後短期間のうちに赤褐色のスケール(バイオマット) が形成され,排水機能に支障が現れているものがある. 新潟県中越地方の 3 ヶ所の地すべり地域において,水抜きボーリング孔に形成されたバイオマットの観察事例を示し,その構成物や地質,地下水の水質との関連やその形成過程について検討を行った. これらのバイオマットは,Toxothrix trichogenesやL eptothrix ocheraceaなどの鉄バクテリアによって形成されている. 第三紀層地すべり地域の水抜きボーリングにおいて,砂岩優勢の地質状況下では珪藻やシアノバクテリアの繁殖が見られ,粘土優勢の地質状況下において鉄細菌バイオマットの形成が著しいことが明らかになった. 鉄細菌バイオマットの形成が見られる地下水の酸化還元電位(Eh) は+ 165 -+ 244 mVと比較的還元的で,かつ溶存酸素(DO) が 2. 7 - 7. 4 mg/Lの微好気的な環境を示していた. また,バイオマットは水抜きボーリングの孔口から約 0 - 15 m間程度の付近で多く形成されており,ボーリングの奥部ではあまり形成されていないことが明らかになった. 本研究の結果から,粘土・泥岩地域の還元的な地下水が大気に触れ,急激に酸化状態になるような環境下においてバイオマットの形成が著しいことが示された. バイオマットの形成は,鉄濃度や溶存酸素,酸化還元電位などの地下水環境の違いにより引き起こされ,それが 2 次的に溶存酸素や酸化還元電位などをさらに変化させているものと推定された. 現状におけるバイオマットの目詰まり対策として,高圧水による定期的な洗浄が行われているが,バイオマットの形成速度は速く,数ヶ月- 1 年程度で洗浄前の状況に戻ってしまうものが多い...|$|R

Additionally, two fatalities occurred when two teenage boys were riding a rubber raft, swept into a <b>drainpipe,</b> and subsequently drowned. The highest sustained wind speed recorded in Jefferson County was [...] at Sea Rim State Park, while the strongest gust was [...] at the Jack Brooks Regional Airport. Winds downed trees and limbs, while also causing minor roof damage. Tides at Sabine Pass were about [...] about mean sea level; some beach erosion was reported near that location. In Liberty County, winds felled tree limbs, which damaged vehicles and portable buildings.|$|E
500|$|After {{leaving the}} Current, Marlin and Dory are engulfed by a blue whale. Inside the whale's mouth, Marlin desperately tries to escape, while Dory {{communicates}} with the whale, which carries them to Sydney Harbour and expels them through his blowhole. They meet Nigel, and after helping the pair escape from a massive flock of seagulls, he {{takes them to}} the dentist's office. Darla has just arrived and the dentist is handing Nemo to her. Nemo plays dead to save himself as Nigel arrives, causing Darla to scream. Upon seeing Nemo, Marlin mistakenly believes he is dead, before Nigel is violently thrown out. In despair, Marlin leaves Dory and begins to swim home. Gill helps Nemo escape into a drain {{that leads to the}} ocean. Dory loses her memory and becomes confused, and meets Nemo, who reaches the ocean. Eventually, Dory's memory returns after she reads the word [...] "Sydney" [...] on a <b>drainpipe.</b> She reunites Nemo with Marlin, but she is caught in a fishing net with a school of grouper. Nemo enters the net and orders the group to swim downward to break the net, enabling them to escape. After returning home, Nemo leaves for school, with Crush's son Squirt, and Marlin and Dory proudly watch Mr. Ray carry Nemo and his friends to school. Meanwhile, back in Sydney, the high-tech filter in the dentist's fish tank breaks down, and the Tank Gang escape to Sydney Harbour, belatedly realizing that they are still confined inside their plastic bags.|$|E
500|$|Though {{previous}} Steely Dan {{projects were}} often recorded live, Fagen opted to overdub each part separately for The Nightfly. It became enormously difficult, between this approach {{and the new}} technology, to record the album. Pianist Michael Omartian [...] "objected strongly" [...] when Fagen tasked him to [...] "set the groove" [...] of the title track on his own, with nothing but a click track. On another occasion, Fagen [...] "demanded subtle timing differences between the left and right-hand piano parts" [...] on [...] "Ruby Baby". The effect he desired was achieved with Omartian and Greg Phillinganes playing together on the same keyboard. For the [...] "party noises" [...] in [...] "Ruby Baby", the team suspended a microphone from the ceiling of Studio 54 – just {{next door to the}} studio they were working – and recorded one of Jerry Rubin's 'business parties.' Unsatisfied with the results, the group instead held a party in the studio by themselves and included that ambience in the song. Larry Carlton performs lead guitar on much of the album, and recorded his pieces in four days. During his time with the group, he discovered a humming sound coming from his amplifier. The engineers discovered the source {{on the outside of the}} building: a large magnet [...] "that formed part of the New York subway system." [...] In one instance, a strange smell permeated the studio space at Soundworks. The studio staff [...] "gutted" [...] the studio, removing its air conditioning, carpeting, and recording console until they discovered the cause of the smell: a deceased rat in a <b>drainpipe.</b> Sessions often stretched long into the evening; Fagen would often refer to this as [...] "being on the night train." [...] In the end, the album took eight months to record, and was mixed in 10 days.|$|E

2500|$|A {{flush toilet}} is a toilet that disposes of human excreta (urine and feces) by using water to flush {{it through a}} <b>drainpipe</b> to another {{location}} for disposal, thus maintaining a separation between humans and their excreta. Flush toilets can be designed for sitting (in which case they are also called [...] "Western" [...] toilets) or for squatting, {{in the case of}} squat toilets. The opposite of a flush toilet is a dry toilet, which uses no water for flushing.|$|E
2500|$|The {{building}} {{was completed in}} 1740, a red brick building of seven bays and two stories. The windows are round topped on the lower floor and pedimented on the upper. The three central bays are unified under a pediment. The whole style is Palladian with some baroque influences. One feature on the principal facade shows the building's provincial pedigree, Vanbrugh or Wren would have left the facade undecorated, or the windows interspersed by pilasters: here in rural Aylesbury the architect chose to place a humble <b>drainpipe</b> symmetrically between the windows, in London plumbing was discreet or hidden. [...] The interior contained a panelled court room, and a council chamber.|$|E

50|$|Ornamental {{species of}} acacias {{are also used}} by homeowners and {{landscape}} architects for home security.

2500|$|The {{first wave}} of rockabilly fans in the United Kingdom were called Teddy Boys because they wore long, Edwardian-style frock coats, along with tight black <b>drainpipe</b> {{trousers}} and brothel creeper shoes. Another group in the 1950s that were followers of rockabilly were the Ton-Up boys, who rode British motorcycles and would later be known as [...] rockers in the early 1960s. The rockers had adopted the classic greaser look of T-shirts, jeans, and leather jackets to go with their heavily slicked pompadour haircuts. The rockers loved 1950s rock and roll artists such as Gene Vincent, and some British rockabilly fans formed bands and played {{their own version of}} the music.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the book}} the plot emerges in a {{fragmented}} way, with shifting points of view and events that seem out of order. [...] As presented, it shows Richard MacDuff avoiding his boss Gordon Way, the CEO of Wayforward Technologies II, {{by going to the}} Coleridge dinner at his old college St Cedd's. Following the annual reading of [...] "Kubla Khan" [...] and [...] "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner" [...] by Coleridge, MacDuff witnesses his former tutor, Professor Urban [...] "Reg" [...] Chronotis, perform an inexplicable magic trick where he makes a cruet disappear and then finds it again by smashing an ancient clay pot that a young girl brought to the dinner, having found it on holiday in Greece. When MacDuff and Prof. Chronotis' adjourn to the professor's lodgings, they find a horse there, which the Professor is alarmed about but unable to explain. MacDuff returns to his London flat and finds himself doing things that are out of character, including climbing a <b>drainpipe</b> to break into the flat belonging to Gordon's sister Susan to erase an embarrassing message he left on her answering machine and later named a suspect in the death of Gordon Way. At that point Dirk Gently, a self-claimed [...] "Holistic Detective" [...] that believes in the [...] "fundamental interconnectedness of all things" [...] and is currently searching for a missing cat, intervenes and sets about solving the mystery, even though MacDuff was not aware that there was one.|$|E
