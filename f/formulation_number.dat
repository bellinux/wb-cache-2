40|$|For any crop-protection agent, an {{efficient}} formulation {{is a necessity}} to translate laboratory activity into adequate field performance. There are particular challenges to be faced in formulation of biological control agents, because the active ingredient is a living organism that must be kept relatively immobile and inactive while in storage, but quickly resume its normal metabolic processes once applied to the target site. The objective of the research was to study survival of Pseudomonas putida strain Pf- 20 in various formulations at the storage time and germination. The twelve formulations include carriers, additives and concentration of Pf- 20. The efficacy of various formulation in maintaining the population of Pf- 20 in storage was assessed.

Yet the technique has its pitfalls, including the way the stories produced {{may be influenced by}} digressing from standard instructions, using different methods of interpretation, and administering the instrument cross-culturally. Psychologists presenting projection plates to adolescent clients in South Africa frequently obtain little more than one-liners from standard procedures, raising doubts about viability and reliability of the technique.

In this research we aimed {{to determine the effects of}} a dynamic assessment (DA) technique of questioning when using projection plates with adolescents in cross-cultural situations. Applying the test-mediate-retest principle of DA, the assessor explained to participants the relevance of her (strictly non-directive) verbal and non-verbal responses to their storying, as encouragement to elaborate on their responses. A multiple case-study was undertaken with three participants. Instrumentation consisted of two TAT plates and four non-standard plates, self-selected to accommodate possible cultural differences.

To reach higher corneal drug absorption and drug concentration in the posterior segments of the eye, 3 nanoliposomal formulations containing 0. 5 mg/ml cyclosporine A were prepared.

Subjects were then randomized into two groups and asked to spend between 30 and 90 minutes searching bibliographic databases for evidence to answer a real-life clinical question which was randomly allocated to them. Each member ofthe intervention group was provided with an experienced biomedical librarian to provide assistance throughout the search session. The control group received no assistance. The outcome of the search was then measured using an assessment tool adapted {{for the purpose of this}} study from the Fresno test of competence in evidence based medicine. This adapted assessment tool rated the “global success” of the search and included criteria such as appropriate question <b>formulation,</b> <b>number</b> of PICO terms translated into search terms, use of Boolean logic, use of subject headings, use of filters, use of limits, and the percentage of citations retrieved that matched a gold standard set of citations found in a prior search by two librarians (who were not involved in assisting the subjects) together with an expert clinician. Main Results – The intervention group scored a median average of 73. 6 points out of a possible 100, compared with the control group which scored 50. 4. The difference of 23. 2 points in favour of the librarian assisted group was a statistically significant result (p value = 0. 013) with a 95 % confidence interval of between 4. 8 and 33. 2.

40|$|The social {{diversity}} of the South African population holds considerable challenge for psychologists, especially in respect of differences in language, culture and socio-economic context. The implications of the diverse nature of expectations and needs of unique individuals, clients as well as professionals, in particular in psychological assessment, are of concern. Projected storytelling in assessment is widely recognised as valuable, especially when working with children and adolescents. The technique has its pitfalls, including the way the stories produced {{may be influenced by}} leading questions, applying different methods of interpretation, and administering the instrument in cross-cultural assessment situations. Psychologists presenting projection plates to adolescent clients in South Africa frequently obtain little more than one-liners from standard procedures, raising doubts about viability and reliability of the technique. Prompting and probing need to be enhanced without compromising the projective value of responses or the uniqueness of clients. Feuerstein pioneered mediated intervention for learners with cognitive barriers, and the dynamic assessment of culturally different children. In this study, a dynamic assessment technique of questioning (DATQ) was used to actualise projection potential in mono- and cross-cultural assessment situations. The aim of the study was two-fold: to investigate the influence of a DATQ with projection plates during the psychological assessment of adolescents, and to investigate the influence of culture on such assessment in mono- and cross-cultural situations. A qualitative, multiple case study of ten participants representing five language groups in South Africa was undertaken within a predominantly postmodern epistemology. The tension between assessment from the positivist and post-modern paradigms was acknowledged through applying different perspectives during different stages of the research. A test-training-continuation-of-test situation was created for the administration of seven projection pictures, after which two discussion protocols were used. Data-analysis and interpretation took place in four phases by way of projection analysis (using the Bellak TAT Analysis Blank and Haworth’s analysis of defences), structural analysis (with categories such as word-count, response pattern, <b>formulation,</b> <b>number</b> of statements, prompts, hesitations, repetitions), analysis of the participant’s experience of the Murray-method versus the dynamic assessment technique of questioning, and analysis of possible cross-cultural influences on the assessment (utilizing the Scoring Sheet for the Psychocultural Scoring System (SSPSS) and triangulating the results with the projection analysis and the thematic analysis of the conversation about culture). Findings were derived from intra-comparison (per participant) and inter-comparison (per phase of the assessment) of the analyses. The main conclusions of the study point towards participants’ projective responses increasing and deepening in the direction of self-understanding and wholesome problem solution as well as being structurally enhanced, their emotional experience of the assessment situation being positive, culturally associated values being expressed and cultural barriers to interaction being lessened in both mono- and cross-cultural assessment. Whilst projection isn’t an exclusively context-bound phenomenon and generally occurs irrespective of cultural specificity, it was found that supporting clients through non-directive prompting to voice their associations apparently didn’t interfere with the unconscious content being solicited, irrespective of the mono-/cross-cultural nature of the assessment.
