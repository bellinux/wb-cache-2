40|$|International audienceThe paper {{presents}} a pseudo bond graph {{model of a}} thermo-hydraulic system which is composed by two warm and cold water pipes, a plastic tank and an <b>evacuation</b> <b>pipe.</b> This model is designed on 20 sim software and it allows varying the temperature, inside the tank, by acting on the mass flows of the warm and cold water, {{as well as on}} the <b>evacuation</b> <b>pipe.</b> A simulation is done for constant and variable water mass flows to show the efficiency of this bond graph model...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOne {{industrial}} process used by Nexter Munitions to manufacture pyrotechnical materials consists in preparing an emulsion of wax in TNT (2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene) and adding Aluminium and ONTA (3 -nitro- 1, 2, 4 -triazole- 5 -one) particles. When the suspension is homogeneous, it {{is allowed to}} flow by gravity through a pipe located {{at the bottom of}} the tank and to fill up a shell body. The suspension is characterized by a solid volume fraction of 53. 4 %, which leads to high viscosities. In some circumstances, the emptying time is prohibitively long and the economic profitability is reduced. This study has been performed to make the emptying time lower with the constraint of unchanged volume fractions and grains mean diameter. So, we investigated the influence of the grain size distribution on the suspension viscosity. Different samples of Aluminium and ONTA have been used, with rather small differences in grain size distributions. The suspensions have been prepared in the industrial tank and the flow cast times measured. It has been observed that they differ by one order of magnitude. To avoid situations with too high emptying times, a procedure has been implemented to make prior characterization of the suspension rheology. Because of particles sedimentation and emulsion destabilisation, the classical Couette rheometer is not adapted. So, we designed and built a small size tank (113 cm 3), where the suspension is continuously stirred and kept homogeneous. The measurement of the torque and rotational speed together with the use of the Couette analogy allowed us to observe an Ostwald fluid behaviour (flow consistency index k, flow behaviour index n). To gain in prediction, we established a correlation between the measured (k, n) values and the grain size distributions. We characterized each suspension by the ratio of to, where is the solid volume fraction (imposed by the commercial specifications) and is the maximum packing fraction. Because of the strong analogy between concrete and energetic paste, we chose the widely used De Larrard model to compute. A linear dependance between the ratio and the indices k and n was observed. The second step was to provide an analytical expression for the flow cast time of a power-law suspension from a tank with a given geometry. Considering the large difference between the industrial inner tank diameter and the <b>evacuation</b> <b>pipe</b> diameter, we assumed that all the pressure drop was located in the <b>evacuation</b> <b>pipe.</b> Then, extending the Hagen-Poiseuille equation to Ostwald fluid, we were able to predict the emptying time with the knowledge of k and n. Experimental and predicted emptying time are in very good agreement. This work helped the industrial manufacturer to divide the emptying time by a factor 12...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{incidence}} of extensive roof greening {{structures in the}} contamination of roof runoff has been analysed for three families of organic micropollutants (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [PAHs], alkylphenols [APs], and bisphenol A [BPA]) by means of both laboratory leaching tests and field experiments. For PAHs, which {{do not have any}} local source on the green roof and originate only from atmospheric fallout, the green roof behaves as a sink and reduces by a factor 10 the emitted loads compared to a conventional flat roof. APs and BPA however can be emitted by the synthetic materials that constitute the roofing structure (e. g., roof sealing, drainage material, filter, <b>evacuation</b> <b>pipes).</b> Potential emissions of BPA and nonylphenol (NP) from the geotextile, the sealing membrane and PVC pipes have especially been identified. Field results confirm increased NP and octylphenol (OP) emissions in the green roof runoff. However, the concentrations and loads remain within the range of values observed for other types of urban surfaces...|$|R
50|$|A complex {{network of}} pipes was {{discovered}} in 1966, forty metres south of the paved road. The main pipe from the creek bed runs first south and then turns at a right angle to the west. The construction of the is of marked quality. Small holes were drilled in the left wall of buildings {{in the city that}} allowed for water infiltration. On the right walls were arranged small secondary channels, ensuring water <b>evacuation.</b> On one <b>pipe,</b> there is an inscription dedicating the water supply to the individual responsible for its construction.|$|R
6000|$|... 14th. Scarlet.--The {{engagement}} {{ended last}} night by the complete <b>evacuation</b> of Grierson. <b>Pipes</b> cleared {{the whole country}} about that town in splendid style, and the army encamped {{on the field of}} battle; sadly reduced indeed, but victorious for the moment. The enemy, since their first appearance at Grierson, have lost 4,400 men, and have been beaten decisively back. There is now not a man on our side of the Sandusky; and our loss of 2,600 is serious indeed, but, seeing how much has been accomplished, not excessive. The enemy's horse was cut to pieces.|$|R
