In February 2015, she created a working group led by the Office of the President of Kosovo and worked closely with national institutions and UN specialized agencies in Kosovo to improve policy performance on 20 independent and objective indicators on economic freedoms, democratic rights, control of corruption, good governance and investing in people. On 06 November 2015, the MCC announced that Kosovo has passed {{for the first time}} MCC scorecard with 13 out of 20 indicators, and improved Control of Corruption indicator with 16%, compared to previous year. At its quarterly meeting on 16 December 2015, the Millennium Challenge Corporation Board of Directors voted to make Kosovo eligible for a compact, MCC’s large-scale investment program. Following the Board’s decision on Kosovo, MCC’s CEO Dana J Hyde made a phone call to President Jahjaga to inform her about the board’s decision.|$|E

40|$|Background: HIV {{prevalence}} {{data suggest}} that {{men who have sex}} with men (MSM) in low-income and middle-income countries (LMIC) are at increased risk of HIV The aim of this article is to present global estimates on key HIV prevention needs and responses among MSM in LMIC. Methods: Data on HIV testing, HIV prevention coverage, HIV knowledge and condom use among MSM were derived from UNGASS country progress reports submitted in 2008. <b>Eligible</b> <b>country</b> estimates were used to calculate global and regional estimates, weighted for the size of MSM populations. Results: Of 147 LMIC, 45 % reported at least 1 indicator that reflects the HIV prevention needs and responses in MSM. Global weighted estimates indicate that on average 31 % of MSM in LMIC were tested for HIV; 33 % were reached by HIV prevention programs; 44 % had correct HIV knowledge; and 54 % used condoms the last time they had anal sex with a man. Conclusions: The 2008 UNGASS country reports represent the largest harmonized data set to date of HIV prevention needs and responses among MSM in LMIC. Although reporting is incomplete and does not always conform to requirements, findings confirm that, in many LMIC, HIV prevention responses in MSM need substantial strengthening...|$|E
40|$|BJECTIVES: We {{assessed}} {{the situation of}} academic publications on access to and use of medicines (ATM) in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) of the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR). We aimed to inform priority setting for research on ATM in the region. DESIGN: Bibliographic review of published studies. SETTING: LMICs in EMR. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Publications on ATM issues originating from or focusing on EMR LMICs covering the period 2000 - 2011. Publications involving multinational studies were included if at least one <b>eligible</b> <b>country</b> had {{been included in the}} study. INFORMATION SOURCES AND DATA EXTRACTION: We conducted comprehensive searches of the PubMed, Social Science Citation Index and Science Citation Index. We used the WHO ATM framework for data extraction and synthesis. We analysed the data according to the ATM issues, health system levels, year of publication and the countries of origin or focus of the studies. RESULTS: 151 articles met the inclusion criteria. Most articles (77 %) originated from LMICs in EMR, suggesting that the majority of evidence on ATM in the region is home-grown. Over 60 % of articles were from Iran, Pakistan, Jordan and Lebanon (in order of volume), while we found no studies assessing ATM in Somalia, Djibouti and South Sudan, all low-income countries. Most studies focused on the rational use of medicines, while affordability and financing received limited attention. There was a steady growth over time in the number of ATM publications in the region (r= 0. 87). CONCLUSIONS: There is a growing trend, over the years, of more studies from the region appearing in international journals. There is a need for further research on the financing and affordability aspects of ATM in the region. Cross-border issues and the roles of non-health sectors in access to medicines in the region have not been explored widely...|$|E

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), now in its fourth year of operations, provides aid to developing countries that have demonstrated a commitment to ruling justly, encouraging economic freedom, and investing in people. MCC provides monetary assistance to eligible countries through multiyear compact agreements to fund specific programs targeted at reducing poverty and stimulating economic growth. MCC has received appropriations for fiscal years 2004 to 2008 totaling more than $ 7. 5 billion, and has set aside about $ 6. 4 billion of this amount for compact assistance. The President has requested an additional $ 2. 225 billion for MCC for 2009, of which MCC plans to use $ 1. 88 billion for compact assistance with countries currently eligible for compacts. MCC compact development is a four-phase process: (1) an <b>eligible</b> <b>country</b> submits a compact proposal; (2) MCC conducts a due diligence review of the proposed projects; (3) MCC and the country negotiate and sign the compact; (4) MCC and the country complete preparations, including developing disbursement plans, for the compact to enter into force. After the compact enters into force, compact implementation begins, and funds are obligated and disbursed. As of March 2008, MCC had selected 28 countries as eligible for compact assistance and had signed compacts with 16 of these countries. Eleven of these compacts have entered into force. Ten countries have not signed compacts and remain in the compact development process. We conducted this performance audit on the initiative of the Comptroller General. This report assesses (1) the current status and pace of compact development; (2) projected time frames for the commitment and obligation of MCC's existing (2004 to 2008) and requested (2009) appropriations; and (3) MCC's progress in disbursing compact assistance. ...|$|E

MCC has received appropriations for fiscal years 2004 through 2008 totaling more than $ 7. 5 billion and has set aside about $ 6. 4 billion of this amount for compact assistance. As of August 2008, MCC had signed compacts with 18 countries totaling approximately $ 6. 3 billion; of the 18 signed compacts, 11 compacts had entered into force, obligating a total of approximately $ 3 billion. The President has requested an additional $ 2. 225 billion for MCC for fiscal year 2009, of which MCC plans to use $ 1. 88 billion for compact assistance to countries currently eligible for compacts. To develop these fact sheets, we compiled and summarized publicly available data {{from a number of}} sources, including our previous reporting on MCC. We used information from the World Bank and from Central Intelligence Agency Fact Books to provide a general overview of each country and its economy. To develop timelines of key compact events, we analyzed MCC data from its country quarterly status reports and our previous reporting. To summarize country performance on MCC selection criteria, we (1) compared World Bank data on per capita incomes with MCC's income eligibility thresholds published in its annual candidate country reports and (2) compiled country performance on MCC policy indicators from MCC's annual candidate country scorecards and <b>eligible</b> <b>country</b> reports. To summarize the compact and its project plans, we reviewed and analyzed MCC's compacts, compact summaries, and monitoring and evaluation plans. These summaries reflect the compact structure and expectations at the time of compact signature and do not incorporate any subsequent compact restructuring. Finally, to analyze compact obligations, disbursements, and commitments, we compiled public information from MCC's quarterly reports on obligations and disbursements published in the Federal Register and from MCC's quarterly country status reports. The planned disbursements we report are based on MCC's projections at compact signature and on the assumption that compact funds are disbursed evenly throughout the compact implementation year. Descriptions of any compact restructuring, included in our discussions of compact implementation, are based on MCC and compact country documents. To clarify and confirm our understanding of this information, we submitted written questions to MCC officials. ...|$|E
