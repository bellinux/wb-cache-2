A recent study revealed that different diversity levels in an ensemble of learning machines are required in order to maintain high generalisation on both old and new concepts. Inspired by this study and based on a further study of diversity with different strategies to deal with drifts, we propose a new online ensemble learning approach called Diversity for Dealing with Drifts (DDD). DDD maintains ensembles with different diversity levels and is able to attain better accuracy than other approaches. Furthermore, it is very robust, outperforming other <b>drift</b> <b>handling</b> approaches in terms of accuracy when there are false positive drift detections. In all the experimental comparisons we have carried out, DDD always performed at least as well as other <b>drift</b> <b>handling</b> approaches under various conditions, with very few exceptions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Applying {{sophisticated}} {{machine learning}} tech-niques on fully distributed data is increasingly important in many applications like distributed recommender systems or spam filters. In {{this type of}} networked environment the data model can change dynamically over time (concept drift). Iden-tifying when concept drift occurred is a key for several <b>drift</b> <b>handling</b> techniques and important in numerous scenarios. However <b>drift</b> <b>handling</b> approaches exist, no efficient solution for detecting the drift is known in very large scale networks. Here, we propose an approach that can detect the concept drift in large scale and fully distributed networks. In our approach, the learning is performed by applying online learners that take random walks in the network while updating themselves using the samples available at the nodes. The drift detection {{is based on an}} adaptive mechanism which uses the historical performances of the models. Through empirical evaluations we demonstrate that our approach <b>handles</b> the <b>drifting</b> concept while additionally detects the occurrence of the concept drift with high accuracy.

40|$|An {{increasingly}} important area in supervised incremental learning is {{learning in the}} presence of changing concepts. Research into concept drift is hampered by the lack of availability of controllable `real life 2 ̆ 7 datasets. In this paper we propose an approach for generating real life data over which we have control of the concept and can generate data exhibiting different types of concept drift. The approach uses a 3 -D driving game to produce a data stream of instances describing how to drive around a track. The classification problem is learning the driving technique of the driver, which can be affected by changes in the driving environment causing changes to the concept. The paper gives illustrations of different types of concept drift and how standard concept <b>drift</b> <b>handling</b> techniques can adapt to the concept drift...|$|R

40|$|Context: In healthcare, the {{decision}} of patient referral evolves through time because of changes in scientific developments, and clinical practices. Existing decision support systems of patient referral {{are based on the}} expert systems approach. This usually requires manual updates when changes in clinical practices occur. Automatically updating {{the decision}} support system by identifying and <b>handling</b> so-called concept <b>drift</b> improves the efficiency of healthcare systems. In the stateof-the- art, there are only specific ways of handling concept drift; developing a more generic technique which works regardless of restrictions on how slow, fast, sudden, gradual, local, global, cyclical, noisy or otherwise changes in internal distribution, is still a challenge. Objectives: An algorithm that <b>handles</b> concept <b>drift</b> in surgery prediction is investigated. Concept drift detection techniques are evaluated to find out a suitable detection technique in the context of surgery prediction. Moreover, a plausible combination of detection and handling algorithms including the proposed algorithm, Trigger Based Ensemble (TBE) +, are evaluated on hospital data. Method: Experiments are conducted to investigates the impact of concept drift on prediction performance and to reduce concept drift impact. The experiments compare three existing methods (AWE, Active Classifier, Learn++) and the proposed algorithm, Trigger Based Ensemble(TBE). Real-world dataset from orthopedics department of Belkinge hospital and other domain dataset are used in the experiment. Results: The negative impact of concept drift in surgery prediction is investigated. The relationship between temporal changes in data distribution and surgery prediction concept drift is identified. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is evaluated and compared with existing handling approaches. Conclusion: The proposed algorithm, Trigger Based Ensemble (TBE), is capable of detecting the occurrences of concept drifts and to adapt quickly to various changes. The Trigger Based Ensemble algorithm performed comparatively better or sometimes similar to the existing concept <b>drift</b> <b>handling</b> algorithms in the absence of noise. Moreover, the performance of Trigger Based Ensemble is consistent for small and large dataset. The research is of twofold contributions, in that it is improving surgery prediction performance as well as contributing one competitive concept <b>drift</b> <b>handling</b> algorithm to the area of computer science...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Concept drift is {{believed}} to be prevalent in most data gathered from naturally occurring processes and thus warrants research by the machine learning community. There are a myriad of approaches to concept <b>drift</b> <b>handling</b> which have been shown to <b>handle</b> concept <b>drift</b> with varying degrees of success. However, most approaches make the key assumption that the labelled data will be available at no labelling cost shortly after classification, an assumption which is often violated. The high labelling cost in many domains provides a strong motivation {{to reduce the number of}} labelled instances required to <b>handle</b> concept <b>drift.</b> Explicit detection approaches that do not require labelled instances to detect concept drift show great promise for achieving this. Our approach Confidence Distribution Batch Detection (CDBD) provides a signal correlated to changes in concept without using labelled data. We also show how this signal combined with a trigger and a rebuild policy can maintain classifier accuracy while using a limited amount of labelled data.

The objective {{of this study was to}} explore machine learning and web usage mining methods to produce classification models for the prediction of information resources that might be relevant in a particular infobutton context. DesignClassification models were developed and evaluated with an infobutton usage dataset. The performance of the models was measured and compared with a reference implementation in a series of experiments. MeasurementsLevel of agreement (κ) between the models and the resources that clinicians actually used in each infobutton session. ResultsThe classification models performed significantly better than the reference implementation (p<. 0001). The performance of these models tended to decrease over time, probably due to a phenomenon known as concept drift. However, the performance of the models remained stable when concept <b>drift</b> <b>handling</b> techniques were used. ConclusionsThe results suggest that classification models are a promising method for the prediction of information resources that a clinician would use to answer patient care questions...|$|R
40|$|For many tasks where data is {{collected}} {{over an extended}} period of time, its underlying distribution is likely to change. A typical example is information filtering, i. e. the adaptive classification of documents with respect to a particular user interest. The interest of the user may change over time. Machine learning approaches <b>handling</b> concept <b>drift</b> have been shown to outperform more static approaches ignoring it in experiments with different types of simulated concept drifts on real-word text data and in experiments on real-world data for the task of classifying phases in business cycles exhibiting real concept drift. While previous concept <b>drift</b> <b>handling</b> approaches only use a single base learning algorithm and employ this same base learner at each step in time, this paper proposes a metalearning approach allowing the use of alternative learners and automatically selecting the most promising base learner at each step in time. This work in progress investigates, if such a contextdependent selection of the base learner leads to a better adaptation to the drifting concept, i. e. to lower classification error rates, than approaches based on single base learner only. Furthermore it investigates, how much the proposed metalearning approach allows to speed up the selection process and how much of the gained reduction in the error rate may be lost by that speed-up...|$|R

This method is aimed for concept <b>drift</b> <b>handling.</b> We enhanced the CNN as convolutional hiererchical features representation learner combined with Elastic ELM (E$^ 2 $LM) as a parallel supervised classifier. We propose an Adaptive OS-ELM (AOS-ELM) for concept drift adaptability in classifier level (named ACNNELM- 1) and matrices concatenation ensembles for concept drift adaptability in ensemble level (named ACNNELM- 2). Our proposed Adaptive CNNELM is flexible that works well in classifier level and ensemble level while most current methods only proposed to work on either one of the levels. We verified our method in extended MNIST data set and not MNIST data set. We set the experiment to simulate virtual drift, real drift, and hybrid drift event and we demonstrated how our CNNELM adaptability works. Our proposed method works well and gives better accuracy, computation scalability, and concept drifts adaptability compared to the regular ELM and CNN. Further researches are still required to study the optimum parameters and to use more varied image data set. Comment: Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man and Cybernetics: Systems.
