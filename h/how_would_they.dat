5|$|The game's setting {{stemmed from}} the idea of players being able to create and control a group of obedient creatures. The Shapers and the world of Geneforge were the result of Vogel imagining how would a being possess such power and <b>how</b> <b>would</b> <b>they</b> use it. The game's setting, a mixture of science fiction and fantasy, differs from the pure science fiction setting the game had been envisioned as. Vogel had {{difficulties}} balancing gameplay with the powerful directed-energy weapons players would expect to use in a science fiction game. Sales exceeded the developer's expectations, despite fears that the departure from Spiderweb's Avernum series would deter players. Geneforge received a positive reception from reviewers, despite the quality of the graphics being rated as poor and the game containing one piece of music, the title theme. The plot and setting were praised by reviewers for uniqueness and detail.|$|E
500|$|Hoxha's {{strategy}} of [...] "people's war" [...] also caused friction with the Albanian armed forces. The bunkers had little military value {{compared with a}} conventionally equipped and organised professional army. As one commentator has put it, [...] "How long could one man in each bunker hold out? How would you resupply each individual bunker? <b>How</b> <b>would</b> <b>they</b> communicate with each other?" [...] General Beqir Balluku, the Defence Minister {{and a member of}} the Politburo, publicly criticised the bunker system in a 1974 speech and disputed Hoxha's line that Albania was under equal threat from the United States and the Soviet Union. He argued that Albania needed a modern, well-equipped professional army rather than a poorly trained and equipped civilian militia. Hoxha responded by having Ballaku arrested, accusing him of being an agent of the Chinese and of working to bring about a military coup. Dubbed [...] "the arch-traitor Ballaku", the general and his associates were convicted and punished according to [...] "the laws of the dictatorship of the proletariat" [...] – meaning that they were executed.|$|E
2500|$|Travis Fickett of IGN {{opined that}} series creator Josh Friedman had {{apparently}} devoted {{a lot of}} time to imagining the technical aspects of Terminators when this episode touched on such questions as [...] "If [...] were badly damaged and lost their skin [...] <b>how</b> <b>would</b> <b>they</b> continue their mission?" [...] and [...] "If a terminator completed its mission, would it just go into standby?" [...] Fickett also explicitly extolled the special effects in [...] "Heavy Metal", especially as spectacle has been a hallmark of the Terminator films.|$|E

2500|$|In 1887, Olmsted and Calvert Vaux {{issued a}} {{supplemental}} report detailing plans {{to restore the}} falls. Their intent was [...] "to restore and conserve the natural surroundings of the Falls of Niagara, rather than to attempt to add anything thereto," [...] and the report anticipated fundamental questions. How would preservationists provide access without destroying {{the beauty of the}} falls? <b>How</b> <b>would</b> <b>they</b> restore natural landscapes damaged by man? They planned a park with scenic roadways, paths and a few shelters designed to protect the landscape while allowing large numbers of visitors to enjoy the falls. Commemorative statues, shops, restaurants, and a 1959 glass and metal observation tower were added later. Preservationists continue to strive {{to strike a balance between}} Olmsted's idyllic vision and the realities of administering a popular scenic attraction.|$|E
2500|$|Danny Rubin had {{completed}} and sold his script for Hear No Evil and moved from Chicago to Los Angeles {{to become a}} professional screenwriter around 1990. His agent suggested that he prepare a [...] "calling-card" [...] script that he could use to gain meetings with various producers. He {{came up with the}} core idea of the script which would become Groundhog Day while sitting in a movie theater. He had asked himself the question [...] "If a person could live forever, if a person was immortal, <b>how</b> <b>would</b> <b>they</b> change over time?" [...] Having this character be immortal and having the world change around them would have been too cumbersome for filming. Instead he came back to a concept he had written down about two years earlier about a man living the same day over and over. With the idea of a person changing over time, this repeating day motif had found its [...] "deeper purpose" [...] within the new script. The two ideas, combined, answered his proverbial question as well as opened up several possibilities of drama and comedy with that framework.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order for}} the EMH defence to make sense, [...] would {{have to show that}} [...] small number of investors that beat the market in the long-run are not doing so because they are skilled but rather that they are lucky. <b>How</b> <b>would</b> <b>they</b> show this? Frankly, it is {{impossible}} to prove either way. But it strikes me as a very silly argument. We could just as easily apply it to [...] poker players. We could say [...] "Oh, they are not really skilled, they are just lucky. They are just a statistical anomaly." [...] Moving on from this, we could say this about anything and everything. We could say this about professional football players, master chefs and seminal guitar players. None of these people, by EMH logic, should be seen as skilled. Rather, they are just getting lucky over and over again. The professional football players are just getting lucky every time they play well; the master chef is getting lucky every time he cooks a fabulous meal; and the seminal guitar player is just fortunate that his hands move {{in the way that they}} do. At this point, the reader will appreciate the vacuity of the EMH argument.|$|E

2500|$|Qizhou {{was a major}} {{fortress}} city situated {{near the}} Yangtze and a 25 thousand strong Jin army advanced on it in 1221. News of the approaching army reached Zhao Yurong in Qizhou, and despite being outnumbered nearly eight to one, he decided to hold the city. Qizhou's arsenal consisted of some three thousand thunderclap bombs, twenty thousand [...] "great leather bombs" [...] (皮大炮), and thousands of gunpowder arrows and gunpowder crossbow bolts. While the formula for gunpowder had become potent enough to consider the Song bombs to be true explosives, {{they were unable to}} match the explosive power of the Jin iron bombs. Yurong describes the uneven exchange thus, [...] "The barbaric enemy attacked the Northwest Tower with an unceasing flow of catapult projectiles from thirteen catapults. Each catapult shot was followed by an iron fire bomb , whose sound was like thunder. That day, the city soldiers in facing the catapult shots showed great courage as they maneuvered [...] catapults, hindered by injuries from the iron fire bombs. Their heads, their eyes, their cheeks were exploded to bits, and only one half [...] was left." [...] Jin artillerists were able to successfully target the command center itself: [...] "The enemy fired off catapult stones ... nonstop day and night, and the magistrate's headquarters [...] at the eastern gate, as well as my own quarters ..., were hit by the most iron fire bombs, {{to the point that they}} struck even on top of [...] sleeping quarters and [...] nearly perished! Some said there was a traitor. If not, <b>how</b> <b>would</b> <b>they</b> have known the way to strike at both of these places?" [...] Zhao was able to examine the new iron bombs himself and described thus, [...] "In shape they are like gourds, but with a small mouth. They are made with pig iron, about two inches thick, and they cause the city's walls to shake." [...] Houses were blown apart, towers battered, and defenders blasted from their placements. Within four weeks all four gates were under heavy bombardment. Finally the Jin made a frontal assault on the walls and scaled them, after which followed a merciless hunt for soldiers, officers, and officials of every level. Zhao managed an escape by clambering over the battlement and making a hasty retreat across the river, but his family remained in the city. Upon returning at a later date to search the ruins, he found that the [...] "bones and skeletons were so mixed up that there was no way to tell who was who." ...|$|E
