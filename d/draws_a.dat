5|$|In July 2016, Disney XD {{announced}} that it had greenlit a put pilot titled Right Hand Guy, which is in consideration for a full series. The show stars a pre-teen who <b>draws</b> <b>a</b> face on his right hand that comes to life and befriends him. The creator, Dan Lagana, took inspiration from Oobi while developing the concept.|$|E
5|$|The {{first step}} is to mark two {{arbitrary}} points of the plane (which will eventually become vertices of the triangle), and use the compass to draw a circle centered at one of the marked points, through the other marked point. Next, one <b>draws</b> <b>a</b> second circle, of the same radius, centered at the other marked point and passing through the first marked point.|$|E
5|$|A {{station model}} is a {{symbolic}} illustration showing the weather occurring at a given reporting station. Meteorologists created the station model to plot a number of weather elements in a small space on weather maps. Maps filled with dense station-model plots {{can be difficult to}} read, but they allow meteorologists, pilots, and mariners to see important weather patterns. A computer <b>draws</b> <b>a</b> station model for each observation location. The station model is primarily used on surface-weather maps, but {{can also be used to}} show the weather aloft. A completed station-model map allows users to analyze patterns in air pressure, temperature, wind, cloud cover, and precipitation.|$|E

5|$|After {{finding out}} that Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith) was flashed in the parking lot, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) opens an investigation. He orders Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) to {{interview}} Phyllis and make a sketch of the flasher. However, Phyllis says she didn't {{get a good look}} at him, so Pam instead <b>draws</b> <b>a</b> picture of Dwight with a mustache and without glasses. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) assists (who also seems to notice that the sketch looks similar to Dwight) an oblivious Dwight in posting fliers with Pam's sketch on it around town.|$|E
5|$|After {{purchasing}} a drum set and acquiring a piano from Joey's mother, Jimmy secures {{the remainder of}} the band's musical equipment from Duffy, a black market dealer. The band rehearses on the second floor above a snooker hall, and after much practice, they convince a local church community centre to give them a gig, under the pretence of it being an anti-heroin campaign. Jimmy then hires Mickah Wallace, a hot-tempered bouncer, to act as the band's security. The band <b>draws</b> <b>a</b> good crowd, but after Deco inadvertently hits Derek with his microphone stand, the amplifiers explode, resulting in a power outage.|$|E
5|$|At George Washington University, a {{group of}} artists sketch a nude male model. However, one of the artists, John Mostow (Levani Outchaneichvili), <b>draws</b> <b>a</b> demonic {{creature}} in the model's place; while using a utility knife to sharpen his pencil he cuts his hand trying and smears the blood on his drawing. When the model reaches his car after the session, he is attacked and killed by an obscured assailant. The following morning, Mostow is arrested in his apartment by an FBI task force led by Agent Bill Patterson (Kurtwood Smith), who finds the utility knife used in the murder covered in blood.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the prizes}} {{are exactly the}} same, it follows that you will prefer Gamble A to Gamble B {{if and only if}} you believe that <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> red ball is more likely than <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> black ball (according to {{expected}} utility theory). Also, there would be no clear preference between the choices if you thought that a red ball was as likely as a black ball. Similarly it follows that you will prefer Gamble C to Gamble D if, and only if, you believe that <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> red or yellow ball is more likely than <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> black or yellow ball. It might seem intuitive that, if <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> red ball is more likely than <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> black ball, then <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> red or yellow ball is also more likely than <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> black or yellow ball. So, supposing you prefer Gamble A to Gamble B, it follows that you will also prefer Gamble C to Gamble D. And, supposing instead that you prefer Gamble B to Gamble A, it follows that you will also prefer Gamble D to Gamble C.|$|R

5|$|Blek is a 2013 puzzle {{video game}} for iOS and Android by Kunabi Brother, {{a team of}} {{brothers}} Denis and Davor Mikan. The player <b>draws</b> <b>a</b> snakelike black line that recurs in pattern and velocity across the screen to remove colored dots and avoid black dots. It is minimalist in design, features excerpts of Erin Gee, and takes inspiration from Golan Levin, the Bauhaus, and Japanese calligraphy. The brothers designed the game as a touchscreen adaptation to classic game Snake and worked on the game for over six months. It was released in December 2013 for iPad, and was later released for other iOS devices and Android.|$|E

5|$|In a {{study of}} 19th-century warfare, {{historian}} James Reid posits that Anderson suffered from delusional paranoia, which exacerbated his aggressive, sadistic personality. He sees Anderson as obsessed with, and greatly enjoying, the ability to inflict fear and suffering in his victims, and suggests he suffered from the most severe type of sadistic personality disorder. Reid <b>draws</b> <b>a</b> parallel between the bashi-bazouks and Anderson's group, arguing that they behaved similarly.|$|E

5|$|Luton Town {{supporters}} {{maintain a}} bitter rivalry with Hertfordshire-based Watford. Watford have remained the higher ranked {{team at the}} end of every season since 1997. However, overall Luton still hold the superior record in the fixture between the two clubs; out of 118 competitive matches there have been 53 Luton victories and 36 for Watford, with 29 <b>draws.</b> <b>A</b> survey taken in 2003 showed that there was also animosity between Luton Town fans and those of west London club Queens Park Rangers.|$|E

50|$|If two {{cards are}} drawn with {{replacement}} from {{a deck of}} cards, the event of <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> red card on the first trial and that of <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> red card on the second trial are independent. By contrast, if two cards are drawn without replacement from a deck of cards, the event of <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> red card on the first trial and that of <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> red card on the second trial are not independent, because a deck that has had a red card removed has proportionately fewer red cards.|$|R
50|$|For example, it is {{impossible}} to <b>draw</b> <b>a</b> card that is both red and a club because clubs are always black. If just one card is drawn from the deck, either a red card (heart or diamond) or a black card (club or spade) will be <b>drawn.</b> When <b>A</b> and B are mutually exclusive, P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B). To find the probability of <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> red card or a club, for example, add together the probability of <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> red card and the probability of <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> club. In a standard 52-card deck, there are twenty-six red cards and thirteen clubs: 26/52 + 13/52 = 39/52 or 3/4.|$|R

5|$|After Marwan's 732 expedition, {{a period}} of quiet set in. Marwan was {{replaced}} as governor of Armenia and Adharbayjan in spring 733 by Sa'id al-Harashi, but he undertook no campaigns at all until 735, when he lost his sight and resigned. Marwan was then re-appointed to the post, but he too was unable to launch anything but local expeditions until 737: three fortresses near the Darial Pass and the ruler of a North Caucasian principality, Tuman Shah, were captured in 735, while another local prince, Wartanis, was defeated and killed in 736. Blankinship attributes this inactivity to the exhaustion of the Arab armies and <b>draws</b> <b>a</b> parallel with the contemporaneous quiet phase in Transoxiana in 732–734, where the Arabs had also suffered a series of costly defeats {{at the hands of}} Turkic nomads. In addition, Agapius and Michael the Syrian record that the Arabs and the Khazars concluded peace, information which Muslim sources ignore or downplay to a tactical ruse by Marwan designed to gain time for his preparations.|$|E
5|$|Aslam and Khan confront {{one another}} as the police, having been alerted to Khan's {{location}} by a storekeeper, descend upon Dongri. Shoaib rains down blows and insults upon Aslam, urging him to defend {{himself in front of}} Jasmine. Nevertheless, Aslam, who still feels indebted and bound to Khan, does not fight back until Inspector Awant appears through the gathered crowd - even then, Aslam only pushes Khan away so that Khan is not shot by the officer. Reacting quickly, Khan <b>draws</b> <b>a</b> pistol of his own and shoots Awant before turning his weapon on Jasmine and Aslam. Jasmine, through tears and while holding a bleeding Aslam, tells Khan that he is truly evil and will never have her love. Khan seems to recognize the truth in her words as he drops his weapon and stares at the couple. Just then, more police officers arrive on the scene and open fire on Khan, who, now injured, is dragged away by one of his henchmen. He and Aslam, both alive but bloodied, lock eyes and reach out for another, having finally put aside their differences.|$|E
