5|$|Having {{left his}} command to General Belliard on 8 March, three days later, Nansouty {{was a part}} of a convoy of several officers, heading to Paris. On the road to the capital, they were {{attacked}} by a pulk of Cossacks, which managed to disperse the convoy's escort. Nansouty and his officers fought their way out sabre in hand and made a run for it towards the river Aisne. Reaching the riverbanks, the General got isolated and, as he was preparing to cross the river on horseback, his horse was shot under him, throwing the General to the ground. Nevertheless, <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> swam to the other bank of the river and safety. This event, as well as his tireless activity during the campaign, seem to suggest that his health was not the main reason of his departure from the army. It is also unlikely that the Emperor himself decided to replace him, given Belliard's tentative approach at the Battle of Craonne and this General's subsequent provisional status as commander, after Nansouty's departure. It is thus more likely that Nansouty resigned, following his disputes with the Emperor.|$|E

25|$|Ted Dexter {{elected to}} {{lead from the}} front.

25|$|He {{always got}} my {{attention}} when <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> took the microphone.

25|$|Chesney {{started his}} Poets and Pirates Tour on April 26, 2008 at Williams-Brice Stadium in Columbia, South Carolina. During the {{introduction}} of his set, his boot got caught between a hydraulic lift and {{the lip of the}} stage surface, which crushed his foot and produced a severe hematoma from the ankle down, with most of the damage centering within his toes. It took approximately 30seconds to pry his foot loose as he squatted down on the stage while the band continued to play an extended introduction of the song. When Chesney finally freed himself, <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> kept holding his hand on his knee as he began singing.|$|E
25|$|Immediately on our {{coming up}} out of the water after we had been baptized, we {{experienced}} great and glorious blessings from our Heavenly Father. No sooner had I baptized Oliver Cowdery, than the Holy Ghost fell upon him, and <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> prophesied many things which should shortly come to pass. And again, so soon as I had been baptized by him, I also had the spirit of prophecy, when, standing up, I prophesied concerning the rise of this Church, and many other things connected with the Church, and this generation of the children of men. We were filled with the Holy Ghost, and rejoiced in the God of our salvation.|$|E
25|$|On 20 August, while sailing off Cordovan, two sails {{were spotted}} in the distance. Thinking {{them to be}} a ship {{of the line and}} a frigate, Cunningham sailed closer, at which the two ships began to sail away in {{opposite}} directions. Cunningham immediately gave chase, pursuing the largest one, {{which turned out to be}} the 36-gun frigate Vestale. The Clyde brought her to battle and after an engagement of an hour forced her to strike her colours. The Vestale had lost 10 killed and 22 wounded to two killed and three wounded on the Clyde. In the meantime the other French ship, the 28-gun Sagasse had taken the opportunity to escape into port. News of the victory was communicated to shore. King George III was in the theatre when news reached him. <b>He</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> directed the news be communicated to the audience. There was applause and Rule Britannia! was played.|$|E

25|$|With the {{exception}} of the Oregon militia, who claimed to be stopped by a ravine, Green's force began to move to the north along the shore. The California volunteers, 21st Infantry, and F Troop advanced behind the Stronghold, and were within 50 yards (50 m) north of the Stronghold when they were pinned down on the shore by overwhelming Modoc fire. Major Green was wounded when <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> urged his men forward, an act for which he later received the Medal of Honor. F Troop and half the 21st Infantry eventually made it to Bernard's force, {{but the rest of the}} Infantry and the California volunteers were pinned down along the lake shore and were ordered to remain in place until dark. At 5 pm, Colonel Wheaton realized he had failed to capture the Stronghold, and signaled Green and Bernard to retreat. The forces withdrew to their camps, a process that was not completed until after nightfall on January 18. The US soldiers the Modoc had killed were left on the battlefield, which provided the Modoc with additional rifles and ammunition.|$|E

2500|$|During the battle, Saigō {{was badly}} {{injured in the}} hip. [...] However, the exact manner of his death is unknown. The {{accounts}} of his subordinates claim either that <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> committed seppuku after his injury or that he requested that the comrade Beppu Shinsuke assist his suicide. In debate, some scholars have suggested that neither is the case and that Saigō may have gone into shock following his wound, losing his ability to speak. Several comrades, upon seeing him in this state, would have severed his head, assisting him in the warrior's suicide they knew he would have wished. Later, they {{would have said that}} he committed seppuku to preserve his status as a true samurai.|$|E
2500|$|Over 100 African-American pastors {{boycotted the}} 30-year {{tradition}} of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Interfaith Breakfast, hosted by Chicago's mayor. Rev. Matthew Ross did attend the breakfast, but he interrupted the proceedings when <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> began to chant “16 shots and a cover-up.” The day after Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, about 200 Black Youth Project 100 Chicago Chapter members, dressed in black T-shirts with the words [...] "Fund Black Futures" [...] written across them, blocked {{the entrance of the}} Chicago Patrolmen's Federal Credit Union in an effort to protest the Fraternal Order of Police's advocacy of the Chicago police department.

The woman teases him and when he finally finds her, she wipes the sand off his face and they walk away together. Meanwhile, the Busters sit in a row elsewhere on the beach.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Slope {{was startled}} and horrified, {{but he felt}} that he could not answer. How could <b>he</b> <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> preach the lessons of his Master, being there, as he was, on the devil's business? He was a true believer, {{otherwise}} this would have been nothing to him. He had audacity for most things, but he had not audacity to make a plaything of the Lord's word. All this the signora understood, and felt much interest as she saw her cockchafer whirl round upon her pin.|$|R

He started to disagree when they began discussing Scripture. Eventually, after waiting for the other participants to begin praying, <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> pulled a gun from a fanny pack, aiming it at 87-year-old Susie Jackson. Jackson's nephew, 26-year-old Tywanza Sanders, tried to talk him down and asked him why he was attacking churchgoers. The shooter responded, [...] "I have to do it. You rape our women and you're taking over our country. And you have to go." [...] When he expressed his intention to shoot everyone, Sanders dove in front of Jackson and was shot first. The suspect then shot the other victims, all the while shouting racial epithets. He also reportedly said, [...] "Y'all want something to pray about? I'll give you something to pray about." [...] He reloaded his gun five times. Sanders' mother and his five-year-old niece, both attending the study, survived the shooting by pretending to be dead.|$|E
