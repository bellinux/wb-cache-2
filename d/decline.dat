5|$|Under the Kingdom, Sicily's {{products}} went to {{many different}} lands. Among these were Genoa, Pisa, the Byzantine Empire, and Egypt. Over {{the course of}} the 12th century, Sicily became an important source of raw materials for north Italian cities such as Genoa. As the centuries went on, however, this economic relationship became less advantageous to Sicily, and some modern scholars see the relationship as frankly exploitative. Furthermore, many scholars believe that Sicily went into <b>decline</b> in the late Middle Ages, though they are not agreed on when this <b>decline</b> occurred. Clifford Backman argues that {{it is a mistake to}} see the economic history of Sicily in terms of victimization, and contends that the <b>decline</b> really began in the second part of the reign of Frederick III, in contrast to earlier scholars who believed that Sicilian <b>decline</b> had set in earlier. Where earlier scholars saw late medieval Sicily in continuous <b>decline,</b> Stephen Epstein argued that Sicilian society experienced something of a revival in the 15th century.|$|E
5|$|A {{study by}} the National Audubon Society has found that populations of some the most common birds in North America have {{plummeted}} since 1967, with some species showing a <b>decline</b> of 80 percent. The {{study also found that}} California species were particularly affected, with population declines of 75 to 96 percent for several species, including the northern pintail, horned lark and loggerhead shrike. The <b>decline</b> may be due to loss of habitat to urban sprawl, especially grasslands, forests and wetlands, energy development and industrialized agriculture. Climate change could compound losses in the future.|$|E

Overall life expectancy at age 75 increased by 8. 7 percent. Among males, however, the increase was 13. 6 percent; and among females, 6. 1 percent. Improvements in life expectancy resulted from <b>declines</b> in mortality, and these <b>declines</b> exhibited different patterns for different sexes, causes of death, and time periods.
