We argue that the European gas pipelines are a monopolistic bottleneck that require some form of access regulation, e. g. {{in the form of}} an <b>Entry-Exit</b> <b>System.</b> We discuss how regulation should be implemented at the European level and, subsequently, in Germany.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedAfter {{the terrorist attacks}} on September 11, 2001, the desire of Americans to feel secure made ethnic and religious profiling a tempting security trade-off. Generalizations about Arabs and Muslims as terrorists seemed to lead to an increasing practice of singling out individuals who look Arab or appear to be Muslim in <b>entry-exit</b> <b>systems</b> and in counterterrorist investigations. Civil liberties and Muslim advocacy groups immediately cried foul as accusations of profiling began to surface in the media and various government reports. Today, the main emphasis of the debate continues to focus on civil liberties. The aim of this thesis is to take a fresh perspective on profiling in counterterrorist-operations and demonstrate that profiling is actually counterproductive to an effective long-term counterterrorism strategy. This thesis first highlights major findings on the usefulness of racial profiling in criminal policing. It then examines issues of ethnic identity and the grand strategy of Islamic terrorist organizations and illustrates the counterproductive nature of ethnic and religious profiling. It will also demonstrate that while complaints of ethnic profiling persist within the Muslim community, the technique {{does not appear to have}} played a role in the disruption of actual terrorist plots in the United States.

40|$|While the European Union {{is about}} to take {{far-reaching}} decisions on the best way to ensure the security of its external border, there is a strong tendency to take guidance from the United States, the world’s undisputed forerunner in employing advanced technology and strict control procedures. Besides highlighting the weaknesses of the current EU approach against the background of the almost accomplished US system, the briefing undertakes to analyse to what extent exclusive transatlantic inspiration is the right way to follow for European policymakers. It carefully examines US experience gained since the late 1990 s in setting up a watertight <b>entry-exit</b> <b>system,</b> in particular the reasons why, despite all efforts made and resources spent, the project did not yet yield a completely satisfactory outcome. It also argues that even such advanced models can never be considered “one size fit all”-solutions, transferable to other regions with paying attention to their political, geographic and other specificities – and, above all, one should not overestimate technology as a problem-solver. Besides taking inspiration from outside, the European Union should also consider alternativ...|$|E
40|$|Under an entry-exit gas tariff system, {{reservation}} {{of capacity}} is split into entry capacity, to transport {{gas from the}} injection points to a virtual balancing point, and exit capacity, to transport gas from the balancing point to the exit points in the system. Entry-exit tariff for gas transport systems have been recommended by the 3 rd EU Energy Package, since they are cost reflective, facilitate gas trade and can provide signals for the location of gas injections or off-takes. The advisability of applying an entry-exit tariff system is discussed in this paper. Apart from this, authors propose an entry-exit tariff model {{and apply it to}} compute charges for the Spanish gas transport system in 2009. Results produced by the model are presented as coefficients which should multiply the current postal transport tariff. The paper concludes that entry-exit tariffs would be useful location signals which would result in a better use of the gas transport system in Spain. In those cases where demand exceeds available capacity, as it occurs at the congested connection with France, entry-exit tariffs could be supplemented by capacity charges at entry points resulting from auctions.

40|$|Since the {{promulgation}} of the Third Energy Package by the European Commission, relevant {{efforts have}} taken place to harmonize country-level regulatory frameworks and constitute the Single natural gas market. One of the main changes is the ownership unbundling of transmission assets, {{the creation of an}} Independent System Operator and the adoption of an <b>entry-exit</b> <b>system</b> for third party access. Within this new regulatory framework, shippers that are in charge of conveying gas from producers to consumers must contract capacity and operate in gas facilities. This paper develops an optimization model to analyze shippers behavior in entry-exit markets, which can be used equally by shippers, independent system and facility operators, and regulatory authorities. The model has been applied to an actual gas market, like the Iberian natural gas market. Results indicate that different optimal contracting and operation behaviors take place in gas facilities. Moreover, after a market efficiency examination, the paper proposes regulatory measures that would support the objectives of the European Commission (competition, security of supply and sustainability) such as the merger of balancing zones and the constitution of competitive balancing and secondary capacity markets. info:eu-repo/semantics/draf...|$|E
40|$|Recent work on borders {{has tended}} to {{overlook}} border control actors, practices and rationalities in West Africa. States in this region are considered origin and transit countries for irregular migration, and the Sahel region that they straddle is widely seen as an emerging haven of terrorist activity. This article discusses one response to these migration and terrorism threats by the Islamic Republic of Mauritania: a programmme to build new border posts with help from global partners that include the European Union and the International Organization for Migration. The article builds on Bourdieusian approaches in critical security studies, but draws on concepts from actor-network theory {{to account for the}} heterogeneity of border control actors and the mobility of different knowledges about how to control borders. Drawing on ethnographic research in Mauritania, the article discusses four 'actants' of border security: the border posts, the landscape, the biometric <b>entry-exit</b> <b>system</b> and training practices. Throughout, the article highlights field dynamics of competition, cooperation and pedagogy, also emphasizing the role of non-human agency.

40|$|Background: Although {{there have}} been many studies on aging in a number of {{developed}} countries, data on the effects of aging during early senescence are scarce. We designed a study to investigate an age-specific cohort in a suburban Japanese city to determine the factors that contribute to living long and well. Methods: In every year from 1996 through 2005, residents of Nissin City, Japan who were about to reach the age of 65 years participated in health check-ups and completed a baseline self-administered questionnaire that included items on demographic and lifestyle characteristics, physical function, and quality of life. When the participants reached 70 years of age, they underwent secondary health check-ups at the same site, or received home visits from public health nurses, and their health-related outcomes were noted. Results: A total of 3073 64 -year-olds were enrolled in the study (response rate, 43. 9 %). There was considerable intersexual variation in demographic and lifestyle factors. Among men and women, 24. 3 % and 3. 0 % were current smokers, respectively, and 68. 7 % and 19. 5 % were current alcohol drinkers. Cohort members were in slightly better physical condition than the Japanese general population: they {{were less likely to be}} obese and hypertensive and more likely to have 20 teeth or more. Follow-up of the cohort is ongoing. Conclusions: We have established a unique age-specific cohort with a consecutive <b>entry–exit</b> <b>system.</b> This project should provide data on early changes in health and related factors in this new era of longevity.

According to CNN and the Los Angeles Times, the architects behind the order, were Stephen Miller and Steve Bannon. White House officials deny that it was written without input from the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel (OLC). It was argued that these 7 countries ranked among the lowest 15 out of the 104 countries evaluated by the Henley & Partners Visa Restrictions Index in 2016 based on the [...] "number of countries that their citizens can travel to visa-free." [...] For example, Germany ranks the highest at 177 points, Afghanistan the lowest of all 104 at 25.
