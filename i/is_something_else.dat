500|$|To {{continue}} the tradition, the organization produces 20,500 white towels with the Canucks logo for each playoff game. [...] Following his first playoff game in 2007 Vancouver forward Alex Burrows stated [...] "It {{looks like the}} fans are really into {{the game and the}} atmosphere out there <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>else,</b> people are really passionate instead of just sitting and no one moving or anything like some places. It just creates movement and it seems like there is more enthusiasm and intensity in the building." [...] As part of their 40th season celebration the Canucks organization commissioned a permanent statue of Nielson. Standing over 11 feet tall and weighing over 800 pounds the bronze statue depicts Nielson's mock surrender which started towel power.|$|E

500|$|To {{find out}} why the curse failed, the Queen turns to Rumpelstiltskin (Carlyle), the {{original}} owner of the curse. Rumpelstiltskin offers to help the Queen if, in turn, she makes him a wealthy and respected person {{in the new world}} and promises that she will do anything he asks so long as he says [...] "please." [...] The Queen agrees, reminding him that in the new world, they would have no recollection of their agreement. Rumpelstiltskin then tells the Queen that she must cut out the heart of the thing she loves the most and use it to complete the spell. The Queen protests that what she loved most died because of Snow White, but Rumpelstiltskin suggests that there <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>else</b> the Queen also loves. He also tells the Queen that he has informed Snow White and Prince Charming that their unborn daughter will be able to break the Queen's curse.|$|E

[...] There are {{no known}} {{instances}} in which Lincoln tried to suppress knowledge or discussion of such arrangements, and in some conversations, raised the subject himself. Tripp discusses three men at length and possible sustained relationships: Joshua Speed, William Greene, and Charles Derickson. However, in 19th-century America, it was not necessarily uncommon for men to bunk-up with other men, briefly, if no other arrangement were available. [...] For example, when other lawyers and judges travelled [...] "the circuit" [...] with Lincoln, the lawyers often slept [...] "two in a bed and eight in a room". William H. Herndon recalled for example, [...] "I have slept with 20 men in the same room". But a private and sustained relationship with a single individual in one bed <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>else.</b>|$|E

2500|$|As Wright philosophized of {{this period}} some thirty years later, 'Having a witness among the poor and having a {{ministry}} to the poor is one thing, but making the poor folks members of your congregation <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>else</b> altogether." [...] Wright further explained, [...] "Failure to have the black poor {{at the table with}} you as equals means you are doing missionary work," [...] while having [...] "poor black folks" [...] who [...] "sit down at the table as equals" [...] means you are [...] "serious about talking or doing [...] black theology." [...] As Speller explains, Trinity's congregants [...] "began to slowly move away from the concept of church as a place to enhance and validate their social position to one that appreciated the church as a place for spiritual formation." [...] In sum, Trinity began to more fully move away from its earlier purpose surrounding [...] "middle-classness" [...] to one where devotion to God and the poor took much greater prominence.|$|E

2500|$|I am {{told that}} the more you rehearse, the better you play. This is wrong. We often try to reduce the {{unforeseen}} to a controllable level, to prevent a sudden impulse that escapes our ability to control, yet also responds to an obscure desire. Let's allow improvisation to have its place and play its role. I think that the true interpreter {{is the one who}} improvises. We have mechanized the art of conducting to an awful degree, in the quest of perfection rather than of dream [...] As soon as rubato is obtained and calculated scientifically, it ceases to be true. Music making <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>else</b> than searching to achieve an accomplishment. But striving to attain it is beautiful. Some of Michelangelo's sculptures are perfect, others are just outlined and the latter ones move me more than the first perfect ones because here I find the essence of desire, of the wakening dream. That's what really moves me: fixing without freezing in cement, allowing chance its opportunity.|$|E
2500|$|A {{distinction}} is often {{made between the}} [...] "weak" [...] and the [...] "strong" [...] versions of legal pluralism. The [...] "weak" [...] version does not necessarily question the main assumptions of [...] "legal centralism", but only recognises that within {{the domain of the}} Western state law other legal systems, such as customary or Islamic law, may also have an autonomous (co-)existence. Thus, the [...] "weak" [...] version does not consider other forms of normative ordering as law. As Tamanaha, one of the critics of legal pluralism, puts it: [...] "Normative ordering is, well, normative ordering. Law <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>else,</b> something that we isolate out and call law…". The [...] "strong" [...] version, on the other hand, rejects all legal centralist and formalist models of law, as [...] "a myth, an ideal, a claim, an illusion," [...] regarding state law as one among many forms of law or forms of social ordering. It insists that modern law is plural, that it is private as well as public, but most importantly [...] "the national (public official) legal system is often a secondary rather than the primary locus of regulation".|$|E
2500|$|Wordsworth {{returns to}} the ideas found within the {{complete}} ode many times in his later works. There is also a strong connection between the ode and Wordsworth's Ode to Duty, completed {{at the same time}} in 1804. The poems describe Wordsworth's assessment of his poetry and contains reflections on conversations held between Wordsworth and Coleridge on poetry and philosophy. The basis of the Ode to Duty states that love and happiness are important to life, but there <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>else</b> necessary to connect an individual to nature, affirming the narrator's loyalty to a benevolent divine presence in the world. However, Wordsworth was never satisfied with the result of Ode to Duty as he was with Ode: Intimations on Immortality. In terms of use of light as a central image, the ode is related to Peele Castle, but the light in the latter poem is seen as an illusion and stands in opposition to the ode's ideas. In an 1809 essay as part of his Essays upon Epitaphs for Coleridge's journal, The Friend, Wordsworth argued that people have intimations that there is an immortal aspect of their life and that without such feelings that joy could not be felt in the world. The argument and the ideas are similar to many of the statements in the ode along with those in The Prelude, Tintern Abbey, and [...] "We Are Seven". He would also return directly to the ode in his 1817 poem Composed upon an Evening of Extraordinary Splendor and Beauty where he evaluates his own evolving life and poetic works while discussing the loss of an early vision of the world's joys. In the Ode: Intimations on Immortality, Wordsworth concluded that he gives thanks that was able to gain even though he lost his vision of the joy in the world, but in the later work he tones down his emphasis on the gain and provides only a muted thanks for what remains of his ability to see the glory in the world.|$|E
