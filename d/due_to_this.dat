5|$|As farmers {{worldwide}} {{respond to}} higher crop prices {{in order to}} maintain the global food supply-and-demand balance, pristine lands are cleared to replace the food crops that were diverted elsewhere to biofuels' production. Because natural lands, such as rainforests and grasslands, store carbon in their soil and biomass as plants grow each year, clearance of wilderness for new farms translates to a net increase in greenhouse gas emissions. <b>Due</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> change in the carbon stock of the soil and the biomass, indirect land use change has consequences in the GHG balance of a biofuel.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{broadcasting}} for {{the season}} began, Duchovny sued Fox and eventually announced his decision to leave the show. As a result, the season {{would be the last}} to feature Duchovny in a full-time capacity until Season 10, although he would return in seasons 8 and 9 as an intermittent main character. <b>Due</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> eventual character change, this season would be the last to feature the original opening sequence for the series, as the two later years updated the intro in an attempt to renew and revive the series.|$|E

In 2006 the partnership stood at 25 with over 1400 employees and 14 offices. <b>Due</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> growth {{and the addition of}} so many different services, the company was restructured in 2003 to consist of multi-disciplinary teams of engineers, each with structural, mechanical and electrical engineers supported by specialist consulting groups.|$|E
5|$|Combined {{hormonal}} contraceptives {{are associated}} with a slightly increased risk of venous and arterial blood clots. Venous clots, on average, increase from 2.8 to 9.8 per 10,000 women years which is still less than that associated with pregnancy. <b>Due</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> risk, they are not recommended in women over 35years of age who continue to smoke. Due to the increased risk they are included in decision tools such as the DASH score and PERC rule used to predict the risk of blood clots.|$|E

The rest follow from extension by linearity, and the representation of the group is obtained by exponentiation.|$|E

5|$|Early in production, Warner Bros. {{decided to}} release Phantasm as a {{theatrical}} release, rather than straight to video.

5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Bennett {{noted that the}} two major morphs of pteranodont present in the Niobrara Formation were {{precisely}} separated in time with little, if any, overlap. <b>Due</b> <b>to</b> <b>this,</b> and to their gross overall similarity, he suggested that they probably represent chronospecies within a single evolutionary lineage lasting about 4 million years. In other words, only one species of Pteranodon would have been present at any one time, and P. sternbergi (or Geosternbergia) in all likelihood was the direct ancestor species of P. longiceps.|$|E
5|$|It does so by {{preventing}} {{the formation of}} the initiation complex, composed of the 30S and 50S subunits of the ribosome, tRNA, and mRNA.
