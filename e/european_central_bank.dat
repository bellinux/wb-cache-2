50|$|Quantitative easing, and {{monetary}} policy in general, {{can only be}} carried out if the <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> controls the currency used in the country.

As a result of this vote, Greece's finance minister Yanis Varoufakis stepped down on 6 July.

5|$|The European {{debt crisis}} (often also {{referred}} to as the Eurozone crisis or the European sovereign debt crisis) is a multi-year debt crisis that has been taking place in the European Union since the end of 2009. Several eurozone member states (Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Spain and Cyprus) were unable to repay or refinance their government debt or to bail out over-indebted banks under their national supervision without the assistance of third parties like other Eurozone countries, the <b>European</b> <b>Central</b> <b>Bank</b> (ECB), or the International Monetary Fund (IMF).|$|E
5|$|The {{institutions}} of the European Union are the seven principal decision making bodies of the European Union (EU).

5|$|As of June 2012, {{current issues}} {{do not reflect}} the {{expansion}} of the European Union, as Cyprus is not depicted on current notes as the map does not extend far enough east and Malta is also missing as it does not meet the current series' minimum size for depiction. Since the <b>European</b> <b>Central</b> <b>Bank</b> plans to redesign the notes every seven or eight years after each issue, a second series of banknotes is already in preparation. New production and anti-counterfeiting techniques will be employed on the new notes, but the design will be of the same theme and colours identical of the current series; bridges and arches. However, they would still be recognisable as a new series.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze the <b>European</b> System of <b>Central</b> <b>Banks</b> (ESCB) {{as a federal}} <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> system. First, the degree of {{decentralization}} of the ESCB will be briefly compared with its predecessor, the Deutsche Bundesbank, and its counterweight in the US, the Federal Reserve System. Moreover, the development during the period 1990 - 99 of the total, economics and research staffing of the ECB and the national <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> in the EU will be investigated and also the staff ratios of the national <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> in 1999. Furthermore, the research activities of the <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> in the <b>European</b> Union over the period 1990 - 99 will be analyzed {{both in terms of}} input (economics and research staff) and output (quality-weighted number of articles in scientific journals). The share of economics research staff in total staff of the national <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> varies between 0. 02 and 0. 17. The ECB has the highest ratio between economists and researchers and other staff. A ranking of research performance based on the quality-weighted number of scientific articles per economics and research employee reveals that the Bank of Finland has the best research performance of <b>European</b> <b>central</b> <b>banks,</b> followed by De Nederlandsche Bank, the Banco de Portugal and the Oesterreichische Nationalbank. There is only a weak relationship between the research performance and the share of research staff. The conclusion "small is beautiful" also seems to hold for the economics and research departments of the <b>European</b> <b>central</b> <b>banks.</b> ...|$|R
