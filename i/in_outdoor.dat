5|$|Plastics, such as {{polyethylene}} naphthalate (PEN), can {{be protected}} by applying zinc oxide coating. The coating reduces the diffusion of oxygen with PEN. Zinc oxide layers {{can also be used}} on polycarbonate (PC) <b>in</b> <b>outdoor</b> applications. The coating protects PC from solar radiation and decreases the oxidation rate and photo-yellowing of PC.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{atmospheric}} {{mercury contamination}} <b>in</b> <b>outdoor</b> urban air was measured at 0.01–0.02µg/m3. A 2001 study measured mercury levels in 12 indoor sites chosen {{to represent a}} cross-section of building types, locations and ages in the New York area. This study found mercury concentrations significantly elevated over outdoor concentrations, at a range of 0.0065 – 0.523 μg/m3. The average was 0.069 μg/m3.|$|E

40|$|Engagement <b>in</b> nature-based <b>outdoor</b> {{activities}} can promote youth wellbeing and physiological and psychological health. Youth are partaking in fewer nature-based experiences, {{and efforts to}} promote participation <b>in</b> nature-based, <b>outdoor</b> experiences often neglect family involvement, an essential element in positive youth development. This qualitative study of parents of youth ages 10 - 15 investigated caregiver perceptions of the constraints to participation <b>in</b> nature-based, <b>outdoor</b> experiences. Analysis of semi-structured interviews found that parents identified intrapersonal, interpersonal, and structural constraints to participation <b>in</b> nature-based, <b>outdoor</b> experiences. While exploratory in nature, {{results of this study}} could be used by recreation managers to improve family-inclusive outdoor recreation experiences...|$|R
5|$|To achieve these, Boy Scouting applies eight {{methods of}} Scouting: Ideals (viz., the Scout Oath, the Scout Law, the Scout Motto, and the Scout Slogan), the patrol method, {{participation}} <b>in</b> <b>outdoor</b> programs, advancement, adult association, personal growth, leadership development, and the uniform.|$|E
5|$|Cannon {{recovered}} from the sea are often extensively damaged from exposure to salt water; because of this, electrolytic reduction treatment is required to forestall the process of corrosion. The cannon is then washed in deionized water to remove the electrolyte, and is treated in tannic acid, which prevents further rust and gives the metal a bluish-black colour. After this process, cannons on display may be protected from oxygen and moisture by a wax sealant. A coat of polyurethane may also be painted over the wax sealant, to prevent the wax-coated cannon from attracting dust <b>in</b> <b>outdoor</b> displays.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{financial}} crises, {{it took more}} than one and a half years for Gopalakrishnan to finish the film. Swayamvaram {{was one of the first}} Malayalam films to use synchronised sound and to be filmed <b>in</b> <b>outdoor</b> locales, for which Gopalakrishnan used his Nagra audio recorder. The film was shot in two schedules. It was delayed due to scheduling conflicts of the lead actress, Sharada. She was working in several films at that time, so Gopalakrishnan had to arrange the schedule to suit her convenience. The lead actor, Madhu, mentioned in an interview that Gopalakrishnan was clear about his characters and their behaviour. Gopalakrishnan also used to discuss the shoot with his crew before the shooting.|$|E

She was also named a 2012 Woman of Distinction from the Girl Scouts of Western Washington, and {{that same year}} was awarded the Woodrow Wilson Center's Award for Public Service. That same year, the Mountains to Sound Greenway Trust named Jewell to its hall of fame for 21 years of leadership with Greenway Trust, encouraging people to participate <b>in</b> <b>outdoor</b> activities. The University of Washington honored Jewell with its 2016 Alumni Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2017, the Teton Science Schools, a Wyoming-based non-profit, awarded her the Murie Spirit of Conservation Award recognizing a lifetime achievement in conservation through civil discourse.|$|E
5|$|Newly hatched Aylesbury ducklings are timid {{and thrive}} best in small groups, so the duckers would divide them into {{groups of three}} or four ducklings, each {{accompanied}} by a hen. As the ducklings grew older and gained confidence, they would be kept in groups of around 30. Originally the ducks would be kept in every room in the ducker's cottage, but {{towards the end of the}} 19thcentury they were kept <b>in</b> <b>outdoor</b> pens and sheds with suitable protection against cold weather.|$|E
5|$|Retailers, {{sporting}} goods makers, {{and other businesses}} benefit from extra afternoon sunlight, as it induces customers to shop and to participate <b>in</b> <b>outdoor</b> afternoon sports. In 1984, Fortune magazine estimated that a seven-week extension of DST would yield an additional $30million for 7-Eleven stores, and the National Golf Foundation estimated the extension would increase golf industry revenues $200million to $300million. A 1999 study estimated that DST increases the revenue of the European Union's leisure sector by about 3%.|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} for composing air temperature field <b>in</b> an <b>outdoor</b> space is explained with new concepts. Here, all heat factors <b>in</b> the <b>outdoor</b> space are treated simply as real or virtual heat sources and sinks. The technique of numerical simulation {{is used to}} derive those new concepts. The scales for assessing the contribution of each heat source or sink to air temperature distribution <b>in</b> the <b>outdoor</b> space as CRO (Contribution Ratio of Outdoor Climate) 1, 2, 3 and 3. 5. These scales quantitatively indicate the capacity of one single heat source <b>in</b> the <b>outdoor</b> space for diffusion and how much that heat source will raise the temperature {{at a point in}} question. The scales are applied to assessment of outdoor thermal environment...|$|R

5|$|The video {{begins with}} a {{monologue}} given by fashion model Agyness Deyn. Scenes of Rihanna with her romantic interest (Dudley O'Shaughnessy) in both love and hate scenarios intersperse, as they experience mounting difficulties in their relationship. After enduring the overwhelming effects of recreational drugs and physical violence, she finds her boyfriend unconscious {{on the floor of}} his apartment, and leaves him, having had enough of the relationship. Images of the song's producer and featured artist Calvin Harris appear <b>in</b> <b>outdoor</b> DJ scenes, while the video has regular references to popular culture, such as themes of films and content of other singers' videos.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{infectious}} diseases {{of humans and}} other animals can be transmitted by ticks, the species of tick involved tending to be those with a wide host range. Spread of disease {{in this way is}} enhanced by the extended time during which a tick remains attached, during which time the mobile host can be carried long distances, {{or in the case of}} bird hosts, across the sea. The infective agents can be present not only in the adult tick but also in the eggs produced plentifully by the females. Many tick species have extended their ranges as a result of the movements of people, their pets and livestock. With increasing participation <b>in</b> <b>outdoor</b> activities such as wilderness hikes, more people and their dogs may find themselves exposed to attack.|$|E
5|$|Hunters {{primarily}} {{attack the}} player by bracing themselves and firing bursts from their flechette cannon. Four flechettes can vaporize an ordinary human soldier. If {{they do not}} strike a living target, the flechette charge up for several seconds and then explode, dealing minor damage to everything nearby. Hunters may also conduct a charging attack or strike with their legs if the player gets too close. Hunters are vulnerable to all weapons, but to compensate, are still quite resilient, making explosives and the pulse rifle's charged energy ball the most attractive options. Objects thrown with the gravity gun are also effective, especially if the player catches some of their flechettes with the object before hurling it (one of the in-game Achievements). <b>In</b> <b>outdoor</b> environments, they can be run over with a vehicle.|$|E

5|$|There was {{a slight}} delay in {{the start of the}} game as some of the glass needed to be fixed. Once the game was under way it took just 1:50 before the Crunch's Jon Mirasty and the Senators' Jeremy Yablonski engaged in the first fight <b>in</b> <b>Outdoor</b> Classic history. Mirasty had {{previously}} stated {{that he was going to}} be involved in the first outdoor fight. The physical play continued and minutes later at the 3:29 mark Paul Baier and Mike Radja were given matching roughing minor penalties. Not long after the matching minors Mike Blunden made a pass to Alexandre Picard to send him on a breakaway. Picard became the first player to score in an Outdoor Classic when he beat Senators' goaltender Mike Brodeur putting the Crunch up 1–0. The score remained the same at the end of a penalty-filled first period. Eight total penalties were called on the two clubs through the first 20 minutes of the game.|$|E
