5|$|The Austrian School of {{economics}} began with Carl Menger's 1871 Principles of Economics. Menger's followers formed a distinct group of economists until around the World War II when {{the distinction between}} Austrian economics and other schools of thought had largely broken down. The Austrian tradition survived as a distinct school, however, through the works of Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek. Present-day Austrians are distinguished by their interest in earlier Austrian works and abstention from standard empirical methodology including econometrics. Austrians also focus on market processes instead of equilibrium. Mainstream <b>economists</b> <b>are</b> generally critical of its methodology.|$|E
25|$|Some {{ecological}} economists prioritise adding {{natural capital}} {{to the typical}} capital asset analysis of land, labor, and financial capital. These ecological economists then use tools from mathematical economics as in mainstream economics, but may apply them more closely to the natural world. Whereas mainstream economists tend to be technological optimists, ecological <b>economists</b> <b>are</b> inclined to be technological sceptics. They reason that the natural world has a limited carrying capacity and that its resources may run out. Since destruction of important environmental resources could be practically irreversible and catastrophic, ecological <b>economists</b> <b>are</b> inclined to justify cautionary measures based on the precautionary principle.|$|E
25|$|Contemporary {{economics}} uses mathematics. Economists draw on {{the tools}} of calculus, linear algebra, statistics, game theory, and computer science. Professional <b>economists</b> <b>are</b> expected {{to be familiar with}} these tools, while a minority specialize in econometrics and mathematical methods.|$|E

25|$|Traditional <b>economists</b> <b>are</b> also {{skeptical of}} the {{experimental}} and survey-based techniques which behavioral economics uses extensively.

25|$|By 1952, as {{the funding}} ended, {{the economy of}} every {{participant}} state had surpassed pre-war levels; for all Marshall Plan recipients, output in 1951 was at least 35% higher than in 1938. Over the next two decades, Western Europe enjoyed unprecedented growth and prosperity, but <b>economists</b> <b>are</b> not sure what proportion was due directly to the ERP, what proportion indirectly, and how much would have happened without it.|$|E
25|$|Rabin dismisses these criticisms, {{claiming}} that consistent results are typically obtained in multiple situations and geographies and can produce good theoretical insight. Behavioral economists have also responded to these criticisms {{by focusing on}} field studies rather than lab experiments. Some economists see a fundamental schism between experimental economics and behavioral economics, but prominent behavioral and experimental economists tend to share techniques and approaches in answering common questions. For example, behavioral <b>economists</b> <b>are</b> investigating neuroeconomics, which is entirely experimental and cannot yet be verified in the field.|$|E
25|$|There {{is ongoing}} {{debate about whether}} central banks should target zero {{inflation}} (which would mean a constant value for the U.S. dollar over time) or low, stable inflation (which would mean a continuously but slowly declining {{value of the dollar}} over time, as is the case now). Although some <b>economists</b> <b>are</b> in favor of a zero inflation policy and therefore a constant value for the U.S. dollar, others contend that such a policy limits the ability of the central bank to control interest rates and stimulate the economy when needed.|$|E

25|$|Ecological {{economics}} generally {{rejects the}} view of energy economics that growth in the energy supply is related directly to well being, focusing instead on biodiversity and creativity - or natural capital and individual capital, in the terminology sometimes adopted to describe these economically. In practice, ecological economics focuses primarily on the key issues of uneconomic growth and quality of life. Ecological <b>economists</b> <b>are</b> inclined to acknowledge {{that much of what}} is important in human well-being is not analyzable from a strictly economic standpoint and suggests an interdisciplinary approach combining social and natural sciences as a means to address this.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately, most {{historians and}} <b>economists</b> <b>are</b> {{conditioned}} {{to believe that}} steadily and sharply falling prices must result in depression: hence their amazement at the obvious prosperity and economic growth during this era. For they have overlooked {{the fact that in}} the natural course of events, when government and the banking system do not increase the money supply very rapidly, freemarket capitalism will result in an increase of production and economic growth so great as to swamp the increase of money supply. Prices will fall, and the consequences will be not depression or stagnation, but prosperity (since costs are falling, too), economic growth, and the spread of the increased living standard to all the consumers.|$|E
500|$|Feminist economists {{suggest that}} both the content and {{teaching}} style of economics courses would benefit from certain changes.

500|$|Many <b>economists</b> <b>are</b> sceptical {{about the}} {{economic}} benefits of hosting the Olympic Games, emphasising that such [...] "mega-events" [...] often have large costs while yielding relatively few tangible benefits in the long run. Conversely hosting (or even bidding for) the Olympics appears to increase the host country's exports, as the host or candidate country sends a signal about trade openness when bidding to host the Games. Moreover, research suggests that hosting the Summer Olympics has a strong {{positive effect on the}} philanthropic contributions of corporations headquartered in the host city, which seems to benefit the local nonprofit sector. This positive effect begins in the years leading up to the Games and might persist for several years afterwards, although not permanently. This finding suggests that hosting the Olympics might create opportunities for cities to influence local corporations in ways that benefit the local nonprofit sector and civil society.|$|E
2500|$|Supply-side {{economics}} {{is a school}} of macroeconomic thought that argues that overall economic well-being is maximized by lowering the barriers to producing goods and services (the [...] "Supply Side" [...] of the economy). By lowering such barriers, consumers are thought to benefit from a greater supply {{of goods and services}} at lower prices. Typical supply-side policy would advocate generally lower income tax and capital gains tax rates (to increase the supply of labor and capital), smaller government and a lower regulatory burden on enterprises (to lower costs). Although tax policy is often mentioned in relation to supply-side economics, supply-side <b>economists</b> <b>are</b> concerned with all impediments to the supply of goods and services and not just taxation.|$|E
2500|$|First, in any {{significant}} economic slump, all economic indicators of output production, market sales, investment and employment are down, not just average profitability. If (for example) sales are down, it is logical that profit income will be down as well, {{but this does}} not mean automatically that lower profitability causes the downturn in sales. It all depends on how exactly [...] "macro" [...] and [...] "micro" [...] trends are related. Post-Keynesian <b>economists</b> <b>are</b> apt to point out that, whether people are buying or not, matters a great deal to the overall functioning of the economy, and matters a great deal to overall profitability. The most common fault in economic analysis is that short-term trends are confused with long-term trends, and this is often what the controversy between Marxists and Keynesians is about.|$|E

2500|$|The {{period from}} 1890 to 1910 {{was one of}} rapid {{economic}} growth of above 4%, {{in part due to}} rapid population growth. However, a sharp break in the growth rate to around 2.8% occurred from 1910 to 1929. [...] <b>Economists</b> <b>are</b> uncertain what combination of supply and demand factors caused the break, but productivity growth was strong, enabling the labor cost per unit of output to decline from 1910 to 1929. [...] The growth rate in hours worked fell 57% compared to the decline in the growth rate of output of 27%. [...] It is generally accepted that the new technologies and more efficient business methods permanently shifted the supply and demand relationship for labor, with labor being in surplus (except during both world wars when the economy was engaged in war-time production and millions of men served in the armed forces.) [...] The technologies that became widespread after 1910, such as electrification, internal powered transportation and mass production, were capital saving. Total non-residential fixed business fell after 1910 due to the fall of investment in structures.|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{million of}} inhabitants"--that is {{the crux of}} the problem. Labour is as {{necessary}} as water for the raising of crops; Sir William's barrages and canals without hands to turn them to account would be a dead loss instead of a profitable investment; but from what reservoir of population is this man-power to be introduced?
