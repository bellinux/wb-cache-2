40|$|This study {{examines}} Granger causality among exports, <b>domestic</b> demand, <b>and</b> {{economic growth in}} China using time-series data over the period from 1978 to 2002.

The results show bidirectional Granger causality among these variables, namely exports, <b>domestic</b> demand, <b>and</b> economic growth. Thus, there is a dynamic relationship among exports, <b>domestic</b> demand, <b>and</b> economic growth. Exports <b>and</b> <b>domestic</b> demand are both important for economic growth in China. Moreover, economic growth in China {{has an impact on}} its exports <b>and</b> <b>domestic</b> demand. A successful and sustained economic growth requires growth in both exports <b>and</b> <b>domestic</b> demand. Copyright (C) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. ...|$|R
