5|$|Most of {{the series}} {{consists}} of original content featuring new as well as established characters, but the second season is mostly based on the plots of Sonic Adventure and Sonic Adventure 2. While traditionally animated, it includes non-outlined CGI <b>elements</b> <b>for</b> things such as Sonic's homing attack.|$|E

Therefore, we assume that positive values of ti and Tj represent taxes for raw materials and final products; similarly, the negative values of ti and Tj denote subsidies for raw materials and final products, respectively. Consequently, if the value of tariff is positive, it works as a profit <b>element</b> <b>for</b> government and a cost <b>element</b> <b>for</b> GSC members; on the other hand, if the value of tariff is negative, {{it would be a}} cost <b>element</b> <b>for</b> government and a profit <b>element</b> <b>for</b> GSC members.|$|R

5|$|At the convention, Hoffman has {{replaced}} the heating <b>elements</b> <b>for</b> the chafing-dishes with his own. Olivia and Peter struggle with locating Hoffman before Walter and Astrid (Jasika Nicole) arrive. Walter uses a fogger to distribute his own chemical agent, this time specific to Hoffman, and soon the man is found dying. As the team regroups, Walter fully admits to killing Hoffman, a crime in itself, but Broyles (Lance Reddick) decides to let Walter go. Later, Peter {{has been able to}} recover the rest of his grandfather's work and returns it to Walter; Walter then goes through the files, finding an old photo of his father and Hoffman working together.|$|E
5|$|Electronegativity is the {{tendency}} of an atom to attract electrons. An atom's electronegativity is affected by both its atomic number and {{the distance between the}} valence electrons and the nucleus. The higher its electronegativity, the more an element attracts electrons. It was first proposed by Linus Pauling in 1932. In general, electronegativity increases on passing from left to right along a period, and decreases on descending a group. Hence, fluorine is the most electronegative of the elements, while caesium is the least, at least of those <b>elements</b> <b>for</b> which substantial data is available.|$|E
5|$|Foundational <b>elements</b> <b>for</b> a student's {{learning}} {{were having}} a concept of (principally diatonic) scales as music and a basis for harmony. One of the teaching tools often used by Tristano, including for scales, was the metronome. The student set the metronome at or near its slowest setting initially, and gradually increased its speed, allowing a sense of time to develop, along with confidence in placing each note.|$|E
2500|$|A bounded lattice is an {{algebraic}} {{structure of}} the form [...] such that [...] is a lattice, 0 (the lattice's bottom) is the identity <b>element</b> <b>for</b> the join operation ∨, and 1 (the lattice's top) is the identity <b>element</b> <b>for</b> the meet operation ∧.|$|R
25|$|Identity elements: The numbers {{zero and}} one are {{abstracted}} {{to give the}} notion of an identity <b>element</b> <b>for</b> an operation. Zero is the identity <b>element</b> <b>for</b> addition and one is the identity <b>element</b> <b>for</b> multiplication. For a general binary operator ∗ the identity element e must satisfy a ∗ e = a and e ∗ a = a, and is necessarily unique, if it exists. This holds for addition as a + 0 = a and 0 + a = a and multiplication a × 1 = a and 1 × a = a. Not all sets and operator combinations have an identity element; for example, the set of positive natural numbers (1, 2, 3,...) has no identity <b>element</b> <b>for</b> addition.|$|R
50|$|The {{key feature}} {{here is that}} the paths form a basis for the root {{operators}} like that of a monomial representation: when a root operator is applied to the basis <b>element</b> <b>for</b> a path, the result is either 0 or the basis <b>element</b> <b>for</b> another path.|$|R
5|$|Once {{the first}} series had aired {{and it was}} {{realised}} that the overall approach was working well, the creative team built on and significantly expanded {{the scope of the}} comedy <b>elements</b> <b>for</b> the second. This trend continued through each subsequent series. The net result was a show that immediately appealed to young children while also gaining the increasing respect—and viewership—of older audiences.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{organized}} {{as a part}} of the 95th Infantry Division for World War I, the brigade never saw combat in that conflict. Kept active and in the reserve through much of the 20th century, the brigade in name was reorganized into a different unit for fighting during World War II. Seeing numerous moves, activations and deactivations, the brigade has been used principally as a training unit for most of its existence. Reactivated again in 2006, the brigade is now primarily responsible for training provincial reconstruction teams and their supporting <b>elements</b> <b>for</b> deployment to the War in Afghanistan.|$|E

5|$|The architects {{sought to}} create an approachable {{building}} that reflected {{the role of the}} PUB as a public supplier of gas and electricity, and this led them to choose strong horizontal <b>elements</b> <b>for</b> the design. In the building's façade, this is achieved with distinctive rows of vertical fins, staggered so as to emphasise horizontal movement; these fins also provide shade. A secondary horizontal pattern results from grouping two or more rows of these fins in blocks.|$|E
5|$|The user {{interface}} and menus {{were created by}} Joe Kowalski, who had previously worked on similar game <b>elements</b> <b>for</b> Guitar Hero, Guitar Hero II, and the Rock Band series. Much of the game's interface elements used a medieval woodcut art style, and were designed to contrast well against the world's graphics. The introductory menu is presented as an interactive movie created from live action clips of Jack Black manipulating a prop gatefold vinyl record album, using Adobe After Effects to provide the on-screen text, controls handling, and stitching of separate scenes into a seamless movie.|$|E
5|$|To date, the {{excavation}} project at Fort Tanjong Katong has ended {{and only the}} south-eastern bastion, which was nearly fully excavated, has been cordoned off indefinitely (the south-western bastion was left untouched). Except for the cordoned off bastion, other exposed fort remains were reburied again in December 2005 by the National Parks Board, which runs the park, to protect them against the <b>elements</b> <b>for</b> future archaeologists to discover. It was also done because the dug-out pits could well breed mosquitoes; there were also fears that someone might {{fall into one of}} the 2 m-deep holes. The remaining funds, about S$150,000, were ploughed back into bursaries and scholarships for the constituency's students.|$|E

5|$|When Wright left Raymond {{set up his}} own office, he advertised {{himself as}} a {{specialist}} in reinforced concrete. He was aware of its textural properties from Cass Gilbert, its structural ones from Wright, and its benefits in relation to earthquake proofing. His first major independent project in 1921 was to design Hoshi Pharmaceutical School, {{which was one of}} the first reinforced concrete buildings in Tokyo. Raymond used precast concrete to form decorative <b>elements</b> <b>for</b> the building, such as window mullions. In a partially successful experiment, he used wooden formwork to imprint a texture onto the concrete (but he chose to cover it up).|$|E
5|$|At Nintendo CEO Hiroshi Yamauchi's request, Game Boy creator Gunpei Yokoi's Nintendo R {{developed}} a Mario game {{to sell the}} new console. It was the first portable version of Mario {{and the first to}} be made without Mario creator and Yokoi protégé Shigeru Miyamoto. Accordingly, the development team shrunk Mario gameplay <b>elements</b> <b>for</b> the device and used some elements inconsistently from the series. Super Mario Land was expected to showcase the console until Nintendo of America bundled Tetris with new Game Boys. The game launched alongside the Game Boy first in Japan (April 1989) and later worldwide. Super Mario Land was later rereleased for the Nintendo 3DS via Virtual Console in 2011 again as a launch title, which featured some tweaks to the game's presentation.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{structure}} of the SYNOP code, a maximum of three cloud symbols can be plotted for each reporting station that appears on the weather map. All cloud types are coded and transmitted by trained observers then plotted on maps as low, middle, or high-étage using special symbols for each major cloud type. Any cloud type with significant vertical extent that can occupy more than one étage is coded as low (cumulus and cumulonimbus) or middle (nimbostratus) depending on the altitude level or étage where it normally initially forms aside from any vertical growth that takes place. The symbol used on the map for each of these étages at a particular observation time is for the genus, species, variety, mutation, or cloud motion that is considered most important according to criteria set out by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). If these <b>elements</b> <b>for</b> any étage at the time of observation are deemed to be of equal importance, then the type which is predominant in amount is coded by the observer and plotted on the weather map using the appropriate symbol. Special weather maps in aviation show areas of icing and turbulence.|$|E

Osato humours Bond, but after their meeting he orders his secretary, Helga Brandt, to have him killed. Outside the building, assassins open fire on Bond before Aki rescues him again. Bond and Aki drive to Kobe, where the Ning-Po is docked. They investigate the company's dock facilities and discover that the ship was delivering <b>elements</b> <b>for</b> rocket fuel. They are discovered, but Bond eludes the henchmen until Aki gets away; however, Bond is captured and knocked out. He wakes, tied up in SPECTRE operative Helga Brandt's cabin on the Ning-Po. In a sexy cocktail dress, she interrogates Bond, but he thinks of managing to bribe his way to freedom when she suddenly chooses to enjoy herself by kissing and freeing him {{in order to have}} sex. Brandt then flies Bond to Tokyo, but en route she sets off a flare in the plane and bails out, finally persuaded to kill him. Bond manages to land the plane.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of his debut album Brown Sugar (1995), D'Angelo went into a four and a half year absence from the music scene and {{releasing}} solo work. His debut album presented a musical fusion of traditional soul and R influences with hip hop vocal and production elements, serving as fundamental <b>elements</b> <b>for</b> the neo soul sound. With its single-oriented success, Brown Sugar earned considerable sales success and defied the contemporary, producer-driven sound of the time, while earning popularity among mature R audiences and the growing hip hop generation. Prior to its release, neo soul itself was undefined by a major artist or musical work, and was developing during the early 1990s through the work of artists such as Tony! Toni! Toné!, Me'Shell NdegéOcello, and Omar. The album also earned D'Angelo recognition for producing a commercial breakthrough for the genre and giving notice to other neo soul artists, including Erykah Badu, Lauryn Hill, and Maxwell.|$|E
