500|$|Schirra's post-flight report {{noted the}} [...] "fireflies" [...] {{seen on the}} {{previous}} two missions, and emphasized the remarkable visual effect of the thick band of the atmosphere visible around the horizon. However, he was unimpressed with the view of Earth from space; the amount of detail <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> compared well with that from high-flying aircraft, and he told debriefers that it was [...] "nothing new" [...] compared to flight at [...] Overall, he concluded that Sigma 7 was on [...] "the top of the list" [...] of aircraft he had flown, displacing the F8F Bearcat, a naval piston-engined fighter, while the mission itself had been [...] "textbook".|$|E
2500|$|The Coroner said, {{so far as}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out,</b> {{there was}} nothing wrong with the machine or the piloting. It {{appeared}} to be a pure accident. He recorded a verdict of [...] "Death from injuries received through the sudden accidental fall of a flying boat." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{finally being}} released, Kurnaz write {{a memoir of}} his years at Guantanamo, which was {{published}} in German in 2007 and in English the following year. The following sections contain mostly material from his account. He said that he was chained to the floor of an aircraft with other prisoners and kicked and beaten by US soldiers during a flight to Kandahar. Upon his arrival, although his head was covered with a sack, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> soldiers filming and photographing them. Later the US released such photos to the media as [...] "evidence" [...] of his capture in the Afghanistan war zone—although Kurnaz and all the prisoners had just been flown in from Pakistan.|$|E
60|$|The {{second mate}} hum'd and ha'd, but Bill was afeard to go any 'igher. So far as <b>'e</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> from Jimmy, the {{mattress}} was worth about eighteen pence--to anybody who wasn't pertiklar.|$|R
60|$|The {{second mate}} hum’d and ha’d, but Bill was afeard to go any ’igher. So far as <b>’e</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> from Jimmy, the {{mattress}} was worth about eighteen pence—to anybody who wasn’t pertiklar.|$|R
60|$|Seeing that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> nothing <b>out</b> of me, he relapsed into silence.|$|R
60|$|He did so, {{and it was}} {{not long}} before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> the {{approaching}} craft quite clearly.|$|E
60|$|A little midshipman, named Midgley, {{differed}} from both, {{and said it}} was a large dhow, for <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> the top of its lateen sail.|$|E
60|$|As they {{ascended the}} steep hill on whose brow the chateau stood, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> {{that there were}} a number of men posted upon the walls.|$|E
60|$|Ephraim {{looked at}} the paper, but his eyes swam, and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> only <b>make</b> <b>out</b> a dancing, bronze seal.|$|R
6000|$|She smiled, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>make</b> <b>out</b> whether uneasily or not. [...] "It sounds rather creepy, doesn't it? But it's very interesting." ...|$|R
60|$|Again James {{looked at}} her; <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>make</b> <b>out</b> the {{expression}} on her face. She looked almost as if she were going to cry, and yet....|$|R
60|$|Dick {{stooped to}} the window and looked in. The little cell was low and dark, but <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> the wounded soldier lying moaning on his pallet.|$|E
60|$|But {{he warned}} the police at Honolulu that, by all <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out,</b> Kalamake and Keola had been coining false money, {{and it would}} not be amiss to watch them.|$|E
60|$|One morning Boduoc, who {{had gone}} up early to {{the summit of the}} crag, brought down the news that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> two columns of smoke rising from the hill over Rhegium.|$|E
60|$|It was mortifying that he {{had been}} forced to prepare such a phrase as that. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> not <b>make</b> <b>out</b> why she filled him with such embarrassment.|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>could</b> not <b>make</b> <b>out</b> {{whether she}} was {{laughing}} at him. He sat, {{not knowing what to}} say, and he blurted out, [...] "Do you mean that you won't?" ...|$|R
60|$|Which was which <b>he</b> <b>could</b> never <b>make</b> <b>out,</b> Despite {{his best}} endeavour. Of THAT {{there is no}} manner of doubt - No probable, {{possible}} shadow of doubt - No possible doubt whatever.|$|R
60|$|Uncle Pullet sat by {{and listened}} with {{twinkling}} eyes to these high matters. He didn't understand politics himself,--thought {{they were a}} natural gift,--but by what <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out,</b> this Duke of Wellington was no better than he should be.|$|E
60|$|It {{was indeed}} some four {{hours before the}} knight on the lookout cried that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> three dark specks on the horizon. Gervaise at once ascended to the lookout, by the ladder that was fixed against the post.|$|E
60|$|He arose {{and felt}} his way over the others who lay {{between himself and the}} opening of the shelter. Outside, there was no moon, but the stars were shining brightly, and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> objects that were not too far off.|$|E
60|$|Her {{voice was}} {{so low that}} at first <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>make</b> <b>out</b> what she said. Then he made it out. She was saying that {{she thought she could}} get well again if {{children}} believed in fairies.|$|R
60|$|He {{was still}} some {{distance}} from the old boathouse when he discovered two persons running across an open field which lined the roadway. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> not <b>make</b> <b>out</b> anything excepting that they were either men or big boys.|$|R
60|$|But Hank Stiger {{was already}} retreating, {{carrying}} the lighted tinder in his hand. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> not <b>make</b> <b>out</b> who was there, but {{saw it was}} somebody with a gun, {{and the sight of}} the weapon was enough for him.|$|R
60|$|There {{were four}} boats, and {{from where he}} sat <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> their names. The one {{directly}} beneath him had the name Ghost painted in large green letters on its stern. The other three, which lay beyond, were called respectively La Caprice, the Oyster Queen, and the Flying Dutchman.|$|E
6000|$|The {{latter was}} a {{stranger}} to him but in the darkness, by {{the aid of the}} glowing cigarette tips, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> a pale dandyish face over which a smile was travelling slowly, a tall overcoated figure and a hard hat. Heron did not trouble himself about an introduction but said instead: ...|$|E
6000|$|Carrie, {{so far as}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out,</b> {{appeared}} a trifle astonished. [...] "Well," [...] she said, [...] "I thought you must have met the man. I saw him come out and ride towards the house, but didn't seem to recognise him. Still, I daresay {{he was one of}} our visitors' cattle boys." ...|$|E
6000|$|Jim's {{story was}} a long one, and {{it took more than}} an hour in the telling; for his English was not always distinct, and it often {{required}} much questioning, on Reuben's part, before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> quite <b>make</b> <b>out</b> its meaning. The substance was as follows: ...|$|R
60|$|What was {{the object}} he saw, {{on the other}} side of a row of dwarf pear-trees, away to the right? A woman--evidently a servant by her dress--stooping down with her back to him, {{gathering}} something: herbs they looked like, as well as <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> them <b>out</b> at the distance.|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> {{a living}} <b>out</b> of it I should respect him," [...] said the Senator;--"though it's like knife-grinding or {{handling}} arsenic,--an unwholesome sort of profession." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{was just}} putting his foot {{out on the}} damp deck when he heard his wife scream. It was a startled frightened scream that ended in a splash overside. He leaped out and ran aft. In the dim starlight <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> her head and {{shoulders}} disappearing astern in the lazy wake.|$|E
60|$|They passed on, talking (<b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out)</b> about a {{skeleton}} {{which had been}} dug up yesterday, in some work of excavation near at hand, and {{was supposed to be}} that of a murdered man. 'So murder is not always found out, you see,' they said to one another as they turned the corner.|$|E
6000|$|He {{had dropped}} {{a little in}} {{presence}} of the explanation; then she had brought him up {{to a sort of}} recognition. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> by this light something of what he saw, but a dimness also there was, undispelled since his return. [...] "There's something you must definitely tell me. If our friend knows that all the while--?" ...|$|E
60|$|Cole {{turned toward}} the screen. At first <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>make</b> <b>out</b> what was happening. The screen showed a vast foaming cloud, a vortex of motion. From the speaker came a low rumble, a deep-throated roar. After a time the screen shifted, showing a {{slightly}} different view. Suddenly Cole stiffened.|$|R
60|$|About {{the vessel}} many figures {{could be seen}} swarming. With the aid of {{powerful}} glasses, the Heliumite {{saw that they were}} green warriors, and that they were repeatedly charging down upon the crew of the stranded airship. The nationality of the latter <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>make</b> <b>out</b> at so great a distance.|$|R
60|$|The men {{had ceased}} poling now, only giving an {{occasional}} push {{to keep her}} head straight and prevent her from swinging round. Presently a sailor standing next to Ned touched his arm {{and pointed to the}} right, and straining his eyes <b>he</b> <b>could</b> dimly <b>make</b> <b>out</b> a dark mass looming in that direction.|$|R
