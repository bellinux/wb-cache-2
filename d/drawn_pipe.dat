50|$|The city of Pervouralsk had its {{beginning}} as an industrial site. In 1732 the Vasilyevo-Shaitansky Iron Works (Васильево-Шайтанский железоделательный завод) was launched, laying {{the foundation for}} the future city. In 1920 this plant produced its first seamless <b>drawn</b> <b>pipe,</b> and in 1921 was renamed First Ural Seamless <b>Drawn</b> <b>Pipe</b> Plant. However, the plant lacked the equipment necessary for the production {{of a wide range of}} tubing on a large scale.|$|E
50|$|In 1930 the Soviet {{government}} {{decided to build}} a new pipe-making plant in the city. The construction of the New Pipe Plant started in 1931, the launch took place in 1934. Reflecting the changes, the First Ural Seamless <b>Drawn</b> <b>Pipe</b> Plant was renamed Old Pipe Plant in 1932.|$|E
50|$|The {{partnership}} with Mannesmann in 1998 placed Borusan {{among the top}} five steel pipe producers in Europe with a production capacity of 1 million tons, from factories in Gemlik, Istanbul and İzmit. In addition, Borusan has a factory in Italy with a production capacity of 32.000 tons per year of cold <b>drawn</b> <b>pipe.</b> In 1999 The Borusan Chamber Orchestra was transformed into a philharmonic orchestra.|$|E
60|$|A {{number of}} {{children}} going along the road stopped and regarded the artist curiously. A boatman exchanged civilities with him. He felt that possibly his circumspect attitude and position looked peculiar and unaccountable. Smoking, perhaps, might seem more natural. He <b>drew</b> <b>pipe</b> and pouch from his pocket, filled the pipe slowly.|$|R

40|$|Influence of {{ultrasound}} on {{the plug}} drawing of tubes was evaluated {{according to the}} change of stress and deformation state in the deformation zone of the <b>drawn</b> <b>pipe.</b> An impact controlling mechanism was classified for individual modes of sound exposition, depending on {{the position of the}} drawing plug against the longitudinal ultrasound wave...|$|E
6000|$|La Certe laughed, and Slowfoot said, [...] "Hee! hee!" [...] {{while the}} {{juvenile}} La Certe availed itself {{of the opportunity}} to <b>draw</b> the <b>pipe</b> gently from its father's hand and have a whiff.|$|R
6000|$|The Onondago <b>drew</b> his <b>pipe</b> {{from his}} mouth, looked round toward the 'squire, {{who had gone}} to the door in order to breathe the fresh air--then, turning his eyes most {{significantly}} on me, he answered-- ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The article {{describes}} influence of temperature on friction coefficient of {{low density polyethylene}} in the aspect of loads occurring in a drawing die during free <b>drawing</b> of <b>pipes.</b> Design/methodology/approach: Research {{was conducted on the}} basis of the PN-EN ISO standard. Findings: The paper presents results of friction coefficient research. The research was conducted on a testing machine with a special design table for measurement of friction in different, set temperatures. The paper resulted in characteristics of correlation between examined friction coefficient and temperature. Research limitations/implications: Research on dependence allows to evaluate thickness of the plasticized layer in free <b>drawn</b> PE <b>pipes.</b> Thickness of the plasticized layer depends on the value of friction coefficient. This is important in case of after-deformation returns which allows tight fitting of polyethylene lining during digless pipe reconstruction. Practical implications: Results of conducted research allow to verify the mathematical model describing a process of free <b>pipe</b> <b>drawing.</b> Originality/value: Research was conducted on exclusively prepared samples, which allows to reproduce conditions inside a drawing die...|$|R
60|$|Hereupon, Susquesus {{turned on}} me a {{significant}} look, <b>drew</b> his <b>pipe</b> from his belt, filled and lighted it, {{and began to}} smoke with a composure that was not easily disturbed. As soon as assured that his pipe was in a proper state, however, the Indian quietly began his story.|$|R
60|$|Uncle John's first {{inspiration}} was to {{sit down}} upon a stone to think. He <b>drew</b> out his <b>pipe</b> and lighted it, to assist his meditations.|$|R
50|$|The Department of Horticulture will do field preparation, install drip {{fertigation}} system, develop community nursery {{and supply}} inputs for cultivation of vegetables. The Agro Engineering Department will create water structures, including 19 ground-level reservoirs to store water <b>drawn</b> from <b>pipes</b> from the Konalaru river and provide pumping facility to irrigate the entire project area.|$|R

60|$|This {{was said}} in a low voice, {{purposely}} to prevent aunt Mary from hearing it; and, as she was a little deaf, it is probable the intention was successful. Not so, however, with Colonel Dirck, who <b>drew</b> the <b>pipe</b> from his mouth, and sat attentively listening, in the manner of one who felt great interest in the subject. Another pause succeeded.|$|R
6000|$|... "You'd {{have to make}} it a heavy rap, then, {{to produce}} any effect," [...] said Hans, taking a long <b>draw</b> at his <b>pipe,</b> [...] "for he belongs to a hard-headed race." ...|$|R
60|$|Presently he <b>drew</b> out his <b>pipe,</b> filled it, and {{sat down}} in front of the fire to smoke. As he did this, a slight noise outside the cabin {{attracted}} his attention.|$|R

60|$|Having thus {{fully and}} emphatically {{condemned}} himself, {{and along with}} himself all mankind {{who are in a}} similar category, Tim Rokens relapsed into silence, deliberately <b>drew</b> forth his <b>pipe,</b> filled it, lit it, and began to smoke.|$|R
6000|$|As Mozwa {{felt himself}} {{to be in a}} {{somewhat}} confused mental condition, he echoed the sigh, laid down his <b>pipe,</b> <b>drew</b> his blanket round him, and, without the formality of [...] "Good-night," [...] resigned himself to repose.|$|R
60|$|Thus brooded Leonard as he sat, {{his hands}} in his pockets and an empty pipe between his teeth. Their tobacco was done, and yet he <b>drew</b> at the <b>pipe,</b> perhaps from habit. And all the while Otter watched him.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Lander {{sat down}} there while Mrs. Claxon <b>drew</b> from the <b>pipes</b> {{a glass of}} water, which she proudly {{explained}} was pumped {{all over the house}} by the wind mill that supplied the power for her husband's turning lathes.|$|R
60|$|The {{newcomer}} {{leaned his}} gun against the rock, and <b>drawing</b> a <b>pipe</b> {{from the pocket}} of his shooting-coat, commenced leisurely to fill it. Every now and then he glanced at the boy, who seemed once more to have become unconscious of his presence. He struck a match and lit the tobacco, stooping down for a moment to escape the slight evening breeze. Then he threw the match away, and lounged against the lichen-covered fragment of stone.|$|R
5000|$|Van Gogh {{experimented with}} use of light over his ten-year {{painting}} career. A trio of still lifes shows his developing style for managing light. At first he placed light subjects against a background, as in Still Life with Four Stone Bottles, Flask and White Cup (1884) Then he realized the effectiveness of using [...] "pure colors, such as in Still Life with Lemons on a plate (1887) {{and even more so}} in Still Life: <b>Drawing</b> Board, <b>Pipe,</b> Onions and Sealing-Wax (1889)." ...|$|R
60|$|He entered without knocking, and I saw at {{once that}} he was in a strange condition. He {{scarcely}} greeted me, but sank into my easy chair, and <b>drawing</b> out his <b>pipe</b> began to fill it. Then I saw, too, what I had never seen before. His fingers were shaking.|$|R
60|$|Prince Amédé d'Orléans was puffing at {{that strange}} weed which of late had taken such marked hold of most men, tending to idleness in them, for it {{caused them to}} sit staring at the smoke which they <b>drew</b> from <b>pipes</b> made of clay; surely the Lord had never {{intended}} such strange doings, and Mistress Martha would willingly have protested against the unpleasant odor thus created by her lodger when he was puffing away, only that she stood somewhat in awe of his ill-humor and of his violent language, especially when Adam himself was from home.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: To {{evaluate}} the seismic performance of pre-cast concrete shear wall with vertical reinforcements spliced by two different grout ways, quasi-static tests of two concrete shear walls holed by prefabricated corrugated pipe and one concrete shear wall holed by <b>drawing</b> out the <b>pipe</b> were tested. The test {{results showed that}} the wall holed by prefabricated corrugated pipe was basically the same as the wall holed by <b>drawing</b> out the <b>pipe</b> in failure modes. The hysteretic curves of the specimens are full, the trend of the skeleton curve is basically the same and the capacity of the energy dissipation is close. The displacement ductility factors are more than 4. For the two walls holed by prefabricated corrugated pipe, when the lap length is reduced, the seismic performance decline as well, but the wall still meets the current seismic code requirements...|$|R
5000|$|The Belgian surrealist artist René Magritte {{illustrated}} {{the concept of}} [...] "perception always intercedes between reality and ourselves" [...] {{in a number of}} paintings including a famous work entitled The Treachery of Images, which consists of a <b>drawing</b> of a <b>pipe</b> with the caption, Ceci n'est pas une pipe ("This is not a pipe").|$|R

60|$|There {{was a pause}} of {{profound}} stillness, then a match flared, and Marlow's lean face appeared, worn, hollow, with downward folds and dropped eyelids, with an aspect of concentrated attention; and as he took vigorous <b>draws</b> at his <b>pipe,</b> it seemed to retreat and advance out {{of the night in}} the regular flicker of the tiny flame. The match went out.|$|R
