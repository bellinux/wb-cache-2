5|$|Practically, several {{immunodiagnostic}} methods {{based on}} detection of complex antigen-antibody {{are used to}} diagnose infectious diseases, for example ELISA, immunofluorescence, Western blot, immunodiffusion, immunoelectrophoresis, and magnetic <b>immunoassay.</b> Antibodies raised against human chorionic gonadotropin are used in over the counter pregnancy tests.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, a {{team from}} New York {{described}} detection of PrPSc even when initially present at only one part in a hundred billion (10−11) in brain tissue. The method combines amplification with a novel technology called Surround Optical Fiber <b>Immunoassay</b> (SOFIA) and some specific antibodies against PrPSc. After amplifying and then concentrating any PrPSc, the samples are labelled with a fluorescent dye using an antibody for specificity and then finally loaded into a micro-capillary tube. This tube is placed in a specially constructed apparatus {{so that it is}} totally surrounded by optical fibres to capture all light emitted once the dye is excited using a laser.|$|E
5|$|Amphetamine is {{frequently}} measured in urine or blood {{as part of}} a drug test for sports, employment, poisoning diagnostics, and forensics. Techniques such as <b>immunoassay,</b> which is {{the most common form of}} amphetamine test, may cross-react with a number of sympathomimetic drugs. Chromatographic methods specific for amphetamine are employed to prevent false positive results. Chiral separation techniques may be employed to help distinguish the source of the drug, whether prescription amphetamine, prescription amphetamine prodrugs, (e.g., selegiline), over-the-counter drug products that contain levomethamphetamine, or illicitly obtained substituted amphetamines. Several prescription drugs produce amphetamine as a metabolite, including benzphetamine, clobenzorex, famprofazone, fenproporex, lisdexamfetamine, mesocarb, methamphetamine, prenylamine, and selegiline, among others. These compounds may produce positive results for amphetamine on drug tests. Amphetamine is generally only detectable by a standard drug test for approximately 24hours, although a high dose may be detectable for days.|$|E
50|$|<b>Immunoassays</b> come in many {{different}} formats and variations. <b>Immunoassays</b> may be run in multiple steps with reagents being added and washed away or separated {{at different points in}} the assay. Multi-step assays are often called separation <b>immunoassays</b> or heterogeneous <b>immunoassays.</b> Some <b>immunoassays</b> can be carried out simply by mixing the reagents and sample and making a physical measurement. Such assays are called homogenous <b>immunoassays</b> or less frequently non-separation <b>immunoassays.</b>|$|R
50|$|Possibly one of {{the most}} popular labels to use in <b>immunoassays</b> is enzymes. <b>Immunoassays</b> which employ enzymes are {{referred}} to as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), or sometimes enzyme <b>immunoassays</b> (EIAs).|$|R

5|$|The person’s throat {{is first}} swabbed {{to collect a}} sample of mucus. In most RSTs, this mucus sample is then exposed to a reagent {{containing}} antibodies that will bind specifically to a GAS antigen. A positive result is signified by a certain visible reaction. There are three major types of RST: First, a latex fixation test, which was developed in the 1980s and is largely obsolete. It employs latex beads covered with antigens that will visibly agglutinate around GAS antibodies if these are present. Second, a lateral flow test, which is currently the most widely used RST. The sample is applied to a strip of nitrocellulose film and, if GAS antigens are present, these will migrate along the film to form a visible line of antigen bound to labeled antibodies. Third, optical <b>immunoassay</b> is the newest and more expensive test. It involves mixing the sample with labeled antibodies and then with a special substrate on a film which changes colour to signal {{the presence or absence of}} GAS antigen.|$|E
5|$|The {{specificity}} of RSTs {{for the presence}} of GAS is at least 95%, with some studies finding close to 100% specificity. Therefore, if the test result is positive, the presence of GAS is highly likely. However, 5% to 20% of individuals carry GAS in their throats without symptomatic infection, so the presence of GAS in an individual with pharyngitis does not prove that this organism is responsible for the infection. The sensitivity of lateral flow RSTs is somewhat lower at 65% to 80%. Therefore, a negative result from such a test cannot be used to rule out GAS pharyngitis, a considerable disadvantage compared with microbial culture, which has a sensitivity of 90% to 95%. However, newer optical <b>immunoassay</b> RSTs have been found to have a much higher sensitivity of 94%.|$|E
5|$|Various chromatographic {{methods have}} been {{developed}} to detect psilocin in body fluids: the rapid emergency drug identification system (REMEDi HS), a drug screening method based on HPLC; HPLC with electrochemical detection; GC–MS; and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Although the determination of psilocin levels in urine can be performed without sample clean-up (i.e., removing potential contaminants that make it difficult to accurately assess concentration), the analysis in plasma or serum requires a preliminary extraction, followed by derivatization of the extracts in the case of GC–MS. A specific <b>immunoassay</b> has also been developed to detect psilocin in whole blood samples. A 2009 publication reported using HPLC to quickly separate forensically important illicit drugs including psilocybin and psilocin, which were identifiable within about half a minute of analysis time. These analytical techniques to determine psilocybin concentrations in body fluids are, however, not routinely available, and not typically used in clinical settings.|$|E

Since proBNP significantly cross-reacts with commercial <b>immunoassays</b> for BNP, manufacturers should test and clearly declare the cross-reaction with proBNP in their BNP methods. Owing to the differences in cross-reaction with proBNP as well as in specificity, respectively, for the NH 2 - or COOH-terminal part of the peptide hormone chain, BNP <b>immunoassays</b> show significant between-method differences. <b>Immunoassays</b> for NT-proBNP, which all use standard materials and antibodies provided by the same company, show lower differences (generally < 20...|$|R

5|$|Gene {{silencing}} aims {{to reduce}} {{the production of the}} mutant protein, since HD is caused by a single dominant gene encoding a toxic protein. Gene silencing experiments in mouse models have shown that when the expression of mHTT is reduced, symptoms improve. Safety of non-allele specific RNAi and ASO gene silencing has now been demonstrated in mice and the large, human-like brains of primates. Allele-specific silencing attempts to silence mutant HTT while leaving wild-type HTT untouched. One way of accomplishing this is to identify polymorphisms present on only one allele and produce gene silencing drugs that target polymorphisms in only the mutant allele. The first 'gene silencing' trial involving human HD patients began in 2015, testing the safety of IONIS-HTTRx, produced by Ionis Pharmaceuticals and led by UCL Institute of Neurology. Mutant huntingtin was detected and quantified {{for the first time in}} cerebrospinal fluid from Huntington's disease mutation-carriers in 2015 using a novel 'single-molecule counting' <b>immunoassay,</b> providing a direct way to assess whether huntingtin-lowering treatments are achieving the desired effect. Similarly, gene splicing techniques are being looked at to try to repair a genome with the erroneous gene that causes HD, using tools such as CRISPR/Cas9.|$|E

Some testing procedures hydrolyze metabolic products into morphine before the <b>immunoassay,</b> which must be considered when comparing morphine levels in separately published results. Morphine can also be isolated from whole blood samples by solid phase extraction (SPE) and detected using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS).|$|E
40|$|To {{maintain}} the antibody activity and enhance performance of array-based <b>immunoassays,</b> protein G {{was used to}} allow a shorter duration of immunoglobulin G immobilization at 4 °C, with the antibody placed in the appropriate orientation. The multiplexed detection of six pain-related message molecules (PRMMs) was used as examples {{for the development of}} array-based immunoassays: substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide, nerve growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, tumor necrosis factor-α, and β-endorphin. Protein G- and non-protein G-coated slides were tested. Compared to non-protein G <b>immunoassays,</b> protein G shortened the antibody immobilization time at 4 °C from overnight to 2 hours. Only protein G-facilitated <b>immunoassays</b> succeeded in simultaneously detecting all six PRMMs with high specificity. Dose-response curves showed that the limits of detection of the protein G-multiplexed <b>immunoassays</b> for the PRMMs was approximately 164, 167, 120, 60, 80, and 92 pg/ml, respectively. Thus, protein G effectively shortens the duration of antibody immobilization at 4 °C, allowing the use of sensitive array-based <b>immunoassays</b> for the simultaneous detection of PRMMs...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{capillary}} electrophoresis {{as a tool}} to conduct <b>immunoassays</b> has been an area of increasing interest over the last decade. This approach combines the efficiency, small sample requirements, and relatively high speed of CE with the selectivity of antibodies as binding agents. This review examines the various assay formats and detection modes that have been reported for these assays, along with some representative applications. Most CE <b>immunoassays</b> in the past have employed homogeneous methods in which the sample and reagents are allowed to react in solution. These homogeneous methods have been conducted as both competitive binding <b>immunoassays</b> and as non-competitive binding <b>immunoassays.</b> Fluorescent labels are most commonly used for detection in these assays, but enzyme labels have also been utilized for such work. Some additional work has been performed in CE <b>immunoassays</b> with heterogeneous methods in which either antibodies or an analog of the analyte is immobilized to a solid support. These heterogeneous methods can be used for the selective isolation of analytes prior to their separation by CE or to remove a given species from a sample/reagent mixture prior to analysis by CE. These CE <b>immunoassays</b> can be used with a variety of detection modes, such as fluorescence, UV/visible absorbance, chemiluminescence, electrochemical measurements, mass spectrometry, and surface plasmon resonance...|$|R

In populations that have not been immunized or if immunity is questionable, a clinician may order an Enzyme <b>immunoassay.</b> An <b>immunoassay</b> measures the levels of antibodies against the virus that give immunity to a person.

50|$|In {{addition}} to the binding of an antibody to its antigen, the other key feature of all <b>immunoassays</b> is a means to produce a measurable signal {{in response to the}} binding.

A large number of labels exist in modern <b>immunoassays,</b> and they allow for detection through different means.
