50|$|Jitter buffers or de-jitter buffers {{are used}} to counter jitter {{introduced}} by queuing in packet switched networks so that a continuous playout of audio (or video) transmitted over the network can be ensured. The maximum jitter that can be countered by a <b>de-jitter</b> <b>buffer</b> {{is equal to the}} buffering delay introduced before starting the play-out of the mediastream. In the context of packet-switched networks, the term packet delay variation is often preferred over jitter.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{transfer}} voice {{or some other}} application requiring real-time delivery over a packet network, we need a <b>de-jitter</b> <b>buffer</b> to eliminate delay jitters. An important design parameter is {{the depth of the}} <b>de-jitter</b> <b>buffer</b> since it influences two important parameters controlling voice quality, namely voice-path delay and packet loss probability. In this paper, we propose and study several schemes for optimally adjusting the depth of the <b>de-jitter</b> <b>buffer.</b> In addition to de-jitter-buffer depth adjustments within a call, the initial value and rates of changes of the <b>de-jitter</b> <b>buffer</b> depth are allowed to depend on the class of the call and are adaptively adjusted (upwards or downwards) for every new call based on voice-path delay and packet loss probability measurements over one or more previous calls. Parameter adjustments are geared towards either (a) minimizing voice-path delay while maintaining a packet loss probability objective, or (b) maximizing R-factor, an objective measure of voice quality that depends both on the voice-path delay and the packet loss probability. Using simulation models and measured packet delay traces, it is shown that adaptive schemes perform better than static ones and adaptive schemes with learning perform better than ones without learning. q 2003 Published by Elsevier B.

30|$|On {{the sender}} side, LACK is {{implemented}} in two steps. In the first step, some random packets {{in the voice}} stream are selected. It {{should be noted that}} the maximum probability of one packet being selected is limited to satisfy the quality requirement of the voice service. The payload of the selected packets is replaced by the steganogram which refers to the secret message to be sent for the party of interest. The second step will hold those packets for a while to make sure the packets will be considered as late in the receiver side. The time for which a packet is held depends on the size of the receiver <b>de-jitter</b> <b>buffer.</b> Since the VoIP service is a time-sensitive service, very small delay is allowed for each packet, and the receiver <b>de-jitter</b> <b>buffer</b> will not be too large. The artificially delayed time must be greater than the <b>de-jitter</b> <b>buffer</b> size. However, it must be kept as small as possible to avoid detection.|$|E
30|$|It {{is worth}} to note here that typical VoIP {{applications}} install packet loss protection mechanisms at application and/or CODEC levels such as Forward Error Correction (FEC) or interleaving, in order to recover dropped voice packets in the network. Moreover, an adaptive <b>de-jittering</b> <b>buffer</b> is usually deployed that enables smartly reducing losses caused by late arrivals. Both, packet loss recovery schemes and <b>de-jittering</b> <b>buffer</b> policies are implicitly considered in our context because the considered packet loss pattern is monitored at the input of the speech decoder which should receive speech frames at a fixed frequency. Note that the perceived effect of many recovery schemes and <b>de-jittering</b> <b>buffer</b> dynamics has been studied in literature [13, 14].|$|R
50|$|Some systems use {{sophisticated}} delay-optimal <b>de-jitter</b> <b>buffers</b> {{that are}} capable of adapting the buffering delay to changing network jitter characteristics. These are known as adaptive <b>de-jitter</b> <b>buffers</b> and the adaptation logic is based on the jitter estimates computed from the arrival characteristics of the media packets. Adaptive de-jittering involves introducing discontinuities in the media play-out, which may appear offensive to the listener or viewer. Adaptive de-jittering is usually carried out for audio play-outs that feature a VAD/DTX encoded audio, that allows the lengths of the silence periods to be adjusted, thus minimizing the perceptual impact of the adaptation.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{explores the}} perceptual effect of network delay jitters on consumers' quality of {{experience}} during packet-based VoIP conversations. Novel parametric speech quality models are proposed to faithfully capture speech quality impairment caused by network delay jitter and <b>de-jittering</b> <b>buffer</b> settings. The proposed {{models have been}} rigorously conceived following a regression analysis approach using {{a wide range of}} network delay jitter traces and <b>de-jittering</b> <b>buffer</b> settings. The network delay traces were synthetically produced by a stochastic generator, widely used by the research community. Moreover, new speech quality models, which quantify the individual and mixed perceptual effect of network random packet losses and delay jitter, are proposed and validated. The packet layer key parameters of proposed speech quality models, namely mean network delay jitter and <b>de-jittering</b> <b>buffer</b> delay, are easily accessible at run-time. Experimental results show that our no-reference speech quality models correlate very well with the standard full-reference speech quality models. Indeed, our performance evaluation shows correlation factors equal to 0. 97 and 0. 94 for, respectively, the G. 711 and the G. 729 CODECs. The proposed speech quality models should help design optimized schemes for network delay jitter removal, thus improving the perceptual speech quality for a given network delay jitter intensity. Moreover, the speech quality models can be used to accurately measure in a non-intrusive way the perceptual effect of network delay jitter and packet loss, separately. This constitutes a desirable feature, as it enables the smart mitigation of the sources of speech quality degradation...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a method for}} monitoring Voice over IP (VolP) applications based upon a reduction of the ITU-T's E-Model to transport level, measurable quantities. In the process, 1) we identify the relevant transport level quantities, 2) we discuss the tradeoffs between placing the monitors within the VolP gateways versus placement of the monitors within the transport path, and 3) we identify several areas where further work and consensus within the industry are required. We discover that the relevant transport level quantities are the delay, network packet loss and the decoder's <b>de-jitter</b> <b>buffer</b> packet loss. We find that an in-path monitor requires {{the definition of a}} reference <b>de-jitter</b> <b>buffer</b> implementation to estimate voice quality based upon observed transport measurements.

40|$|Abstract:- In this work, the {{perceived}} quality of VoIP communications is studied. The distributions {{of the number}} of consecutive received and lost packets, respectively named gap and burst, of a VoIP communication are modeled with discrete two-state and four-state Markov chains. Algorithms for estimating the transition probabilities between states and from these, the packet loss rate and the respective gap and burst length distributions, are described. Through a study of monitored VoIP calls, it is shown that these models can adequately represent the geometric-type decay of these distributions and that although two-state model performs well for homogeneous losses, for non-homogeneous losses the four-state model fits better. An analysis of the performance of a packet-level FEC scheme, based on ܰ-packet redundancy, is presented. The perceived packet loss rate that results of applying this correction scheme is quantified. For the studied measurements, 1 -packet redundancy is sufficient to decrease {{the perceived}} loss rate below 1 %. Also, the impairments of the perceived quality of voice after the FEC technique and a <b>de-jitter</b> <b>buffer</b> is quantified. The resulting equations can be used to optimize the adjust parameters of the VoIP call, e. g., level of redundancy, type of codec used and <b>de-jitter</b> <b>buffer</b> size.

40|$|The {{increasing}} use {{of interactive}} multimedia applications over the Internet has created a problem of congestion. This is because a majority of these applications {{do not respond to}} congestion indicators. This leads to resource starvation for responsive flows, and ultimately excessive delay and losses for all flows therefore loss of quality. This results in unfair sharing of network resources and increasing the risk of network ‘congestion collapse’. Current Congestion Control Mechanisms such as ‘TCP-Friendly Rate Control’ (TFRC) have been able to achieve ‘fair-share’ of network resource when competing with responsive flows such as TCP, but TFRC’s method of congestion response (i. e. to reduce Packet Rate) is not ideally matched for interactive multimedia applications which maintain a fixed Frame Rate. This mismatch of the two rates (Packet Rate and Frame Rate) leads to buffering of frames at the Sender Buffer resulting in delay and loss, and an unacceptable reduction of quality or complete loss of service for the end-user. To address this issue, this thesis proposes a novel Congestion Control Mechanism which is referred to as ‘TCP-friendly rate control – Fine Grain Scalable’ (TFGS) for interactive multimedia applications. This new approach allows multimedia frames (data) to be sent as soon as they are generated, so that the multimedia frames can reach the destination as quickly as possible, in order to provide an isochronous interactive service. This is done by maintaining the Packet Rate of the Congestion Control Mechanism (CCM) at a level equivalent to the Frame Rate of the Multimedia Encoder. The response to congestion is to truncate the Packet Size, hence reducing the overall bitrate of the multimedia stream. This functionality of the Congestion Control Mechanism is referred to as Packet Size Truncation (PST), and takes advantage of adaptive multimedia encoding, such as Fine Grain Scalable (FGS), where the multimedia frame is encoded in order of significance, Most to Least Significant Bits. The Multimedia Adaptation Manager (MAM) truncates the multimedia frame to the size indicated by the Packet Size Truncation function of the CCM, accurately mapping user demand to available network resource. Additionally Fine Grain Scalable encoding can offer scalability at byte level granularity, providing a true match to available network resources. This approach has the benefits of achieving a ‘fair-share’ of network resource when competing with responsive flows (as similar to TFRC CCM), but it also provides an isochronous service which is of crucial benefit to real-time interactive services. Furthermore, results illustrate that an increased number of interactive multimedia flows (such as voice) can be carried over congested networks whilst maintaining a quality level equivalent to that of a standard landline telephone. This is because the loss and delay arising from the buffering of frames at the Sender Buffer is completely removed. Packets sent maintain a fixed inter-packet-gap-spacing (IPGS). This results in a majority of packets arriving at the receiving end at tight time intervals. Hence, this avoids the need of using large Playout (<b>de-jitter)</b> <b>Buffer</b> sizes and adaptive Playout Buffer configurations.
