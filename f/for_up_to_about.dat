40|$|In [l], Effros and Chou {{introduce}} a two-stage universal transform code called the weighted universal transform code (WUTC). By replacing JPEG’s single, non-optimal transform code with {{a collection of}} optimal transform codes, the WUTC achieves significant performance gains over JPEG. The computational and storage costs of that performance gain are effectively the computation and storage required to operate and store a collection of transform codes rather than a single transform code. We here consider two complexity- and storageconstrained variations of the WUTC. The complexity and storage of the algorithm are controlled by constraining the order of the bases. In the first algorithm, called a fast WTC (FWUTC), complexity is controlled by controlling the maximum order of each transform. On a sequence of combined text and gray-scale images, the FWUTC achieves performance comparable to the WUTC at 1 / 32 the complexity <b>for</b> rates <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>about</b> 0. 10 bits per pixel (bpp), 1 / 16 the complexity <b>for</b> rates <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>about</b> 0. 15 bpp, 1 / 8 the complexity <b>for</b> rates <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>about</b> 0. 20 bpp, and 1 / 4 the complexity <b>for</b> rates <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>about</b> 0. 40 bpp. In the second algorithm, called a jointly optimized fast WUTC (JWUTC), the complexity is controlled by controlling the average order of the transforms. On the same data set and for the same complexity, the performance of the JWUTC always exceeds the performance of the FWUTC. On the data set considered, the performance of the JWUTC is, at each rate, virtually indistinguishable from that of the WUTC at 1 / 8 the complexity. The JWUTC and FWUTC algorithm are interesting both for their complexity and storage savings in data compression and for the insights that they lend into the choice of appropriate fixed- and variable-order bases for image representation. 1068 - 0314 / 97 $ 10. 00 1997 IEEE 2112 12...|$|R

50|$|The kuhli loach is an eel-shaped {{fish with}} {{slightly}} compressed sides, four pairs of barbels around the mouth, and very small fins. The dorsal fin starts behind {{the middle of}} the body, and the anal fin well behind this. The eyes are covered with a transparent skin. The body has 10 to 15 dark brown to black vertical bars, and the gaps between them are salmon pink to yellow with a light underside. When the fish is not actively breeding, distinctions between males and females are not readily apparent. However, close observation will reveal that males have more a muscular upper/dorsal cross-section and their pectoral fins tend to be larger, more paddle-shaped, and often have some pigment in them. When breeding, the females often become larger than the male and their greenish ovaries can be seen through the skin before spawning. Spawning is not easy, but when it occurs a few hundred greenish eggs are laid among the roots of floating plants. Kuhli loaches reach maturity at 2&thinsp;&frac34; inches (7 cm) and have a maximum length of 4 inches (10 cm).This fish can live <b>for</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>about</b> 14 years.|$|E
5000|$|The average litter {{consists}} {{of one to}} five cubs. Although many cubs are sired by resident males, up to 54% can be fathered by boars from different colonies. Dominant sows may kill the cubs of subordinates. Cubs are born pink, with greyish, silvery fur and fused eyelids. Neonatal badgers are 12 cm in body length on average and weigh 75 to 132 g, with cubs from large litters being smaller. By three to five days, their claws become pigmented, and individual dark hairs begin to appear. Their eyes open at four to five weeks and their milk teeth erupt about the same time. They emerge from their setts at eight weeks of age, and begin to be weaned at twelve weeks, though they may still suckle until they are four to five months old. Subordinate females assist the mother in guarding, feeding and grooming the cubs. Cubs fully develop their adult coats at six to nine weeks. In areas with medium to high badger populations, dispersal from the natal group is uncommon, though badgers may temporarily visit other colonies. [...] Badgers can live <b>for</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>about</b> fifteen years in the wild.|$|E
