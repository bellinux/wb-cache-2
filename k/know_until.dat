25|$|It {{is unclear}} just when Powell {{learned that the}} kidnap plot had turned to an assassination. There is {{testimony}} from the nurse attending the Secretary of State indicating that Powell may have learned of his role to assassinate Seward on Thursday, April 13. A man fitting Powell's description appeared at the Seward home that day to inquire about the Secretary's health. Powell himself was inconsistent. He once said he learned he was to kill Seward {{on the morning of}} Friday, April 14, but later claimed he did not <b>know</b> <b>until</b> the evening of April 14.|$|E
25|$|As {{a further}} measure to prevent escapes, the patrol {{patterns}} of the Grenztruppen were carefully arranged to reduce any chance of a border guard defecting. Patrols, watchtowers and observation posts were always manned by two or three soldiers at a time. They {{were not allowed to}} go out of each other's sight in any circumstances. When changing the guard in watchtowers, they were under orders to enter and exit the buildings {{in such a way that}} there were never fewer than two people on the ground. Duty rosters were organised to prevent friends and roommates being assigned to the same patrols. The pairings were switched (though not randomly) to ensure that the same people did not repeatedly carry out duty together. Individual border guards did not <b>know</b> <b>until</b> the start of their shift with whom they would be working that day. If a guard attempted to escape, his colleagues were under instructions to shoot him without hesitation or prior warning.|$|E

Though Horner's previous work comprised mostly high-budget studio films [...] including Titanic (1997), Braveheart (1995), The Mask of Zorro (1998), and Apollo 13 (1995) [...] producer Bonnie Curtis approached him to score The Chumscrubber because [...] "You never <b>know</b> <b>until</b> you ask." [...] Horner agreed after seeing an early {{cut of the}} film. He and Posin spent five days on a soundstage, experimenting with different musical arrangements. Posin described the final product as [...] "dramatic with a wink and a smile to it".|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, it is [...] "an {{inspirational}} {{song about}} finding one’s destiny, and becoming numb to the negativity and just following your dreams". [...] "Numb"'s lyrical message {{was described by}} Erika Ramirez of Billboard to simply be [...] "Forget your troubles and fist-pump!". The single opens with the lines, [...] "They say life is a battlefield / I say bring it on" [...] and its chorus consists of [...] "Just go numb / You never <b>know</b> <b>until</b> you let go". Ryan Hadfield of Consequence of Sound explained that Usher inadvertently describes the logic behind the musical ambition of Looking 4 Myself in [...] "Numb", when he sings [...] "Keep on doing the same old thing/Are you expecting change/Is that really insanity/Or just a loser’s game".|$|E
500|$|On {{the day of}} the episode's airing, Hearst {{expected}} that most Veronica Mars fans would not remember her kidnapping and the subsequent events, stating [...] "I won't be a distraction for them. They can focus in on the juicy story line." [...] Charles Shaughnessy appears as Selma Rose's husband, Budd. The episode was initially written to feature a lesbian kiss between Hearst's character and Keri Lynn Pratt's character, Hallie, when the two were discovered to be having an affair. However, The CW, the network the series aired on, stepped in and decided to cut the scene before it was filmed. Hearst reported, [...] "I meet Keri and I'm like, 'Hello.' We didn't <b>know</b> <b>until</b> we were on the set we couldn't actually kiss. We were all set for that." [...] AOL TV commented that the network might have made the choice to prevent [...] "Lord of the Pi's" [...] from becoming a lesbian kiss episode involving an older woman, while AfterEllen.com called the choice [...] "bizarre".|$|E

500|$|The WWF {{received}} some support {{from people who}} felt that the company {{did the right thing}} by continuing the event. Vince Russo, a WWF script writer at the time, pointed to the fact that Brian Pillman, a family friend of the Harts and a member of The Hart Foundation, died shortly before the [...] pay-per-view on which he was scheduled to perform in 1997. After learning of Pillman's death, both Bret and Owen Hart went ahead with their matches on the show. Russo claimed that this showed that [...] "the night he passed away I'm sure Owen would have wanted the same thing." [...] Vince McMahon refused to comment on Hart's death until he felt sufficient time had passed. When asked if he felt responsible for the accident, he replied, [...] "I have a lot to say and I will say it. I promise you that. But {{this is not the time}} to do it.... Give me a few days. Give me to the end of the week. Then we'll talk." [...] The day after Over the Edge, the WWF published a message in the Calgary Sun, stating, [...] "We do not have much information as to how it happened and will not <b>know</b> <b>until</b> an investigation is completed. We are all shaken, and to say Owen will be missed is to fall short of a way to fully explain what he meant to us." [...] Although the WWF had no information, they reported that [...] "Our thoughts and prayers go out to the entire Hart family. We have to be strong for Owen; he was an extraordinary human being and consummate performer and knows that the highest tribute that we can pay is to go on entertaining the fans he loved so much." ...|$|E
500|$|Another {{well-known}} {{story is}} that the actors did not <b>know</b> <b>until</b> {{the last day of}} shooting how the film was to end. The original play (set entirely in the cafe) ended with Rick sending Ilsa and Laszlo to the airport. During scriptwriting, the possibility was discussed of Laszlo being killed in Casablanca, allowing Rick and Ilsa to leave together, but as Casey Robinson wrote to Hal Wallis before filming began, the ending of the film [...] "set up for a swell twist when Rick sends her away on the plane with Laszlo. For now, in doing so, he is not just solving a love triangle. He is forcing the girl {{to live up to the}} idealism of her nature, forcing her to carry on with the work that in these days is far more important than the love of two little people." [...] It was certainly impossible for Ilsa to leave Laszlo for Rick, as the production code forbade showing a woman leaving her husband for another man. The concern was not whether Ilsa would leave with Laszlo, but how this result could be engineered. The problem was solved when the Epstein brothers, Julius and Philip, were driving down Sunset Boulevard and stopped for the light at Beverly Glen. At that instant the identical twins turned to each other and simultaneously cried out, [...] "Round up the usual suspects!" [...] By the time they had driven past Fairfax and the Cahuenga Pass and through the Warner Brothers studio's portals at Burbank, in the words of Julius Epstein, [...] "the idea for the farewell scene between a tearful Bergman and a suddenly noble Bogart" [...] had been formed and all the problems of the ending had been solved. The confusion was probably caused by Bergman's later statement that she did not know which man she was meant to be in love with. Rewrites did occur during the filming, but Aljean Harmetz's examination of the scripts has shown that many of the key scenes were shot after Bergman knew how the film would end; any confusion was, in critic Roger Ebert's words, [...] "emotional", not [...] "factual".|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the more}} {{significant}} recurring characters was Sardo (Richard Dumont), owner of [...] "Sardo's Magic Mansion" [...] (a magic shop). He would often attempt to sell a character a [...] "prized" [...] item, succeeding almost every single time. He often had items in his shop that contained real properties of magic, yet did not <b>know</b> <b>until</b> it was revealed in the story. One {{of the most memorable}} recurring jokes in the series occurred when someone would address him as [...] "Mr. Sardo." [...] He would then get irritated and exclaim: [...] "That's SarDO! No mister; accent on the doh!" [...] Another recurring line was: [...] "Have you seen our vomit?" [...] Additionally, when selling someone an item, he would often ask a rather high price. The main character would mention how much money they had, and Sardo would grab the money saying, [...] "But I'm losing on the deal." [...] Although he rarely got what he wanted, he would often end up helping the characters, often unintentionally.

2500|$|Rabbi Eleazar {{interpreted}} the words [...] "He withdraws not {{his eyes from}} the righteous" [...] in [...] to teach that God rewards righteousness, even generations later. The Gemara taught that in reward for Rachel's modesty as shown in her dealings with Jacob, God rewarded her with King Saul as a descendant. The Gemara taught that Jacob asked Rachel, [...] "Will you marry me?" [...] She replied, [...] "Yes, but my father is a trickster, and he will outwit you." [...] Jacob replied, [...] "I am his brother in trickery." [...] She said to him, [...] "Is it permitted to the righteous to indulge in trickery?" [...] He replied, [...] "Yes, with the pure you show yourself pure, and with the crooked you show yourself subtle." [...] He asked her, [...] "What is his trickery?" [...] She replied: [...] "I have a sister older than I am, and he will not let me marry before her." [...] So Jacob gave her certain tokens through which he could identify her. When night came, she said to herself, [...] "Now my sister will be put to shame," [...] so she gave Leah the tokens. Thus when [...] reports, [...] "And it came to pass in the morning that, behold, it was Leah," [...] we are not to infer that up until then she had not been Leah, but rather that on account of the tokens that Rachel had given Leah, Jacob did not <b>know</b> <b>until</b> then that it was Leah. Therefore, God rewarded Rachel with having Saul among her descendants..|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, Executive Producer Louise Berridge {{decided to}} {{reintroduce}} the character 8 {{years after she}} had last appeared. Auditions were held to cast the role to a professional actor; however, auditionees were not informed which character they were auditioning for. The first audition was a group workshop of 30 auditionees, who were asked to perform improvisations. After whittling down potential actors from 500 to 4, {{the second stage of}} the audition process was an interview with EastEnders Casting Director. The auditionees were asked to perform a monologue {{in front of a camera}} and do a screen test with one of the actors already in the show, Christopher Parker, who played Spencer Moon. 17-year-old actress Scarlett Johnson was cast: [...] "At the second audition they gave me a monologue to read, but they'd been really careful about it. They hadn't said what the character's name was, they didn't give away anything in the monologue that might tell me who I was auditioning for. So I didn't <b>know</b> <b>until</b> I got the part who I was going to be playing--I'd been guessing for ages!" [...] Asked how she felt when she knew she was playing Vicki Fowler, a character linked to the show's early history who is the daughter of 2 prominent original characters, Johnson said: [...] "I felt very honoured, but it was quite scary. I knew there'd be a lot of people out there with expectations of what she'd be like. But it's good fun actually. It means you don't have to introduce yourself to everyone. You can really play with that [...] My family are EastEnders addicts, we've watched it our whole lives. I remember the first Vicki, I remember Michelle and I definitely remember Dirty Den! My knowledge of the show really helped a lot, because I didn't have to do any research into the character. When I joined the show, I felt like I was meeting the actors for a second time. I'd already met them in my home on TV, then I had to actually meet them in real life!" [...] The character made her reappearance in January 2003, turning up unexpectedly at her grandmother Pauline's (Wendy Richard) house.|$|E
2500|$|In July, Feige {{discussed}} specific {{moments in}} the film, including an homage to The Amazing Spider-Man issue 33 where Parker is trapped underneath rubble, something Feige [...] "wanted {{to see in a}} movie for a long, long time". Daley said that they added the scene to the script because of how much Feige wanted it, and explained, [...] "We have [...] starting the scene with such self-doubt and helplessness, in a way that you really see the kid. You feel for him. He's screaming for help, because he doesn't think he can do it, and then ... he kind of realizes that that's been his biggest problem." [...] Feige compared the film's final scene, where Parker accidentally reveals that he is Spider-Man to his Aunt May, to the ending of Iron Man when Stark reveals that he is Iron Man to the world, saying, [...] "what does that mean for the next movie? I don't know, but it will force us to do something unique." [...] Goldstein added that it [...] "diminishes what is often the most trivial part of superhero worlds, which is finding your secret. It takes the emphasis off that [...] lets her become part of what's really his life". Feige also talked about the film's revelation that the Vulture is the father of Parker's love interest, saying, [...] "If that didn't work, the movie didn't work. We worked backwards and forwards from that moment. It was like two movies—it was the movie up until then and the movie after that moment. Because it had to surprise you, but it had to be true, also. You had to believe that we had set it up so that you would buy it [...] doesn't seem like something out of left field. That's a pretty great moment and we didn't <b>know</b> <b>until</b> we showed it to audiences" [...] that it would work. Watts said the revelation scene and the following interactions between the Vulture and Parker were, [...] "more than anything else, [...] I was looking forward to, and I got {{to have a lot of}} fun shooting that stuff." [...] Goldstein said the scene after the reveal, where Vulture realizes that Parker is Spider-Man while driving him to the school dance, was the moment he was most proud of in the film, and Daley said that scene's effect on audiences was the dramatic equivalent of an audience laughing at a joke they had written. He added that the writers were [...] "giddy when we first came up with , because it's taking the obvious tension of meeting the father of the girl that you have a crush on, and multiplying it by 1,000, when you also realize he's the guy you've been trying to stop the whole time." ...|$|E
