Renderers may be either hardware based, such that they correspond to graphics cards installed in the system or they may be software based, where the main CPU of the system handles all of the graphics command processing and final rasterization work.|$|E

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 14 - 16, 1975 / Sheraton Inn, Silver Spring, MarylandA {{real time}} data {{compression}} unit was designed and fabricated for the Radio Astronomv Explorer Lunar Mission Antenna Aspect Camera. The camera takes {{a panoramic view of}} spacecraft, moon, etc. of ± 35 degrees by 360 degrees. This data compressor combined information reduction and redundancy reduction. The information reduction was accomplished by subsampling (used every fourth line) : and the redundancy reduction was accomplished by an adaptive run-length encoder. The adaptive run-length encoder used a zero-order predictor. Two different maximum run-lengths were used with two different data <b>formats.</b> <b>Selection</b> of the operating format depended on the sampled gray level compared to a fixed threshold. Statistical data and images indicate that the redundancy reduction technique yields a compression ratio of 8 : 1.
