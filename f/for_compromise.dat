5|$|Canadian {{culture has}} {{historically}} been influenced by Indigenous, French and British cultures and traditions. Most of Canada's territory was inhabited and developed later than other European colonies in the Americas, {{with the result that}} themes and symbols of pioneers, trappers, and traders were important in the early development of the Canadian identity. First Nations played a critical part in the development of European colonies in Canada, particularly for their role in assisting exploration of the continent during the North American fur trade. The British conquest of New France in the mid-1700s brought a large Francophone population under British Imperial rule, creating a need <b>for</b> <b>compromise</b> and accommodation. The new British rulers left alone much of the religious, political, and social culture of the French-speaking habitants, guaranteeing through the Quebec Act of 1774 the right of the Canadiens to practise the Catholic faith and to use French civil law (now Quebec law).|$|E
5|$|Egan's own {{research}} into the issue showed that the trustees had conveyed St. Mary's Church to the previous pastor, Robert Harding, and then to his heirs, but the trustees did not consider that property transfer to have extinguished {{their role in the}} church's leadership. By 1811, Egan's worsening health caused him to accept the assistance of two priests at St. Mary's, James Harold and his nephew, William Vincent Harold. Egan and the trustees became further embroiled in a dispute about clerical salaries, a situation possibly made worse by the decline in shipping income in the port city caused by the outbreak of the War of 1812. Egan also came to believe the Harolds were making the situation worse by taking pro-clergy positions that were more extreme than Egan's own and by the younger Harold's scheming to be named Egan's coadjutor bishop. He appealed to the trustees <b>for</b> <b>compromise,</b> and offered to bring his cousin (also a priest) over from Ireland to replace the elder Harold. By 1813, Egan and the trustees had reconciled and together resolved to remove the Harolds, who agreed to resign later that year and relocate to England.|$|E

25|$|The Federal Relations Committee {{made its}} {{report to the}} {{convention}} on March 9. The fourteen proposals defended both slavery and states' rights while calling for {{a meeting of the}} eight slave states still in the Union to present a united front <b>for</b> <b>compromise.</b> From March 15 through April 14 the convention debated these proposals one by one. During the debates, the sixth resolution calling for a peaceful solution and maintenance of the Union came up for discussion on April 4. Lewis Edwin Harvie of Amelia County offered a substitute resolution calling for immediate secession. This was voted down by 88 to 45 and the next day the convention continued its debate. Approval of the last proposal came on April 12. The goal of the unionist faction after this approval was to adjourn the convention until October, allowing time for both the convention of the slave states and Virginia's congressional elections in May which, they hoped, would produce a stronger mandate <b>for</b> <b>compromise.</b>|$|E
25|$|Aiming <b>for</b> <b>compromise,</b> Laurier {{advanced}} the Naval Service Bill of 1910 which created the Naval Service of Canada. The navy would initially consist of five cruisers and six destroyers; {{in times of}} crisis, it could be made subordinate to the British Royal Navy. The idea was lauded at the 1911 Imperial Conference in London, but it proved unpopular {{across the political spectrum}} in Canada, especially in Quebec as ex-Liberal Henri Bourassa organized an anti-Laurier force.|$|E

500|$|Writer Peter C. Newman {{concluded}} that [...] "Stursberg's rage dominates his crackling autobiography - as does his grief {{for the lost}} network's unfulfilled promise." [...] Columnist Martin Knelman, in the Toronto Star, advised, [...] "Don't expect a balanced account of the troubles that brewed. This is strictly the Gospel According to Richard - entertaining but also blatantly self-serving. ... He had no appetite <b>for</b> <b>compromise,</b> consensus or conciliation. He seemed to relish the chance to shock people, make them angry and create dramatic showdowns. Now with this book, he seizes the chance to attack those who stood in his way."

500|$|A new {{committee}} was created, the Committee on Postponed Parts, to address other questions {{that had been}} postponed. Its members, such as Madison, were delegates who had shown a greater desire <b>for</b> <b>compromise</b> and were chosen for this reason as most in the Convention wanted to finish their work and go home. The committee dealt with questions related to the taxes, war making, patents and copyrights, relations with Indian tribes, and Franklin's compromise to require money bills to originate in the House. The biggest issue they addressed was the presidency, and the final compromise was written by Madison with the committee's input. They adopted Wilson's earlier plan for choosing the president by an electoral college, and settled on the method of choosing the president if no candidate had an electoral college majority, which many such as Madison thought would be [...] "nineteen times out of twenty".|$|E

Due partly {{to his own}} politics (Barak was from the leftist Labor Party, whereas Netanyahu was from the rightist Likud Party) and partly due to insistence <b>for</b> <b>compromise</b> by President Clinton, Barak offered Arafat a Palestinian state in 73 percent of the West Bank {{and all of the}} Gaza Strip. The Palestinian percentage of sovereignty would extend to 90 percent over a ten- to twenty-five-year period. Also included in the offer was the return of a small number of refugees and compensation for those not allowed to return. Palestinians would also have [...] "custodianship" [...] over the Temple Mount, sovereignty on all Islamic and Christian holy sites, and three of Jerusalem's four Old City quarters. Arafat rejected Barak's offer and refused to make an immediate counter-offer. He told President Clinton that, [...] "the Arab leader who would surrender Jerusalem is not born yet." ...|$|E

500|$|Following {{a scratch}} match {{at the start}} of the 1859 {{football}} season, the Melbourne Football Club officially came into being on 14 May. Three days later, Wills and three other members—Hammersley, journalist J. B. Thompson and teacher Thomas H. Smith—met near the MCG at the Parade Hotel, owned by Bryant, to devise and codify the club's rules. The men went over the rules of four English schools; Hammersley recalled Wills' preference for the Rugby game, but it was found to be confusing and too violent. Subsequently, they rejected common features such as [...] "hacking" [...] (shin-kicking) and produced a signed document listing ten simple rules suited to grown men and Australian conditions. Heading the list of signatories, Wills, too, saw the need <b>for</b> <b>compromise.</b> He wrote to his brother Horace: [...] "Rugby was not a game for us, we wanted a winter pastime but men could be harmed if thrown on the ground so we thought differently." [...] Thompson and Hammersley's promotion of the new code, together with Wills' star power, encouraged the spread of football throughout Victoria.|$|E
500|$|Many of the tributes paid to Davies {{after his}} death {{acknowledged}} his commitment to Merthyr and the mining communities of the Welsh valleys, {{for which he was}} an unfailing advocate. The mayor of Merthyr remarked that he was [...] "an individualist who followed the teaching of 'Love thy neighbour as thyself'. He was highly respected by all, even by those who didn't agree with him". His parliamentary colleague and fellow mineworker Jim Griffiths, who had shared with Davies the leadership of the South Wales miners after the 1926 general strike, thought that had Davies cultivated an ability <b>for</b> <b>compromise,</b> he would have achieved ministerial office. But [...] "he always was a lone figure... and seemed to like being in isolation." [...] In April 2013 a heritage plaque in Davies's honour was unveiled at Penydarren Park, Merthyr Tydfil. On 5 August 2015, as part of the De Montfort Project celebrating the 750th anniversary of Simon de Montfort's parliament, Davies's parliamentary work was recognised in special events at Cardiff and Merthyr Tydfil.|$|E
500|$|It is {{believed}} that both factions made some preparations to the election in {{the last months of}} the pontificate of Adrian IV, although these attempts are known only from the hostile accounts produced for the polemical purposes during the subsequent schism and it is impossible to verify their factual accuracy. Both sides accused each other of illegal conspiracies. The adherents of Victor IV accused [...] "Sicilians" [...] of receiving the bribes from the king William I of Sicily and the anti-Imperial cities of Brescia, Milan and Piacenza. They ostensibly made an oath not to vote for any candidate outside their circle. On the other hand, [...] "Sicilians" [...] accused imperialists of hatching a plot with the imperial envoy Otto von Wittelsbach, who was present at Rome {{at the time of the}} election and gave the significant support to Victor IV in taking control over the Patrimony of St. Peter. It is known that the secular adherents of Cardinal Ottaviano de Monticelli, who was related to the powerful family of the counts of Tusculum, were prepared for the armed confrontation in Rome.

500|$|In April 1951 the Labour {{government}} {{was hit by}} the resignations of three ministers—Aneurin Bevan, the future prime minister Harold Wilson, and John Freeman—over the imposition of prescription charges {{to pay for an}} increased armaments programme. Driberg was sympathetic to the rebels, though he tried to find a basis <b>for</b> <b>compromise</b> that would avoid resignations. The former ministers strengthened the small Labour group known as [...] "Keep Left", in which Driberg was prominent; the group would henceforth be known as [...] "Bevanites". In the October 1951 General Election the Labour Party was defeated, and Churchill resumed office; Driberg held on to his Maldon seat by 704 votes. Through the years of Labour government he had neither received nor sought office, having what historian Kenneth O. Morgan called a [...] "backbench mindset". He still enjoyed aspects of his parliamentary life, such as in 1953 when he showed the American singing sensation Johnnie Ray round the House of Commons; his attempts to seduce the singer were politely resisted. However, he needed to earn more money, and in the spring of 1952 responded to a suggestion that he should write a biography of Beaverbrook. The press lord was amenable, and work began in the summer of 1953. The project extended over several years, by which time Driberg was no longer in parliament; he had announced in March 1954 that he was standing down from Maldon, which at the General Election of May 1955 fell, as he had expected, to the Conservatives.|$|E
