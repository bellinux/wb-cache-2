40|$|A {{protocol}} {{is described}} that permits the self-selection of <b>hydrazides</b> {{from a small}} library by a phosphonate-target immobilized on resin. <b>Hydrazides</b> are captured by a neighbouring aldehyde group through reversible hydrazone bond formation. Stabilizing intramolecular interactions between the phosphonate-target and functional groups of the <b>hydrazides</b> drive the selection process. The phosphonate-target is introduced onto commercially available Tentagel resin through straightforward synthetic steps. The functionalized resin could be conveniently characterized by HR-MAS NMR spectroscopy using a recently developed transverse relaxation filter that eliminates the strong phase defects commonly observed with CPMG sequences. In addition, a protocol was developed to quantitatively remove the captured <b>hydrazides</b> from resin in order to analyse their composition by LC/MS. Kinetic experiments were used to study hydrazone formation and exchange on resin yielding similar results to those obtained previously in solution. Competition experiments showed that the system reaches thermodynamic equilibrium if multiple <b>hydrazides</b> {{are added to the}} resin. Finally, competition experiments showed that the immobilized phosphonate-target indeed amplifies the capture of those <b>hydrazides</b> able to develop stabilizing interactions with the target. Importantly, the obtained amplification profile was nearly identical to the ones obtained previously in solution studies. Notably, the observed amplification factors for the self-selected <b>hydrazides</b> were higher, which was attributed to steric effects imposed by the resin...|$|R

40|$|Nitrogen-containing {{molecules}} are {{ubiquitous in}} both natural products and pharmaceutical drugs, thus an efficient method {{for the formation}} of these motifs is of great importance. Hydroamination, that is the addition of an N-H bond across an unsaturated carbon-carbon bond of an alkene or alkyne, stands out as a potential approach to obtain such molecules.

In efforts directed towards metal-free alternatives, we have developed a simple, metal-free hydroamination of alkenes using <b>hydrazides.</b> Further investigation into the corresponding reactivity of alkynes with <b>hydrazides</b> has provided access to novel azomethine imine products.

40|$|New <b>hydrazides</b> were {{synthesized}} {{in search}} for specific inhibitors of bovine serum amine oxidase: a series of benzoic and phenylacetic acid <b>hydrazides</b> containing the 1 H-imidazol- 1 -yl or the 1 H-imidazol- 1 -ylmethyl group as (o, m, p) -substituent in the phenyl ring; an analogous series of p-substituted phenylhydrazides with 5 or 6 -membered heterocyclic ring as substituent, {{and a series of}} similar phenylpropionic <b>hydrazides.</b> The longer and more flexible phenylacetic <b>hydrazides,</b> and to a somewhat lesser extent the phenylpropionic ones, were better specific inhibitors of bovine serum amine oxidase than the benzoic <b>hydrazides,</b> which were also bound by the enzyme with high affinity, but at a slow rate. Derivatives with p- and m -substituents were more reactive than the o-substituted ones. The chemical nature of the substituent was less important than its position in the phenyl ring and the presence of methylene spacers. These data point to the presence of a hydrophobic site at short distance from the protein carbonyl cofactor, so that simultaneous interaction of the 2 ends of the inhibitor molecule can occur at the 2 sites. The presence of the hydrophobic site was confirmed by the capability of some molecule deprived of the hydrazidic group to act as mild inhibitors. All <b>hydrazides</b> were less reactive by 2 - 3 orders of magnitude towards pig kidney diamine oxidase and FAD-dependent monoamine oxidase from rat brain mitochondria, while the other compounds showed similar inhibition power against all proteins.
