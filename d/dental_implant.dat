5|$|Primary implant {{stability}} {{refers to}} the stability of a <b>dental</b> <b>implant</b> immediately after implantation. The stability of the titanium screw implant in the patient's bone tissue post surgery may be non-invasively assessed using resonance frequency analysis.

5|$|The {{design of}} {{implants}} has {{to account for}} a lifetime of real-world use in a person's mouth. Regulators and the <b>dental</b> <b>implant</b> industry have created a series of tests to determine the long-term mechanical reliability of implants in a person's mouth where the implant is struck repeatedly with increasing forces (similar in magnitude to biting) until it fails.|$|E
5|$|After an implant is placed, the {{internal}} components {{are covered with}} either a healing abutment, or a cover screw. A healing abutment passes through the mucosa, and the surrounding mucosa is adapted around it. A cover screw is {{flush with the surface}} of the <b>dental</b> <b>implant,</b> and is designed to be completely covered by mucosa. After an integration period, a second surgery is required to reflect the mucosa and place a healing abutment.|$|E

5|$|An {{increasingly}} common strategy to preserve bone and reduce treatment times includes {{the placement of}} a <b>dental</b> <b>implant</b> into a recent extraction site. On the one hand, it shortens treatment time and can improve aesthetics because the soft tissue envelope is preserved. On the other hand, implants may have a slightly higher rate of initial failure. Conclusions on this topic are difficult to draw, however, because few studies have compared immediate and delayed implants in a scientifically rigorous manner.|$|E

Within the root form type of implant, there are roughly 18 variants, all made of titanium but with different shapes and surface textures.

30|$|In this paper, we {{reported}} {{a case of}} ORN arising around <b>dental</b> <b>implants</b> placed before radiotherapy. This is the third such case report to be published. Granström et al. reported three cases of ORN developing around <b>dental</b> <b>implants</b> previously placed for skin-penetrating prosthesis [8].

500|$|A <b>dental</b> <b>implant</b> (also {{known as}} an endosseous implant or fixture) is a {{surgical}} component that interfaces with the bone of the jaw or skull to support a dental prosthesis such as a crown, bridge, denture, facial prosthesis or {{to act as an}} orthodontic anchor. The basis for modern dental implants is a biologic process called osseointegration, in which [...] materials such as titanium form an intimate bond to bone. The implant fixture is first placed so that it is likely to osseointegrate, then a dental prosthetic is added. A variable amount of healing time is required for osseointegration before either the dental prosthetic (a tooth, bridge or denture) is attached to the implant or an abutment is placed which will hold a dental prosthetic.|$|E

30|$|A {{recent report}} made a bold {{statement}} that <b>dental</b> <b>implants</b> {{also can be}} a cause of cancer by providing a “route of entry for squamous cell carcinoma” [4], and another report stated that <b>dental</b> <b>implants</b> can lead to SCC in at-risk patients [5]. The incidence of malignances associated with <b>dental</b> <b>implants</b> seems to be extremely low. Bhatavadekar [6] calculated the theoretical standardized incidence ratio (SIR) to be 0.0017 per million per year.

40|$|The {{nature of}} <b>dental</b> <b>implants</b> as a {{treatment}} plan for patients is often viewed as something relatively new, {{but the idea of}} <b>dental</b> <b>implants</b> has long been a part of history. Dating back as far as the Mayan civilization, <b>dental</b> <b>implants</b> have increasingly become prevalent in modern society. As time progressed, various modern forms of <b>dental</b> <b>implants</b> materialized, with the first of these being the eposteal implant. Post 1943, the eposteal <b>dental</b> <b>implants</b> were then replaced by the more novel transosteal implants, and then followed by the current implant model, the endosteal implant. Presently, in the US alone, there are upwards of 700, 000 implants being inserted annually so there is no question of the impact <b>dental</b> <b>implants</b> have, and will continue to have, on dentistry and quality of life for patients. Implants are often evaluated in terms of success versus survival, where "success" is denoted if a particular implant meets the success criteria it is being evaluated with, while "survival" simply means the implant exists in the mouth. The impasse that arises here is that the two terms of success and survival are so closely intertwined that implant success can be misrepresented, and wrongfully thought of as ubiquitous among all patients. This literature review takes a comprehensive look at <b>dental</b> <b>implants,</b> and proceeds to evaluate associated case studies as well as posit how implants affect modern day dentistry...|$|R
500|$|In the 1950s {{research}} was being conducted at Cambridge University in England on blood flow in living organisms. These workers devised {{a method of}} constructing a chamber of titanium which was then embedded into the soft tissue of the ears of rabbits. In 1952 the Swedish orthopaedic surgeon, Per-Ingvar Brånemark, was interested in studying bone healing and regeneration. During his research time at Lund University he adopted the Cambridge designed [...] "rabbit ear chamber" [...] {{for use in the}} rabbit femur. Following the study, he attempted to retrieve these expensive chambers from the rabbits and found that he was unable to remove them. Brånemark observed that bone had grown into such close proximity with the titanium that it effectively adhered to the metal. Brånemark carried out further studies into this phenomenon, using both animal and human subjects, which all confirmed this unique property of titanium. Leonard Linkow, in the 1950s, {{was one of the first}} to insert titanium and other metal implants into the bones of the jaw. Artificial teeth were then attached to these pieces of metal. In 1965 Brånemark placed his first titanium <b>dental</b> <b>implant</b> into a human volunteer. He began working in the mouth as it was more accessible for continued observations and there was a high rate of missing teeth in the general population offered more subjects for widespread study. He termed the clinically observed adherence of bone with titanium as [...] "osseointegration".|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study aims at {{applying}} cDNA microarray {{analysis in}} vitro for establishing and comparing the osteogenic properties of <b>dental</b> <b>implants</b> with different surface characteristics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Saos- 2 osteoblasts were cultured in bottom-cone tubes in presence of 5 different <b>dental</b> <b>implants</b> with various surface characteristics. Cells adherent to <b>dental</b> <b>implants</b> were detached and RNA purified. The expression of 18, 401 genes was tested by cDNA microarray. RESULTS: The number and viability of cells adherent to different <b>dental</b> <b>implants</b> varied {{but without any}} significant statistical difference. Conversely, gene expression was revealed {{to be a more}} sensitive biomarker being remarkably different in cells adherent to different <b>implants.</b> The 5 <b>dental</b> <b>implants</b> significantly modulated the expression of 14 osteogenic activities mainly including bone morphogenetic proteins, osteomodulin, and osteoprotegerin. CONCLUSION: Despite no significant differences having been found in in vitro cell number and viability, cells adherent to 5 differently surfaced implants showed different gene expression profiles. Thus, to evaluate osteogenesis as related to <b>dental</b> <b>implants,</b> it is important to analyze not only the number of adherent cells but also the activation of genes encoding for osteogenic activities...|$|R
