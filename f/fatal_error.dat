5|$|Although {{dismissive of}} Young's work {{even before he}} had read it, Champollion {{obtained}} {{a copy of the}} Encyclopedia article. Even though he was suffering from a failing health, and the chicanery of the Ultras kept him struggling to maintain his job, it motivated him to return in earnest {{to the study of the}} hieroglyphs. When he was eventually removed from his professorship by the Royalist faction, he finally had the time to work on it exclusively. While he awaited trial for treason, he produced a short manuscript, De l'écriture hiératique des anciens Égyptiens, in which he argued that the hieratic script was simply a modified form of hieroglyphic writing. Young had already anonymously published an argument to the same effect several years earlier in an obscure journal, but Champollion, having been cut off from academia, had probably not read it. In addition Champollion made the <b>fatal</b> <b>error</b> of claiming that the hieratic script was entirely ideographic. Champollion himself was never proud of this work and reportedly actively tried to suppress it by buying the copies and destroying them.|$|E

25|$|By modern {{standards}} CP/M was primitive, {{owing to}} the extreme constraints on program size. With version 1.0 there was no provision for detecting a changed disk. If a user changed disks without manually rereading the disk directory the system would write on the new disk using the old disk's directory information, ruining the data stored on the disk. Starting with 1.1 or 1.2 this danger was reduced: if one changed disks without reading the new disk's directory, and tried to write to it, the operating system would signal a <b>fatal</b> <b>error,</b> avoiding overwriting but requiring a reboot (which took {{no more than a}} few seconds, but entailed losing whatever data you were trying to save).|$|E
500|$|During 1945, the Second World War {{came to a}} {{close and}} a new postwar Labour government, headed by Clement Attlee, came to power in Britain. The {{incoming}} Attlee government's initial stance on defence was that no major conflict would occur for at least a decade, and thus there would be no need to develop or to procure any new aircraft until 1957. In accordance with this policy, aside from a small number of exceptions such as what would become the Hawker Sea Hawk for the Royal Navy, the majority of Specifications issued by the Air Ministry for fighter-sized aircraft during the late 1940s were restricted to research purposes. Aviation author Derek Wood refers to this policy as being: [...] "a <b>fatal</b> <b>error</b> of judgement which was to cost Britain a complete generation of fighters and heavy bomber aircraft".|$|E
500|$|Spurs {{followed}} their title win with a second-place {{finish in the}} 1951–52 season, but then went into a sharp decline, finishing 10th in 1952–53 and 16th in 1953–54. The slump was partly because the players who had formed {{the spine of the}} championship-winning side were losing their fitness—push-and-run required players of exceptional physical condition, and Ramsey, Nicholson, Burgess and others were all past 30. Ramsey was furthermore affected by a recurring abdominal injury. His preference for ball play rather than simply clearing it became unpopular among sections of Tottenham's support. A particularly low ebb came in the 1952–53 FA Cup semi-final, against Blackpool at Villa Park on 21 March 1953. Ramsey had played well, keeping the Blackpool left-winger Bill Perry quiet, and with only a minute to spare the game was finely balanced at 1–1. Ramsey then made a <b>fatal</b> <b>error.</b> Having easily beaten Perry to a cross-field pass from a free-kick, he set himself to slide the ball back to the goalkeeper Ditchburn in a situation when most defenders would have cleared it. The ball bounced off Ramsey's knee and ran away from him, allowing Blackpool forward Jackie Mudie to score. Blackpool won 2–1, and went on to win what is commonly referred to as the [...] "Matthews Final".|$|E

500|$|When Cornwallis reached Portsmouth, {{he began}} embarking troops {{pursuant}} to Clinton's orders. [...] On July 20, with some transports {{almost ready to}} sail, new orders arrived that countermanded the previous ones. [...] In the most direct terms, Clinton ordered him to establish a fortified deep-water port, using as much of his army as he thought necessary. Clinton took this decision because the navy had long been dissatisfied with New York as a naval base, firstly because sand bars obstructed {{the entrance to the}} Hudson River, damaging the hulls of the larger ships; and secondly because the river often froze in winter, imprisoning vessels inside the harbour. [...] Arbuthnot had recently been replaced and to show his satisfaction at this development, Clinton now acceded to the Navy's request, despite Cornwallis's warning that the Chesapeake's open bays and navigable rivers meant that any base there [...] "will always be exposed to sudden French attack." [...] It was to prove a <b>fatal</b> <b>error</b> of judgement by Clinton, since the need to defend the new facility denied Cornwallis any freedom of movement [...] Nevertheless, having inspected Portsmouth and found it less favourable than Yorktown, Cornwallis wrote to Clinton informing him that he would fortify Yorktown.|$|E

Writing on the Los Angeles Times opinion page, Schou said, [...] "Webb asserted, improbably, that the Blandón-Meneses-Ross drug ring opened 'the first pipeline between Colombia's cocaine cartels and the black neighborhoods of Los Angeles,' helping to 'spark a crack explosion in urban America.'
