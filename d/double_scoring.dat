5|$|In {{the sixth}} inning, the Yankees cut the Cardinals' lead. With two outs, Joe Dugan hit a single. Hank Severeid {{followed}} with a <b>double,</b> <b>scoring</b> Dugan, before pinch-hitter Ben Paschal grounded to Haines to end the inning. Game1 and 5 winner Herb Pennock came in relief for Hoyt in the seventh inning. He yielded only one hit in the inning and limited the Cardinals to their 3–2 lead. In {{the bottom half of}} the inning, the Yankees loaded up the bases with Earle Combs, Ruth and Lou Gehrig. At this point, there were two outs, and Haines had developed a blister on his pitching hand, and could no longer pitch in the game.|$|E
5|$|The {{start of}} the 2015 season {{marked the first time}} that the Sounds played at the new {{downtown}} First Tennessee Park, which is located at the former site of the historic Sulphur Dell ballpark. The Sounds defeated the Colorado Springs Sky Sox, 3–2 in 10 innings, in the inaugural home opener in front of an announced paid attendance of 10,459. First baseman Max Muncy secured the win with a walk-off RBI <b>double,</b> <b>scoring</b> Billy Burns from first base, before being mobbed by his Sounds teammates on the field. Under manager Steve Scarsone, Nashville finished their first season as an A's affiliate in third place with a 66–78 record. Barry Zito, who won the American League Cy Young Award in 2002, made his return to professional baseball with the Sounds in 2015 after sitting out the 2014 season. Zito was lauded by his Nashville teammates for embracing the Triple-A lifestyle and for his commitment to the team: charting pitches between starts, coaching first base, and even buying dinner for the entire team on his birthday.|$|E

25|$|Creese {{was also}} a {{consistent}} bowler, taking 401 wickets for the county at a bowling average of 27.78, with 15 five wicket hauls and 1 ten wicket haul in a match, with best bowling figures of 8/37 against Lancashire in 1936. The 1936 season was Creese's best with the ball, during which he took 95 wickets {{at an average of}} 22.93, with 5 five wicket hauls and best figures of 8/37. It was during the 1936 season that Creese narrowly missed out on the all-rounders <b>double,</b> <b>scoring</b> 1,331 runs and coupled with 95 wickets, bringing him just short of the 1,000 runs and 100 wickets mark. In addition to his batting and bowling, Creese {{was also a}}n able fielder, taking 190 catches for Hampshire.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the season}} started, {{a number of}} Southern League teams, {{including}} Nashville, participated in exhibition games against clubs from the National League. On March 24, the Tigers faced the St. Louis Browns, a 9–0 loss which Nashville forfeited. That April, they participated in a two-game exhibition series against the Baltimore Orioles. In {{the first game of}} the series, Baltimore's George Treadway hit a <b>double,</b> <b>scoring</b> John McGraw in the first inning. Tredway added to their lead with a home run in the sixth. McGraw was hit by a pitch in the eighth and later scored on Harry Stovey's triple. The Orioles outscored Nashville by a final tally of 3–0. During the fourth inning of the next day's game, the umpire was removed due to the Baltimore club disagreeing with some of his calls. He was replaced by Tom Vickery, Nashville's pitcher from the previous day's contest. The game was called in the ninth inning due to darkness, resulting in a tie score (9–9).|$|E
500|$|One notable {{moment in}} MLB [...] history {{came in the}} final game of the 1951 series. Entering {{the bottom of the ninth}} inning the New York Giants were {{trailing}} the Dodgers 4–1. Al Dark and Don Mueller each singled to put runners at the corners. Whitey Lockman hit a <b>double,</b> <b>scoring</b> Dark to make the game 4–2. Finally, Bobby Thomson hit a walk-off home run which has come to be known as the [...] "Shot Heard 'Round the World" [...] to give the Giants the 5–4 victory and the National League pennant. ESPN's SportsCentury ranked it as the second greatest game of the 20th century.|$|E

500|$|Brad Lidge {{came into}} the game for the ninth inning, popping out Matsui and {{striking}} out Jeter before surrendering a two-out single to Damon—after a nine-pitch at bat with two strikes and four foul balls. Then, with Teixeira batting, Damon stole second and, on the same play, also stole third as the base was uncovered due to a defensive shift against Teixeira. Several news outlets referred to this as a [...] "mad dash", which Mike Vaccaro of the New York Post compared to Enos Slaughter's [...] "Mad Dash" [...] in the 1946 World Series. Some believed that Damon's play caused Lidge to avoid throwing his best pitch—a slider with sharp downward movement—for {{the rest of the}} inning, as it risked a wild pitch that would have allowed Damon to score from third base. Teixeira was then hit by a pitch and Rodriguez put the Yankees ahead with a <b>double,</b> <b>scoring</b> Damon. Posada added to that lead with a single that scored Teixeira and Rodriguez, but was thrown out at second to end the inning. Mariano Rivera entered {{in the bottom of the}} ninth and saved the game for the Yankees on eight pitches for his second save of the series.|$|E
500|$|The {{weather was}} poor during the 1907 season, {{resulting}} in a succession of pitches which suited spin bowling and were difficult to bat on. In these circumstances, Hirst scored fewer runs {{than in the previous}} season. He did not score a century, making 1,321 runs at 28.71, and the prevalent type of pitches did not suit his bowling pace so that he took fewer wickets. Even so, he was the second highest wicket-taker in the season and came fifth in the bowling averages, with 183 wickets at 15.29. Hirst remained a first-choice member of the Test team, playing all three matches against [...] South Africa that summer in a series which England won 1–0, with the other two games drawn. Although unsuccessful with the bat, achieving 46 runs in five innings with a top-score of 17, in a low-scoring second Test, Hirst {{was one of the few}} batsmen to handle the googlies of Aubrey Faulkner. As a bowler he took 10 wickets at 18.50; of these wickets, six were in the final match of the series. Yorkshire won the County Championship again during the 1908 season. Hirst completed another <b>double,</b> <b>scoring</b> 1,598 runs at 38.97 and taking 174 wickets at 14.05, but was not selected for any other representative games until the end of the season. However, he declined an invitation to tour Australia with the MCC team in 1907–08.|$|E
2500|$|This was {{the third}} {{straight}} game in which neither team hit a home run, the first such occurrence in a World Series since [...] The Giants opened the scoring in the second, starting with Hunter Pence's single and Brandon Belt's bunt base hit. After Travis Ishikawa flied out to center to advance both runners, Brandon Crawford grounded out to second, with Pence scoring. Crawford then recorded an RBI single to right in the fourth, allowing Pablo Sandoval to score from second base to give San Francisco a 2–0 lead. Kansas City starter James Shields was relieved by Kelvin Herrera after pitching six innings. Herrera kept the score at 2–0 in the seventh. But in the eighth, Sandoval and Pence led off with back-to-back singles, and Herrera was then relieved by Wade Davis. Juan Pérez hit a one-out <b>double,</b> <b>scoring</b> Sandoval and Pence, with Pérez reaching third base on a throwing error by Royals shortstop Alcides Escobar. Pérez had learned of his friend Oscar Taveras having died {{in the middle of}} the game and broke down in tears. He dedicated the double to Oscar, posting a tweet. Crawford then recorded his third RBI of the game with a single to left to score Pérez to make it 5–0.|$|E

This family or benchmark of scoring systems {{can be used as}} a benchmark against which the efficiency of any <b>doubles</b> <b>scoring</b> system can be assessed. Thus, the formula for the efficiency of any <b>doubles</b> <b>scoring</b> system is derived. As in tennis singles, one scoring system based on the play-the-loser structure is shown to be more efficient than the benchmark systems. An expression for the relative efficiency of two <b>doubles</b> <b>scoring</b> systems is derived. Thus, the relative efficiency of the various scoring systems presently used in doubles can be assessed. The methods of this paper can be extended to a match between two teams of 2, 4, 8, …doubles pairs, so that it is possible to establish a measure for the relative efficiency of the various systems used for tennis contests between teams of players...|$|R
2500|$|The Heat had {{previously}} won only 25 games, but had drafted young talent such as Dwyane Wade and Caron Butler.

On March 6, Odom posted a triple <b>double,</b> <b>scoring</b> 30 points with 19 rebounds and 11 assists in a home win against the Sacramento Kings. The Heat would go on to the clinch the 4th seed in the playoffs, facing off the New Orleans Hornets in the first round.
