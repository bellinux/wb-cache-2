5|$|Gilly {{was later}} seen using his new look {{in attempt to}} get the {{affections}} of Steph Cunningham (Carley Stenson). After failing he acted out of character and struck up a scam date with Cheryl Brady (Bronagh Waugh) to make Steph jealous but it back-fired when his false tooth came loose in Cheryl's mouth. He later has relationships with Cheryl and Jem Costello (Helen Russell-Clark). Another change implemented during this period was a dramatic change to the character's appearance after new series producer Lucy Allan and Quinlan came to a mutual decision to transform his hairstyle by shaving <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>off,</b> a stark contrast as during his early years he was constantly seen with long hair.|$|E
25|$|Hurst, meanwhile, was {{routinely}} dormant in the league, but was {{the leading}} cup goalscorer in England (both FA Cup and League Cup) until his records were broken some 30 years later by Robbie Fowler. Originally a midfielder, Greenwood converted {{him to be a}} front-running striker and it paid dividends—he led the team to consecutive cup appearances before capping <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>off,</b> becoming a regular England international and FIFA World Cup winner in 1966. In the following season, he scored 41 goals in the league, nearly a quarter of his eventual tally.|$|E
25|$|After {{spending}} a year serving the mandatory {{time in the}} military, Petrović followed his brother's footsteps and moved to Cibona to form, at that time, the best backcourt duo in Europe. The very first year in Cibona he won both the Yugoslav League championship and the Yugoslav National Cup. To top <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>off,</b> the 87–78 victory over the Spanish League club Real Madrid, to which Petrović contributed with 36 points, brought him and Cibona their first European Cup title. The second came the following year, as Petrović scored 22 points and Cibona defeated the USSR Premier League club Žalgiris Kaunas, which starred the legendary Arvydas Sabonis. The same year brought another Yugoslav national cup title for Cibona, seeing Petrović score 46 against the old rival Bosna. In 1987, Petrović earned his third European trophy: a 2nd-tier European Cup Winners' Cup title against the Italian League club Scavolini Pesaro, whose net he filled with 28 points.|$|E

Afterwards, he informs her that he doesn't want to pursue things further, which she takes in stride to his face, passing <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>off</b> as a light fling, but looks visibly shaken after he leaves. He decides to stay with Branka and is soon informed by her that she's pregnant so the parents quickly set about organizing a wedding. Meanwhile, Giga decides to call on his Pomoravlje paisano connections {{in order to find}} Saša a job. He wants to track down his old friend Jataganac who's now a powerful politically connected party-installed business manager. Though he manages to get Jataganac's attention after much wrangling, the whole thing eventually goes pear-shaped when Giga refuses to swallow his pride when Jataganac shows up four hours late to the dinner at Popadić's house.|$|E
500|$|Robert Copsey from Digital Spy {{gave the}} single {{five out of}} five stars. Copsey praised Kesha for not {{buckling}} under the harsh scrutiny she has been subject to over {{the length of her}} career, citing her boozy antics and processed vocals as areas that have been criticized. He wrote, [...] "we've never disputed that she carries <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>off</b> in a fashion that's frank, fearless and unashamedly fun." [...] The song's chorus was highlighted in the review, with Copsey calling it [...] "her poppermost effort to date" [...] that contained [...] "bouncy Dr Luke beats and her usual bubblegum melodies".|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{video for}} [...] "Take It Off" [...] premiered on Vevo on August 3, 2010. [...] It {{was directed by}} Paul Hunter and Dori Oskowitz. Kesha revealed the main idea behind the video in an interview explaining that [...] " [...] about [...] and all [...] hot vampire babe friends breaking into a hotel on another planet, {{and at the end}} we all turn into this beautiful stardust. Once you take <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>off,</b> all your inhibitions, your clothes, we're all made up of the same thing." [...] She explained that she did not want the video to just be about [...] "Taking it off", that the message behind the video and the theme wasn't [...] "just about taking off your clothes and rolling in glitter. It's also about taking off your inhibitions and being raw and real".|$|E

500|$|The {{opening track}} [...] "No Church in the Wild" [...] {{features}} a cinematic production style. Singers Frank Ocean and The-Dream lend their voices to the album's grim opener, which sets the mood with a gnarled guitar sample. Over the rock-centric, rolling production, both rappers muse over familiar themes of loyalty, sexuality and maternal solidarity. The pop-oriented [...] "Lift Off" [...] features baroque strings and a chorus sung by Beyoncé Knowles, accompanied with synthesizers. The song contains horns and martial drums as Knowles sings, [...] "We gon' {{take it to}} the moon/ Take it to the stars." [...] "Niggas in Paris" [...] incorporates staccato orchestration and fizzing industrial noise, topping <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>off</b> with a menacing beat and icy synthesizer notes. The track features an unusual sampling of dialogue from the 2007 film Blades of Glory, notably the [...] "we're gonna skate to one song and one song only" [...] line. West and Jay-Z's lyrics frame their rags to riches story on the song.|$|E
500|$|Following its {{premature}} release on the Web, the music video for [...] "You and I" [...] met with positive reviews. Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone felt the video was {{an improvement over}} her earlier videos, Judas and The Edge of Glory, saying, [...] "the best moments of the video put a distinctly Gaga-ish spin on the iconography of Americana and traditional love stories." [...] Jillian Mapes of Billboard wrote the video has: [...] "torture contraptions, mermaid sex, a wedding, bondage in a barn, an ice cream truck, and to top <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>off,</b> 'Children of the Corn' and religious overtones thrown in for good measure," [...] and thought [...] the video setting was the strangest representation of Nebraska. Leah Collins of Dose felt the video was a [...] "great opportunity for the singer to finally find out what it's like to make out with herself." [...] Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly noted of the scene in which Gaga plays a piano in a cornfield beside her male alter ego: [...] "She's just Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta, playing a piano {{in the middle of}} a corn field—with a little making out on the side, of course." [...] Gil Kaufman of MTV News believed that Gaga was not joking when she talked about the video being about the [...] "torture" [...] of being away from the one you love. [...] "And, man, based on the bruising final product, she wasn't kidding," [...] Kaufman concluded.|$|E

Tunstall said, [...] "I had an amazing three weeks recording in Hansa in Berlin in January and am finishing <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>off</b> in London."

2500|$|In March 1996 {{the band}} {{set up in}} Bristol for eight weeks to record new songs which Hussey had been developing. When the {{resulting}} album, Blue, was released, it received mixed review from music critics but left portions of the old fanbase rather unimpressed. Future interviews would see Hussey hating the album, with only the reworked B-side [...] "Evermore & Again" [...] ever becoming a regular staple in subsequent tours. A short stint around the UK, Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands afterwards {{turned out to be}} a farewell tour: After ten years, Hussey and Brown decided that enough is enough. The band finished <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>off</b> with festivals in Spain and South Africa, the latter being their final gig at the Kyalami racetrack in Johannesburg.|$|E

2500|$|Laura Jane Silverman III (Laura Silverman) – Sarah's {{younger sister}} (in real life, her older sister), is a {{registered}} nurse. Their parents died when they were young, and Sarah is the only family that Laura has. Laura is very susceptible to guilt, making Sarah's manipulation of her remarkably easy. She is more responsible than Sarah and devotes {{most of her life}} to taking care of her. In the first episode, she tells Jay that she can eat 30 hard-boiled eggs in one sitting. She used to have a large amount of pubic hair (like her mother) until the episode [...] "Patriot Tact" [...] where she shaves <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>off</b> after her mother came to her in a vision to tell her it is alright to shave.

2500|$|Since {{its initial}} release, Whut? Thee Album has risen in stature, {{and has been}} {{regarded}} as a hip hop classic from several music critics and writers. In 1998, it {{was included in the}} Source magazine's 100 Best Rap Albums list. In 2000, Melody Maker gave the album 4½ out of 5 stars, while calling it a [...] "landmark hip-hop album". Allmusic's Steve Huey gave the album 4½ out of 5 stars, stating [...] "Whut? Thee Album is a terrific debut that established Redman {{as one of the top}} MCs on the East Coast. His aggressive delivery is more than hardcore enough for the streets, but Whut? is first and foremost a party record ... He's able to carry <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>off</b> with a singular sense of style, thanks to a wild sense of humor that results in some outlandish boasts, surreal threats, and hilarious left-field jokes." [...] In 2008, Henry Adaso from About.com ranked Whut? Thee Album number five on his Best Rap Albums of 1992 list, and number 32 on his 100 Greatest Hip-Hop Albums list.|$|E
2500|$|Richard Eisenbeis of Kotaku praised Sinon's role in Sword Art Online II, {{describing}} her as [...] "easily the deepest character {{to come out}} of Sword Art Online".

[...] In reviewing the second episode of the Sword Art Online II anime, Salvador GRodiles of Japanator.com wrote that [...] "Sinon isn't a pushover in battle" [...] and is also [...] "a force to be reckoned with", and found her character to be enjoyable. In concluding his review of Sword Art Online II, Sinon's character and story were praised again, writing [...] "Overall, A-1 were able to wrap up Sword Art Online IIs Phantom Bullet nicely. We got to see Shino slowly recover from her trauma and the show did a decent job in explaining the process behind Shinkawa and his older brother's evil scheme – even if their scheme had some far-fetched elements.

2500|$|Officially debuting in September 2002, the BA Falcon {{was a major}} {{update of}} the AU, with Ford {{designers}} and engineers almost wiping the board clean, {{and in the process}} spending just over AU$500 million, a figure much larger than previously anticipated. The BA Falcon won the prestigious Wheels Car of the Year Award (COTY) in 2002. Its range comprised the following models: XT (formerly Forté), Futura, Fairmont, Fairmont Ghia, XR6 and XR8. Major elements of the overhaul included the development of a more effective Control-Blade independent rear suspension, a significant revamp of the car's inline 6-cylinder engine as well as two new V8 engines and, to top <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>off,</b> new transmissions. Design wise, the BA received a completely new look, with designers giving both the front and rear quarters of the car substantial work, resulting in much more contemporary, European-style design. The BA also introduced a thoroughly remodelled interior, whereby the 'oval shaped' instrument cluster was replaced with a more conservatively styled cluster. It featured a large LCD screen, situated in a [...] "satin finished" [...] centre console (Called the [...] "Interior Command Centre" [...] or ICC in short). Within a year of its release, Falcon sales had increased substantially and, for a time, eclipsed Holden Commodore sales.|$|E
2500|$|In the Wu-Tang Manual, {{a book by}} the RZA on {{the origins}} of the Wu-Tang Clan, he recalls a concert at which Biggie and Wu-Tang both performed, at which Raekwon and Ghostface were {{reportedly}} under the influence, and angry at some comments B.I.G. made in The Source. In RZA's view, had the artists and their entourages met up that night, things could have gotten violent, but nothing of the sort ever occurred. It is worth mentioning that on B.I.G.'s final studio album Life After Death he took a shot back at Raekwon on the song [...] "Kick in the Door" [...] (which was a diss song to several other rappers as well) with the line; [...] "Fuck that, why try/Throw bleach in ya eye" [...] which was a response to lyrics from Raekwon's song [...] "Ice Water", where Raekwon rhymed; [...] "...To top <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>off,</b> beefin' for White/Pullin' bleach out, tryin'a throw it in my eyesight." [...] On the posthumous 1997 song [...] "Victory," [...] released on Puff Daddy's album No Way Out, B.I.G. also rhymes, [...] "Militant/Y'all faggots ain't killin' shit," [...] in response to a Ghostface Killah line on the song [...] "Criminology" [...] where he raps; [...] "RZA baked the track and it's militant/Then I react like a convict, and start killin' shit." [...] It is also worth mentioning that B.I.G. chose RZA to produce the track [...] "Long Kiss Goodnight", a song allegedly aimed at Biggie's longtime rival Tupac Shakur, which appeared on Life After Death.|$|E

He faded after a bright start {{and was replaced by}} Shaun Wright-Phillips after 57 minutes as England recovered from a goal down to beat Egypt 3–1 at Wembley Stadium. His performance came under heavy criticism from Chris Waddle who said of Walcott, [...] "I've never seen him develop. He just doesn't understand the game for me – where to be running, when to run inside a full back, when to just play a one-two. <b>It's</b> <b>all</b> <b>off</b> the cuff.
