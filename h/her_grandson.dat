5|$|After {{the death}} of <b>her</b> <b>grandson</b> in August 1963, Calment lived on her own from age 88 until shortly before her 110th birthday, {{when she decided to}} move to a nursing home. Her move was precipitated by the winter of 1985 which froze the water pipes in her house (she never used heating in the winter) and caused {{frostbite}} in her hands. According to one of her doctors, she had hitherto been healthy but began showing signs of senescence (or aging) at this point.|$|E
5|$|In October 1920, she {{returned}} to Athens on the fatal illness of <b>her</b> <b>grandson,</b> King Alexander.

5|$|In {{nineteenth century}} England, the breed flourished under the {{patronage}} of Queen Victoria. Her many Pugs, which she bred herself, included Olga, Pedro, Minka, Fatima and Venus. Her involvement with dogs in general helped {{to establish the}} Kennel Club, which was formed in 1873. Queen Victoria favoured apricot and fawn colours. Queen Victoria's passion for Pugs was passed on to many {{other members of the}} Royal family, including <b>her</b> <b>grandson</b> King George V and his son King Edward VIII. Many responded to the breed's image of anti-functionalism and diminutive size during this period.|$|E

5|$|The executions and attainders of Essex and Blount {{led to a}} {{legal dispute}} over the Countess of Leicester's {{remaining}} property. In this context she claimed that Blount, {{in the process of}} paying off Leicester's debts, had squandered her jewels and much of her landed wealth. The death of ElizabethI in 1603 meant some form of rehabilitation for the Countess; the new monarch, James I, not only restored <b>her</b> <b>grandson,</b> the third Earl of Essex, to his father's title and estate, but quickly cancelled the rest of her debts to the Crown, almost £4,000.|$|E
5|$|Two {{years after}} his first wife was murdered, Andrew married Yolanda de Courtenay, who was born around 1198. Their only child, Yolanda, was born around 1219 and married James I of Aragon. Andrew's third wife, Beatrice D'Este, was about twenty-three when they married in 1234. She {{gave birth to a}} son, Stephen, after Andrew's death.

5|$|As {{much of her}} {{property}} had been confiscated by the Soviet Union and the Greek republican government, most of her estate comprised jewelry reported in The Times to be worth £100,000 (equivalent to more than £ today). This was shared between her children {{and the children of}} Constantine I. Traumatized by the events of the Russian Revolution, Olga wished to sever all ties with the country in which her family had been massacred. Before dying, she made <b>her</b> <b>grandson,</b> King George II, swear to repatriate the ashes of her daughter Princess Alexandra, buried in the Peter and Paul Cathedral in Saint Petersburg. Her wish was fulfilled in 1940 after his restoration to the Greek throne.|$|E

5|$|At first, Queen Victoria opposed any {{engagement}} because Hélène was Roman Catholic. Victoria {{wrote to}} <b>her</b> <b>grandson</b> suggesting {{another of her}} grandchildren, Princess Margaret of Prussia, as a suitable alternative, but nothing came of her suggestion, and once Albert Victor and Hélène confided their love to her, the Queen relented and supported the proposed marriage. Hélène offered to convert to the Church of England, and Albert Victor offered to renounce his succession rights to marry her. To the couple's disappointment, her father refused to countenance the marriage and was adamant she could not convert. Hélène travelled personally to intercede with Pope Leo XIII but he confirmed her father's verdict, and the courtship ended. She later became the Duchess of Aosta.|$|E

5|$|Julia's suspicions {{regarding}} Macrinus' {{involvement in}} the death of Caracalla led to her championing the case of <b>her</b> <b>grandson,</b> Elagabalus, as the rightful emperor. At the time Elagabalus was the chief priest of the Phoenician god Elagabal in Emesa. The soldiers nearby frequently visited the temple where Elagabalus was chief priest, to watch him perform his rituals and ceremonies. At one of these visits, Julia Maesa took the opportunity to inform the soldiers, it is not known whether truthfully, that Elagabalus was Caracalla's son. Simultaneously, she may have seen the opportunity to use her family's wealth and prestige to set in motion her plot.|$|E

5|$|As queen, she {{was very}} popular, both in Romania and abroad. In 1926, Marie and two of her {{children}} undertook a diplomatic tour of the United States. They were received enthusiastically by the people and visited several cities before returning to Romania. There, Marie found that Ferdinand was gravely ill and he died a few months later. Now queen dowager, Marie refused {{to be part of}} the regency council which reigned over the country under the minority of <b>her</b> <b>grandson,</b> King Michael. In 1930, Marie's eldest son Carol, who had waived his rights to succession, deposed his son and usurped the throne, becoming King Carol II. He removed Marie from the political scene and strived to crush her popularity. As a result, Marie moved away from Bucharest and spent the rest of her life either in the countryside, or at her home by the Black Sea. In 1937, she became ill with cirrhosis and died the following year.|$|E
5|$|In 1309 Sir Nicholas de Boys {{granted the}} manor of Shalden to Robert de Kendale and his wife, Margaret, {{along with her}} heirs. The manor was then held by Ralph le Mareschal indefinitely. He was still holding it in 1310, however it had passed to Robert de Kendale {{sometime}} before 1316. Robert died in 1330, and his son Edward succeeded to the manor, but it was held by his widow Margaret until her death in 1347. Sir Edward de Kendale died in 1373, leaving a widow and a son as his heir for the manor of Shalden. Edwards's son and his brother, Thomas, both died without issue in 1375. Sir Robert Turk and his wife, Beatrice, conveyed the manor in 1376–7 to Sir William Croyser and William Bukbridge, trustees of Sir Edward de Kendale, to whom they transferred {{it in the same}} year. Edward's widow Elizabeth, daughter of Sir William Croyser, soon married Sir Thomas Barre, and died in 1420.

5|$|In August 1914, Olga was in Russia at the {{outbreak}} of World War I, in which the Allied or Entente Powers including Russia, Britain and France fought against the Central Powers including Germany, Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire. She decided to stay in Saint Petersburg and establish a military hospital to support the Russian war effort. Olga created a clinic at Pavlovsk Palace where she cared for wounded soldiers with her sister-in-law, Grand Duchess Elizabeth Mavrikievna. Other members of the imperial family, such as Princess Helen and Olga's granddaughter Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna founded field hospitals at the front. As the war continued, Olga {{became aware of the}} growing crisis in Russia, and attempted to warn Tsarina Alexandra in 1916 of the danger of revolution but the Russian empress refused to listen. A few weeks later, Olga attracted the fury of the Tsarina after signing a petition asking for a pardon for <b>her</b> <b>grandson,</b> Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich, who had been exiled to the Persian front for his involvement in the assassination of Alexandra's favorite mystic, Grigori Rasputin.|$|E

5|$|Much of {{the money}} left after Sarah's {{numerous}} bequests was inherited by <b>her</b> <b>grandson,</b> John Spencer, with the condition {{that he could not}} accept a political office under the government. He also inherited the remainder of Sarah's numerous estates, including Wimbledon. Marlborough House remained empty for fourteen years, with the exception of James Stephens, one of her executors, before it became the property of the Dukes of Marlborough upon Stephens's death. In 1817, it became a royal residence, and passed through members of the British royal family until it became the Commonwealth Secretariat in 1959. Wimbledon Park House succumbed to fire in 1785; and Holywell House, Sarah's birthplace in St Albans, was demolished in 1827. Today, much of St Albans is named after the Marlboroughs because of Sarah's influence.|$|E
5|$|On 14 January 1892, {{six weeks}} after the formal engagement, Albert Victor died of pneumonia, leaving George second in line to the throne, and likely to succeed after his father. George had only just {{recovered}} from a serious illness himself, after being confined to bed for six weeks with typhoid fever, the disease that was thought to have killed his grandfather Prince Albert. Queen Victoria still regarded Princess May as a suitable match for <b>her</b> <b>grandson,</b> and George and May grew close during their shared period of mourning. A year after Albert Victor's death, George proposed to May and was accepted. They married on 6 July 1893 at the Chapel Royal in St James's Palace, London. Throughout their lives, they remained devoted to each other. George was, on his own admission, unable to express his feelings easily in speech, but they often exchanged loving letters and notes of endearment.|$|E
