40|$|The <b>global</b> <b>area</b> <b>covered</b> with {{transgenic}} (genetically modified) crops has rapidly increased {{since their}} introduction in the mid- 1990 s. Most of these crops have been rendered herbicide resistant, {{for which it}} can be envisaged that the modification {{has an impact on}} the profile and level of herbicide residues within these crops. In this article, the four main categories of herbicide resistance, including resistance to acetolactate-synthase inhibitors, bromoxynil, glufosinate and glyphosate, are reviewed. The topics considered are the molecular mechanism underlying the herbicide resistance, the nature and levels of the residues formed and their impact on the residue definition and maximum residue limits (MRLs) defined by the Codex Alimentarius Commission and national authorities. No general conclusions can be drawn concerning the nature and level of residues, which has to be done on a case-by-case basis. International residue definitions and MRLs are still lacking for some herbicide–crop combinations, and harmonisation is therefore recommende...|$|R

40|$|Heat waves {{represent}} one of {{the most}} significant climatic stressors for ecosystems, economies and societies. A main topic of debate is whether they have increased or not in intensity and/or their duration due to the observed climate change. Firstly, this is because of the lack of reliable long-term daily temperature data at the global scale; secondly, because of the intermittent nature of such phenomena. Long datasets are required to produce a reliable and meaningful assessment. In this study, we provide a global estimate of heat wave magnitudes based on the three most appropriate datasets currently available, derived from models and observations (i. e. the 20 th Century Reanalyses from NOAA and ECMWF), spanning the last century and before. The magnitude of the heat waves is calculated by means of the Heat Wave Magnitude Index daily (HWMId), taking into account both duration and amplitude. We compare the magnitude of the most severe heat waves occurred across different regions of the world and we discuss the decadal variability of the larger events since the 1850 s. We concentrate our analysis from 1901 onwards, where all datasets overlap. Our results agree with other studies focusing on heat waves that have occurred in the recent decades, but using different data. In addition, we found that the percentage of <b>global</b> <b>area</b> <b>covered</b> by heat wave exceeding a given magnitude has increased almost three times, in the last decades, with respect to that measured in the early 20 th century. Finally, we discuss the specific implications of the heat waves on the river runoff generated in the Alps, for which comparatively long datasets exist, affecting the water quality and availability in a significant portion of the European region in summer.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} value of {{observed}} river discharge data for global-scale hydrological modeling {{of a number of}} flow characteristics that are e. g. required for assessing water resources, flood risk and habitat alteration of aquatic ecosystems. An improved version of the WaterGAP Global Hydrology Model (WGHM) was tuned against measured discharge using either the 724 -station dataset (V 1) against which former model versions were tuned or an extended dataset (V 2) of 1235 stations. WGHM is tuned by adjusting one model parameter (γ) that affects runoff generation from land areas in order to fit simulated and observed long-term average discharge at tuning stations. In basins where γ does not suffice to tune the model, two correction factors are applied successively: the areal correction factor corrects local runoff in a basin and the station correction factor adjusts discharge directly the gauge. Using station correction is unfavorable, as it makes discharge discontinuous at the gauge and inconsistent with runoff in the upstream basin. The study results are as follows. (1) Comparing V 2 to V 1, the <b>global</b> land <b>area</b> <b>covered</b> by tuning basins increases by 5...|$|R

The QBO and ENSO signals in the double tropopause and tropical upwelling as well as their influence on the statistical relationships are also presented. The analysis is based on both reanalysed data (ERA-Interim) and satellite data. Significant anticorrelations were found between the <b>area</b> <b>covered</b> by DTs and the total column ozone in the midlatitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. This relationship is confirmed by a large positive correlation between the <b>areas</b> <b>covered</b> by ozone laminae and double tropopause events as found in the HIRDLS satellite dataset. Significant anticorrelations were also found between the <b>global</b> <b>area</b> of double tropopause events and the near global (50 &deg; S– 50 &deg; N) water vapour in the lower stratosphere. The correlations of DT variables with total column ozone and ozone laminae are both consistent with the poleward displacement of tropical air with lower ozone mixing ratio and with tropospheric intrusions of tropical tropospheric air into the lower extratropical stratosphere.

40|$|To better {{integrate}} lotic ecosystems into global {{cycles and}} budgets, we provide approximations of the size-distribution and areal extent of streams and rivers. One approach we used was to employ stream network theory combined with data on stream width.

Our estimates of <b>global</b> fluvial <b>area</b> are 485 000 to 662 000 km 2 and are + 30 – 300 % of published appraisals. Moderately sized rivers (orders 5 – 9) seem to comprise the greatest <b>global</b> <b>area,</b> with less <b>area</b> <b>covered</b> by low and high order streams, while global stream length, and therefore the riparian interface, is dominated by 1 st order streams.

40|$|The {{results of}} a new {{multispectral}} infrared retrieval scheme for obtaining fractional cloud cover and 11 micrometer emissivity {{with those of the}} spatial coherence method which obtains fractional cloud cover assuming that the clouds are opaque at infrared wavelengths. Both methods are applied to 4 -km NOAA advanced very high resolution radiometer <b>global</b> <b>area</b> coverage data for 250 -km-scale regions containing single-layered marine stratocumulus off the coast of South America. The average 11 micrometer emissivity for low level clouds is found to be between 0. 70 and 0. 85. The low emissivity is evidently due to the thinning of clouds at their edges. Semitransparent cloud edges evidently make up {{a substantial portion of the}} <b>area</b> <b>covered</b> by such clouds. This result indicates that cloud cover obtained using the spatial coherence method is underestimated by 0. 1 to 0. 2, as has been claimed in a previous study. The fractional cloud cover for the ensemble of 250 -km-scale regions studied here increased slightly from 0. 60 for daytime observations to 0. 63 for nighttime observations. The 11 micrometer emissivity also increased slightly, but about half of the increase was related to the increase in cloud cover and a decrease in the relative <b>area</b> <b>covered</b> by cloud edge material. Presumably, the other half was due to an increase in cloud liquid water. Cloud height showed no significant change.
