30|$|The two {{remaining}} income maintenance <b>experiments</b> <b>were</b> {{set up and}} administered by the US Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW and now Health and Human Services), and they were also started while the field work for the New Jersey <b>experiment</b> <b>was</b> ongoing. The HEW <b>experiments</b> <b>were</b> conducted in Gary, Indiana, and in Seattle, Washington and Denver, Colorado. Although similar to the original experiments, the Gary and Seattle-Denver experiments included slightly different benefit levels and implicit tax rates. 5 The Gary <b>experiment</b> <b>was</b> fielded from 1971 through 1975, and the Seattle-Denver <b>experiment</b> <b>was</b> fielded from 1971 through 1978.

5|$|Dr. Manheim recovers {{long enough}} to explain {{that he was doing}} {{experiments}} involving time, gravity, and funnels to other universes, and suspects his last <b>experiment</b> <b>is</b> running out of control. Manheim explains that he is trapped between two dimensions and Data determines that the experiment must be shut down during a time fluctuation or else it will simply grow larger. Manheim provides the crew with the correct coordinates to beam down to avoid the security fields. Picard admits to Jenice that he worried about losing her again after he left her in Paris, and vows to correct Dr. Manheim's experiment.|$|E
5|$|In 1871, William Benjamin Carpenter wrote a {{critical}} {{evaluation of the}} Crookes experiments with Home in the Quarterly Review. Carpenter wrote that although Crookes, his assistant and Sergeant Cox claimed to have observed the accordion float in the cage; Dr. Huggins did not testify to this, and no information was given to whether the keys and bellows were seen to move. According to Carpenter no solid explanation could be given until the <b>experiment</b> <b>is</b> repeated, however, he suggested that the accordion feat that Home performed {{may have been a}} conjuring trick achieved with one hand. Carpenter concluded that Crookes should repeat the experiment in open daylight without the cage in the presence of other witnesses.|$|E

5|$|MacDougall stated his {{experiment}} {{would have}} to be repeated many times before any conclusion could be obtained. The <b>experiment</b> <b>is</b> widely regarded as flawed and unscientific due to the small sample size, the methods used, as well as the fact only one of the six subjects met the hypothesis. The case has been cited as an example of selective reporting. Despite its rejection within the scientific community, MacDougall's experiment popularized the concept that the soul has weight, and specifically that it weighs 21 grams.|$|E

The political agitators intend to overthrow the town council but Niklausse and Van Tricasse persuade them instead to attack a neighbouring town over an incident 700 years earlier involving a stray cow. Frantz is appointed the war leader for pledging to kill the most people.|$|E

25|$|There is {{also the}} {{practice}} of dry-labbing—which can occur in chemistry or other lab courses, in which the teacher clearly expects the experiment to yield certain results (which confirm established laws), so the student starts from the results and works backward, calculating what the experimental data should be, often adding variation to the data. In some cases, the lab report is written before the <b>experiment</b> <b>is</b> conducted—in some cases, the <b>experiment</b> <b>is</b> never carried out.
