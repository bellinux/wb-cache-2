40|$|<b>Fluctuating</b> asymmetry, small {{deviations}} from perfect bilateral symmetry, is {{negatively correlated with}} health and positively correlated with sexual selection in human adults, but the accumulation, persistence, and fitness implications of asymmetries during childhood are largely unknown. Here, we introduce the Jamaican Symmetry Project, a long-term study of <b>fluctuating</b> asymmetry and its physical and behavioral correlates in rural Jamaican children. The project {{is based on an}} initial sample of 285 children (156 boys and 129 girls), aged 5 to 11 years.

All traits except hand width showed <b>fluctuating</b> asymmetry. <b>Fluctuating</b> asymmetries of the legs tended to be related and were less than half as great as <b>fluctuating</b> asymmetries of the arms and ears. Therefore the legs may show high developmental stability resulting from selection for mechanical efficiency.

In experi-ment 1, 1, 073 birds were used from 2 generations with complete pedigree of the Quail Castellana breed to esti-mate the heritability for the <b>fluctuating</b> asymmetry at 36 wk of age. The estimated heritability of absolute fluctuat-ing asymmetry was not significantly different from zero for all 5 traits, and similar estimates were obtained for relative <b>fluctuating</b> asymmetry, directional asymmetry, transformed absolute and relative <b>fluctuating</b> asymmetry, and 3 alternative indexes of <b>fluctuating</b> asymmetry. The heritability of the combined absolute or relative fluctuat-ing asymmetry was still very low, indicating that fluctu-ating asymmetry was determined solely by environmen-tal sources of variation and that <b>fluctuating</b> asymmetry estimates should not be confounded by appreciable addi-tive genetic contributions.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Fluctuating</b> {{temperatures}} terminate {{seed dormancy}} in many species, including Cynara cardunculus (L.) var. sylvestris. Termination of physiological dormancy requires low ratios of abscisic acid (ABA) /gibberellins (GA). In a previous paper {{we have shown}} that physiological responses to <b>fluctuating</b> temperatures comprise a reduction of abscisic acid (ABA) content and sensitivity. However, a possible stimulation of GA synthesis was also suggested {{as part of the}} mechanism. That possible stimulation, as well as the identification of potential regulatory sites for ABA and GA metabolism and signalling involved in the termination of dormancy by <b>fluctuating</b> temperatures, are yet to be determined. In this study, we measured GA content and sensitivity in seeds incubated under constant and <b>fluctuating</b> temperatures. We also assessed the expression of several genes involved in ABA and GA metabolism and signalling. Our results show that <b>fluctuating</b> temperatures reduce ABA/GA ratios through a reduction in ABA accumulation during incubation but without altering GA synthesis as compared to that observed under constant temperatures. On the other hand, <b>fluctuating</b> temperatures did not increase sensitivity to GA. <b>Fluctuating</b> temperatures reduced the expression of CycaNCED and CycaABI 5 (ABA synthesis and signalling genes) with a temporal pattern that coincides with the interruption of ABA accumulation that precedes germination of seeds incubated under <b>fluctuating</b> temperatures. However, <b>fluctuating</b> temperatures did not modify the expression of CycaCYP 707 A 2 (ABA inactivation) as compared to that observed under constant temperatures. Consistent with our determinations of GA content and sensitivity, <b>fluctuating</b> temperatures did not modify the expression of GA synthesis (CycaGA 3 ox) and signalling genes (CycaRGL 2 and CycaGAI) in relation to that observed at constant temperatures. These results show that <b>fluctuating</b> temperatures terminate dormancy in Cynara cardunculus seeds through an interruption in ABA accumulation and a reduction in ABA signalling exerted at the level of CycaNCED and CycaABI 5 expressio...|$|R

40|$|Boundary {{conditions}} for <b>fluctuating</b> wall temperature {{are required for}} near-wall heat transfer modeling. However, their correct specifications for arbitrary thermal boundary conditions are not clear. The conventional approach is to assume zero <b>fluctuating</b> wall temperature or zero gradient for the temperature variance at the wall. These are idealized specifications and the latter condition could lead to an ill posed problem for fully-developed pipe and channel flows. In this paper, the validity and extent of the zero <b>fluctuating</b> wall temperature condition for heat transfer calculations is examined. The approach taken is to assume a Taylor expansion in the wall normal coordinate for the <b>fluctuating</b> temperature that is general enough to account for both zero and non-zero value at the wall. Turbulent conductivity is calculated from the temperature variance and its dissipation rate. Heat transfer calculations assuming both zero and non-zero <b>fluctuating</b> wall temperature reveal that the zero <b>fluctuating</b> wall temperature assumption is in general valid.

40|$|Shade-establishing plants {{growing in}} the forest {{understory}} are exposed to constant high light or <b>fluctuating</b> light when gaps are created by fallen trees. Our previous studies indicate that photosystem I (PSI) is sensitive to constant high light in shade-establishing tree species, however, the effects of <b>fluctuating</b> light on PSI and photosystem II (PSII) in shade-establishing species are little known. In the present study, we examined the responses of PSI and PSII to <b>fluctuating</b> light in comparison to constant high light in the shade-establishing species Psychotria henryi. Accompanying with significant activation of cyclic electron flow (CEF), the P 700 oxidation ratio was maintained at high levels when exposed to strong light either under <b>fluctuating</b> light or constant high light. Under moderate <b>fluctuating</b> light, PSI and PSII activities were remained stable in P. henryi. Interestingly, PSI was insusceptible to <b>fluctuating</b> light but sensitive to constant high light in P. henryi. Furthermore, both PSI and PSII were more sensitive to constant high light than <b>fluctuating</b> light. These results suggest that CEF is essential for photoprotection of PSI under <b>fluctuating</b> light in P. henryi. Furthermore, photoinhibition of PSI under high light in P. henryi is more related to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species rather than to P 700 redox state, which {{is different from the}} mechanisms of PSI photoinhibition in Arabidopsis thaliana and rice.
