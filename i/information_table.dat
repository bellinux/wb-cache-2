25|$|During 2008, {{a rolling}} {{programme}} of transmitter updates caused approximately 250,000 set-top boxes {{to stop working}} altogether. Freeview had warned consumers {{in advance of the}} update, which was phased over a three-month period. The problem affected a specific range of older units, and was caused by an increased Network <b>Information</b> <b>Table</b> (channel list) exceeding the memory available in some set-top boxes. This {{had been part of the}} specification that was available and implemented in the very early OnDigital boxes, but not in those using the SetPal chip set. Affected consumers were advised to buy new set-top boxes.|$|E
25|$|For recent genealogy, exact {{matching}} on the mtDNA {{full sequence}} {{is used to}} confirm a common ancestor on the direct maternal line between two suspected relatives. Because mtDNA mutations are very rare, a nearly perfect match is not usually considered relevant {{to the most recent}} 1 to 16 generations. In cultures lacking matrilineal surnames to pass down, neither relative above is likely to have as many generations of ancestors in their matrilineal <b>information</b> <b>table</b> as in the above patrilineal or Y-DNA case: for further information on this difficulty in traditional genealogy, due to lack of matrilineal surnames (or matrinames), see Matriname. However, the foundation of testing is still two suspected descendants of one person. This hypothesize and test DNA pattern is the same one used for autosomal DNA and Y-DNA.|$|E

2500|$|Several {{series of}} the show have been {{released}} on 2-disc DVDs in both Europe and North America with the final series 8 also released on Blu-ray in Germany but with the cut 50 minute versions.

A revised edition was released some time afterwards. The revised edition has a 15 certificate whereas the cut DVD has a PG certificate.

40|$|Abstract: Many {{real world}} {{problems}} deal with ordering of objects instead of classifying objects, although majority {{of research in}} machine learning and data mining {{has been focused on}} the latter. Examples of such problems are ordering of consumer products produced by different manufactures, ranking of universities, and so on. Typically, an overall ordering of objects is given. In this paper, we formulate the problem of mining ordering rules as finding association between orderings of attribute values and the overall ordering of objects. An example of ordering rules may state that “if the value of an object x on an attribute a is ordered ahead of the value of another object y on the same attribute, then x is ordered ahead of y”. For mining ordering rules, the notion of <b>information</b> <b>tables</b> is generalized to ordered <b>information</b> <b>tables</b> by adding order relations on attribute values, and rough set theory based algorithms are then used...|$|R
