25|$|<b>Future</b> <b>value</b> of an annuity (FVA): The <b>future</b> <b>value</b> of {{a stream}} of {{payments}} (annuity), assuming the payments are invested at a given rate of interest.|$|E
25|$|The {{formula for}} {{the present value of}} a regular stream of future {{payments}} (an annuity) is derived from a sum of the formula for <b>future</b> <b>value</b> of a single future payment, as below, where C is the payment amount and n the period.|$|E
25|$|The 1970s saw the {{development}} of the financial futures contracts, which allowed trading in the <b>future</b> <b>value</b> of interest rates. These (in particular the 90‑day Eurodollar contract introduced in 1981) had an enormous impact on {{the development}} of the interest rate swap market.|$|E

25|$|The {{operation}} of evaluating a present value into the <b>future</b> <b>value</b> is called capitalization (how much will $100 today be worth in 5 years?). The reverse operation which consists {{in evaluating the}} present value of a future amount of money is called a discounting (how much $100 that will be received in 5 years- at a lottery, for example -are worth today?).|$|E
25|$|For example, £100 {{invested}} for one year, earning 5% interest, will {{be worth}} £105 after one year; therefore, £100 paid now and £105 paid exactly one year later both have the same value to a recipient who expects 5% interest assuming that inflation would be zero percent. That is, £100 invested for one year at 5% interest has a <b>future</b> <b>value</b> of £105 {{under the assumption that}} inflation would be zero percent.|$|E
25|$|Previously, Canopy Growth {{had been}} {{operating}} {{at a loss}} (-$3.3 million in income in 2015, for example) partly because it was using funds for production expansion and to acquire competitors in preparation for significantly increased cannabis demand by the recreational use market in early 2018. Even after the 2015 results had been published, some analysts remained positive about the company's <b>future</b> <b>value.</b> For example, in early December 2016, Reuter's survey of four market analysts had indicated a consensus rating of Buy. Prior {{to the release of}} the 2016 results, the company had a valuation of $1.6 billion. On 2 February 2017, Canopy shares had more than tripled in the previous 12 months, and stood at $10.20 at 11:10 a.m. on the Toronto Stock Exchange (ticker WEED).|$|E

25|$|In 1923, the Northern Rhodesian copper {{industry}} was little developed, and the British {{government did not}} anticipate the <b>future</b> <b>value</b> of these mineral rights. It regarded them as a not {{very important part of}} the overall deal with the company. The lack of any challenge to the BSAC's claims and the decision not to refer them to the Privy Council led to suspicion that the company received favoured treatment. There were family links between a junior Colonial Office minister and the BSAC director leading its negotiations, but no evidence to suggest this led to any bias. The most probable explanation is that the importance of the minerals was overlooked in the haste to achieve a settlement. Because of lack of time, the agreement was not approved by the Attorney-General.|$|E
25|$|The President of the United States of America takes {{pleasure}} in presenting the Legion of Merit to Rear Admiral Richard Evelyn Byrd Jr. (NSN: 0–7918), United States Navy, for exceptionally meritorious conduct {{in the performance}} of outstanding services to the Government of the United States while in command of a Special Navy Mission to the Pacific from August 27, 1943, to December 5, 1943, when thirty-three islands of the Pacific were surveyed or investigated for the purpose of recommending air base sites of value to the United States for its defense or for the development of post-war civil aviation. In this service Admiral Byrd exercised fine leadership in gaining the united effort of civilian, Army, and Navy experts. He displayed courage, initiative, vision, and a high order of ability in obtain data and in submitting reports which will be of great present and <b>future</b> <b>value</b> to the National Defense and to the Government of the United States in the post-war period.|$|E
25|$|The July 2016 {{release of}} the Pokémon Go mobile app by Niantic caused shares in Nintendo to double, due to {{investor}} misunderstanding that the software was the property of Nintendo. Later that month, Nintendo released a statement clarifying its relation with Niantic, Nintendo stated it owned 32% of Pokémon intellectual property owner The Pokémon Company, and though it would receive some licensing and other revenues from the game it expected the impact on Nintendo's total income to be limited. As {{a result of the}} statement Nintendo's share price fell substantially, losing 17% in one day of trading. After a reduction in shareprice from the Pokémon Go peak, the company was still valued at over 100 times its net income, a price–earnings ratio greatly exceeding the average on the Nikkei 225. Analysts speaking to Bloomberg L.P. and the Financial Times both commented on the potential <b>future</b> <b>value</b> of Nintendo's IP if transferred to the mobile phone game business.|$|E
5000|$|To {{implement}} implicit lazy thread-specific futures (as {{provided by}} Alice ML, for example) in terms in non-thread-specific futures, needs {{a mechanism to}} determine when the <b>future's</b> <b>value</b> is first needed (for example, the [...] construct in Oz).

25|$|Since those {{involved}} with the production {{had no idea of}} the <b>future</b> <b>value</b> of the stop-motion puppet figures used in the production, many were not preserved. Rankin claimed in 2007 to be in possession of an original Rudolph figure. Nine other puppets—including Santa and young Rudolph—were given to a secretary, who gave them to family members. Eventually seven were discarded. In 2005, the remaining two puppets of Rudolph and Santa were appraised on Antiques Roadshow; the episode aired in 2006 on PBS. At that time, their appraised value was between $8,000 and $10,000. The puppets had been damaged through years of rough handling by children and storage in an attic. Toy aficionado Kevin Kriess bought Santa and Rudolph in 2005; in 2007, he had both puppets restored by Screen Novelties, a Los Angeles-based collective of film directors specializing in stop motion animation with puppet fabricator Robin Walsh leading the project. The figures have been shown at conventions since then.|$|E

500|$|Alternatively, SRECs {{allow for}} a market {{mechanism}} to set {{the price of the}} solar generated electricity subsity. [...] In this mechanism, a renewable energy production or consumption target is set, and the utility (more technically the Load Serving Entity) is obliged to purchase renewable energy or face a fine (Alternative Compliance Payment or ACP). The producer is credited for an SREC for every 1,000kWh of electricity produced. If the utility buys this SREC and retires it, they avoid paying the ACP. In principle this system delivers the cheapest renewable energy, since the all solar facilities are eligible and can be installed in the most economic locations. [...] Uncertainties about the <b>future</b> <b>value</b> of SRECs have led to long-term SREC contract markets to give clarity to their prices and allow solar developers to pre-sell and hedge their credits.|$|E
