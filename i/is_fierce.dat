5|$|Today, {{the city}} is home {{of two of the}} country's oldest {{professional}} football teams: Aston Villa F.C., which was founded in 1874 and plays at Villa Park; and Birmingham City F.C., which was founded in 1875 and plays at St Andrew's. Rivalry between the clubs <b>is</b> <b>fierce</b> and the fixture between the two is called the Second City derby. Aston Villa are 7-time First Division champions and the 1982 European Champions, but currently play in the Championship following their relegation from the Premier League in the 2015–16 season. Birmingham City also currently play in the Championship.|$|E
5|$|There {{are eight}} public and one private {{universities}} in Hong Kong, the oldest being the University of Hong Kong (HKU), established in 1910–1912. The Chinese University of Hong Kong {{was founded in}} 1963 to fulfill {{the need for a}} university with a medium of instruction of Chinese. Competition among students to receive an offer for an undergraduate programme <b>is</b> <b>fierce</b> as the annual number of intakes is limited, especially when some disciplines are offered by select tertiary institutions, like medicine which is provided by merely two medical schools in the territory, the Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine at the University of Hong Kong and the Faculty of Medicine of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. In addition to the public post-secondary institutions there are also a number of private higher institutions which offer higher diplomas and associate degree courses for those who fail to enter a college for a degree study so as to boost their qualification of education, some of whom can have a second chance of getting into a university if they have a good performance in these sub-degree courses.|$|E

While the on-ice {{competition}} <b>is</b> <b>fierce,</b> the Leafs-Habs rivalry is symbolic of the rivalry between Canada's two largest cities: Toronto and Montreal, and by extension its two major linguistic groups, anglophones and francophones and their status as hubs for English Canada and French Canada, respectively.|$|E
25|$|In the Talmud, there <b>is</b> <b>fierce</b> {{dispute about}} whether or not the term mamzer {{included}} a child who had a Jewish mother, and a father who is either non-Jewish or a slave (or both); although the Talmud eventually concludes that this is not the case, a number of scholars now suspect that this was actually the original definition of mamzer. Abraham Geiger, a prominent Jewish scholar and rabbi of the mid 19th century, suggested that the etymological origin of mamzer might be ma'am zar, which means belonging to a foreign people.|$|E
25|$|Some {{medical schools}} offer {{graduate}} entry programmes, which are four years long. The name {{refers to the}} fact that students on these courses already have a degree in another subject (i.e. they are graduates). Due to the shorter length of the course, the timetable of these degrees are more intense and the holidays are shorter, compared to students on the 5-year course. In terms of entrance requirements, the 4-year degree restricts entry to those who already hold a first degree, and have previously worked in an area of healthcare. The first degree doesn't necessarily have to be a BSc degree (this is the criteria for some of the medical schools), whereas other medical schools specify that the prior degree has to be in a science subject. Competition for this course <b>is</b> <b>fierce,</b> with students having to also sit an entrance exam prior to being considered for an interview.|$|E

25|$|The USC Trojans {{participate}} in Division I FBS of the NCAA {{as a member}} of the Pac-12 Conference and have won 123 total team national championships, 97 for men and 26 for women, including non-NCAA championships. Of this total, 80 and 14 are NCAA National Championships for men and women, respectively. The NCAA does not include college football championships in its calculation. Though there are multiple organizations that name national championships, USC claims 11 football championships. The men's 361 Individual Championships are the second-best in the nation and 53 ahead of third place, Texas Longhorns. USC's cross-town rival is the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), with whom there <b>is</b> <b>fierce</b> athletic and scholastic competition. USC's rivalry with University of Notre Dame predates the UCLA rivalry by three years. The Notre Dame rivalry stems mainly from the annual football game played between these two universities and is considered one of the greatest rivalries in college athletics.|$|E

500|$|Chhinnamasta is {{a goddess}} of contradictions: she [...] "is both {{the food and}} the eater of food, thereby symbolizing the whole world by this act of being devoured and the devourer. The {{dichotomy}} of receiver and giver or object and subject collapses into one." [...] Most of her epithets listed in her nama-stotra (name-hymn, which enlists the names of a deity) convey marvel and fury; few names are erotic or peaceful, which are contrary to Chhinnamasta's fierce nature and appearance. Her sahasranama (thousand name-hymn) echoes paradoxes; she is Prachanda-Chandika ("the powerfully fierce one") as well as Sarvananda-pradayini ("the prime giver of all ananda or bliss"). Her names convey the idea that though she <b>is</b> <b>fierce</b> at first appearance, she can be gentle upon worship.|$|E

Vanessa Vance of Reel.com retrospectively noted, [...] "Jolie gained wide recognition for her role as the titular Gia, and it's easy to see why. Jolie <b>is</b> <b>fierce</b> in her portrayal—filling the part with nerve, charm, and desperation—and her role in this film is quite possibly the most beautiful train wreck ever filmed." [...] For the second consecutive year, Jolie won a Golden Globe Award and was nominated for an Emmy Award. She also won her first Screen Actors Guild Award.|$|E

In her review for The New York Times, Janet Maslin said that [...] "Mr. Fiennes gleefully captures Lenny's sleaziness while also showing {{there is something about}} this schlockmeister that is worth saving, despite much evidence to the contrary. As for Ms. Bassett, she looks great and radiates inner strength even without the bone-crunching physical feats to which she is often assigned." [...] Similarly, Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called Strange Days Bigelow's [...] "magnum opus", and added, [...] "In a film of striking performances, Bassett's is the standout—she <b>is</b> <b>fierce,</b> funny and heart rending". In contrast, Sizemore and Lewis were considered miscast in their roles. At the 22nd Saturn Awards, Bassett won Best Actress and Bigelow became the first woman to win the Best Director award.|$|E

The Carolina–Duke rivalry <b>is</b> <b>fierce,</b> particularly in men's college basketball. It {{is considered one of}} the most intense rivalries in all of sports: a poll conducted by ESPN in 2000 ranked the basketball rivalry as the third greatest North American sports rivalry, and Sports Illustrated on Campus named it the #1 [...] "Hottest Rivalry" [...] in college basketball and the #2 rivalry overall in its November 18, 2003 issue. The intensity of the rivalry is augmented by the proximity of the two universities—they are located only ten miles apart along U.S. Highway 15–501 (also known as Tobacco Road) or eight miles apart in straight-line distance. In addition, both Duke and Carolina are considered highly prestigious universities, which, coupled with their vastly different funding structures and cultures—Carolina is a public school while Duke is private—contributes to the ferocity of the rivalry.|$|E
2500|$|USC's {{most famous}} rival is UCLA, with whom there <b>is</b> <b>fierce</b> {{athletic}} and scholastic competition. Both universities are in Los Angeles and approximately [...] apart.

[...] The Trojans and Bruins also compete in a year-long all-sports competition for the Lexus Gauntlet Trophy. [...] Pranks between UCLA and USC were commonplace several decades ago. Both universities have cracked down on pranks since a 1989 incident when USC students released hundreds of crickets into the main UCLA library during finals week. Days before a clash between rivals UCLA and USC in 2009, the Bruins mascot was vandalized. It was splashed in cardinal and gold paint, USC's official colors sparking memories of pranks played in the years earlier. The week preceding the annual football matchup with UCLA is known as [...] "Troy Week" [...] and features a number of traditions including CONQUEST!

2500|$|After {{several years}} of {{retirement}} from the fashion industry, French designer Thierry Mugler served as the main costume designer for the tour. Knowles was attracted with {{his work at the}} Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute Gala, [...] "Superheroes, Fashion and Fantasy" [...] (2008), where several of his haute couture pieces were on display. Knowles immediately {{fell in love with the}} costumes and wanted to use them on her tour after her mother and designer Tina Knowles influenced her decision. She met with Mugler in Paris in September and started exchanging ideas with him, further designing costumes which were inspired by her love of music and life. She hired him as the designer for the tour costumes in November, 2008. Speaking about her collaboration, Knowles said, [...] "The best part about this tour is I'm working with Thierry Mugler, who is an icon and a legend, and I've been a fan." [...] Mugler wanted to capture the duality between being a woman and a warrior and understand these two sides with [...] own perception of both aspects while creating the costumes for Knowles and using the words [...] "Feminine. Free. Warrior. Fierce" [...] as inspiration. He felt, [...] "Sasha Fierce is another aspect of Beyoncé's personality, she <b>is</b> <b>Fierce</b> on stage and Beyoncé in real life... Beyoncé is a very sophisticated 'stage animal', which means that she is truly instinctive. Beyoncé expresses herself through the two aspects of her personality. On stage, there is Sasha Fierce and there is Beyoncé in her truest self." [...] He described the costumes as [...] "very elaborate" [...] and rooted in the songs' meanings. He conducted a 71-piece wardrobe for Knowles, her dancers and the band for the tour. For the shows, Knowles had ten different looks which were noted to be [...] "fierce" [...] as her onstage alter ego. She wore [...] "ferocious power-glam superheroine outfits for a one-two punch of femininity and fierceness". American fashion designer Chris March also collaborated with Knowles during the tour helping Mugler in the process of creating the costumes and making them usable for stage purposes as his expertise was execution of outfits. On July 23, 2009, March filled a lawsuit against Mugler for allegedly not paying him for the work he did on the wardrobe. Knowles' look captured a duality of soft and hard, combining bows with metal and incorporating fishnets, mismatched gloves and power shoulders into costumes that mirror Knowles' lyrics about [...] "all the single women" [...] femme fatales and power brokers in a [...] "high-tech Blade Runner world" [...] as stated by Michael Quintanilla of San Antonio Express-News. Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone magazine noted that the wardrobe designs consisted of a variety of gold sparkly leotards, all form-fitting, light-reflecting and leg-baring. Knowles also wore leopard-print pants and glow-in-the-dark bra with a blinking beacon affixed to her body. Joanna Horowitz of The Seattle Times wrote that the singer donned a series of curve-hugging leotards and mile-high stilettos, which were revealing her legs.
