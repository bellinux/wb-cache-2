50|$|Reflection high-energy {{electron}} diffraction (RHEED) is {{a technique}} used to characterize the surface of crystalline materials. RHEED systems gather information only from the surface layer of the sample, which distinguishes RHEED from other materials characterization methods that also rely on diffraction of high-energy electrons. Transmission electron microscopy, another common electron <b>diffraction</b> <b>method</b> samples {{the bulk of the}} sample due to the geometry of the system. Low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) is also surface sensitive, but LEED achieves surface sensitivity through the use of low energy electrons.|$|E

Polymers display varying degrees of crystallinity, and many are completely noncrystalline. Glass, some ceramics, and many natural materials are amorphous, not possessing any long-range order in their atomic arrangements. The study of polymers combines elements of chemical and statistical thermodynamics to give thermodynamic and mechanical, descriptions of physical properties.|$|E
50|$|His parents {{hoped that}} he would become a lawyer, but he became {{interested}} in chemistry while at school. Overcoming his parents' objections he enrolled as a chemistry undergraduate at the University of Vienna and completed his degree in 1936. Made aware by lecturer Fritz von Wessely of the advances being undertaken at the University of Cambridge into biochemistry by {{a team led by}} Gowland Hopkins, he asked Professor Marks who was soon to visit Cambridge to make inquiries to Hopkins about whether there would be a place for him. However Marks forgot. However he had visited J.D. Bernal, who was looking for a research student to assist him with studies into X-ray crystallography. Perutz was dismayed as he knew nothing about the subject. Marks countered by saying {{that he would}} soon learn. Bernal accepted him as a research student in his crystallography research group at the Cavendish Laboratory. His father had deposited £500 with his London agent to support him. He learnt quickly. Bernal encouraged him to use the X-ray <b>diffraction</b> <b>method</b> to study the structure of proteins. As protein crystals were difficult to obtain he used horse haemoglobin crystals, and began his doctoral thesis on its structure. Haemoglobin was a subject which was to occupy him for most of his professional career. He completed his Ph.D. under William Lawrence Bragg.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to compare the results of texture analyses of glaciolimnic sediments deposited in the basins of ice-dammed lakes origin in north eastern Poland. The study was carried out using aerometric method, pipette method and laser <b>diffraction</b> <b>method.</b> The studied soils were classified as Haplic and Mollic Vertisol, Vertic Cambisol, and Gleyic Chernozem. The soils were formed from clayey (clay, heavy clay), loamy (loam, clay loam, sand clay loam) and silty (silt loam, clay loam) deposits. The studied soils did not contain fractions > 2. 0 mm. The amounts of clay fraction (< 0. 002 mm) measured by areometric and pipette methods were similar and strongly correlated. In comparison to laser <b>diffraction</b> <b>method,</b> these amounts were 3 - 4 -fold higher. The sub-fraction of fine silt (0. 02 - 0. 002 mm) predominated in soil formations analyzed by laser <b>diffraction</b> <b>method.</b> In comparison to areometric or pipette method, the amounts of fine silt were 2 - 4 fold higher. Basing on the calculated sedimentological indices, it was stated that the examined soils were well sorted and the mean grain diameter (GSS) was very low and did not exceed 0. 005 mm in areometric and pipette methods, and 0. 011 mm in laser <b>diffraction</b> <b>method</b> for clay sediments...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to compare the effectiveness of a microscopy method with a laser <b>diffraction</b> <b>method</b> for measuring sarcomere lengths of chicken pectoralis major (p. major) muscle fibers exhibiting various contraction states. Chicken p. major muscles were excised from the animals at death. Samples of each muscle were treated with pH-buffered (5. 0 and 7. 5) isoionic CaCl 2, KCI, or ethylene glycol bis-(b-aminoethyl ether) N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) solutions in order to produce variability in the degree of fiber contraction. Sarcomere lengths (SL) of the fibers were observed using light microscopy and a laser <b>diffraction</b> <b>method.</b> The methods gave comparable results for sarcomere lengths greater than 1. 6 pm.

40|$|Abstract Intermetallic γ-TiAl based alloys are a novel {{class of}} {{lightweight}} structural materials that exhibit excellent high-temperature strength while having low density. These properties make them ideal candidates for replacing dense Ni base alloys currently {{used in the}} temperature range from 550 to 750 [*]°C. Therefore, extensive research activities were conducted during the last 20 years to make this innovative class of materials fit for service. In this task, <b>diffraction</b> <b>methods</b> have been an important tool for promoting the development of TiAl alloys. The ability to perform experiments in situ and to determine phase fractions even in cases where two phases are present in ultrafine lamellar structures are only two examples for applications in which <b>diffraction</b> <b>methods</b> are indispensable.
