5|$|It {{is often}} {{suggested}} that the Last Sonata, in B-flat major, is a farewell work in which Schubert faces his own death (somewhat analogous to the myths surrounding Mozart's Requiem); this is usually ascribed to the relaxed, meditative character which dominates the two opening movements. Death scenes are also associated, somewhat more explicitly, with the more tragic C minor Sonata; Charles Fisk, for example, mentions ghosts and a 'dance of death', in the outer movements. However, when judging from a biographical point of view, the notion that Schubert felt his imminent death {{at the time of}} composing the last sonatas <b>is</b> <b>questionable.</b>|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the extant}} {{information}} about {{the last few days}} of Poe's life comes from his attending physician, Dr. John Joseph Moran, though his credibility <b>is</b> <b>questionable.</b> Poe was buried after a small funeral at the back of Westminster Hall and Burying Ground, but his remains were moved to a new grave with a larger monument in 1875. The newer monument also marks the burial place of Poe's wife, Virginia, and his mother-in-law, Maria. Theories as to what caused Poe's death include suicide, murder, cholera, hypoglycemia, rabies, syphilis, influenza, and that Poe was a victim of cooping. Evidence of the influence of alcohol is strongly disputed.|$|E
5|$|The {{early works}} of Tevaram by the 7th-century poets Appar and Tirugnanasambandar mention {{the town had}} {{fortified}} walls, busy road building and a busy port. The inscriptions from the Kayarohanswami temple indicate the construction was initiated {{during the reign of}} the Pallava king, Narasimha Pallava II (691–729 CE). A Buddhist pagoda was built under Chinese influence by the Pallava king and the town was frequented by Buddhist travelers. Thirumangai Azhwar, the 9th century vaishnavite saint poet, is believed to have stolen the golden Buddha statue to fund the Ranganathaswamy Temple at Srirangam; the authenticity of the theory <b>is</b> <b>questionable.</b>|$|E

A 100% reflective statite deployed around the Sun would have an overall density of 0.78 grams per square meter of sail. To illustrate the low mass of the required materials, consider that the total mass of a bubble of such material 1 AU in radius would be about 2.17 kg, {{which is about the}} same mass as the asteroid Pallas.

5|$|The {{relationship}} between adapiform and lemuriform primates {{has not been}} clearly demonstrated, so the position of adapiforms as a paraphyletic stem group <b>is</b> <b>questionable.</b> Both molecular clock data and new fossil finds suggest that the lemuriform divergence from the other primates and the subsequent lemur-lorisoid split both predate the appearance of adapiforms in the early Eocene. New calibration methods may reconcile the discrepancies between the molecular clock and the fossil record, favoring more recent divergence dates. The fossil record suggests that the strepsirrhine adapiforms and the haplorhine omomyiforms had been evolving independently before the early Eocene, although their most basal members share enough dental similarities {{to suggest that they}} diverged during the Paleocene (66–55mya).|$|E
5|$|Warfarin {{is used to}} cull {{vampire bat}} populations in areas where human-wildlife {{conflict}} is a concern. Vampire bats are captured with mist nets and coated {{with a combination of}} petroleum jelly and warfarin. The bat returns to its roost {{and other members of the}} roost become poisoned as well by ingesting the warfarin after reciprocal grooming. Suspected vampire bat roosts may also be coated in the warfarin solution, though this kills other bat species and remains in the environment for years. The efficacy of killing vampire bats to reduce rabies transmission <b>is</b> <b>questionable,</b> however; a study in Peru showed that culling programs did not lead to lower transmission rates of rabies to livestock and humans.|$|E

5|$|Although {{these laws}} were relaxed over time, Emperor Wu renewed the state's {{persecution}} of merchants when in 119 BCE {{he made it}} illegal for registered merchants to purchase land. If they violated this law, their land and slaves would be confiscated by the state. The effectiveness of this law <b>is</b> <b>questionable,</b> since contemporary Han writers mention merchants owning huge tracts of land. A merchant who owned property worth a thousand catties of gold—equivalent to ten million cash coins—was considered a great merchant. Such a fortune was one hundred {{times larger than the}} average income of a middle class landowner-cultivator and dwarfed the annual 200,000 cash-coin income of a marquess who collected taxes from a thousand households. Some merchant families made fortunes worth over a hundred million cash, which was equivalent to the wealth acquired by the highest officials in government.|$|E
5|$|As a crop, the {{blackcurrant}} {{suffers from}} several pests and diseases. The most serious disease is reversion, {{caused by a}} virus transmitted by the blackcurrant gall mite. Another is {{white pine blister rust}} which alternates between two unrelated hosts, one in the genus Ribes (blackcurrant included) and the other a white pine. This fungus caused damage to forests when the fruit was first introduced into North America, where the native white pines have no genetic resistance to the disease. As a result, the blackcurrant has for most of the 20th century been subject to restrictions in parts of the United States as a disease vector. The effectiveness of these restrictions <b>is</b> <b>questionable,</b> since other Ribes species also host the disease and are native to North America.|$|E
5|$|Few {{inorganic}} lead(IV) compounds are known, {{and these}} exist only in highly acidic solutions. Lead(II) oxide gives a mixed oxide on further oxidation, Pb3O4. It {{is described as}} lead(II,IV) oxide, or structurally 2PbO·PbO2, and is the best-known mixed valence lead compound. Lead dioxide is a strong oxidizing agent, capable of oxidizing hydrochloric acid to chlorine gas. This is because the expected PbCl4 that would be produced is unstable and spontaneously decomposes to PbCl2 and Cl2. Analogously to lead monoxide, lead dioxide is capable of forming plumbate anions. Lead disulfide and lead diselenide are only stable at high pressures. Lead tetrafluoride, a yellow crystalline powder, is stable, but less so than the difluoride. Lead tetrachloride (a yellow oil) decomposes at room temperature, lead tetrabromide is less stable still, {{and the existence of}} lead tetraiodide <b>is</b> <b>questionable.</b>|$|E

5|$|Suspension bridge using iron chains: Although {{there is}} {{evidence}} that many early cultures employed the use of suspension bridges with cabled ropes, the first written evidence of iron chain suspension bridges comes from a local history and topography of Yunnan written in the 15th century, which describes the repair of an iron chain bridge during the reign of the Yongle Emperor (r. 1402–1424); although it <b>is</b> <b>questionable</b> if Ming Dynasty (1368–1644) Chinese claims that iron chain suspension bridges existed since the Han Dynasty, their existence in the 15th century predates that of anywhere else. K.S. Tom mentions this same repaired Ming suspension bridge described by Needham, but adds that recent research has revealed a document which lists the names of those who allegedly built an iron chain suspension bridge in Yunnan around the year 600 AD.|$|E
5|$|There are few {{surviving}} sources {{about the}} reign of Caligula, although he {{is described as a}} noble and moderate emperor during {{the first six months of}} his rule. After this, the sources focus upon his cruelty, sadism, extravagance, and sexual perversion, presenting him as an insane tyrant. While the reliability of these sources <b>is</b> <b>questionable,</b> it is known that during his brief reign, Caligula worked to increase the unconstrained personal power of the emperor, as opposed to countervailing powers within the principate. He directed much of his attention to ambitious construction projects and luxurious dwellings for himself, and initiated the construction of two aqueducts in Rome: the Aqua Claudia and the Anio Novus. During his reign, the empire annexed the Kingdom of Mauretania as a province.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{nomenclatural}} {{problems with the}} current use of the name Pachylemur. First, Filhol had himself used the name Pachylemur in 1874 {{for a group of}} primitive primates, including Adapis, that he considered intermediate between pachyderms and lemurs. Several other authors mentioned this name in the 19th and early 20th centuries, but it <b>is</b> <b>questionable</b> that any rendered the name available under the rules of zoological nomenclature. Still, this name potentially renders Pachylemur Lamberton, 1948, invalid under the Principle of Homonymy. In addition, the generic name Palaeochirogalus Grandidier, 1899, predates Pachylemur Lamberton, 1948, by half a century and thus takes precedence under the Principle of Priority, and Pachylemur Lamberton is itself unavailable because Lamberton failed to select a type species. To conserve the name Pachylemur, Jelle Zijlstra, Colin Groves, and Alex Dunkel submitted a petition to the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature in 2011. The petition asks the Commission to suppress the names Pachylemur Filhol, 1874, Pachylemur Palmer, 1904 (based on Filhol's name), and Palaeochirogalus Grandidier, 1899, and to make Pachylemur Lamberton, 1948, retroactively available with Lemur insignis as its type species.|$|E

5|$|In some cases, danger listing {{has sparked}} {{conservation}} efforts and prompted {{the release of}} funds, resulting in a positive development for sites such as the Galápagos Islands and Yellowstone National Park, {{both of which have}} subsequently been removed from the List of World Heritage in Danger. Despite this, the list itself and UNESCO's implementation of it have been the focus of criticism. In particular, States Parties and other stakeholders of World Heritage Sites have questioned the authority of the Committee to declare a site in danger without their consent. Until 1992, when UNESCO set a precedent by placing several sites on the danger list against their wishes, States Parties would have submitted a programme of corrective measures before a site could be listed. Instead of being used as intended, the List of World Heritage in Danger is perceived by some states as a black list and according to Christina Cameron, Professor at the School of Architecture, Canada Research Chair on Built Heritage, University of Montreal, has been used as political tool {{to get the attention of}} States Parties. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) notes that UNESCO has referenced the List of World Heritage in Danger (without actually listing the site) in a number of cases where the threat could be easily addressed by the State Party. The Union also argues that keeping a site listed as endangered over a long period <b>is</b> <b>questionable</b> and that other mechanisms for conservation should be sought in these cases.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} Domnall's {{rule in the}} kingdom is unknown, and it <b>is</b> <b>questionable</b> whether he had any real {{authority}} in the northern Hebrides, furthest from Mann. In about 1097, Magnús sent a delegate named Ingimundr into the Isles to take possession of the kingdom. After installing himself in Lewis, Ingimundr was overthrown and killed whilst attempting to usurp the kingship. Ingimundr's rationale for seating himself upon an island (Lewis and Harris) {{on the edge of}} the kingdom may have been due to the fact that he was unable to gain any authority on Mann itself. In fact, the chronicle reveals that civil war erupted there the following year, and the chronicler Orderic Vitalis (died c. 1142) indicates that Mann was devastated to point of being a virtual desert by the time Magnús appeared on the scene. The warring itself may have been related to the aforesaid factional struggles between Guðrøðr's sons. Although it is possible that it was Magnús who actually forced Domnall from the Isles, the fact the chronicle makes no mention of Domnall during the recorded conflict on Mann may be evidence that he had lost control of the island by then. Within the year, the same source records the arrival of Magnús himself, which could suggest that it was Ingimundr's slaying, at the hands of the Islesmen, that had incited Magnús to take matters into his own hands.|$|E
