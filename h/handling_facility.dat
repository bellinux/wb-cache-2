The material was then transported to CFB Shearwater, {{where it was}} assembled and inspected by over 350investigators from multiple organizations, such as the Transportation Safety Board of Canada, U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, U.S. Federal Aviation Authority (FAA), Air Accidents Investigation Branch, Boeing, Pratt & Whitney, and Swissair.|$|E

40|$|C {{does not}} have {{exception}} <b>handling</b> <b>facilities.</b> Errors are <b>handled</b> by examining the value returned by each function and signals (conditions reported to the program) are handled by using library functions. These approaches lead to ad hoc error-handling techniques and can make programs hard to understand. Exceptional C, a superset of C, provides exception <b>handling</b> <b>facilities.</b> Exceptional C integrates the two techniques used by C programmers (i. e., status values and signals) to handle errors into one unified exception handling mechanism. In this paper, I review exception handling models, specify the criteria used for designing the exception <b>handling</b> <b>facilities</b> in Exceptional C, and then describe these facilities.

An average of 220,000 ships visit the harbour each year, including both oceangoing vessels and river vessels, for both goods and passengers. The Kwai Chung Container Terminals {{in the western part of}} the harbour is the main container <b>handling</b> <b>facility,</b> operating round the clock and handling about 62 percent of the 21,930 TEUs handled by the territory in 2004.

500|$|The {{stations}} burned {{a mix of}} bituminous and anthracite coal. They consumed [...] of coal {{per week}} and had a peak consumption of [...] per week during the winter. They were well positioned to use coal from the Northumberland and County Durham coal fields. All of the coal used in the stations was brought to them via rail transport from UK coal stocks. Trains delivered coal to the station using the North Blyth Branch of the Blyth and Tyne Railway. The stations' coal <b>handling</b> <b>facility</b> was fitted with a Merry go Round (MGR) coal delivery system in 1981, after high capacity rapid discharge waggons became the British Rail standard. This system involved the trains slowly passing over a hopper and automatically discharging their cargo through doors underneath the train. Because of site space restrictions, a balloon loop track layout could not be constructed, so instead {{of being able to}} move continuously, trains arriving on site had to pull onto a reception track; the locomotive would then uncouple and recouple at the opposite end, before slowly moving over the unloading track hopper and discharging the coal and eventually leaving site. Towards the end of the station's operation, coal was more frequently brought in by road. All coal was delivered to and stored in a large open area {{to the north of the}} power stations. This had a tarmac barrier underneath it to prevent downward contamination. The coal was brought from the storage area to the station using a system of conveyor belts, which travelled over the Bedlington-Cambois Road separating the two sites, before being integrated to feed both stations as necessary.|$|E

The jetty could accommodate barges with carrying capacity of 1,000 tonne to 3,000 tonne. In addition to bunkering fuel and edible oil, other cargoes that are envisaged to be handled at the proposed facility include vegetable oil (crude and refined), furnace oil and molasses.|$|E

[...] In that phase, a new art <b>handling</b> <b>facility</b> was created on the south side of the building, enabling the museum to reclaim a street level entrance, closed since the mid-1970s, which leads to a 640-foot-long vaulted walkway that extends across the museum and is original to the 1928 building. This north entrance will be reopened to the public as a part of the [...] "core project", which is scheduled for completion in 2020. The core project also focuses on the interior of the current building and will add 90,000 square feet of public space, including 11,500 square feet of new gallery space for American art and contemporary art. [...] In addition, a new space called the forum will be created, along with dining and retail spaces.
