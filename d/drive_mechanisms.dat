25|$|Besides being {{far easier}} to handle, the wax {{recording}} media also allowed for lengthier recordings and created superior playback quality. The Graphophone designs initially deployed foot treadles to rotate the recordings which were then replaced by more convenient wind-up clockwork <b>drive</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and which finally migrated to electric motors, instead of the manual crank that was used on Edison's phonograph. The numerous improvements allowed for a sound quality that was significantly better than Edison's machine.|$|E
25|$|Hybrid {{table saws}} are {{designed}} {{to compete in the}} market with high-end contractor table saws. They offer some of the advantages of cabinet saws at a lower price than traditional cabinet saws. Hybrid saws on the market today offer an enclosed cabinet to help improve dust collection. The cabinet can either be similar to a cabinet saw with a full enclosure from the table top to the floor or a shorter cabinet on legs. Some hybrid saws have cabinet-mounted trunnions and some have table-mounted trunnions. In general, cabinet-mounted trunnions are easier to adjust than table-mounted trunnions. Hybrid saws tend to be heavier than contractor saws and lighter than cabinet saws. Some hybrid saws offer a sliding table as an option to improve cross cutting capability. Hybrid saw <b>drive</b> <b>mechanisms</b> vary more than contractor saws and cabinet saws. <b>Drive</b> <b>mechanisms</b> can be a single v-belt, a serpentine belt or multiple v-belts. Hybrid saws have a 1.5 or 2hp motor and thus the ability to run on a standard 15 or 20 amp 120 volt American household circuit, while a cabinet saw's 3hp or larger motor requires a 240 volt supply.|$|E

A second circuit receives the error signal and compares same with a threshold position error. The result of this comparison is used to selectively supply the second signal (i. e., speed) to the motor controller at least whenever the error signal is less than the threshold position error so that the motor controller can use the second signal in conjunction with the third signal to stop the motor...|$|R
25|$|The high {{temperature}} water coolant with boric acid dissolved in it is corrosive to carbon steel (but not stainless steel); this can cause radioactive corrosion products to circulate in the primary coolant loop. This not only limits the lifetime of the reactor, but the systems that filter out the corrosion products and adjust the boric acid concentration add significantly to the overall cost of the reactor and to radiation exposure. In one instance, this has resulted in severe corrosion to control rod <b>drive</b> <b>mechanisms</b> when the boric acid solution leaked through the seal between the mechanism itself and the primary system.|$|E

40|$|Natural orifice translumenal {{endoscopic}} surgery (NOTES) {{has reduced the}} invasiveness of surgery by eliminating external incisions on the patient. With this type of procedure, recovery time is drastically shortened, cosmetics are improved, and infections and pain are greatly reduced. For NOTES procedures to be successfully performed, a flexible endoscope or similar instrument is important for passing orifice flexures. However, technological deficiencies like poor angulations of surgical instruments introduced through working channels in flexible endoscopes, the lack of scope fixation, and lack of scope stiffening are technological barriers which prevent NOTES from being widely accepted in human surgeries. A novel multifunctional robot with an articulated <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism</b> for NOTES has been developed. The steerable articulating <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{is connected to the}} robotic end effector to guide the robot and navigate through a natural orifice. The design process for the articulating <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism</b> and engineering analysis are discussed in this paper.

The kinematics of the <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism</b> is also discussed.

2500|$|Different {{sizes of}} floppy disks are {{mechanically}} incompatible, and disks can fit only one size of drive. Drive assemblies with both 3½-inch and 5¼-inch slots were available {{during the transition}} period between the sizes, but they contained two separate <b>drive</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> In addition, there are many subtle, usually software-driven incompatibilities between the two. 5¼-inch disks formatted for use with Apple II computers would be unreadable and treated as unformatted on a Commodore. As computer platforms began to form, attempts were made at interchangeability. For example, the [...] "Superdrive" [...] included from the Macintosh SE to the Power Macintosh G3 could read, write and format IBM PC format 3½-inch disks, but few IBM-compatible computers had drives that did the reverse. 8-inch, 5¼-inch and 3½-inch drives were manufactured {{in a variety of}} sizes, most to fit standardized drive bays. Alongside the common disk sizes were non-classical sizes for specialized systems.|$|E
2500|$|The use of clepsydrae to <b>drive</b> <b>mechanisms</b> {{illustrating}} astronomical phenomena {{began with}} the Han Dynasty polymath Zhang Heng (78-139) in 117, who also employed a waterwheel. Zhang Heng {{was the first in}} China to add an extra compensating tank between the reservoir and the inflow vessel, which solved the problem of the falling pressure head in the reservoir tank. Zhang's ingenuity led to the creation by the Tang dynasty mathematician and engineer Yi Xing (683–727) and Liang Lingzan in 725 of a clock driven by a waterwheel linkwork escapement mechanism. The same mechanism would be used by the Song dynasty polymath Su Song (1020–1101) in 1088 to power his astronomical clock tower, as well as a chain drive. Su Song's clock tower, over [...] tall, possessed a bronze power-driven armillary sphere for observations, an automatically rotating celestial globe, and five front panels with doors that permitted the viewing of changing mannequins which rang bells or gongs, and held tablets indicating the hour or other special times of the day. In the 2000s, in Beijing's Drum Tower an outflow clepsydra is operational and displayed for tourists. It is connected to automata so that every quarter-hour a small brass statue of a man claps his cymbals.|$|E

40|$|Natural Orifice Translumenal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES) is {{a fairly}} recent {{surgical}} approach that {{eliminates the need for}} external incisions on the patient. NOTES takes the minimally invasive surgery paradigm a step further by using a natural orifice as the pathway to transport surgical tools to the surgical site and completely eliminating the need for even the smallest incision on the skin. Although the concept of NOTES has been in existence for the past decade, technological deficiencies prevent it from being widely accepted in human surgeries. A novel multifunctional robot for NOTES has been developed to overcome these limitations and make the approach a feasible one. The NOTES robot comprises a multifunctional robotic manipulator and a steerable and articulating <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The robotic manipulator carries three interchangeable surgical tool tips in a cartridge that enables tool changing without removing the robot from the patient. A stereovision camera is attached {{at the tip of the}} robotic manipulator to provide real-time video feedback to the surgeon. A steerable articulating <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism</b> is connected to the robotic manipulator to guide the robot and navigate through a natural orifice. Besides its guiding capabilities, the <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism</b> is also shape-lockable which provides a stable platform for the robotic manipulator to perform surgeries. The design process and engineering analysis for the articulating <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism</b> are discussed in detail in this thesis. The first-generation <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism</b> is designed and built as a proof of concept. Bench-top tests show that the design achieves the purpose of guiding and positioning the robotic manipulator. It is believed that the articulating <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism</b> can provide freedom of movement to the robotic manipulator and help circumvent some of the difficulties faced by approaches such as typical minimally invasive surgery (MIS). The second generation of the articulating <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism</b> is presented next, whereby the overall size of the <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism</b> is reduced significantly and the components in part of the drive transmission are also altered. Phantom Omni joysticks from SensAble Technologies are used as control consoles for the <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The programming for the <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism</b> controls has been developed and is presented in this thesis. Although further improvements are necessary to the current iteration of the robot, bench-top testing results show promise of continued success for the multifunctional robot for NOTES.

2500|$|On January 3, 1961, {{the reactor}} was being {{prepared}} for restart after a shutdown of eleven days over the holidays. Maintenance procedures required that the main central control rod be manually withdrawn a few inches to reconnect it to its drive mechanism. At 9:01p.m., this rod was suddenly withdrawn too far, causing SL-1 to go prompt critical instantly. In four milliseconds, the heat generated by the resulting enormous power excursion caused water surrounding the core to begin to explosively vaporize. The water vapor caused a pressure wave to strike {{the top of the}} reactor vessel, causing water and steam to spray {{from the top of the}} vessel. This extreme form of water hammer propelled control rods, shield plugs, and the entire reactor vessel upward. A later investigation concluded that the [...] vessel had jumped [...] and the upper control rod <b>drive</b> <b>mechanisms</b> had struck the ceiling of the reactor building prior to settling back into its original location. The spray of water and steam knocked two operators onto the floor, killing one and severely injuring another. One of the shield plugs on top of the reactor vessel impaled the third man through his groin and exited his shoulder, pinning him to the ceiling. The victims were Army Specialists John A. Byrnes (age 27) and Richard Leroy McKinley (age 22), and Navy Seabee Construction Electrician First Class (CE1) Richard C. Legg (age 26). It was later established that Byrnes (the reactor operator) had lifted the rod and caused the excursion, Legg (the shift supervisor) was standing on top of the reactor vessel and was impaled and pinned to the ceiling, and McKinley, the trainee who stood nearby, was later found alive by rescuers. All three men succumbed to injuries from physical trauma; however, the radiation from the nuclear excursion would have given the men no chance of survival even if they had not been killed by the explosion stemming from the criticality accident.|$|E
