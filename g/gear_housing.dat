25|$|The War Office {{allocated}} Trial No. 10 to the Gnome-powered {{aircraft and}} No. 11 to the Chenu-powered one, thereafter {{they were always}} identified as Biplane No. 10 and Biplane No. 11. No. 10 arrived at Larkhill Aerodrome in good time for the competition but No. 11 was moved by road and due to delays it missed the entry deadline. Although No. 11 was not disqualified it failed to compete due to engine problems, suffering repeated failures of the magneto drive followed by failure of the reduction <b>gear</b> <b>housing</b> (similar problems with a Chenu engine also grounded the Martin and Handasyde entry to the competition). No. 10 started the competition but had to be withdrawn with propeller problems.|$|E
500|$|To {{make the}} R as compact as possible, several design {{modifications}} {{were made in}} comparison to the Buzzard: the propeller reduction <b>gear</b> <b>housing</b> was reshaped, and the camshaft and rocker covers were modified to fair into the shape of the aircraft's nose, the air intake was positioned in the vee of the engine (which also helped to avoid the ingress of spray), and beneath the engine the auxiliaries were raised a little to reduce the depth of the fuselage. The engine's length was minimised by not staggering its cylinder banks fore and aft, which meant that the connecting rods from opposing cylinders had to share a short crankshaft bearing journal known as the [...] "big end". This was initially achieved by fitting one connecting rod inside the other at the lower end in a blade and fork arrangement; however, after cracking of the connecting rods was found during testing in 1931, the rod design was changed to an articulated type.|$|E
2500|$|L59's two initial {{attempts}} at starting the journey were foiled by {{weather in the}} Mediterranean, but on 21 November 1917 her third departure was successful. The ship made good time over Adrianople, the Sea of Marmara and the coast of Asia Minor. However, due to electrical storms over Crete, her wireless aerial was wound in and so the ship failed to receive messages from the German admiralty. [...] She crossed over the African coast at 05:15 on 22 November near Mersa Matruh and, flying via the Dakhla Oasis set a dog-leg course up the Nile. That afternoon, an engine malfunctioned when a reduction <b>gear</b> <b>housing</b> cracked; the loss of this powerplant eliminated the prospect of radio transmission, although wireless messages could be received. The next morning she nearly crashed when heat turbulence from the dunes below and subsequent cooling reduced the buoyancy of her gas. The crew also suffered from headaches, hallucinations and general fatigue in the mid-day heat and freezing cold at night.|$|E

5000|$|The Type 9 is {{a popular}} choice for {{five-speed}} conversions of older cars and also for kit car builders, since {{it comes with a}} separate bell housing so it can be easily swapped around. Engines that were originally in FWD layouts are fitted to these transmissions so that they can go into a RWD layout, as in a hot rod engine swap or kit car. The gearbox has a 1 in 23-spline input shaft, and the main <b>gear</b> <b>housing</b> is cast iron with a cast aluminum tailshaft housing.|$|E
50|$|The metal inserts {{provide support}} for bearings, shafts, gears and other metal {{components}} of the gearbox. The composite <b>gear</b> <b>housing</b> does not remove heat as efficiently as an aluminum or magnesium housing. Composite gear housings require more expensive and reliable cooling systems. However, composite plastic material is widely used on low-power applications such as gear motors for electromechanical actuators. Lightly loaded rotary gear actuators can be completely made of composite plastic material. Such electromechanical rotary actuators are installed, for example, on power windows of automobiles. Higher loaded actuators can contain metallic gears inside plastic composite housing for reduction of cost and corrosion resistance.|$|E
5000|$|In the new system, as with {{a normal}} FWD car, the {{transmission}} contains a differential that drives the front wheels. However, an extra shaft from this differential also drives a bevel <b>gear</b> <b>housed</b> in the transfer case that permanently turns a driveshaft for the rear wheels (i.e. {{there is no longer}} a [...] "center" [...] differential). Housed in the rear differential is a viscous coupling that in normal conditions is disengaged. This means that for general driving, the system is FWD only. When the computer detects slippage of the front wheels, the viscous coupling engages and transfers up to 50% of the torque to the rear wheels. This system is superior in some aspects as there is less energy loss due to the normal FWD operation, however it is no longer a full-time 4WD system.|$|R
50|$|The BMW 801 was cooled by {{forced air}} from a {{magnesium}} alloy cooling fan, 10 bladed {{in the initial}} models, but 12 bladed in most engines. The fan rotated at 1.72 times the crankshaft speed (3.17 times the propeller speed). Air from the fan was blown {{into the center of}} the engine in front of the propeller <b>gearing</b> <b>housing,</b> and the shape of the housing and the engine itself carried the air to the outside of the cowling and across the cylinders. A set of slots or gills at the rear of the cowling allowed the hot air to escape. This provided effective cooling although at the cost of about 70 PS (69 hp, 51.5 kW) required to drive the fan when the aircraft was at low speed. Above 170 mph, the fan absorbed little power directly as the vacuum effect of the airflow past the air exits provided the needed flow.|$|R
40|$|In {{automotive}} component {{design criteria}} such as weight, strength, stiffness, manufacturing cost are sensitive issues for boosting its performance {{which in turn}} has direct impact on fuel economy and cost. ¬† This thesis deals with the design of <b>gear</b> shifter <b>housing</b> for Volkswagen car by using modern topology optimization techniques to the existing design. <b>gear</b> shifter <b>housing</b> holds the shifting mechanism and guides the lever to select the respective gear for different speed. Optimizing the design in terms of topology, material and structural is very important in arriving at practical solution. ¬† To determine the optimum material layout distribution of material within the component with given set of loads and boundary conditions by placing a constrain on volume by minimizing sum of weighted compliance as well as maximizing lowest eigen value frequency. The process starts by applying loads to the gear shifter and constraining it in all directions thereby making the gear shifter a stiff design which can withstand loads from all direction. Boundary conditions {{play a major role in}} designing the component geometry. ¬† Contact formulation has been complex task from several years. Optimization with contact for minimizing the volume by maintaining uniform deformation between¬† contact surfaces between two commercial softwares, HyperWorks V 10. 0 and TOPO 4 ABQ has been compared with benchmarks. ¬† By using these techniques weight reduction has been achieved in automobile <b>gear</b> shifter <b>housing</b> and benchmarks with contact condition had been compared using Altair OptiStruct V 10. 0 and TOPO 4 ABQ by Niclas Str√∂mberg. ...|$|R
