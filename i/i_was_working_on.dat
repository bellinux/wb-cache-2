His performance was well received by critics; Entertainment Weeklys Owen Gleiberman wrote that Eckhart [...] "may be playing {{a bit of an}} ideal [...] but he makes goodness as palpable as he did yuppie evil in 'In the Company of Men'." [...] In an August 2004 interview, Eckhart claimed that he had not worked for nearly a year before he was cast in the movie. [...] "I felt like I sort of was getting away from what I wanted to do as an actor. [...] I had nine months off, but it wasn't a vacation.

500|$|Make-up {{supervisor}} Michael Westmore {{had previously}} used makeup to age DeForest Kelley {{in the season}} premiere [...] "Encounter at Farpoint", but [...] "Too Short a Season" [...] proved a unique challenge as four stages of make-up were required to show Admiral Jameson de-aging. The initial stage to show Jameson at his oldest, involved Rohner wearing a bald-cap and wig plus latex prosthetics applied to his eyes, forehead, throat and jowls. That stage took up to four hours {{to apply to the}} actor. Westmore found himself worn out by the volume of work during this episode, as at the time the make-up team on the series included just him and Werner Keppler. On the second day of shooting the first stage make-up, Westmore arrived after Rohner had been in make-up for three hours only to find that he was only half finished. Keppler and Westmore rushed to get him so as not to delay the filming of the episode. Bowman later criticised the make-up used on Rohner, describing it as sub-par. Westmore said that [...] "if <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> a film, and had several months to test Clayton's make-up beforehand, it probably would have turned out more to my liking. With less than a week to work with, I don't think it turned out too badly." ...|$|E

[...] Cimino confronted Washburn at the Sunset Marquis in LA about the draft, and Washburn supposedly replied that he couldn't take the pressure and had to go home. Cimino then fired Washburn.

2500|$|Edith Grossman, {{who wrote}} and {{published}} a highly acclaimed English {{translation of the}} novel in 2003, says that the book is mostly meant to move people into emotion using a systematic change of course, {{on the verge of}} both tragedy and comedy at the same time. Grossman has stated:The question is that Quixote has multiple interpretations [...] and how do I deal with that in my translation. I'm going to answer your question by avoiding it [...] so when I first started reading the Quixote I thought it was the most tragic book in the world, and I would read it and weep [...] As I grew older [...] my skin grew thicker [...] and so when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> the translation I was actually sitting at my computer and laughing out loud.

On January 8, 2004, Zuckerberg emailed to say he was [...] "completely swamped with work [...] week" [...] but had [...] "made some of the changes ... and they seem to be working great" [...] on his computer. He said he could discuss the site starting the following Tuesday, on January 13, 2004. On January 11, 2004, Zuckerberg registered the domain name thefacebook.com. On January 12, 2004, Zuckerberg e-mailed Eduardo Saverin, saying that the Facebook site [...] was almost complete and that they should discuss marketing strategies. Two days later, on January 14, 2004, Zuckerberg met again with the HarvardConnection team; however, he allegedly failed to disclose registering the domain name thefacebook.com or developing a competing social networking website. Rather, he allegedly reported progress on HarvardConnection, told the team he would continue to work on it, and would email the group later in the week. On February 4, 2004, Zuckerberg launched thefacebook.com, a social network for Harvard students, designed to expand to other schools around the country.|$|E
