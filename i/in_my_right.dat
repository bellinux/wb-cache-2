500|$|After {{retirement}} from first-class cricket {{at the end}} of the 1960 season in England, McCool returned to Australia, taking up market gardening with a specialty in rare blooms at Umina Beach on the Central Coast of New South Wales. He continued playing club cricket in the Newcastle competition for Belmont until rheumatism forced him to retire from all forms of cricket aged 55: [...] "Rheumatism <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>right</b> hand made it embarrassing for me to continue. [...] It was alarming to an old pro like me who prided himself on length and directions to have the ball slip out of my fingers out of control." ...|$|E
500|$|During the Seven Days Battles that {{followed}} in late June, Longstreet had operational command of {{nearly half of}} Lee's army15 brigadesas it drove McClellan back down the Peninsula. Longstreet performed aggressively and well in his new, larger command, particularly at Gaines' Mill and Glendale. Lee's army in general suffered from weak performances by Longstreet's peers, including, uncharacteristically, Stonewall Jackson, {{and was unable to}} destroy the Union Army. Moxley Sorrel wrote of Longstreet's confidence and calmness in battle: [...] "He was like a rock in steadiness when sometimes in battle the world seemed flying to pieces." [...] Gen. Lee said, [...] "Longstreet was the staff <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>right</b> hand." [...] He had been established as Lee's principal lieutenant.|$|E

60|$|He {{declared}} {{it was like}} a ballad; that he would do his best to help me; that I should have paper, pen, and ink, and write one line to Mr. Campbell and another to Mr. Rankeillor; and that if I had told the truth, ten to one he would be able (with their help) to pull me through and set me <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>rights.</b>|$|R

2500|$|... "The {{pain was}} unbelievable, it snapped like a breadstick. It sounded like two muzzled gunshots off my left shoulder. Pow, pow!" [...] Theismann {{said during a}} 2005 interview. [...] "It was at that point, I also found out what a {{magnificent}} machine the human body is. Almost immediately, from the knee down, all the feeling was gone <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>right</b> leg. The endorphins had kicked in, and I was not in pain." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{history of}} sports in India {{dates back to}} the Vedic era. Physical culture in ancient India was fuelled by {{religious}} rights. The mantra in the Atharvaveda, says, [...] "Duty is <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>right</b> hand and the fruits of victory in my left." [...] In terms of an ideal, these words hold the same sentiments as the traditional Olympic Oath: [...] "For the Honour of my Country and the Glory of Sport." [...] Badminton probably originated in India as a grownup's version of a very old children's game known in England as battledore and shuttlecock, the battledore being a paddle and the shuttlecock a small feathered cork, now usually called a [...] "bird." [...] Games like chess (chaturanga), snakes and ladders, playing cards, originated in India, and it was from here that these games were transmitted to foreign countries, where they were further modernised.|$|E
2500|$|Kentucky Rifleman William Atherton's memoirs {{testify to}} the skill of the Essex men and natives at bush fighting, stating [...] "the fight now became very close, and {{extremely}} hot ... I received a wound <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>right</b> shoulder." [...] The moment before Atherton was hit, he witnessed two of his fellow riflemen move too far forward. One was killed and the other wounded. Atherton described the tactics used by Ebenezer Reynolds and his Canadians: [...] "Their method was to retreat rapidly until {{they were out of}} sight (which was soon the case in the brushy woods) and while we were advancing they were preparing to give us another fire; so we were generally under the necessity of firing upon them as they were retreating." [...] Another Kentucky private had similar recollections: [...] "As we advanced they were firing themselves behind logs, trees, etc. to the best advantage." [...] After a long, bloody and exhaustive withdrawal over two miles of woodland, the Canadians and natives slipped away, leaving Frenchtown to the Kentuckians. This skirmish would later be called as the First Battle of the River Raisin.|$|E

2500|$|James Melville {{studied at}} Montrose in 1569 {{under the tutelage}} of Mr Andrew Milne. Melville rehearsed Calvin's Catechisms and read Virgil's Georgics amongst other works. He used these words to {{describe}} his years of instruction: [...] " [...] The maister of the scholl, was a lerned, honest, kynd man, whom also for thankfulness I name, Mr. Andro Miln. I never got a stroke of his hand; howbeit, I committed twa stupid faults, as it were with fire and sword :—Having the candle in my hand, on a winter night, before six o'clock, in the school, sitting in the class, bairnly and negligently playing with the bent, with which the floor was strewed, it kindled, so that we had much ado to put it out with our feet. The other was being molested by a condisciple, who cut the strings of my pen and ink-horn with his pen-knife I aiming with my pen-knife to his legs to fley him he feared, and lifting now a leg and now the other, rushed on his leg upon my knife, and struck himself a deep wound in the shin of the leg, which waa a quarter of a year in curing. In the time of the trying of the matter, he saw me so humble, so feared, so grieved, yield so many tears, and by fasting and mourning at the school all day, that he said he could not find in his heart to punish me farther. But my righteous God let me not slip that fault, but gave me a warning, and remembrance what it was to be denied with blood, although negligently; for within a short space, after I had caused a cutler, newly come to the town, to polish and sharp the same pen-knife, and had bought a pennyworth of apples, and cutting and eating the same in the links, as I put the slice in my mouth, I began to lope up upon a little sand brae, having the pen.knife <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>right</b> hand, I fell, and struck myself, missing my belly, an inch deep in the inward side of the left knee, even to the bean, whereby the equity of God's judgment, and my conscience struck me so, that I was the more wary of knives all my days." ...|$|E
60|$|I went again, {{bearing the}} mat {{containing}} the dead child <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>right</b> hand. But {{the bundle of}} medicines that held the living one I fastened across my shoulders. I passed out of the Emposeni, and, as I went, I held up the bundle <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>right</b> hand to the guards, showing them that which was in it, but saying nothing.|$|E

60|$|Breathlessly I waited, {{balancing}} {{upon one}} foot, for I {{did not dare}} move a muscle. <b>In</b> <b>my</b> <b>right</b> hand was my keen short-sword, the point hovering an inch above the thick fur beneath which beat the savage heart.|$|E
6000|$|... 'At least, {{you will}} confess that I am better drest {{than when we}} met last. I have returned, you see, like a certain demoniac of Gadara, about whom we used to argue, clothed--and perhaps also <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>right</b> mind.... God knows!' ...|$|E

Ye needn't answer it ef ye don't like; ye've got a friend over ther--Judge Thompson--who is a friend to ye, right or wrong, jest as any other man here is--as though ye'd packed your own jury.
