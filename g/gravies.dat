5|$|Onions are {{commonly}} chopped {{and used as}} an ingredient in various hearty warm dishes, and may {{also be used as}} a main ingredient in their own right, for example in French onion soup or onion chutney. They are versatile and can be baked, boiled, braised, grilled, fried, roasted, sautéed, or eaten raw in salads. Their layered nature makes them easy to hollow out once cooked, facilitating stuffing them, as in sogan-dolma. Onions are a staple in Indian cuisine, used as a thickening agent for curries and <b>gravies.</b> Onions pickled in vinegar are eaten as a snack. These are traditionally a side serving in pubs and fish and chip shops throughout the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth. Pickled onions form part of a British pub ploughman's lunch, usually served with cheese and ale. In North America, sliced onions are battered, deep-fried, and served as onion rings.|$|E

50|$|Cream <b>gravy</b> (sawmill <b>gravy</b> in Southern United States cuisine) is the <b>gravy</b> {{typically}} used in biscuits and <b>gravy</b> and chicken fried steak. It {{is essentially a}} Béchamel sauce, with the roux being made of meat drippings and flour. Milk is added and thickened by the roux; once prepared, black pepper and bits of mild sausage or chicken liver are sometimes added. Besides cream and sawmill <b>gravy,</b> common names include country <b>gravy,</b> white <b>gravy,</b> milk <b>gravy,</b> and sausage <b>gravy.</b>|$|R
50|$|Red-eye <b>gravy</b> {{is a thin}} sauce {{often seen}} in the cuisine of the Southern United States and {{associated}} with the country ham of that region. Other names for this sauce include poor man's <b>gravy,</b> bird-eye <b>gravy,</b> bottom sop, cedar <b>gravy,</b> and red ham <b>gravy.</b> The <b>gravy</b> is made from the drippings of pan-fried (or sometimes baked) sausage, country ham, bacon, or other pork, sometimes mixed with black coffee. The same drippings, when mixed with flour, make the flavoring for Sawmill <b>gravy.</b> Red-eye <b>gravy</b> is often served over ham, cornbread, fried potatoes, grits, or biscuits.|$|R
5000|$|Horse <b>Gravy.</b> Horse <b>Gravy</b> {{comes in}} a jar and {{consists}} of white <b>gravy</b> and brown <b>gravy</b> swirled together (somehow, the two kinds of <b>gravy</b> always remain separate, never mixed). The producer of Horse <b>Gravy,</b> {{at the beginning of}} his sponsorship, would give Jackie a handwritten script to read, which typically consisted of a family complaining about the blandness of the food prepared by the mother, and the mother calling out for help, after which a horse would appear and tell her to add Horse <b>Gravy</b> to the meal. However, the Horse <b>Gravy</b> man apparently did not like Jackie's presentation of this script and began sponsoring the podcast through Dunlap, thus earning Jackie's ire and vow never to eat Horse <b>Gravy</b> again. Horse <b>Gravy</b> later replaced its current line with Horse <b>Gravy</b> Black, which is an all-black, oily substance that, according to Dunlap, is visually unappealing but still tastes fantastic.|$|R
25|$|Cumin {{can be used}} {{ground or}} as whole seeds. It helps to add an earthy and warming feeling to food, making it a staple in certain stews and soups, as well as spiced <b>gravies</b> such as curry and chili. It is also used as an {{ingredient}} in some pickles and pastries.|$|E
25|$|Nanocellulose {{can be used}} as a low calorie {{replacement}} for today’s carbohydrate additives used as thickeners, flavour carriers and suspension stabilizers in a wide variety of food products and is useful for producing fillings, crushes, chips, wafers, soups, <b>gravies,</b> puddings etc. The food applications were early recognised as a highly interesting application field for nanocellulose due to the rheological behaviour of the nanocellulose gel.|$|E
25|$|Heavy beef- or pork-based brown <b>gravies</b> {{are rarely}} used. To {{maintain}} {{the texture of}} the fries, the cheese curd and gravy are added immediately prior to serving the dish. The hot gravy is usually poured over the room-temperature cheese curds, so that the cheese is warmed without completely melting. It is important to control the temperature, timing and the order in which the ingredients are added, so as to obtain the right food textures which {{is an essential part of}} the experience of eating poutine.|$|E

500|$|Marasmius rotula is {{generally}} considered inedible, but not poisonous. The mushroom has no distinguishable odor, and its taste is mild or bitter. Louis Krieger, writing in National Geographic in the 1920s, noted that the mushroom {{was used as an}} addition to <b>gravies</b> and, when used to garnish venison, [...] "adds the appropriate touch of the wild woodlands." [...] The fruit bodies will bioaccumulate cadmium: a study of the metal concentration of 15 wild mushroom species of India showed that M.rotula accumulated the highest concentration of that metal.|$|E
500|$|The book {{begins with}} general {{chapters}} on {{the duties of}} the [...] "mistress", the housekeeper, and the cook. There follow chapters on the kitchen itself, [...] "marketing" [...] (choosing good-quality produce at the market), and an introduction to cookery (Chapter 6). Together, these take up over 100 pages. Chapters 7 to 38 (roughly 1000 pages) cover English cooking, with recipes for soups, <b>gravies,</b> fish, meat (principally veal, beef, mutton and lamb, and pork), poultry, game, preserves, vegetables, pastries, puddings, sweets, jams, pickles, and savouries. Chapter 39 describes the [...] "art of carving at table", supported by 11 illustrations. Chapters 40 to 50 (some 200 pages) give instructions for dairy products, vegetarian and invalid (sick person) cookery, making bread, biscuits and cakes, and beverages. Chapters 51 to 59 describe cooking in various international styles including French, German, Spanish, Jewish, Australian, South African, Indian, American and Canadian cookery. Chapters 60 to 68 provide guidance on matters from trussing poultry to the definitions of culinary terms, arranging meals, decorating the table, making menus and the duties of domestic servants. Chapters 69 to 73 describe [...] "household recipes" [...] and medical preparations. The final chapter, 74, offers [...] "legal memoranda".|$|E

50|$|Vegetable <b>gravy</b> or {{vegetarian}} <b>gravy</b> is <b>gravy</b> {{made with}} boiled or roasted vegetables. A quick and flavorful vegetable <b>gravy</b> {{can be made}} from any combination of vegetable broth or vegetable stock, flour, and one of either butter, oil, or margarine. One recipe uses vegetarian bouillon cubes with cornstarch (corn flour) as a thickener (cowboy roux), which is whisked into boiling water. Sometimes vegetable juices are added to enrich the flavor, which may give the <b>gravy</b> a dark green color. Wine could be added. Brown vegetarian <b>gravy</b> can also be made with savory yeast extract like Marmite or Vegemite. There are also commercially produced instant <b>gravy</b> granules which are suitable for both vegetarians and vegans.|$|R

2500|$|As a garnish to meat {{dishes in}} the past the most common were porridges and cereals, in which the meat was boiled, later on boiled or rather steamed and baked root {{vegetables}} (turnips, carrots) as well as mushrooms; additionally the meat, without taking account its type, was garnished with pickled products—pickled cabbage, or sour and [...] "soaked" [...] (marinated) apples (mochoniye yabloki) or cranberries. Pan juices, alone or mixed with sour cream or melted butter, were used as gravy to pour on garnishing vegetables and porridges. Meat sauces, i.e. <b>gravies</b> based on flour, butter, eggs and milk, are not common for traditional Russian cuisine.|$|E
2500|$|Heinz was {{established}} in Canada in 1909 in a former tobacco factory in Leamington, Ontario (known as the Tomato Capital of Canada). Most products shipped from Leamington have English and French labels for distribution throughout Canada, but {{a substantial amount of}} product is sent to the US. Ketchup is the main product produced there, but the factory also produces Canada Fancy (Grade A) tomato juice, mustard, vinegar, baby food, barbecue sauces, canned pastas, beans, pasta sauces, <b>gravies</b> and soups. Heinz Canada is the major supplier of single-serving and flexible-packaging condiments for most fast food chains in Canada. Leamington [...] is the largest tomato processing region per acreage in the world. The Leamington plant usually processes more than 250,000 tons of tomatoes per year. Heinz Canada's head office is in North York, Ontario; it also has operations in St. Marys, Ontario; Montreal, Quebec; and Calgary, Alberta.|$|E

6000|$|Sausage led to Germany. [...] "I'm not one {{of those}} patriots," [...] he was saying presently, [...] "who run down other {{countries}} by way of glorifying their own. While I was in Germany I tasted many good things. There's their Leberwurst; it's never bad, and, at its best, it's splendid. It's only a fool would reproach Germany with sausage. Devonshire black-pudding, of course, is the master of any Blutwurst, but there's all those others on the German side, Frankfurter, big reddish sausage stuff again with great crystalline lumps of white fat. And how well they cook their rich hashes, and the thick <b>gravies</b> they make. Curious, how much better the cooking of Teutonic peoples is than the cooking of the South Europeans! It's as if one needed a colder climate to brace a cook to his business. The Frenchman and the Italian trifle and stimulate. It's as if they'd never met a hungry man. No German would have thought of soufflé. Ugh! it's vicious eating. There's much that's fine, though, in Austria and Hungary. I wish I had travelled in Hungary. Do you remember how once or twice we've lunched at that Viennese place in Regent Street, and how they've given us stuffed Paprika, eh?" ...|$|E
60|$|Pleasant (when {{one is not}} in {{the least}} bilious) to enter a {{comfortable}} dining-room, where the closely-drawn red curtains glow with the double light of fire and candle, where glass and silver are glittering on the pure damask, and a soup-tureen gives a hint of the fragrance that will presently rush out to inundate your hungry senses, and prepare them, by the delicate visitation of atoms, for the keen gusto of ampler contact! Especially if you have confidence in the dinner-giving capacity of your host--if you know that he is not a man who entertains grovelling views of eating and drinking as a mere satisfaction of hunger and thirst, and, dead to all the finer influences of the palate, expects his guest to be brilliant on ill-flavoured <b>gravies</b> and the cheapest Marsala. Mr. Ely was particularly worthy of such confidence, and his virtues as an Amphitryon had probably contributed quite as much as the central situation of Milby to the selection of his house as a clerical rendezvous. He looks particularly graceful at the head of his table, and, indeed, on all occasions where he acts as president or moderator: he is a man who seems to listen well, and is an excellent amalgam of dissimilar ingredients.|$|E

Turtle, salmon, tautog, woodcock, boiled turkey, South-Down mutton, pig, roast-beef, have vanished, or exist only in fragments, with lukewarm potatoes, and <b>gravies</b> crusted over with cold fat. The Judge, had he done nothing else, would have achieved wonders with his knife and fork. It was he, you know, of whom {{it used to be}} said, in reference to his ogre-like appetite, that his Creator made him a great animal, but that the dinner-hour made him a great beast. Persons of his large sensual endowments must claim indulgence, at their feeding-time. But, for once, the Judge is entirely too late for dinner! Too late, we fear, even to join the party at their wine! The guests are warm and merry; they have given up the Judge; and, concluding that the Free-Soilers have him, they will fix upon another candidate. Were our friend now to stalk in among them, with that wide-open stare, at once wild and stolid, his ungenial presence would be apt to change their cheer. Neither would it be seemly in Judge Pyncheon, generally so scrupulous in his attire, to show himself at a dinner-table with that crimson stain upon his shirt-bosom. By the bye, how came it there? It is an ugly sight, at any rate; and the wisest way for the Judge is to button his coat closely over his breast, and, taking his horse and chaise from the livery stable, to make all speed to his own house. There, after a glass of brandy and water, and a mutton-chop, a beefsteak, a broiled fowl, or some such hasty little dinner and supper all in one, he had better spend the evening by the fireside. He must toast his slippers a long while, in order {{to get rid of the}} chilliness which the air of this vile old house has sent curdling through his veins.|$|E
