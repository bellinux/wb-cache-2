The Division for Electricity at Uppsala University is doing significant research in the field. The present thesis investigates electric machines for vehicular applications, both in the driveline and in the traction motor. Section 1 presents a driveline with two galvanically isolated voltage levels. A low power side is operated at the optimum voltage of the batteries, while a high power side is operated at a higher voltage leading to higher efficiencies in the traction motor. Both sides are coupled through a flywheel that stabilizes the power transients inherent to a drive cycle. A review of electric machine topologies for electric vehicles is presented in Section 2. The permanent magnet excited machine is the most suitable technology for an electric driveline. Section 3 is devoted to numerical models applied to electric machines. The equivalent circuit of a motor/generator with two sets of windings is first presented. This machine couples both sides of the driveline and drives the rotor of the flywheel. The electric parameters are calculated with custom FEM models. A discussion on slotless machines concludes with a simple model to analyze the magnetic field from one static 3 D simulation. The tooth ripple losses in solid salient poles are also analyzed with a novel FEM approach. A complete description of the losses in electric machines gives a proper background for further discussion on efficiency. Section 4 presents the experimental work constructed to validate the theoretical models. The experiments include an axial flux, single wounded prototype, an axial flux, <b>double</b> <b>wound</b> prototype and a planed radial flux coreless prototype.

40|$|The {{members of}} the European funded FP 7 project {{consortium}} for CleanTools are delighted to announce {{the development of a}} novel rotary friction welding methodology to join Nitinol, a metal alloy of nickel and titanium, to stainless steel using a biocompatible interlayer. This pioneering technology will dramatically improve the manufacture and usability of medical devices that have previously needed mechanical joints or coupling. This innovative project has enabled the development of rotary friction welding parameters that provide tripartite joints, ideally suited for use in medical instruments such as intramedullary reamers. Traditional methods have used <b>double</b> <b>wound</b> shafts and mechanical joints which have been difficult and expensive to clean and sterilise. However, the use of shape-memory alloy Nitinol for the shaft provides sufficient elasticity to allow the rotating tool to be used in curved bone. It produces crevice free, highly reliable, bi-metallic surgical instruments, instantly removing the need for mechanical joints in this type of medical device. This means cleaning, disinfecting and sterilising is easier, more efficient and more reliable, which in turn reduces the risk of cross infection between patients. Approximately 7000 cases of MRSA infections were reported in UK hospitals during 2007 and similar issues are prevalent across Europe. Such infections are of particular concern in post-surgery patients. Rotary friction welding is a solid phase process, where no melting takes place. The simplest mechanical arrangement for continuous-drive rotary friction welding involves two cylindrical bars held in axial alignment. One of the bars is rotated while the other is advanced into contact under a pre-selected axial pressure (see illustration). Rotation continues for a specific time, sufficient for achieving the temperature at which metal in the joint zone is in the plastic state. Having achieved this condition, the rotating bar is stopped while the pressure is either maintained or increased to consolidate the joint. The project consortium is confident that this novel welding methodology will be brought to market quickly and successfully, and is currently assessing potential partners for the commercialisation of the technology...|$|E
40|$|Flywheel {{systems are}} {{attractive}} in hybrid and electric vehicles {{due to their}} ability to handle power during acceleration and braking. The combination of a flywheel device with a battery source has several advantages such as high peak power capacity, high energy density and {{reduction in the number of}} charge/discharge cycles of the battery. A flywheel based all-electric driveline is investigated in this thesis. The novelty of the system consists in the use of a <b>double</b> <b>wound</b> flywheel machine, which divides the system in two different power levels. Due to this configuration, the system becomes efficient and can handle the power developed during fast dynamical processes. The complete driveline consists of three main components: the battery, the flywheel machine and the wheel motor. The High-Power (HP) side of the driveline connects the flywheel machine to the wheel motor, whereas the Low-Power (LP) side connects the flywheel machine to the battery. The connections of different components of the system are made electrically through power converter devices. The present thesis focuses on the electrical converters and control strategies used in the flywheel based all-electric driveline. The control of power converters is responsible for the logic and functionality of the driveline, being a challenging step within this project. Different power converter topologies have been investigated: a DC/DC plus a DC/AC converter on the LP side, and an AC/DC/AC converter on the HP side. The design and assembly of the power electronics and their control scheme have been successfully implemented. Different control strategies have been suggested and a complete scaled driveline has been assembled and tested based on previous simulation results. Results have confirmed the functionality of the driveline, where smoothed output power has been obtained from the battery, whereas the flywheel handles power transients on the traction side. An average efficiency of about 87 % (battery to wheels) has been obtained. The power converter systems have been shown to be efficient and robust, with control strategies able to handle the peak energy flow in the system. A regenerative braking strategy has been simulated and a wheel-to-wheel efficiency of about 80 % has been estimated...|$|E
40|$|The SloMag project {{consisted}} of the design and construction of a low-field NMR spectroscopic device capable of one-dimensional imaging. The device {{has been designed to}} analyze a non-medical sample and produce a low-resolution image from information gathered from observing the hydrogen-proton free induction decay of water. Using a double-solenoid resistive magnet for the main field source, a centerbore field of 202 Gauss set the proton resonant frequency of water at 858 kHz. The main magnet {{consisted of}} Mama the outer solenoid and Baby the inner solenoid. Mama was <b>double</b> <b>wound</b> with 1574 turns of 16 A WG copper magnet wire with net resistance RM≈ 8. 5 Ω. Rather than sending a π/ 2 (or 90 °) pulse as is typically suggested, a full π (180 °) RF pulse was generated and conditioned at the center frequency (fo= 858 kHz). A square π-pulse is conditioned by a capacitively coupled band-pass filter with center frequency fo. The pulses are transmitted through an antenna orthogonally decoupled from the receive antenna. At RF pulse termination, a symmetrically counter-wound gradient coil is switched on, adding a linear perturbation ranging over 6 Gauss to the main field. The gradient current switch is an H-Bridge hexfet circuit triggered by 5 V logic signals synchronized with the RF pulse source through a pulse-generator. The gradient frequency encodes (or slice selects) the sample over a 4 cm range. A 350 MHz sampling oscilloscope receives data as an analog signal from RF antenna in the main coil. The sample consists of water that is doped with Copper Sulfate (CUS 04) and Iron Nitrate (Fe(N 03) 3). The data is then digitized and stored on a computer. Careful filtering through implementation of Matlab's ® Signal Processing Toolbox (SPT) yielded a noise free data set containing possible evidence of FID in the sample. While the gradient field coil and switch were operational, they were not implemented. Although software has been developed to analyze the frequency spectrum of the signal after the FID pulse.

40|$|The {{transport}} {{critical current}} density (J(_c)) of a 37 filament Bi- 2223 /Ag tape has been measured {{as a function}} of field and temperature from 4. 2 K up to 90 K. Data have been obtained over a large current range from 10 mA up to 100 A and in fields up to 23 T with the tape in 3 orientations with respect to field. These comprehensive data have been used to test the predictions of the flux creep and weak link models used to explain J(_c) in Bi- 2223 tapes. The J(_c) (B,T) dependence of optimised Bi- 2223 tapes has been calculated using a curved film model. The model assumes perfect grain connectivity and that the local superconducting properties are equivalent to those in the best reported thin films. A comparison between the calculations and measured J(_c) (B,T) dependencies suggest that in high fields at 20 K, J(_c) in presently available industrially processed tapes is only a factor of 8 below the performance of ideal fully optimised tapes. Transport measurements have been made on Bi- 2223 single filaments extracted from an alloy sheathed multifilamentary tape in liquid nitrogen at 77 K in fields up to 300 mT with the field aligned parallel and perpendicular to the a-b planes. Further Jc(B,T) data have been taken in a variable temperature insert at temperatures between 60 to 90 K in fields up to 15 T. In a study of the electric field-current density {E-J) characteristics of the c-axis orientated data at 77 K, negative curvature is observed in traces below 280 mT. However, the 280 mT trace exhibits both positive and negative curvature in different current regimes in contrast to the predictions of standard theory.
