5|$|By {{the time}} Musidora was exhibited, Etty's health was in serious decline. Suffering severe asthma, {{it was not}} unusual for passers-by to accuse him of {{drunkenness}} {{as he made his way}} wheezing through the London streets, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> to plan his retirement from polluted London to his beloved York. Abandoning the smaller paintings which kept him profitable, he strived to complete his Joan of Arc triptych before his health gave out. This was on a huge scale, 28ft (8.5m) in total width and 9ft 9in (3m) high; the three pictures from left to right depicted Joan devoting herself to the service of God and her country, Joan scattering the enemies of France, and Joan dying a martyr.|$|E
5|$|Hergé {{had hoped}} that being the author of an ongoing comic strip would improve his job prospects, for at the time <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> to develop a {{reputation}} as a designer of postcards, stationary, and advertisements. Rather than representing an example of a comic as the medium would come to be understood in the following decade, The Adventures of Totor consisted of square boxes containing illustrations with the captions written separately underneath, as was the style found in French comic creator Christophe's works La Famille Fenouillard (The Fenouillard Family) and Sapeur Camembert (Sapper Camembert). Initially using four boxes per page, as the series progressed this was increased to six and then eight, with each page ending on a cliffhanger.|$|E

5|$|The Soviet {{news media}} and {{government}} officials soon began to discuss the apparent substandard construction styles that had caused so many of Armenia's buildings to collapse. Gorbachev, in a TV interview several weeks after his expedited return from New York City, said that the concrete blocks had been built with more than enough sand but too little concrete, and suggested that the concrete had been stolen. , deputy chairman of the state building committee, stated that many newer homes collapsed as well and that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> {{an investigation into the}} matter and that criminal charges would be brought. The official communist party newspaper Pravda said that poor construction, like other issues of neglect in the Soviet system, could be blamed on the Era of Stagnation from the era of Leonid Brezhnev.|$|E

He intervened {{on behalf of the}} Lutherans in Germany, who opened the gates to their cities to him. His reign became famous from his actions a few years later when in June 1630 he landed in Germany, marking the Swedish Intervention in the Thirty Years' War. Gustavus intervened on the anti-Imperial side, which at the time was losing to the Holy Roman Empire and its Catholic allies; the Swedish forces would quickly reverse that situation.|$|E
25|$|Alfred Munnings was {{a painter}} specialising in horses. He {{served as a}} {{civilian}} war artist with Canadian cavalry during the war, having been judged unfit to fight {{due to lack of}} sight in one eye. In 1919, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> to move into sculpture. The Horner memorial was his first public work of sculpture, for which Lutyens commissioned him based on a pre-existing friendship. The work led to several further commissions for equine statues, including from the Jockey Club for a sculpture of the racehorse Brown Jack at Epsom Downs Racecourse.|$|E

25|$|Early in the offseason, {{there were}} talks of trading Demeter. Near {{the end of}} November, there was a six player offer between Los Angeles and the Washington Senators, where Washington wanted Don in place of Sandy Amorós. The Dodgers were {{reluctant}} to lose their 24-year-old hitter, offering outfielder Ron Fairly to the Senators in Demeter's stead. Washington continued to hold out on the trade for Demeter until Los Angeles officially killed the deal on December 2. The Dodgers had confidence in Don, believing that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> to overcome the many weakness in his hitting game that plagued him in previous seasons.|$|E
25|$|The Deux arabesques is {{an example}} of one of his {{earliest}} works, already developing his musical language. Suite bergamasque (1890) recalls rococo decorousness with a modern cynicism and puzzlement, and contains one of his most popular pieces, Clair de Lune. His String Quartet in G minor (1893) paved the way for his later more daring harmonic exploration, using the Phrygian mode as well as less standard scales such as the whole-tone, which creates a sense of floating, ethereal harmony. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> to employ a single, continuous theme, breaking away from the traditional A–B–A form with its restatements and amplifications, which had been a mainstay of classical music since Joseph Haydn.|$|E
25|$|With {{his newfound}} intellect, Doc Green {{came to the}} {{conclusion}} that the world was in danger by Gamma Mutates and thus needed to be depowered. He developed a serum made from Adamantium nanobites that absorbed gamma energy. He used these to depower the Leader, the Red Hulk, and A-Bomb, but decided to 'spare' She-Hulk as he concluded that she was the one gamma mutation whose life had been legitimately improved by her mutation. At the close of the storyline, Doc Green discovered that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> to disappear as the result of the Extremis serum wearing off. He ultimately allowed himself to fade away, returning to his normal Hulk form, as he feared that remaining at his current intellectual level would lead to him becoming the Maestro.|$|E

25|$|The 1992 season saw Lathwell in the Second XI, but <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> {{to break}} through into the First XI in one-day cricket. He opened the batting in two matches against the Netherlands (scoring 52 in the second). Lathwell top scored in the first Sunday League match of the season against Kent {{to set up a}} {{comfortable}} 4 wicket win. Two days later, Somerset played Kent again in the Benson & Hedges Cup, succumbing to a heavy defeat, Lathwell inexplicably batting at number 9. After another half-century for the Second XI, Lathwell was now firmly in the first team {{for the remainder of the}} season. It was an excellent debut season for Lathwell, scoring eleven half-centuries and one century (114 against Surrey) in first-class cricket. There was a lean spell in the middle of the season with consecutive scores of 1, 2, 3, 0 and 4, but Lathwell responded well with five innings between 45 and 72 and finished with a highly respectable average of 36.75 in first-class cricket. Lathwell was now established as an opening batsman, and was seldom used as a bowler, only taking wickets in for the season. He scored well in List A cricket too, but failed to convert any scores into centuries (his highest being 85, 93 and 95). Lathwell was rewarded with his Somerset County Cap, and was called into the England A touring squad to Australia.|$|E

500|$|Beebe's second book, The Bird, Its Form and Function, was {{published}} in 1906. This book was a reworking of a manuscript that Beebe had submitted to Henry Holt in 1902, but which Holt {{had asked him to}} expand into a major work on birds. In its finished form it represented a new kind of nature writing in that, although it presented technical information about bird biology and evolution, it did so in a way meant to be accessible to a general audience. It also represented an important turning point for Beebe, because in contrast to his youthful fascination with adding animals to his collection, in this book <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> to emphasize the importance of wildlife conservation.
