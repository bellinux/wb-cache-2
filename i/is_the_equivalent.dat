5|$|The 2002 Pacific typhoon {{season was}} an active season, with many {{tropical}} cyclones affecting Japan and China. Every month had tropical activity, with most storms forming from July through October. Overall, there were 44tropical depressions declared officially or unofficially, of which 26became named storms; of those, there were 15typhoons, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>equivalent</b> of a minimal hurricane, while 8 of the 15 typhoon intensified into super typhoons unofficially by the JTWC.|$|E

5|$|Cyclone Honorinina was a {{powerful}} tropical cyclone that struck eastern Madagascar in March 1986. The eighth named storm of the season, Honorinina formed on March9 {{to the south of}} Diego Garcia. It moved generally to the west-southwest due to a ridge to the south, gradually intensifying. On March12, the Météo France office on Réunion (MFR) upgraded Honorinina to tropical cyclone status, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>equivalent</b> of a minimal hurricane. On the next day, the cyclone attained maximum sustained winds of 150km/h (95mph) while in the vicinity of Tromelin Island. Honorinina weakened subsequently before making landfall about 40km (25mi) north of Toamasina, Madagascar with winds of 135km/h (85mph). The storm weakened further over land, moving southwestward across the country. It emerged into the Mozambique Channel and became extratropical on March18. Honorinina turned to the southeast, dissipating on March23.|$|E
5|$|IAU {{protocol}} is that discovery {{credit for}} a minor planet goes to whoever first submits {{a report to the}} MPC with enough positional data for a decent orbit determination, and that the credited discoverer has priority in naming it. This was Ortiz et al., and they proposed the name Ataecina, an Iberian goddess of the underworld. She <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>equivalent</b> of the Roman goddess Proserpina, who was in turn one of Pluto's lovers. However, as a chthonic deity, Ataecina would only have been an appropriate name for an object in orbital resonance with Neptune, which Haumea was not.|$|E
5|$|M53 (NGC 5024) is a {{globular}} cluster which was discovered independently by Johann Elert Bode in 1775 and Charles Messier in February 1777; William Herschel {{was the first}} to resolve it into stars. The magnitude-7.7 cluster is 56,000 light-years from Earth. Only 1° away is NGC 5053, a {{globular cluster}} with a sparser nucleus of stars. Its total luminosity <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>equivalent</b> of about 16,000 suns, one of the lowest luminosities of any globular cluster. It was discovered by William Herschel in 1784. NGC 4147 is a somewhat dimmer globular cluster, with a much-smaller apparent size.|$|E

5|$|On September28, 1898, island {{stations}} in the Lesser Antilles indicated {{the presence of a}} tropical cyclone, which was confirmed by the next day. Modern researchers determined that the system developed on September25 about 220miles (350km) east of Guadeloupe. For most of its duration, the system maintained a northwest track, reaching hurricane status on September27. Later that day, a barometric pressure of 977mbar, suggesting winds of 90mph (150km/h). Its intensification rate slowed on September28, before strengthening continued on October1. The winds reached 115mph (185km/h), which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>equivalent</b> of a major hurricane, or Category3 on the Saffir-Simpson scale. Around that time, the hurricane turned toward more to the west-northwest, due to a large ridge across the western Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|The 1987–88 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone {{season was}} a {{moderately}} active cyclone season, with nine named storms. Four of the storms attained tropical cyclone status, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>equivalent</b> of a minimal hurricane with 10minute sustained winds {{of at least}} 120km/h (75mph). The seasonal activity was evenly dispersed, officially beginning on December9 when the Météo-France office (MFR) on Réunion started tracking Tropical Storm Ariny. The storm crossed 90°E from the adjacent Australian basin, one of two storms in the season to do so along with Cyclone Ezenina. There were also two storms tracked unofficially by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) in November.|$|E
5|$|The {{game is a}} turn-based {{strategy}} and revolves around the British 6th Airborne Division's attempts to secure Bénouville Bridge (later renamed Pegasus Bridge, in honour of the battle) over the Caen Canal during the Normandy landings on 5 June 1944. The player is able to command either the British or German side in the game. Regardless of the side chosen, British units will not appear on the map {{at the beginning of}} the game as the British 6th Airborne Division have not yet made their parachute drops. German forces are distributed around the four far corners of the map, with a few units positioned near Bénouville Bridge. If playing as the British, the objective is to defeat all German forces and secure all bridges in the area, with the capture or destruction of the Merville Battery being the ultimate goal. If playing as the Germans, the only objective is to hold off all British attacks for 18 hours, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>equivalent</b> to 36 in-game turns.|$|E

5|$|Typhoon Sudal {{originally}} {{formed on}} April2, 2004, {{out of a}} persistent area of convection east of the FSM. It moved mostly westward {{for the first week}} of its duration, with brief northerly and southwesterly turns. Sudal attained tropical storm status on April5, and it gradually intensified into a typhoon, which is a tropical cyclone with winds of at least 119km/h (74mph) and <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>equivalent</b> of a hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean. On April9, it passed just south of Yap, and shortly thereafter its peak winds were estimated at 240km/h (150mph). Later, Sudal moved to the northwest and eventually to the northeast, becoming an extratropical cyclone on April16 and dissipating two days later.|$|E
5|$|The {{frequency}} response behaviour of all mechanical filters {{can be expressed}} as an equivalent electrical circuit using the impedance analogy described above. An {{example of this is}} shown in figure 8b which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>equivalent</b> circuit of the mechanical filter of figure 8a. Elements on the electrical side, such as the inductance of the magnetostrictive transducer, are omitted but would be taken into account in a complete design. The series resonant circuits on the circuit diagram represent the torsional resonators, and the shunt capacitors represent the coupling wires. The component values of the electrical equivalent circuit can be adjusted, more or less at will, by modifying the dimensions of the mechanical components. In this way, all the theoretical tools of electrical analysis and filter design can be brought to bear on the mechanical design. Any filter realisable in electrical theory can, in principle, also be realised as a mechanical filter. In particular, the popular finite element approximations to an ideal filter response of the Butterworth and Chebyshev filters can both readily be realised. As with the electrical counterpart, the more elements that are used, the closer the approximation approaches the ideal, however, for practical reasons the number of resonators does not normally exceed eight.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{becoming}} a tropical storm, Bingiza {{was located in}} an area of weak steering currents, which resulted in a slow, meandering motion toward the southwest. Its motion turned to the south on February10, with conditions only marginally favorable for further intensification. After two days of meandering without strengthening, Bingiza turned to the southwest on due to a building ridge to its southwest toward Madagascar. Around the same time, upper-level conditions began improving, which allowed the convection to increase in coverage. Based on the improved appearance, MF upgraded Bingiza to a severe tropical storm at 0600UTC on February12 about 335km (210mi) east of the coast of Madagascar. Later that day an eye became apparent on satellite imagery, signaling the beginning of a rapid deepening trend. Late on February12, MF upgraded Bingiza to tropical cyclone intensity, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>equivalent</b> of a hurricane or typhoon. With minimal wind shear and warm waters, the agency forecast the cyclone to intensify further to peak 10sustained winds of 195km/h (120mph). Continuing to strengthen, Bingiza attained 10minute sustained winds of 155km/h (100mph) early on February13. Similarly, the JTWC estimated peak 1minute sustained winds of 185km/h (115mph), noting a contracting eye 37km (23mi) in diameter in the process of an eyewall replacement cycle.|$|E
