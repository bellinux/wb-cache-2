[...] Gary Hoblit, who directed the 1996 Oppewall-designed film Primal Fear, said he particularly appreciated her flexibility and versatility: [...] "While she may prefer a world in which less is more, she can still create an opulent and gooey world that is appropriate for someone unlike her." ...|$|E

According to James Alcock, at a meeting where Randi was duplicating the performances of Uri Geller, a professor from the University at Buffalo shouted out that Randi was a fraud. Randi said: [...] "Yes, indeed, I'm a trickster, I'm a cheat, I'm a charlatan, that's what <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>living.</b> Everything I've done here was by trickery."

You're a fraud because you're pretending to do these things through trickery, but you're actually using psychic powers and misleading us by not admitting it." [...] A similar event involved Senator Claiborne Pell, a confirmed believer in psychic phenomena. When Randi personally demonstrated to Pell that he could reveal—by simple trickery—a concealed drawing that had been secretly made by the senator, Pell refused to believe that it was a trick, saying: [...] "I think Randi may be a psychic and doesn't realize it." [...] Randi has consistently denied having any paranormal powers or abilities.|$|E

In addition to Bob Douglass, Los Angeles-based mixers Bob LaMasney, and Sound One's Jack Donato and John Bickelhaupt currently specialize in audience sweetening. While modern digital machines are not as cumbersome as Douglass's original machinery, Bickelhaupt confirmed they “are pretty anonymous, with unlabeled knobs and buttons. We like to remain kind of mysterious — the man-behind-the-curtain thing. We don't really {{like to talk about}} it too much." [...] Bickelhaupt added that [...] "most of the time, what we're doing isn't re-creating a studio audience; the audience laughter is already there. But in editing, when sections of the show are taken out, when they take out lines to make the show fit a time slot — we have to cover the bridge between one laugh and another by using the laugh machine." [...] In reference to the quiet laugh track employed on How I Met Your Mother, Bickelhaupt commented that producers are increasingly “shying away from that big, full audience — the raucous sound that was more commonplace in the 70s, 80s, and 90s. They want a more subtle track.” Bickelhaupt concluded, [...] "I have a great job. When you sit and work on comedy all day, you can't possibly get depressed.

This response results in two types of reactions. The first type is, “Wow, that’s interesting.

There is a deeper problem, perhaps going back to the origin of physics. Around the beginning of the seventeenth century, Descartes and Galileo both made a most wonderful discovery: You could draw a graph with one axis being space and the other being time. [...] In this way, time is represented as if it were another dimension of space. Motion is frozen, and a whole history of constant motion and change is presented to us as something static and unchanging. If I had to guess (and guessing is what <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>living),</b> this is the scene of the crime.

In Ireland we can see this from the Whiteboys and the Land League up to the struggle here in Erris, the anti-fracking movement or the fight against water charges. Around the world community is central to indigenous struggles from the Ogoni to First Nations and Native American resistance to Keystone XL and other tar sands projects, but also to the movements of shack-dwellers in South Africa, farmers in the Narmada valley, No TAV in Italy and so on.

With these words, I have frequently tried to laugh off the slight embarrassment I feel when explaining what <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> to those who ask. Within archaeology, the idea of sifting through {{the contents of a}} cesspit in search of evidence for past food rarely ranks as a curiosity any more, but in the wider world surprise is sometimes expressed that anyone should either want to undertake such work or be paid for doing it. What I hope to do in this short contribution is to try to conjure up some of the flavour - if that is an appropriate metaphor - of archaeobotanical studies of ancient foods in York, drawing on a corpus of data collected over a period of more than two decades (though a large proportion of it still, sadly, unpublished, and likely to remain so) from deposits of almost all cultural periods from Roman to post-medieval, but with a very heavy emphasis on the second to third, ninth to eleventh, and thirteenth and fourteenth centuries...|$|E

Kurtz “indeed did help us through the thicket of the law…and most definitely taught us by example that one’s dreams, one’s work, one’s hopes and ambitions and goals can be taken seriously without taking ourselves too seriously. ” Upon receiving the award, Kurtz thanked his family, colleagues and former students for their support and said he was “awed and honored” {{to be one of the}} few faculty members who have been given the service scroll award. “I couldn’t have picked a better place to come to work,” Kurtz said. “I couldn’t have picked a better institution to help build.

Kurtz currently oversees academic programming and student life at the law school and is a J. Alton Hosch Professor. He will retire at the end of the 2012 - 2013 academic year. He also is the co-author and author of several publications, serves as an associate editor and is a board of editors member for Family Law Quarterly, and currently represents Georgia in the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws. In the past, Kurtz has served on the board of the UGA Athletic Association and the University Council, was named a UGA Senior Foundation Fellow, chaired the Meigs Professorship Selection Committee and was a member of the initial Georgia Public Defender Standards Council, the governing body for the first statewide system of indigent criminal defense. The legislation establishing the system was enacted in 2003 in response to a report by a Georgia Supreme Court Blue Ribbon Commission on which Kurtz served as reporter. Presenting Wooten with his award was 1972 Georgia Law alumnus and former Georgia Gov. Roy E. Barnes. “The greatest natural resource that we have (in Georgia) is the people of this state, and people like Joel Wooten are the ones who have built this state—the ones that continue to give back, the ones that make sure that everyone, regardless of their income or their station in life, has a lawyer,” Barnes said. In Wooten’s acceptance, he said he was humbled by the honor and thankful for the “support of a network of family and friends” and for the “good fortune to be surrounded by wonderful mentors. ” “I have long had a deep appreciation for the University of Georgia and what it meant in shaping and molding my life. That is especially true of the law school; for it was there that I not only learned legal theory and critical thinking and found a noble profession but also made lifelong friends,” Wooten said. “We all should strive to make sure that our law school continues to be one of excellence. ” Wooten serves as managing partner of the Butler, Wooten 2 ̆ 6 Fryhofer law firm and is a trial lawyer with considerable experience as lead counsel in civil litigation.
