These activities were carried out {{with the help of}} many volunteers as some of these activities were carried out at a place convenient for these target groups, such as at gay bars for {{men who have sex with}} men, at clinics for <b>drug</b> <b>abusers</b> and at border checkpoints and bus stations for cross-border travellers.|$|E
25|$|A six-year {{study on}} 51 Vietnam {{veterans}} who were <b>drug</b> <b>abusers</b> of either mainly stimulants (11 people), mainly opiates (26 people), or mainly benzodiazepines (14 people) {{was carried out}} to assess psychiatric symptoms related to the specific drugs of abuse. After six years, opiate abusers had little change in psychiatric symptomatology; five of the stimulant users had developed psychosis, and eight of the benzodiazepine users had developed depression. Therefore, long-term benzodiazepine abuse and dependence seems to carry {{a negative effect on}} mental health, with a significant risk of causing depression. Benzodiazepines are also sometimes abused intra-nasally.|$|E
25|$|Addiction {{vulnerability}} Endogenous oxytocin {{can also}} impact on drug effects and susceptibility to develop Substance use disorder. Endogenous oxytocin concentrations can directly impact on drug effects. Additionally, bilateral interactions with numerous systems, including the dopamine system, Hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis and immune system, can impact on development of dependence. The {{status of the}} endogenous oxytocin system might enhance or reduce susceptibility to addiction through its interaction with these systems. Individual differences in the endogenous oxytocin system based on genetic predisposition, gender and environmental influences, may therefore affect addiction vulnerability. Oxytocin {{may be related to}} the place conditioning behaviors observed in habitual <b>drug</b> <b>abusers.</b>|$|E
40|$|M. A. (Clinical Psychology) The {{present study}} investigates a modus operandi for doing therapy with the sedative-hypnotic/opiate <b>drug</b> <b>abuser</b> with {{borderline}} or narcissistic tendencies. Definitions {{of the latter}} {{are based on the}} work by Kernberg and Kohut respectively. Unstable patterns of attachment in infancy and childhood are thought to contribute to a sense of lack or deficit in the <b>drug</b> <b>abuser.</b> This lack or insufricient structuralisation is associated with compulsive dependency on an external obj ect, in this case, the sedative-hypnotic or opiate drug. In order to wean the <b>drug</b> <b>abuser</b> off his <b>drug,</b> it is proposed that, initially, the therapist needs to take over the function of the drug which is to act as a sUbstitute for psychic structure. In other words, the therapist becomes a self-object for the <b>drug</b> <b>abuser</b> until such time as he is sUfficiently structuralised and relatively tree ot the compulsion to drug. The nature of the selt-object' transference and the therapist's role therein are explored in this thesis...|$|R

25|$|There is a {{high rate}} of suicide in alcoholics and other <b>drug</b> <b>abusers.</b> The reasons {{believed}} to cause the increased risk of suicide include the long-term abuse of alcohol and other drugs causing physiological distortion of brain chemistry as well as the social isolation. Another factor is the acute intoxicating effects of the drugs may make suicide more likely to occur. Suicide is also very common in adolescent alcohol abusers, with 1 in 4 suicides in adolescents being related to alcohol abuse. In the USA approximately 30% of suicides are related to alcohol abuse. Alcohol abuse is also associated with increased risks of committing criminal offences including child abuse, domestic violence, rapes, burglaries and assaults.|$|E
25|$|The {{home was}} a {{registered}} NGO and was occasionally open to the public. Villa Lauri includes the home (Dar Frate Francesco), the prayer house (Beatu Falzon Chapel) and a private residence (St Anne house). Since {{the building of the}} villa, the three parts together have always been known as simply the villa and known to the locals as Villa Lauri. The home was shut down in 2010 soon after the loss of Fr Abela. At some point it served as a temporary shelter for former prisoners and <b>drug</b> <b>abusers.</b> It was occasionally used for meetings by people with blindness disability. The house-church was open to the public. There were daily masses at 17:30 and till it closed in 2017 the chaplain was John Azzopardi (OFM).|$|E
25|$|In {{tests in}} {{pentobarbital}} trained rhesus monkeys benzodiazepines produced effects similar to barbiturates. In a 1991 study, triazolam {{had the highest}} self-administration rate in cocaine trained baboons, among the five benzodiazepines examined: alprazolam, bromazepam, chlordiazepoxide, lorazepam, triazolam. A 1985 study found that triazolam and temazepam maintained higher rates of self-injection than {{a variety of other}} benzodiazepines. A 1991 study indicated that diazepam, in particular, had a greater abuse liability among people who were <b>drug</b> <b>abusers</b> than did many of the other benzodiazepines. Some of the available data also suggested that lorazepam and alprazolam are more diazepam-like in having relatively high abuse liability, while oxazepam, halazepam, and possibly chlordiazepoxide, are relatively low in this regard. A 1991–1993 British study found that the hypnotics flurazepam and temazepam were more toxic than average benzodiazepines in overdose. A 1995 study found that temazepam is more rapidly absorbed and oxazepam is more slowly absorbed than most other benzodiazepines.|$|E

25|$|Zopiclone has the {{potential}} for misuse and dosage escalation, drug abuse, and drug dependence. It is abused orally and sometimes intravenously, and often combined with alcohol to achieve a combined sedative hypnotic—alcohol euphoria. Patients abusing the drug are also at risk of dependence. Withdrawal symptoms can be seen after long-term use of normal doses even after a gradual reduction regimen. The Compendium of Pharmaceuticals and Specialties recommends zopiclone prescriptions not exceed 7 to 10 days, owing to concerns of addiction, tolerance, and physical dependence. Two types of drug misuse can occur: either recreational misuse, wherein the drug is taken to achieve a high, or when the drug is continued long-term against medical advice. Zopiclone may be more addictive than benzodiazepines. Those with a history of substance misuse or mental health disorders may be at an increased risk of high-dose zopiclone misuse. High dose misuse of zopiclone and increasing popularity amongst <b>drug</b> <b>abusers</b> who have been prescribed with zopiclone The symptoms of zopiclone addiction can include depression, dysphoria, hopelessness, slow thoughts, social isolation, worrying, sexual anhedonia, and nervousness.|$|E

Landy began developing ideas for his 24-hour treatment program while engaging in postdoctoral work at Rancho Santa Fe. It was there that he practiced [...] "marathon therapy", in which a therapist takes control of a group of people for a day or more. In 1968, he worked briefly as an intern at Gateways Hospital in Echo Park, Los Angeles, where he developed his methods further, experimenting with treatment on teenage <b>drug</b> <b>abusers</b> with varying degrees of success. He attributed his failures to having too little control over their nighttime activities; he tried evening rap groups and made himself available at all hours for talking therapies for their nocturnal anxiety attacks. Landy went on to call his new system milieu therapy.|$|E
500|$|In a 1988 book review, Jack Geiger of The New York Times {{commented that}} the detail in Shilts' work was too confusing, being told [...] "in five {{simultaneous}} but disjointed chronologies, making them all less coherent", and notes that Shilts neglected to dedicate as much detail to black and Hispanic intravenous drug users, their partners and their children as to gay men. Geiger also expressed doubts that a swifter response by the government would have stemmed the spread of AIDS as quickly as Shilts was implying. Woodrow Myers from the Los Angeles Times was frustrated by Shilts not asking the right questions: [...] "Shilts fails to probe the broader questions and stops where far {{too many of us}} stop: We don't ask why the Department of Defense and the entitlements like Social Security are getting all the money when the homosexuals and the IV <b>drug</b> <b>abusers</b> with AIDS and the multiple sclerosis patients are not." [...] The Gay Community News in Boston also criticized the book's implications that a diagnosis of HIV indicated that death was sure and imminent. Richard Rouilard, editor of The Advocate in 1992 criticized Shilts for being {{out of touch with the}} contemporary style of activism and its sexual overtones.|$|E
