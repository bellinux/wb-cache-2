In analyzing date, t- test, arithmetic mean and standard deviation were used. The findings of the study indicated that existing cultural diversity in Turkey founds a very limited place in <b>history</b> <b>lessons</b> and a discriminatory or the other language or rhetoric toward different cultural groups was used in the history textbooks. For the same reason, <b>history</b> <b>lessons</b> were found too far from constituting patriotic emotions for culturally different student...|$|R

[...] "By {{focusing on the}} famed reign of Tsar Dušan," [...] she writes, [...] "Jovanović was making a case for the respect with which Serbia should be regarded." [...] The painting, she argues, is both a <b>history</b> <b>lesson</b> and a [...] "patriotic declaration".

Dr. Nigel Seel of sciencefiction.com called it tired, unoriginal and boring, saying, [...] "It's hard {{to care about the}} flimsy characters, the plot is wearily over familiar, the hero is passive {{throughout}} and overall, not enough happens." [...] He criticised the characters as stereotypical and the plot being far too slow, concluding, [...] "This is one for the die-hard Halo fans." [...] Hilary Williamson of Book Loons also considered Cryptum appealing only to Halo fans, but praised Graham's narration. The author of Artistic Gamings review of Cryptum found it difficult to like the book's characters due to the condescending tone of Bornstellar, also concluding that it is only suited to diehard fans. Portland Book Reviews Missy Wadkins felt differently. She thought the characters complex and found it comparable to an interesting <b>history</b> <b>lesson.</b> Her review further contrasted Dr. Seel's by recommending it to all science fiction readers, not just Halo fans. Jason Hamilton of Story Hobby also praised the novel; he complimented Bear's creation of a completely different culture to humanity and his balance of providing the reader with enough information to maintain interest without letting on too much and ruining the suspense.|$|E

By taking this problem in to consideration, the course of <b>history</b> <b>lessons</b> and the perspective of the students towards the <b>history</b> <b>lessons</b> will be changed and models will be shown about using actively the drama teaching method.

She and her sisters had little understanding of money because they had not {{had an opportunity to}} shop in stores or to see money exchange hands. Young Olga once thought that a hat maker who came to the palace had given her a new hat as a present. Olga was once frightened when she witnessed a policeman arresting someone on the street. She thought the policeman would come to arrest her because she had behaved badly for Miss Eagar. When reading a <b>history</b> <b>lesson,</b> she remarked that she was glad she lived in current times, when people were good and not as evil as they had been in the past. When she was eight, in November 1903, Olga learned about death first hand when her first cousin, Princess Elisabeth of Hesse and by Rhine, died of typhoid fever while on a visit to the Romanovs at their Polish estate. [...] "My children talked much of cousin Ella and how God had taken her spirit, and they understood that later God would take her body also to heaven", wrote Eagar. [...] "On Christmas morning when Olga awoke, she exclaimed at once, 'Did God send for cousin Ella's body in the night?' I felt startled at such a question on Christmas morning, but answered, 'Oh, no, dear, not yet.' She was greatly disappointed, and said, 'I thought He would have sent for her to keep Christmas with Him.'" ...|$|E
