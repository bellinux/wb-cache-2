60|$|For a {{considerable}} {{part of the}} way the paddles were working easily at from nine to ten, and the screw at from thirty-two to thirty-four revolutions per minute. It will give most readers a better idea of the tremendous nature of the size and speed of the engines which worked so easily, when it is said that, at ten revolutions, the paddle-wheels dashed through the water at something like 1600 feet per minute, and the screw revolved at 2500. When accomplishing this, the consumption of fuel was at the rate of 250 tons a day for both engines, the <b>indicated</b> <b>power</b> being above 5000 horses--about 2000 horses for the paddles, and a little over 3500 for the screw. In order to secure her going at full speed, however, under such circumstances, the great ship should have been down by the stern at least eighteen inches more than she really was, for not less than a foot of the screw-blades was out of the water, and the slip or loss of power was of course very great. Off the coast of Cornwall, the swell caused her to roll very considerably, as long as she was a-beam of the long swell.|$|E

However, it first came into prominence in 1929 when applied to compound Pacific No 3566 which combined enlarged steam circuits, increased superheat, feedwater heater, thermic syphon, Lentz poppet valves with double Kylchap exhaust extractors and chimneys. On test in November 1929, the locomotive's <b>indicated</b> <b>power</b> output {{was found to have}} increased by over 60%, from 1850 ihp to 3000 ihp while its fuel and water consumption had improved by 25% compared to unrebuilt engines of the same class.

5000|$|Ideally, {{the primary}} and {{secondary}} currents of a current transformer should be in phase. In practice, this is impossible, but, at normal power frequencies, phase shifts of a few tenths of a degree are achievable, while simpler CTs may have phase shifts up to six degrees. [...] For current measurement, phase shift is immaterial as ammeters only display {{the magnitude of the}} current. However, in wattmeters, energy meters, and power factor meters, phase shift produces errors. For power and energy measurement, the errors are considered to be negligible at unity power factor but become more significant as the power factor approaches zero. At zero power factor, any <b>indicated</b> <b>power</b> is entirely due to the current transformer's phase error. [...] The introduction of electronic power and energy meters has allowed current phase error to be calibrated out.|$|E
40|$|Fast {{calculation}} of quantities such as in-cylinder volume and <b>indicated</b> <b>power</b> {{is important in}} internal combustion engine research. Multiple channels of data including crank angle and pressure were collected for this purpose using a fully instrumented diesel engine research facility. Currently, existing methods use software to post-process the data, first calculating volume from crank angle, then calculating the indicated work and <b>indicated</b> <b>power</b> from the area enclosed by the pressure-volume indicator diagram. Instead, this work investigates the feasibility of achieving real-time {{calculation of}} volume and power via hardware implementation on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Alternative hardware implementations were investigated using lookup tables, Taylor series methods or the CORDIC (CoOrdinate Rotation DIgital Computer) algorithm to compute the trigonometric operations in the crank angle to volume calculation, and the CORDIC algorithm was found to use {{the least amount of}} resources.

40|$|On {{the vapor}} {{compression}} refrigeration system, Vapor injection (VI, the phase separator type injection or the internal heat exchanger type injection) compression cycleâ€™s superiority over non-injection cycle {{has been well}} known. VI system produces the high heating/cooling capacity, and its power consumption {{is less than the}} non-injection system. But if a VI compression cycle uses a single rotary compressor, there is the problem that refrigerant injection increases the <b>indicated</b> <b>power</b> by mixture loss. If we use a two-stage rotary compressor, <b>indicated</b> <b>power</b> also increases because of its two times exhaust process. To solve these problems, we developed a new dual-cylinder rotary compressor for VI systems, one of the cylinders is used to compress the gas from the evaporator, and the other is used to compress the gas from the phase separator (flash-tank). Its design method is discussed and its performance under different conditions is analyzed...|$|E
