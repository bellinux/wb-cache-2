And now all gone--all fallen away into this sunny silence and desertion: a family of squatters dining in the assayer's office, making their beds in the big sleeping room erstwhile so crowded, keeping their wine in the tunnel that once rang with picks.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to dig deeper and explore {{industrial}} marketing and specifically the many parts of the buying decision process. The study is conducted through analyzing the geothermal heat extraction industry where rivalry exists between companies competing to deliver systems satisfying customer needs in an as sufficient way as possible. The business area of drill hammers has been selected. Within this business area, detailed studies have been made on one specific company’s water powered <b>drill</b> <b>hammer</b> solution and how this differs from the conventional air powered <b>drill</b> <b>hammer</b> solution. Knowledge is created through a combination of established accepted scientific theories and cost calculations as well as profound interviews conducted with some of the most experienced and knowledgeable individuals within the industry. The result has been a display of the observable characteristics of the buying decision process utilized within the geothermal heat extraction industry. Results are shown in individual’s participation in the decision making unit, their preferences in terms of parameter interest and their cost awareness. Financial calculations have been made in order to illuminate a computed more actual cost of geothermal drilling. In accordance to prior academic studies and theories, the interviews shows that the most significant and valued parameter is of financial matters. The study shows some importance of other parameters in form of the industry’s knowledge of them. Furthermore, the comparison of the cost calculation and the interviewed industry representatives has indicated a divergence between the perceived difference in drill cost and the computed. To inform the industry on this matter is needed. Finally, the study has shown the great complexity of the buying decision process with all of its participants, different constellations and its construction. Validerat; 20110131 (anonymous...|$|E

40|$|While {{drilling}} holes {{it is extremely}} important that the drill holes are drilled as straight as possible. Even with the advances in drilling technology over the years it is still almost impossible. This is especially the case as the drilling depth increases. Drill hole deviation is affected {{by a variety of}} factors including drilling techniques such as weight on bit (WOB) or drill string diameter and rock properties such as density and crystal structure. It is important to study the deviation of the drill holes to ensure that the borehole is aligned correctly. When there is deviation within a boreholes major negative consequences can occur. This thesis describes the results from deviation measurements of drill holes from two different drifts within the ore body ”Alliansen” in the LKAB mine in Malmberget (MUJ). In the first drift, the production holes were drilled with a 115 mm drill bit, and in the second a drill bit of 105 mm. This is based on a project “Klenare borrhål” initiated by LKAB Wassara, a subsidiary of LKAB. LKAB Wassara wished to evaluate a possible reduction of drill hole diameter from the current 115 mm, to 105 mm. If the project had positive outcome, further attempts with an even smaller borehole diameter of 89 mm would be tested. There will also be curvature measurements as part of the evaluation of Wassaras new <b>drill</b> <b>hammer,</b> W 90. The results of the measurements show that the average deviation of drill holes drilled with a larger diameter drill bit had much higher deviation than for the smaller diameter drill holes drilled with a smaller drill bit...|$|E
