25|$|Externally the {{building}} is clad in prefabricated concrete panels which sit on U-shaped frames supported by the inner wall. The building generally is constructed of reinforced concrete and the columns have a smooth <b>concrete</b> <b>finish.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Concrete</b> <b>finishing</b> trowel: is used {{to smooth}} a surface after the {{concrete}} has begun to set; it is held nearly level {{to the surface of}} the concrete, and moved with a sweeping arc across the surface.|$|R
50|$|<b>Concrete</b> <b>finishes</b> {{throughout}} the building were originally off-form, an unrendered surface where the impressions {{left by the}} formwork provide decorative effect. Parts of the building have subsequently been painted. New galvanised steel balustrading and security grilles have been installed.|$|R
25|$|Following {{a public}} {{fund-raising}} effort, September 1969 saw the opening by Princess Margaret of a replacement facility, the Thorndike Theatre, named after Dame Sybil Thorndike. Designed by Roderick Ham, the theatre {{was a complete}} 'cultural centre' whose radical open walkways and exposed <b>concrete</b> <b>finish</b> {{are thought to have}} influenced the later National Theatre in London.|$|R
5000|$|The Spanish Colonial Revival style {{commercial}} building {{was built in}} 1931, and was designed by the Starks and Flanders architecture firm.

5000|$|The {{building}} was bought {{and served as}} a Swiss headquarters and operating center. Construction of a production hall was started. Since steel beams and <b>concrete</b> <b>finished</b> elements were used, the construction did not take long. This was the first legofactory outside of Denmark.

5|$|For Reyner Banham, Tange was a prime {{exemplar of}} the use of Brutalist architecture. His use of Béton brut <b>concrete</b> <b>finishes</b> in a raw and undecorated way {{combined}} with his civic projects such as the redevelopment of Tokyo Bay made him a great influence on British architects during the 1960s. Brutalist architecture has been criticised for being soulless and for promoting the exclusive use of a material that is poor at withstanding long exposures to natural weather.|$|R
50|$|The Quapaw bathhouse {{was built}} in 1922 in a Spanish Colonial Revival style {{building}} of masonry and reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>finished</b> with stucco. The most striking exterior feature is the large central dome covered with brilliantly colored tiles and capped with a small copper cupola. The building's use as a bathhouse ended in 1984 when the last contract ended. A new lease was signed with the National Park in 2007 and the Quapaw Bath house reopened as Quapaw Baths & Spa in July 2008.|$|R
50|$|Once the <b>concrete</b> had <b>finished</b> curing and dried, {{the top of}} {{the roof}} was painted with three {{applications}} of plastic material for water and weatherproofing.|$|R
25|$|Designed by Prof. Christopher Charles Benninger the Girls' Hostel Building, an eleven-storey {{structure}} with exposed <b>concrete</b> <b>finish,</b> is {{built as a}} prototype for future hostels to be built on the campus. A connecting street opens into the Entrance lobby of the building with a double height coffered ceiling on the Ground Floor. Adjacent to it is a large dining space for 200 girls which flow out into the landscape through large windows. The building can accommodate up to 600 girls with 20 rooms per floor.|$|R
50|$|Owner Martin Maurer had The Big Duck {{building}} {{constructed in}} 1930 and 1931 on a prime {{spot on the}} busy Main Street {{in the town of}} Riverhead on Long Island, New York. The builders Smith and Yeager completed the <b>concrete</b> <b>finish</b> work on the Big Duck which was featured in Atlas Cement's 1931 calendar. Merlin Yeager noted that most of the duck is actually finished with Portland Cement, but they ran out and finished with Atlas Cement. The Big Duck was also featured in Popular Mechanics magazine.|$|R
50|$|The Mills Mansion poses several {{challenges}} to preservation: On the outside, a gray sprayed <b>concrete</b> <b>finish</b> which was added {{later as a}} preservation measure needs to be removed and replaced with a more suitable surface treatment. At the same time, the decorative cornice and many decorative elements need to be either restored or replaced. On {{the inside of the}} building, wall paint and furnishing fabrics are in need of replacement, marble and wooden surfaces need to be cleaned and the objects of the mansion's collection need to be conserved.|$|R
50|$|The design {{would be}} a simple {{geometric}} structure with a large glass pavilion. The concrete tower stands 125 ft tall and houses offices and archives. A circular section contains two theaters and {{is connected to the}} tower by the 115 foot m grey-glass pavilion. The <b>concrete</b> <b>finish</b> of the building directly reflects the budget. With more money Pei would have made the building with stone which he believes offers a nicer finish with more detail. The materials chosen kept the costs within budget, in total costing $20.8 million.|$|R
5000|$|After {{two years}} of design work, and even after the design had been {{approved}} and meetings with potential building contractors had begun, Kahn and the Salk Institute abruptly decided {{to reduce the number}} of laboratory buildings from four narrow ones to two wider ones and to increase the number of floors per building from two to three. Komendant re-engineered the structure and produced a new set of drawings with a speed that professor Leslie described as [...] "legendary".He also trained the construction workers in techniques for producing a highly refined <b>concrete</b> <b>finish.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{building}} at 7 East 22nd Street had a two-story extension adjoining {{the rear of}} the {{building at}} 6 East 23rd Street. The cellar of the 22nd Street building extended about 35 feet under the drug store. The drugstore's floor was supported by 3" [...] x 14" [...] wood beams. 3/4" [...] wood planking atop these beams was covered with five inches of <b>concrete</b> <b>finished</b> with terrazzo. The fire underneath the store weakened the wooden beams, while the thickness of the floor prevented firefighters from feeling the extreme heat below.|$|R
5000|$|Pioneering {{publicist}} Steve Hannigan, who {{had successfully}} promoted Miami Beach, Florida, was hired and named the resort [...] "Sun Valley" [...] and developed the tag line: “Winter sports under a summer sun[...]" [...] (Count Schaffgotsch returned to Austria and {{was killed on}} the Eastern Front during World War II.) The centerpiece of the new resort was the Sun Valley Lodge, which opened [...] in December 1936. The 220-room, X-shaped lodge's exterior was constructed of concrete, poured inside rough-sawn forms. The wood grain was impressed on the <b>concrete</b> <b>finish,</b> which was acid-stained brown to imitate wood.|$|R
50|$|In {{the course}} of the years, the product range was {{extended}} and today comprises all relevant ranges of chemistry-based construction products: building shell products for <b>concrete</b> <b>finishing</b> and repair, bitumen-based products for waterproofing of building structures, quick-setting cements, screeds, sub-floor preparation agents, sub-floor smoothing compounds, epoxy-based industrial floor coverings for floor areas in private and industrial premises, sealing compounds to be applied beneath tiles, adhesives for tiles, natural stones and insulating materials, joint mortar for tiles and marble, sealing compounds for the building trade, wall smoothing compounds for smoothing wall surfaces, floor covering and parquetry adhesives for carpets and parquetry etc.|$|R
50|$|Madin was a {{significant}} figure of post-war Birmingham architecture. Madin's work has been much neglected and was not highly regarded by the early-21st century political leadership within Birmingham. Clive Dutton, the city's former Director of Planning and Regeneration, described Madin's Central Library as a “concrete monstrosity” (Madin's original plans were for the building to be clad in marble; the city, however, was unwilling {{to foot the bill}} so a <b>concrete</b> <b>finish</b> was used instead). A replacement, The Library of Birmingham was opened on 3 September 2013 in Centenary Square, which resulted in the previous building being demolished, starting early in 2015.|$|R
5000|$|However, from 1962 to 1964 Pei {{dedicated}} {{a significant}} portion of his time to designing the lab. Through his revisions he moved from a single tall tower concept to a series of three 5 story towers set up in a village-like model. Also, he moved from a single stage construction to an incremental two phase approach that better suited NCAR's National Science Foundation-imposed budget constraints. Despite the budgetary constraints, Pei managed to incorporate such features as bush-hammering of the <b>concrete</b> <b>finish</b> and crows nests on top of the towers that sought to meet NCAR's goal of a complex structure.|$|R
50|$|The design {{demonstrates}} the precast-concrete skills, by exposing the <b>concrete</b> <b>finish</b> rather than painting or cladding, which {{were provided by}} Peri. The precast floor terracing was manufactured by Bell & Webster Concrete in Lincolnshire, England. The terracing units were delivered and positioned to accelerate the speed of construction. The unique six-board diving platform is made from 462 tonnes of concrete. The aluminium roof covering was provided by Kalzip. The steel structure was built in cooperation with Rowecord Engineering, of Newport, Wales. The ceiling was built with 30,000 sections of Red Louro timber. The steel roof weighs 3,200 tonnes. The three pools hold around 10 million litres (2.6 million gallons) of water.|$|R
5000|$|The {{interior}} of the building was designed to provide as open an environment as possible. The intent was to create spaces or zones which foster better communication between employees. Green Factory’s office spaces are designed like pods, which focus on a central open meeting area, and have meeting rooms, mailboxes, canteens, and tables for meetings. Most of the central meeting spaces have non-traditional furniture and continue the casual theme found {{throughout the rest of}} the interior. The emergency stairs sport different patterns or designs instead of the typical painted <b>concrete</b> <b>finish.</b> [...] The top floor is home to the community café and a small garden/recreation space.|$|R
