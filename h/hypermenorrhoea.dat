30|$|A 45 -year-old {{multiparous}} woman {{visited the}} outpatient clinic with <b>hypermenorrhoea</b> {{which resulted in}} hypochromic anemia. For 2  years, she suffered <b>hypermenorrhoea</b> responding neither to oral contraceptive pills nor to a levonorgestrel intrauterine device. Her medical history included a laparoscopic right-sided salphingectomy due to an ectopic pregnancy.|$|E
30|$|Worldwide, the {{majority}} (90 %) of hysterectomies are performed to treat non-neoplastic conditions which negatively impact women’s quality of life, such as bleeding leiomyomas and <b>hypermenorrhoea.</b> In recent years, hysterectomy rates are declining in Western countries after introduction of several alternative therapeutic options for benign diseases, such as hormonal medications, intrauterine levonorgestrel-releasing devices, endometrial ablation techniques, hysteroscopic and surgical myomectomy, ultrasound focused energy and transcatheter uterine artery embolisation. However, leiomyomas still account for approximately 40 – 62 % of all hysterectomies [1, 12 – 15].|$|E
40|$|The Dutch College of General Practitioners' {{practice}} guideline 'Vaginal bleeding' is {{a useful}} instrument for general practitioners. The changes in the present version are based on recent developments in diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities, such as (hydro-) ultrasonography to diagnose intracavitary abnormalities, progesterone-containing 'intra-uterine devices' (IUDs) and endoscopic techniques for destroying the endometrium. The recommendation to prescribe cyclical progestogens {{in the case of}} <b>hypermenorrhoea</b> is not supported by randomised studies. On balance, this guideline provides clear and useful advice for the treatment of abnormal vaginal blood los...|$|E
40|$|Objective. Pregnancy-related {{hypertensive}} disorders (PRHDs) are {{a leading}} cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality in developed countries. This study investigated a possible association of PRHDs with menstrual abnormalities. Materials and Methods. We contacted all women with PRHDs who delivered in our clinic between 2004 and 2007 as well as a random control cohort without pregnancy complications and asked them about their menstrual cycle characteristics. Statistical analyses were performed using R, with significance set at p 50. 05. Results. We collected data for 237 women with normal pregnancies and 255 women with PRHDs, among whom 143 had gestational hypertension and 70 had mild and 41 severe preeclampsia. By monovariate analysis, PRHDs correlated with dysmenorrhoea, <b>hypermenorrhoea</b> and menstrual irregularity (p 50. 05). By multivariate analysis, the occurrence of PRHDs was influenced by dysmenorrhoea and menstrual irregularity (p 50. 05). Conclusions. PRHDs usually affect women with painful or irregular menstrual cycles, perhaps due to metabolic syndrome or molecular pathways involving vasoactive substances, with clear vascular implication...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the nature and}} prevalence of menstrual disorders among the young female students at Zagazig University, Zagazig, Egypt. Study design: A questionnaire covering items on adolescents’ demographic data and menstruation characteristics was used for information collection. Results: A total of 283 questionnaires were analysed. The mean age at menarche was 12. 1  ±  1. 6  years {{with a range of}} 11 – 16  years. Oligomenorrhoea was reported by 17 girls (6. 0 %) while 6 others (2. 1 %) mentioned having polymenorrhoea. Hypomenorrhoea was noted in 20 students (7. 1 %), while <b>hypermenorrhoea</b> was reported by 15 (5. 3 %). Irregular periods were mentioned by 22 girls (7. 8 %). Dysmenorrhoea was reported in 185 students (65. 4 %). Out of these, 79 (27. 9 %) graded their pain as mild, 66 (23. 3 %) as moderate and 40 (14. 1 %) as severe. PMS was mentioned by 158 students (55. 8 %). Consulting somebody regarding their menstrual problems was reported by 32 students (11. 3 %). Conclusion: The results of this study are comparable to those {{in other parts of the}} world. Adolescents should be encouraged to chart their menstrual periods from menarche onwards in order to focus their attention on when and how to seek medical advice. Health education on menstrual disorders targeting adolescents and including education on reproductive health in the school/university curriculum may assist in early detection of these disorders...|$|E
