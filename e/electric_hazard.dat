40|$|Premio {{best paper}} award IEEE An IEC main {{protection}} against electric hazards by shock or burns or fire is the “active” measure. It {{is based on}} preventing {{the persistence of the}} electrical hazards limiting the time duration of the risk exposure to the contact for shock and fire and to the fault consequences. The active protection of detecting the hazardous fault and disconnecting automatically the supply is named in the paper “π-protection” to highlight the characteristic profile of the risk exposure. For studying the near miss incidents, complying with the Heinrich theory, characteristic parameters are introduced that allow dealing with the various classes of the “π -protection” like with dynamical collision problems. Considering the components of an <b>electric</b> <b>hazard</b> like massparticles in motion, the protection practice in IEC standards solves:- avoiding the “collision”, limiting the fault exposure time (probable protection);- controlling the “collision”, limiting the risk “weight” (safe conventional protection) or at the least limiting the colliding time (additional protection). In particular, the IEC approach recognizes the “π -protection”: - against indirect contact, coordinated with grounding, as acceptable, considering improbable the simultaneous operator contact (probable protection), and more as safe, if the limited exposure time guarantees also the prospective touch voltage lower than the safe admissible value (conventional protection), - against direct contact with the supply voltage to ground, as an additional protection (no-guaranteed safe), in spite of using residual current devices RCD up to 30 mA. The paper would highlight as uncovering the protection roots aids improving the safety culture...|$|E
40|$|Human skin has various pathologies in {{the form}} of acute and chronic diseases. Some are only {{cosmetic}} diseases which are not harmful for life but they can affect mental health and disrupt daily activities. Hyperhidrosis is one of these cosmetic diseases which may be caused by diabetes, infections, or thyroid hyper activity, or can be inherited. There are some examinations for testing hyperhidrosis, e. g. gravimetric and minor starch-iodine test. There are some devices that can measure sweat but are not specifically used or even intended for use on hyperhidrosis. A non-invasive prototype instrument called Electronic Sudometer using the principle of electrical impedance measurement has been developed. The philosophy behind this prototype is to make an instrument which can detect hyperhidrosis during homeostasis as well as in pathological condition. The device injects a sinusoid electric current and detects the ensuing voltage, which is proportional to the impedance of sweat on top of the skin during hyperhidrosis. For this prototype, the electrode system is made of brass rings mounted on a handle. The signal is then processed in electronic assembly. Processed output is transferred to a Laptop with specially made connecting wire. Computer having Sound Card Oscilloscope (Lab View based software) plots the signal and shows voltage level corresponding to sudor level. The signal output can also be displayed on a SmartPhone having software called Osciprime, requiring another specially made interface. Laboratory test results {{in the form}} of a plot of output voltage vs. impedance show accuracy of the device. The impedance results can be translated to sweat level because impedance decreases with increasing sweat during hyperhidrosis. The Sudometer was also calibrated using fixed precision resistors over its working range. Laboratory tests were carried out using an artificial skin at various sweat levels and to a yeast tissue model. Hydration of the artificial skin was quantified by weighing precision cut samples on a laboratory balance. Results from two test persons (the author and a student friend) are also included in this Master Thesis. During these experiments, the laptop computer and SmartPhone, respectively, were on internal battery to eliminate <b>electric</b> <b>hazard.</b> Any clinical device must be validated for accuracy and evaluated for safety before applying it on patients – the latter has not been done with the prototype. The author is aware of potential electrical risks, and thus the whole system was disconnected from mains 230 V during measurements on himself and a student friend. The device output seems to be well correlated to sweat level although electrolytes were not taken into account. Being a palmar hyperhidrosis patient himself, the author applied the Electronic Sudometer on his palms and the results look quite promising. At different environmental temperatures, the author checked elicited sweat responses. Patient safety is always a concern for clinicians regarding new devices. For this reason, the device itself has been made battery operated, and a new version will be entirely powered from a SmartPhone...|$|E

40|$|The {{touch or}} step {{voltages}} which {{exist in the}} vicinity of a grounding electrode are closely related to the earth structure and resistivity and the ground current. The grounding design approach is required to determine the grounding electrode location where the hazardous voltages are minimized. In this paper, in order to propose a method of mitigating the <b>electric</b> shock <b>hazards</b> caused by the ground surface potential rise {{in the vicinity of}} a counterpoise, the hazards relevant to touch voltage were evaluated {{as a function of the}} soil resistivity ratio for several practical values of two-layer earth structures. The touch voltage and current on the ground surface just above the test electrode are calculated with CDEGS program. As a consequence, it was found that burying a grounding electrode in the soil with low resistivity is effective to reduce the <b>electric</b> shock <b>hazards.</b> In the case that the bottom layer soil where a counterpoise is buried has lower resistivity than the upper layer soil, when the upper layer soil resistivity is increased, the surface potential is slightly raised, but the current through the human body is reduced with increasing the upper layer soil resistivity because of the greater contact resistance between the earth surface and the feet.

White Pikmin are swifter than the other types and can resist poisonous gases and will poison enemies if devoured, and can locate hidden treasures buried in the soil.

A complete design instead should {{take care of the}} connections of the portable equipment and of extension cords (as requested by NFPA 70) that are exposed to arc-faults and may cause fire and/or <b>electric</b> shock <b>hazard.</b> The cords supplying the Class II equipment are without a grounding protection conductor, so the failure of the double insulation, caused by external damage, can't be expected to be easily detected as a ground fault.

The authors highlight this worst case and suggest the protection achieved by wiring the circuits, particularly extension cords, with special power cables. Ground-fault-forced cables, GFFCs convert a line-to-line fault into a line to ground fault, that will be detected and protected by ordinary ground fault protective devices (GFPDs).

Camera traps were installed at each bridge, and local people were selected and trained to monitor overpass use over 15 months, from August 2008 to October 2009. Three species were recorded using canopy bridges: brown howler monkey (Alouatta guariba clamitans Cabrera, 1940), white-eared opossum (Didelphis albiventris Lund, 1840) and porcupine (Sphiggurus villosus Cuvier, 1823). Rope bridges with the highest number of species recorded had more forest cover and lower urban area around them than overpasses little used. Our results indicate that overpasses, in Porto Alegre, work as a linear corridor between forest remnants, although the outcomes for individual survival, group persistence, population demography or gene flow have not been measured.
