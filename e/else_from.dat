5|$|The {{bodies of}} the dead were buried in the St-Laurent-sur-Mer {{cemetery}} on 15 September 1942. The funeral was only attended by the local German and the French Gendarmarie commanders.

5|$|The Gepids were a major Germanic {{people in}} what is now eastern Hungary, western Romania, and {{northern}} Serbia. Although the details of his early life are not known, Thurisind is believed to have risen to power in about 548. After the death of Elemund, the previous king, he seized the throne in a coup d'état and forced Elemund's son Ostrogotha into exile. Ostrogotha and his followers found refuge among the Gepids' neighbours and enemies, the Lombards, another Germanic people who had just settled {{in the western part of}} the Pannonian Basin. The Gepids had inhabited parts of the basin since the 3rd century. They reached prominence in the 5th century when, under King Ardaric, they played a key role in destroying the Hunnic Empire. Ardaric and his people benefited more than anybody <b>else</b> <b>from</b> this victory, gaining the former Roman province of Dacia.|$|E

25|$|The {{urbanisation}} {{and development}} of Whitefield largely coincided with the Industrial Revolution. The name Whitefield is thought to derive from the medieval bleachfields used by Flemish settlers to whiten their woven fabrics, or <b>else</b> <b>from</b> the wheat crop once cultivated in the district. The construction of a major roads routed through the village facilitated Whitefield's expansion into a mill town during the mid-19th century. Whitefield was created a local government district in 1866, and was governed by a local board of health until 1894, when {{the area of the}} local board became an urban district.|$|E

25|$|Jacob (Jacobus; {{sometimes}} James) Metius (after 15711624/1631) was a Dutch instrument-maker and {{a specialist}} in grinding lenses. He was born and died in Alkmaar and was the brother of Adriaan Adriaanszoon (simply called Metius). He {{is one of three}} people associated with the invention of the telescope, the other two being Hans Lippershey and Zacharias Janssen. Not much of him is known besides his 1608 patent application for the invention. He died in Alkmaar between 1624 and 1631. Metius may have made many inventions but kept them secret. Before his death he destroyed them all to prevent anyone <b>else</b> <b>from</b> claiming them.|$|E
25|$|However, {{seeing as}} the second innings did not start for England until the fourth day a result seemed unlikely. Strauss made up for his first effort by making a 128 but little <b>else</b> <b>from</b> the team was worth mention as they {{declared}} a few overs into the last day, leaving the tourists with a deficit of 379 to chase in 73 overs. After Salman Butt fell from the first delivery to Hoggard, things seemed hopeful, even more so after Imran Farhat fell at 33 but Faisal Iqbal's slow, but firm scoring rate took them to before tea, leaving Inzy and Abdul Razzaq to bat out the last session for 73 before a draw was confirmed.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{the name}} Linux is a {{trademark}} registered to Linus Torvalds. Initially, nobody registered it, but on August 15, 1994, William R. Della Croce, Jr. filed for the trademark Linux, and then demanded royalties from Linux distributors. In 1996, Torvalds and some affected organizations sued {{him to have}} the trademark assigned to Torvalds, and, in 1997, the case was settled. The licensing of the trademark has since been handled by the Linux Mark Institute (LMI). Torvalds has stated that he trademarked the name only to prevent someone <b>else</b> <b>from</b> using it. LMI originally charged a nominal sublicensing fee {{for use of the}} Linux name as part of trademarks, but later changed this in favor of offering a free, perpetual worldwide sublicense.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{frequent}} {{uses of the}} technique is to date organic remains from archaeological sites. Plants fix atmospheric carbon during photosynthesis, so the level of 14C in plants and animals when they die approximately equals the level of 14C in the atmosphere at that time. However, it decreases thereafter from radioactive decay, allowing the date of death or fixation to be estimated. The initial 14C level for the calculation can either be estimated, or else directly compared with known year-by-year data from tree-ring data (dendrochronology) up to 10,000 years ago (using overlapping data from live and dead trees in a given area), or <b>else</b> <b>from</b> cave deposits (speleothems), back to about 45,000 years before the present. A calculation or (more accurately) a direct comparison of carbon-14 levels in a sample, with tree ring or cave-deposit carbon-14 levels of a known age, then gives the wood or animal sample age-since-formation.|$|E
25|$|With {{help from}} Baroaba who stays {{to care for}} the ill José, Paifu and Maruyama finally reach the summit of the mountain.

On the way down the mountain, Maruyama accidentally slips and falls off. Paifu makes a daring rescue by learning flight at the last minute and saves Maruyama and himself from immediate death. On the way back, Maruyama talks of how he is going to buy a boat with the money he makes forcing Paifu to reveal that he had lied to him about the payment of 1,000,000 yen. Maruyama admits that he is disappointed, but not infuriated as Paifu saved his life. The four are praised as they returned to the village. One month later, Paifu, Jose and everyone <b>else</b> <b>from</b> the village meet Maruyama out at sea with a ghost boat that all fixed up together.|$|E
500|$|For a few days, Ava was {{directly}} underneath Skylab {{during its first}} manned mission.

The door may be open for potential abuse with appointments based on some political agenda rather than merit. The counterpoint is that it is precisely those in power who are best placed to scrutinize bills for illegitimate differentiating measures, because [...] "it is often those with political affiliations who can make the biggest contribution to the discussion; if nothing <b>else,</b> <b>from</b> the folly and error of their past ways".|$|E
