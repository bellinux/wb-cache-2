2500|$|Lutz {{left the}} Gaiety in 1894 and was {{replaced}} by Ivan Caryll. [...] For the Opera Comique in 1895, Lutz composed A Model Trilby, or A Day or Two after du Maurier. He also wrote additional songs for Baron <b>Golosh</b> for the Trafalgar Theatre (1895). Lutz wrote a string quartet and ballads such as [...] "Thy Silv'ry Tones", [...] "Enchant Mine Ear" [...] and [...] "Sail on Silver Cloud." [...] In the last years of the 19th century, Lutz conducted a band playing Summer seasons at the spa in Scarborough. He continued to compose songs into the 20th century, including music for Hidenseek (1901) and a few numbers for Ivan Caryll and Cecil Cook's The Girl from Kays (1902). [...] However, Lutz seems to have run low on funds, as another benefit was held for him on 28 November 1901 at the Gaiety Theatre, organised by George Edwardes.|$|E

50|$|Lonnen began {{acting as}} a child in {{pantomime}} and other theatre in the British provinces. He made his London debut in 1885 and appeared in several of the famous Gaiety burlesques from 1887 to 1891. He starred in such other major works as Little Christopher Columbus (1893), Baron <b>Golosh</b> (1895) and The Messenger Boy (1900) before dying at the age of 44.|$|E
50|$|Russell played {{roles in}} the musical comedies {{including}} A Gaiety Girl (1894), Baron <b>Golosh</b> (1895), The Yashmak (1897), and the highly successful Veronique, The Geisha, A Greek Slave and San Toy (most at Daly's Theatre), between 1898 and 1902 under the management of George Edwardes. From 1902 to 1904, Russell returned to D'Oyly Carte, appearing in his old tenor roles and adding to his repertoire the Duke of Dunstable in Patience, Earl Tolloller in Iolanthe, Marco in The Gondoliers and Ralph Rackstraw in H.M.S. Pinafore.|$|E

5000|$|In {{addition}} to appearing on stage, Grey also taught dance to actors and to wealthy clients, {{some of whom}} were drawn from the aristocracy. This provided her with a greater income than that she received from performing at the Gaiety. Among her many prominent students was Ellen Terry. [...] Grey married in 1893, and her last West End performance was as the Countess Acacia in Baron <b>Golosh</b> in 1895 at the Trafalgar Theatre. During World War I, she ran an Australian Officer's Club in London. She made several French films in the 1920s, including Le Secret de Rosette Lambert (1920), La Maison du mystère (1923, as Marjorie) and Comment j'ai tué mon enfant (1925).|$|E
50|$|Perry {{then joined}} the London company in 1893 {{to create the}} role of Milly (later taking {{over the role of}} Bab) in Jane Annie at the Savoy Theatre. She {{continued}} performing at the Savoy for the next two years, creating the role of Princess Kalyba in Utopia Limited (1893-94), Bianca in Mirette (1894) and Dolly Grigg in The Chieftain (1894-95). Perry left the D'Oyly Carte organisation in 1895 to appear as Clementine in Baron <b>Golosh</b> at the Trafalgar Square Theatre. That same year, she returned to D'Oyly Carte on tour as Josephine in H.M.S. Pinafore, Yum-Yum in The Mikado and both Dolly Grigg and Rita in The Chieftain. Returning to London, she took over for Marie Tempest as Adele in An Artist's Model at the Lyric Theatre during the summer of 1895.|$|E

60|$|The father, {{as soon as}} he had rid {{himself of}} his upper coat, his {{dripping}} hat, and his <b>goloshes,</b> stood up {{with his back to the}} bar-room fire, with his hands in his trousers-pockets, and the tails of his coat stuck inside his arms.|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{one would}} regret {{anything}} {{in the nature of}} an interference by the Archdeacon more than I. I trust it will not come to that. But, for the last time, where are your <b>goloshes?</b> The thing is too bad, especially after what uncle said." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{most of us}} {{are getting}} so thin-skinned, so {{dependent}} upon steam-heat and <b>goloshes,</b> that the actions of a man like this riding forth upon his trail {{at all hours of the}} day and night self-sufficing and serene, seem like the doings of an epic, and so indeed they are.|$|R
5000|$|Lonnen {{made his}} London debut as Tancred in Falka at the Avenue Theatre in 1885 and {{subsequently}} starred {{in a series}} of successful musical burlesques at the Gaiety Theatre in London, including Miss Esmeralda as Frollo (1887, in which he sang Killaloe, perhaps his most popular song), Frankenstein, or The Vampire's Victim (1887), Faust up to date as Mephistopheles (1888), Carmen up to Data as José (1890) and Cinder Ellen up too Late as Prince Belgravia (1891). After this, he starred in another burlesque hit, Little Christopher Columbus, as O'hoolegan (1893 at the Lyric Theatre), in the title role of the operetta Baron <b>Golosh</b> (1895 at the Trafalgar Theatre), and in La Béarnaise as Girafo (1896 at the Prince of Wales's Theatre). In the burlesque Monte Cristo Junr at the Gaiety, he sang the song [...] "Ballyhooly". He also starred in the musical comedy hit The Messenger Boy as Cosmos Bey (1900 at the Gaiety).|$|E
60|$|He hesitated. He wanted, {{more than}} {{anything}} else in the world, to be in the midst of heroic effort. The gods had set the stage for epic action that night, and his spirit was big with desire for bigness. It was very hard to promise to put <b>goloshes</b> upon his winged feet.|$|R
2500|$|Hans Christian Andersen wrote a {{fairy tale}} The <b>Goloshes</b> of Fortune about magic galoshes which made every wish of their bearers true, but this often didn't bring them real fortune or happiness.

60|$|He played tennis {{ten hours}} {{a day on the}} average.

6000|$|... "I sha'n't be two minutes," [...] said Mrs. Jerry, in a flutter, {{and went}} off hastily for her <b>goloshes,</b> while he looked fondly after her. At {{the turn of the}} stair she glanced back, and his eyes were still begging her to hurry. It was a gracious memory to her in the after years, for she never saw him again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Want? He wants us. And we, my poor Watson, want {{overcoats}} and cravats and <b>goloshes,</b> {{and every}} aid that man ever invented {{to fight the}} weather. Wait a bit, though!

6000|$|The dear angel! I met poor Frank in Bond Street only yesterday; but {{he crossed}} {{over to the}} other side of the way. He had on <b>goloshes,</b> and is grown very fat and pale. He has shaved off his moustaches, and, instead, wears a respirator. He has taken his name off all his clubs, and lives very grimly in Baker Street. Well, ladies, no doubt you say he is right: and what are the odds, so long as YOU are happy? ...|$|R
6000|$|So much seethes {{about the}} plain {{discussion}} {{of the question of}} sexual institutions.

As well might she ask, [...] "Why shouldn't I keep my sandwiches in the Ark of the Covenant? There's room!" [...] "Of course there's room," [...] one answers, [...] "but--As things are, Madam, it is inadvisable to try. You see --for one thing--people are so peculiar.

500|$|Jeremy sucks his sore fingers, but a trout {{rises from}} the water and seizes him with a snap (Mr. Jeremy screams, [...] "OW-OW-OW!!!").

He scrambles up the bank and hops home through the meadow, having lost his fishing equipment but quite sure he will never go fishing again.|$|R
6000|$|... {95a} This is {{a remarkably}} {{difficult}} story to believe. [...] "The morning bright and calm" [...] is {{lit by the}} rays of the moon.

60|$|Felix, then, {{is a young}} {{gentleman who}} lives {{at home with his}} mother, just within the twopenny-post office circle of three miles from St. Martin-le-Grand. He wears Indiarubber <b>goloshes</b> when the weather is at all damp, and always has a silk {{handkerchief}} neatly folded up in the right-hand pocket of his great-coat, to tie over his mouth when he goes home at night; moreover, being rather near-sighted, he carries spectacles for particular occasions, and has a weakish tremulous voice, of which he makes great use, for he talks as much as any old lady breathing.|$|R
6000|$|... (He {{does not}} fail her. As quietly {{as if he}} were in <b>goloshes,</b> mind as well as feet, he dismisses the domestics; they go {{according}} to precedence as they entered, yet, in a moment, they are gone. Then he signs to MR. TREHERNE, and they conduct LORD LOAM with dignity from the room. His hands are still catching flies; he still mutters, 'The proverb--that proverb'; but he continues, owing to CRICHTON'S skilful treatment, to look every inch a peer. The ladies have now an opportunity to air their indignation.) ...|$|R
