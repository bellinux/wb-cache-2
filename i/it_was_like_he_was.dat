5000|$|Howling Bells {{sought a}} {{producer}} that had experience working on electronic-sounding records. Producer and mixer, Dan Grech-Marguerat, {{who had previously}} worked with Howling Bells' manager, had listened to demos of the new tracks. The band knew of his collaborations with Radiohead and Air, and thought he could help develop their new sound. He came to their rehearsal studio with handwritten notes about the new songs and expressed what he could add. This encouraged the band, and they agreed to let him produce the album. Dan challenged us a lot as well, which we’ve never had before. He {{had a lot of}} inspiring ideas. Basically <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> part of the band {{for the duration of the}} time we were working with him, which was really, really good. -Joel referring to Dan Grech-Marguerat.|$|E
5000|$|Nomi {{came to the}} {{attention}} of New York City's art scene in 1978 with his performance in [...] "New Wave Vaudeville", a four-night event MC'd by artist David McDermott. Dressed in a skin-tight spacesuit with clear plastic cape, Nomi sang the aria Mon cœur s'ouvre à ta voix ("My heart opens to your voice") from Camille Saint-Saëns' 1877 opera Samson et Dalila. The performance ended with a chaotic crash of strobe lights, smoke bombs, and loud electronic sound effects as Nomi backed away into the smoke. Joey Arias recalled: [...] "I still get goose pimples when I think about it... <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> from a different planet and his parents were calling him home. When the smoke cleared, he was gone." [...] The reaction was so overwhelmingly positive that he was invited to perform at clubs all over New York City.|$|E

I was {{covering}} the second-place horse, which wound up being Sham. It looked like Sham's race going into the last turn, I think. The {{thing you have to}} understand is that Sham was fast, a beautiful horse. He would have had the Triple Crown in another year. And it just didn't seem like there could be anything faster than that. Everybody was watching him. It was over, more or less. And {{all of a sudden there}} was this, like, just a disruption in the corner of your eye, in your peripheral vision. And then before you could make out what it was, here Secretariat came. And then Secretariat had passed him. No one had ever seen anything run like that - a lot of the old guys said the same thing. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> some other animal out there.|$|E
5000|$|While {{working at}} General Hospital, Jackson starred {{in his first}} feature film Camp Nowhere, as Morris [...] "Mud" [...] Himmel in 1994. Also during this time he starred in made-for-television films Prisoner of Zenda, Inc. and The Legend of the Ruby Silver, and made a guest {{appearance}} during Season 5 of the ABC sitcom Boy Meets World. In 1999, Jackson filmed The Deep End of the Ocean shortly before leaving General Hospital, starring opposite Michelle Pfeiffer. Deep End director Ulu Grosbard spoke of Jackson as [...] "an enormously gifted actor. He brought a weight and a presence and chemistry with Michelle from the beginning. Hes only 15 {{years old and he}} is a very serious actor who has both concentration and humor." [...] Pfeiffer added, [...] "When Jonathan and I read together, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> my own son. And we just went at each other in only this way that a mother and son could do. His reading was exhilarating."

5000|$|In the 1970s Brautigan {{experimented with}} {{literary}} genres. He published five novels (the first of which, The Abortion: An Historical Romance 1966, {{had been written}} in the mid-1960s) {{and a collection of}} short stories, Revenge of the Lawn (1971). In 1974 The Cowell Press collected seven of his broadside poems into the book Seven Watermelon Suns. The limited edition of ten copies included embossed color etchings by Ellen Meske. [...] "When the 1960s ended, he was the baby thrown out with the bath water," [...] said his friend and fellow writer, Thomas McGuane. [...] "He was a gentle, troubled, deeply odd guy." [...] Generally dismissed by literary critics and increasingly abandoned by his readers, Brautigan's popularity waned throughout the late 1970s and 1980s. His work remained popular in Europe, however, as well as in Japan, where Brautigan visited several times. To his critics, Brautigan was willfully naive. Lawrence Ferlinghetti said of him, [...] "As an editor I was always waiting for Richard to grow up as a writer. It seems to me he was essentially a naïf, and I don't think he cultivated that childishness, I think it came naturally. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> much more in tune with the trout in America than with people." ...|$|E
5000|$|On 30 July 2012, {{the trailer}} {{for the series}} premiered. Entitled [...] "Whose Time Is Now?", it {{features}} six former The X Factor contestants—winners Lewis, Alexandra Burke and Little Mix, and runners-up JLS and Murs and third place One Direction—talking about their time {{on the show and}} how it changed their lives. Male winners Steve Brookstein, Shayne Ward, Leon Jackson, Joe McElderry and Matt Cardle were not included. Ward blasted this, calling the show [...] "pathetic" [...] for leaving him out and saying <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> [...] "being erased slowly from their history." [...] McElderry, who won in 2009, said [...] "I'm just gonna keep doing my thing", which many fans believed to be prompted by the trailer. McElderry later admitted that he was not angry about not being included in the trailer. In an interview with the Daily Star Sunday, he said: [...] "I'm not on Simon Cowell's label so I wouldn't expect him to promote me. If they want to erase the fact I won The X Factor or try to hide it, I don't care. Personally I am proud I came from The X Factor. If Cowell doesn't feel the same then you'll have to ask him why." ...|$|E

[...] "And even though I accept that it has always been the keystone of my musical foundation, I still would not regard it as an obsession; instead, I prefer {{to think of it as}} a landmark that I navigate by, whenever I feel myself going adrift. I am talking, of course, about the work of Robert Johnson. Up until I heard his music, everything I had ever heard seemed as if it was dressed up for a shop window somewhere, so that when I heard him for the first time, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> singing only for himself, and now and then, maybe God. At first, it scared me in its intensity, and I could only take it in small doses. Then I would build up strength and take a little more, but I could never really get away from it, and in the end, it spoiled me for everything else. Now, after all these years, his music is like my oldest friend, always in the back of my head, and on the horizon. It is the finest music I have ever heard. I have always trusted its purity, and I always will".|$|E

Silky Sullivan's first race was a 5 furlong dash for maidens at Hollywood Park Racetrack on May 17, 1957. Cornell said, [...] "He {{came out of the}} gate in a trance and a truss and I said, here's one for the glue factory. Then all of a sudden, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> stung by a bee. Until he made that big move, I thought I'd be looking for a job." [...] His jockey, George Taniguchi, said, [...] "He broke with the field and then {{it was as if he}} was sucked back, and I thought oh, my God, what's he doing? He was immediately 10 or 20 lengths behind the other horses. I let him go like that until the three-eighths pole and finally gave him a tap on the shoulder, and then he changed gears. I never thought we'd catch up, we were so far back, but I never rode anything like that before. We were flying." [...] In his debut, Silky Sullivan was 8th in a field of 12 and about 8 lengths back, when he came on to win by a nose.|$|E
5000|$|Little Yellow Jacket {{made his}} {{debut in the}} PBR in the year 1999 and went to his first PBR World Finals that year. Little Yellow Jacket competed {{in the major leagues}} of the PBR - the Built Ford Tough Series (BFTS) (known as the Bud Light Cup Series until 2003) {{starting}} in his first year. From the beginning {{to the end of his}} career, Little Yellow Jacket was said to either help a rider earn a career-making 90 point ride or land his face in the dirt. The bull seemed to know when he won. [...] After he bucked someone off, he would seek his owner Joe Berger out for his approval. He might also show himself off to the crowd. [...] "They'd put him in the chute and he'd go out, throw the guy off and would prance around, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> saying, 'I knew I could bust your rear,'" [...] Tom Teague said. [...] "But if a rider happened to ride him, he'd better look out, because Little Yellow Jacket just might try to hook him." [...] But in the end, Little Yellow Jacket never hurt anyone. He mostly had a reputation for being a gentle bull. As a rule, he did not try to go after the fallen riders and it even seemed like he tried to move around them and avoid stepping on them.|$|E
5000|$|A young ACLU {{volunteer}} {{attorney who}} represents Richard and Mildred Loving. In 2014, while watching television in New Orleans {{during the filming}} of Midnight Special, Nichols {{was struck by the}} realization that Nick Kroll looked remarkably like Bernie Cohen, to which Nichols noted, [...] "I went online and watched more of Kroll, and began to envision him as a good fit for Bernie." [...] Nichols furthered his remark on his inspired choice of Kroll, [...] "... Then you find out Jules B. Kroll went to Georgetown Law just like Bernie Cohen did. I don't know. It just started to make sense. He came to Austin to see me and talk about the part. Honestly, I just thought it was an inspired choice." [...] On the quality of Cohen, Nichols stated, [...] "Bernie had this quality of performance ... <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> performing, but I also felt like it could happen in the scene where he first meets Richard and Mildred. There are no cameras in the room, but he is putting on a performance to persuade them that he is the right lawyer for their case, even if he isn’t entirely sure of that himself. At the end of the scene, you see him sort of break character." [...] Kroll was not only familiar with the Lovings' story but also with Nichols' work, with him stating, [...] "I'd seen Take Shelter and Mud, and thought they were phenomenal movies. They are quite different from one another and yet you can still feel the larger hand at work; Nichols has a very special touch that he brings to his films. It was exciting to get the call that I was being considered for LOVING, because of this filmmaker and this subject." [...] On taking the role of Cohen, Kroll began to remark, [...] "The story of Richard and Mildred Loving is such a beautiful, important story about two people who love each other and that want to be together and were brave enough to go through the legal system to make that happen for themselves and in the end for millions of people ... So, in that regard, it seemed like something it would be an honour to be a part of." [...] Kroll highlighted his own numerous ties to the Loving case: [...] "Weirdly, my father went to Georgetown Law school almost exactly when Bernie was going there ... And my dad actually worked for Robert F. Kennedy while he was in school: he worked at RFK's office and then actually ran his campaign in Queens when he was running for president. And I went to Georgetown. So I had a number of weird connections to the whole thing, including the fact that I've played a defense lawyer before, {{a very different kind of}} defense lawyer, in that Rodney Ruxin represented the worst people in the world." [...] In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Kroll spoke of the presidential election, while stating, [...] "I think a lot of people see hope in and Mildred Loving's story. They see the power of the individual and their ability to make change in the country outside of the system." ...|$|E
