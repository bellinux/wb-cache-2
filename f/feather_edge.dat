60|$|The {{flight of}} an owl, {{noiseless}} as {{the sweep of}} a cloud shadow, is the most remarkable thing about him. The wings are remarkably adapted to the silent movement that is essential to surprising birds at dusk. The feathers are long and soft. The laminæ extending from the wing quills, instead of ending in the sharp <b>feather</b> <b>edge</b> of other birds, are all drawn out to fine hair points, through which the air can make no sound as it rushes in the swift wing-beats. The whish of a duck's wings can be heard two or three hundred yards on a still night. The wings of an eagle rustle like silk in the wind as he mounts upward. A sparrow's wings flutter or whir as he changes his flight. Every one knows the startled rush of a quail or grouse. But no ear ever heard the passing of a great owl, spreading his five-foot wings in rapid flight.|$|E

50|$|A {{strip of}} tissue is torn {{away from the}} main sheet using a water tear. This is done by wetting the paper along the area to be torn and then pulling {{sideways}} with the fingers to separate the strip {{from the rest of}} the sheet of tissue, so that it will have <b>feathered</b> <b>edges.</b> The fibers in these <b>feathered</b> <b>edges</b> will allow the tissue to have a firmer hold on the mended paper and also to blend in with it once dried.|$|R

50|$|At the hood-ends of the strakes, {{where they}} {{approach}} the stem, they are let into each other with geralds (aka chases or gains). In these, {{the land of the}} lower strake is tapered to a <b>feather</b> <b>edge</b> {{at the end of the}} land where it is supported by the rebate formed by the apron. The strakes then meet the stem flush, which is also referred to as being hooded.|$|E

50|$|The {{principle}} of original horizontality states that any archaeological layer deposited in an unconsolidated form will tend towards a horizontal deposition. Strata which are found with tilted surfaces were so originally deposited, or lie {{in conformity with}} the contours of a pre-existing basin of deposition. The {{principle of}} lateral continuity states that any archaeological deposit, as originally laid down, will be bounded by {{the edge of the}} basin of deposition, or will thin down to a <b>feather</b> <b>edge.</b> Therefore, if any edge of the deposit is exposed in a vertical plane view, a part of its original extent must have been removed by excavation or erosion: its continuity must be sought, or its absence explained.|$|E
50|$|Wooden planks can be scarfed into a strake by {{suitably}} tapering {{the thickness}} of the adjoining ends. Traditionally, the adjoining faces were coated with mixed white lead and grease, then held together with copper rivets. It was important to not have the plank end as thin as a <b>feather</b> <b>edge</b> and to have the outboard thin edge at the after end of the joint. In later times, after adhesives had been developed by the aircraft industry, the joint might be made with resin glue and no rivets. In heavier carvel work, the joint would be a butt, riveted to a butt strap. Even large clinker vessels had scarfed strakes as in this form of construction; the strakes contribute a significant proportion of the structural strength of the boat as well as keeping it water-tight.|$|E
50|$|In {{building}} a simple pulling boat, the keel, hog, stem, apron, deadwoods, sternpost and perhaps transom are assembled and securely set up. In normal practice, {{this will be}} the same way up as they will be in use. From the hog, the garboard, bottom, bilge, topside and sheer strakes are planked up, held together along their lands by copper rivets. At the stem and, in a double-ended boat, the sternpost, geralds are formed. That is, in each case, the land of the lower strake is tapered to a <b>feather</b> <b>edge</b> {{at the end of the}} strake where it meets the stem or stern-post. This allows the end of the strake to be screwed to the apron with the outside of the planking mutually flush at that point and flush with the stem. This means that the boat's passage through the water will not tend to lift the ends of the planking away from the stem. Before the next plank is laid up, the face of the land on the lower strake is bevelled to suit the angle at which the next strake will lie in relation with it. This varies all along the land. Gripes are used to hold the new strake in position on the preceding one before the fastening is done.|$|E

40|$|Sub-gingival margin {{placement}} {{is sometimes}} required due to different reasons {{and is often}} associated with adverse periodontal reactions. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if a single restoration with subgingival margin on a tooth, in the maxillary anterior zone, would affect its periodontal soft tissue parameters, and whether or not a deep chamfer preparation has a different influence in the periodontium when compared to a <b>feather</b> <b>edge</b> preparation. Plaque and gingival indexes, periodontal probing depth, bleeding on probing and patient’s biotype were registered. 106 teeth were prepared with a deep chamfer, while 94 were prepared with a <b>feather</b> <b>edge</b> finishing line. Six and twelve month after the restorations delivery the same parameters were evaluated. Repeated measure one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) (α= 0. 05) was used. At six months the patient A statistically significant difference between baseline and the 6 and 12 -month follow up is present in regards to plaque index, gingival index and periodontal probing depth, but no statistically significant difference between chamfer and <b>feather</b> <b>edge</b> finishing lines. There is a statistically significant difference between baseline and the 6 and 12 -month follow up in regards to bleeding on probing. <b>Feather</b> <b>edge</b> preparation presents significantly more bleeding on probing and less gingival recession than the chamfer. Sub-gingival margins do influence the periodontal soft tissue response. Statistically significant difference exists between <b>feather</b> <b>edge</b> and chamfer finishing lines in regards to bleeding on probing and gingival recession.

40|$|SUMMARY The {{present in}} vitro study aimed {{to assess the}} effects of root surface {{mechanical}} instrumentation on the marginal integrity and adaptation of resin composite crowns. The following null hypotheses were tested: no differences exist between finish line and 1) marginal gap or 2) marginal microleakage before and after manual mechanical periodontal maintenance. A total of 56 intact human mandibular molars were randomly distributed into four groups and subjected to standardized tooth preparations for indirect composite crowns with different marginal finish lines (90 ° shoulder, beveled 90 ° shoulder, <b>feather</b> <b>edge,</b> chamfer). One-half of the specimens {{was used as a}} control and remained untreated, and the remaining half was subjected to root surface procedures simulating five years of semestral mechanical supportive periodontal treatment. The marginal gap and microleakage were evaluated and statistically analyzed. The specimens used as controls showed lower mean marginal gaps than those subjected to the simulated periodontal treatment, whereas the latter showed lower microleakage than the control crowns. Statistically significant differences were recorded for both the experimental variables. The root surface procedures resulted in altered surfaces of the composite crowns. The marginal gap increased after the treatment, whereas the marginal microleakage was reduced. The 90 ° shoulder and the chamfer preparation could be considered a viable option to fabricate composite crowns, but the beveled 90 ° shoulder and the <b>feather</b> <b>edge</b> should not be recommended...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The Tertiary Grds de Ville in the Barr~me Basin of the French Alps is convention-ally {{considered}} to be the <b>feather</b> <b>edge</b> equivalent to the Gr 6 s d'Annot o the east. Both units accumulated in a province of thrust-sheet-top basins behind the initial thrust front and were supplied from a southerly hinterland (Maures-Esterel/Corsica Sardinia). The units are also partially coeval, with the Grds de Ville being equivalent to the youngest part of the Gr~s d'Annot. However, the units accumulated in structurally distinct sub-basins that were separated by a fold (the S Lions anticline) that was growing at the time of Gr 6 s de Ville deposition. The Gr+s de Ville accumulated close to storm wave base, whereas deposition of the Gr~s d'Annot was notably deeper, indicating that the Barr~me Basin was structurally higher than the Gr~s d'Annot Basin. There is also evidence that the Gr 6 s de Ville and the Gr 6 s d'Annot were fed by separate sediment transport paths linked to different drainage basins in the hinterland. It is therefore an oversimplification to regard the Gr+s de Ville as a <b>feather</b> <b>edge</b> to the Gr 6 s d'Annot; instead it should be regarded s an independent element of the fill of the Barr~me Basin. The Gr 6 s de Ville is a distinctive Tertiary-age sandstone unit exposed in the Barr 6 me Basin, SE France, {{to the west of the}} Gr 6 s d'Annot out-crop area.

30|$|The Atlantic Coastal Plain, Province {{of eastern}} North America, is the {{emergent}} {{part of a}} platform on a passive continental margin and is currently characterized by incised valleys that separate flat interfluves (Farrell et al. 2013).

This clastic wedge attains a maximum thickness of 3009  m (9854  ft) on land at Cape Hatteras (Lawrence and Hoffman 1993) and includes deposits of Cretaceous to Quaternary age (Brown et al. 1972). The sediment composition and recurring sedimentary facies on the NC Coastal Plain have been summarized by Farrell et al. (2012, 2013).|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a technique to}} automatically detect the working area of peripheral blood smears stained with May‐Grünwuald Giemsa. The optimal area {{is defined as the}} well spread part of the smear. This zone starts when the erythrocytes stop overlapping (on the body film side) and finishes when the erythrocytes start losing their clear central zone (on the <b>feather</b> <b>edge</b> side). The approach yields a quick detection of this area in images scanned under low magnifying power (immersion objective × 25 or × 16). The algorithm consists of two stages. First, an image analysis procedure using mathematical morphology is applied for extracting the erythrocytes, the centers of erythrocytes and the erythrocytes with center. Second, the number of connected components from the three kinds of particles is counted and the coefficient of spreading ρs and the coefficient of overlapping ρo are calculated. The data from fourteen smears illustrate how the technique is used and its performance. Colour figures can be viewed on [URL]...|$|E

40|$|Multi-channel seismic {{reflection}} profiles {{across the}} southwest continental margin of India (SWCMI) show presence of westerly dipping seismic reflectors beneath sedimentary strata {{along the western}} flank of the Laccadive Ridge – northernmost part of the Chagos–Laccadive Ridge system. Velocity structure, seismic character, 2 D gravity model and geographic locations of the dipping reflectors suggest that these reflectors are volcanic in origin, which are interpreted as Seaward Dipping Reflectors (SDRs). The SDRs; 15 to 27 km wide overlain by ∼ 1 km thick sediment; are observed at three locations and characterized by stack of laterally continuous, divergent and off-lapping reflectors. Occurrence of SDRs along western flank of the Laccadive Ridge adjacent to oceanic crust of the Arabian Basin and 2 D crustal model deduced from free-air gravity anomaly suggest that they are genetically related to incipient volcanism during separation of Madagascar from India. We suggest that (i) SWCMI is a volcanic passive margin developed during India–Madagascar breakup in the Late Cretaceous, and (ii) continent–ocean transition lies at western margin of the Laccadive Ridge, west of <b>feather</b> <b>edge</b> of the SDRs. Occurrence of SDRs on western flank of the Laccadive Ridge and inferred zone of transition from continent to ocean further suggest continental nature of crust of the Laccadive Ridge...|$|E
40|$|Methane can be {{released}} from the vast marine hydrate reservoirs that surround continents into oceans and perhaps the atmosphere. But how these pathways work within the global carbon cycle now and during a warmer world is only partially understood. Here we use 3 -D seismic data to identify what we interpret to be a gas venting system that bypasses the hydrate stability zone (HSZ) offshore of Mauritania. This venting is manifested {{by the presence of}} the acoustic wipe-out (AWO) across a densely faulted succession above a salt diapir and a set of morphological features including a substantial, ∼ 260 m wide and ∼ 32 m deep, pockmark at the seabed. The base of the HSZ is marked by a bottom simulating reflector (BSR) which deflects upwards above the diapir, rather than mimicking the seabed. We use a numerical modelling to show that this deflection is caused by the underlying salt diapir. It creates a trapping geometry for gas sealed by hydrate-clogged sediment. After entering the HSZ, some methane accumulated as hydrate in the levees of a buried canyon. Venting in this locality probably reduces the flux of gas to the landward limit of <b>feather</b> <b>edge</b> of hydrate, reducing the volume of gas that would be susceptible for release during a warmer world...|$|E
