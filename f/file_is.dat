5|$|Released (19.1.0.28) on September 6, 2011, Norton Internet Security 2012 {{brought new}} {{features}}. One {{of the new}} features included in the new release is Download Insight 2.0, which not only monitors files for safety but also the stability of a given file. That means that if a <b>file</b> <b>is</b> stable on Windows 7, but unstable on Windows XP, XP users will be notified of the file's instability.|$|E
5|$|The NTFS {{file system}} used by recent {{versions}} of Windows stores the file with a UTC time stamp, but displays it corrected to local—or seasonal—time. However, the FAT filesystem commonly used on removable devices stores only the local time. Consequently, when a <b>file</b> <b>is</b> copied {{from the hard}} disk onto separate media, its time will be set to the current local time. If the time adjustment is changed, the timestamps of the original file and the copy will be different. The same effect can be observed when compressing and uncompressing files with some file archivers. It is the NTFS file that changes seen time. This effect {{should be kept in}} mind when trying to determine if a <b>file</b> <b>is</b> a duplicate of another, although there are other methods of comparing files for equality (such as using a checksum algorithm).|$|E
5|$|It was {{announced}} in May 2011 that Square Enix will be releasing Dragon Quest III in Japan, as both the Famicom and Super Famicom ports {{as part of the}} September released of Dragon Quest 25th Anniversary Commemoration Famicom & Super Famicom Dragon Quest I & II & III for the Wii. A quick save feature was added to this version of the game, allowing for pauses at any time, but the save <b>file</b> <b>is</b> deleted upon resuming.|$|E
50|$|IPF <b>files</b> <b>are</b> {{compiled}} {{using the}} IPF Compiler (IPFC) into viewable INF or HLP files. IPF HLP <b>files</b> <b>are</b> {{distinct from the}} WinHelp HLP <b>files</b> that <b>are</b> prevalent in Windows.|$|R
50|$|The archive becomes damage-prone. If {{the area}} holding shared data for several <b>files</b> <b>is</b> damaged, all those <b>files</b> <b>are</b> lost.|$|R
50|$|<b>Files</b> <b>are</b> {{properly}} called {{data sets}} in MVS. Names of those <b>files</b> <b>are</b> organized in catalogs that <b>are</b> VSAM <b>files</b> themselves.|$|R
5|$|When an SSD {{is writing}} {{large amounts of}} data sequentially, the write {{amplification}} is equal to one meaning there is no write amplification. The reason is as the data is written, the entire block is filled sequentially with data related to the same file. If the OS determines that <b>file</b> <b>is</b> to be replaced or deleted, the entire block can be marked as invalid, {{and there is no}} need to read parts of it to garbage collect and rewrite into another block. It will need only to be erased, which is much easier and faster than the read-erase-modify-write process needed for randomly written data going through garbage collection.|$|E
5|$|Agnes D'Mello, the NDC's head {{of human}} resources, {{suggests}} to Vidya {{that her husband}} resembled former employee Milan Damji (Indraneil Sengupta), whose <b>file</b> <b>is</b> probably kept in the old NDC office. Before Agnes can provide any further help she is killed by Bob Biswas (Saswata Chatterjee), an assassin working undercover as a life insurance agent. Vidya and Rana break into the NDC office and find Damji's file, barely escaping an encounter with Bob, who is searching for the same information. Meanwhile, the attempts to obtain Damji's records have {{attracted the attention of}} two Intelligence Bureau (IB) officials in Delhi—the chief Bhaskaran K. (Dhritiman Chatterjee) and his deputy Khan (Nawazuddin Siddiqui). Khan arrives in Kolkata and reveals that Damji was a rogue IB agent responsible for the poison-gas attack. In spite of Khan's warnings, Vidya continues her search, fearing that Arnab's resemblance to Damji may have led him into trouble.|$|E
5|$|Hermes {{agrees to}} help Bender {{in his quest}} to {{discover}} the identity of Inspector No. 5, which is locked in the Central Bureaucracy. While at the Central Bureaucracy, Hermes logs into the computer system with his ID to look up Inspector No. 5's records. However, he and Bender find that the electronic record on Inspector No. 5 has been deleted and that the physical <b>file</b> <b>is</b> also missing. Bender calls Mom's Friendly Robot Company, who created him, and tells her he is defective. Mom attempts to have Bender destroyed {{to cover up the}} existence of a defective robot. The two flee from Mom's Killbots by train and arrive in Tijuana—where Bender was manufactured.|$|E

50|$|In GFS, most <b>files</b> <b>are</b> {{modified}} by appending new data and not overwriting existing data. Once written, the <b>files</b> <b>are</b> usually only read sequentially rather than randomly, {{and that makes}} this DFS the most suitable for scenarios in which many large <b>files</b> <b>are</b> created once but read many times.|$|R
50|$|Typically, {{computer}} <b>files</b> <b>are</b> organised in a file system, {{which keeps}} track of where the <b>files</b> <b>are,</b> and enables people to access them.|$|R
5|$|PHP is a {{general-purpose}} {{scripting language}} that is especially suited to server-side web development, in which case PHP generally runs on a web server. Any PHP code in a requested <b>file</b> <b>is</b> executed by the PHP runtime, usually to create dynamic web page content or dynamic images used on websites or elsewhere. It {{can also be used}} for command-line scripting and client-side graphical user interface (GUI) applications. PHP can be deployed on most web servers, many operating systems and platforms, and can be used with many relational database management systems (RDBMS). Most web hosting providers support PHP for use by their clients. It is available free of charge, and the PHP Group provides the complete source code for users to build, customize and extend for their own use.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of the TRIM command resolves this problem for operating systems that support it like Windows 7, Mac OS (latest releases of Snow Leopard, Lion, and Mountain Lion, patched in some cases), FreeBSD since version 8.1, and Linux since version 2.6.33 of the Linux kernel mainline. When a <b>file</b> <b>is</b> permanently deleted or the drive is formatted, the OS sends the TRIM command along with the LBAs that no longer contain valid data. This informs the SSD that the LBAs in use can be erased and reused. This reduces the LBAs needing to be moved during garbage collection. The result is the SSD will have more free space enabling lower write amplification and higher performance.|$|E
25|$|Occuping {{the centre}} is {{relatively}} less important in xiangqi, but controlling and attacking the middle <b>file</b> <b>is</b> {{still one of}} the vital themes. Since the middle <b>file</b> <b>is</b> often well defended, players would then seek to mount an offence on either of the flanks on the enemy side, especially when the defence of one flank is neglected.|$|E
50|$|LRS <b>files</b> <b>are</b> XML <b>files</b> {{that can}} <b>be</b> edited {{and follow the}} BBeB Xylog XML specification. They {{represent}} the source code of each BBeB eBook. LRF (unencrypted) and LRX (encrypted for DRM purposes) <b>files</b> <b>are</b> compiled/compressed versions of LRS <b>files</b> that <b>are</b> actually used by eBook readers.|$|R
50|$|A single set of <b>files</b> <b>is</b> {{used for}} storing all tables. A {{separate}} set of <b>files</b> <b>is</b> {{used for all}} temporary data. The maximum size of a <b>file</b> set <b>is</b> 32 terabytes, for 4G × 8K pages.|$|R
50|$|Sequential <b>files</b> <b>are</b> {{somewhat}} more efficient {{in terms of}} space than line <b>files</b> and can <b>be</b> more efficient in terms of CPU time too when compared with large disorganized line files. But {{the main reason for}} the existence of SEQ <b>files</b> <b>is</b> that they supported long lines (up to 32767 characters) before line files did. Sequential <b>files</b> <b>were</b> less common once line files could support long lines. Sequential <b>files</b> <b>are</b> also used to force new lines to be appended {{to the end of the}} file without the need to give the line number range (LAST+1).|$|R
25|$|Compound file on close: Distribute file to all {{controllers}} when <b>file</b> <b>is</b> closed.|$|E
25|$|Mirror file on close: Distribute file to server {{only when}} <b>file</b> <b>is</b> closed.|$|E
25|$|A PDF <b>file</b> <b>is</b> a 7-bit ASCII file, {{except for}} certain {{elements}} {{that may have}} binary content.|$|E
5000|$|Access {{transparency}} is {{that clients}} <b>are</b> unaware that <b>files</b> <b>are</b> distributed and can access {{them in the}} same way as local <b>files</b> <b>are</b> accessed.|$|R
50|$|The {{download}} of {{the relevant}} <b>files</b> <b>was</b> possible across all protocols and in parallel. The individual <b>file</b> fragments <b>were</b> compiled using a hash sum and an overlapping heuristic, thus ensuring that the downloaded <b>file</b> <b>was</b> complete and correct.|$|R
5000|$|Storage Method: Describes {{the form}} in which <b>files</b> <b>are</b> stored in the repository. A {{snapshot}} indicates that a committed <b>file(s)</b> <b>is</b> stored in its entirety—usually compressed. A changeset, in this context, indicates that a committed <b>file(s)</b> <b>is</b> stored {{in the form of}} a difference between either the previous version or the next.|$|R
25|$|Wubi adds {{an entry}} to the Windows boot menu which allows the user to run Linux. Ubuntu is {{installed}} within a file in the Windows file system (c:\ubuntu\disks\root.disk), {{as opposed to being}} installed within its own partition. This <b>file</b> <b>is</b> seen by Linux as a real hard disk. Wubi also creates a swap file in the Windows file system (c:\ubuntu\disks\swap.disk), in addition to the memory of the host machine. This <b>file</b> <b>is</b> seen by Ubuntu as additional RAM.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the aforementioned three components, the black box audit log <b>file</b> <b>is</b> also {{an important part of}} continuous auditing. This file can be viewed {{as an extension of the}} existing practice of documenting audit activities in manual or automated work papers. A black box log <b>file</b> <b>is</b> a read-only, third-party controlled record of the actions of auditors. The objective of black box logging is to protect a continuous auditing system against auditor and management manipulations.|$|E
25|$|A <b>file</b> <b>is</b> a {{means of}} {{communicating}} between a particular program and a book that has been opened via some channel.|$|E
5000|$|Public <b>files</b> <b>are</b> <b>files</b> {{whose names}} begin, {{but do not}} end, with an {{asterisk}} (e.g., *LIBRARY, *USERDIRECTORY). Public files, often called star <b>files,</b> <b>are</b> publicly available <b>files</b> that contain programs and data that are widely available to all users. For example, *LIBRARY is a library of commonly used system subroutines. In {{the earliest days of}} MTS public <b>files</b> <b>were</b> the only <b>files</b> that could <b>be</b> shared and then only as read-only files. Later, public <b>files</b> could <b>be</b> permitted and shared in the same fashion as any other files.|$|R
5000|$|The {{format for}} {{off-line}} media <b>files</b> <b>is</b> specified in Part 10 of the DICOM Standard. Such <b>files</b> <b>are</b> {{sometimes referred to}} as [...] "Part 10 files".|$|R
40|$|These <b>files</b> <b>were</b> {{produced}} {{for the series}} Smuain na Maidne (Thought of the day) for the Radio nan Gaidheal (BBC) in 2005. The speaker is Muriel Fisher. The <b>file</b> <b>was</b> originally transcribed by Christine Primrose, and glossed and translated by the Arizona Scottish Gaelic Syntax Project, April 2008. The <b>files</b> <b>are</b> used {{with the permission of}} Muriel Fisher...|$|R
25|$|A key path is a {{specific}} file, registry key, or ODBC data source that the package author specifies as critical for a given component. Because a <b>file</b> <b>is</b> {{the most common type}} of key path, the term key <b>file</b> <b>is</b> commonly used. A component can contain at most one key path; if a component has no explicit key path, the component's destination folder is taken to be the key path. When an MSI-based program is launched, Windows Installer checks the existence of key paths. If there is a mismatch between the current system state and the value specified in the MSI package (e.g., a key <b>file</b> <b>is</b> missing), the related feature is re-installed. This process is known as self-healing or self-repair. No two components should use the same key path.|$|E
25|$|An {{additional}} important <b>file</b> <b>is</b> boot.ini, {{which contains}} boot configuration (if missing, NTLDR will default to \Windows {{on the first}} partition of the first hard drive).|$|E
25|$|A WMA <b>file</b> <b>is</b> in most {{circumstances}} {{contained in}} the Advanced Systems Format (ASF), a proprietary Microsoft container format for digital audio or digital video. The ASF container format specifies how metadata about the <b>file</b> <b>is</b> to be encoded, similar to the ID3 tags used by MP3 files. Metadata may include song name, track number, artist name, and also audio normalization values. This container can optionally support digital rights management (DRM) {{using a combination of}} elliptic curve cryptography key exchange, DES block cipher, a custom block cipher, RC4 stream cipher and the SHA-1 hashing function. See Windows Media DRM for further information.|$|E
50|$|Non-persisted <b>files</b> <b>are</b> not {{associated}} with a file on a disk. When the last process has finished working with the <b>file,</b> the data <b>is</b> lost. These <b>files</b> <b>are</b> suitable for creating shared memory for inter-process communications (IPC).|$|R
