Along with usual $ 2 k_F$ <b>in-plane</b> <b>oscillations</b> the RKKY interaction has the sign-reversal character in a direction perpendicular to layers, thus favoring the antiferromagnetic type of layers' stacking.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{scanning}} acoustic force microscope (SAFM) {{for the study}} of surface acoustic wave (SAW) phenomena on the submicron lateral scale. Until now, SAWs with <b>in-plane</b> <b>oscillation</b> components could only be studied effectively via nonvanishing out-of-plane oscillation contributions. By operating the microscope in lateral force mode, where both bending and torsion of the cantilever are detected, additional amplitude-dependent signals are found, which are due to the interaction with purely in-plane polarized surface oscillations. To demonstrate the capabilities of this type of SAFM, Love waves were studied on the surface of layers deposited on ST-cut quartz with SAW propagation perpendicular to the crystal X-axis.

40|$|A two-degree-of-freedom {{non-linear}} {{elastic model}} {{is considered to}} analyze the effects of non-linearities on the free motion of a suspended cable. The discretized model is obtained by referring to simplified kinematics of the cable; the equations of motion which show quadratic and cubic non-linearities are solved through the multiple time scale perturbation technique. The monofrequent oscillations of the system are studied in order to analyze the modifications of frequency and motion amplitude of the modal oscillations due to geometric non-linearities {{in the absence of}} internal resonance. The possibility that effects arise due to non-linear coupling is examined. A numerical analysis is made for the first symmetric mode for different amplitudes of motion by parametrically varying the geometric and mechanical properties of the cable. The correction of frequency for the <b>in-plane</b> <b>oscillation</b> varies appreciably with the cable properties due to prevalence of either the quadratic or cubic term.

40|$|The exact {{solution}} of radiation {{problem of a}} spin wave travelling in an antiferromagnetic (AFM) plate was found. The spin wave with <b>in-plane</b> <b>oscillations</b> of antiferromagnetism vector was considered. In this case the magnetization vector is oscillating being perpendicular to the AFM plate and depends on time and plane coordinates as travelling wave does. This model allows to obtain exact analytical expression for Hertzian vector and, consequently, the retarded potentials and field strengths as well. It is shown that expressions obtained describe Cherenkov radiation caused by the travelling wave. The radiated electromagnetic wave is the TEM type if a phase velocity exceeds the speed of light.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to report some new {{experimental}} and theoretical results about the analysis of <b>in-plane</b> lattice spacing <b>oscillations</b> during two-dimensional (2 D) homo and hetero epitaxial growth. The physical origin of these oscillations comes from the finite size of the strained islands. The 2 D islands may thus relax by their edges, leading to <b>in-plane</b> lattice spacing <b>oscillations</b> during the birth and spread of these islands. On the one hand, we formulate the problem of elastic relaxation of a coherent 2 D epitaxial deposits by using the concept of point forces and demonstrate that the mean deformation in the islands exhibits an oscillatory behaviour. On the other hand, we calculate the intensity diffracted by such coherently deposited 2 D islands by using a mean model of a pile-up of weakly deformed layers. The amplitude of <b>in-plane</b> lattice spacing <b>oscillations</b> is found to depend linearly on the misfit and roughly linearly on the nucleation density. We show that the nucleation density may be approximated from the full-width at half maximum of the diffracted rods at half coverages. The predicted dependence of the <b>in-plane</b> lattice spacing <b>oscillations</b> amplitude with the nucleation density is thus experimentally verified on V/Fe(001), Mn/Fe(001), Ni/Fe(001), Co/Cu(001) and V/V(001).

40|$|We {{investigate}} the <b>in-plane</b> <b>oscillations</b> of the relaxed shape graphene due to externally applied tensile edge stress along both the armchair and zigzag directions. We {{show that the}} total elastic energy density is enhanced with temperature for the case of applied tensile edge stress along the zigzag direction. Thermo-electromechanical effects are treated via pseudomorphic vector potentials to analyze the influence of these coupled effects on the bandstructures of bilayer graphene quantum dots (QDs). We report that the level crossing between ground and first excited states in the localized edge states can be achieved with the accessible values of temperature. In particular, the level crossing point extends to higher temperatures with decreasing values of externally applied tensile edge stress along the armchair direction. This kind of level crossings is absent in the states formed {{at the center of}} the graphene sheet due to the presence of three fold symmetry. Comment: 7 pages and 7 figures in press, Phys.

40|$|The {{in-plane}} vibration of a slider-mass {{which is}} driven around {{the surface of}} a flexible disc, and the transverse vibration of the disc, are investigated. The disc is taken to be an elastic annular plate and the slider has flexibility and damping in the circumferential (in-plane) and transverse directions. The static friction coefficient is assumed to be higher than the dynamic friction. As a result of the friction force acting between the disc and the slider system, the slider will oscillate in the stick-slip mode in the plane of the disc. The transverse vibration induced by the slider will change the normal force on the disc, which in turn will change the <b>in-plane</b> <b>oscillation</b> of the slider. A numerical method is used to solve the two coupled equations of the motion. Results indicate that normal pressure and rotating speed can drive the system into instability. The rigidity and damping of the disc and transverse stiffness and damping of the slider tend to suppress the vibrations. The in-plane stiffness and damping of the slider do not always have a stabilizing effect. The motivation of this work is the understanding of instability and squeal in physical systems such as car brake discs where there are vibrations induced by non-smooth dry-friction force...|$|E
40|$|A {{systematic}} {{study of}} turbulent thermal convection {{is carried out}} in horizontal cylindrical cells of different lengths filled with water. The aim of the thesis work is to study the geometry effect on the fluid dynamics of the large-scale circulation (LSC) and the scaling laws in turbulent Rayleigh-Bénard convection. The results obtained in the horizontal cylinders are compared with those obtained in the upright cylinders. The large-scale flow shows interesting new dynamics in the horizontal cylindrical cells. Four different flow modes {{are found in the}} cells with varying aspect ratio Γ: two-dimensional rotation (2 DR), small-Γ diagonal switching (SDS), large-Γ diagonal switching (LDS) and periodic reversals (PR). In the 2 DR phase (Γ ≤ 0. 16), the flow is quasi-two-dimensional and is confined in the circular plane of the horizontal cylinder. In this phase, a well-defined <b>in-plane</b> <b>oscillation</b> of LSC is observed, resulting from the periodical eruption of thermal plumes from the top and bottom thermal boundary layers. In the SDS phase (0. 16 < Γ < 0. 82), the rotation plane of LSC switches periodically between the two diagonals of the cell, spanning across the curved sidewalls. The switching period is found to be equal to the LSC turnover time. In the LDS phase (0. 82 ≤ Γ ≤ 1. 69), the periodic switching of the LSC orientation still remains, but the switching is now spanning across the flat end walls of the cell. The switching period has a large jump at the transition aspect ratio Γc = 0. 82 and then exponentially decays with increasing Γ. For even larger aspect ratios (1. 30 ≤ Γ ≤ 1. 69), the bulk fluid as a whole rotates around the central axis of the horizontal cylinder with periodic reversals. The reversal period is found to change linearly with the length of the cell. The scaling laws of turbulent convection are also investigated in the horizontal cylinders. The scaling behavior of the measured Nusselt number (total heat flux) Nu(Ra) and the Reynolds number Re(Ra) associated with the velocity of LSC, remains the same as that in the upright cylinders. These results suggest that the thermal boundary layer dynamics are insensitive to the geometry change and that the role of the buoyancy forces, which drive LSC, does not change with the cell geometry either. The scaling exponent for the rms value of local temperature fluctuations, however, shows strong dependence on the aspect ratio Γ of the convection cell, indicating that small-scale fluctuations depend more sensitively on the detailed structures of LSC and are sensitive to the change of cell geometry...|$|E
40|$|Spin torque {{oscillators}} (STO) {{were developed}} in 2003 and since then great {{progress has been made}} in understanding their underlying physics, frequency of operation, frequency tuning range, and functionality. These nanoscale oscillators with their octave spanning frequency tuning range have been touted for many applications including neuromorphic computing, magnetic field sensing, and microwave signal detection. Since their inception, output power of spin torque oscillators has been improved by five orders of magnitude. In spite of all these developments, the adoption of spin torque oscillators as extremely tunable signal source has been hindered due to their large linewidth and frequency stability issues. Solutions such as using spin torque oscillators in a PLL and injection locking of spin torque oscillators has been demonstrated. However, these solutions need an external signal reference for their implementation. Recently, self-locking of spin torque oscillators to their amplified, delayed output signal has been proposed and initial experiments have demonstrated an encouraging progress in the improvement of the linewidth. Further improving on this concept of self-locking, we propose a system that uses spin torque oscillators in a delay line oscillator with a high quality factor micro-electro-mechanical (MEMS) resonator as the delay element. This spin torque oscillator coupled with a MEMS resonator in a feedback system is presented in this thesis as a magneto-acoustic oscillator. This dissertation presents all the components needed for realizing the magneto-acoustic oscillator as well as addresses the issues and challenges in its implementation. To maintain the tuning capability of magneto-acoustic oscillator we use high-overtone bulk acoustic resonators (HBARs) as the MEMS resonator, as they have numerous resonances spread over large range of frequency. We fabricated and characterized one port, high-overtone bulk acoustic resonators to be used as stress transducers for strain feedback-based magneto-acoustic oscillator. We also developed an analytical model to calculate the stress/strain generated by the HBARs for a given drive voltage. We further performed low temperature characterization of the HBAR resonators, fabricated on different substrate materials, in order to better understand the dominant loss mechanism that limits its performance as a strain generator. Two port, laterally coupled high-overtone bulk acoustic resonators were fabricated and characterized with measurements indicating quality factors upwards of 20, 000 in the 2 to 8 GHz regime. Two port HBARs were demonstrated as high quality factor, narrow bandwidth filters to be used for current feedback-based magneto-acoustic oscillators that are operational over a large frequency range with nominal transmission loss of - 25 dB. We study using strain as the feedback path for implementing a magneto-acoustic oscillator in a macrospin model of a spin torque oscillator. This model incorporates the effect of a uniaxial external AC strain on the spin torque oscillator by considering, the effective field generated by due to the magnetoelastic property of the free layer magnet. We also calculate the threshold amplitude of strain needed to lock the spin torque oscillator and further calculate the gain required for the HBAR to feedback that strain when implemented as a magneto-acoustic oscillator. Comparing the gain needed for locking in current feedback-based magneto-acoustic oscillator and strain feedback-based spin torque oscillator we find that current feedback based magneto-acoustic oscillator performance is superior. CoFeGe/CoFe and Terfenol-D as the free layer based spin valves fabricated at HGST with 6 % MR and SHE-MTJs with 30 % TMR were characterized as spin torque oscillators for implementing the current feedback-based magneto-acoustic oscillators. We demonstrated an open loop current feedback-based magneto-acoustic oscillator, which reduced the linewidth of the spin valve oscillators from 35. 4 MHz to 175 kHz with ∆f_o/f_o ratio as high as 23, 657 was measured for <b>in-plane</b> <b>oscillation</b> mode at 4. 14 GHz. This is the highest measured ∆f_o/f_o ratio for any spin valve oscillator in an open loop configuration. ∆f_o/f_o ratio for the SHE-MTJ oscillator was enhanced by 1070 fold resulted in reducing the linewidth of the oscillator from 300 MHz to 280 kHz. This is the smallest reported linewidth for SHE-MTJs. Upon implementing a closed loop current feedback-based magneto-acoustic oscillator, we observed HBAR oscillations. This was due to the poor isolation from wide bandwidth circulators and because of the high gain needed for locking owing to the low output power of the spin torque oscillators. We propose using a microwave feedback in magneto-acoustic oscillator that eliminates the implementation problems of closed loop current feedback-based magneto-acoustic oscillator by changing the domain of feedback signal from electrical to microwave. We simulated different closed loop magneto-acoustic oscillators using strain, current, and microwave feedback in HSPICE to compare their power efficiencies. Simulation results show that the microwave feedback-based magneto-acoustic oscillator is most promising alternative due to the low gain required in its implementation. 2019 - 02 - 0...|$|E
40|$|An {{asymptotic}} {{scheme is}} generated that captures {{the motion of}} waves within discrete, semi-discrete and continuous periodic media by creating continuum homogenised equations. Conventional homogenisation theory is a well-known classical method valid when the wavelength of any disturbance is long relative to the microstructure. Unfortunately many {{of the features of}} interest in real applications involve wave oscillations that are of high frequency and that have wavelength of the same, or similar, order to the microstructure; this requires a new version of homogenisation theory: High frequency homogenisation. This has already been introduced for periodic microstructured continua and extended to discrete systems. Herein we extend high frequency homogenisation further, to deal with localised defect states and non-orthogonal geometries for both discrete and continuous media.

40|$|This {{article has}} been {{accepted}} for publication in Journal of Fluid Mechan-ics, published by Cambridge University Press. The changes of a turbulent channel flow subjected to sinusoidal oscillations of wall flush-mounted rigid discs are studied by means of direct numerical simulations. The Reynolds number is Rτ= 180, based on the friction velocity of the stationary-wall case and the half channel height. The primary effect of the wall forcing is the sustained reduction of wall-shear stress, which reaches a maximum of 20 %. A parametric study on the disc diameter, maximum tip velocity, and oscillation period is presented, with the aim to identify the optimal parameters which guarantee maximum drag reduction and maximum net energy saving, the latter com-puted by {{taking into account the}} power spent to actuate the discs.

The Rosenblat viscous pump flow, namely the laminar flow induced by sinusoidal <b>in-plane</b> <b>oscillations</b> of an infinite disc beneath a quiescent fluid, is used to predict accurately the power spent for disc motion in the fully-developed turbulent channel flow case and to estimate localized and transient regions over the disc surface subjected to the turbulen...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{computational}} {{analysis is}} performed of the unsteady aerodynamics {{associated with the}} blade sections of helicopter rotors in forward flight. The unsteady flow is studied through solutions of the two-dimensional Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes equations together with a strongly coupled two-equation model of turbulence. Two motions are studied. The first motion is that of an aerofoil subjected to harmonic <b>in-plane</b> <b>oscillations.</b> The influence of advance ratio and reduced frequency is investigated. It is shown that, {{in the absence of}} shock waves, the flow is periodic with a reduced frequency equal to that of the forcing motion. However, the flow development lags behind the forcing motion. Furthermore, for constant reduced frequency the phase lag is independent of advance ratio. In addition to harmonic motion, the aerodynamic response to a step change in Mach number is investigated. Using an assumed form of the response of lift coefficient to a step change in Mach number, a lift transfer operator for step changes in Mach number is obtained in the Laplace domain. An analytical expression for the response to harmonic Mach number oscillations is then obtained from the transfer operator. The resulting formulation for the aerodynamic response confirms that the lag between the forcing motion and the aerodynamic response is independent of advance ratio...|$|R

40|$|Microscopic {{structure}} and dynamics {{of water and}} lipids in a fully hydrated dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine phospholipid lipid bilayer membrane in the liquid-crystalline phase have been analyzed with all-atom molecular dynamics simulations based on the recently parameterized CHARMM 36 force field. The diffusive dynamics of the membrane lipids and of its hydration water, their reorientational motions {{as well as their}} corresponding spectral densities, related to the absorption of radiation, have been considered for the first time using the present force field. In addition, structural properties such as density and pressure profiles, a deuterium-order parameter, surface tension, and the extent of water penetration in the membrane have been analyzed. Molecular self-diffusion, reorientational motions, and spectral densities of atomic species reveal a variety of time scales playing a role in membrane dynamics. The mechanisms of lipid motion strongly depend on the time scale considered, from fast ballistic translation at the scale of picoseconds (effective diffusion coefficients of the order of 10 - 5 cm 2 /s) to diffusive flow of a few lipids forming nanodomains at the scale of hundreds of nanoseconds (diffusion coefficients of the order of 10 - 8 cm 2 /s). In the intermediate regime of sub-diffusion, collisions with nearest neighbors prevent the lipids to achieve full diffusion. Lipid reorientations along selected directions agree well with reported nuclear magnetic resonance data and indicate two different time scales, one about 1 ns and a second one in the range of 2 – 8 ns. We associated the two time scales of reorientational motions with angular distributions of selected vectors. Calculated spectral densities corresponding to lipid and water reveal an overall good qualitative agreement with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy experiments. Our simulations indicate a blue-shift of the low frequency spectral bands of hydration water {{as a result of its}} interaction with lipids.

40|$|In {{the finite}} motions of a {{suspended}} elastic cable the <b>in-plane</b> and out-of-plane <b>oscillations</b> are coupled, {{which is in}} contrast with what is predicted by the theory of small oscillations. To study the phenomenon of nonlinear coupling, a simple but meaningful two degree-of-freedom model is referred here, one parameter being {{used to describe the}} in-plane motion and the other the out-of-plane motion. The solution of the dynamic equilibrium equations is accomplished by an order-three perturbational expansion, which furnishes the time solution of the two displacement parameters. The modification of the free oscillations due to the exchange of energy between the two modes in absence of internal resonance is studied for different initial conditions and the effect of modal coupling is evidenced. © 1986 Pitagora Editrice Bologna...|$|R
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the field-angle variation of the specific heat C(H, phi, theta) of the heavy-fermion superconductor UPt 3 at low temperatures T down to 50 mK, where phi and theta denote the azimuthal and polar angles of the magnetic field H, respectively. For T = 88 mK, C(H, theta= 90) increases proportionally to H^{ 1 / 2 } up to nearly the upper critical field Hc 2, indicating the presence of line nodes. By contrast, C(H, theta= 0) deviates upward from the H^{ 1 / 2 } dependence for (H/Hc 2) ^{ 1 / 2 } > 0. 5. This behavior {{can be related to}} the suppression of Hc 2 along the c direction, whose origin has not been resolved yet. Our data show that the unusual Hc 2 limit becomes marked only when theta is smaller than 30. In order to explore the possible vertical line nodes in the gap structure, we measured the phi dependence of C in wide T and H ranges. However, we did not observe any <b>in-plane</b> angular <b>oscillation</b> of C within the accuracy of dC/C~ 0. 5 %. This result implies that field-induced excitations of the heavy quasiparticles occur isotropically with respect to phi, which is apparently contrary to the recent finding of a twofold thermal-conductivity oscillation.

40|$|The coupled {{non-linear}} equations {{of motion}} of a sagged cable in its first symmetric mode of <b>in-plane</b> and out-of-plane <b>oscillations</b> are solved by the method of multiple scales for its forced vibration response. The cases of {{both internal and external}} resonances are considered. A uniform lateral load is assumed to act along with an in-plane harmonic component, similar to a situation under vortex-induced oscillation. The quadratic nonlinearity terms in the {{equations of motion}} are shown to affect the cable behaviour significantly when the in-plane frequency is about twice the out-of-plane frequency of oscillation. A stability analysis is performed on the steady state solutions. The effect of cable sag on these solutionns and their stability is studied indirectly through the internal resonance parameter. The influence of the lateral load component, with and without internal resonance, on the stability regions is discussed...|$|R
