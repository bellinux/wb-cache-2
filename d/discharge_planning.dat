In {{order to improve}} continuity of care, transmission of pharmacotherapeutic information would be helpful for community pharmacists. Objectives: To evaluate the interest of a "pharmacy discharge plan" to community pharmacists. Design: Prospective pilot study. Upon hospital discharge, patients with treatment modifications received a <b>discharge</b> <b>plan,</b> written by the clinical pharmacist and addressed to their community pharmacists. Two weeks later, the investigator called them to evaluate this document. Setting: Two teaching hospitals in Belgium. Main Outcome Measures: The <b>Discharge</b> <b>Plan</b> was evaluated with regard to: usefulness for continuity of care; quality of practical information given; feasibility {{in terms of time}} for hospital pharmacists; modalities of transmission; suggestions for improvement. Results: 18 patients were included in the study: 12 pharmacists received the <b>discharge</b> <b>plan.</b> 10 pharmacists thought the document facilitated continuity of patient care; 5 used it to counsel their patients; 10 pharmacists agreed with the modalities of transmission. The mean time needed to fill the document was 25 minutes. Suggestions for improvements were: to add more practical information (including on unusual drugs); to insist on treatment changes during hospitalisation. Conclusions: This study contributed {{to the creation of the}} first pharmacy <b>discharge</b> <b>plan</b> in Belgium.

Patients' homes should also be visited and examined before they are discharged from the hospital to determine any immediate challenges and corresponding goals, adaptations and assistive devices that need to be implemented.

40|$|<b>Discharge</b> <b>planning</b> is an {{interdisciplinary}} approach to provide continuity of care; it {{is a process}} that includes identification, assessment, goal setting, planning, implementation, coordination, and evaluation. <b>Discharge</b> <b>planning</b> has been viewed as a major way to enhance a smooth transition for patients from the hospital to home or other chronic care units and as a solution to solve problems associated with postdischarge care. The promotion of <b>discharge</b> <b>planning</b> began in the United States in the 1960 s.

Following the healthcare reforms in 1995, <b>discharge</b> <b>planning</b> has since been strongly promoted.
