40|$|Abstract. Software programmers want {{to manage}} pure software, not hardware-software entanglements. Unfortunately, {{traditional}} development methodologies cannot clearly separate {{hardware and software}} in embedded system development process. We propose a Hardware/software INterface GEnerator; we call it HINGE. After receiving <b>device</b> specifications including <b>device</b> usage rules for each <b>device,</b> HINGE automatically generates <b>device</b> API, <b>device</b> driver, and <b>device</b> controller for each <b>device.</b> In addition, HINGE equips <b>device</b> APIs to check the <b>device</b> usage rules at run-time. Consequently, HINGE gives support to not only fast prototyping but also <b>device</b> usage rule-debugging in embedded software. ...|$|R

5|$|Critics {{and analysts}} deemed Windows RT to be commercially unsuccessful, citing these limitations, its unclear, uncompetitive {{position}} of sitting as an underpowered system between Windows Phone and Windows 8, {{and the introduction}} of Windows 8 <b>devices</b> with battery life and functionality that met or exceeded that of Windows RT <b>devices.</b> Improvements to Intel's mobile processors, along with a decision by Microsoft to remove OEM license fees for Windows on <b>devices</b> with screens smaller than 9 inches, spurred a market for low-end Wintel tablets running the full Windows 8 platform. These <b>devices</b> largely cannibalized Windows RT; vendors began phasing out their Windows RT <b>devices</b> due to poor sales, and {{less than a year after}} its release, Microsoft suffered a US$900 million loss that was largely blamed on poor sales of the ARM-based Surface tablet and unsold stock.|$|E
30|$|The <b>device</b> {{ontology}} describes {{capabilities of}} a <b>device,</b> and extracts {{features of a}} <b>device</b> in a unified format.
