5|$|Van der Weyden was preoccupied by {{commissioned}} portraiture {{towards the}} end of his life and was highly regarded by later generations of painters for his penetrating evocations of character. In this work, the woman's humility and reserved demeanour are conveyed through her fragile physique, lowered eyes and tightly grasped fingers. She is slender and depicted according to the Gothic ideal of elongated features, indicated by her narrow shoulders, tightly pinned hair, high forehead and the elaborate <b>frame</b> <b>set</b> by the headdress. It is the only known portrait of a woman accepted as an autograph work by van der Weyden, yet the sitter's name is not recorded and he did not title the work.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most famous}} {{preserved}} {{representation of the}} menorah of the Temple was depicted in a frieze on the Arch of Titus, commemorating his triumphal parade in Rome following the destruction of Jerusalem in the year 70 CE. In that frieze, the menorah is shown resting upon a double octagonal base, built all around {{in the form of}} a step. The lower base was identical in design to the upper base, only larger in circumference. Each facet of the octagonal base was made with two vertical stiles and two horizontal rails, a top rail and a bottom rail, resembling a protruding <b>frame</b> <b>set</b> against a sunken panel. These panels have some relief design set or sculpted within them. The panels are depicting the Ziz and the Leviathan from Jewish mythology.|$|E
2500|$|In 1598 John Stow had {{commented that}} [...] "if carts do run against it through negligence, the wheels be broken, {{and the stone}} itself unshaken", and by 1742 it was {{considered}} an obstruction to traffic. The remaining part of the Stone was then moved, with its protective cupola, from {{the south side of}} the street to the north side, where it was first set beside the door of St Swithin's Church, which had been rebuilt by Christopher Wren after its destruction in the Great Fire. It was moved again in 1798 to the east end of the church's south wall, and finally in the 1820s set in an alcove in the centre of the wall within a solidly built stone <b>frame</b> <b>set</b> on a plinth, with a circular aperture through which the Stone itself could be seen. In 1869 the London and Middlesex Archaeological Society arranged for the installation of a protective iron grille and an explanatory inscription in Latin and English on the church wall above it.|$|E

60|$|Indeed if {{they had}} not been blessed in their weather, one blue day being bowled up after another, smooth, round, and flawless. Mrs. Ambrose would have found it very dull. As it was, she had her {{embroidery}} <b>frame</b> <b>set</b> up on deck, with a little table by her side on which lay open a black volume of philosophy. She chose a thread from the vari-coloured tangle that lay in her lap, and sewed red into the bark of a tree, or yellow into the river torrent. She was working at a great design of a tropical river running through a tropical forest, where spotted deer would eventually browse upon masses of fruit, bananas, oranges, and giant pomegranates, while a troop of naked natives whirled darts into the air. Between the stitches she looked to one side and read a sentence about the Reality of Matter, or the Nature of Good. Round her men in blue jerseys knelt and scrubbed the boards, or leant over the rails and whistled, and not far off Mr. Pepper sat cutting up roots with a penknife. The rest were occupied {{in other parts of the}} ship: Ridley at his Greek--he had never found quarters more to his liking; Willoughby at his documents, for he used a voyage to work of arrears of business; and Rachel--Helen, between her sentences of philosophy, wondered sometimes what Rachel did do with herself? She meant vaguely to go and see. They had scarcely spoken two words to each other since that first evening; they were polite when they met, but there had been no confidence of any kind. Rachel seemed to get on very well with her father--much better, Helen thought, than she ought to--and was as ready to let Helen alone as Helen was to let her alone.|$|E
60|$|Now that Prescott Gate, {{by which}} so many {{thousands}} of Americans have entered Quebec since Arnold's excursionists failed to do so, is demolished, {{there is nothing left}} so picturesque and characteristic as Hope Gate, and I doubt if anywhere in Europe there is a more mediæval-looking bit of military architecture. The heavy stone gateway is black with age, and the gate, which has probably never been closed in our century, is of massive <b>frame</b> <b>set</b> thick with mighty bolts and spikes. The wall here sweeps along the brow of the crag on which the city is built, and a steep street drops down, by stone-parapeted curves and angles, from the Upper to the Lower Town, where, in 1775, nothing but a narrow lane bordered the St. Lawrence. A considerable breadth of land has since been won from the river, and several streets and many piers now stretch between this alley and the water; but the old Sault au Matelot still crouches and creeps along under the shelter of the city wall and the overhanging rock, which is thickly bearded with weeds and grass, and trickles with abundant moisture. It must be an ice-pit in winter, and I should think it the last spot on the continent for the summer to find; but when the summer has at last found it, the old Sault au Matelot puts on a vagabond air of Southern leisure and abandon, not to be matched anywhere out of Italy. Looking from that jutting rock near Hope Gate, behind which the defeated Americans took refuge from the fire of their enemies, the vista is almost unique for a certain scenic squalor and gypsy luxury of color: sag-roofed barns and stables, and weak-backed, sunken-chested workshops of every sort lounge along in tumble-down succession, and lean up against the cliff in every imaginable posture of worthlessness and decrepitude; light wooden galleries cross to them from the second stories of the houses which back upon the alley; and over these galleries flutters, from a labyrinth of clothes-lines, a variety of bright-colored garments of all ages, sexes, and conditions; while the footway underneath abounds in gossiping women, smoking men, idle poultry, cats, children, and large, indolent Newfoundland dogs.|$|E

40|$|If a 'general {{theory of}} planning' is impossible, a {{contingent}} framework is proposed to integrate prevailing and emergent planning paradigms which present four {{different views of}} planning: deliberative rationality, communicative practice, coordinative planning, and <b>frame</b> <b>setting.</b> These {{are not mutually exclusive}} but are complementary aspects of a contingent and dynamic planning process. Rationality is invoked in deliberative problem solving by individuals or quasi-individuals, whose interaction takes the form of communicative practice. Coordinative planning represents interaction between organizations, whereas the domain of planning as <b>frame</b> <b>setting</b> is the community. This contingent framework also subsumes descriptive and normative planning models, which are reviewed and illustrated. ...|$|R
