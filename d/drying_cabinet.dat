40|$|In this work, we {{investigated}} {{the impact of}} intensive heat loads on concentrator solar cells assemblies. As test samples, we employed lattice-matched and lattice-mismatched triple-junction solar cells made of GaInP/GaInAs/Ge. The thermal loads were induced by different manners. We used <b>drying</b> <b>cabinets,</b> external power supplies, and {{a combination of both}} to achieve maximum test temperatures of 180 °C. For the performance analysis, we utilized flash light solar simulators and an electroluminescence (EL) imaging tool. Our experiments revealed a significant difference depending on the applied manner of heating. The highest impact was observed for the pure heat treatment in <b>drying</b> <b>cabinets.</b> This was particularly visible in the spatial EL images, but also in the IV curves. In contrast, running the concentrator solar cells as forward-biased diodes using an external current supply of 2000  mA, which corresponds to 2000 suns, did not lead to any significant changes in EL and IV curves. However, deformation of the front metallization was observed. In conclusion, pure heat treatment can be considered as a cost-efficient alternative to pinpoint weak points in solar cell receivers...|$|R
50|$|With the {{steadily}} increasing size of American homes {{over the past}} decades, the laundry room has increased in size and functionality as well. To meet the increasing demand for luxury appliances in the US residential market, a handful of home appliance manufacturers (including Asko and Staber) have begun to supply drying cabinets for the home within the past few years. A typical residential <b>drying</b> <b>cabinet</b> is approximately {{the size of a}} narrow refrigerator, and is used to supplement traditional tumble dryers.|$|E
50|$|The {{inspiration}} for the dish <b>drying</b> <b>cabinet</b> was a Swedish dish draining holder, which was kept on the counter. Gebhard noticed that most families never used the holder, but instead dried the washed dishes by hand and put them directly into a cabinet or cupboard. Gebhard's idea was to put the dish draining holder in the cabinet above the dish washing table (sideboard or counter top), so the dishes could drain dry in place. This way, an entire phase of normal household upkeep could be skipped. According to Gebhard's calculations, the average housewife spent almost 30,000 hours of her life washing and drying dishes.|$|E
