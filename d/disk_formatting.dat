2500|$|<b>Disk</b> <b>formatting</b> {{is usually}} {{done by a}} utility program {{supplied}} by the computer OS manufacturer; generally, it sets up a file storage directory system on the disk, and initializes its sectors and tracks. Areas of the disk unusable for storage due to flaws can be locked (marked as [...] "bad sectors") so that the operating system does not attempt to use them. This was time consuming so many environments had quick formatting which skipped the error checking process. When floppy disks were often used, disks pre-formatted for popular computers were sold. The unformatted capacity of a floppy disk {{does not include the}} sector and track headings of a formatted disk; the difference in storage between them depends on the drive's application. Floppy disk drive and media manufacturers specify the unformatted capacity (for example, 2 MB for a standard 3½-inch HD floppy). It is implied that this should not be exceeded, since doing so will most likely result in performance problems. DMF was introduced permitting 1.68 MB to fit onto an otherwise standard 3½-inch disk; utilities then appeared allowing disks to be formatted as such.|$|E

50|$|The {{time needed}} for the <b>disk</b> <b>formatting</b> is {{shortened}} to about one minute by the background formatting capabilities of the drive.

Packet writing can be used both with once-writeable media and rewriteable media. Several competing and incompatible packet writing <b>disk</b> <b>formats</b> have been developed, including DirectCD and InCD. The standardized formats for packet writing are the Universal <b>Disk</b> <b>Format</b> in the plain, VAT, and spared builds.|$|R
50|$|Some Unix and Unix-like {{operating}} systems have higher-level formatting tools, usually {{for the purpose}} of making <b>disk</b> <b>formatting</b> easier and/or allowing the user to partition the disk with the same tool.

2500|$|No {{standard}} 5 1/4-inch CP/M <b>disk</b> <b>format</b> existed. While the 8-inch single-density floppy <b>disk</b> <b>format</b> (so-called [...] "distribution format") was standardized, various 5 1/4-inch formats {{were used}} {{depending on the}} characteristics of particular systems and to some degree the choices of the designers. CP/M supported options to control the size of reserved and directory areas on the disk, and the mapping between logical disk sectors (as seen by CP/M programs) and physical sectors as allocated on the disk. There were many ways to customize these parameters for every system but once they had been set, no standardized way existed for a system to load parameters from a <b>disk</b> <b>formatted</b> on another system.|$|R

50|$|In {{contrast}} to the label, the volume serial number is generally unique and is not normally changed by the user, and thus acts as a more consistent and reliable identifier of when a volume has been changed (as when a disk is removed and another inserted). <b>Disk</b> <b>formatting</b> changes the serial number, but relabeling does not. The vol command can be used from the command line to display the current label and serial number of a volume.|$|E
50|$|The SAVE command, {{along with}} GET, START, REENTER, EXAMINE and DEPOSIT are basic {{commands}} {{implemented in the}} KMON. Some commands and utilities were later borrowed in DOS-line of operating systems. These commands include DIR, COPY, RENAME, ASSIGN, CLS, DELETE, TYPE, HELP and others. FORMAT command was used for physical <b>disk</b> <b>formatting,</b> {{although it was not}} capable of creating file system, for which purpose INIT command was used (analogue of DOS command FORMAT /Q). Most commands supported use of wildcards in file names.|$|E
