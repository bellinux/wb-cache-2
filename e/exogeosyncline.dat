50|$|An orthogeosyncline is {{a linear}} geosynclinal belt lying between {{continental}} and oceanic terranes, and having internal volcanic belts (eugeosynclinal) and external nonvolcanic belts (miogeosynclinal). Also known as geosynclinal couple or primary geosyncline. A miogeosyncline is the nonvolcanic portion of an orthogeosyncline, located adjacent a craton. A zeugogeosyncline is a geosyncline in a craton or stable area within {{which is also}} an uplifted area, receiving clastic sediments, also known as yoked basin. A parageosyncline is an epeirogenic geosynclinal basin located within a craton area. An <b>exogeosyncline</b> is a parageosyncline that lies along the cratonal border and obtains its clastic sediments from erosion of the adjacent orthogeosynclinal belt outside the craton. Also known as delta geosyncline; foredeep; or transverse basin.|$|E
50|$|The Bengal Foredeep {{is one of}} the world's largest <b>exogeosynclines.</b> It runs {{parallel}} to the hinge zone of the Sub-Himalayan Foredeep. It is about 450 kilometers wide in southern Bangladesh, narrowing towards the northeast. Folded belts of the Burmese Alpide mobile belt mark its eastern boundary. It can be divided into further sub-zones: (1) the Faridpur Trough; (2) the Barisal High; (3) the Hatiya Trough; (4) the Sylhet Trough; and (5) the Madhupur High.|$|R
