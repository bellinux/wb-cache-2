60|$|That was her beginning; and {{the poor}} {{harebell}} was {{to get into a}} hot- house, where they wanted to turn her into a tall stately campanula, and she went through a great deal from the gardeners. There was to be a pretty fairy picture to every verse; and it would make a charming birthday present, much nicer than anything that could be bought; and Kate kept on smiling to herself as the drawings came before <b>her</b> <b>mind's</b> eye, and the rhymes to <b>her</b> <b>mind's</b> ear.|$|R

40|$|This study employs {{community}} action research and arts-based research to explore collaborative {{development of the}} women’s mobile photography community, <b>Her</b> <b>Mind's</b> Eye. <b>Her</b> <b>Mind’s</b> Eye is an exploratory, creative and contemporary women’s mobile photography community that exists both physically (through in-person meetings) and digitally (in online social media spaces). The group was designed to support women in learning and inquiring into mobile photography and new technologies within an encouraging, flexible, and supportive art creation community. At the same time, it looks at the women’s uses of the social/mobile photographic medium itself, finding that it was used for: personal memory keeping, communication, jumpstarting relational connectedness, experiencing an increased sense of awareness of one's environment, and of others’ ways of seeing and being in cities. Through this community, we expanded the possibilities of collaborative and informal education, meeting in-person and on the social media platforms Facebook and Instagram. We found that these social media applications can be utilized to create “real life” connections between diverse individuals with like interests, in order to form city-based, digital/physical composite networks of people interested in creative photographic development. Simultaneously, we investigate how experiences of physical places (the cities of Montreal and Vancouver) can be shared in the digital world. In addition to developing new networks and opportunities for creative growth, the group has a goal of exhibiting and promoting each woman’s artwork, and exploring women’s views and experiences of living in urban environments. <b>Her</b> <b>Mind’s</b> Eye held one exhibition {{during the time of}} this study, and several more afterwards. Lastly, {{it was found that the}} presence of group traits and structural supports similar to those within feminist pedagogy, such as an ethics of care, and sense of community, were fundamental to the successful operation of <b>Her</b> <b>Mind’s</b> Eye. Finally, having emerged from research origins, <b>Her</b> <b>Mind’s</b> Eye developed the unique form of a micro-SMP community, containing several clearly delineated boundaries, those of: group size, committed participation, and a defined focus. This made for a very successful community of inquiry and creativity, which however, poses questions for long-term group sustainability...|$|R
5|$|Thatcher {{returned}} to the backbenches as a constituency parliamentarian after leaving the premiership. Her domestic approval rating recovered after her resignation; the balance of public opinion was that her government had been good for the country. Aged 66, she retired from the House at the 1992 general election, saying that leaving the Commons would allow her more freedom to speak <b>her</b> <b>mind.</b>|$|E
5|$|The episode {{ends with}} Walter telling Olivia her brain waves {{are going back}} to normal, and that Scott's {{memories}} are fading from <b>her</b> <b>mind.</b> Olivia requests to enter the tank regardless, and she makes a last encounter with Scott, where he tells her he loved her and was going to marry her. She bids farewell to his consciousness, which has finally left her own.|$|E
5|$|Alex convinces Principal Skinner {{to have a}} school-dance {{rather than}} the regular yearly event of apple picking. Skinner agrees, so Alex and Lisa, {{accompanied}} by Sherri, Terri, Janey and Allison visit the mall to purchase party supplies, but the girls detour and begin trying on outfits for the dance, despite Lisa's protests. The group leave the mall, none speaking to each other. Lisa decides not to attend the dance, but changes <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> {{and goes to the}} school to take tickets at the door, but later arrives and discovers the boys and girls are standing on different sides of the room, and explains to Alex that it is like this because they are only children, not adults.|$|E

60|$|Generous souls {{are usually}} ardent.

5|$|Amy {{discovers that}} Kyle's adoptive parents have died. She and Victoria attend the funeral {{to see if}} Kyle is there and see him at the wake with his adoptive grandmother, Joanie Wright (Denise Black). When Kyle drops his toy, Amy {{picks it up and}} tries to give it back but Joanie doesn't hear her so she keeps it. Amy returns the next day and a barmaid gives her Joanie's address. Amy plans to return the toy but changes <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> and leaves. Needing to see Kyle, she persuades Andy to let her take baby Jack to Kyle's playgroup and makes friends with Joanie, telling her that she is {{studying}} childcare and asking if she needs any help with Kyle. Joanie accepts and allows Amy to look after Kyle occasionally. Val is thrilled when she finds out but Victoria and Eric think it is a bad idea and Eric tells Joanie that Amy is Kyle's birth mother. Disgusted, Joanie refuses to let Amy see Kyle again but is eventually persuaded to change <b>her</b> <b>mind.</b> Sadly, while Amy and Kyle are on a picnic together, Kyle almost drowns and Joanie blames Amy. She promptly bans her from seeing Kyle and refuses to even consider changing <b>her</b> <b>mind,</b> even calling the police when Amy visits repeatedly, who warn her to stay away. Desperate to see her son, Amy and Andy (who she is now dating) call Social Services to see if she can get custody but the social worker tells her that being awarded custody is very unlikely. Feeling now that the adoption was a mistake, Amy decides to snatch Kyle and go on the run. Kerry, understanding how Amy feels, tries to talk her out of it but when she can't, decides to help her. They go to Kyle's playgroup and kidnap him and Kerry drives them to the docks. During the drive, Val phones repeatedly but they don't answer. Eventually Kerry answers and Amy tearfully reveals her plans before throwing the phone away. Eric checks the computer's internet history and finds out where Amy is going. Cain, Andy, Val, Eric and Joanie all rush to the docks. In the end, Cain persuades Amy to return Kyle, warning her of the complications of the life on the run and how Kyle might be affected. She says goodbye to Kyle and gives him to Cain but fearing she'll be sent to prison, Amy leaves, devastating Val. Val later gets a call from Amy and learns that she is living in Ireland with her aunt.|$|E
5|$|Before Lauper {{covered the}} song, the band The Cars {{produced}} {{an early version}} of it that was not released. Shear's version was originally a folk rock song, but Lauper instead turned it into a pop ballad for her album, with a heavy emphasis on a synthesizer. According to Lauper, she wanted it to be just like Shear's version, with a bit more of an acoustic sound. However, she changed <b>her</b> <b>mind,</b> saying that she wanted to sing it like herself. Unlike her other singles from the album, this one did not have a music video released with it.|$|E
5|$|Bree {{struggles with}} her {{impending}} divorce. However, when Orson reveals {{that he has}} already begun dating his physical therapist, Bree takes an interest in her contractor, Keith (Brian Austin Green). Meanwhile, Lynette's old college frenemy Renee Perry (Vanessa Williams), wife of New York Yankees player Doug Perry, comes to visit her, but their friendly bickering quickly escalates into an argument. Lynette threatens to kick her out but changes <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> when Renee reveals that Doug has left her for another woman.|$|E
60|$|The crowd surged, pushing Arabella and {{her friends}} {{sometimes}} nearly into the river, {{and she would have}} laughed heartily at the horse-play that succeeded, if the imprint on <b>her</b> <b>mind's</b> eye of a pale, statuesque countenance she had lately gazed upon had not sobered her a little.|$|R
60|$|The {{suggestion}} of the sage Peter was {{a vision of}} glory to the mother. She already saw Dolph, in <b>her</b> <b>mind's</b> eye, with a cane at his nose, a knocker at his door, and an M.D. {{at the end of}} his name--one of the established dignitaries of the town.|$|R
60|$|But {{the child}} {{obviously}} remained unconvinced in <b>her</b> troubled <b>mind.</b>|$|R
5|$|Brooker {{had other}} ideas that {{were removed from}} the {{original}} script because they would be complicated to do. He said he could use these ideas in a sequel story which would involve the main character finding messages that she had left for herself on previous days as the process of erasing <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> starts to not function. However, as the location for the episode no longer exists, he felt it would be more practical to create a graphic novel instead of recreating the scenario.|$|E
5|$|Chandler {{was found}} guilty of the murders, and was sentenced to death on November 4, 1994. He {{maintained}} his innocence, and continued to pursue legal appeals while on Florida's Death Row. He admitted to the Madeira Beach incident but said the sex was consensual, and that the victim changed <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> during the act. Since Chandler had already been sentenced to death for the Rogers family murders, and prosecutors did not want to subject Blair to the emotional trauma of a rape trial, he was never prosecuted for Blair's rape.|$|E
5|$|Garga Samhita (a work on {{the life}} of Krishna) and Brahma Vaivarta Purana further tell of the {{previous}} birth of Putana as Ratnamala, the daughter of demon king Bali. When she saw Vamana, the previous incarnation of Krishna as a dwarf, she felt a desire to have him as her son and suckle him. She soon changed <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> and decided to kill Vamana, after he acquired all possessions of Bali. Krishna knew her desires and allowed her to fulfil both of them - to suckle him and to attempt to take his life.|$|E
