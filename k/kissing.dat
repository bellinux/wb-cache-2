5|$|In many human {{cultures}}, {{the act of}} premastication {{and direct}} mouth-to-mouth feeding is linked with the showing of affection, known as kiss feeding. In the Manus cultures of the Admiralty Islands, the act of premastication {{has been used by}} a women to remind children and descendants of their obligations to her. Some human cultures such as the people of Papua New Guinea in fact use mouth to mouth contact primarily for feeding premasticated food, with sexual <b>kissing</b> only observed after the arrival of Europeans. This form of feeding is believed to have evolved into the modern human acts of <b>kissing</b> and French <b>kissing.</b>|$|E
5|$|Devika and Himanshu Rai {{returned}} to India, where Himanshu produced a film titled Karma (1933). The film {{was his first}} talkie, and like his previous films, it was a joint production between people from India, Germany and the United Kingdom. Rai, who played the lead role, decided to cast Devika Rani as the female lead, and this marked her acting debut. Karma is credited as having been the first English language talkie made by an Indian. It {{was one of the}} earliest Indian films to feature a <b>kissing</b> scene. The <b>kissing</b> scene, involving Himanshu Rai and Devika Rani, lasted for about four minutes, and eighty years later, this stands as the record for duration of a <b>kissing</b> scene in Indian cinema as of 2014. Devika Rani also sang a song in the film, a bi-lingual song in English and Hindi. This song is said to be Bollywood's first English song.|$|E

5|$|In {{all human}} {{cultures}} premastication/kiss-feeding or <b>kissing</b> {{between mother and}} infant has been observed in all with <b>kissing</b> {{believed to be a}} socially ritualized form of feeding premasticated food. There is high similarity in the execution of kiss-feeding and human kisses (e.g. French kiss); in the former, the tongue is used to push food from mother to child with the child receiving both the mother's food and tongue in sucking movements, and the latter simply forgoes the premasticated food. In fact, observations across various species and cultures confirms that the act of <b>kissing</b> and premastication have most likely evolved from the similar relationship-based feeding behaviours.|$|E

40|$|Kisspeptin was {{originally}} found as a peptide product of <b>Kiss</b> 1 gene {{and is now}} {{supposed to be an}} essential central regulator of reproduction in mammals. However, there is now a growing body of evidence to suggest that <b>kiss</b> 2, the paralogous gene for <b>kiss</b> 1, evolved in parallel during vertebrate lineage, and the <b>kiss</b> 2 product also activates the GPR 54 (kisspeptin receptor) signaling pathways. Therefore, it is now widely accepted that both <b>kiss</b> 1 and <b>kiss</b> 2 are the kisspeptin genes. Interestingly, either <b>kiss</b> 1 or <b>kiss</b> 2 or both have been lost during evolution in many vertebrate species, and the functional significance of <b>kiss</b> 1 or <b>kiss</b> 2 for the central regulation of reproduction is suggested to vary according to the species. Here, we argue that the steroid sensitivity of the <b>kiss</b> 1 or <b>kiss</b> 2 neurons has been well conserved during evolution among tetrapods and teleosts, and thus it may be the key to understanding the functional homologies of certain populations of kisspeptin (<b>kiss</b> 1 or <b>kiss</b> 2) neurons among different species of vertebrates. In the present review, we will first introduce recent advances in the study of steroid sensitive <b>kiss</b> 1 and <b>kiss</b> 2 systems in vertebrates and effects of peptide administrations in vivo. By comparing the similarities and differences between <b>kiss</b> 1 and <b>kiss</b> 2 of neuronal localization and sensitivity to gonadal steroids in various tetrapods and teleosts, we discuss the evolution of kisspeptin neuronal systems after gene duplication of ancestral kisspeptin genes to give rise to <b>kiss</b> 1 and <b>kiss</b> 2...|$|R
