5|$|Mason {{became the}} first Liberal to be elected {{councillor}} for Ashton-under-Lyne in 1856. He was mayor of the council from 1857 to 1860 and retired from local politics in 1874 due to conflict with <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party.</b> Mason returned to the Liberals in 1878 when he stood for election as Member of Parliament for Ashton-under-Lyne. He was voted in and supported progressive policies, which included women's suffrage, making him unpopular within <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party.</b> He was MP from 1880 to 1885. When he died in 1886, aged 69, Hugh Mason had amassed £290,933 (now about £17million).|$|E
5|$|Governors who had {{previously}} been legislators have generally had greater success in achieving their legislative goals while governor. Three speakers of the house have become governor. Governor Joseph A. Wright had the worst relations of any governor with the assembly. He twice delivered speeches to a joint session where he harangued them for what he perceived to be corruption, accusing them of taking bribes from the Bank of Indiana. The legislature responded by overriding all his anti-banking vetoes. He was so disliked by <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party</b> that he was expelled from it after his term.|$|E
5|$|In 1930, President Herbert Hoover {{appointed}} Stanley to the International Joint Commission, a body {{charged with}} settling boundary disputes between the United States and Canada. Stanley became its chair in 1933. He {{was very proud}} of his service on the Commission, and once noted that nowhere on earth have two great powers lived so long as neighbors with so few disputes. He served until 1954 when he resigned under pressure from <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party.</b>|$|E
50|$|Between 1990 and 1992, Ludzhev was {{a member}} of the UDF, but after that founded <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>parties</b> and {{political}} coalitions such as the Union for National Salvation (Bulgarian: Обединение за национално спасение).|$|R
50|$|He was Mayor of Hamilton, New Zealand from 1968 to 1976, when he {{resigned}} {{to become a}} Member of Parliament. He strongly opposed many of the policies of <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party's</b> leader, Robert Muldoon.|$|R
5000|$|Johan George [...] "Jan" [...] Nagel (born 20 June 1939) is a Dutch {{politician}} {{who was a}} member of the Labour Party, and later formed <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>parties.</b> He is currently in the Pensioners' Party 50PLUS.|$|R
5|$|Mason's {{policies}} {{led him to}} {{come into}} constant clashes with the Conservative members of the council. He was not always popular within <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party</b> either and he even financed his own newspaper, the Ashton-under-Lyne News, to convey his views and provide competition for the pro-Liberal Ashton Reporter. Conflict with the Liberals drove Mason into early retirement from local politics in 1874 {{at the age of}} 57.|$|E
5|$|Nattrass failed a {{candidacy}} {{assessment in}} August 2013 and was duly deselected as UKIP {{candidate for the}} 2014 election, prompting him to initiate unsuccessful legal action against the party. He duly left UKIP and was in talks with the English Democrats, but cancelled plans to ally with them after they prematurely announced his joining the party. Nattrass, still a Member of the European Parliament (MEP), instead launched <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party</b> after considering a career as an independent. An Independence Party's creation was announced in October 2013, being renamed An Independence from Europe on 7 March 2014 to avoid confusion with UKIP. Nattrass had previously considered the label 4 A Referendum. Electoral Commission records show that he had registered <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party</b> significantly earlier, on 20 June 2012. From this date, he had also been filing financial statements for the fledgling, albeit inactive, organisation. The new party's development benefited from an incident in September 2013 when a Lincolnshire County Councillor, Chris Pain, was expelled from UKIP over an internal controversy. Fellow UKIP Councillors Alan Jesson and John Beaver supported Pain's innocence and were also expelled from the party for plotting to form a breakaway faction. All three became members of Nattrass' party and proceeded to represent their wards accordingly.|$|E
5|$|The {{debate about}} {{his place in}} the Conservative pantheon has {{continued}} since his death. Disraeli fascinated and divided contemporary opinion; he was seen by many, including some members of <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party,</b> as an adventurer and a charlatan and by others as a far-sighted and patriotic statesman. As an actor on the political stage he played many roles: Byronic hero, man of letters, social critic, parliamentary virtuoso, squire of Hughenden, royal companion, European statesman. His singular and complex personality has provided historians and biographers with a particularly stiff challenge.|$|E
50|$|The Conservative government's {{move was}} seen by {{opposition}} members and other observers as a partisan attempt to bankrupt the other political parties and further increase <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party's</b> financial advantage, and as a direct attack on the democratic process.|$|R
2500|$|McKay is {{a leading}} social {{conservative}} in the Liberal Party. He strongly opposed <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party’s</b> bill which legalised same-sex marriage in Canada in 2005. McKay is a past {{board member of the}} [...] at the University of Toronto Scarborough campus.|$|R
60|$|No {{one would}} ever know what it had cost him to obtain these papers. No {{one would ever}} know how much he had sacrificed of pride, revenge and hate {{in order to save}} a few shreds of <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party's</b> honour.|$|R
5|$|Tătărescu {{resigned}} {{his office}} on 6 November 1947, {{and was replaced by}} the Communist Ana Pauker. For the following two months, he was sidelined in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party</b> by PCR pressures, and removed from its leadership in January 1948 (being replaced with Petre N. Bejan — the party was subsequently known as National Liberal Party-Petre N. Bejan). One of his last actions as cabinet member had been to sign the document officially rejecting the Marshall Plan.|$|E
5|$|After {{years in}} opposition, in 1849, Paraná was {{appointed}} by the national government as president of Pernambuco Province to investigate a Liberal rebellion {{that had taken place}} a year earlier, and seek a fair trial for the rebels. Blamed by his party colleagues for the years in opposition and having lost much of his influence within <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party,</b> Paraná accepted the post, believing he could regain his place among his peers. With the nation internally pacified, he was sent to Uruguay in 1851 to forge an alliance with that country, and with the rebel Argentine provinces of Corrientes and Entre Ríos, against the Argentine Confederation. The alliance triumphed, and the Emperor elevated Paraná to the ranks of the titled nobility.|$|E
5|$|During {{his second}} term as governor, in 1906, Beckham made a bid to become a U.S. senator. His stance in favor of {{prohibition}} cost him the votes of four legislators in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party</b> and the General Assembly gave the seat to Republican William O. Bradley, who had been governor in 1895-99. Six years later Beckham secured the seat by popular election, but he lost his re-election bid in 1920 largely because of his pro-temperance views and his opposition to women's suffrage. Though he continued to {{play an active role}} in state politics for another two decades, he never returned to elected office, failing in his gubernatorial bid in 1927 and his senatorial campaign in 1936. He died in Louisville on January 9, 1940.|$|E
50|$|Albert Raney Anderson (November 8, 1837 - November 17, 1898) was a one-term U.S. Representative from Iowa's 8th congressional {{district}} in southwestern Iowa. He {{is best known}} for winning election to Congress and defeating a well-known incumbent, without winning <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party's</b> endorsement.|$|R
50|$|McKay is {{a leading}} social {{conservative}} in the Liberal Party. He strongly opposed <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party’s</b> bill which legalised same-sex marriage in Canada in 2005. McKay is a past {{board member of the}} Doris McCarthy Gallery at the University of Toronto Scarborough campus.|$|R
50|$|In early 2000 Drecun formed <b>his</b> <b>own</b> {{political}} <b>party</b> called Serbian Revival.|$|R
5|$|In 1847 a small {{political}} crisis occurred which removed Bentinck from {{the leadership and}} highlighted Disraeli's differences with <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party.</b> In that year's general election, Lionel de Rothschild had been returned for the City of London. As a practising Jew he could not take the oath of allegiance in the prescribed Christian form, and therefore could not take his seat. Lord John Russell, the Whig leader who had succeeded Peel as Prime Minister and like Rothschild was a member for the City of London, proposed in the Commons that the oath should be amended to permit Jews to enter Parliament.|$|E
5|$|In the 2005 civic election, he {{was again}} elected, though his Richmond First party only won {{three of the}} eight seats. He unsuccessfully lobbied his fellow councillors to appoint him to fill one of Richmond's two seats at Metro Vancouver. With not even <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party</b> members {{supporting}} him for the Metro Vancouver seat and finding himself being alone {{in a number of}} issues, such as supporting the SkyTrain line being elevated, opposing the tree preservation bylaw, and wanting to hire more police officers, Howard left the Richmond First party in February 2006 to be an independent.|$|E
5|$|Incumbent Republican Senator Scott Brown ran for {{re-election}} to a first full term. He {{had been elected}} in a special election in 2010 {{following the death of}} incumbent Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy. Brown faced no challengers from <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party.</b> For the Democrats, an initial wide field of prospective candidates narrowed after the entry of Harvard Law School Professor Elizabeth Warren, the architect of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Warren clinched near-unanimous party support, with {{all but one of the}} other Democratic candidates withdrawing following her entrance. After winning her party's nomination, eliminating any need for a primary, she faced Brown in the general election.|$|E

5|$|Raised a Roman Catholic, Wilders {{left the}} church at his coming of age. His travels to Israel and the greater Middle East as a young adult helped form his {{political}} views. Wilders worked as a speechwriter for the conservative-liberal People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (Volkspartij voor Vrijheid en Democratie – VVD), and later served as parliamentary assistant to party leader Frits Bolkestein from 1990 to 1998. He {{was elected to the}} Utrecht city council in 1997, and one year later to the House of Representatives. Citing irreconcilable differences over the party's position on the accession of Turkey to the European Union, he left the VVD in 2004 to form <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party,</b> the Party for Freedom.|$|E
5|$|The {{opportunity}} {{to graduate from}} provincial to national politics came soon after. The Conservative prime minister Honório Hermeto Carneiro Leão, Marquis of Paraná, faced overwhelming opposition from <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party</b> in parliament. Paraná knew that the party's principles were seen as irrelevant and ignored at local and provincial levels. A cabinet could use patronage alone to gain backing from local bosses for its national candidates, including {{in the province of}} Rio Grande do Sul. Porto Alegre was a Liberal allied to Conservatives in his province. He pledged support to Paraná and in 1857 was elected general deputy (member of the Chamber of Deputies, the national legislature's lower house). He was reelected in 1860.|$|E
5|$|Though Brownlee {{was no more}} {{enthusiastic}} than Reid about deficits, his continued confidence in his Provincial Treasurer was evidenced by his decision to give him yet another ministerial portfolio. In 1930 Brownlee secured Alberta's long-sought control over its natural resources from the federal government, and he appointed Reid Alberta's first Minister of Lands and Mines on 10 October 1930. In this capacity, Reid favoured private over public ownership. He opposed calls from <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party</b> to promote government-developed hydroelectricity projects, and viewed the provincially owned railways as a burden to the government, though they finally turned a profit in 1927. He was a leading advocate of selling them to private interests, a course that was eventually followed in 1929.|$|E
50|$|In 1938, the new Prime Minister, Kálmán Darányi, {{decided to}} make his new {{policies}} very pro-Germany and pro-Italy, a bit like how Hoederer wanted to join with the other parties to try to evolve as a country and stay on everyone's good side to get <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party's</b> point across.|$|R
50|$|Aside from <b>his</b> <b>own</b> Republican <b>Party</b> (HHK), Sargysan {{was backed}} by Prosperous Armenia (BHK).|$|R
50|$|Musharraf {{launched}} <b>his</b> <b>own</b> political <b>party,</b> the All Pakistan Muslim League, in June 2010.|$|R
5|$|Though Nixon {{lost much}} popular support, even from <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party,</b> he {{rejected}} accusations of wrongdoing {{and vowed to}} stay in office. He insisted {{that he had made}} mistakes, but had no prior knowledge of the burglary, did not break any laws, and did not learn of the cover-up until early 1973. On October 10, 1973, Vice President Agnew resigned —unrelated to Watergate— and was convicted on charges of bribery, tax evasion and money laundering during his tenure as Governor of Maryland. Nixon chose Gerald Ford, Minority Leader of the House of Representatives, to replace Agnew. One researcher suggested Nixon effectively disengaged from his own administration after the swearing in of Gerald Ford as Vice President on December 6, 1973.|$|E
5|$|Van der Byl {{was born}} and raised in Cape Town, the son of the South African {{politician}} P V van der Byl, and served in the Middle East and Europe during the Second World War. After a high-flying international education, he moved to the self-governing British colony of Southern Rhodesia in 1950 to manage family farms. He went into politics in the early 1960s through his involvement with farming trade bodies, and became a government minister responsible for propaganda. One of the leading agitators for Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence in 1965, Van der Byl was afterwards responsible for introducing press censorship. He was unsuccessful in his attempt to persuade international opinion to recognise Rhodesia, but was popular among members of <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party.</b>|$|E
5|$|Walpole {{directed}} domestic policy, {{and after}} the resignation of his brother-in-law Townshend in 1730 also controlled George's foreign policy. Historians generally believe that George played an honorific role in Britain, and closely followed the advice of Walpole and senior ministers who made the major decisions. Although the king was eager for war in Europe, his ministers were more cautious. The Anglo-Spanish War was brought to an end, and George unsuccessfully pressed Walpole to join the War of the Polish Succession {{on the side of}} the German states. In April 1733, Walpole withdrew an unpopular excise bill that had gathered strong opposition, including from within <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party.</b> George lent support to Walpole by dismissing the bill's opponents from their court offices.|$|E

50|$|Despite {{winning an}} overall majority, Horn decided {{to form a}} {{coalition}} with the Free Democrats, giving him a two-thirds majority. This was partly to assuage public concerns inside and outside Hungary over an ex-communist party with an overall majority, and partly to get his reform package past <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party's</b> left wing.|$|R
