5|$|Capella {{is closer}} to the north {{celestial}} pole than any other first magnitude star. Its northern declination is such that it is actually invisible south of latitude 44°S—this includes southernmost New Zealand, Argentina and Chile as well as the Falkland Islands. Conversely it is circumpolar north of 44°N: for the whole of the United Kingdom, Canada and the northernmost United States, the star never sets. Capella and Vega are {{on opposite sides of the}} pole, at about the same distance from it, such that an imaginary line between the two stars will nearly pass through Polaris. Visible halfway between the Belt of Orion and Polaris, Capella <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>its</b> highest in the night sky at midnight in early December and is regarded as a prominent star of the winter sky in the northern hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|During {{the solar}} cycle's declining phase, energy shifts from the {{internal}} {{toroidal magnetic field}} to the external poloidal field, and sunspots diminish in number and size. At solar-cycle minimum, the toroidal field is, correspondingly, at minimum strength, sunspots are relatively rare, and the poloidal field <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>its</b> maximum strength. With {{the rise of the}} next 11-year sunspot cycle, differential rotation shifts magnetic energy back from the poloidal to the toroidal field, but with a polarity that is opposite to the previous cycle. The process carries on continuously, and in an idealized, simplified scenario, each 11-year sunspot cycle corresponds to a change, then, in the overall polarity of the Sun's large-scale magnetic field.|$|E

5|$|The Iago sparrow is gregarious while {{foraging}} and breeding. Outside of {{the breeding}} season, Iago sparrows {{are always in}} flocks, which may be of considerable size. It flocks with other birds, even warblers such as the blackcap and the Cape Verde warbler. The Iago sparrow is not very shy toward humans, allowing them to approach, even while it <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>its</b> nest. Birds on the isolated and uninhabited island of Raso will even perch on human visitors with little fear. Because of the scarcity of water to drink in its habitat, it has a strong attraction to sources of water, and large flocks may congregate when humans provide water it can drink. It often is seen dust bathing in small groups, a behavior necessary to keep clean with a paucity of water.|$|E

5|$|The addax mainly eats {{grasses and}} leaves of any {{available}} shrubs, leguminous herbs and bushes. These animals are well-adapted {{to exist in}} their desert habitat, as they can live without water {{for long periods of}} time. Addax form herds of five to 20 members, consisting of both males and females. They are led by the oldest female. Due to its slow movements, the antelope is an easy target for its predators: lions, humans, African wild dogs, cheetahs, and leopards. Breeding season <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>its</b> peak during winter and early spring. The natural habitat of the addax are arid regions, semideserts and sandy and stony deserts.|$|E
5|$|Tombaugh's {{task was}} to {{systematically}} capture sections {{of the night sky}} in pairs of images. Each image in a pair was taken two weeks apart. He then placed both images of each section in a machine called a blink comparator, which by exchanging images quickly created a time lapse illusion of the movement of any planetary body. To reduce the chances that a faster-moving (and thus closer) object be mistaken for the new planet, Tombaugh imaged each region near its opposition point, 180 degrees from the Sun, where the apparent retrograde motion for objects beyond Earth's orbit <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>its</b> strongest. He also took a third image as a control to eliminate any false results caused by defects in an individual plate. Tombaugh decided to image the entire zodiac, rather than focus on those regions suggested by Lowell.|$|E

5|$|Under certain conditions, protons can {{re-enter}} the mitochondrial matrix without {{contributing to}} ATP synthesis. This process {{is known as}} proton leak or mitochondrial uncoupling and {{is due to the}} facilitated diffusion of protons into the matrix. The process results in the unharnessed potential energy of the proton electrochemical gradient being released as heat. The process is mediated by a proton channel called thermogenin, or UCP1. Thermogenin is a 33 kDa protein first discovered in 1973. Thermogenin is primarily found in brown adipose tissue, or brown fat, and is responsible for non-shivering thermogenesis. Brown adipose tissue is found in mammals, and <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>its</b> highest levels in early life and in hibernating animals. In humans, brown adipose tissue is present at birth and decreases with age.|$|E
5|$|West Creek is less {{affected}} by episodic acidification {{than most of}} the rest of the upper Fishing Creek watershed, with the exception of Coles Creek. The pH of West Creek <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>its</b> lowest in late winter and spring, when it is typically around 6.3. During the rest of the year, it is above 7.0. The entire pH range of the creek ranges from just over 6.0 to 7.2 or 7.3. The concentration of dissolved aluminum in West Creek is under 70 micrograms per liter, considerably less than the concentration needed to kill fish. The aluminum concentration is, in fact, usually approximately zero and is often under 40 micrograms per liter. However, early in 2011, the concentration was observed twice to be nearly 60 micrograms per liter.|$|E
5|$|Atlantic puffins are {{cautious}} {{when approaching}} the colony and no bird likes {{to land in}} a location where other puffins are not already present. They make several circuits of the colony before alighting. On the ground they spend much time preening, spreading oil from their preen gland and setting each feather in its correct position with beak or claw. They also spend time standing by their burrow entrances and interacting with passing birds. Dominance is shown by an upright stance, with fluffed chest feathers and cocked tail, an exaggerated slow walk, head jerking and gaping. Submissive birds lower their head and hold their body horizontal and scurry past dominant individuals. Birds normally signal their intention to take off by briefly lowering their body before running down the slope to gain momentum. If a bird is startled and takes off unexpectedly, a panic can spread through the colony with all the birds launching themselves {{into the air and}} wheeling around in a great circle. The colony <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>its</b> most active in the evening, with birds standing outside their burrows, resting on the turf or strolling around. Then the slopes empty for the night as the birds fly out to sea to roost, often choosing to do so at fishing grounds ready for early morning provisioning.|$|E

5|$|Due to the Bay Area's diverse topography, {{the result}} of the clashing tectonic plates, the region is home to {{numerous}} microclimates that lead to pronounced differences in climate and temperature over short distances. Within the city of San Francisco, natural and artificial topographical features direct the movement of wind and fog, resulting in startlingly varied climates between city blocks. Along the Golden Gate Strait, oceanic wind and fog from the Pacific Ocean are able to penetrate the mountain barriers inland into the Bay Area. During the summer, rising hot air in California's interior valleys creates a low pressure area that draws winds from the North Pacific High through the Golden Gate, which creates the city's characteristic cool winds and fog. The microclimate phenomenon is most pronounced during this time, when fog penetration <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>its</b> maximum in areas near the Golden Gate strait, while the South Bay and areas further inland are sunny and dry.|$|E
5|$|The Chaco Low is a semi–permanent low {{pressure}} system situated {{east of the}} Andes that is approximately located between 20oS and 30oS during summer (displaced to the north in winter). It is stronger in the summer than in winter due {{to a combination of}} high insolation, dry surface conditions, and southward displacement of the South Atlantic and South Pacific High (this makes it difficult for cold fronts to enter at lower latitudes). The Chaco Low interacts with the South Atlantic High, generating a pressure gradient that draws moist air from the northeast to coastal and central regions of Argentina. It also forces easterly winds from the Amazon basin to move southward, which is reinforced by the funneling effect from both the Andes and the Brazilian Plateau. The Chaco Low brings large amounts of moisture that favour the development of convective thunderstorms during summer, reaching as far south as 35oS. This movement of air from the north owing to the interaction between the Chaco Low and the South Atlantic high is the strongest in summer when the Chaco Low <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>its</b> strongest. These winds bring hot, humid tropical air from the north. Sustained and intense winds from the north are responsible for severe weather events such as heat waves and severe convection. During winter, the Chaco Low weakens as a result of lower insolation. This is partly responsible for the decrease in winter precipitation over much of Argentina (in addition to northward displacement of westerlies) due to a weaker transport of air masses from the tropics. This excludes areas south of 40oS where it is dominated by westerlies.|$|E
5|$|The chicks {{take from}} 34 to 50 days to fledge, the period {{depending}} on the abundance of their food supply. In years of fish shortage, the whole colony may experience a longer fledgling period but the normal range is 38 to 44 days, by which time chicks will have reached about 75% of their mature body weight. The chick may come to the burrow entrance to defecate but does not usually emerge into the open and seems to have an aversion to light until it is nearly fully fledged. Although the supply of fish by the adults reduces {{over the last few}} days spent in the nest, the chick is not abandoned as happens in the Manx shearwater. On occasions, an adult has been observed provisioning a nest even after the chick has departed. During the last few days underground, the chick sheds its down and the juvenile plumage is revealed. Its relatively small beak and its legs and feet are a dark colour and it lacks the white facial patches of the adult. The chick finally leaves its nest at night, when the risk of predation <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>its</b> lowest. When the moment arrives, it emerges from the burrow, usually for the first time, and walks, runs and flaps its way to the sea. It cannot fly properly yet so descending a cliff is perilous; when it reaches the water it paddles out to sea, and may be three kilometres (two miles) away from the shore by daybreak. It does not congregate with others of its kind and will not return to land for two or three years.|$|E
