Considering {{the complexity of}} <b>trimming</b> <b>dies,</b> a modular design method was used to define module’s functions and determine the design processes of <b>trimming</b> <b>dies.</b> Through analyzing the relationship of structure and function of <b>trimming</b> <b>dies,</b> the systematic analysis of modularization for <b>trimming</b> <b>dies</b> is achieved from assembly-level division. By using parametric design method, the internal connection between modules is analysis from part-level division, and the module-based design process of complex part is accomplished. The CAD system for <b>trimming</b> <b>dies</b> is developed on platform of UGNX software. The application results show the high efficiency and design flexibility...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{explains}} how to determine {{and eliminate the}} causes of quality problems {{in the production of}} connectors and small electronic components for the automotive industry. The process of making these components is carried out by use of both high speed and low speed metal stamping presses. There are descriptions of the different designs of editing punches, stamping <b>dies,</b> <b>trimming</b> and molding tools and how unplanned issues can occur during the production process. It addresses all the customer requirements for quality end products, listing the type of material, finishes and technology used for the production of individual components as well as their functionality, durability, and economic impacts. All examples of changes in the design or technology of metal stamping presses are based on many years of practical experience and most of them can be successfully applied in other similar type of instrument production...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. It’s simple {{technology}} to manufacture big <b>trimming</b> <b>die</b> by hardfacing on the die insert of steel. In this paper, {{a kind of}} surface hardfacing technology which deposited by using D 322 on 42 CrMo steel were studied instead of traditional manufacturing process. The effect of hardfacing parameters on microstructure, hardness and wear resistance are tested and analyzed. The key points of manufacturing <b>trimming</b> <b>die</b> by using hardfacing method was given out. There are no defects in the hardfacing layer. The average hardfacing layer is higher than 57. 5 HRC. The hardfacing surface has good figurations and hardfacing layer has good wear resistance. The hardfacing for real product of <b>trimming</b> <b>die</b> is completed successfully and their properties reach or exceed those of dies made with traditional technology. This technology is also an effective approach of repairing other cold working dies. The experimental {{results indicate that the}} hardfacing technology has much more advantages, cheaper than that of traditional process. The wear resistant test of hardfacing layers were carried out by using different welding current. The best welding current for hadfacing 42 CrMo steel is 110 Ampere. The wear mechanism of hardfacing layer is belongs to abrasive wear model...|$|R

40|$|AISI D 2 steels {{are widely}} used as tools for forming, drawing and <b>trimming</b> <b>dies</b> due to its high wear resistance, high {{compressive}} strength and low distortion, and its performance as a <b>trim</b> <b>die</b> material for cutting ultra-high strength steels (at 1 GPa or above) is investigated in this study. To simulate the production trimming process under a laboratory accelerated fatigue condition, a <b>trim</b> <b>die</b> simulator and testing technique have been developed. In this test 12 ̆ 2 cubic die samples were used that offers total 12 cutting edges of 6 different material grain orientations in shearing, and with adjustable die clearance. A non-contact metal removal volume measurement was developed to quantify the degree of fatigue damage during cyclic loading, and the metallurgical replica method was used at different number of cycles from the interrupted testing for obtaining micro-damage information. The damage rate {{at the cutting edge}} was obtained as a function of trimming process variables, including the die material grain orientations, the loading frequency, and the amplitude of fatigue loading. The microstructure, micro-damage and fractured surfaces were examined with optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The results show that there exist two types of distinct damage processes: the continuous contact deformation process that occurs at a low fatigue load, and the discontinuous cutting edge chipping process at a high fatigue loading with significantly higher material removal rate. The chipping involves crack initiation and propagation within the carbide phase surrounding the pro-eutectic grains, leading to grain broken and fall apart. An empirical <b>trim</b> <b>die</b> damage rate model in Paris law form is obtained from experimental data regression, and can be used for tool life prediction. The grain orientation relative to the cutting direction is found to have remarkable effect on trimming damage rate...|$|R

The need for the soft tissue cast is quite evident as the soft tissue emergence profile that surrounds the prepared tooth is destroyed in the {{process of fabrication}}. This article describes a modified technique to fabricate the soft tissue cast for the conventional fixed partial denture. The impression made with the polyvinylsiloxane was first poured to prepare the die cast. After retrieval of the cast, the same impression was poured second time with the resin based resilient material to cover the facial and proximal gingival areas. The remaining portion of the impression was poured with the gypsum material. This technique does not require additional clinical appointment, second impression procedure, technique sensitive manipulations with impression, or cumbersome laboratory procedures. The simplicity of this technique facilitates and justifies its routine use in fabrication of the fixed partial denture...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, most of {{the tools}} of Volvo Cars Body Components (VCBC) in Olofström are {{hardened}} by flame hardening or induction hardening process. Indeed, VCBC has developed their own equipment for flame and induction hardening: However, Volvo has detected that 74 % of {{the total cost of}} one year maintenance was caused by <b>trim</b> <b>dies</b> and the main reason is actually trim edge problems which represent 26 % of year maintenance. This is why the R&D Forming &amp; Material department is investigating some ways to reduce those excessive costs caused by cutting tools. As a consequence, in this project, we will study the laser hardening of cutting tools. The aims of this project were to investigate: * The laser hardening process * The limits of different tool materials with this laser process This master thesis should give a beginning of answer to the following question: Is the laser hardening process a suitable alternative to induction hardening process for <b>trim</b> <b>dies</b> at VCBC ?

Hot half-trimmed part can be inaccurately positioned on mechanical <b>trimming</b> <b>die</b> by relatively low accuracy of automatic transferring system or manual way, leading to the change of clearance in mechanical trimming. Taking into account this position error, a suitable operation window for trimming of flat and inclined part was constructed by FE-simulation and then was verified by experiment. It was determined from the operation window that effective mechanical trimming for both flat and inclined part can be performed successfully with hot half-trimming depth of 1. 0 [*]mm in hot half-trimming and clearance between 0. 1 [*]mm and 0. 124 [*]mm in subsequent mechanical trimming, without regard to position error...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:-AISI D 3 {{tool steel}} is a high-carbon, highchromium, oil-hardening tool steel that is {{characterized}} by a relatively high attainable hardness and numerous, large, chromium-rich alloy carbides in the microstructure. These carbides provide good resistance to wear from sliding contact with other metals and abrasive materials. Typical applications for D 3 tool steel include Blanking, stamping, and cold forming dies and punches for long runs; lamination dies, Bending, forming, and seaming rolls, Cold <b>trimmer</b> <b>dies</b> or rolls, Burnishing dies or rolls, Plug gauges, Drawing dies for bars or wire.

50|$|In the Middle Ages bars {{of metal}} were cast and {{hammered}} {{out on an}} anvil. Portions of the flattened sheets were then cut out with shears, struck between <b>dies</b> and again <b>trimmed</b> with shears. A similar method {{had been used in}} Ancient Egypt during the Ptolemaic Kingdom (c. 300 BC), but had been forgotten. Square pieces of metal were also cut from cast bars, converted into round disks by hammering and then struck between dies. In striking, the lower die was fixed into a block of wood, and the blank piece of metal laid upon it by hand. The upper die was then placed on the blank, and kept in position by means of a holder round which was placed a roll of lead to protect the hand of the operator while heavy blows were struck with a hammer. An early improvement was the introduction of a tool resembling a pair of tongs, the two dies being placed one at the extremity of each leg. This avoided the necessity of readjusting the dies between blows, and ensured greater accuracy in the impression.|$|R
500|$|The {{following}} are the four steps in traditional die casting, also known as , these are also the basis {{for any of the}} die casting variations: die preparation, filling, ejection, and shakeout. The dies are prepared by spraying the mold cavity with lubricant. The lubricant both helps control the temperature of the die and it also assists in the removal of the casting. The dies are then closed and molten metal is injected into the dies under high pressure; between [...] Once the mold cavity is filled, the pressure is maintained until the casting solidifies. The dies are then opened and the shot (shots are different from castings because there can be multiple cavities in a die, yielding multiple castings per shot) is ejected by the ejector pins. Finally, the shakeout involves separating the scrap, which includes the gate, runners, sprues and flash, from the shot. This is often done using a special <b>trim</b> <b>die</b> in a power press or hydraulic press. Other methods of shaking out include sawing and grinding. A less labor-intensive method is to tumble shots if gates are thin and easily broken; separation of gates from finished parts must follow. This scrap is recycled by remelting it. The yield is approximately 67%.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{the life}} cycle of car models has {{decreased}} from 7 to 5 years and the volume sizes are becoming shorter in the automotive industry. The increasing number of car models introduced to the market means that a fewer number of parts must pay the costs for the tool/die design and manufacturing. In consequence, {{there is a need for}} reducing the manufacturing cost and lead time for the tool and die manufacturing. The higher product requirements (reduced weight, increased safety and lower emissions) have meant that a larger number of car body parts must be made in AHSS (Advanced High Strength Steels). This has led to a significantly larger abrasive and fatigue tool wear. The tool wear is therefore expected to increase even more in the future, if the issue is not addressed properly. Today the total maintenance cost of the trimming tools are approximately 70 % of the total die maintenance cost in a press shop. The purpose of this thesis is to increase the knowledge of how surface topography and geometry on <b>trimming</b> <b>dies</b> influences tool wear, tool life and part quality. Methods to analyze wear, measure cutting edge radius on production dies and methods to analyze surface topography have been established. The cutting edge geometry has been evaluated with respect to the cutting edge radius and the angle of the upper tool. Experimental testing together with FE simulation has been used. Results show that by using a cutting edge radius of 80 µm, rather than 20 µm, the tool “wear in phase” can be more controlled. Sheet metal trimming when cutting at high angles (25 ° - 60 °) has been evaluated. Two versions of the geometry on the lower cutting edge was tested, a traditional geometry and a 1. 5 mm shelf geometry. Results show that the shelf geometry reduces side force, especially for the higher angles. The shelf geometry also reduces the sharpness off the cut edge profile, thus increasing part quality, compared to the traditional geometry. Surfaces on both semi-industrial test dies and dies used in production were analyzed with different surface topography analysis methods. The result shows that the wear process is different on the different sides of the trimming edge. The texture direction of the surface is changed due to wear, with the strongest change on the clearance side of the edge. The roughness on sheet side of the edge is reduced due to a hammering effect from the sheet material. The result on the semiindustrial test dies and the production dies correlates well. Future research will be continued on surface topography and trimming edge geometry and its relationship to used manufacturing methods and tool wear...|$|R
