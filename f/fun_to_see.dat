The episode features the revelation of Homer's middle name, [...] "Jay", which is a [...] "tribute" [...] to animated characters such as Bullwinkle J. Moose and Rocket J.

Electronic Gaming Monthly Eric Patterson also commented on how downloadable content in the industry is seen as content pulled from the retail release to be sold as an addition, which Enter the Dominatrix development history flips on its head. He added that {{in all of his}} industry experience, he had never otherwise seen a developer purposefully let its fans play [...] "shelved" [...] content, and thus found the experience [...] "fascinating".

500|$|The {{idea of a}} {{time travel}} thriller film {{originated}} between screenwriters Bill Marsilii and Terry Rossio, who communicated via email in attempts to develop the plot due to communication difficulties.

However, by 2006, the two screenwriters had completed the concept. Brian Greene from Columbia University was brought in as a consultant to help create a scientifically plausible feel to the script. Greene stated [...] "the way I try to explain wormholes in terms of bending paper and connecting the corners, that's there in the film and it was <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that that made it in."

I'm so thankful that {{it got so}} crazy and turned so upside down, and how nuts this character is. It's so fun." [...] Her instability has regularly resulted in Cheryl being sent into mental institutions. She is often sexually aroused from being choked. Commentators have described Cheryl as [...] "", [...] "insane", [...] "glue-chugging", and [...] "empty-headed".

SFScope columnist Sarah Stegall praised Joshua Jackson and Lance Reddick's performances, giving Jackson [...] "top honors" [...] as he [...] "once again shows us the fangs behind that cherubic smile". Stegall also noted the allusions to The X-Files, which included an episode playing during the first shapeshifter's transformation, [...] "Which is fine, as far as I'm concerned. If I can't have Mulder and Scully, I'll take Walter and Peter, and even Astrid and Charlie... I'm happy to see another show on TV that deals with the unknowable and the possibly fascinating, with an actual budget in hand. If this show started out as X-Files Light, it's developing some serious weight now." ...|$|E
500|$|Likewise George Avalos and Michael Liedtke of the Contra Costa Times {{praised the}} {{on-screen}} return of characters such as Mulder and Krycek. They felt so many eighth-season episodes worked well because [...] "Chris Carter {{seems to be}} taking an even more active role in the series that is most closely identified with him." [...] Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B+" [...] and wrote that, [...] "it’s a measure of a show’s effectiveness to see how convincingly the writers can threaten a major character, and have that character’s subsequent survival not be a cheat", in regards to Mulder's resurrection. He applauded the fact that the episode is suspenseful, even though the ending has a certain inevitability. Handlen also positively commented on both Anderson's performance—although pointing out that she [...] "is largely pushed to the side for the majority" [...] of the episode—and Lea's reappearance, noting that [...] "it's always <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Krycek". However, he argued that the conclusion [...] "makes less sense the more you think about it", but that the final scene with Mulder and Scully [...] "makes up for the contrivance." ...|$|E

500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics. Dave Foster of DVD Times said that [...] "Homer the Smithers" [...] shows [...] "just how dependent upon Smithers Mr. Burns is". He {{added that the}} staging and animation of the scene in which Homer tries to apologize to Burns [...] "will remain engraved in your memory {{in the same way}} as some of the series finest dialogue can". DVD Movie Guides Colin Jacobson enjoyed the episode and commented that [...] "any doubts about Smithers' sexuality will not last long when we see his vacation". Jacobson would have liked to see more scenes from Smithers' vacation, but he still thought the episode offered [...] "nice exposition" [...] for the character. He added: [...] "It’s <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> more about his pampering of Burns, and it’s amusing to watch Homer take over for him." [...] Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict considered the best part of the episode to be the scenes of Smithers on vacation. She concluded her review by giving the episode a grade of A. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it a [...] "very good episode, and an unusually straightforward one for this surreal season".|$|E

Around 150 zombies were eventually used and Mr. X Inc's visual effects supervisor, Dennis Berardi, added more in post-production. For Alice's clones they shot motion control photography for multiple passes of Jovovich. For the wide shots they took digital photo doubles. Visual effects production manager Eric Robertson described {{the look of the}} film, [...] "interesting contrasts, pure whites, which is a staggering look. It's so clean and tight along with some real darkness too that may evoke a bit of a feel of Silent Hill. So we've got the extremes, but it's definitely a unique look for this incarnation and it's been <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> those looks." [...] A burned cityscape with ash and smoke in the sky was created to depict a postapocalyptic Los Angeles, in which most of the film is set.

Grelck gave the episode a rating of 4/5 and named it one of his two favorite episodes of the season. He added that it [...] "allows us to see that Homer really does love Marge a lot without having to blatantly stamp sentimentality all over it. The episode is strange, goofy and fun." [...] Colin Jacobson at DVD Movie Guide said that [...] "the concept of Marge’s anger at Homer got old, but this episode managed to offer a reasonably entertaining affair. It was <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Homer treated like a party god, and this offered a few nice moments. The overall level of quality remained good throughout the show, but it didn’t rise to any great heights." [...] David Packard at DVD Verdict said {{in a review of}} The Simpsons [...] "Gone Wild" [...] DVD that [...] "this episode sports some of the awkward animation and voice work that is prevalent in episodes from the first season. That aspect isn't an issue to me; in fact, I quite enjoy season one as it shows the early efforts of the series getting its legs in making the transition from its origin on The Tracey Ullman Show. The problem I have with this episode is that it's not particularly funny. I chuckled a few times, but the episode doesn't have the rollicking gags and sly humor of the two episodes to follow." ...|$|E

50|$|It was {{directed}} by Brian Trenchard-Smith. This was the biggest budget he had ever enjoyed for a film: He says he got the job because of his wor on Britannic and Happy Face Murders.When I came on board for film... I thought, I’m {{going to have a}} bit of a sly smile at some of this stuff, not being a Pentecostal Christian myself. But if the Pentecostal Christians want to give me $20 million to make a film, I’m not going to say no. So I thought, what are my genre aspirations in this rather confused screenplay I‘ve been given? Let’s straighten it out along the following lines: let’s say it’s The Omen (1976) meets Air Force One (1997), with a bit of End of Days (1999)... And they fight the Battle of the Bulge, and are awarded with the Second Coming! I mean, those are some nice elements to put into your martini. And so I proceeded along those lines. It was a <b>fun</b> film <b>to</b> make, and primarily, the faithful have seen it. But I can tell you, it did have a slight sense of humor, even sub textually, it’s a <b>fun</b> film <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> It was interesting <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it with a mixed audience of Pentecostals and secular hedonists, and it was interesting <b>to</b> <b>see</b> where either side of the audience laughed, or they both laughed, or the Christians cheered. So it was interesting <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it, ultimately. It’s a fun romp laughs, not usually what happens with a religious film.|$|R

Later on, after Jerry has cashed out with a loss but George hangs on to make a profit, George's incongruous happiness (replete with cigar, suit, and him daintily picking up the check) is equally amusing. But script-wise, it's again apparent that David and Seinfeld are pretty new {{to the concept of}} actually sketching out coherent plots... The whole thing kinda just moves along until it isn't moving along anymore. It's not unfunny, and there's some choice dialog, like Jerry and George having the first of many Superman conversations about whether he has super-humor powers." ...|$|E
