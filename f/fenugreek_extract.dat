40|$|Abstract Background Drugs {{used both}} in {{classical}} chemotherapy {{and the more}} recent targeted therapy do not have cancer cell specificity and, hence, cause severe systemic side effects. Tumors also develop resistance to such drugs due to heterogeneity of cell types and clonal selection. Several traditional dietary ingredients from plants, on the other hand, {{have been shown to}} act on multiple targets/pathways, and may overcome drug resistance. The dietary agents are safe and readily available. However, application of plant components for cancer treatment/prevention requires better understanding of anticancer functions and elucidation of their mechanisms of action. The current study focuses on the anticancer properties of fenugreek, a herb with proven anti-diabetic, antitumor and immune-stimulating functions. Method Jurkat cells were incubated with 30 to 1500 μg/mL concentrations of 50 % ethanolic extract of dry fenugreek seeds and were followed for changes in viability (trypan blue assay), morphology (microscopic examination) and autophagic marker LC 3 transcript level (RT-PCR). Results Incubation of Jurkat cells with <b>fenugreek</b> <b>extract</b> at concentrations ranging from 30 to 1500 μg/mL for up to 3 days resulted in cell death in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Jurkat cell death was preceded by the appearance of multiple large vacuoles, which coincided with transcriptional up-regulation of LC 3. GC-MS analysis of <b>fenugreek</b> <b>extract</b> indicated the presence of several compounds with anticancer properties, including gingerol (4. 82 %), cedrene (2. 91 %), zingerone (16. 5 %), vanillin (1. 52 %) and eugenol (1. 25 %). Conclusions Distinct morphological changes involving appearance of large vacuoles, membrane disintegration and increased expression of LC 3 transcripts indicated that <b>fenugreek</b> <b>extract</b> induced autophagy and autophagy-associated death of Jurkat cells. In addition to the already known apoptotic activation, induction of autophagy may be an additional mechanism underlying the anticancer properties of fenugreek. This is the first report showing fenugreek as an inducer of autophagy in human cells and further work is needed to define the various intermediates of the autophagic pathway. </p...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of 6 weeks swimming training and Trigonella foenum-graecum seed (<b>fenugreek)</b> <b>extract,</b> alone and in combination, on plasma glucose and cardiac antioxidant enzyme activity of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. MethodsFifty male Wistar rats were divided into five groups: diabetic control (DC, n =  8); healthy control (HC, n =  11); swimming training (S, n =  11); swimming training + fenugreek seed extract (1. 74  g/kg body weight; SF 1, n =  11); and swimming training + fenugreek seed extract (0. 87  g/kg body weight; SF 2, n =  9). Streptozotocin was used for the induction of diabetes. Results were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey test. ResultsIn comparison with the DC group, all groups exhibited a significant decrease in body weight (p <  0. 05), except for the HC group. SF 1 and HC groups showed significant decreases in plasma glucose levels compared with the DC group (p <  0. 05). S, SF 1, SF 2, and HC groups showed significant elevations in cardiac antioxidant enzymes activity in comparison with the DC group. ConclusionThe results indicated that the combination of endurance swimming training and fenugreek seed extract can significantly reduce the plasma glucose levels and increase cardiac antioxidant enzymes activity in diabetic rats. Our findings suggest that this combination could be useful for the treatment of hyperglycemia and cardiac oxidative stress induced by diabetes mellitus...|$|E
40|$|Background and aim: Diabetes {{mellitus}} {{is associated}} {{with some of the}} metabolic dysfunctions represented with chronic hyperglycemia.   This disease can disrupt the function of testicular tissue and decline male sexual ability. Some of the medicinal herbs such as fenugreeks have protective effects on tissues via hypoglycemic and anti-oxidative properties. In the present paper,  the effects of fenugreek seed extract was evaluated on testicular tissue of 20 day-old embryos from diabetic rats. Methods: In the present experimental study, sixty normal female rats were divided into three normal groups: non-diabetic control, glibenclamide and fenugreek groups and three diabetic groups: diabetic control, glibenclamide treatment and fenugreek treatment groups. Single injection of streptozotocin was used for induction of diabetes in these female rats. After detection of pregnancy, 1000 mg/kg fenugreek seed extract was fed to non-diabetic and diabetic fenugreek groups and 5 mg/kg glibenclamide was fed to non-diabetic and diabetic glibenclamide groups. Non-diabetic and diabetic control group was fed with distilled water as the same volume as the <b>fenugreek</b> <b>extract.</b> After 20 days, their embryos were pulled out and fixed at 10 % formalin. After tissue processing, five micron sections were stained with Hematoxylin- eosin and evaluated for morphometric changes of testicular tissue. Data were evaluated with One-Way ANOVA test and Duncan post-hoc test. Results: The mean diameter of seminiferous tubules and testis capsule thickness indicated no significant differences between fenugreek treatment and diabetic control groups (P> 0. 05). Mean body weight of male embryos was significantly lower in fenugreek treatment group in comparison with the diabetic control group (P&le 0. 05). The leydig, sertoli and spermatogonial cells number was significantly higher in fenugreek treatment group in compression with diabetic control group                      (P&le 0. 05). Conclusion: The present study showed that the hydroalcoholic extract of fenugreek seeds may increase leydig, sertoli and spermatogonial cells number in testis of diabetic rats...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to assess in vitro antifungal activity of diploid and mixoploid Trigonella foenum-graecum L. aqueous extracts, harvested at three developmental stages (vegetative, flowering and fruiting) against Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. radicis-lycopersici (FORL) and Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici (FOL). All tested extracts inhibited FORL and FOL mycelial growth. The aqueous extracts of diploid plants were shown to be less toxic than mixoploid ones. FORL seemed to be more sensitive to <b>fenugreek</b> <b>extracts</b> compared to FOL and this toxicity varied with the plant developmental stages. The mixoploids were most toxic against the two pathogens at the flowering stage. Diploids were more toxic at vegetative stage for FOL and at flowering one for FORL. The total phenolics, flavonoids, flavonols and flavones, alkaloids and proanthocyanidins contents in the aqueous extracts were higher in vegetative stage in comparison with the two others. Knowing the plant development stage that gives the richest material would counteract the difficulties of the allelochemical production in very small quantities. Moreover, it seems that mixoploidy induction is an effective tool, to increase the secondary metabolite production, since extract toxicity of diploid and mixoploid plants was different...|$|R
40|$|Trigonella foenum graecum {{commonly}} known as Fenugreek exerts normoglycemic and insu-linotropic effects in humans by compounds from its seed and leaf extracts. Some studies re-ported that treating pregnant mice with fenugreek seed could cause toxic effects on the nerv-ous system of its pubs during developmental growth, while in some other studies neuroprotec-tive properties were considered for it. Safety of anti-diabetic drugs for nervous system is very important because peripheral neuropathy is a common complication of diabetes and hazard-ous drugs could worsen it. In this study, the effect of treatment with <b>fenugreek</b> seed <b>extract</b> on the function of sciatic nerves of neuropathic mice was evaluated. Neuropathy was induced in male mice by pyridoxine intoxication.

40|$|Fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum L. seed) is a {{food with}} {{traditional}} medicinal use in diabetes. Beneficial effects {{have been demonstrated}} in diabetic animals and both insulin-dependent and non-insulin-dependent diabetic subjects. Effects of a lipid extract A, crude ethanolic extract B, further sub-fractions of B (saponin-free C, saponin D and sapogenin E) and a gum fibre fraction F on intestinal sodium-dependent glucose uptake were investigated in vitro using rabbit intestinal brush border membrane vesicles. All fractions except A inhibited glucose-uptake at 0. 33 and/or 3. 3 mg/mL (p < 0. 001). Greatest inhibition was observed with fractions D and E. Diosgenin and trigonelline (compounds reported in fenugreek) also inhibited glucose-uptake (50 C values approximately 3 mg/ ml, equivalent to 8 mM and 19 mM respectively) but did {{not account for the}} activity of the crude <b>extracts.</b> <b>Fenugreek</b> <b>extracts</b> had no effect on basal levels of glycogen phosphorylase a (HGPa) activity in rat hepatocyte suspensions. However fractions C and E caused a marginal but statistically significant inhibition (18. 9 and 15. 1 % respectively, p < 0. 05) of glucagon induction of this enzyme suggesting a glucagon-antagonist effect. Diosgenin (1. 65 mg/ml; 4 mM) inhibited glucagon-induced HGPa activity by 20 % (p < 0. 05), and was more effective than trigonelline (non significant inhibition of 9. 4 % at 1. 65 mg/ml, 10 mM) ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Korean ginseng (Panax ginseng C. A. Meyer), {{the native}} ginseng of Korea, has {{traditionally}} been widely used {{for thousands of years}} in Korea. Various biological functions of Korean ginseng have been reported. However, there have not been many studies on its effect on andropause. As women reach menopause, they show a sudden decrease in female hormone levels; men also undergo similar endocrinologic changes. Andropause is also referred to as late-onset hypogonadism, male hormone deficiency syndrome, and male climacteric syndrome. It is linked to increasing age among men and serum testosterone deficiency and specific clinical and biochemical symptoms that accompany it. To improve such andropause symptoms, male hormone supplementation therapy has been attempted. However, owing to various adverse effects, the development of improved therapeutic agents that are safe, both psychologically and physically, is in demand. The present study examined the andropause symptom-alleviating effects of black ginseng and <b>fenugreek</b> complex <b>extract</b> to develop a natural therapeutic agent with minimal adverse effects. Methods: In the present study, we measured the anti-oxidant effect of black ginseng and <b>fenugreek</b> complex <b>extracts</b> using Cell viability of TM 3 mouse leydig cells. The mechanism of apoptosis was assessed Erk and Akt kinase activity. We also investigated whether these complex extracts could affect on male hormone and muscle endurance. After administrating black ginseng and <b>fenugreek</b> complex <b>extracts</b> for 4 weeks. The aged rats were sacrificed and checked the testosterone hormone and forced swimming test. Results: The extract increased cell viability, which had been reduced after oxidative stress, confirming the antioxidant effects of the complex, and this effect involved regulation of Erk kinase activation. Moreover, in a hormone-deficient animal model, after oral administration of the complex extract, the group that received 100  mg/kg showed significantly increased total and bioavailable testosterone levels. Besides the levels of sex hormones, those of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone that promote spermatogenesis were also elevated in a forced swimming test for verification of muscle endurance and motor functions, the group that received 100  mg/kg of the complex extract showed improved motor function and increased muscle endurance. Conclusion: Thus, it is believed that the complex extract of black ginseng and fenugreek may be used in the future as a preventive and therapeutic agent for alleviating the symptoms of andropause...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{efficacy}} of aerial parts’ organic extracts of diploid and mixoploid Trigonella foenum-graecum L. plants, harvested at three developmental stages (vegetative, flowering and fruiting) was evaluated for their antifungal activity against Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. radicis-lycopersici (FORL) and F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici (FOL). All tested extracts inhibited FORL and FOL mycelial growth. The organic extracts of diploid plants {{were found to}} be less toxic than mixoploid ones and this toxicity varied with the plant developmental stages. The diploids were most toxic, for the two strains, at the fruiting stage; however, mixoploids were more toxic at the vegetative stage for FOL and at flowering one for FORL. FOL was found to be more sensitive to <b>fenugreek</b> <b>extracts</b> when compared to FORL. LC–MS/MS analysis of methanolic <b>extract</b> of <b>fenugreek</b> aerial parts showed eleven different flavonol glycosides (quercetin, kaempferol and vitexin). Five novel components were identified, {{for the first time in}} fenugreek aerial parts, as kaempferol 3 -O-β-d-glucopyranoside, kaempferol 7 -O-glucoside, kaempferol 3 -O-α-l-rhamnosyl (1 → 2) β-d-xyloside, kaempferol 7 -O-β-d-glucopyranosyl (1 – 4) β-d-glucopyranoside and kaempferol 3 -O-β-glucosyl (1 → 2) (6 ′-O-acetyl) -β-d-galactoside, along with other known compounds of this species. To operate with the maximum efficiency, the allelopathic potential of a given plant, our study showed that it would be advisable to identify the most productive developmental stage of allelochemicals. Similarly, it seems that mixoploidy would be a simple and effective biotechnology tool to improve (in quantity and quality) the allelochemicals’ production, since the extracts’ toxicity of diploid and mixoploid plants, was different...|$|R
