For this reason this work considers interest rate on loans and insolvency rate functions of prosocial behaviour along with the traditional socio-economic and <b>financial</b> <b>collaterals.</b> The context of study is Italy and the analysis is developed at a cross-regional level. We collect data from the two reports on “Relatives and Safety Net” produced by the Italian Centre Bureau of Statistics (ISTAT) in 1998 and 2003 and from the reports on “Regional Economics” produced by the Bank of Italy in the same years. A two-period panel model shows two interesting outcomes. Firstly, regions with a higher proportion of prosocial individuals report lower interest rates on loans and insolvency rates. Secondly, when we include the efficiency of legal enforcement, evidence supports the idea that a more efficient legal framework can act as a more reliable transmission mechanism of institutional norms and facilitate the internalisation of social norms...|$|R

It also stated that those countries that did not allow such a remedy (i.e., the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland) on the Directive's adoption were not obliged to recognize it.

How is this puzzle solved? We find for a representative sample from Northeast Thailand that indeed most loans do not include any tangible assets as collateral. Instead, lenders enforce collateral-free loans through third-party guarantees and relationship lending, but also through modifying loan terms, such as reducing loan size. Guarantees are the relatively most important substitute, they reduce collateral requirements independently of relationship lending and they are more often used by formal financial institutions. lending, <b>financial</b> institutions, <b>collateral,</b> guarantees, relationship lending...|$|R

40|$|I {{analyze the}} {{equilibrium}} level of liquidity and its relevance for {{the allocation of}} credit, when the notion of liquidity is related to private information. The general equilibrium analysis yields the following main implications: firstly, it provides an explanation of procyclical liquidity even {{in the presence of}} security endogeneity; secondly, it illustrates how government debt, by providing liquidity to an otherwise illiquid private market, encourages rather than “crowds out” private investment; thirdly, it offers a well defined notion of securities’ value, the liquidity of which is endogenously enhanced by the arrangements within financial markets. The approach jointly analyzes the three factors crucial to liquidity: (1) its level is endogenously determined through equilibrium pricing while entrepreneurs choose which security to issue; (2) the introduction of government debt has the two-fold effect of directly providing liquidity to entrepreneurs and indirectly influencing the type of securities they issue in equilibrium; (3) financial markets develop arrangements to allow the beneficial employment of securities, not only physical assets, as <b>collateral</b> (<b>financial</b> pyramiding).

40|$|This paper {{suggests}} that non-fundamental component in asset prices {{is one of}} the drivers of financial and credit cycle. Presented model builds on the financial accelerator literature by including a stock market where limitedly-liable investors trade stocks of productive firms with stochastic productivities. Investors borrow funds from the banking sector and can go bankrupt. Their limited liability induces a moral hazard problem which shifts demand for risk and drives prices of risky assets above fundamental value. Embedding the contracting problem in a New Keynesian general equilibrium framework, the model shows that loose monetary policy induces loose credit conditions and leads to a rise in both fundamental and nonfundamental components of stock prices. Positive shock to non-fundamental component triggers a <b>financial</b> cycle: <b>collateral</b> values rise, lending rate and default rate decreases. These effects reverse after several quarters, inducing a credit crunch. The credit boom lasts only while stock market growth maintains sufficient momentum.

40|$|We {{explore the}} role of {{monetary}} policy {{in the aftermath of}} a financial crisis. We develop a small open economy model with limited participation of households in a financial intermediary that provides liquidity to satisfy firms' working capital needs. Firms require two forms of working capital: domestic funds to pay for the wage bill and foreign funds to finance imports of intermediate goods. A shortage of either one of the sources of working capital acts as a drag on economic activity. In normal times, an interest rate cut is expansionary. In a <b>financial</b> crisis, <b>collateral</b> constraints bind and an expansion of domestic liquidity leads to a real exchange rate depreciation that further tightens the collateral constraint and offsets the traditional (expansionary) liquidity channel. In addition, the tightening of the collateral constraint places a premium on paying off foreign debt, reinforcing the contractionary effects of an interest rate cut. We study the conditions under which such monetary policy action is contractionary and relate them to recent emerging market crises. ...|$|R

40|$|Since the {{establishment}} of the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh in 1976, microfinance has boomed. As of December 31, 2007, 3, 552 microcredit institutions had reached 154 million clients worldwide, about 106. 6 million of whom were among the poorest when they took their first loan. Such expansion can be at least partly attributed to the widely adopted practice of group lending in microfinance programs. In contrast to individual lending, group lending (or joint liability) grants a loan to a group of borrowers, and the whole group is liable for the debt of any individual member in the group. This practice allows microfinance programs to rely mainly on accountability and mutual trust among group members rather than <b>financial</b> <b>collateral</b> to insure against default.
