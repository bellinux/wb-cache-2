5|$|Meanwhile, Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) {{asks for}} Andy Bernard's (Ed Helms) help in {{adopting}} a baby, {{as the local}} adoption agency requires a reference letter from an employer. Andy promises to read her application letter, but tells the camera crew he will only sign <b>it</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> admits {{that she is a}} horrible person in it. However, Andy is unaware that Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) is using her own painful past as a non-adopted orphan to help Nellie with the process. When Andy coldly rejects Nellie's letter (which Erin helped her write), Nellie accepts his decision, but Andy is stunned to hear Erin crying sadly over the failure. He finally adds some mildly snarky but complimentary lines to her letter and signs onto it as a reference, leaving Nellie overjoyed.|$|E
5|$|Adams {{did work}} for {{publishers}} other than Marvel during the 1980s, {{as when he}} drew several pages of Batman #400 in 1986 and Action Comics Annual #1 in 1987. The latter {{is viewed as a}} turning point in Adam's drawing style, characterized by bulkier figures of Batman and Superman, though Adams explains that this was in part due to the influence of The Dark Knight Returns, and that the overall change in art was style partly due to deliberate experimentation on his part, and partly to Dick Giordano's inking, which exhibited a different line weight. That same year, he illustrated Gumby Summer Fun Special #1 by Comico Comics, a job he obtained through Comico editor Diana Schutz, an old friend who noticed the incidental images of Gumby that Adams had included in the pages of Longshot. Adams, who did not harbor fond memories of that cartoon as a child, and who feared he would be typecast as a Gumby artist if he took the job, told Schultz he would only do <b>it</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> could get Bob Burden to write it, on the assumption that Schultz would decline this condition. Schultz, who initially wanted Mark Evanier for the job, considered this, and eventually agreed to it after contacting Burden, who was enthusiastic about the idea. That book, which demonstrated Adams' versatility in handling comedy as well as superheroics, garnered him and Burden a 1988 Eisner Award for Best Single Issue. Adams would later illustrate a second Gumby book, Gumby's Winter Fun Special, which was written by Steve Purcell.|$|E

500|$|In 1989, Lindsay Doran, the new {{president}} of production company Mirage Enterprises, was on a company retreat brainstorming potential film ideas when she suggested the Jane Austen novel Sense and Sensibility to her colleagues. It had been adapted three times, most recently in a 1981 television serial. Doran was a longtime fan of the novel, and had vowed in her youth to adapt <b>it</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> ever entered the film industry. She chose to adapt this particular Austen work because there were two female leads. Doran stated that [...] "all of [...] books are funny and emotional, but Sense and Sensibility is the best movie story because it's full of twists and turns. Just when you think you know what's going on, everything is different. It's got real suspense, but it's not a thriller. Irresistible." [...] She also praised the novel for possessing [...] "wonderful characters... three strong love stories, surprising plot twists, good jokes, relevant themes, and a heart-stopping ending." ...|$|E

500|$|Scholastic Corporation {{bought the}} U.S. rights at the Bologna Book Fair in April 1997 for US$105,000, {{an unusually high}} sum for a children's book. They thought that a child {{would not want to}} read a book with the word [...] "philosopher" [...] in the title and, after some discussion, the American edition was {{published}} in September 1998 under the title Rowling suggested, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. Rowling claimed that she regretted this change and would have fought <b>it</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had been in a stronger position at the time. Philip Nel has pointed out that the change lost the connection with alchemy, and the meaning of some other terms changed in translation, for example from [...] "crumpet" [...] to [...] "muffin". While Rowling accepted the change from both the British English [...] "mum" [...] and Seamus Finnigan's Irish variant [...] "mam" [...] to [...] "mom" [...] in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, she vetoed this change in the later books, which was then reversed in later editions of Philosopher's Stone. However, Nel considered that Scholastic's translations were considerably more sensitive than most of those imposed on British English books of the time, and that some other changes could be regarded as useful copyedits. Since the British editions of early titles in the series were published months prior to the American versions, some American readers became familiar with the British English versions due to buying them from online retailers.|$|E

500|$|In a joint {{statement}} released on July 15, 2015, the inspector general of the State Department and the inspector general {{of the intelligence community}} said that their review of the emails found information that was classified when sent, remained so {{at the time of their}} inspection and [...] "never should have been transmitted via an unclassified personal system." [...] They also stated unequivocally that this classified information should never have been stored outside of secure government computer systems. Clinton had said over a period of months that she kept no classified information on the private server that she set up in her house. Government policy, reiterated in the nondisclosure agreement signed by Clinton as part of gaining her security clearance, is that sensitive information can be considered as classified even if not marked as such. After allegations were raised that some of the emails in question fell into the so-called [...] "born classified" [...] category, an FBI probe was initiated regarding how classified information was handled on the Clinton server. The New York Times reported in February 2016 that nearly 2,100 emails stored on Clinton's server were retroactively marked classified by the State Department. Additionally, the intelligence community's inspector general wrote Congress to say that some of the emails [...] "contained classified State Department information when originated." [...] In May 2016, the inspector general of the State Department criticized her use of a private email server while secretary of state, stating that she had not requested permission for this and would not have received <b>it</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had asked.|$|E

"Empire State of Mind" [...] {{was first}} {{performed}} at Jay-Z's [...] "Answer the Call" [...] benefit concert in Madison Square Garden on September 11, 2009, {{where it was}} the opening song. All ticket proceeds from the show went to the New York Police and Fire Widows and Children's Fund. The song was then performed live at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards (MTV VMA) on September 13, 2009, where it closed the awards show. The VMA performance {{was the first time}} Jay-Z and Keys performed the song together. Shaheem Redi of MTV News commented on the performance that, [...] "Their set was elegant and 'hood at the same time, and it was such a powerful moment". Ryan Brockington of the New York Post wrote [...] "Alicia's buttery voice and Jay-Z's impeccable stage presence made for an audio adrenaline overload" [...] and placed the performance third on his list of the [...] "top six performances" [...] from the MTV VMAs. For the performance Jay-Z wore his signature Yankees cap and Keys wore all black while playing the piano. During the MTV VMA performance images of locations in New York, such as the Empire State Building and the Apollo Theatre, were shown on an overhead screen behind Jay-Z and Keys. Towards the end of the performance rapper Lil' Mama got up onto the stage uninvited and posed with Jay-Z and Keys while they were finishing the final verse of the track. Lil' Mama said she did not mean to disrespect either performer but the song had her [...] "emotions running high", adding that [...] "in that moment I came up onstage to celebrate my two icons singing about NY."

It was intended to empower people by making them realize that their environment was a consequence of their collective behavior (and vice versa). Moreover, she avoided the merely pretty in favor of what she described as [...] "fantastic" [...] contrasts between {{the old and the}} new, and chose her camera angles and lenses to create compositions that either stabilized a subject (if she approved of it), or destabilized <b>it</b> (<b>if</b> <b>she</b> scorned it).|$|E

But though Sumner wrote her that what she had done was [...] "worth a whole phalanx in the cause of human freedom," [...] again she received but little pecuniary compensation. While the war lasted, however, she translated many French books calculated to rouse patriotic feeling, and was, at one time, summoned to Washington to write for the men whose work for their country she considered it a privilege to help, receiving only her board at a hotel.
