30|$|This paper {{presented}} {{a set of}} novel modifications {{that can be applied}} to any grid-based path-planning algorithm from the A* family used in mobile robotics. It used five modifications on A* to plan the robot’s path: the obstacle distance, slack, <b>direction,</b> <b>processing</b> time and target orientation. Some simulations were made using a crowded and highly dynamic environment with twelve randomly moving obstacles. While the normal A* algorithm built an entire path around the obstacle, the modified A* built a path making changes only when the robot was approaching the obstacle. Here, the normal A* algorithm had to go back many times to succeed in reaching the goal point. The modified algorithm built a different path, changing it by predicting the collision points using the calculated spheres’ velocity and applying all the mentioned changes. The improvement achieved by the modified A* algorithm was much more considerable, {{not only in terms of}} getting to the goal point sooner, but also in terms of avoiding much more collisions in a crowded environment.|$|E
40|$|Accurate {{estimation}} of the Direction of Arrival (DOA) of a sound source is an important prerequisite {{for a wide range}} of acoustic sig- nal processing applications. However, in enclosed environments, early reflections and late reverberation often lead to localization er- rors. Recent work demonstrated that improved robustness against reverberation can be achieved by clustering only the DOAs from direct-path bins in the short-term Fourier transform of a speech sig- nal of several seconds duration from a static talker. Nevertheless, for moving talkers, short blocks of at most several hundred milliseconds are required to capture the spatio-temporal variation of the source <b>direction.</b> <b>Processing</b> of short blocks of data in reverberant envi- ronment can lead to clusters whose centroids correspond to spuri- ous DOAs away from the source direction. We therefore propose in this paper a novel multi-detection source tracking approach that es- timates the smoothed trajectory of the source DOAs. Results for re- alistic room simulations validate the proposed approach and demon- strate significant improvements in estimation accuracy compared to single-detection tracking...|$|E

40|$|Congenital amusia is {{a lifelong}} {{disorder}} of musical processing for which no effective treatments have been found. The present study aimed to treat amusics’ impairments in pitch direction identification through auditory training. Prior to training, twenty Chinese-speaking amusics and 20 matched controls were tested on the Montreal Battery of Evaluation of Amusia (MBEA) and two psychophysical pitch threshold tasks for identification of pitch direction in speech and music. Subsequently, ten of the twenty amusics undertook 10 sessions of adaptive-tracking pitch direction training, while the remaining 10 received no training. Post training, all amusics were re-tested on the pitch threshold tasks and on the three pitch-based MBEA subtests. Compared with those untrained, trained amusics demonstrated significantly improved thresholds for pitch direction identification in both speech and music, {{to the level of}} non-amusic control participants, although no significant difference was observed between trained and untrained amusics in the MBEA subtests. This provides the first clear positive evidence for improvement in pitch <b>direction</b> <b>processing</b> through auditory training in amusia.

40|$|Event-related {{potentials}} {{were recorded}} from adults and 4 -month-old infants while they watched pictures of faces that varied in emotional expression (happy and fearful) and in gaze direction (direct or averted). Results indicate that emotional expression is temporally independent of gaze <b>direction</b> <b>processing</b> at {{early stages of}} processing, and only become integrated at later latencies. Facial expressions affected the face-sensitive ERP components in both adults (N 170) and infants (N 290 and P 400), while gaze direction and the interaction between facial expression and gaze affected the posterior channels in adults and the frontocentral channels in infants. Specifically, in adults, this interaction reflected a greater responsiveness to fearful expressions with averted gaze (avoidance-oriented emotion), and to happy faces with direct gaze (approach-oriented emotions). In infants, a larger activation to a happy expression at the frontocentral negative component (Nc) was found, and planned comparisons showed that {{it was due to}} the direct gaze condition. Taken together, these results support the shared signal hypothesis in adults, but only to a lesser extent in infants, suggesting that experience could play an important role. © The Author(s) 2009.

At the top of the hierarchy of all sensory pathways, in cerebral cortex, the information about the sound direction is integrated together with other sound qualities to yield an unified percept. The succession of names of anatomical structures of the pathway is: from cochlear nuclei (CN), through medial and lateral superior olive (MSO and LSO), inferior coliculus (IC), medial geniculate nucleus (MGN) and finally primary (A 1) and some auxiliary (CM, caudomedial area, in macaque) auditory cortical areas. At the Neural Coding Workshop in the 1999, we have shown nonlinear aspects of sound <b>direction</b> <b>processing</b> at one lower stage, represented by the MSO in mammals, [3].

40|$|AbstractRandom dot motion (RDM) {{displays}} {{have emerged}} as one of the standard stimulus types employed in psychophysical and physiological studies of motion processing. RDMs are convenient because it is straightforward to manipulate the relative motion energy for a given motion direction in addition to stimulus parameters such as the speed, contrast, duration, density, aperture, etc. However, as widely as RDMs are employed so do they vary in their details of implementation. As a result, it is often difficult to make direct comparisons across studies employing different RDM algorithms and parameters. Here, we systematically measure the ability of human subjects to estimate motion direction for four commonly used RDM algorithms under a range of parameters in order to understand how these different algorithms compare in their perceptibility. We find that parametric and algorithmic differences can produce dramatically different performances. These effects, while surprising, can be understood in relationship to pertinent neurophysiological data regarding spatiotemporal displacement tuning properties of cells in area MT and how the tuning function changes with stimulus contrast and retinal eccentricity. These data help give a baseline by which different RDM algorithms can be compared, demonstrate a need for clearly reporting RDM details in the methods of papers, and also pose new constraints and challenges to models of motion <b>direction</b> <b>processing...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{principal}} goal of {{time series}} prediction is {{the enhancement of}} prediction accuracy. To achieve this goal, most previous investigations have adopted the so-called uni-directional computation style, focusing only on the forward-time direction (present! future). This paper adopts a diãerent approach, the bi-directional computation style, and applies it to real-time series prediction tasks. The objective of this style {{is to improve the}} accuracy of time series prediction by means of interaction between the forward-time <b>direction</b> <b>processing</b> system, which only predicts the future, and a separate backward-time processing system. Good results have previously been obtained on sunspot data, but since these involve time series that are short, there has been insuécient investigation of generalization performance. We therefore apply the proposed technique to diãerent time series data in order to investigate further the generalization performance with untraining data. The time series data called Set D &quot; used here were artiåcially generated by a computer and are distinguished by their great length, consisting of 100, 000 points. Computer simulations indicate that on average, an improvement in dealing with untraining data equal to that for training data is achievable. In addition, better prediction accuracy is achieved in areas where the conventional method is weak.

40|$|AbstractThe {{cognition}} of nonverbal {{sounds in}} dementia {{has been relatively}} little explored. Here we undertook a systematic study of nonverbal sound processing in patient groups with canonical dementia syndromes comprising clinically diagnosed typical amnestic Alzheimer's disease (AD; n= 21), progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA; n= 5), logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA; n= 7) and aphasia in association with a progranulin gene mutation (GAA; n= 1), and in healthy age-matched controls (n= 20). Based on a cognitive framework treating complex sounds as ‘auditory objects’, we designed a novel neuropsychological battery to probe auditory object cognition at early perceptual (sub-object), object representational (apperceptive) and semantic levels. All patients had assessments of peripheral hearing and general neuropsychological functions {{in addition to the}} experimental auditory battery. While a number of aspects of auditory object analysis were impaired across patient groups and were influenced by general executive (working memory) capacity, certain auditory deficits had some specificity for particular dementia syndromes. Patients with AD had a disproportionate deficit of auditory apperception but preserved timbre processing. Patients with PNFA had salient deficits of timbre and auditory semantic processing, but intact auditory size and apperceptive processing. Patients with LPA had a generalised auditory deficit that was influenced by working memory function. In contrast, the patient with GAA showed substantial preservation of auditory function, but a mild deficit of pitch <b>direction</b> <b>processing</b> and a more severe deficit of auditory apperception. The findings provide evidence for separable stages of auditory object analysis and separable profiles of impaired auditory object cognition in different dementia syndromes...|$|E

40|$|Rich {{behavioral}} {{evidence indicates}} that the brain estimates the visual direction and acceleration of gravity quite accurately, and the underlying mechanisms have begun to be unraveled. While the neuroanatomical substrates of gravity <b>direction</b> <b>processing</b> have been studied extensively in brain-damaged patients, to our knowledge no such study exists for the processing of visual gravitational motion. Here we asked 31 stroke patients to intercept a virtual ball moving along the vertical under either natural gravity or artificial reversed gravity. Twenty-seven of them also aligned a luminous bar to the vertical direction (subjective visual vertical, SVV). Using voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping as well as lesion subtraction analysis, we found that lesions mainly centered on the posterior insula are associated with greater deviations of SVV, consistent with several previous studies. Instead, lesions mainly centered on the parietal operculum decrease the ability to discriminate natural from unnatural gravitational acceleration with a timed motor response in the interception task. Both the posterior insula and the parietal operculum belong to the vestibular cortex, and presumably receive multisensory information about the gravity vector. We speculate that an internal model estimating the effects of gravity on visual objects is constructed by transforming the vestibular estimates of mechanical gravity, which are computed in the brainstem and cerebellum, into internalized estimates of virtual gravity, which are stored in the cortical vestibular network. The present lesion data suggest a specific role for the parietal operculum in detecting the mismatch between predictive signals from the internal model and the online visual signals...|$|E
40|$|Rodents {{have always}} been a popular model in {{psychological}} research to study various phenomena such as memory and spatial navigation. In addition, more than 100 years ago there were already attempts to investigate the visual capabilities, a topic which is recently experiencing renewed interest from the research community. Although it is well established that rodents can perform a variety of pattern discrimination tasks, much less is known about the constituent features they employ in solving these tasks. To that end, we performed a series of studies to establish more firmly what kind of visual information they can and cannot use. First, physiological evidence shows that the visual system of rodents is tuned for orientation and motion <b>direction</b> <b>processing.</b> We designed a task in which animals had to use one of these features. This was combined with an analysis of zif 268 expression levels to investigate the underlying neural mechanisms. Second, we performed studies in rats and mice to investigate to what extent they are capable of figure-ground segregation. In the mice study, electrophysiological measurements were further obtained to gain further insight into the neural mechanisms underlying task performance. Third, we compared human and rat performance in a task for which the solution, conceptualized as a stimulus representation that is linearly separable, had a straightforward linear dependence on the stimulus or required a non-linear transformation. In a final experiment, we succeeded in adapting the prototype task to rodents. This is an important task in human literature, and with this we open the possibility to also study higher-order processes such as categorization specifically in this species. The potential applications of these results are two-fold: first, even studies that do not investigate the visual system specifically do rely on stimulus material that is implicitly assumed to be processed by the system (e. g., the visual cues in a Morris Water Maze). Knowledge about the capabilities and limitations of the system might aid in designing optimal stimuli for these experiments. Second: rodents can provide a more tractable animal model in which specific aspects of visual information processing, such as figure-ground segregation or invariant object recognition), can be studied. nrpages: 195 status: publishe...|$|E
