A references committee will conduct inquiries into policy issues referred to it by the Senate. Each of these inquiries will usually result in a report tabled in the Senate (there may be exceptions if an election intervenes during the committee's deliberations). A consolidated list of the reports prepared by all Senate committees since 1970 is published by the Department of the Senate.|$|E

5000|$|Since a cost <b>estimate</b> is the {{approximation}} {{of the cost}} of a project or operation, then <b>estimate</b> accuracy is a measure of how closely the <b>estimate</b> is able to predict the actual expenditures for the project or operation. This can only be known after the project is completed. If, for example, a project <b>estimate</b> was $1,252,000 for a specific scope and conditions, and at completion the records showed that $1,172,451.26 was expended, the <b>estimate</b> was 6.8% too high. If the project ended up having a different scope or conditions, an unadjusted computation does not fairly assess the <b>estimate</b> accuracy. Predictions of the <b>estimate</b> accuracy may accompany the <b>estimate.</b> Typically this is expressed as a range higher or lower as compared with the point <b>estimate</b> with an expected probability that the actual cost will fall in the range. [...] An example for a definitive <b>estimate</b> might be that the <b>estimate</b> has a -5/+10% range of accuracy with a 90% confidence that the final value will fall in that range. The accuracy of an early <b>estimate</b> relates to the <b>estimate</b> quality. Factors affecting the quality of the <b>estimate</b> include the people who prepared the <b>estimate,</b> how the <b>estimate</b> was prepared, and what was known about the project. For the same project, the range of uncertainty about the total <b>estimate</b> decreases over time, as illustrated in the cone of uncertainty diagram.|$|R

40|$|AbstractDuring {{environment}} testing, {{the estimation}} of random vibration signals (RVS) is an important technique for the airborne platform safety and reliability. However, the available methods including extreme value envelope method (EVEM), statistical tolerances method (STM) and improved statistical tolerance method (ISTM) require large samples and typical probability distribution. Moreover, the frequency-varying characteristic of RVS is usually not taken into account. Gray bootstrap method (GBM) is proposed {{to solve the problem}} of <b>estimating</b> frequency-varying RVS with small samples. Firstly, the <b>estimated</b> indexes are obtained including the <b>estimated</b> interval, the <b>estimated</b> uncertainty, the <b>estimated</b> value, the <b>estimated</b> error and <b>estimated</b> reliability. In addition, GBM is applied to <b>estimating</b> the single flight testing of certain aircraft. At last, in order to evaluate the <b>estimated</b> performance, GBM is compared with bootstrap method (BM) and gray method (GM) in testing analysis. The result shows that GBM has superiority for <b>estimating</b> dynamic signals with small samples and <b>estimated</b> reliability is proved to be 100 % at the given confidence level...|$|R
