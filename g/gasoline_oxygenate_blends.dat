Although MTBE was banned from use as a fuel additive in 2006, it has been detected in public drinking water in several states {{throughout the country and}} elsewhere in the world. Now the EPA must regulate MTBE contamination in ground and surface waters. Although the health risk of human exposure to low doses of MTBE is unknown, long-term rodent cancer bioassays using high concentrations of MTBE increases the incidence of tumors at various organ sites. The two studies presented in this thesis are {{the latest in a series}} of experiments at this university designed to better understand how MTBE causes an increase in endocrine-related tumors. The research from the first experiment reported here focuses on the incorporation of more standardized measures of generalized toxicity (e. g., stress response) that are very important for understanding the MTBE-related endocrinological changes in relation to the broader toxicological perspective. Previous studies also demonstrate MTBE-induced renal damage in the proximal tubules of male rats through interaction with [lower case alpha]- 2 u-globulin. A second study explores the use of novel urinary proteins as biomarkers of renal damage induced by MTBE exposure. In the first experiment (n= 16) Sprague-Dawley male rats were gavaged with 0 (corn oil), 600 or 1200 mg/kg MTBE per day for 14 consecutive days. In the second experiment (n= 5) Sprague-Dawley male rats were gavaged with 0 (corn oil) or 1200 mg/kg MTBE per day for 14 consecutive days. Serum corticosterone concentrations were measured in the first study and showed a significant increase (p< 0. 05) in the 1200 mg/kg MTBE treated group. Hepatorenal serum chemistry was measured in both studies and revealed no differences between treated and control animals. However, in the second study two of the six urinary protein concentrations ([lower case beta]- 2 -microglobulin and cystatin C) displayed significant increases (p< 0. 05) in the 1200 mg/kg MTBE treated group relative to the control group. Therefore, urinary protein concentrations proved to be more sensitive biomarkers of renal changes than conventional serum chemistry (BUN and creatinine) following subchronic high dose oral MTBE exposure. Although MTBE induced endocrine change has been the focus of previous experiments, the two current studies reveal other exposure related systemic changes that could also affect alteration in endocrine function...|$|R

The other <b>gasoline</b> <b>oxygenates</b> in this study include di-isopropyl ether (DIPE), ethyl tertiary butyl ether (ETBE), tertiary amyl methyl ether (TAME), and tertiary butyl alcohol (TBA). Corre-lation coefficients were calculated between MTBE and other ox-ygenates, and between the <b>gasoline</b> <b>oxygenates</b> and depth to groundwater and geological material type of aquifer. The corre-lation coefficients indicated poor correlation among all compo-nents mentioned. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare MTBE concentrations detected in aquifers comprised chiefly of coarse-grained material with those comprised of fine-grained material. The ANOVA results indicated that the differ-ence is not statistically significant between MTBE detected in the two types of aquifer materials. Similar results were also reached for TBA. The oxygenate concentration distributions were further studied by grouping the data according to different gasoline brands. There is not an overall statistically clear trend on whether certain brands of gasoline contain MTBE and TBA consistently higher than other brands, or whether TBA is consis-tently higher than MTBE among all brands of gasoline. How-ever, TBA shows statistically higher than MTBE in the mean, the median, and the 95 th percentile in the overall groundwater data studied. Therefore, further studies on the relationship be-tween MTBE and TBA are warranted...|$|R
30|$|Combustion {{of fossil}} fuel {{is what we}} think of as burning {{processes}} basically a reaction with oxygen. Fossil fuels are composed primarily of hydrocarbons. The amount of energy released during combustion is dependent on the oxidation state of the carbons in the hydrocarbon which is related to the hydrogen/carbon (H/C) ratio. The more hydrogen per carbon, the lower the oxidation state and the more energy that will be released during the oxidation reaction. The presence of oxygenates in fuels reduces the amount of carbon monoxide and unburned fuel in the exhaust gas. <b>Oxygenate</b> <b>blending</b> is basically the addition of oxygen-bearing compounds such as methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE), and ethanol to gasoline/diesel. Throughout the USA, <b>oxygenate</b> <b>blending</b> is mandated by EPA regulations to reduce smog and other airborne pollutants. For example, in Southern California, a fuel must contain 2  % oxygen by weight, resulting in a mixture of 5.6  % ethanol in gasoline (Removal of reformulated gasoline oxygen content requirement (national) and revision of commingling prohibition to address non-oxygenated reformulated gasoline (national), 2006). The resulting fuel is often known as reformulated <b>gasoline</b> (RFG) or <b>oxygenated</b> <b>gasoline.</b> Ethanol-blended fuel has been a great success in Brazil where ethanol is being used as a primary fuel for several decades; E- 85 to E- 100 are the most common in them. Several countries in the European Union also use ethanol-blended gasoline due to environmental consideration. In India, the government has mandated up to 5  % ethanol for metro cities, recently for all over the country, and has a plan to extend it up to 10  % in the future (Government to take a call on ethanol price soon, 2011). Thus, in the case of a blended fuel (oxy-diesel, reformulated gasoline), in addition to the H/C ratio, the O/C ratio would be a parameter of interest (Sarpal et al. 1997).|$|R

40|$|The {{large-scale}} {{use of the}} <b>gasoline</b> <b>oxygenate</b> methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) {{has resulted}} in its detection in ground water and surface water in many places throughout the United States. Studies by researchers, industry, water utilities, and local environmental agencies have discovered high concentrations of MTBE in soils and ground water at leaking underground gasoline-storage-tank sites and frequent occurrence of low to intermediate concentrations of MTBE in some reservoirs used for public water supply and recreational boating. In response to these findings, the American Water Works Association Research Foundation sponsored an investigation of MTBE and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the Nation’s sources of drinking water. The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California {{in collaboration with the}} U. S. Geological Survey and the Oregon Health & Science University completed an investigation to determine the frequency of occurrence, concentration, and distribution of MTBE and 3 other ether <b>gasoline</b> <b>oxygenates,</b> their degradation products, and 62 other VOCs in source waters used by community water systems (CWSs) in the United States. All water samples in the investigation were collected prior to treatment and distribution to the public. U. S. Environmental Protection Agency approved Method 524. 2 was used for VOC analyses.

40|$|In {{the early}} 1990 s, <b>oxygenated</b> <b>gasoline</b> {{was hailed as}} a partial {{solution}} to the nation’s air quality problems. Although the large-scale use of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) as a <b>gasoline</b> <b>oxygenate</b> successfully improved air quality, it adversely impacted water quality and dramatically exposed leaking underground storage tanks. However, removing MTBE from gasoline could impose significant societal costs—in terms of both gasoline production costs and prices and possible air and water quality impacts. The analysis conducted for this report {{is based on a}} comprehensive and internally consistent cost-benefit framework and includes several cost categories largely neglected in prior MTBE analyses, including: (1) the cost to taxpayers of increased ethanol consumption; (2) increases in the cost of oil imports; (3) the effects of changes in gasoline prices on gasoline consumption and thus on automobile emissions; and (4) the potential effect of MTBE substitutes on water quality...|$|R

[...] In 2017, Texas surpassed California in gasoline consumption, despite California having 6 million more vehicles. [...] Most California motorists {{are required to}} use a special motor gasoline blend called California Clean Burning Gasoline (CA CBG). By 2004, California completed a transition from methyl tertiary butyl-ether (MTBE) to ethanol as a <b>gasoline</b> <b>oxygenate</b> additive, making California the largest ethanol fuel market in the United States. There are four ethanol production plants in central and southern California, but most of California’s ethanol supply is transported from other states or abroad.|$|R
40|$|<b>Gasoline</b> <b>oxygenates</b> (MTBE, methyl tert-butyl ether; DIPE, di-isopropyl ether; ETBE, ethyl tert-butyl ether; TAME, tert-amyl ether) {{are added}} to {{gasoline}} to boost octane and enhance combustion. The combination of large scale use, high water solubility and only minor biodegradability has now resulted in a significant <b>gasoline</b> <b>oxygenate</b> contamination occurring in surface, ground, and drinking water systems. Combination of hydroxyl radical formation and the pyrolytic environment generated by ultrasonic irradiation (665 kHz) leads to the rapid degradation of MTBE and other <b>gasoline</b> <b>oxygenates</b> in aqueous media. ^ The presence of oxygen promotes the degradation processes by rapid reaction with carbon centered radicals indicating radical processes involving O 2 are significant pathways. A number of the oxidation products were identified. The formation of products (alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, esters, peroxides, etc) could be rationalized by mechanisms which involve hydrogen abstraction by OH radical and/or pyrolysis to form carboncentered radicals which react with oxygen and follow standard oxidation chain processes. ^ The reactions of N-substituted R-triazolinediones (RTAD; R = CH 3 or phenyl) have attracted considerable interest because they exhibit a number of unusual mechanistic characteristics that are analogous to the reactions of singlet oxygen (1 O 2) and offer {{an easy way to}} provide C-N bond(s) formation. The reactions of triazolinedione with olefins have been widely studied and aziridinium imides are generally accepted to be the reactive intermediates. ^ We observed the rapid formation of an unusual intermediate upon mixing tetracyclopropylethylene with 4 -methyl- 1, 2, 4 -triazoline- 3, 5 -dione in CDCl 3. Detailed characterization by NMR (proton, 13 C, 2 -D NMRs) indicates the intermediate is 5, 5, 6, 6 -tetracyclopropyl- 3 -methyl- 5, 6 -dihydro-oxazolo[3, 2 - b][1, 2, 4]-triazolium- 2 -olate. Such products are extremely rare and have not been studied. Upon warming the intermediate is converted to 2 + 2 diazetidine (major) and ene product (minor). ^ To further explore the kinetics and dynamics of the reaction activation energies were obtained using Arrhenius plots. Activation energies for the formation of the intermediate from reactants, and 2 + 2 adduct from the intermediate were determined as 7. 48 kcal moll and 19. 8 kcal mol− 1 with their pre-exponential values of 2. 24 × 105 dm 3 mol− 1 sec− 1 and 2. 75 × 108 sec− 1, respectively, meaning net slow reactions because of low pre-exponential values caused by steric hindrance. ...|$|R

This study investigates the role of fuel-borne oxygen on engine performance and exhaust emissions with a special emphasis on diesel particulate and nitric oxide (NO) emissions. A number of oxygenated-blends were prepared with waste cooking biodiesel as a base oxygenated fuel. Triacetin, a derivative from transesterified biodiesel was chosen for its high oxygen content and superior fuel properties. The experimental campaign was conducted with a 6 -cylinder, common rail turbocharged diesel engine equipped with highly precise instruments for nano and other size particles and other emissions. All experiments were performed in accordance with European Stationary Cycle (ESC 13 -mode). A commercial diesel was chosen as a reference fuel with 0 % oxygen and five other <b>oxygenated</b> <b>blends</b> having a range of 6. 02 – 14. 2 % oxygen were prepared. The experimental results revealed that the <b>oxygenated</b> <b>blends</b> having higher a percentage of fuel-borne oxygen reduced particulate matter (PM), particle number (PN), unburned hydrocarbon (UBHC) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions to a significantly low level with a slight penalty of NO emissions. The main target {{of this study was}} to effectively utilise triacetin as an additive for waste cooking biodiesel and suppress emissions without deteriorating engine performance. The key finding of this investigation is the significant reductions in both particle mass and number emissions simultaneously without worsening engine performance with triacetin-biodiesel blends.

Also in 2010 Mexican government has programmed to start the substitution of Tier 1 - the adopted US emission standards - by Tier 2, which are more stringent emission standards for motor vehicles and gasoline sulfur control requirements. How will the air emissions in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA) be modified by using this blending? Four scenarios up to year 2030 were constructed and simulated using the Long-Range Energy Alternatives Planning model. Beginning with a BAU or reference scenario, in this scenario the current available fuel is a blending composed by 5 % methyl tertiary butyl ether and 95 % gasoline (MTBE 5). Then, three alternative scenarios that use ethanol as an oxygenate are considered, one with the already programmed E 6 blending (6 % anhydride ethanol, 94 % gasoline), {{for the sake of}} comparison the E 10 blending (10 % anhydride ethanol, 90 % gasoline), and the other alternative to compare, ETBE 13. 7 (13. 7 % ethyl tertiary butyl ether, 86. 3 % gasoline; where ETBE is an ether composed by 48 % anhydride ethanol and 52 % isobutene). Emissions of carbon dioxide (CO 2), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM 10), sulfur dioxide (SO 2), total hydrocarbons (THC), benzene, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and 1, 3 -butadiene were calculated using emission factors previously calculated using the adapted US-EPA computer model called MOBILE 6 -Mexico.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to assess the effect of oxygenated hydrocarbons on the knocking characteristics of an engine when blended with low-leaded gasoline. Alcohols, ethers, esters and ketones were tested individually and in various combinations up to an oxygen content of 4 % wt/wt in a blend with Series F- 7 gasoline of 90, 92, 94 and 96 RON. Tests were carried out at wide open throttle, constant speed and standard timing setting. Engine speed was varied using a dynamometer and knock was detected by two piezoelectric transducers, one on the cylinder head monitoring all four cylinders and one monitoring the cylinder most prone to knock. The engine speeds associated with trace and light knock of a continuous nature were noted. Curves were produced for each <b>oxygenate</b> <b>blend</b> of base RON used against engine speed for the two knock conditions which were compared with those produced using pure Series F- 7 fuels. From this a suggested RON of the blend was derived. RON increase was less when using a higher RON base fuel in the <b>blend.</b> Most individual <b>oxygenates</b> showed similar effects in similar concentrations when their oxygen content was comparable. Blends containing more than one oxygenate showed some variation with methanol/MTBE/ 3 methylbutan- 2 -one and methanol/MTBE/ 4 methyl pentan- 2 -one knocking less than expected and methanol/MTBE/TBA also showing good knock resistance. Further tests to optimise initial findings suggested a blend of methanol and MTBE to be superior although partial replacement of MTBE by 4 methyl pentan- 2 -one resulted in a fuel of comparable performance. Exhaust emissions were tested for a number of <b>oxygenated</b> <b>blends</b> in 2 -star gasoline. 2 -star and 4 -star fuels were also tested for reference. All <b>oxygenate</b> <b>blends</b> reduced carbon monoxide emissions as expected and hydrocarbon emissions were also reduced. The largest reduction in carbon monoxide occurred using a 14. 5 % (1 : 1 : 1) methanol/MTBE/ 4 methyl pentan- 2 -one blend. Hydrocarbon emissions were most markedly reduced by a blend containing 25. 5 % 4 methyl pentan- 2 -one. Power output was tested for the blends and indicated a maximum increase of about 5 % at low engine speeds. The most advantageous blends were methanol/ 4 methyl pentan- 2 -one (6 : 5) 11 % in 2 -star and methanol/MTBE/ 4 methyl pentan- 2 -one (6 : 3 : 2) 11 % in 2 -star. In conclusion methanol/MTBE (6 : 5) and (5 : 5), and various combinations of methanol/MTBE/ 4 methyl pentan- 2 -one, notably (6 : 3 : 2) gave good results in all tests conducted.

Recently, several authors have reported the potential for acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) to tertiary-butyl alcohol (TBA) in environmental groundwater samples (O’Reilly et al. 2001; Pirkle and McLoughlin 2002), a process which could further compromise the validity of oxygenate analytical results.

Total unburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, methane, hexane, ethylene, acetaldehyde, acetone, 2 -propanol, benzene, toluene, 1, 3 -butadiene, acetic acid, and MTBE were measured at each engine operating condition. As concerns the total HC emissions, the use of MTBE was beneficial from 1. 90 to 3. 81 HP, which were by far the most polluting conditions. Moreover, CO emissions in tailpipe exhaust were decreased in the whole operation range with increasing MTBE in the fuel. The greatest advantage of MTBE addition to gasoline was the decrease in ethylene, acetaldehyde, benzene, toluene, and acetic acid emissions in engine exhaust, especially when MTBE content in the fuel was increased to 11 % w/w. In tailpipe exhaust, the catalyst operation diminished the observed differences. Ethylene, methane, and acetaldehyde were the main compounds present in exhaust gases. Ethylene was easily oxidized over the catalyst, while acetaldehyde and methane were quite resistant to oxidation...|$|R

40|$|Methyl tert -butyl ether (MTBE), {{the most}} common <b>gasoline</b> <b>oxygenate,</b> is {{frequently}} detected in surface water and groundwater. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the potential of compound-specific isotope analysis to assess in situ biodegradation of MTBE in groundwater. For that purpose, the effect of relevant physical and biological processes on carbon isotope ratios of MTBE was evaluated in laboratory studies. Carbon isotope fractionation during organic phase/gas-phase partitioning (0. 50 ± 0. 15 ‰), aqueous phase/gas-phase partitioning (0. 17 ± 0. 05 ‰), and organic phase/aqueous-phase partitioning (0. 18 ± 0. 24 ‰) was small in comparison to carbon isotope fractionation measured during biodegradation of MTBE in microcosms based on aquifer sediments of the Borden site. In experiments with MTBE as the only substrate and a cometabolic experiment with 3 -methypentane as primary substrate, MTBE became enriched in 13 C by 5. 1 to 6. 9 ‰ after 95 to 97 % degradation. For both experiments, similar isotopic enrichment factors were obtained (- 1. 52 ± 0. 06 to - 1. 97 ± 0. 05 ‰). Biodegradation of TBA, which accumulated transiently in the cometabolic microcosms, was also accompanied by carbon isotope fractionation, with an isotopic enrichment factor of - 4. 21 ± 0. 07 ‰. This study suggests that carbon isotope analysis is a potential tool to trace in situ biodegradation of MTBE and TBA and thus to better understand the fate of these contaminants in the environment...|$|R
40|$|We have {{isolated}} a mixed {{bacterial culture}} (BC- 1) which {{is capable of}} degrading the <b>gasoline</b> <b>oxygenate</b> methyl t-butyl ether (MTBE). BC- 1 was developed from seed microorganisms present in a chemical plant biotreater sludge. This enrichment culture has been maintained in continuous culture treating high concentrations of MTBE (120 to 200 mg/liter) as the sole carbon source in a simple feed containing NH 4 +, PO 43 -, Mg 2 +, and Ca 2 + nutrients. The unit had a stable MTBE removal rate when maintained with a long cell retention time (ca. 80 to 90 days); however, when operated at a ≤ 50 -day cell waste rate, loss of MTBE-degrading activity was observed. The following three noteworthy experimental data show that MTBE is biodegraded extensively by BC- 1 : (i) the continuous (oxygen-sparged) culture was able to sustain a population of autotrophic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria which could nitrify influent NH 4 + concentrations at high rates and obtain CO 2 (sole carbon source for growth) from the metabolism of the alkyl ether, (ii) BC- 1 metabolized radiolabeled either (14 CH 3 O-MTBE) to 14 CO 2 (40 %) and 14 C-labeled cells (40 %), and (iii) cell suspensions of the culture were capable of degrading (substrate depletion experiments) MTBE to t-butyl alcohol, a primary metabolite of MTBE. BC- 1 is a mixed culture containing several bacterial species and is the first culture of its kind which can completely degrade an alkyl ether...|$|R
40|$|The alkane hydroxylase enzyme {{system in}} Pseudomonas putida GPo 1 has {{previously}} {{been reported to be}} unreactive toward the <b>gasoline</b> <b>oxygenate</b> methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE). We have reexamined this finding by using cells of strain GPo 1 grown in rich medium containing dicyclopropylketone (DCPK), a potent gratuitous inducer of alkane hydroxylase activity. Cells grown with DCPK oxidized MTBE and generated stoichiometric quantities of tert-butyl alcohol (TBA). Cells grown in the presence of DCPK also oxidized tert-amyl methyl ether but did not appear to oxidize either TBA, ethyl tert-butyl ether, or tert-amyl alcohol. Evidence linking MTBE oxidation to alkane hydroxylase activity was obtained through several approaches. First, no TBA production from MTBE was observed with cells of strain GPo 1 grown on rich medium without DCPK. Second, no TBA production from MTBE was observed in DCPK-treated cells of P. putida GPo 12, a strain that lacks the alkane-hydroxylase-encoding OCT plasmid. Third, all n-alkanes that support the growth of strain GPo 1 inhibited MTBE oxidation by DCPK-treated cells. Fourth, two non-growth-supporting n-alkanes (propane and n-butane) inhibited MTBE oxidation in a saturable, concentration-dependent process. Fifth, 1, 7 -octadiyne, a putative mechanism-based inactivator of alkane hydroxylase, fully inhibited TBA production from MTBE. Sixth, MTBE-oxidizing activity was also observed in n-octane-grown cells. Kinetic studies with strain GPo 1 grown on n-octane or rich medium with DCPK suggest that MTBE-oxidizing activity may have previously gone undetected in n-octane-grown cells because of the unusually high Ks value (20 to 40 mM) for MTBE...|$|R
