However <b>exporting</b> engines to western Pennsylvania, Kentucky or Ohio was challenging and expensive from a logistical perspective. In 1811 Evans and George, as well as another successful steam miller and engineer Luther Stephens, founded the Pittsburgh Steam Engine Company, which in addition to engines would, like the Mars Works, produce heavy machinery and castings in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. With high demand for industrial products and relatively little industrial capacity, the Pittsburgh works added to its repertoire the capacity for brasswork, as well as producing finer products for domestic purposes like hinges and fittings.|$|E
40|$|This study {{considers}} {{the role of}} <b>export</b> diversification in determining trade outcomes during the global financial crisis. The impact of <b>export</b> diversification (or concentration) is measured by assessing three different dimensions of specialization. First, concentration by geographic destination is considered; that is, whether the bulk of <b>exports</b> from a country go to many or few trading partners. Second, industry/sectoral concentration is considered; that is, whether a country’s <b>exports</b> are scattered across many industries and sectors, or concentrated in just a few. Third, product concentration is considered; that is, whether countries produce many products within their <b>export</b> sectors or just a few. The workhorse gravity trade model is adapted with trade diversification as an additional trade cost, and the model solution is empirically tested on a dataset containing over 500 thousand observations for Latin America. Industry and product concentration are found to significantly affect the resilience of Latin American countries’ trade during the global financial crisis - increasing the diversity of both <b>export</b> sectors and <b>export</b> products within sectors by one standard deviation reduces the quarterly decline in <b>exports</b> by approximately 4. 7 percent. Diversifying <b>exports</b> across many different trading partners is not found to significantly affect outcomes.

40|$|Building from an <b>export</b> {{information}} processing framework this research work particularly {{focuses on the}} quality of <b>export</b> memory, its determinants, its subsequent use in decision-making, and its ultimate relationship with <b>export</b> performance. Within <b>export</b> memory use, four <b>export</b> memory use dimensions have been discovered: instrumental, conceptual, legitimizing and manipulating. Results from the qualitative study based on the data from a mail survey with 354 responses reveal that the development of <b>export</b> memory quality is positively related with quality of <b>export</b> information acquisition, the quality of <b>export</b> information interpretation, <b>export</b> coordination, and integration of the information into the organizational system. Several company and environmental factors have also been examined in terms of their relationship with <b>export</b> memory use. The two factors found to be significantly related to the extent of <b>export</b> memory use are acquisition of <b>export</b> information quality and <b>export</b> memory quality. The results reveal that <b>export</b> memory quality is positively related to the extent of <b>export</b> memory use which in turn was found to be positively related to <b>export</b> performance. Furthermore, results of the study show {{that there is only one}} aspect of <b>export</b> memory use that significantly affects <b>export</b> performance – the extent of <b>export</b> memory use.
