40|$|School of Molecular Sciences(Chemical Engineering) Dye-sensitized {{solar cells}} (DSSCs) {{are one of}} the strong {{alternatives}} to conventional Si-based solar cells due to the advantages such as transparency, various colors and comparable efficiency to that of an amorphous Si solar cell. DSSC research also has been broadened to many applications such as flexible devices, module with large size, windows with transparency in need. The possible low cost for fabrication is another advantage. Since the discovery, researchers have focused more on improving the efficiency of the cells rather than their productivity. Productivity is the important factors in lowering the manufacturing costs. In DSSC production, dye coating is one of the important factors in the fabrication process. Ru-based dye adsorption on a photo anode takes a long time. To maximize energy harvesting of DSSCs, many researchers approaching to make lower the manufacturing cost, which could take a short time to adsorb the dye on a TiO 2 nanocrystalline surface. Here, I present the prominent way to fabricate a cell with <b>fast</b> <b>dye</b> coating method. Applied solvents are from mono alcohol to triols with various temperatures and concentrations of the dye. According to experiments, dye coating time can be shortened down from several hours to 3 min. To compare the new system to the conventional system, various analysis tools were applied for further investigation. The new solvent system with ethylene glycol, gives many advantages such as saving solvent usage, short coating time, and easy procedure for mass fabrication. However, I have a problem to make cells by dye aggregation at that time. Therefore, I report a method that can solve this problem. I could success to coat dye to use the solvent mixture without dye degradation. The proposed solvent system for dye coating results in <b>fast</b> <b>dye</b> coating with less concerns of dye degradation even at high temperatures, and is convenient for preparing double dye-coating layers on the working electrode. The solvents were ethylene glycol (EG) and glycerol (Gly). Because part of the mixture delivers dyes to the TiO 2 surface whereas most of the highly viscous solvent stays on the top part of the TiO 2 film. Also, the viscous solvent system could control coating depth with these solvents. So, I could make to apply the double-dye-layer electrode with N 719 and N 749 dyes. Furthermore, I also present a one of the methods used to improve DSSC performance with representative Ru-based dyes such as N 7, N 719 is the addition of a co-adsorbant in the dye solution. The working mechanism of these co-adsorbants is mainly by formation of a blocking layer on dye-empty spaces on TiO 2 nanoparticles. This blocking agent effectively prevents back electron transfer. As a result, DSSCs with titanate co-adsorbant showed significantly increased energy conversion efficiency. ope...|$|E

40|$|Dye {{sensitized}} {{solar cells}} (DSSCs) are an attractive way to convert light into electricity. Its development requires a detailed understanding and kinetic optimization of various electronic processes, especially those occurring at the mesoporous TiO 2 /dye/electrolyte interface. This dissertation work {{is focused on}} the exploration of the various electronic processes at the sensitized-electrode/electrolyte interface by using various electrochemical and photochemical methods. Firstly, an alternative redox couple—TEMPO/TEMPO·+ with a relatively high positive redox potential—is explored, aiming to reduce the energy loss during the dye regeneration process. Despite the <b>fast</b> <b>dye</b> regeneration, the charge recombination between the electrons in the conduction band of mesoporous TiO 2 and the oxidized redox species is found to be the limiting factor of the device. Further, a more efficient tandem-electrolyte system is developed, leading to DSSCs with the power conversion efficiency of 10. 5 % and 11. 7 % at 1 sun and 0. 5 -sun illumination, respectively. An electron-transfer cascade process during dye regeneration by the redox mediators is discovered to be beneficial.

Transport was investigated using BTCs and concentration maps, adsorption isotherms., and predictions by three different transport models: convection dispersion model (CDM), stream tube model (STM) and physical nonequilibrium model (PNEM). The dense network of large pores in the two upper soil layers induced a uniform lateral spreading of dyes and the CDM described the transport fairly well. In cores from the deeper layer, the large pore network was considerably less dense and dye patterns followed closely the few large pores without lateral mixing indicating preferential flow and explaining the <b>fast</b> <b>dye</b> breakthrough. Predictions by the STM revealed that the fast SB breakthrough could not be explained solely by preferential flow.

40|$|The {{structural}} {{evolution of}} cost-effective organo-clays (montmorillonite modified with different loadings of CTAB (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide)) is investigated and {{linked to the}} adsorption uptake and mechanism of an important industrial dye (hydrolyzed Remazol Black B). Key organo-clay characteristics, such as the intergallery spacing and {{the average number of}} well-stacked layers per clay stack are determined by low-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD), while differential thermo-gravimetric analysis (DTGA) is used to differentiate between surface-bound and intercalated CTAB. Insights into the dye adsorption mechanism are gained through the study of the adsorption kinetics and through the characterization of the organo-clay structure and surface charge after dye adsorption. It is shown that efficient adsorption of anionic industrial dyes is driven by three key parameters: (i) sufficiently large intergallery spacing to enable accommodation of the relatively large dye molecules, (ii) crystalline disorder in the stacking direction of the clay platelets to facilitate dye access, (iii) and positive surface charge to promote interaction with the anionic dyes. Specifically, it is shown that at low modifier loadings (0. 5 cation exchange capacity (0. 5 CEC)), CTAB molecules exclusively intercalate as a monolayer into the clay intergallery spaces, while with increasing modifier loadings, the CTAB molecules adopt a bilayer arrangement and adsorb onto the exterior clay surface. Bilayer intercalation results in sufficiently large expansion of the intergallery spaces and significant disordering along the (001) stacking direction to enable high and relatively <b>fast</b> <b>dye</b> uptake via intra-particle diffusion. Poor and slow dye uptake is observed for the organo-clays with monolayer structure, suggesting relatively inefficient dye adsorption at the clay edges.

40|$|This project {{focused on}} a range of sensitisers used in dye sensitised solar cells (DSSC) and tested their {{suitability}} in two main areas. The first was the stability of the dye which is essential for the long term success of DSSC devices. The second was to study dye sorption onto mesoporous TiO 2 films for the construction of DSSC devices. First the stability of D 35, N 719, Cyanine, D 131, methylene blue and the squaraine 1 and 2 dyes in ethanolic solutions were investigated by exposing to natural light for 64 days. Images after 0 days, 21 days and 64 were processed using RGB analysis and showed significant variation between dye stability. N 719 showed the highest stability and squaraine 1 showed the lowest. The stability of N 719, squaraine 1 and squaraine 2 was then compared on mesoporous TiO 2 films exposed under an artificial light for 4 hours. The results were concordant with the previous data that N 719 was the most stable but also showed a higher stability for squaraine 2 than squaraine 1. Finally DSSC devices of N 719 and D 35 were constructed and exposed to artificial light. The devices were monitored by solar simulation and image analysis. Results confirmed N 719 was again the most stable and showed a link between the efficiency and the colour of the device. A process to achieve <b>fast</b> <b>dye</b> sorption to TiO 2 films on 15 cm long DSSC devices was developed. The process was conducted by passing the dye through the DSSC device cavity using a peristaltic pump. This method was tested individually with N 719, squaraine 2, D 131, half squaraine, rhodamine B dyes and also used to co-sensitise half squaraine and SQ 1.

40|$|With the {{depletion}} of the earth’s oil reserves, the likely doubling of the world’s energy consumption {{over the next three}} decades and the startling climatic consequences caused by fossil fuel combustion, the development of new technologies that employ various sources of renewable energy is an urgent necessity. Among the sources of renewable energy, solar energy is considered the most promising since the energy reaching earth in one hour is greater than the annual consumption by human beings. Thus, various types of photovoltaic devices have been invented to harvest solar energy. However, the construction of these devices can be quite expensive and required advanced processing techniques. The dye sensitized solar cell (DSC) is one promising technology which can potentially be constructed at low cost with simple procedures and with lower environmental impact than most other available photovoltaics. DSCs typically consist of a working electrode with a mesoporous oxide layer composed of nano-size particles coated on a conducting glass. Attached {{to the surface of the}} nanocrystalline film is a monolayer of a photoactive dye. An electrolyte consisting of a redox couple is filled between the working electrode and the counter electrode, a conducting glass coated with a catalyst. The function of the electrolyte is to transport charge between two electrodes and to regenerate the photo-oxidized/reduced dye, following photo-induced injection into the semiconductor. This thesis focuses on the development of new DSC electrolytes based on transition metal complexes as redox couples with a view to improving the environmental friendliness and performance in both n-type and p-type devices. In n-type DSCs (n-DSCs), light illumination initiates the photoexcitation of the dye which then injects an electron in to the conduction band of the n-type semiconductor. The injected electron flows through the external circuit towards the counter electrode while the reduced redox mediator in the electrolyte regenerates the photo-oxidized dye. Then, the oxidized redox mediator undergoes reduction by electron injection at the counter electrode completing the charge transfer cycle. In contrast, the electron flow in p-type DSCs (p-DSCs) is directly opposite to that of n-DSCs. In these devices the photo-excited dye injects a hole into the valence band of the p-type semiconductor. In other words, an electron is transferred to the photo-excited dye from the valence band of the p–type semiconductor followed by photo-excitation. The reduced dye is then regenerated by the oxidized redox mediator in the electrolyte. The oxidized redox mediator is restored by injection of an electron from the reduced redox mediator into the counter electrode which then flows through the external circuit towards the working electrode to complete the cycle. In searching for environmental friendly redox mediators, a manganese based redox mediator, tris(acetylacetonato) manganese(III) /(IV), was utilized in n-DSCs. In addition, to the low toxicity of acetylacetonate complexes, there is the possibility to fine tuning of the redox potential by applying a wide variety of acetylacetone derivatives. Tris(acetylacetonato) manganese(III) /(IV) mediated devices demonstrated promising performances with both organic and metal based sensitizers leading to a vast selection of sensitizers. A good overall energy conversion of 4. 4 % was demonstrated for these devices in conjunction with both types of sensitizers. Due to the impressive properties of acetylacetonate complexes and suitable redox potentials, the tris(acetylacetonato) iron(II) /(III) complexes were used as redox mediators in p-DSCs. Development of redox shuttles with suitable redox potentials and <b>fast</b> <b>dye</b> regeneration kinetics is vital for further improvement in p-DSC efficiencies. Application of a nickel oxide (NiO) blocking layer on the working electrode suppressed unfavourable back reactions at the electrolyte/working electrode interface. Furthermore, <b>fast</b> <b>dye</b> regeneration kinetics were observed for the tris(acetylacetonato) iron(II) /(III) redox mediator which led to the best current density and the best overall energy conversion efficiency (2. 5 %) reported so far for p-DSCs. The efficiency of p-DSCs is limited mainly due to the highly coloured semiconductor material in use (NiO). None of the alternative materials introduced, such as; copper based semiconductor materials and boron-doped diamond, could surpass the performance of the devices based on NiO. Recently, surprising p-type conductivity was revealed on well-known n-type degenerate semiconductor, indium doped tin oxide (ITO). Yet, the reported performance for p-DSCs based on ITO was quite low compared to NiO based devices. To further exploit this property and develop devices with better efficiencies, mesoporous ITO was applied in p-DSCs with three different redox mediators iodide/triiodide, tris(ethylenediamine) cobalt(II) /(III) and tris(acetylacetonato) iron(II) /(III). For tris(acetylacetonato) iron(II) /(III) mediated devices an efficiency of 2 % was reached, which rivalled our best result of 2. 5 % for devices based on NiO. The mechanism of operation of the ITO based devices was also analysed and ITO shows a significant local density of states arising below − 4. 8 eV, that initiates electron transfer from the ITO to the excited dye leading to the photocathodic current within the device. Comparative studies also indicated that the rate of recombination at the ITO/electrolyte interface was faster than in the case of NiO. Therefore, development of redox mediators with faster dye regeneration kinetics or designing sensitizers with longer charge separated state may facilitate construction of more efficient p-DSCs based on mesoporous ITO. Finally, p-DSCs were constructed with an aqueous electrolyte based on (diaminosarcophagine) cobalt(II) /(III). Properties, such as low light absorption in visible region and more negative redox potential (vs. NHE), encouraged their use as p-DSCs redox mediators. The highest reported voltages for p-DSCs were measured (> 800 mV) for these devices and were attributed to more negative redox potential. Moreover, the dependence of the device performance on pH of the electrolyte was studied. The redox potential of the electrolyte shifted from − 0. 10 V to − 0. 34 V (vs. NHE) when pH was varied from 4 to 7 and then remained the same up to pH 11. The best device performance (1. 33 %) was recorded at pH 8. In summary, a series of transition metal complexes were introduced as redox mediators for either n-type or p-type DSCs that pave the way to enhance device performance. Furthermore, ITO was shown to be a suitable semiconductor material for p-DSCs that could overcome the major drawback in these devices...|$|E

Therefore small indigotin particles are merely trapped in the amorphous area of the fiber (Ahn et al., 2014) which enable easy attack from external oxidative degradation forces.|$|R
25|$|The <b>fast</b> red <b>dye</b> {{cochineal}} was {{an important}} export {{in areas such as}} central Mexico and Oaxaca in terms of revenues to the crown and stimulation of the internal market of New Spain. Cacao and indigo were also important exports for the New Spain, but was used through rather the vice royalties rather than contact with European countries due to piracy, and smuggling. The indigo industry in particular also helped to temporarily unite communities throughout the Kingdom of Guatemala due to the smuggling.|$|R
50|$|Para Red (paranitraniline red, Pigment Red 1, C.I. 12070) is a {{chemical}} dye. Chemically, the dye {{is similar to}} Sudan I. It was discovered in 1880 by von Gallois and Ullrich, {{and was the first}} azo dye. It dyes cellulose fabrics a brilliant red, but is not very <b>fast.</b> The <b>dye</b> can be washed away easily from cellulose fabrics if not dyed correctly. Acidic and basic stages both occur during the standard formation of Para Red, and acidic or basic byproducts may be present in the final product.|$|R

40|$|Reactive dyes are {{extensively}} used in {{the last}} years due to their superior performance, but they are environmentally hazardous. In the present work, the decolorization and degradation of commercial reactive azo dyes (Procion Navy H-exl, Procion Crimson H-exl and Procion Yellow H-exl) were studied using five advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) : H 2 O 2 /UV, Fenton, UV/Fenton, TiO 2 /UV and TiO 2 /UV/H 2 O 2. The dependence of the decolorization on the system parameters (solution pH, dye and reactants initial concentrations, and TiO 2 loading) and on the presence of salts (NaCl, Na 2 CO 3, NaHCO 3, Na 2 SO 4, NaNO 3 and Na 3 PO 4) was investigated. The decolorization (determined by spectrophotometric analysis) and the degradation (determined as TOC reduction) were compared for the different processes examined. The decolorization of the Procion H-exl solutions considered was found to strongly depend on the system parameters in all five AOPs. Although decolorization is very fast for the Fenton process and becomes even faster for the UV/Fenton process, degradation rates are relatively low for these two methods. Addition of H 2 O 2 increases the decolorization and especially the degradation rates for the TiO 2 /UV process. The H 2 O 2 /UV and TiO 2 /UV/H 2 O 2 processes result in the <b>fastest</b> <b>dye</b> degradation. The addition of the salts examined has in general an adverse effect on the decolorization rates, but to a varying degree depending on the salt used...|$|R
40|$|Four simple ruthenium(II) dyes {{have been}} {{synthesised}} {{with the general}} formula [Ru(4, 4 ′-(R,R 1) -bipyridine) (4, 4 ′-(R 2,R 3) -bipyridine) (NCS) 2] where R, R 1, R 2 and R 3 represent CH 3 or CO 2 H, hence varying the number and position of the carboxylic acid groups that bind the dye to TiO 2. The effect of varying the acid groups on cell fabrication, electrical performance and stability has been studied. The photophysical and electrochemical properties have been recorded and are relatively similar across the dye series, all showing parameters consistent with successful cell function, suggesting these dyes {{can be used as}} a good model to investigate the effect of changing the acid binding groups. Device measurements showed that the dyes containing a 4, 4 ′-dicarboxy-bipyridine ligand, with two CO 2 H groups on the same bipy, gave higher short-circuit current than the dyes that had ligands with no more than one carboxylate group on a given bipy. Measurement of dye uptake on TiO 2 using optical waveguide spectroscopy suggested that the dye with three acid groups provided better <b>dye</b> coverage, <b>faster</b> <b>dye</b> uptake rate, and a greater amount of dye remaining in the cell after rinsing. All four dyes gave cells that were broadly thermally stable at 85 °C over 500 hours, however the dye with only one acid group showed poorer thermal stability than the others...|$|R
