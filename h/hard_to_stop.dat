Locals in Mali said they were promised €7,500 ($10,000) upfront payment and compensation up to €750 ($1,000) per day. Gaddafi has used Malian Tuaregs in his political projects before, sending them to fight in places like Chad, Sudan and Lebanon and recently they have fought against Niger government, a war which Gaddafi has reportedly sponsored. Malian government officials told BBC that it's <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> the flow of fighters from Mali to Libya.

500|$|For the PC version, GameSpot editor Stephen Poole stated [...] "You'll {{be better}} off looking for free online {{versions}} of the various games contained in Caesars Palace 2000". In contrast, IGN was more favorable to the PC version of the game. Francois Laramee of Allgame praised the game for its [...] "excellent audio-visuals. The 3D accelerated graphics, specifically the tables, the cards and the dealers' hands, are well modeled and lit, and the playing chips are beautiful. The sound effects are accurate, and the voice actors, competent". However, he noted that [...] "some of the 3D effects are not particularly wieldy, the menus flicker, it's often <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> the scrolling menus at the right time, and the camera angles switch too fast and frequently {{to be anything but}} distracting. The slot machine wheels are a bit on the small side and difficult to read". Laramee went on to call the game [...] "a competent effort, but is essentially dry and uninspired". ComputerAndVideoGames.com's Alex Huhtala criticized the game for its [...] "Poor, vomit-inducing presentation".|$|E

500|$|As {{a former}} police officer, actor David Zayas was {{immediately}} interested {{in the role of}} Sgt. Angel Batista. After appearing in Oz for a season, Erik King, was looking for a [...] "different" [...] acting chance, he [...] "loved" [...] the character of Sgt. Doakes, after reading the script. South Korean actor C.S. Lee, who has a recurring role on the show as forensics specialist Vince Masuka, was asked for the part after Dexter producers recognized him in guest parts on Spin City, [...] and The Sopranos. Lee accepted the part because of the [...] "fantastic" [...] writing. By September 15, Jennifer Carpenter had joined the cast to play the part of Debra Morgan. Carpenter had enough time before her audition to read the Dexter books, but admitted that she [...] "didn’t exactly see myself in the books. I knew {{that it was going to}} be a TV show and that it had the potential to go for five to seven years, so I tried to make Deb as similar to me as possible and to bring out the parts of myself that were like Deb. I think that may have helped in the audition and it has certainly helped sustain such a long run with one character." [...] She also stated that she enjoyed cursing on television, but found it <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> it creeping into her real life. In June 2006 Geoff Pierson was cast as Cpt. Matthews. The series stars Lauren Vélez (Maria LaGuerta), David Zayas (Angel Batista) and Erik King (James Doakes), all previously starred in the American HBO television drama series Oz.|$|E

5000|$|Super House of Dead Ninjas {{received}} mostly favorable reviews, {{resulting in}} the averaged score of 79/100 at Metacritic. Nikola Suprak of Hardcore Gamer described it as [...] "bloody, violent, difficult and a sadistic kind of fun that makes it <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> put down (...) cramming every second of gameplay with as much blood, combat, and fun as possible, a game that is really <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> pass up at its meager asking price, and even <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> playing." [...] In an also positive review, Destructoid's Fraser Brown opined [...] "the instant challenge and frantic pace makes it perfect to just pick up and play for 15 minutes, while the tight controls and potentially limitless number of floors {{makes it easy to}} pour hours into," [...] but recommended to first try out the game's free version.|$|R

5000|$|Functionalism is {{a theory}} of {{international}} relations that arose principally {{from the experience of}} European integration. Rather than the self-interest that realists see as a motivating factor, functionalists focus on common interests shared by states. Integration develops its own internal dynamic: as states integrate in limited functional or technical areas, they increasingly find that momentum for further rounds of integration in related areas. This [...] "invisible hand" [...] of integration phenomenon is termed [...] "spillover". Although integration can be resisted, it becomes <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> integration's reach as it progresses. This usage, and the usage in functionalism in international relations, is the less common meaning of functionalism.|$|R

Neofunctionalism is simultaneously a theory and {{a strategy of}} regional integration, building {{on the work of}} David Mitrany. Neofunctionalists focused their attention solely on the immediate process of integration among states, i.e. regional integration. Initially, states integrate in limited functional or economic areas. Thereafter, partially integrated states experience increasing momentum for further rounds of integration in related areas. This [...] "invisible hand" [...] of integration phenomenon was termed [...] "spill-over." [...] by the neofunctionalist school. This was most apparent in the study of euthanasia.

40|$|Abstract: There is {{an implied}} {{assumption}} that addictions to different substances vary in strength from weak (easier <b>to</b> <b>stop)</b> <b>to</b> strong (<b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop),</b> though explicit definitions are lacking. Our {{hypothesis is that}} the strength of addictions can be measured by cessation rates found with placebo or no treatment controls, and that a weaker addiction would have a higher cessation rate than a stronger addiction. We report an overview of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of cessation trials, using randomised or quasi-randomised trials and reporting objectively-measured abstinence. The outcome for comparison was quit rates–typically the percentage of participants abstinent according to an objective test of abstinence at six months or longer. Twenty-eight cessation reviews (139, 000 participants) were found. Most data came from reviews of smoking cessation in over 127, 000 participants, and other reviews each covered a few thousand participants. Few reviews used data from studies shorter than three months, and almost all determined abstinence using objective measures. Cessation rates with placebo in randomised trials using objective measures of abstinence and typically over six months duration were 8 % for nicotine, 18 % for alcohol, 47 % for cocaine, and 44 % for opioids.

40|$|Since the 1990 s ethnic {{violence}} within states {{has become much}} more common than interstate violence and tends <b>to</b> be <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop,</b> leading <b>to</b> the question, how states can avoid {{ethnic violence}} and best accommodate multiple ethnicities within their boundaries. The worldwide increase of inner-state civil wars or complex emergencies has set peace and conflict studies high on the agenda of development and foreign policy debate. A central question in the theoretical debate is the consolidation and arrangements of democratic systems and institutions in ethnically heterogeneous societies, to prevent and resolve violent conflicts. In this recent debate there is still a lack of empirical research, analysing the opportunities and obstacles of conflict resolving political structures, processes and institutions in more depth. This paper therefore aims to contribute to the recent debate on conflict preventive/transforming arrangements of democratic systems by discussing proposals on federal restructuring and devolution of the political system in Sri Lanka as well as by looking into the realities of recognition of minorities at local level...|$|R
