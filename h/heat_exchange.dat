5|$|Alexander Kellner {{suggested}} that the large crests of the pterosaur Tapejara, {{as well as other}} species, might be used for <b>heat</b> <b>exchange,</b> allowing these pterosaurs to absorb or shed heat and regulate body temperature, which also would account for the correlation between crest size and body size. There is no evidence of extra blood vessels in the crest for this purpose, however, and the large, membranous wings filled with blood vessels would have served that purpose much more effectively.|$|E

In the reversible regime, the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanged</b> by the sample is mostly due to the latent heat at the transition and decreases with decreasing temperature, while in the irreversible regime, the heat is irreversibly dissipated and increases strongly with decreasing temperature, reaching a value of 237 J/kg at 4 K...|$|R

25|$|Observations of the Red Spot Jr. storm suggest Jupiter {{could be}} in a period of global climate change. This is {{hypothesized}} to be part of an approximately 70 year global climate cycle, characterized by the relatively rapid forming and subsequent slow erosion and merging of cyclonic and anticyclonic vortices in Jupiter's atmosphere. These vortices facilitate the <b>heat</b> <b>exchange</b> between poles and equator. If they have sufficiently eroded, <b>heat</b> <b>exchange</b> is strongly reduced and regional temperatures may shift by as much as 10 K, with the poles cooling down and the equator region heating up. The resulting large temperature differential destabilizes the atmosphere and thereby leads to the creation of new vortices.|$|E

25|$|Isothermal {{compression}} and expansion approaches attempt to maintain operating temperature by constant <b>heat</b> <b>exchange</b> to the environment. They are only practical for low power levels, without very effective heat exchangers. The theoretical efficiency of isothermal energy storage approaches 100% for perfect heat {{transfer to the}} environment. In practice neither of these perfect thermodynamic cycles is obtainable, as some heat losses are unavoidable.|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} the {{evaporator}} and condenser heat exchangers is also {{very important to the}} overall efficiency of the heat pump. The <b>heat</b> <b>exchange</b> surface areas and the corresponding temperature differential (between the refrigerant and the air stream) directly affect the operating pressures and hence the work the compressor has {{to do in order to}} provide the same heating or cooling effect. Generally, the larger the heat exchanger, the lower the temperature differential and the more efficient the system becomes.|$|E
50|$|Besides this, {{allowing}} the subcooling process to occur outside the condenser (as with an internal heat exchanger) {{is a good}} way of using up all of the condensing device's <b>heat</b> <b>exchanging</b> capacity. A huge portion of refrigeration systems use part of the condenser for subcooling which, though very effective and simple, may be considered a diminishing factor in the nominal condensing capacity. A similar situation may be found with superheating taking place in the evaporator, thus, an internal heat exchanger is a good and relatively cheap solution for the maximization of <b>heat</b> <b>exchanging</b> capacity.|$|R

40|$|International audienceAn {{experimental}} {{study has been}} carried out on a water sprayed air flow aimed at cooling the air upstream of a heat exchanger in order to improve the heat transfer. A pilot has been built allowing injecting droplets in air in various conditions while controlling flow rates, temperature and humidity.

An actual increase in the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanged</b> (up to 3 times more) for an air initially entering in surrounding conditions (temperature between 293 and 308 K and relative humidity between 47. 5 % and 19. 7 %) has been reached when injecting upstream droplets smaller than 25 mm, in an air flow crossing the exchanger.

Their frontal sinus is also reduced in order to allow more room for padding to protect from their cold environment. Regardless of the environment that the mongoloid is in, his nose helps reduce the stress of the environment on their body by moistening the air inspired to cool the body off instead of doing a straight up <b>heat</b> <b>exchange.</b>|$|E
