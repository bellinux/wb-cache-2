25|$|For web developers, Chrome {{features}} an element inspector (Inspect Element), {{similar to the}} browser extension in <b>Firebug,</b> which allows users {{to look into the}} DOM and see what makes up the webpage.|$|E
25|$|In {{comparison}} to Internet Explorer, Firefox {{has a more}} comprehensive set of developer tools, which include a debugger as well. Old versions of Firefox without these tools used a Firefox addon called <b>Firebug,</b> or the older Venkman debugger. Also, WebKit's Web Inspector includes a JavaScript debugger, which is used in Safari. A modified version called Blink DevTools is used in Google Chrome. Node.js has Node Inspector, an interactive debugger that integrates with the Blink DevTools, available in Google Chrome. Opera includes a set of tools called Dragonfly.|$|E
500|$|In March 2011 Veronica Henry {{reviewed}} Epiphany 2.32, saying [...] "To be fair, {{this would}} be a hard sell as a primary desktop browser for most users. In fact, there isn't even a setting to let you designate it as your default browser. But for those instance where you need to fire up a lighting-fast browser for quick surfing, Epiphany will do the trick." [...] She further noted, [...] "Though I still use Firefox as my primary browser, lately it seems to run at a snail's pace. So, {{one of the first things}} I noticed about Epiphany is how quickly it launches. And subsequent page loads on my system are equally as fast." [...] Henry criticized Epiphany for its short list of extensions, singling out the lack of <b>Firebug</b> as a deficiency. Web instead supports Web Inspector offered by the WebKit engine, which has similar functionality.|$|E
40|$|This study {{deals with}} {{importance}} of {{spots in the}} firebugs' wild-type pattern (Pyrrhocoris apterus) as a warning signal. <b>Firebugs,</b> that were carrying paper stickers with modified color pattern, were offered to great tits (Parus major). Pattern was modified in the purpose to test the necessity of black round spots on the <b>firebugs</b> hemielytra. None of modified <b>firebugs</b> has been eaten, and only scarcely has been attacked. However, there were minimum differences between particular modifications of pattern...|$|R

2500|$|Mozilla browsers {{currently}} support LiveConnect, {{a feature}} that allows JavaScript and Java to intercommunicate on the Web. However, Mozilla-specific support for LiveConnect {{was scheduled to be}} phased out in the future in favor of passing on the LiveConnect handling via NPAPI to the Java 1.6+ plug-in (not yet supported on the Mac [...] ). Most browser inspection tools, such as <b>Firebug</b> in Firefox, include JavaScript interpreters that can act on the visible page's DOM.|$|E
2500|$|Hundreds of individuals, {{some of them}} lightly wounded, {{converged on}} the church to search the debris for {{survivors}} as police erected barricades around the church and several outraged men scuffled with police. An estimated 2,000 black people, many of them hysterical, converged {{on the scene in}} the hours following the explosion as the church's pastor, the Reverend John Cross, Jr., attempted to placate the crowd by loudly reciting the 23rd Psalm through a bullhorn. One individual who converged on the scene to help search for survivors, Charles Vann, later recollected that he had observed a solitary white man whom he recognized as Robert Edward Chambliss (a known member of the Ku Klux Klan) standing alone and motionless at a barricade. According to Vann's later testimony, Chambliss was standing [...] "looking down toward the church, like a <b>firebug</b> watching his fire".|$|E
2500|$|Features include tabbed browsing, spell checking, {{incremental}} find, live bookmarking, Smart Bookmarks, a download manager, private browsing, location-aware browsing (also {{known as}} [...] "geolocation") {{based on a}} Google service, and an integrated search system that uses Yahoo! Search, which is a front end of Microsoft search engine Bing, by default in most localizations. Additionally, Firefox provides an environment for web developers {{in which they can}} use built-in tools, such as the Error Console or the DOM Inspector, or extensions, such as <b>Firebug</b> and more recently there has been an integration feature with Pocket. Firefox Hello was an implementation of WebRTC, added in October 2014, which allows users of Firefox and other compatible systems to have a video call, with the extra feature of screen and file sharing by sending a link to each other. Firefox Hello is scheduled to be removed in September 2016.|$|E
40|$|Predators {{may either}} learn to avoid aposematic prey or may avoid {{it because of}} an innate bias. Learned as well as innate {{avoidance}} has been observed in birds, but the existing evidence is based on experiments with rather few unrelated model species. We compared the origin of avoidance in European species of tits (Paridae). First, we tested whether wild-caught birds (blue tits, great tits, crested tits, coal tits, willow tits, and marsh tits) avoid aposematic (red and black) adult <b>firebugs</b> Pyrrhocoris apterus (Heteroptera) more than nonaposematic (brown painted) ones. Larger proportion of birds avoided aposematic than brown-painted <b>firebugs</b> in majority of species (except coal tits). Second, we tested whether naive hand-reared birds of 4 species (blue tits, great tits, crested tits, and coal tits) attack or avoid aposematic and nonaposematic <b>firebugs,</b> both novel for them. Behavior of the naive blue tits and coal tits {{was similar to that}} of the wild-caught birds; majority of them did not attack the <b>firebugs.</b> Contrastingly, the naive great tits and crested tits behaved differently than the wild-caught conspecific adults; majority of the wild-caught birds avoided the aposematic <b>firebugs,</b> whereas the naive birds usually did not show any initial avoidance and had to learn to avoid the aposematic prey. Our results show that the origin of avoidance may be different even in closely related species. Because blue tits and coal tits avoided not only aposematic <b>firebugs</b> but also their brown-painted form, we interpret their behavior as innate neophobia rather than innate bias against the warning coloration.
