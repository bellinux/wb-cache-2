5|$|In 2012 Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) {{introduced}} a new Espanto Jr. {{as part of their}} Generacion 2012 group of wrestlers. In the weeks and months following the introduction of Generacion 2012, Hijo del Espanto (unclear if <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>I</b> or II) publicly stated that he and his brother were the rightful holders of the rights to the Espanto name, given to them by the only remaining, living member of the original Los Espantos, Espanto II. Hijo del Espanto demanded that Espanto Jr. changed his name, but neither the wrestler nor CMLL ever responded to the request.|$|E

They were all orchestral sounds, but I was playing them all, and suddenly I was Hofmann. I was enchanted.|$|E

500|$|On {{hearing the}} news Kenneth Williams {{wrote in his}} diary that [...] "I loved that man. His unselfish nature, his kindness, {{tolerance}} and gentleness were an example to everyone". In The Sunday Times in February 1969, Paul Jennings wrote of him: [...] "If I ever knew a gentleman, it was Kenneth Horne.... He gave you his whole attention, his whole courtesy. And what a courtesy <b>it</b> <b>was!...</b> <b>I</b> knew him {{in the context of}} panel games, to which his marvellous unforced humour, spontaneous but beautifully timed, always added sparkle." ...|$|E
500|$|... "That was a {{conscious}} move by Max and myself, {{because we were}} listening to alternative and indie music and talking about some song– I don't remember what <b>it</b> <b>was.</b> <b>I</b> said, 'Ah, I love this song,' and Max was like, 'If they would just write a damn pop chorus on it!' It was driving him nuts, because that indie song was sort of on six, going to seven, going to eight, the chorus comes ... and it goes back down to five. It drove him crazy. And when he said that, it was like, light bulb. 'Why don't we do that, but put a big chorus on it?' It worked." ...|$|E

500|$|He recounted {{his career}} as a thief, {{confirming}} Kloepfer's long-time suspicion that he had shoplifted virtually everything of substance that he owned. [...] "The big payoff for me," [...] he said, [...] "was actually possessing whatever <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>I</b> had stolen. I really enjoyed having something ... that I had wanted and gone out and taken." [...] Possession proved to be an important motive for rape and murder as well. Sexual assault, he said, fulfilled his need to [...] "totally possess" [...] his victims. At first, he killed his victims [...] "as a matter of expediency ... to eliminate the possibility of [...] caught"; but later, murder became part of the [...] "adventure". [...] "The ultimate possession was, in fact, the taking of the life", he said. [...] "And then ... the physical possession of the remains." ...|$|E
500|$|Hill {{attended}} Columbia High School, {{where she}} was a member of the track team, a cheerleader and was a classmate of Zach Braff. She also took violin lessons, went to dance class, and founded the school's gospel choir. Academically, she took advanced placement classes and received primarily 'A' grades. School officials recognized her as a leader among the student body. Later recalling her education, Hill commented, [...] "I had a love for – I don't know if it was necessarily for academics, more than it just was for achieving, period. If it was academics, if it was sports, if it was music, if it was dance, whatever <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> <b>I</b> was always driven to do a lot in whatever field or whatever area I was focusing on at the moment." ...|$|E
500|$|The HIV storyline {{came to an}} end {{on-screen}} in 2003, when {{executive producer}} Louise Berridge decided to axe Mark Fowler. In the serial, Mark discovers his HIV medication is failing, but instead of allowing Pauline to witness his deterioration, he leaves to spend the remainder of his life travelling. Richard has classed Mark's exit as her most difficult storyline, commenting: [...] "I was so genuinely upset that Todd Carty, who played Mark, was going I could barely get my lines out for want of crying—but everybody said I acted it well. <b>It</b> <b>was,</b> <b>I</b> think, ten per cent acting and 90 per cent me crying my eyes out because I was being selfish and didn't want Todd to go." [...] Mark, who had appeared intermittently for 18 years, was eventually killed off-screen in 2004, dying of an AIDS-related illness.|$|E

500|$|General Prem Chand was {{particularly}} anxious about Bunche's visit. Keenly aware of this, Bunche {{did his best}} to alleviate the general's worries, asking to stay at his residence in Élisabethville instead of a hotel. Prem Chand was alarmed when Bunche presented him with a letter from Thant, but Bunche reached into his pocket and pulled out a suggested response. The general was surprised by the accuracy of the draft in its considerations of the military situation of UN troops during the advance, though the following day he gave Bunche a full explanation of what had occurred. In his official report on the events in Katanga, Bunche concluded, [...] "I have found beyond doubt that it is our machinery that is at fault, far more than the individuals." [...] He returned to UN Headquarters on 10 January with an official apology from ONUC commanders. Thant later commented on the matter, writing, [...] "I felt that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>I,</b> not they, who should have apologised for my miscalculation and apprehensions based on scare reports from London and Brussels." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Harrison's later recollection, Spector {{suggested}} that [...] "Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp" [...] might attract a few cover versions if {{he changed the}} lyrics. In I, Me, Mine, Harrison acknowledges that the song was [...] "a piece of personal indulgence", but [...] "those words were written because that's what it was" [...] – a tribute to Frank Crisp. A number of Crisp's homilies directly inspired other Harrison songs {{during the first half}} of the 1970s, such as [...] "Ding Dong, Ding Dong" [...] and [...] "The Answer's at the End". Harrison went on to identify philosophically with Crisp, of whom he writes elsewhere in I, Me, Mine: [...] "Sir Frank helped my awareness; whatever <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>I</b> felt became stronger, or found more expression by moving into that house, because everything stepped up or was heightened." [...] Leng considers that the song, along with [...] "All Things Must Pass", predicts Harrison's eventual [...] "retreat into an internal musical dialogue, set amid the woods and gardens of Friar Park", a change of perspective marked by his 1979 eponymous solo album.|$|E
500|$|Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish {{was adamant}} that his players would improve {{following}} the defeat: [...] "They've been in two cup finals {{in this season}} – they'll have enjoyed the first one more than the second, the lads {{will benefit from the}} experience. You can't give a team like Chelsea a two-goal head start." [...] When asked about his future as manager of the club Dalglish stated: [...] "We'll assess the season {{at the end of the}} season." [...] Captain Steven Gerrard echoed Dalglish's sentiments: [...] "With the players we have in that dressing room, we could have done better. But we are Liverpool. We will bounce back. We will strengthen in the summer and come back fighting again. That's what Liverpool Football Club does." [...] Striker Andy Carroll, who scored one goal and had another disallowed, thought the ball had crossed the line: [...] "I thought it was over the line and you know better than me but I thought <b>it</b> <b>was.</b> <b>I</b> thought it hit the other side of the bar but I haven't seen it back." ...|$|E

500|$|On 1 January 2013, Higginbotham {{signed for}} Sheffield United on a six-month contract, {{and made his}} debut for the club against their South Yorkshire rivals Doncaster Rovers the same day. Former Stoke {{teammate}} and current Sheffield United teammate Dave Kitson {{played a part in}} Higginbotham's move to Bramall Lane, Higginbotham stated on his move to the club: [...] "I was getting ready to go back to Ipswich on Sunday but after speaking to Dave I was optimistic something would be sorted here and thankfully <b>it</b> <b>was...</b> <b>I</b> was very surprised and very happy when I got a phone call on Sunday to say that something could be happening here ... Dropping into League One isn't a worry for me because this is a club on the up and I didn't want to be stuck at Stoke just picking my money up because that isn't me" [...] On 18 June 2013, having made sufficient first-team appearances for Sheffield United, Higginbotham activated a clause in his contract to extend it for the following season.|$|E
500|$|Entering 2008, Baseball America ranked Davis {{the number}} two {{prospect}} in the Rangers' organization, behind Elvis Andrus. Davis began the season playing first base for Frisco. He batted [...]333 with 62 hits, 13 home runs, and 42 RBI in 46 games before earning a promotion to the Triple-A Oklahoma RedHawks of the Pacific Coast League. In 31 games with Oklahoma, he hit [...]333 with 37 hits, 10 home runs, and 31 RBI. He {{was named to the}} All-Star Futures Game but was unable to play in it because he was promoted to the major leagues by the Texas Rangers. Later, during his breakout 2013 season, Davis referred to his time with Round Rock in 2008: [...] "I know nobody really cares about Triple-A, but I put up these numbers up in Triple-A. That was kind of the question, 'Was he {{going to be able to}} do it at the big league level?' The thing about <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> <b>I</b> just couldn't do it consistently. I couldn't put the bat on the ball. I was striking out an astronomical amount, and this year it's just been consistency day in and day out." ...|$|E
500|$|Former Sega of America senior {{producer}} Scot Bayless {{attributes the}} unsuccessful market {{to a lack}} of direction from Sega with the add-on. According to Bayless, [...] "It was a fundamental paradigm shift with almost no thought given to consequences. I honestly don't think anyone at Sega asked the most important question: 'Why?' There's a rule I developed during my time as an engineer in the military aviation business: never fall in love with your tech. I think that's where the Mega-CD went off the rails. The whole company {{fell in love with the}} idea without ever really asking how it would affect the games you made." [...] Sega of America producer Michael Latham offers a contrasting view of support for the add-on, however, stating [...] "I loved the Sega CD. I always thought the platform was under-appreciated and that it was hurt by an over-concentration of trying to make Hollywood interactive film games versus using its storage and extended abilities to make just plain great video games." [...] Former Sega of Europe president Nick Alexander commented on the Mega-CD, saying [...] "The Mega CD was interesting but probably misconceived and was seen very much as the interim product <b>it</b> <b>was.</b> <b>I</b> am afraid I cannot recall the sales numbers, but it was not a success." ...|$|E

500|$|At around 9:30 on {{the night}} of September 27, 1868, Hindman was assassinated by one or more unknown assailants who fired through his parlor window while he was reading his {{newspaper}} with his children. The musket shots hit Hindman in the jaw, throat, and hands, and he died eight hours later due to significant blood loss. Before his death, Hindman gave a farewell speech to his neighbors and political supporters from the porch of his house. With [...] "perfect composure", Hindman told listeners to [...] "unite their courage and determination to bring peace to the people". Hindman hinted at the recent political debate with Powell Clayton as a possible motivation for the shooting and said, [...] "I do not know who killed me; but I can say, whoever <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> <b>I</b> forgive him." [...] He asked James H. O'Connor, the husband of Mollie's stepmother, to [...] "take care of my family and be a protector to my wife and dear little ones". After O'Connor accepted, Hindman stated, [...] "I forgive everybody, and hope they will forgive me." [...] Afterwards, he was too weak to continue speaking, and he sat down on a lounge. He remained there until he died early next morning. The assassination was announced in all major newspapers throughout the state. William Woodruff of the Gazette said Hindman died as an [...] "able and distinguished man" [...] whose [...] "short but splendid career" [...] {{had a profound impact on}} Arkansan state politics.|$|E
500|$|Wanting {{to stray}} {{away from the}} R-styled music of Thankful, which she {{described}} as a showcase of versatility, she revealed that Thankfuls success [...] "empowered me to step more into rock, step more into the soulful vibe." [...] She described {{the music of the}} second album as [...] "like the first CD in the sense that it's versatile, but it's more into the rock, It's more into the soulful roots, and it's just a little bit deeper, so it's pretty cool." [...] Dr. Luke revealed in an interview that alternative music and indie music were inspirations to [...] "Since U Been Gone", saying, [...] "That was a conscious move by Max [...] and myself, because we were listening to alternative and indie music and talking about some song-I don't remember what <b>it</b> <b>was.</b> <b>I</b> said, 'Ah, I love this song,' and Max was like, 'If they would just write a damn pop chorus on it!'

500|$|Apple and NeXT {{marketing}} executive and Jobs' confidant in the film. When discussing her audition for the film, Winslet later commented that she [...] "heard about {{it through a}} crew member who I happened {{to be working with}} , I didn't even care what role <b>it</b> <b>was.</b> <b>I</b> just wanted to be in it. Found out the nature of the role. Googled [...] Found one picture of her. Got my husband to go to a wig shop. Buy a short-haired dark wig. Stuck it on my head. Sent a photograph of myself to [...] Scott Rudin. Danny Boyle came to Melbourne and we had a meeting and he gave me the part." [...] Winslet spent considerable time with Joanna Hoffman to prepare for the role before production began. She noted that Hoffman [...] "has a softness to her. She came to America as a young woman and achieved a great deal. One thing that was unique about her as a figure in Steve's life was that she didn't need anything from him. She just needed for him to be the best version of himself. And that's what really set their relationship apart from any relationship with all his other colleagues." [...] Winslet credits Hoffman's difficult childhood (that began in Armenia) with her ability to manage Jobs. [...] On {{the nature of the relationship}} between Hoffman and Jobs, Winslet said that she and Fassbender [...] "were able to develop as literally co-workers. I do believe it was very similar to the relationship that Steve and Joanna had. She was like his work wife. She was head of marketing for the Macintosh, and then she stayed with him for his working life. She was an extraordinary, feisty Eastern European person who was pretty much the only person who could actually knock sense into Steve, and she was also kind of an emotional compass." [...] In developing her sense of the character, Winslet stated that she [...] "just wanted to please [...] as much as I could. How she sounds, and her accent, is fairly complicated. She grew up largely in Armenia, spent some time in Poland, and has Russians in her family, so she has all three accents, but she's been in America since she was a teenager, so she had American rhythms. You know, she really has this accent that goes way up and down. It's almost impossible to copy because of just how singsongy it becomes. So I had to put it into my own register. But we were all doing accents. I mean, Michael's Irish, and he's playing Steve Jobs, for God's sake." [...] Finally, Winslet notes that Hoffman [...] "did genuinely love [...] And spending time with her, when I was figuring out how to play this difficult part, she would become very emotional. She misses him terribly." ...|$|E
