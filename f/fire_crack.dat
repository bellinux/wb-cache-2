40|$|Heaps of <b>fire</b> <b>cracked</b> stones is an {{apparent}} {{feature of the}} Scandinavian Bronze Age. The heaps are built of stones <b>cracked</b> by <b>fire</b> and then placed in different constructions. The heaps are placed in different contexts in the Bronze Age landscape {{and for a long}} time, research neglected this site category owing to that the heaps were not considered important enough to dig. During the 1980 s- 90 s the interest for the heaps of <b>fire</b> <b>cracked</b> stones increased and it became a wellresearched although debated site category. Earlier research has interpreted the heaps to be on the hillslopes in the landscape. This study’s research aims to understand the relation between shorelines and the placement of <b>fire</b> <b>cracked</b> stone heaps. This will be done through a landscape study of Uppland. The study indicates that the pattern in the distribution of heaps of <b>fire</b> <b>cracked</b> stones creates a correlation with the shoreline of the time the heaps were built, through their placement in the landscape. By creating a dynamic shoreline displacement, the essay will {{be able to look at}} the landscape in a more detailed way and will be able to investigate the relation between the heaps and the water edge. Through excluding the heaps that are under the waterline it is possible to in general determine the earliest possible production date. The <b>fire</b> <b>cracked</b> stone heaps have earlier been categorised to the Scandinavian Bronze Age but this research argues that some of the heaps should belong to the Neolithic Age as well...|$|R
50|$|The {{artifacts}} recovered {{included a}} great many <b>fire</b> <b>cracked</b> rocks and chert flakes. Some ceramic shard and stone projectile points were also discovered, {{as well as two}} celts and two copper artifacts. Historic artifacts, presumably related to the logging community of Edgewater, were also discovered.|$|R
60|$|Silence ensued {{then for}} a moment, {{at the end of}} which {{interval}} Dale heard a rapid clip-clop on the rocky trail outside. The men below shuffled uneasily, but none of them spoke. The <b>fire</b> <b>cracked</b> cheerily. Snake Anson stepped back from before the door with an action that expressed both doubt and caution.|$|R
50|$|The {{deposits}} included shell midden and <b>fire</b> <b>cracked</b> debris. The upper levels did {{not appear}} to be true shell middens, since they only contained roughly 15-20% shell midden volume. The rainwater and groundwater at this site has been sufficient to create a uniform midden level, which aids in preservation of artifacts such as bone.|$|R
50|$|Examples include stone tools, pottery vessels, metal {{objects such}} as weapons, and items of {{personal}} adornment such as buttons, jewelry and clothing. Bones that show signs of human modification are also examples. Natural objects, such as <b>fire</b> <b>cracked</b> rocks from a hearth or plant material used for food, are classified by archeologists as ecofacts rather than as artifacts.|$|R
60|$|That {{very moment}} and second, O Best Beloved, the Milk-pot that {{stood by the}} <b>fire</b> <b>cracked</b> in two pieces--ffft--because it remembered the bargain she had made with the Cat, and when the Woman jumped down from the footstool--lo and behold!--the Cat was lapping up the warm white milk that lay {{in one of the}} broken pieces.|$|R
50|$|Industrial mining {{of copper}} at Coniston {{is said to}} have started when Elizabeth I brought over German miners to exploit the local deposits. During the English Civil War mining {{equipment}} was damaged, and as a result progress was slowed, and mining became dependent on <b>fire</b> <b>cracking</b> (not explosive) techniques. This mine {{was one of the first}} large scale mines to be dug.|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of {{possibility of the}} <b>fire</b> <b>cracks</b> arising is carried out {{on the basis of}} existing data on changing of mechanical characteristics of industrial steel grades at high temperatures (in the processes of hardening and cooling in ingots and slugs). It is determined that at casting of slugs at MNLZ the failure of uniformity of hard skin in the initial period of its formation is possible. </p...|$|R
60|$|They {{were very}} merry {{and full of}} {{enjoyment}} the whole time, but not the least pleasant part of the festival was when they all three sat about the <b>fire,</b> <b>cracking</b> nuts, drinking wine and talking cheerfully. It happened that Tom Pinch had a word to say to his friend the organist's assistant, and so deserted his warm corner {{for a few minutes}} at this season, lest it should grow too late; leaving the other two young men together.|$|R
25|$|Other {{methods used}} {{to assist in the}} {{germination}} of seeds that have dormancy include prechilling, predrying, daily alternation of temperature, light exposure, potassium nitrate, the use of plant growth regulators, such as gibberellins, cytokinins, ethylene, thiourea, sodium hypochlorite, and others. Some seeds germinate best after a fire. For some seeds, <b>fire</b> <b>cracks</b> hard seed coats, while in others, chemical dormancy is broken in reaction to the presence of smoke. Liquid smoke is often used by gardeners to assist in the germination of these species.|$|R
40|$|Archaeology {{students}} of the Institute of Science and the Environment, at the University of Worcester conducted an archaeological investigation at Oldbury Farm, SO 827 554, on March 7 and 14, 2017, to follow up the results of field survey undertaken in 2016. Test pits were placed in {{an area in which}} Middle Palaeolithic and Late Neolithic/Early Bronze Age flints had been previously recovered. Excavation and further surface pick-up identified an area of <b>fire</b> <b>cracked</b> rock which coincides with an area of ferrous dipolar anomalies revealed by a gradiometer survey conducted by CsMg associates (2016). These results suggest the presence of prehistoric activity, which invites further investigation...|$|R
50|$|Originally, {{the church}} {{served as the}} private chapel of the Patriarch of Moscow, but during the mid-17th century it {{was taken over by}} the Russian royal family. The church was badly damaged in a fire in 1737 (the same <b>fire</b> that <b>cracked</b> the Tsar Bell).|$|R
25|$|Around the beachhead, {{a hastily}} {{prepared}} defensive line {{was established by}} an ad hoc force of engineers, Australian infantry, and headquarters personnel. As night fell, 'C' Company's platoon reached {{the southern part of}} the beachhead perimeter. The Japanese then attacked the defensive line in a series of attacks that lasted throughout the night, with machine gun, mortar, and rifle <b>fire</b> <b>cracking</b> around the American defensive positions in conjunction with grenade attacks. Small parties of Japanese soldiers attempted to infiltrate the positions, but were pushed back. The Japanese withdrew before sunrise on 1 July, having lost around 50 killed during the night. Allied casualties amounted to 18 killed, and 27 wounded, several of which were the result of friendly fire incidents. Patrols were subsequently sent out and began searching for Japanese stragglers during the morning.|$|R
2500|$|Beginning in 1971, archeological {{excavations}} {{supervised by}} scholars from Medicine Hat College (MHC) were conducted at {{what became known}} as Saamis Archeological Site along Seven Persons Creek, near a historic Blackfoot buffalo jump. These revealed numerous artifacts associated with bands of First Nations ancestors, known as the Old Women's Phase to archeologists. They found [...] "quantities of stone tools, <b>fire</b> <b>cracked</b> rock, butchered bone and pottery", marking this as an important spot. Most of the bones were identified as bison. Additional excavations were conducted in 1972 and 1973, and a field school for college students was based there. They [...] "excavated and mapped over 3,200 sq. ft. of living floors and nearly 80 features including hearths and stone boiling pits. Radiocarbon dates indicate the Saamis Site was initially occupied about AD 1500 and again around AD 1750", well before most European contact.|$|R
50|$|When Francesco died, {{his younger}} brother Cardinal Ferdinando de' Medici {{inherited}} the position of Grand Duke. Ferdinando brought his prized Chinese and Medici porcelains back with him to Florence from the Villa Medici in Rome, along with his paintings and treasured Roman antiquities. But with the ubiquity of European soft-paste and hard-paste porcelains in the eighteenth century, the Medici heirs in the House of Lorraine came to value less and less the imperfect Medici porcelains, with their minute <b>firing</b> <b>cracks</b> and bubbled glazes. In 1772 an auction in the Palazzo Vecchio of objects from storage dispersed the Medici porcelains conserved in Tuscany. The venture disappeared from history until interest revived after the mid-nineteenth century. The 1588 inventory drawn up after Francesco's death listed 310 pieces. Today only some sixty or seventy pieces are known to survive.|$|R

[...] "Then, when there is a deep snow on the ground we can sit before the blazing <b>fire</b> and <b>crack</b> nuts and eat them. You must come over some time this winter and help," [...] she added.|$|R
6000|$|The trouble {{began in}} the drawing-room after dinner. Out of {{deference}} to the bishop's abstinence the men did not remain to smoke, but came in to find the Mariposa and Lady Sunderbund smoking cigarettes, which these ladies continued {{to do a little}} defiantly. They had hoped to finish them before the bishop came up. The night was chilly, and a cheerful wood <b>fire</b> <b>cracking</b> and banging on the fireplace emphasized the ordinary heating. Mrs. Garstein Fellows, who had not expected so prompt an appearance of the men, had arranged her chairs in a semicircle for a little womanly gossip, and before she could intervene she found her party, with the exception of Lord Gatling, who had drifted just a little too noticeably with Miss Barnsetter into a window, sitting round with a conscious air, that was perhaps just a trifle too apparent, of being [...] "good." ...|$|R

50|$|Archaeological {{findings}} in 2009 {{show that the}} hominids who inhabited the area exploited Lake Hula fish. Analysis of the fish remains recovered from the archaeological site of Gesher Benot Ya‘aqov (GBY) have shown that they exploited {{a wide range of}} fish including catfish, tilapia and carp. Some of the carp were over a meter long. Tools to light <b>fires</b> and <b>crack</b> nuts were also discovered at the site.|$|R
5000|$|Cane Island Site is a {{destroyed}} {{archaeological site}} located in Putnam County, Georgia, along the Oconee River at Long Shoals. It {{is part of}} the lower Piedmont. The site number is 9Pm209. The site was first excavated by William Dean Wood in August 1977. The Cane Island site is a large site at least 200m x 25m in size. Wood found two small houses which he used to study the concept of household. A small area of each of the houses was excavated and neither one was totally excavated. The larger of the two was estimated to be 7m long by 5m wide. Central hearths were found in the houses, along with charred wood and <b>fire</b> <b>cracked</b> rocks. Because {{of the size of the}} site, it is unknown what percentage of it got excavated. The Cane Island site is from the later part of the early Woodland Period and based on Wood’s work, it was determined that there had been discontinuous occupation of the site for more than 9000 years.|$|R

5000|$|During the <b>fire</b> large <b>cracks</b> {{appeared}} in the building. A group of engineers spoke out urging the cessation of efforts to save the property inside, instead advocating a controlled demolition of the building {{for the sake of}} safety. Experts suggested that the steel reinforcement within the ceiling and walls of the third floor had weakened, and that the ceiling was liable to collapse, which would lead to a [...] "domino effect" [...] causing a catastrophic structural failure.|$|R
40|$|Around 1600 burnt mounds, {{comprising}} {{heaps of}} <b>fire</b> <b>cracked</b> stones, {{up to several}} metres across with characteristic forms, {{are listed in the}} National Monuments Records of Scotland, with a diverse distribution. Many more are known in other parts of Europe, notably in Ireland and Scandinavia. Traditionally, these monuments are thought to relate to cooking activities throughout the Bronze Age though in recent years alternative functions have been suggested. Here results are presented from Lady Glassery Wood, a recently excavated site in the Kilmartin Valley. Samples for luminescence dating were collected in 1998, together with field gamma spectrometry measurements. Associated charcoal has also been subjected to radiocarbon dating, Despite and unusually low internal radioactivity from the rock samples examined, and low luminescence sensitivities from separated minerals, it has been possible to obtain concordant luminescence ages from both quartz and feldspars, giving a mean date of 2800 ± 300 BC. Radiocarbon dating produces a 2 sigma calibrated age range of approximately 2800 - 2400 cal BC, in agreement with the luminescence age, indicating a late Neolithic date for the mound, {{one of a growing number}} of early dates in Scotland. © 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|R
5000|$|The site {{includes}} over 85 features with lined and unlined rock fire {{pits and}} storage pits, post holes, <b>fire</b> <b>cracked</b> rock features, and a structure. Archaic structures {{have been found}} that date to the earliest Archaic and maybe to late Paleoindian periods. These earliest structures are round or oval, shallow, basin-shaped features about 4 - 5 m in diameter. Some have postholes. The best-preserved structures have interior hearths, bell-shaped storage features, and other pits in the floors. Residential houses were identified by floor features (fire pit, bell shaped storage pit and post holes) the pattern of outside features (hearth, storage pits and trash dump) the presence of certain artifacts (ground stone, bone needle, and stone knives) and the similarity to several other archaic features. [...] A wide range of structure types is represented in this time period. A cribbed-log structure covered with brush and daub has been excavated and reported. Daub structures are reported, as well as basin-shaped structures. Test excavations in the trash deposit of one village site showed almost two meters' accumulation of charcoal, ash, bone, and stone tool debris. This evidence shows that these structures were occupied throughout the winter season.|$|R
50|$|Peters Mountain mallow was {{discovered}} in 1927 by botanists who found 50 specimens. The plant {{was placed on the}} endangered species list in 1986 when a survey crew found only four specimens. In order to sprout, dormant seeds require <b>fire</b> to <b>crack</b> open and let water in. Cores from nearby trees showed that no fires had burned in the area for two decades. After a small blaze was lit in 1992 a few mallows sprouted. and later 500 seedlings were found.|$|R
40|$|Roll {{inspection}} in roll grinding shops {{is necessary}} to ensure that rolls being returned to the hot strip mill after grinding are free from surface breaking cracks and internal defects that may cause roll failure during service. Hot strip mills in finishing stands normally utilize cast duplex type work rolls in alloy indefinite chill double poured (ICDP) or high chrome iron grades and back up rolls of alloy cast or forged heat treated steels. Back up rolls (BUR) suffer from mechanical pressure cracks in contact stress zones due to excess work hardening. These cracks move downwards through cyclic loading, if not detected and removed by grinding, and cause roll spalls or catastrophic failures. Work rolls in hot mills are subjected to severe thermal fatigue causing <b>fire</b> <b>cracks</b> {{on the surface and}} other mill operational deviations and accidents inducing surface and sub surface damage in roll body. Surface cracks with a depth more than 0. 2 mm have to be detected and removed by grinding. Apart from detection of surface cracks with eddy current, other sub surface flaws, shell depth measurement, internal flaws in shell and evaluation of disbonded conditions at shell/core interface are done with ultrasonic. Back up rolls are tested with eddy current and ultrasoni...|$|R
60|$|Carley made {{no further}} comment. She assuredly {{recognized}} {{that what she}} had been accustomed to could not be expected out here. What she most wished to do at the moment was to get close to the big open grate where a cheery red-and-gold <b>fire</b> <b>cracked.</b> It was necessary, however, to follow the clerk. He assigned her to a small drab room which contained a bed, a bureau, and a stationary washstand with one spigot. There was also a chair. While Carley removed her coat and hat the clerk went downstairs {{for the rest of her}} luggage. Upon his return Carley learned that a stage left the hotel for Oak Creek Canyon at nine o'clock next morning. And this cheered her so much that she faced the strange sense of loneliness and discomfort with something of fortitude. There was no heat in the room, and no hot water. When Carley squeezed the spigot handle there burst forth a torrent of water that spouted up out of the washbasin to deluge her. It was colder than any ice water she had ever felt. It was piercingly cold. Hard upon the surprise and shock Carley suffered a flash of temper. But then the humor of it struck her and she had to laugh.|$|R
25|$|A static {{discharge}} {{in the presence}} of air or oxygen can create ozone. Ozone can degrade rubber parts. Many elastomers are sensitive to ozone cracking. Exposure to ozone creates deep penetrative cracks in critical components like gaskets and O-rings. Fuel lines are also susceptible to the problem unless preventive action is taken. Preventive measures include adding anti-ozonants to the rubber mix, or using an ozone-resistant elastomer. <b>Fires</b> from <b>cracked</b> fuel lines have been a problem on vehicles, especially in the engine compartments where ozone can be produced by electrical equipment.|$|R
