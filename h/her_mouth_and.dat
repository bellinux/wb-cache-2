5|$|To {{prove his}} innocence, Deodato had Luca Barbareschi get {{in contact with}} the other three actors, and the four of them were interviewed for an Italian {{television}} show. Deodato also explained in court how the special effect in the impalement scene was achieved: a bicycle seat was attached to the end of an iron pole, upon which the actress sat. She then held a short length of balsa wood in <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> looked skyward, thus giving the appearance of impalement. Deodato also provided the court with pictures of the girl interacting with the crew after the scene had been filmed. After they were presented with this evidence, the courts dropped all murder charges against Deodato.|$|E
5|$|Confronting Joyce {{about the}} story, Lois {{questions}} her intentions, with Joyce revealing {{that the two}} attended high school together, where she was known as Joyce Chevapravatdumrong. She also reveals that Lois humiliated {{her in front of}} the entire school, by placing a hotdog in <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> pulling down her pants while blindfolded (revealing her pink underwear), and has sought revenge ever since. At church the next day, Lois and her family enter, and are immediately demanded to leave by the preacher. Becoming extremely depressed, Lois is eventually coaxed by Brian to face her mistake by showing it to the church. The porno causes the church to reaccept her and admit the Griffin family back into their congregation due to a positive opinion of the film, much to Joyce's anger. Stewie in the meantime develops suspicions of having been conceived through the creation of the porno, heightened when he sees that one of the actors has a football-shaped head like his.|$|E
25|$|Cutting a straw or flower stem: An {{assistant}} holds a straw or {{flower in}} his or <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> the impalement artist attempts to chop the tip of it off. This is mostly associated with knife throwers and bullwhip artists.|$|E

25|$|What {{makes these}} frogs unique among all frog species is their form of parental care. Following {{external}} fertilization by the male, the female {{would take the}} eggs or embryos into <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> swallow them. It {{is not clear whether}} the eggs were laid on the land or in the water, as it was never observed before their extinction.|$|E
25|$|Hearing the commotion, Paules {{went down}} the hall to Taboada's bedroom and saw Rolling. She {{attempted}} to barricade herself in her bedroom but Rolling broke through the door. Rolling taped <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> wrists, cut off her clothing and raped her, before turning her onto her belly and stabbing her three times in the back. Rolling posed Paules' body but left Taboada's in the same position in which he had died.|$|E
25|$|The {{music video}} {{involves}} crowds of protesters in masks, holding torches whilst walking. Rihanna takes a bandanna from covering <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> performs the intro {{of the song}} in a park area with explosions firing around her. Jay-Z then begins the second verse while in a temple-like area. Kanye West sings his verse in a cave-like area holding a torch and having a bandanna cover his face like Jay-Z and Rihanna. Throughout the video, the trio are on a stage platform with the mob of protesters previously shown surrounding them.|$|E

25|$|Pathologist Luca Lalli, from Perugia's {{forensic}} science institute, performed the autopsy on Kercher's body. Her injuries consisted of sixteen bruises and seven cuts. These included several bruises {{and a couple}} of insubstantial cuts on the palm of her hand. Bruises on her nose, nostrils, mouth, and underneath her jaw were compatible with a hand being clamped over <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> nose. Lalli's autopsy report was reviewed by three pathologists from Perugia's {{forensic science}} institute who interpreted the injuries, including some to the genital region, as indicating an attempt to immobilize Kercher during sexual violence.|$|E
25|$|Later, Lavinia {{writes the}} names of her attackers in the dirt, using a stick held with <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> between her {{mutilated}} arms. Meanwhile, Tamora secretly gives birth to a mixed-race child, fathered by Aaron. Aaron kills the nurse to keep the child's race a secret and flees with the baby to save it from Saturninus' inevitable wrath. Thereafter, Lucius, marching on Rome with an army, captures Aaron and threatens to hang the infant. In order to save the baby, Aaron reveals the entire revenge plot to Lucius.|$|E
25|$|The mimicry of egg-spots is {{utilized}} by males for the fertilization process. Mouthbrooding females lay eggs and immediately snatch {{them up with}} their mouths. Over millions of years, male cichlids have evolved egg-spots to initiate the fertilization process more efficiently. When the females are snatching up the eggs into their mouth, the males gyrate their anal fins, which illuminates the egg-spots on his tail. Afterwards, the female, believing these are her eggs, places her mouth to the anal fin (specifically the genital papilla) of the male, which is when he discharges sperm into <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> fertilizes the eggs.|$|E

25|$|Nightclubbing {{claimed the}} number 1 slot on NMEs Album of the Year list. Slant Magazine listed the album at No. 40 on {{its list of}} Best Albums of the 1980s. Nightclubbing is now widely {{considered}} Jones' best studio album. The album's cover art is a painting of Jones by Jean-Paul Goude. Jones {{is presented as a}} man wearing an Armani suit jacket, with a cigarette in <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> a flattop haircut. While promoting the album, Jones slapped chat-show host Russell Harty live on air after he had turned to interview other guests, making Jones feel she was being ignored.|$|E
25|$|Bankhead {{received}} a Tony Award nomination for her {{performance of a}} bizarre 50-year-old mother in the short-lived Mary Coyle Chase play, Midgie Purvis (1961). It was a physically demanding role and Bankhead insisted on doing the stunts herself, including sliding down a staircase bannister. She received glowing reviews, but the play itself suffered from numerous rewrites and failed to last beyond a month. Her last theatrical appearance was in a revival of another Williams play, The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here Anymore (1963), directed by Tony Richardson. She had suffered a severe burn on her right hand from a match exploding while she lit a cigarette, and it was aggravated by the importance of jewelery props in the play. She took heavy painkillers, but these dried <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> <b>and</b> most critics thought that Tallulah's line readings were unintelligible. Like Antony and Cleopatra, the nadir of her career, she only made five performances, {{and in the same}} unhappy theater.|$|E
25|$|In {{the days}} {{following}} the Kearney attack, there were half a dozen similar attacks (See table), though none of the purported victims were able to provide a clear description of the prowler, and no clues were found {{at the scene of}} the attacks. The first specimen of physical evidence was found on the night of September 5, when Carl and Beulah Cordes of North 21st Street returned home around 10:00 pm. After spending a few minutes in the house they noticed a piece of white cloth, slightly larger than a man's handkerchief, sitting on their porch next to the screen door. Beulah Cordes picked up the cloth and smelled it. As soon as she inhaled, she became violently ill. She described the effect as being similar to an electric shock. Her face quickly began to swell, she experienced a burning sensation in <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> throat, and began to vomit. As with other victims, she also reported feeling weak and experiencing partial paralysis of her legs. Beulah Cordes later hypothesized that the cloth had been left on the porch in order to knock out the family dog, which usually slept there, so that the prowler could gain access to the house unnoticed.|$|E
60|$|As the revellers {{came back}} from Viceregal Lodge in the mists of the evening, they met a {{temporarily}} insane woman, on a temporarily mad horse, swinging round the corners, with <b>her</b> eyes <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> open, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> head like {{the head of a}} Medusa. She was stopped by a man at the risk of his life, and taken out of the saddle, a limp heap, and put on the bank to explain herself. This wasted twenty minutes, and then she was sent home in a lady's 'rickshaw, still with <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> open <b>and</b> <b>her</b> hands picking at her riding-gloves.|$|R
60|$|While muttering these words, Mother Rigby {{took the}} pipe from <b>her</b> own <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> thrust {{it into the}} crevice which {{represented}} the same feature in the pumpkin visage of the scarecrow.|$|R
60|$|Cynthia {{looked up}} at him, the corners of <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> twitching, <b>and</b> then she laughed. The Rev. Mr. Satterlee, writing his Sunday sermon in his study, heard her and laid down his pen to listen.|$|R
500|$|Back in {{the present}} day, Homer takes Maggie to bed, commenting on how the sooner kids learn to talk, the sooner they learn to talk back, and tells Maggie that he hopes she never says a word. But {{as soon as he}} turns off the light and closes the door, Maggie takes her {{pacifier}} out of <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> utters the word [...] "daddy", before going to sleep.|$|E
500|$|In his defence, Tabak {{claimed that}} the killing had not been sexually motivated, and told the court that he had killed Yeates while trying to silence her after she screamed {{when he tried to}} kiss her. He claimed that Yeates had made a [...] "flirty comment" [...] and invited him to drink with her. He said that after she screamed he held his hands over <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> around her neck to silence her. He denied {{suggestions}} of a struggle, claiming to have held Yeates by the neck with only minimal force, and [...] "... for about 20 seconds". He told the court that after dumping the body he was [...] "... in a state of panic".|$|E
500|$|The CT scan in 2006, led by Alexander Huppertz, the {{director}} of the Imaging Science Institute in Berlin, revealed a wrinkled face of Nefertiti carved in the inner core of the bust. The results were published in the April 2009 Radiology journal. The scan revealed that Thutmose placed layers of varying thickness on top of the limestone core. The inner face has creases around <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> cheeks and a swelling on the nose. The creases and the bump on the nose are leveled by the outermost stucco layer. According to Huppertz, this may reflect [...] "aesthetic ideals of the era". The 2006 scan provided greater detail than the 1992 one, revealing subtle details just 1–2mm under the stucco.|$|E

6000|$|Dennet {{screwed up}} <b>her</b> little <b>mouth,</b> <b>and</b> looked very demure, but she twinkled her bright eyes, and said, [...] "My heart will not break, sir; I am in no haste to be wed." ...|$|R
500|$|Kaali {{is portrayed}} mostly in two forms: the popular four-armed {{form and the}} ten-armed Mahakaali form. In both of her forms, she is {{described}} as being black in colour but is most often depicted as blue in popular Indian art. [...] Her eyes are described as red with intoxication, and in absolute rage, her hair is shown disheveled, small fangs sometimes protrude out of <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> <b>and</b> her tongue is lolling. She is often just wearing a skirt made of human arms and a garland of human heads. She is also accompanied by serpents and a jackal while standing on the calm and prostrate Shiva, usually right foot forward to symbolize the more popular Dakshinamarga or right-handed path, {{as opposed to the}} more infamous and transgressive Vamamarga or left-handed path.|$|E
500|$|After a bard, Marillion, composes a bawdy {{song about}} King Robert's death, Joffrey offers him {{the choice between}} losing his fingers or his tongue, with Marillion {{choosing}} to have his tongue cut out. Joffrey then leads Sansa onto a small wooden bridge {{at the top of}} a battlement and forces her to look upon the heads of her father and other Stark household members mounted on spikes. When Joffrey tells her of his plans to add Robb's head to the collection, Sansa defies him by wishing to see his own head mounted there, for which Joffrey has Ser Meryn Trant slap her. As Sansa contemplates pushing Joffrey off the bridge, she is stopped by [...] "The Hound", Sandor Clegane, who wipes the blood off <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> tells her to obey Joffrey for her own safety.|$|E
500|$|Later {{experiments}} were devised {{to test the}} mother-child bond with mothers who had themselves been reared in isolation as infants. This early deprivation {{was found to have}} retarded the mothers' emotional development and her ability to engage in intercourse and in turn become pregnant. In response, Harlow and his colleagues created an apparatus to impregnate these mothers they named a [...] "rape rack". Harlow found that once these monkeys gave birth, they cared little for their offspring writing, [...] "these monkey mothers that had never experienced love of any kind were devoid of love for their infants". While some mothers simply ignored their children, Harlow characterized others as [...] "evil" [...] and abusive and in some instances reported them [...] "crushing the infant's face to the floor, chewing off the infant's feet and fingers, and in one case... putting the infant's head in <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> crushing it like an eggshell".|$|E
