40|$|In the {{experiments}} {{now to be}} described, the repeated administration of 3 -methylcholanthrene exerted far reaching effects on the <b>endocrine</b> <b>system</b> and <b>metabolism</b> of the rat. Amongst the novel findings, it was learned that the compound causes a profound but selective depression of certain functions of the pituitary which is reflected in diminished growth of hormone-dependent structures. Moreover, significant metabolic effects induced by the compound {{were found to be}} reversible by appropriate modifications of the steroid status of the recipient. Further, evidence was obtained that 3 -methylcholanthrene depresses directly the growth rate of transplanted mammary neoplasms in the rat. It is known that certain cancers of the breast of human beings are dependent on hormones since these neoplasms undergo atrophy following suitable modifications of the endocrine status of the host; the regression of metastatic cancer so induced can be both profound and of prolonged duration. There are several methods of hormonal control which are effective and all of them were discovere...|$|R
40|$|Reproduction in {{vertebrates}} is an energy-demanding {{process that}} is mediated by endogenous hormones and potentially results in oxidative stress. The primary {{aim of this study}} was to quantify the relationship between oxidative stress parameters (antioxidant capacity and levels of reactive oxygen metabolites) and circulating testosterone and cortisol in a common and widespread teleost fish, the brown trout (Salmo trutta, L.). Results show that trout with higher testosterone levels prior to spawning have higher levels of oxidative damage at the time that they spawn (although by the time of spawning testosterone levels had dropped, leading to a negative relationship between testosterone and oxidative damage at that time). Cortisol levels were not directly related to oxidative damage or antioxidant capacity, but concentrations of this hormone were positively related to levels of fungal infection, which was itself associated both with lower antioxidant capacity and lower levels of oxidative damage. These results highlight the complexity of interactions between different components of the <b>endocrine</b> <b>system</b> and <b>metabolism</b> and suggest that caution be used in interpreting relationships between a single hormone and indicators of oxidative balance or other fitness proxies. ...|$|R
40|$|Osteonectin (OSN) is a {{glycoprotein}} {{which is}} implicated in development, bone formation and mineralisation, tumorigenesis, angiogenesis, and wound healing. Regulation of its expression by hormones {{may be one}} of the mechanisms by which the <b>endocrine</b> <b>system</b> affects bone <b>metabolism.</b> As a first step to understanding OSN function in fish, the gene expression of the recently cloned cDNA for sea bream, Sparus auratus, osteonectin (sbOSN) was characterised during embryonic and larval development. sbOSN mRNA was first detected by semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in embryos at early gastrula and its expression increased continuously until hatch, after which it decreased until 15 days post-hatch (dph), increased transiently until 24 dph and decreased thereafter. In situ hybridisation showed it had a differential tissue distribution which was age dependent. In general, sbOSN mRNA was identified in cartilaginous and calcified structures of both dermal and endochondral origin but its expression was not restricted to the skeleton. sbOSN transcripts were also detected in the skin, perichordal sheath, nerve cord, and kidney tubules...|$|R
40|$|Transition of {{the acute}} phase {{response}} to the chronic inflammatory state is frequently accompanied {{by the development of}} anaemia, defined as the anaemia of chronic disease [ACDj. ACD is associated with chronic infectious, inflammatory and neoplastic disorders and is a common cause of anaemia. The pathogenesis of ACD is complex and not entirely understood. Factors thought to be involved include inhibition of erythropoiesis, disturbance of iron metabolism and an impaired erythropoietin {{response to the}} anaemia. The induction of ACD is related to continuation of the inflammatory response, which might imply that ACD is an immunologically mediated phenomenon. Indeed, evidence has been obtained that proinflammatory cytokines are involved in the formerly mentioned pathophysiological mechanisms, although many of their postulated effects remain speculative. The purpose of the present thesis is to obtain more insight in the regulation of the acute phase response and the pathogenesis of ACD with respect to the role of cytokines, <b>endocrine</b> <b>systems</b> and iron <b>metabolism.</b> In tills perspective, the acute phase response and cytokine network are described in more detail in this chapter. Subsequently, current concepts of iron metabolism and the effects of inflammation are reviewed as well as pathogenetic, diagnostic and treatment aspects of ACD. Finally, the aims ofthe thesis wil be formulated...|$|R

50|$|The <b>endocrine</b> <b>system</b> is the {{collection}} of glands of an organism that secrete hormones directly into the circulatory system to be carried towards distant target organs. The phenomenon of biochemical processes' serving to regulate distant tissues by means of secretions directly into the circulatory <b>system</b> is called <b>endocrine</b> signaling. The major endocrine glands include the pineal gland, pituitary gland, pancreas, ovaries, testes, thyroid gland, parathyroid gland, and adrenal glands. The <b>endocrine</b> <b>system</b> {{is in contrast to}} the exocrine system, which secretes its hormones to the outside of the body using ducts. The <b>endocrine</b> <b>system</b> is an information signal system like the nervous system, yet its effects and mechanism are classifiably different. The <b>endocrine</b> <b>system's</b> effects are slow to initiate, and prolonged in their response, lasting from a few hours up to weeks. The nervous system sends information very quickly, and responses are generally short lived. In vertebrates, the hypothalamus is the neural control center for all <b>endocrine</b> <b>systems.</b> The field of study dealing with the <b>endocrine</b> <b>system</b> and its disorders is endocrinology, a branch of internal medicine.Special features of endocrine glands are, in general, their ductless nature, their vascularity, and commonly the presence of intracellular vacuoles or granules that store their hormones. In contrast, exocrine glands, such as salivary glands, sweat glands, and glands within the gastrointestinal tract, tend to be much less vascular and have ducts or a hollow lumen.|$|R

40|$|Adaptation of an {{organism}} {{to changes in}} the external and internal environment is in vertebrates brought about by two more or less separate integrative systems: the nervous <b>system</b> and the <b>endocrine</b> <b>system.</b> The nervous system is primarily equipped for rapid and short lived responses, the <b>endocrine</b> <b>system</b> for slower but longer lasting ones.
