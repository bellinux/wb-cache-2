On the other hand, when the delay is externally <b>imposed,</b> children are not able to wait as long when the reward is present, suggesting greater frustration under these circumstances.|$|E

An unprecedented incident occurred during the 1982–83 season when, {{in a game against}} Enosis Neon Paralimni FC in GSZ Stadium, three Nea Salamina's players were expelled and the remaining players surrounded the linesman to protest. The linesman, claiming to have received blows, was transported to the hospital where radiographs failed to show injuries caused by the players. After the linesman made a formal complaint, a court <b>imposed</b> a sentence of 45 days. This was unprecedented for Cypriot football.

The new regime, known as the Helvetic Republic, was highly unpopular. It had been <b>imposed</b> by a foreign invading army and destroyed centuries of tradition, making Switzerland nothing more than a French satellite state. The fierce French suppression of the Nidwalden Revolt in September 1798 was an example of the oppressive presence of the French Army and the local population's resistance to the occupation.|$|E
