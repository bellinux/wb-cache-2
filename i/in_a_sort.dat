25|$|Ludwig van Beethoven {{revolutionized}} timpani {{music in}} the early 19th century. He not only wrote for drums tuned to intervals other than a fourth or fifth, but he gave a prominence to the instrument as an independent voice beyond programmatic use.

Coelacanths are also known to swim head down, backwards or belly up to locate their prey, presumably using their rostral glands. Scientists suspect one reason this fish has been so successful is that specimens are able to slow down their metabolisms at will, sinking into the less-inhabited depths and minimizing their nutritional requirements <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> of hibernation mode.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The Nelson-Oppen {{combination}} method combines decision {{procedures for}} theories satisfying certain conditions into a decision pro-cedure for their union. While {{the method is}} known to be correct in the setting of unsorted first-order logic, some current implementations of it appear in tools that use <b>a</b> <b>sorted</b> input language. So far, however, there have been no theoretical results on the correctness of the method <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sorted</b> setting, nor is it obvious that the method in fact lifts as is to logics with sorts. To bridge this gap between the existing theoretical results and the current implementations, we extend the Nelson-Oppen method to (order-) sorted logic and prove it correct under conditions sim-ilar to the original ones. From a theoretical point of view, the extension is relevant because it provides a rigorous foundation for the application of the method <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sorted</b> setting. From <b>a</b> practical point of view, the extension has the considerable added benefits that <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sorted</b> setting the method’s preconditions become easier to satisfy in practice, and the method’s nondeterminism is generally reduced. ...|$|R

25|$|Their {{presence}} in the Mont'e Prama necropolis has been explained by Lilliu with two alternative hypotheses: the baetyls originated from a wrecked giants’ tomb or they are reproductions of more ancient specimens, due to a wish to preserve an ancient line of Nuragic tradition, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> of nostalgic commemoration.

25|$|Traditionists who {{account for}} the {{majority}} of clerics keep themselves away from modernity and neither accept nor criticize it.

Contrary to traditionists, fundamentalists openly criticize modernity. Moreover, fundamentalists believe that for reviving the religion in the modern era and for opposing modernity, they need to gain social and political power. This makes fundamentalists different from traditionists and traditionalists who are not interested in gaining political power.|$|E

The achievement, at age 23, was still remarkable in its context.|$|E
25|$|While these {{algorithms}} are asymptotically efficient on random data, {{for practical}} efficiency on real-world data various modifications are used. First, the overhead of these algorithms becomes significant on smaller data, so often a hybrid algorithm is used, commonly switching to insertion sort once {{the data is}} small enough. Second, the algorithms often perform poorly on already sorted data or almost sorted data – these are common in real-world data, and can be sorted in O(n) time by appropriate algorithms. Finally, {{they may also be}} unstable, and stability is often a desirable property <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort.</b> Thus more sophisticated algorithms are often employed, such as Timsort (based on merge sort) or introsort (based on quicksort, falling back to heap sort).|$|E

25|$|The {{scientific}} {{consensus is}} that the explosion {{was caused by the}} impact of a small asteroid; however, there are a few dissenters. Astrophysicist Wolfgang Kundt has proposed that the Tunguska event was caused by the release and subsequent explosion of 10 million tons of natural gas from within earth's crust. The basic idea is that natural gas leaked out of the crust and then rose to its equal-density height in the atmosphere; from there, it drifted downwind, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> of wick, which eventually found an ignition source such as lightning. Once the gas was ignited, the fire streaked along the wick, and then down to the source of the leak in the ground, whereupon there was the explosion.|$|E

The location of <b>a</b> desired item <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sorted</b> database can be found by classical queries that inspect one letter of the label at a time. For an unsorted database, no such classical quick search algorithm is available. If the database permits quantum queries, however, then mere digitization is sufficient for efficient search. Sorting becomes redundant with the quantum superposition of states. A quantum algorithm is written down that locates the desired item <b>in</b> <b>an</b> unsorted database a factor of two faster than the best classical algorithm can <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sorted</b> database. This algorithm has close resemblance to the assembly process in DNA replication...|$|R
