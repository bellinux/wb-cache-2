She had been unwell since the siege began, and Oan had asked <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>doctor</b> {{to be sent}} into the embassy to treat her, but the police refused. The other hostages deceived Oan into believing that Mozaffarian was pregnant, and Oan eventually released Mozaffarian after her condition deteriorated.|$|E

5|$|Those ransomed were valued on {{a sliding}} scale, ranging from around 1,875DM for a manual worker to around 11,250DM <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>doctor.</b> The justification, {{according}} to East Germany, {{was that this}} was compensation for the money invested by the state in the prisoner's training. For a while, payments were made in kind using goods that were in short supply in East Germany, such as oranges, bananas, coffee and medical drugs. The average prisoner was worth around 4,000DM worth of goods.|$|E
5|$|During {{spare time}} in filming, Tom Baker and Ian Marter (who played Harry Sullivan {{in the series}} and later novelised several Doctor Who scripts for Target Books) wrote a script <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>Doctor</b> Who film, Doctor Who meets Scratchman. The script, {{sometimes}} titled Doctor Who and the Big Game, saw the Doctor encounter the Daleks, meet the Devil known as Harry Scratch or Scratchman, robots known as Cybors, scarecrows made from bones, the Greek god Pan, and at times Vincent Price and Twiggy {{were associated with the}} production to play as the villain Harry Scratch and a possible new female companion after Elisabeth Sladen left the TV series. The finale of the film was to have taken place on a giant pinball table, with the Doctor, Harry and Sarah dodging balls as well as battling Daleks on the board. During his tenure as the Fourth Doctor, Baker repeatedly tried to attract funding for the film. At one point, he received substantial donations from fans, but after taking legal advice was forced to return them. The plans were eventually dropped.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the morning}} of 1 May, the gunmen ordered one of the hostages to {{telephone}} the BBC's news desk. During the call, Oan took the receiver and spoke directly to the BBC journalist. He identified the group to which the gunmen belonged and stated that the non-Iranian hostages would not be harmed, but refused to allow the journalist to speak to any other hostages. At some point during the day, the police disabled the embassy's telephone lines, leaving the hostage-takers just the field telephone for outside communication. As the hostages woke up, Chris Cramer, a sound organiser for the BBC, became seriously ill and his colleague, Sim Harris, was taken to the field telephone to negotiate <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>doctor.</b> The police negotiator refused the request, instead telling Harris to persuade Oan to release Cramer. The ensuing negotiations between Harris, Oan, and the police took up most of the morning, and Cramer was eventually released at 11:15. He was rushed to hospital in an ambulance, accompanied by police officers sent to gather information from him.|$|E

40|$|Objectives The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} whether <b>a</b> patient's preference <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>doctor's</b> face is associated with better assessments of relational empathy in the patient–doctor relationship after the first clinical consultation. Methods A total of 110 patients enrolled in a traditional Korean medical clinic participated in the study. Patients’ preference for doctors’ faces was assessed by a two alternative forced choice (2 AFC) task, with 60 different pairs of six different Asian male doctors’ faces. One of the six doctors then carried out the initial clinical consultation for these patients. The patient–doctor relationship was assessed using the Consultation and Relational Empathy (CARE) measure. Results The data of all patients’ simulated preferences <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>doctor's</b> face and their assessment values of <b>a</b> <b>doctor's</b> relational empathy was compared, and no significant correlation was found between both values (r=− 0. 024, p> 0. 809). Conclusions These findings suggest that the perceived empathy in the patient–doctor relationship is not influenced by the patient's preference <b>for</b> <b>a</b> certain <b>doctor's</b> face. The first impression of <b>a</b> <b>doctor</b> is often determined by his appearance and look. However, whether or not the patient particularly prefers <b>a</b> <b>doctor's</b> face does not seem to matter in developing a good patient–doctor relationship...|$|R

25|$|In transcribing {{directly}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>doctor</b> or a {{group of}} physicians, there are specific formats and report types used, dependent on that doctor's speciality of practice, although history and physical exams or consults are mainly utilized. In most of the off-hospital sites, independent medical practices perform consultations as a second opinion, pre-surgical exams, and as IMEs (Independent Medical Examinations) for liability insurance or disability claims. Some private practice family doctors choose not to utilize a medical transcriptionist, preferring to keep their patient's records in a handwritten format, although this is not true of all family practitioners.|$|E

25|$|Jones was {{rejected}} by all the Welsh universities, so he applied to the University of Edinburgh for an undergraduate degree, which had a closing date seven days later, and he was accepted onto a zoology undergraduate course. He stayed on in Edinburgh to do research <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>Doctor</b> of Philosophy degree on the ecological genetics of Cepaea, a snail whose shell is polymorphic in colour pattern, making it a model organism for evolutionary biologists. He developed an interest in snails from the late Bryan Clarke, one of his teachers at Edinburgh and subsequently professor of genetics at the University of Nottingham. After his PhD, Jones also completed post-doctoral research into the genetics of Drosophila at the University of Chicago to widen his experience. Much of Jones' research has been concerned with snails and the light their study can shed on biodiversity and genetics.|$|E
