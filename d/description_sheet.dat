50|$|From 1896 to 1901 the <b>description</b> <b>sheet</b> was {{introduced}} in Veenhuizen. The creator of this system was the Frenchman Alphonse Bertillon (1853-1917). He was {{of the opinion that}} on basis of accurate measurements, the identity of the individual could be recorded. On this simple theoretical principle Bertillon built a complicated identification method, in which body measurements were central. Because human individuals cannot be described in numbers only, additional descriptions on the <b>description</b> <b>sheet</b> were necessary.|$|E

5000|$|In NACMO (North American) style mounted orienteering and fox Oring {{only the}} general {{vicinity}} of the control point is marked on the map. In both sports the first objective is to navigate to the {{vicinity of the}} control point. Once there, the subsequent objectives are to find clues and take bearings, triangulate the location of the control point, then go directly to the control point. In mounted orienteering, once in the vicinity the competitor searches for clues (called landmarks) on a <b>description</b> <b>sheet.</b> The <b>description</b> <b>sheet</b> gives bearings from each clue to the control point. In fox Oring, once in the vicinity the competitor searches for a low power beacon at the control point.|$|E
5000|$|In orienteering {{competitions}} {{the locations}} of the control points are described on a control <b>description</b> <b>sheet</b> (or clue sheet). It is sometimes incorrectly referred to as a [...] "Course Description Sheet". For beginners, and the younger competitors, the description is written in a simple text format, but for advanced orienteers the descriptions use symbols (pictorial), in accordance with the IOF Control descriptions. These symbols eliminate any language-based confusion, vital for international competition. The control descriptions are fixed to or printed on the map, and separate control description sheets may be available at the prestart. Some competitors wear the extra control <b>description</b> <b>sheet</b> in a holder strapped onto their forearm, so that they can read it while running.|$|E
50|$|A {{control point}} (CP, also control and checkpoint) is a marked {{waypoint}} used in orienteering and related {{sports such as}} rogaining and adventure racing. It {{is located in the}} competition area; marked both on an orienteering map and in the terrain; and described on a control <b>description</b> <b>sheet.</b> The control point must be identifiable on the map and on the ground. A control point has three components: a high visibility item, known as a flag or kite; an identifier, known as a control code; and a recording mechanism for contestants to record proof that they visited the control point. The control point is usually temporary, except on a permanent orienteering course.|$|E

Fire and {{resource}} managers implemented the first prescribed fire within the Zion boundary within the ponderosa pine type in 1992 (US Department of the Interior National Park Service 1995 unpublished memo, on file at Zion National Park, Spring-dale, Utah, USA). Subsequently, the Fire Effects Monitoring Program at Zion was formally established in 1995 and still exists today. Fire managers delineated prescribed fire burn units within fire-adapted ecosystems affected by fire exclusion in Zion, including the ponderosa pine type. Burn units were then treated with prescribed fire {{to replicate the}} natural disturbance regime; fire monitoring plots within each unit were considered burned at that time even if the spatial pattern of the fire precluded a plot from actual burning. Personnel implemented prescribed fire treatments from March through June and from August through November, depending upon weather prescription elements described in the individual prescribed fire burn plan and vegetation type <b>description</b> <b>sheet.</b> While individual prescribed fire reports were not available for each fire included here, an example of burn unit size and weather conditions for a fall burn and a spring burn are included in Appendix A.|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{automotive}} manufacturing, {{quality inspection}} of spot welding demands excessive manual operations. Operators {{refer to a}} printed drawing of the testing body, with the inspection points marked on this drawing. Operators have to locate the matching spot on the drawing and the body manually to perform the inspection. Further more, different subsets of spots are inspected on different car bodies with a pre-determined sequence. This paper describes a system that projects visual data onto arbitrary surfaces for providing just-in-time information to a user in-situ within a physical work-cell. This system aims to reduce the inefficiencies and potential mistakes in manual inspection process. This paper discusses how spatial augmented reality and head-mount displays may be combined to display global information visible by all operators as well as personalized information to individuals. Further investigations on applying spatial augmented reality for spot welding inspections are explored, including four types of digital information projected onto the surfaces of car body parts under structured work environments: 1) Location of spot welds; 2) Inspection methods; 3) Operation <b>Description</b> <b>Sheet</b> (ODS) information; 4) Visualization of weld locating methods. Three visualization methods are used to attract operators’ attention to locate the position of spot welds efficiently. This paper also proposes a method to project augmentations on objects moving along an assembly line. The proposed system allows operators becoming more effective and efficient in performing proper inspections, by providing them the required information at the required time without the need to refer to paper-based manuals or computer terminals...|$|E

30|$|The natural {{evolution}} of this spacer {{passed through the}} artisanal form of an intraoperative manually molded spacer [9, 32] to use prefabricated molds during the surgical act [7, 8]. The latter offered the advantages of standardized modularity, to those obtained by a larger stem and a more regular articular surface. It had the inconvenience of consuming precious intraoperative time. The last product to come into use is a commercially produced antibiotic-impregnated cement spacer [10], the same used in our patient. It is also advocated to deliver a constant therapeutic antibiotic concentration locally {{over a period of}} 99  days [33]. To date, our patient is the first to benefit from this spacer, outside of the series by Coffey et al. This spacer was originally thought to be an intermediate step into the final arthroplasty in a two-stage procedure. The original product <b>description</b> <b>sheet</b> by Tecres recommended the spacer {{to be used as a}} temporary prosthesis for a period not exceeding 180  days. This was surpassed in our patient, as well as in the series by Coffey et al. On successive follow-up visits, the patient did not lose functionality, or complain of pain, and furthermore, her quick-DASH score improved over that recorded at 6  months. One explanation might be that the extrapolation from the lower extremity experience is not completely accurate. In fact, the shoulder, being a low impact articulation with no axial charges, is less demanding than the hip or knee, better tolerates, and erodes less the cement implant. Therefore, the largest follow-up on a patient treated with manually crafted spacer was up to 5  years with satisfactory results [32]. Other series report high implant longevity, in patients refusing the second surgical act, with a last follow-up between 20 and 28  months [7, 8, 10]. Also, Stine et al. [7] observed no intraoperative gross glenoid wear in patients opting for prolonged spacer implantation on the latter arthroplasty revision. However true, little is known about the cement–bone articulating surface, its degeneration, or its long-term results. As such, this option has been elected by the patients at the time of the second stage, not introduced by the surgeon at the time of the first interview, and was reserved to compromised patients. Contrary to other studies, our patient was explained the literature evidence at the time of the first encounter and opted voluntarily for the spacer as a prolonged/definitive solution. This decision was even more reinforced with the recent evidence from the latest series. No statistical evidence was found between the two-stage arthroplasty and the resection arthroplasty with the cement spacer in both functionality and infection eradication [10].|$|E

Here, we developed a multimedia {{tool to help students}} (1) learn botanical terms, (2) practice, train and test their knowledge of plant identification and (3) self-evaluate their level of learning. We generated an interactive dichotomous key for about 280 species of vascular plants from Belgium and the surrounding territories to help teach botany and plant identification to university students. To make the identification keys user friendly and appealing, we constructed databases with several thousand interactive links, including a descriptive and illustrated glossary (explaining more than 800 botanical terms with original drawings). This interactive multimedia dichotomous key includes family, genus and species descriptions, basic plant evolution and life cycles, as well as quizzes and tests.
