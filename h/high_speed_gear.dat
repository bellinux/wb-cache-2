40|$|The Geared Turbofan {{technology}} {{is one of}} the most promising engine configurations to significantly reduce the specific fuel consumption. In this architecture, a power epicyclical gearbox is interposed between the fan and the low pressure spool. Thanks to the gearbox, fan and low pressure spool can turn at different speed, leading to higher engine bypass ratio. Therefore the gearbox efficiency becomes a key parameter for such technology. Further improvement of efficiency can be achieved developing a physical understanding of fluid dynamic losses within the transmission system. These losses are mainly related to viscous effects and they are directly connected to the lubrication method. In this work, the oil injection losses have been studied by means of CFD simulations.

40|$|Lecturepg. 113 - 128 A 10, 000 psi high {{pressure}} natural gas injection compressor train was procured, manufactured, tested and {{installed in the}} Boquer?n production facility in Eastern Venezuela. The injection machinery consisted of three (3) parallel slow speed reciprocating gas compressors each driven by a natural gas driven internal combustion engine through a speed reducing gearbox. The equipment had been purchased in an early phase of the project by the original oil company, so {{it could not be}} changed. Due to the critical timing of compression required to maintain reservoir pressure and incremental oil recovery, the equipment could not be changed without large financial consequences. After preliminary review of the purchased equipment, it was recognized early by the engineer, procure, and construct (EPC) design engineering team that the compressor type and selection including the design were not the preferred arrangement. However, due to schedule and contract constraints the selection and design could not be significantly changed. Although the compressor itself was considered properly selected there was considerable attention given to the drive train. This drive train consisted of the internal combustion engine, a gearbox, a steel torque shaft that connected the gearbox to the compressor and an intermediate bearing/bearing support. As the project progressed there were significant design improvements made to improve the safety, operation, and life of the compressor train. The initial design of the torque shaft indicated that it would fail every time the machinery experienced a shutdown. In order to overcome such a failure the drive train included a special coupling with shear bolts that would shear every time the compressor train had shut down, the function of which was to prevent the torque shaft from fatigue failure. Shearing bolts during every shutdown was not considered safe or acceptable operating practice. During the course of the project, there were significant improvements made, first to the torque shaft, and then to the coupling connecting the gearbox to the torque shaft, then to the coupling between the engine and <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>gear</b> pinion. The torsional characteristics were improved significantly with the upgrades and design improvements. After installation, extensive field testing was conducted on each injection gas compressor to ascertain the torsional characteristics of the drive train, including stresses in critical components during the shutdown events. The data confirmed that the torque shaft was in fact designed for infinite life and would not fail from material fatigue as was feared initially. During the design phases engineering consultants were contracted to perform torsional studies to confirm the torsional critical speeds initially predicted by the compressor manufacturer. After installation the same consultant used strain gauges to measure the torsional shear stresses and the torsional critical speeds. There was an enormous amount of valuable engineering data generated during the design verification process and field testing.

40|$|During {{the design}} process, {{especially}} in systems where dynamic characteristics are crucial, modal analysis is {{an instrument to}} understand the response of systems subject to external loads. The presence of a resonance into the component operative range usually sounds like an alarm bell, and modal analysis highlights this. But modal analysis gives just an indication, only the calculation of a forced response provides the actual behaviour of the analyzed system. This is principally {{due to the fact}} that resonances are excited only if the mode displacements are directed along the exciting force direction. So, in particular conditions, modal analysis highlights possible resonances, but in actual situations they do not occur. Setting a particular geometry, veering phenomenon between mode shapes can arise, related to a design parameter. Mode shapes can deeply interact and change the response of the system. As a matter of fact, two mode shapes affected by veering can be in the operating range, but just one of them can be excited by the external force.
