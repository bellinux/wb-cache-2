[...] Marilyn was made into something not human in a way, and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>relate</b> to that.

500|$|Amelia Gentleman of The Guardian {{described}} Lohan as [...] "better {{known for}} what is euphemistically termed a party lifestyle" [...] and said that while her participation did bring publicity to the project, the attention was uniformly negative and about her person, not the issues. Of the documentary she said that [...] "the material is potent and persuasive", but that Lohan was a [...] "constant, distracting presence". Sam Wollaston of The Guardian wrote a satirical, mocking letter ostensibly {{from the point of}} view of Lohan: [...] "Some of these kids are sent to work when they're so young. Which <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>relate</b> to because I started out working as a child model aged three, and got into movies when I was 11. I can, like, so totally understand where these people are coming from".|$|E

David Veitch of the Calgary Sun {{compared}} the backing vocals to [...] "nicely old-fashioned shoo-be-doo-doos". Lyrically, [...] "Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know" [...] alludes to how Spears wants to hear her boyfriend say he needs her {{all the way and}} that he loves her. Spears considered it a [...] "pure and delicate" [...] song. [...] "It's just one of those songs that pull you in. That's why I like it, and I like singing it as well," [...] she continued. [...] "I think they wrote it 'specially for me, because the lyrics of the song, if you really listen... they're more of what <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>relate</b> to, 'cause they're kind of young lyrics, I think.

500|$|A washed-up former pilot {{called out}} of {{retirement}} by the Pan Pacific Defense Corps. On casting Hunnam, del Toro stated: [...] "I saw him and I thought he had an earnest, really honest nature. And {{he was the kind}} of guy that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>relate</b> to, as a male audience member I go, 'I like that guy. I would like to have a few beers with that guy' … he has an earthy quality." [...] Describing the character, Hunnam stated: [...] "When you meet me, in the beginning of the story, I've suffered a giant loss. Not only has it killed my sense of self-worth, but also my will to fight and keep on going. And then, Rinko and Idris, and a couple other people, bring me {{out of retirement}} to try to help with this grand push. I think that journey is a very relatable one. Everybody, at some point in their life, has fallen down and not felt like getting back up, but you have to, no matter how difficult it is." [...] Hunnam was also considered for the role of Prince Nuada in del Toro's previous film, [...] Paul Michael Wyers plays Raleigh as a child.|$|E
500|$|Timberlake was {{impressed}} by the amount of recording material Madonna would already have ready. He said that he does not normally write down his lyrics, since the ideas come faster to him, but Madonna had [...] "all these thoughts, riddles, poems, feelings, all written in huge notebooks ... she kept handing them over. It was amazing, taking these little bits here and there and putting them together like a puzzle." [...] For recording [...] "Miles Away", Timberlake played a guitar riff for Madonna and asked [...] "How do we want to do this? What do {{we want it to be}} about? What do we want to say?" [...] Madonna decided to have discussions between herself and Timberlake to develop other ideas for the songs. One of the ideas they connected on was the universality of long-distance relationships, which they felt was too personal for them, but nevertheless used the concept in [...] "Miles Away". Madonna commented on the recorded version: [...] "We put our stuff out there. [...] And after we did the song, everybody in the studio was like, 'Oh, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>relate</b> to that.'" ...|$|E
500|$|In April 2004, Clarkson {{entered the}} studio {{immediately}} after the Independent Tour. She said in an interview, [...] "I've written most of (the songs) so far, but there's {{some people who have}} some stuff for me. I'm not {{one of those people who}} thinks you have to write everything. (I'll sing it) as long as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>relate</b> to it." [...] During the album's development, Davis revealed that he was reluctant to let Clarkson write material for the album. He revealed, [...] "I always encourage people to write their own songs, but in the pop arena, where the career is totally dependent on hits, you get skeptical. Artists with great voices like Melissa Manchester and Taylor Dayne could have had much longer careers if they didn't insist on writing their own material." [...] Clarkson reiterates that she's been writing songs since her teens, but rather than argue over labels or abilities, the two reached a détente—she would co-write half the album, with the other half being penned by other songwriters and producers. She said, [...] "I just think it's funny that all these middle-age guys told me, 'You don't know how a pop song needs to sound.' I'm a 23-year-old girl! But I was fighting those battles alone." [...] In February 2004, Clarkson met with musicians Ben Moody and David Hodges, who had just departed from their band Evanescence in late 2003. She said, [...] "I didn't know that he (Moody) wasn't with Evanescence anymore," [...] Clarkson said. [...] "I just really liked their vibe and I thought it might be cool to work with one of them. So I just randomly asked people I work with, 'Hey, do you think that he'd work with me?' And then I found out that he kind of split and that's what he's doing... so it worked out perfectly." [...] Moody recalled, [...] "It's cool because she wants to do some branching out, and I'm doing nothing but branching out, we got together and she had all these songs in mind of what she wanted to do. It's just a really, really cool process for me, because everybody is a new experience. Everybody works differently." ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{describing}} {{the feeling of}} portraying a vixen, Budig also used the word fun; she cited her kinship with the character and how it differs from her role on Guiding Light. [...] "Michelle was young and naive. I'm sure I'm still a little naive, but it's hard for an actor who's older to play younger," [...] said Budig. [...] "You {{have to go back}} to being somewhat innocent, and it's hard once you're not to go back to being that way.

2500|$|The {{character}} of Jim Kurring {{originated in the}} summer of 1998 when actor John C. Reilly grew a mustache out of interest and started putting together an unintelligent cop character. He and Anderson did a few parodies of COPS with the director chasing Reilly around the streets with a video camera. Actress Jennifer Jason Leigh made an appearance in one of these videos. Some of Kurring's dialogue came from these sessions. This time around, Reilly wanted to do something different and told Anderson that he was [...] "always cast as these heavies or these semi-retarded child men. Can't you give me something <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>relate</b> to, like falling in love with a girl?" [...] Anderson also wanted to make Reilly a romantic lead because it was something different that the actor had not done before.|$|E

2500|$|When viewers {{realized}} that Willow was {{falling in love}} with Tara, Whedon remembered that some threatened to boycott the show, complaining [...] "You made Willow a fag", to which he responded, [...] "Bye.

[...] However, he also said, [...] "For every (negative) post, there's somebody saying, 'You made my life a lot easier because I now have someone <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>relate</b> to on screen'." [...] Gay characters had been portrayed before on television, and at the time the popular sitcom Will & Grace was on the air. Lesbian-themed HBO special If These Walls Could Talk 2 won an Emmy. Twenty-three television shows depicted a gay character of some kind in 2000. However, these other characters were mostly desexualized, none were partnered or shown consistently affectionate towards the same person. Willow and Tara's relationship became the first long-term lesbian relationship on U.S. television. Jane magazine hailed Willow and Tara as a bold representation of gay relationship, remarking that [...] "they hold hands, slow-dance and lay in bed at night. You won't find that kind of normalcy on Will and Grace." [...] Despite Whedon's intentions of not making Buffy about overcoming issues, he said Willow's exploration of her sexuality [...] "turned {{out to be one of}} the most important things we've done on the show".|$|E
2500|$|... "No Idea" [...] {{is based}} upon the film Inception (2010), {{specifically}} the scene where the character Dom Cobb has a dream relationship with his wife. Gaskarth said it was [...] "actually something <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>relate</b> to, as there is someone from my past I'm distanced with now and the only at I can revisit that time is in my dreams. It made for a cool song." [...] Gaskarth called [...] "A Daydream Away" [...] the [...] "kind of front porch, snare brushes and acoustic guitar slow jam I always wanted to write." [...] He added the lyrics were [...] "very personal" [...] and said it is a [...] "good song to put on when you miss somebody and just want to relax." [...] Gaskarth calld [...] "Heroes" [...] the [...] "no-so-find farewell closer" [...] that is also the [...] "most pop-punk song" [...] on the record, in tribute to their roots. He classed it as an ironic song since it mocks the concept of [...] "people idolising bands and all the drama that goes along with that when those bands try to evolve their sound as they grow up." [...] He said it was an [...] "important final song and point to make for this album specifically as we've really taken some risks and stretched ourselves." [...] The title of [...] "Merry Christmas, Kiss My Ass" [...] comes from the film National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (1989).|$|E
2500|$|... "Oops!... I Did It Again" [...] was {{considered}} as a sequel to Spears' debut album, [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] (1999), percolating with a carefully measured blend of familiar pop, funk, R and power balladry. Spears said during an interview that the album has a more mature, R-flavored pop sound. [...] "It's not something I changed purposefully", Spears said of the album's sound and added: [...] "It's just something that kind of changed on itself with me being older. My voice has changed {{a little bit and}} I'm more confident, and I think that comes across on the material." [...] One of its producers, Rodney [...] "Darkchild" [...] Jerkins talked about working with Spears on a Rolling Stones cover, stating: [...] "It's going to shock everybody", adding: [...] "It has flavors of the original, but it's a straight 2000 version — new to the ear. Which I think is cool, because people who appreciate that song are going to love it. And I made it so new and young that the young kids that love Britney are going to love it. It's going to grab both a mature and young audience." [...] Spears also worked with Robert [...] "Mutt" [...] Lange, telling MTV News: [...] "When you hear the song, it's so pure and delicate. It's just one of those songs that pull you in", and added: [...] "I think they wrote it 'specially for me, because the lyrics of the song, if you really listen … they're more of what <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>relate</b> to, 'cause they're kind of young lyrics, I think.
