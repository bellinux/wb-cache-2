Providers face problems of pricing and allocating resources to maximize revenue. Previous research proposed and analyzed a method for allocating resources based on joint optimization of access control and scheduling strategies. This paper proposes a tractable analytical model for joint optimization of <b>job</b> <b>pricing</b> and scheduling strategies {{with the objective of}} maximizing provider revenue. The paper provides initial results for the case of a single provider serving price-sensitive users whose utilities decay linearly with increasing service delay. The paper also shows that providers must combine both pricing and admission control to achieve maximum revenue. E...|$|E
40|$|Many {{practitioners}} currently use {{rules of}} thumb to price tasks on online labor markets. Incorrect pricing leads to task starvation or inefficient use of capital. Formal pricing policies can address these challenges. In this paper {{we argue that}} a pricing policy can {{be based on the}} trade-off between price and desired completion time. We show how this duality can lead to a better pricing policy for tasks in online labor markets. This paper makes three contributions. First, we devise an algorithm for <b>job</b> <b>pricing</b> using a survival analysis model. We then show that worker arrivals can be modeled as a non-homogeneous Poisson Process (NHPP). Finally using NHPP for worker arrivals and discrete choice models we present an abstract mathematical model that captures the dynamics of the market when full market information is presented to the task requester. This model can be used to predict completion times and pricing policies for both public and private crowds...|$|E
40|$|Carlos Garcia Céspedes, Angel Mencia and seminar {{participants}} {{at a number}} of universities In this paper we price caps and swaptions in the Spanish market with the Vasicek (1977), Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross (1985), and Hull and White (1990) (HW) models. We show that derivative prices obtained with the Vasicek and CIR models estimated from timeseries data are very similar, but they differ substantially from the values given by the HW model fitted to the term structure of interest-rate swap yields (especially for ATM and OTM options). However, when the former models are estimated cross-sectionally, they produce option prices {{similar to those of the}} HW model. In samples of caps and swaptions, we find that the Vasicek model estimated cross-sectionally outperforms the HW model. Nonetheless, the Vasicek and CIR models estimated from time series produce very large pricing errors. There are many ways of modeling the term structure of interest rates, many interest rate models, and many classifications of them. Some models describe the evolution of a given interest rate (usually the short-term rate) and will be consistent by construction with the current value of that interest rate. However, these models, in general, will not be consistent with the rest of the yield curve, and will not price “correctly ” (relative to the market) claims as simple as discount bonds; which suggests that the models will do a poor <b>job</b> <b>pricing</b> more complex derivatives. Some of these models use one factor to explain the evolution of interest rates (see, for example, Vasicek (1977) and Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross (1985)), while others employ two factors (Brennan and Schwartz (1979), Schaefer an...|$|E

40|$|Master of AgribusinessDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsArlo BiereIn {{the world}} of fast paced {{competition}} {{with a focus on}} profits, small businesses are always looking for ways to stay ahead of their competition. One way to maintain the competitive advantage is to join forces with another small business that sells and services similar products. Mergers and acquisitions have been very common in agribusiness since the farm economy collapse in the early 1980 s. Farms have been increasing in size, equipment has been growing in complexity with new technologies and size to keep up with growing farm size and equipment manufacturers are merging to create larger corporations that offer more solutions to the end user. Additionally, fewer machines are being purchased by growers and producers each year and the machines that are being purchased are able to do more than previous models. The new complexities require highly trained and skilled technicians to make repairs and service these machines. Farming practices continue to evolve with more limited- and no-till crop production. These factors are contributing to dealers forming larger multi-store operations with trade areas large enough to provide an adequate return on investment to attract the resources required to sell and support technologically advanced agricultural equipment. Large multi-store organizations support the requirement of customers by providing higher levels of customer service. As these large organizations increase in size they ensure a more sustainable business model with reduced fixed expenses leading to higher returns on sales and increased total sales. This study will examine two multi-store farm equipment farm equipment dealerships with a total of a total of eleven locations and make recommendations to create a merger of equals. The analysis will include a review of current sales data at each location and make recommendations for any new locations strategy using industry data as well. This information will help determine which locations should be eliminated or combined into single locations to reduce expenses. The study will also provide data to support implementing standard <b>job</b> <b>pricing</b> in the new organization. A new functional management structure will also be recommended to guide the new company towards increased sales revenues and position the organization for long term growth and sustainability...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{presents}} a decentralized {{supply chain management}} approach based on reinforcement learning. Our supply chain scenario consists of loosely coupled yield optimizing scheduling agents trying to learn an optimal acceptance strategy for the offered jobs. The optimizer constructs a mandatory schedule by inserting the requested jobs, which arrive stochastically from the customers, gradually into a production queue if the job yields a sufficient return. To reduce complexity the agents are divided into three components. A supply chain interface, classifying job offers, a reinforcement learning algorithm component, which makes the acceptance decision and a deterministic scheduling component, which processes the jobs and generates a preliminary state space compression. The reinforcement learning algorithm accepts offers according to their delivery due date, the <b>job</b> <b>price,</b> the timeout penalty cost, and the {{information provided by the}} scheduling component.

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{presents}} a yield optimizing scheduling system (YOSS) in a decentralized {{supply chain management}} (DSCM) environment. For this purpose we employ a DSCM scenario in which each supplier, provides system parts by order {{of one or more}} customers. The supplier tries to optimize its return by searching the optimal schedule for the single machine he uses to manufacture the requested products. The schedule is based on the suppliers knowledge about delivery due dates, accomplishment priorities and <b>job</b> <b>prices</b> associated to the production tasks. The optimizer constructs a mandatory schedule by inserting the requested jobs, which arrive stochastically from the customers, gradually into the production queue if the job yields a sufficient return. The tasks are finally executed on the suppliers machine following the fixed queue schedule. The objective of YOSS is to learn an optimal acceptance strategy for the offered jobs. For this purpose YOSS is divided into a deterministic scheduling component (DSC), which does the processing queue assignment of the jobs according to the delivery due date and timeout penalty cost and a reinforcement learning algorithm (RLA), which makes the acceptance decision using a job price- timeout penalty cost difference as optimization criterion...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} tenure driven {{productivity}} dynamics of a firm-worker match {{as a potential}} explanation of "unemployment volatility puzzle". We let new matches and continuing jobs differ by their productivity levels and by their sensitivity to aggregate productivity shocks.

Our contribution is to produce model driven stickiness of old jobs 2 ̆ 019 wages which does not rely on ad hoc assumptions on wage rigidity. In our model, an aggregate productivity shock generates a persistent productivity {{difference between the two}} types of matches, creating an incentive to open new productive vacancies and to destroy old matches that are temporarily less productive.

40|$|Quality {{of service}} (QoS) {{mechanisms}} allowing users to request for turn-around time guarantees for their jobs have recently generated much interest. In our previous work we had designed a framework, QoPS, {{to allow for}} such QoS. This framework provides an admission control mechanism that only accepts jobs whose requested deadlines can be met and, once accepted, guarantees these deadlines. However, the framework is completely blind to the revenue these jobs can fetch for the supercomputer center. By accepting a job, the supercomputer center might relinquish its capability to accept some future arriving (and potentially more expensive) jobs. In other words, while each job pays an explicit price to the system for running it, the system may also be viewed as paying an implicit opportunity cost by accepting the job. Thus, accepting a job is profitable only when the <b>job’s</b> <b>price</b> is higher than its opportunity cost. In this paper we analyze the impact such opportunity cost can have on the overall revenue of the supercomputer center and attempt to minimize it through predictive techniques. Specifically, we propose two extensions to QoPS, Valueaware QoPS (VQoPS) and Dynamic Value-aware QoPS (DVQoPS), to provide such capabilities. We present detailed analysis of these schemes and demonstrate using simulation that they not only achieve several factors improvement in system revenue, but also good service differentiation as a much desired side-effect. ...|$|R

40|$|Using the IMF''s Global Economic Model, {{calibrated}} to the European Union, {{the effects}} of reform in product and labor markets are quantified for both a large and a small euro area economy. When markups in these markets are reduced, there are sizable long-term gains in output and employment. Most of these gains accrue to the reforming country regardless of whether reform takes place elsewhere; conversely, spillovers of reform elsewhere are limited. Labor and services market reforms have transitional costs as they induce a temporary decline in consumption, but raising competition in goods markets can mitigate some of these costs. Thus, coordinating the timing of reforms across markets is beneficial, and the more so the more open the reforming economy. In addition, synchronizing structural reforms across large countries of the euro area could eliminate transition costs. Increased supply would allow monetary policy to ease without jeopardizing price stability objectives, though in practice uncertainty may prevent full accommodation.
