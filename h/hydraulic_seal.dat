40|$|Abstract: The {{development}} of reciprocating <b>hydraulic</b> <b>seals</b> radically decreased {{the efficiency and}} immensely reduced the seal housing volumes and also the overall economy of high pressure hydraulic drives. To reveal tribological behaviour of reciprocating seals {{it is necessary to}} analyse the relationships of seal design, tribological features and the main operating characteristics. For environmental protection leakage control has great importance. Leakage calculation of reciprocating high pressure <b>hydraulic</b> <b>seals</b> is based on the sealing pressure distribution profiles, i. e. diagrams which are playing an important role in research and {{development of}} piston and piston rod seals too. Key words: tribology of <b>seals,</b> reciprocating <b>hydraulic</b> <b>seals,</b> piston and piston rod seals, efficiency of friction seals, seal design. 1...|$|R

5000|$|A {{capillary}} seal {{is formed}} when the capillary pressure across the pore throats {{is greater than}} or equal to the buoyancy pressure of the migrating hydrocarbons. They do not allow fluids to migrate across them until their integrity is disrupted, causing them to leak. There are two types of capillary seal [...] whose classifications are based on the preferential mechanism of leaking: the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>seal</b> and the membrane seal.|$|E
50|$|The <b>hydraulic</b> <b>seal</b> {{occurs in}} rocks {{that have a}} {{significantly}} higher displacement pressure such that the pressure required for tension fracturing is actually lower than the pressure required for fluid displacement - for example, in evaporites or very tight shales. The rock will fracture when the pore pressure is greater than both its minimum stress and its tensile strength then reseal when the pressure reduces and the fractures close.|$|E
50|$|Rotary-screw {{compressors}} use two meshing helical screws, {{known as}} rotors, to compress the gas. In a dry-running rotary-screw compressor, timing gears {{ensure that the}} male and female rotors maintain precise alignment. In an oil-flooded rotary-screw compressor, lubricating oil bridges the space between the rotors, both providing a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>seal</b> and transferring mechanical energy between the driving and driven rotor.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to investigate the possibility of using electroactive polymer (EAP) materials to form actuators in layered polymer structures. Layered polymer structures can be incorporated into current applications such as <b>hydraulic</b> hose, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>seals,</b> and tires in order to monitor and correct the structure behavior. Design characteristics and requirements of o-ring <b>hydraulic</b> <b>seals</b> in particular were considered in the current research. Both a theoretical model and flat actuators were studied. Seven different materials were tested for use in the seal design, while considering electroactive behavior and sealing requirements. Several methods of preparing effective test samples were explored, along with the design of material stretchers. Testing included material property testing, which found that 3 M™ VHB 4905 consistently has an absolute maximum stretch ratio of 6. 8 : 1. In-plane forces were modeled using the Maxwell strain theory. Blocked force testing over a voltage sweep from 2500 - 5000 V was conducted using two methods, a normal force and a parallel force test. From this, the VHB produced a maximum force of 0. 245 N. Additionally, movement of different pattern electrodes and active areas was observed. It was concluded that based on observation FKM was the best performing polymer currently used in o-ring production. ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{acetabular}} labrum is a fibrous structure, which {{surrounds the}} femoral head. It forms a seal to the hip joint, although its true function is poorly understood. Recent evidence {{has demonstrated that}} this <b>hydraulic</b> <b>seal</b> is vital for maintaining stability of the {{ball and socket joint}} [...] and reducing contact pressures of the femur to the acetabulum. The labrum has also been shown to have a nerve supply and as such may cause pain if damaged. The underside of the labrum is continuous with the acetabular articular cartilage so any compressive forces that affect the labrum may also cause articular cartilage damage, particularly at the junction between the two, the chondrolabral junction. The labrum may be damaged or torn as part of an underlying process, such as FAI or dysplasia (shallow hip socket), or may be injured directly by a traumatic event. Depending on the type of tear, the labrum may be either trimmed (debrided) or repaired. Removing or debriding the labrum is becoming less popular as the latest research shows that results are more predictable in the long term if the labrum can be repaired. Various techniques are available for labral repair, mainly using anchors, which may be used to re-stabilise the labrum against the underlying bone, allowing it to heal in position.|$|E

It allows the in situ {{characterization}} of this clay layer presently studied as a reference host formation for the geological disposal of nuclear waste. HADES acronym stands for [...] "High Activity Disposal Experimental Site". HADES facility is operated by the EURIDICE economic interest group (EIG). The main tasks presently performed in the HADES facility are large scale demonstration tests. The on-surface Ophelie mock-up lasted 5 years (1997-2002) and was intended to study the thermo-hydraulic-mechanical behaviour of a bentonite buffer emplaced around a central heating tube simulating a high level waste (HLW) canister. Amongst other results, this experiment allowed to detect an important microbial activity in the bentonite buffer and in the water of the hydration system of the experiment. Concentration as high as 0.5 mM in dissolved sulfide and thiosulfate were measured in the water and microbially induced corrosion (MIC) was observed on stainless steel after the dismantling of the experiment. The next large scale in situ experiment is the Praclay experiment aimed at studying the thermo-hydraulic-mechanical behaviour of the clay formation at depth at the scale of a disposal gallery for a period of 10 years. The Praclay experiment is expected to start in 2012 after sufficient hydration of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>seal.</b>|$|E

Common examples include strut <b>seals,</b> <b>hydraulic</b> pump <b>seals,</b> axle seals, power steering seals, and valve stem seals.

50|$|To {{accomplish}} the double acting feature, additional <b>hydraulic</b> <b>seals</b> {{are added to}} internally seal off the individual stages. In addition, internal air or oil passageways are machined so that as each stage completes retracting, a passage is open to supply the next stage with pressurized fluid to retract. Thus a double acting telescopic actuator usually retracts starting from the smallest diameter stage to finish with the largest stage retracting lastly. Because the seals used to accomplish this must pass over these internally machined fluid transfer holes, the seals are usually made from hard materials to resist wear and abrasion. They are often iron rings or glass reinforced nylon seals.|$|R

40|$|The {{management}} of radioactive wastes {{is a significant}} environmental issue facing the international nuclear community today. The current international consensus is for disposal of higher activity waste {{from a variety of}} sources in deep geological disposal facilities (GDFs). Hydraulic seals, often planned to consist of compacted bentonite-sand blocks, are an important part of the closure phase of a GDF. As such, an understanding of the hydro-mechanical (HM) behaviour of these seals, and the ability to model and predict their behaviour is fundamental to support many planned safety cases and licence applications. Bentonite is well suited for use as a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>seal</b> due to its high swelling capacity that enables it to swell into voids while maintaining a low permeability sealed barrier to advective flow, and to provide structural support by generating a swelling pressure on the excavation walls. The hydro-mechanical process of bentonite hydration is a highly non-linear problem. As such, coupled process models that are able to account for the strong inter-dependence of the hydraulic and mechanical processes are employed to simulate the behaviour of bentonite under repository conditions. This thesis reports the development of an HM coupled model in the open source finite element code OpenGeoSys (OGS), and its application to the simulation of a range of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>seal</b> test conditions. The developed model couples Richards’ equation for unsaturated flow to a new strain dependent non-linear elastic mechanical model that incorporates a Lagrangian moving finite element mesh to inform the material non-linearity. Stress and volumetric dependent water retention behaviour are incorporated through the implementation of the Dueck suction concept extended to take into account non-recoverable strains during consolidation. A number of permeability functions are implemented and tested against experimental data. The mechanical model is extended to account for wetting-induced collapse behaviour by the definition of a failure curve derived from experimental results. Similar in definition to the Loading-Collapse curve in elasto-plastic models, this failure curve triggers the application of a source term to account for wetting-induced collapse. Coupling between the hydraulic and mechanical processes is achieved through the stress dependency of the water retention behaviour, the inclusion of a new coupling factor for the hydraulic contribution to the mechanical process, and the dependency of numerical convergence criteria on net mean stress. An explicit iterative calculation approach is employed. As a result, the hydraulic and mechanical moving meshes are decoupled to allow volumetric dependent parameters to be updated within process iterations. The model is calibrated and compared to experimental data from the SEALEX experiments conducted by the Institut de Radioprotection et de S ˆ uret´e Nucl´eaire (IRSN) at the Tournemire URL, France. The experimental programme comprises standardised laboratory tests, a 1 / 10 th scale mock-up of a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>seal</b> with a uniform technological void, and a full scale in situ performance test with a non-uniform technological void due to its horizontal geometry. Using a model with 5 hydraulic parameters, 8 mechanical parameters with an experimentally defined failure curve, and one coupling parameter, the major trends of behaviour in all the SEALEX experiments can be recreated, including axial stress build up, water uptake, and final deformation. However, the elastic method employed leads to an over prediction of the rebound on loss of axial confinement in the 1 / 10 th scale mock-up test. Simulations suggest that the non-symmetric technological void in the full scale performance test could have lasting effects on the development of heterogeneity in the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>seal.</b> The development of heterogeneity does not adversely affect the permeability with respect to the design criteria, but may have significant consequences for the development of a heterogeneous swelling pressure...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Fluid dynamic {{potentials}} {{are critical}} to the entrapment, distribution, phase, leakage and migration of hydrocarbons. The classification system combines two cap rock proper t ies (static and dynamic) wi th five seal and leakage modes (capillary <b>seal,</b> pressure <b>seal,</b> <b>hydraulic</b> resistance <b>seal,</b> water drive leakage and hydraulic fracturing leakage) and two hydrocarbon migration mechanisms {{into and out of}} a trap (fill/spill and fill/leak). Static cap rocks, such as thick shales, usually seal more than the vertical closure of the trap, {{as a consequence of the}} critical po re throat capillary pressure (capillary seal). In two-phase hydrocarbon systems fill/spill tends to concent ra te gas. Hydraulic fracturing is usually required to generate significant leakage through static cap rocks. Then fill/leak tends to concentra te oil. Dynamic cap rocks, such as inhomogeneous sand/shale sequences and faults have less sealing capacity than the static cap rocks, but are more widespread. They are strongly affected by variations in the fluid dynamic propert ies and are less dependen t on capillary pressure. Water potentials are often critical, for seal (pressure seal) or for leakage and redistribution (water drive leakage). <b>Hydraulic</b> resistance <b>seal</b> is important for trapping of oil and crucial for concentrat ion of oil relative to gas (fill/leak) ...|$|R

Theoretical analysis was carried out using Greenwood Williamson (GW) model for determining leakage, friction and Archard’s equation for evaluating wear in rectangular and U-cup seal profiles. Comparison of theoretically estimated data with experimental results for two seal profiles revealed good agreement.
