The article identifies a number of logistical and cultural constraints that complicate the <b>implementation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>funds</b> <b>of</b> knowledge concept in the Chinese context, including access to minority and city-born migrant students, guanxi, examination pressure, and cultural scripts for teaching that emphasize knowledge transmission.

Elective courses could provide the space for the deployment of strategies that draw on students’ <b>funds</b> <b>of</b> knowledge. The strategies proposed include neighborhood walks, artifact collection, and pedagogies for teaching that foster collaboration between teachers and students.
