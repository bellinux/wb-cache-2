Prussian <b>intentions</b> <b>were</b> unknown and could be hostile, the Russian and Austrian armies had converged, and French lines of communication were extremely long, requiring strong garrisons to keep them open. Napoleon realized that to capitalize on the success at Ulm, he had to force the Allies to battle and defeat them.|$|E

Afterward, the Poles went on to invade Galicia, with some success, but the offensive quickly stalled with heavy casualties. The Austrians also won a few battles but were hampered {{by the presence of}} Russian troops whose <b>intentions</b> <b>were</b> unclear and that did not allow them to advance. Eventually, the defeat of the main Austrian army at Wagram decided of the fate of the war.|$|E
5|$|Northumberland {{failed to}} engage, {{possibly}} {{due to the}} presence of the Stanleys, whose <b>intentions</b> <b>were</b> unclear, or due to the position of the marsh (or for both reasons). With his situation deteriorating, Richard decided to launch an attack against Henry Tudor, which almost succeeded, but the king's horse became stuck in the marsh, and he was killed. Fen Hole (where the boar badge was found) is believed to be a residue of the marsh. When Richard began his charge, Sir William Stanley intervened from the vicinity of Stoke Golding. It was here, on what {{came to be known as}} Crown Hill (the closest elevated ground to the fighting), that Lord Stanley crowned Henry Tudor after Richard was killed.|$|E

Some of Parsons' scientific colleagues rallied to his defense, but the case against him worsened when the FBI investigated Rosenfeld for being linked to Soviet agents, and more accounts of his occult and sexually permissive activities at the Parsonage came to light. In October 1951 the U.S. attorney decided that because the contents of the reports did not constitute state secrets, Parsons was not guilty of espionage.|$|E
5|$|The Dutch <b>intentions</b> <b>were</b> {{anticipated}} by the Spanish. According to Joseph de La Pise, a French jurist {{hired by}} Maurice's half brother and successor Frederick Henry {{to write a}} history of the Princes of Orange, Mondragón had learned of the ambush from English soldiers who had deserted from the Dutch colours, but the Italian Jesuit Angello Gallucci claims that it was Spanish spies who informed Mondragón, who had used spies to gather information on the enemy since the siege of Zierikzee, in 1576. In any case, the Spanish general took measures to turn Nassau's surprise into a trap. The convoy, normally guarded by 300 infantry and 150 cavalry, was reinforced by 300 musketeers and a large force of cavalry under Mondragón's lieutenant, Juan de Córdoba.|$|E
5|$|The Italian commander, Admiral Angelo Iachino, {{intended}} {{to carry out}} a surprise attack on the British Cruiser Squadron in the area (commanded by Vice-Admiral Sir Henry Pridham-Wippell), executing a pincer movement with the battleship Vittorio Veneto. Cunningham though, was aware of Italian naval activity through intercepts of Italian Enigma messages. Although Italian <b>intentions</b> <b>were</b> unclear, Cunningham's staff believed an attack upon British troop convoys was likely and orders were issued to spoil the enemy plan and, if possible, intercept their fleet. Cunningham wished, however, to disguise his own activity and arranged for a game of golf and a fictitious evening gathering to mislead enemy agents (he was, in fact, overheard by the local Japanese Consul). After sunset, he boarded HMS Warspite and left Alexandria.|$|E
40|$|Matthew Babb {{offers a}} strikingly elegant {{argument}} for, and explanation of, the essential indexicality of intentional argument. His two key thoughts are that intentional action always involves <b>intentions,</b> and <b>intentions</b> <b>are</b> essentially indexical. In particular, every <b>intention</b> <b>is</b> indexically about the agent whose <b>intention</b> it <b>is,</b> i. e. de se. In this paper, I set out two models on {{which at least}} some <b>intentions</b> <b>are</b> not de se – they are impersonal – and I show that these models are compatible with the data Babb points to.

30|$|Entrepreneurial <b>intention</b> <b>is</b> {{the feeling}} of having one’s {{organisation}} that is derived from personal and contextual factors Bird, (1998). Ajzen (1991) portrays {{that the decision to}} start a new firm is assumed to be planned for some time and thus preceded by an intention to do so. However, in some cases this <b>intention</b> <b>is</b> formed only shortly before the actual decision and in some cases the intention never leads to actual behaviour. Hence, entrepreneurial <b>intentions</b> <b>are</b> assumed to predict individual’s choice to found their own firms. Psychological research shows that <b>intention</b> <b>is</b> a crucial predictor of subsequent planned behaviour (Bagozzi et al., 1989). Consequently, entrepreneurial <b>intention</b> <b>is</b> a decision to form a new business venture that is planned rather than being conditioned. An individual may have the potential of being entrepreneur because of own competency and self-efficacy but may not make the transition into entrepreneurship {{because of the lack of}} intention (Krueger Jr et al., 2000).|$|R

In response to {{what could be a}} major attack, General William Westmoreland decided to build up the defenses of the Khâm Đức Special Forces, by sending in U.S. Army engineers to upgrade the local airstrip for sustained use by large transport aircraft, as well as airlifting weapons and ammunition for the U.S.-led Detachment A-105. Australian-led 11th Mobile Strike Force (MSF) Company was ordered to take up positions in Ngok Tavak (Ngok Ta Vak), an outpost serving Khâm Đức, to boost allied intelligence-gathering capabilities in the area. However, unbeknownst to the United States and other allied forces, the Viet Cong (VC) 1st Regiment had been watching the build-up around Khâm Đức for some time, and were preparing to initiate the assault by taking out Ngok Tavak.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} the first répétition générale of Giselle {{on the stage}} of the Paris Opéra, the danseuse Nathalie Fitz-James used her influence as the mistress of an influential patron of the theatre to have a pas inserted for herself into the ballet. Jean Coralli was required to quickly arrange a number for Fitz-James, which was arranged by Coralli as a pas de deux with the danseur Auguste Mabille serving as Fitz-James's partner. Coralli's original <b>intentions</b> <b>were</b> to have the ballet's composer Adolphe Adam supply the music for Fitz-James's pas, but by this time Adam was unavailable. In light of this, Coralli chose a suite by the composer Friedrich Burgmüller's titled Souvenirs de Ratisbonne to fashion music for Fitz-James's required pas. This pas de deux, which was dubbed the Pas des paysans (or Peasant pas de deux), became part of the ballet's performance tradition.|$|E
5|$|In August, the Viet Cong {{was back}} in action again; this time the 165th Regiment of the 7th Division {{targeted}} the Tong Le Chon Special Forces Camp, located southeast of the 1st Infantry Division's area of operations. Just after midnight on August 7, the 165th Regiment attacked Tong Le Chon {{and was able to}} penetrate the Special Forces Camp, but was forced to flee after an ammunition bunker exploded. That night the Viet Cong assaulted the base several times more, but on each occasion they were repelled by artillery fire and close air-support. By September, the scale of Viet Cong and North Vietnamese activities in III Corps had perplexed the U.S. commanders of Military Assistance Command, Vietnam. In the meantime, however, Hay decided {{to put an end to}} large-scale operations which had proven to be unproductive, until the enemy's real <b>intentions</b> <b>were</b> known.

5|$|In September 1940, the Atlantic, Milos, and Pacific, {{picked up}} 3,600 Jews from Vienna, Gdańsk and Prague in Tulcea, Romania, {{to be sent}} to Palestine. The Jews that arrived in Palestine came without entry permits and were {{subsequently}} denied entry by the British government, specifically Sir Harold MacMichael, who was the High Commissioner. The British decided to deport the immigrants to either Trinidad and Tobago or Mauritius, both British colonies. On 25 November 1940, the first ship carrying the 1,800 Jews to Mauritius, the Patria, was accidentally bombed by the Haganah, who wanted the Jews to stay in Palestine. Their <b>intentions</b> <b>were</b> to cripple the ship. There were 260 fatalities and 172 injuries. There were only enough lifeboats for 805, since the capacity was 805 when the Patria was a French ship. When the British repossessed the boat, they increased the capacity to 1,800 but still had the same number of lifeboats.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{with early}} April 1944, Stavka ordered the 2nd and 3rd Ukrainian Fronts {{to mount a}} major {{offensive}} with strategic implications in western Romania.

By 5 April, Konev's front had crossed {{the upper reaches of}} Dniester and Prut Rivers, captured Khotyn and Dorohoi, and approached Târgu Frumos and Botoșani regions—– northwest of Iași—facing only light Romanian resistance. On 8 April 1944, Konev ordered the 27th and 40th Armies to conduct a coordinated offensive southward along the Târgu Frumos axis, in close cooperation with Semyon Bogdanov's 2nd Tank Army. While Konev's shock group was advancing towards Târgu Frumos, Konstantin Koroteev's 52nd Army and elements of Andrei Gravchenko's 6th Tank Army, which were operating north of Iași, were conducting operations alongside the Iași axis in order to support Konev's main effort.|$|E

Marsh took this action to ensure that his elbow was kept straight and to demonstrate that he could bowl fast without throwing. Marsh had previously performed such an exhibition to ground members and the requisite splints and bandages were acquired from the nearby St. Vincent's Hospital, in order to bind his bowling arm. The hospital provided a medical certificate stating that Marsh could not move his elbow while encased in the splints. Marsh was proactive in attempting to defend the legitimacy of his bowling action.

5|$|The {{libretto}} {{was published}} in Mantua in 1607 {{to coincide with the}} premiere and incorporated Striggio's ambiguous ending. However, Monteverdi's score published in Venice in 1609 by Ricciardo Amadino shows an entirely different resolution, with Orpheus transported to the heavens through the intervention of Apollo. According to Ringer, Striggio's original ending was almost certainly used at the opera's premiere, but {{there is no doubt that}} Monteverdi believed the revised ending was aesthetically correct. The musicologist Nino Pirrotta argues that the Apollo ending was part of the original plan for the work, but was not staged at the premiere because the small room which hosted the event could not contain the theatrical machinery that this ending required. The Bacchantes scene was a substitution; Monteverdi's <b>intentions</b> <b>were</b> restored when this constraint was removed.|$|E

5|$|In 1327 Michael Shishman became {{involved}} in the renewed civil war in the Byzantine Empire, taking the side of his brother-in-law Andronikos III, while his grandfather and rival Andronikos II obtained the support of the Serbian king. Andronikos III and Michael Shishman met at Chernomen (according to Nicephorus Gregoras at Dimotika) and concluded an aggressive alliance against Serbia. The Byzantine emperor promised to Bulgaria territory with several towns and large amount of money if he would become a sole emperor. Based on that alliance, Andronikos III gained control of Macedonia but his success made Michael Shishman, who aimed at a prolonged conflict within the Byzantine Empire, enter into negotiations with Andronikos II, offering military support in exchange for money and the cession of some border lands. The Bulgarian ruler sent a detachment of 3,000 cavalry, commanded by Ivan the Russian, from Yambol to guard the Imperial Palace in Constantinople and Andronikos II but his <b>intentions</b> <b>were</b> to capture the old emperor and the city.
