25|$|Orpwood {{develops}} his {{mechanism by}} first {{addressing the issue}} of <b>information.</b> One unsolved aspect of qualia {{is the concept of}} the fundamental <b>information</b> involved in creating the experience. He does not address a position on the metaphysics of the <b>information</b> underlying the experience of qualia, nor does he state what <b>information</b> actually is. However, Orpwood does suggest that <b>information</b> in general is of two types: the <b>information</b> structure and <b>information</b> message. <b>Information</b> structures are defined by the physical vehicles and structural, biological patterns encoding <b>information.</b> That encoded <b>information</b> is the <b>information</b> message; a source describing what that <b>information</b> is. The neural mechanism or network receives input <b>information</b> structures, completes a designated instructional task (firing of the neuron or network), and outputs a modified <b>information</b> structure to downstream regions. The <b>information</b> message is the purpose and meaning of the <b>information</b> structure and causally exists {{as a result of that}} particular <b>information</b> structure. Modification of the <b>information</b> structure changes the meaning of the <b>information</b> message, but the message itself cannot be directly altered.|$|E
