5|$|Arkham Origins {{is an open}} world action-adventure game {{incorporating}} stealth game tactics. Batman can use his cape {{to glide}} around Gotham City and the <b>grapnel</b> gun's retracting rope to attach to hard-to-reach ledges and extend his flight. Some gadgets from previous Arkham games are present {{at the start of}} Arkham Origins, while others become available during play. Returning gadgets include the Cryptographic Sequencer, used to hack security consoles; the Batclaw, used for hooking onto surfaces; the Batarang, a throwing weapon; the Remote Batarang, its remote-controlled counterpart; Explosive Gel, used to destroy weak surfaces and knock down enemies; Smoke Pellets, used for stealthy exits and entrances; the Disruptor, which can remotely disable guns and explosive mines, and the <b>Grapnel</b> Accelerator, an earlier version of the <b>Grapnel</b> Boost. New equipment in Batman's arsenal include the Remote Claw; this allows Batman to target two objects and pull them together, allowing him to throw enemies into each other or hit them with objects (tethering two walled points creates a tightrope for Batman to cross); Shock Gloves, which allow Batman to block electric attacks, disable some enemies and stun shielded ones, and short-circuit objects, and the Concussion Detonator, capable of stunning large enemy groups.|$|E
5|$|The {{player can}} use predatory tactics through stealthincluding silent takedowns, {{dropping}} from overhead perches and snatching enemies away, or using the explosive gel to knock foes off their feetto tilt the odds in their favor. Some areas feature sections {{that require the}} player to use these tactics to avoid alerting the Joker's henchmen and thus failing to meet an objective. Many areas feature stone gargoyles placed high above, helping Batman remain concealed. Batman can use his <b>grapnel</b> gun to reach the gargoyles, giving him a high vantage point over the area and the enemies. From the gargoyles, Batman can glide down to attack enemies or hang upside down from the gargoyles to grapple a nearby enemy and leave him tethered there. The player can use floor grates to attack from below, hide around corners, use batarangs to stun enemies from afar, and use the <b>grapnel</b> gun to pull enemies over ledges.|$|E
5|$|The {{player can}} fly Batman {{throughout}} the city using his cape, with gliding now allowing for faster, longer sustained flights, steeper dives, and higher climbs. Batman can use some gadgets while gliding, such as batarangs or the line-launcher. The <b>grapnel</b> gun can now be used to instantly switch directions during a glide, {{as well as being}} fired twice while in the air to chain grappling moves together.|$|E

25|$|On December 4, 1999, the Borough of Point Pleasant Beach, New Jersey {{dedicated}} {{a monument}} to Lomell at the Veterans Park on Arnold Avenue. The Monument has {{a replica of the}} <b>grapnel</b> hook used by the Rangers at Pointe Du Hoc, which was given by the residents of Grandcamp-Maisy, France, along with a plaque detailing the contribution that Lomell made during the war effort.|$|E
25|$|In the {{engagement}} Crafty lost her fore- and mainyards, which fell over her starboard side. When {{she could no}} longer maneuver, one of the three Spanish vessels placed a <b>grapnel</b> on her rudder, holding Crafty fast. The other two then came alongside, one on the bow and one on the quarter. Craftys crew was able to repel the first boarding attempt, but had to surrender after the second succeeded in carrying her. In all, Crafty had lost three men killed and 14 wounded.|$|E
25|$|Daredevil's {{signature}} {{weapon is}} his specially designed baton, which he created. Disguised as a blind man's cane in civilian garb, it is a multi-purpose weapon and tool that contains 30 feet of aircraft-control cable {{connected to a}} case-hardened steel grappling hook. Internal mechanisms allow the cable to be neatly wound and unwound, while a powerful spring launches the <b>grapnel.</b> The handle can be straightened for use when throwing. The club can be split into two parts, {{one of which is}} a fighting baton, the other of which ends in a curved hook.|$|E
60|$|The Dutch captains drew {{off their}} vessels, and {{launched}} three fire-ships at the Henry. The first one, {{coming up on}} her starboard quarter, grappled with her. The dense volumes of smoke rising from her prevented the sailors from discovering where the <b>grapnels</b> were fixed, and the flames were spreading to her when her boatswain gallantly leapt on board the fire-ship, and, {{by the light of}} its flames, discovered the <b>grapnels</b> and threw them overboard, and succeeded in regaining his ship.|$|R
6000|$|But {{they had}} not yet {{completely}} failed. Hayton himself, and a score of sturdy rogues whom his whistle had summoned, were crouching for shelter amid {{the wreckage of the}} forecastle with <b>grapnels</b> ready. Within seven or eight yards of the Victorieuse, when their way seemed spent, and their forward deck already awash under the eyes of the jeering, cheering Frenchmen, those men leapt up and forward, and hurled their <b>grapnels</b> across the chasm. Of the four they flung, two reached the Frenchman's decks, and fastened there. Swift as thought itself, was then the action of those sturdy, experienced buccaneers. Unhesitatingly all threw themselves upon the chain of one of those <b>grapnels,</b> neglecting the other, and heaved upon it with all their might to warp the ships together. Blood, watching from his own quarter-deck, sent out his voice in a clarion call: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We shall want several lengths, Sir Robert, and two {{or three}} stout <b>grapnels.</b> We shall also want a strong chisel for forcing open a casement." ...|$|R
500|$|Batman: Arkham Knight is an action-adventure game set {{within an}} open world Gotham City, {{which can be}} {{explored}} freely by the player {{from the beginning of}} the game, allowing them to travel seamlessly anywhere within its boundaries. Many of the gadgets and the gameplay elements from the previous [...] return, including the <b>grapnel</b> gun, line launcher, batarangs, the countering system, Detective Vision and the Remote Hacking Device. The Disruptor receives upgrades from previous games, becoming a rifle that can be used to disable or detonate enemy weapons and drone turrets, booby-trap weapon crates to shock enemies who attempt to arm themselves, and tag vehicles for Batman to track. The remote controlled batarang is similarly upgraded to include a scanner that can be thrown out to gain information on the surrounding area. New gadgets include the Voice Synthesiser, which can be used to imitate other characters' voices such as Harley Quinn and the Arkham Knight to direct thugs into traps.|$|E
500|$|Some gadgets {{obtained}} in [...] are {{present at the}} start of Arkham City, while others become available during play. Most of these have improved or new capabilities; for example, the Cryptographic Sequencer, used for hacking security consoles, can also monitor shortwave radio channels, and the line launcher can now be deployed as a tightrope or alter direction during flight. Other items returning from the first game include these: a remote-controlled batarang; Explosive Gel that can now be detonated to knock down enemies in combat; and the <b>grapnel</b> gun, which can now be used while gliding to facilitate transportation. New items in Batman's arsenal include: smoke bombs that disorient opponents and assist with stealth tactics; a Remote Electric Charge (REC) gun that can stun enemies and temporarily power motors; Freeze Blast grenades that encase targets in ice and can be thrown into water to create makeshift platforms; and the Disruptor, which can remotely disable guns and explosive mines.|$|E
500|$|Batman: Arkham City is an open-world action-adventure {{game that}} {{incorporates}} tactics from stealth games. It is presented from the third-person perspective, showing the playable character on screen {{and allowing the}} camera to be freely rotated around it. The game is set within Arkham City, which {{is open to the}} player {{from the beginning of the}} game, allowing them to travel freely anywhere within its boundaries. The player can move silently throughout the game, using a combination of gadgets and stealth moves to sneak up on enemies and incapacitate them. Batman can use his cape to glide around the city, diving downwards and swooping upwards to extend his flight, and he can use the <b>grapnel</b> gun's retracting rope to attach to out-of-reach ledges. As Batman, the player is able to use [...] "Detective Vision", a visual mode that highlights elements of interest on-screen, such as character status, collectables, and clues; the mode is also used to perform forensic activities such as tracking the source of a sniper rifle round. The player has access to an in-game criminal database which includes forensic puzzles, as well as a network for hacking communication frequencies.|$|E
60|$|Five {{minutes after}} that they were board and board, the Jongvrow held tight in the {{clutches}} of La Foudre's <b>grapnels,</b> and the buccaneers pouring noisily into her waist.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} the earlier model Projectors {{remained}} in service and discouraged attacks in the Mediterranean by some smaller submarines, and a small number were adapted to fire <b>grapnels</b> for commando cliff assaults.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{is a good}} idea," [...] said Captain Covajos; and he {{told the}} chief mate to give orders to cast off the <b>grapnels,</b> push the two vessels apart, and set some of the sails.|$|R
500|$|Using an {{improved}} {{version of the}} [...] "Freeflow" [...] combat system from Arkham Asylum, the player can now counter multiple blows simultaneously, catch hurled projectiles, attack aerially, and administer a succession of consecutive strikes. Many of Batman's gadgets can now be used in combat. Enemies are armed with varying levels of armor and weapons; attacks from basic weapons like baseball bats and lead pipes inflict minor damage and can be countered, while guns inflict significant damage. Certain enemies must be disarmed in specific ways {{before they can be}} neutralized in combat: enemies with stun batons can only be attacked from behind; enemies with shields require aerial attacks to disarm; and enemies wearing body armor must be stunned with rapid successive strikes before they can be harmed. Larger enemies must be tackled with stuns and combo attacks, and can be manipulated to take out their allies. Disputes between gangs allied to rival villains often spark s, which complicate the player's ability to move about Arkham City. Combat, among other actions, rewards the player with experience points that allow the player to periodically level Batman up and purchase upgrades to his Batsuit, gadgets, and combat and stealth skills. Each category contains approximately 15 different upgrades. For instance, an upgraded <b>grapnel</b> gun can be used to remotely disarm enemies, while a combat upgrade makes it easier to activate special attacks.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are several}} methods {{for getting the}} divers to the wreck. The {{preferred}} method will depend on local conditions. In low visibility hooking onto the wreck is a reliable way of ensuring the divers will find it, but this procedure requires a wreck that is structurally suitable for snagging with a <b>grapnel</b> or anchor. A shotline which can be dropped off the wreckage {{is less likely to}} damage the wreck or become snagged and difficult to retrieve, but this requires appropriate visibility for the divers to be sure of finding the wreckage. When it is important {{to get back to the}} shotline for ascent, it may be tied to the wreckage by the first divers on site using a guide-line, which is retrieved by the last divers to leave. When there is a strong current, it may be necessary to drop in from up-current, a technique sometimes known as [...] "parachuting in" [...] or [...] "free drop". The wreck may be first marked with a shotline, if this is considered useful or necessary. [...] Divers may surface on the shotline, anchorline or personal DSMB depending on the conditions.|$|E

6000|$|... "Although we rowed in {{to within}} an oar's {{length of the}} cliff, there was eight fathoms of water when we dropped the <b>grapnels.</b> We had been lying there an hour when the third {{lieutenant}} said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I were you, sir, I'd {{cast off}} those <b>grapnels,</b> and {{separate}} the vessels. If we don't do that those rascals, {{when they have}} finished robbing our money-chests, will {{come back here and}} murder us all." ...|$|R
50|$|Since Pyrrhus' {{elephants}} {{had caused}} much terror and destruction in the Battle of Heraclea, the Romans devised special wagons against them. They were four-wheeled and had poles mounted transversely on upright beams. They could be swung in any direction. Some had iron tridents, spikes or scythes and some had ‘cranes that hurled down heavy grappling irons’. Many poles protruded {{in front of}} the wagons and had fire-bearing <b>grapnels</b> wrapped in cloth daubed with pitch. The wagons carried bowmen, hurlers of stones and slingers who threw iron caltrops and men who threw <b>grapnels</b> on fire against the trunks and faces of the elephants. The Romans had 300 such wagons.|$|R
60|$|The <b>grapnel</b> {{was again}} lowered. Its smart {{impact upon the}} distant water reached their ears like a kiss, whereupon Yeobright knelt down, and leaning over the well began {{dragging}} the <b>grapnel</b> round and round as Fairway had done.|$|E
60|$|They {{now made}} their way along {{to the end of}} the roof. The <b>grapnel</b> was fixed, and Edgar slid down the rope to the next roof, which was some fifteen feet below them. They did not attempt to free the <b>grapnel,</b> fearing that in its fall it might make a clatter; they {{therefore}} used another to mount to the next house, which was as high as that which they had left. There was but a difference of four feet in the height of the next, and they had not to use the <b>grapnel</b> again until they reached the sixth house, which was ten feet below that next to it.|$|E
6000|$|I {{shook my}} head vigorously, and saying, [...] "No more! no more!" [...] threw myself over the wall, and seized the rope, Rectus holding the <b>grapnel</b> in its place as I did so. As I let myself down from knot to knot, a thought crossed my mind: [...] "How {{are we going to}} get that <b>grapnel</b> after we both are down?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "On, now, Jeremy!" [...] cried Blood. [...] "Straight {{into them}} before they recover their wits. Stand by, there! Prepare to board! Hayton ... the <b>grapnels!</b> And pass the word to the gunner in the prow to fire {{as fast as he}} can load." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{ropes of}} the <b>grapnels</b> were cut, and slowly the galleon passed {{away into the}} night, leaving the galley to replace what slaves had been maimed in the {{encounter}} and to head back for Algiers, abandoning the expedition against the argosy of Spain.|$|R
60|$|Two hours did the <b>grapnels</b> descend {{before they}} reached {{the bottom of the}} sea! All night did the cable-layers fish, with the {{characteristic}} patience of fishermen, but did not get a nibble. Towards morning, however, there was a decided bite, and the line became taut.|$|R
6000|$|... “There is not {{a moment}} to lose,” Will said as he followed, and he at once lifted up the false bottom {{and pulled out the}} rope and <b>grapnel.</b> He had knotted the rope about every foot, to assist the {{prisoner}} in climbing, and had covered the iron of the <b>grapnel</b> with strips of flannel so that it would make no noise when it struck the wall.|$|E
60|$|They {{were now}} {{running up the}} Ray {{in pursuit of the}} boat, which had drifted into {{shallower}} water {{near the end of the}} island, and here the <b>grapnel</b> had brought it up. When they got up to it, the <b>grapnel</b> was raised and brought into the stern of the boat, and the coast-guard boat laid her course close-hauled for Leigh, towing the other behind her.|$|E
60|$|According to the {{instructions}} Browne {{had given him}} he fastened {{the end of the}} rope which was round Browne's body under his own shoulders, then leaning over and taking a firm hold of the rope to which the <b>grapnel</b> was attached, he let himself out of the window. Browne hauled from above at the rope round his body, and he pulled himself with his hands by that attached to the <b>grapnel,</b> and presently reached the top.|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{not much}} tide in these low latitudes, and the little rise that is left may help us off a bank, should we strike one. If you will get upon the roof, I will bring in the <b>grapnels</b> and force the boat off." ...|$|R
60|$|Twice {{when the}} vessels were coming down before {{the wind at}} a rate of speed that {{rendered}} it evident that the efforts of the men at the oars would be insufficient to turn her course, the Fan Fan was steered alongside, <b>grapnels</b> were thrown, and, headed by Lord Oliphant and Cyril, the crew sprang on board, cut down or drove overboard the few men who were in charge of her. Then, taking the helm and trimming the sails, they directed her against one of the Dutch men-of-war, threw the <b>grapnels</b> on board, lighted the train, leapt back into the Fan Fan, rowed away, and took up their place near the Admiral, the little craft being greeted with hearty cheers by the whole ship's company.|$|R
6000|$|Now comes it! The [...] "Santisima Trinidad," [...] The old [...] "Redoubtable's" [...] hard sides, and ours, [...] Will {{take the}} touse of this bombastic blow. [...] Your <b>grapnels</b> and your boarding-hatchets--ready! [...] We'll dash our eagle on the English deck, [...] And swear to fetch it! ...|$|R
