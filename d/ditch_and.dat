5|$|There {{are three}} {{identifiable}} periods of medieval activity at Buckton Castle: the initial construction phase, {{which resulted in}} the creation of the <b>ditch</b> <b>and</b> the building of the curtain wall and gatehouse; the re-cutting of the <b>ditch</b> <b>and</b> further building work behind the curtain wall; and finally deliberate demolition (slighting). The castle is first mentioned in 1360, and little datable material has been recovered from the site four sherds of Pennine Gritty Ware broadly dated to the late 12th century.|$|E
5|$|Isa ibn Musa, the Caliph's nephew, {{was sent}} against Medina with 4,000 men, but Muhammad refused {{to abandon the}} holy city and insisted on meeting the Abbasid attack there. In the meantime, he imitated the actions of Muhammad, like {{restoring}} the famous ditch around the city. Muhammad's supporters nevertheless began deserting him. When Isa appeared before the city, he waited {{a few days before}} the <b>ditch</b> <b>and</b> repeatedly offered amnesty. Then his troops laid a few doors over the <b>ditch</b> <b>and</b> entered Medina, where Muhammad and his remaining 300 supporters fell fighting on 6 December 762. Muhammad's corpse was beheaded and his head dispatched to the Caliph.|$|E
5|$|About {{eight miles}} from Brechin, at Karboddo , a place {{belongs to the}} Earl of Crawford, are to be seen the vestiges of a Danish camp, {{fortified}} with a rampart and <b>ditch,</b> <b>and</b> vulgarly called Norway Dikes; near which is the village of Panbridge , where anciently was a church dedicated to St Brigide, because on that saint's day which preceded the battle, Camus, general of the Danes, pitched his camp there.|$|E
50|$|The hillfort of Whitsbury Castle (also {{known as}} Castle <b>Ditches</b> <b>and</b> Whitsbury Camp) covers sixteen acres. It has two large ramparts with outer <b>ditches</b> <b>and</b> an {{additional}} counter scarp bank on northern half. Some {{parts of the}} earthworks were destroyed {{to make way for}} a post-medieval manor house.|$|R

5|$|Archaeological {{excavations}} in {{the winter}} of 2010–11 rediscovered the remains of the old castle wall and <b>ditch,</b> <b>and</b> more than 400 artefacts were removed for storage at the Isle of Wight County Museum. Cowes Castle is a distinctive landmark in yachting and powerboat events, particularly at the start and finish of local races. It is protected under UK law as a 2* Listed Building.|$|E
5|$|Between 1793 and 1795, Saint Lucian Tower and its battery were {{strengthened}} with a <b>ditch</b> <b>and</b> an entrenchment-like enclosure, and {{the complex}} was renamed Fort Rohan after the reigning Grand Master, Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc. Most of the fortifications, {{with the exception}} of the tower itself, were dismantled and rebuilt by the British later on in the 19th century and the name Fort Rohan fell into disuse.|$|E
5|$|During the 13th and 14th centuries the barbican was developed. This {{consisted}} of a rampart, <b>ditch,</b> <b>and</b> possibly a tower, {{in front of the}} gatehouse which could be used to further protect the entrance. The purpose of a barbican was not just to provide another line of defence but also to dictate the only approach to the gate.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 18th century several duck decoys were {{built on the}} moor. These {{consisted}} of {{a pool of water}} leading from which are from one to eight curving, tapering ditches. Over each ditch is a series of hoops, initially made from wood, later from iron, which diminish in size as the ditch tapers. The hoops are covered in netting. The combination of <b>ditch</b> <b>and</b> net-covered hoops is known as a pipe.|$|E
5|$|Shrewsbury's known history commences in the Early Middle Ages, {{having been}} founded c. 800 AD. It is {{believed}} that Anglo-Saxon Shrewsbury was most probably a settlement fortified {{through the use of}} earthworks comprising a <b>ditch</b> <b>and</b> rampart, which were then shored up with a wooden stockade. There is evidence to show that {{by the beginning of the}} 900s, Shrewsbury was home to a mint.|$|E
5|$|The Great Circle was {{surrounded}} by a <b>ditch</b> <b>and</b> is accompanied by smaller stone circles to the north east and south west. There is also a group of three stones, known as The Cove, in the garden of the local pub. Slightly further from the Great Circle is a single stone, known as Hautville's Quoit. Some of the stones are still vertical, but the majority are now recumbent and some are no longer present.|$|E
50|$|Baker is from West Annistion, Alabama {{the town}} where he grew up. As children, he {{and his younger brother}} Terry would throw rocks and shoot bow and arrows around the <b>ditches</b> <b>and</b> {{surrounding}} trees. They would play in <b>ditches</b> <b>and</b> cross the water in the ditches that were used for the Monsanto plant run-off.|$|R

5|$|The {{shoreline}} of Harveys Lake {{is entirely}} {{surrounded by a}} paved road, which is atypical for a lake shoreline. Homes and cottages are situated on the road opposite the lake, and significant development {{has occurred in the}} vicinity of the lake. A <b>ditch</b> <b>and</b> outlet drainage structure made of concrete at Wardens Place drains into the lake; its purpose is to control small-scale local road flooding.|$|E
5|$|The two gates {{into the}} city, Mdina Gate and Greeks Gate, are {{located within the}} curtain walls of the land front. Remains of the medieval double walls {{as well as the}} 18th-century Torre dello Standardo are located just within the city walls. The land front is {{surrounded}} by a deep <b>ditch,</b> <b>and</b> a traverse-like battery is located in its eastern extremity.|$|E
5|$|A 20-foot (6 m) wide ditch was dug at {{the north}} end of the moat to prevent tanks from {{breaking}} through and following the track south past the castle, and a 545-foot by 151-foot (166 m by 46 m) wide anti-personnel minefield was laid to the south-west to prevent infantry soldiers from circumventing the castle's defences and advancing down into Craster. After the end of the war, the barbed wire was cleared away from the beaches by local Italian prisoners of war, although the two pillboxes, the remnants of the anti-tank <b>ditch</b> <b>and</b> some of the trenches and weapons pits still remain.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{original}} plan had been to demolish the old fortifications of Rethymno and move the inhabitants into the Fortezza, it {{was too small to}} house the entire city. The walls along the landward approach to the city were left intact, and the Fortezza became a citadel housing the Venetian administration of the city. It was only to be used by the inhabitants of the city {{in the case of an}} Ottoman invasion. Over the years, a number of modifications were made to the fortress. Nonetheless, it was never truly secure as it lacked a <b>ditch</b> <b>and</b> outworks, and the ramparts were rather low.|$|E
5|$|By 1300, Southampton was a {{major port}} and a large provincial town, with a {{population}} of around 5,000. In 1338 there was a successful French attack on Southampton, burning various buildings down and damaging the castle. Edward III responded by improving the quality of the town defences, including building walls along the old <b>ditch</b> <b>and</b> bank defences, and particularly focusing on improving {{the west side of the}} town, but little work appears to have been done to improve the castle itself. By the middle of the 14th century, Southampton Castle sat alongside one and a quarter miles (2 km) of town walls, although the castle and the walls were kept administratively separate.|$|E
5|$|Castles, in {{the sense}} of a {{fortified}} residence of a lord or noble, arrived in Scotland as part of David I's encouragement of Norman and French nobles to settle with feudal tenures, particularly in the south and east, and were a way of controlling the contested lowlands. These were primarily wooden motte-and-bailey constructions, of a raised mount or motte, surmounted by a wooden tower and a larger adjacent enclosure or bailey, both usually surrounded by a fosse (a <b>ditch)</b> <b>and</b> palisade, and connected by a wooden bridge. They varied in size from the very large such as the Bass of Inverurie, to more modest designs like Balmaclellan.|$|E

5|$|Italian gun {{positions}} were located using sound ranging by the British 6th Survey Regiment, Royal Artillery. These positions disclosed themselves by firing at Australian patrols, which now went out nightly, mapping the antitank <b>ditch</b> <b>and</b> {{the barbed wire}} obstacles. Aerial photographs of the {{positions were}} taken by Westland Lysander aircraft of No. 208 Squadron RAF, escorted by Gloster Gladiator biplane fighters of No. 3 Squadron RAAF. British Intelligence estimated {{the strength of the}} Italian garrison at 20 to 23,000 with 100 guns, and discounted reports of six medium and seventy light tanks as exaggerated—a serious intelligence failure.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the storm}} {{weakened}} considerably from its peak intensity, damage {{was much less}} than initially anticipated. In all, damages from the storm amounted to 15billion (2001 JPY, $140million USD). Three people {{were killed by the}} storm, all of whom were found in irrigation ditches. The first fatality was an 81-year-old man, the second was a 30-year-old man who lost control of his car and crashed into a <b>ditch,</b> <b>and</b> the last fatality was a 3-year-old boy who fell in a ditch near his home. Two 11-year-old boys, initially reported as missing, were later found in a ditch after being swept away by flood waters.|$|E
5|$|The Confederate army {{made several}} other {{attempts}} {{to cross the}} trench during the night but repeatedly failed. Although the confederates could have deployed their infantry over the whole length of the trench, they were unwilling to engage the Muslims at close quarter as the former regarded the latter as superior in hand-to-hand fighting. As the Muslim army was well dug in behind the embankment made from the earth which {{had been taken from}} the <b>ditch</b> <b>and</b> prepared to bombard attackers with stones and arrows, any attack could cause great casualties.|$|E
