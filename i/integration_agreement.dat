40|$|Using a panel dataset of {{bilateral}} flows of banking sector {{foreign direct investment}} (FDI) in developed and developing countries, we study the impact of regional <b>integration</b> <b>agreements</b> (RIAs) on the location of banking sector FDI. The {{results indicate that the}} impact of RIAs vary depending on different kinds of regional integration. The response to integration between developed countries (North-North integration) may differ from the response to integration between developing countries (South-South integration) or to an agreement between countries at different levels of development (North-South integration), depending on the significance and nature of environmental change brought about by the RIAs, the locational advantage of the country or region and the degree of integration at the outset. The RIAs between developed countries had relatively little influence on foreign bank entry, since much of the financial service trade between the member countries had been liberalized long before the agreement was established. By contrast, North-South <b>integration</b> <b>agreements</b> and South-South <b>integration</b> <b>agreements</b> brought about significant region’s policy environment changes and more proximity institutional, which suggests that they may have a notable (although varying) impact on banking sector FDI in the member countries...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the 'competitive liberalisation' of {{national}} governments of {{the past several decades}} reflects national governments' expectations of larger trade impacts from regional economic <b>integration</b> <b>agreements</b> (EIAs) than typical ex ante economic models have suggested. Moreover, we show that previous (typically cross-section) ex post empirical evaluations of the effects of EIAs on trade have seriously over- or underestimated the effects, partly due to ignoring the (endogenous) self-selection bias of country pairs into EIAs. Accounting for this bias, we find that economic <b>integration</b> <b>agreements</b> in the Americas have had much larger impacts on trade over the period 1960 - 2000 than previously found and the ex post estimates are less fragile than those in earlier cross-section analyses. The results shed further light on understanding the causes and consequences of the growth of regionalism in the world.

40|$|The {{proliferation}} of regional <b>integration</b> <b>agreements</b> (RIAs) {{over the past}} several years has led to significant changes in the global configuration of trade and investment activity. Multinational enterprises now face the prospect of multilateral trade liberalisation that could significantly affect the foreign direct investment (FDI) incentive structures that were established within the range of current RIAs. RIAs that provide preferential market access to member countries modify firms’ incentives to undertake FDI activities and can lead to various permutations of trade and investment creation and diversion. This article provides an analytical framework for understanding the implications of multilateral trade liberalisation for the incentive structures of firms to conduct FDI and discusses how multilateral liberalisation could undo many of the FDI activities that were initiated in response to previous RIAs. foreign direct investment, incentives, multilateral trade liberalisation, regional <b>integration</b> <b>agreements,</b> Demand and Price Analysis, Financial Economics, International Relations/Trade, Political Economy,...|$|R
