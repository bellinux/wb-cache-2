25|$|In 1938, Pyotr Kapitsa, John Allen and Don Misener {{discovered}} that helium-4 became {{a new kind}} of fluid, now known as a superfluid, at temperatures less than 2.17 K (the lambda point). Superfluid helium has many unusual properties, including zero viscosity (the ability to flow without dissipating energy) and the existence of quantized vortices. It was quickly believed that the superfluidity was due to partial Bose–Einstein condensation of the liquid. In fact, many properties of superfluid helium also appear in gaseous condensates created by Cornell, Wieman and Ketterle (see below). Superfluid helium-4 is a liquid rather than a gas, which means that the interactions between the atoms are relatively strong; the original theory of Bose–Einstein condensation must be heavily modified in order to describe it. Bose–Einstein condensation remains, however, fundamental to the superfluid properties of helium-4. Note that helium-3, a fermion, also enters a superfluid phase (at a much lower temperature) which {{can be explained by the}} formation of bosonic Cooper pairs of two atoms (see also <b>fermionic</b> <b>condensate).</b>|$|E

50|$|A <b>fermionic</b> <b>condensate</b> is a {{superfluid}} phase {{formed by}} fermionic particles at low temperatures. It {{is closely related}} to the Bose-Einstein condensate, a superfluid phase formed by bosonic atoms under similar conditions.

5000|$|<b>Fermionic</b> <b>condensates</b> are {{attained}} at temperatures lower than Bose-Einstein <b>condensates.</b> <b>Fermionic</b> <b>condensates</b> are {{a type of}} superfluid. As the name suggests, a superfluid possesses fluid properties similar to those possessed by ordinary liquids and gases, such as {{the lack of a}} definite shape and the ability to flow in response to applied forces. However, superfluids possess some properties that do not appear in ordinary matter. For instance, they can flow at low velocities without dissipating any energy—i.e. zero viscosity. At higher velocities, energy is dissipated by the formation of quantized vortices, which act as [...] "holes" [...] in the medium where superfluidity breaks down.|$|R

The non-commutative dynamics {{can be regarded}} as an effective description of the mechanisms which lead to inhomogeneous phase transitions and their relation to the roton-like excitation spectrum. The typical infrared-ultraviolet mixing in non-commutative theories contains the peculiar ingredients to describe the interplay between short and long distance particle interactions which is responsible for the non-uniform background and the roton spectrum both in bosonic and <b>fermionic</b> <b>condensates.</b> Comment: 4 Pages, no figure...|$|R
40|$|The Higgs boson in <b>fermionic</b> <b>condensates</b> {{with the}} BCS pairing {{interaction}} describes {{the dynamics of}} the pairing amplitude.

Conversely, the Higgs mode is discrete for the pairing interaction enhanced at the Fermi level. This work illustrates conceptual difficulties associated with introducing collective variables in the many-body pairing dynamics. Comment: 4 pages, 2 figure...|$|R

40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{possibility}} that <b>fermionic</b> <b>condensates</b> arise from the dominance of scalar exchange forces over vector gluon exchange.

More generally, when a scalar in a general representation is exchanged in the reaction A+B → B+A, the group theoretic sum giving the force sign and strength can be expressed in terms of a Racah coefficient for the group in question.
