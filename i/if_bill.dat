2500|$|In [...] "The Lie of the Land", the Twelfth Doctor fakes a {{regeneration}} {{after his}} companion Bill Potts shoots {{him after he}} pretends to be siding with the Monks. The bullets that are fired are revealed to have been blanks, {{and the whole thing}} was a test by the Doctor to see <b>if</b> <b>Bill</b> was under the Monks' influence.|$|E

I wonder whether their teams were aware of it? If the answer to both of these questions is in the affirmative, their reaction was lamentable – by and large...they muffed it – [...] massacred it.|$|E

For several weeks after that we kids lived in delicious dread half-believing that father was in deadly danger. When we went out on a walk with him he'd send us on ahead to look around corners and behind trees to see <b>if</b> <b>Bill</b> Cody was waiting in ambush.

2500|$|Export Development Canada (EDC) {{would be}} {{required}} to withdraw even existing financing from a company that has been found in a Ministerial investigation to have activities inconsistent with the guidelines to be established under Bill C-300. EDC notes that they currently conduct CRS assessments of financings in sensitive markets or for sensitive projects, and work with companies to ensure that required standards are met before receiving EDC support. [...] EDC believes that by working with companies to resolve CSR issues they contribute more to CSR than if they were forced to exit the relationship as soon as the guidelines are not met. EDC’s support in this sector helped generate $21.4 billion in Canadian GDP and sustain 139,000 Canadian jobs in communities across the country and this might be in jeopardy <b>if</b> <b>Bill</b> C-300 were to become law.|$|E
2500|$|The {{regeneration}} of the Ninth Doctor {{into the}} Tenth {{at the end}} of [...] "The Parting of the Ways" [...] (2005) used computer effects to morph Christopher Eccleston into David Tennant. In the episode of Doctor Who Confidential accompanying the episode [...] "Utopia" [...] (2007), where the same effect is used for the Master's regeneration, it is stated that the production team decided {{that this would be a}} common effect for all future Time Lord regenerations, rather than each regeneration being designed uniquely at the whim of the individual director. This style of transition is seen again in [...] "The Stolen Earth"/"Journey's End" [...] (2008) both when the Doctor undergoes an aborted regeneration, and when his hand spawns a clone in the second part; in The End of Time (2010) during which Matt Smith took over the role as the Eleventh Doctor; in [...] "The Impossible Astronaut" [...] when the Doctor is shot twice and seemingly killed; in [...] "Day of the Moon" [...] when a young girl regenerates; and in [...] "Let's Kill Hitler" [...] when Mels (Nina Toussaint-White) is shot and regenerates into River Song (Alex Kingston). [...] "The Night of the Doctor" [...] and [...] "The Day of the Doctor" [...] subsequently use the effect to show the Eighth Doctor and War Doctor's regenerations respectively. The Eighth Doctor's regeneration into the War Doctor uses steady beams of light as opposed to the flame effect used for other revived series regenerations. In the Series 10 episode [...] "The Lie of the Land", the Twelfth Doctor fakes a regeneration as part of a plan to test <b>if</b> <b>Bill</b> still has free will. The effect used is consistent with the one used in the modern series, with the Doctor's hands glowing and emitting regeneration energy before he enters full regeneration. However, as the regeneration was not real, it did not use up a regeneration and the Doctor did not change body.|$|E

50|$|<b>If</b> the <b>bill</b> {{to alter}} the Constitution is {{approved}} by both houses or satisfies the deadlock provision, the bill is submitted to the electors for approval. <b>If</b> the <b>bill</b> is approved by an absolute majority of both houses, the Constitution provides {{that it must be}} submitted to the electors no less than two months but no later than six months after passage. Despite this, the Hawke government in 1984 failed to submit a proposed referendum that had been passed by both houses, claiming that they had a legal opinion supporting their action.

60|$|Another day of fog. Half of {{his last}} blanket had gone into foot-wrappings. He failed to pick up Bill's trail. It did not matter.
