This study aimed to know the effectiveness of focus <b>group</b> <b>discussion</b> in maximizing menopause women’s coping mechanism. Health education is one part of the whole health efforts (promotive, preventive, curative, rehabilitative) which emphasize on healthy life attitudes. Method; This study was conducted by using randomized control trial which is used to examine the effectiveness of focus <b>group</b> <b>discussion</b> in maximizing menopause women’s coping mechanism. This study used a questionnaire which is examined validity and reliability (internal consistency) with using: item total correlation and alpha Crohnbach and taken 30 menopause women as the sample by using simple random sampling technique. Result; The analysis that used in this study is t-test with p value average difference of coping ability towards a group between health education and without focus <b>group</b> <b>discussion</b> is 0, 07. It means that there is a significant different between the two groups’ attitudes. The result indicates the score mean (posttest - pretest) of each group is that; the health education without focus <b>group</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>group</b> is 6, 3, while the health education with focus <b>group</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>group</b> is 8, 7.

25|$|Krishnamurti {{continued}} {{speaking in}} public lectures, <b>group</b> <b>discussions</b> and with concerned individuals around the world. In the early 1960s, {{he made the}} acquaintance of physicist David Bohm, whose philosophical and scientific concerns regarding {{the essence of the}} physical world, and the psychological and sociological state of mankind, found parallels in Krishnamurti's philosophy. The two men soon became close friends and started a common inquiry, in the form of personal dialogues–and occasionally in <b>group</b> <b>discussions</b> with other participants–that continued, periodically, over nearly two decades. Several of these discussions were published in the form of books or as parts of books, and introduced a wider audience (among scientists) to Krishnamurti's ideas. Although Krishnamurti's philosophy delved into fields as diverse as religious studies, education, psychology, physics, and consciousness studies, he was not then, nor since, well known in academic circles. Nevertheless, Krishnamurti met and held discussions with physicists Fritjof Capra and George Sudarshan, biologist Rupert Sheldrake, psychiatrist David Shainberg, as well as psychotherapists representing various theoretical orientations. The long friendship with Bohm went through a rocky interval in later years, and although they overcame their differences and remained friends until Krishnamurti's death, the relationship did not regain its previous intensity.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE TEACHERS’ USE, OR NON-USE, OF SMALL <b>GROUP</b> <b>DISCUSSION</b> by JULIANNE SNIDER August 2016 Advisor: Dr. Karen Feathers Major: Reading, Language, and Literature Degree: Doctor of Education This {{qualitative}} study explored teacher answers to one question: What factors influence teachers’ decisions to use, or not use, small <b>group</b> <b>discussion.</b> Research supports {{a variety of}} small <b>group</b> <b>discussion</b> approaches to meet a range of curricular goals. Despite the philosophical move to student-centered discussion approaches, and research supporting small <b>group</b> <b>discussion</b> as an effective literacy approach, teacher led whole class discussion continues as the dominant approach. An online teacher survey about teacher use of discussion generated fifteen teachers, grades two through eight, who were interviewed to gather data on their perspectives about student discussion. Three themes emerged from the interview data: (1) Teachers’ perspectives about their philosophy of education differed between teachers who used small <b>group</b> <b>discussion</b> and whole class discussion, (2) Teacher’s talk about students differed between teachers who used small <b>group</b> <b>discussion</b> and whole class discussion, and (3) Teachers’ talk about the teacher’s role or purpose differed between teachers who used small <b>group</b> <b>discussion</b> and whole class discussion. Based on the findings, the implications suggest that teachers who are successful at implementing small <b>group</b> <b>discussion</b> have reading related advanced degrees, they have adopted constructivist philosophies, perhaps through their advanced degrees in reading, and they benefit from administrative and collegial support. Without the reading education and the philosophy to support student-centered approaches, teacher comments revealed that even when school-wide literacy programs, designed to engage students in small <b>group</b> <b>discussion,</b> were implemented, teachers manipulated the program activities to fit their teacher-led style...|$|R

40|$|A robust {{finding in}} social {{dilemmas}} research is that individual group members {{are more likely}} to act cooperatively if they are given the chance to discuss the dilemma with one another. The authors investigated whether imagining a <b>group</b> <b>discussion</b> may represent an effective means of increasing cooperative behavior {{in the absence of the}} opportunity for direct negotiation among decision makers. Five experiments, utilizing a range of task variants, tested this hypothesis. Participants engaged in a guided simulation of the progressive steps required to reach a cooperative consensus within a <b>group</b> <b>discussion</b> of a social dilemma. Results support the conclusion that imagined <b>group</b> <b>discussion</b> enables conscious processes that parallel those underlying the direct <b>group</b> <b>discussion</b> and is a strategy that can effectively elicit cooperative behavior.

25|$|The launch {{was delayed}} until February 1985 {{due to a}} delay in the chat show Wogan, {{that was to be}} a part of the major revamp in BBC1's schedules. Smith was uneasy about the late start as EastEnders no longer had the winter months to build up a loyal {{following}} before the summer ratings lull. The press were invited to Elstree to meet the cast and see the lot, and stories immediately started circulating about the show, about a rivalry with ITV (who were launching their own market-based soap, Albion Market) and about the private lives of the cast. Anticipation and rumour grew in equal measure until the first transmission at 7p.m. on 19 February 1985. Both Holland and Smith could not watch; they both instead returned to the place where it all began, Albertine's Wine Bar on Wood Lane. The next day, viewing figures were confirmed at 17 million. The reviews were largely favourable, although, after three weeks on air, BBC1's early evening share had returned to the pre-EastEnders figure of seven million, though EastEnders then climbed to highs of up to 23 million later on in the year. Following the launch, both <b>group</b> <b>discussions</b> and telephone surveys were conducted to test audience reaction to early episodes.
