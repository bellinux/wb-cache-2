5|$|The {{beginning}} of Szabó’s career {{coincided with the}} {{beginning of}} a “new wave” in Hungarian cinema, one of several new wave cinemas that occurred around this time throughout Western and Eastern Europe. The Eastern European new waves were caused by political liberalization, the decentralization of film industries, and the emergence of films as valuable commodities for export to Western European markets. The resulting films were more formally experimental, politically anti-establishment, and, <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> Szabó, psychologically probing than the films of the previous generation.

5|$|A common {{claim of}} creationists is that {{evolution}} {{has never been}} observed. Challenges to such objections often come down to debates over how evolution is defined (see the Defining evolution section above). Under the conventional biological definition of evolution, {{it is a simple}} matter to observe evolution occurring. Evolutionary processes, in the form of populations changing their genetic composition from generation to generation, have been observed in different scientific contexts, including the evolution of fruit flies, mice, and bacteria in the laboratory, and of tilapia in the field. Such studies on experimental evolution, particularly those using microorganisms, are now providing important insights into how evolution occurs, <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> antibiotic resistance.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{original}} deployment plans for Zeus had been a defensive system for SAC. The Air Force argued against such a system, in favor of building more ICBMs of their own. Their logic was that every Soviet missile launched in a counterforce strike could destroy a single US missile. If both forces had similar numbers of missiles, such an attack would leave both forces with few remaining missiles to launch a counterstrike. Adding Zeus would {{reduce the number of}} losses on the US side, helping ensure a counterstrike force would survive. However, the same was true if the US built more ICBMs instead. The Air Force was far more interested in building its own missiles than the Army's, <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> Zeus, which appeared to be easily outwitted.|$|E
5|$|Roa Bastos was an {{exponent}} of the Neobaroque {{style that}} brought Latin American literature {{to the fore}} internationally in the mid-20th century. Among others, the Chilean poet Pablo Neruda is also associated with this school of writing. The style uses a complex system of metaphors that are often very {{closely tied to the}} land, flora and culture of the particular writer, <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> Roa Bastos. Magic realism is a Neobaroque concept that applies such systems of metaphor to otherwise realistic settings (Yo, el Supremo being a notable example of the form). The Neobaroque style was used by many Paraguayan writers in exile after 1947 and until the 1980s. At the core of much of the work from this group are ideas of political freedom and the emancipation of their homeland.|$|E

5|$|Within an ionic crystal, {{there will}} usually be some point defects, but to {{maintain}} electroneutrality, these defects come in pairs. Frenkel defects {{consist of a}} cation vacancy paired with a cation interstitial and can be generated anywhere in {{the bulk of the}} crystal, occurring most commonly in compounds with a low coordination number and cations that are much smaller than the anions. Schottky defects consist of one vacancy of each type, and are generated at the surfaces of a crystal, occurring most commonly in compounds with a high coordination number and when the anions and cations are of similar size. If the cations have multiple possible oxidation states, then it is possible for cation vacancies to compensate for electron deficiencies on cation sites with higher oxidation numbers, resulting in a non-stoichiometric compound. Another non-stoichiometric possibility is the formation of an F-center, a free electron occupying an anion vacancy. When the compound has three or more ionic components, even more defect types are possible. All of these point defects can be generated via thermal vibrations and have an equilibrium concentration. Because they are energetically costly, but entropically beneficial, they occur in greater concentration at higher temperatures. Once generated, these pairs of defects can diffuse mostly independently of one another, by hopping between lattice sites. This defect mobility is the source of most transport phenomena within an ionic crystal, including diffusion and solid state ionic conductivity. When vacancies collide with interstitials (Frenkel), they can recombine and annihilate one another. Similarly vacancies are removed when they reach the surface of the crystal (Schottky). Defects in the crystal structure generally expand the lattice parameters, reducing the overall density of the crystal. Defects also result in ions in distinctly different local environments, which causes them to experience a different crystal-field symmetry, <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> different cations exchanging lattice sites. This results in a different splitting of d-electron orbitals, so that the optical absorption (and hence colour) can change with defect concentration.|$|E
