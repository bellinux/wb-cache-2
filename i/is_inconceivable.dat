25|$|The {{foundation}} {{of much of}} the propaganda relating the Bahá'í Faith to Russian influence is a memoir attributed to Dimitri Ivanovich Dolgorukov who was the Russian ambassador to Persia from 1846 to 1854. The memoir states that Dolgorukov created the Bábí and Bahá'í religions so as to weaken Iran and Shi'a Islam. The memoir was first published in 1943 in Persian in Mashhad, and shortly thereafter published again in Tehran {{with some of the most}} glaring errors corrected. The book still, however, contains so many historical errors that it <b>is</b> <b>inconceivable</b> that it is genuine.|$|E
25|$|Above all, {{the famous}} west front, {{decorated}} {{with thousands of}} figures, is a masterpiece of the Gothic era. The tower {{is one of the}} first to rely substantially on craftsmanship, with the final appearance being one with a high degree of linearity captured in stone. While previous façades were certainly drawn prior to construction, Strasbourg has one of the earliest façades whose construction <b>is</b> <b>inconceivable</b> without prior drawing. Strasbourg and Cologne Cathedral together represent some of the earliest uses of architectural drawing. The work of Professor Robert O. Bork of the University of Iowa suggests that the design of the Strasbourg façade, while seeming almost random in its complexity, can be constructed using a series of rotated octagons.|$|E
25|$|The apathy {{towards the}} nation's {{heritage}} continued after {{the passing of}} the Town and Country Planning Act 1947, even though this was the most comprehensive law pertaining to planning legislation in England. The 1947 Act went further than its predecessors in dealing with historic buildings, as it required owners of property to notify their local authority of intended alterations, and more significantly, demolitions. This caught any property which may have escaped official notice previously. Theoretically, it gave the local authority the opportunity to impose a preservation order on the property and prevent demolition. Under this law the Duke of Bedford was fined for demolishing half of Woburn Abbey without notification, although it <b>is</b> <b>inconceivable</b> that the Duke {{would have been able to}} demolish half of the huge house (much of it visible from a public highway) without attracting public attention until the demolition was complete.|$|E

25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>inconceivable</b> that inanimate brute matter should, {{without the}} {{mediation}} of something else which is not material, operate upon and affect other matter, without mutual contact, as it must do if gravitation {{in the sense of}} Epicurus be essential and inherent in it. And this is one reason why I desired you would not ascribe 'innate gravity' to me. That gravity should be innate, inherent, and essential to matter, so that one body may act upon another at a distance, through a vacuum, without {{the mediation of}} anything else, by and through which their action and force may be conveyed from one to another, is to me so great an absurdity, that I believe no man who has in philosophical matters a competent faculty of thinking can ever fall into it. Gravity must be caused by an agent acting constantly according to certain laws; but whether this agent be material or immaterial, I have left to the consideration of my readers.|$|E
25|$|Because of this, {{even though}} Jazani never stroked out nonviolent struggle, {{but in the}} current {{circumstance}} {{came to the conclusion}} that open political activity <b>is</b> <b>inconceivable.</b> The government has left no possibility for this kind of activity; therefore the only method of struggle is guerrilla warfare. In the selection of this tactic Jazani and the members of the group were effected by the guerrilla warfare of South America and Vietnam and the works of Che Guevara, Fidel Castro, and Régis Debray were their main teachers. It should be noted that it was only Jazani and Zia-Zarifi that worked on the ideology of the group. The reaction towards secret activities and book reading resulted in the unimportance of theory in the group. Some of the members of the group were disgusted of any kind of research and made joke of it. From early 1957, the group acted to address this problem but its effects on the group remained. The change of the stance of the group resulted in the decrease of the importance of struggle in the mountains and between the villagers and increase in the importance of the struggle in the cities and the group prepared its activities according to that. But this change of tactics led to problems in the center of the group. Manoochehr Kallantari that he does not believe in the ideology of the group and Shahrzad believed that the group could not make it work. Even though after discussions they changed their positions and accepted the decision of the center of the group but in reality they were sidelined from the group's activities. Kallantari was sent to London and Shahrzad was transferred to the reserve force and in October 1967 because of disagreement with the method of stealing from the bank, after the ruling from the center of the group he was let off from the organization.|$|E

This transition is the transition of middle class nuclear families where heterosexuality is the norm to the recognition and acceptance {{of a variety of}} different family types, an embracing of societal polysexuality and plurality; it is furthermore the transition from mass culture to the prevalence of sub-cultures and multiculturalism. Literary critic Fredric Jameson says that [...] "our advertising...is fed by postmodernism in all the arts, and <b>is</b> <b>inconceivable</b> without it." ...|$|E

500|$|Nevertheless, {{ultimately}} the nuclear option was discounted by military planners. A secret memorandum reported by US Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, sent to US President Lyndon B. Johnson on 19 February 1968, was declassified in 2005. It {{reveals that the}} nuclear option was discounted [...] because of terrain considerations that were unique to South Vietnam, which would have reduced the effectiveness of tactical nuclear weapons. McNamara wrote: [...] "because of terrain and other conditions peculiar to our operations in South Vietnam, it <b>is</b> <b>inconceivable</b> {{that the use of}} nuclear weapons would be recommended there against either Viet Cong or North Vietnamese forces".|$|E

500|$|Later in February, Specter accused Sestak of mistreating his {{employees}} and disobeying {{state and federal}} minimum wage laws by severely underpaying his House staff. Citing Federal Election Commission reports, Specter claimed ten of Sestak's sixteen campaign staffers were making less than minimum wage {{and that they were}} so underpaid they were eligible for food stamps. He also noted that Sestak's three highest-paid staffers were members of his family, including his brother Richard Sestak, who worked as campaign manager. T.J. Rooney, a Specter supporter, wrote a letter to Sestak expressing concern about the potential violation of minimum wage laws, which read: [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>inconceivable</b> to me that our standard bearer wouldn’t be paying his workers the minimum wage". Sestak responded by acknowledging his staff could make more money elsewhere, but said [...] "they choose to work hard and make some sacrifices because they know {{how important it is to}} elect someone to the United States Senate who shares their principles".|$|E
500|$|Gabriel García Márquez's The Autumn of the Patriarch (El otoño del patriarca, 1975) {{details the}} life of an eternal dictator, [...] "el macho", a fictional {{character}} who lives to be over 200 years old. The book is divided into six sections, each retelling the same story of the infinite power held by the archetypal Caribbean tyrant. Márquez based his fictional dictator on a variety of real-life autocrats, including Gustavo Rojas Pinilla of his Colombian homeland, Generalissimo Francisco Franco of Spain (the novel was written in Barcelona), and Venezuela's Juan Vicente Gómez. One of the key characters of the novel is the Indian General Saturno Santos, who devotes himself to [...] "inscrutable service to the patriarch." [...] In this novel, García Márquez proposes an interesting contradiction: [...] "that Latin America's patriarchs owe their most intimate support to their victims of longest standing; and that America's revolution <b>is</b> <b>inconceivable</b> without the Indian". Illustrating the importance of the Indian in Latin America is all the more prudent given that García Márquez's home country, Colombia, is distinguished as literarily [...] not recognizing the Indian populations which are very much alive today.|$|E
500|$|Bayern {{president}} Franz Beckenbauer recognised {{that it was}} a loss {{of concentration}} in the last few minutes that led to his side's defeat: [...] "That was the cruellest defeat possible because victory was so close. We already had victory in the bag and {{there were only a few}} seconds to go. But those few seconds were enough for Manchester to get back into the game. We were playing well in the last 20 minutes and should have been able to hold on to victory. But in the end, Manchester deservedly won." [...] Manager Ottmar Hitzfeld seemed more stunned by the result in his reaction: [...] "I feel so sorry for my team because they were so close to winning this match but they have lost. It's really difficult to digest and this <b>is</b> <b>inconceivable</b> for us but then this is what football is all about. Normally when the opposition equalise you are expecting extra-time and it was a shock to our team when they scored the winner two minutes later. It could take days or even weeks to recover from this but I must say that Manchester are great champions." ...|$|E

500|$|Knox and Linderman {{were both}} {{personally}} familiar with mining {{conditions in the}} Far West. They knew {{that the amount of}} bullion produced was only going to increase, and would likely drop the price of silver below the level ($1.2929 per troy ounce) at which the metal in a silver dollar was worth more as bullion than as money. In his explanatory statement accompanying his draft bill, Knox explained the discontinuance of the silver dollar would mean the United States was no longer a bimetallic nation. Boutwell, in his 1872 annual report, urged Congress to end the coinage of silver from private deposits, lest the government take a loss from paying out gold in exchange for the silver dollars, and ultimately having to melt them when they could not be circulated. According to Nugent, [...] "Were Knox, Linderman, Boutwell, Sherman, and others aware of what they were doing when they planned to drop the silver dollar? [...] It <b>is</b> <b>inconceivable</b> that they were not; Knox's statement was explicit. But did they urge it because they feared a drop in silver prices? [...] No one made an explicit statement to that effect, but it was undoubtedly the case." ...|$|E
500|$|Charles Hartshorne and Norman Malcolm are {{primarily}} responsible for introducing modal versions of the argument into the contemporary debate. Both claimed that Anselm had {{two versions of the}} ontological argument, the second of which was a modal logic version. According to James Harris, this version is represented by Malcolm thus:If it [...] can be conceived at all it must exist. For no one who denies or doubts the existence of a being a greater than which <b>is</b> <b>inconceivable,</b> denies or doubts that if it did exist its nonexistence, either in reality or in the understanding, would be impossible. For otherwise {{it would not be a}} being a greater than which cannot be conceived. But as to whatever can be conceived but does not exist: if it were to exist its nonexistence either in reality or in the understanding would be possible. Therefore, if a being a greater than which cannot be conceived, can even be conceived, it must exist.Hartshorne says that, for Anselm, [...] "necessary existence is a superior manner of existence to ordinary, contingent existence and that ordinary, contingent existence is a defect." [...] For Hartshorne, both Hume and Kant focused only upon whether what exists is greater than what does not exist. However, [...] "Anselm's point is that what exists and cannot not exist is greater than that which exists and can not exist." [...] This avoids the question of whether or not existence is a predicate.|$|E
500|$|The Economists Free Exchange blog {{argued that}} Cowen [...] "undersold" [...] recent {{innovations}} in digital technologies and that society {{was still in}} the process of re-organising itself around them. A growth spurt should be expected but this could take anything from years to decades, it warned. Furthermore, there are particularly large gains to be had in the area [...] "cognition-augmenting innovations (as opposed to labor-augmenting innovations)". Writing in Forbes, Steve Denning described Cowen's [...] "low-hanging fruit theory" [...] as [...] "folkloric nonsense". The world of 1953, when Denning was young, <b>is</b> <b>inconceivable</b> to a young person today, he wrote, adding that the qualification [...] "apart from the Internet" [...] is equivalent to saying [...] "apart from the wheel" [...] when discussing transport. The Financial Times reviewer recognized that Cowen, a prominent blogger, [...] "is no Luddite...he thinks life is more fun and interesting with the internet around". He argued that most economists do not look at consumer technology to find the internet's effect on productivity but rather organizations: super-efficient retailers such as Wal-mart and Tesco have already incorporated it into their logistics. Furthermore, the pace of change means it could be a generation at least before we see the full implementation. Timothy Noah seizes upon Cowen's [...] "concession" [...] that the internet could well increase scientific output by allowing better communication between scientists in remote places. Just as Davis and Wessel incorrectly predicted a coming boom in middle class incomes due to computers, Cowen [...] "seems equally wrong to suggest that computer technology is not on the verge of doing so." ...|$|E
