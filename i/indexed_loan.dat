Although this eliminates direct currency risk, it creates credit risk, because any larger depreciation might induce borrower defaults.

An alternative option presented here would be to convert existing GLF loans into GDP-linked loans. Interest payments would then be linked to the development of Greece's GDP. First, this would reduce the likelihood of Greece defaulting on its loans and, hence, the risk to German taxpayers. Above all, however, it would achieve the aim of stabilizing Greece's debt ratio even if growth was weak. Second, GDP-linked loans would give Greece a greater incentive to take more responsibility for its reforms and improve their chances of success. Third, <b>indexed</b> <b>loans</b> would ease pressure on the Greek government in the short to medium term by temporarily postponing interest payments, and allowing it to pursue a less procyclical fiscal policy.

Besides, they have foreseen very short periods of amortization and inconvertibility allowing them to break away from their obligations. However some issues — and amoug them some are the most satisfactory for saving — are bound to the activity of the issuing enterprises. This fact joins indexed bonds to shares. Each bond must be carefully studied. As a matter of fact, investigation of a certain number of concrète cases shows that, next to interesting formula generally used by industrial public enterprises (electricity, railway), some are fallacious.

40|$|This paper reviews {{financial}} stability {{challenges in the}} EU candidate countries: Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Turkey. It follows a macro-prudential approach, emphasising systemic risks and the stability of financial systems as a whole. The paper recalls that the economies of all three countries experienced a recession in 2008 - 09 and shows how this slowed the rapid process of financial deepening that had been taking place {{since the beginning of}} the last decade. The deteriorating economic and financial conditions manifested themselves, first and foremost, through a marked deterioration in asset quality. These direct credit risks were compounded by the transformation of exchange and interest rate risks through a widespread use of foreign exchange-denominated or <b>indexed</b> <b>loans</b> and variable or adjustable interest rate loans. Moreover, funding and liquidity risks also materialised to some extent, although fully fledged bank runs were avoided, and none of the countries experienced a sharp reversal in external financing. Overall, the deterioration in asset quality has so far been managed well by the banking systems of the candidate countries, facilitated by large capital buffers, pro-active macro-prudential policies pursued by the authorities both before and during the crisis and the relative stability of exchange rates. Looking ahead, although uncertainties remain high regarding credit quality, the shock-absorbing capacities of the banking systems are fairly robust, as also evidenced by their relative resilience so far. Nevertheless, as the economic recovery sets in, the central banks should return to and possibly reinforce the implementation of measures to avoid a pro-cyclical build-up of credit asset) boom-bust cycles. Furthermore, given the relevance of foreign-owned banks in two of the three countries, a continued strengthening of home-host cooperation in the supervisory area will be crucial to avoid any kind of regulatory arbitrage.
