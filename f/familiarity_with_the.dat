5|$|Hans Karl von Winterfeldt {{was born}} at Vanselow Castle (now in Siedenbrünzow, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern) in Swedish Pomerania. His {{education}} was imperfect, and in later life he always regretted his lack of <b>familiarity</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> French language.|$|E
5|$|Traditional Victorian dancing fairies and elves {{appear in}} much of Tolkien's early poetry, and have {{influence}} upon his later works {{in part due to}} the influence of a production of J. M. Barrie's Peter Pan in Birmingham in 1910 and his <b>familiarity</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> work of Catholic mystic poet, Francis Thompson which Tolkien had acquired in 1914.|$|E
5|$|Due to the rainout and the racers' lack of <b>familiarity</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> EuroSpeedway, CART {{cancelled}} {{qualifying for}} the American Memorial. The starting grid {{was determined by}} drivers' order in the season points standings. The pole position went to de Ferran, though {{due to the lack}} of qualifying, he was not awarded a point in the standings as was customary for pole winners. Bräck earned second position since he held a tie-breaker over Castroneves, who started third, and Andretti began the race in fourth.|$|E

He wrote, [...] "For the filmmaker who brought these intertwined universes into being, the film represents new energy in a remarkable career.".|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> author coinciding <b>with</b> <b>the</b> gnostics, {{in fear of}} division, {{addressed}} a group who feel they are separated or discriminated. The author preaches to them of envy. Particularly referring to the New Testament, <b>the</b> author mentions <b>familiarities</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Pauline epistles about the body of Christ as a unity. The author points out that each and everyone {{is just as important}} as the other person.|$|R
5|$|Sotomayor's {{first major}} written opinion was a dissent in the Berghuis v. Thompkins case dealing with Miranda rights. As {{her first year}} neared completion, Sotomayor said she felt swamped by the {{intensity}} and heavy workload of the job. During the oral arguments for National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, Sotomayor showed her increasing <b>familiarity</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Court and its protocols by directing the opening questions of the arguments to Donald Verrilli, the Solicitor General who was representing the government's position.|$|E
5|$|The plot of Sherlock Holmes Baffled is {{unrelated}} to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's canonical Sherlock Holmes stories; {{it is likely}} that the character's name was used purely for its <b>familiarity</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> public. Shot from a single point of view on a stage set, the intention of Sherlock Holmes Baffled was probably to act as a showcase for basic film trickery and film editing effects, particularly the stop trick first developed four years earlier in 1896 by French director Georges Méliès.|$|E
5|$|A {{particular}} {{definition of}} Mitică and mitici {{was adopted by}} many inhabitants of Transylvania, who used the terms in reference to either Bucharest-based politicians or inhabitants of the city at large, and contrasted them with their counterparts to the northwest. The character has thus evolved to include a stereotypical view of contemporary Bucharesters or Wallachians, one which depicts them as , arrogant, aggressive and cunning. In other contexts, the mitici {{may be seen as}} not having an adequate <b>familiarity</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> culture of Transylvania, and are associated with the Balkans (whereas Transylvania is identified with Central Europe).|$|E
50|$|At the bar {{he accused}} Topcliffe of having boasted to him of indecent <b>familiarities</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Queen. Hence Topcliffe {{obtained}} a mandamus {{to the sheriff}} to proceed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> execution, though Archbishop Whitgift endeavoured to delay it and make his godson conform, and though (it is said) Pormort would have admitted conference <b>with</b> Protestant ministers. <b>The</b> gibbet was erected over against the haberdasher's shop, and Portmore was kept standing two hours on the ladder, while Topcliffe vainly urged him to withdraw his accusation.|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} a multidimensional scaling procedure {{that attempts to}} derive a spatial representation of stimuli unconfounded by the effect of subjects' degrees of <b>familiarity</b> <b>with</b> these stimuli. <b>The</b> proposed model assumes that stimulus unfamiliarity produces a tendency for a subject to anchor his/her dissimilarity judgments towards a reference value on the response scale. The input data needed to perform such analyses are the degree of stimulus <b>familiarity</b> along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> dissimilarity judgments for all pairs of stimuli. In a Monte Carlo study, we investigate {{the extent to which}} the procedure recovers known parameters. Furthermore, empirical applications of the model to positioning studies of magazines and banks in the Netherlands are provided...|$|R
5|$|After the Franks {{were driven}} from the Holy Land in 1291, European <b>familiarity</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> castles of the Crusades declined. It {{was not until}} the 19thcentury that {{interest}} in these buildings was renewed, so there are no detailed plans from before 1837. Guillaume Rey was the first European researcher to scientifically study Crusader castles in the Holy Land. In 1871 he published the work Etudes sur les monuments de l'architecture militaire des Croisés en Syrie et dans l'ile de Chypre; it included plans and drawings of the major Crusader castles in Syria, including Krak des Chevaliers. In some instances his drawings were inaccurate, however for Krak des Chavaliers they record features which have since been lost.|$|E
5|$|Although Apollonius {{wrote his}} poem in the 3rd century BC, the {{composition}} of the story of the Argonauts is earlier than Odyssey, which shows <b>familiarity</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> exploits of Jason (the wandering of Odysseus may have been partly founded on it). In ancient times the expedition was regarded as a historical fact, an incident in the opening up of the Black Sea to Greek commerce and colonization. It was also extremely popular, forming a cycle to which a number of local legends became attached. The story of Medea, in particular, caught the imagination of the tragic poets.|$|E
5|$|Daily fantasy {{sports have}} faced notable legal challenges, {{including}} disputes over whether DFS constitutes gambling. Politicians {{and other critics}} have argued that due to their format, players are essentially making proposition wagers on the varying performance of individual athletes in specific games, and not managing {{the performance of their}} selections on a week-to-week basis. Proponents have defended DFS as being a game of skill, as the required <b>familiarity</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> players and teams, as well as salary cap management, rewards skilled players. Local laws have varying definitions of gambling games, such as whether a game's elements of chance are predominant over those or skill, or how much control the player has over the outcome of the game.|$|E

40|$|Research on how {{accountants}} {{could increase}} {{their confidence in}} interpreting and applying International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) is lacking. This study examines whether the accuracy of judgments made by accountants varies {{as a consequence of}} their level of confidence, and whether their confidence in exercising judgments could be enhanced by greater <b>familiarity</b> <b>with</b> IFRS. <b>The</b> results of the study support that accountants who are more confident make judgments that better reflect the economic substance of a transaction than accountants who are less confident. The results further indicate that <b>familiarity</b> <b>with</b> IFRS enhances <b>the</b> confidence of accountants and the most accurate judgments are made by those accountants who are not only familiar with IFRS but also have confidence in their judgments. 10 page(s...|$|R

5|$|In Parliament, a {{political}} crisis {{developed over the}} king's policy of seeking a Spanish wife for Charles, Prince of Wales, {{as part of a}} proposed alliance with the Habsburgs. In the parliament of 1621, it fell to Calvert to advocate the Spanish Match, as it came to be called, against the majority of Parliament, who feared an increase in Catholic influence on the state. As a result of his pro-Spanish stance and defence of relaxations in the penal laws against Catholics, Calvert became estranged from many in the Commons, who were suspicious of his close <b>familiarity</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Spanish ambassador's court. Calvert also faced difficulties in his private life: his wife's death on 8 August 1622 left him the single father of ten children, the oldest of whom, Cecil, was sixteen years old.|$|E
5|$|In late 2014, Russia {{offered the}} Su-35 to Indonesia {{as the country}} sought to replace its ageing F-5E Tiger II fleet. The {{following}} year, the Indonesian Ministry of Defence selected the Su-35 ahead of the Eurofighter Typhoon, Dassault Rafale, F-16, and Saab JAS 39 Gripen; the Defence Ministry cited the Indonesian Air Force's <b>familiarity</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Su-27SK and Su-30MK2 {{as the reason for}} the aircraft's selection. There were some initial reports that the country was to order a squadron of up to sixteen aircraft, but the number was later reduced to some ten aircraft. By mid-2017, negotiations between the two parties for the sale of the Su-35 had reached an advanced stage, with the Indonesian government later agreed in principle to conduct a barter trade of agricultural products for a reported eleven aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The user {{interface}} and game controls are unified across the PC and home console versions. Players {{have the option}} of using any combination of a keyboard, mouse, and game controller to play; the former two are achieved on PlayStation 4 via wireless or USB keyboard and mouse. By default, the system is navigated through drag and drop windows on PC. Navigation on the PlayStation version of Final Fantasy XIV is accomplished with a XrossMediaBar-like interface due to platform users' <b>familiarity</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> set-up. This bar is used to access all menus, maps, logs, and configuration options. The head-up display for both versions includes a message log, party status menu, mini-map, and action bar. The player may customize the location of all of these elements.|$|E

In 2013, it won the Tony Award for Best Play and the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Play, among other awards.|$|R
5000|$|Often {{cited for}} his turn from Constructivism towards Stalinist neo-Classicism in the 1930s, Trotsky's {{training}} under Fomin indicates a long <b>familiarity</b> <b>with</b> classical forms. <b>The</b> {{high point of}} his Constructivist work is probably the Kirov District Administration building of 1938.|$|R
5|$|After the German Army {{captured}} much of Belgium {{following the}} Battle of the Frontiers in 1914, the Allied forces were left holding a thin strip of coastline {{to the west}} of the Yser. The remainder of the Belgian coast came under the occupation of German Marine Divisions, including the important strategic ports of Antwerp and Bruges. A network of canals connected Bruges with the coast at Ostend and Zeebrugge, through which small warships such as destroyers, light cruisers and submarines could travel and find a safe harbour from which to launch raids into the English Channel and along the coasts of southeast England. U-boats could also depart from Bruges at night, cutting a day off the journey to the Western Approaches, more easily avoiding the North Sea Mine Barrage and allowing U-boat captains to gain <b>familiarity</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> net and mine defences of the English Channel, through which they had to pass to reach the main battlegrounds of the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|As both Birmingham City and Manchester City were First Division clubs, {{they entered}} the {{competition}} in the third round. Manchester City's cup run started with a home tie against Blackpool. The visitors took the lead after only 10seconds (their fastest goal ever), but midway through the match, fog enveloped Maine Road. The match was abandoned during the second half, immediately after City had scored an equalising goal, and replayed the following Wednesday; City won 2–1. In the fourth round Manchester City faced Southend United at Roots Hall. The Essex club's ground had only opened five months previously, and was suffering from drainage problems. Torrential rainfall meant that in {{the week before the}} match a trench was dug across the pitch, and sand added. Though Southend were a Third Division team, their <b>familiarity</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> uneven pitch meant the match was closely contested. Southend pressured the Manchester City goal, requiring Bert Trautmann to make several saves, but Joe Hayes scored the only goal of the game on a City counter-attack to earn a fifth-round tie against Liverpool.|$|E
5|$|Drewett {{emigrated to}} Australia in 1884, causing {{the boys to}} be uprooted as they {{went to live with}} Drewett's mother in London. In September of that year, Aurobindo and Manmohan joined St Paul's School there. He learned Greek and spent the last three years reading {{literature}} and English poetry. He also acquired some <b>familiarity</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> German and Italian languages and, exposed to the evangelical strictures of Drewett's mother, a distaste for religion. He considered himself at one point to be an atheist but later determined that he was agnostic. A blue plaque unveiled in 2007 commemorates Aurobindo's residence at 49 St Stephen's Avenue in Shepherd's Bush, London, from 1884 to 1887. The three brothers began living in spartan circumstances at the Liberal Club in South Kensington during 1887, their father having experienced some financial difficulties. The Club's secretary was James Cotton, brother of their father's friend in the Bengal ICS, Henry Cotton.|$|E

40|$|Faces are visual stimuli full of {{information}}. Depending upon <b>the</b> <b>familiarity</b> <b>with</b> a face, <b>the</b> {{information we}} can extract will differ, so <b>the</b> more <b>familiarity</b> <b>with</b> a face, <b>the</b> more {{information that can}} be extracted from it. The present article reviews the role that pre-existing knowledge of a face has in its processing. Here, we focus on behavioral, electrophysiological and neuroimaging evidence. The influence of familiarity in early stages (attention, perception and working memory) and in later stages (pre-semantic and semantic knowledge) of the processing are discussed. The differences in brain anatomy for familiar and unfamiliar faces are also considered. As it will be shown, experimental data seems to support that familiarity can affect even the earliest stages of the recognition...|$|R
5|$|Lindqvist {{had insisted}} on writing the {{screenplay}} himself. Alfredson, who had no <b>familiarity</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> vampire and horror genres, initially expressed skepticism at having the original author do the adaptation, but found the end result very satisfying. Many of the minor characters and events from the book were removed, and focus directed primarily on the love story between the two leads. In particular, {{many aspects of the}} character Håkan, including him being a paedophile, were toned down, and his relationship with Eli was mostly left open to interpretation. Alfredson felt that the film could not deal with such a serious theme as pedophilia in a satisfying manner, and that this element would detract from the story of the children and their relationship. Still, the film provided a few hints, of which Alfredson mentions one in the director's comments (Håkan likes children, for the wrong reasons).|$|E
5|$|Mitchell was {{subsequently}} posted to the British Army of the Rhine {{with the rest}} of the regiment, and then joined the King's African Rifles, and was posted to East Africa. Soon afterward, he saw action in Zanzibar with the KAR in breaking up disturbances between the island's Arab and African populations, which had begun during a general election and had descended into widespread rioting and clashes. He also participated in operations on the Northern Frontier District. At the time, Somali guerrillas were launching raids as part of a campaign to unite the region with Somalia, and the frontiers with other neighbouring states were also volatile. In one incident, Mitchell was searching for Somali guerrillas in a low-flying helicopter, and an elephant attempted to attack the helicopter, nearly clipping it with its tusks. It has been claimed that while with the KAR Mitchell was instrumental in obtaining a commission for Idi Amin, who later became President of Uganda. Mitchell's <b>familiarity</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Scottish clan system made him more comfortable with African tribal issues than was the case with his English contemporaries. Impressed by Mitchell and other Scottish officers, Amin would later adopt the title King of Scotland.|$|E
5|$|On {{a mission}} on P4X-639, a planet {{experiencing}} strong solar activity, the SG-1 team encounters an alien archaeologist named Malikai (Robin Mossley). When a geomagnetic disturbance hits its peak, the Stargate activates simultaneously {{on the planet}} and on Earth, and a flash strikes Malikai, Colonel O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson) and Teal'c (Christopher Judge) near an Ancient altar. Moments later, O'Neill finds himself in the Stargate Command (SGC) cafeteria {{in the middle of}} a breakfast conversation with Dr. Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks) and Major Carter (Amanda Tapping), who claim to have no knowledge of the planet. O'Neill and Teal'c later express <b>familiarity</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> events, and they are checked and certified to be in perfect health. Before SG-1 can resume their planned mission to the planet, an unscheduled offworld activation of the Earth Stargate, accompanied by flashes, transports O'Neill back to breakfast.|$|E
