5|$|The <b>habitat</b> <b>of</b> the Cuban macaw {{was open}} savanna terrain with {{scattered}} trees, {{typical of the}} Zapata Swamp area.

5|$|The red-winged fairywren is a {{cooperative}} breeding species, {{with a pair}} or small group of birds maintaining and defending a territory year-round.

5|$|Although data on Russulaceae {{themselves}} are scarce, more {{is known about}} the habitats they occur in, especially for the ectomycorrhizal species which depend on their host plants: Several of these habitats are affected by loss or degradation, such as peatlands, Mediterranean forests and scrub or tropical African dry woodland. Similarly, dead wood, the <b>habitat</b> <b>of</b> the corticioid Russulaceae, is rare in many exploited forests and needs special management.|$|E
5|$|Brachychiton rupestris {{has been}} {{recorded}} as a host plant for the mistletoe species Dendrophthoe glabrescens. Insects hosted by the species include the pale cotton stainer bug, a pest of cotton crops, and the kurrajong leaf roller caterpillar that chews on the foliage and rolls individual leaves, within which it then pupates. Bottle tree scrub is a key <b>habitat</b> <b>of</b> the near threatened black-breasted buttonquail. Brachychiton rupestris can withstand bushfires and responds by flowering and putting forth new foliage afterwards.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that the construction of Ithai Barrage has altered the Loktak Lake and its ecosystem. Siltation has reduced the water holding capacity and has consequently had a negative impact on the power generation capacity at the Loktak Hydro Electric Power Project. Thinning of the phumdi in the Keibul Lamjao area has affected the <b>habitat</b> <b>of</b> the sangai, and other aquafauna, avifauna and flora are on the decline; the 35 species (5 mammals, 3 birds, 9 reptiles, 3 amphibians, 12 fishes, 2 molluscs and 1 annelid) are reported to be disappearing gradually.|$|E
5|$|Its {{nesting site}} is more {{important}} than its foraging site in playing a role in determining the <b>habitat</b> <b>of</b> the black-throated blue warbler. The black-throated blue warbler is an open-nesting species, that nests very close to the ground so it has to choose a protected nesting site where the risk of predation is relatively low.|$|E
5|$|Like other New World vultures, the Andean condor has {{the unusual}} habit of urohidrosis: it often empties its cloaca onto its legs and feet. A cooling effect through {{evaporation}} {{has been proposed}} {{as a reason for}} this behavior, but it does not make any sense in the cold Andean <b>habitat</b> <b>of</b> the bird. Because of this habit, their legs are often streaked with a white buildup of uric acid.|$|E

5|$|Lincoln {{is one of}} the {{few large}} cities of Nebraska not located along either the Platte River or the Missouri River. The city was {{originally}} laid out near Salt Creek and among the nearly flat saline wetlands of northern Lancaster County. The city's growth over the years has led to development of the surrounding land, much of which is composed of gently rolling hills. In recent years, Lincoln's northward growth has encroached on the <b>habitat</b> <b>of</b> the endangered Salt Creek tiger beetle.|$|E
5|$|The fungus {{is rare in}} Europe and its {{distribution}} typically {{corresponds with}} high elevations {{at or near the}} alpine tree line. It is found in at least 11 countries, and has been included in the Red List of 8 countries. It is considered critically endangered in the Czech Republic. The European Council for Conservation of Fungi (ECCF) has suggested Suillus sibiricus be listed in Appendix II of the Bern Convention. Factors that threaten the <b>habitat</b> <b>of</b> S.sibiricus include deforestation and construction of skiing pistes and other infrastructure for winter sports.|$|E
5|$|The <b>habitat</b> <b>of</b> {{the splendid}} fairywren ranges from forest to dry scrub, {{generally}} with ample vegetation for shelter.

5|$|The park {{is among}} the most biologically diverse of Turkey's {{national}} parks. It is the native and migratory <b>habitat</b> <b>of</b> hundreds of species of birds, mammals, plants, and marine life, some of which are entirely endemic to the park and cannot be observed anywhere else in the world. For these reasons, it is protected by numerous wildlife and wetland conventions, and is of great national and international importance in these areas.|$|E
5|$|This species' {{preferred}} <b>habitat</b> <b>of</b> {{shallow water}} is naturally susceptible to {{problems such as}} drought or the encroachment of vegetation, but this duck's habitat might be increasingly threatened by climate change. Populations are also affected by the conversion of wetlands and grassland to arable crops, depriving the duck of feeding and nesting areas. Spring planting means that many nests of this early breeding duck are destroyed by farming activities, and a Canadian study showed {{that more than half}} of the surveyed nests were destroyed by agricultural work such as ploughing and harrowing.|$|E
5|$|As the Tairona of the Colombian Caribbean coast, the Muisca {{made the}} zoomorphic figurines {{based on the}} fauna with their <b>habitat</b> <b>of</b> the area. Main animals used for their figures were the frog and serpents. The serpents were made in zig-zag shapes with eyes {{on top of the}} head. Many serpentiform objects have the typical forked tongue of the snake {{represented}} as well as the fawns clearly added. Some of the snakes have beards, moustaches or even a human head. Researcher Gerardo Reichel-Dolmatoff theorised in his book Orfebrería y chamanismo in 1988 that the basis for the beards and moustaches may have been the abundant fish present on the Altiplano and essential part of the diet of the Muisca and their ancestors, as evidenced in Aguazuque; Eremophilus mutisii.|$|E
