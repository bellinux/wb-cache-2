40|$|Chemical-looping {{combustion}} {{with oxygen}} uncoupling (CLOU) {{is a method}} for combustion of solid and <b>gaseous</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels,</b> which enables easy separation of carbon dioxide from the gaseous product mixture. In contrast to the related chemical-looping combustion (CLC) technology where gaseous or gasified fuels react directly with oxygen carriers, CLOU processes require oxygen carrier materials {{to be able to}} release oxygen in the fuel reactor and to regenerate by re-oxidation in oxygen-rich atmosphere in the air reactor at elevated temperature. Oxygen uncoupling properties and reactivities for methane combustion of 12 oxygen carrier particles, produced from mixtures of manganese and magnesium oxides with optional addition of titanium dioxide or calcium hydroxide, are investigated in a quartz batch reactor at 810 degrees C, 850 degrees C, 900 degrees C and 950 degrees C. All investigated oxygen carriers have oxygen release characteristics. The addition of calcium hydroxide facilitates oxygen release and combustion of methane, whereas addition of titanium dioxide does not have a pronounced effect on either oxygen uncoupling or reactivity of the oxygen carrier. In general, particles with greater extent of oxygen release have superior methane combustion properties. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{concepts}} proposed for capture of CO 2 in power production from <b>gaseous</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> is the semi-closed O 2 /CO 2 gas turbine cycle. The semi-closed O 2 /CO 2 gas turbine cycle has a near to stoichiometric combustion with oxygen, producing CO 2 and water vapor as the combustion products. The water vapor is condensed and removed from the process, the remaining gas, primarily CO 2, is mainly recycled to keep turbine inlet temperature at a permissible level. A model for predicting transient behavior of the semi-closed O 2 /CO 2 gas turbine cycle is presented. The model is implemented in the simulation tool gPROMS (Process System Enterprise Ltd.), and simulations are performed to investigate two different issues. The first issue is to see how different cycle performance variables interact during transient behavior; the second is to investigate how cycle calculations are affected when including the gas constant and the specific heat ratio in compressor characteristics. The simulations show that the near to stoichiometric combustion and the working fluid recycle introduce a high interaction between the different cycle components and variables. This makes {{it very difficult to}} analytically predict the cycle performance during a transient event, i. e. simulations are necessary. It is also found that, except for the shaft speed calculation, the introduction of gas constant and specific heat ratio dependence on the compressor performance map will have only a minor influence on the process performance...|$|E

For this reason we decided to edit a new book, which can be consedered as a handbook or a vademecum containing a relatively complete collection of formulas, diagrams and tables, with the aim of supplying useful information about the properties of dry and moist air, fuels and flue gases. The book is useful for engineering students, researchers, professionals, plant operators and managers who are interested in quickly finding the data that will enable them to determine the mass and energy balances of the combustion processes taking place in furnaces, boilers and combustion chambers, supplied by whatever fuel.

40|$|Chemical-looping {{combustion}} (CLC) is {{a promising}} technology for CO 2 capture {{in the process}} of combustion of <b>gaseous</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels.</b> Oxygen carrier materials based on Ni/NiO on NiAl 2 O 4 and on NiAl 2 O 4 /MgAl 2 O 4 support have previously shown high initial activity combined with high conversion of methane and low concentration of outgoing CO. The feasibility of the Ni/NiO system for CLC depends largely on the lifetime of the oxygen carrier particles in the reactor due to the high price of the material. Avoiding chemical and physical degradation of oxygen carriers is essential for long-term industrial-scale chemical-looping combustion operations, and the particles' activity and mechanical durability have to remain high during long operation times. In this study, a series of oxygen carrier samples were collected from a 10 kW CLC combustor operated for a total of 1016 h using oxygen carrier materials based on NiO/NiAl 2 O 4 (N-VITO) for 405 h and a mixture of used NiO/NiAl 2 O 4 with fresh NiO/NiAl 2 O 4 /MgAl 2 O 4 (N-VITOMg) for 611 h, respectively. These samples were collected after certain time intervals and analyzed in terms of reactivity with methane in a quartz batch reactor. Also, the structural and mechanical properties of these samples were investigated by means of powder XRD, BET surface area measurements, light and scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry, and crushing strength evaluation. It was shown that both N-VITO and N-VITO/N-VITOMg demonstrate high reactivity and mechanical durability after having been used for more than 1000 h in the CLC 10 kW reactor, which makes them excellent candidates for applications within the area of chemical-looping combustion...|$|E
40|$|AbstractInterest in the {{technology}} of gasification has shown a number of ups and downs since its first appearance. It appears that interest in gasification research correlates closely with the relative cost and availability of liquid and <b>gaseous</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels.</b> Gasification is a versatile thermo-chemical conversion process which produces a gas mixture of H 2, CO and CH 4 the proportions being determined {{by the use of}} air, oxygen or steam as oxidizer, with a concomitant range of heat values, low (4 – 6 MJ/Nm 3), medium (12 – 18 MJ/Nm 3) and high (40 MJ/Nm 3). A variety of biomass gasifiers have been developed. Differentiation is based on the means of supporting the biomass in the reactor vessel, the direction of flow of both the biomass and oxidant, and the way heat is supplied to the reactor. Gases formed by gasification are contaminated by some constituents such as particles, alkali metals, nitrogen components, tars, sulfurs and chlorides. The level of contamination varies, depending on the gasification process and the feedstock. Gas cleaning must be applied to prevent erosion, corrosion and environmental problems in downstream equipment. In this work, a global perspective about the producer gas final composition dependence, the so-called syngas, from the biomass, oxidizer, reactor type, temperature and pressure is given based on a literature benchmarking. This study shows that there are some discrepancies in the values given by various authors. This highlights the strong dependence of the syngas final composition from the biomass conditions, type of gasifier and pressure and temperature of the process. Thus, in order to make precise studies on the use of syngas {{it will be necessary to}} consider that its composition will be rather constant. The development of mathematical models for numerical simulation fully validated experimentally are strongly desirable and may be a very useful tool to determine the final composition of syngas by changes in initial conditions without laborious and expensive experimental tests...|$|E

40|$|During {{the past}} century, fossil fuels—petroleum liquids, {{natural gas and}} coal—were the {{dominant}} source of world energy production.
