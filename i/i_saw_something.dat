He was recruited by two Division I schools: Butler University and his ultimate choice, the University of Cincinnati (UC)—an institution that was the alma mater of both his father and Youkilis' longtime idol, Sandy Koufax, and had just finished a 12–46 season. UC coach Brian Cleary spotted Youkilis at a winter camp. [...] "I looked at him and said, Well, we need somebody", said Cleary. [...] "I'd love to tell you <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>something</b> no one else did, but he was just better than what we had." ...|$|E
500|$|Anime News Network {{had four}} editors review {{the first episode}} of the anime: Carl Kimlinger saw {{potential}} in its take on a typical anime premise, praising Tatsuya as the lead protagonist and its handling of mysteries surrounding the plot; Theron Martin, although hopeful because of its male lead and plot concept, expressed criticism towards the indistinguishable animation and constant exposition for the viewers; and Rebecca Silverman {{felt that it was}} bland and nothing special. The fourth reviewer, Hope Chapman, expressed immediate dislike towards the series, criticizing it for lacking anything to engage the viewers and for being a lazy adaptation of a light novel, and concluding the review with [...] "I can't even remember the last time <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>something</b> with not a single redeeming factor or thing to recommend about it at all." [...] Silverman reviewed the series future episodes. Plotwise, she praised the Enrollment Arcs underline on standardized testing, criticized the Nine Schools Competition Arc for its execution and weak exposition, and felt the characters were uninteresting. Silverman felt the series doesn't live up to its potential and cited the background music and stilted animations as possible reasons.|$|E
500|$|... "Back to December"'s {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Yoann Lemoine, who directed the video for Katy Perry's [...] "Teenage Dream", and was filmed in late December 2010 before Christmas Day. In an interview with Country Music Television, Lemoine explained that he developed {{the idea for the}} video after being inspired from the film, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. He also told MTV News that he wanted the video to be simple yet metaphorical. He added, [...] "I wanted to work on the coldness of feelings in a very visual way, playing with the snow, the distance and sadness." [...] He wanted to focus on Swift's look in the video so that she would come off as accessible, saying [...] "I wanted her to perform a very natural way, to make her look very European. This was the main challenge to me. All of Taylor's world is very far away from my culture, but <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>something</b> in her that could be very rough and heartbreaking; far from the princess glittery outfits and glam that she often goes for." [...] Lemoine was allowed {{to take control of the}} whole production of the video, although it was Swift's idea to have her character leave the letter for her beloved. Swift's love interest in the video was played by male model, Guntars Asmanis. Lemoine commented that Asmanis was the perfect fit for Swift's love interest, saying [...] "I wanted a boy that was fragile and beautiful. I didn't want to go for a hunk or a perfect cheesy boy that would have killed the sincerity of the video." [...] The music video premiered on January 13, 2011, on CMT and Great American Country. Footages of the school and baseball stadium in the video were filmed in Binghamton, New York, in MacArthur Park while scenes with Swift were shot in an old country mansion outside of Nashville.|$|E

2500|$|Sebastian Rhodes Stampa, {{head of a}} UN {{disaster}} assessment co-ordination team, {{said there}} was [...] "destruction on a massive scale" [...] in Tacloban. [...] "There are cars thrown like tumbleweed and the streets are strewn with debris. The last time <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>something</b> of this scale was {{in the aftermath of}} the [...] Indian Ocean tsunami." [...] There is little communication in the city, and no mobile phone coverage. Up the east coast of the Leyte there are numerous towns and villages that are completely cut off without any assistance. Large parts of Leyte and Samar are without power and may have no power for a month.|$|E
2500|$|After their disappearance, several expeditions {{tried to}} find their remains and, perhaps, {{determine}} if they had reached the summit. Frank Smythe, when on the 1936 expedition, believed he spotted a body below the place where Irvine's ice axe was found three years earlier, [...] "I was scanning the face from base camp through a high-powered telescope...when <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>something</b> queer in a gully below the scree shelf. Of course {{it was a long}} way away and very small, but I've a six/six eyesight and do not believe it was a rock. This object was at precisely the point where Mallory and Irvine would have fallen had they rolled on over the scree slopes," [...] Smythe {{wrote in a letter to}} Edward Felix Norton. He kept the discovery quiet as he feared press sensationalism, and it was not revealed until 2013, after the letter was found by his son when preparing his biography.|$|E
2500|$|Initially, Burke did not {{condemn the}} French Revolution. In {{a letter of}} 9 August 1789, he wrote: [...] "England gazing with astonishment at a French {{struggle}} for Liberty and not knowing whether to blame or to applaud! The thing indeed, though I thought <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>something</b> like it in progress for several years, has still something in it paradoxical and Mysterious. The spirit it is impossible not to admire; but the old Parisian ferocity has broken out in a shocking manner". The events of 5–6 October 1789, when a crowd of Parisian women marched on Versailles to compel King Louis XVI to return to Paris, turned Burke against it. In {{a letter to his}} son, Richard Burke, dated 10 October he said: [...] "This day I heard from Laurence who has sent me papers confirming the portentous state of France—where the Elements which compose Human Society seem all to be dissolved, and a world of Monsters to be produced in the place of it—where Mirabeau presides as the Grand Anarch; and the late Grand Monarch makes a figure as ridiculous as pitiable". On 4 November Charles-Jean-François Depont wrote to Burke, requesting that he endorse the Revolution. Burke replied that any critical language of it by him should be taken [...] "as no more than the expression of doubt" [...] but he added: [...] "You may have subverted Monarchy, but not recover'd freedom". In the same month he described France as [...] "a country undone". Burke's first public condemnation of the Revolution occurred on the debate in Parliament on the army estimates on 9 February 1790, provoked by praise of the Revolution by Pitt and Fox: ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes; the {{explanation}} {{would then have}} been obvious; but what <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> suggests <b>something</b> graver.

60|$|We {{got going}} again, and had scarce trolled {{a hundred yards}} when <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>something</b> my companions missed. I stood up.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, only restless, Dick," [...] he replied. [...] "By the way, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>something</b> strange," [...] he continued, and he {{related the}} occurrence.|$|E

60|$|I {{received}} no answer. The Young Person's face became more unfinished than ever, and I think {{she began to}} cry. <b>I</b> certainly <b>saw</b> <b>something</b> moist about her eyes. Tears or perspiration? Louis (whom I have just consulted) is inclined to think, tears. He is in her class of life, and he ought to know best. Let us say, tears.|$|R
6000|$|... "Go on," [...] I said, {{in a hard}} voice; for <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> he had <b>something</b> to say. [...] "Don't {{mind for}} my heart. Tell me the truth. I can stand it." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>something</b> else also--a woman {{holding a}} sword {{with both hands}} and {{stabbing}} downward, after which the grip of the Hebrew loosened from Seti's throat.|$|E

6000|$|... "Because it {{was only}} my word against that of Sanders, and {{it was only}} after Gordon told me how much he was in debt to the man; and that the latter had, that morning, written to him calling upon him to pay up, that <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> that <b>something</b> must be done. So I asked Tritton, Lindsay, and Holmes to watch him closely this evening, along with me." ...|$|R
60|$|I think {{everyone}} {{expected to see}} a man emerge--possibly something a little unlike us terrestrial men, but in all essentials a man. I know I did. But, looking, <b>I</b> presently <b>saw</b> <b>something</b> stirring within the shadow: greyish billowy movements, one above another, and then two luminous disks--like eyes. Then something resembling a little grey snake, about the thickness of a walking stick, coiled up out of the writhing middle, and wriggled in the air towards me--and then another.|$|R
60|$|I {{was in this}} {{frame of}} mind when the captain {{proposed}} that we should land upon the island. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> he had <b>something</b> to say, and only feared it might be consolation, for I could just bear my grief, not bungling sympathy; and yet I {{had no choice but}} to accede to his proposal.|$|R
60|$|There was an instant's pause. I fancied that <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>something</b> pass between Louis and Delora. The latter {{turned away}} with a little shrug of the shoulders.|$|E

60|$|There was {{a slight}} ray of light coming from some slit or grating. The dawn had broken outside, and I could dimly see the long, curving sides of several huge casks, which made me think that perhaps this was where the Mayor kept his {{reserves}} of wine while they were maturing.

60|$|I {{watched them}} as though fascinated. The change in Mr. Moss was amazing. His {{reckless}} air of enjoyment had departed.
