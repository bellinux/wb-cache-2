500|$|However, {{microbiologist}} David Pearce of the University of Northumbria in Newcastle, UK, {{stated that}} the DNA could simply be contamination from the drilling process, and not representative of Lake Vostok itself. The old ice cores were drilled in the 1990s to look for evidence of past climates buried in the ice, rather than for life, so the <b>drilling</b> <b>equipment</b> was not sterilized. [...] Also Sergey Bulat, a Lake Vostok expert at the Petersburg Nuclear Physics Institute in Gatchina, Russia, doubts {{that any of the}} cells or DNA fragments in the samples would belong to organisms that might actually exist in the lake. He says that it is very probable that the samples are heavily contaminated with tissue and microbes from the outside world.|$|E
500|$|Drilling fluids {{are chosen}} {{to balance the}} {{pressure}} so that the hole remains stable. [...] The fluid must have a low kinematic viscosity to reduce tripping time (the time taken to pull the <b>drilling</b> <b>equipment</b> {{out of the hole}} and return it {{to the bottom of the}} hole). [...] Since retrieval of each segment of core requires tripping, a slower speed of travel through the drilling fluid could add significant time to a project—a year or more for a deep hole. [...] The fluid must contaminate the ice as little as possible; it must have low toxicity, for safety and to minimize the effect on the environment; it must be available at a reasonable cost; and it must be relatively easy to transport. [...] Historically, there have been three main types of ice drilling fluids: two-component fluids based on kerosene-like products mixed with fluorocarbons to increase density; alcohol compounds, including aqueous ethylene glycol and ethanol solutions; and esters, including n-butyl acetate. [...] Newer fluids have been proposed, including new ester-based fluids, low-molecular weight dimethyl siloxane oils, fatty-acid esters, and kerosene-based fluids mixed with foam-expansion agents.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Greenstone belt golden ore {{prospecting}} {{project at}} Victoria Lake in Tanzania consisted of seven boreholes {{and a total}} of 2500 meters of drilling. In fact, twelve boreholes were completed {{and a total of}} 3201. 2 meters of drilling were realized. It created our record of maximum drilling meters and drilling production in five months using one drill rig. The paper introduces drilling technologies used on this district from the aspects of geographic and geological overview, <b>drilling</b> <b>equipments,</b> <b>drilling</b> technologies, drill bit, drilling mud and main economic indicators. It may offer guidance for drilling in similar districts...|$|R
40|$|When {{the first}} well is drilled at a {{geothermal}} field, {{procedures for the}} cleaning, repair, and control of wells should be established. This aspect will be increasingly important as more wells are <b>drilled.</b> <b>Equipment,</b> tools and techniques need to be improved to achieve economic and safe results. Different systems have been developed and applied in maintenance of wells, in problems of casing incrustations, repairs, plugging, and well control. These systems should be improved, {{even though they have}} been reasonably satisfactory to date...|$|R
2500|$|Icebergs calved {{from the}} glaciers of Greenland earned {{this stretch of}} water the unaffectionate {{nickname}} [...] "Iceberg Alley." [...] Icebergs drifting toward <b>drilling</b> <b>equipment</b> posed a unique hazard for the industry in that forbidding environment. But using a blend of cowboy and maritime technology, Labrador drillers handled the problem by lassoing the bergs with polypropylene ropes and steel hawsers, then towing {{them out of the}} way.|$|E

The drilling mast and substructure have a rated capacity of 1,300,000lbs {{and can be}} skidded to drill a well to the maximum depth of [...] through {{any of the four}} moon pools. Internally, the drilling unit can hold enough supplies to drill three to five wells depending on the well depth. In addition to <b>drilling</b> <b>equipment,</b> the topside includes two cranes, a helicopter platform, and accommodation for 90 workers.|$|E

30|$|Drilling deep {{boreholes}} in shale formations can be difficult, {{especially when}} the borehole deviates. In such a situation, frictional forces between the <b>drilling</b> <b>equipments</b> (bottom hole assembly and casing) and the host rock mass can be very high and the drilling tools can be easily stuck (Azar 2006; Fontoura et al. 2012; Padma Raju and Kumara Swany 2012). The installation of casing strings can also be complicated in such conditions {{and the risk of}} encountering problems is high (Mason et al. 2000; Sanchez and Al-Harthy 2011).|$|R

2500|$|The {{high level}} of {{production}} proved to be unsustainable. Development work of new reserves could not {{keep pace with the}} production of 6,000 tons of crude ore per month. In January 1943 production had to be scaled down, and the ore dressing mill reduced to a single shift per day. But a bigger blow was to follow. In May 1943, as one of the shafts was being deepened, the miners encountered bands of soft, black shale. The Ministry sent in a team of Canadian Engineers with diamond <b>drilling</b> <b>equipment,</b> and this confirmed that the Skiddaw Group of rocks lay at about [...] below the main entrance to the mine (The Lucy Level), not at [...] as the geologists had predicted. The rich bonanza of ore the company had expected was not there.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the evening}} of November 23, a wildcat well being drilled into a {{promising}} anticlinal fold underneath the Monterey Formation, northeast of the main Lost Hills field, reached the depth of [...] and hit a previously untapped reservoir of gas under intense pressure. Natural gas and petroleum condensate burst from the well, immediately exploding into flame, knocking over the massive drilling rig, destroying the trailer, and melting the nearby <b>drilling</b> <b>equipment.</b> This enormous pillar of fire, which rose to [...] into the sky, could be seen more than [...] away, and the quantity of oil release was estimated at 2000BOPD and gas bursting from the well has been estimated at 80 MMscft/day. It burned for fourteen days, and continued spewing even after the fire was out; only a secondary well bore, drilled at a slant to intercept the main well, was able to plug the opening and snuff the blowout at last.|$|E
2500|$|... 83.5% of {{the borough}} was officially defined as {{conservation}} space; however, {{the increase in}} illegal settlements and logging has been eroding this percentage. The forests {{are important to the}} Valley of Mexico/Mexico City as they not only release oxygen into the air, they are an important area for the recharge of the valley’s aquifers. Wells from this borough provide 70% of Mexico City’s potable water. The borough has 120 wells for potable water (out of a total of 450 in the District), which extract about 60 liters each second from each well. However, water shortages are relatively common in the borough proper. Most of {{this is due to the}} lack of wells, <b>drilling</b> <b>equipment</b> and pipelines to serve local residents, with the city authorities only reserving less than a fifth of its infrastructure budget for works in Tlalpan. One serious outage of water occurred in 2001 when thirty nine of the borough’s colonias were without dependable water for two weeks because of the lack of water reserves. Deforestation and other ecological damage make a number of areas susceptible to flooding during the rainy season from June to October. These include Anillo Periférico, Renato Leduc, Boulevard de la Luz and the Picacho Highway. Forest fires are a common problem not only in the Bosque de Tlalpan but also in Parque Fuentes Brotantes, Parque Ciudad de Mexico and the Cerro de Zacatepetl.|$|E
