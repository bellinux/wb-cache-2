In the measurement test for energy consumption of the <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> <b>system</b> with the actual vehicle on test courses, KEEPS got 48 % less at city mode, 41 % less at highway mode and 39 % less at country mode compared with the conventional hydraulic <b>steering</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{electric}} <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> <b>system</b> (EPS) is {{a combination}} of mechanical and electrical control system. EPS’control strategy used commonly has two kinds: current PID control and fuzzy control. The current PID control based on the difference between target current and feedback current is a curren closed-loop control system and the fuzzy control is a mechanical closed-loop control system based on the difference between forces of the upper part and {{the lower part of the}} steering shaft. Taking the margin of the mechanical and electrical closed-loop control system, this paper, a torque feedback loop for the outer ring, a current feedback loop as the inner loop, designed a dual-loop control system, the output of the fuzzy control determined a target current, and then proceed to current PID control, fast-track the target torque. The simulation shows the dual closed-loop fuzzy PID control is superior to two commonly used control strategies so that electric <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> <b>system</b> has a better tracking ability and stability.

50|$|Francis W. Davis, an {{engineer}} {{of the truck}} division of Pierce-Arrow, began exploring how steering could be made easier, and in 1926 invented and demonstrated the first practical <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> <b>system.</b> Davis moved to General Motors and refined the hydraulic-assisted <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> <b>system,</b> but the automaker calculated {{it would be too}} expensive to produce. Davis then signed up with Bendix, a parts manufacturer for automakers. Military needs during World War II for easier steering on heavy vehicles boosted the need for power assistance on armored cars and tank-recovery vehicles for the British and American armies.|$|R

50|$|Electric <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> <b>systems</b> use {{electric}} motors {{to provide the}} assistance instead of hydraulic systems. As with hydraulic types, power to the actuator (motor, in this case) {{is controlled by the}} rest of the power-steering system.|$|R
5000|$|An {{outgrowth}} of <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> is speed sensitive steering, where the steering is heavily assisted {{at low speed}} and lightly assisted at high speed. Auto makers perceive that motorists might need to make large steering inputs while manoeuvering for parking, but not while traveling at high speed. The first vehicle with this feature was the Citroën SM with its Diravi layout, although rather than altering the amount of assistance as in modern <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> <b>systems,</b> it altered the pressure on a centring cam which made the steering wheel try to [...] "spring" [...] back to the straight-ahead position. Modern speed-sensitive <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> <b>systems</b> reduce the mechanical or electrical assistance as the vehicle speed increases, giving a more direct feel. This feature is gradually becoming more common.|$|R
