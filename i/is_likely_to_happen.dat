On 30 April, Barrett spoke out about the speculations on Radio 5. She revealed that the group had been [...] "talking about it" [...] and stated that a reunion <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> if {{they come up with}} a [...] "good plan". She was also pursuing her solo career at that time, she was the only group member who didn't during the break-up. In spring 2012 the group, now renamed 'S Club Party' set out on a tour of Australia with other noughties' hit group, Big Brovaz. On 30 May 2012, S Club featured on Australia's Channel 7 The Morning Show, announcing they are in the country for a national tour from 23 May to 2 June 2012. Subsequent to this appearance, a video of the performance was uploaded to YouTube, where the reaction was largely negative with many viewers expressing the opinion that the performance was uncomfortable to watch, with the absence of the four other members of the original band causing some disillusionment among childhood fans of the group.|$|E

2500|$|Some writers use [...] "the singularity" [...] in {{a broader}} way to refer to any radical changes in our society brought about by new {{technologies}} such as molecular nanotechnology, although Vinge and other writers specifically state that without superintelligence, such changes would not qualify as a true singularity.

2500|$|In brief, {{sensemaking}} {{is viewed}} more as [...] "a motivated, continuous {{effort to understand}} connections (which can be among people, places, and events) in order to anticipate their trajectories and act effectively", rather than the state of knowledge underlying situation awareness. Endsley points out that as an effortful process, sensemaking is actually considering {{a subset of the}} processes used to maintain situation awareness. In {{the vast majority of the}} cases, SA is instantaneous and effortless, proceeding from pattern recognition of key factors in the environment—"The speed of operations in activities such as sports, driving, flying and air traffic control practically prohibits such conscious deliberation in the majority of cases, but rather reserves it for the exceptions." [...] Endsley also points out that sensemaking is backward focused, forming reasons for past events, while situation awareness is typically forward looking, projecting what <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> in order to inform effective decision processes.|$|E

2500|$|De Grey {{and other}} {{scientists}} in the general field {{have argued that the}} costs of a rapidly growing aging population will increase to the degree that the costs of an accelerated pace of aging research are easy to justify in terms of future costs avoided. Olshansky et al. 2006 argue, for example, that the total economic cost of Alzheimer's disease in the US alone will increase from $80–100 billion today to more than $1 trillion in 2050. [...] "Consider what <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> if we don't [...] Take, for instance, the impact of just one age-related disorder, Alzheimer disease (AD). For no other reason than the inevitable shifting demographics, the number of Americans stricken with AD will rise from 4 million today to as many as 16 million by midcentury. This means that more people in the United States will have AD by 2050 than the entire current population of the Netherlands. Globally, AD prevalence is expected to rise to 45 million by 2050, with three of every four patients with AD living in a developing nation. The US economic toll is currently $80–$100 billion, but by 2050 more than $1 trillion will be spent annually on AD and related dementias. The impact of this single disease will be catastrophic, and this is just one example." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ptolemy first {{proposes that}} it is not [...] "useless" [...] to create {{predictions}} of what <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen,</b> even if the predictions do not provide the means to avoid impending disaster. This was one of the well known classical criticisms that had been brought to prominence in Cicero's text De Divinatione, in the argument that no good comes from warnings of imminent disasters when they [...] offer no means of escape. Ptolemy gives a more positive view of divination in his assessment of astrology as a subject [...] "by which we gain full view of things human and divine", which, he argues, gives a better perception of [...] "what is fitting and expedient for the capabilities of each temperament". He views astrology as a subject which encourages enhanced self-knowledge, to be valued as a source of pleasure and well-being; since even if astrology cannot aid in the acquisition of riches or fame; {{the same can be said}} of all philosophy, which concerns itself with [...] "greater advantages". Hence, in the case of unfortunate events that will necessarily take place, Ptolemy asserts that astrological prediction still brings benefits, because [...] "foreknowledge accustoms and calms the soul by experience of distant events as though they were present, and prepares it to greet with calm and steadiness whatever comes".|$|E
