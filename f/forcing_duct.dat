40|$|Auxiliary {{ventilation}} {{refers to}} the systems {{that are used to}} supply fresh air to the working faces in dead end including the use of a push-pull arrangement. There are many advantages of using such a system when compared to other methods. It has been shown that for headings longer than 30 m, auxiliary fans are the only practicable means of delivering the required air quantities. Besides air quantities, air quality is another critical issue for evaluating the ventilation efficiency in underground mines. Forcing and exhausting ducts used in the push-pull system are closely associated with the ventilation efficiency. This paper focuses on the efficiency evaluation for a push-pull ventilation system by using two methods, the dead zone and the mean age of air. By using the CFD technology, the air velocity and air quality are calculated and compared in four different cases. The results of evaluation will be identical by using these two methods. It is concluded that in the push-pull ventilation system, the position of the <b>forcing</b> <b>duct</b> plays a major role on the ventilation efficiency. Also, when the <b>forcing</b> <b>duct</b> position is determined, there must be a particular position of the exhausting duct to provide best ventilation efficiency...|$|E

40|$|The {{deflection}} of {{a spiral}} duct {{depends on its}} flat span, gauge, pressure, and reinforcement. Furthermore, the duct weight determines the cost of installation, not only in material costs but also labor, which is bid by the duct weight. The current duct deflection standard, the rectangular-duct construction standard, does not accurately represent flat-oval spiral ducts. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} project was to perform those experiments necessary to support the development of a standard for the installation of flat-oval spiral ducting. Also in support of standard development, the project developed empirical models to represent unreinforced ducts for positive and negative pressures along with T- 25 ducts for positive pressures. In conclusion, the development of a flat-oval spiral duct deflection standard is important to the HVAC industry, because it would allow engineers to perform reliable duct design with a focus on reductions in material and installation cost. The collected data, empirical modeling, and data analysis that has resulted from this project will form the foundation for development of a flat-oval duct deflection standard. Specifically, the project reported herein resulted in deflection-pressure data for a broad range of un- reinforced and reinforced ducts. The test matrix was designed to provide sufficient experimental data to develop empirical deflection models for unreinforced ducts and T- 25 positive-pressure ducts. In addition, a more limited test matrix for other rein- <b>forced</b> <b>ducts</b> allows for qualitative analysis and empirical observations. The contour plots, constructed with the aid of empirical models, can be used to identify duct sizes and types that satisfy deflection criteria at specific pressures, which is a major step in developing duct standards...|$|R

40|$|The flow at low Reynolds number around {{rectangular}} cylinders {{of varying}} chord-to-thickness ratios under transverse periodic forcing is studied numerically. Although of relatively low amplitude, the forcing locks the shedding {{from both the}} {{leading and trailing edges}} to the applied frequency. The base suction, and the lift and the drag on the cylinders are found to be complex functions of the forcing frequency. At low Reynolds numbers and without applied forcing, the flow is controlled by a global instability with the leading- and trailing-edge shedding locked; moreover, the reduced frequency of shedding varies in a stepwise manner with the chord-to-thickness ratio. This global instability is still evident in the flows under external forcing examined in this paper. While previous researchers have conjectured that the trailing-edge shedding plays a dominant role in the preferred frequency selection in the natural shedding case, the important role of trailing-edge shedding when the flow is forced is confirmed in the present study. In particular, the individual contributions from leading- and trailing-edge vortices on the perturbation to the leading-edge shear layer are examined. In addition, it is shown that the base suction is maximum when the forcing frequency is close to the global instability frequency observed in unforced flows, thereby strengthening the argument that the unforced, <b>forced,</b> and <b>duct</b> resonant cases are strongly influenced by the same global instability. The variations of the lift, drag and formation length with chord-to-thickness ratio are quantified. 1...|$|R

The filtered, incompressible Navier-Stokes equa-tions are solved using a co-located grid finite-volume solver with the dynamic Smagorin-sky model for subgrid scale closure. The computational grid consists of around seven million grid points with three million points clustered around the shear layer and the boundary-layer over the leading edge is resolved. The only input from the experimental data is the mean velocity profile at the inlet condition. The mean flow is superimposed with turbulent velocity fluctuations generated by solving a <b>forced</b> periodic <b>duct</b> flow at free-stream Reynolds number. The flow statistics, including mean and rms velocity fields and pressure coefficients, are compared with the experimental data to show rea-sonable agreement.

Cavita-tion inception is investigated using two approaches: (i) a discrete bubble model wherein the bubble dynamics is computed by solving the Rayleigh-Plesset and the bubble motion equations using an adaptive time-stepping procedure, and (ii) a scalar transport model for the liquid volume fraction with source and sink terms for phase change. LES to-gether with the cavitation models predict that inception occurs near the trailing edge similar to that observed in the experiments.

40|$|Ducted {{propellers}} {{find their}} application {{in a wide}} range of marine vessels, such as cargo ships, tugboats, submarines, trawlers etc. Preference over the open propeller depends on a variety of factors, the most common being increased thrust at high propeller loadings. Different duct designs have been developed based on the operational requirements, the most popular type being the accelerating duct. With the entire marine industry pushing for energy efficiency and optimized design each passing day, it has been imperative to evaluate certain aspects which had not typically been classified as ‘design criteria’, but, bear the prospect of influencing the actual performance of the propulsion unit, and hence, the operation of the vessel for which they are employed. One important aspect is related to the nature of the sea itself. For most of its life span, a vessel has to operate in waves, and hence the hydrodynamics of the propulsion unit might be strongly affected by sea conditions, which is not calm water, as used as design condition. The first part of this work focusses on the behaviour of a cargo vessel in waves, when propelled by a ducted propeller. The main point of interest is the hydrodynamic behaviour, which includes the added resistance, motions, and accelerations of the vessel in presence of waves. The study is based on results from model seakeeping tests, as well as a linear strip theory based potential flow solver ShipX Veres. The influence of the duct has been evaluated by comparison of the behaviour of the same vessel propeller by an open propeller of similar design. It was found that- the duct has very little influence on the seakeeping properties for the large cargo vessel. However, interesting differences have been observed between the propulsion factors in waves for the open and ducted propulsion cases, in spite of much similar calm water characteristics. A very striking feature for the ducted propeller is the significant increase in the propulsion point effective wake fraction in waves compared to calm water conditions. The other aspect of investigation in this work is the scale effect, which affects the propeller characteristics when model scale open water data are used to evaluate the performance in full scale. Scale effect in itself is a widely researched topic in ship hydrodynamics, considering applications in both ship resistance and propulsion domains, but there is a scarcity of knowledge and no generally recognized scaling procedure for ducted propellers. Common experiences report a ducted propeller in full scale to be operating in a lighter loading than that it is designed for, when calculations are performed using model values. Due to a large difference of Reynolds number between the model and full scale conditions, the corresponding flow characteristics are different, and often a change of flow regime is observed between them. For a ducted propeller, these changes affect the propeller and <b>duct</b> <b>forces,</b> as well as the interaction between them, which strongly influence the integral characteristics and efficiency. Based on extensive research, many approaches have been developed for the scaling of open propeller characteristics, one of them being the ITTC method. However, due to load-dependent strong duct propeller interaction, use of a simplified scaling approach is not possible for a ducted propeller. A systematic study has been carried out in this work to calculate the scale effects of a controllable-pitch propeller working within different duct designs. CFD calculations in both model and full scales using the RANSE solver of Star-CCM+ has been the backbone of this study. Model scale open water tests and paint tests at different propeller speeds have been carried out to estimate the propeller and <b>duct</b> <b>forces,</b> as well as the streamline patterns over the propeller blade and duct. It is observed that the duct thrust and therefore also the duct induced velocities increase in the full scale, causing the propeller to operate at a higher effective advance number compared to model scale conditions. An important objective of the scale effect study is to develop a suitable scaling procedure for general use. The proposed scaling approach is derived from CFD calculations at different Reynolds numbers and loading conditions. It is a component-based procedure, where the scale effects on the pressure and friction components of the propeller and <b>duct</b> <b>forces</b> are calculated separately based on dependencies on factors like Reynolds number, thrust loading, blade pitch ratio, and duct geometry. The aim of such a scaling procedure is to obtain the full scale open water diagram from the model scale diagram, without full scale calculations for each individual case. The procedure shows promising results, but more work is needed before it can be adopted for general use...|$|R

Examples of this are reconnaissance, surveillance, environmental monitoring, disaster observation, etc. The School of Aerospace, Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering (SAMME) at RMIT University has designed a novel concept for a ducted-fan UAV with vertical takeoff and landing capability and the option to transition to horizontal flight. The aerodynamic analysis, preliminary and detailed design, of this ducted-fan VTOL UAV, is the first and most important step. To optimize the aerodynamic characteristics, evaluating aerodynamic coefficients and analyzing the flow patterns around the vehicle at different speeds and angles of attack is necessary. In this project, CFD {{plays an important role in}} predicting the longitudinal and lateral stability and control characteristics of a full-scale model of ducted fan VTOL UAV at both vertical and horizontal flight without any prior knowledge of existing wind tunnel or flight test data. Prior to carrying out experiments in the wind tunnel, the manufacture of ducted fan VTOL UAV was focused on. Particular attention was paid to the propulsion system as the key point. The full-scale model of UAV was produced using the Rapid Prototyping Facility at SAMME to ensure its accurate geometric shape for testing in the wind tunnel. The experiments of the full-scale UAV model with engines was conducted in RMIT&# 039;s Industrial Wind Tunnel where its aerodynamic characteristics and its properties of counter-rotating propulsion system were tested. In addition, the correlation between experimental data and CFD results was evaluated and the accuracy of the dynamic model of ducted fan VTOL UAV was improved. Flight dynamics is concerned with the motion of an aircraft due to internally or externally generated <b>forces.</b> The <b>ducted</b> fan VTOL UAV stability and control derivatives are determined and used as a basis in a flight simulation environment. This simulation showed that the vehicle is stable and controllable for a range of flight speeds. Finally, a MIMO linear control system was designed to control the vehicle in hovering and low-speed slide flight. The real-time simulation and modeling in MATLAB combined with a flight-simulator showed several animations and trajectories of UAV missions with or without crosswind effect during flight. These simulations were very helpful in determining the dynamic behaviour of the vehicle under various flight conditions...|$|R
40|$|The DeltaQ test is {{a method}} of {{estimating}} the air leakage from <b>forced</b> air <b>duct</b> systems. Developed primarily for residential and small commercial applications it uses the changes in blower door test results due to forced air system operation. Previous studies established the principles behind DeltaQ testing, but raised issues of precision of the test, particularly for leaky homes on windy days. Details of the measurement technique are available in an ASTM Standard (ASTM E 1554 - 2007). In order to ease adoption of the test method, this study answers questions regarding the uncertainty due to changing weather during the test (particularly changes in wind speed) and the applicability to low leakage systems. The first question arises because the building envelope air flows and pressures used in the DeltaQ test are influenced by weather induced pressures. Variability in wind induced pressures rather than temperature difference induced pressures dominates this effect because the wind pressures change rapidly over the time period of a test. The second question needs to answered so that DeltaQ testing {{can be used in}} programs requiring or giving credit for tight ducts (e. g., California's Building Energy Code (CEC 2005)). DeltaQ modeling biases have been previously investigated in laboratory studies where there was no weather induced changes in envelope flows and pressures. Laboratory work by Andrews (2002) and Walker et al. (2004) found biases of about 0. 5 % of forced air system blower flow and individual test uncertainty of about 2 % of forced air system blower flow. The laboratory tests were repeated by Walker and Dickerhoff (2006 and 2008) using a new ramping technique that continuously varied envelope pressures and air flows rather than taking data at pre-selected pressure stations (as used in ASTM E 1554 - 2003 and other previous studies). The biases and individual test uncertainties for ramping were found to be very close (less than 0. 5 % of air handler flow) to those found in for the pressure station approach. Walker and Dickerhoff also included estimates of DeltaQ test repeatability {{based on the results of}} field tests where two houses were tested multiple times. The two houses were quite leaky (20 - 25 Air Changes per Hour at 50 Pa (0. 2 in. water) (ACH 50)) and were located in the San Francisco Bay area. One house was tested on a calm day and the other on a very windy day. Results were also presented for two additional houses that were tested by other researchers in Minneapolis, MN and Madison, WI, that had very tight envelopes (1. 8 and 2. 5 ACH 50). These tight houses had internal duct systems and were tested without operating the central blower [...] sometimes referred to as control tests. The standard deviations between the multiple tests for all four houses were found to be about 1 % of the envelope air flow at 50 Pa (0. 2 in. water) (Q 50) that led to the suggestion of this as a rule of thumb for estimating DeltaQ uncertainty. Because DeltaQ is based on measuring envelope air flows it makes sense for uncertainty to scale with envelope leakage. However, these tests were on a limited data set and one of the objectives of the current study is to increase the number of tested houses. This study focuses on answering two questions: (1) What is the uncertainty associated with changes in weather (primarily wind) conditions during DeltaQ testing? (2) How can these uncertainties be reduced? The first question is addressing issues of repeatability. To study this five houses were tested as many times as possible over a day. Weather data was recorded on-site [...] including the local windspeed. The result from these five houses were combined with the two Bay Area homes from the previous studies. The variability of the tests (represented by the standard deviation) is the repeatability of the test method for that house under the prevailing weather conditions. Because the testing was performed over a day a wide range of wind speeds was achieved following typical diurnal variations of low wind in the early morning and greatest winds in the late afternoon/early evening. Typically about ten tests were performed in each house. To answer the second question, different data analysis techniques were investigated that looked at averaging techniques, elimination of outliers, limiting leak pressures, etc. in order to minimize the influence of changing wind conditions during the test. The objective was to find a reasonable compromise between test precision and robustness [...] because many of the changes to the analysis to make the test more robust limit its ability to examine wide ranges of pressures and leakage flows. A secondary goal of this study is to show that DeltaQ uncertainties are acceptable for testing low leakage systems. Therefore houses with low duct leakage were deliberately chosen to be tested...|$|R
