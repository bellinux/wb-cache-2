5|$|Around 1923, Zobel's filter {{designs were}} {{reaching}} {{the peak of}} their complexity. He now had a <b>filter</b> <b>section</b> {{to which he had}} doubly applied the m-derivation process resulting in filter sections which he called the mm'-type. This had all the advantages of the previous m-type, but more so. An even faster transition into the stop-band and an even more constant characteristic impedance in the pass-band. At the same time one side would match into the old m-type, just as the m-type could match into the k-type. Because there were now two arbitrary parameters (m and m') that the filter designer could adjust, much better end matching half-sections could be designed. A composite filter using these sections would have been the very best that could have been achieved at that time. However, the mm'-type sections never became as widespread and well known as the m-type sections, possibly because their greater complexity has deterred designers. They would have been inconvenient to implement with microwave technology and the increased count of components, especially wound components, made them more expensive to implement with conventional LC technology. Certainly, it is hard to find a textbook from any period which covers their design.|$|E

500|$|Zobel {{directed}} much of {{his effort}} in the 1920s to constructing networks which could simulate transmission lines. These networks were derived from <b>filter</b> <b>sections,</b> which themselves had been derived from transmission line theory and the filters were used on transmission line signals. [...] In turn, these artificial lines were used to develop and test better <b>filter</b> <b>sections.</b>|$|R
5|$|A {{composite}} {{image filter}} is an electronic filter consisting of multiple image <b>filter</b> <b>sections</b> {{of two or}} more different types.|$|R
500|$|Zobel {{invented the}} m-derived (or m-type) <b>filter</b> <b>section</b> in 1920, the {{distinguishing}} {{feature of this}} design being a pole of attenuation close to the filter cut-off frequency. The result of this design is a filter response which falls very rapidly past the cut-off frequency. To use a well known quaint engineer's expression it [...] "goes off like {{the side of a}} house". A fast transition between pass-band and stop-band was one of the primary requirements for cramming as many telephone channels as possible into one cable.|$|E
500|$|The m-derived or m-type <b>filter</b> <b>section</b> is a {{development}} of the k-type section. [...] The most prominent feature of the m-type is a pole of attenuation just past the cut-off frequency inside the stopband. [...] The parameter m(0<m<1) adjusts the position of this pole of attenuation. [...] Smaller values of m put the pole closer to the cut-off frequency. [...] Larger values of m put it further away. [...] In the limit, as m approaches unity, the pole approaches ω of infinity and the section approaches a k-type section.|$|E
500|$|The {{number of}} teeth, their size, {{and the gap}} between them are all design {{parameters}} {{that can be used}} to control the design of the filter. [...] As an example, a filter with a 3:1 stopband might have five teeth across the width of the waveguide. [...] The number of rows of teeth down the length of the waveguide primarily affects the stopband attenuation. [...] The more rows of teeth, the better the attenuation, each row being equivalent to a lumped element circuit <b>filter</b> <b>section.</b> [...] A filter with ten rows of teeth has a theoretical stopband rejection of around [...] and one with seven rows around [...]|$|E

5|$|The filters {{designed}} by Campbell were named wave filters {{because of their}} property of passing some waves and strongly rejecting others. The method by which they were designed was called the image parameter method and filters designed to this method are called image filters. The image method essentially consists of developing the transmission constants of an infinite chain of identical <b>filter</b> <b>sections</b> and then terminating the desired finite number of <b>filter</b> <b>sections</b> in the image impedance. This exactly corresponds {{to the way the}} properties of a finite length of transmission line are derived from the theoretical properties of an infinite line, the image impedance corresponding to the characteristic impedance of the line.|$|R
500|$|The {{smallest}} unit of {{an image}} filter is an L half-section. [...] Because the L section is not symmetrical, it has different image impedances (...) on each side. [...] These are denoted [...] and [...] [...] The T and the Π in the suffix refer {{to the shape of}} the <b>filter</b> <b>section</b> that would be formed if two half sections were to be connected back-to-back. [...] T and Π are the smallest symmetrical sections that can be constructed, as shown in diagrams in the topology chart (below). Where the section in question has an image impedance different from the general case a further suffix is added identifying the section type, for instance [...]|$|E
500|$|The image {{analysis}} {{starts with a}} calculation of the input and output impedances (the image impedances) and the transfer function of a section in an infinite chain of identical sections. This can {{be shown to be}} equivalent to the performance of a section terminated in its image impedances.Laplante, p.341. The image method, therefore, relies on each <b>filter</b> <b>section</b> being terminated with the correct image impedance. This is easy enough to do with the internal sections of a multiple section filter, because it is only necessary to ensure that the sections facing the one in question have identical image impedances. However, the end sections are a problem. They will usually be terminated with fixed resistances that the filter cannot match perfectly except at one specific frequency. This mismatch leads to multiple reflections at the filter terminations and at the junctions between sections. [...] These reflections result in the filter response deviating quite sharply from the theoretical, especially near the cut-off frequency.|$|E
500|$|... m-derived filters or m-type {{filters are}} {{a type of}} {{electronic}} filter designed using the image method. They were invented by Otto Zobel in the early 1920s. This filter type was originally intended for use with telephone multiplexing and was an improvement on the existing constant k type filter. The main problem being addressed was the need to achieve a better match of the filter into the terminating impedances. In general, all filters designed by the image method fail to give an exact match, but the m-type filter is a big improvement with suitable choice of the parameter m. The m-type <b>filter</b> <b>section</b> has a further advantage in {{that there is a}} rapid transition from the cut-off frequency of the pass band to a pole of attenuation just inside the stop band. Despite these advantages, there is a drawback with m-type filters; at frequencies past the pole of attenuation, the response starts to rise again, and m-types have poor stop band rejection. For this reason, filters designed using m-type sections are often designed as composite filters with a mixture of k-type and m-type sections and different values of m at different points to get the optimum performance from both types.|$|E

2500|$|The most {{significant}} effect {{that needs to}} be compensated for is that at some cut-off frequency the line response starts to roll-off like a simple low-pass filter.
