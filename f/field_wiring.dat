It recorded the tracks of charged particles curving in a 0.7 Tesla magnetic field, measuring their momentum, the sign of their electric charge and their rate of energy loss (dE/dx).

40|$|Loss {{mechanisms}} {{which come}} into play when solar cell modules are mounted in arrays are identified. Losses can occur either from {{a reduction in the}} array electrical performance or with nonoptimal extraction of power from the array. Electrical performance degradation is caused by electrical mismatch, transmission losses from cell surface soiling and steep angle of reflectance, and electrical losses from <b>field</b> <b>wiring</b> resistance and the voltage drop across blocking diodes. The second type of loss, concerned with the operating points of the array, can involve nonoptimal load impedance and limiting the operating envelope of the array to specific ranges of voltage and current. Each of the loss mechanisms are discussed and average energy losses expected from soiling, steep reflectance angles and circuit losses are calculated...|$|E
30|$|Analysis of fault {{data can}} reveal {{incorrect}} setup of power system equipment or incorrect <b>field</b> <b>wiring</b> that was missed during field commissioning tests. Results {{of the analysis}} {{can be used to}} take corrective action and avoid future misoperations. For example, this event shows that the CT at Station 2 was installed with an incorrect polarity. As a result, the direction of the current was reversed and can affect the reliability and performance of directional relays. Furthermore, the phase A current measurement at Station 1 was missing. It is possible that the phase CT has not been connected to the DFR and can result in loss of valuable information. The fault was observed to have encountered the least resistance path to the ground, which coincides with the root cause of the fault. Finally, Station 2 was learned to be electrically weaker than Station 1.|$|E
40|$|SummaryThe {{organization}} of {{primary visual cortex}} (V 1) into functional maps makes individual cells operate {{in a variety of}} contexts. For instance, some neurons lie in regions of fairly homogeneous orientation preference (iso-orientation domains), while others lie in regions with a variety of preferences (e. g., pinwheel centers). We asked whether this diversity in local map structure correlates with the degree of selectivity of spike responses. We used a combination of imaging and electrophysiology to reveal that neurons in regions of homogeneous orientation preference have much sharper tuning. Moreover, in both monkeys and cats, a common principle links the structure of the orientation map, on the spatial scale of dendritic integration, to the degree of selectivity of individual cells. We conclude that neural computation is not invariant across the cortical surface. This finding must factor into future theories of receptive <b>field</b> <b>wiring</b> and map development...|$|E

40|$|Introduction The central {{tracking}} detector of the KLOE experiment {{will be a}} large cylindrical drift chamber, 4 m {{in diameter}} and 3. 3 m in length, with almost square cells arranged in circular layers of alternate stereo angles. It has been fully described in the Addendum to the KLOE Technical Proposal [1]. Some prototypes of this large chamber were studied in the past. The first prototype (prototype 0) was a cylindrical chamber with 42 quasi hexagonal cells about 4 m long. Results are reported in [2]. In 1993 two small prototypes were tested at P. S. I. (Zurich). They had 25 cells instrumented out of 49. The almost square cells (2 x 2 cm 2) were realized with a different structure: 3 <b>field</b> <b>wires</b> for each sense wire in prototype 0. 1 (Rfs= 3 :l), 2 <b>field</b> <b>wires</b> for each sense wire in prototype 0. 2 (Rfs= 2 :l).

It consisted of seventeen layers of 11.3 mm × 10.0 mm cells with 42.5 mm between the layers, {{for a total}} of 5304 cells. There were two layers of <b>field</b> <b>wires</b> for every layer of sense wires. The odd-numbered layers were axial layers, and the even-numbered layers were alternating stereo layers.|$|R
40|$|The {{four main}} {{components}} of machinery management are monitoring, protection, machinery analysis and proactive machinery control. Themonitoring system implements {{the role of}} monitoring and protecting machinery. However due to its many different forms of communication to outside systems, it provides the data to the systems that can analyse the machinery responses and make decisions to assist the machinery management process. Various transducers translate the mechanical energy into electrical and then transmit them to the monitoring system over the <b>field</b> <b>wiring.</b> The monitoring system accepts the signal and processes it, calculating related quantities, such as the variables amplitude, phase. The monitoring systems also provide access points for the data signal to be provided to other devices. The proximity transducer system {{is used in the}} project to obtain the voltage signals and the probe calibration values are found both mathematically and through the use of calibration equipment. The various conditions that led to the use of proximity probes, including probe cable length(s), supply voltages, the types of target materials etc are identified. There are three different software packages which are to be used namely the Rack configuration software for the purpose of configuring the data collector modules. The mathematical model of the individual components are elaborated to analyse vibrations. The mathematical model is based on Finite Element Method. After simulating the dynamic behaviour of the rotor-bearing system with the normal operating conditions, it is possible to predict the stability range based on the variation in values of stiffness and damping coefficients. With the help of the SCILAB code all the direct and cross coupled stiffness and damping coefficients are calculated and their dependencies on the Sommerfeld number are observed using various plots...|$|E

It played a most important role in identifying a handful of Ws and Zs among billions of collisions. The detector was essentially a wire chamber - a 6 -chamber cylindrical assembly 5. 8 m long and 2. 3 m in diameter, the largest imaging drift chamber of its day.

50|$|Outside of {{the silicon}} {{detector}}, the central outer tracker works {{in much the}} manner as the silicon detector as it {{is also used to}} track the paths of charged particles and is also located within a magnetic field. The COT, however, is not made of silicon. Silicon is tremendously expensive and is not practical to purchase in extreme quantities. COT is a gas chamber filled {{with tens of thousands of}} gold wires arranged in layers and argon gas. Two types of wires are used in the COT: sense <b>wires</b> and <b>field</b> <b>wires.</b> Sense wires are thinner and attract the electrons that are released by the argon gas as it is ionized. The <b>field</b> <b>wires</b> are thicker than the sense wires and attract the positive ions formed from the release of electrons. There are 96 layers of wire and each wire is placed approximately 3.86 mm apart from one another. As in the silicon detector, when a charged particle passes through the chamber it ionizes the gas. This signal is then carried to a nearby wire, which is then carried to the computers for read-out. The COT is approximately 3.1 m long and extends from r = 40 cm to r = 137 cm. Although the COT is not nearly as precise as the silicon detector, the COT has a hit position resolution of 140 μm and a momentum resolution of 0.0015 (GeV/c)−1.|$|R
