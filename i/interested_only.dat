Seale writes that Abu Nidal's absence from Jordan during this period, when it was clear that King Hussein was about to act against the Palestinians, raised suspicion within the movement that Abu Nidal was <b>interested</b> <b>only</b> in saving himself.|$|E
5|$|For many at the indaba, {{the most}} {{pressing}} motivator was Matabeleland's security. While Lobengula considered the Transvaalers more formidable battlefield adversaries than the British, he understood that Britain was more prominent on the world stage, and while the Boers wanted land, Rudd's party claimed to be <b>interested</b> <b>only</b> in mining and trading. Lobengula reasoned that if he accepted Rudd's proposals, he would keep his land, and the British would be obliged {{to protect him from}} incursions by the Boers.|$|E

5|$|The book's {{criticism}} of Eddy is considerable. She {{is portrayed as}} greedy, uneducated and deceitful, someone who regularly revised her life story and was <b>interested</b> <b>only</b> in making money. The authors produce witness statements from Eddy's childhood alleging that she engaged in repeated fainting spells to gain attention or avoid punishment, particularly from her father, and that, as an adult, she developed a habit of appearing to be seriously ill only to recover quickly.|$|E
5|$|The {{tour was}} dogged by {{financial}} controversy with the Australians accused by the British press of being <b>interested</b> <b>only</b> in money. The allegations were refuted by the Australian press but it later became clear, when an England team arrived in Australia the following winter, {{that there had}} been a financial dispute between Alexander and the English team manager James Lillywhite, resulting in the two teams at first boycotting each other. The dispute was never evident while Murdoch's team was in England as they completed all their scheduled fixtures, winning eighteen matches and losing seven with seven drawn.|$|E
5|$|In 1896 Henry Morrison Flagler {{brought the}} Florida East Coast Railway to Miami. Mary Ann and William Davis {{had dreamed of}} {{building}} a city on Key Biscayne. Now their son Waters was a retired millionaire, and <b>interested</b> <b>only</b> in preserving Key Biscayne as a quiet retreat for his family. For a while Flagler's arrival did disturb their quiet, as Flagler brought in dredges to deepen the Cape Florida Channel and the approaches {{to the mouth of}} the Miami River, muddying the formerly clear waters of Biscayne Bay. Soon, however, a shorter route from the ocean to Miami was dredged through the southern end of what is now Miami Beach, at Government Cut, and the Cape Florida Channel was allowed to return to a natural state.|$|E

5|$|Meyerbeer's immense wealth (increased by {{the success}} of his operas) and his {{continuing}} adherence to his Jewish religion set him apart somewhat from many of his musical contemporaries. They also gave rise to rumours that his success was due to his bribing musical critics. Richard Wagner (see below) accused him of being <b>interested</b> <b>only</b> in money, not music. Meyerbeer was, however, a deeply serious musician and a sensitive personality. He philosophically resigned himself to being a victim of his own success: his extensive diaries and correspondence – which survived the turmoil of 20th-century Europe and have now been published in eight volumes – are an invaluable source for the history of music and theatre in the composer's time.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of a von Neumann computer depended {{on the availability of}} a suitable memory device on which to store the program. During the Second World War researchers working on the problem of removing the clutter from radar signals had developed a form of delay line memory, the first practical application of which was the mercury delay line, developed by J. Presper Eckert. Radar transmitters send out regular brief pulses of radio energy, the reflections from which are displayed on a CRT screen. As operators are usually <b>interested</b> <b>only</b> in moving targets, it was desirable to filter out any distracting reflections from stationary objects. The filtering was achieved by comparing each received pulse with the previous pulse, and rejecting both if they were identical, leaving a signal containing only the images of any moving objects. To store each received pulse for later comparison it was passed through a transmission line, delaying it by exactly the time between transmitted pulses.|$|E
5|$|The sailor {{offers to}} pay a reward, but Dupin is <b>interested</b> <b>only</b> in {{learning}} the circumstances behind the two murders. The sailor explains that he captured the orangutan while in Borneo and brought it back to Paris, but had trouble keeping it under control. When he saw the orangutan attempting to shave its face with his straight razor, imitating his morning grooming, it fled into the streets and reached the Rue Morgue, where it climbed up and into the house. The orangutan seized the mother by the hair and was waving the razor, imitating a barber; when she screamed in fear, it flew into a rage, ripped her hair out, slashed her throat, and strangled the daughter. The sailor climbed up the lightning rod {{in an attempt to}} catch the animal, and the two voices heard by witnesses belonged to it and to him. Fearing punishment by its master, the orangutan threw the mother's body out the window and stuffed the daughter into the chimney before fleeing.|$|E

5|$|When Britten {{was three}} months old he {{contracted}} pneumonia and nearly died. The illness {{left him with a}} damaged heart, and doctors warned his parents that he would probably never be able to lead a normal life. He recovered more fully than expected, and as a boy was a keen tennis player and cricketer. To his mother's great delight he was an outstandingly musical child, unlike his sisters, who inherited their father's indifference to music, while his brother, though musically talented, was <b>interested</b> <b>only</b> in ragtime. Edith gave the young Britten his first lessons in piano and notation. He made his first attempts at composition when he was five. He started piano lessons when he was seven years old, and three years later began to play the viola. He {{was one of the last}} composers brought up on exclusively live music: his father refused to have a gramophone or, later, a radio in the house.|$|E

25|$|A {{polynomial}} equation {{for which}} one is <b>interested</b> <b>only</b> in the solutions which are integers is called a Diophantine equation. Solving Diophantine equations is generally a very hard task. It has been proved that there cannot be any general algorithm for solving them, and even for deciding whether the set of solutions is empty (see Hilbert's tenth problem). Some {{of the most famous}} problems that have been solved during the fifty last years are related to Diophantine equations, such as Fermat's Last Theorem.|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{the late}} 19th century, the British East India Company was <b>interested</b> <b>only</b> in trading, and tried as much as {{possible}} to steer clear of Malay politics. However, Siam's influence in the northern Malay states, especially Kedah, Terengganu, Kelantan and Pattani, was preventing the Company from trading in peace. Therefore, in 1826, the British, through the Company, signed a secret treaty known today as the Burney Treaty with the King of Siam. The four Malay states were not present during the signing of the agreement. In that treaty, British acknowledged Siamese sovereignty over all those states. In return, Siam accepted British ownership of Penang and Province Wellesley and allowed the Company to trade in Terengganu and Kelantan unimpeded.|$|E
25|$|Matthew's idea {{on society}} were radical for their times. Although {{he was a}} landowner, he was {{involved}} with the Chartist movement, and argued that institutions of hereditary nobility were detrimental to society. It {{has been suggested that}} these views worked against acceptance of his theory of natural selection, being politically incorrect at the time (see Barker, 2001). The more likely reason is that the obscurity of the location hid the ideas from many who would have been <b>interested.</b> <b>Only</b> after Darwin's Origin did Matthew come forward in a popular journal, the Gardeners' Chronicle. Matthew also published a book in 1839, Emigration Fields (Black, Edinburgh), suggesting that overpopulation, as predicted by Malthus, could be solved by mass migration to North America and the Dominions.|$|E

25|$|There {{were other}} {{problems}} that a pope {{would have to}} face. Queen Elizabeth of England had been excommunicated by Pius V, and she had obtained possession of Mary, Queen of Scots. Mary's relatives, the Guises, were {{the leaders of the}} devout hyper-Catholic party in France, who were eager for a show-down with the Huguenots. Catherine de Medicis was attempting to avoid a civil war in France, and she believed that the marriage of her daughter Margot with Henri of Navarre, a Protestant, might avert disaster but dispensations would be required of the pope. She was also trying to tempt Queen Elizabeth into marriage with her son, Henri, and that would require papal cooperation as well. Her choices were the Cardinal of Ferrara, Ippolito d'Este, who was as disliked in 1572 as he had been in 1549. His collection of enemies had grown to include Cardinals Bonelli, Borromeo, Farnese, Medici, and Morone. Catherine, however, was in contact with her cousin, Cosimo I, Grand Duke of Tuscany, who, behind the scenes, was promoting Cardinal Boncompagni. Cardinal de' Medici was to inform the leaders of the Faction of Pius IV, Borromeo and Altemps, that the Medici were <b>interested</b> <b>only</b> in Sirleto and Boncompagni. With the French and Florentine votes, in fact, Cardinal d'Este had the resources to block any candidate he pleased (the 'virtual veto').|$|E
25|$|The hegemon (ἡγεμών) of {{the court}} was {{responsible}} for the registration of the suits and complaints. After holding a preliminary investigation, he also had to subpoena the litigant parties and the witnesses before the jury. In the morning of the day of hearings, the hegemon had to determine by lot the jury that would judge the case as well as the place where it would convene. After the formation of the jury, the hegemon had to submit the conclusions of his preliminary investigation, announcing and defining the litigation on which the court should decide. Then it was the time for the plaintiff, the defendant and the witnesses to be heard. The arguments were exposed by the litigants themselves, without the legal support of a lawyer, {{in the form of an}} exchange of single speeches timed by water clock. In a public suit each litigant had three hours to speak, whereas they had much less in private suits (though here it was in proportion to the amount of money at stake). In this way the judicial cases became a vehement fight of impressions, since the jurors did not constitute a little group of mature citizens, such as the Court of Areios Pagos, which was <b>interested</b> <b>only</b> in the correct application of the law. Additionally, before the Chambers of Heliaia each citizen had to become an effective orator and to act solely in his capacity as citizen, in order to protect his interests and to enforce his views.|$|E
500|$|The Ring production, filmed for {{television}} in 1980, initially provoked controversy, but was celebrated after its final performance in 1980 with a 45-minute standing ovation. Chéreau disliked grand opera, but said: [...] "After Bayreuth, I {{felt the need}} to work on a theatrical project of some breadth... I have never put on little things. I am <b>interested</b> <b>only</b> in spectacles that rise above themselves". He first considered Goethe's Faust but then directed in 1981 Henrik Ibsen's Peer Gynt for Villeurbane and Paris, aiming at [...] "an incandescence of theatrical experience, a global spectacle".|$|E

25|$|A {{cash flow}} ARM is a minimum payment option {{mortgage}} loan. This {{type of loan}} allows a borrower to choose their monthly payment from several options. These payment options usually include the option to pay at the 30-year level, 15-year level, <b>interest</b> <b>only</b> level, and a minimum payment level. The minimum payment level is usually lower than the <b>interest</b> <b>only</b> payment. This type of loan can result in negative amortization. The option to make a minimum payment is usually available only for the first several years of the loan.|$|R
50|$|Significantly, {{endowment}} mortgages {{continued to}} grow in the 1980s even after Life Assurance Premium Relief had been abolished (1984). Moreover, their share of the mortgage market held up in the 1990s {{despite the fact that the}} Treasury began to steadily reduce MIRAS (Mortgage interest relief at source), which also worked in favour of <b>interest</b> <b>only</b> mortgages, and despite a prolonged period of relatively low inflation (something which worked against <b>interest</b> <b>only</b> mortgages). The fact that endowment mortgages were later found to have been systematically mis-sold probably explains this disjunction.|$|R
