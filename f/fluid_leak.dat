5|$|A {{spontaneous}} cerebrospinal <b>fluid</b> <b>leak</b> is one {{of several}} types of cerebrospinal fluid leaks and occurs due to the presence of one or more holes in the dura. A spontaneous CSF leak, as opposed to traumatically caused CSF leaks, arises idiopathically. A loss of CSF greater than its rate of production leads to a decreased volume inside the skull known as intracranial hypotension. Any CSF leak is most often characterized by orthostatic headaches — headaches that worsen in a vertical position and improve when lying down. Other symptoms can include neck pain or stiffness, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, fatigue, and a metallic taste in the mouth (indicative of a cranial leak). A CT scan can identify the site of a cerebrospinal fluid leakage. Once identified, the leak can often be repaired by an epidural blood patch, an injection of the patient's own blood {{at the site of the}} leak, a fibrin glue injection or surgery. When the cause cannot be identified the set of symptoms is referred to as spontaneous cerebrospinal <b>fluid</b> <b>leak</b> syndrome (SCSFLS).|$|E
5|$|Diagnosis of a {{cerebrospinal}} <b>fluid</b> <b>leak</b> {{is performed}} {{through a combination}} of measurement of the CSF pressure and a computed tomography myelogram (CTM) scan of the spinal column for fluid leaks. The opening fluid pressure in the spinal canal is obtained by performing a lumbar puncture, also known as a spinal tap. Once the pressure is measured, a radiocontrast agent is injected into the spinal fluid. The contrast then diffuses out through the dura sac before leaking through dural holes. This allows for a CTM with fluoroscopy to locate and image any sites of dura rupture via contrast seen outside the dura sac in the imagery.|$|E
5|$|The {{prototype}} aircraft, registered N767BA {{and equipped}} with JT9D turbofans, rolled out on August 4, 1981. By this time, the 767 program had accumulated 173 firm orders from 17 customers, including Air Canada, All Nippon Airways, Britannia Airways, Transbrasil, and Trans World Airlines (TWA). On September 26, 1981, the prototype took its maiden flight {{under the command}} of company test pilots Tommy Edmonds, Lew Wallick, and John Brit. The maiden flight was largely uneventful, save for the inability to retract the landing gear because of a hydraulic <b>fluid</b> <b>leak.</b> The prototype was used for subsequent flight tests.|$|E

25|$|At the restart, Hill and Schumacher again {{held their}} positions, whilst Coulthard led the more circumspect Ferraris through Sainte Dévote, with Alesi jumping ahead of Berger. On this {{occasion}} {{there were no}} major incidents, although Katayama sustained light damage to his car's front wing {{as a result of}} a brush with Morbidelli. As the drivers completed the first lap, Hill led by 0.5seconds from Schumacher, who was followed in turn by Coulthard, Alesi, Berger, Herbert, Häkkinen, Irvine, Brundle, Barrichello, Blundell, Panis, Frentzen, Badoer, Morbidelli, Katayama, Martini, Boullion, Gachot, Moreno, Montermini, Salo, Diniz and Inoue. In the early laps, Hill gradually built a lead of nearly twoseconds over Schumacher by lap10, with the two pulling away in tandem from Coulthard, who was at this point a further eightseconds behind the Benetton. By this stage there had already been two retirements: Häkkinen's Mercedes engine failed due to a fuel pump drive problem on the ninthlap of the race, and Moreno spun at Sainte Dévote when a brake <b>fluid</b> <b>leak</b> caused him to lose control of his Forti a lap later. Morbidelli also made an early unscheduled stop to cure a serious tyre vibration caused by a section of tie-rope from a tyre-warming blanket becoming jammed in one of his rear wheels, the Footwork driver dropping to the tail of the field in the process.|$|E
25|$|Kvyat was {{the fastest}} driver not to advance {{into the final}} {{qualifying}} session; his fastest time of one minute and 26.070 seconds was {{one and a half}} seconds off Hamilton's pace in the second session. However, he received a ten-place grid penalty for changing his engine overnight, his sixth of the season. As a result, Räikkonen moved into eleventh. Räikkonen struggled with car grip and locked his front tyres, abandoning his first timed lap because cars leaving the pit lane hindered his visibility entering the Rettifilo chicane, and after preparing for his second attempt, he locked his right-front wheel and ran into the run-off area. Jean-Éric Vergne started from 12th with Hülkenberg unable to match his teammate's pace in 13th because he was delayed by slower traffic while preparing his for his lap at Parabolica and felt his car was loose. Sutil had problems driving but gradually improved his car's balance as he circulated the track and improved on his final lap to secure 14th, ahead of teammate Esteban Gutiérrez who made a slight error on his final lap. Maldonado failed to advance beyond the first qualifying session, with teammate Grosjean managing five laps after missing the opening 13 minutes while his team repaired a <b>fluid</b> <b>leak</b> discovered before qualifying. Kobayashi slipstreamed teammate Marcus Ericsson to move ahead of Jules Bianchi for 18th, with Bianchi not improving as he slid sideways through the Ascari chicane and other drivers set faster lap times on the medium compound tyres. His teammate Max Chilton qualified 20th and Ericsson completed the field in 22nd; the latter was hindered {{due to a lack of}} decent running on the medium compound tyres following an engine problem in the third practice session.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} whether the measurement of beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) levels in vaginal fluid is useful for the diagnosis of premature rupture of membranes (PROM). Material and Methods: A total of 92 pregnant women between 24 and 40 weeks gestation participated in this study. The patients with <b>fluid</b> <b>leaking</b> from the vagina were designated Group 1, the patients with no <b>fluid</b> <b>leaking</b> from the vagina were Group 2, and those with a suspicion of <b>fluid</b> <b>leaking</b> from the vagina were classified as Group 3. Irrigating the posterior vaginal fornix with 5 mL sterile saline {{was used to measure}} β-hCG levels of the patients. Receiver operator curve (ROC) analysis was used to determine the cut-off value for a positive diagnosis. Results: The β-hCG levels of vaginal fluid were measured as 20. 5 ± 25. 0 mIU/mL, 254. 6 ± 346. 8 mIU/mL, and 74. 3 ± 100. 8 mIU/m...|$|R
40|$|Most {{pipelines}} in petrochemical industries, {{oil refineries}} and power plants operate at high temperatures and pressures. Leaks can develop in such pipes when a pressurized fluid is confined at high temperatures.

500|$|A {{spontaneous}} cerebrospinal <b>fluid</b> <b>leak</b> (SCSFL) is {{a medical}} condition in which the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) held {{in and around the}} human brain and spinal cord leaks out of the surrounding protective [...] dural sac, for no apparent reason. The dura, a tough, inflexible tissue, is the outermost of the three layers of the meninges, the system of membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord.|$|E
500|$|CSF can leak {{from the}} dura {{as a result}} of {{different}} causes such as physical trauma or a lumbar puncture, or from no known cause when it is termed spontaneous cerebrospinal <b>fluid</b> <b>leak.</b> It is usually associated with intracranial hypotension: low CSF pressure. It can cause headaches, made worse by standing, moving and coughing, as the low CSF pressure causes the brain to [...] "sag" [...] downwards and put pressure on its lower structures. If a leak is identified, a beta-2 transferrin test of the leaking fluid, when positive, is highly specific and sensitive for the detection for CSF leakage. Medical imaging such as CT scans and MRI scans can be used to investigate for a presumed CSF leak when no obvious leak is found but low CSF pressure is identified. Caffeine, given either orally or intravenously, often offers symptomatic relief. Treatment of an identified leak may include injection of a person's blood into the epidural space (an epidural blood patch), spinal surgery, or fibrin glue.|$|E

50|$|The {{most common}} cause of orthostatic {{headache}} is low cerebrospinal fluid pressure, due to a spontaneous cerebrospinal <b>fluid</b> <b>leak,</b> a traumatic cerebrospinal <b>fluid</b> <b>leak,</b> or a post-dural-puncture leak. It is also occasionally the most prominent symptom of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). Distinguishing POTS from a cerebrospinal <b>fluid</b> <b>leak</b> can be difficult, because the defining symptom of POTS, positional tachycardia, also occurs in some people with cerebrospinal fluid leaks. Furthermore, both POTS and cerebrospinal fluid leaks are sometimes present in the same person, especially in people with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.|$|E
