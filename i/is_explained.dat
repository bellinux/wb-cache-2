5|$|All {{actinides}} are pyrophoric, {{especially when}} finely divided, that is, they spontaneously ignite upon reaction with air. The melting point of actinides {{does not have}} a clear dependence on the number of f-electrons. The unusually low melting point of neptunium and plutonium (~640°C) <b>is</b> <b>explained</b> by hybridization of 5f and 6d orbitals and the formation of directional bonds in these metals.|$|E
5|$|Autism has {{a strong}} genetic basis, {{although}} the genetics of autism are complex and {{it is unclear whether}} ASD <b>is</b> <b>explained</b> more by rare mutations with major effects, or by rare multigene interactions of common genetic variants. Complexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes, the environment, and epigenetic factors which do not change DNA sequencing but are heritable and influence gene expression. Many genes have been associated with autism through sequencing the genomes of affected individuals and their parents.|$|E

5|$|Chemically, {{actinium}} {{is similar}} to lanthanum, which <b>is</b> <b>explained</b> by their similar ionic radii and electronic structure. Like lanthanum, actinium has oxidation of +3, but it is less reactive and has more pronounced basic properties. Among other trivalent actinides Ac3+ is least acidic, i.e. has the weakest tendency to hydrolyze in aqueous solutions.|$|E
5|$|Expedition to the Barrier Peaks {{takes place}} on a {{spaceship}} in the Barrier Peaks mountain range of the World of Greyhawk campaign setting.

5|$|Like the lanthanides, all {{actinides}} {{are highly}} reactive with halogens and chalcogens; however, the actinides react more easily. Actinides, {{especially those with}} {{a small number of}} 5f-electrons, are prone to hybridization. This <b>is</b> <b>explained</b> by the similarity of the electron energies at the 5f, 7s and 6d shells. Most actinides exhibit a larger variety of valence states, and the most stable are +6 for uranium, +5 for protactinium and neptunium, +4 for thorium and plutonium and +3 for actinium and other actinides.|$|E
5|$|Millennium Group member Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) is {{contacted}} {{for help}} in finding Zero, and travels to a briefing on the situation. It <b>is</b> <b>explained</b> that Zero is carrying a disease ordinarily confined to the Congo. Meanwhile, Zero and Knox are attempting to have a local newspaper run Zero's story, believing he has been infected in a racially motivated conspiracy akin to the Tuskegee syphilis experiment. Police locate and apprehend Zero, who manages to smear blood on Black's shirt.|$|E
5|$|Solid xenon {{changes from}} face-centered cubic (fcc) to {{hexagonal}} close packed (hcp) crystal phase under pressure and begins to turn metallic at about 140GPa, with no noticeable volume change in the hcp phase. It is completely metallic at 155GPa. When metallized, xenon appears sky blue because it absorbs red light and transmits other visible frequencies. Such behavior is unusual for a metal and <b>is</b> <b>explained</b> by the relatively small width of the electron bands in that state.|$|E

40|$|The regiochemistru of {{the attack}} of a carbnyl group on furan, 2, 3 -dihydrofuran, 2 -methylfuran, and 2 -furylmethanol <b>was</b> <b>explained</b> {{assuming}} a frontier orbitals control of the reaction. The prefential formation of the endo adduct in the reaction between 2, 3 -dihydrofuran and benzaldehyde and the preferential formation of the exo imoer in the reaction between furan and benzaldehyde <b>were</b> <b>explained</b> considering the relative stability of the adducts. In the case of 2 -methylfuran, the reaction with benzaldehyde gave the product deriving from {{the attack on the}} less hindered side of the molecule. The regiochemistry <b>was</b> <b>explained</b> considering the relative stability of the possilbe biradical intermediates. The exo stereoselectivity <b>was</b> <b>explained</b> {{on the basis of the}} stability of the adducts. 2 -Furylmethanol gave a mixture of regioisomeric products where the most abundant one was that deriving from the attck on the most hindered side pf the molecule.

5|$|Cheddar is {{recognised}} as a village. The adjacent {{settlement of}} Axbridge, although {{only about a}} third the population of Cheddar, is a town. This apparently illogical situation <b>is</b> <b>explained</b> by the relative importance of the two places in historic times. While Axbridge grew in importance as a centre for cloth manufacturing in the Tudor period and gained a charter from King John, Cheddar remained a more dispersed mining and dairy-farming village. Its population grew {{with the arrival of the}} railways in the Victorian era and the advent of tourism.|$|E
5|$|Cooperativity is {{observed}} when two synapses are activated by weak stimuli incapable of inducing LTP when stimulated individually. But upon simultaneous weak stimulation, both synapses undergo LTP in a cooperative fashion. Synaptic tagging {{does not explain}} how multiple weak stimuli can result in a collective stimulus sufficient to induce LTP (this <b>is</b> <b>explained</b> by the postsynaptic summation of EPSPs described previously). Rather, synaptic tagging explains the ability of weakly stimulated synapses, none of which are capable of independently generating LTP, to receive the products of protein synthesis initiated collectively. As before, this may be accomplished through the synthesis of a local synaptic tag following weak synaptic stimulation.|$|E
5|$|Estimates of the {{heritability}} {{of schizophrenia}} is around 80%, which implies that 80% {{of the individual}} differences in risk to schizophrenia <b>is</b> <b>explained</b> by individual differences in genetics. These estimates vary {{because of the difficulty}} in separating genetic and environmental influences. The greatest single risk factor for developing schizophrenia is having a first-degree relative with the disease (risk is 6.5%); more than 40% of monozygotic twins of those with schizophrenia are also affected. If one parent is affected the risk is about 13% and if both are affected the risk is nearly 50%.|$|E

5|$|In the 2012 film , the Pyramid Head, {{once more}} portrayed by Roberto Campanella, {{is both a}} monster and a guardian. More than once, it saves Sharon from the forces of Silent Hill.

Pyramid Head is also seen {{controlling}} the carousel where Heather and Alessa face off against each other, then it kills the cult leader Claudia Wolf after the amulet shows her inner, monstrous nature.|$|E
