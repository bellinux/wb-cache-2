40|$|Urinary gonadotrophins were assayed {{in terms}} of the {{reference}} substance HMG 20 A by methods believed to measure follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) directly and <b>interstitial</b> <b>cell</b> <b>stimulating</b> <b>hormone</b> (ICSH) indirectly. In normal girls aged 10 - 11 and 14 - 15 years urinary FSH was equivalent to 26 and 14 mg HMG 20 A/ 1. Gonadotrophin from the older girls was qualitatively similar to HMG 20 A, but that from the younger girls contained relatively little ICSH. Relative deficiency of ICSH also occur-red in some older girls with delayed puberty. Young girls with precocious isosexual develop-ment resembled older girls of the 14 - to 15 -year group by excreting gonadotrophins qualitatively like HMG 20 A but in smaller amounts. In normal boys the maximum urinary FSH was only 8 =. mg/l., P: and {{there was no evidence of}} relatively low concentrations of ICSH before normal pubertynor when it was abnormally delayed. The physiological and statistical significance of the demonstrated qualitative differences in urinary gonadotrophins is discussed.

40|$|SINCE the {{discovery}} of the gonado-trophic hormones, it has been sug-gested that the comparable component parts of the gonads of the two sexes were stimulated by the same factor. Thus in the female, the follicle stimulating hor-mone (FSH) was believed to stimulate the maturation of the ovum and in the male to stimulate spermatogenesis in the testis tubules. The term gametogenic hormone has been suggested in recognition of this common function in the two sexes. The second gonadotrophic factor called the luteinizing hormone (LH) in the female because it stimulated the growth of the corpus luteum and the <b>interstitial</b> <b>cell</b> <b>stimulating</b> <b>hormone</b> (ICSH) in the male influenced the growth and functional activity of the cells of Leydig. In a study of hypophysectomized cockerels, Nalbandov el al., (1946) de-termined the effect of relatively pure FSH and LH (or ICSH) upon the testes and the secretion of male hormone. Pure FSH produced significant increases in tubule diameter while LH had lesser effects in this respect. Pure FSH, however, did not cause the enlargement of the comb, indicating that it does not stimu-late the secretion of androgen. Pure L...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Rats with adjuvant-induced {{arthritis}} (AA) {{have low}} levels of serum testosterone, and production of testosterone reportedly is influenced by macrophage secretory products. This study was undertaken to understand the mechanism mediating this hypoandrogenism. Testicular macrophages from AA and nonarthritic (NA) rats were cultured, and conditioned media was added to testicular <b>interstitial</b> <b>cells</b> and Percollpurified cells from NA rats. Testosterone production by <b>interstitial</b> <b>cells</b> <b>stimulated</b> with luteinizing <b>hormone</b> (LH) and incubated with adjuvantinduced arthritic macrophage conditioned medium (AAMCM) was significantly lower than in cells incubated with nonarthritic macrophage conditioned medium (NAMCM). However, {{there was no difference}} in testosterone production by Percoll-purified Leydig <b>cells</b> and those <b>stimulated</b> with LH when incubated with AAMCM or NAMCM. To determine whether an intermediary cell type was involved in mediating inhibition of testosterone production, AAMCM and NAMCM were added to a reconstituted preparation of testicular <b>interstitial</b> <b>cells.</b> Addition of AAMCM restored the inhibitory effect, suggesting that arthritic hypoandrogenism is mediated by cell-cell interaction. These results suggest that a factor produced by macrophages from AA rats appears to mediate testosterone production by acting in conjunction with other cells in the testicular interstitium...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1970 There is an {{increasing}} body of evidence that the pineal gland acts as a neuroendocrine transducer, translating neural information about environmental lighting condition into hormonal information. In the rat, light controls the production of melatonin which acts via the hypothalamic-hypophyseal pathway to control {{the function of the}} gonads, A similar mechanism seems to operate in other laboratory animals. The effect of photoperiod on the onset of the breeding season in large animals such as sheep has been studied, but the mechanism by which light affects their reproduction has not been elucidated. To test the hypothesis that the mechanism by which light controls reproduction in sheep is similar to the mechanism that operates in rats, an experiment was conducted {{to determine the effects of}} melatonin on reproductive phenomena in sheep. A solid-phase radioimmunoassay was developed as a means of studying the effects of melatonin on serum <b>interstitial</b> <b>cell</b> <b>stimulating</b> <b>hormone</b> (ICSH). Twenty-eight ewe, ram and wether lambs were divided into a control and a treatment group. Treatment consisted of daily sub-cutaneous injections of 0. 1 mg. melatonin per kilogram of body weight administered in propylene glycol. Treatment was initiated on the third day after birth and continued until autopsy just before the suspected onset of puberty. Melatonin in the doses employed caused a significant increase (P <. 05) in ovarian weight in ewe lambs and a depression (P <. 10) in castration-hypersecretion of ICSH in wether lambs. No other significant effects were observed. The role of melatonin in controlling reproductive phenomena in sheep is still not clear. The known effects of melatonin in rats could not be duplicated in sheep. It appears that the mechanism by which light controls reproduction in sheep is not similar to that which operates in rats. The solid phase radioimmunoassay developed for this experiment proved to be a rapid, sensitive and highly reliable technique for the determination of serum ICSH...|$|E

40|$|Summary. Oestrogen-priming of the {{hypophysectomized}} immature female rat promotes preantral follicle {{development in}} the absence of endogenous gonado-trophins and such an animal is useful for study of the intraovarian glyco-protein=n- interactions which underlie morphological and functional development of the ovarian follicle. The present report identifies in vitro the functional characteristics (gonadotrophin binding and steroidogenesis) of granulosa cells harvested at different stages of follicular maturity following treatment with exogenous hormones in vivo. Preovulatory follicle maturation, induced by FSH, has been studied up until antrum formation and the acquisition by granulosa cells of the ability to respond directly to LH or hCG. Before the increases in available granulosa cell membrane LH/hCG receptors associated with the formation of follicular antra, effects of hCG or other <b>hormones</b> with <b>interstitial</b> <b>cell</b> <b>stimulating</b> activity are mediated via interactions with cells outside the lamina basalis. In-vivo studies with oestrogen-primed hypophysectomized immature rats indicate that androgens secreted by LH/hCG-stimulated thecal and/or <b>interstitial</b> <b>cells</b> may act directly on the preantral follicle to promote atresia. However, in-vitro studies have shown a stimulatory effect of androgen on FSH-responsive progesterone secretion by granulosa cells isolated from preantral follicles. These effects, if shown to operate within the ovary during the normal cycle, need not be mutually exclusive because FSH stimulation of granulosa cells in vivo may be a major determinant of follicular responses to androgen. The increase in follicle size and antrum formation accompanying FSH treatment in vivo are associated with (i) increases in the steroidogenic potential of isolated granulosa cells; (ii) the induction of granulosa cell LH/hCG receptors and of steroidogenic responsivity to hCG; and (iii) stimulation of granulosa cell aromatase activity. These observations highlight the critical role of FSH in the organization of preovulatory follicular morphology and function...|$|R

40|$|The {{targeting}} of liposomes to cells and {{the delivery of}} the liposomal contents into the cells have been investigated using either Î±-melanocyte <b>stimulating</b> <b>hormone</b> or Ricin-B-chain as ligands for promoting the binding of liposomes to <b>cells.</b> Î±-melanocyte <b>stimulating</b> <b>hormone</b> has been conjugated to liposomes and to Ricin-A-chain via the Lysââ residue without significant loss of biological activity. The resulting conjugates were found to bind to Bl 6 melanoma cells which express receptors for the hormone. Hormone targeted ricin was shown to be toxic to the cells, indicating receptor mediated internalisation of the conjugate. The hormone targeted liposomes however were unable to mediate the delivery of cytotoxic levels of methotrexate. Ricin-B-chain, a lectin which mediates membrane translocation of the toxic ricin-A-chain, was examined for its applicability for {{targeting of}} liposomes to cells. This lectin was shown to promote the binding of liposomes to cells and to mediate the delivery of cytotoxic concentrations of methotrexate. Further evidence of functional ricin-B-chain mediated intracellular delivery of the liposomal contents was shown by liposome mediated transformation of cells, and delivery of nuclease into the cell resultin in digestion of genomic DNA. The study demonstrates that Î±-melanocyte <b>stimulating</b> <b>hormone</b> is unsuitable as a ligand by which to achieve delivery of large quantities of material into cells, although cell-specific targeting can be achieved. Ricin-B-chain is however ideally suited for this task, though is less cell-specific.

In hormone-stimulated NIH 3 T 3 and Cos cells ectopically expressing human estrogen receptor alpha (hERalpha), aPKC is activated by phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 -kinase) and, in turn, controls the Ras/MEK- 1 /ERK cascade.

PKCzeta activation leads to recruitment of Ras to a multimolecular complex that also includes hERalpha, Src, PI 3 -kinase, and aPKC. We propose that PKCzeta pushes Ras and the signaling complex close together {{in such a way}} that it facilitates the Src-dependent Ras activation.

40|$|International audienceIn melanocytes and {{melanoma}} <b>cells</b> alpha-melanocyte <b>stimulating</b> <b>hormone</b> (alpha-MSH), via the cAMP pathway, elicits a large {{array of}} biological responses that control melanocyte differentiation and influence melanoma development or susceptibility. In this work, {{we show that}} cAMP transcriptionally activates Hif 1 a gene in a melanocyte cell-specific manner and increases {{the expression of a}} functional hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF 1 alpha) protein resulting in a stimulation of Vegf expression. Interestingly, we report that the melanocyte-specific transcription factor, microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), binds to the Hif 1 a promoter and strongly stimulates its transcriptional activity. Further, MITF "silencing" abrogates the cAMP effect on Hif 1 a expression, and overexpression of MITF in human melanoma cells is sufficient to stimulate HIF 1 A mRNA. Our data demonstrate that Hif 1 a is a new MITF target gene and that MITF mediates the cAMP stimulation of Hif 1 a in melanocytes and melanoma cells. Importantly, we provide results demonstrating that HIF 1 plays a pro-survival role in this cell system. We therefore conclude that the alpha-MSH/cAMP pathway, using MITF as a signal transducer and HIF 1 alpha as a target, might contribute to melanoma progression...|$|R

In this paper we show that rac 1 induces the formation of dendrite-like structures when activated mutants are transiently expressed in B 16 F 1 murine melanoma cells and in four human melanoma cell lines. Activated mutants of cdc 42 and rhoA induced the formation of filopodia and stress fibers, respectively, in B 16 F 1 cells, but not dendrites.

We examined whether HMVECs derived from aging individuals (66 years and 90 years old), 66 -HMVECs and 90 -HMVECs have reduced ghrelin levels vs. neonatal (Neo) HMVECs and whether treatment with exogenous ghrelin can restore impaired in vitro angiogenesis on matrigel in aged HMVECs. Ghrelin levels were reduced in the aged HMVECs by 3. 2 -fold (p< 0. 05) compared to Neo-HMVECs.

RESULTS: Eps 8 is specifically expressed in gonocytes, Leydig and Sertoli cells of the neonatal rats and in Leydig and Sertoli cells of the adult rats and mice. Although gonocytes express Eps 8, no signal was found in prepubertal or mature spermatogonia and the expression level of Eps 8 in Sertoli cells increases with age.

No complications occurred from electrocautery with or without clomiphene citrate. Patients allocated to electrocautery had a significantly lower risk of multiple pregnancy (0. 11, 0. 01 to 0. 86). Conclusion The ongoing pregnancy rate from ovulation induction with laparoscopic electrocautery followed by clomiphene citrate and recombinant follicle <b>stimulating</b> <b>hormone</b> if anovulation persisted, or recombinant follicle <b>stimulating</b> <b>hormone,</b> seems equivalent to ovulation induction with recombinant follicle <b>stimulating</b> <b>hormone,</b> but the former procedure carries a lower risk of multiple pregnanc...|$|R
40|$|Bats are {{the most}} diverse and {{successful}} group of mammals exhibiting many adaptive specializations. Chiroptera shows great variations in the reproductive stage, even the closely allied species exhibit different breeding habits. It is important to study the reproductive organ that is ovary in respect with the <b>interstitial</b> <b>cells,</b> because the <b>interstitial</b> <b>cells</b> {{with the help of}} LH of pituitary produce a hormone androgen. That means interstitial tissues are developed as a gland having steroidogenic activity. The immature ovary of Megaderma lyra lyra showed the small bundles of few <b>interstitial</b> <b>cells</b> in stromal region. In inactive ovary of Megaderma lyra lyra, <b>interstitial</b> <b>cell</b> bundles observed 48 Â± 5 and number of <b>interstitial</b> <b>cells</b> observed in each bundle are 5 to 9. In the active ovary of Megaderma lyra lyra the bundles of <b>interstitial</b> <b>cells</b> observed 56 Â± 5. Number of <b>interstitial</b> <b>cells</b> in each bundle in Megaderma lyra lyra observed 10 to 20. Pregnant ovary of Megaderma lyra lyra showed extroverted carpus luteum, atretic follicles and destructed <b>interstitial</b> <b>cells.</b> In the immature ovary of Rousettus leschenaulti numerous <b>interstitial</b> <b>cells</b> observed in the stromal region. In the inactive ovary of Rousettus leschenaulti, <b>interstitial</b> <b>cell</b> bundles observed 41 Â± 5 and number of <b>interstitial</b> <b>cells</b> observed in each bundle are 5 to 7. In active ovary of Rousettus leschenaulti the bundles of <b>interstitial</b> <b>cells</b> observed 47 Â± 5.

40|$|Summary. The {{role of the}} {{cellular}} environment on hydra stem cell proliferation and differentiation was investigat-ed by introduction of <b>interstitial</b> <b>cells</b> into host tissue of defined cellular composition. In epithelial tissue lack-ing all non-epithelial <b>cells</b> the <b>interstitial</b> <b>cell</b> population did not grow but differentiated into nerve cells and ne-matocytes. In host tissue with progressively increased numbers of nerve cells growth of the <b>interstitial</b> <b>cell</b> pop-ulation was positively correlated to the nerve cell density. In agreement with previous observations (Bode et al. 1976), growth of the <b>interstitial</b> <b>cell</b> population was also found to be negatively correlated {{to the level of}} intersti-tial cells present. The strong correlation between the growth of the <b>interstitial</b> <b>cell</b> population and the presence of <b>interstitial</b> <b>cells</b> and nerve <b>cells</b> implies that <b>interstitial</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation is controlled by a feedback signal from <b>interstitial</b> <b>cells</b> and their derivatives. Our results uggest that {{the cellular}} environment of <b>interstitial</b> <b>cells</b> provides cues which are instrumental in stem cell decision making...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveAortic {{stenosis}} is {{an inflammatory}} disease, {{associated with increased}} tissue levels of interleukin- 1 beta. We hypothesized that the antagonist of interleukin- 1 beta, interleukin- 1 receptor antagonist, is deficient in aortic valves and that its production by aortic valve <b>interstitial</b> <b>cells</b> is less in cells from stenotic valves than from controls. MethodsValve leaflets from stenotic aortic valves (nÂ =Â  6) and from valves from hearts explanted {{at the time of}} cardiac transplantation (nÂ =Â  6) were studied by immunostaining for interleukin- 1 receptor antagonist. Aortic valve <b>interstitial</b> <b>cells</b> were isolated from valves, and receptor antagonist levels were determined from cell lysates (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). Osteogenic phenotype changes in valve <b>cells</b> <b>stimulated</b> by toll-like receptors 2 and 4 were determined by immunoblotting for bone morphogenetic protein- 2 after treatment with and without interleukin- 1 receptor antagonist (100 Î¼g/mL). Statistics were by analysis of variance. ResultsInterleukin- 1 receptor antagonist was abundant in nonstenotic aortic valve leaflets and virtually absent in leaflets from stenotic valves. Aortic valve <b>interstitial</b> <b>cells</b> from grossly normal leaflets produced significantly more receptor antagonist at baseline and in response to toll-like receptor 2 and 4 stimulation, than did cells from diseased valves (PÂ <Â  0. 05). Interleukin- 1 receptor antagonist was able to significantly attenuate toll-like receptor 2, but not toll-like receptor 4, stimulated bone morphogenetic protein- 2 production in aortic valve <b>interstitial</b> <b>cells</b> (PÂ <Â . 05). ConclusionsInterleukin- 1 receptor antagonistâmediated mechanisms of anti-inflammation are dysfunctional in stenotic valves. We conclude that such impaired mechanisms of anti-inflammation may contribute to the pathogenesis of aortic stenosis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Antisera to ovine {{follicle}} <b>stimulating</b> <b>hormone</b> free of ovine lutinising hormone contamination {{has been}} obtained in monkeys. These antisera {{have been shown}} to be able to crossreact with ovine lutinising hormone. Quantitation of the binding data for ovine follicle <b>stimulating</b> <b>hormone</b> and ovine lutinising hormone show that 10 â 40 % of the total antibody population to ovine follicle <b>stimulating</b> <b>hormone</b> can bind to ovine lutinising hormone and the affinity constant for ovine lutinising hormone is about 2 â 20 times lesser than for ovine follicle <b>stimulating</b> <b>hormone.</b> These binding data indicate that there are common epitopes exposed in ovine follicle <b>stimulating</b> <b>hormone</b> and ovine lutinising hormone through the Î±-subunit. Results are obtained which match with the above conclusions when ovine lutinising hormone antisera is analysed for ovine follicle <b>stimulating</b> <b>hormone</b> binding. These results show that the Î±-subunit when combined with different Ã-subunits will have common epitopes exposed, but would be sterically disposed differently in the two hormones...|$|R
40|$|In a {{screening}} programme for neonatal hypothyroidism an otherwise healthy female infant {{was found to}} have a high concentration of thyroid <b>stimulating</b> <b>hormone</b> in a filter paper blood spot and in serum. A high concentration was also found in the maternal serum. Mother and baby were both biochemically euthyroid with normal serum thyroxine concentrations. The apparently high concentration of thyroid <b>stimulating</b> <b>hormone</b> in the mother was due to the presence of an IgG antibody that bound to human but not bovine thyroid <b>stimulating</b> <b>hormone.</b> Maternal serum inhibited the action of human thyroid <b>stimulating</b> <b>hormone</b> in an in vitro bioassay for the hormone. It is suggested that the baby acquired the antibody transplacentally, especially as the concentration of thyroid <b>stimulating</b> <b>hormone</b> subsequently fell. It is concluded that maternal serum should be assayed for thyroid <b>stimulating</b> <b>hormone</b> when a neonate is found to have a high concentration of the hormone and a normal concentration of thyroxine to establish the incidence of this finding and to avoid inappropriate replacement treatment...|$|R
40|$|The {{relative}} {{ability of}} ovine follicle <b>stimulating</b> <b>hormone</b> and its beta-subunit, two potential candidates for male contraceptive vaccine, to generate antibodies in monkeys capable of bioneutralizing follicle <b>stimulating</b> <b>hormone</b> {{was assessed using}} in vitro model systems. Antiserum against native ovine follicle <b>stimulating</b> <b>hormone</b> {{was found to be}} highly specific to the intact form with no cross-reactivity with either of the two subunits while the antiserum against beta-subunit of follicle <b>stimulating</b> <b>hormone</b> could bind to the beta-subunit in its free form as well as when it is combined with alpha-subunit to form the intact hormone. Both antisera could block the binding of the hormone to the receptor if the hormone was preincubated with the antibody. However, the follicle <b>stimulating</b> <b>hormone</b> beta-antisera could only inhibit the binding of the hormone partially (33 percent inhibition) if the antibody and receptor were mixed prior to the addition of the hormone, while antisera to the native follicle <b>stimulating</b> <b>hormone</b> could block the binding completely (100 percent inhibition) in the same experiment. Similarly antisera to the native follicle <b>stimulating</b> <b>hormone</b> was significantly effective in blocking (100 percent) response to follicle <b>stimulating</b> <b>hormone</b> but not the beta-subunit antisera (0 percent) as checked using an in vitro granulosa cell system. Thus the probability of obtaining antibodies of greater bioneutralization potential is much higher if intact hormone is used as an antigen rather than its beta-subunit as a vaccine...|$|R
