25|$|In {{the base}} 10 numeral system, in almost {{universal}} use today for mathematical operations, the symbols for natural numbers are written using ten digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. The radix or base {{is the number}} of unique numerical digits, including zero, that a numeral system uses to represent numbers (for the decimal system, the radix is 10). In this base10 system, the rightmost digit of a natural number <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> value of1, and every other digit <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> value ten times that of the place value of the digit to its right.|$|E

25|$|In a basic digital system, a numeral is a {{sequence}} of digits, which may be of arbitrary length.

25|$|In the Russo-Turkish War, the {{fortress}} {{was taken by}} Russian field marshal Burkhard Christoph von Munnich on August 19, 1739.

This ode <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> {{in the history of}} Russian literature: its sonorous iambic verse is often taken as a starting point of the modern Russian poetry.|$|E

25|$|Part of his {{writings}} consist of commentaries on the portions of Aristotle then known, or rather of commentaries on the commentaries of Averroes.

25|$|Aung San's {{name had}} been invoked by {{successive}} Burmese governments since independence, until the military regime in the 1990s tried to eradicate all traces of Aung San's memory. Nevertheless, several statues of him adorn the former capital Yangon and his portrait still <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> of pride in many homes and offices throughout the country. Scott Market, Yangon's most famous, was renamed Bogyoke Market in his memory, and Commissioner Road was retitled Bogyoke Aung San Road after independence. These names have been retained. Many towns and cities in Burma have thoroughfares and parks named after him. His portrait was held up across the nation during the 8888 Uprising in 1988 and used as a rallying point. Following the 8888 Uprising, the government redesigned the national currency, the kyat, removing his picture {{and replacing it with}} scenes of Burmese life.|$|E
25|$|The chief {{separately}} published {{works of}} Ronsard are noted above. He produced, however, during his life {{a vast number}} of separate publications, some of them mere pamphlets or broadsheets, which from time to time he collected, often striking out others at the same time, in the successive editions of his works. Of these he himself published seven - the first in 1560, the last in 1584. Between his death and the year 1630 ten more complete editions were published, the most famous of which is the folio of 1609. A copy of this presented by Sainte-Beuve to Victor Hugo, and later in the possession of Maxime du Camp, <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> of its own in French literary history. The work of Claude Binet in 1586, Discours de la vie de Pierre de Ronsard, is very important for early information, and the author seems to have revised some of Ronsard's work under the poet's own direction.|$|E
