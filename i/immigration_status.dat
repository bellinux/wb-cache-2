25|$|Due to the {{historical}} background of Hong Kong, <b>immigration</b> <b>status</b> in Hong Kong is determined {{by a combination of}} both nationality and residence status. Therefore, even a Chinese national with the right of abode in Hong Kong has a slightly different status to a foreign national with the right of abode in Hong Kong as well (since the former can never lose the right of abode status while the latter can lose it if he does not enter Hong Kong for a period of 36 months). At the same time, a foreign national with the right of abode in Hong Kong has a preferential <b>immigration</b> <b>status</b> to a Chinese national without the right of abode in Hong Kong, as the former can remain in Hong Kong indefinitely, while the latter has to have his <b>immigration</b> <b>status</b> reassessed whenever his visa/permit expires.|$|E

Among those immigrants who became citizens, 18.5% were uninsured, as opposed to noncitizens, who are 43.6% uninsured.

40|$|SAP is an {{open access}} publisherOBJECTIVES: The {{multicultural}} study aims at examining Physical Activity Change of English, French and Chinese speaking immigrants in Ottawa and Gatineau, Canada, and identifying demographic factors that correlate with the change and impact the change. METHODS: 810 immigrants of three language sub-groups were recruited by purposive-sampling. Using self-reports, respondents answered questions regarding Physical Activity Change and Demography in Multicultural Lifestyle Change Questionnaire of English, French or Chinese version. Data were analyzed statistically in percentage, correlation, regression and factor analysis. RESULTS: Immigrants of different gender, language and category sub-groups exhibited different rates in Physical Activity Change, and different language sub-groups displayed different Physical Exercise Items rates after immigration, but no statistical difference between the rates. Physical Activity Change (Physical Activity Behavior Change + Physical Activity Belief Change) was negatively correlated with Gender, Category of <b>Immigration,</b> Employment <b>Status</b> and Primary Occupation. Physical Activity Behavior Change was negatively correlated with Age, Gender, Category of <b>Immigration,</b> Employment <b>Status</b> and Primary Occupation. Age, Gender, Category of <b>Immigration</b> and Employment <b>Status</b> significantly impacted Physical Activity Change. Mother Tongue, Age, Gender, Category of <b>Immigration</b> and Employment <b>Status</b> significantly impacted Physical Activity Behavior Change. Two factors (factor one: physical activity behavior change factor and factor two: physical activity belief change factor) influenced significantly Physical Activity Change. Factor one exposed more significant effect than factor two. CONCLUSIONS: Different immigrant sub-groups experienced different Physical Activity Change and three language sub-groups presented different physical activity patterns after immigration. Age, Gender, Category of <b>Immigration,</b> Employment <b>Status</b> and Primary Occupation were main factors impacting significantly Physical Activity Change. Mother Tongue was an important factor influencing significantly Physical Activity Behavior Change. Culture and acculturation were relating contributing factors. Data may provide evidence and implication for physical exercising policy-making and policy-revising in Canada...|$|R

50|$|As {{those who}} were born in Canada {{normally}} acquired citizenship at birth under both 1947 and 1977 Acts, birth certificates issued by the provincial or territorial government are usually considered by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada as adequate proof of citizenship. There are, however, complications when the person failed to acquire Canadian citizenship because of the exceptions listed under subsection 3(2) of the Act. As the Federal government does not keep records of the <b>immigration</b> <b>statuses</b> of parents at birth, a person may {{be recognized as a}} Canadian based solely on his or her birth within Canada when, in fact, he or she does not possess Canadian citizenship in accordance with subsection 3(2).

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} cities are {{important}} {{political and legal}} communities that construct and govern the “rights in action” of undocumented aliens in the United States today. However, it also challenges the proposition that large U. S. cities {{are likely to be}} sites for expansive citizenship for all non-citizens. Through close examination of case law and publicly available documents related to New York City's changing police department policies concerning the <b>immigration</b> <b>statuses</b> of its residents, the paper reveals how limited U. S. cities may actually be in attempts to formulate positive laws expanding the “rights” or “citizenship” of undocumented aliens in particular. On a theoretical level, this paper argues that attention must be given to the prominent role of positive law in U. S. immigration and alienage law {{as well as to the}} complexities created for positive law by overlapping jurisdictions and modern administrative modes of governance. While this paper concedes that a formal, legal conception of citizenship need not dominate all discussions of citizenship, it nonetheless seeks to build a particularly sociolegal framework for institutional analysis of cities, citizenship, and alienage in the U. S. today...|$|R
