5|$|A {{group of}} Andalusian exiles conquered Crete in c. 824 or in 827/828, quickly {{establishing}} an independent state. The Byzantines {{launched a campaign}} that took most of the island back in 842 and 843 under Theoktistos, but the reconquest was not completed and was soon reversed. Later attempts by the Byzantine Empire to recover the island failed, and for the approximately 135 years of its existence, the emirate {{was one of the}} major foes of Byzantium. Crete commanded the sea lanes of the Eastern Mediterranean and functioned as a <b>forward</b> <b>base</b> and haven for Muslim corsair fleets that ravaged the Byzantine-controlled shores of the Aegean Sea. The emirate's internal history is less well-known, but all accounts point to considerable prosperity deriving not only from piracy but also from extensive trade and agriculture. The emirate was brought to an end by Nikephoros Phokas, who launched a huge campaign against it in 960–961.|$|E
5|$|Sundjata {{starts the}} {{campaign}} by fleeing {{the city of}} Niani and the clutches of Sumanguru. He wanders through the wilderness, acquiring supporters along the way and eventually ends up encamping in Kangaba, from where musters his forces to destroy the Sosso scouts' <b>forward</b> <b>base.</b> He then seeks to undermine the power of Sumanguru with his allies, Tabon and Wagadou by taking a sacred relic cart to his enemies Niger, Sangaran, Labe, forcing these villages to submit to his rule. He then cuts off Sumanguru's resources by plundering gold {{from the city of}} Djenne; following that, he then takes over the Niger River and destroys all of Sumanguru's military camps in the region, acquiring the allegiance of Sumanguru's former vassals Fakoli and Mema. Sundjata finally assaults the enemy base in Koumbi Saleh, killing Sumanguru once and for all and establishing his sovereignty over the Malian Empire.|$|E
5|$|The Spirit of Fires crew awakens from cryosleep at the Ark and {{receives}} a UNSC {{signal from the}} surface of the installation. Spartan Red Team is deployed to investigate the signal. They recover Isabel from a base but during the exfiltration, Spartan Douglas-042 is injured in an engagement with Atriox and Spartan Alice-130 is left stranded on the Ark. Back on the Spirit of Fire, Isabel reveals to Captain Cutter how Atriox and the Banished invaded the Ark, which leads Cutter to declare war on the Banished. A strike team manages to set up a <b>forward</b> <b>base</b> and defeat Decimus, who is salvaging the Ark’s resources. Decimus escapes and orders a bombardment upon his own base. Upon investigating the wreckage, Isabel discovers information about the Cartographer, a map of key systems and weapons upon the Ark. The team secures a Forerunner elevator and ascends to the Cartographer.|$|E

Harrier <b>forward</b> <b>bases</b> and light maintenance facilities {{were to be}} set up in under 24 hours on any prospective battle area. The <b>forward</b> <b>bases,</b> containing one to four aircraft, were to be located [...] from the forward edge of battle (FEBA), while a more established permanent airbase would be located around [...] from the FEBA. The close proximity of <b>forward</b> <b>bases</b> allowed for a far greater sortie rate and reduced fuel consumption.|$|R

5|$|The {{third phase}} {{received}} the least consideration, but naval planners {{were aware that}} Singapore was too far from Japan to provide an adequate base for operations close to Japan. Moreover, the further the fleet proceeded from Singapore, the weaker it would become. If American assistance was forthcoming, there was the prospect of Manila {{being used as a}} <b>forward</b> <b>base.</b> The idea of invading Japan and fighting its armies on its own soil was rejected as impractical, but the British planners did not expect that the Japanese would willingly fight a decisive naval battle against the odds. They were therefore drawn to the concept of a blockade. From personal experience they were aware of the impact it could have on an island nation {{at the heart of a}} maritime empire, and felt that economic pressure would suffice.|$|E
5|$|The trail {{came to a}} {{dead end}} at the steep banks of the Se Pone River and the force was trapped. The North Vietnamese closed in and savage rearguard actions ensued. Two bulldozers were finally helilifted into the ARVN {{perimeter}} to create a ford, and {{the survivors of the}} force crossed into South Vietnam on 23 March. By the 25th, 45 days after the beginning of the operation, the remainder of the South Vietnamese force that had survived had left Laos behind. The <b>forward</b> <b>base</b> at Khe Sanh had also come under increasing artillery bombardment and sapper attacks and by 6 April it was abandoned and Operation Lam Son 719 was over.|$|E
5|$|USMC AV-8Bs {{took part}} in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan from 2001. The USMC 15th MEU arrived {{off the coast of}} Pakistan in October 2001. Operating from the unit's ships, four AV-8Bs began attack {{missions}} into Afghanistan on 3 November 2001. The 26th MEU and its AV-8Bs joined 15th MEU later that month. In December 2001, AV-8Bs began moving into Afghanistan to a <b>forward</b> <b>base</b> at Kandahar. More AV-8Bs were deployed with other USMC units to the region in 2002. The VMA-513 squadron deployed six Night Attack AV-8Bs to Bagram in October 2002. These aircraft each carried a LITENING targeting pod to perform reconnaissance missions along with attack and other missions, primarily at night.|$|E

5|$|Established in March 1945 {{under the}} command of Group Captain J.M. Whyte, No.86 (Attack) Wing {{comprised}} two flying units, No.1 Squadron operating de Havilland Mosquitos and No.93 Squadron operating Bristol Beaufighters. The wing was initially based on the island of Morotai in the South West Pacific theatre, as part of the Australian First Tactical Air Force. Its order of battle for Operation Oboe Six, the assault on north-west Borneo commencing in June, included Nos.1 and 93 Squadrons, No.84 Operational Base Unit, No.30 Air Stores Park, No.29 Medical Clearing Station, and No.1 Repair and Servicing Unit—a total of over 1,400 personnel. Delays getting the aircraft operational at their <b>forward</b> <b>base</b> on Labuan meant that the wing only completed three combat missions {{before the end of the}} Pacific War, conducting rocket and machine-gun attacks on targets in Sarawak during August 1945. No.1 Squadron took part in one operation and No.93 Squadron in two; each unit lost one aircraft in action.|$|E
5|$|For both sides, Port Moresby was {{strategically}} important, {{offering a}} <b>forward</b> <b>base</b> {{from which to}} project further operations. Following {{the failure of a}} seaborne assault by the Japanese on Port Moresby resulting from the Battle of the Coral Sea in May 1942 and further losses during the Battle of Midway, it was planned to capture the town via an overland advance across the Owen Stanley Range along the Kokoda Track. On 21 July 1942, Japanese forces landed on the northern Papuan coast at Basbua, between Buna and Gona. The advanced landing forces, consisting primarily of the Colonel Yosuke Yokoyama's 15th Independent Engineer Regiment, sailed from Rabaul and came ashore unchallenged as there were {{only a small number of}} Australians stationed in the area. Shortly afterwards a small advanced element, supported by part of the 1st Battalion, 144th Infantry Regiment, began moving south-west towards Oivi, mounted in motor vehicles and on bicycles. These troops were initially tasked with proving the route over the Owen Stanleys before the main body of the landing force, Major General Tomitaro Horii's South Seas Detachment, arrived.|$|E
5|$|The 1919 plans {{incorporated}} a Mobile Naval Base Defence Organisation (MNBDO) which could develop and defend a <b>forward</b> <b>base.</b> The MNBDO had a strength of 7,000 and included a brigade of antiaircraft artillery, a brigade of coastal artillery and {{a battalion of}} infantry, all drawn from the Royal Marines. In one paper exercise, the Royal Marines occupied Nakagusuku Bay unopposed and the MNBDO developed a major base there from which the fleet blockaded Japan. Actual fleet exercises were conducted in the Mediterranean in the 1920s to test the MNBDO concept. However, the Royal Marines were not greatly interested in amphibious warfare, and lacking organisational backing, the techniques and tactics of amphibious warfare began to atrophy. By the 1930s the Admiralty was concerned that the United States and Japan were well ahead of Britain in this field and persuaded the Army and RAF to join with it in establishing the Inter-Service Training and Development Centre, which opened in July 1938. Under its first commandant, Captain Loben Edward Harold Maund, it began investigating the problems of amphibious warfare, including the design of landing craft.|$|E

5|$|The fleet carrier HMS Implacable was {{dispatched}} {{from the}} United Kingdom in February 1945 {{to reinforce the}} BPF. The ship arrived at Sydney on 8 May. On 24 May Implacable departed Sydney, and reached the BPF's <b>forward</b> <b>base</b> at Manus Island five days later. The {{main body of the}} BPF arrived at Manus to refuel on 30 May, and most of its ships continued to Sydney on 1 June. Implacable remained at Manus, which she and her air group used as a base for intensive training. As part of the preparations for the BPF's return to combat, Vice-Admiral Bernard Rawlings – the commander of the fleet's combat force – decided at around this time to dispatch Implacable and several other recently arrived warships to attack the Japanese positions at Truk. The purpose of this operation was to ensure that the warships' crews had recent combat experience before the BPF commenced operations off Japan during July. Rawlings' initial orders for the attack specified that it was to involve two days of air strikes against Japanese airfields. The crews of the ships involved, including Implacables aircraft pilots, were not told that the operation was being undertaken for training purposes.|$|E
5|$|During the French and Indian War, the North American {{front of}} the Seven Years' War in Europe, the British {{directly}} challenged France {{for control of the}} region. Although no pitched battles occurred in Indiana, the native tribes of the region supported the French. At the beginning of the war, the tribes sent large groups of warriors to support the French in resisting the British advance and to raid British colonies. Using Fort Pitt as a <b>forward</b> <b>base,</b> British commander Robert Rogers overcame the native resistance and drove deep into the frontier to capture Fort Detroit. The rangers moved south from Detroit and captured many of the key French outposts in Indiana, including Fort Miamis and Fort Vincennes. As the war progressed, the French lost control of Canada after the fall of Montreal. No longer able to effectively fight the British in interior North America, they lost Indiana to British forces. By 1761 the French were entirely forced out of Indiana. Following the French expulsion, the native tribes, led by Chief Pontiac, confederated in an attempt to rebel against the British without French assistance. While Pontiac was besieging British-held Fort Detroit, other tribes in Indiana rose up against the British. They were forced to surrender Fort Miamis and Fort Ouiatenon. In 1763, while Pontiac was fighting the British, the French signed the Treaty of Paris and ceded control of Indiana to the British.|$|E
