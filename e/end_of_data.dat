50|$|The {{end of a}} {{frame is}} usually {{indicated}} by the end-of-data-stream symbol at the physical layer or by loss of the carrier signal; an example is 10BASE-T, where the receiving station detects {{the end of a}} transmitted frame by loss of the carrier. Later physical layers use an explicit <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> or end of stream symbol or sequence to avoid ambiguity, especially where the carrier is continually sent between frames; an example is Gigabit Ethernet with its 8b/10b encoding scheme that uses special symbols which are transmitted before and after a frame is transmitted.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{manufacturers}} and organizations [...] added additional {{information to the}} basic SSI protocol. It was done mainly to ensure proper data transmission. For secure transmission and to indicate the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> transmission CRC bits or parity bits can be added. In simple words, they were used for identifying if the byte has been correctly interpreted and received. In the original specification multiple transmissions were used to ensure data integrity. In this case, two consecutive transmissions of the same data were initiated and compared for any error in transmission. But this however reduces the protocol efficiency by 50% compared to parallel data transmission.|$|E
5000|$|Further {{refinements}} include reserving a code {{to indicate}} that the code table should be cleared and restored to its initial state (a [...] "clear code", typically the first value immediately after the values for the individual alphabet characters), and a code to indicate the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> (a [...] "stop code", typically one greater than the clear code). The clear code allows the table to be reinitialized after it fills up, which lets the encoding adapt to changing patterns in the input data. Smart encoders can monitor the compression efficiency and clear the table whenever the existing table no longer matches the input well.|$|E
