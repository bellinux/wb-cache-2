5000|$|Hot {{electrons}} arise generically at {{low temperatures}} even in <b>degenerate</b> <b>semiconductors</b> or metals. There {{are a number}} of models to describe the hot-electron effect. [...] The simplest predicts an electron-phonon (e-p) interaction based on a clean three-dimensional free-electron model. Hot electron effect models illustrate a correlation between power dissipated, the electron gas temperature and overheating.|$|R
50|$|In {{semiconductor}} production, doping is {{the intentional}} introduction of impurities into an intrinsic semiconductor {{for the purpose}} of modulating its electrical properties. The doped material is referred to as extrinsic semiconductors. A semiconductor doped to such high levels that it acts more like a conductor than a semiconductor is referred to as a <b>degenerate</b> <b>semiconductor.</b>|$|E
50|$|At {{moderate}} doping levels the dopant atoms create individual doping {{levels that}} {{can often be}} considered as localized states that can donate electrons or holes by thermal promotion (or an optical transition) to the conduction or valence bands respectively. At high enough impurity concentrations the individual impurity atoms may become close enough neighbors that their doping levels merge into an impurity band and the behavior of such a system ceases to show the typical traits of a semiconductor, e.g. its increase in conductivity with temperature. On the other hand, a <b>degenerate</b> <b>semiconductor</b> still has far fewer charge carriers than a true metal so that its behavior {{is in many ways}} intermediary between semiconductor and metal.|$|E
5000|$|The effect {{occurs when}} the {{electron}} carrier concentration exceeds the conduction band edge density of states, which corresponds to degenerate doping in semiconductors. In nominally doped semiconductors, the Fermi level lies between the conduction and valence bands. For example, in n-doped semiconductor, as the doping concentration is increased, electrons populate states within the conduction band which pushes the Fermi level to higher energy. In the case of degenerate level of doping, the Fermi level lies inside the conduction band. The [...] "apparent" [...] band gap of a semiconductor can be measured using transmission/reflection spectroscopy. In {{the case of a}} <b>degenerate</b> <b>semiconductor,</b> an electron {{from the top of the}} valence band can only be excited into conduction band above the Fermi level (which now lies in conduction band) since all the states below the Fermi level are occupied states. Pauli's exclusion principle forbids excitation into these occupied states. Thus we observe an increase in the apparent band gap. Apparent band gap = Actual band gap + Moss-Burstein shift (as shown in the figure).|$|E
5000|$|In <b>degenerate</b> <b>semiconductors,</b> the Lorenz number L has {{a strong}} {{dependency}} on certain system parameters: dimensionality, strength of interatomic interactions and Fermi-level. This law is not valid or {{the value of the}} Lorenznumber can be reduced at least in following cases: manipulating electronic density of states, varying doping density and layer thickness in superlattices and materials with correlated carriers.|$|R
50|$|The Moss-Burstein {{effect is}} the {{phenomenon}} of which the apparent band gap of a semiconductor is increased as the absorption edge is pushed to higher energies {{as a result of}} some states close to the conduction band being populated. This is observed for a degenerate electron distribution such as that found in some <b>Degenerate</b> <b>semiconductors</b> and is known as a Moss-Burstein shift.|$|R

Our extended model for grain boundary scattering in semiconductors of arbitrary degeneracy is based on previous models from literature and suitable to describe the Hall mobility of the carriers {{as a function of}} the free carrier concentration and the temperature at the same time. It is mathematically simple enough for a fast fit procedure, which is not possible with most of the previous models. Applying a combined transport model consisting of ionized impurity scattering, phonon scattering, and grain boundary scattering in <b>degenerate</b> <b>semiconductors,</b> we were able to determine the trap density at the grain boundaries Nt approx. 3 1013 to 5 1013 cm 2 and the deformation potential Eac in the range of 5 eV to 9 eV depending on the details of the transport mode...|$|R

50|$|Unlike {{a regular}} metal, semimetals have charge {{carriers}} of both types (holes and electrons), {{so that one}} could also argue {{that they should be}} called 'double-metals' rather than semimetals. However, the charge carriers typically occur in much smaller numbers than in a real metal. In this respect they resemble <b>degenerate</b> <b>semiconductors</b> more closely.

The variation of the Seebeck coefficients of TFTCs as a function of temperature difference is shown in Fig.  4 b. Apparently, the Seebeck coefficients of the TFTC also increased rapidly with increasing temperature difference. We believe this is mainly induced by the variation of Seebeck coefficient of ITO. As <b>degenerate</b> <b>semiconductor</b> material, the Seebeck coefficient varies with the degeneration level. The degeneration level would gradually decreased with increasing temperature until the intrinsic excitation occurred. As a result, the absolute value of the Seebeck coefficient of ITO increased significantly with increasing temperature [19, 20].|$|E
