40|$|We {{examine and}} test the merits of diversifying {{portfolios}} of real estate securities internationally and across <b>property</b> <b>types.</b> Our analysis covers the period January 1990 through July 2005. Using data from the Global Property Research GPR 250 Property Securities Index, which has monthly prices for five <b>property</b> <b>type</b> indexes in 21 countries, we decompose country and <b>property</b> <b>type</b> sources of variation in real estate security returns. We find that <b>property</b> <b>type</b> effects are smaller than country effects. <b>Property</b> <b>type</b> specialization explains only 6 % of the variance of national real estate securities index returns. Because <b>property</b> <b>type</b> effects are so small, country diversification is a more effective tool for achieving risk reduction than <b>property</b> <b>type</b> diversification. In addition, we find evidence that {{the relative importance of}} country effects is decreasing while that of industry effects is increasing. However, country effects continue to dominate <b>property</b> <b>type</b> effects.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to review the <b>property</b> <b>types</b> {{diversification}} strategy of Malaysian REITs. Previous study has found that Malaysian REITs received poor response form investors both local and international. Furthermore, the underperformance of Malaysian REITs was linked to the characteristics of REITs' <b>property</b> <b>types</b> and REITs' portfolio influenced its financial performance. The lack of local study on both of these determinants of influence on performance of Malaysian REITs is a research gap, which needs to be explored that can provide more insight of it. This study showed that the <b>property</b> <b>types</b> such as office space, commercial lot, industrial, hotel and specialized <b>property</b> <b>type</b> are the important determinants, which can influence the performance of REITs. The study comprised of REITs data from 2010 until 2014, and through Multiple Regression Analysis (MRA) reveals there is little influence of <b>property</b> <b>types</b> diversification strategy toward Malaysian REITs' performance. Nevertheless, by employ correlation analysis between each of the five <b>property</b> <b>types</b> with expected return and dividend yield, this study shows Malaysian REITs' performance of dividend yield(DY) has a positive correlation value with commercial lot <b>property</b> <b>type</b> and Malaysian REITs' performance of expected return(ER) have a highest positive correlation value with industrial <b>property</b> <b>types.</b> Also, this study suggests that <b>property</b> <b>type</b> diversification play a significant role in Malaysia REITs.

Framed in a {{quadrant}} model, {{the data}} sources that analysts use {{to predict the}} performance of core <b>property</b> <b>types</b> for the major metropolitan areas in the United States are reviewed. The hypothesis is that forecasters rely on information from the economic base, the property inventory and financial performance quadrants to generate forecasts. For each core <b>property</b> <b>type,</b> analysts are rather homogeneous in grouping metropolitan areas from best to worst. However, the <b>property</b> <b>type</b> determines what sets of economic, social, inventory and market information are used.

40|$|The {{question}} as to whether it is better to diversify a real estate portfolio within a <b>property</b> <b>type</b> across the regions or within a region across the <b>property</b> <b>types</b> is one of continuing interest for academics and practitioners alike. The current study, however, is somewhat different from the usual sector/regional analysis taking account of the fact that holdings in the UK real estate market are heavily concentrated in a single region, London. As a result this study is designed to investigate whether a real estate fund manager can obtain a statistically significant improvement in risk/return performance from extending out of a London based portfolio into firstly the rest of the South East of England and then into the remainder of the UK, or whether the manger would be better off staying within London and diversifying across the various <b>property</b> <b>types.</b> The results indicating that staying within London and diversifying across the various <b>property</b> <b>types</b> may offer performance comparable with regional diversification, although this conclusion largely depends on the time period and the fund manager’s ability to diversify efficiently...|$|R

Our paper enhances the conventional unit root tests by allowing for structural breaks, while including structural break tests strengthens our analysis. Our empirical results support the existence of structural breaks in the mean equation in seven out of thirteen regions of the UK as well as in three out of four <b>property</b> <b>types,</b> and in the variance equation in six regions and three <b>property</b> <b>types.</b> In addition, using a multivariate GARCH approach we examine both the behaviour of variances and covariances of the house price returns over time.

40|$|In a {{mean-variance}} state investment managers must thoroughly specify portfolio risk {{to obtain}} full diversification and select investment options on the efficient frontier. However, diversification within {{real estate is}} not as costless as other financial assets such as stocks or bonds. The local nature of real estate implies that investment managers may need to specialize for simplicity or by portfolio objective. To address this trade-off between diversification and specialization this study quantifies the relation between commercial property returns and distance. The returns of four <b>types</b> of commercial <b>properties</b> are modeled {{as a function of}} the distance of separation by measuring the covariation between each commercial return. Results are obtained for the effects of diversifying based upon distance and also upon <b>property</b> <b>type,</b> size and distance. The results indicate that correlation for the same <b>type</b> of commercial <b>properties</b> located within the same or adjacent zip codes can be as high as 0. 93. After controlling for <b>property</b> <b>type</b> and size, the correlation reduces significantly. However, when residential data are matched by location to the commercial returns and added to the controls for <b>property</b> <b>type</b> and size, the spatial autocorrelation between different <b>property</b> <b>types</b> in the same or adjacent zip codes is 0. 89. In all instances, the distance at which the spatial autocorrelation decays to zero is approximately 60 miles...|$|R
