This explains the high level of U.S. funding, particularly within the peace and security sector, during the years immediately after the 2005 signing of the CPA in Sudan. The U.S. government's priority was to assist in the implementation of the agreement, as Sudan's ability to achieve stability rested primarily on the CPA.|$|E
2500|$|Despite QPR's perilous {{financial}} condition in 2007–08, the combined personal {{wealth of the}} club's new owners – which included the then world's eighth richest man, Lakshmi Mittal – sparked speculation that QPR would receive significant further investment from their new benefactors, drawing parallels with their wealthy West London neighbours Chelsea and Fulham. However, no significant further funds were {{made available to the}} club other than those injected as part of the purchase of its share capital, and much of the subsequent player transfer activity involved loan acquisitions or free transfers. Indeed, it was reported in January 2008 that the investors had not discharged the £10million loan from ABC Corporation – secured on the club's stadium – together with its £1million annual interest burden—despite the club's prospective annual turnover of between £10million and £15million. Furthermore, around £2million was still owed to former director and major shareholder, Antonio Caliendo, who waived £4.5million of loans when Briatore and Ecclestone bought the club. It was expected that the ABC loan would be discharged in June 2008 on its maturity and that the debt owed to Caliendo would be paid off [...] "in early 2008" [...] in line with a <b>funding</b> <b>strategy</b> which Ecclestone publicly stated would not result in the wealthy owners simply bankrolling the club. In fact, the ABC loan was discharged on or around 31 July 2008.|$|E

The purpose of this thesis is therefore to clarify to investors how examined hedge <b>fund</b> <b>strategies</b> separate concerning risk and return in hedge funds. This, {{in order to facilitate}} for investors understanding which hedge <b>fund</b> <b>strategy</b> will be more suitable for them. To achieve this, the thesis is mainly focusing on quantitative data, which is complemented with qualitative findings in terms of a questionnaire. The hedge funds have been categorized after selected strategy. Furthermore a comparison between the strategies, as well as towards an independent market index has been made, using different measures of risk. The thesis show that all strategies generate less return compared to the stock-related index OMXS, on the other hand the strategies shows a lower level of risk. Fund – of – funds have the best average return and risk-adjusted return, while Multi-strategy have the lowest risk. Macro is the only strategy who achieved quarterly absolute return...|$|R
40|$|With hedge funds, {{managers}} develop {{risk management}} models that mainly aim {{to play on}} the effect of decorrelation. In order to achieve this goal, companies use the correlation coefficient as an indicator for measuring dependencies existing between (i) the various hedge <b>funds</b> <b>strategies</b> and share index returns and (ii) hedge <b>funds</b> <b>strategies</b> against each other. Otherwise, copulas are a statistic tool to model the dependence in a realistic and less restrictive way, taking better account of the stylized facts in finance. This paper is a practical implementation of the copulas theory to model dependence between different hedge <b>fund</b> <b>strategies</b> and share index returns and between these strategies in relation to each other on a "normal" period and a period during which the market trend is downward. Our approach based on copulas allows us to determine the bivariate VaR level curves and to study extremal dependence between hedge <b>funds</b> <b>strategies</b> and share index returns through the use of some tail dependence measures which can be made into useful portfolio management tools.

For each hedge <b>fund</b> <b>strategy,</b> a replication strategy is put in place that attempts to mimic what the hedge fund manager is doing in a mechanical fashion. Consequently, {{one would expect to}} generate the beta, but not the alpha, of that particular strategy. This process is carried out for each of the hedge <b>fund</b> <b>strategies,</b> and then these strategies are combined to produce a product that attempts to replicate the entire hedge fund universe.|$|R

40|$|We present {{how to use}} {{stochastic}} programming to best fund a pool of similar fixed-rate mortgages through issuing bonds, callable and non-callable, of various maturities. We discuss the estimation of expected net present value and (downside) risk for different funding instruments using Monte Carlo simulation techniques, and the optimization of the funding using single- and multi-stage {{stochastic programming}}. Using realistic data we computed efficient frontiers of expected net present value versus downside risk for the single- and the multi-stage model, and studied the underlying <b>funding</b> <b>strategies.</b> Constraining the duration and convexity of the mortgage pool and the funding portfolios to match at any decision point, we computed duration and convexity hedged <b>funding</b> <b>strategies</b> and compared them with those from the multi-stage stochastic programming model without duration and convexity constraints. The out-of-sample results for the different data assumptions demonstrate that multi-stage stochastic programming yields significantly larger net present values at the same or at {{a lower level of}} risk compared with single-stage optimization and with duration and convexity hedging. We found that the <b>funding</b> <b>strategies</b> obtained from the multi-stage model differed significantly from those from the single-stage model and were again significantly different to <b>funding</b> <b>strategies</b> obtained from duration and convexity hedging. Using multi-stage stochastic programming for determining the best funding of mortgage pools will lead, in the average, to significantly higher profits compared with using single-stage <b>funding</b> <b>strategies,</b> or using duration and convexity hedging. An efficient method for the out-of-sample evaluation of strategies obtained from multi-stage stochastic programming models is presented. Stochastic programming, Funding, Mortgage pools,...|$|R
