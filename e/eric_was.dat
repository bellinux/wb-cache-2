5|$|According to {{contemporary}} Frankish scholar and courtier Einhard, <b>Eric</b> <b>was</b> killed at Trsat (Tarsatch), a {{town on the}} coast of Liburnia by the treachery of the inhabitants. Due to a lack of primary materials, it is uncertain who killed Duke Eric. Most of historians point at Croats, while some point at Byzantines. Einhard also notes the death of Gerold, Prefect of Bavaria, another Frankish commander who was slain in Pannonia in the same year. Croatian historian Nenad Labus refers to this event as a successful assassination attempt by Avars and Slavs. Historian Pierre Riché believes that Dalmatian Croats (Guduscani) killed Eric in collusion with Avars.|$|E

In the autumn of 799, Eric marched from Istria along the seacoast of Liburnia towards the town of Trsat, which is today {{part of the city}} of Rijeka. Meanwhile his opponent, duke Višeslav, gathered his forces and moved north from his governing center at Nin.|$|E

5|$|Peggy married Eric Mitchell {{because she}} was {{pregnant}} with Phil (Steve McFadden). Eric, a keen boxer, worked for gangster Johnny Allen (Billy Murray). Johnny would taunt Eric, making him do demeaning jobs because <b>Eric</b> <b>was</b> a better boxer than him. Eric {{fell in love with a}} woman called Maureen and planned to elope with her, but changed his mind, unable to desert his family, who he grew to resent. Eric took his anger out on Peggy and was often violent towards her and Phil. The abuse eventually ended when Peggy told the police that <b>Eric</b> <b>was</b> involved in a Post Office robbery and he was sent to prison. Peggy considered leaving when her sons, Phil and Grant (Ross Kemp) were teenagers, and once even tried to seduce Johnny, but he turned her down. Eric cheated on Peggy with Claudette Hubbard (Ellen Thomas), who he also intended to run away with, but changed his mind, leading to Claudette hating the entire family. Peggy turned to Eric's younger brother Archie (Larry Lamb) because he was there for her when Eric began to abuse her. She tried to save her marriage by having another child in 1975 - her only daughter Samantha (Danniella Westbrook and Kim Medcalf). Her relationship with Eric improved, but only temporarily, and when Kevin Masters (Colin McCormack) employed Peggy to work at his minicab firm, they began a secret affair. When Eric developed cancer, Peggy gave up work to care for him, but Kevin returned promptly after Eric's death in 1985 and Peggy's children took against him.|$|E

5|$|Eric and Leslie Ludy {{met when}} <b>Eric</b> <b>was</b> 21 and Leslie was 16. They pursued a {{friendship}} {{for several months}} before starting to court, and married in December 1994, the same month that Eric turned 24. In When God Writes Your Love Story, the Ludys advise single people not to be physically or emotionally intimate with others, but {{to wait for the}} life partner that God has planned for them; the Ludys suggest that one should marry this person rather than independently choosing a mate. Also focusing on premarital physical and emotional purity, the authors do not discuss the physical processes of sexual activity. Like many other Christian books about premarital romantic relationships, the Ludys' book explicitly does not present a set of rules to follow or a strategy for romantic success, but rather gives readers a framework for pursuing Christian romantic relationships; the book is intended to be a tool {{in the creation of the}} reader's unique romantic relationship rather than as a blueprint explaining what all Christian romantic relationships are supposed to look like.|$|E
