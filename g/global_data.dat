25|$|Methane Sensor for Mars (MSM) – will measure methane in the {{atmosphere}} of Mars, if any, and map its sources. MSM is designed to measure methane (CH4) in the Martian atmosphere with parts-per-billion (ppb) accuracy and map its sources.

Hence, <b>global</b> <b>data</b> are collected during every orbit. Since {{the field of view}} of MSM is limited, scanning is essential.

[...] Despite improvements in track forecasting, predictions of the intensity of a tropical cyclone based on numerical weather prediction continue to be a challenge, since statiscal methods continue to show higher skill over dynamical guidance. Other than the specialized guidance, global guidance such as the GFS, Unified Model (UKMET), NOGAPS, Japanese Global Spectral Model (GSM), European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts model, France's Action de Recherche Petite Echelle Grande Echelle (ARPEGE) and Aire Limit´ee Adaptation Dynamique Initialisation (ALADIN) models, India's National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMWRF) model, Korea's <b>Global</b> <b>Data</b> Assimilation and Prediction System (GDAPS) and Regional Data Assimilation and Prediction System (RDAPS) models, Hong Kong/China's Operational Regional Spectral Model (ORSM) model, and Canadian Global Environmental Multiscale Model (GEM) model are used for track and intensity purposes.|$|E
