40|$|International audienceAn {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} {{to examine the effects}} of feeding Fusarium toxin contaminated wheat (8. 21 mg deoxynivalenol, <b>DON,</b> and 0. 09 mg zearalenone, (ZON), per kg dry matter, DM) at different feed intake levels on biotransformation and carry over of <b>DON</b> in dairy cows. For this purpose, fourteen ruminal and duodenal fistulated dairy cows were fed a diet containing 60 % concentrate with a wheat portion of 55 % (Fusarium toxin contaminated wheat [mycotoxin period] or control wheat [control period]) and ration was completed with maize- and grass silage (50 : 50) on a DM basis. Daily <b>DON</b> intakes ranged from 16. 6 up to 75. 6 mg in the mycotoxin period at DM intakes of 5. 6 up to 20. 5 kg. <b>DON</b> was almost completely biotransformed to de-epoxy <b>DON</b> (94 - 99 %) independent of the DON/feed intake, and the flow of <b>DON</b> and de-epoxy <b>DON</b> at the duodenum related to <b>DON</b> intake ranged between 12 and 77 % when the Fusarium toxin contaminated wheat was fed. In the serum samples, de-epoxy <b>DON</b> was detected in the range of 4 up to 28 ng/ml in the mycotoxin period, while concentrations of <b>DON</b> were all below the detection limit. The daily excretion of <b>DON</b> and de-epoxy <b>DON</b> in the milk of cows fed the contaminated wheat varied between 1 and 10 µg and 14 and 104 µg, respectively. The total carry over rates as the ratio between daily excretion of <b>DON</b> and de-epoxy <b>DON</b> into milk and <b>DON</b> intake were in the range of 0. 0001 up to 0. 0002 and 0. 0004 up to 0. 0024, respectively. Total carry over rates of <b>DON</b> as <b>DON</b> and de-epoxy <b>DON</b> into the milk increased significantly with increasing milk yield. In the urine samples, de-epoxy <b>DON</b> was the predominant substance as compared to <b>DON</b> with a portion of the total <b>DON</b> plus de-epoxy <b>DON</b> concentration up to 96 % when the Fusarium toxin contaminated wheat was fed, whereas the total residues of <b>DON</b> plus de-epoxy <b>DON</b> in faeces ranged between 2 and 18 % of <b>DON</b> intake in the mycotoxin period. The degree of glucuronidation of de-epoxy <b>DON</b> was found to be approximately 100 % in serum.

5|$|Before the {{initiation}} proper, Lucius must undergo {{a series of}} ritual purifications. The priest bathes him, asks the gods for forgiveness on his behalf, and sprinkles him with water.

Lucius next has to wait ten days, while abstaining from meat and wine, before {{the initiation}} begins. Purifying baths were common in many rituals across the Greco-Roman world. The plea for forgiveness, however, may derive from the oaths that Egyptian priests were required to take, in which they declared themselves to be free of wrongdoing. The sprinkling with water and the refraining from certain foods probably come from the purification rituals that those priests had to undergo before entering a temple.

40|$|In {{addition}} to <b>DON,</b> cereals are often co-contaminated with modified forms of <b>DON,</b> such as deoxynivalenol- 3 -β-D-glucoside (<b>DON</b> 3 G), 3 -acetyl-deoxynivalenol (3 ADON) or 15 -acetyl-deoxynivalenol (15 ADON). Due {{to the lack}} of information on toxicity and bioavailability of modified mycotoxins, current risk assessment assumes that these modified forms are equally toxic to their respective unmodified counterparts. The goal of the in vitro {{study was to determine the}} intrinsic cytotoxicity of modified <b>DON</b> forms towards porcine intestinal epithelial cells by means of a flow cytometric technique. Quantification of viable cells, apoptotic and necrotic cells indicate following toxicity ranking: <b>DON</b> 3 G << 3 ADON < <b>DON</b> ≈ 15 ADON. For the in vivo part, cross-over animal trials were performed with intravenous and oral administration of <b>DON</b> 3 G and <b>DON</b> to broiler chickens and pigs. Systemic and portal plasma concentrations of <b>DON</b> and <b>DON</b> 3 G were quantified using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry was used to unravel phase II metabolism of <b>DON.</b> Data were processed via tailor-made compartmental toxicokinetic models. The results in broiler chickens indicate that <b>DON</b> 3 G is not hydrolysed to <b>DON</b> in vivo. Furthermore, the absolute oral bioavailability of <b>DON</b> 3 G in broiler chickens was low (3. 79 ± 2. 68 %) and comparable to that of <b>DON</b> (5. 56 ± 2. 05 %). After oral <b>DON</b> 3 G administration to pigs, only <b>DON</b> was detected in plasma, indicating a complete presystemic hydrolysis.

Additionally, analysis of phase II metabolites revealed that biotransformation of <b>DON</b> in pigs mainly consists of limited glucuronidation, whereas in chickens extensive conjugation with sulfate occurs, these observations might explain the differences in sensitivity of these species to <b>DON.</b> Although in vitro studies demonstrate a decreased toxicity of <b>DON</b> 3 G compared to <b>DON,</b> the species dependent toxicokinetic data and in vivo hydrolysis to <b>DON</b> illustrate the toxicological relevance of <b>DON</b> 3 G...|$|R
