5|$|As Speaker, Hastert shepherded the USA Patriot Act in October 2001 to {{passage in}} the <b>House</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> 357-66 vote.

5|$|Born in Huyton, Merseyside, Barton is {{the oldest}} of four brothers. His parents {{separated}} when he was 14 years old and consequently {{he lived with his}} father at his grandmother's <b>house</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> different estate. He has said that his grandmother's influence helped him to avoid getting caught up in a recreational drug culture and attributes his work ethic to his father. His father, also named Joseph, worked as a roofer and played football semi-professionally for Northwich Victoria. Barton enjoyed physical education at his school, St Thomas Becket, which he represented in various sports and was a talented rugby league prospect. He left school with ten GCSEs.|$|E
5|$|Collier was {{diagnosed}} with prostate cancer in 1976 and retired to a <b>house</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> lake in Texas, where he played golf and visited with friends and family.

5|$|Maxie sends his henchmen after Danny. Shark {{and another}} gang member trap {{him in an}} alley. Danny knocks out one of his pursuers. Then Shark stabs Danny, but kills himself in the struggle. Ronnie then finds a profusely {{bleeding}} Danny and takes him to her <b>house</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> bayou to recover. She asks him to forget her sordid past and pretend to love her. Danny replies {{that it would not}} be difficult and kisses her. Maxie drives up, accompanied by Dummy (Jack Grinnage), a member of Danny's former gang. Maxie fatally shoots Ronnie. Dummy, who had been befriended by Danny, grapples with Maxie; the gun goes off, killing its owner.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} part of {{the castle}} comprised a modest hall <b>house,</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> site overlooking the Dour Burn. Over the next 400 years, the castle was successively expanded according to contemporary architectural ideas. The hall house became a tower house in the 15th century, and was extended twice in the 16th century. The final addition was made around 1635, with refined Renaissance details, and the whole was complemented by a walled garden {{to the east and}} terraced gardens to the south. The terraces, dating from the mid-16th century, form one of the oldest gardens in Scotland, and offer extensive views across the Firth of Forth to Edinburgh.|$|E
5|$|The lakes were {{deliberately}} {{designed so}} that their orientation was related to various topographical landmarks in Canberra. The lakes stretched {{from east to west}} and divided the city in two; a land axis perpendicular to the central basin stretched from Capital Hill—the future location of the new Parliament <b>House</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> mound on the southern side—north northeast across the central basin to the northern banks along Anzac Parade to the Australian War Memorial (although a casino was originally planned in its place). This was {{designed so that}} looking from Capital Hill, the War Memorial stood directly at the foot of Mount Ainslie. At the southwestern end of the land axis was Bimberi Peak.|$|E
5|$|An avid golfer {{and tennis}} player, Graham partnered with New York Yankees great Joe DiMaggio in {{numerous}} golf tournaments later in life. He retired to a <b>house</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> {{golf course in}} Florida. Graham overcame colon cancer in 1977, but was later plagued by heart ailments and other health problems. He was diagnosed as being {{in the early stages}} of Alzheimer's disease in 2001, and died of a heart aneurysm in Sarasota, Florida, on December 17, 2003. He had two sons and a daughter with his wife Beverly. In 2013, Northwestern's fundraising department created The Otto Graham Society to honor his achievements at the school and support its athletics programs. In 2014, a new gymnasium at Waterford Country School was dedicated to Otto Graham's memory.|$|E

5|$|Early {{concepts}} {{were very}} different from the final film. The initial version featured a floating castle with two brothers vying to inherit their father's kingdom, and when the brothers fell to Earth, they encountered a tall bird who helped them understand each other. Docter's next idea introduced many of the elements that eventually made their way into the film, but had Carl and Russell landing the <b>house</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Soviet-era spy airship camouflaged as a giant cloud rather than on a tepui. This concept was rewritten due to its similarity to another idea Pixar was developing. Another idea Docter added, then removed, was magic fountain-of-youth eggs laid by the bird, in order to explain the age discrepancy between Muntz and Carl, but it was decided that this subplot was too distracting, and that people would forgive the minor inconsistency.|$|E
5|$|Mengele and the Stammers {{bought a}} <b>house</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> farm in Caieiras in 1969, with Mengele as half owner. When Wolfgang Gerhard {{returned}} to Germany in 1971 to {{seek medical treatment}} for his seriously ill wife and son, he gave his identity card to Mengele. The Stammers had a falling out with Mengele in late 1974 and {{bought a house in}} São Paulo; Mengele was not invited. The Stammers bought a bungalow in the Eldorado neighbourhood of São Paulo, which they rented out to Mengele. Rolf, who had not seen his father since the ski holiday in 1956, visited him there in 1977 and found an unrepentant Nazi who claimed he had never personally harmed anyone and had only done his duty.|$|E
5|$|The other {{remaining}} 1870s concrete {{building is}} the gate house, located {{some distance away}} on the Rakaia Barrhill Methven Road. Wason's homestead {{was at the end}} of a drive starting at this gate <b>house,</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> cliff top overlooking the Rakaia River. The homestead burnt down not long after Wason had left the country, and a new homestead was built nearby. The gatekeeper's lodge originally had a slate roof, but this was later replaced by iron. The last family moved out in 1935. During the second world war, the iron was stripped off the empty building, and it fell into ruin. A later owner, Colin McLachlan, donated the land and the ruin to the people of the district; it is now vested in the Ashburton District Council. The renovation began in 1970, with work carried out and financed by descendants of previous inhabitants of the building. A plaque on the building states that it was reopened in March 1979 by the Prime Minister of the time, Robert Muldoon, but his plane ran late and the opening ceremony was conducted by Colin McLachlan. The gate house is fitted out as a museum, and viewing can be arranged through the Ashburton or Methven information centres.|$|E

5|$|The {{story begins}} as a girl named Sally and her unnamed brother, who serves as the narrator of the book, sit alone in their <b>house</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> cold, rainy day, staring wistfully out the window. Then they hear a loud bump which is quickly {{followed}} {{by the arrival of}} the Cat in the Hat, a tall anthropomorphic cat in a red and white striped hat and a red bow tie. The Cat proposes to entertain the children with some tricks that he knows. The children's pet fish refuses, insisting that the Cat leave. The Cat responds by balancing the fish on the tip of his umbrella. The game quickly becomes more complicated, as the Cat balances himself on a ball and tries to balance lots of household items on his limbs until he falls on his head, dropping everything he was holding. The fish admonishes him again, but the Cat in the Hat just proposes another game.|$|E
25|$|Although he {{kept his}} {{chambers}} in Hartford, Connecticut, the state capital, {{he lived in the}} rural small town of Danielson in a Colonial-style <b>house</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> 220-acre farm, making the 104-mile round trip almost every workday.
