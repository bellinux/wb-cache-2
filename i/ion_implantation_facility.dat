50|$|In steels, the 54Fe(n,α)51Cr and 54Fe(n,p)54Mn {{reactions}} {{are responsible for}} most of the protons and α-particles produced, and these have an incident neutron energy threshold at 0.9 MeV and 2.9 MeV respectively. Therefore, conventional fast fission reactors, which produce neutrons with an average energy around 1-2 MeV, cannot adequately match the testing requirements for fusion materials. In fact the leading factor for embrittlement, the generation of α-particles by transmutation, is far from realistic conditions (actually around 0.3 appm He/dpa). Spallation neutron sources provide a wide spectrum of energies up to the order of hundreds of MeV leading to potentially different defect structures, and generating light transmuted nuclei that intrinsically affect the targeted properties of the alloy. <b>Ion</b> <b>implantation</b> <b>facilities</b> offer insufficient irradiation volume (maximum values of a few hundreds µm layer thickness) for standardized mechanical property tests.

30|$|With {{the advent}} of modern times, higher {{performance}} devices are desired. In order to get more high-performance devices, the pivotal problem is how to get better quality materials. Generally, we dope some impurities into the materials as a solution. Traditional doping methods can be roughly divided into three classes: doping during growth, doping by diffusion, and <b>ion</b> <b>implantation.</b> Doping with few impurities into one-dimensional nanomaterials has been achieved already, but controllable and reproducible doping is still difficult to be achieved during growth. <b>Ion</b> <b>implantation</b> is an advanced technique that has been widely applied in material surface modification for nearly 30 years. As a method for industrial application, <b>ion</b> <b>implantation</b> is a controllable and rather exact manner. Compared with conventional doping method, the prominent advantage of <b>ion</b> <b>implantation</b> is that almost all elements {{can be used for}} implantation and it never draws into any other impurity elements. Lately, focus ion beam (FIB) system has been used to perform <b>ion</b> <b>implantation</b> process [7, 8]. In this method, the position of <b>ion</b> <b>implantation</b> becomes steerable. In this letter, we review literatures on the application of <b>ion</b> <b>implantation</b> on one-dimensional nanomaterials. Finally, we report on our work on the photoluminescence (PL) emission property of single CdS nanobelt implanted by N+ ions. CdS nanobelts have been marked by Au markers. Furthermore, the PL emission spectrum of every marked CdS nanobelts has been recorded before <b>ion</b> <b>implantation.</b> The experiment was designed to study the PL emission variation of the same CdS nanobelt after <b>ion</b> <b>implantation.</b>|$|R

30|$|Many growth {{methods have}} been used to {{fabricate}} nanowires; with the development of technology, growth methods become outmoded, and various kinds of nanomaterials are developed. These nanomaterials have been applied in fabricating high-performance electronic or optical devices. With the purpose of getting higher performance devices, various elements were doped into the nanomaterials. Nevertheless, doping is not effortless; p-type doping of certain materials, such as CdS and ZnO, are rather knotty. Obviously, <b>ion</b> <b>implantation</b> is the most accurate and controllable method for doping, and theoretically, <b>ion</b> <b>implantation</b> can be appropriate for almost all the elements. We need not consider solubility limits and never fear to introduce impurity elements. After <b>ion</b> <b>implantation,</b> the electrical conductivity of nanowires can be increased by several orders of magnitude. The p-n junctions can be created in vertically grown nanowires after <b>ion</b> <b>implantation.</b> <b>Ion</b> <b>implantation</b> has also been utilized to fabricate nanoscale electrical devices. Implanted nanowires show a different optical characteristic compared to the as-grown nanowires. After <b>ion</b> <b>implantation,</b> the luminescence spectrum of the nanowires may be broadened and the bandgap will be changed. These properties changed by <b>ion</b> <b>implantation</b> are important in fabricating optical devices. Research on diluted magnetic semiconductor nanowires {{still has a long way}} to explore.
