5|$|Galiella rufa {{produces}} several structurally related hexaketide {{compounds that}} have attracted attention for their biological properties: pregaliellalactone, galiellalactone. The compounds have anti-nematodal activity, killing the nematodes Caenorhabditis elegans and Meloidogyne incognita. These compounds {{have been shown}} in laboratory tests to inhibit the early steps of the biosynthetic pathways induced by plant hormones known as gibberellic acids, and they also inhibit the germination of seeds of several plants. Galiellalactone is additionally a highly selective and potent inhibitor of interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling in HepG2 cells. IL-6 is a multifunctional cytokine which is produced by a large variety of cells and functions as a regulator of immune response, acute phase reactions, and <b>hematopoiesis.</b> Researchers {{are interested in the}} potential of small-molecule inhibitors (such as the ones produced by G.rufa) to interfere with the IL-6 signaling cascade that leads to the expression of genes involved in disease.|$|E
25|$|The {{features}} generally used {{to define}} a MDS are blood cytopenias, ineffective <b>hematopoiesis,</b> dyserythropoiesis, dysgranulopoiesis, dysmegakaropoiesis, and increased myeloblasts.|$|E
25|$|One {{mechanism}} by which this is possible involves cytokine-mediated suppression of T-cells. MHC crosslinking also activates a signaling pathway that suppresses <b>hematopoiesis</b> and upregulates Fas-mediated apoptosis.|$|E
25|$|Creation of {{red blood}} cells. While {{the bone marrow}} is the primary site of <b>hematopoiesis</b> in the adult, the spleen has {{important}} hematopoietic functions up until the fifth month of gestation. After birth, erythropoietic functions cease, except in some hematologic disorders. As a major lymphoid organ and a central player in the reticuloendothelial system, the spleen retains the ability to produce lymphocytes and, as such, remains a hematopoietic organ.|$|E
25|$|In mammals, {{prolactin}} {{is associated}} with milk production; in fish it {{is thought to be}} related to control of water and salt balance. Prolactin also acts in a cytokine-like manner and as an important regulator of the immune system. It has important cell cycle-related functions as a growth-, differentiating- and anti-apoptotic factor. As a growth factor, binding to cytokine-like receptors, it influences <b>hematopoiesis,</b> angiogenesis and is involved in the regulation of blood clotting through several pathways. The hormone acts in endocrine, autocrine and paracrine manner through the prolactin receptor and a large number of cytokine receptors.|$|E
25|$|The cancellous part {{of bones}} contain bone marrow. Bone marrow {{produces}} blood cells {{in a process}} called <b>hematopoiesis.</b> Blood cells that are created in bone marrow include red blood cells, platelets and white blood cells. Progenitor cells such as the hematopoietic stem cell divide in a process called mitosis to produce precursor cells. These include precursors which eventually give rise to white blood cells, and erythroblasts which give rise to red blood cells. Unlike red and white blood cells, created by mitosis, platelets are shed from very large cells called megakaryocytes. This process of progressive differentiation occurs within the bone marrow. After the cells are matured, they enter the circulation. Every day, over 2.5 billion red blood cells and platelets, and 50–100 billion granulocytes are produced in this way.|$|E
25|$|Tissue-specific {{stem cells}} produce {{differentiated}} cells {{through a series}} of increasingly more committed progenitor intermediates. In <b>hematopoiesis</b> (blood cell formation), the process begins with long-term hematopoietic stem cells that self-renew and also produce progeny cells that upon further replication go {{through a series of}} stages leading to differentiated cells without self-renewal capacity. In mice, deficiencies in DNA repair appear to limit the capacity of hematopoietic stem cells to proliferate and self-renew with age. Sharpless and Depinho reviewed evidence that hematopoietic stem cells, as well as stem cells in other tissues, undergo intrinsic aging. They speculated that stem cells grow old, in part, as a result of DNA damage. DNA damage may trigger signalling pathways, such as apoptosis, that contribute to depletion of stem cell stocks. This has been observed in several cases of accelerated aging and may occur in normal aging too.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} evolution, the oldest {{physiological}} role of Ahr is in development. Ahr {{is presumed to}} have evolved from invertebrates where it served a ligand-independent role in normal development processes. The Ahr homolog in Drosophila, spineless (ss) is necessary for development of the distal segments of the antenna and leg. Ss dimerizes with tango (tgo), which is the homolog to the mammalian Arnt, to initiate gene transcription. Evolution of the receptor in vertebrates resulted {{in the ability to}} bind ligand and might have helped humans evolve to tolerate smoke of fires. In developing vertebrates, Ahr seemingly plays a role in cellular proliferation and differentiation. Despite lacking a clear endogenous ligand, AHR appears {{to play a role in}} the differentiation of many developmental pathways, including <b>hematopoiesis,</b> lymphoid systems, T-cells, neurons, and hepatocytes. AhR has also been found to have an important function in hematopoietic stem cells: AhR antagonism promotes their self-renewal and ex-vivo expansion and is involved in megakaryocyte differentiation.|$|E
25|$|The {{first use}} of small-molecule drugs to treat cancer {{was in the early}} 20th century, {{although}} the specific chemicals first used were not originally intended for that purpose. Mustard gas was used as a chemical warfare agent during World War I and was discovered to be a potent suppressor of <b>hematopoiesis</b> (blood production). A similar family of compounds known as nitrogen mustards were studied further during World War II at the Yale School of Medicine. It was reasoned that an agent that damaged the rapidly growing white blood cells might have a similar effect on cancer. Therefore, in December 1942, several patients with advanced lymphomas (cancers of the lymphatic system and lymph nodes) were given the drug by vein, rather than by breathing the irritating gas. Their improvement, although temporary, was remarkable. Concurrently, during a military operation in World War II, following a German air raid on the Italian harbour of Bari, several hundred people were accidentally exposed to mustard gas, which had been transported there by the Allied forces to prepare for possible retaliation in the event of German use of chemical warfare. The survivors were later found to have very low white blood cell counts. After WWII was over and the reports declassified, the experiences converged and led researchers to look for other substances that might have similar effects against cancer. The first chemotherapy drug to be developed from this line of research was mustine. Since then, many other drugs have been developed to treat cancer, and drug development has exploded into a multibillion-dollar industry, although the principles and limitations of chemotherapy discovered by the early researchers still apply.|$|E

"Preleukemic" [...] blood disorders, such as myelodysplastic {{syndrome}} (MDS) or {{myeloproliferative disease}} (MPS), can evolve into AML; the exact risk {{depends on the}} type of MDS/MPS. The presence of asymptomatic clonal <b>hematopoiesis</b> also raises the risk of transformation into AML to 0.5-1.0% per year.|$|E
500|$|The {{malignant}} cell in AML is the myeloblast. In normal <b>hematopoiesis,</b> the myeloblast is an immature precursor of myeloid white blood cells; a normal myeloblast will gradually mature into a mature white blood cell. In AML, though, a single myeloblast accumulates genetic changes which [...] "freeze" [...] the cell in its immature state and prevent differentiation. Such a mutation {{alone does not}} cause leukemia; however, when such a [...] "differentiation arrest" [...] is combined with other mutations which disrupt genes controlling proliferation, {{the result is the}} uncontrolled growth of an immature clone of cells, leading to the clinical entity of AML.|$|E
2500|$|Haematopoiesis (from Greek αἷμα, [...] "blood" [...] and ποιεῖν [...] "to make"; also <b>hematopoiesis</b> in American English; {{sometimes}} also haemopoiesis or hemopoiesis) is {{the formation}} of blood cellular components. All cellular blood components are derived from haematopoietic stem cells. In a healthy adult person, approximately 1011–1012 new blood cells are produced daily {{in order to maintain}} steady state levels in the peripheral circulation.|$|E
2500|$|Up to {{the fifth}} month of [...] {{prenatal}} development the spleen creates red blood cells. After birth the bone marrow is solely responsible for <b>hematopoiesis.</b> As a major lymphoid organ and a central player in the reticuloendothelial system, the spleen retains the ability to produce lymphocytes. The spleen stores red blood cells and lymphocytes. It can store enough blood cells to help in an emergency. Up to 25% of lymphocytes can be stored at any one time.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Hematopoiesis</b> {{is defined}} as the {{formation}} and development of blood cells, all of which are derived from hematopoietic stem-progenitor cells (HSPCs). [...] HSPCs are primitive cells capable of self-renewal and initially differentiate into common myeloid progenitor (CMP) or common lymphoid progenitor (CLP) cells. [...] CMPs represent the cellular population that has become myeloid lineage and it is the point that myelopoeisis begins. [...] During myelopoeisis further cellular differentiation takes place including thrombopoiesis, erythropoeisis, granulopoeisis, and [...] monocytopoeisis. [...] CLPs subsequently differentiate into B-cells and T-cells in a process designated lymphopoiesis. [...] Given that miR-155-5p is expressed in hematopoietic cells it was hypothesized that this miRNA plays a critical role in these cellular differentiation processes. [...] In support of this premise, miR-155-5p was found to be expressed in CD34(+) human HSPCs, and it was speculated that this miRNA may hold these cells at an early stem-progenitor stage, inhibiting their differentiation into a more mature cell (i.e. megakaryocytic/erythroid/granulocytic/monocytic/B-lymphoid/T-lymphoid). [...] This hypothesis was substantiated when pre-mir-155 transduced HSPCs generated 5-fold fewer myeloid and 3-fold fewer erythroid colonies. [...] Additionally, Hu et al. demonstrated that the homeobox protein, HOXA9, regulated MIR155HG expression in myeloid cells and that this miRNA played a functional role in <b>hematopoiesis.</b> [...] These investigators found that forced expression of miR-155-5p in bone marrow cells resulted in a ~50% decrease in SPI1 (i.e. PU.1), a transcription factor and a regulator of myelopoiesis, and a validated target of this miRNA. [...] It was also established that in vitro differentiation of purified human erythroid progenitor cells resulted in a progressive decrease of miR-155-5p expression in mature red cells. [...] Additionally, mice deficient in pre-mir-155 showed clear defects in lymphocyte development and generation of B- and T-cell responses in vivo. [...] Finally, it was established that regulatory T-cell (Tregs) development required miR-155-5p and this miRNA was shown {{to play a role in}} Treg homeostasis and overall survival by directly targeting SOCS1, a negative regulator for IL-2 signaling. [...] Taken together, these results strongly suggest that miR-155-5p is an essential molecule in the control of several aspects of <b>hematopoiesis</b> including myelopoiesis, erythropoiesis, and lymphopoiesis.|$|E
2500|$|Paracrine {{signaling}} {{of growth}} factors between nearby cells {{has been shown}} to exacerbate carcinogenesis. [...] In fact, mutant forms of a single RTK may play a causal role in very different types of cancer. [...] The Kit proto-oncogene encodes a tyrosine kinase receptor whose ligand is a paracrine protein called stem cell factor (SCF), which is important in <b>hematopoiesis</b> (formation of cells in blood). [...] The Kit receptor and related tyrosine kinase receptors actually are inhibitory and effectively suppresses receptor firing. [...] Mutant forms of the Kit receptor, which fire constitutively in a ligand-independent fashion, are found in a diverse array of cancerous malignancies.|$|E
2500|$|Northern blot {{analysis}} {{found that}} miR-155 pri-miRNA was abundantly {{expressed in the}} human spleen and thymus and detectable in the liver, lung, and kidney. Subsequently, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) experiments demonstrated that miR-155-5p was detectable in all human tissues investigated. Sequence analysis of small RNA clone libraries comparing miRNA expression to all other organ systems examined established that miR-155-5p was one of five miRNAs (i.e. miR-142, miR-144, miR-150, miR-155, and miR-223) that was specific for hematopoietic cells including B-cells, T-cells, monocytes and granulocytes. [...] Together {{these results suggest that}} miR-155-5p is expressed in a number of tissues and cell types and, therefore, may {{play a critical role in}} a wide variety of biological processes, including <b>hematopoiesis</b> ...|$|E
2500|$|Bone marrow is the {{flexible}} {{tissue in the}} interior of bones. In humans, red blood cells are produced by cores of bone marrow in the heads of long bones in a process known as <b>hematopoiesis.</b> On average, bone marrow constitutes 4% of the total body mass of humans; in an adult having 65 kilograms of mass (143 lb), bone marrow typically accounts for approximately [...] The hematopoietic component of bone marrow produces approximately 500 billion blood cells per day, which use the bone marrow vasculature as a conduit to the body's systemic circulation. Bone marrow is also a key component of the lymphatic system, producing the lymphocytes that support the body's immune system. In addition to hematopoietic cells, the marrow is composed of marrow adipose tissue as well as trabecular bone. The interplay between these different cell types and the local factors they produce can have an effect on hematopoietic cells within the hematopoietic stem cell niche.|$|E
2500|$|Two {{models for}} <b>hematopoiesis</b> have been proposed: {{determinism}} and stochastic theory. For {{the stem cells}} and other undifferentiated blood cells in the bone marrow, the determination is generally explained by the determinism theory of haematopoiesis, saying that colony stimulating factors and other factors of the haematopoietic microenvironment determine the cells to follow a certain path of cell differentiation. This is the classical way of describing haematopoiesis. In stochastic theory, undifferentiated blood cells differentiate to specific cell types by randomness. This theory has been supported by experiments showing that within a population of mouse haematopoietic progenitor cells, underlying stochastic variability {{in the distribution of}} Sca-1, a stem cell factor, subdivides the population into groups exhibiting variable rates of cellular differentiation. For example, under the influence of erythropoietin (an erythrocyte-differentiation factor), a subpopulation of cells (as defined by the levels of Sca-1) differentiated into erythrocytes at a sevenfold higher rate {{than the rest of the}} population. [...] Furthermore, it was shown that if allowed to grow, this subpopulation re-established the original subpopulation of cells, supporting the theory that this is a stochastic, reversible process. Another level at which stochasticity may be important is in the process of apoptosis and self-renewal. In this case, the haematopoietic microenvironment prevails upon some of the cells to survive and some, on the other hand, to perform apoptosis and die. By regulating this balance between different cell types, the bone marrow can alter the quantity of different cells to ultimately be produced.|$|E

50|$|The {{combination}} of these two ideas, that clonal <b>hematopoiesis</b> might be common in the elderly population and that AML evolves from pre-leukemic populations, led to the hypothesis that malignancy-associated mutations could also contribute to asymptomatic clonal <b>hematopoiesis</b> in healthy individuals. This view gained mechanistic support in 2012 when it was found {{a number of the}} women who showed evidence for clonal <b>hematopoiesis</b> through X-inactivation skew also had mutations in the hematologic-malignancy-associated gene TET2.|$|E
5000|$|Clonal <b>hematopoiesis</b> is {{a common}} aging-related {{phenomenon}} in which hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) or other early blood cell progenitors contribute {{to the formation of}} a genetically distinct subpopulation of blood cells. As the name suggests, this subpopulation in the blood is characterized by a shared unique mutation in the cells' DNA; it is thought that this subpopulation is [...] "clonally" [...] derived from a single founding cell and is therefore made of genetic [...] "clones" [...] of the founder. The establishment of a clonal population may occur when a stem or progenitor cell acquires one or more somatic mutations that give it a competitive advantage in <b>hematopoiesis</b> over the stem/progenitor cells without these mutations. Alternatively, clonal <b>hematopoiesis</b> may arise without a driving mutation, through mechanisms such as neutral drift in the stem cell population. Clonal <b>hematopoiesis</b> may occur in people who are completely healthy but has also been found in people with hematologic diseases. The clonal population may vary in size depending on the person, where it can be less than 2% of the blood or, at the other end, can sometimes grow close to 100%. The incidence of clonal <b>hematopoiesis</b> has been found to rise dramatically with age. Recent studies have demonstrated that less than 1% of the population under age 40 but approximately 10-20% of the population over age 70 has observable clonal <b>hematopoiesis.</b> Having clonal <b>hematopoiesis</b> has been linked to a more than 10-fold increased risk of developing a blood cancer, though the overall likelihood is still low. Clonal <b>hematopoiesis</b> does not typically give rise to noticeable symptoms, but does lead to increased risk of cardiovascular disease.|$|E

50|$|Duffy antigen plays a {{fundamental}} role on <b>hematopoiesis.</b> Indeed, nucleated {{red blood cells}} present in the bone marrow have high expression of DARC, which facilitates their direct contact with hematopoietic stem cells. The absence of erythroid DARC alters <b>hematopoiesis</b> including stem and progenitor cells, which ultimately gives rise to phenotypically distinct neutrophils. As a result, mature neutrophils of Duffy-negative individuals carry more molecular “weapons” against infectious pathogens. Therefore, alternative physiological patterns of <b>hematopoiesis</b> and bone marrow cell outputs depend on the expression of DARC in the erythroid lineage.|$|E
50|$|There is also limited {{evidence}} suggesting clonal <b>hematopoiesis</b> may be ubiquitous in healthy adults, albeit at extremely low levels (less than 0.1% of peripheral blood cells).
