500|$|In the US and Canada, {{the cover}} {{did not have}} any logo, but in the European nations, they were sold with Madonna's name and album title on the cover. Heiden {{explained}} in an interview with Aperture magazine that they thought it would be [...] "cool" [...] to use a shrink wrap on the US covers, so that when one took it off, there would only be the photo of Madonna. For the European nations, Warner felt that the name was needed on the cover, as {{they did not want to}} take chance with Madonna's popularity there. The back sleeve and the booklet inside featured the song titles in Heiden's own handwriting. About cropping the image for the cassette and the vinyl versions, Heiden said: [...] "I think the image became more interesting cropped into a square—and at that time we always started with the album cover configuration. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> was floating—her clothing was not visible. She took on the appearance of a marble statue—Goddess like. In the vertical cropping you see her leather jacket and the wall, and it becomes more typical, editorial, earthly." ...|$|E
60|$|It was scarce {{daylight}} {{when they}} were aroused by a great stir on board the ship, and, hastily putting on their clothes, went on deck. Already a crowd of men were aloft loosening the sails. Others had taken their places in boats in readiness to tow the ship, for the wind was, as yet, so light that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> would scarce have steerage way, {{and there were many}} sharp angles in the course down the river to be rounded, and shallows to be avoided. A few minutes later the moorings were cast off, the sails sheeted home, and the crew gave a great cheer, which was answered from the dockyard, and from boats alongside, full of the relations and friends of the sailors, who stood up and waved their hats and shouted good bye.|$|E
60|$|Jill, {{unconscious}} of {{the discomfort}} she was causing, continued to gaze. She {{was trying to}} discover in just what respect he had changed from the god he had been. Certainly not in looks. He was as handsome as ever--handsomer, indeed, for the sunshine and clean breezes of the Atlantic had given him an exceedingly becoming coat of tan. And yet he must have changed, for now she could look upon him quite dispassionately and criticize him without a tremor. It was like seeing {{a copy of a}} great painting. Everything was there, except the one thing that mattered, the magic and the glamour. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like....</b> <b>She</b> suddenly remembered a scene in the dressing-room when the company had been in Baltimore. Lois Denham, duly the recipient of the sunburst which her friend Izzy had promised her, had unfortunately, in a spirit of girlish curiosity, taken it to a jeweller to be priced, and the jeweller had blasted her young life by declaring it a paste imitation. Jill recalled how the stricken girl--previous to calling Izzy on the long distance and telling him a number of things which, while probably not news to him, must have been painful hearing--had passed the vile object round the dressing-room for inspection. The imitation was perfect. It had been impossible for the girls to tell that the stones were not real diamonds. Yet the jeweller, with his sixth sense, had seen through them in a trifle under ten seconds. Jill {{came to the conclusion that}} her newly-discovered love for Wally Mason had equipped her with a sixth sense, and that by its aid she was really for the first time seeing Derek as he was.|$|E

50|$|Tita {{was born}} on a kitchen table {{and spent most of}} her time with Nacha. She knew the smells of the kitchen and learned how to cook at a young age. In the kitchen Tita is able to connect with Pedro. She states that when she puts all of her passion into her food, and after Pedro eats <b>it,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> {{entering}} his body in a sexual way. That has always been how the two connected. They did not need physical touch, as Tita is an expert in the kitchen and able to make others feel what she feels when she prepares food.|$|R

5000|$|Futami Shouko is a {{high school}} student that {{possesses}} such power that she transcended her physical being. She existed outside of space and time. Even before losing her physical form, Shouko was able to travel in both time and space at will, and she would tell this to her best friend. During her travels, she would go missing for days which her best friend was already used to. So when Shouko went missing again, she thought that Shouko would come back, but her friend was gone, for good. This happened after Shouko learned that Elder Misaki had died. Shouko had foreseen the upcoming [...] "Upheaval" [...] and that the Kirihara brothers would play a pivotal role. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> took the place of Elder Misaki and watched over and guided them. She always appears in her school uniform. Her last transformation was that akin to a butterfly when she could no longer hold her physical body. This greatly saddened Naoya but Shouko promised him that she will continue to watch over them.|$|E

Gordon provided insight into the song in a 2010 interview:I was trying to put myself into Karen's body. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> had so little control over her life, like a teenager—they have so little control over what’s happening to them that one way {{they can get it}} is through what they eat or don’t.
