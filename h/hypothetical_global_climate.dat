Based on emission trends, abatement costs and equilibrium climate sensitivity from IPCC and IEA reports, this quantitative analysis confirms that price caps could significantly reduce economic uncertainty. This uncertainty stems primarily from unpredictable {{economic growth and}} energy prices, and ultimately unabated emission trends. In addition, the development of abatement technologies is uncertain. Furthermore, this analysis shows that rigid targets may entail greater economic risks {{with little or no}} comparative advantage for the climate. More ambitious emission objectives, combined with price caps and price floors, could still entail significantly lower expected costs while driving similar, or even slightly better, climatic outcomes in probabilistic terms...|$|E

However, there are intercultural and intracultural differences in perceptions both of the dimensions of <b>global</b> <b>climate</b> change and the necessity of fighting it. It is assumed that these perceptions depend heavily on the quantity and quality of media coverage and individuals’ media usage. To test how media consumption interacts with sociodemographic variables in affecting perceptions of <b>global</b> <b>climate</b> change, a regional survey was conducted in the southwest of Germany. A representative sample of 753 persons was interviewed face-to-face in February 2008. The study provides differential insights into the relationship between predispositions, media consumption, and orientations towards <b>global</b> <b>climate</b> change. Results show that media effects are relatively small and subordinated to attitudinal predispositions such as interest in climate change and personal concern about it.

40|$|In {{the wake}} of Hurricane Katrina, {{attention}} has focused {{on a pair of}} threats to low-lying coastal areas. Scientists have begun a debate over the possible impact of <b>global</b> <b>climate</b> change on hurricane intensity. Some scientists take the position that recent increases in hurricane intensity in the North Atlantic are due, at least in part, to increases in sea surface temperatures caused by human-induced <b>global</b> <b>climate</b> change. Others believe that those increases are largely due to natural fluctuations in weather patterns such as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. There is little debate over a second threat to coastal areas. The broad consensus of scientific opinion supports the conclusion that <b>global</b> <b>climate</b> change poses a significant risk of accelerated melting of polar ice sheets and glaciers, which in turn increases the risk of coastal flooding. This article surveys the scientific literature on the links between <b>global</b> <b>climate</b> change and the risks of increased hurricane intensity and coastal flooding. It concludes that the scientific evidence of such links is compelling and that environmental and energy policymakers should respond by taking steps to abate the activities - primarily the emission of greenhouse gases - that are known to contribute to <b>global</b> <b>climate</b> change. The article describes a series of policy initiatives that the federal government could take but has not yet taken to contribute to global efforts to abate climate change. It also describes longstanding national environmental and energy policies that exacerbate, rather than alleviate the adverse effects of <b>global</b> <b>climate</b> change on coastal areas. Recent economic studies demonstrate that a comparison of {{the costs and benefits of}} tackling <b>global</b> <b>climate</b> change and failing to do so strongly supports taking immediate steps to address climate change, rather than further deferring such a response. Finally, the article assesses the possible impact of Katrina on the public policy debate over <b>global</b> <b>climate</b> change, and in particular, it focuses on the effects of Katrina on public opinion in the U. S. on government policies relating to <b>global</b> <b>climate</b> change...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{analysis}} {{the problems}} facing the negotiators during their international efforts to create <b>global</b> <b>climate</b> change regimes. Without understanding why such negotiations failed in the past, {{it is difficult to}} learn how to negotiate them successfully in the future. The US and China are responsible for emitting almost half of the greenhouse emissions to the atmosphere. However, they are still laggards in the efforts to create an effective <b>global</b> <b>climate</b> change regime and are running away from their global responsibility by blaming each other for the failure to reach a <b>global</b> <b>climate</b> change deal. The EU has been taking the leadership in efforts to negotiate <b>global</b> <b>climate</b> change regimes. However, they can not influence and force the main two hegemonic powers to follow their leadership. This is because the EU is not hegemony in the global political arena. The EU persistence to find compromises during negotiations for future <b>global</b> <b>climate</b> change regimes is a source of hope to humankind. Flexibility during negotiations, openness to consider the views of other global actors to find optimum solutions, and the understanding that no one is secure from the threats of climate change are essential to bring the world leaders into a compromise <b>global</b> <b>climate</b> chang...|$|R
40|$|The {{reality of}} <b>global</b> <b>climate</b> changes creates the {{necessity}} of predicting how will be the climatic scenario in our planet {{and how it will}} affect the economic activities in the future. For some climatic variables the <b>global</b> <b>climate</b> models projections are similar, {{as in the case of}} temperature. But in the case of rainfall it does not happen, once the <b>global</b> <b>climate</b> models show different projections. This study aims to evaluate the rainfall projections tendency for Brazil and its regions according to <b>global</b> <b>climate</b> models, using GIS Idrisi 32. Fifteen global models were performed to compare the projection of future precipitation (2071 - 2100) of the emission scenario A 2 of the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report with reference period data (1961 - 1990) of the Climate Research Unit (C. R. U). The results showed <b>global</b> <b>climate</b> models behavior differently for each brazilian region, indicating a tendency of rainfall increase in certain geographic areas and decrease in others. During the winter months there is a tendency of rainfall decrease, while during summer the tendency is the increase of rainfall, according to the global models evaluated.

40|$|In {{its attempt}} to address the threat of <b>global</b> <b>climate</b> change, society has {{struggled}} to reach a consensus regarding the need for preventive measures. Professor Rachlinski describes the threat of <b>global</b> <b>climate</b> change as a unique commons dilemma and explains that various psychological phenomena of judgment render it unlikely that society {{will be able to}} respond effectively to the threat. After considering the effects of biased assimilation, loss aversion, and other psychological processes, the author explains that an innovative approach is necessary to properly address the dilemma of <b>global</b> <b>climate</b> change. Specifically, the author examines the prospect of governmental intervention through taxes or regulations as well as the development of collective norms against combustion of fossil fuels. Because the above-mentioned psychological phenomena hinder each of these potential remedies, the author ultimately concludes that the only remedy for the problem of <b>global</b> <b>climate</b> change is an elimination of the commons dilemma itself. The author suggests that by developing alternatives to fossil fuels, the problem of <b>global</b> <b>climate</b> change can be addressed in spite of social and cognitive limitations...|$|R
40|$|There are {{a number}} of sources of {{uncertainty}} in regional climate change scenarios. When statistical downscaling is used to obtain regional climate change scenarios, the uncertainty may originate from the uncertainties in the <b>global</b> <b>climate</b> models used, the skill of the statistical model, and the forcing scenar-ios applied to the <b>global</b> <b>climate</b> model. The uncertainty associated with <b>global</b> <b>climate</b> models can be evaluated by examining the differences in the predictors and in the downscaled climate change scenarios based on a set of different <b>global</b> <b>climate</b> models. When standardized <b>global</b> <b>climate</b> model simulations such as {{the second phase of the}} Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP 2) are used, the difference in the downscaled variables mainly reflects differences in the climate models and the natural variability in the simulated climates. It is proposed that the spread of the estimates can be taken as a measure of the uncertainty associated with <b>global</b> <b>climate</b> models. The proposed method is applied to the estimation of global-climate-model-related uncertainty in regional precipitation change scenarios in Sweden. Results from statistical downscaling based on 17 <b>global</b> <b>climate</b> models show that there is an overall increase in annual precipitation all over Sweden although a considerable spread of the changes in the precipitation exists. The general increase can be attributed to the increased large-scale precipitation and the enhanced westerly wind. The estimated uncertainty is nearly independent of region. However, there is a seasonal dependence. The estimates for winter show the highest level of confidence, while the estimates for summer show the least...|$|R
