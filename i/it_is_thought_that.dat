5|$|If after 2–4days {{there is}} still {{evidence}} of an air leak, various options are available. Negative pressure suction (at low pressures of –10 to –20cmH2O) at a high flow rate may be attempted, particularly in PSP; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> this may accelerate the healing of the leak. Failing this, surgery may be required, especially in SSP.|$|E
