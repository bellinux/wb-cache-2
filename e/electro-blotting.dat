5000|$|Elasayed Elsayed Wagih PhD, DIC, CIDTT (born 21 November 1946) is an Egyptian Professor of Virology and Biotechnology {{and vice}} President of the Arab Society for Biotechnology. He {{was born in}} Alexandria, Egypt. Wagih {{is well known for}} having invented Zymoblot, the fastest {{available}} microtechnique to detect gene expression and/or enzyme activity in any biological specimen as well as the ”Mirror Image in vivo <b>electro-blotting</b> technique” that detects virus particles or any foreign protein (Gene Expression) in any tissue. He also discovered two viruses reported under his name in the world data bank of viruses, the first was named [...] "Peanut Chlorotic Ringspot Virus (PCRV)" [...] and the second was called “Peanut Top Paralysis (PTPV)".|$|E
30|$|The {{affinity}} of the AviPure for IgG {{was investigated}} using protein affinity binding. Samples collected during cultivation (before and after induction) {{were resolved by}} a 15  % SDS-PAGE gel. Separated proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Whatman, Dassel, Germany) using a wet <b>electro-blotting</b> apparatus (Bio-Rad, USA). To prevent non-specific binding, the free binding sites of the membranes were saturated with 5  % fat free dry milk powder in TTBS (overnight at 4  °C with gentle agitation). Thereafter, the membrane was thoroughly washed five times, each for 5  min with 50  mL TTBS. After each incubation, the membrane was washed in the same way. The Goat anti-protein A polyclonal antibodies HRP conjugate at dilution of 1 : 6000 {{was applied to the}} membrane, incubated for 1.5  h at room temperature with gentle agitation. This was followed by washing and the membranes were washed again and the proteins were subsequently visualized with a chemiluminescence kit (ECL) on X-ray film.|$|E
40|$|Components from Dendranthema × grandiflorum cv. “Mottenohoka” {{that promote}} neurite {{outgrowth}} of PC 12 cells {{were identified and}} the mechanism of neurite outgrowth stimulated by isolated components was studied. Components that promoted the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 / 2 (ERK 1 / 2) of PC 12 cells were isolated. From various structural analyses, the active components were identified as acacetin and luteolin. The effects of acacetin or luteolin on PC 12 cells were evaluated by <b>electro-blotting</b> and immunostaining. Slight neurite outgrowth in PC 12 cells was observed within 2 days of culture after stimulation by luteolin or acacetin. However, NGF-stimulation induced remarkable neurite outgrowth in comparison. Neurite outgrowth by luteolin or acacetin was significantly enhanced by pretreatment with SB 203580 (a p 38 MAPK inhibitor). The {{results of this study}} into the phosphorylation of ERK 1 / 2 and p 38 MAPK by flavonoids suggest that the inhibition of p 38 MAPK phosphorylation may effectively enhance neurite outgrowth...|$|E
30|$|HUVECs were seeded onto 6 -well plates at a {{density of}} 1 [*]×[*] 104  cells/well and pre-cultured for 2  days to form subconfluent cultures. After washing, {{the cells were}} treated with PPP, PRP, or PRFext in a CO 2 {{incubator}} (5  % CO 2) for 10  min in serum-free Hank’s balanced saline solution (HBSS). After washing twice with ice cold PBS, the cells were lysed with Laemmli sample buffer as previously described [22]. Protein samples were fractionated using 10  % SDS-PAGE (ATTO, Tokyo, Japan) and <b>electro-blotted</b> onto PVDF membranes using the Trans-Blot® Turbo™ Transfer System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA).|$|R
40|$|A {{procedure}} for the purification of TSWV-Tx, a tomato spotted wilt virus isolate infecting groundnuts in Texas, is described. A rabbit antiserum was produced. Several TSWV isolates occurring on groundnuts in the USA reacted to varying extents in ELISA with antisera to TSWV-Tx and to Greek TSWV isolates, {{but failed to}} react with antiserum to an isolate of TSWV from India. In reciprocal tests, antigens of the Indian TSWV failed to react with antisera to Tx and to the Greek isolates. Purified TSWV-Tx contained 4 polypeptide species of 78 [*] 000, 54 [*] 000 and 27 [*] 000 Da. In <b>electro-blot</b> immunoassays, all 4 polypeptides reacted with the homologous antiserum and with antisera prepared against a Greek, a Dutch and an Australian isolate. None of the polypeptides reacted with the antiserum to the Indian isolate...|$|R
30|$|Proteins {{extracted}} from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia PM 102 grown in minimal medium with 0.2 % peptone, 0.2 %TCE with 0.2 % peptone and 0.2 %TCE sole {{were resolved by}} 12 % SDS-PAGE. The SDS PAGE gel, after electrophoresis (unstained) was <b>electro-blotted</b> onto nitrocellulose membrane (Sigma Aldrich USA) at 45 volts for 3 hours. The next steps were same as in dot blot: the nitrocellulose membrane was blocked in 3 % milk powder and incubated in serum antibody overnight at 4 °C followed by incubation in secondary antibody (1 : 15, 000 dilutions in buffer A) of Goat antirabbit IgG coupled to alkaline phosphatase. Each step was followed by thorough washing the membrane in buffer A. Finally, the membrane was incubated in alkaline phosphate buffer and developed with BCIP/NBT. Immuno-blotting was carried out with total serum antibody as well as preadsorbed serum antibody.|$|R

40|$|Three rat {{hybridoma}} {{lines that}} produced monoclonal antibodies reacting with the peribacteroid membrane from Pisum sativum were isolated, and these all appeared to recognise the same antigenic structure. Using {{one of these}} monoclonal antibodies, AFRC MAC 64, electron microscopy of immunogold-stained thin sections of nodule tissue revealed that the antigen, present in the peribacteroid membrane, was {{also found in the}} plant plasma membranes and in the Golgi bodies, but not in the endoplasmic reticulum. When peribacteroid membrane proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose by <b>electro-blotting,</b> it was found that MAC 64 bound to a series of protease-sensitive bands that migrated in the mol. wt. range 50 - 85 K. The epitope was sensitive to periodate oxidation and its structure may therefore involve the carbohydrate component of a membrane glycoprotein. We suggest that this structure originates in the Golgi apparatus and is subsequently transferred to the peribacteriod membranes and plasma membranes. The monoclonal antibody also reacted with peribacteroid membranes from nodules of Vicia and lupin, and with plasma membranes and Golgi membranes from uninfected plant cells, including root tip cells from onion (Allium cepa), indicating that the antigen is highly conserved in the plasma membranes of plant cells...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} aimed {{to examine the}} ways that the Haemonchus longistipes {{components}} interact with the host by investigating {{the components of the}} parasite which acted as antigens during infection and those who are capable of inducing immune response when administered as immunogens. Adult H. longistipes worms (300 females and 200 males) were obtained from the abomasums of naturally infected slaughtered camels. H. longistipes soluble extract was prepared and stored at - 20 Â°C until the time of analysis. Hyperimmune serum of H. longistipes crude soluble extract was raised in rabbits. H. longistipes soluble extract, were electrophoresed on 7 - 20 % gradient polyacrylamide gels. Protein banding pattern on the gels was visualized by Coomassie Blue stain. After electrophoresis, Western blots were prepared by <b>electro-blotting</b> separated antigens in unstained gels onto nitrocellulose paper. Antigens were detected by western immunoblotting against infection serum and antisera raised against soluble extract. The antigenic components of the parasite were identified. Twenty three protein bands ranging from 126 to 18 -kDa were detected in the parasite crude soluble extract using SDS-PAGE. Sixteen of these components were identified as immunogens using Western immunoblotting against sera from rabbits immunized with a range of soluble parasite materials. Three of these immunogens, 126, 76 and 18 -kDa were also found to act as antigens during infection as revealed by immunoblotting against serum from infected camels. The 76 -kDa and 18 -kDa showed potent reaction with both types of antisera and necessitate further investigation in their role as diagnostic materials and as target antigens for production of vaccines. The present study suggests that the peptide bands 76 and 18 -kDa represent useful candidates for serodignosis of cameline haemonchosis. The role of these peptides in serodiagnosis of cameline haemonchosis will be investigated by purifying these peptides and raising monospecific antisera against them which will be used to develop an antigen capture ELISA for detection of circulating H. longistipes antigens in camel serum. The ability of the developed assay to differentiate between infections with other helminthes parasites will also be investigated...|$|E
40|$|Soft contact lens wear {{has become}} a common {{phenomenon}} in recent times. The contact lens when placed in the eye rapidly undergoes change. A film of biological material builds up on and in the lens matrix. The long term wear characteristics of the lens ultimately depend on this process. With time distinct structures made up of biological material {{have been found to}} build up on the lens. A fuller understanding of this process and how it relates to the lens chemistry could lead to contact lenses that are better tolerated by the eye. The tear film is a complex biological fluid, it is this fluid that bathes the lens during wear. It is reasonable to suppose that it is material derived from this source that accumulates on the lens. To understand this phenomenon it was decided to investigate the make up and conformation of the protein species that are found on and in the lens. As inter individual variations in tear fluid composition have been found {{it is important to be}} able to study the proteins on a single lens. Many of the analytical techniques used in bio research are not suitable for this study because of the lack of sensitivity. Work with poly acrylamide electrophoresis showed the possibility of analyzing the proteins extracted from a single lens. The development of a biotin avidin <b>electro-blot</b> and an enzyme linked aniibody <b>electro-blot,</b> lead to the high sensitivity detection and identification of the proteins present. The extraction of proteins from a lens is always incomplete. A method that analyses the proteins in situ would be a great advancement. Fourier transform infra red microscopy was developed to a point where a thin section of a contact lens could yield information about the proteins present and their conformation. The three dimensional structure of the gross macroscopic structures termed white spots was investigated using confocal laser microscopy...|$|R
40|$|A {{procedure}} for the purification of a tospovirus which causes bud necrosis disease (BND) of peanut in India is described. The virus contained three polypeptides of 78 kDa, 54 kDa and 31 kDa. In two ELISA procedures the virus failed to react with antisera to tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) obtained from different sources {{and with an}} antiserum to impatiens necrotic spot virus (INSV). Additionally, in reciprocal tests TSWV and INSV antigens failed to react with antiserum to the virus infecting peanut in India. In <b>electro-blot</b> immunoassay 54 kDa and 31 kDa polypeptides of the virus reacted with the homologous antiserum. None of the heterologous antisera reacted {{with any of the}} three viral polypeptides. On the basis of serological differences the virus that causes BND in India is distinct and therefore has been named bud necrosis virus (BNV). This serotype appears to be restricted to Asia...|$|R
30|$|The {{expression}} of the recombinant VEGF 165 protein in E. coli BL 21 cells was evaluated by SDS-PAGE and Western Blot. The total protein extract (30  µg) and the purified protein were mixed to loading buffer, heated for 5  min and applied on the gel. 15 % SDS-PAGE electrophoresis was conducted in buffer (25  mM Tris; 250  mM Glycine; 1 ‰ SDS) for 2  h. Separated proteins were directly <b>electro-blotted</b> onto a nitrocellulose membrane in buffer (39  mM Glycine; 48  mM Tris; 0.037 % SDS; Methanol 20 %) for 1  h at constant voltage (15  V). The membrane was stained with Ponceau S then distained using bi-distilled water, to verify protein-transfer efficiency. The membrane was blocked for 1  h at room temperature with 5 % skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline (0.9 % NaCl in 10  mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) with Tween- 20. Immuno-blotting {{was carried out by}} incubating the membrane with primary antibody Anti-His Sigma-Aldrich diluted to 1 : 5000; then with the appropriate Horseradish Peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody diluted to 1 : 5000. Peroxidase activity was detected using the Amersham enhanced chemo-luminescence system and autoradiography or densitometric analysis performed by the Versadoc MP 4000 imaging system (Bio-Rad).|$|R

40|$|An epitope-specific {{polyclonal}} antiserum {{was produced in}} rabbits immunized against a synthetic 15 amino acid peptide (QRVTGLDFIPGLHPV) derived from the coding sequence reported for the porcine leptin gene (GenBank Accession No. U 59894). This peptide contains a core sequence comprised of eight amino acids (GLDFIPGL) that is totally conserved in all leptin proteins studied to date. Purified recombinant human, mouse, rat, pig, and chicken leptin proteins were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and <b>electro-blotted</b> onto PVDF membranes. Western blots were developed employing the leptin-specific peptide antiserum with an alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG second antibody chromogenic system. The peptide antiserum {{was found to be}} highly specific for leptin which exhibited an estimated molecular weight of about 16 kDa for all species analyzed. The sensitivity of the Western blot assay was not sufficient to permit the direct detection of leptin in chicken serum or plasma. However, with this assay we were able to detect native leptin protein in an enriched fraction prepared from chicken plasma using a combination of gel filtration and ion exchange column chromatography. Slot blots indicated a potential application of the immunostaining technique for quantitative analysis of leptin protein. Finally, the peptide antiserum was successfully employed to localize leptin protein by immunohistochemical staining of thin sections prepared from adipose (chicken and pig) and liver (chicken) tissue samples. This study is the first to report a polyclonal peptide antiserum that apparently recognizes intact leptin protein, both native and recombinant, regardless of the species of origin...|$|R
40|$|A disease characterised by {{chlorotic}} {{stripes and}} bands, named sorghum stripe disease (SStD), was observed on sorghum in India with an incidence {{of less than}} 0. 5 % to nearly 10 %. The affected plants were dwarfed and had poor or no panicle formation. This disease could be transmitted by the delphacid planthopper Peregrinus maidis to sorghum but not to Brachiaria eruciformis; Cenchrus ciliaris; Chloris barbata; Dichantium annulatum; Dichantium aristatum; Digitaria ciliaris: Dinebra retroflexa; Echinocloa colona; Eleusine coracana; Pennisetum glaucum; Pennisetum violaceum; Setaria pallida Fusca; Triticum aestivum and Zea mays. Sorghum stripe disease was shown {{to be caused by}} a tenuivirus serologically related to maize stripe virus (MStV). Virus particles were filamentous, less than 10 nm in width. The purified virus preparation contained only one polypeptide of 34 500 D. Eight species of nucleic acids, four ssRNA of 1. 21, 0. 87, 0. 73, 0. 47 ± 106 D and four dsRNA of 2. 43, 1. 69, 1. 40, 0. 71 ± 106 D, were extracted from purified virus preparations. When the four dsRNA were denatured, they migrated along with the four ssRNA species indicating that dsRNA contained duplex RNA of same molecular weight as the four ssRN A. In enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and in <b>electro-blot</b> immunoassay it was evident that MStV-Sorg was serologically more closely related to the MStV isolates from Florida, Reunion and Venezuela than to a RStV isolate from Japan. The virus was named MStV-Sorg to distinguish it from MStV which readily infects maize. This is the first report of occurrence of a tenuivirus in the Indian subcontinent...|$|R
40|$|A leaf {{disease of}} sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) characterised by fine {{discontinuous}} chlorotic streaks between the veins, was observed on sorghum grown during the 1987 / 88 post-rainy season in peninsular India. Early-infected plants were stunted, had shortened internodes, and produced poorly developed panicles. The virus was transmitted by the delphacid planthopper, Peregrinus maidis. Negatively stained leaf dip preparations contained bullet-shaped virus particles (208 ± 4. 4 × 66 ± 1. 0 nm) resembling those of rhabdoviruses. In ultrathin sections, the particles budded through the inner nuclear membrane and {{were present in}} the cytoplasm within membrane-bound vesicles that were apparently contiguous with the distended outer nuclear membrane. A method for purifying the virus was developed utilising polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation, Celite filtration and sucrose densitygradient centrifugation. An antiserum was produced in rabbits with a titre of 1 / 2650 in the precipitin ring interphase test. The virus could be detected in infected sorghum leaf tissues using a direct antigen coating form of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DAC-ELISA). In immuno-double diffusion tests, the virus reacted positively with antisera to maize mosaic virus (MMV) from Reunion (MMV-RN) and Hawaii (MMV-HI), but not with antisera to barley yellow striate mosaic (BYSMV), cereal chlorotic mottle (CCMV), and cynodon chlorotic streak (CCSV) viruses. Thus, the virus isolated from sorghum is designated the MMV-S isolate. In DAC-ELISA tests, MMV-S reacted positively with antisera to MMV-R, MMV-HI, MMV-Florida isolate, CCSV, and CCMV, and weakly with antiserum to BYSMV. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed four major proteins of relative mass Mr 70 000, 59 000, 32 000 and 28 000. In <b>electro-blot</b> immunoassay, MMV and CCSV antisera detected the G and N proteins. These data suggest that MMV-S should be placed in the sonchus yellow net virus subgroup of plant rhabdoviruse...|$|R
40|$|Honey storage initiates {{melanoidin}} formation that involves {{a cascade of}} seemingly unguided redox reactions between amino acids/proteins, reducing sugars and polyphenols. In the process, high molecular weight protein-polyphenol complexes are formed, but the mechanism involved remains unknown. The objective {{of this study was}} twofold: to determine quantitative and qualitative changes in proteins in honeys stored for prolonged times and in different temperatures and to relate these changes to the formation of protein-polyphenol complexes. Six -month storage decreased the protein content by 46. 7 % in all tested honeys (t-test, p< 0. 002) with the rapid reduction occurring during the first three month. The changes in protein levels coincided with alterations in molecular size and net charge of proteins on SDS -PAGE. <b>Electro-blotted</b> proteins reacted with a quinone-specific nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) on nitrocellulose membranes indicating that quinones derived from oxidized polyphenols formed covalent bonds with proteins. Protein-polyphenol complexes isolated by size-exclusion chromatography differed in size and stoichiometry and fall into two categories: (a) high molecular weight complexes (230 - 180 kDa) enriched in proteins but possessing a limited reducing activity toward the NBT and (b) lower molecular size complexes (110 - 85 kDa) enriched in polyphenols but strongly reducing the dye. The variable stoichiometry suggest that the large, "protein-type" complexes were formed by protein cross-linking, while in the smaller, "polyphenol-type" complexes polyphenols were first polymerized prior to protein binding. Quinones preferentially bound a 31 kDa protein which, by the electrospray quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (ESI-Qtof-MS) analysis, showed homology to dirigent-like proteins known for assisting in radical coupling and polymerization of phenolic compounds. These findings provide a new look on protein-polyphenol interaction in honey where the reaction of quinones with proteins and polyphenols could possibly be under assumed guidance of dirigent proteins...|$|R
