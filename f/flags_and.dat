5|$|If the Wartburg and Hambach rallies had {{lacked a}} {{constitution}} and administrative apparatus, that problem was addressed between 1867 and 1871. Yet, as Germans discovered, grand speeches, <b>flags,</b> <b>and</b> enthusiastic crowds, a constitution, a political reorganization, {{and the provision}} of an imperial superstructure; and the revised Customs Union of 1867–68, still did not make a nation.|$|E
5|$|In September 1919, the Spalding War and Victory Memorials Committee {{was formed}} to oversee {{fundraising}} and construction of the memorial, {{the total cost of}} which was £3,500.

5|$|According to Walter Bolliger, {{development}} of the Floorless Coaster began between 1995 and 1996. In 1999, the world's first Floorless Coaster opened at Six Flags Great Adventure as Medusa. In 2009, the coaster was renamed Bizarro and re-themed. After the success of Bolliger & Mabillard's prototype Floorless Coaster, SeaWorld, Cedar Fair, Six <b>Flags,</b> <b>and</b> independent parks, Janfusun Fancyworld, Parque Warner Madrid, Tivoli Gardens, and Ocean Park Hong Kong have built other coasters of this model at their parks. There are currently 14 Floorless Coasters in operation with Dominator being the only one relocated to another park.|$|E

50|$|The Act on National <b>Flag</b> <b>and</b> Anthem {{established}} the Nisshōki {{as the national}} <b>flag</b> <b>and</b> Kimigayo as the national anthem. Details about each symbol were provided in appendices, including specifications {{for the construction of}} the <b>flag</b> <b>and</b> sheet music for Kimigayo. The law made no provisions for the use or treatment of either symbol, leading to different national and prefectural agencies and ministries creating their own regulations. If rules about the use of the <b>flag</b> <b>and</b> anthem had been included in the Act, it would not have gained enough support in the Diet to pass.|$|R

Together with Canton 10, West Herzegovina also used the former Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia's <b>flag</b> <b>and</b> coat of arms. However, these symbols were deemed unconstitutional by the Federation Constitutional Court, because [...] "it only {{represented}} one group".|$|R
5|$|Along {{with the}} {{collectible}} {{items that are}} flown on shuttle missions, such as mission patches, <b>flags,</b> <b>and</b> other personal items for the crew, were an official Harlem Globetrotters basketball and a basketball that Edwin Hubble used in 1909 when he played for the University of Chicago. After being returned to Earth, the Harlem Globetrotters basketball would {{be placed in the}} Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, and Hubble's ball would be returned to the University of Chicago. Michael Massimino flew a 1964 reprint of Galileo's Sidereus Nuncius from the library of his alma mater, MIT.|$|E
5|$|Assuming this {{warning shot}} {{had been fired}} {{in the belief that}} his brig, which was not flying a flag, may be an enemy vessel, Barlow ordered the British naval ensign and the pennant of the Channel Fleet run up. Thus clearly {{identified}} as a neutral British warship, Barlow allowed Childers to drift closer inshore with the tide. The French battery responded by raising tricolour <b>flags</b> <b>and</b> red pennants, a move copied by the other batteries covering the Goulet. Having drifted much closer to two batteries Childers suddenly came under heavy fire, the batteries containing very large 48-pounder cannon.|$|E
5|$|Early {{means of}} {{communicating}} over a distance included visual signals, such as beacons, smoke signals, semaphore telegraphs, signal <b>flags,</b> <b>and</b> optical heliographs. Other examples of pre-modern long-distance communication included audio messages such as coded drumbeats, lung-blown horns, and loud whistles. 20th and 21st century technologies for long-distance communication usually involve electrical and electromagnetic technologies, such as telegraph, telephone, and teleprinter, networks, radio, microwave transmission, fiber optics, and communications satellites.|$|E
5000|$|When {{the law was}} passed, Prime Minister Obuchi {{and other}} {{officials}} stated {{that there was no}} intention to regulate the use of the <b>flag</b> <b>and</b> the anthem in everyday life.

5|$|Hitler was {{discharged}} from the army on 31 March 1920 and began working full-time for the NSDAP. The party headquarters was in Munich, a hotbed of anti-government German nationalists determined to crush Marxism and undermine the Weimar Republic. In February 1921—already highly effective at speaking to large audiences—he spoke to a crowd of over 6,000. To publicise the meeting, two truckloads of party supporters drove around Munich waving swastika <b>flags</b> <b>and</b> distributing leaflets. Hitler soon gained notoriety for his rowdy polemic speeches against the Treaty of Versailles, rival politicians, and especially against Marxists and Jews.|$|E
5|$|Lancaster House, an opulent government-owned period {{house in}} London, was rented (at £20,000 per day) for {{interior}} scenes of Buckingham Palace. The 1936 Accession Council at St. James's Palace, where George VI swore an oath, was filmed in the Livery Hall of Drapers' Hall. The room, ornate and vast, met the occasion: the daunting {{nature of the}} new King's responsibilities was shown by surrounding him with rich detail, <b>flags</b> <b>and</b> royal portraiture.|$|E
2500|$|The Chinese law about flag desecration were {{incorporated}} into Hong Kong law as the National <b>Flag</b> <b>and</b> National Emblem Ordinance in 1997 as required by Annex III of the territory's constitution.

Both ordinances ban desecration of the Chinese <b>flag</b> <b>and</b> Hong Kong <b>flag,</b> respectively, through methods including [...] "burning, mutilating, scrawling on, defiling or trampling".|$|R
50|$|According {{to popular}} tradition, on 27 April, 1941 Konstantinos Koukidis {{was ordered to}} lower the Greek <b>flag,</b> <b>and</b> raise the Nazi {{swastika}} flag.

5|$|On {{the rooftop}} and roof ridges are iconic statues of golden deer {{flanking}} a Dharma wheel, victory <b>flags</b> <b>and</b> monstrous fish. The temple interior {{is a dark}} labyrinth of chapels, illuminated by votive candles and filled with incense. Although portions of the temple has been rebuilt, original elements remain. The wooden beams and rafters have been shown by carbon dating to be original, and the Newari door frames, columns and finials dating to the seventh and eighth centuries were brought from the Kathmandu Valley of Nepal.|$|E
5|$|Polish <b>flags</b> <b>and</b> other symbols were confiscated. The {{war on the}} Polish {{language}} {{included the}} tearing down of signs in Polish and the banning of Polish speech in public places. Persons who spoke Polish in the streets were often insulted and even physically assaulted. The Germanization of place names prevailed. Many treasures of Polish culture – including memorials, plaques and monuments to national heroes (e.g., Kraków's Adam Mickiewicz monument) – were destroyed. In Toruń, all Polish monuments and plaques were torn down. Dozens of monuments were destroyed throughout Poland. The Nazis planned to level entire cities.|$|E
5|$|Princess Alice {{departed}} her new homeport of Bremen on 22March 1904 for {{her maiden}} voyage under her new owners. After arriving in New York draped in <b>flags</b> <b>and</b> bunting, her {{dining room was}} the site of a press luncheon thrown by Lloyd staff celebrating her first arrival in that city. Princess Alice made four more roundtrips through early August, then shifted to Bremen–Suez Canal–Far East service, making her first Lloyd voyage on that route 31August. Princess Alice would continue this pattern—sailing the North Atlantic during the heaviest-trafficked season and shifting to the Far East runs for the balance of the year—through 1910.|$|E

25|$|Most {{countries}} {{have only one}} national <b>flag</b> <b>and</b> ensign for all purposes.

50|$|The next {{revisions}} of the Navy and Army regulations changed their definitions of the <b>flag</b> (<b>and</b> in the Army's case, the color as well) {{to conform to the}} new design, meaning there finally was just one presidential <b>flag,</b> <b>and</b> it was used until 1945.|$|R
5|$|SPLIT is used {{to perform}} split transactions. Rather than tie up the {{high-bandwidth}} USB bus sending data to a slower USB device, the nearest high-bandwidth capable hub receives a SPLIT token followed by one or two USB packets at high-bandwidth, performs the data transfer at full- or low-bandwidth, and provides the response at high-bandwidth when prompted by a second SPLIT token. It contains a seven-bit hub number, 12bits of control <b>flags,</b> <b>and</b> a five-bit CRC.|$|E
