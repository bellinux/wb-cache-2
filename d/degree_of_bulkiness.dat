40|$|AbstractA {{series of}} 2 -substituted eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) {{derivatives}} (as ethyl esters) have been synthesized and evaluated as hypolipidemic and antithrombotic agents in feeding experiments in rats. Repeated administration of purified 2 -methyl-eicosapentaenoic acid and its deuterium analogues (all as ethyl esters) to rats {{resulted in a}} decrease in plasma triglycerides and high density lipoprotein cholesterol. The 2 -methyl-EPA analogues were, apparently, four times more potent than EPA in inducing the triglyceride lowering effect. The 2 -deuterium- 2 -methyl-EPA decreased plasma cholesterol level to ∼ 40 %. A moderate enlargement of the liver was observed in 2 -methyl-EPA treated rats. This was accompanied with an acute reduction in the liver content of triglycerides and a stimulation of peroxisomal β-oxidation and fatty acyl-CoA oxidase activity. The {{results suggest that the}} triglyceride-lowering effect of 2 -methyl-EPA may be due to a reduced supply of fatty acids for hepatic triglyceride biosynthesis because of increased fatty acid oxidation. Platelet aggregation with ADP and A 23187 was performed ex vivo in platelet-rich plasma, after administration of different doses of the EPA-derivatives for five days. EPA and 2, 2 -dideuterium EPA had no effect on ADP-induced aggregation, while 2 -deuterium-, 2 -methyl- and 2 -deuterium- 2 -methyl EPA produced a biphasic effect, i. e. potentiation and inhibition at low (250 mg/daykg body weight) and higher doses (600 – 1300 mg/daykg body weight), respectively. A 23187 -induced platelet aggregation was affected in a similar way by feeding the 2 -substituted EPA derivatives, except that 2 -deuterium- 2 -methyl EPA had no effect relative to EPA itself and that the inhibition was far greater than that for ADP-induced aggregation (∼ 100 % inhibition with 600 mg 2 -methyl-EPA/daykg body weight). The ranking order of the EPA-derivatives to affect platelet aggregation and to cause hypolipidemia was different, suggesting different mechanisms. Our observations suggest that the effects of the EPA derivatives on platelet aggregation could be related to the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>bulkiness</b> around C 2 and that an asymmetric substitution at C 2 caused inhibition of platelet aggregation while a symmetric substitution did not. It is suggested that the bulky, asymmetric derivatives inhibit platelet aggregation by altering platelet membrane phospholipid packing...|$|E
40|$|In this dissertation, the {{influence}} of theside chain on the chiroptical and magnetic properties of conjugated polymers isinvestigated. In the first part regioregularpoly(thiophene) s, substituted with electron rich, conjugated aminostyryl sidechains, are synthesized in order to combine magnetism with conjugated polymers. The formation of magnetic moments (spins), necessary for a materials magneticproperties, is accomplished by selective oxidation of the electron richaminostyryl side chain. The regioregular, head-to-tail substitution patternaligns these magnetic moments within one polymer chain. As the supramolecularorder in the material is also of great importance {{for the creation of}} a purelyorganic (ferro) magnetic material (intermolecular spin alignment). Theaggregation behaviour is examined and it is shown via UV-vis and CD experimentsthat, depending on the bulkiness of the side chain, both side and main chainaggregate under the same conditions, but selective oxidation leads tode-aggregation. In order to overcome this de-aggregation upon oxidation,another class of conjugated polymers, poly-para-(phenylene ethynylene), knownfor their tendency to aggregate, is exploited. Unfortunately, after thoroughinvestigation, it was shown that the synthesis of these PPEs with aminofunctionalized, conjugated side chains could not be accomplished and thereforethis path for the creation of (ferro) magnetic materials was abandoned. The next chapter focuses on the ability tosteer the conformational behaviour of conjugated polymers, by synthesizingdifferent meta coupled arylenes, substituted with oligo(phenylene vinylene) s. By performing UV-vis, CD and DSC experiments it was proven that altering theconformation seems very difficult, as almost all the synthetical changes leadto the formation of supramolecular aggregates. These changes include the use ofdifferent polymer backbones (containing thienothiophene or bithiophene units) and altering the bulkiness and distance to the polymer backbone of the chiralmoieties. In the following chapters the aggregationbehaviour of poly(thiophene) s is studied. First {{the influence}} of the degree ofregioregularity is investigated by synthesizing a series of chiralpoly(3 -alkylsulfanylthiophene) s with different degree of regioregularity. Insolution and film there is a clear trend that the amount of aggregation dependson the degree of regioregularity in a non-linear way as the strongest aggregationand chiral expression is found in those materials with a small amount ofregioirregularity. This indicates that a small amount of disorder facilitatesthe aggregation and chiral expression. In the last chapter a series ofpoly(3 -alkylthiophene) s with a substituent of varying <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>bulkiness</b> issynthesized. It is shown that in solution as well as in film the relativecontribution of the planar and aggregated chains depends on the bulkiness ofthe alkyl chains. This series of polymers also contributes to the investigationof (ferro) magnetism in neutral conjugated polymers and confirms earlierobtained results for poly(thiophene) and strengthens the hypothesis that the&# 61552;-interactions and the fraction of planar polymer chains influence the coercivityand saturation magnetization, respectively. <w:latentstyles deflockedstate="false"

40|$|In this work, an {{in-depth}} analysis of crystalline characteristics has been performed for a {{unique set of}} strictly monodisperse poly-ε-caprolactone (PCL) oligomers. The molecules have different sets of end groups with various <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>bulkiness</b> and hydrogen bonding potential, affecting their aptitude to pack in ordered crystal structures. The oligomers also have different numbers of repeating units (n = 2 - 64), affecting the degree to which end groups influence overall molecular characteristics. The presence of bulky end groups leads to an innate confinement effect on crystallisation which in turn makes it possible to utilize the set of PCL oligomers to study confined space crystallisation. Confined space crystallisation is explored as a route to gain further understanding about the early metastable phases in crystal formation.   The monodisperse nature of the samples made it possible to collect very precise small-angle and wide-angle X-ray scattering data (SAXS and WAXS) as well as calorimetric data. Computer modeling studies were performed to support experimental findings. It was shown that end groups strongly affected crystallisation features for the shorter oligomers (n ≤ 8) but to a lesser extend for the longer oligomers (n ≥ 16). The presence of a bulky end group at one end of an oligomer could inhibit the formation of hydrogen bonds on the other end. Short oligomers (n = 8) with OH-end groups exhibited novel packing characteristics. At one isothermal crystallisation temperature the molecules exhibited not only lamellar ordering but also an additional, likely rectangular or slanted, ordering. The sample was packed in a unique structure with molecular chains lying parallel but not aligned head to head with each other. At a higher crystallisation temperature the molecules packed in a double layered structure and at an even higher temperature in a typical non-folded but tilted single-molecular layer pattern.   Unit cell determination was performed for a short oligomer with two bulky end groups, showing the existence of a tetragonal unit cell with different dimensions than the orthorhombic unit cells previously reported for linear PCL without end groups. To gain greater insight into the earliest stages of molecular packing, in situ WAXS measurements were performed using a synchrotron radiation beam and measuring data each 12 s whilst very slowly going from melt to isothermal crystallisation. It was shown that the crystal unit cell was distorted during the first minutes of slow crystallisation, which might either represent a metastable phase or else a highly distorted orthorhombic phase.

40|$|At the outset, {{the primary}} focus of this Ph. D. project has been {{directed}} towards the synthesis of new 2, 2 ’-dipyridylamino(dpa) - and 1, 2, 4 -triazole(trz) - based ligands to be incorporated into spin crossover (SCO) iron(II) complexes. Initial aims sought the synthesis of a wide and diverse range of SCO compounds containing novel dpa- and trz-based ligands in order to determine what sort of control could be exercised over magnetic properties. New ligands synthesised for the project incorporated a range of nondpa- or trz-substituents with, for example, different capacities to participate in hydrogen bonding or aryl interactions (such as !-stacking), with different <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>bulkiness,</b> flexibility, or additional binding sites, for metals or other guests, that are distinct and separate from the dpa or trz coordination sites. This fundamental study also probed the influence of second coordination sphere entities, including the effects of solvation and counter ion species, upon the spin transition. Structure-function correlations for this work were vital to further the understanding of the factors influential in determining the magnetic properties of crystalline SCO compounds, by varying the nature of the ligand, solvent or counter-ion. As there is currently great interest in the study of multifunctional (‘hybrid’) molecular materials, a further aspect of this Ph. D. project was aimed towards the synthesis of ligands incorporating a moiety capable of a secondary function, in addition to SCO. This led to two main areas of study, the first of which consisted of the synthesis and coordination of a number of ferrocene-appended ligands and {{attempts have been made to}} analyse how one-electron changes at the ferrocene group (located external to the coordination site) influences the spin transition. This includes a system in which a new ferrocene-trz ligand and its 1 -D polynuclear complexes were studied using magnetic, electrochemical and Mössbauer measurements (Chapter 6), as well as synthesis of discrete FeII and CoII complexes incorporating ferrocene-based ligands (Chapter 7). Our second approach at obtaining multifunctional SCO materials has led us to pursue the synthesis and coordination of crown-appended dpa-based ligands which have the potential to show, in addition to SCO, encapsulation of alkali metal ions in the aza-crown ether, which ideally would result in guest dependent magnetic properties. This work appears in Chapter 4. Throughout this study, where possible, all complexes have been comprehensively characterised, primarily using single crystal X-ray structural determination and variable temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements, although the vast array of complexes appearing in this thesis have been characterised using a number of other techniques including PXRD, Mössbauer spectroscopy, electrochemical studies, magnetic- and photo-magnetic measurements and to a lesser extent heat-capacity measurements...|$|R

Choosing as a reference system a second-generation motor known to accomplish rotary motion in the MHz regime and using density functional theory methods, we propose a three-step mechanism for the thermal isomerizations of this motor and show that variation <b>of</b> the steric <b>bulkiness</b> <b>of</b> the substituent at the stereocenter can reduce the (already small) free-energy barrier of the rate-determining step by a further 15 - 17 kJ mol(- 1). This finding holds promise for future motors of this kind to reach beyond the MHz regime. Furthermore, we demonstrate and explain why one particular step is kinetically favored by decreasing and another step is kinetically favored by increasing the steric <b>bulkiness</b> <b>of</b> this substituent, and identify a possible back reaction capable of impeding the rotary rate.

40|$|Matrix glass {{transition}} temperature depression through internal plasticization of a styrene-sodium methacrylate ionomer resulted in enhanced clustering at low plasticization levels (up to ca. 20 mole%). At higher plasticization levels, ion aggregation was strongly disrupted. Matrix polarity effects were studied by nitrating the styrene units of the same ionomer. A sample with a relaxed dielectric constant comparable to acrylate polymers showed no decrease in clustering. Similarly, plasticization with nitrobenzene resulted in typical nonpolar diluent behavior. Polarity was, therefore, not a significant parameter affecting ion aggregation. New styrene copolymers with substituents R = $-$(CH$ sb 2 $) $ sb{ rm n}$COOMe (n = 1, 5, 10) or R = $-$O(CH$ sb 2 $) $ sb{ rm n}$COOMe (n = 1, 4, 10) in the para- position were synthesized, to form a systematic investigation of ionic group spacing effects on the dynamic mechanical properties of ionomers. The results were rationalized in terms <b>of</b> <b>bulkiness</b> and rigidity <b>of</b> the units supporting the ionic groups, and polymer backbone immobilization efficiency.

40|$|We {{have studied}} {{epoxidation}} catalysts based on complexes of nickel with acac (acetylacetonate) ligands in the solid state, in solution, {{and on a}} polymeric support by X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The EXAFS {{results show that the}} <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> association (monomer or trimer) of the Ni(acacR) complexes depends on the <b>bulkiness</b> <b>of</b> R. For R = H, trimers predominate both in the solid state and in solution, whereas for R = p-tBuBn, the monomers that are found in the solid state tend to associate to trimers in solution. The trimers are broken up by excess coreactant, i-butyraldehyde, which converts all Ni complexes to 6 -coordinated species. The lower <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> association of the substituted Ni(acacR) complex accounts for its relatively high catalytic activity at low concentration. For the solid complexes, the EXAFS results, which provide one-dimensional structural information, are complemented by XANES simulations defining the three-dimensional structure around Ni. The benzimidazole and pyridine ligands of PBI and AMP-resin partially displace acac in the Ni ligand sphere upon grafting. For the rigid PBI this must result in vacancies in the Ni coordination sphere, which explains why this support gives an active catalyst whereas the AMP-resin does not...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} zinc {{complexes}} with tridentate pyridinoylhydrazone ligands bearing two different end groups and coordinated pyridine molecules were synthesized and characterized. Crystal structures with mono-, di-, and polymeric arrangements were obtained, {{depending on the}} position of the pyridinoyl nitrogen atom. Direct involvement of the pyridinoyl moiety in the coordination to the metal was observed when the nitrogen was in the ortho or meta position. The meta derivatives led to 1 D polymers with the same coordination environment, regardless <b>of</b> the <b>bulkiness</b> <b>of</b> the end group. In this case, unprecedented solid-state photoluminescence quantum yields were recorded. In the ortho ligands, the further bidentate N,N site involving the pyridinoyl nitrogen atom was able to coordinate a further zinc acetate unit. Molecular and periodic calculations were performed within density functional theory (DFT) to rationalize the photophysical behavior. Excellent agreement between the theoretical and experimental absorptions was observed. The HOMOs and LUMOs of the complexes were investigated both in the solid state and in solution...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{series of}} dipolar triphenylaminoazo derivatives, with largely {{distinct}} charge transfer and glass transition temperatures, has been synthesized. Their photomigration capability in the solid state to form surface relief gratings (SRGs) under interferential illumination {{has been investigated}} {{with respect to their}} photochromic properties and showed a prevailing influence <b>of</b> the <b>bulkiness</b> <b>of</b> the azo substituent. The azo mass transfer was utilized to efficiently photoalign 200 nm polystyrene nanoparticles along the SRG crests, which were initially deposited on nonirradiated azo surfaces. In contrast, nanoparticles spin cast on prestructured surface relief gratings were localized in the troughs of the periodic structures. These distinct locations point out the ability of isotropic and amorphous photochromic thin films to collectively move and organize nano-objects in an ordered fashion through the use of polarized illumination. This versatile approach opens the path to optically aligned ensembles of individual nano-objects over large areas, which can be further combined with metallic conductive or magnetic coating to create novel functional nanostructures...|$|R

PF (1), BPh (2) and BF (3) have been synthesized and characterized by microanalysis, IR, UV-Vis, H, C and P NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. The crystal structure of 2 displayed distorted square planar geometry around Ni(II) center bonded through sulfur atoms of the dithiocarbamate ligand and two phosphorus atoms of the dppe.
