40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{identity}} formation of three Turkish speaking social groups – Cypriot Turkish, Kurdish and Turkish (CKT) – living in London in a transnational context. The thesis aims {{to explore how}} CKT youths negotiate their identity by looking at their everyday experiences. The everyday experiences <b>of</b> <b>CKT</b> youth are observed through their discourses and interpretations of different interactions. By analysing these interactions, this thesis aims to fill some of the gaps {{in the literature on}} transnationalism. The theoretical framework of this thesis is based mainly on Giddens’ theory of identity formation and Faist’s concept of transnational social space. By focusing on the concepts of identity and transnational social space, the thesis examines how the experiences, perceptions and social relations <b>of</b> <b>CKT</b> youth are formed by negotiation and dialogue with the country of origin, host culture and individual attachments. Giddens helps us to conceive identity in a dynamic way and as an outcome of the interaction between structural dimensions, social relations and the self. In this thesis, these structural, social and individual dimensions are operationalised through the analysis <b>of</b> <b>CKT</b> youth interaction with their family, community organisations, school contexts, neighbourhood environments and transnational medias. The concept of transnational social space is used to characterise the identity formation occurring across the borders of nation-states and brought into a single social space. The empirical data are based on 45 semi-structured interviews with CKT youth, 16 semi-structured interviews with first generation CKT migrants, one focus group and participatory observation at five community meetings, as well as several social events organised by CKT youth. The thesis concludes that the choices young people make in terms of their ways of life, the sorts of interactions they have, and their social and cultural preferences frame their positioning within society. Their experiences are diverse and transformative, formed through their interactions with various social and structural aspects surrounding them...|$|R

Two teachers (with {{high and low}} measured CKT) are observed {{on the same day}} teaching similar content. Many studies have recently been published linking student achievement to teacher’s CKT and many U. S. schools have begun including CKT measures in teacher hiring and retention decisions. Teaching observed for this study illustrates that content can be taught effectively by teachers across the spectrum <b>of</b> <b>CKT</b> levels, but observable and significant differences in teaching leads to important questions for inservice and preservice teacher educators...|$|R
