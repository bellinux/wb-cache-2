But Matsuōmaru himself arrives, and {{explains}} to all involved that the boy killed was his own son, and that he did this intentionally, in order to make up for his past transgressions against Kan Shōjō and the Court, and his involvement in Shihei's schemes.|$|E
25|$|The Salinas {{prepare to}} attend a ball, {{one of the most}} {{important}} of the Palermo social season. The Prince is both excited and concerned about the evening to come. It will be the first time Angelica and her beauty are to be presented to the public. However, he remains concerned that Don Calogero will make a complete fool of both himself and the Salinas. When Angelica (looking beautiful) and Don Calogero (looking acceptable) arrive shortly after, Angelica, thanks to detailed training in etiquette given to her by Tancredi, makes a huge social success. The Prince, after being satisfied that Angelica has been accepted, wanders through the rooms of the Palazzo Ponteleone where the ball is being held, becoming increasingly gloomy at the callowness of the young men, the boredom in the older men, and the silliness of the girls. The Prince notices Tancredi and Angelica dancing happily together, oblivious to the other's desperation, ambition, and greed. As he watches, the Prince comes to realize and accept, if only <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>that</b> whatever happiness the lovers feel is to be celebrated, no matter what.|$|E
500|$|The family {{returned}} to Downe on 27 August, and Darwin again {{wrote to the}} Gardeners' Chronicle appealing for assistance as he was [...] "very anxious to examine a few exotic forms". His requests to the wealthy enthusiasts who had taken up the fashionable pursuit of growing rare orchids brought large numbers of specimens. These would be a test of his theory: previously aspects such as coloration {{of plants and animals}} had often been regarded as having no adaptive function. For example, Thomas Henry Huxley was strongly influenced by German idealism and in 1856 had asked if it was [...] "to be supposed <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> the beauty of colour and outline... are any good to the animals?... Who has ever dreamed of finding an utilitarian purpose in the forms and colours of flowers... ?" [...] Darwin had, and in the orchids he tackled the most difficult case. His ideas would transform the way naturalists thought about coloration.|$|E

500|$|... {{utterance}} of 'you're my James Dean / {{you make}} me feel like I'm seventeen' on 'Rather Die Young' is made tolerable by her honeyed vocal slides. Certainly, the 'bad boy' Beyoncé is in love with is more a physical representation of countless painfully banal fantasies about guys who 'drive too fast' and 'smoke too much' than an actual person, but at least it feels tangible. For once, the pop song trying to make a connection with its listener doesn't feel like a total fraud. Forget Lady Gaga's song about her relationship with her father or Britney Spears' lullaby to her babies – here, I'm convinced, if only <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>that</b> Beyoncé really would rather die young than to live her life without her lover, that she cares, even if you don't. This doesn't fully explain why 4 is as enjoyable as it is, but it does convey just how convincing Beyoncé can be when given the right tools – {{and it turns out that}} those tools consist of not much more than Beyoncé's voice itself.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{invasion}} of Crete in May 1941, the 2/7th Battalion was initially employed in a coastal defence role, before {{taking part in the}} fighting around Canea. After this, it took part in a devastating bayonet charge at 42nd Street, along with the New Zealand Maori Battalion, which killed almost 300 Germans and briefly checked their advance. It was during this battle that Saunders killed his first opponent: [...] "...I saw a German soldier stand up in clear view about thirty yards [...] away. He was my first sure kill... I can remember <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> it was just like shooting a kangaroo... just as remote." [...] As the Allies began to evacuate the island, the 2/7th was called upon to carry out a series of rearguard actions in order to allow other units to be taken off the island. After the final Allied ships departed the island on 1June 1941, the battalion was left behind. As a result, many of its men were taken prisoner, though some were able to evade capture by hiding out in the hills and caves around the island. Adopting Cretan dress, learning the dialect, and enlisting the help of local inhabitants, Saunders managed to remain hidden for eleven months.|$|E

Not have domestic partnerships; that's not acceptable. I don't believe for a moment [...] would destroy the sanctity of marriage. But let's just say <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> it does. Well, then the sanctity of marriage just has to be destroyed. It's just too bad.

How could anybody think <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> I could be in agreement with reaction and death? ...

We are the acknowledged descendants of the earliest inhabitants of Britain, of men, who, before the time of history, took possession of the island desolate and waste, and, therefore, open to the first occupants.

In her movements, her carriage and her speech she will remind you of Queen Olly though she has big, clear expressive eyes, that promise much. To the outward appearance, her figure is still very slim and childlike, but when she speak this impression is wholly dispelled. She is very well educated and carefully raised".|$|E
2500|$|The Hall of African Mammals {{was first}} {{proposed}} {{to the museum}} by Carl Akeley around 1909. His original concept contained forty dioramas which would present the rapidly vanishing landscapes and animals of Africa. The intent was that a visitor of the hall, “may have the illusion, at worst, of passing a series of pictures of primeval Africa, and at best, may think <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> he has stepped [...] across the sea into Africa itself.” Akeley’s proposal was a hit with both {{the board of trustees}} and then museum president, Henry Fairfield Osborne. To fund its creation, Daniel Pomeroy, a trustee of the museum and partner at J.P. Morgan, offered interested investors the opportunity to accompany the museum’s expeditions in Africa in exchange for funding.|$|E

[...] On March 2, 1918, he made his last entry: [...] "This fighting [...] we are doing now is the real thing. [...] A man gets to be quite a fatalist in this game. [...] If somehow or other they get me -— all well and good. If not —- still better. But somehow I feel safe." ...|$|E
2500|$|As head {{of naval}} logistics, Horne was the Navy's {{principal}} {{point of contact}} for the Truman Committee, a special Senate committee headed by Senator Harry S. Truman that was charged with investigating waste, corruption, and profiteering in the wartime defense industry. Called to testify about alleged waste in the Pacific theater, Horne unapologetically retorted {{that it was impossible}} to run a war effort on that scale without some waste. [...] "I don't deny <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> there are billions of dollars worth of materiel out on Pearl Harbor and elsewhere in the Pacific.... But I just have to resolve the balance in favor of giving the commanders what they say they need, and at the same time, I'm fully aware that you gentlemen are interested, as I am, in saving.

2500|$|In {{terms of}} musical activity—or lack thereof—Bellini {{pleaded guilty in}} the letter to Florimo in March 1844: [...] "If you reflect <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> {{a young man in}} my position, in London and Paris for the first time, cannot help amusing himself immensely, you will excuse me." [...] However, in January 1834, he had signed a {{contract}} to write a new opera for the Théâtre-Italien which would be presented {{at the end of the}} year. [...] At the same time, he had been invited to write a new opera for the San Carlo in Naples for the 1834–35 Carnival season, but declined given the Paris commitment and stated that it might be possible to do so by May 1835 when he knew who were to be the contracted singers. Florimo immediately began to try to persuade his friend to take up this offer, indicating that Malibran had been engaged for Naples in January 1835.|$|E

2500|$|Hay {{published}} a magazine piece entitled Philosophy of laughter {{in which he}} discussed the psychology of comedy. In the essay, he stated [...] "Why does {{every one of us}} laugh at seeing somebody else slapped in the face with a large piece of cold custard pie? Is it because we're all naturally cruel? Or is it because there's something inherently funny in custard pies? Or in faces? Or in throwing things? No. No. and no! The real reason why we laugh is because we are relieved. Because we are released from a sense of fear. Wherever we may happen to be - in the cinema, theatre, or music-hall - we tend to identify with the actors we are watching. So that when a custard pie is thrown we fear <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> it as been thrown at us. And then, immediately we realise that it hasn't hit us, we experience a feeling of relief, and we laugh".|$|E
2500|$|The modernist critic Yuly Aykhenvald, {{analyzing}} the cliché formula that bonded [...] "Maykov, Polonsky and Fet" [...] into a solid group of similar-minded authors, alleged that Maykov [...] "to {{a lesser extent}} {{than the other two}} freed himself from the habit of copying classics" [...] and [...] "in his earlier works was unoriginal, producing verse that shone with reflected light." [...] Not even his passionate love for classics could help the author submerge [...] "wholly into the pagan element," [...] the critic opined.He was a scholar of antiquity and his gift, self-admittedly [...] "has been strengthened by being tempered in the fire of science." [...] As a purveyor of classicism, his very soul was not deep or naive enough to fully let this spirit in or embrace the antique idea of intellectual freedom. Poems, inhabited by naiads, nymphs, muses and dryads, are very pretty, and you can't help being enchanted by these ancient fables. But he gives you no chance to forget <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> – what for his ancient heroes was life itself, for him is only a myth, a 'clever lie' he could never believe himself.|$|E
2500|$|Grandmaster Andrew Soltis {{considers}} St. Amant's swindle in St. Amant–Staunton, 9th match game, 1843 {{the greatest}} ever perpetrated in match history. In the position diagrammed at far left, White {{appears to be}} losing a piece. His queen is under attack, and if 32.Qe4 (to save his bishop on d3), Black plays 32...Ng5 33.Qg2 (for example) Rxd3 and wins. St. Amant produced 32.b5!!, which Staunton called, [...] "A desperate but masterly resource." [...] G.H. Diggle referred to it, equally accurately, as [...] "a move looking so irrelevant that everyone must have thought <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> it was merely a petulant way of resigning". Although {{it should not have}} saved the game, the move in fact has three points: (1) it attacks Black's bishop; (2) after 32...Rxd4 33.exd4 (threatening a back-rank mate and discovering an attack on Black's queen), it prevents the bishop from guarding the e8 square; and (3) after 32...Rxd4 33.exd4, it prevents the queen from defending e8 with 33...Qc6. Black nonetheless could have won with either (a) 32...Bd1! (threatening 33...Bxe2+) 33.Rxd1 Rxd4 34.exd4 Qh5 35.Be3 Qf3+ 36.Ke1 Re8 37.Kd2 Nf2 (Ossip Bernstein) or (b) 32...Rxd4 33.exd4 g5! 34.fxg6 Qh5!, when Black avoids being mated and himself threatens 35...Qf3+ and mate next move. Instead, Staunton played 32...Qh5? immediately. After St. Amant's 33.g4!, he should have played 33...Qh4 34.Qxa4 Rxd3. But shattered by the realization that he had thrown away a win, Staunton blundered again with 33...Rxd4?? 34.exd4! f6 35.gxh5 and Black resigned. The two winning lines for Black are sufficiently difficult that Staunton, annotating the game 16 years later in his Chess Player's Companion, gave neither of them, instead recommending a line leading to a probable draw by perpetual check.|$|E
