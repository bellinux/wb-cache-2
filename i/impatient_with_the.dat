5|$|Accounts by 19th-century historians {{suggest that}} Day grew <b>impatient</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> girls {{when they became}} bored with their lessons and began to squabble, and that he also spent {{significant}} time nursing them through a bout of smallpox. These accounts may have been exaggerated as both girls had been inoculated against smallpox, and their strict upbringing meant {{they would not have}} rebelled excessively.|$|E
5|$|The {{book has}} been called engagingly written, wisely researched, and {{honestly}} told. Critics admired the wit and humour. The book reviewer for The Globe and Mail admitted he grew <b>impatient</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> grand and repetitive statements about the changing global food system and the authors' hyperbole regarding their modest culinary discoveries. Compared to Kingsolver's Animal, Vegetable, Miracle, The 100-Mile Diet {{was found to be}} more compelling and easier to read, with Smith and MacKinnon more relatable and sympathetic than Kingsolver.|$|E
5|$|After the battle, Sheridan {{pressured}} {{his officers}} to pursue Early's retreating army. On September 23, Sheridan became <b>impatient</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> cautious {{commander of the}} 2nd Cavalry Division, General Averell. Sheridan replaced Averell with Colonel Powell, who {{had been one of}} Averell's brigade commanders. Powell was promoted to brigadier general shortly afterwards. Colonel Henry Capehart was designated commander of Powell's old brigade, and Capehart's brother, Charles, became commander of Capehart's 1st West Virginia Cavalry regiment. Major Hoffman remained commander of the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry regiment. Powell's 2nd Cavalry Division pursued Early further south. During this pursuit, Confederate cavalry led by General Williams Carter Wickham attempted a flanking maneuver on Powell's right, but was repulsed by artillery and a charge by the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry.|$|E

25|$|Attempts {{were made}} in 1989 and 1993 to comply with EU {{regulations}} to limit yield, but little progress was made. <b>Impatient</b> <b>with</b> this, <b>the</b> prestigious VDP growers' association successfully instituted reasonably stringent limits for their members. The 1993 legislation successfully raised minimum must weights for Pradikats in several notable Anbaugebieten, and limited moves were made to clarify the labeling system.|$|R
5|$|By 1943, Sands {{had become}} <b>impatient</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Navy's bureaucracy. After {{discussing}} {{the situation with}} Wilson, he appeared unannounced in Santa Fe, New Mexico, {{at the office of}} Dorothy McKibbin, who had been designated to meet newcomers to Los Alamos Laboratory. After she made a telephone call to the personnel office, which had just received a desperate call for electronics people, Sands was bussed to Los Alamos. To his surprise, he was met by Jorgenson, who had just joined the Manhattan Project after leaving Clark and going to Nebraska. He immediately took Sands to the library to read Robert Serber's Los Alamos Primer, which introduced him to the basic physical principles of nuclear fission as they were known at the time, and their implications for nuclear weapon design.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} half of the 20th century, Peking opera {{witnessed}} a steady decline in audience numbers. This has been attributed both to a decrease in performance quality and an inability of the traditional opera form to capture modern life. Furthermore, the archaic language of Peking opera required productions to use electronic subtitles, which hampered the development of the form. The influence of Western culture has also left the younger generations <b>impatient</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> slow pacing of Peking opera. In response, Peking opera began to see reform starting in the 1980s. Such reforms have taken the form of creating a school of performance theory to increase performance quality, employing modern elements to attract new audiences, and performing new plays outside of the traditional canon. However, these reforms have been hampered by both a lack of funding and an adverse political climate that makes the performance of new plays difficult.|$|E
5|$|The Australians had {{continued}} to operate independently within Phuoc Tuy province, and while the war had become a series of big unit search and destroy operations in a war of attrition for the Americans, they had pursued their own counter-insurgency campaign. Regardless, differences of opinion between Australian and American methods had produced friction, and increasingly <b>impatient</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Australian approach, in early 1967 the Commander US MACV, General William Westmoreland, had complained to the Commander Australian Forces Vietnam, Major General Tim Vincent, demanding a more aggressive approach. However, the Australians were convinced that deliberate patrolling techniques were more effective in separating communist forces from {{the population in the}} villages while working towards slowly extending government control, and such urgings went largely unheeded.|$|E
50|$|The {{pressure}} was {{now beginning to}} increase on Frank Taylor <b>with</b> <b>the</b> club gearing up for another season in the second tier. Taylor believed he was building a useful and settled squad however the supporters were starting to get <b>impatient</b> <b>with</b> him. <b>The</b> 1957-58 season was again a huge disappointment as after a good {{first half of the}} season was followed up by a poor second half and they ended up in 11th position.|$|R

5000|$|The {{agitators}} {{were described}} as young men who are 'tired of waiting for action' and <b>impatient</b> <b>with</b> both <b>the</b> regime's actions and opposition's inaction. Ukrainian media linked the action to a hitherto little-known right-wing youth group called [...] "Right Sector". Arseniy Yatsenyuk claimed {{the actions of the}} radical protesters were orchestrated by the government to create a pretext for further repressions. Other commentators said that rioters appeared to have the support of the majority of protesters on the scene and did not represent a minority of the Euromaidan movement.|$|R
5|$|The Quraysh {{veterans}} grew <b>impatient</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> deadlock. A {{group of}} militants led by ‘Amr ibn ‘Abd Wudd (who {{was thought to}} be equal to a thousand men in fighting) and Ikrimah ibn Abi Jahl attempted to thrust through the trench and managed to effect a crossing, occupying a marshy area near the hillock of Sala. 'Amr challenged the Muslims to a duel. In response, Ali ibn Abi Talib accepted the challenge, and was sent by Muhammad to fight. Both the fighters got lost in the dust as the duel became intense. Finally, the soldiers heard scream(s) which hinted decisive blows, but it was unclear which of the two was successful. The slogan, 'Allahu Akbar' (God is the greatest) from the dust confirmed Ali's victory. The confederates were forced to withdraw in a state of panic and confusion. Although the Confederates lost only three men during the encounter, they failed to accomplish anything important.|$|E
5|$|Afterward, the PSC {{largely ignored}} the lease plan {{since it was}} still focused on {{building}} {{the first phase of}} the Dual Contracts. The Flushing Business Men's Association kept advocating for the Amity Street subway, causing a schism between them and the rest of the groups that supported the LIRR lease. Through the summer of 1915, the PSC and the LIRR negotiated the planned lease to $125,000 a first year, , with an eight percent increase each year; the negotiations then stalled in 1916. The Whitestone Improvement Association, <b>impatient</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> pace of negotiations, approved of the subway under Amity Street even though it would not serve them directly. The PSC's chief engineer wrote in a report that a combined 20,600 riders would use the Whitestone and Bayside lines each day in either direction, and that by 1927, there would be 34,000 riders per day per direction. The Third Ward Rapid Transit Association wrote a report showing how much they had petitioned for Flushing subway extensions to that point, compared to how little progress they had made in doing so. Negotiations continued to be stalled in 1917. Despite the line not having been extended past Corona yet, the idea of a subway extension to Little Neck encouraged development there.|$|E
5|$|The Australians {{considered}} the operation a complete success and its results were largely seen to vindicate their evolving tactics, techniques and procedures. In the following months 5 RAR continued to develop cordon and search procedures as 1 ATF attempted {{to extend its}} influence, with such operations proving significant in weakening the Viet Cong infrastructure and removing a number of villages from their control. In this manner the Australians had continued to operate independently within Phuoc Tuy province, and while the war had become a series of big unit search and destroy operations in a war of attrition for the Americans, they had pursued their own counter-insurgency campaign. Regardless, differences of opinion between Australian and American methods had produced friction, and increasingly <b>impatient</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Australian approach, in early-1967 the Commander US Military Assistance Command Vietnam, General William Westmoreland, had complained to the Commander Australian Forces Vietnam, Major General Tim Vincent, demanding a more aggressive approach.

50|$|In July 1972, Rhoodie, {{at the age}} of 38, was {{appointed}} to the post of Secretary of Information. This promotion was quite controversial in South African politics, since Rhoodie was {{not a member of the}} Afrikaner Broederbond (a secret fraternal organization dedicated to the promotion of the interests of Afrikaners). He was young, dynamic, enterprising and <b>impatient,</b> particularly <b>with</b> <b>the</b> bureaucratic process. These were the qualities that enabled him to get things done.|$|R

Arriving at his journey's end, he leaped out, and breathlessly announcing his errand to the servant, followed him straight into the library, we there was a great confusion of tongues, and where Mr Dombey, his sister, and Miss Tox, Richards, and Nipper, were all congregated together.|$|R

25|$|According to some scholars, {{what both}} {{religion}} and spirituality {{have in common}} is a sense of the supernatural, while others see supernatural thought unnecessary for spirituality. In colonial America, some people had a supernatural curiosity that was often combined with free-thinking rationalism advocated by intellectuals such as Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson. Robert Fuller has characterized the SBNR phenomenon as a mix of intellectual progressivism and mystical hunger, <b>impatient</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> piety of established churches.|$|E
50|$|Charlie Chaplin {{joined the}} Essanay company in 1915, and the studio made Turpin his second banana. Chaplin was {{maturing}} as a filmmaker, working slowly and intuitively. Turpin, however, was <b>impatient</b> <b>with</b> Chaplin's methods. <b>The</b> earthy Turpin understood straightforward slapstick more than comic subtlety. The Chaplin-Turpin duo didn't last long, with Chaplin abandoning Chicago for California. Turpin does share one additional credit with Chaplin: after Chaplin filmed Burlesque on Carmen in two reels, Essanay filmed new scenes with Turpin to pad the picture into a featurette, doubling its length.|$|R
25|$|The 1969 {{death of}} Barrientos in a {{helicopter}} accident led to a succession of weak governments. A coup was led by the military, only to see a countercoup led by leftist Juan José Torres. Alarmed by public disorder, the military, the MNR, and others installed Col. (later General) Hugo Banzer Suárez as President in 1971. Banzer ruled with MNR support from 1971 to 1974. Then, <b>impatient</b> <b>with</b> schisms in <b>the</b> coalition, he replaced civilians <b>with</b> members of <b>the</b> armed forces and suspended political activities. The economy grew impressively during Banzer's presidency, but demands for greater political freedom undercut his support. His call for elections in 1978 plunged Bolivia into turmoil once again.|$|R

25|$|The {{result was}} a series of new laws that made the Irish Parliament a {{powerful}} institution that was independent of the British Parliament, although still {{under the supervision of the}} King and his Privy Council. These concessions, instead of satisfying the Irish Patriots, intensified their demands. The Irish Rebellion of 1798 was instigated by those <b>impatient</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> slow pace of reform, with French support. Britain suppressed the separatists, and legislated a complete union with Ireland in 1801, including the abolition of the Irish Parliament.|$|E

The resulting general election in 1977 convened the Constituent Cortes (the Spanish Parliament, in its capacity as a constitutional assembly) for the purpose of drafting and approving the constitution of 1978.

60|$|The one word, Lizzie, {{he muttered}} {{millions}} of times. In a certain phase of his distressful state, {{which was the}} worst to those who tended him, he would roll his head upon the pillow, incessantly repeating the name in a hurried and <b>impatient</b> manner, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> misery of a disturbed mind, and the monotony of a machine. Equally, when he lay still and staring, he would repeat it for hours without cessation, but then, always {{in a tone of}} subdued warning and horror. Her presence and her touch upon his breast or face would often stop this, and then they learned to expect that he would for some time remain still, with his eyes closed, and that he would be conscious on opening them. But, the heavy disappointment of their hope--revived by the welcome silence of the room--was, that his spirit would glide away again and be lost, in the moment of their joy that it was there.|$|R
25|$|Virgin {{began to}} grow <b>impatient</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> album's {{recording}} as it went over budget and became behind schedule. The band, however, would not let the company cut corners if it meant compromising the sound. By the time recording was completed, Corgan and Vig felt too emotionally exhausted to mix the record. Corgan suggested that engineer Alan Moulder mix the album, due to his work on Loveless by My Bloody Valentine. Moulder booked two weeks in a studio to mix the album; the mix ended up taking 36 days to complete. Eventually, the album was finished after four months and $250,000 over budget.|$|E

Caenina {{was the first to}} attack; its army was swiftly put to flight, and the town taken. After personally defeating and slaying the prince of Caenina in single combat, Romulus stripped him of his armour, becoming the first to claim the spolia opima, and vowed a temple to Jupiter Feretrius. Antemnae and Crustumerium were conquered in turn, and some of their people, chiefly the families of the abducted women, allowed to settle at Rome.|$|E

However, a shocked Rumple drops and shatters the ball after seeing an image of Belle. After meeting with Emma, he tells her that they'll need a deceased soul's aura to disguise their presence {{in order to save}} Hook. He introduces Emma to his late wife, Milah. The group then heads to Emma's Underworld home and Milah is able to penetrate a protection spell leading to Hades' lair. The trio go further, but Milah and Rumple both stay behind to watch over the boat. Emma sees Hook and rescues him from being dropped into the green river.|$|R
