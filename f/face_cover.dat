50|$|The {{indicating}} {{system is}} almost always the traditional dial with moving hour and minute hands. Many clocks have a small third hand indicating seconds on a subsidiary dial. Pendulum clocks are usually designed to be set by opening the glass <b>face</b> <b>cover</b> and manually pushing the minute hand around the dial to the correct time. The minute hand is mounted on a slipping friction sleeve which allows it to be turned on its arbor. The hour hand is driven not from the wheel train but from the minute hand's shaft through a small set of gears, so rotating the minute hand manually also sets the hour hand.|$|E

Its unique five-storey exterior is akin to the honeycomb of a beehive with its 953 small windows called jharokhas decorated with intricate latticework.

40|$|A {{large amount}} of wool on the face (<b>face</b> <b>cover)</b> of Merino sheep has been {{regarded}} as a fault by Australian sheep breeders {{as it has been}} associated with poor reproduction rates. Fail & Dun (1956) and Drinan & Dun (1967) reported that the degree of <b>face</b> <b>cover</b> was negatively correlated with fertility, but Young, Turner & Dolling (1963) found no evidence of a genetic association. In a review of these factors, Turner & Young (1969) commented that degree of <b>face</b> <b>cover</b> had been related to reduced reproduction rates in various breeds of sheep in Australia, New Zealand and the United States but not in the Soviet Union. The degree of <b>face</b> <b>cover</b> of individual ewes changes with season, and during pregnancy and lactation, with pregnant and lactating ewes showing less <b>face</b> <b>cover</b> than their non-pregnant contemporaries in the same flock (Mullaney, 1965). Physiological status of the ewe could therefore influence phenotypic assessment and {{may have contributed to the}} conflict of opinion on the importance of <b>face</b> <b>cover</b> as a criterion of selection. In the course of experiments on diluents for ram semen involving the artificial insemination (AI) of fine-wool Merinos (Saxony strain), we were able to make observations on semen production and factors associated with oestrus and fertility, and relate these to the degree of <b>face</b> <b>cover</b> of ewes and rams.

40|$|In {{this study}} 307 Corriedale ewes in total bred at the Miyazaki, Tokachi, and Takikawa Stock Breeding Farms {{were used as}} {{experimental}} animals, and the wool yields(raw and clean yield) of one fleece and the wool qualities(stretched length and fineness of wool) of one sample taken from the mid-side region were estimated per animal per year(from spring, 1958 to spring, 1959) and then the <b>face</b> <b>cover</b> of each animal at shearing time in spring, 1959 scored by the classification into five grades of <b>face</b> <b>cover</b> and the relations between scores of <b>face</b> <b>cover</b> and wool yield, and wool qualifies were studied by investigating the phenotypic correlations. The results obtained from this study were as follows: 1) The raw and clean wool yields of whole fleece per animal per year showed a slightly increasing tendency as scores of <b>face</b> <b>cover</b> of the Corriedale ewes at shearing time increased. 2) The phenotypic correlations between scores of <b>face</b> <b>cover</b> at shearing time and live-weight just after shearing of ewes varied with flock and age of ewes, and on the whole those correlations, either positive or negative, {{were found to be}} low. 3) The phenotypic correlations between scores of <b>face</b> <b>cover</b> and stretched length, and fineness of wool also varied with flock and age of ewes and those correlations were generally found to be very low...|$|E
40|$|With {{respect to}} a given plane graph, G, a <b>face</b> <b>cover</b> {{is defined as a}} set of faces whose {{boundaries}} collectively contain every vertex in G. It is known that, when k is fixed, finding a cover of size k (if indeed any exist) can be accomplished in polynomial time. Recent improvements to <b>face</b> <b>cover</b> algorithms are based on the theory of fixed-parameter tractability and reductions to planar dominating set. A major goal has been to reduce the time required for branching, which is the most computationally-intensive aspect of fixed-parameter tractable methods. The fastest previously-known method for solving planar dominating set requires branching time O(8 kn). The main contribution of this paper is a direct and relatively simple O(5 kn) <b>face</b> <b>cover</b> branching algorithm.

40|$|The {{parameterized}} {{complexity of}} the <b>face</b> <b>cover</b> problem is considered. The input to this problem is a plane graph G with n vertices. The question asked is whether, for a given parameter value k, there exists a set of k or fewer faces whose boundaries collectively cover (contain) every vertex in G. Early attempts achieved run times of O∗(k 12) or worse, by reducing the problem into a special form of dominating set, namely red–blue dominating set, restricted to planar graphs. Here, we consider a direct approach, where some surgical operation is performed on the graph at each branching decision. This paper builds on previous work {{of the authors and}} employs a structure theorem of Aksionov et al., with a detailed case analysis, to produce a <b>face</b> <b>cover</b> algorithm that runs in O(k 4. 6056 +n 2) time. We also point to the tight connections with red–blue dominating set on planar graphs via the annotated version of <b>face</b> <b>cover</b> that we consider in our search tree algorithm. Hence, we get both a O(k 4. 6056 +n 2) time algorithm for solving red–blue dominating set on planar graphs and a polynomial time algorithm for producing a linear kernel for annotated <b>face</b> <b>cover.</b> PublishedN/...|$|E
