500|$|PewDiePie {{formerly}} put out videos {{with a high}} frequency, {{something he}} scaled down in 2014. By early 2017, he had uploaded almost 3,500 videos to his channel, around 400 {{of which have been}} made private. In March 2017, PewDiePie commented that his channel was running on a daily output, stating, [...] " [...] a lot of challenges in doing daily content, it's stupid. I really shouldn't be doing it, <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>should</b> just fucking go back and upload twice a week or some shit, and then take a step back, but I still really, really love the daily challenge—the daily grind—of just being like, 'hey, I'm gonna make a video today, no matter what.' And sometimes it really works, and sometimes it doesn't." ...|$|E
2500|$|At nearly 75 minutes, {{the album}} is one of Bowie's longest. When it was {{released}}, Bowie knew {{that could be a}} problem. He said, [...] "as soon as I released that I thought, 'It's much too fucking long. It's gonna die.' There's too much on it. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>should</b> have made it two CDs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No; but <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>should</b> enjoy {{showing him}} the old armour. He was {{asking me about}} it this morning. I think he knows nearly {{as much of it}} as we do.' ...|$|E
5000|$|Then repeat to yourself, [...] "It's just a show, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>really</b> just relax." ...|$|R
60|$|GEOFFREY Well, {{it sounds}} perhaps inhospitable, {{but do you}} know <b>I</b> <b>really</b> think <b>I</b> <b>should</b> ask you to take it away again.|$|R
6000|$|... 'If it {{were only}} {{somebody}} else, and I {{was one of}} the bridesmaids, <b>I</b> <b>really</b> think <b>I</b> <b>should</b> like it better!' she murmured one afternoon.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You know, Nuttie, {{it is not}} for my own pleasure, {{but your}} father's {{eyesight}} makes him dislike to go anywhere without me now; and <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>should</b> be uneasy about him.' ...|$|E
60|$|CAPT. G. 'Wish I hadn't, {{but they}} insist on falling sick. Minnie, if I were you <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>should</b> not {{investigate}} those papers. You may come across {{something that you}} won't like.|$|E
60|$|PRAED [to Mrs Warren] <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>should</b> be {{very sorry}} to cause you {{unnecessary}} pain; but I think perhaps {{you had better}} not wait. The fact is--[Vivie is heard at the inner door].|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, it's those dreadful mosquitoes; {{there were}} {{millions}} {{on board the}} steamer last night <b>I</b> <b>really</b> thought we <b>should</b> have been eaten up. Didn't you, mamma?' ...|$|R
60|$|MENDOZA. Just {{allow me}} to read a few lines {{before you go to}} sleep. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>really</b> like your opinion of them.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Dreadful! horrible!' Mr. Swancourt murmured privately; {{and said}} aloud, I thought we walked on board. <b>I</b> don't think <b>really</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have come, if I had known this trouble was {{attached}} to it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{very kind}} and delicate!" [...] said Mrs. Davilow, with much feeling. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>should</b> like {{better not to}} be {{dependent}} on a son-in-law. I and the girls could get along very well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{is nothing}} to forgive, Theresa. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>should</b> thank you. True, at first I suffered; and then, with all the graciousness of spring, it dawned upon me that I was happy, very happy. It was a most amazing discovery." ...|$|E
6000|$|VALENTINE. Thank you. (He {{takes the}} jug from her, and brings {{it to the}} cabinet, {{continuing}} in the same idle strain) <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>should</b> like to know your family, Mr. Crampton. (The parlor maid goes out: and he pours some hot water into the drinking glass.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{you wish}} {{we were in}} London now?" [...] she went on. [...] "You and <b>I</b> together? <b>I</b> <b>really</b> believe <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have to take you about. You're as {{innocent}} as a babe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>I</b> <b>really</b> don't see {{any harm}} {{in the book}} so far. It is by a famous author, wonderfully well written, as you know, and the {{characters}} so lifelike that I feel as if <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>really</b> meet them somewhere." ...|$|R
6000|$|Here Oldbuck broke in, {{his eyes}} {{sparkling}} with indignation. [...] "Sir Arthur, I have so often warned {{you of the}} knavery of that rascally quack, that <b>I</b> <b>really</b> wonder you <b>should</b> quote him to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{know that}} I love Pretty Goldilocks {{as much as}} ever, her refusal has not made any {{difference}} to me; but I don't {{know how to make}} her change her mind; <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>should</b> like to send you, to see if you can persuade her to marry me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, Mara, you and I {{have been}} {{together}} so much, I can't tell. We don't notice what goes on before us every day. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>should</b> {{like to see what}} Moses Pennel will think when he sees you. At any rate, he can't order you about with such a grand air as he used to when you were younger." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{well know}} what gormandizers they were," [...] replied Quicksilver; and rogue that he was, {{he could not}} help {{laughing}} at the joke. [...] "So you will not be surprised to hear that they have all taken the shapes of swine! If Circe had never done anything worse, <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>should</b> not think her so very much to blame." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Precisely!' said Gudrun. 'Think of the myriads {{of women}} that daren't do it. She makes the most of her privileges--that's something. <b>I</b> suppose, <b>really,</b> we <b>should</b> do the same, in her place.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nothing, nothing, my dear Darrell. This bêtise {{of a war}} {{has made}} us all serious. If old Clamstandt had not married that gipsy, little Dugiria, <b>I</b> <b>really</b> think <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have taken a turn to Belgrade.' ...|$|R
60|$|Jack. Well, I don't see how I could {{possibly}} manage to do that. I can produce the hand-bag at any moment. It {{is in my}} dressing-room at home. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> think that <b>should</b> satisfy you, Lady Bracknell.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perfectly; and if I were {{to speak}} my mind, which I do not {{hesitate}} to do in confidence to you, Miss Graves, <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>should</b> say {{that she is the}} most jealous, irritable, malicious, meddling, {{and at the same time}} fawning, disposition that I ever met with in the whole course of my life, and I speak from experience." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mr. Micawber's {{difficulties}} are almost overwhelming just at present,' said Mrs. Micawber; 'and {{whether it is}} possible to bring him through them, I don't know. When I lived at home with papa and mama, <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>should</b> have hardly understood what the word meant, in the sense in which I now employ it, but experientia does it,--as papa used to say.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, my dear, {{go on as}} you've begun, and I {{shall be}} more than satisfied. What merry-making is on foot to-night? Mark and these friends of his keep you in {{constant}} motion with their riding, rowing, and rambling excursions, and {{if it did not}} agree with you so excellently, <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>should</b> like a little quiet after a month of bustle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'After all,' {{continued}} Undy,' what he asks is not much, and <b>I</b> <b>really</b> {{think you}} <b>should</b> {{do it for}} him. He is quite willing to give you his assistance at Strathbogy, and he is entitled to some accommodation.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will see}} to it, boys," [...] the colonel said, smiling; [...] "but <b>really,</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> advise your staying there. You have done all--and more than--your share of work." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] she said. [...] "What <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>really</b> {{like more}} than {{anything}} would be an end of the world. I wish the world would come to an end." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{before we}} met the cook, we met Richard, who was dancing {{up and down}} Thavies Inn to warm his feet. He was agreeably {{surprised}} to see us stirring so soon {{and said he would}} gladly share our walk. So he took care of Ada, and Miss Jellyby and I went first. I may mention that Miss Jellyby had relapsed into her sulky manner and that <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>should</b> not have thought she liked me much unless she had told me so.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Lady Bertram," [...] said Mrs. Norris, {{moving to}} go, [...] "I {{can only say}} that my sole desire is to be of use to your family: and so, if Sir Thomas should ever speak again about my taking Fanny, {{you will be able to}} say that my health and spirits put it quite out of the question; besides that, <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>should</b> not have a bed to give her, for I must keep a spare room for a friend." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not feel}} so sure as I did that {{you have made a}} bad bargain, Monsieur Philip. As far as {{appearances}} go, at any rate, he would pass muster. Except that his cheeks want filling out a bit, he is a nimble, active-looking young fellow; and with that little moustache of his, and his hair cut short, he is by no means ill looking. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>should</b> not have known him. I think at present he means what he says, though whether he will stick to it is another matter, altogether." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{what you}} shan't have unless {{you promise to}} be good for a week. Such a Review; and from America! What a dear man he must be who wrote it! <b>I</b> <b>really</b> think <b>I</b> <b>should</b> kiss him if I met him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She is a {{delightful}} old woman," [...] cried John Effingham, [...] "and if twenty years younger and disposed {{to change her}} condition, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>really</b> be afraid to enter the house." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There will be {{nobody here}} to-night but our own circle," [...] said she to him, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>really</b> think you <b>should</b> tell Miss Dunstable what your {{intentions}} are. She will have fair ground to complain of {{you if you}} do not." ...|$|R
