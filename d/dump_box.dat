25|$|Shell mold casting is a {{metal casting}} process similar to sand casting, in that molten metal is poured into an {{expendable}} mold. However, in shell mold casting, the mold is a thin-walled shell created from applying a sand-resin mixture around a pattern. The pattern, a metal {{piece in the}} shape of the desired part, is reused to form multiple shell molds. A reusable pattern allows for higher production rates, while the disposable molds enable complex geometries to be cast. Shell mold casting requires the use of a metal pattern, oven, sand-resin mixture, <b>dump</b> <b>box,</b> and molten metal.|$|E

50|$|Galion Godwin Truck Body Co. {{was named}} after its {{founding}} city of Galion, Ohio and was founded {{as early as the}} 1870s. Originally known as Galion Buggy Company, the business was born from demand for horse-drawn transportation. A short time after its founding, Galion Buggy Company found a market for retrofitting hauling boxes onto existing buggies. Galion soon exited the competitive buggy manufacturing market for the more lucrative aftermarket hauling beds and <b>dump</b> <b>boxes.</b> Around 1910, Galion Buggy Company changed its name to Galion Allsteel Body Company as horse-drawn buggies were gradually being replaced by motor vehicles.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the early}} days of tunneling, {{excavation}} debris was hauled to the surface through small construction shafts and then to the lakefront by horse and wagon. By 1903, some excavation debris was being dumped onto scows for disposal in the lake. [...] In 1904, tunnels sloping up at a 9 percent grade to the Grant Park disposal station were opened, {{and the vast majority of}} excavation debris and ash was hauled out to fill Grant Park.

50|$|During the 80's {{several new}} dump trucks were {{developed}} and Moxy gained {{a good reputation}} in the market place and exported their products to several countries around the globe. In order to increase their production capacity Moxy cooperated with Tallmek Smøla AS, who produced the <b>dump</b> <b>boxes.</b> In the 80's Moxy started a cooperation with the Japanese company Komatsu. During one period Moxy produced dump trucks that Komatsu sold under their own brand name. In 1981 the Norwegian state owned company AS Olivin and Komatsu together acquired Moxy and changed the company name to Moxy Trucks AS. Olivin owned 2/3 and Komatsu 1/3 of the shares. The new owners injected fresh capital and the Moxy dump trucks were sold through the Komatsu sales network, {{which led to a}} large increase in sales.|$|R

50|$|An {{articulated}} dumper is an all-wheel drive, off-road dump truck. It has a hinge {{between the}} cab and the <b>dump</b> <b>box,</b> but is distinct from a semi-trailer truck in that the power unit is a permanent fixture, not a separable vehicle. Steering is accomplished via hydraulic cylinders that pivot the entire tractor {{in relation to the}} trailer, rather than rack and pinion steering on the front axle as in a conventional dump truck. By this way of steering, the trailers wheels follow the same path as the front wheels. Together with all-wheel drive and low center of gravity, it is highly adaptable to rough terrain. Major manufacturers include Volvo CE, Terex, John Deere and Caterpillar.|$|E

40|$|In a sense, food is “wasted ” {{every time}} it is {{acquired}} by individuals or households in excess of their actual individual or collective nutritional needs (Box 1). Quantities acquired in excess of needs might be actually eaten by humans (with the likely consequence of contributing to malnutrition {{in the form of}} overweight and obesity when the corresponding amount of excess energy is not burned away, often as a way to fuel the growing “fitness ” industry), reused as feed or food for pets, recycled as organic matter for compost or as fertilizer, or simply literally wasted in <b>dumps.</b> <b>Box</b> 1 The paradox of excess food consumption from the food insecurity perspective Many would argue that food consumption also serves functions other than nutrition and therefore it may be limiting to study adequacy of household’s food expenditures only through the nutritional lenses. There may be cultural, religious, and psychological needs that are fulfilled by consuming food either in excess or short of one’s actual nutritional needs, and the levels of food expenditure—economists would maintain—is one way of revealing the value that people attach to them. Nevertheless, we believe {{it is important to have}} an idea of the order of magnitude of such excessive consumption, given that the phenomenon has serious implications in terms of food security, from economic, social, and ecological points of view.

50|$|The {{original}} design of utility ATVs was offered from 1996 to 2004 and featured single cylinder {{liquid or air}} cooled motors from 250 to 500cc's, {{and all of a}} common design. This Arctic Cat-designed motor was manufactured by Suzuki and featured a 2V SOHC design with hemispherical combustion chambers. Manual and CVT automatic transmissions were offered. A 650V2 V-twin engine option borrowed from the Kawasaki Prairie was also offered starting in 2003. A major redesign of the platform was launched in 2005. With the new redesign came new body work, electronics, rear mounted gas tank and a standard front locking diff, though the chassis in general remained largely unchanged. A new high performance engine platform also debuted in the 650H1. This H1 platform was a direct evolution of the previous suzuki manufactured engines with many parts being interchangeable, but was now manufactured by Arctic Cat in the US. A 700EFI model was also offered which used an engine and transmission combo borrowed from the Suzuki king quad model. This is a 4V dohc design with no relation to the H1 engine platform. This was replaced with the 700H1 which was a higher displacement version of the 650H1 with fuel injection added. A 1000cc H2 V-twin engine, was also made available. Arctic Cat utility ATV's are primarily designed and marketed toward utilitarian uses such as farm work and hunting. Compared to other ATVs, they offer very high ground clearance, low gear ratios for towing, and large steel racks for hauling large loads, and large fuel tanks for extended range. The high ground clearance and locking differentials make them particularly adept off road. They also offer 2 up models, and the TBX model which features a large <b>dump</b> <b>box</b> and high payload capacity, and a Mud Pro model which features factory air snorkels to allow it to drive nearly submerged, larger mud tires, and stronger driveline components.|$|E

40|$|After the Second World War, dumping {{in lakes}} was a {{rational}} {{way to solve}} the security problem with the extensive amount of unreliable or unused ageing ammunition. Most commonly the ammunition was <b>dumped</b> in sealed <b>boxes</b> or as pieces. In some cases the ammunition was deliberately detonated when dumped. In Lake Lomtjärn, a small lake in central Sweden, extremely high levels of mercury (300 mg/kg dry weight Hg) were detected in the sediments. The mercury was expected to originate from years of dumping followed by an under-water self-explosion of ignition capsule containing mercury. The lake is unique {{in the sense that}} the mercury levels are among the highest found so far in Sweden and that no other source of pollutant is present in the area. The aim of this study was to evaluate the environmental impact from the underwater explosion. Samples of sediment, bottom water, surface water, bottom fauna, littoral fauna and fi sh (muscle and liver) were analysed for metals as well as physical parameters in order to investigate effects on biota. Acute toxicity of bottom water was determined by Daphnia magna. Results showed very high mercury content (2 – 338 mg/kg dry weight) in sediment down to 15 cm depth evenly distributed over the whole lake and low levels for other heavy metals (As, Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn).
