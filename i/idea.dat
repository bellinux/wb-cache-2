5|$|An overvalued <b>idea</b> is a {{false belief}} that is held with {{conviction}} but not with delusional intensity. Hypochondriasis is an overvalued <b>idea</b> that one is suffering from an illness, dysmorphophobia is an overvalued <b>idea</b> that a part of one's body is abnormal, and people with anorexia nervosa may have an overvalued <b>idea</b> of being thin.|$|E

50|$|There {{are strong}} <b>ideas</b> {{and there are}} faint <b>ideas.</b> We call strong <b>ideas</b> real things. They are regular, vivid, constant, distinct, orderly, and coherent. These strong <b>ideas</b> of sense are less {{dependent}} on the perceiver. <b>Ideas</b> of imagination, however, are less vivid and distinct. They are copies or images of strong <b>ideas</b> and are more {{the creation of a}} perceiver. Nevertheless, both strong and faint <b>ideas</b> are <b>ideas</b> and therefore exist only in a perceiver's mind.|$|R
40|$|Innate <b>ideas</b> are not {{objective}} <b>ideas</b> {{which have}} {{ceased to be}} doubtful. They are not <b>ideas</b> of attributes or modes but rather true realities. Therefore, they are simple, clear, and distinct. These <b>ideas</b> are not possible to analyze. Innate <b>ideas</b> are not conceived when thinking of "something" but when the real world is felt. Therefore, they correspond with objective <b>ideas...</b>|$|R

Many corporations have installed internal <b>ideas</b> banks to gather the input from their employees and improve their ideation process. Some <b>ideas</b> banks employ a voting system to estimate an <b>idea's</b> value. In some cases, <b>ideas</b> banks can be more humor-oriented than their serious counterparts.|$|R

5|$|Matt Groening {{originally}} {{pitched the}} <b>idea</b> that Homer would travel through time in Time and Punishment. His original <b>idea</b> {{was that the}} time-travel would {{be the result of}} Homer simply jamming his hand in the toaster, but it was rejected by the other writers.|$|E
5|$|Show runner Mike Scully had pitched an <b>idea</b> to Dan Greaney on Marge forcing Bart {{to become}} Ralph Wiggum's friend. Scully gave the <b>idea</b> to Greaney {{due to his}} ability to write Ralph's lines and actions well, and his overall liking of the character.|$|E
50|$|John Locke (1632-1704) was an empiricist at the {{beginning}} of the Modern period of philosophy. As such (and in contrast to René Descartes), he held that all of the objects of the understanding are <b>ideas,</b> where <b>ideas</b> exist in the mind. One of his goals in his work An Essay Concerning Human Understanding is to trace the origin of <b>ideas.</b> There are no innate <b>ideas</b> “stamped upon the mind” from birth, and all knowledge is rooted in experience. Further, there are also simple <b>ideas</b> and complex <b>ideas.</b> Simple <b>ideas</b> enter by the senses, and they are simple and unmixed. Complex <b>ideas</b> are simple <b>ideas</b> that have been combined and related together using the abstracting activity of the mind.|$|R
30|$|Step 3 : The {{results from}} the {{previous}} step are used to converge and organise the tentative list of drivers and trends. In this step a joint list of <b>ideas</b> are organised by applying the NGT procedure. <b>Ideas</b> are structured and grouped, some <b>ideas</b> are subsumed, redundant <b>ideas</b> are deleted, overlapping and interrelated <b>ideas</b> are merged, and reorganised <b>ideas</b> are levelled into a hierarchy. A common and shorter list is emerging.|$|R

5|$|The <b>idea</b> for {{the film}} {{originated}} in the 1990s from a conversation in which Prasad joked with Rajamouli about the <b>idea</b> of a fly seeking revenge against a human. Rajamouli reconsidered the <b>idea</b> after finishing Maryada Ramanna (2010), and Prasad developed it into a script. The film's production began on 7 December 2010 at Ramanaidu Studios in Hyderabad. Principal photography began on 22 February 2011 and continued until late February 2012. Makuta VFX and Annapurna Studios oversaw Eega visual effects and digital intermediate process, respectively.|$|E

5|$|A common <b>idea</b> in {{the comics}} is that Bruce saw a Zorro film {{with his parents}} before they were murdered. Nolan {{explained}} that by ignoring that <b>idea</b> – which he stated is not found in Batman's first appearances – it {{emphasized the importance of}} bats to Bruce and that becoming a superhero is a wholly original <b>idea</b> on his part. It is for this reason Nolan believes other DC characters do not exist in the universe of his film; otherwise, Wayne's reasons for taking up costumed vigilantism would have been very different.|$|E
25|$|Adventitious <b>ideas</b> {{are those}} {{concepts}} that we gain through sense experiences, <b>ideas</b> {{such as the}} sensation of heat, because they originate from outside sources; transmitting their own likeness rather than something else and something you simply cannot will away. <b>Ideas</b> invented by us, such as those found in mythology, legends, and fairy tales are created by us from other <b>ideas</b> we possess. Lastly, innate <b>ideas,</b> such as our <b>ideas</b> of perfection, are those <b>ideas</b> we have {{as a result of}} mental processes that are beyond what experience can directly or indirectly provide.|$|R

5000|$|The Sushruta Samhita and Caraka Samhita have {{religious}} <b>ideas</b> throughout, states Steven Engler, {{who then}} concludes [...] "Vedic elements are too central to be discounted as marginal". These <b>ideas</b> appear, for example, in the theoretical foundations and Vedic metaphors {{used in these}} texts. In addition, states Engler, the text includes another layer of <b>ideas,</b> where empirical rational <b>ideas</b> flourish in competition or cooperation with religious <b>ideas,</b> {{as well as the}} evidence of later additions of some Brahminic <b>ideas.</b>|$|R
5|$|A further {{suggestion}} is that Mari Lwyd derives from the English term Merry Lude, referring to a merry game. Peate opposed this <b>idea,</b> arguing that if the latter was converted into Welsh then {{the result would be}} merri-liwt or merri-liwd. Peate also dismissed the <b>idea</b> that had been suggested to him that the term Mari in this context had derived from Morris, a reference to Morris dance. Another reason to doubt this <b>idea</b> {{is that there is no}} known historical link between the Mari Lwyd, which was found in South Wales, and the Morris dance, which was concentrated in the north of the country.|$|E
5|$|A myth {{which is}} trait-based, though genetically impossible, is the <b>idea</b> {{that the modern}} Maine Coon descended from {{ancestors}} of semi-feral domestic cats and raccoons. This myth is likely based on the common color of the breed (brown tabby) and its bushy tail. Another <b>idea</b> is that the Maine Coon originated from the matings of domestic cats and wild bobcats, which could explain the tufts of hair that are so commonly seen on {{the tips of the}} ears.|$|E
5|$|Alongside the <b>idea</b> of {{the greater}} Elves, Tolkien also {{developed}} the <b>idea</b> of children visiting Valinor, the island-homeland of the Elves in their sleep. Elves would also visit children at night and comfort them {{if they had been}} chided or were upset. This theme, linking elves with children's dreams and nocturnal travelling was largely abandoned in Tolkien's later writing.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{developed}} a creativity support tool called IdeaCrepe that manages {{the history of}} <b>ideas</b> using a layered structure. Handling <b>ideas</b> with a creativity support tool that is able to record history is very useful for understanding these <b>ideas,</b> {{the evolution of the}} <b>ideas</b> over time, and the relationships between the <b>ideas.</b> Looking back through the history of creative activity may contribute to the further development of <b>ideas.</b> In this research, we introduce a concept of “layered structure ” based on a time series to manage the history. Using this structure, we can look back at past states of <b>ideas,</b> and examine their development. These features can manage the creation and modification of <b>ideas.</b> ...|$|R

The participants were four pre-service secondary mathematics teachers. The data were obtained from the lesson plans, the video records of the participants’ lessons, and the semi-structured interviews. When the data were analysed, the seven sub-codes of the pre-service teachers’ responding to students’ <b>ideas</b> were determined. These sub-codes were named as (a) repeating students’ <b>ideas,</b> (b) approving students’ <b>ideas,</b> (c) explaining and expanding students’ <b>ideas,</b> (d) answering students’ questions, (e) asking how students’ reached their <b>ideas,</b> (f) correcting mistakes in students’ <b>ideas,</b> and (g) ignoring students’ <b>ideas.</b> It is thought that these sub-codes would be helpful to examine pre-service mathematics teachers’ responding to students’ <b>ideas</b> in a detail way...|$|R

5|$|Another <b>idea</b> {{was the use}} of split screens, {{which was}} born out of the number of phone calls there were, and because of the element of real time, was used to trace {{parallel}} adventures of different characters, and aid in the connecting of characters. It was used by producers to point the audience to where to pay attention, as secondary stories often take place outside of the main plot. The <b>idea</b> of using boxes came later, which made shooting more flexible, as the shot could be cropped and reshaped inside the box. It was from here that the <b>idea</b> of using split screens as an artistic element came into the series.|$|E

One {{of them is}} the impropet function of <b>ideas</b> that Kant calls it transcendent function when we consider an external extension for our <b>ideas</b> in the case of which <b>ideas</b> plays a regulative role. The other function is that of the proper one that Kant calls it the immanent function of <b>ideas</b> when <b>ideas</b> merely is directed towards the pure concepts of understanding and their functions in which case the role of <b>ideas</b> would be regulative; namely to explain the unity and consistency of knowledge stemmed from understanding.

5|$|Early European astronomers such as Tycho Brahe {{identified}} {{new stars}} {{in the night sky}} (later termed novae), suggesting that the heavens were not immutable. In 1584 Giordano Bruno suggested that the stars were like the Sun, and may have other planets, possibly even Earth-like, in orbit around them, an <b>idea</b> that had been suggested earlier by the ancient Greek philosophers, Democritus and Epicurus, and by medieval Islamic cosmologists such as Fakhr al-Din al-Razi. By the following century, the <b>idea</b> of the stars being the same as the Sun was reaching a consensus among astronomers. To explain why these stars exerted no net gravitational pull on the Solar System, Isaac Newton suggested that the stars were equally distributed in every direction, an <b>idea</b> prompted by the theologian Richard Bentley.|$|E
