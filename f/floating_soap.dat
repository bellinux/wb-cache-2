A typical advertisement boasted that Swan was [...] "the white <b>floating</b> <b>soap</b> that's purer than the finest castiles". Lever and Procter & Gamble became embroiled in litigation over the process and products of it. Lever sued Procter & Gamble for patent infringement after the format of Ivory changed; the Appellate Court found that the patent had been infringed and Procter & Gamble were required to pay $5.675 million to Lever.|$|E

5000|$|Ivory's first slogan, [...] "It Floats!", was {{introduced}} in 1891. The product's other well-known slogan, [...] "% Pure" [...] (in use by 1895), {{was based on the}} results of an analysis by an independent laboratory the other founder's son, Harley Procter, hired to demonstrate that Ivory was purer than the castile soap then available.Ivory bar soap is whipped with air in its production and floats in water. According to an apocryphal story, later discounted by the company, a worker accidentally left the mixing machine on too long and the company chose to sell the [...] "ruined" [...] batch, because the added air did not change the basic ingredients of the soap. When appreciative letters about the new, <b>floating</b> <b>soap</b> inundated the company, P&G ordered the extended mix time as a standard procedure. However, company records indicate that the design of Ivory did not come about by accident. In 2004, over 100 years later, the P&G company archivist Ed Rider found documentation that revealed that chemist James N. Gamble, son of the founder, had discovered how to make the soap float and noted the result in his writings.|$|E

Gravity separation of solids is the primary treatment of sewage, where the unit process is called [...] "primary settling tanks" [...] or [...] "primary sedimentation tanks". It is also widely used {{for the treatment of}} other wastewaters. Solids that are heavier than water will accumulate at the bottom of quiescent settling basins. More complex clarifiers also have skimmers to simultaneously remove <b>floating</b> grease like <b>soap</b> scum and solids like feathers or wood chips. Containers like the API oil-water separator are specifically designed to separate non-polar liquids.|$|R

There were, we say, just a few pictures at the end of the Spelling-Book, little oval gray woodcuts of Bewick's, mostly of the Wolf and the Lamb, the Dog and the Shadow, and Brown, Jones, and Robinson with long ringlets and little tights; but for pictures, so to speak, what had we? The rough old wood-blocks in the old harlequin-backed fairy-books had served hundreds of years; before OUR Plancus, in the time of Priscus Plancus--in Queen Anne's time, who knows? We were flogged at school; we were fifty boys in our boarding-house, and had to wash in a leaden trough, under a cistern, with lumps of fat yellow <b>soap</b> <b>floating</b> about in the ice and water.

50|$|Foremost {{among the}} play's {{historical}} inspirations {{is the evidence}} that the Nazi regime had a program at the Danzig Anatomic Institute in 1944 to develop a process for the mass-production of soap from the fat of Jews being slaughtered in Nazi extermination camps, and produced soap in small quantities at a nearby concentration camp. In a dramatic moment, the players re-enact testimony from the Nuremberg Trials, including this recipe:"5 kilos of human fat are mixed with 10 liters of water and 500 or 1,000 grams of caustic soda. All this is boiled 2 or 3 hours and then cooled. The <b>soap</b> <b>floats</b> to the surface while the water and other sediment remain at the bottom. A bit of salt and soda is added to this mixture. Then fresh water is added and the mixture again boiled 2 or 3 hours. After having cooled, the soap is poured into molds."The play's central character, is an elderly Holocaust survivor called Milton Saltzman, based on actual survivor named Morris Spitzer who worked doggedly to establish as fact the idea that the Nazis produced and used soap made from human corpses, even handing bars of such soap to Jews on their way into the sealed chambers that functioned alternately as gas chambers and as shower rooms in the Nazi concentration camps.|$|R

The lead single from the album, [...] "Anna Sun", became a surprise {{hit in the}} summer of 2011 following an endorsement by the Esquire article [...] "30 Summer Songs Every Man Should Listen To". Written by Petricca and New York songwriter Nick Lerangis as their time at Kenyon College came to an end. [...] "It's about college, about maintaining that little bit of being a kid," [...] Petricca said. [...] "Don't be afraid to play." [...] The song was named after one of their favorite teachers (see here and here) It was named song of the summer by MTV and Seventeen Mag, and one of the top songs of the year by Amazon. It has been officially remixed by Fool's Gold and received a Trouble Productions remix by Robert Hammond Jr. Anna Sun rose to the number one spot on Alt. Nation on Sirius XM Radio. [...] "Anna Sun" [...] was added to the video rotation of American Eagle Outfitters stores in May 2011. It was featured on the hit TV show Vampire Diaries in the first episode of season three. It was also the free single of the week on iTunes for the week of May 15.Filmed in 2011 in Cincinnati's Over-the-Rhine neighborhood, the [...] "Anna Sun" [...] music video was released to coincide with the album. The video was shot on-location at the Cincinnati Mockbee building, as well as at a city park. It was directed and produced by Patrick Meier of the Cincinnati company, Contrast Productions, and features original choreography from Kim Popa of PONES Inc., as well as a cast full of the band's friends and locals from Cincinnati. MTV Hive calls the video a [...] "hilariously choreographed, neon-colored and awesomely shot in one take" [...] production.|$|R
