In order to encourage {{further development of}} <b>inland</b> waterway <b>transport</b> in this paper focus is set on {{the identification of the}} barriers that limit and prevent development of <b>inland</b> waterway <b>transport.</b> More specifically, emphasis is placed on the barriers that are preventing the cargo shifting from land to waterway transport system. Research conducted in case of Republic of Serbia investigates several barriers which are classified in four main categories: goods, logistics, infrastructure, framework conditions. Framework conditions barriers are further subdivided and classified in four subcategories: political/legal, environment, economy, technology. Results indicate that the most significant negative influence on the further development of the <b>inland</b> waterway <b>transport</b> in Serbia comes from the political/legal barriers. This result implies that the government need {{to pay more attention to}} development of <b>inland</b> waterway <b>transport,</b> as well as to make more effort to enhance the cooperation with stakeholders...|$|R
25|$|During the 19th century, {{globalization}} approached {{its form}} {{as a direct}} result of the Industrial Revolution. Industrialization allowed standardized production of household items using economies of scale while rapid population growth created sustained demand for commodities. In the 19th century, steamships reduced the cost of international transport significantly and railroads made <b>inland</b> <b>transport</b> cheaper. The transport revolution occurred some time between 1820 and 1850. More nations embraced international trade. Globalization in this period was decisively shaped by nineteenth-century imperialism such as in Africa and Asia. The invention of shipping containers in 1956 helped advance the globalization of commerce.|$|E
25|$|The Shimōsa Plateau has {{supported}} a population since ancient times, {{as evidenced by}} the large concentration of Jomon period kaizuka or shell middens across the plateau. The plateau was historically located in Shimōsa Province, after which it was named, and was a productive agricultural area prior to the industrialization of Japan. The area served to produce rice and vegetables as early as the Nara period. Ranches on the Shimōsa Plateau flatlands were developed to raise horses. Additionally, the network of rivers and canals provided for the <b>inland</b> <b>transport</b> of marine products from the Pacific Ocean to Edo. During the Edo period the Shimōsa Plateau saw large-scale development of new rice paddies by the Tokugawa shogunate, as well as the further development of horse ranches, specifically the Kogane and Sakura ranches to supply horses to the shogunate. The inland water routes from Chōshi were developed to supply rice, marine products, and vegetables directly to the capital at Edo.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} a model is {{developed}} to analyse {{and compare the}} transport costs of intermodal <b>inland</b> waterway <b>transport</b> and road-only-transport. The influence of the economies of scale in <b>inland</b> waterway <b>transport</b> and terminal operations {{are taken into account}} in the analysis. In the model the transport costs are defined and related to different transport operations and conditions (e. g. share of empty kilometres, capacity usage of terminals, etc.) in order to analyse the sensitivity of the cost performance of intermodal <b>inland</b> waterway <b>transport.</b> By doing this it is possible to analyse to what extent intermodal freight transport is competitive with road-only transport in terms of transport costs and specific operations and conditions (both in shipping and terminal). The conclusions prove that roundtrips, drop & pick operations in pre- and end-haulage and smaller containers (20 ft instead of 40 ft) considerably improve the competitiveness of intermodal <b>inland</b> waterway <b>transport,</b> while the relative high cost operations in small terminals reduce the competitiveness of intermodal <b>inland</b> waterway <b>transport...</b>|$|R

2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Industrial Revolution, <b>inland</b> <b>transport</b> was by navigable rivers and roads, with coastal vessels employed to move heavy goods by sea. Wagon ways were used for conveying coal to rivers for further shipment, but canals had not yet been widely constructed.

2500|$|Although Clement Attlee was {{no great}} radical himself, Attlee's {{government}} proved {{one of the}} most radical British governments of the 20th century, enacting Keynesian economic policies, presiding over a policy of nationalising major industries and utilities including the Bank of England, coal mining, the steel industry, electricity, gas, and <b>inland</b> <b>transport</b> (including railways, road haulage and canals). It developed and implemented the [...] "cradle to grave" [...] welfare state conceived by the economist William Beveridge. To this day, most people in the United Kingdom see the 1948 creation of Britain's National Health Service (NHS) under health minister Aneurin Bevan, which gave publicly funded medical treatment for all, as Labour's proudest achievement. Attlee's government also began the process of dismantling the British Empire when it granted independence to India and Pakistan in 1947, followed by Burma (Myanmar) and Ceylon (Sri Lanka) the following year. At a secret meeting in January 1947, Attlee and six cabinet ministers, including Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin, decided to proceed with the development of Britain's nuclear weapons programme, in opposition to the pacifist and anti-nuclear stances of a large element inside the Labour Party.|$|E

40|$|Future {{climate change}} is {{expected}} to affect <b>inland</b> waterway <b>transport</b> in most main natural waterways in Europe. For the river Rhine it is expected that, in summer, more and longer periods with low water levels will occur. In periods of low water levels inland waterway vessels have to reduce their load factors and, as a result, transport prices per tonne will increase. One possible consequence of these higher transport prices is a deterioration of the competitive position of <b>inland</b> waterway <b>transport</b> compared with rail and road transport, and thus a change in modal split. We study this issue using a GIS-based software model called NODUS which provides a tool for the detailed analysis of freight transportation over extensive multimodal networks. We assess the effect of low water levels on the costs of <b>transport</b> operations for <b>inland</b> waterway <b>transport</b> in North West Europe under several climate scenarios. It turns out, that {{the effect on the}} modal split is limited. Under the most extreme climate scenario, <b>inland</b> waterway <b>transport</b> would lose about 5. 4 % of the quantity that is currently being transported annually in the part of the European <b>inland</b> waterway <b>transport</b> market considered.
