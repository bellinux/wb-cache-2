50|$|A {{chromosome}} in a diploid organism is hemizygous {{when only}} one copy is present. The cell or organism {{is called a}} <b>hemizygote.</b> Hemizygosity is also observed when one copy of a gene is deleted, or in the heterogametic sex when a gene is located on a sex chromosome. Hemizygosity must {{not be confused with}} haploinsufficiency, which describes a mechanism for producing a phenotype. For organisms in which the male is heterogametic, such as humans, almost all X-linked genes are hemizygous in males with normal chromosomes because they have only one X chromosome and few of the same genes are on the Y chromosome. Transgenic mice generated through exogenous DNA microinjection of an embryo's pronucleus are also considered to be hemizygous because the introduced allele is expected to be incorporated into only one copy of any locus. A transgenic can later be bred to homozygosity and maintained as an inbred line to reduce the need to confirm the genotypes of each litter.|$|E
40|$|Platelets from {{patients}} with various genetically determined forms of photoreceptor dystrophy {{and with the}} clinical manifestations of retinitis pigmentosa (RP) have been studied. Variations in protein content have been observed, with less than normal in multiplex RP (probably autosomal recessive inheritance) and more in platelets {{from patients}} with autosomal dominant RP. This may reflect variation in platelet size or in surface adsorption of plasma proteins. Several patients presented with thrombocytopenia, the mean platelet count for X-linked <b>hemizygote</b> patients, as a group, being significantly lower than normal. Accumulation of 3 H-taurine has been studied in platelets incubated in Ca 2 +-free Krebs bicarbonate medium containing 1. 0 microM or 60. 0 microM taurine, and in autologous plasma. Although, in general, platelets from patients with RP showed normal taurine uptake, {{the capacity of the}} higher affinity carrier was increased in patients with X-linked <b>hemizygote</b> and multiplex disease. In contrast, plasma from patients with X-linked <b>hemizygote</b> RP reduced the platelet tissue to medium ratio, established for 3 H-taurine uptake, by 20 %.

40|$|THE X-linked {{condition}} hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) deficiency may {{be either}} gross or moderate in degree and is invariably associated with overproduction of urate in the <b>hemizygote</b> 1, 2. In addition, however, the gross deficiency state (Lesch-Nyhan syndrome) 3 also manifests with mental deficiency, choreoathetosis, spasticity and self-mutilation. Fibroblasts from heterozygotes for the gross deficiency state display mosaicism, some having normal HGPRT activity and others the reduced HGPRT activity {{characteristic of the}} <b>hemizygote</b> 4. However, HGPRT activity in erythrocyte lysates from such heterozygotes is normal. Heterozygotes for the moderate HGPRT deficiency state, on the other hand, have HGPRT activity in erythrocyte lysates ranging between 20 % of normal and completely normal values 5. To elucidate this, we have developed an autoradiographic procedure to show HGPRT activity in individual erythrocytes. In families with moderate HGPRT deficiency, in whom erythrocytes of the <b>hemizygote</b> were not significantly labelled by this procedure, heterozygotes showed two erythrocyte populations, one deficient in HGPRT and one containing HGPRT activity. On the other hand, in families whose HGPRT deficiency was gross and manifested as the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, heterozygotes showed only the normal pattern of labelling. Thus, mosaicism was present in erythrocytes from heterozygotes for moderate, but not for gross, HGPRT deficiency. The former finding supports the Lyon hypothesis 6 whereas, the latter finding suggests that either the X chromosome carrying the mutant HGPRT gene is preferentially inactivated, or the X chromosome is randomly inactivated with later selection against the erythrocyte precursors containing the mutant HGPRT enzyme...|$|E

In {{this study we}} analyzed the distribution of HDL subclasses in plasmas of four <b>hemizygotes</b> for this mutation. We also investigated the abilities of these plasmas to esterify cholesterol and to promote cholesterol efflux. Residual apoA-I-containing lipoproteins in plasmas of <b>hemizygotes</b> for apoA-I(L 141 R) Pisa correspond to pre beta 1 -LpA-I and small alpha-LpA-I. Unlike normal pre beta 1 -LpA-I, pre beta 1 -LpA-I of apoA-I(L 141 R) Pisa <b>hemizygotes</b> was not converted into a larger alpha-migrating particle. Plasmas of apoA-I(L 141 R) Pisa <b>hemizygotes</b> were significantly reduced in their activity to esterify cholesterol in either endogenous or exogenous lipoproteins. Cholesterol efflux capacity was significantly {{lower than that of}} normal plasma. Efflux of [3 H] cholesterol from radiolabeled fibroblasts into apoB-depleted plasma of normal probands was biphasic with fast cholesterol efflux occurring in the first minute. Thereafter, cholesterol efflux was slow and unsaturable. After incubation with radiolabeled fibroblasts, efflux values of [3 H]cholesterol into apoB-depleted plasma from normal controls and from apoA-I(L 141 R) Pisa <b>hemizygotes</b> were indistinguishable at 1 min. Longer incubations with apoB-free plasma from apoA-I(L 141 R) Pisa <b>hemizygotes</b> did not, however, lead to the unsaturable increase in cholesterol efflux that was observed during incubations with apoB-free plasma of normolipidemic probands. Pre beta 1 -LpA-I of apoA-I(L 141 R) Pisa <b>hemizygotes</b> took up significantly less cell-derived [3 H]cholesterol than pre beta 1 -LpA-I of normal donors. We conclude that apoA-I(L 141 R) Pisa interferes with the formation of lipid-rich alpha-HDL but not with that of lipid-poor pre beta 1 -LpA-I.

40|$|Efforts were {{directed}} to identify the specific mutations in the alpha-galactosidase A (alpha-Gal A) gene which cause Fabry disease in families of Japanese origin. By polymerase-chain-reaction-amplification of DNA from reverse-transcribed mRNA and genomic DNA, different point mutations were found in two unrelated Fabry hemizygotes. A <b>hemizygote</b> with classic disease manifestations and no detectable alpha-Gal A activity had a G-to-A transition in exon 1 (codon 44) which substituted a termination codon (TAG) for a tryptophan codon (TGG) and created an NheI restriction site.

In an unrelated Japanese <b>hemizygote</b> who had an atypical clinical course characterized by late-onset cardiac involvement and significant residual alpha-Gal activity, a G-to-A transition in exon 6 (codon 301) resulted in the replacement of a glutamine for an arginine residue.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} causing {{persistence of}} embryonal cells that later {{give rise to}} tumors is unknown. One tumorigenic factor in the embryonal childhood tumor neuroblastoma is the MYCN protooncogene. Here we show that normal mice developed neuroblast hyperplasia in paravertebral ganglia at birth that completely regressed by 2 weeks of age. In contrast, ganglia from MYCN transgenic (TH-MYCN) mice demonstrated a marked increase in neuroblast hyperplasia and MycN expression during week 1. Regression of neuroblast hyperplasia was then delayed and incomplete before neuroblastoma tumor formation at 6 and 13 weeks in homo- and <b>hemizygote</b> mice, respectively. Paravertebral neuronal cells cultured from perinatal TH-MYCN mice exhibited 3 - to 10 -fold resistance to nerve growth factor (NGF) withdrawal, compared with normal mice. Both low- and high-affinity NGF receptors were expressed in perinatal neuroblast hyperplasia but not in neuroblastoma tumor tissue. MYCN transgene amplification was present at low levels in perinatal neuroblast hyperplasia from both homo- and <b>hemizygote</b> TH-MYCN mice. However, only in hemizygous mice did tumor formation correlate with a stepwise increase {{in the frequency of}} MYCN amplification. These data suggest that inappropriate perinatal MycN expression in paravertebral ganglia cells from TH-MYCN mice initiated tumorigenesis by altering the physiologic process of neural crest cell deletion.

40|$|Allelic {{exclusion}} at the T {{cell receptor}} alpha locus TCR-alpha is incomplete, {{as demonstrated by}} the presence of a number of T lymphocyte clones carrying two expressed alpha chain products. Such dual alpha chain T cells have been proposed {{to play a role in}} autoimmunity, for example, because of a second TCR-alpha beta pair having bypassed negative selection by virtue of low expression. We examined this hypothesis by generating mice of various autoimmunity-prone strains carrying a hemizygous targeted disruption of the TCR-alpha locus, therefore unable to produce dual alpha chain T cells. Normal mice have a low but significant proportion of T cells expressing two cell-surface TCR-alpha chains that could be enumerated by comparison to TCR-alpha <b>hemizygotes,</b> which have none. Susceptibility to various autoimmune diseases was analyzed in TCR-alpha <b>hemizygotes</b> that had been backcrossed to disease-prone strains for several generations.

The method involved a simple PCR reaction with four primers.

Phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP) concentrations in erythrocytes from heterozygotes for HGPRT deficiency were shown to correlate inversely with HGPRT activities and directly with APRT activities in erythrocyte lysates. Since no evidence of increased synthesis of PRPP was obtained, these elevated PRPP concentrations can best be attributed to reduced utilization of PRPP in the HGPRT-catalyzed reaction.

40|$|Background: 22 q 11. 2 {{deletion}} syndrome (22 q 11 DS) {{is caused}} by a microdeletion on chromosome 22 q 11. 2 and associated with an increased risk to develop psychosis. The gene coding for catechol-O-methyl-transferase (COMT) is located at the deleted region, resulting in disrupted dopaminergic neurotransmission in 22 q 11 DS, which may contribute to the increased vulnerability for psychosis. A dysfunctional motivational reward system {{is considered one of the}} salient features in psychosis and thought to be related to abnormal dopaminergic neurotransmission. The functional anatomy of the brain reward circuitry has not yet been investigated in 22 q 11 DS. Methods: This study aims to investigate neural activity during anticipation of reward and loss in adult patients with 22 q 11 DS. We measured blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) activity in 16 patients with 22 q 11 DS and 12 healthy controls during a monetary incentive delay task using a 3 T Philips Intera MRI system. Data were analysed using SPM 8. Results: During anticipation of reward, the 22 q 11 DS group alone displayed significant activation in bilateral middle frontal and temporal brain regions. Compared to healthy controls, significantly less activation in bilateral cingulate gyrus extending to premotor, primary motor and somatosensory areas was found. During anticipation of loss, the 22 q 11 DS group displayed activity in the left middle frontal gyrus and anterior cingulate cortex, and relative to controls, they showed reduced brain activation in bilateral (pre) cuneus and left posterior cingulate. Within the 22 q 11 DS group, COMT Val <b>hemizygotes</b> displayed more activation compared to Met <b>hemizygotes</b> in right posterior cingulate and bilateral parietal regions during anticipation of reward. During anticipation of loss, COMT Met <b>hemizygotes</b> compared to Val <b>hemizygotes</b> showed more activation in bilateral insula, striatum and left anterior cingulate. Conclusions: This is the first study to investigate reward processing in 22 q 11 DS. Our preliminary results suggest that people with 22 q 11 DS engage a fronto-temporal neural network. Compared to healthy controls, people with 22 q 11 DS primarily displayed reduced activity in medial frontal regions during reward anticipation.

The relative contribution of these frontostriatal mechanisms to ADHD symptoms and their genetic determinants is largely unexplored. METHODS: Using {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} and genetic analysis of the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene, we investigated how striatal and inferior frontal activation patterns contribute to ADHD symptoms depending on MAOA genotype in a sample of adolescent boys (n = 190). RESULTS: We demonstrate an association of ADHD symptoms with distinct blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) responses depending on MAOA genotype. In A <b>hemizygotes</b> of the expression single nucleotide polymorphism rs 12843268, which express lower levels of MAOA, ADHD symptoms are associated with lower ventral striatal BOLD response during the monetary incentive delay task and lower inferior frontal gyrus BOLD response during the stop signal task.

Administration {{of a free}} radical scavenger ameliorates the embryotoxicity of hydroxyurea, suggesting that oxidative stress mediates this toxicity. The goal of this thesis was {{to test the hypothesis}} that superoxide, a reactive oxygen species, is involved.

40|$|BackgroundAttention-deficit/hyperactivity {{disorder}} (ADHD) {{is characterized}} by deficits in reward sensitivity and response inhibition. The relative contribution of these frontostriatal mechanisms to ADHD symptoms and their genetic determinants is largely unexplored. MethodsUsing {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} and genetic analysis of the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene, we investigated how striatal and inferior frontal activation patterns contribute to ADHD symptoms depending on MAOA genotype in a sample of adolescent boys (n = 190). ResultsWe demonstrate an association of ADHD symptoms with distinct blood oxygen level–dependent (BOLD) responses depending on MAOA genotype. In A <b>hemizygotes</b> of the expression single nucleotide polymorphism rs 12843268, which express lower levels of MAOA, ADHD symptoms are associated with lower ventral striatal BOLD response during the monetary incentive delay task and lower inferior frontal gyrus BOLD response during the stop signal task. In G <b>hemizygotes,</b> ADHD symptoms are associated with increased inferior frontal gyrus BOLD response during the stop signal task in the presence of increased ventral striatal BOLD response during the monetary incentive delay task. ConclusionsDepending on MAOA genotype, ADHD symptoms in adolescent boys are associated with either reward deficiency or insufficient response inhibition. Apart from its mechanistic interest, our finding may aid in developing pharmacogenetic markers for ADHD...|$|R
40|$|Fabry's {{disease is}} an X-linked {{recessive}} genetic deficiency of the enzyme alpha-galactosidase A, {{which leads to}} the pathologic deposition of neutral glycosphingolipids in lysosomes of the vascular endothelium of the heart, brain and kidney. The disease is progressive in hemizygous male patients, with increasing involvement of the major organs leading to death. Because cardiac involvement is a constant feature, echocardiograms were performed on 35 patients with Fabry's disease, 23 <b>hemizygotes</b> (aged 28. 6 ± 14 years) and 12 heterozygotes (aged 31. 6 ± 6 years), to determine whether cardiac involvement could be detected noninvasively. The results demonstrated that hemizygous male patients had a greater aortic root diameter, thicker interventricular septum and greater ventricular mass than did heterozygous female patients. Left ventricular mass per square meter of body surface area correlated well with clinical disease severity (r = 0. 68, p 25 years old) had more severe evidence of cardiac disease than did younger male patients. Although mitral valve prolapse was identified in 12 (54 %) of 23 male <b>hemizygotes</b> and in 7 (58 %) of 12 female heterozygotes, its presence did not correlate with clinical disease severity or other echocardiographic variables. Therefore, echocardiographic evidence of Fabry's disease appears to correlate with age-related disease severity and may be a useful noninvasive marker to follow disease progression and possible regression when appropriate therapy becomes available...|$|R
40|$|The X-linked, cold-sensitive zygotic lethal, l(1) TW- 6 cs, both in {{homozygous}} and heterozygous females, induces nondisjunction of {{all four}} chromosomes at Meiosis I at both 25 ° and 17 °. Nondisjunction frequencies approaching 0. 5 for the X and fourth chromosomes have been observed at 16 °– 18 °. The disjunction of the X chromosomes in males is not affected. The mutant causes mitotic irregularities in zygotes at both 25 ° and 17 °. Mortality of all zygotes produced by the crosses 6 cs/ 6 cs x 6 cs/BsY and FM 7 / 6 cs x 6 cs/BsY is respectively 86 % and 67 – 74 % at 25 ° and 99. 8 – 99. 9 % and 94 % at 17 °. The mortality of 6 cs <b>hemizygotes</b> derived from females carrying no doses of 6 cs (C(1) DX,y f/y x 6 cs/BsY) is 45 – 55 % at 25 ° and 98 % at 17 °. The length of the temperature-sensitive period for 6 cs homo- and <b>hemizygotes</b> {{is affected by the}} maternal dosage of 6 cs; the shortest TSP is for zero and the longest is for two maternal doses. Mortality takes place primarily during embryogenesis with some larval and little pupal mortality. Analysis of sectioned embryos indicates that the large array of different patterns of damage observed could have arisen from abnormal cleavage divisions and the incomplete population of the blastoderm with nuclei...|$|R
40|$|Chromosomal instability, which {{involves}} the deletion and duplication of chromosomes or chromosome parts, {{is a common}} feature of cancers, and deficiency screens are commonly used to detect genes involved in various biological pathways. However, despite their importance, the effects of deficiencies, duplications, and chromosome losses on the regulation of whole chromosomes and large chromosome domains are largely unknown. Therefore, to explore these effects, we examined expression patterns of genes in several Drosophila deficiency hemizygotes and a duplication <b>hemizygote</b> using microarrays. The results indicate that genes expressed in deficiency hemizygotes are significantly buffered, and that the buffering effect is general rather than being mainly mediated by feedback regulation of individual genes. In addition, differentially expressed genes in haploid condition appear to be generally more strongly buffered than ubiquitously expressed genes in haploid condition, but, among genes present in triploid condition, ubiquitously expressed genes are generally more strongly buffered than differentially expressed genes. Furthermore, we show that the 4 th chromosome is compensated in response to dose differences. Our results suggest general mechanisms have evolved that stimulate or repress gene expression of aneuploid regions as appropriate, and on the 4 th chromosome of Drosophila this compensatio...|$|E
40|$|Tandemly arrayed {{duplicate}} {{genes are}} prevalent. The maize A 1 -b haplotype is a tandem duplication {{that consists of}} the components, α and β. The rate of meiotic unequal recombination at A 1 -b is ninefold higher when a homolog is present than when it is absent (i. e., <b>hemizygote).</b> When a sequence heterologous homolog is available, 94 % of recombinants (264 / 281) are generated via recombination with the homolog rather than with the sister chromatid. In addition, 83 % (220 / 264) of homolog recombination events involved α rather than β. These results indicate that: (1) the homolog is the preferred template for unequal recombination and (2) pairing of the duplicated segments with the homolog does not occur randomly but instead favors a particular configuration. The choice of recombination template (i. e., homolog vs. sister chromatid) affects the distribution of recombination breakpoints within a 1. Rates of unequal recombination at A 1 -b {{are similar to the}} rate of recombination between nonduplicated a 1 alleles. Unequal recombination is therefore common and is likely to be responsible for the generation of genetic variability, even within inbred lines...|$|E
40|$|Multigenic {{influences}} {{are major}} contributors to human genetic disorders. Since humans are highly polymorphic, {{there are a}} high number of possible detrimental, multiallelic gene pairs. The actin cytoskeleton of yeast was used to determine the potential for deleterious bigenic interactions; ∼ 4800 complex <b>hemizygote</b> strains were constructed between an actin-null allele and the nonessential gene deletion collection. We found 208 genes that have deleterious complex haploinsufficient (CHI) interactions with actin. This set is enriched for genes with gene ontology terms shared with actin, including several actin-binding protein genes, and nearly half of the CHI genes have defects in actin organization when deleted. Interactions were frequently seen with genes for multiple components of a complex or with genes involved in the same function. For example, many of the genes for the large ribosomal subunit (RPLs) were CHI with act 1 Δ and had actin organization defects when deleted. This was generally true of only one RPL paralog of apparently duplicate genes, suggesting functional specialization between ribosomal genes. In many cases, CHI interactions could be attributed to localized defects on the actin protein. Spatial congruence in these data suggest that the loss of binding to specific actin-binding proteins causes subsets of CHI interactions...|$|E
40|$|Transgenic mice that {{differed}} in their p 53 genetic status {{were exposed to}} an acute dose of highly charged and energetic (HZE) iron particle radiation. Micronuclei (MN) in two distinct populations of circulating peripheral blood erythrocytes, the immature reticulocytes (RETs) and the mature normochromatic erythrocytes (NCEs), were measured using a simple and efficient flow cytometric procedure. Our results show significant elevation {{in the frequency of}} micronucleated RETs (%MN-RETs) at 2 and 3 days post-radiation. At 3 days post-irradiation, the magnitude of the radiation-induced MN-RET was 2. 3 -fold higher in the irradiated p 53 wild-type animals compared to the unirradiated controls, 2. 5 -fold higher in the p 53 <b>hemizygotes</b> and 4. 3 -fold higher in the p 53 nullizygotes. The persistence of this radiation-induced elevation of MN-RETs is dependent on the p 53 genetic background of the animal. In the p 53 wild-type and p 53 <b>hemizygotes,</b> %MN-RETs returned to control levels by 9 days post-radiation. However, elevated levels of %MN-RETs in p 53 nullizygous mice persisted beyond 56 days post-radiation. We also observed elevated MN-NCEs in the peripheral circulation after radiation, but the changes in radiation-induced levels of MN-NCEs appear dampened compared to those of the MN-RETs for all three strains of animals. These results suggest that the lack of p 53 gene function {{may play a role in}} the iron particle radiation-induced genomic instability in stem cell populations in the hematopoietic system...|$|R
40|$|We have {{discovered}} in the X-linked androgen receptor gene a single exonic nucleotide substitution that causes complete androgen insensitivity (resistance) in a sibship with three affected individuals. The mutation, a guanine-to-adenine transition, occurs at nucleotide number 2682 and changes the sense of codon 717 from tryptophan to a translation stop signal. Codon 717 is in exon 4, so the mutation predicts the synthesis of a truncated receptor that lacks most of its androgen-binding domain. The substitution abolishes a recognition sequence for the restriction endonuclease HaeIII. Amplification of exon 4 by the polymerase chain reaction followed by double digestion with HinfI and HaeIII permits facile recognition of <b>hemizygotes</b> and heterozygous carriers of the mutation...|$|R
40|$|Mutations at the apterous (ap) locus in Drosophila melanogaster {{give rise}} to three {{distinct}} phenotypes: aberrant wings, female sterility and precocious adult death. The wing phenotype includes five types of abnormality: blistering, deficiencies, duplications, high-order repetitions and transformation of structures. The mildest phenotype is seen with homozygous apblt animals which have either normal or slightly blistered wings. Most alleles produce, in the homozygote, a deficient wing in which part {{or all of the}} wing margin and wing blade is missing, but wing hinge and notum regions are normal. Animals hemizygous for each of 20 ap alleles, as well as apID/apXa heterozygotes, show duplication of parts of the notum associated with complete wing deficiency. Animals heterozygous for apc and the other tested ap alleles show repetitions of parts of the anterior wing margin, an engrailed-like transformation of posterior wing margin into anterior margin or both. Both apblt and apc show similar phenotypes in homozygotes and <b>hemizygotes,</b> yet both produce a less extreme phenotype than that of the other <b>hemizygotes,</b> suggesting that neither mutation causes loss of the entire ap+ function. The 15 alleles that cause precocious death and female sterility occur in six complementation groups based on complementation for these phenotypes. This supports the previous conclusion that the effects of apterous mutations on the wing do not correlate with their effects on viability and fertility. We propose an explanation for the effects of apterous mutations on the wing in which quantitative reductions in the activity of gene product {{give rise to}} qualitatively different phenotypes because of different threshold requirements of the ap+ function for critical events in wing disc development...|$|R
