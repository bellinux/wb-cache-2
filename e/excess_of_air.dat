40|$|Fuels {{derived from}} biomass are an {{alternative}} {{solution for the}} fossil fuel shortage. Usually this kind of fuels is called low calorific value fuels, due to the large proportion of inert components in their composition. The most common is carbon dioxide, and its proportion in biogas can be different, from 10 up to 40 %, or even more. The presence of inert component {{in the composition of}} biogas causes the problems that are related with flame blow off limits. One of the possibilities for efficient combustion of biogas is the combustion in swirling flow including a pilot burner, aimed to expand the borders of stable combustion. This paper presents an analysis of the influence of the carbon dioxide content to the nitrogen oxides emissions. Laboratory biogas was used with different content of CO 2 (10, 20, 30 and 40 %). Investigation was carried out for different nominal powers, coefficients <b>of</b> <b>excess</b> <b>air</b> and carbon dioxide content. With increasing content of carbon dioxide, emission of nitrogen oxides was reduced, and this trend was the same throughout the whole range <b>of</b> <b>excess</b> <b>air,</b> carried out through measurements. Still, the influence of carbon dioxide content is significantly less than the influence <b>of</b> <b>excess</b> <b>air.</b> The coefficient <b>of</b> <b>excess</b> <b>air</b> greatly affects the production of radicals which are essential for the formation of nitrogen oxides, O, OH and CH. Also, the results show that the nominal power has no impact on the emission of nitrogen oxides...|$|R

When a piper plays, a rhythm is set up between blowing into the blowstick and squeezing the bag. Often, a piper will over-squeeze the bag while still exhaling, causing a pipe to cease to sound or to vary its tone and pitch.|$|E

40|$|The present work {{presents}} {{a model that}} is composed of a conventional boiler model with a main counterflow gas-water heat exchanger at which a condensing heat exchanger is added. Prior to the second heat exchanger the exhaust gas are converted to equivalent wet air as the wet heat exchanger is simulated by a cooling coil used in air treatment. Six parameters are needed for calculation and these parameters are fitted with experimental data: one test in dry regime and one test in wet regime. Steady-state tests have been performed on two household boilers (a gas-fired and a fuel oil boiler), whose nominal outputs are 24 kW in order to fit the model parameters and check the model behaviour. It seems that the model gives the correct trend for the thermal efficiency prediction. Besides, combustion controls sensors (non nernstian sensors) have been tested by varying the <b>excess</b> <b>of</b> <b>air.</b> In the range tested (from = 1. 05 to = 1. 25), {{the increase in the}} boiler efficiency is around 1 % as the <b>excess</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> decreases.

Birkeland used a nearby hydroelectric power station for the electricity as this process demanded about 15 MWh/Ton of nitric acid.

40|$|Tourism {{has been}} critiqued as an {{environmentally}} destructive industry {{on account of}} the greenhouse gas emissions associated with tourist mobility. From a policy perspective, current and projected growth in aviation is fundamentally incompatible with radical emissions reduction and decarbonisation of the global energy system. Efforts to address the aviation-climate change ‘policy clash’ must be informed by an understanding of public sentiments towards climate change, air travel and carbon mitigation. This article examines how consumers across four western nations are responding to the environmental <b>excesses</b> <b>of</b> contemporary <b>air</b> travel consumption. It focuses on individual receptiveness to voluntarily measures aimed at changing flying behaviours, industry responses and degrees of government regulation. Its theoretical context harnesses lessons from public health to inform a discussion of bottom up (social marketing, nudge) and top down (government regulation) approaches to the urgent challenge <b>of</b> radical <b>air</b> travel emissions reduction. The findings of its comparative empirical analysis are presented, based upon 68 in-depth interviews conducted in Norway, the United Kingdom, Germany and Australia. We highlight contrasts in how consumers are beginning to internalise and process the environmental <b>excesses</b> <b>of</b> contemporary <b>air</b> travel consumption. Whereas voluntary measures, such as carbon off-setting, are viewed with widespread scepticism, divergence was found across the four study contexts in willingness to accept regulatory measures. Norwegians were far more willing to accommodate strong government intervention through taxation, whereas participants from the other three nations favoured softer strategies that are not perceived as restricting individual freedoms to travel. We conclude that voluntary approaches will be insufficient alone, and that behavioural change in public flying behaviour requires diverse policy measures. These must be informed by insights into the public’s willingness to palate stronger mitigation interventions, which varies within and between societies...|$|R
