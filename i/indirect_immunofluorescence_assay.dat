40|$|Since the {{discovery}} of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) as the causative agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome in 1983, {{there has been a}} proliferation of diagnostic tests. These assays can be used to detect the presence of HIV antibody, HIV antigen, HIV ribonucleic and deoxyribonucleic acids, and HIV reverse transcriptase. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, Western blot, radioimmunoprecipitation <b>assays,</b> <b>indirect</b> <b>immunofluorescence</b> <b>assays,</b> reverse transcriptase assays, and several molecular hybridization techniques are currently available. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent, Western blot, and <b>indirect</b> <b>immunofluorescence</b> <b>assays</b> for HIV antibody are very sensitive, specific, and adaptable to most laboratories. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HIV antigen is also readily adaptable to most laboratories and will be commercially available soon. While the other assays are more tedious, they are valuable confirmatory tests and are suitable for reference laboratories. The biohazards of performing HIV testing can be minimized with proper biosafety measures...|$|R
40|$|Ixodid tick-associated spirochetes {{have been}} implicated as the {{etiological}} agents of Lyme disease. We raised a murine monoclonal antibody (H 5332) against a spirochete, strain B 31, isolated from Ixodes dammini ticks. In <b>indirect</b> <b>immunofluorescence</b> <b>assays</b> and western blot analyses, H 5332 reacted with whole cells or isolated components {{of not only}} strain B 31 but also spirochetes isolated from Ixodes ricinus ticks, a field mouse, a raccoon, and patients with Lyme disease. In contrast, H 5332 did not bind to representative borreliae, treponemes, and leptospires. Using <b>indirect</b> <b>immunofluorescence</b> <b>assays</b> and immune electron microscopy, we found the H 5332 determinant to be diffusely distributed {{over the surface of}} prefixed spirochetes but to be aggregated in patches when the organisms were incubated with H 5332 and a second ligand before fixation. Radioimmunoprecipitation and western blot studies revealed the H 5332 determinant to be either on or tightly associated with an abundant outer membrane protein with an apparent subunit molecular weight of 31, 000...|$|R

He developed an <b>indirect</b> <b>immunofluorescence</b> <b>assay</b> for the detection of antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus in human body fluids which was approved under the name Fluorognost(TM) HIV-1 by the U.S. FDA approval on 5 February 1992. A human T-lymphotropic virus antibody test, developed by Mucke's team but never marketed, served to demonstrate the first evidence of retrovirus-like serological reactivity in patients with the myelodysplastic syndrome, a finding that meanwhile has been corroborated on the genomic level.|$|E
40|$|The {{detection}} of immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to cytomegalovirus-induced late antigens by an <b>indirect</b> <b>immunofluorescence</b> <b>assay</b> was improved {{by the use}} of monoclonal antibodies to human IgM. Nonspecific background fluorescence was absent, facilitating the reading of the slides and the {{detection of}} a specific fluorescence reaction in sera with low levels of specific IgM. Moreover, the <b>indirect</b> <b>immunofluorescence</b> <b>assay</b> with monoclonal antibodies to IgM proved more sensitive than the <b>indirect</b> <b>immunofluorescence</b> <b>assay</b> with polyclonal antibodies to IgM. The absorption of human sera on staphylococcal protein A avoided false reactions due to the presence of rheumatoid factor and high levels of specific IgG in test sera...|$|E
40|$|Radioimmunoprecipitation (RIP) and Western blot {{analyses}} {{with specific}} anti-Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum monoclonal antibodies {{were used to}} identify antigens with apparent masses of 102, 84, 54, 53, 52, 47, 32, 29, and 24 kilodaltons (kDa). Cross-reactivity of these antibodies with T. pallidum subsp. pertenue antigens and lack of cross-reactivity with T. phagedenis biotype Reiter, T. vincentii, T. refringens, T. scoliodontum, and T. denticola were also demonstrated by RIP and Western blot analyses. Reactivities in the T. pallidum immobilization test, along with the RIP of lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination products, suggested that the identified antigens were surface associated. The abundance and surface association of the 47 - and 84 -kDa antigens were supported by reactivity in the microhemagglutination test for T. pallidum and by strong reactivity of monoclonal antibodies upon <b>indirect</b> <b>immunofluorescence</b> <b>assays</b> with rabbit-cultivated T. pallidum subsp. pallidum, respectively, but not with T. phagedenis biotype Reiter.

Human {{melanoma}} cells (M 21) actively attach {{and spread}} on a fibronectin substrate. <b>Indirect</b> <b>immunofluorescence</b> <b>assays</b> with specific monoclonal antibodies {{directed to the}} disialoganglioside GD 2, the major ganglioside expressed on M 21 melanoma cells, indicate that during the cell attachment process this molecule redistributes into microprocesses that make {{direct contact with the}} fibronectin substrate. Scanning and transmission immunoelectron microscopic studies with anti-GD 2 monoclonal antibodies and immunogold staining demonstrate that GD 2 preferentially localizes into substrate-associated microprocesses that emanate from the plasma membrane of the M 21 cells.
