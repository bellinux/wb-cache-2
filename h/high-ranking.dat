5|$|Occasionally, {{groups may}} split {{up when they}} become so large that {{competition}} for resources is problematic, but even then, members of matrilines tend to stick together.

However, these <b>high-ranking</b> females also {{appear to have a}} higher probability of miscarriages and some <b>high-ranking</b> matrilines have inexplicably low fertility. One theory suggests this occurs due to stress on the <b>high-ranking</b> females, although this theory is controversial.|$|E
