6000|$|Possibly this scepticism {{has never}} yet injured {{the cause of}} an {{innocent}} man. Yet <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> own personal experience, and have heard from others, from men of age, sagacity, and acquaintance with the greatest affairs, instances in which people have been distinctly seen by sane, healthy, and honourable witnesses, in places and circumstances where it was (as we say) [...] "physically impossible" [...] {{that they should have}} been, and where they certainly were not themselves aware of having been. That is why human testimony seems to me to establish no more, in certain circumstances, than a highly probable working hypothesis--a hypothesis on which, of course, we are bound to act.|$|E
6000|$|... [17] I have {{deliberately}} {{repeated it}} all, {{not only in}} offset to Carlyle' s everlurking pessimism and world-decadence, but as presenting the most thoroughly American points of view <b>I</b> <b>know.</b> <b>In</b> <b>my</b> opinion the above formulas of Hegel are an essential and crowning justification of New World democracy in the creative realms of time and space. There is that about them which only the vastness, the multiplicity and the vitality of America would seem able to comprehend, to give scope and illustration to, or to be fit for, or even originate. It is strange {{to me that they}} were born in Germany, or in the old world at all. While a Carlyle, I should say, is quite the legitimate European product to be expected.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> {{childhood}} I {{often used}} to wish that I could live in a ruined castle; and this Hawthornden would be the very beau ideal of one as a romantic dwelling-place. It is an old castellated house, perched on the airy verge of a precipice, directly over the beautiful River Esk, looking {{down one of the}} most romantic glens in Scotland. Part of it is in ruins, and, hung with wreaths of ivy, it seems to stand just to look picturesque. The house itself, with its quaint, high gables, and gray, antique walls, appears old enough to take you back to the times of William Wallace. It is situated within an hour's walk of Roslin Castle and Chapel, {{one of the most beautiful}} and poetic architectural remains in Scotland.|$|E

60|$|I {{began this}} book by the Lake of Geneva, {{and went on}} with it for some months in France, before {{pursuing}} it in England. The association between the writing and the place of writing is so curiously strong in my mind, that at this day, although <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> fancy, every stair in the little midshipman's house, and could swear to every pew in the church in which Florence was married, or to every young gentleman's bedstead in Doctor Blimber's establishment, I yet confusedly imagine Captain Cuttle as secluding himself from Mrs MacStinger among the mountains of Switzerland. Similarly, when I am reminded by any chance {{of what it was}} that the waves were always saying, my remembrance wanders for a whole winter night about the streets of Paris--as I restlessly did with a heavy heart, on the night when I had written the chapter in which my little friend and I parted company.|$|E

But I'm not that any more,--I'm simply recalling that, don't you see? And even then you wouldn't wish me, now, as I was. That sounds involved, but you must understand. You want a woman who will be wrapped up in your career, Hugh, and yet who will not share it,--who will devote herself body and soul to what you have become. A woman whom you can shape. And you won't really love her, but only just so much of her as may become the {{incarnation}} of you. Well, I'm {{not that kind of}} woman. I might have been, had you been different. I'm not at all sure. Certainly I'm not that kind now, even though <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> heart that the sort of career you have made for yourself, and that I intend to make for myself is all dross. But now I can't do without it." ...|$|E
60|$|You {{will learn}} soon enough {{as you grow}} {{to be a man}} that beneath the respectable {{assumptions}} of our social life there is an endless intricate world of subterfuge and hidden and perverted passion,--for all passion that wears a mask is perversion--and that thousands of people of our sort are hiding and shamming about their desires, their gratifications, their true relationships. I do not mean the open offenders, for they are mostly honest and gallant people, but {{the men and women who}} sin in the shadows, the people who are not clean and scandalous, but immoral and respectable. This underworld is not for us. I wish that I who have looked into it could in some way inoculate you now against the repetition of my misadventure. We Strattons are daylight men, and if I work now for widened facilities of divorce, for an organized freedom and independence of women, and greater breadth of toleration, it is because <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> own person the degradations, the falsity, the bitterness, that can lurk beneath the inflexible pretentions of the established code to-day.|$|E

60|$|It {{struck me}} to the heart {{when he told me}} this, for though it was most {{rational}} to think I would not deny him, yet <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> own conscience <b>I</b> must deny him, and I saw <b>my</b> ruin <b>in</b> <b>my</b> being obliged to do so; but <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> it was my business to talk otherwise then, so I interrupted him in his story thus.|$|R

But, in the name of God, whatever you discover, whatever you do, tell me nothing! Let me remain free from a responsibility which it horrifies me to think of--which <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> conscience, is not my responsibility now. For the last time I say it--on my honour as a gentleman, on my oath as a Christian, if the man you pointed out at the Opera knows ME, he is so altered, or so disguised, that I do not know him. I am ignorant of his proceedings or his purposes in England. I never saw him, I never heard the name he goes by, to my knowledge, before to-night. I say no more. Leave me a little, Walter. I am overpowered by what has happened--I am shaken by what I have said. Let me try to be like myself again when we meet next." ...|$|E
6000|$|Excuse these remarks. I {{have been}} on the whole much interested, and {{sometimes}} amused. Are you aware that the praiser of this [...] "brave gymnasium" [...] has not seen a canoe nor taken a long walk since '79? that he is rarely out of the house nowadays, and carries his arm in a sling? Can you imagine that he is a back-slidden communist, and is sure he will go to hell (if there be such an excellent institution) for the luxury in which he lives? And can you believe that, though it is gaily expressed, the thought is hag and skeleton in every moment of vacuity or depression? Can you conceive how profoundly I am irritated by the opposite affectation to my own, when I see strong men and rich men bleating about their sorrows and the burthen of life, in a world full of [...] "cancerous paupers," [...] and poor sick children, and the fatally bereaved, ay, and down even to such happy creatures as myself, who has yet been obliged to strip himself, one after another, of all the pleasures that he had chosen except smoking (and the days of that <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> heart ought to be over), I forgot eating, which I still enjoy, and who sees the circle of impotence closing very slowly but quite steadily around him? In my view, one dank, dispirited word is harmful, a crime of lèse-humanité, a piece of acquired evil; every gay, every bright word or picture, like every pleasant air of music, is a piece of pleasure set afloat; the reader catches it, and, if he be healthy, goes on his way rejoicing; and it is the business of art so to send him, as often as possible.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is a {{very bad}} business, lad, and I {{take a lot of}} blame to myself. When I got your mother's letter, telling me of poor John's death, and that she would not hear of your coming out, I said some very hard things to myself. Here had I been {{knocking}} about for twenty years, and having had a fair share of luck, and yet I could not put my hand on five hundred dollars, and there was my brother's widow and children, and I, their nearest relative, could not help them. It made me feel a pretty mean man, I can tell you. Your mother did not say much about her circumstances, but it did not need that. I knew that John had retired from the navy with little besides his half-pay, and that her pension as his widow must be a mighty slim one. Altogether I had a pretty bad time of it. However, I took a tall oath that the next rich strike I made the dollars should not be thrown away. I reckoned that you would be out before long; for it was certain that if you were a lad of spirit you would not be staying there doing nothing. Your mother said that the girls all intended to take up teaching, and it was not likely that you would let them work for the family while you were loafing about at home. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> time it was hard enough to get anything to do there, and young fellows who have come out here to ranche tell me that it is harder than ever now. I thought you would fancy this life, and that in time you would talk your mother over into letting you come." ...|$|E

Of course Max {{was acting}} abominably--but--but-- {{he was really}} a dear fellow--and this was the twelfth time--and there was Anne Shirley! <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> secret soul that life would be a dreadfully dismal thing if Max were not around somewhere. Besides, I would have married him long ago had not Aunt Cynthia thrown us so pointedly at each other's heads ever since he came to Spencervale.|$|R
5000|$|... "Drinking in L.A." [...] was {{the last}} song to be {{recorded}} for the record [...] Glee.

6000|$|About {{all these}} myths my own {{position}} is utterly and even sadly simple. I say you cannot really understand any myths till {{you have found}} {{that one of them}} is not a myth. Turnip ghosts mean nothing if there are no real ghosts. Forged bank-notes mean nothing if there are no real bank-notes. Heathen gods mean nothing, and must always mean nothing, to those of us that deny the Christian God. When once a god is admitted, even a false god, the Cosmos begins to know its place: which is the second place. When once it is the real God the Cosmos falls down before Him, offering flowers in spring as flames in winter. [...] "My love is like a red, red rose" [...] {{does not mean that the}} poet is praising roses under the allegory of a young lady. [...] "My love is an arbutus" [...] does not mean that the author was a botanist so pleased with a particular arbutus tree that he said he loved it. [...] "Who art the moon and regent of my sky" [...] does not mean that Juliet invented Romeo to account for the roundness of the moon. [...] "Christ is the Sun of Easter" [...] does not mean that the worshipper is praising the sun under the emblem of Christ. Goddess or god can clothe themselves with the spring or summer; but the body is more than raiment. Religion takes almost disdainfully the dress of Nature; and indeed Christianity has done as well with the snows of Christmas as with the snow-drops of spring. And when I look across the sun-struck fields, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> inmost bones that my joy is not solely in the spring, for spring alone, being always returning, would be always sad. There is somebody or something walking there, to be crowned with flowers: and my pleasure is in some promise yet possible and in the resurrection of the dead.|$|E

And then, when you are quite safely, oh yes, quite safely and soundly gone, then I shall go away for a little, so that we can't even hear each other speak, except in dreams. Life!--well, I always thought it was much too plain a tale to have as dull an ending. And with us the powers beyond have played a newer trick, that's all. Another hour, and we will go.
