5|$|The Earps {{hired an}} {{experienced}} trial lawyer, Thomas Fitch, as defense counsel. Wyatt testified that <b>he</b> <b>drew</b> <b>his</b> gun only after Billy Clanton and Frank McLaury went for their pistols. He detailed the Earps' previous troubles with the Clantons and McLaurys {{and explained that}} they intended to disarm the cowboys. He said they fired in self defense. Fitch managed to produce testimony from prosecution witnesses during cross-examination that was contradictory, or appeared to dodge his questions, or in which they {{said they could not}} remember.|$|E
5|$|Kishimoto {{has noted}} that he likes Shikamaru due to his easygoing nature despite being a genius, and contrasted him against Sasuke Uchiha's {{intelligent}} but abrasive personality. Kishimoto also comically remarked that he would marry Shikamaru {{if he were a}} girl, noting that Shikamaru would likely be successful in life. When designing Shikamaru's Part II appearance, Kishimoto wanted to give Shikamaru a unique appearance despite drawing him with a vest that several other ninja wear in the series. As a result, <b>he</b> <b>drew</b> <b>his</b> forehead protector on his arm in order to not obscure his hair.|$|E
5|$|The French army {{formed on}} the slopes of another ridge to the south. Napoleon could not see Wellington's positions, so <b>he</b> <b>drew</b> <b>his</b> forces up symmetrically about the Brussels road. On the right was I Corps under d'Erlon with 16,000 {{infantry}} and 1,500 cavalry, plus a cavalry reserve of 4,700. On the left was II Corps under Reille with 13,000 infantry, and 1,300 cavalry, and a cavalry reserve of 4,600. In the centre about the road south of the inn La Belle Alliance were a reserve including Lobau's VI Corps with 6,000 men, the 13,000 infantry of the Imperial Guard, and a cavalry reserve of 2,000.|$|E

5|$|Although some in {{the front}} of the Mexican ranks wavered, {{soldiers}} in the rear pushed them on. As the troops massed against the walls, Texians were forced to lean over the walls to shoot, leaving them exposed to Mexican fire. Travis became one of the first defenders to die, shot while firing his shotgun into the soldiers below him, though one source says that <b>he</b> <b>drew</b> <b>his</b> sword and stabbed a Mexican officer who had stormed the wall before succumbing to his injury. Few of the Mexican ladders reached the walls. The few soldiers who were able to climb the ladders were quickly killed or beaten back. As the Texians discharged their previously loaded rifles, however, they found it increasingly difficult to reload while attempting to keep Mexican soldiers from scaling the walls.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers such as David Morrison {{argue that}} the galactic equator is an entirely {{arbitrary}} line and can never be precisely drawn, because {{it is impossible to}} determine the Milky Way's exact boundaries, which vary depending on clarity of view. Jenkins claimed <b>he</b> <b>drew</b> <b>his</b> conclusions about the location of the galactic equator from observations taken at above , an altitude that gives a clearer image of the Milky Way than the Maya had access to. Furthermore, since the Sun is half a degree wide, its solstice position takes 36 years to precess its full width. Jenkins himself noted that even given his determined location for the line of the galactic equator, its most precise convergence with the center of the Sun already occurred in 1998, and so asserts that, rather than 2012, the galactic alignment instead focuses on a multi-year period centered in 1998.|$|E

25|$|Reid {{grabbed the}} rifle barrel {{with his left}} hand and pressed it down, and with his right <b>he</b> <b>drew</b> <b>his</b> {{revolver}} (if not already drawn) and pointed it at Smith. At that moment, Smith is said to have shouted, “My God, don’t shoot!” Reid pulled the trigger, but the hammer fell on a faulty cartridge. Reid tried to shoot again as Smith jerked his rifle from Reid’s desperate grasp and quickly moved it in the direction of Reid.|$|E
25|$|Willi-Peter Stoll (12 June 1950 – 6 September 1978) was an RAF {{member who}} was one of the men {{directly}} involved with the kidnap of Hanns-Martin Schleyer. He was said to have changed mentally after the event, and he became depressed and withdrew from the RAF. On 6 September 1978, Stoll was having dinner in a Chinese restaurant in the Red Light District in Düsseldorf when he was approached by police. <b>He</b> <b>drew</b> <b>his</b> gun and a shoot-out followed that resulted in Stoll's death.|$|E

25|$|Count Nostitz {{immediately}} {{sprang from}} his saddle, and holding {{with his left}} hand the bridle of his own horse, which had been slightly wounded, <b>he</b> <b>drew</b> <b>his</b> sword, firmly resolved to shed, if necessary, the last drop of his blood in defence of his commander. Scarcely had he done so, when he saw the Cuirassiers rushing forward at the charge. To attract as little as possible their attention, he remained motionless. Most fortunately, the rapidity with which the Cuirassiers advanced amidst the twilight, already obscured by the falling rain, precluded them from recognising, or even particularly remarking, the group, although they swept so closely by that one of them rather roughly brushed against the aide de camp's horse.|$|E
25|$|In chapter 67, {{during a}} banquet to {{celebrate}} Lü Meng and Gan Ning's victory at Wan County (皖縣), {{just before the}} Battle of Xiaoyao Ford, Ling Tong was angry when he saw Lü Meng praising Gan Ning, so he offered to perform a sword dance and use the opportunity to avenge his father. Gan Ning sensed Ling Tong's intention so he also offered to perform with his pair of jis. Lü Meng realised that {{they were about to}} fight, so <b>he</b> <b>drew</b> <b>his</b> sword, carried a shield, and stood between the two men to separate them. When Sun Quan heard about the incident, he came to the banquet hall and everyone put down their weapons. When Sun Quan chided them for fighting, Ling Tong cried and knelt down. Sun Quan had to repeatedly urge him to stop provoking Gan Ning.|$|E
25|$|Upon Pausanias's {{arrival in}} Attica, {{he ordered the}} men in Piraeus to disperse; when they refused to do so, <b>he</b> <b>drew</b> <b>his</b> men up to attack them, but did not {{actually}} engage them. The next day, however, a party of Athenian light troops attacked the Spartans while they were reconnoitering near Piraeus. Pausanias dispatched his cavalry and his youngest infantrymen to attack them, while he {{with the rest of}} the infantry followed in support. In pursuit, the Spartan cavalry and advance infantry entered Piraeus, where they encountered a large body of light troops, and were driven back with losses. Thrasybulus then came out with his hoplite force to press the issue; the Spartan hoplites engaged them, and, after a time, defeated them, inflicting 150 casualties. The men from Piraeus returned to the city, while Pausanias and his men returned to their camp. The war was over.|$|E

25|$|His parents, Margaret (née Metcalfe) and Arthur Jefferson, {{were both}} {{active in the}} theatre and always very busy. In his early years, the boy spent much time living with his {{maternal}} grandmother, Sarah Metcalfe. He attended school at King James I Grammar School, Bishop Auckland, County Durham and the King's School, Tynemouth, Northumberland. He moved with his parents to Glasgow, Scotland, where he completed his education at Rutherglen Academy. His father managed Glasgow's Metropole Theatre, where Laurel began work. His boyhood hero was Dan Leno, {{one of the greatest}} English music hall comedians. With a natural affinity for the theatre, Laurel gave his first professional performance on stage at the Panopticon in Glasgow at the age of sixteen, where he polished his skills at pantomime and music hall sketches. It was the music hall from where <b>he</b> <b>drew</b> <b>his</b> standard comic devices, including his bowler hat and nonsensical understatement.|$|E
500|$|Throughout {{the late}} 1920s, Herriman made {{frequent}} trips to Kayenta, Arizona, in Navajo country about [...] from Monument Valley. [...] He also made winter trips to Mexico. [...] The desert, Navajo artwork, and Mexican pottery and architecture became more prominent in Herriman's strips, and he sometimes used Spanish vocabulary in the dialogue. [...] Herriman did little work on these excursions, {{and it is}} likely that <b>he</b> <b>drew</b> <b>his</b> strips in hurried bursts when in Hollywood.|$|E

T'ung was greatly amazed and subsequently presented to grandfather his two favorite bows. Thereafter grandfather practiced still more [...] he was able to shoot to the left and right, accurately letting fly the arrow as he moved.

500|$|In 1867, {{restrictions}} were relaxed on the aristocracy's use {{of stone and}} brick as building materials, before all restrictions on construction were abolished in 1869 by Queen Ranavalona II, who had already commissioned Jean Laborde in 1860 to encase the exterior of her wooden palace at the Rova in stone. [...] The building took its final form in 1872 after James Cameron added stone towers to each corner of the palace. The queen converted to Christianity in 1869 and that same year the London Missionary Society commissioned James Cameron to construct a private home for its missionaries. [...] <b>He</b> <b>drew</b> <b>his</b> inspiration {{from the work of}} Gros and Laborde to develop a multi-story wooden house with veranda and columns. [...] This model exploded in popularity throughout Antananarivo and surrounding areas as an architectural style for the aristocracy, who had to that point continued to inhabit simple homes similar to the wooden palace of Andrianampoinimerina at Ambohimanga. These newly favored brick houses often featured shortened tandrotrano and elaborately carved verandas. These homes can naturally range in color from deep red to almost white depending on the characteristics of the earth used in its construction.|$|E
