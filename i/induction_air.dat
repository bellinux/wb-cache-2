50|$|A typical {{displacement}} ventilation system, {{such as one}} in {{an office}} space, supplies conditioned cold air from an air handling unit (AHU) through a low <b>induction</b> <b>air</b> diffuser. Diffuser types vary by applications. Diffusers can be located against a wall ("wall-mounted"), {{at the corner of}} a room ("corner-mounted"), or above the floor but not against a wall ("free-standing"). The cool air accelerates because of thebuoyancy force, spreads in a thin layer over the floor,reaching a relatively high velocity before rising due to heat exchange with heat sources (e.g., occupants, computers, lights). Absorbing the heat from heat sources, the cold air becomes warmer and less dense. The density difference between cold air and warm air creates upward convective flows known as thermal plumes. Instead of working as a stand-alone system in interior space, displacement ventilation system can also be coupled with other cooling and heating sources, such as radiant chilled ceilings or baseboard heating.|$|E
50|$|During the {{automotive}} industry's interest in gas turbines for vehicle propulsion (around 1965), Chrysler invented a unique type of {{rotary heat exchanger}} that consisted of a rotary drum constructed from corrugated metal (similar in appearance to corrugated cardboard). This drum was continuously rotated by reduction gears driven by the turbine. The hot exhaust gasses were directed through {{a portion of the}} device, which would then rotate to a section that conducted the <b>induction</b> <b>air,</b> where this intake air was heated. This recovery of the heat of combustion significantly increased the efficiency of the turbine engine. This engine proved impractical for an automotive application due to its poor low-rpm torque. Even such an efficient engine, if large enough to deliver the proper performance, would have a low average fuel efficiency. Such an engine may at some future time be attractive when combined with an electric motor in a hybrid vehicle owing to its robust longevity and an ability to burn a wide variety of liquid fuels.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{combustion}} and {{exhaust emission}} characteristics were investigated in an DME fueled HCCI engine. Carbon dioxide, nitrogen and mixed gas, which {{was composed of}} carbon dioxide and nitrogen, were used as control parameters of combustion and exhaust emission. As the oxygen concentration in <b>induction</b> <b>air,</b> which was occurred by carbon dioxide, nitrogen and mixed gas, was reduced, the start of auto-ignition was retarded and the burn duration was extended due to obstruction of combustion and reduction of combustion temperature. Due to these fact, indicated mean effective pressure was increased and indicated combustion efficiency was decreased by carbon dioxide, nitrogen and mixed gas. In case of exhaust emission, hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide was increased by reduction of oxygen concentration in <b>induction</b> <b>air.</b> Especially, partial burning was appeared at lower than about 18 % of oxygen concentration by supplying carbon dioxide.

This paper presents the application of Computational Fluid Dynamics analysis on two engines with different intake port shapes.

40|$|The brake {{efficiency}} of a throttled {{internal combustion engine}} is reduced at low load operation because of the engine work required to drop the intake manifold pressure. These throttling losses are experienced by all throttled engines operating at less than wide open throttle (WOT). By replacing the throttle plate with a suitable air motor, work can be recovered in an expansion process that reduces the induced air pressure to the same intake manifold pressure as the throttled engine. To maximize the benefits from coupling the air motor to the engine cycle, the air {{should be returned to}} a thermal state identical to that of the throttled case at some point prior to combustion. This might be achieved either: (i) prior to cylinder compression via regenerative heat transfer to the inducted air; or (ii) through cylinder compression at an increased compression ratio. The work generated by the <b>Induction</b> <b>Air</b> Motor (IAM) can be directly applied to the engine output thereby increasing the {{brake efficiency}} for the same indicated work. This paper reports on the performance of an IAM designed to reduce intake pressure of an engine for low load operation. Increased brake efficiency will be achieved. The IAM design specifications are explored using a numerical model including isentropic efficiency, friction and service life considerations. A prototype has been constructed and was bench tested at flows and pressures comparable to a throttled engine. These tests indicated that the modelled friction was lower than the friction measured during the experiments. From the experiments performed with the prototype, the net performance of an IAM will give efficiency improvements in excess of 5 % for an equivalent throttled engine operating at loads in the range up to 10 % of its WOT power...|$|E
40|$|Pressure {{to reduce}} energy {{consumption}} is increasing. The problem of vehicle fuel consumption and emissions is approached by exploring various vehicle propulsion options, assessing their net eff�ectiveness on a energy conversion basis {{and on a}} usability (consumer appeal) basis. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of various options indicates that internal combustion engine powered vehicles compare favourably because of low production cost in spite of only achieving modest energy conversion efficiency in operation. Spark ignition (SI) homogeneous charge engines have dominated as passenger vehicle power plants, {{and are likely to}} maintain their prevalence for passenger vehicle propulsion into the future, but efficiency improvements are required and achievable. Throttling losses are a signifi�cant contributor to reduced efficiency at low load for SI engines which is the load range most employed in standard driving behaviour. An <b>Induction</b> <b>Air</b> Motor (IAM) was conceived, designed, simulated and prototyped to evaluate the potential to recover some of the work the engine does to reduce its intake air pressure for low load operation. The prototyped IAM produced work which potentially could contribute to the engine output while reducing the intake pressure resulting in improved efficiency. However, further eff�ort is required to reduce the friction in the IAM and optimise the work produced by the IAM. An alternative strategy for efficiency improvement involves high Compression Ratio (CR) in conjunction with a reduced compression stroke volume achieved by Late Valve Closing (LVC). Such an arrangement of the Atkinson cycle is shown by simulation to produce improved brake efficiency in SI engines. In this cofin�guration, the maximum power produced by the engine is considerably lower than the maximum power that is achieved by the same displacement for a full compression stroke. To achieve both the improved efficiency at low load using the Atkinson confi�guration and the power achievable from a full induction stroke, the engine requires Variable Compression Ratio (VCR). Assessment of VCR concepts from literature and patents identifi�ed that the complexity of continuously variable compression ratio designs prevented their development to production-ready con�figurations. A simulation of fuel consumption over a standard driving cycle showed that a two-position VCR arrangement produces the same bene�t as a continuously variable CR for physically achievable piston-rod-crank cofin�gurations. Experiments with supporting simulations were performed for a previously patented two-position VCR device, an eccentric link in the big-end of the connecting rod. This work concludes that the eccentric link is not a viable VCR mechanism. An alternative VCR device involving a hydraulic connecting rod was prompted by further experiments and simulations which identifi�ed the behaviour of oil when compressed at high rates in a hydraulic cylinder impacted by a falling mass. The oil impact work suggested that oil chambers of cross-sectional area that could be arranged in a conventional connecting rod could readily support the loads experienced by the rod in a conventionally con�figured engine, so the design and prototyping of a hydraulic connecting rod proceeded. Experiments and simulation confi�rmed that a relatively easily manufactured hydraulic connection rod can be successfully operated in an engine, achieving controllable two-position VCR. Further development of the hydraulic connecting rod control device and improved production techniques are recommended for this new two-position hydraulic VCR device. ...|$|E

Para o estudo foram utilizadas nove caldas, sendo uma composta apenas por água e oito soluções contendo adjuvantes (óleo mineral, óleo vegetal, mistura de lecitina e ácido propiônico, nonil fenoxi poli etanol, dois adjuvantes a base de nonil fenol etoxilado, copolímero de poliéster e silicone, e lauril éter sulfato de sódio) e três pontas de pulverização jato plano, sendo duas com indução de ar (Air Guardian e Ultra Lo-Drift – Hypro) e uma com pré-orifício (Drift Guard – Spray Systems). O estudo foi realizado em duas etapas, sendo elas a quantificação do ar incluído nas gotas de pulverização e a análise do espectro produzido. O ar incluído foi calculado através da diferença de volume da mistura pulverizada (ar mais líquido) e apenas do líquido, que foi feito por meio de coletas de amostras de pulverização em uma proveta graduada.
