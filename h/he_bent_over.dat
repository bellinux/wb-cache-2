25|$|On June 22, 2007, Zimmerman fielded {{a routine}} ground ball {{that ended up}} in his jersey. As <b>he</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> to underhand the ball at his stomach level, his jersey top opened and hung {{down in front of}} his glove, causing the ball to go into his jersey instead of his {{positioned}} glove.|$|E
25|$|Later that month, on January 20, in Horn Hill, Limestone County, Texas, Hardin {{claimed he}} {{killed a man}} in a gunfight after an {{argument}} at the circus. Less than a week after this incident, in nearby Kosse, Texas, Hardin was accompanying a saloon girl home when they were accosted by her pimp, who demanded money. Hardin threw money on the ground and shot the would-be thief when <b>he</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> to pick it up.|$|E
25|$|During the Battle of Stalingrad, some units {{within the}} {{division}} were seen to construct caves which {{would later be}} transformed into a field hospital and an equipment storage room. The division fought in the ruined city until Field Marshal Friedrich Paulus' surrender in January 1943, with the 297th division's and IV Army Corps mutual commander, General Pfeffer, following suit into Soviet captivity on the 16th. With the airfield lost to the Red Army, the division was so badly-beaten it could hardly be considered a proper fighting force. Pfeffer's successor as division commander, Major General Moritz von Drebber, finally surrendered to the Red Army a mere nine days later. A photograph of Drebber and several other Axis commanders was taken; one of the men photographed was Dr. Otto Renoldi, the chief surgeon for the 6th Army. A chaplain for the division was executed by a Soviet officer when <b>he</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> to treat a wounded man.|$|E
60|$|The doctor pushed 'em {{out of the}} way in a moment, {{and then}} <b>'e</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> Bill and felt 'is pulse and looked at 'is tongue. Then he listened to his 'art, and in a puzzled way smelt at the bottle, which Jasper Potts was a-minding of, and wetted 'is finger and tasted it.|$|R
60|$|Louisa {{hearing what}} <b>he</b> said, <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> {{him on the}} {{opposite}} side to Rachael, so that he could see her.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> again <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> the {{motionless}} form, {{and it was}} {{not long}} before he had the satisfaction of seeing his father open his eyes.|$|R
500|$|Princess Alexander of Teck {{described}} John as [...] "very quaint and {{one evening}} when Uncle George returned from stalking <b>he</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> Aunt May and kissed her, and they heard Johnny soliloquize, 'She kissed Papa, ugly old man! ...|$|E
500|$|After lunch, Harvey {{accelerated}} {{after the}} second new ball was taken, and 80 minutes into the middle session, reached his century to a loud reception as Australia passed 250. Harvey's knock had taken 177 minutes and included 14 fours. The partnership yielded 105 in only 95 minutes. Harvey was eventually out for 112 from 183 balls, bowled by Laker while playing a cross-batted sweep. His shot selection prompted Bradman to throw his head back in disappointment. Harvey ended as the first Australian left-hander to score a century on his Ashes debut, in an innings noted for powerful driving {{on both sides of}} the wicket. The innings and the high rate of scoring helped to swing the match into a balanced position when Australia were finally dismissed for 458. In the second innings, Harvey took two noted catches, including one where <b>he</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> to catch the ball at ankle height while running. Fingleton said that it [...] "was the catch of the season—or, indeed, would have been had Harvey not turned on several magnificent aerial performances down at The Oval [...] ".|$|E
2500|$|The blurb on {{the inside}} flap of the dustjacket of the first UK edition (which is also {{repeated}} opposite the title page) reads:"Believe it or not, Bobby Jones had topped his drive! He was badly bunkered. There were no eager crowds to groan with dismay. That is easily explained – for Bobby was merely the fourth son of the Vicar of Marchbolt, a small golfing resort on the Welsh coast. And Bobby, {{in spite of his}} name, was not much of a golfer. Still, that game was destined to be a memorable one. On going to play his ball, Bobby suddenly came upon the body of a man. <b>He</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> him. The man was not yet dead. [...] "Why didn't they ask Evans?" [...] he said, and then the eyelids dropped, the jaw fell... It {{was the beginning of a}} most baffling mystery. That strange question of the dying man is the recurring theme of Agatha Christie's magnificent story. Read it and enjoy it." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{priest was}} the first in the room to move. <b>He</b> slowly <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> both bodies, and then turned round to the other man.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>bent</b> low <b>over</b> the girl's {{hand and}} placed a seat for her. The party was now arranged. Their host beamed upon them all.|$|R
60|$|Looking {{back over}} his shoulder, Pawnee saw them coming. To lessen the chances of being shot, <b>he</b> <b>bent</b> low <b>over</b> his {{faithful}} mare's neck.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> her, touched her, {{leaned close}} {{to catch her}} whisper.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> to {{read her}} face, {{uncertain}} in the dim twilight.|$|E
60|$|Another {{few seconds}} of waiting, then once more <b>he</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> the instrument.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>bent</b> hastily <b>over</b> {{the little}} wallet, which never left him. Suddenly a little exclamation broke from his lips. The Professor peered over his shoulder.|$|R
60|$|He {{knew it was}} {{a tornado}} even before it hit him. Everything was silent. <b>He</b> was <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> his whetstone, the reins between his knees, absorbed in his work.|$|R
6000|$|Her lips {{commenced}} to move. <b>He</b> <b>bent</b> close <b>over</b> her, {{determined not}} to lose a syllable. [...] "You know the story about your father, Martin de Vaux and me. I----" ...|$|R
60|$|But, the {{question}} {{reminded him of}} his work, and <b>he</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> it again.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> her {{a little}} clumsily and kissed her. Pamela {{walked to the door}} with him.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over,</b> but Mullet, {{exhausted}} {{with his}} efforts, had {{closed his eyes}} again, and half turned his head.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>bent</b> down <b>over</b> {{the remains}} of the soldier. The gloved hand was closed tightly. There was {{something}} in it. Leone pried the fingers apart. A sealed container, aluminum. Still shiny.|$|R
60|$|But <b>he</b> still <b>bent</b> unknowing <b>over</b> {{his plate}} and gobbled his Irish stew.|$|R
60|$|But Thomas Cole wasn't listening. <b>He</b> was <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> the schematics, {{an intense}} frown on his {{weathered}} face. His long fingers moved restlessly over the schematics, tracing wiring and terminals. His lips moved as he calculated.|$|R
60|$|The countess {{held out}} her hand kindly to Rupert, and <b>he</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> it and touched it with his lips.|$|E
60|$|Tears {{which did}} honor to his manly heart {{fell from the}} young man's eyes, as <b>he</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> his poor friend.|$|E
60|$|I noticed {{now as he}} {{said this}} how frail he looked as <b>he</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> his counter {{wrapping}} up the tooth brush.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>bent</b> {{once more}} <b>over</b> his work. I {{looked at the}} man by my side in bewilderment.|$|R
60|$|They were in {{the shadow}} of the {{entrance}} to the flats. <b>He</b> suddenly <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> her; his lips were almost on hers. There was a frightened gleam in her eyes, but she made no movement of retreat. Suddenly he drew himself upright.|$|R
60|$|Miguel {{held up his}} lantern {{while he}} {{examined}} the picture and both girls observed that his hand trembled. For a long time <b>he</b> remained <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> the print—an unnecessarily long time, indeed—but when {{he raised his head}} his face was impassive as a mask.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> her {{and kissed}} her golden hair, each blue-veined lid closed in unconsciousness, the perfect lips pallid now and still.|$|E
60|$|He came nearer, {{no longer}} heeding the sounds he made. <b>He</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> her. Even now {{she did not}} seem to breathe.|$|E
60|$|He held forth his hand; she {{extended}} hers, cold as marble, which <b>he</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over,</b> {{but did not}} {{press to}} his lips.|$|E
60|$|In {{the rapidly}} darkening room and rapidly rising wind, Brown went along {{the table to}} where a bundle of wax candles lay among the other scrappy exhibits. As he did so <b>he</b> <b>bent</b> accidentally <b>over</b> the heap of red-brown dust; and a sharp sneeze cracked the silence.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>bent</b> down, <b>over</b> his boy, {{and kissed}} him. If his sight were dimmed {{as he did}} so, by {{something}} {{that for a moment}} blurred the little face, and made it indistinct to him, his mental vision may have been, for that short time, the clearer perhaps.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>bent</b> unsteadily <b>over</b> Quest. Suddenly {{the latter}} sprang up, seized {{him by the}} leg and sent him sprawling. The gun fell from his hand. Quest {{picked it up and}} held it firmly out, {{covering}} both men. Gallagher was on his knees, groping for his own weapon.|$|R
