5|$|Dickinson {{was born}} in Amherst, Massachusetts. Although part of a {{prominent}} family with strong ties to its community, Dickinson lived much {{of her life in}} reclusive isolation. After studying at the Amherst Academy for seven years in her youth, she briefly attended the Mount Holyoke Female Seminary before returning to her family's house in Amherst. Considered an eccentric by locals, she developed a noted penchant for white clothing and became known for her reluctance to greet guests or, later <b>in</b> <b>life,</b> <b>to</b> even leave her bedroom. Dickinson never married, and most friendships between her and others depended entirely upon correspondence. Dickinson was a recluse for the later years of her life.|$|E
5|$|She rekindled {{her studies}} too late <b>in</b> <b>life</b> <b>to</b> become a truly {{exceptional}} dancer, but she obsessively insisted on grueling daily practice (up {{to eight hours}} a day) that contributed to her subsequent physical and mental exhaustion. In September 1929, she was {{invited to join the}} ballet school of the San Carlo Opera Ballet Company in Naples, but, as close as this was to the success she desired, she declined the invitation. While the public still believed the Fitzgeralds to live a life of glamor, friends noted that the couple's partying had somewhere gone from fashionable to self-destructive—both had become unpleasant company.|$|E
5|$|Brain AVMs may be {{detected}} on computed tomography angiography (CTA or CT angio) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA); CTA is better in showing the vessels themselves, and MRA provides more {{detail about the}} relationship between an AVM and surrounding brain tissue. In general, MRI is recommended. Various types of vascular malformations may be encountered: AVMs, micro-AVMs, telangiectasias and arteriovenous fistulas. If surgery, embolization, or other treatment is contemplated (see below), cerebral angiography may be required to get sufficient detail of the vessels. This procedure carries a small risk of stroke (0.5%) and is therefore limited to specific circumstances. Recent professional guidelines recommend that all children with suspected or definite HHT undergo a brain MRI early <b>in</b> <b>life</b> <b>to</b> identify AVMs that can cause major complications. Others suggest that screening for cerebral AVMs is probably unnecessary in those who are not experiencing any neurological symptoms, because most lesions discovered on screening scans would not require treatment, creating undesirable conundrums.|$|E

25|$|Speaking {{to audiences}} later in life, Fuller would {{regularly}} recount {{the story of}} his Lake Michigan experience, and its transformative impact on his life. Historians have been unable to identify direct evidence for this experience within the 1927 papers of Fuller's Chronofile archives, housed at Stanford University. Stanford historian Barry Katz suggests that the suicide story may be a myth which Fuller constructed later <b>in</b> <b>life,</b> <b>to</b> summarize this formative period of his career.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the leading}} causes of this {{transition}} to foreign labor and {{the demise of the}} system was the coming of the Civil War. Girls went to be nurses, back to their farms, or into positions that men had left when they went to the army. These girls were out of the mills {{for the duration of the}} war and when the mills reopened after the war, the girls were gone because they no longer needed the mills. They had rooted into their new occupations or moved on <b>in</b> <b>life</b> <b>to</b> the point where the mill was no longer suitable for them. The lack of mill girls created a movement towards Irish immigrants.|$|E
25|$|Gan Eng Seng School {{was founded}} in some shophouses in Telok Ayer Street in 1885 by the philanthropist, Gan Eng Seng and was known as Anglo Chinese Free School. Born in 1844 into a poor family in Melaka, Gan came to Singapore {{at a young age}} to seek his fortune. Since he was unable to have much of an {{education}} in his youth, it was his ambition <b>in</b> <b>life</b> <b>to</b> build a school and help those who are poor as he prospered and became wealthy. Gan was far-sighted in placing emphasis on bilingualism in English and Chinese from the start. The school proved to be a success - the enrolment figure reached a record of 167 by 1890, and rose to an all-time high of 94% in 1892.|$|E

25|$|He was not keen on sport, {{but he was}} {{a highly}} {{proficient}} dancer. Fisher employed his dancing skill later <b>in</b> <b>life</b> <b>to</b> charm a number of important ladies. He became interested in dancing in 1877 and insisted that the officers of his ship learn to dance. Fisher cancelled the leave of midshipmen who would not take part. He introduced the practice of junior officers dancing on deck when the band was playing for senior officers' wardroom dinners. This practice spread through the fleet. He broke with the then ball tradition of dancing with a different partner for each dance, instead adopting the scandalous habit of choosing one good dancer as his partner for the evening. His ability to charm all comers of all social classes made up for his sometimes blunt or tactless comments. He suffered from seasickness throughout his life.|$|E
500|$|Periyar {{attended}} school {{for five years}} after which he joined his father's trade {{at the age of}} 12. He used to listen to Tamil Vaishnavite gurus who gave discourses in his house enjoying his father's hospitality. At a young age, he began questioning the apparent contradictions in the Hindu mythological stories. As Periyar grew, he felt that people used religion only as a mask to deceive innocent people and therefore took it as one of his duties <b>in</b> <b>life</b> <b>to</b> warn people against superstitions and priests.|$|E
500|$|Doggett is from Waynesboro, Virginia. After Doggett has {{her first}} period, her mother gives her advice about sex: [...] "go on {{and let them}} [...] do their business."

Jonathon Dornbush, of Entertainment Weekly writes [...] " [...] wants them both to enjoy the experience , and it opens Tiffany's perception of relationships." [...] Nathan and his family move away, causing their relationship to end, and, almost immediately afterwards, Doggett is raped by an ex-boyfriend.|$|E

500|$|Dunstan {{worked as}} a {{silversmith}} and in the scriptorium while he was living at Glastonbury. It is thought likely {{that he was the}} artist who drew the well-known image of Christ with a small kneeling monk beside him in the Glastonbury Classbook, [...] "one of {{the first of a series}} of outline drawings which were to become a special feature of Anglo-Saxon art of this period." [...] Dunstan became famous as a musician, illuminator, and metalworker. Lady [...] Æthelflaed, King [...] Æthelstan's niece, made Dunstan a trusted adviser and on her death she left a considerable fortune to him. He used this money later <b>in</b> <b>life</b> <b>to</b> foster and encourage a monastic revival in England. About the same time, his father Heorstan died and Dunstan inherited his fortune as well. He became a person of great influence, and on the death of King [...] Æthelstan in 940, the new King, Edmund, summoned him to his court at Cheddar and made him a minister.|$|E

Her final question was whether experience or education serves a person better <b>in</b> <b>life</b> <b>to</b> which she answered [...] "Definitely experience because you get your knowledge through experience." [...] She competed on the platform of integrating people with mental challenges into society. [...] In the nationally televised pageant, {{she became the first}} woman from Missouri to win the Miss USA title. During her reign as Miss USA, Finnessey became an advocate for breast cancer and ovarian cancer awareness and research. [...] She has also worked with Special Olympics, the National Down Syndrome Convention, American Cancer Society and Derek Jeter's Turn 2 Foundation (which helps at-risk kids choose healthier lifestyles). Finnessey resided in a luxury Riverside Drive apartment in New York City provided by the Miss Universe Organization and pageant co-owner Donald Trump.|$|E
500|$|Marochetti was {{not popular}} with the Victorian artistic establishment; Punch {{referred}} to him derisively as [...] "Count Marrowfatty", while John Timbs wrote that he [...] "owed more of his success <b>in</b> <b>life</b> <b>to</b> royal and noble patrons than artistic merit." [...] It was certainly true that he benefited from the patronage of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. His courtly manners impressed Victoria on their first meeting in 1849, and soon afterwards he became involved with the Prince Consort's plans for what became The Great Exhibition of 1851. Several countries planned to display sculptures of romantic historical figures in {{their contributions to the}} exhibition. The genre was common in mainland Europe but relatively rare in England at the time. Marochetti was probably aware that the Belgian sculptor Eugene Simonis intended to show his statue of Godfrey de Bouillon, the leader of the First Crusade, which King Leopold I of Belgium had commissioned. The two men had a number of connections; they shared the same bronze founder, Soyer of Paris, and Simonis was influenced by Marochetti's earlier acclaimed statue of the Duke of Savoy, Emanuele Filiberto. The Italian sculptor was probably motivated by a sense of competition with the Belgian in designing his RichardI.|$|E

500|$|Stackpole {{worked as}} a laborer early <b>in</b> <b>life</b> <b>to</b> support himself and his mother {{following}} {{the death of his father}} in a lumber mill circular saw accident. At sixteen, he came to San Francisco to study at the California School of Design beginning in 1903; he was influenced strongly by Arthur Frank Mathews, muralist and painter at the school. He met painter Helen Arnstein (later Helen Salz) while both were teenagers, and she became his first girlfriend. Arnstein, the daughter of wealthy Jewish art lovers and one year Stackpole's senior, described him as [...] "a remarkable draftsman" [...] who painted and sketched constantly. She was less impressed with his sense of color than with his precision in line. Stackpole polished his craft by working with artists at the Montgomery Block, playfully called [...] "Monkey Block", a bohemian hangout which included studios for painting and sculpture. After the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, he used a grant of 200 ($ in current value) to travel to France to attend the École des Beaux-Arts and Atelier Merces in 1906–1908, exhibiting at the Salon in 1910. It was in Paris that he became friends with painter Diego Rivera [...] He painted under Robert Henri in New York in 1911.|$|E
500|$|Beliefs about {{slow lorises}} {{and their use}} in {{traditional}} practices are deep-rooted and go back at least 300years, if not earlier based on oral traditions. [...] In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, {{it was reported that}} the people from the interior of Borneo believed that slow lorises were the gatekeepers for the heavens and that each person had a personal slow loris waiting for them in the afterlife. [...] More often, however, slow lorises are used in traditional medicine or to ward off evil. The following passage from an early textbook about primates is indicative of the superstitions associated with slow lorises: Many strange powers are attributed to this animal by the natives of the countries it inhabits; there is hardly an event <b>in</b> <b>life</b> <b>to</b> man, woman or child, or even domestic animals, that may not be influenced for better or worse by the Slow Loris, alive or dead, or by any separate part of it, and apparently one cannot usually tell at the time, that one is under supernatural power. Thus a Malay may commit a crime he did not premeditate, and then find that an enemy had buried a particular part of a Loris under his threshold, which had, unknown to him, compelled him to act to his own disadvantage. ... life is not a happy one, for it is continually seeing ghosts; that is why it hides its face in its hands.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, good-girl Cassie {{becomes a}} rebellious teenager; Nick and Sharon have a {{difficult}} time dealing with her. Cassie has a crush on bad-boy Daniel Romalotti (Michael Graziadei), who is dating Lily Winters (Christel Khalil). One night, against her parents' wishes she sneaks out to a party. In a ploy to impress a drunken Daniel she attempts to drive him home, despite being underage. The car crashes, leaving them with no memory of the accident. Daniel is thought to have been driving, and is blamed for the accident. Cassie becomes hospitalized and escapes to find Daniel to tell him she was driving, but is soon re-admitted. During the May 24 episode, Cassie dies with Nick and Sharon at her side. Grimes said she did not think Cassie would die, but if it was [...] "meant to happen, it's meant to happen". The actress found filming her last scenes with Case and Morrow [...] "ridiculously hard". Case also found taping the scenes devastating: [...] "It was too real for Joshua and me to even go through it. We did it in one take. [...] The scene is still devastating in my mind and Joshua’s. [...] It’s almost not watchable. [...] If it comes on, I can’t get through it". Daniel is cleared of all charges and Nick and Sharon begin Cassie's Foundation, a movement to prevent teenage drinking and driving. According to Case, when Sharon loses something in her life it [...] "reminds her and reactivates Cassie’s death for her". After Nick cheats on Sharon following Cassie's death, Case said it [...] "makes you so fearful {{that you are going to}} be alone for the rest of your life; that no matter what you go out <b>in</b> <b>life</b> <b>to</b> create, it’s going to be ruined anyway". The actress also believed that Sharon lost her identity after Cassie's death.
