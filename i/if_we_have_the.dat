500|$|Associated {{with the}} fact that the {{electron}} can be polarized is another small necessary detail which is connected {{with the fact}} that an electron is a fermion and obeys Fermi–Dirac statistics. The basic rule is that <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> probability amplitude for a given complex process involving more than one electron, then when we include (as we always must) the complementary Feynman diagram in which we just exchange two electron events, the resulting amplitude is the reverse – the negative – of the first. The simplest case would be two electrons starting at A and B ending at C and D. The amplitude would be calculated as the [...] "difference", , where we would expect, from our everyday idea of probabilities, that it would be a sum.|$|E
500|$|Kahn {{proposed}} a structure within a structure, monumental [...] "pylons of Jerusalem stone {{on each side}} enclosing four huge central pillars of reinforced concrete, so that the pylons function as a container and the pillars as its content". Following the Beaux-Arts tradition, the elements of architecture were conceived as hollow, thus creating pocketing spaces within both structures. The outer structure was composed of 16 piers covered in golden Jerusalem stone cut in blocks of the same proportions and same course finish {{as those of the}} Western Wall. In the bases of the four corners of the two-story, [...] high structure delineated by the piers, there would be small alcoves for meditation or individual prayer. Such alcoves would be used for daily prayer services, allowing larger crowds on Sabbath or festivals. Boston-based architect Moshe Safdie, who had built extensively in Jerusalem and trained with Kahn in Philadelphia, was also in favour of rebuilding using contemporary design: [...] "It's absurd to reconstruct the Hurva as if nothing had happened. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> desire to rebuild it, let's have the courage to have a great architect do it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: [...] "The Goldstone Report {{is a field}} court-martial, and its {{findings}} were prewritten. This is a prize for terror. The report {{makes it difficult for}} democracies to fight terror." [...] On another occasion, Netanyahu said that the report ignored Israel's 2005 withdrawal from Gaza and the Palestinian rocket attacks that preceded the war. He also warned world leaders that they and their anti-terror forces could be targets for charges similar to those in the report. At the United Nations General Assembly, Netanyahu called the report biased and unjust, asking: [...] "Will you stand with Israel or will you stand with the terrorists? We must {{know the answer to that}} question now. Only <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> confidence that we can defend ourselves can we take further risks for peace." ...|$|E
