In 1977, he introduced the word and <b>figurative</b> <b>mark</b> Hansgrohe. Under his company leadership, Hansgrohe started to work with external designers in the late 1960s, including Hartmut Esslinger (frog design) and later on Phoenix Design and Philippe Starck. Klaus Grohe also reached out to explore new market segments: In 1981 Hansgrohe began producing faucets and introduced a greywater recycling system in 2001.|$|E
5000|$|From {{its market}} entry in 1954 until now, the [...] "Frankfurter Pfanne" [...] (English: Double Roman) {{has been the}} most laid {{concrete}} tile model in Germany. The main ingredients of a concrete roof tile are sand, concrete, water and colour pigments on an iron oxide basis. From the beginning, Braas gave a 30-year-guarantee on the materials of the [...] "Frankfurter Pfanne" [...] and was thus the first manufacturer in Germany to give long-term guarantees on building materials. In 1958, four years after market entry, the word and <b>figurative</b> <b>mark</b> [...] "Frankfurter Pfanne" [...] was registered with the patent office.|$|E
40|$|This {{analysis}} has {{led me to}} believe that an appropriate style of identity mark for LVA-LC should fall within the realm of either a verbal symbol or that of a <b>figurative</b> <b>mark.</b> The potential competition and co-existence with a second identity mark is the primary reason for focusing my attention further within those areas. A strictly typographic treatment seems to be the most appropriate format for communication, clarity, and identity...|$|E

The newly added coda has a serious character created by the somber harmony and the momentary appearance of a chorale-like texture. Such serious, weighty passages place the original, lighter material in <b>figurative</b> quotation <b>marks,</b> almost mocking them as unserious or unworthy.|$|R

5000|$|Michonze is {{primarily}} {{known as a}} landscape and <b>figurative</b> artist. A <b>marked</b> majority of his paintings include depictions of groups of people - families, villagers, peasants, children - and most works evince an allegory or narrative of some kind. Each work is imbued with mystery, a sort of hidden dialogue that enhances {{the appeal of the}} work and piques the viewer's curiosity. In a 1959 letter to the British art critic Peter Stone, Michonze wrote of his work: [...] "My subjects have no subject. They exist only for a poetic end. If the poetry is there, the canvas is complete. No histories. Only pure poetry, preferably untitled." ...|$|R
40|$|THE QUESTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLES IN EXPLANATORY DICTIONARIES AND THE DICTIONARY OF CONTEMPORARY LATVIAN LANGUAGE Summary There are {{two kinds}} of illustrative {{examples}} that are used in explanatory dictionaries: quotations and combination of words (phrases). Quotations are usually included in large dictionaries of many volumes, but phrases are popular in ordinary explanatory dictionar­ies. In explanatory dictionaries illustrative examples have several functions: 1) to confirm that a corresponding word really exists in language; 2) to demonstrate how the word is used in a context; 3) to supply with additional information. In the Dictionary of Contemporary Latvian Language illustrative examples are mainly given in the form of phrases, although sometimes quotations are also used, because there are several word groups that need a larger context (e. g., words with a <b>figurative</b> meaning, stylistically <b>marked</b> words or meanings, interjections). </p...|$|R
5000|$|The process leading Kuert from {{experimental}} {{films to}} the <b>figurative</b> arts is <b>marked</b> by {{his search for}} the quintessential image that can encompass this intense energy as it unfolds. To achieve this goal, through performance Kuert first materializes a world where he immerses the spectator in his vision, subject to the conditions imposed by the spaces in which the performance takes place. Still images obtained from this experience seem to be composed of figures, but they are often enhanced with other languages - calligraphy, texts, and music staffs - and enriched with expressive titles often related to myths or to works evoked by the artist. Reworked in the studio, in a subsequent investigation his images express things that have never ceased to exist, but that continue {{in the eyes of}} the audience and that strive to awaken the desire to [...] "be" [...] the change we are waiting for.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{usage of}} English colour terms in context, {{based on an}} extensive computerised text corpus, the Bank of English. It describes {{the ways in which}} English colour terms may be used to refer to nuances outside their normal area of designation and to attributes outside the colour domain. Usage patterns are analysed on three different levels: with regard to the overall frequency of occurrences, nominal domains and individual tokens, respectively. Cognitive linguistics supplies the theoretical framework employed in the analyses of the observed patterns. The study identifies three types of usage where colour terms refer to peripheral colour nuances or to concepts outside the colour domain: classifying, <b>figurative</b> and <b>marked</b> usage. When a colour term has a classifying function, it can be used outside the normal area of designation. This usage is analysed as a type of reference-point construction where a term referring to a salient point in the colour domain is used to subcategorise an entity whose actual colour may be only a peripheral member of the category named by the colour term. An analysis of the OED and the Bank of English shows that this type of usage is primarily restricted to a few of the most salient basic terms. This study points to the close affinities between classifying and figurative usage. Figurative expressions of colour terms frequently have a classifying function. I argue that figurative meanings are derived through two types of metonymy: +SALIENT ATTRIBUTE FOR OBJECT+ and +SALIENT CONCRETE ATTRIBUTE FOR SALIENT ABSTRACT ATTRIBUTE+. Marked usage arises when specific colour terms are used in nominal domains where the specificity is not expected. This phenomenon is consequently confined to non-basic colour terms. On the basis of the established patterns of usage and the frequency of occurrences, this thesis suggests that the colour category may be analysed as a radial category, with the basic colour terms forming the centre...|$|R
