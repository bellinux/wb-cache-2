40|$|Flash lamp {{annealing}} (<b>FLA)</b> <b>with</b> millisecond-order {{pulse duration}} can crystallize μm-order-thick a-Si films on glass substrates through explosive crystallization (EC), and flash-lamp-crystallized (FLC) poly-Si films consist of densely-packed nanometer-sized fine grains. We investigate {{the impact of}} the hydrogen concentration and the defect density of precursor a-Si films on crystallization mechanism and the microstructures of FLC poly-Si films, by comparing chemical-vapor-deposited (CVD) and sputtered precursor a-Si films. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation reveals that FLC poly-Si films with similar periodic microstructures are formed by the FLA of the two kinds of precursor films, meaning no significant influence of hydrogen atoms and defect density on crystallization mechanism. This high flexibility of the properties of precursor a-Si films would contribute to a wide process window to reproducibly form FLC poly-Si films with the particular periodic microstructures...|$|R

Thicker a-Si films can be crystallized under lower lamp irradiance, which can be understood by considering both the total generated heat in the a-Si films and the thermal diffusion into the quartz substrates. Results of microwave photoconductivity decay (μ-PCD) measurement indicate that high-pressure water vapor annealing (HPWVA) is effective for improving the minority carrier lifetime of the poly-Si films. The film with a thickness of 1. 5 μm crystallized under a high lamp irradiance shows minority carrier lifetimes over 5 μs, indicating the high feasibility of applying the crystalline film to high-efficiency thin-film solar cells...|$|R

30|$|Acrylamide polymer, as {{one type}} of fluid loss agent (FLA), had {{attracted}} {{a strong interest in}} the applied petroleum research because of its outstanding characteristics of thickening and filtration control. The aim {{of this study was to}} synthesize a series of binary FLA using different acrylamide monomers and analyze the effect of monomer structure on the fluid loss control performance of FLA. Three kinds of <b>FLA</b> <b>with</b> the monomer of 2 -acrylamido- 2 -methyl propane sulfonic acid (AMPS) were prepared by polymerization of AMPS with acrylamide (AM), N,N-dimethyl acrylamide (DMAM), N,N-diethyl acrylamide (DEAM), respectively, and characterized by FTIR, 1 H-NMR and 13 C-NMR. The results showed that the FLA prepared by AMPS and DMAM (coded as ADM) showed the best water-retaining capacity, which can be attributed to its moderate rigidity group of −CH 3. It was also revealed that the tolerance of cement slurry containing ADM to Ca 2 + was stronger than that to Mg 2 + and Na+.|$|R
40|$|Flash lamp {{annealing}} (<b>FLA),</b> <b>with</b> millisecond-order duration, can crystallize {{amorphous silicon}} (a-Si) films a few m thick on glass substrates, resulting in formation of polycrystalline Si (poly-Si) films with unprecedented periodic microstructures. The characteristic microstructure, formed spontaneously during crystallization, consists of large-grain regions, containing relatively large grains more than 100 nm in size, and fine-grain regions, including only 10 -nm-sized fine grains. The microstructures results from explosive crystallization (EC), driven by heat generation {{corresponding to the}} difference of the enthalpies of meta-stable a-Si and stable crystalline Si (c-Si) states, which realizes lateral crystallization velocity {{on the order of}} m/s. The lateral crystallization may stop when the temperature of a-Si in the vicinity of c-Si, which is decided by both homogeneous heating from flash irradiation and thermal diffusion from c-Si, falls below a crystallization temperature. This idea is supported by the experimental fact that a lateral crystallization length decreases with decreasing pulse duration...|$|R

The MRC AML (Medical Research Council Acute Myeloid Leukemia) Working Group designed a trial comparing fludarabine and high-dose cytosine (<b>FLA)</b> <b>with</b> standard chemotherapy comprising cytosine arabinoside, daunorubicin, and etoposide (ADE). Patients were also randomly assigned to receive filgrastim (G-CSF) from day 0 until neutrophil count was greater than 0. 5 x 109 /L (or for a maximum of 28 days) and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) for 90 days. Between 1998 and 2003, 405 patients were entered: 250 were randomly assigned between FLA and ADE; 356 to G-CSF versus no G-CSF; 362 to ATRA versus no ATRA. The complete remission rate was 61 % with 4 -year disease-free survival of 29 %.

Neither the addition of ATRA nor G-CSF demonstrated any differences in the CR rate, relapse rate, DFS, or overall survival between the groups.

40|$|Background: Recurrent {{legionella}} outbreaks at one and {{the same}} location are common. We have identified a single Legionella pneumophila genotype associated with recurrent Legionella outbreaks over 6 years. Methods: Field emergency surveys following Legionella outbreaks were performed on a vessel in 2008, 2009 and 2013. Water samples from both the distribution and technical parts of the potable water system were analyzed with respect to L. pneumophila [Real-Time PCR, cultivation, serotyping and genotyping (PFGE) ] and free-living amoebae, (FLA). Results: Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 was present in the ship's potable water system during every outbreak. Genotyping of the 2008 survey material showed two separate PFGE genotypes while those in 2009 and 2013 demonstrated the presence of only one of the two genotypes. <b>FLA</b> <b>with</b> intracellular L. pneumophila of the same genotype were also detected. Analyses of the freshwater system on a ship following three separate Legionella outbreaks, for L. pneumophila and FLAs, revealed a single L. pneumophila genotype and FLA (Hartmanella). Conclusions: It is reasonable to assume that the L. pneumophila genotype detected in the freshwater system was the causal agent in the outbreaks onboard. Persistence of an apparently low-pathogenic L. pneumophila genotype and FLA in a potable water system represent a potential risk for recurrent outbreaks...|$|R
