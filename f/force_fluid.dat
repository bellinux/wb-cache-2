60|$|Among {{accounts}} of 'demoniac affections,' descriptions of objects moved without contact are of frequent occurrence. As M. Littre says, {{it is always}} the same old story. But why is it always the same old story? There were two theories before the world in 1856. First there was the 'animistic-hypothesis,' 'spirits' move the objects, spirits raise the medium in the air, spirits are the performers of the airy music. Then there was the hypothesis of a force or fluid, or faculty, inherent in mankind, and notable in some rare examples of humanity. This <b>force,</b> <b>fluid,</b> agency, or what you will, counteracts the laws of gravitation, and compels tables, or pots, to move untouched.|$|E
60|$|M. de Gasparin now {{examines}} another {{class of}} objections. First, the phenomena were denied; next, {{they were said}} to be as old as history, and familiar to the Greeks. We elsewhere show that this is quite true, that the movement of objects without contact was as familiar to the Greeks as to the Peruvians, the Thibetans, the Eskimo, and in modern stories of haunted houses. But, as will presently appear, these wilder facts would by no means coalesce with the hypothesis of M. de Gasparin. To his mind, tables turn, but they turn by virtue of the will of a 'circle,' consciously exerted, through the means of some physical <b>force,</b> <b>fluid,</b> or what not, produced by the imposition of hands. Now these processes do not characterise the phenomena among Greeks, Thibetans, Eskimo, Peruvians, in haunted houses, or in presence of the late Mr. Home,--granting the facts as alleged. In these instances, nobody is 'circling' round a chair, a bed, or what not, yet the chair or bed moves, as in the story of Monsieur S. at St. Maur (1706), and in countless other examples. All this would not, as we shall see, be convenient for the theory of M. de Gasparin.|$|E

Depending on the depth of the reservoir and density of the fluid, the reservoir may or may not have enough potential to push the fluid to the surface - a deeper well or a heavier mixture results in a higher pressure requirement.|$|E

40|$|Night cooling attracts growing interest. However, {{building}} designers still {{hesitate to}} apply night cooling {{because of the}} important but hard-to-predict convective heat transfer by night. This heat transfer mechanism depends on the driving <b>force,</b> <b>fluid</b> motion and heat transfer surface and, thus, on the room/system design. Unfortunately, studies addressing this for night cooling regimes are scarce. In response, this study, held in a PASLINK cell, investigates how the ventilative cooling rate, thermal mass and the supply/exhaust configuration affect the convective heat transfer. The analysis is based on airflow data, such as temperature and velocity, and the related convective heat flux. The results indicate the air supply/exhaust configuration is particularly important in case of heterogeneously distributed thermal mass. Next to it, correlations {{should not be used}} when the setup and the convection regime differ a lot from those of the corresponding experiments...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} the fabrication of a controllable microfluidic valve {{coupled with an}} electrochemical pump, which {{has been designed to}} deliver reagents to an integrated microfluidic biosensing system. Fluid, retained within an insertion reservoir using a stop valve, was pumped using electrochemical actuation, providing a low power, low voltage integrated Laboratory-on-a-Chip for reproducible, small volume fluidic manipulation. The properties of the valve were characterized using both X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and contact angle measurements, enabling the calculation of the magnitude of the forces involved (which were subsequently verified through experimental measurement). Electrochemical generation of oxygen and hydrogen acted as an on-demand pressure system to <b>force</b> <b>fluid</b> over the stop valve barrier.

40|$|A {{numerical}} analysis is performed on thermocapillary buoyancy convection induced by phase {{change in a}} liquid droplet. A finite-difference code is developed using an alternating-direction implicit (ADI) scheme. The intercoupling relation between thermocapillary force, buoyancy <b>force,</b> <b>fluid</b> property, heat transfer, and phase change, along with their effects on the induced flow patterns, are disclosed. The flow is classified into three types: thermocapillary, buoyancy, and combined convection. Among the three mechanisms, the combined convection simulates the experimental observations quite well, and the basic mechanism of the observed convection inside evaporating sessile drops is thus identified. It is disclosed that evaporation initiates unstable convection, while condensation always brings about a stable density distribution which eventually damps out all fluid disturbances. Another numerical model is presented to study the effect of boundary recession due to evaporation, and the 'peeling-off' effect (the removal of the surface layer of fluid by evaporation) is shown to be relevant...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{increasing}} interest {{has been given}} to the rotordynamic <b>fluid</b> <b>forces</b> on impellers, from the view point of the shaft vibration analysis. Previous experimental and analytical results have shown that the fluid-induced forces and moments on closed type pump impellers contribute substantially to the potential destabilization of subsynchronous shaft vibrations.

This paper reports about experimental investigations of the rotordynamic <b>fluid</b> <b>force</b> moments on an open-type centrifugal compressor impeller in precessing motion. For open-type impellers, the variations of the tip clearance and the clearance between the back shroud and casing due to the precessing motion contribute to the rotordynamic <b>fluid</b> <b>force</b> moments. Experiments were conducted to measure the rotordynamic <b>fluid</b> <b>force</b> moments directly using the 4 -axis sensor, and the unsteady pressure on the front and back casing wall. In this paper, following results are obtained: (1) The <b>fluid</b> <b>force</b> moment becomes destabilizing in the region of negative precessing speed ratio (- 0. 3 <Ω/ω< 0), at the design flow rate; (2) At reduced flow rate, the destabilizing <b>fluid</b> <b>force</b> moments occurred at small positive precessing speed ratio (0. 2 <Ω/ω< 0. 4); (3) From the comparison of direct measured <b>fluid</b> <b>force</b> moments with those estimated from the unsteady pressure measured on the front and back casing walls, {{it was found that the}} destabilizing moments in the backward precession are mainly caused by the <b>fluid</b> <b>forces</b> on the front surface of the present impeller, where there is large clearance between the back shroud and casing...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{establishes}} {{the current state}} of the art in the subject of iceberg and bergy bit motion during interaction and impact with offshore structures. Our particular interest in the present case is the influence of hydrodynamic interaction on change in velocity as small ice masses approach a larger structure in open water. Iceberg impacts are a design driver for structures located in offshore regions subject to drifting glacial ice. It is found that although many studies note that near-field effects influence the velocity and trajectory of drifting bergs prior to impact, the understanding of near-field hydrodynamic effects such as negative wave drift <b>force,</b> <b>fluid</b> cushioning, shadowing, reduction in impact velocity, and hydrodynamic damping, is incomplete. These effects are more obvious for small ice masses and bergy bits and although they have been identified qualitatively, there is very little quantitative information available. The inability to properly account for these phenomena generally leads to overestimation in impact velocity and consequently input impact energy. Better understanding of hydrodynamic interaction between small icebergs and offshore structures in very close proximity could improve load predictions by improving the estimation of input energy.
