According to the twin-plane re-entrant edge (TPRE) and impurity <b>induced</b> <b>twinning</b> mechanism, rare earth metals with atomic radii of about 1. 65 times larger than that of silicon, are possible candidates for eutectic modification. All of the rare earth elements caused a depression of the eutectic growth temperature, but only Eu modified the eutectic silicon to a fibrous morphology. At best, the remaining elements resulted in only a small degree of refinement of the plate-like silicon. The samples were also quenched during the eutectic arrest to examine the eutectic solidification modes. Many of the rare-earth additions significantly altered the eutectic solidification mode {{from that of the}} unmodified alloy.

Recrystallized samples were deformed under tension at − 75 °C, 20 °C, and 200 °C and the microstructures were characterized after 5 % strain and after testing to failure. Deformation to failure at − 75 °C resulted in extensive transformation induced plasticity (TRIP) with over 90 % α′-martensite. The sample deformed to 5 % strain at − 75 °C shows that the austenite transformed first to ϵ-martensite which served to nucleate the α′-martensite. Transformation induced martensite prohibits localized necking providing total elongation to failure of over 70 %. At room temperature, in addition to some TRIP behaviour, {{the majority of the}} deformation is accommodated by dislocation slip in the austenite. Some deformation <b>induced</b> <b>twinning</b> (TWIP) was also observed, although mechanical twinning provides only a small contribution to the total deformation at room temperature. Finally, dislocation slip is the dominant deformation mechanism at 200 °C with a corresponding decrease in total elongation to failure.

40|$|International audienceThe growth {{characteristics}} of eutectic Si in unmodified and Sr-modified Al- 12. 7 %Si alloys were investigated by microstructure-correlated crystallographic analyses. For the unmodified alloys, {{the formation of}} repeated single-orientation twin variants enables rapid growth of eutectic Si according to the twin plane re-entrant edge (TPRE) mechanism. Microscopically, Si crystals are plate-like elongated in one direction {{that is not in}} accordance with the growth assumed by the TPRE model. The growth direction is realized by paired zigzag growth on parallel twinning planes, leading to alternate disappearance and creation of 141 re-entrants. As each twinning plane is associated with three re-entrants, Si crystals may extend in three co-planar directions and cause the formation of equilateral plates. With the formation of cc-Al around eutectic Si, the number of re-entrants is reduced. The planar isotropic growth of eutectic Si becomes anisotropic, leading to the formation of long plates. The reduction of the number of re-entrants also accounts for the width and thickness changes over the length of Si plates. This complex growth mode results in Si crystals exposing only their low-energy planes to the melt. For the Sr-modified alloys, substantial changes appear in the eutectic Si morphology, attributable to the restricted TPRE growth and the impurity <b>induced</b> <b>twinning</b> (IIT) growth.

The role of grain and pre-existing twin boundaries on deformation twinning 5. The efficacy of the Schmid criterion (CRSS) in predicting deformation twinning. Deformation twins induced by nano-indentation using a Berkovich tip on magnesium grains were studied using a combination of optical microscopy, SEM and electron back scattering diffraction (EBSD). All nano-indents made on the magnesium grains in this study <b>induced</b> <b>twinning,</b> mainly of the 101 2 tension twin type.

The evidence shows that twin nucleation and growth are both higher for indents made with higher stress. Moreover, deformation twins appear to be insensitive to strain-rate. Whilst pre-existing twin boundaries play no apparent role in promoting further twinning, grain boundaries twins were found to promote twinning in neighbouring grains. Finally, the twin variants formed by indenting in different crystal orientation suggested a break-down of the Schmid criterion, hence invalidates of the CRSS evaluation for deformation twinning in magnesium.

Sweeping involves heating the crystal above 500 °C in a hydrogen-free atmosphere, with a voltage gradient {{of at least}} 1 kV/cm, for several hours (usually over 12). The migration of impurities and the gradual replacement of alkali metal ions with hydrogen (when swept in air) or electron holes (when swept in vacuum) causes a weak electric current through the crystal; decay of this current to a constant value signals {{the end of the}} process. The crystal is then left to cool, while the electric field is maintained. The impurities are concentrated at the cathode region of the crystal, which is cut off afterwards and discarded. Swept crystals have increased resistance to radiation, as the dose effects are dependent on the level of alkali metal impurities; they are suitable for use in devices exposed to ionizing radiation, e.g. for nuclear and space technology. Sweeping under vacuum at higher temperatures and higher field strengths yields yet more radiation-hard crystals. The level and character of impurities can be measured by infrared spectroscopy. Quartz can be swept in both α and β phase; sweeping in β phase is faster, but the phase transition may <b>induce</b> <b>twinning.</b> Twinning can be mitigated by subjecting the crystal to compression stress in the X direction, or an AC or DC electric field along the X axis while the crystal cools through the phase transformation temperature region.|$|R

Embryo transfer is technically a successful method of <b>inducing</b> <b>twin</b> births in cattle. While an embryo transfer approach is too costly to allow commercial twinning, it has been used to show that ovulation rate and not uterine capacity is the limiting factor in increasing the reproductive rate of the cow. While ovulation of one or more viable oocytes is central to normal reproduction, knowledge of the control of ovulation and of folliculogenesis on which ovulation depends, is limited. In {{spite of the fact that}} many follicles are subjected to the same endogenous hormonal environment and theoretically should all be capable of ovulating, only a tiny proportion do. While gonadotrophic hormones play a central role in ovarian follicle development and ovulation, their action at the ovarian level seems to be controlled by intra-ovarian factors.

Many important fcc metals could benefit from these ?nanotwinned? microstructures, however, not all fcc metals readily form such twins. The tendency of fcc metals to form twin boundaries {{is related to the}} twin boundary energy; those with low twin boundary energy, such as silver (Ag), easily form twins. Increasing twin boundary energy interferes with twin formation, to the point that in metals with high twin boundary energy, like aluminum (Al), twins are quite rare. This thesis focuses on the synthesis of nanotwinned Ag and Al via physical vapor deposition. Nanotwinned Ag is readily fabricated, however, a template approach had to be developed to <b>induce</b> <b>twins</b> in Al. The microstructures and their relationships to observed mechanical properties are also discussed. Grain boundaries interfere with dislocation transmission by posing a slip system discontinuity between grains. Twin boundaries are a special class of grain boundaries in which the grains {{on either side of the}} boundary are related by mirror symmetry. Twin boundaries inhibit dislocation transmission, providing strength in the same manner as grain boundaries. However, their symmetrical structure reduces the free volume and grain boundary energy. Accordingly, coherent twin boundaries are often more energetically stable than grain boundaries, and their coherency allows plasticity mechanisms to remain active under conditions where such mechanisms may be inhibited at grain boundaries. Hence, twin boundaries may provide a metal with unique combinations of high strength and good ductility, conductivity, and thermal stability...|$|R
