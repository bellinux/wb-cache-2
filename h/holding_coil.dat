30|$|Stacking {{of sample}} and reagent zones in the <b>holding</b> <b>coil</b> was {{optimized}} {{to determine whether}} the two-zone stack (reagent/sample combined zones) or the three-zone stack (reagent/sample/reagent sandwich) would be more sensitive. In both tests, 40 -μL sample aliquots of 2.0  mg N L− 1 standard were used. For the two-zone stack, a 10 -μL reagent zone was aspirated followed by a 40 -μL sample zone. For the three-zone sandwiching, the 40 -μL sample zone was sequentially piled in between two 10 -μL reagent lines in the <b>holding</b> <b>coil.</b> Reagent volume was varied in search of the optimum using 40 μL of 2.0  mg N L− 1 standard. The volumes investigated were 3, 5, 7, 10, and 15  μL of the single reagent. Optimization of volume dispensed to the flowcell (delay position) for the stopflow mode of reagent/sample-combined zones was performed. For this test, 40  μL of 2.0  mg N L− 1 standard and 10  μL reagent were sequentially aspirated. The volumes dispensed to the flowcell in separate runs were 1, 5, 10, 15, 20 25, 27, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, and 50  μL and delayed for absorbance reading.

30|$|The {{optimization}} of zone stacking in the <b>holding</b> <b>coil</b> {{showed that}} the two-zone stack (reagent/sample combined zones) gave a higher sensitivity as depicted in Fig.  1 b where its peak heights were greater than the peaks of reagent/sample/reagent sandwich for 2.0  mg N L− 1 standard indicating that for Griess-Illosvay reaction, the greater sample-reagent mixing provided by the sandwich was not important because less mixing was derived from a sample zone flanked on one side by a reagent zone and flanked {{on the other side}} by a water carrier zone. The result indicated that the reaction requires a very small volume of reagent for optimum color intensity or else the sample will be unnecessarily diluted by the excessive reagent volume. Therefore, reagent/sample zone stack was adopted for this study.|$|E

Determination is based on injecting sample with nitrite and nitrate content into continual flow of the carrier stream, where it is mixed with alkaline solution. Ammonium is separated in diffusion segmentor unit through semi-permeable membrane and is introduced into the flow with pH indicator. In consequences changes of pH values change the indicator color, which is scanned by spectrophotometer.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the optimization {{and use of}} a Sequential Injection Analysis (SIA) procedure for ammonium determination in waters. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) {{was used as a}} tool for optimization of a procedure based on the modified Berthelot reaction.

Using a 100 mu mol L(- 1) ammonium solution, the following factors were considered for optimization: reaction temperature (25 - 45 degrees C), reaction time (30 - 90 s), hypochlorite concentration (20 - 40 mmol L(- 1)) nitroprusside concentration (10 - 40 mmol L(- 1)) and salicylate concentration (0. 1 - 0. 3 mol L(- 1)). The proposed system fed the statistical program with absorbance data for fast construction of response surface plots. After optimization of the method, figures of merit were evaluated, as well as the ammonium concentration in some water samples. No evidence of statistical difference was observed in the results obtained by the proposed method in comparison to those obtained by a reference method based on the phenol reaction.

40|$|Sequential {{injection}} analysis (SIA) {{that was}} developed in 1990 is a simple, versatile and automated technique based on precise aspiration of small volumes of reagents and samples into a single channel. It is economical in terms of reagent consumption and waste generation. SIA is applied to food, environmental and pharmaceutical samples. SIA parameters and the chemical variables are optimized and figures of merit are reported. Spectrophotometer {{has been used as}} a detector in the analysis of formaldehyde (HCHO), ascorbic acid and ferric iron (Fe (III)). A stopped flow method was adapted to SIA spectrophometric technique. Enhanced sensitivity was obtained using a stopped flow method as compared to a non-stopped flow method. The SIA spectrophotometric determination of Fe (III) through complex formation with the thiocyanate and the Tiron reagents has been studied in chapter 3. The two methods were compared based on convenience, sensitivity, simplicity, reliability and on general application. Both methods are simple, employ readily available reagents and have lower detection limits and shorter analysis time of 72 samples per hour. The thiocyanate method enabled the determination of Fe (III) in the linear range of 2 to 50 mg/ℓ with a detection limit of 0, 2 mg/ℓ whereas the Tiron method provided a linear range of 1 to 50 mg/ℓ with a detection limit of 0, 1 mg/ℓ. Chapter 4 presents the application of SIA spectrophotometric method for the determination of formaldehyde in wastewater. The method is based on the inhibition of brilliant green-sulfite reaction by formaldehyde. The kinetic method was implemented by stopping the flow when the complex reaches the detector and the measurements were taken as the reaction proceeds. The SIA method was compared with the chromotropic acid method and the paired t-test was used to determine whether the results obtained by the two methods differ significantly. Good sensitivity with a detection limit of 0, 06 mg/ℓ and a wider linear range of 1 - 3 mg/ℓ was achieved. Chapter 5 describes the indirect determination of ascorbic acid in pharmaceutical samples, sweets and beverage (orange juice). This method is based on reduction of Fe (III) to ferrous iron (Fe (II)) by ascorbic acid under UV-light irradiation and the reaction of generated Fe (II) with 1, 10 -phenanthroline. The flow was stopped in the <b>holding</b> <b>coil</b> for a defined time to ensure that complete reduction process take place under irradiation. Photochemical reaction methods improved the sensitivity with detection limit of 0, 06 mg/ℓ. Good precision was obtained with relative standard deviation of 1, 3 %.

Rheological properties of suspensions (0 – 30 % v/v green peas in 1. 5 % CMC solution) in aseptic processing temperature range (85 °C– 135 °C) were determined using tube viscometry.

The consistency coefficient increased with particle concentration and decreased with temperature whereas opposite trends were found for the flow behavior index. Exponential equations described well the effects of temperature on the power law parameters of carrier fluid. The information on the rheological properties of the carrier fluid and the suspensions was used for analyses of particle residence time distribution and fluid-to-particle heat transfer coefficient (hfp) in tube flow. ^ The particle residence time distributions in <b>coiled</b> and straight <b>hold</b> tubes were investigated. Significantly smaller mean normalized residence times in coiled tube, compared to those in straight tube, indicated smaller time lags between particles and the average product when a coiled tube was used. The fluid temperature and the interaction between hold tube geometry and particle concentration significantly influenced the minimum normalized residence time (MNNRT). In the coiled tube, the MNNRT increased with particle concentration whereas the standard deviation of normalized residence time decreased as particle concentration increased. ^ The hfp values for spherical particles in continuously flowing food suspensions (0 – 30 % v/v green peas in 1. 5 % CMC solution) in the <b>coiled</b> <b>hold</b> tube and straight hold tube assembly was determined. Using coiled tube instead of straight tube significantly increased the hfp. At 96 °C, the hfp value increased 102 % to 229 %. At higher temperatures (110 °C and 124 °C), the increase in the hfp was within 45 % and in most cases; it was between 10 % and 25 %. The hfp value significantly increased with temperature, flow rate, and particle concentration. The estimation of the hfp values using RTD data and empirical correlations relating the hfp to dimensionless parameters indicated a more uniform fluid-to-particle heat transfer when <b>coiled</b> <b>hold</b> tube was used instead of straight hold tube. ...|$|R
40|$|A wedge {{and spring}} {{assembly}} {{for use in}} electromagnets or dynamoelectric machines having a housing with an axis therethrough and a plurality of coils supported on salient poles that extend radially inward from the housing toward the housing axis to define a plurality of interpole spaces, respectively between the housing and adjacent coils, the interpole spaces each extending in a direction generally parallel to the housing axis. The wedge and spring assembly includes a nonmagnetic retainer spring and a nonmagnetic wedge. The retainer spring is formed to fit {{into one of the}} interpole spaces, and has juxtaposed ends defining between them a slit extending in a direction generally parallel to the housing axis. The wedge for insertion into the slit provides an outwardly directed force on respective portions of the juxtaposed ends defining the slit to expand the slit so that respective portions of the retainer spring engage areas of the coils adjacent thereto, thereby resiliently <b>holding</b> the <b>coils</b> against their respective salient poles. Preferably, the spring retainer and wedge are self-locking wherein wedge is fabricated from a material softer than a material the retainer spring is fabricated from, so that the wedge is securely retained in the slit. The retainer spring is generally triangular shaped to fit within the interpole space and fabricated from berryllium-copper alloy, and the wedge is generally T-shaped and fabricated from aluminum. Alternatively, a wedge and spring assembly includes a wedge having divergent sloped surfaces in which each surface and the respective juxtaposed ends of the retainer spring are angled relative to one another so that the wedge is securely retained in the slit by friction existing between its sloped surfaces and the juxtaposed ends of the retaining spring...|$|R
