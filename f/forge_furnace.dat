By 1856, Trotter was producing two tons of bar iron annually at the Pigeon <b>Forge</b> <b>furnace.</b> [...] During the U.S. Civil War, Trotter - [...] a Union supporter - [...] installed looms in the mill to furnish uniforms for local Union volunteers (Trotter's son, William, commanded a company at the Battle of Fort Sanders in late 1863). [...] After the war, Trotter expanded the mill, most notably adding a 60-rpm, 30-horsepower wooden wheel (the current breastshot wheel was a later addition), and establishing a sawmill at the site. [...] Trotter's son, George, dismantled and sold the iron furnace in 1885, but continued operating the mill.|$|E
40|$|A basic thermal {{analysis}} of a gas fired <b>forge</b> <b>furnace</b> can determine the fuel savings from exhaust energy recovery/combustion air preheat on a furnace operating at a single condition, for example, high fire. What this analysis {{is not able to}} determine are the effects of combustion air preheat on four additional furnace operating characteristics. These characteristics are: (1) fuel utilization of a furnace operating cycle; (2) time to heat the furnace load; (3) scale production; and (4) furnace uniformity. The capabilities to perform the above comparative analysis now exist within a single facility. In this facility, Solar Turbines Incorporated, under contract to the Gas Research Institute, has recently installed a newly developed high temperature metallic recuperator in a new fiber-lined furnace. This paper summarizes some preliminary test results of instrumented billets in selected gas fired furnaces...|$|E

In turn something less than one third of this estimated twenty quads of energy is actually required to produce the product. This broad sweeping statement covers many sins and many virtues. The blast furnace, for example, is the largest user of energy per net ton of steel produced and operates at approximately 67 % of theoretical efficiency. The slot <b>forge</b> <b>furnace,</b> used to reheat steel fat hot forging, operates at approximately 10 % of theoretical efficiency.

40|$|Voluntary {{participation}} in industrial energy conservation programs resulted in savings of approximately 1 {{million barrels of}} oil equivalent per day in the U. S. during 1981. These energy savings accrued largely from the development, introduction, and acceptance by industry of new energy conserving technologies. These new technologies were developed through cost sharing programs between the Department of Energy and private industry. These joint efforts reduced the risk to industry, thus making them willing to accept and use these new technologies at an accelerated rate. Examples of several technologies that were used by industry at an accelerated rate are described in this paper. These technologies are; textile foam finishing and dyeing, <b>forging</b> <b>furnace</b> modifications, and high efficiency metallic recuperators...|$|R

40|$|International audienceLife Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a {{methodology}} to assess environmental performances of products throughout their life cycles. Traditionally, LCA-based decision-making focuses on environmental impacts, excluding customer expectations and economic considerations. Moreover, it usually uses generic data while environmental performances of industrial systems often depend on local contexts. The {{aim of this}} paper is to provide a comprehensive framework to identify the solution most adapted to a specific context, considering environmental, economic and commercial aspects. First, environmental performances of competing products are compared thanks to LCA. A sensitivity analysis highlights influential parameters on which operational scenarios are built. Costs are then incorporated into a set of exploitation scenarios. Second, matrix-based approach is used. Products are ranked according to several client profiles. The most suitable solution for a given context is identified. This framework is applied on three burners for <b>forge</b> <b>furnaces.</b> Results show that client profiles and operational contexts (namely client expectations, location and resources availability and costs) affect choices...|$|R
5000|$|The {{applicability}} of proto-industrialization in Europe {{has since been}} challenged. M.J. Daunton, for example, argues that proto-industrialisation [...] "excludes too much" [...] to fully explain the expansion of industry: not only do proponents of proto-industrialisation ignore the vital town-based industries in pre-industrial economies, but also ignores [...] "rural and urban industry based upon non-domestic organisation", referring to how mines, mills, <b>forges</b> and <b>furnaces</b> fit into the agrarian economy.|$|R
2500|$|Because iron {{occurs in}} nature {{commonly}} as an oxide, {{it must be}} smelted to drive off the oxygen to obtain the metallic form. Bloomery forges were prevalent in the colonies and could produce small batches of iron to be smithed for local needs (horseshoes, axeblades, plowshares) but were unable to scale production for exporting or larger-scale industry (gunmaking, shipbuilding, wheelmaking). Blast furnaces creating cast iron and pig iron emerged on large self-sufficient plantations in the mid-17th century to meet these demands, but production was expensive and labor-intensive: <b>forges,</b> <b>furnaces,</b> and waterwheels had to be constructed, huge swaths of forest had to be cleared and the wood rendered into charcoal, and iron ore and limestone had to be mined and transported. By {{the end of the}} 18th century, the threat of deforestation forced the English to use coke, a fuel derived from coal, to fire their furnaces. This shift precipitated a drop in iron prices since the process no longer required charcoal, the production of which was labor-intensive. [...] This was a practice that was later adopted in the US as well.|$|R
40|$|Under cost-shared funding {{with the}} U. S. Department of Energy and the Gas Research Institute, AiResearch Manufacturing Company, Torrance, California has {{developed}} a ceramic/metallic hybrid recuperator to operate in dirty industrial flue gases up to 2500 ?F. The recuperator assembly {{is designed to provide}} up to 2000 ?F preheated combustion air from 2500 ?F flue gas. The 2000 ?F air preheat temperature provides over 50 percent savings in fuel consumption compared to an unrecuperated furnace. The assembly consists of a ceramic recuperator in series with a conventional plate-fin metallic recuperator. The ceramic recuperator consists of 1. 5 inch outside diameter silicon carbide tubes with internal cruciform baffles to enhance heat transfer. A recuperator system for a 20 MM Btu/hr furnace was designed, fabricated, and installed in the flue gas of a rotary <b>forging</b> <b>furnace</b> at Cameron Iron Works, Inc., Houston, Texas. The system has operated successfully for about 2500 hours in the six months starting in November 1985.
