25|$|Once he had {{finished}} work on the theme demos, Sawano created the score for orchestra and band. He created the broader orchestral elements on his computer, adding the smaller layers and elements himself so he had complete control over how the score evolved.

After creating the main theme and the core musical themes, he {{then moved on to}} the rest of the soundtrack—estimated at over ninety tracks—over three different periods during production. Due to Takahashi's liking for Sawano's music, Sawano had the freedom to stick to his musical style. The score was directed and co-produced by Legendoor's Yasushi Horiguchi, who was brought on board the project alongside Sawano.|$|E

The languages of Latin and Greek were the main subjects of study and Lowe records that both were easy for him. Lowe then attended University College, Oxford and enjoyed the change; there as a pupil of Benjamin Jowett he gained a first class degree in classics and a second class in mathematics, besides taking a leading part in the Union debates. In 1835 he won a fellowship at Magdalen, but vacated it on marrying, on 26 March 1836, Georgiana Orred (d. 1884). Lowe was {{for a few years}} a successful tutor at Oxford, but in 1838 was disappointed at not being elected to the professorship of Greek at the University of Glasgow.|$|E

25|$|Garner faced several {{life-threatening}} childhood illnesses, {{which left}} him bed ridden {{for much of}} the time. <b>He</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> local village school, where he found that, despite being praised for his intelligence, he was punished for speaking in his native Cheshire dialect; for instance, when he was six his primary school teacher washed his mouth out with soapy water. Garner then won a place at Manchester Grammar School, where he received his secondary education; entry was means-tested, resulting in his school fees being waived. Rather than focusing his interest on creative writing, it was here that he excelled at sprinting. He used to go jogging along the highway, and later claimed that in doing so he was sometimes accompanied by the mathematician Alan Turing, who shared his fascination with the Disney film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Garner was then conscripted into national service, serving for a time with the Royal Artillery while posted to Woolwich in Southeast London.|$|E
25|$|Grove {{was born}} in Clapham, the eighth of the eleven {{children}} of Thomas Grove (1774–1852), fishmonger and venison dealer, and his wife, Mary (1784–1856), née Blades. <b>He</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> preparatory school, on Clapham Common, where one of his schoolfellows was George Granville Bradley, later Dean of Westminster, whose sister Grove subsequently married. He next entered Stockwell (later known as Clapham) Grammar School, run by Charles Pritchard, the astronomer, who {{was inspired by the}} progressive principles of King's College, London. The educational curriculum was based on classics, divinity, mathematics and natural philosophy, and rigorously tested by annual examination. Pritchard also encouraged his pupils to develop interests in literature and music. Grove was a regular worshipper at Holy Trinity church, Clapham, where he heard the music of Bach and Handel. By the age of sixteen, he was competent in classics and mathematics; he left the school in 1836 and was apprenticed to Alexander Gordon, a well-known civil engineer in Westminster. In his free time, he immersed himself in music, attending concerts and studying scores.|$|E
25|$|Although it was {{the first}} time Libien Tella was linked to {{organized}} crime publicly, it was not the first time he had been involved with the law. On October 8, 2008, <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Mexico City appeals court to ask for legal protection against an arrest warrant issued by a Quintana Roo court; the crime he was accused of was not specified. Because the Quintana Roo court lacked jurisdiction, the Mexico City appeals court granted Libien Tella a writ of amparo on April 24, 2009, giving him legal protection and absolving the arrest warrant. On October 13, 2011, Libien Tella requested another writ of amparo in a Mexico City appeals court. He requested this because he was under investigation by the Assistant Attorney General's Office for Special Investigations on Organized Crime (SEIDO), Mexico's organized crime investigation agency. The SEIDO had an open investigation against him and Libien Tella was worried he would be ordered to appear in court or issued an arrest warrant. Libien Tella also issued a writ of amparo against the Federal Investigative Agency (AFI) and SEIDO's subgroup responsible for investigating money laundering, forging, and counterfeiting. The writ of amparo was approved on October 27, 2011, after a judge considered there were no evidences against him.|$|E
