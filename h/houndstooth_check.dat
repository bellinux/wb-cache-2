50|$|<b>Houndstooth</b> <b>check</b> {{trousers}} are occasionally {{worn with}} morning dress as a slightly less formal alternative to cashmere stripe trousers.|$|E
5000|$|Formal {{trousers}} {{also come}} in other patterns such as <b>houndstooth</b> <b>check</b> or plaids {{but these are}} not referred to as 'cashmere stripe'.|$|E
50|$|<b>Houndstooth,</b> hounds tooth <b>check</b> or hound's tooth (and similar spellings), {{also known}} as dogstooth, dogtooth, dog's tooth, or pied-de-poule, is a duotone textile pattern {{characterized}} by broken checks or abstract four-pointed shapes, often in black and white, although other colours are used. The classic houndstooth pattern {{is an example of}} a tessellation.|$|R
50|$|Formal {{trousers}} {{should not}} have turn-ups (cuffs in American English), and should {{have one or two}} forward pleats to each leg. Braces (suspenders in American English) should be worn to prevent the waistband from appearing beneath the waistcoat. Belts should not be worn with morning dress. Less common alternatives to striped trousers are <b>houndstooth</b> <b>check,</b> and grey flannel trousers, amongst others.|$|E
5000|$|Deerstalkers {{may be made}} of solid-coloured material, {{but they}} are most often found with <b>houndstooth</b> <b>check,</b> herringbone, or [...] {{patterns}} in the twill of a fabric which serves as camouflage. Modern hunting clothes, including deerstalkers, are often made with either a red-and-black or an orange-and-black check pattern or tweed for both this purpose and hunter safety, not least in actual deer stalking, for which purpose milliners originally constructed this type of hat.|$|E
50|$|Skinheads wear long-sleeve or short-sleeve button-down shirts or polo shirts by brands such as Ben Sherman, Fred Perry, Brutus, Warrior or Jaytex; Lonsdale or Everlast shirts or sweatshirts; Grandfather shirts; V-neck sweaters; {{sleeveless}} sweaters; cardigan sweaters or T-shirts (plain or with text or designs {{related to}} the skinhead subculture). They may wear fitted blazers, Harrington jackets, bomber jackets, denim jackets (usually blue, sometimes splattered with bleach), donkey jackets, Crombie-style overcoats, sheepskin ¾-length coats, short macs, monkey jackets or parkas. Traditional skinheads sometimes wear suits, often of two-tone tonic fabric (shiny mohair-like material that changes colour in different light and angles), or in a Prince of Wales or <b>houndstooth</b> <b>check</b> pattern.|$|E
50|$|The oldest known {{occurrence}} of houndstooth is the Gerum Cloak, a garment uncovered in a Swedish peat bog, dated to between 360 and 100 BC. Contemporary houndstooth checks may have originated in woven wool cloth of the Scottish Lowlands, but are now {{used in many}} other materials. The traditional <b>houndstooth</b> <b>check</b> is made with alternating bands of four dark and four light threads in both warp and weft/filling woven in a simple 2:2 twill, two over/two under the warp, advancing one thread each pass. In an early reference to houndstooth, De Pinna, a New York City-based men's and women's high-end clothier founded in 1885, included houndstooth checks along with gun club checks and Scotch plaids {{as part of its}} 1933 spring men's suits collection. Oversized houndstooth patterns were also employed prominently at Alexander McQueen's Fall 2009 Collection, entitled Horn of Plenty. The patterns were a reference to Christian Dior's signature tweed suits.|$|E
5000|$|For 1970, the Cougar {{appearance}} {{was similar to}} the 1969 model, but changes were made. A new front end featured a pronounced center hood extension and electric shaver grille similar to the 1967 and 1968 Cougars. Federally mandated locking steering columns appeared inside, and high-backed bucket seats, similar to those included in the 1969 Eliminator package, became standard on all Cougars. Other changes included revised tail light bezels, new front bumper and front fender extensions, and larger, recessed side markers. The [...] 351 [...] "Cleveland" [...] V8 was now available for the first time, though both the Cleveland and Windsor engines were available as the base model two-barrel engine. The 390 FE engine was now dropped, and the Boss 302 and 428CJ continued. The Eliminator received with new striping, revised colors, and the four-barrel 351 Cleveland replacing the four-barrel 351 Windsor as the standard engine. The upgraded [...] "Décor" [...] interior and styled steel wheels, standard '69 Eliminator equipment, were moved to the options list for the 1970 Eliminator. No Eliminator convertibles were factory produced in either 1969 or 1970. New options for the 1970 Cougar were interior upholstery and vinyl top in bold <b>houndstooth</b> <b>check</b> patterns.|$|E
5000|$|... “Textiles offer a ready {{palette of}} pattern and color and {{fashioning}} things {{in three dimensions}} {{has always been a}} part of what I do.The formal structural language for fabric is one I continue to acquaint myself with: corded shirring, shell hems and ruffles, darted and curve-cut flounces, smocked tucks, box pleats... I adapt standard methods to suit atypical uses.The mistress of a country cottage in Kent, England once gave me a catalog of roses. Thumbing through, I appreciated that many of the flowers pictured were the kind with one row of petals circling a central mass of fringy stamens.The design of the frieze raggedy rose is like this.raggedy rose’s cluster of stamens was made with slashed tucks and the fringed wide wale corduroy and <b>houndstooth</b> <b>check</b> were washed and dried at the laundromat to make them look raggy. To better fit my long format, the rose face is wide and ovoid in a way that recalls the fabric face of Raggedy Ann. Broad ribbons of brilliant and toned-down greens were sewn face to face with one satin and one dull side out to approximate the varying color and sheen on the front and back of leaves. Loosely suggesting foliage, the sweeping doubled up ribbons add a quality of a crest owing to their symmetry.Sometimes I am asked what aspect of my work constitutes the original.While the photo project depicts a subject I create, I revise its composition {{in a variety of ways}} so that it becomes more complex than the assemblage. In this way both results of the process are unique, and the photo frieze is not a mere reproductionThis appreciation for my production is supported by Baudrillard in his assertion that the simulacrum (likeness) is not a copy of the real, but a truth of its own.” - Maria Ogedengbe ...|$|E
