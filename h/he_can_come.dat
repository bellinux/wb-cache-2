25|$|After a brief yet scary close {{encounter}} with Crom Cruach, a deity {{of death and}} destruction, of whom Aisling is deeply afraid, Brendan and Aisling return {{to the outskirts of}} the forest. She assures Brendan that <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>come</b> back and visit anytime he wants.|$|E
25|$|There are {{legends of}} him (Khidr) in which, like Osiris, he is dismembered and reborn; and prophecies {{connecting}} him, like the Green Man, {{with the end}} of time. His name means the Green One or Verdant One, he is the voice of inspiration to the aspirant and committed artist. <b>He</b> <b>can</b> <b>come</b> as a white light or the gleam on a blade of grass, but more often as an inner mood. The sign of his presence is the ability to work or experience with tireless enthusiasm beyond one's normal capacities. In this there may be a link across cultures, …one reason for the enthusiasm of the medieval sculptors for the Green Man may be that he was the source of every inspiration.|$|E
500|$|Following a mid-year {{tour of the}} United States, the American Federation of Musicians refused {{permits for}} the group to appear in concerts there {{for the next four}} years, {{effectively}} cutting off the Kinks from the main market for rock music {{at the height of the}} British Invasion. [...] Although neither the Kinks nor the union gave a specific reason for the ban, at the time it was widely attributed to their rowdy on-stage behaviour. It has been reported that an incident when the band were taping Dick Clark's TV show Where The Action Is in 1965 led to the ban. Ray Davies recalls in his autobiography, [...] "Some guy who said he worked for the TV company walked up and accused us of being late. Then he started making anti-British comments. Things like 'Just because the Beatles did it, every mop-topped, spotty-faced limey juvenile thinks <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>come</b> over here and make a career for himself." [...] following which a punch was thrown and the AFM banned them.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the fight}} Mayweather remarked, [...] "I {{would like to}} fight Prince Naseem (Hamed), {{hopefully}} we can meet at 128 (lbs) or <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>come</b> up to 130 (lbs), we can fight or I can fight the winner of Casamayor..." [...] "Prince Naseem isn't going to fight you," [...] intervened HBO commentator Larry Merchant; who then chuckled and added: [...] "after he saw this, it ain't gonna happen".|$|E
2500|$|As {{a result}} of the Dog's actions, Heine is apathetic and distant from almost all other people. Also, due to the previously-depicted event, and the twisted form of love Einstürzen lavished on him (while calling herself his [...] "mother"), Heine {{developed}} gynophobia, an abnormal fear of women, and usually suffers a mental breakdown when in close proximity to a woman. Heine, however, develops a close bond with Nill after discovering she is also a genetic experiment and that <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>come</b> into physical contact with her. Heine is often Badou's [...] "work partner".|$|E
2500|$|The philosopher, if {{he loves}} true wisdom {{and not the}} passions and appetites of the body, accepts that <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>come</b> closest to true {{knowledge}} and wisdom in death, as {{he is no longer}} confused by the body and the senses. In life, the rational and intelligent functions of the soul are restricted by bodily senses of pleasure, pain, sight, and sound. [...] Death, however, is a rite of purification from the [...] "infection" [...] of the body. As the philosopher practices death his entire life, he should greet it amicably and not be discouraged upon its arrival, for, since the universe the Gods created for us in life is essentially [...] "good," [...] why would death be anything but a continuation of this goodness? Death is a place where better and wiser Gods rule and where the most noble souls exist: [...] "And therefore, so far as that is concerned, I not only do not grieve, but I have great hopes that there is something in store for the dead..., something better for the good than for the wicked." ...|$|E

'He's been to {{the other}} kens of course, and finding them filled with strangers come on here, where he's been many a time and often. But where <b>can</b> <b>he</b> have <b>come</b> from first, and how comes he here alone without the other!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You may stay, Paul, and we {{will try}} you for a month. Hester, take him to Parks and see that he is made comfortable. Tomorrow we will see what <b>he</b> <b>can</b> do. <b>Come,</b> darling, I am rested now." ...|$|R
50|$|Ryan Tyler's father Michael (Stephen Lang) {{sends him}} {{a plane ticket}} so that <b>he</b> <b>can</b> visit him in China, where he works with pandas. Ryan is not sure he wants to go, but his mother says <b>he</b> <b>can</b> just <b>come</b> back if he doesn't like it.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] Mrs. Hasketh faltered. [...] "I didn't {{want him}} to see her just the first day, or before I saw him; and I thought he might try to. She's visiting at some friends in Providence; but she'll be back to-morrow. <b>He</b> <b>can</b> <b>come</b> to-morrow night, if she says so. <b>He</b> <b>can</b> <b>come</b> and find out.

6000|$|... "There's nothing," [...] {{interrupted}} Dicky, shortly, [...] "but this. You go {{tell the}} captain of the Catarina that Dicky Maloney wants to see him as soon as <b>he</b> <b>can</b> conveniently <b>come.</b> Tell him where I am. Hurry. That's all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, true for you, and yet on {{the night}} when the clouds have {{gathered}} in the heavens, and your comrade Archie is still where <b>he</b> <b>can</b> be <b>come</b> at with somewhat of ease, you may find this a very timely implement to have." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But Mr. Tredgold {{said that}} he didn’t believe in the treasure," [...] said the wrathful Prudence. [...] "One thing is, <b>he</b> <b>can</b> never <b>come</b> here again; I think that I made him {{understand}} that. The idea of thinking that you could tell a falsehood!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There ain't nothing <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>come</b> by," [...] {{said the}} pundit. [...] "Gentlemen can't wait here all day, sir. The horders is against {{waiting on the}} platform." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It depends {{very much}} on yourself, Mr. Scarborough. I don't think <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>come</b> very often, but {{you can make the}} {{distances}} long or short. You should attend to no business." ...|$|E
6000|$|...

5000|$|Donald is {{something}} of a prankster, and as a result, <b>he</b> <b>can</b> sometimes <b>come</b> across as a bit of a bully, especially in the way he sometimes treats Chip n' Dale and Huey, Dewey and Louie, his nephews. As the animator Fred Spencer has put it: ...|$|R

50|$|Before {{the start}} of the film, Krishna has set fire to his {{bullying}} elder brother's motor-bike. This has landed him in big trouble with his mother.
