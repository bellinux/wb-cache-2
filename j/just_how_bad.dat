25|$|Although many around Presley {{were worried}} about his {{worsening}} drug dependency, Parker appeared to ignore the problem. Several members of Presley's band later stated that Parker had no idea <b>just</b> <b>how</b> <b>bad</b> the situation was, although others have stood by the suggestion that Parker just didn't want to admit {{there was such a}} problem because he didn't {{know how to deal with}} it and was worried about any negative publicity it would create. According to Parker himself, he did attempt to talk to his client about the matter, but Presley simply told him to stay out of his personal life.|$|E

The bridge's closure increases the distance between New Harmony and Crossville, Illinois by about ten miles.|$|E
500|$|Reviewing {{the series}} {{as part of}} the DVD release in 2002, Marc Bernardin for Entertainment Weekly said of season one, that it was [...] "almost hard to believe... <b>just</b> <b>how</b> <b>bad</b> much of it was". He thought that the first season was too similar {{to the end of the}} [...] "cheesy" [...] {{original}} series but said that it [...] "succeeded where it needed to: It introduced viewers to the characters who would carry the torch through six more seasons", and gave it a score of B+. Tor.com reviewer Keith DeCandido was less positive, feeling that it [...] "earned" [...] its reputation as the poorest of The Next Generation seven seasons because [...] "the episodes were uneven, poorly plotted, ineptly scripted, and acted by actors who were still trying to figure their characters out". He gave it a score of 5 out of 10. The season has been given an 80% [...] "fresh" [...] rating by review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes.|$|E

He also received the 2013 Spear's Book Award in Financial History for The Battle of Bretton Woods. In a Wall Street Journal review of The Battle of Bretton Woods, James Grant wrote that Steil [...] "is a talented storyteller. If, perhaps, he lingers too long over <b>just</b> <b>how</b> Dexter White's <b>bad</b> thinking differed from Keynes's bad thinking, or why the State Department {{was mad at}} the Treasury Department, and vice versa, he more than compensates with the nontechnical fluency of his economic narrative and the engrossing portraits of his two principal characters." ...|$|R

500|$|The Atari Lynx {{version of}} Ninja Gaiden III also {{received}} coverage in various magazines in 1994. In GamePro magazine, they criticized {{the fact that}} the Lynx's small screen makes it difficult for players to see the various power-ups and enemies and to use secondary weapons. However, they praised the good controls, and they said the sound was fine though [...] "weird and spacy". VideoGames & Computer Entertainment praised the game for being better than the arcade version that was previously ported to the Lynx, but they were disappointed that Tecmo did not port the first two NES Ninja Gaiden titles to the handheld, as well. Electronic Gaming Monthly praised Tecmo for a good translation of the game from the NES to the Lynx– complete with good graphics, controls, and varied gameplay– while saying that [...] "Ninja Gaiden [...] is a game that the Atari Lynx has been longing for". Despite that, the reviewers noted that the Lynx's small screen made all the sprites too small for most players to see well, and the screen's blurring makes it frustrating for players to track character movements. In a retrospective review, Allgame gave a mostly negative review, saying that the background makes it difficult to see foreground elements, that players cannot see their character or what power-ups they are collecting, and that sound is very poor, saying [...] "thirteen banshees all wailing different, off-key songs would only begin to approach <b>just</b> <b>how</b> <b>bad</b> the music is".|$|E

Those two-legged creatures know where those feeding-grounds are just as well as we do, and they hide there with their terrible guns just as they did when we were coming south. But it is much worse now, very much worse. You see, when we were going the other way, if we found them at one place we could go on to another, but when we are going north we cannot always do that. We cannot go any faster than Jack Frost does.
