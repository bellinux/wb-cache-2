25|$|Whitman {{enlisted in}} the United States Marine Corps one month after his June 1959 {{graduation}} from high school, where he had graduated seventh {{in a class of}} 72 students. He had not told his father beforehand. Whitman told a family friend that the catalyst was an incident a month earlier, in which his father had beaten him and thrown him into the family swimming pool because Whitman <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>home</b> drunk. Whitman left home on July 6, having been assigned an 18-month tour of duty with the Marines at Guantanamo Bay. His father still did not know he had enlisted.|$|E
25|$|Jeremiah Wright {{is a man}} who {{less than}} a week after 9/11 gave a sermon that sadistically rejoiced how America's {{chickens}} <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>home</b> to roost... The fact is, Barack Obama opted to remain in this minister's company for more than six years after that sermon until partially distancing himself just last week in the heat of a presidential race... What the analysts who are gushing over Obama's sentiments regarding race relations are missing is not only did Obama fail to accomplish the mission he needed to, he didn't even really try. He made no attempt to explain his relationship with Wright and why he hung around a man who habitually offered such hateful rhetoric. Obama instead offered a non-sequitur on race relations.|$|E
500|$|Brown was {{appointed}} assistant operations officer, 2d Air Division on 8 April 1944. He {{was promoted to}} colonel on 1 October 1944. Having completed the required 25 missions, he was rotated back to the United States on 9 November 1944. Alice was shocked to discover [...] "that guy of mine had in fact requested another overseas assignment. He was so gung ho that he <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>home,</b> checked on me, and without my knowing it, put in {{to go back for}} another tour." [...] However, the Air Force turned down the request. [...] On 27 January 1945, Brown became Deputy Assistant Chief of Staff A-3 with the Air Training Command at Fort Worth, Texas.|$|E

500|$|Feature films made in {{the west}} during the war were subject to {{censorship}} and were not always realistic. One {{of the first to}} attempt to represent violence, and which was praised at the time for [...] "gritty realism", was Tay Garnett's Bataan (1943). The depiction actually remained stylised: Jeanine Basinger gives as an example the [...] "worst image for stark violence" [...] when a Japanese soldier beheads an American: the victim shows pain and his lips freeze in a scream, yet no blood spurts and his head does not fall off. Basinger points out that while this is physically unrealistic, psychologically it may not have been. The wartime audience was, she points out, well aware of friends and relatives who had been killed or who <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>home</b> wounded.|$|E
500|$|During his procrastinations with Koussevitzky, Sibelius {{continued}} {{to work on the}} symphony. In 1931 he again spent time in Berlin, writing to Aino in May 1931 that [...] "the symphony is advancing with rapid strides". Progress was interrupted by illness, but {{towards the end of the}} year Sibelius was confidently asserting that [...] "I am writing my eighth symphony and I am full of youth. How can this be explained?" [...] In May 1933, as he {{continued to}} deny Koussevitzky, Sibelius wrote in his diary that he was deeply immersed in composition: [...] "It is as if I <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>home...</b> I'm taking everything in another way, more deeply. A gypsy within me. Romantic." [...] Later that summer he informed a journalist that his new symphony was nearly complete: [...] "It will be the reckoning of my whole existence â€“ sixty-eight years. It will probably be my last. Eight symphonies and a hundred songs. It has to be enough." ...|$|E
500|$|In April 2006, Wilco {{was still}} touring {{in support of}} their most recent studio album, A Ghost Is Born which was {{released}} in 2004. The band performed a few new songs during this leg of the tour, including [...] "Walken", [...] "Either Way", and [...] "On and On and On". The following month, drummer Glenn Kotche mentioned to Pitchfork that those new songs {{were going to be}} recorded as demos for a new album release. During a January 17, 2007 solo concert, frontman Jeff Tweedy announced that the band would release their sixth studio album on May 15, 2007 through Nonesuch Records. The album was named Sky Blue Sky, a reference to a childhood memory of Tweedy's, of a Memorial Day parade in Belleville, Illinois. He <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>home</b> from St. Louis with his family, but could not reach his house because the parade blocked the main street. This led Tweedy to reflect upon his future in the town: he knew {{that he would have to}} leave when he grew up because it was too small.|$|E

500|$|The prosecutor, Eugene Duchesne QC, {{began his}} case by calling Mathew Lamb's uncle, Stanley Hesketh, to the stand. Hesketh testified that {{three hours after}} the shootings his nephew {{had told him that}} he [...] "must have done it". He said that since his nephew had come to live with him {{following}} his release from prison, he had always been exceptionally polite and helpful to his family. However, during the morning of 26 June Lamb had for the first time been hesitant, not giving full answers to questions and generally acting in a less open manner. Duchesne then called witnesses of the shootings, who agreed unanimously that Lamb had been unhurried, cool and collected. When cross-examined by Nosanchuk about this unusual calmness, they said that Lamb had appeared very distant and did not seem to have any bearing on what was happening around him: one of the witnesses said that Lamb had not appeared to even notice a very loud party in progress across the street. Heaton said that the boy had looked frightened and had fled without reason when she called to her husband. The police officers who arrested Lamb also agreed that the defendant had been unusually cool and silent. Hesketh told the court that when he <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>home</b> his nephew had been fast asleep in bed.|$|E

2500|$|After she {{finished}} her autobiography Livsglede {{in the beginning of}} 2010, Margit Sandemos sister, Eva Underdal, told her she was actually raped a fourth time. [...] Margit <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>home</b> late one evening in the age of nine, pale as a sheet, with knees covered in scratches. She must have rejected the memory of this event later as she has no memory of it. These tragic and violent experiences led to her attempted suicide at the age of 17, using sleeping pills. Three days later however, she was as healthy as before.|$|E
2500|$|The Hobbits finally {{return home}} to the Shire, {{only to find that}} the Shire was in ruins, its {{inhabitants}} oppressed by Lotho Sackville-Baggins (usually called [...] "The Chief" [...] or [...] "The Boss") who is in reality controlled by a shadowy figure called [...] "Sharkey". Sharkey has taken complete control of the Shire using corrupt Men and half-orcs, and had begun felling trees in a gratuitous programme of industrialization (which actually produces nothing except destruction and misery for the locals). [...] The worst area was around the villages of Bywater and Hobbiton, leading the hobbits to realize that Mordor <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>home</b> to them.|$|E
2500|$|Later this {{affinity}} for Great Britain prompted Buechner to make frequent sojourns and {{visits to the}} United Kingdom. [...] He cultivated profound, enduring, and mutually supportive relationships with prominent Britons. [...] He spoke regularly at Westminster Abbey and Salisbury and was friendly with former deans, The Very Rev. Michael Mayne (Westminster) and The Very Rev. Hugh Dickinson (Salisbury). In fact, his most recent collection, The Yellow Leaves, was dedicated {{to the memory of}} Michael Mayne and, with love, to his wife Allison. [...] In that work, Buechner expresses [...] "the feeling that from the beginning I had had in England that in some sense I <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>home,</b> the feeling I had always had, in Westminster Abbey especially, that all the dead past enshrined there was far from dead in me." ...|$|E
