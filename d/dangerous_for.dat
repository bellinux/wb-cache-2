5|$|Each year, {{thousands}} of outdoor enthusiasts attempt to summit Mount Adams. The false summits and broad summit plateau have disheartened many climbers as this inscription {{on a rock}} at Piker’s Peak indicates. “You are a piker {{if you think this}} is the summit. Don’t crab, the mountain was here first.” Crampons and ice axes are needed on many routes because of glaciers and the route’s steepness. Aside from crevasses on the more difficult glacier routes, the biggest hazard is the loose rocks and boulders which are easily dislodged and a severe hazard for climbers below. These falling rocks are especially <b>dangerous</b> <b>for</b> climbers on the precipitous east faces and the steep headwalls of the north and west sides. Routes in those areas should only be climbed early in the season under as ideal conditions as can be had. Other hazards faced by climbers on Adams include sudden storms and clouds, avalanches, altitude sickness, and inexperience. Climbing Mount Adams can be <b>dangerous</b> <b>for</b> a variety of reasons and people have died in pursuit of the summit while many others have had close calls.|$|E

Additionally, hot-water drilling would have required more power than the Russian expedition could have generated at their remote camp.|$|E

A small green book, it takes activities from the larger <b>Dangerous</b> Book <b>for</b> Boys and makes them available in a portable format. <b>Dangerous</b> Book <b>for</b> Boys Yearbook came out in September 2007 in the UK, and has historical facts, seasonal activities and space to note your own adventures and with a blue cover with gold lettering. In June 2008, the Pocket <b>Dangerous</b> Book <b>for</b> Boys: Things to Know was released. US editions of these three came out in summer/fall of 2008. Canadian edition of the book was released in October 2008.|$|R

5|$|Some {{birds and}} insects use {{defensive}} regurgitation {{to ward off}} predators. The northern fulmar vomits a bright orange, oily substance called stomach oil when threatened. The stomach oil is made from their aquatic diets. It causes the predator's feathers to mat, leading {{to the loss of}} flying ability and the loss of water repellency. This is especially <b>dangerous</b> <b>for</b> aquatic birds because their water repellent feathers protect them from hypothermia when diving for food.|$|E
5|$|The {{area around}} the {{building}} was cleared of pedestrians and firefighting personnel because of falling glass and debris. The falling debris was <b>dangerous</b> <b>for</b> firefighters because they often had to cross the perimeter around the building to enter and leave the high-rise. Hose lines stretched into the building were damaged by falling debris and one firefighter was struck by debris and seriously injured while tending to the lines.|$|E

Interactions with tiny quantities of promethium-147 are not hazardous if certain precautions are observed. In general, gloves, footwear covers, safety glasses, and an outer layer of easily removed protective clothing should be used.|$|E
5|$|The music, {{philosophy}} and lifestyle of heavy metal bands and fans were often panned by both left-wing critics and conservative public opinion, described as senseless, ridiculous {{to the limit}} of self-parody, and even <b>dangerous</b> <b>for</b> the young generation. The 1984 mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap addressed many idiosyncrasies of British metal bands, showing comic sides of that world which external observers would judge absurd. Instead metal musicians regarded the movie's content as much too real.|$|E
5|$|Whether a Native American tribe was {{friendly}} or warlike {{was critical to}} the fates of European explorers and settlers in that land. Friendly tribes taught newcomers how to grow indigenous crops, prepare foods, and hunt wild game.

5|$|Back in Washington, both Scully and Mulder {{report to}} Section Chief McGrath, {{who does not}} believe their claims. McGrath offers an {{especially}} harsh reprimand to Mulder, and presents written testimony by Henderson claiming that Max's {{body was found in}} a cargo container. McGrath and his disciplinary board decide to shut down the X-Files and dismiss Mulder from the FBI, but the decision is vetoed by Deep Throat, who feels it would be more <b>dangerous</b> <b>for</b> them to allow Mulder to turn whistleblower than to let him continue his work.|$|E
5|$|Balch's {{investigations}} into geomorphology and hydrology {{led to his}} decision {{to try to find}} the origins of the water that rose to the surface at Wookey Hole Caves, the source of the River Axe. In 1901, he led a team of miners and cavers to dig into Swildon's Hole, where he found the 'Forty Foot Pot' as well as chambers full of stalagmites. Despite the publicity around the find, Balch refused to disclose the location of the cave as he believed it was too <b>dangerous</b> <b>for</b> amateur explorers. The farmer who owned the land denied them entrance the following year, turning the valley into a fish farm, so the team headed upstream where they discovered Eastwater Cavern, one of Balch's personal favourites.|$|E
5|$|During a {{confrontation}} between rebels and British forces {{at the village}} of an-Nazla ash-Sharqiya in early December 1937, al-Hajj Muhammad was wounded, but managed to evade capture when the mukhtar (village headman) escorted him to safety in a nearby cave. Four of al-Hajj Muhammad's men died in the battle. After the British withdrew from the area, al-Hajj Muhammad was treated by local doctors until January 1938 when he received more advanced care in Damascus. He returned to Palestine later that month. By early 1938, the rebels consolidated control {{over much of the}} countryside and the rural roads. These areas became increasingly <b>dangerous</b> <b>for</b> British forces, who were mostly concentrated in the main towns.|$|E

Tentative evidence supports the short-term safety of teriflunomide, with common side effects including: headaches, fatigue, nausea, hair loss, and limb pain. There have also been reports of liver failure and PML with its use and it is <b>dangerous</b> <b>for</b> fetal development. Most common side effects of dimethyl fumarate are flushing and gastrointestinal problems. While dimethyl fumarate {{may lead to a}} reduction in the white blood cell count there were no reported cases of opportunistic infections during trials.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, {{politicians}} on {{both sides}} of the river began to seek funding to build a new road bridge across the river. The rail bridge, while still adequate for rail traffic, it proved to be a challenge for drivers. The western terminus of the bridge featured a curve which was navigated easily by wagons and early automobiles, but was <b>dangerous</b> <b>for</b> semi trucks. Governor Terry Branstad was convinced a new bridge was needed after riding in a railcar to view the underside of the road deck. The new, four-lane Keokuk–Hamilton bridge opened on November 23, 1985, nearly eight months ahead of schedule and under budget.|$|E
5|$|In the 21st century, the Oval {{has been}} {{dilapidated}} and has required constant repairs to fulfill Health and Safety requirements for Glentoran to host its home matches there. In 2009, Glentoran's Irish Cup match against Limavady United was abandoned after the stadium's floodlight pylons started shaking {{in the high}} winds and the referee deemed it too <b>dangerous</b> <b>for</b> the match to continue. In 2012, after considering selling naming rights to The Oval, Glentoran unveiled plans to move the club to a new stadium in the Titanic Quarter of Belfast. The Oval was sold to property developers in March 2003 for £4million. Glentoran's chairman suggested that the Oval might be redeveloped into social housing.|$|E

She agrees, but her acquiescence was a pretence, as she later joins the fray, offering opportune assistance. Similar scenes recur in her two subsequent appearances in issues #5 and 6.|$|E
5|$|Some large shark species, such as {{the tiger}} shark, the dusky shark, the great white shark and the bull shark, prey on the {{bottlenose}} dolphin, especially calves. The bottlenose dolphin is capable of defending itself by charging the predator; dolphin 'mobbing' behavior of sharks can occasionally prove fatal for the shark. Targeting a single adult dolphin can be <b>dangerous</b> <b>for</b> a shark of similar size. Killer whale populations in New Zealand and Peru have been observed preying on bottlenose dolphins, but this seems rare, and other orcas may swim with dolphins. Swimming in pods allows dolphins to better defend themselves against predators. Bottlenose dolphins either use complex evasive strategies to outswim their predators, or mobbing techniques to batter the predator to death or force it to flee.|$|E
5|$|The Fianchetto Variation {{has never}} been {{considered}} particularly <b>dangerous</b> <b>for</b> Black to meet, since White's setup does not put Black's position under immediate pressure. However, it also offers Black no obvious target to attack—the fianchettoed bishop covers e4 and d5 and also protects White's king. Since the same bishop no longer covers the a6-f1 diagonal, White typically plays Nf3-d2-c4 to help defend against Black's queenside expansion. After further preparatory moves such as Bf4 and Re1, White {{may be able to}} push forward in the centre with e2-e4-e5. Noted proponents of the Fianchetto Variation have included strong positional players such as Viktor Korchnoi, Gennadi Sosonko and Predrag Nikolić, and after a recommendation by the influential theorist Boris Avrukh in 2010, the line has become more topical.|$|E
