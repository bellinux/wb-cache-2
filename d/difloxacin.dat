5000|$|In 1997, the United States Food and Drug Administration {{approved}} <b>difloxacin</b> hydrochloride tablets {{for use in}} canines. [...] Unlike other fluoroquinolones <b>difloxacin</b> has {{not been}} approved by the FDA for use in cats. It is also contraindicated for use in food animals.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Difloxacin</b> {{is stored}} at room {{temperature}} in a cool, dry place.|$|E
50|$|<b>Difloxacin</b> {{has been}} used {{concurrently}} with ectoparasiticides, antiepileptics, anesthetics, antihistamines, and topical anti-inflammatory drugs without adverse effects. It inhibits the metabolism of theophylline, caffeine, cyclosporine and warfarin. Azlocillin, cimetidine and probenecid increase blood levels of <b>difloxacin.</b> Compounds (i.e. sucralfate, antacids, multivitamins) containing di- and trivalent cations (i.e. iron, aluminum, calcium, magnesium and zinc) may substantially interfere with the absorption of quinolones from the intestinal tract resulting in decreased bioavailability. Therefore, the concurrent oral administration of quinolones with foods, supplements or other preparations containing any of these compounds should be avoided.|$|E
5000|$|The {{recommended}} dosing is 5-10 mg/kg once daily. This {{is based}} on the linear pharmacokinetics exhibited by <b>difloxacin</b> over the 5-60 mg/kg range. [...] So the maximum dose is well within the established safety range, but drug accumulation in tissues prompts a recommendation that the medication should not be used for periods longer than thirty days. If there is no noticeable improvement after five days, then the condition should be reevaluated and all therapy options reconsidered. <b>Difloxacin</b> is indicated for infections caused by susceptible microorganisms in the conditions listed below.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Difloxacin</b> {{is rapidly}} and almost {{completely}} absorbed after oral administration, and approximately 50% {{is bound to}} circulating plasma proteins. It is metabolized primarily by the liver through glucuronidation and secreted in the bile. [...] It can also be reabsorbed with the bile. This allows reentry into the blood stream and recirculation, a mechanism that can extend the half-life. The longer half-life allows for once daily dosing. In contrast to other fluoroquinolones, renal clearance accounts for only 5% of the removal of <b>difloxacin</b> from the canine system, which makes it an attractive choice for dogs with compromised renal function. aTotal body clearance/F = Dose/AUC ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Difloxacin</b> tablets are not {{available}} to the public for over-the-counter purchase. It can only be obtained by prescription from a veterinarian. At least one company, Henan Sunny Industry Co. Ltd., provides industrial-size amounts.|$|E
50|$|As {{mentioned}} above, <b>Difloxacin</b> is not FDA-approved {{for use in}} cats. This {{is because}} the major route of metabolism is through glucuronidation, an ezymatic pathway that cats lack. Therefore, administration to cats would likely result in toxicity.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Difloxacin</b> (INN), marketed {{under the}} trade name Dicural, is a second-generation, {{synthetic}} fluoroquinolone antibiotic used in veterinary medicine. [...] It has broad-spectrum, concentration dependent, bactericidal activity; however, its efficacy {{is not as}} good as enrofloxacin or pradofloxacin.|$|E
50|$|Contraindications include {{small and}} medium breeds of dogs {{that are less}} than 8 months old; large breeds less than 12 months old; giant breeds less than 18 months old; those with {{suspected}} CNS disorders; and hypersensitivity to <b>difloxacin</b> or any other fluoroquinolone.|$|E
50|$|Like other fluoroquinolones, <b>difloxacin</b> causes arthropathy in {{immature}} growing animals, particularly dogs. Otherwise, it is {{very well}} tolerated. The most common adverse effects are gastrointestinal effects such as vomiting, diarrhea and anorexia, even in overdose. Only supportive measures, and not additional treatment, are recommended for management of overdose or toxicity as the reactions are self-limiting.|$|E
5000|$|The primary mode {{of action}} of fluoroquinolones {{involves}} interaction with enzymes essential for major DNA functions such as replication, transcription and recombination. <b>Difloxacin</b> inhibits DNA gyrase (also known as Topoisomerase II), an enzyme required for negative super coiling during DNA replication [...] Cell death can occur through the inability of bacteria to maintain the DNA super helical structure.|$|E
50|$|Clinical {{field trials}} were also {{performed}} to evaluate both the efficacy {{and safety of}} <b>difloxacin</b> tablets. Clinical signs of bacterial infections were defined in a protocol. Dogs who presented to investigators with these signs were admitted into the study. In total, eighteen veterinarians located in four different geographical areas of the U.S. (Southeast, Midwest, Northwest, and West) conducted these clinical efficacy and safety evaluations.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Difloxacin</b> is a bactericidal, broad-spectrum {{antibiotic}} {{that has}} activity against Gram-negative bacteria and Gram-positive bacteria. It exerts its antibacterial effect by {{interfering with the}} bacterial enzyme DNA gyrase, which is needed for the maintenance and synthesis of bacterial DNA. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of pathogens isolated in clinical field trials conducted in the United States between 1991 and 1993 were determined using National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS).|$|E
5000|$|Dicural was {{sponsored}} by Fort Dodge Animal Health through New Animal Drug Application (NADA) 141-096. [...] It offers veterinarians once-per-day dosing by providing excellent tissue penetration. <b>Difloxacin</b> can only be obtained either from a veterinarian or by a medical prescription from a veterinarian. [...] It is available as the hydrochloride salt in scored tablets of different strengths for easier dosing adjustments. For differentiation, the milligram strengths, 11.4 mg, 45.4 mg and 136 mg, are colored blue, white and orange, respectively.|$|E
50|$|<b>Difloxacin</b> {{has been}} {{approved}} for animal use only. Keep {{out of reach of}} children. Avoid contact with eyes. In case of contact, immediately flush eyes with copious amounts of water for fifteen minutes. In case of dermal contact, wash skin with soap and water. Consult a physician if symptoms persists following exposure. Individuals with a history of hypersensitivity to quinolones should avoid this product. In humans, there is a risk of user photosensitization within a few hours after excessive exposure to quinolones. If excessive accidental exposure occurs, avoid direct sunlight.|$|E
5000|$|The {{preparation}} of quinolones bearing a substituent at position 5 {{is complicated by}} the greater electrophilic character of the 8 position. One scheme for resolving the problem consists in blocking access to position 8 by first adding a readily removable group to that center.The scheme starts with the conversion of the carboxylic acid in (1) to its dimethyloxazoline derivative (3) by reaction with the dimethyl ethanolamine (2). Lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) then removes a proton from the 8 position; treatment of that anion with trimethylsilyl iodide leads to the silylated intermediate (4). A second round of LDA then generates a carbanion at the only open position; reaction with methyl iodide leads to the corresponding 5 methyl derivative (5). Treatment of that product with cesium fluoride breaks the carbon-silicon bond, removing the silyl group; aqueous acid then hydrolyzes the oxazoline to afford the free acid (6). This last intermediate is then taken on to the quinolone (9) [...] by essentially the same scheme as that used to prepare <b>difloxacin,</b> with the difference that the chain elongation is by means of Grignard reagent of Ethyl bromoacetate. Treatment of (9) with 2-methylpiperazine proceeds by reaction at the less hindered of the two amino groups; saponification then affords grepafloxacin (10).|$|E

40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{activity}} of <b>difloxacin</b> against canine bacterial isolates from clinical cases was {{studied in the}} United States and The Netherlands. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC), the postantibiotic effect, the effect of pH on antimicrobial activity, and the bacterial killing rate tests were determined according to standard techniques. The MICs of American and Dutch isolates agreed in general. The MICs of the American gram-negative isolates ranged from 0. 06 to 2. 0 μg/ml, and the MICs of the Dutch gram-negative isolates ranged from 0. 016 to 8. 0 μg/ml. A few European strains of Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae had relatively high MICs. Bordetella bronchiseptica also was less susceptible to <b>difloxacin.</b> The MICs of the American gram-positive cocci ranged from 0. 125 to 4. 0 μg/ml, and the MICs of Dutch isolates ranged from 0. 125 to 2. 0 μg/ml. <b>Difloxacin</b> induced a concentration-dependent postantibiotic effect that lasted 0. 2 - 3 hours in cultures with Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus intermedius. Streptococcus canis, Proteus spp., and Klebsiella pneumoniae. There was no postantibiotic effect observed against canine Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Decreasing the pH of the medium increased the MIC of Proteus mirabilis for <b>difloxacin.</b> The MICs of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were lowest at neutral pH and were slightly increased in acid or alkaline media. At a neutral pH, most tested bacterial species were killed at a <b>difloxacin</b> concentration of 4 times the MIC. Similar results were obtained when these same bacteria were tested against enrofloxacin. A Klebsiella pneumoniae strain in an acidic environment was readily killed at <b>difloxacin</b> or enrofloxacin MIC, but at neutral pH the drug concentration had to be raised to 4 times the MIC for a bactericidal effect.

Die MHK wird als die niedrigste Konzentration einer Substanz angesehen, die eben die Bildung reifer zytoplasmatischer Chlamydophila psittaci-Einschlüsse (infektiöse Partikel) verhindert. Als resistent werden Chlamydien angesehen, wenn die {{in vitro}} erforderliche Konzentration eines Wirkstoffes zur vollständigen Verhütung der Chlamydien-Einschlüsse größer ist, als der in vivo zur Therapie erforderliche Blutspiegel. Es wurden BGM-Monolayer und die Giménez-Färbung benutzt, welche mit den Isolaten aus Sittichen, Amazonen, Papageien, Enten, Gänschen, Hühnern und Greifvögeln infiziert und mit unterschiedlichen Wirkstoffkonzentrationen behandelt wurden. Die Inkubationszeit der inokulierten Zellkulturen betrug 2 Tage. Danach erfolgten Fixieren, Färben mittels Giménez, Auszählen der zytoplasmatischen Einschlüsse und Auswerten. Die Untersuchungen wurden bei einer Chlortetracyclin-, Doxycyclin-, Clarithromycinund Erythromycinkonzentration von 0, 25 müg/ml, 0, 50 müg/ml, 1, 0 müg/ml, 5, 0 müg/ml und 10, 0 müg/ml, und bei einer Enrofloxacin- und Difloxacinkonzentration von 0, 10 müg/ml, 0, 25 müg/ml, 0, 50 müg/ml, 1, 0 müg/ml und 5, 0 müg/ml durchgeführt.

The MIC was defined as the lowest drug concentration that prevented the formation of inclusions. For this purpose Buffalo Green Monkey cell (BGM cell cultures) were infected with 27 isolates derived from various psittacines, duck, gosling, chickens and birds of prey. The infected cultures were treated with different concentrations of the six drugs. The incubation time was 2 days, followed by fixation, staining by Giménez and counting of the cells with inclusions. For the MIC determinations CTC, doxycycline, clarithromycin, and erythromycin were diluted in steps of 0. 25 müg/ml, 0. 50 müg/ml, 1. 0 müg/ml, 5. 0 müg/ml and 10. 0 müg/ml, and enrofloxacin and <b>difloxacin</b> in 0. 10 müg/ml, 0. 25 müg/ml, 0. 50 müg/ml, 1. 0 müg/ml and 5. 0 müg/ml.
