One goal of this program is to fabricate welds with microstructures and impurity levels which are similar to production heat source welds previously produced at Los Alamos National Laboratory and the Mound Facility. These welds will subsequently be used for high temperature creep testing as part of the overall component lifetime assessment. In order to maximize the utility of the welding system, means for local control of the arc atmosphere have been incorporated and a wide range of welding environments can easily be evaluated. The gas-tungsten arc welding system used in the assembly is computer controlled, includes two-axis and rotary motion, and can be operated in either continuous or pulsed modes. The system can therefore be used for detailed research studies of welding impurity effects, development of prototype weld schedules, or to mimic a significant range of production-like welding conditions. Fixturing for fabrication of <b>high</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>creep</b> <b>test</b> samples have been designed and constructed, and weld schedules for grip-tab and test welds have been developed.

40|$|This is an {{overview}} of a current three-year project for the Cooperative Research Centre for Welded Structures entitled “Integrity of High Energy Piping”. The results of a performance evaluation conducted on an emergency cold weld (controlled deposition temperbead, TB) repair applied to a 2. 25 Cr- 1 Mo steel header using the {{manual metal arc welding}} (MMAW) process are described. With repair rather than replace being a far more viable option, welding is increasingly used for performing repairs, replacements, retrofits and modifications to elevated temperature plants. However, with the considerable cost and time involved with performing conventional post weld heat-treatment (PWHT) repairs, in today’s economic environment utility owners are increasingly forced to turn toward other alternatives, such as cold weld repairs. These require no PWHT and rely on a controlled deposition process – precise weld bead placement and heat inputs etc to achieve tempering of the HAZ. However, much of the research conducted on these repair techniques has used accelerated <b>high</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>creep</b> <b>testing</b> to demonstrate their integrity.

The first part deals with the study of surface {{modification}} of a transition alumina nanopowder and the second part is devoted to the production and mechanical characterization at room- and high-temperature of Alumina 5 vol. % YAG nanocomposites. In order to study, the effect of the dispersion on a transition alumina several physico-chemical characterization techniques were employed such as the DTA-TG analysis, XRD, BET Specific Surface Area, HR-TEM and the FT-IR spectroscopy. In particular, the transition aluminas present metastable phases which suffer transformations during sintering and induce the formation of a vermicular microstructure, consisting of a network of large pores. As a consequence, the final density and the microstructure have been improved thanks to the dispersion which allowed to achieved higher densities and promotes the transformation into alpha-phase. Moreover, the influence of the dispersion on the transformation kinetics (Kissinger Method), as well as, on the sintering kinetics (SID Method) has been evaluated. In the second part, it is presented the development of Alumina/YAG nanocomposites from two commercial nanopowders naturally sintered and sintered by non-conventional methods, such as HP and SPS. The mechanical characterization at room temperature (Hardness, Toughness, Elastic modulus) has been correlated to a microstructural study (ESEM).

40|$|Increasing {{efficiency}} in aeropropulsion and energy generation systems drives {{the development of}} <b>higher</b> <b>temperature</b> structural materials with good mechanical properties and environmental resistance. Platinum group metal (PGM) additions {{are known to be}} beneficial for the oxidation and corrosion resistance of superalloys and Ni rich intermetallics. However, there is limited understanding of how they influence the microstructure and <b>high</b> <b>temperature</b> mechanical properties of γ-γ´ superalloys. The objective of this research is to examine experimental Ni-base compositions that systematically alter PGM and non-PGM elements. The PGMs used for this study are Pt, Ir, and Ru. The non-PGM elements are ones commonly used in conventional Ni-base compositions, such as Re, W, and Ta. Partitioning studies indicates that platinum preferentially partitions to the γ´ phase, resulting in alloys that exhibit positive misfit behavior – quite uncommon for Ni-base superalloys. Iridium influences the partitioning behavior of PGM and non-PGM elements, which could be useful in manipulating alloying chemistry. The unique partitioning behavior of the PGMs results {{in a wide range of}} lattice misfit and, therefore, γ´ morphology. Coarsening studies demonstrate that Pt slows γ´ coarsening and helps maintain unusually high volume fractions at temperatures up to 1200 °C. Such high volume fractions at these elevated temperatures could lead to impressive <b>creep</b> properties. <b>High</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>creep</b> <b>tests</b> at 1000 °C demonstrate variations in creep strength between PGM alloys. Alloys with precipitate boundary strengthening elements boron, carbon, and zirconium, can increase the creep resistance by at least a factor of three. For alloys that directionally coarsen, the formation of dense, interfacial dislocation networks increases creep strength. Dislocation density measurements within positive misfit alloys indicate, in some cases, that a majority of the dislocations are deposited within the precipitate phase rather than the matrix phase – a very unusual feature for <b>high</b> <b>temperature</b> deformation. The calculation of a creep stress exponent establishes that creep is carried out in the power-law regime.

40|$|The {{so-called}} {{creep strength}} enhanced ferritic (CSEF) 9 - 12 % Cr steels {{have been identified}} as the most promising class of materials for some of the key components in ultra-supercritical fossil-fired power plants, including the main steam pipes, headers and superheater tubings. These steels are less costly, and they have a lower coefficient of thermal expansion and a higher thermal conductivity when compared with austenitic stainless steels, making them less susceptible to degradation through thermal fatigue. However, experience has shown that the weldments in these steels are particularly prone to premature creep failure, due to a localised form of cracking in the heat-affected zone {HAZl, which is referred to as Type IV cracking. The work presented in this thesis is concerned with the effects of residual stresses and constraint on Type IV cracking. In {{the first part of this}} work, the residual stresses in a 25. 4 mm thick, 324 mm diameter pipe girth weld, made in a P 91 steel pipe, have been measured in both the as-welded and post weld heat treated (PWHT) conditions using neutron diffraction, and compared with the corresponding metallurgical zones across each weld. It was found that the highest as-welded tensile stresses resided near the outer boundary of the HAZ, and towards t he weld root region and these were not fully relieved by the applied PWHT. In both conditions substantial tensile direct and hydrostatic stresses existed across the HAZ, including the fine-grained and intercritically-annealed regions, where premature Type IV creep failures manifest in 9 - 12 % Cr steel welds. Compressive stresses were found in the weld metal coinciding with the last weld bead to be deposited. In the second part of the work, <b>creep</b> <b>tests</b> were conducted at 625 °C on cross-weld and simulated fine-grained HAZ specimens. The contributions of specific influences on creep performance (such as residual stress, constraint and creep damage associated with relaxation of residual stresses during PWHT) were then systematically examined. It was found that the geometric constraint (introducing a triaxial stress state) was beneficial in improving creep rupture life and that residual stresses (of the order of 50 MPa) showed a. clear reduction in life. Moreover there was some evidence that residual stress relaxation associated with PWHT may introduce some creep damage. The digital image correlation (DIC) technique was applied to resolve tensile and time• dependent creep deformation properties along the length of P 91 cross-weld samples.

The model system of pure tin (Sn) and Sn-based alloy with known uniaxial power-law creep parameters is used for direct comparison between constant indentation strain rate and constant load-hold methods.

The microstructures of two materials have been investigated before and after creep deformation using quantitative microscopy, atom probe tomography, and transmission electron microscopy.

The other material had a higher fraction of binder phase, 16 vol %, and contained a small addition of Cr. <b>High</b> <b>temperature</b> compressive <b>creep</b> <b>tests</b> have been performed under a load of 900 MPa at 900, 1000 and 1100 °C and the test bars were deformed to different strains. Grain size measurements by the linear intercept method showed that WC grain growth took place during compressive <b>creep</b> <b>testing</b> of the Cr doped material, and that this growth took place preferentially in the plane perpendicular to the load axis. Transmission electron microscopy showed that the WC grains in the crept materials had a significantly increased dislocation density, {{with a large number}} of dislocation lines merging at the grain surfaces. It is suggested that merging matrix dislocations having a screw component may act as nucleation points to grow new layers of WC. The binder phase grains became, on the other hand, smaller during creep deformation, and lost their dendritic morphology. This may be explained by binder phase grain rotation caused by dislocation glide. The crept microstructures had an increase number of binder phase lamellae separating adjacent WC grains. This suggests that a redistribution of the WC grains occured, and that the associated grain boundary sliding was accommodated by the lamella formation. Intergranular cavities were also formed during creep deformation. This cavity formation indicates that also unaccommodated grain boundary sliding took place during creep deformation. Atom probe tomography revealed an increased amount of C in the binder phase after creep deformation at 1000 °C.

However, the considerable cost and time involved in performing conventional post weld heattreatment (PWHT) is increasingly forcing utility owners to turn toward other alternatives, such as cold weld repairs. These require no PWHT and rely on a controlled deposition process – precise weld bead placement and heat inputs to achieve tempering of the HAZ. One such cold weld repair was applied to a prematurely failed reheater outlet header (RHOH) in an emergency situation, enabling its return to service until a replacement component was available. Investigation of this particular repair constitutes a core component of this thesis. Much of the research that has been conducted to justify cold repair techniques has used accelerated <b>high</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>creep</b> <b>testing</b> to demonstrate their integrity. How well this testing reflects real-life performance of repaired components remains uncertain. However, the present study provided {{a rare opportunity to}} evaluate the effects of service exposure on the performance of an emergency cold weld repair, as well as to examine the effectiveness of accelerated laboratory <b>creep</b> <b>testing</b> on <b>creep</b> life predictions for the repair weld, the original fabrication welds and the service exposed parent metal. The metallurgical and mechanical properties of the service-exposed non-PWHT temper bead (TB) repair weld were analysed and characterised systematically relative to both the service-exposed original fabrication weld and parent metal. All test specimens were machined transverse to the welding direction, from 20 mm thick slices taken from both the TB repair and original fabrication weldments. The mechanical property characterisation involved hot tensile (miniature sample), Charpy V-notch impact, hardness and accelerated creep-rupture testing. The microstructural characterisation consisted of compositional analysis, surface replication and conventional metallography, post-test fractography, high-resolution microscopy (SEM, TEM and EBSD), EDS and dilatometry. The microstructural studies were successful in characterising the service-exposed TB repair weld metal both in the as-received and post-test conditions. The findings generally showed the TB repair weld metal microstructure was significantly {{different from those of the}} parent and fabrication weld metals. This was established by the TEM and EBSD studies which showed finer carbides, higher dislocation density and limited subgrain formation, features which are consistent with structure of high stored strain energy. The finer carbides, significant Fe content of some carbides and the presence of Mo-rich carbides are also consistent with a relatively early stage in the carbide evolution sequence for this steel. Additionally, the non-metallic inclusions, which are generally considered to be deleterious to properties, were fine scale and uniform in size distribution. These microstructural characteristics were reflected in superior mechanical properties for all tests, with the notable exception of creep performance. In terms of creep resistance, weld repairs of this kind install a high energy microstructure (finer carbides, higher dislocation density, fine grain structure and subgrain / cell structure) into significantly creep degraded material and generate sharp gradients in microstructure and properties. Overall, the microstructural observations in the service-aged condition and the mechanical properties determined by the experimental work were found to support the conclusion that the ex-service material had clearly not exhausted its creep service-life. This was proven by simulating further service life using accelerated <b>creep</b> <b>testing.</b> During these experiments, the creep failure mode was found to be ductile fracture induced by micro-void coalescence. The tests indicated that although the predicted creep life of the TB repair weldment was inferior to the aged parent metal, it was slightly higher than that of the service-exposed fabrication weldment. It is therefore concluded that the TB repair weld and its associated HAZ did not compromise the overall weldment integrity. This conclusion is drawn despite the finding that the accelerated <b>creep</b> <b>test</b> data for the repair weld showed sub-normal creep performance relative to NT samples and even the aged parent metal. This outcome is probably due to the “accelerated” test conditions which induced structural changes that are unlikely to occur under the actual service conditions. Therefore, accelerated <b>creep</b> <b>test</b> data should be treated with circumspection, particularly for structures such as cold repair weld metal which are characterised by high stored strain energy. The instability of this kind of structure in relation to restoration processes (at the “accelerated” temperatures used for testing) is likely to produce premature creep failure and result in a highly conservative creep life assessment. The perceived danger of cold repair welding is that the vessel integrity will be impaired by the absence of a PWHT to reduce internal stresses, liberate hydrogen and improve mechanical properties. However, the evidence obtained in this study indicates that this need not be the case. Therefore, it is concluded that the TB weld technique can be successfully applied to high energy piping (HEP) components without the need for PWHT. The results of the investigation provide new insights into the microstructure and properties, particularly the creep performance, of service-aged cold repair welds. The research has also revealed a serious limitation of accelerated <b>creep</b> <b>testing</b> of weld repair structures of this kind, in that dynamic restoration processes can be induced that are unlikely to occur at the lower service operating temperatures and stresses...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{understand}} the mechanisms behind the plastic deformation of WC‐Co based cemented carbides. The microstructure of two series with different WC grain size was investigated before and after creep deformation using quantitative microscopy, atom probe tomography, and transmission electron microscopy. The first series consisted of two WC-Co based cemented carbides with fine WC grain size used for machining applications, an un-doped WC-Co material with 10 vol % binder phase and a Cr-doped WC-Co material with a higher fraction of binder phase, 16 vol %. The second series consisted of two WC-Co based cemented carbides with coarser WC grain size used for mining applications, an un-doped and a Cr-doped WC-Co based materials. In both materials, the binder phase represented 10 vol% of the total volume. <b>High</b> <b>temperature</b> compressive <b>creep</b> <b>tests</b> were performed under a stress of 900 MPa at 900, 1000 and 1100 °C and 300 MPa at 1100 °C, and the test bars were deformed to different strains. A heat treatment was also performed at 1000 °C {{in order to see}} the effect of an applied load on WC grain growth. Preferential WC grain growth perpendicular to the applied load was found to occur during creep deformation at 1000 and 1100 °C. WC grains in the crept materials had a significantly increased dislocation density, with a large number of dislocation lines merging on the grain surfaces. It is suggested that merging matrix dislocations having a screw component may act as nucleation points to grow new layers of W and C. The binder phase grains became, on the other hand, smaller during creep deformation at 1000 °C, and lost their finger-like morphology. This may be explained by binder phase grain rotation caused by dislocation glide. The crept microstructures had an increased number of density of WC/WC grain boundaries infiltrated by the binder phase. This suggests that grain boundary sliding occurred, accommodated by binder phase infiltration. Some WC grain surfaces facing the infiltrated grain boundaries had a step surface of an angle of 90 and 120 °. The atoms at the surface were rearranged to reduce the surface energy. Intergranular cavities were also formed during creep deformation. This cavity formation indicates that also unaccommodated grain boundary sliding took place during creep deformation. APT revealed a variation in the concentration of W and C in the binder phase, and that the solubility of W and C increased with increase of temperature. The rapid cooling from the <b>creep</b> <b>test</b> <b>temperature</b> ensures that the composition of the binder phase in crept materials represents the composition during the test. WC/binder phase boundaries of the as-sintered fine grained Cr-doped material showed an enrichment in Cr at the phase boundary and formation of thin (Cr, W) carbide layer on the surface of WC grains at the phase boundary.

This project encompasses the development of a Finite Element Code that implements the phase field physics theory developed in order to analyze crack propagation. Under this theory a new state variable is introduced which describes the phase as failed or virgin material. The phase is modeled as diffusion through the material and is driven by specified equations, and is especially useful in the prediction of <b>high</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>creep</b> rupture. To <b>test</b> the code, a number of test cases were modeled. Two key tests included an eight element block undergoing a shear and a tension load. The first test case included a static stress analysis under the application of tensional load. This test case allowed the model to be stretched along the axis of applied force and measurements of maximum displacements were recorded. The results of the first case agree with the commercial FE results as expected. The second test case involves the same eight element block being applied a shear load on the top plane for stress analysis. This test case allowed the model to be stretched along the normal axis of applied force and measurements of maximum displacements were recorded and compared for the top plane. The results of the second case agree with the commercial FE results as expected. To test the addition of time dependence in the code, a number of verification test cases were modeled. Two key verification tests involve a four element stack undergoing transient phase diffusion. The first test case included a transient phase diffusion analysis without the application of any forcing function. This test case allowed the model to be readily duplicated using commercial FE codes simulating single direction thermal diffusion through conduction. The results of the first case agree with the commercial FE results, as well as with an analytical expression developed. The second test case involves the same four element stack undergoing a transient phase diffusion analysis with the application of a second order forcing function for the phase. This test case could not be readily modeled using commercial software, but an analytical solution was developed. The results of the second case agree the analytical expression developed with minimal error. All the cases agree with the analytical solutions developed to model each case. From these results presented, and other tests, {{it is clear that the}} particular phase field physics theory can be appropriately applied to cracks using the developed FEA code. This project has successfully proven that this FEA code is ready for practical fracture analysis using finite elements...|$|R

40|$|Dense silicon nitride-based {{ceramics}} were microwave annealed {{to determine}} if microwave heating offers advantages over conventional heating for the enhancement of the <b>high</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>creep</b> resistance. Gas pressure sintered silicon nitride (GPS-SN) and sintered reaction-bonded silicon nitride (SRBSN) were heated in microwave or graphite element furnaces at 1150 {degrees}C and 1600 {degrees}C. Annealed materials were characterized for the room and <b>high</b> <b>temperature</b> flexural strengths, room temperature fracture toughness values, and <b>high</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>creep</b> properties. In addition, SEM analyses were performed to study grain growth and other microstructural changes. The {{results of this study}} showed that both types of furnace anneals at 1150 {degrees}C lowered the room temperature strength and toughness values of both SRBSN and GPS-SN materials; however, the anneal treatments at 1600 {degrees}C had little effect on the room temperature properties. Both the SRBSN and GPS-SN control and annealed samples had reduced <b>high</b> <b>temperature</b> fast fracture strengths, when compared to the room <b>temperature</b> strengths. <b>Creep</b> <b>tests</b> at 1200 {degrees}C indicated that both the SRBSN and the GPS-SN materials that were annealed by microwave heating at I 150 {degrees}C for 20 h showed enhanced creep resistance, when compared to unheated controls and conventionally heated materials. No qualitative differences were seen in the microstructures of the SRBSN and the GPS-SN materials which could account for the differences in the creep properties of the annealed materials. Additional experimental work is in progress to further understand the mechanisms for the enhanced creep properties of silicon nitride materials annealed by microwave heating...|$|R

The mechanical properties showed improvement {{with respect to}} the amount of reinforcement content. The <b>creep</b> <b>testing</b> of the composites carried out at a temperature of 175  °C under constant stress of 80, 100 and 120  MPa reveals different creep characteristics depending upon the reinforcement content and the applied load.

40|$|The <b>high</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>creep</b> of Maryland diabase {{has been}} {{investigated}} at a fixed temperature of 1000 *C and confining pressures to 450 MPa. Under these conditions, <b>high</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>creep</b> was achieved. For stresses below 300 MPa the strength-strain rate relation can be described by a power law with an activation energy of 276 ± 14 kJ/mol and a stress exponent of 3. 0 ± 0. 2. For stresses above 300 MPa the strain rate is stress activated. Electron and optical microscopy indicate that thermal cracking existed even at 450 MPa confining pressure. Bending of the acicular plagioclase and stretching of the pyroxene aggregates and ore minerals commonly occurred. Dislocations were found in both plagioclase and pyroxene.
