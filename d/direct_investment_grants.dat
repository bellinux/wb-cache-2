Following an average deficit of around 44 percent of GDP from 1997 to 2000, the current account deficit has increased to over 35 percent of GDP since 2001 due to higher import demand combined with lower receipts from tourism and nutmeg exports. The current account deficits are financed by inflows of foreign <b>direct</b> <b>investment,</b> official <b>grants</b> and loans, and commercial borrowing by the private sector.Grenada’s economy is vulnerable to external shocks considering its high dependence on tourism, exports, and imports {{of most of the}} goods that are consumed or invested domestically.

The most common types of foreign <b>direct</b> <b>investment</b> incentives are <b>grants</b> and tax relief.

Theory testing based on multiple case studies will be the research method employed and qualitative secondary data {{will be used in}} an exploratory manner. Specifically, Dunning's eclectic paradigm will be tested against the foreign <b>direct</b> <b>investment</b> of three multinational enterprises in Thailand, namely, Royal Dutch Shell, Toyota and Tesco. The study shows that conventional foreign <b>direct</b> <b>investment</b> theories are not powerful enough to explain all of the reasons multinational enterprises conduct foreign <b>direct</b> <b>investment</b> in Thailand. Favorable exchange rates, weak market conditions, cultural similarities, geographic proximity, profitability, availability of partners, encouraging government incentives and the future potential of the region can play a substantial role when judging why multinational enterprises conduct foreign <b>direct</b> <b>investment</b> in Thailand. This enhances our understanding of foreign <b>direct</b> <b>investment</b> theories and highlights their shortcomings when applied to Thailand.
