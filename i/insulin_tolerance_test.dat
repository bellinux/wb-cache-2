5|$|Growth hormone {{deficiency}} {{is almost}} certain if all other pituitary tests are also abnormal, and {{insulin-like growth factor 1}} (IGF-1) levels are decreased. If this is not the case, IGF-1 levels are poorly predictive of the presence of GH deficiency; stimulation testing with the <b>insulin</b> <b>tolerance</b> <b>test</b> is then required. This is performed by administering insulin to lower the blood sugar to a level below 2.2mmol/l. Once this occurs, growth hormone levels are measured. If they are low despite the stimulatory effect of the low blood sugars, growth hormone deficiency is confirmed. The test is not without risks, especially in those prone to seizures or are known to have heart disease, and causes the unpleasant symptoms of hypoglycemia. Alternative tests (such as the growth hormone releasing hormone stimulation test) are less useful, although a stimulation test with arginine may be used for diagnosis, especially in situations where an <b>insulin</b> <b>tolerance</b> <b>test</b> is thought to be too dangerous. If GH deficiency is suspected, and all other pituitary hormones are normal, two different stimulation tests are needed for confirmation.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} {{the role of}} plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 (PAI- 1) in adipose tissue development and insulin metabolism. METHODS: Aged male wild-type (WT) or transgenic mice with adipose tissue overexpression of PAI- 1 (45 - 55 weeks) in 50 % C 57 Bl/ 6 : 50 % Friend Virus B-strain (FVB) genetic background, kept on normal chow, were used without or with administration of a synthetic low molecular weight PAI- 1 inhibitor (PAI- 039) to the food (1 mg g(- 1)) for 4 weeks. RESULTS: The PAI- 1 transgenic mice showed somewhat lower body weight and adipose tissue mass than WT mice, whereas fasting insulin levels were higher. Glucose and <b>insulin</b> <b>tolerance</b> <b>tests</b> did not reveal significant differences between both genotypes. Addition of PAI- 039 to the food did not significantly affect total body fat, weight of the isolated s. c. and gonadal fat territories or their adipocyte size and blood vessel composition in either genotype. Fasting glucose levels and glucose <b>tolerance</b> <b>tests</b> were, for both genotypes, comparable with those without inhibitor treatment. Insulin levels and <b>insulin</b> <b>tolerance</b> <b>tests</b> in WT, but not in PAI- 1 transgenic mice, suggested a higher insulin sensitivity after inhibitor treatment (insulin level 30 min after glucose injection of 2. 0 +/- 0. 17 ng mL(- 1) vs. 3. 2 +/- 0. 48 ng mL(- 1) without inhibitor treatment; P = 0. 028).
