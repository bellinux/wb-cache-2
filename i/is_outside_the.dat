5|$|A granite wall {{surrounds}} the temple, enclosing all its shrines and six of its seven bodies of water. The rajagopuram, the temple's gateway tower, is unfinished. A swastika shaped temple tank built in 800 AD by Kamban Araiyan {{during the reign}} of Dantivarman <b>is</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> temple complex. The Vijayanagar and Nayak kings commissioned paintings {{on the walls of the}} shrine of Pudarikakshan, some of which are still present.|$|E
5|$|At the {{southeast}} end of Spring Street is Riverside Drive, which {{provides some of}} the most scenic views of the Ohio River and the eastern Louisville shoreline because of the limited alterations compared to other sections of the Ohio River in the Louisville area. Houseboats are docked along the Ohio River {{on the south side of}} Riverside Drive. The north side of Riverside Drive has a variety of architectural styles and is mostly residential. Unlike the other prominent streets, Riverside drive <b>is</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> flood-wall that surrounds most of the city and was built two feet higher than the height the Ohio River flood of 1937.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine, {{a common}} {{industrial}} chemical, <b>is</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> {{scope of the}} disarmament agreement; however, its use as a poison gas would violate the Chemical Weapons Convention, which Syria joined in 2013. Various parties, including Western governments, have accused Assad of conducting illegal chlorine attacks in 2014 and 2015. A late disclosure in 2014 regarding Syria's ricin program raised doubts about completeness of the government's declaration of its chemical weapons stockpile, and in early May 2015, OPCW announced that inspectors had found traces of sarin and VX nerve agent at a military research site in Syria {{that had not been}} declared previously by the Assad regime.|$|E

5|$|Cochrane's own sympathies lie most {{strongly}} with utilitarianism and liberalism; {{his own account}} is most influenced by them. He argues that rights derived from considerations of interests can protect individual animals and place limits on {{what can be done}} to them. These rights cannot be violated, even in the name of the greater good, which means that the cultural and economic practices of human beings will be affected. Anticipating criticism, Cochrane explains that not every interest leads to a right. A full consideration of this argument <b>is</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> scope of the book. The argument was expanded in Cochrane's Animal Rights Without Liberation (2012) which, though published after An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory, was based on his doctoral thesis.|$|E
5|$|Lithium-ion {{batteries}} {{may suffer}} thermal runaway and cell rupture if overheated or overcharged, and {{in extreme cases}} {{this can lead to}} combustion. To reduce these risks, lithium-ion battery packs contain fail-safe circuitry that shuts down the battery when its voltage <b>is</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> safe range. When handled improperly, or if manufactured defectively, some rechargeable batteries can experience thermal runaway resulting in overheating. Especially prone to thermal runaway are lithium-ion batteries. Reports of exploding cellphones have been reported in newspapers. In 2006, batteries from Apple, HP, Toshiba, Lenovo, Dell and other notebook manufacturers were recalled because of fire and explosions. Also, during the Boeing 787 Dreamliner's first year of service, at least four aircraft suffered from electrical system problems stemming from its lithium-ion batteries, resulting in the whole Dreamliner fleet being voluntarily grounded in January 2013.|$|E
5|$|Ravalomanana's family origins are Merina, the island's {{largest and}} most {{politically}} prominent ethnic group. The Ravalomanana family tomb <b>is</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> historic walls of the village, a placement that would typically indicate the family's origins lie with the hova (commoners' caste), rather than the andriana â€” the traditional ruling caste among the Merina that continues to exert considerable influence over political affairs in modern Madagascar. His later entry into the political sphere has made the question of his caste background one of popular interest and ongoing debate among the Malagasy public and press. Biographer Vivier (2007) maintains that the Ravalomanana family is andriana in origin.|$|E

5|$|The classic {{point in}} polygon test from {{computational}} geometry applies the above ideas. To {{determine if a}} point lies within a polygon, one casts a ray from infinity to the point and counts {{the number of times}} the ray crosses the edge of polygon. The crossing number is even if and only if the point <b>is</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> polygon. This algorithm works because if the ray never crosses the polygon, then its crossing number is zero, which is even, and the point is outside. Every time the ray does cross the polygon, the crossing number alternates between even and odd, and the point at its tip alternates between outside and inside.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{distinct}} protocols for awarding the Medal of Honor. The {{first and most}} common is nomination and approval through {{the chain of command}} of the service member. The second method is nomination {{by a member of the}} U.S. Congress, generally at the request of a constituent. In both cases, if the proposal <b>is</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> time limits for the recommendation, approval to waive the time limit requires a special Act of Congress. The Medal of Honor is presented by the President on behalf of, and in the name of, the Congress. Since 1980, nearly all Medal of Honor recipients--or in the case of posthumous awards, the next of kin--have been personally decorated by the Commander-in-Chief. Since 1941, more than half of the Medals of Honor have been awarded posthumously.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the cast}} and writers of TGS are {{preparing}} their annual Ludachristmas party in the writer's room. Tracy is annoyed because {{he is unable to}} attend due to a recent order from a courtroom judge which requires him to wear an alcohol monitoring ankle bracelet. Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) is also annoyed because he believes that none of the staff know what the true meaning of Christmas is. He cancels Ludachristmas and makes the staff sit through a talk, led by himself and Reverend Gary (John F Mooney), about the meaning of Christmas. This inspires {{the cast and}} writers to run outside of 30 Rock and tear down the big Christmas tree which <b>is</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> building. Kenneth eventually stops their efforts and Tracy reveals that he has been drinking alcohol when he should not have been.|$|E

5|$|Most {{amphibians}} {{go through}} metamorphosis, {{a process of}} significant morphological change after birth. In typical amphibian development, eggs are laid in water and larvae are adapted to an aquatic lifestyle. Frogs, toads and salamanders all hatch from the egg as larvae with external gills. Metamorphosis in amphibians is regulated by thyroxine concentration in the blood, which stimulates metamorphosis, and prolactin, which counteracts thyroxine's effect. Specific events are dependent on threshold values for different tissues. Because most embryonic development <b>is</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> parental body, it is subject to many adaptations due to specific environmental circumstances. For this reason tadpoles can have horny ridges instead of teeth, whisker-like skin extensions or fins. They also make use of a sensory lateral line organ {{similar to that of}} fish. After metamorphosis, these organs become redundant and will be reabsorbed by controlled cell death, called apoptosis. The variety of adaptations to specific environmental circumstances among amphibians is wide, with many discoveries still being made.|$|E
5|$|Under Protocol 3, Jersey {{is part of}} the European Union Customs Union of the European Community. The common customs tariff, levies {{and other}} {{agricultural}} import measures apply to trade between the island and non-Member States. There is free movement of goods and trade between the island and Member States. EU rules on freedom of movement for workers do not apply in Jersey. However, Article 4 of the Protocol requires the island's authorities to give the same treatment to all natural and legal persons of the Communities. In Pereira, the ECJ held that {{the scope of this article}} included any matter governed by the Treaties in a territory where the Treaties are fully applicable. The island is therefore within the scope of the Treaties to a limited extent, as a European Territory. To infer, as the French Ambassador and finance minister have attempted to argue, namely that the island <b>is</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> European Union and Communities without qualification is therefore simplistic, in law false. The French blacklisting of the island had to be hastily revoked when this was pointed out. As a result, Jersey is not part of the single market in financial services. It is not required to implement EU Directives on such matters as movement of capital, company law or money laundering. However, the island's close proximity (135km south) and its close association with the financial sector of the U.K. has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years, with several mainline publications (e.g., The Wall Street Journal) labelling the island a tax haven.|$|E
