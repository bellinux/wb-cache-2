5|$|According to German {{assessments}} of the initial Soviet defeat, 673,000 soldiers had been captured by the Wehrmacht in both the Vyazma and Bryansk pockets, although recent research suggests a lower—but still enormous—figure of 514,000 prisoners, reducing Soviet strength by 41%. Personnel losses of 499,001 (permanent as well as temporary) were calculated by the Soviet command. On 9 October, Otto Dietrich of the German Ministry of Propaganda, quoting Hitler himself, forecast {{in a press conference}} the imminent destruction of the armies defending Moscow. As Hitler had never <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> about a specific and verifiable military fact, Dietrich convinced foreign correspondents that the collapse of all Soviet resistance was perhaps hours away. German civilian morale—low since the start of Barbarossa—significantly improved, with rumors of soldiers home by Christmas and great riches from the future Lebensraum in the east.|$|E
5|$|Docherty {{found work}} as a {{domestic}} servant {{at the age of}} 14, before moving on to working in a factory. She tried to find a job after returning from Russia, but her travel there meant that people were unwilling to employ her. Thus she sold firewood along with her father for a while. She eventually found work at the Leith Hospital as a cleaner, because that job did not require references. She then worked as a servant for five years, before leaving to attend to her mother, who was ill. Back in Fife, she worked as an assistant to a dentist. She stated later in life that when she attended rallies with the communist party, she <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> to her employers about where she went. When the Second World War broke out in 1939, she began working in the Crombie munitions factory, before shifting to looking after children in Rosyth. The final job she held was at a cooperative bakery. She continued her work for the Communist Party while holding all of these positions.|$|E

Peter Gabriel also did a session with the band, producing demo versions of [...] "You Didn't <b>Have</b> <b>to</b> <b>Lie</b> <b>To</b> Me", [...] "That Kind Of Boy" [...] and [...] "Shipyards", and these were subsequently released as archive material.|$|R

25|$|He had a {{major role}} in the melodrama Another Time, Another Place (1958) as a British {{reporter}} named Mark Trevor, caught in a love affair opposite Lana Turner and Barry Sullivan. During filming, star Lana Turner's possessive gangster boyfriend, Johnny Stompanato, who was visiting from Los Angeles, believed she was having an affair with Connery. He stormed onto the set and pointed a gun at Connery, only to have Connery disarm him and knock him flat on his back. Stompanato was banned from the set. Connery later recounted that he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> low for a while after receiving threats from men linked to Stompanato's boss, Mickey Cohen.|$|E
25|$|The ARM2 {{featured}} a 32-bit data bus, 26-bit address space and 2732-bit registers. Eightbits {{from the program}} counter register were available for other purposes; the top sixbits (available because of the 26-bit address space) served as status flags, and the bottom twobits (available because the program counter was always word-aligned) were used for setting modes. The address bus was extended to 32bits in the ARM6, but program code still <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> within the first 64MB of memory in 26-bit compatibility mode, due to the reserved bits for the status flags. The ARM2 had a transistor count of just 30,000, compared to Motorola's six-year-older 68000 model with around 40,000. Much of this simplicity came {{from the lack of}} microcode (which represents about one-quarter to one-third of the 68000) and from (like most CPUs of the day) not including any cache. This simplicity enabled low power consumption, yet better performance than the Intel 80286. A successor, ARM3, was produced with a 4KB cache, which further improved performance.|$|E

25|$|Only {{isolated}} parties crossed no man's {{land and}} those on the right which attacked Sausage Redoubt, were burnt on the parapet by flamethrowers. Some troops of the 11th Suffolk managed to advance and join the first brigade column survivors on the Fricourt Spur {{but most of the}} first two battalions were unable to cross no man's land and the 24th Northumberland was held back in the British front line, although some troops had set off before the order arrived. The troops took what cover existed in no man's land and some of the men from the three battalions in the column, reached the crater of Lochnagar mine and dug in. A counter-attack from the 4th Company of Reserve Infantry Regiment 110, forced British troops back to the crater by midday. The party from the right-hand column left behind to capture Sausage Redoubt, tried to bomb towards it but were repulsed and two attempts by a Field Company RE and a company of the 18th Northumberland (Pioneers) Battalion to cross no man's land failed and the brigade column <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> in no man's land and wait for dark.|$|E
500|$|The {{building}} used to film {{searching for}} one of the canisters was a British Gas building in Cardiff. The scene with Jack falling off the building was performed by Curtis Rivers, John Barrowman's stunt double.

Marsters and Barrowman were used for filming close to the roof's edge.|$|E
500|$|The {{meditation}} scene required {{clips from}} previous episodes {{to appear in}} flashback. Initially, Paul Rabwin and the special effects crew cut the necessary scenes and placed them in animated bubbles. According to Rabwin, at this point, the crew was just experimenting with ideas. Eventually, the crew decided that the bubbles were too [...] "hokey", so they adopted a more standard slit-scan effect. In order to create the sequence of Scully visualizing Waterston's heart condition, Nicolas Surovy <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> naked on a platform surrounded by a blue screen. A sphere was matched via motion control as a marker for a prosthetic beating heart that was crafted and filmed separately. The two shots were then combined.|$|E

500|$|While {{filming the}} {{introductory}} scene of Karthik's character, Manohar, Sreeram <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> {{on a bed}} sheet to film. The crew pulled the sheet, with Sreeram and the camera. Sreeram made extensive use of frontal and profile close-ups, set against long shots with out-of-focus foregrounds. The scene where Manohar plays a prank on Divya's father at a coffee shop, which later {{became known as the}} [...] "Mr. Chandramouli scene", was shot in Nungambakkam. Filming was also done at Madras' Presidency College, the Schmidt Memorial on Edward Elliot's Beach and at the Madras Literary Society.

Evans and Aspinall's duties were to drive the van while on tour, and {{to set up and}} test the equipment. Mal's telephone engineering experience was valuable in setting up and maintaining the electrical equipment. The Beatles were being driven back to Liverpool from London by Evans through heavy fog on 21 January 1963, when the windscreen was hit by a pebble and crazed over, so Evans had to break a large hole in it to see the road ahead. This was in winter, so the group <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> {{one on top of the}} other in the back with a bottle of whisky and try to stay warm in the freezing temperatures; something McCartney later referred to as a [...] "Beatle sandwich".|$|E
500|$|Excited at the prospect, Åkerfeldt agreed without {{consulting}} his bandmates or record label. While his bandmates {{liked the idea}} of recording two separate albums, Åkerfeldt had to convince the label: [...] "I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> somewhat... saying that we could do this recording very soon, it won't cost more than a regular single album." [...] With most of the material written, the band rehearsed just once before entering Nacksving Studios in 2002, and again with producer Steven Wilson in Studio Fredman. Under pressure to complete both albums simultaneously, Åkerfeldt said the recording process was [...] "the toughest test of our history." [...] After recording basic tracks, the band moved production to England to first mix the heavy album, Deliverance, with Andy Sneap at Backstage Studios. [...] "Deliverance was so poorly recorded, without any organisation whatsoever," [...] Åkerfeldt claimed, that Sneap [...] "is credited as a 'saviour' in the sleeve, as he surely saved much of the recording." ...|$|E
500|$|Originally {{built to}} hold pirates, the strong room {{was just a}} few yards from the prison's sewer. It was never cleaned, had no drain, no sunlight, no fresh air—the smell was {{described}} as [...] "noisome"—and was full of rats and sometimes [...] "several barrow fulls of dung". Several prisoners told the court that it contained no bed, so that prisoners <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> on the damp floor, possibly next to corpses awaiting burial. But a group of favoured prisoners Acton had paid to police the jail told the hearing there was indeed a bed. One of them said he often chose to lie in there himself, because the strong room was so clean; the [...] "best room on the Common side of the jail", said another. This despite the court's having heard that one prisoner's left side had mortified from lying on the wet floor, and that a rat had eaten the nose, ear, cheek and left eye of another.|$|E

500|$|Edward {{became ill}} during January 1553 with a fever and cough that {{gradually}} worsened. The imperial ambassador, Jean Scheyfve, reported that [...] "he suffers {{a good deal}} when the fever is upon him, especially from a difficulty in drawing his breath, {{which is due to}} the compression of the organs on the right side". Edward felt well enough in early April to take the air in the park at Westminster and to move to Greenwich, {{but by the end of}} the month he had weakened again. By 7 May he was [...] "much amended", and the royal doctors had no doubt of his recovery. A few days later the king was watching the ships on the Thames, sitting at his window. However, he relapsed, and on 11 June Scheyfve, who had an informant in the king's household, reported that [...] "the matter he ejects from his mouth is sometimes coloured a greenish yellow and black, sometimes pink, like the colour of blood". Now his doctors believed he was suffering from [...] "a suppurating tumour" [...] of the lung and admitted that Edward's life was beyond recovery. Soon, his legs became so swollen that he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> on his back, and he lost the strength to resist the disease. To his tutor John Cheke he whispered, [...] "I am glad to die".|$|E
500|$|In the 1996 musical, Evita, Madonna {{played the}} title role of Eva Perón. For a long time, Madonna had desired to play Perón and wrote to {{director}} Alan Parker to explain why she would be perfect for the part. She said later, [...] "This is the role I was born to play. I put everything of me into this because {{it was much more}} than a role in a movie. It was exhilarating and intimidating at the same time. And I am prouder of Evita than anything else I have done." [...] After securing the role, she had vocal training and learned about the history of Argentina and Perón. During shooting she became ill several times due to the intense emotional effort required. However, as she told Oprah Winfrey, she was also pregnant during the filming: [...] "I was winded after every take. I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> on the couch every ten minutes so I could recover from dizzy spells, I was worried that I was shaking the baby around too much and that would injure it in some way." [...] Madonna wrote in her personal diary at the time: [...] "Ironically, this feeling of vulnerability and weakness is helping me in the movie. I'm sure Evita felt this way every day of her life once she discovered she was ill." ...|$|E

As the Australians outflanked the strongpoints, the Germans tried to retreat through the British barrage, which had stopped moving [...] beyond the rear trench of the Oosttaverne line. The left brigade was stopped on its right flank by fire from the German pillboxes north of the Messines–Warneton road up to the Blauwepoortbeek, [...] short of the Oosttaverne line, with many casualties. The left battalion, unaware that the 33rd Brigade (11th Division) to the north had been delayed, veered towards the north-east to try to make contact near Lumm Farm, which took the battalion across the Wambeke Spur instead of straight down. The objective was easily reached but at the Wambeek, [...] north of the intended position. The Australians extended their line further north to Polka Estaminet trying to meet the 33rd Brigade, which arrived at [...] with four tanks.
