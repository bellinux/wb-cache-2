Traders {{are not allowed to}} co-locate equipment adjacent to IEX's own servers, unlike many other trading platforms. IEX has its own low-latency links to other trading venues in the New York region, which it can use to execute trades for customers in under 320 microseconds. The point-of-presence links for traders to gain access to IEX have a built-in, round-trip delay of 700 microseconds from a 38-mile coil of fiber, so traders cannot beat IEX's own computers as orders propagate outward. [...] The <b>data</b> <b>delay</b> prevents many predatory behaviors. It deters the practice of liquidity fading, where they peer into various trading venues and try to detect orders as they propagate from a broker's order router, and use this information to withdraw liquidity ahead of toxic order flow.|$|E

The algorithm {{is designed for}} soft-decision decoding {{and is based on}} Belief-Propagation (BP) decoding using multiple bases of the dual code. Compared to other approaches for high-performance BP decoding, this method is conceptually simple and does not change at each stage of the decoding process. With its multiple BP decoders the proposed scheme achieves the performance of a standard BP algorithm with a significantly lower number of iterations per decoder realization. By this means the <b>data</b> <b>delay</b> introduced by decoding is reduced. Moreover, a significant improvement in decoding performance is achieved while keeping the <b>data</b> <b>delay</b> small.

This paper proposes a new opportunity routing protocol for data forwarding based on vehicle mobility association (OVMA). With assistance from the vehicle mobility association, data can be forwarded without passing through many extra intermediate nodes. Besides, each vehicle carries the only replica information to record its associated vehicle information, so the routing decision can adapt to the vehicle densities.

Many published clock skew budgets neglect voltage jitter and process variation, which are becoming dominant factors in otherwise balanced-trees.

This paper describes the major sources of clock skew in a microprocessor using a modified-tree and applies the model to a second-generation Itanium-M processor family microprocessor currently under design. Monte Carlo simulation is used to develop statistical clock skew budgets for setup and hold time constraints in a four-level skew hierarchy.

30|$|To better {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} our proposed algorithm, three strategies are considered in the simulations. The first strategy uses Lyapunov optimization algorithm. The latter two strategies (second and third strategies) use simple greedy algorithm. The second strategy deploys “absorb-upon-arrival” policy, which describes such scenario: when the energy in rechargeable battery cannot meet the need of the transmitter, the transmitter immediately draws energy from the power grid for sending data, which results in the least <b>data</b> <b>delay</b> time, but possibly more energy consumption from the power grid. The third strategy deploys the policy “absorb-at-deadline,” {{which means that the}} transmitter uses only renewable energy before deadline, and does not draw energy from the power grid even if the EH source cannot meet the need of the transmitter until any <b>data</b> <b>delay</b> exceed the maximum, where the deadline is set to 25 slots.|$|E

Besides the decoding performance, the <b>data</b> <b>delay</b> caused by the channel code is of great importance as this is a crucial factor for many applications. Convolutional codes are known to show a good performance while imposing only a very low latency on the data. LDPC codes yield superior decoding performance but impose a larger delay due to the block structure. The results obtained by comparison will also be related to theoretical limits obtained from random coding and the sphere packing bound. It will be shown that convolutional codes are still the first choice for applications for which a very low <b>data</b> <b>delay</b> is required and the bit error rate is the considered performance criterion. However, if one focuses on a low signal-to-noise ratio or if the obtained frame error rate is the base for comparison, LDPC codes compare favorably...|$|E

The adaptive component makes data terminals autonomously change their transmission rate according to the total (voice+data) channel occupancy, so that the minimum possible <b>data</b> <b>delay,</b> which can be analytically obtained by defining a birth-death process, is almost always achieved. Moreover, by means of a simplified cellular model, the proposed algorithm revealed the same behavior, i. e., it tries to select the most suitable transmission rate at any time slot, when it is affected by intercell interference and even by power control imperfections. Finally, in order to gain more insight into the potentials of such an access strategy, the adaptive S-ALOHA CDMA scheme is then compared to a reservation time-division multiple-access (TDMA) -based protocol (PRMA++), showing the benefits of the CDMA-based solution in terms of capacity, flexibility, and <b>data</b> <b>delay</b> performance.

Several design challenges are first indentified and analyzed in depth using actual GPS position data gathered from a farm trial. Two analysis metrics, Connection Availability and Connection Duration, are used to quantify impact of cattle moving behavior and device duty cycle on network connectivity. Based on the results of this analysis, a practical communication scheme called Direct Forwarding (DF) is proposed particularly for free-ranging cattle monitoring applications where communications take place in a non real-time manner. The proposed DF scheme has been implemented using the MICAz sensor node as a development platform.

The method is applied to both simulated and experimental data from an electronic analog circuit of the Mackey–Glass system. Better results are obtained for the modular than for feedforward neural networks for the same number of parameters. It is found that the complexity of the neural network model required to reconstruct nonlinear dynamics does not increase with the delay time. Synchronization between the data and the model with diffusive coupling is also achieved.
