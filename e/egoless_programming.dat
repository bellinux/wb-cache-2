50|$|The <b>egoless</b> <b>programming</b> {{team will}} contain groups of ten or fewer programmers. Code is {{exchanged}} and goals are set amongst the group members. Leadership is rotated {{within the group}} according {{to the needs and}} abilities required during a specific time. The lack of structure in the egoless team can result in a weakness of efficiency, effectiveness and error detection for large-scale projects. <b>Egoless</b> <b>programming</b> teams work best for tasks that are very complex. Individuals that are a part of a decentralized programming team report higher job satisfaction.|$|E
50|$|<b>Egoless</b> <b>programming</b> is a {{style of}} {{computer}} programming in which personal factors are minimized so that quality may be improved. The cooperative methods suggested {{are similar to those}} used by other collective ventures such as Wikipedia.|$|E
5000|$|A {{programming}} team {{is a team}} {{of people}} who develop or maintain computer software. [...] They may be organised in numerous ways, but the <b>egoless</b> <b>programming</b> team and chief programmer team are two common structures typically used.|$|E
50|$|<b>Egoless</b> <b>programming</b> {{explicitly}} minimizes {{constraints of}} hierarchy and status {{so as to}} enable the free exchange of ideas and improvements. It may be contrasted with the chief programmer team concept which emphasises specialisation and leadership in teams so that they work in a more disciplined way.|$|E
50|$|To ensure quality, {{reviews of}} code by other programmers are made. The concept of <b>egoless</b> <b>programming</b> emphasises that such reviews {{should be made}} in a friendly, collegial way in which {{personal}} feelings are put aside. Structured walkthroughs are one way of making such a formal review.|$|E
50|$|Before cheap Internet, {{there were}} some {{geographically}} compact communities where the culture encouraged Weinberg's <b>egoless</b> <b>programming,</b> and a developer could easily attract a lot of skilled kibitzers and co-developers. Bell Labs, the MIT AI and LCS labs, UC Berkeley: these became the home of innovations that are legendary and still potent.|$|E
40|$|Recently and I {{have had}} reason to look through some old {{software}} engineering textbooks, {{the kind of thing}} I used to read as an undergraduate and junior programmer. This is reminded me of a few concepts I haven't thought about in several years. One of these is <b>egoless</b> <b>programming.</b> As I recall my university lecturers where very keen on this concept, {{it seemed to be a}} good thing. Although, to be honest, I’ve always had my doubts [...] . What exactly is <b>egoless</b> <b>programming?</b> I guess it all depends on what you mean by ego, so I turned to my favourite text on management and psychological (and all that kind of stuff) where I found the following definition: “ego has to make sense of the internal conflict in our mind between the id and superego and the external world. The ego is the decision-making part of personality and is engaged in rational and logical thinking. It is governed by the reality principle. " (Mullins, 2002) Now this looks a bit confusing. Does <b>egoless</b> <b>programming</b> mean programming without rational and logical thinking? Well, I’ve seen my fair share programs and I must say a lot of them do seem a lack rational and logical thinking, but I really don't think anyone wants to advocate this is a design and programming technique. What would an irrational program look like? What would an illogica...|$|E
40|$|Software {{organizations}} {{have relied on}} process and technology initiatives {{to compete in a}} highly globalized world. Unfortunately, that has led to little or no success. We propose that the organizations start working on people initiatives, such as inspiring egoless behavior among software developers. This paper proposes a multi-stage approach to develop egoless behavior and discusses the universality of the egoless behavior by studying cohorts from three different countries, i. e., Japan, India, and Canada. The three stages in the approach are self-assessment, peer validation, and action plan development. The paper covers the first stage of self-assssment using an instrument based on Lamont Adams Ten commandments (factors) of <b>egoless</b> <b>programming,</b> seven of the factors are general, whereas three are related to coding behavior. We found traces of universality in the egoless behavior among the three cohorts such as {{there was no difference in}} egoless behaviours between Indian and Canadian cohorts and both Indian and Japanese cohorts had difficulties in behaving in egoless manner in coding activities than in general activities...|$|E
