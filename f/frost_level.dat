50|$|The ground {{supporting}} an adobe structure {{should be}} compressed, as {{the weight of}} adobe wall is significant and foundation settling may cause cracking of the wall. Footing depth is to below the ground <b>frost</b> <b>level.</b> The footing and stem wall are commonly 24 and 14 inches thick, respectively. Modern construction codes call {{for the use of}} reinforcing steel in the footing and stem wall. Adobe bricks are laid by course. Adobe walls usually never rise above two stories as they are load bearing and adobe has low structural strength. When creating window and door openings, a lintel is placed on top of the opening to support the bricks above. Atop the last courses of brick, bond beams made of heavy wood beams or modern reinforced concrete are laid to provide a horizontal bearing plate for the roof beams and to redistribute lateral earthquake loads to shear walls more able to carry the forces. To protect the interior and exterior adobe walls, finishes such as mud plaster, whitewash or stucco can be applied. These protect the adobe wall from water damage, but need to be reapplied periodically. Alternatively, the walls can be finished with other nontraditional plasters that provide longer protection. Bricks made with stabilized adobe generally do not need protection of plasters.|$|E
40|$|The {{accepted}} {{practice of}} laying water lines {{has been to}} place them well below the anticipated <b>frost</b> <b>level.</b> This is not always possible or practical however, since the {{depth of frost penetration}} is extremely variable for different winters and for different locations. Under certain circumstances it may be desirable or necessary to limit the depth of trenching and provide a means of maintaining the pipe temperature above freezing; various means are available such as insulation, electric heaters, and recirculation. Proper application and use of these heating methods requires a knowledge of the heat loss from buried pipes under diverse conditions. The heat loss can be estimated by various theoretical equations provided the thermal conductivity of the soil (k) and a temperature difference (Äè) between the pipes and the surrounding soil are known. Therefore, the use and application of these theoretical equations presents three problems, namely: 1) The need to experimentally check their accuracy. 2) The determination of in situ thermal conductivity of Saskatchewan soils. 3) Selection of a simple means for arriving at Äè, which requires a means of predicting the soil temperature at any depth for various surface conditions.

Because the stones are widely disseminated, removing fieldstone is a widespread and costly activity in early agricultural settlement.

Until the 19th century, fieldstone was removed exclusively by hand, often with whole families participating in this task. Depending on the harshess of winters, this task {{would need to be}} repeated whenever <b>frost</b> <b>levels</b> would churn new stones into soil surfaces.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine if {{temperature}} conditions potentially causing frost damage have an effect on radial growth in Norway spruce and Scots pine in Finland. We hypothesized that frost damage occurs and reduces radial growth after (1) extreme cold winter temperatures, (2) <b>frost</b> hardiness <b>levels</b> insufficient to minimum temperatures, and (3) the lack of insulating snow cover during freezing temperatures, resulting in increased frost and decreased temperatures in soil. Meteorological records were used to define variables describing the conditions of each hypothesis and a dynamic frost hardiness model was used to find events of insufficient <b>frost</b> hardiness <b>levels.</b> As <b>frost</b> damage is likely to occur only under exceptional conditions, we used generalized extreme value distributions to describe the frost variables. Our results did not show strong connections between radial growth and the frost damage events.

Scots pine did not show significant growth reductions associated with any of the studied variables. Thus, radial growth in Norway spruce may be more sensitive to future changes in winter conditions. Our results demonstrate that considering only temperature is unlikely to be sufficient in studying winter temperature effects on tree growth. Instead, understanding the effects of changing temperature and snow conditions in relation to tree physiology and phenology is needed...|$|R

50|$|Seedlings vary {{in their}} {{susceptibility}} to injury from frost. Damage can be catastrophic if “unhardened” seedlings are exposed to frost. Frost hardiness may {{be defined as the}} minimum temperature at which a certain percentage of a random seedling population will survive or will sustain a given level of damage (Siminovitch 1963, Timmis and Worrall 1975). The term LT50 (lethal temperature for 50% of a population) is commonly used. Determination of frost hardiness in Ontario is based on electrolyte leakage from mainstem terminal tips 2 cm to 3 cm long in weekly samplings (Colombo and Hickie 1987). The tips are frozen then thawed, immersed in distilled water, the electrical conductivity of which depends on the degree to which cell membranes have been ruptured by freezing releasing electrolyte.

The symptoms produced by artificial freezing are distinct from those found in dieback disease, and temperature measurements in diseased and healthy stands suggest that frosts are not severe enough to account for the disease. The lower hardiness levels in disease susceptible areas are therefore considered to be of secondary importance and are probably a result of a weakened physiological condition in the tree.

40|$|Once ice {{forms in}} highly {{saturated}} concrete material, internal tensile stress will be generated and causes {{damage to the}} material, which {{is a serious problem}} for concrete structures in cold and wet regions. On one hand, each component (porous body, ice and liquid) should satisfy the compatibility of stress and strain, which has been discussed by the poromechanical theories. On the other hand, if some empty voids exist, the hydraulic pressure will release when liquid water escapes from the expanded area according to Darcy's law. Recent closed freeze-thaw tests on the saturated mortar showed a consistent tendency: as the number of freeze-thaw cycles (FTC) increases, the deformation changes from the expansion to the contraction. In order to make clear the physical and mechanical changes during this process, a more comprehensive hydraulic model is developed, which combines both the mechanisms mentioned above. The estimated strain behavior by this model is in a good agreement with experimental measurements, and also, it has good potential and is more flexible to be applied to different cases such as different saturation degrees and cooling rates.

40|$|Abstract Three {{different}} {{studies were}} conducted to elucidate the effects of copper (Cu) and nickel (Ni) on Scots pine needles. One was the Monchegorsk smelter emission gradient study on the Kola Peninsula, Russia, the second was the 3 -year seedling and 6 -year adult tree low-level CuNi and acid rain (H 2 SO 4 at pH 3) irrigation study at Kevo, Finland. In the third study seedlings were exposed to Cu and Ni for a one season in Oulu, Finland. Ni accumulated efficiently in needles, and this accumulation was seen {{in each of the}} different studies. The Cu concentrations remained low in needles, except near the Monchegorsk smelters. The addition of Ni together with Cu in Oulu seemed to enhance the accumulation of Ni into the needles of Scots pine seedlings. Plasmolysis may be related to both drought and the Ni treatment, as observed in Oulu, because plasmolysis was statistically more abundant in the 15 mg Ni kg- 1 dry soil treated needles than in other treatments except in 25 mg Ni kg- 1 dry soil. Cu induced lipid peroxidation of chloroplast membranes was visible under transmission electron microscope (TEM) as light colored, swollen thylakoids in chloroplasts near the Monchegorsk smeltersand also in needles exposed to 25 Ni+ 50 Cu mg kg- 1 in soil in Oulu.

40|$|Crop frost, {{one kind}} of agro-meteorological disaster, often causes {{significant}} loss to agriculture. Thus, evaluating the risk of wheat frost aids scientific response to such disasters, which will ultimately promote food security. Therefore, this paper aims to propose an integrated risk assessment model of wheat frost, based on meteorological data and a hybrid fuzzy neural network model, taking China as an example. With {{the support of a}} geographic information system (GIS), a comprehensive method was put forward. Firstly, threshold temperatures of wheat frost at three growth stages were proposed, referring to phenology in different wheat growing areas and the meteorological standard of Degree of Crop Frost Damage (QX/T 88 - 2008). Secondly, a vulnerability curve illustrating the relationship between frost hazard intensity and wheat yield loss was worked out using hybrid fuzzy neural network model. Finally, the wheat frost risk was assessed in China. Results show that our proposed threshold temperatures are more suitable than using 0 °C in revealing the spatial pattern of frost occurrence, and hybrid fuzzy neural network model can further improve the accuracy of the vulnerability curve of wheat subject to frost with limited historical hazard records. Both these advantages ensure the precision of wheat frost risk assessment. In China, frost widely distributes in 85. 00 % of the total winter wheat planting area, but mainly to the north of 35 °N; the southern boundary of wheat frost has moved northward, potentially because of the warming climate. There is a significant trend that suggests high risk areas will enlarge and gradually expand to the south, with the risk levels increasing from a return period of 2 years to 20 years. Among all wheat <b>frost</b> risk <b>levels,</b> the regions with loss rate ranges from 35. 00 % to 45. 00 % account for the largest area proportion, ranging from 58. 60 % to 63. 27 %.

The objective of this thesis was to analyse the performance of porous pavements during freezing, thawing, and snowmelting conditions in order to evaluate if the porous pavement is suitable for stormwater management and road construction in cold climate regions. A full-scale porous pavement construction was built in 1993 / 1994 in a residential area on the outskirts of Luleå, Northern Sweden (N: 65 ° 36 ´, E: 22 ° 13 ´).

The draining function of the porous asphalt at different ambient air temperatures in the range - 10 °C to + 20 °C was investigated in the laboratory.

40|$|An {{interesting}} area of enquiry in read-ing {{science is}} {{the ways in}} which differ-ent writing systems represent language. Discussions have centered around the adaptations seen between writing systems and languages (Perfetti and Harris, 2013) and the related notions of deservedness of a writing system for a language (Halliday, 1977), optimality (<b>Frost,</b> 2012) and <b>level</b> of orthography-language or “grapholin-guistic ” equilibrium (Seidenberg, 2011). Among the many ideas of relative good-ness of writing systems is also a misplaced superiority assigned to alphabet-based orthographies, which has been critically labeled as “alphabetism ” (Share, 2014). Share counters the superiority claim with psychoacoustic, historic, anthropological and preliminary experimental evidence to show that syllable-based writing systems are perhaps the better system, at least for some aspects of the orthography-language relationship. The defining parameters for placing symbol systems in a hierarchy are however, as yet, unclear (see Frost, 2012 for a discussion). It is for this very reason that reading research (and the practice it influ-ences) must be alert to unqualified gen-eralizations made from studies conducted in a single writing system. Evidence from robust cross-orthographic experimenta-tion is the best moderator of such univer-salism. The burgeoning body of work from the Chinese languages has for example broadened the field, and perhaps snuffed out “alphabetism ” in some domains (e. g., neural bases of reading and the preferred ordering of symbols as linear: Perfetti et al., 2010).

Here, the process of crossing the local threshold for ice-wedge stability may be favored by a press occurrence such as long-term, gradual increases in summer air temperature, mean annual air temperature and/or possibly winter precipitation, but our observations suggest it is most likely initiated by pulse atmospheric forcing such as extreme summer warmth and/or winter precipitation.

Within a given year, western ragweed density was seasonally constant, similar among treatments, and independent of preceding-year species composition. Severe defoliation of western ragweed had little effect on subsequent-year populations, indicating an ability to maintain primordia for several years with limited plant growth.

Several techniques were employed including REC%, IR thermography and molecular analysis of cold acclimation in order to characterise the frost resistance of those two varieties. REC% revealed that both Claire and Abu-Ghariab could tolerate some freezing when the spikes were just visible (ZCK 51 - 60) with an acclimation shift of the LT 50 of - 1. 6 and - 2. 11 °C respectively but this was not apparent at later growth stages. Based on molecular analysis, cold acclimation was shown to be activated at ZCK 51 - 60 in both varieties. Cbf 14 was expressed after 8 hours exposure to acclimatising temperatures (4 °C) and then declined to a low, but still up-regulated level in both varieties and this led to expression of the COR 15 a protein. These molecular changes correlated with the frost tolerance recorded at ZCK 51 - 60. It was concluded that the possibility existed to up-regulate cold acclimation after spike emergence if there was enough environmental stimulus. Molybdenum (Mo) was demonstrated to work synergistically with low temperature in increasing the expression of Cbf 14 and COR 15 a. The European wheat cv. Claire showed a higher capacity (- 8. 14 °C) to be acclimated than Iraqi wheat (- 7. 40 °C) under the effect of both Mo and acclimation temperatures. Mo alone increased the expression of Cbf 14 in both varieties but did not increase the frost tolerance. Observations of ice nucleation using an infrared thermography (IR) revealed that supercooling is highly likely in spikes and some spikes avoided frost damage even when the temperature fell to - 12 °C. It was observed that the proportion of frozen spikes was 22. 8 % while the remainder supercooled. Spraying plants with distilled water was not effective in facilitating ice nucleation in wheat spikes. Observations also revealed that spikes that did freeze started freezing at temperatures of - 4 to - 5 °C close to temperature of the putative constitutive frost hardiness of un-acclimated wheat and it is suggested that this may reflect that many laboratory freezing experiments may not actually freeze until - 5 °C. The anthesis stage of wheat was found to be the most vulnerable stage and it needs to be given more attention in terms of research to up-regulate cold acclimation. Frost damage to wheat during flowering continues to be a serious problem in certain production areas and therefore continued effort in characterising and finding suitable solutions to this are imperative.

40|$|Cold {{stress is}} the most {{important}} factor limiting the northern expansion of Malus cultivation, and breeding for improved cold resistance is time-consuming and laborious. Members in the genus Malus are characteristically heterozygous and reveal a high variability in the hardiness of their seedlings. This study was conducted to develop an appropriate acclimation routine to identify cold hardy transgressive segregants from Malus seedling populations. The effects of frosts (16 hours at - 3 Â°C) and lag-times (10 and 11 days at + 3 to + 5 Â°C), short (8 hour) day and cool (+ 3 to + 5 Â°C) temperature exposures, and different screening temperatures (- 20, - 30, and - 40 Â°C) were investigated on seedlings grown in a greenhouse from open-pollinated Golden Delicious (Malus pumila), Antonovka (Malus baccata) X (Malus pumila) and Rescue Crab (Malus baccata) X (Malus pumila). Differentiation in hardiness response of the seedling populations was not achieved until after exposure to short days at cool temperatures for six weeks. Further population differentiation was achieved by exposure to one or more frosts compared to no frost exposures. Rescue gave a 74 % increase in survival, Antonovka a 62 % increase, and Golden Delicious a 51 % increase, when compared to survival with no frosts. After the acclimation response had been initiated by exposure to short days at cool temperatures, up to 11 days in the same conditions caused no significant decrease in hardiness. Additionally, no significant decrease in survival was observed in seedlings held at cool temperatures and short days for up to 10 days after a <b>frost</b> exposure. Hardiness <b>levels</b> of acclimated and non-acclimated seedlings agreed with known inherent hardiness responses for all three cultivars evaluated. Cultivar seedling response to different freeze temperatures was pronounced. For crosses representing a full range of cold hardiness capabilities, a screening temperature close to - 30 Â°C was found to be most effective. The response of the different cultivar seedlings to the three different freeze temperatures indicated that the screen could be tailored to fit the minimum survival requirements of a particular region. A binomial form of regrowth data collection, percent seedling survival, was determined to be the most efficient and precise measure of evaluation. The controlled three-step freeze procedure and thawing rate that was developed, will facilitate rapid, repeatable screening of large numbers of progeny. An examination of replication means revealed that the probability of survival was influenced by when the seedlings grew in the greenhouse. It is recommended that, for subsequent screens, all the material should be grown at the same time...|$|R
