In February 1981, Obama made his first public speech, calling for Occidental to {{participate}} in the <b>disinvestment</b> from South Africa in response to that nation's policy of apartheid. In mid-1981, Obama traveled to Indonesia to visit his mother and half-sister Maya, and visited the families of college friends in Pakistan and India for three weeks. Later in 1981, he transferred as a junior to Columbia University in New York City, where he majored in political science with a specialty in international relations and in English literature and lived off-campus on West 109th Street. He graduated with a BA degree in 1983 and worked for about a year at the Business International Corporation, where he was a financial researcher and writer, then as a project coordinator for the New York Public Interest Research Group on the City College of New York campus for three months in 1985.|$|E
25|$|Sanctions {{took the}} forms, variously, of {{withdrawing}} balances from (the US branches of) Swiss banks, <b>disinvestment</b> in Swiss banks and their various investment vehicles, <b>disinvestment</b> in Swiss companies, and in companies of other nationalities with operations or markets in Switzerland. Hevesi {{and a number}} of his accomplices further undertook to deny regulatory permissions to Swiss banks seeking to expand their activities in their jurisdictions.|$|E

25|$|Noam Chomsky {{argues that}} for maximum impact, <b>disinvestment</b> campaigns should target the {{corporations}} {{participating in the}} perceived human rights abuses, with Caterpillar Inc. given as an example due to {{their role in the}} demolition of Palestinian homes.|$|E
25|$|A notable {{campaign}} was initiated in 2002 and endorsed by South Africa's Desmond Tutu. Tutu {{said that the}} campaign against Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories and its continued settlement expansion should be modeled on the successful historical, but controversial, <b>disinvestment</b> campaign against South Africa's apartheid system.|$|E
25|$|Critics of the {{proposals}} argue that making unilateral demands on Israel will not promote negotiation and a just peace. Furthermore, <b>disinvestment,</b> it is claimed, would hurt Palestinians more than any other, as all of the Israeli factories located beyond the Green Line employ Palestinian workers, providing 70,000 jobs for Palestinians.|$|E

25|$|In {{many western}} countries, {{such as the}} United States, the United Kingdom (where the Anti-Apartheid Movement was based) and the Commonwealth there was much debate over the {{imposition}} of economic sanctions in order to weaken Botha and undermine the white regime. By the late 1980s – as foreign investment in South Africa declined – <b>disinvestment</b> began to have a serious effect on the nation's economy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Disinvestment</b> {{campaigns have}} {{been focused on}} {{high-profile}} organizations with large financial holdings such as heavily endowed universities or churches and municipalities managing large portfolios of retirement fund investments. Such high-profile institutions, like Harvard University or the multimillion-member Presbyterian and Methodist Churches, provided divestment proponents a platform from which to spotlight their political activity. In addition, the wide financial holdings of these institutions generally provided divestment campaigns a list of stocks upon which to base their calls for divestment.|$|E
25|$|Also in 1986, CUSA {{joined with}} the Azanian Confederation of Trade Unions (AZACTU) to form the National Council of Trade Unions (NACTU), and Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi created the United Workers' Union of South Africa (UWUSA), {{particularly}} to oppose <b>disinvestment</b> in South Africa. The UWUSA eventually faded from view, but not before revelations in July 1991 that it had collaborated with anti-union employers in a campaign against both COSATU and NACTU activists, and had received at least 1.5 million Rand from the security police.|$|E

30|$|Regarding {{capacity}} adjustments, we introduce alternatively selectable capacity profiles {{that allow}} for the assignment of capacity sequences to locations, starting {{with the beginning of}} the time period a location is opened or continued from the initial configuration. This enables capturing the monetary consequences of changes in capacity levels in subsequent time periods (cash outflows from investments, cash inflows from <b>disinvestments)</b> on the one hand, and reducing the model complexity (see Sect.  4 and results in Sect.  6) by focusing on the feasible/desired capacity sequences (see Sect.  3) on the other hand.|$|R
25|$|Although African-American neighborhoods {{may suffer}} from civic <b>disinvestment,</b> with lower-quality schools, less-effective {{policing}} and fire protection, there are {{institutions such as}} churches and museums and political organizations that help to improve the physical and social capital of African-American neighborhoods. In African-American neighborhoods the churches may be important sources of social cohesion. For some African Americans, the kind spirituality learned through these churches works as a protective factor against the corrosive forces of racism. Museums devoted to African-American history are also found in many African-American neighborhoods.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1930s the Works Progress Administration dubbed the area “the Park Avenue for the Middle Class”, {{and the area}} {{maintained}} that reputation through the 1950s. The Concourse inspired visits by presidential candidate Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, and John F. Kennedy. However, after 1960, the area began to decline quickly due to white flight, incentives {{to move to the}} suburbs, redlining, the development of Co-Op City, <b>disinvestment</b> by New York City, and arson. While no buildings burned down in the Concourse during the period, the population of the area declined until the 1990s when the population started to rebound.|$|E
25|$|Employees used {{slowdown}} in October 2000, to press a revision to their incentive-linked pay. In parallel, after elections {{and a new}} central government led by NDA alliance, India pursued a <b>disinvestment</b> policy. Along with many other government owned companies, the new administration proposed to sell part of its stake in Maruti Suzuki in a public offering. The worker's union opposed this sell-off plan {{on the grounds that}} the company will lose a major business advantage of being subsidised by the Government, and the union has better protection while the company remains in control of the government.|$|E

25|$|Aging {{housing stock}} and more {{closures}} {{in what was}} left of the steel industry continued to negatively impact Union-Miles Park in the 1990s. Although a few market-rate housing developments were built in the 1990s, the area population declined 10.8 percent from 1990 to 2000. The population loss was greatest among middle-class families, which led to even greater <b>disinvestment</b> in housing and the loss of the neighborhood's few retail districts. Poverty levels rose to 28.0 percent, and 9.1 of all housing units in the neighborhood were vacant. John Adams High School closed in 1995 and was torn down in 1999. Mt. Pleasant School was also closed in 1995 (and scheduled for demolition by the end of 2017).|$|E
25|$|The post–World War II {{economic}} expansion and subsequent suburbanization {{had a profound}} impact on the physical development of the city's neighborhoods. From 1950 to 1970, 97,000 housing units were built in Marion County. Most of this new construction occurred outside Center Township, expediting out-migration from the city's urban neighborhoods to suburban areas, such as Castleton, Eagledale, and Nora. Between 1950 and 1990, over 155,000 residents left Center Township, resulting in urban blight and <b>disinvestment.</b> Since the 2000s, Downtown Indianapolis and surrounding neighborhoods have seen increased reinvestment attributed to nationwide demographic trends, driven by empty nesters and millennials. By 2020, Downtown is projected to have 30,000 residential units, compared to 18,300 in 2010.|$|E
25|$|Zimbabwe Defence Industries {{operates}} a facility in Domboshawa, known as Elphida, where it manufactures arms and munitions. It is also said {{to own a}} mortar shell plant, where 155mm artillery shells, rocket launchers and hand grenades were once produced. Since 2008 the main factory operated at a greatly reduced level of productivity, only offering small arms and small arms ammunition. American and European Union sanctions and <b>disinvestment,</b> compounded by an exodus of technically skilled personnel, have badly damaged the ZDI's ability to continue manufacturing. The factory machinery is antiquated and no resources are available to replace or even refurbish it. ZDI still possesses a preexisting stockpile of ammunition but can no longer meet its immediate overhead costs, including raw materials. As of March 2015 Managing Director Dube confirmed that all production lines had been halted.|$|E
5000|$|State and Cities - Millions {{of dollars}} in state and city pension funds are {{invested}} in American corporations doing business in Northern Ireland. The MacBride Campaign lobbies to have legislation passed to direct these funds to be invested, in the future, only in companies that endorse the Principles (again, note, not divestment or <b>disinvestments).</b> This is the first step. The second step — once the MacBride Principles investment law has been passed — is to lobby cities and states to enact a [...] "selective purchasing" [...] law, barring the state or city from purchasing goods or services from companies in Northern Ireland that have not endorsed the Principles.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the problem of supply chain design of {{multisite}} enterprises. To model this problem, we formulate a multi-commodity, multi-echelon and multi-period mixed-integer program. This model enables decision-makers to determine the opening, closing and state of each facility, the material flows in the network and the capacity investments and <b>disinvestments.</b> The main objective is to maximize the profit of the multisite enterprise subject to constraints imposed by demand, capacity, availability of raw material, bill of material, flow conservation and state of facilities. To solve the mathematical model, we use the branch and bound algorithm. In this paper, we present the problem, its mathematical modeling, the solving approach and the obtained numerical results...|$|R
40|$|The {{purposes}} of this work is threefold. First, {{it is important to}} see how the hypotheses developed in the theory of corporate finance should be adjusted to be applied in the private equity context. Second, the paper illustrates the characteristics of the Italian private equity market in terms of investments, operators, fund raising, <b>disinvestments</b> and performance. The AIFI (Associazione Italiana del Private Equity e Venture Capital) and PEM (Private Equity Monitoring) data are used. Third, the paper gives an idea of private equity role at firm level. In particular, the results of some studies show that the equity investments: facilitates the firm’s growth; improves the corporate governance; helps the firms during crises; improves the economic and financial communication...|$|R
25|$|By 1970, central Jamaica Plain was {{considered}} to be in a state of decline. The intrusion of the Southwest Corridor coupled with and possibly contributing to a decision by Boston banks to cut back mortgage lending (redline) there began a cycle of <b>disinvestment</b> which led to the deterioration of the housing stock, slumlording and abandonment particularly in the central neighborhood along the edges of the corridor. In some cases, homeowners who could not sell {{due to a lack of}} buyer financing simply walked away from older homes along the corridor's periphery. Urban Edge, founded as a non-profit real estate firm in 1974, found it necessary to recruit volunteer tenants to physically take possession of empty properties to prevent vandalism and arson. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the average life span of an abandoned building was approximately one week. Windows were broken, copper plumbing was stripped out, and buildings were torched.|$|E
25|$|Moses's {{critics charge}} that he {{preferred}} automobiles over people. They {{point out that he}} displaced hundreds of thousands of residents in New York City, destroying traditional neighborhoods by building multiple expressways through them. These projects contributed to the ruin of the South Bronx and the amusement parks of Coney Island, caused the departure of the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants Major League baseball teams, and precipitated the decline of public transport due to <b>disinvestment</b> and neglect. His building of expressways hindered the proposed expansion of the New York City Subway from the 1930s well into the 1960s, because the parkways and expressways that were built replaced, at least to some extent, the planned subway lines; the 1968 Program for Action, which was never completed, was hoped to counter this. Other {{critics charge that}} he precluded the use of public transit, which would have allowed non-car-owners to enjoy the elaborate recreation facilities he built, and close associates of Moses claimed that they could keep African Americans from using pools in white neighborhoods by making the water too cold.|$|E

40|$|Russian {{agriculture}} in transition (1991 - 1998) was characterised by a production collapse due to aloss in {{quality and quantity}} of acreage, <b>disinvestments,</b> falling purchasingpower, and increasedimports. Neither traditional agriculture nor the nascent family farm sector havebeen able to ensure sustained food production. Instead, the impoverishment of the population hasresulted in a considerable increase in the relative importance of household food production. In the present paper some features of household food production are explored: (1) thedevelopment in acreage used forHFP, (2) the number of people involved over the years, (3) the availability anduse of the necessary factors of production, such as land, labour, and variable inputs, (4) characteristics of households involved, and (5) implications for welfare. ...|$|R
30|$|With {{regard to}} supply chain planning, there are cash flows {{resulting}} from configuration decisions, which {{are composed of}} cash outflows referring to location and capacity investments (e.g., opening of plant and warehouse locations and purchase of resources) and cash inflows resulting from location and capacity <b>disinvestments.</b> Additionally, there are cash outflows for the availability of plant and warehouse locations (e.g., rent, maintenance), cash outflows concerning procurement, production, storage and transport as well as cash outflows resulting from supplier business relations (e.g., receipt and inspection of raw materials) and market penetration (e.g., marketing and sales manager). The sum of all decisions creates the base for the supply chain operations. Cash inflows result from the commercialization at sales markets, but cannot be allocated to a single decision.|$|R
40|$|By {{means of}} a simple {{economic}} model, Shleifer and Vishny (1989) describe how top managers can entrench themselves by specific overinvestment. An extension of the model with additional investments exposes interdependencies that exceed the primary value of explanation. The extension of the model focuses on investment behaviour {{and the impact of}} the market for corporate control on managerial entrenchment. Despite specific over-investment, total corporate investment does not change. Increased specific investments are balanced by appropriate <b>disinvestments</b> {{in other areas of the}} company. Additionally, more competition does not necessarily discipline the manager. In fact, a competitor can increase the divergence between managers and shareholders. An increase in managerial competence on the part of the competitor can even induce a loss of wealth for all actors. [...] ...|$|R
