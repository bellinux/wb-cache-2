5|$|Beginning in {{the summer}} of 1962 and {{continuing}} over the next few years, members of the PDP-1 programming community at MIT, including Russell and the other Hingham Institute members, began to spread out to other schools and employers such as Stanford University and DEC, and as they did they spread the game to other universities and institutions with a PDP-1 computer. As a result, Spacewar was perhaps the first video game to be available outside a single research institute. Over the next decade, programmers at these other institutions began coding their own variants, including features such as allowing more ships and players at once, replacing the hyperspace feature with a cloaking <b>device,</b> <b>space</b> mines, and even a first-person perspective version played on two screens that simulates each pilot's view out of the cockpit. Some of these Spacewar installations also replicated Kotok and Saunders' gamepad. According to a second-hand account heard by Russell while working at DEC, Spacewar was reportedly used as a smoke test by DEC technicians on new PDP-1 systems before shipping {{because it was the only}} available program that exercised every aspect of the hardware. Although the game was widespread for the era, it was still very limited in its direct reach: the PDP-1 was priced at US$120,000 and only 55 were ever sold, most without a monitor and many of the remainder to secure military locations or research labs with no free computer time, which prevented the original Spacewar from reaching beyond a narrow, academic audience. Though some later DEC models, such as the PDP-6, came with Spacewar pre-loaded, the audience for the game remained very limited; the PDP-6, for example, sold only 23 units.|$|E

Local skin-friction coefficients were measured for single and multi-element arrays of thin plates suspended in a fully turbulent, flat plate, boundary layer at R(theta) = 3, 000. Effects of these devices were measured more than 300 boundary-layer thicknesses downstream to R(theta) = 17, 000. It was found that {{although most of the}} devices reduced the local skin friction immediately downstream, this reduced skin-friction region persisted for only 100 - 120 delta- 0, after which a rapid rise in skin-friction coefficient occurred, often exceeding flat plate values. Net drag reductions were obtained only for tandem configurations and these reductions were sensitive to <b>device</b> <b>spacing</b> and height.

50|$|In general, the {{analysis}} of the capacitance transients in the DLTS measurements assumes that the concentration of investigated traps is much smaller than the material doping concentration. In cases when this assumption is not fulfilled then the constant capacitance DLTS (CCDLTS) method is used for more accurate determination of the trap concentration. When the defects recharge and their concentration is high then the width of the <b>device</b> <b>space</b> region varies making {{the analysis}} of the capacitance transient inaccurate. The additional electronic circuitry maintaining the total device capacitance constant by varying the device bias voltage helps to keep the depletion region width constant. As a result, the varying device voltage reflects the defect recharge process. An analysis of the CCDLTS system using feedback theory was provided by Lau and Lam in 1982.|$|E
50|$|DLTS investigates defects {{present in}} a space charge (depletion) region of a simple {{electronic}} device. The most commonly used are Schottky diodes or p-n junctions. In the measurement process the steady-state diode reverse polarization voltage is disturbed by a voltage pulse. This voltage pulse reduces the electric field in the space charge region and allows free carriers from the semiconductor bulk to penetrate this region and recharge the defects causing their non-equilibrium charge state. After the pulse, when the voltage returns to its steady-state value, the defects start to emit trapped carriers due to the thermal emission process. The technique observes the <b>device</b> <b>space</b> charge region capacitance where the defect charge state recovery causes the capacitance transient. The voltage pulse followed by the defect charge state recovery are cycled allowing an application of different signal processing methods for defect recharging process analysis.|$|E

50|$|IEC 62304 {{has become}} the {{benchmark}} standard {{for the development of}} medical device software, whether standalone software or otherwise, in both the E.U. and the U.S. Leading industry innovation in software technologies has led key industry leaders and government regulators to recognize the emergence of numerous standalone medical software products that operate as medical devices.

Additionally, quality management system requirements for manufacturing a software medical device, {{as is the case with}} any medical device, are described in the U.S. Quality Systems Regulation of the FDA and also in ISO 13485:2003.

40|$|Color gamut {{characterization}} is {{an essential}} step in the ICC profile generation for imaging devices. It is also needed as part of evaluation and comparison of image quality achievable by different imaging systems. A novel technique is presented for characterizing the color gamut of an imaging device via ray tracing in the CIELAB color space. Initially, the convex hull of the set of measurement points is computed in the <b>device</b> <b>space.</b> Each of the resulting simplices in the convex hull structure has a set of CIELAB data triples associated with its vertices. The &quot;local &quot; convex hull is computed for each of those sets separately in CIELAB. The convex hull triangles are then subjected to a ray tracing procedure aimed at approximating the maximum achievable chroma {{for a set of}} pairs of L and hue angle values. For the purpose of the device profile generation, this set is derived from the set of grid points in the PCS (profile connection space) that have to be mapped to the <b>device</b> <b>space.</b> It is shown that the new method characterizes the gamut surface and volume better than the conventional technique based on computing the &quot;global &quot; convex hull of the measurement data points in CIELAB. 1...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} three {{packages of}} programs {{of interest to}} the graphic designers: (l) a tool for pointing at objects on the display monitor, (2) a tool for organizing sets of programs into interactive menus, and (3) a tool for digitizing type fonts. The graphic designer at the computer uses at least three spaces at once: the page he is designing, the <b>device</b> <b>space</b> of the display monitor, and the <b>device</b> <b>space</b> of the graphics tablet. The first tool figures the transforms necessary to map one space into another. This allows the user to point at a location on the tablet and thereby identify corresponding points on the screen and in user-defined space. Interactive page layout requires the orchestration of large numbers of separate procedures. Choosing between these procedures can be made easier for the user if he is presented with a menu of options when a decision is required. The second tool is a package of programs to help the programmer create and manage simple or complex menus. Simulating type on a monitor requires digitized fonts. The third tool is a package of programs which extracts the edge of a letter-form image in the frame buffer and stores it as a chain code. by Nardy Henigan. Thesis (M. S. V. S.)
