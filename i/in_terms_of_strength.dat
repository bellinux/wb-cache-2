25|$|Iron became {{increasingly}} common from the 13th century B.C. Before {{that the use}} of swords was less frequent. The iron was not quench-hardened although often containing sufficient carbon, but work-hardened like bronze by hammering. This made them comparable or only slightly better <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>strength</b> and hardness to bronze swords. They could still bend during use rather than spring back into shape. But the easier production, and the better availability of the raw material for the first time permitted the equipment of entire armies with metal weapons, though Bronze Age Egyptian armies were sometimes fully equipped with bronze weapons.|$|E
500|$|Due {{to their}} large mass (approximately 90GeV/c2) these carrier particles, termed the W and Z bosons, are {{short-lived}} with {{a lifetime of}} under 10−24seconds. The weak interaction has a coupling constant (an indicator of interaction strength) of between 10−7 and 10−6, compared to the strong interaction's coupling constant of 1 and the electromagnetic coupling constant of about 10−2; consequently the weak interaction is weak <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>strength.</b> The weak interaction has a very short range (around 10−17 to 10−16m). At distances around 10−18 meters, the weak interaction has a strength of a similar magnitude to the electromagnetic force, but this starts to decrease exponentially with increasing distance. [...] At distances of around 3×10−17 m, a distance which is scaled up by just {{one and a half}} decimal orders of magnitude from before, the weak interaction is 10,000 times weaker than the electromagnetic.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} the influence of rice husk ash (RHA) on the engineering properties of fired-clay brick with the present of 10 % sand. Temperature 1200 o C is selected as the optimum temperature based on the preliminaries study. X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF), were carried out to determine the characteristic of raw materials used. Mechanical properties of rice husk ash-clay bricks are determined <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> compressive <b>strength,</b> porosity and water absorption. The results shows that increase in RHA replacement percentage reduce the compressive strength and linear shrinkage of fired-clay bricks while the porosity and water absorption value increase.

The data were collected prospectively by a full-time trained data collector. <b>In</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> limitations, we did not have data regarding the patient condition and severity of illness from the previous hospital. Severity of illness as assessed by APACHE is ideally done for patients within 24  hours of admission to ICU and not on presentation to the referring hospital. However, severity of illness does not accurately reflect the risk of adverse outcomes in transferred patients because of correction of certain physiologic and laboratory abnormalities that artificially improve the physiologic scores before transfer[22]. We do not have data regarding the duration of stay in the other hospitals before the transfer. Also, the selection of patients for transfer as deemed by the clinical condition of the patient might have caused potential selection bias by transferring relatively stable patients while those who were critically ill and not stable enough for transfer and could have been benefitted from advanced health care facilities were not transferred.|$|R
40|$|In {{previous}} {{experiments with}} Dutch, French and Swedish listeners, {{it was shown}} that the location in the syllable of the onset of a rising or falling pitch movement is critical for the perception of accentuation. As {{the onset of the}} pitch movement is shifted through the syllable, there is a point at which the percept of accentuation shifts from one syllable to the next. This point is termed the accentuation boundary. It has also been proposed that in certain positions, the percept of accentuation conflicts with thc percept of phrasing. An experiment with Swedish listeners was carried out using the SaDle stimuli as used for the accentuation study, but now the task was to determine the phrasing of the syllables. The results indicate that perceptual phrase boundaries can be determined in the SaDle way as accentuation boundaries. Differences in the locations of the boundaries can be interpreted <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>strengths</b> <b>of</b> tonal cues for accentuation and phrasing...|$|R
