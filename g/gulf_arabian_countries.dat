40|$|Desalination {{has become}} a major source of fresh water almost everywhere. The best choice for {{providing}} fresh water in the Middle East and North Africa, especially in the <b>Arabian</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>countries,</b> was through seawater desalination with ground water as back up. Desalination in the <b>Arabian</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>countries</b> {{is an example of the}} fast growth of the desalination industry. It is expected to show a steady growth in the coming years. Existing plants will experience expansions in their capacities. New plants will be constructed. The long experience of the <b>Arabian</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>countries</b> in the desalination field together with massive desalting capacities represent a continued challenge in capacity building. More efforts in training for desalination technology are needed, together with human resources management, planning, academic education and research. A capacity-building program is necessary not only to improve the operation and maintenance of existing desalination plants but also to build an integrated adoption of this sustainable technology in the region. This paper will focus on discussing the need and necessity of research in desalination by reviewing possible improvement of the current desalination processes regarding lower water production cost, better utilization of energy, environmental aspects, etc. A training program for desalination technology to enhance human resources and expertise via academic education and research is outlined...|$|R
40|$|<b>Arabian</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>countries</b> {{are located}} in an arid area with limited water resources. Hydrological {{investigations}} point to large resources of underground water, but they are saline {{and need to be}} desalted. The best choice for providing fresh water in the <b>Arabian</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>countries</b> is through seawater desalination with ground water as a back up. About 65 % of desalination plants that are in operation worldwide {{are located in}} the <b>Arabian</b> <b>Gulf</b> counlries, most of which are the dual-purpose multistage flash (MSF) plants, producing power and water. Reverse osmosis (RO) is used mainly for brackish water treatment and a limited number of multiple effect distillation (MED) plants are used in the <b>Arabian</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>countries.</b> The use of nuclear desalination is practically essential in these countries where massive quantities of water are desalinated and there is a fast increase in power demand. There is no technical impediment to the use of nuclear reactors for supply of either heat or electricity or both to a desalination plant. However, the cost effectiveness of nuclear desalination is a site dependent matter. The type of desalination process and the size and type of the nuclear reactor have to be determined based on the specific site data. MSF plants are considered as energy intensive processes where energy cost is a major controlling parameter in the overall cost of desalination. Oil price fluctuations affect the cost of desalted water significantly, whereas nuclear power offers long term availability of indigenous fuel as well as long term fuel price stability. It has minimal environmental impact compared with other conventional desalination processes. This paper will discuss the potential of application of nuclear desalination in the <b>Arabian</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>countries.</b> Various processes will be reviewed and most appropriate method selected.

40|$|Introduction: Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) is an {{autoimmune disease}} that attacks {{the central nervous}} system, causing the appearance of focal areas of inflammation and demyelination. A detailed study of MS would offer {{a better understanding of}} the causes of increased number of MS cases in the Arab Gulf countries. Materials and Methods: A comprehensive literature search was performed to extract data regarding MS in general and MS in <b>Arabian</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>countries</b> in specific. Only peer-reviewed, full-text articles published in English were included. Results: Data have shown a noticeable increase in cases of MS in the Arab Gulf countries. Although the underlying causes still remain elusive, many factors have been proposed to influence MS. This review will discuss the factors influencing MS, correlate their effects with disease pathology, their interaction in the context of disease development, and try to explain the increased number of MS in <b>Arabian</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>countries.</b> Conclusion: Understanding MS development could open new doors for the treatment of MS, as well as initiate novel target therapies for citizens of Arab Gulf countries...|$|R

40|$|SummaryObjectiveThe aims of {{this study}} were to perform a {{systematic}} review and synthesize epidemiological data on hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the <b>Arabian</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>countries,</b> and to assess the country-specific prevalence among nationals and expatriate populations. MethodsA systematic review of HCV antibody prevalence and incidence in the <b>Arabian</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>countries</b> was conducted, based on the items outlined in the PRISMA statement. Meta-analyses were performed incorporating inverse variance weighting and using a random-effects model to pool summary estimates of HCV prevalence among general population groups, for nationals and the entire resident population. ResultsA total of 557 prevalence measures and one incidence measure were identified for the <b>Arabian</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>countries.</b> HCV prevalence among nationals was 0. 24 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 02 – 0. 63) in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), 0. 44 % (95 % CI 0. 29 – 0. 62) in Kuwait, 0. 51 % (95 % CI 0. 43 – 0. 59) in Qatar, and 1. 65 % (95 % CI 1. 40 – 1. 91) in Saudi Arabia. No data were available for Bahrain or Oman. Among the entire resident populations, HCV prevalence was 0. 30 % (95 % CI 0. 23 – 0. 38) in Bahrain, 0. 41 % (95 % CI 0. 35 – 0. 46) in Oman, 1. 06 % (95 % CI 0. 51 – 1. 81) in Qatar, 1. 45 % (95 % CI 0. 75 – 2. 34) in Kuwait, 1. 63 % (95 % CI 1. 42 – 1. 84) in Saudi Arabia, and 1. 64 % (95 % CI 0. 96 – 2. 49) in UAE. A higher prevalence was observed among expatriate populations such as Egyptians. Among the high-risk populations, HCV prevalence was as high as 78. 6 % in the multi-transfused and 74. 6 % in people who inject drugs. ConclusionsNational-level HCV prevalence in the <b>Arabian</b> <b>Gulf</b> region is comparable to global levels. A higher prevalence is found in specific expatriate populations, reflecting the prevalence in their countries of origin.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about Emergency Medical Services (EMS) use and pre-hospital triage of {{patients}} with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in <b>Arabian</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>countries.</b> Clinical arrival and acute care within 24 h of STEMI symptom onset were compared between patients transferred by EMS (Red Crescent and Inter-Hospital) and those transferred by non-EMS means. Data were retrieved from a prospective registry of 36 hospitals in 6 <b>Arabian</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>countries,</b> from January 2014 to January 2015. We enrolled 2, 928 patients; mean age, 52. 7 (SD ± 11. 8) years; 90 % men; and 61. 7 % non-Arabian Gulf citizens. Only 753 patients (25. 7 %) used EMS; which was mostly via Inter-Hospital EMS (22 %) rather than direct transfer from the scene to the hospital by the Red Crescent (3. 7 %). Compared to the non-EMS group, the EMS group {{was more likely to}} arrive initially at a primary or secondary health care facility; thus, they had longer median symptom-onset-to-emergency department arrival times (218 vs. 158 min; p˂. 001); {{they were more likely to}} receive primary percutaneous coronary interventions (62 % vs. 40. 5 %, p = 0. 02); they had shorter door-to-needle times (38 vs. 42 min; p =. 04); and shorter door-to-balloon times (47 vs. 83 min; p˂. 001). High EMS use was independently predicted mostly by primary/secondary school educational levels and low or moderate socioeconomic status. Low EMS use was predicted by a history of angina and history of percutaneous coronary intervention. The groups had similar in-hospital deaths and outcomes. Most acute STEMI patients in the <b>Arabian</b> <b>Gulf</b> region did not use EMS services.

The researcher draws upon the neo-realist theory arguments and assumptions in explaining China's foreign policy towards the <b>Gulf</b> and <b>Arabian</b> Peninsula region, particularly the impact of external factors in shaping states' foreign policies. The major argument of the study is that two main factors have been most salient in shaping China's foreign policy towards the region. The first factor has been China’s relations with both the United States and the Soviet Union, which very much shaped China's foreign policy towards the region throughout most of the Cold War era. The second factor is China's drive to increase its economic capability by fostering strong economic ties with the countries of the region, particularly after becoming a net importer of oil in 1993. The researcher finds that these two factors have directed China’s foreign policy towards the <b>Gulf</b> and <b>Arabian</b> Peninsula region throughout the first half-century of the PRC's interactions with the countries of the <b>Gulf</b> and <b>Arabian</b> Peninsula region...|$|R

30|$|The {{metabolic}} syndrome {{is common in}} <b>Arabian</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>countries</b> especially Saudi Arabia. It comprises a number of disorders—including insulin resistance, hypertension and central abdominal obesity—that all act as risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Accumulating evidence now exists to link urological diseases to the {{metabolic syndrome}} (Hammarsten et al. 1998). Most established aspects of the metabolic syndrome are primarily linked to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer (Hammarsten et al. 1998; Hammarsten & Högstedt 1999; Hammarsten & Högstedt 2001; Hammarsten & Högstedt 2002; Hammarsten et al. 2009). Fasting plasma insulin, in particular, was linked to BPH and all subtypes of prostate cancer namely: incidental, aggressive and lethal prostate cancer (Hammarsten & Högstedt 2002). Medical treatment {{is thought to be}} less efficacious in obese patients with symptomatic BPH than normal weight patients (Lee et al. 2011). Overall, the results of studies on urological aspects of the metabolic syndrome seem to indicate that BPH and prostate cancer are recently considered as two aspects of the metabolic syndrome, and that an increased insulin level is a common underlying aberration that promotes both BPH and clinical prostate cancer (Nandeesha et al. 2006).|$|R

Although XLPE has excellent dielectric characteristics, extensive premature failures {{have been reported}} by the local power utilities. The main causes of such premature failures are related to manufacturing defects and insulation degradation mainly caused by water treeing phenomena. In this research work, five types of 15 -kV, XLPE-insulated cables were subjected to accelerated aging under simultaneous electrical, thermal, and environmental stresses for periods of 60, 120, and 180 days. After each aging period, partial-discharge (PD), mechanical properties, ac dielectric strength {{and the extent of}} degradation due to water treeing of these cables were measured. The results show that PD and mechanical properties show just little variations whereas the ac-retained dielectric strength decreases rapidly in the first 60 days after which the rate of its decrease retards.

A systematic review of English and Arabic language literature was conducted by searching electronic databases (1975 - 2007) and conducting hand searches of Arab published journals. Only studies investigating alcohol and/or substance use or abuse issues with participants (1) of Arab nationality, (2) living in an <b>Arabian</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>country,</b> and (3) of Muslim faith were included. Within this literature, the majority of research has been conducted with clinical male participants. The most commonly abused drugs are alcohol, heroin, and hashish. Literature investigating the substance use domain with people who are not seeking treatment for addiction is extremely limited. Although the research is largely in its infancy, it does however confirm alcohol and substance abuse in Muslim, Gulf Arab nationals. We strongly urge that further research into substance use and abuse in this region is conducted. Community investigations assessing the prevalence, magnitude, and associated problems with alcohol and substance abuse and also research into valid and reliable measurements in these countries are warranted...|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims to {{understand}} the transformation process of the Friday mosque in the <b>Arabian</b> <b>Gulf,</b> {{in terms of its}} formal and spatial languages, within the period of 1975 to 2010. Essentially, the Arabian hypostyle mosque was the dominating architectural typology in the northern Gulf region until modern times. This traditional architectural language was transformed in many ways as a result of socio-political and economic factors subsequent to the discovery of oil in the region in the 1930 s and 1940 s. The transformation of the traditional Friday mosque was evident after the declaration of independence of the <b>Arabian</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>countries</b> in the early 1970 s, which coincided with the high revenues of oil. During this period and the decades following, the architectural discourse of the Friday mosque has express modernist influence and regional Islamic influences. This thesis provides insight into the contributing factors of these transformations and their role in shaping the contemporary Friday mosque character in the urban fabric of the <b>Arabian</b> <b>Gulf</b> cities. It investigates the vernacular and historical mosques in the region to establish the pre-existing context against which the analytical investigations of this study can be understood. The research focuses on comparative studies of the mosques of Abdel-Wahed El-Wakil, Rasem Badran, and Mohamed Makiya in the cities of Manama, Riyadh, Kuwait, and Muscat. These architects were selected owing to the significance and influence of their distinctive architectural languages based—in each case—on strongly articulated theoretical and socio-political positions. A spectrum of research approaches supports these comparative analyses, including: interviews with El-Wakil, Badran, and other significant actors; interpretative historical research; archival research; studies of the pre-oil settlements of the urban fabric of the Arabian Gulf; site visits to the representative traditional, contemporary mosque sites; and case studies sites included in the study...|$|R

40|$|Tarut Bay {{contains}} {{some of the}} most important mangrove forests in the <b>Arabian</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>countries,</b> which are facing significant anthropogenic pressures. A multidisciplinary approach based on remote sensing, fieldwork, and chemical analysis was adopted in order to identify the pressures facing the mangrove communities in Tarut Bay and subsequently evaluate its current environmental condition. The analysis focused on the 2011 to 2014 timeframe in particular. The results indicate that the mangrove communities in Tarut Bay cover currently around 11. 32 square km. Two major mangrove cover changes were identified in the area during the studied period, with a net loss of around 0. 675 square km happening in the interim. The analysis adopted the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to evaluate the temporal change in vegetation concentration. Moreover, the study evaluated the overall pollution condition of 19 mangrove communities in Tarut Bay to be medium based on the Pollution Load Index (PLI). Nevertheless, some of the mangrove communities in Tarut Bay are very healthy while others are very polluted and require immediate action to improve their pollution status. The findings of this work led to recommending mangrove improvement measures to address further deterioration and disappearance of mangrove communities, including the re-opening of natural inlets and avoiding residential developments on the mangrove coast...|$|R
