40|$|The {{characteristics}} and learning styles, {{as well as}} the implications for faculty development of 'Net Generation' students, has recently been closely examined across 14 Australasian Universities. Net <b>Geners</b> can be described as digitally literate, connected; social; prefer working in groups; achievement oriented; require structure and guidelines; crave interactivity; have short attention spans; are experiential, visual, kinaesthetic learners; and prefer working on things that matter. This paper considers the Australasian perspective including the findings of recent student and staff surveys undertaken across one university. It further examines an online roleplay simulation, the Mekong e-Sim. The students undertaking the Mekong e-Sim can be categorised as 'Net Generation' learners. This paper identifies how the online roleplay simulation effectively addresses the learning styles of Net <b>Geners</b> through engagement and successful development of higher order learning. Finally it reflects on the findings within the conference theme of maintaining the momentum of balance, fidelity and mobility. Judi Baron and Holger Maier[URL]...|$|R

At {{the time of his}} proclamation as King of Poland, November, 1649, Poland was threatened by an incursion of Cossacks. The immediate cause was, or was supposed to be, the ill treatment which [Bogdán Khmelnítzky] a Lithuanian had received {{at the hands of the}} Polish governor, Czaplinski. The governor, it was alleged, had carried off, ravished, and put to death Khmelnítzky's wife, and, not content with this outrage, had set fire to the house of the Cossack, [...] "in which perished his infant son in his cradle." [...] Others affirmed that the Cossack had begun the strife by causing the governor [...] "to be publicly and ignominiously whipped," [...] and that it was the Cossack's mill and not his house which he burnt. Be that as it may, Casimir, on being exhorted to take the field, declined, on the ground that the Poles [...] "ought not to have set fire to Khmelnítzky's house." [...] It is probably to this unpatriotic determination to look at both sides of the question that he earned the character of being an unwarlike prince.

For the 18 -years-old to 20 -something group of current undergraduate and graduate students in this cohort, general guidelines for teaching strategies have been proffered by a few educational researchers.

40|$|Leaders in {{the nonprofit}} arts world, {{many of them}} founders and {{builders}} of their organizations for decades, will be retiring in unprecedented numbers in the coming years. Organizations could become weaker and destabilized during this transition, a prospect that should be addressed with some urgency. Younger professionals {{should be able to}} take on these leadership roles and chart a new course in stressful and changing times. Yet an operational divide between the workplace needs and values of Next <b>Geners</b> and those currently in charge threatens this transition. It does not help that the nonprofit arts field suffers from a paucity of training and professional degree-granting programs, low pay, long work hours, and inadequate career advancement opportunities. The generation that sparked a powerful nonprofit arts movement more than thirty years ago now wonders about their successors: Are they motivated? Prepared? How can we recruit, train, nurture, and retain them? This study was commissioned by the Center for Cultural Innovation (CCI) as part of a large-scale Next Generation Arts Leadership Initiative funded by The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation and The James Irvine Foundation that aspires to strengthen and retain a new generation of administrative talent in California's nonprofit arts field. It addresses nonprofit arts leaders' desire to know more about their younger colleagues and their experiences as professionals, board members, and volunteers. To explore the experience of Next <b>Geners,</b> the author developed a survey conducted in the summer of 2010. In this report, Next Gen arts leaders are defined as individuals between the ages of 18 and 35 years who are currently working with a California nonprofit arts organization as administrators, artists or board members and who have worked in the field for less than ten consecutive years. More than 1, 300 California Next <b>Geners</b> took the survey and with modest exceptions (under-representation of Latinos, African and Asian-Americans, and men, non-metropolitan regions, and certain art forms), their workplaces are generally representative of the size of and variation within the nonprofit arts sector in the state.

6000|$|... 8. The Kings of the Hunns were, A.C. 406 Octar and Rugila, 433 Bleda and Attila. Octar and Rugila {{were the}} {{brothers}} of Munzuc King of the Hunns in Gothia beyond the Danube; and Bleda and Attila were his sons, and Munzuc {{was the son}} of Balamir. The two first, as Jornandes tells us, were Kings of the Hunns, but not of them all; and had the two last for their successors. I date the reign of the Hunns in Pannonia from the time that the Vandals and Alans relinquished Pannonia to them, A.C. 407. Sigonius from the time that the Visigoths relinquished Pannonia A. C. 408. Constat, saith he, quod Gothis ex Illyrico profectis, Hunni successerunt, atque imprimis Pannoniam tenuerunt. Neque enim Honorius viribus ad resistendum in tantis difficultatibus destitutus, prorsus eos prohibere potuit, sed meliore consilio, animo ad pacem converso, foedus cum eis, datis acceptisque obsidibus fecit; ex quibus qui dati sunt, Ætius, qui etiam Alarico tributus fuerat, præcipue memoratur. How Ætius was hostage to the Goths and Hunns is related by Frigeridus, who when he had mentioned that Theodosius Emperor of the East had sent grievous commands to John, who after the death of Honorius had usurped the crown of the Western Empire, he subjoins: Iis permotus Johannes, Ætium id tempus curam palatii gerentem cum ingenti auri pondere ad Chunnos transmisit, notos sibi obsidiatûs sui tempore & familiari amicitiâ devinctos--And a little after: Ætius tribus annis Alarici obses, dehinc Chunnorum, postea Carpilionis <b>gener</b> ex Comite domesticorum & Joannis curopalatæ. Now Bucher shews that Ætius was hostage to Alaric till the year 410, when Alaric died, and to the Hunns between the years 411 and 415, and son-in-law to Carpilio about the year 417 or 418, and Curopalates to John {{about the end of the}} year 423. Whence 'tis probable that he became hostage to the Hunns about the year 412 or 413, when Honorius made leagues with almost all the barbarous nations, and granted them seats: but I had rather say with Sigonius, that Ætius became hostage to Alaric A.C. 403. It is further manifest out of Prosper, that the Hunns were in quiet possession of Pannonia in the year 432. For in the first book of Eusebius's Chronicle Prosper writes: Anno decimo post obitum Honorii, cum ad Chunnorum gentem cui tunc Rugila præerat, post prælium cum Bonifacio se Ætius contulisset, impetrato auxilio ad Romanorum solum regreditur. And in the second book: Ætio & Valerio Coss. Ætius depositâ potestate profugus ad Hunnos in Pannonia pervenit, quorum amicitiâ auxilioque usus, pacem principum interpellatæ potestatis obtinuit. Hereby it appears that at this time Rugila, or as Maximus calls him, Rechilla, reigned over the Hunns in Pannonia; and that Pannonia was not now so much as accounted within the soil of the Empire, being formerly granted away to the Hunns; and that these were the very same body of Hunns with which Ætius had, in the time of his being an hostage, contracted friendship: by virtue of which, as he sollicited them before to the aid of John the Tyrant A.C. 424, so now he procured their intercession for himself with the Emperor. Octar died A.C. 430; for Socrates tells us, that about that time the Burgundians having been newly vext by the Hunns, upon intelligence of Octar's death, seeing them without a leader, set upon them suddenly with so much vigour, that 3000 Burgundians slew 10000 Hunns. Of Rugila's being now King in Pannonia you have heard already. He died A.C. 433, and was succeeded by Bleda, as Prosper and Maximus inform us. This Bleda with his brother Attila were before this time Kings of the Hunns beyond the Danube, their father Munzuc's kingdom being divided between them; and now they united the kingdom Pannonia to their own. Whence Paulus Diaconus saith, they did regnum intra Pannoniam Daciamque gerere. In the year 441, they began to invade the Empire afresh, adding to the Pannonian forces new and great armies from Scythia. But this war was presently composed, and then Attila, seeing Bleda inclined to peace, slew him, A.C. 444, inherited his dominions, and invaded the Empire again. At length, after various great wars with the Romans, Attila perished A.C. 454; and his sons quarrelling about his dominions, gave occasion to the Gepides, Ostrogoths and other nations who were their subjects, to rebel and make war upon them. The same year the Ostrogoths had seats granted them in Pannonia by the Emperors Marcian and Valentinian; and with the Romans ejected the Hunns out of Pannonia, soon after the death of Attila, as all historians agree. This ejection was in the reign of Avitus, as is mentioned in the Chronicum Boiorum, and in Sidonius, Carm. 7 in Avitum, which speaks thus of that Emperor.|$|E

40|$|AbstractPresent day realities {{which are}} {{becoming}} increasingly complex, multimodal and virtual require Net <b>Geners</b> to employ a combination of linguistic, visual, audio, spatial, and gestural communicative modes. The scholarly push towards research {{on the use of}} multimodality in higher learning institutions has revealed that multimodal tools set affective challenges, varying degrees of motivation and anxiety on the undergraduates. In addressing these challenges, this study investigates the deployment of multimodal tools among 50 mechanical engineering undergraduates in a technical university. The multimodal parameters that encompass this study include media (screen), mode (speech and writing) and semiotic resources (fonts). The instruments that were used for data collection in the study are survey questionnaire and focused-group interviews. Findings reveal that blogs, social networking sites, discussion boards, Google docs, Learning Management System and chat tools are the favorites among the majority of the respondents as opposed to Wikis, Podcast, and Skype. In addition, multimodal activities like creating animation, editing audio and video as well as Desktop Publishing Programs are not popular among the undergraduates. Interview results confirm that these activities are lowly utilized due to a combination of factors like the lack of facilities, time, skill and a classroom ecology that does not create a necessity for the utilization of those tools. Unquestionably, the results indicate that it is the onus of the educators to provide the Net <b>Geners</b> with the opportunities to utilize this new democratic learning space to its full potential. This kind of learning space indeed empowers them to be autonomous learners who play an active role in shaping their own learning rather than being passive recipients of knowledge...|$|R

40|$|External pical root {{resorption}} (EARR) is {{a frequent}} iatrogenic problem following orthodontic treatment in endodontically-treated teeth, about which the literature reports substantial variability in post-orthodontic treatment EARR responses. The main focus {{of the present study}} is to clarify whether variants in the interleukin- 1 receptor antagonist gene coding for the IL- 1 ra protein have a positive/negative influence on EARR of endodontically-treated teeth. Ninety-three orthodontic patients were genetically screened for a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP: rs 419598) in the IL 1 cluster. The sample was classified into 2 groups: group 1 (affected-group) showed radiographic EARR of more than 2 mm; group 2 (control-group), had no EARR or EARR <= to 2 mm following orthodontic treatment on root-filled teeth. Logistic regression analysis was performed to obtain an adjusted estimate between the SNPs studied and EARR. Genotype distributions, allelic frequencies, adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals were also calculated. We found that subjects homozygous [1 / 1 (TT) ] for the IL 1 RN gene [OR: 10. 85; p= 0. 001; CI: 95 %] were at risk of EARR in root-filled teeth. Genetic variants in the antagonist axis balance of the IL 1 RN(rs 419598) have a direct repercussion on the predisposition to post-orthodontic EARR in root-filled teeth. Variants in allele 1 of the interleukin- 1 receptor antagonist <b>gene(rs</b> 419598) are associated(p= 0. 001 **) with an increased risk of suffering post-orthodontic EARR in root-filled teeth...|$|R

40|$|We study {{deflection}} {{of light}} rays and gravitational lensing {{in the regular}} Bardeen no-horizon spacetimes. Flatness of these spacetimes in the central region implies existence of interesting optical effects related to photons crossing the gravitational field of the no-horizon spacetimes with low impact parameters. These effects occur due to existence of a critical impact parameter giving maximal deflection of light rays in the Bardeen no-horizon spacetimes. We give the critical impact parameter in dependence on the specific charge of the spacetimes, and discuss "ghost" direct images of Keplerian discs, generated by photons with low impact parameters. The ghost images can occur only for large inclination angles of distant observers. We determine {{the range of the}} frequency shift of photons <b>genering</b> the ghost images and determine distribution of the frequency shift accross these images. We compare them to those of the standard direct images of the Keplerian discs. The difference of the ranges of the frequency shift on the ghost and direct images could serve as a quantitative measure of the Bardeen no-horizon spacetimes. The regions of the Keplerian discs giving the ghost images are determined in dependence on the specific charge of the no-horizon spacetimes. We can conclude that the optical effects related to the low impact parameter photons give clear signatures of the regular Bardeen no-horizon spacetimes, as no similar phenomena could occur in the black hole or naked singularity spacetimes. Similar phenomena have to occur in any regular no-horizon spacetimes having nearly flat central region...|$|R
40|$|Eleven graptolite {{zones are}} {{recognized}} in New Zealand and {{are considered to}} represent most of the Ordovician Period. The most complete fossiliferous section, at Aorangi Mine in Northwest Nelson, is described in detail. New fossiliferous Ordovician sections at Wangapeka Valley and Hailes Knob, in Northwest Nelson, are described and the previously Known sections at Cobb Valley (Northwest Nelson) and the Cape Providence - Preservation Inlet region (Southwest Otago) are discussed The New Zealand zones are correlated with those of Victoria, Australia, and the Victorian stage nomenclature is adopted for New Zealand. In upward sequence the stages and zones are: Lancefieldian (zones 1, Adelograptus, and 2, T. approximatus), Bendigonian (zone 3, T. fruticosus), Chewtonian (zone 4, D. protobifidus), Castlemainian (zones 5, I. c. lunata, and 6, I. c. maximodivergens), Yapeenian (zone 7,Oncograptus), Darriwilian (zones 8, P. etheridgei, and 9, D. decoratus), Gisbornian (zone 10, N. gracilis), Eastonian (zone 11, Orthograptus - lower part) and Bolindian (zone 11, Orthograptus - upper part?). Fossils of lowermost Lancefieldian and uppermost Bolindian age are not yet known in New Zealand. Diagnostic Silurian fossils are also unknown and the next youngest New Zealand fossils are Lower Devonian (Gedinnian?). Previous Work in the Aorangi Mine area is outlined, the geology illustrated by a map, and the stratigraphic column shown to include both older, and younger beds than were previously known. About 8500 ft thick, the column comprises, in upward sequence, Webb Formation, Aorangi Mine Formation (with four informal members), Formation A (new and informal, with three members), and Formation B (new and informal). Graptolites are confined to the three younger formations and represent zones 1 to 10, {{ranging in age from}} Lancefieldian to Gisbornian. The structure is outlined and illustrated by cross-sections. In Wangapeka Valley, argillites of the Wangapeka Formation contain zone 11 graptolites of Eastonian and lower Bolindian age, and are overlain by 1500 ft of quartzite of the Ellis Formation, which has yielded no diagnostic fossils but which is inferred to represent {{at least part of the}} Silurian Period. Lower Devonian brachiopods, bivalves, corals and trilobites are known from the uppermost beds of the Ellis Formation, about 1550 ft above its base. At Hailes knob, Mount Arthur Marble with fossils of uppermost Ordovician age is overlain by Hailes Knob Quartzite of probable Silurian age. From the Aorangi Mine and Wangapeka areas, one hundred and thirteen graptolite species and subspecies, representing 35 <b>geners,</b> are described. They include one named new species and 49 new records for New Zealand. Stratigraphic and geographic distribution elsewhere in the world is noted. The <b>geners</b> Isograptus Moberg and Paraglossograptus Mu are reviewed, and their New Zealand members described and discussed in detail. The important zonal species and subspecies are also described in detail; the remainder are briefly discussed. One hundred and six taxa are figured.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{in order to}} develop a holistic healthcare model that would assist registered nurses who are employed at a higher education campus&rsquo; health service to render a healthcare service relevant to the healthcare needs of the campus healthcare consumers. A theory-generative, qualitative, explorative,descriptive and contextual research design for theory generation was used to develop a holistic healthcare model for a higher education campus&rsquo; health service. It became evident throughout the study that the participants experienced a need for a more comprehensive healthcare service on campus. The main concepts of holistic healthcare were identified from the information obtained from the in-depth, focus group interviews that were conducted with the participants. The process of theoretical model generation was conducted according to the steps of theory generation as proposed by Walker and Avant (1995 : 39), namely that of concept analysis,the placing of concepts in relationships, a description of the model and guidelines to operationalise the model. This model provides a structured holistic healthcare frame of reference for registered nurses employed in a campus health service at a Higher Education Institution (HEI) and could be used to assist all campus healthcare consumers to become balanced whole persons who are able to realise their dreams and maintain consistency with regard to optimal health and capacity.

Tydens die studie het dit duidelik geword dat die deelnemers &lsquo;n behoefte het daaraan om &lsquo;n meer omvattende gesondheidsorgdiens op kampus te ervaar. Die hoof konsepte van holistiese gesondheidsorg was ge&iuml;dentifiseer vanuit die data wat verkry was deur die in-diepte fokusgroep onderhoude wat met die deelnemers gevoer is. Die proses van model-generering is uitgevoer volgens die stappe soos voorgestel deur Walker en Avant(1995 : 30) naamlik dit van konsep-analise, die plasing van konsepte in verhoudings, die beskrywing van die model en die riglyne om die model operatief te maak. Die model maak voorsiening vir &lsquo;n gestruktureerde holistiese gesondheidsorgraamwerk wat as verwysing kan dien vir geregistreerde verpleegkundiges werksaam by &lsquo;n kampus gesondheidsorgdiens by &lsquo;n Ho&euml;r Onderwys Instansie(HOI) en kan gebruik word om alle kampus gesondheidsorgverbruikers te help om gebalanseerde, heel persone te word wat in staat is om hul drome te vervul en konsekwentheid met betrekking tot optimale gesondheid en kapasiteit te handhaaf.
