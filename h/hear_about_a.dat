An away team beams over and finds three Klingons: Korris (Vaughn Armstrong); Konmel (Charles Hyman); and Kunivas (Robert Bauer), who is wounded. The away team returns {{with them to the}} Enterprise before the freighter explodes. Kunivas is taken to sickbay and Korris meets with Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart). The Klingon explains that they were passengers when the freighter was attacked by a Ferengi ship; the Klingons took over the freighter to fend off and destroy the Ferengi ship, but the damage sustained left the freighter adrift and faltering. As Korris and Konmel are shown to quarters, they are surprised to <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> fellow Klingon, Lt. Worf (Michael Dorn), who is serving within Starfleet.|$|E

6000|$|Phineas {{went down}} to Loughlinter early in July, taking Loughton in his way. He stayed there one night at the inn, and was {{introduced}} to sundry influential inhabitants of the borough by Mr. Grating, the ironmonger, who was known by those who knew Loughton {{to be a very}} strong supporter of the Earl's interest. Mr. Grating and about half a dozen others of the tradesmen of the town came to the inn, and met Phineas in the parlour. He told them he was a good sound Liberal and a supporter of Mr. Mildmay's Government, of which their neighbour the Earl was so conspicuous an ornament. This was almost all that was said about the Earl out loud; but each individual man of Loughton then present took an opportunity during the meeting of whispering into Mr. Finn's ear a word or two to show that he also was admitted to the secret councils of the borough,--that he too could see the inside of the arrangement. [...] "Of course we must support the Earl," [...] one said. [...] "Never mind what you <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> Tory candidate, Mr. Finn," [...] whispered a second; [...] "the Earl can do what he pleases here." [...] And it seemed to Phineas that it was thought by them all to be rather a fine thing to be thus held in the hand by an English nobleman. Phineas could not but reflect much upon this as he lay in his bed at the Loughton inn. The great political question on which the political world was engrossed up in London was the enfranchisement of Englishmen,--of Englishmen down to the rank of artisans and labourers;--and yet when he found himself in contact with individual Englishmen, with men even very much above the artisan and the labourer, he found that they rather liked being bound hand and foot, and being kept as tools in the political pocket of a rich man. Every one of those Loughton tradesmen was proud of his own personal subjection to the Earl! ...|$|E
