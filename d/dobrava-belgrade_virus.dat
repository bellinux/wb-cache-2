Here we report the com-plete genome sequence of an Amur virus isolated from Apodemus peninsulae in Northeastern China. The sequence information provided here is critical for the molecular epidemiology and evolution of Amur virus in China. Hantaviruses within the genusHantavirus of the family Bunya-viridae cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Eurasia and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in the Americas (3). The viruses are commonly maintained within spe-cific rodent hosts, and human infections occasionally occur through inhalation of aerosolized excreta from infected animals. Recently, Amur virus (AMRV) was identified {{as one of the}} caus-ative agents of HFRS in Far East Russia and East Asia (4, 6, 10), together with Hantaan, Seoul, <b>Dobrava-Belgrade,</b> and Puumala <b>viruses</b> (1, 2).

40|$|Hantaviruses are endemic {{throughout}} the world and hosted by rodents and insectivores. Two human zoonoses, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), are caused by hantaviruses and case fatality rates have reached 12 % for HFRS and 50 % for HPS in some outbreaks. Symptomatic hantavirus infections in Europe are summarised as HFRS mainly due to Puumala, <b>Dobrava-Belgrade</b> and Saaremaa <b>virus.</b> While HFRS has an overall low incidence in Europe, {{the number of cases}} varies from 100 per year in all Eastern and Southern Europe up to 1, 000 per year only in Finland. To assess the quality of hantavirus diagnostics, the European Network for the Diagnostics of "Imported" Viral Diseases (ENIVD) organised a first external quality assurance (EQA) in 2002. The purpose of this second EQA study is to collect updated information on the efficiency and accurateness of hantavirus serological methods applied by expert laboratories. A serum panel of 14 samples was sent to 28 participants in Europe of which 27 sent results. Performance in hantavirus diagnosis varied not only on the method used but also on the laboratories and the subclass of antibodies tested. Commercial and in-house assays performed almost equally. Enzyme immunoassays were mainly used but did not show the best performances while immunoblot assays were the less employed and showed overall better performances. IgM antibodies were not detected in 61 % of the positive IgM samples and IgM detection was not performed by 7 % of the laboratories indicating a risk of overlooking acute infections in patients.

40|$|Background: Hantavirus disease {{belongs to}} the {{emerging}} infections. The clinical picture and severity of infections differ between hantavirus species and may even vary between hantavirus genotypes. The mechanisms {{that lead to the}} broad variance of severity in infected patients are not completely understood. Host- and virus-specific factors are considered. Case presentation: We analyzed severe cases of hantavirus disease in two young women. The first case was caused by Puumala virus (PUUV) infection in Germany; the second case describes the infection with <b>Dobrava-Belgrade</b> <b>virus</b> (DOBV) in Russia. Symptoms, laboratory parameters and cytokine levels were analyzed and compared between the two patients. Serological and sequence analysis revealed that PUUV was the infecting agent for the German patient and the infection of the Russian patient was caused by <b>Dobrava-Belgrade</b> <b>virus</b> genotype Sochi (DOBV-Sochi). The symptoms in the initial phase of the diseases did not differ noticeably between both patients. However, deterioration of laboratory parameter values was prolonged and stronger in DOBV-Sochi than in PUUV infection. Circulating endothelial progenitor cells (cEPCs), known to be responsible for endothelial repair, were mobilized in both infections. Striking differences were observed in the temporal course and level of cytokine upregulation. Levels of angiopoietin- 2 (Ang- 2), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and stromal derived factor- 1 (SDF- 1 α) were increased in both infections; but, sustained and more pronounced elevation was observed in DOBV-Sochi infection.

40|$|A large {{outbreak}} of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) {{occurred in the}} winter of 2006 - 2007 in a region southeast of Moscow in Central European Russia. Of the 422 patients with HFRS investigated in this study, 58 patients were found to be infected by Puumala virus, whereas as many as 364 were infected by <b>Dobrava-Belgrade</b> <b>virus</b> (DOBV). Early serum samples from 10 DOBV-infected patients were used for nucleic acid amplification, which was successful for 5 patients. Molecular analyses demonstrated that the causative hantavirus belongs to the DOBV-Aa genetic lineage, which is carried by the striped field mouse (Apodemus agrarius) as the natural reservoir host. Neutralization assays with convalescent-phase sera from these patients confirmed infection by DOBV-Aa; related viruses, such as the Dobrava-Slovenia virus (DOBV-Af) and the Dobrava-Sochi virus (DOBV-Ap), were neutralized at lower efficiencies. The clinical courses of the 205 patients enrolled in the study were found to be mostly mild to moderate; however, an unexpectedly high fraction (27 %) of patients exhibited severe illness.

40|$|<b>Dobrava-Belgrade</b> <b>virus</b> (DOBV) is {{the most}} {{pathogenic}} hantavirus in Europe with a case-fatality rate of up to 12 %. DOBV infections {{have been reported in}} Italy following cross-sectional sero-epidemiological studies in rodents and humans since 2000, however, no clinical human cases have been confirmed thus far. In this study, we present a long-term pattern of serological changes in DOBV antibody prevalence in a population of A. flavicollis in the Province of Trento (northern Italy). From 2000 to 2012 the mean hantavirus seroprevalence was 2. 7 % (s. e. = 0. 3 %), ranging from 0 % (in 2000, 2002 and 2003) to 12. 5 % (in 2012), a statistically significant increase (t-value= 5. 93, p< 0. 001). Using Generalized Linear Models (GLM) and multi-model inference, our results showed that the rise in mean annual precipitation together with higher individual body mass are responsible of the observed change in DOBV seroprevalence. We hypothesize that greater precipitation leads to a higher probability of survival and consequently, populations with a higher proportion of older (i. e. heavier) individuals, which have a higher rate of viral shedding. Alternatively, or in addition, increased precipitation could favour virus survival in the environment.

Forty-eight pairs of acute and convalescent sera were collected from HFRS patients in Hubei, China (1985 - 2002) and tested by indirect IgG, IgA, and IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays with six rNPs of European hantaviruses as coated antigens, respectively.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Dobrava-Belgrade</b> <b>virus</b> (DOBV) is a European {{hantavirus}} causing {{hemorrhagic fever}} with renal syndrome (HFRS) in humans with fatality rates {{of up to}} 12 %. DOBV-associated clinical cases typically occur also {{in the northern part}} of Germany where the virus is carried by the striped field mouse (Apodemus agrarius). However, the causative agent responsible for human illness has not been previously isolated. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we report on characterization of a novel cell culture isolate from Germany obtained from a lung tissue of "spillover" infected yellow necked mouse (A. flavicollis) trapped near the city of Greifswald. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated close clustering of the new strain, designated Greifswald/Aa (GRW/Aa) with the nucleotide sequence obtained from a northern German HFRS patient. The virus was effectively blocked by specific antibodies directed against β 3 integrins and Decay Accelerating Factor (DAF) indicating that the virus uses same receptors as the highly pathogenic Hantaan virus (HTNV). In addition, activation of selected innate immunity markers as interferon β and λ and antiviral protein MxA after viral infection of A 549 cells was investigated and showed that the virus modulates the first-line antiviral response in a similar way as HTNV. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In summary, our study reveals novel data on DOBV receptor usage and innate immunity induction in relationship to virus pathogenicity and underlines the potency of German DOBV strains to act as human pathogen...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMembers of the <b>Dobrava-Belgrade</b> <b>virus</b> (DOBV) {{species are}} hantaviruses carried by {{different}} Apodemus mice as reservoir hosts and causing haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in humans. In Central Europe, the Kurkino genotype of DOBV, {{associated with the}} striped field mouse, Apodemus agrarius, is prevalent. This paper presents the first extensive study of the serological and molecular diagnostics, epidemiology and clinics of DOBV-Kurkino infections in Central Europe. Serum samples from 570 German patients living in the habitat of A. agrarius (north and northeast Germany) and exhibiting febrile disease, were analysed. All samples were tested by ELISA, subsets of samples were also analysed by immunoblot, neutralization assay, and RT-PCR. A group of 86 individuals was confirmed as DOBV-infected. The virus neutralization assay allowed a reliable identification of DOBV antibodies during both acute and convalescent phases of infection. However, differentiation of relevant DOBV genotypes was not possible by neutralization test but required molecular analysis. Whereas DOBV IgM antibodies tend to persist in the infected organism, RNAaemia seems to be short. Nucleotide sequences were amplified from four patients, and their analysis demonstrated infection by DOBV-Kurkino. With respect to the initial results, {{the high degree of}} identity of local patient-derived and A. agrarius-derived virus sequences may allow a closer allocation of the geographical place where the human infection occurred. In contrast to moderate/severe HFRS caused by the DOBV genotypes Dobrava or Sochi, all available data showed a mild clinical course of HFRS caused by DOBV-Kurkino infection without lethal outcomes...|$|E
40|$|We have {{discovered}} the first indigenous African hantavirus, Sangassou virus (SANGV). The virus was isolated from an African woodmouse (Hylomyscus simus), trapped in a forest habitat in Guinea, West Africa. Here, {{we report on the}} characterization of the genetic and functional properties of the virus. The complete genome of SANGVwas determined and showed typical hantavi-rus organization. The small (S), medium (M), and large (L) genome segments containing genes encoding nucleocapsid protein, two envelope glycoproteins, and viral polymerase were found to be 1, 746, 3, 650, and 6, 531 nucleotides long, respectively. The exact 5 = and 3 = termini for all three segments of the SANGV genome were determined and were predicted to form the panhandle structures typical of bunyaviruses. Phylogenetic analyses of all three segment sequences confirmed SANGV as aMurinae-associated hantavirus most closely related to the European <b>Dobrava-Belgrade</b> <b>virus.</b> We showed, however, that SANGV uses 1 integrin rather than 3 integrin and decay-accelerating factor (DAF) /CD 55 as an entry receptor.

These proper-ties are unique withinMurinae-associated hantaviruses andmake the virus useful in comparative studies focusing on hantavirus pathogenesis.
