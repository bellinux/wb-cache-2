500|$|Plans for {{a sequel}} to The Expendables were in place before the film's release in August 2010; Stallone said, [...] "I have an idea ready to go...I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{something}} that's quite radical". In an interview in August 2010 he noted {{that he did not}} have a new script yet, but [...] "It's plotted out in my mind's eye." [...] On April 18, 2011, Stallone confirmed that he would not be repeating his directing duties in The Expendables, making a list of directors to serve as his replacement. In April 2011, the film was given a scheduled release date of August 17, 2012 and a teaser poster for the film was released at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival. In June 2011, Simon West was confirmed as director.|$|E
500|$|In September 2014, {{executive}} producer Jeffrey Bell explained how the season would interact with Agent Carter saying, [...] "Agent Carter {{seems to be}} about SSR pre-S.H.I.E.L.D., but about the beginnings of something, and the basic values of that. S.H.I.E.L.D. got blown up last year and what Coulson always wanted was a return to basics, and it gives {{us an opportunity to}} return to some of those core values and even physically, some of that SSR stuff has a way of finding its way into our show that could be cool. Anyway we can tie things together, we’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it, but it is hard when the stories are 60 years apart." [...] Ultimately, the opening scene of [...] "Shadows" [...] serves as an introduction to the world of Agent Carter with the inclusion of Atwell as Carter, setting up characters and ideas for that series, including the then unconfirmed involvement of Howard Stark, who is mentioned in the scene, as well as Carter's belief in the need for [...] "a permanent unit during peacetime", which will lead to the creation of S.H.I.E.L.D.|$|E
500|$|Talking on how {{the season}} would {{interact}} with Agent Carter, Bell said, [...] "Here's what I think is interesting. Agent Carter seems to be about S.S.R. pre-S.H.I.E.L.D., but about the beginnings of something, and the basic values of that. S.H.I.E.L.D. got blown up last year and what Coulson always wanted was a return to basics, and it gives {{us an opportunity to}} return to some of those core values and even physically, some of that S.S.R. stuff has a way of finding its way into our show that could be cool. Anyway we can tie things together, we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it, but it is hard when the stories are 60 years apart." [...] Several scenes in [...] "Shadows" [...] and [...] "The Things We Bury" [...] are flashbacks featuring Peggy Carter which serve as an introduction to the world of Agent Carter, setting up characters and ideas for that series, including Carter's belief in the need for [...] "a permanent unit during peacetime", which will lead to the creation of S.H.I.E.L.D. The episode [...] "Making Friends and Influencing People" [...] names Hydra's ability to brainwash people as the Faustus Method, named for the character who appears, as Johann Fennhoff, in Agent Carter, played by Ralph Brown.|$|E

2500|$|Jay Leno led the April 16 {{show off}} by sending prayers and best wishes to {{everyone}} affected. [...] He stated that {{his job was}} to end the day on a happy note, and be a little silly, and he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that for everyone on that day.|$|E
2500|$|When he was 15 he {{was sent}} to the Wingate Institute, where young Israeli athletes are groomed to become {{profession}}als. [...] "It wasn't easy being far away from your family", Ram remembers, [...] "but you know {{it is going to be}} your profession and that's what you are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> for life. You practice twice a day and fit in school in between." [...] He became a professional tennis player in 1996, at the age of 16, but did not compete in a Grand Slam tournament until 2001 when he appeared in the Wimbledon doubles with Erlich.|$|E
2500|$|Filming did {{not begin}} immediately, but in a September 2006 interview, {{executive}} producer Mike Richardson said that 30 Days of Night would be shot on 35 mm film, though there had been discussion to shoot the film on Genesis. [...] In an interview prior to filming, Slade explained that the illustrations of the graphic novel's illustrator, Ben Templesmith, would be reflected in production design. Slade also considered Nelson's draft {{to be the most}} faithful to the graphic novel. He also stated his intention to make a [...] "scary vampire film", of which he didn't think there were many. [...] "The rest of them, they fall into all kinds of traps. We're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> our best... and one of the ways {{we have to do it}} is be more naturalistic than the graphic novel, because it's very over-the-top," [...] said Slade. [...] There was also concern expressed that while the vampires needed to communicate, talking might lessen the effect. To counter this, a fictional vampire language, with click consonants, was constructed with the help of a professor of linguistics and the nearby University of Auckland. [...] Slade explained [...] "we designed this really simple language that didn't sound like any particular accent that you would be aware of, that was based around really simple actions, eating, hunting, yes, no, really basic, because that's what vampires do." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. Di Grassi was delighted with his victory, calling it [...] "the best day in my Formula E career" [...] and reserved praise for his team after they used much of their energy to understand their lack of competitiveness at the preceding New York City races. He felt the secret was to remain calm and exercise what the driver could do to motivate the people he/she is surrounded by for the season's remaining races, [...] "Formula E can go from heaven to hell in one lap or one decision or one problem. Today we did the job. Tomorrow is a completely different day, a completely different environment. We’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the same as we did here.” Vergne spoke of his happiness over his team's growing strength and their double podium finish. He said he was hit from both sides at the race's start, causing him to lose positions, but spoke highly of his car, [...] " [...] I thought the car was just perfect {{and was able to}} push really hard. I was catching everyone in front, using less energy than them, so I think the strategy was really nice.” Third-place finisher Sarrazin stated that he was down on pace and became aware of Buemi closing on him by glancing at his rear-view mirrors. However, he was aware Buemi was challenging for the championship.|$|E
2500|$|By 1983, {{the members}} of Hüsker Dü wanted to create music outside of the {{confines}} and restrictions of hardcore. In an interview with Matter in 1983, Mould told interviewer Steve Albini, [...] "We're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something bigger than anything like rock & roll and the whole puny touring band idea. I don't know what it's going to be, {{we have to work}} that out, but it's going to go beyond the whole idea of 'punk rock' or whatever." [...] The following year, Hüsker Dü recorded the double album Zen Arcade in 45 hours for the cost of $3,200. Zen Arcade is a concept album following a boy who leaves home to face a harsh and unforgiving world. Its artistic and conceptual ambitions were a great stretch given the purist sentiment then prevalent in U.S. punk rock. Zen Arcade received critical praise and significant mainstream music press attention, ending up on several year-end best-of lists. It also helped expand the band's audience beyond the punk community. In his review for Rolling Stone, David Fricke described Zen Arcade as [...] "the closest hardcore will ever get to an opera ... a kind of thrash Quadrophenia." [...] In 1989, Zen Arcade was ranked No. 33 on Rolling Stones list of the 100 greatest albums of the 1980s. SST erred {{on the side of caution}} and initially pressed between 3,500 and 5,000 copies of the album, but the record sold out a few weeks into the band's tour in support of the record. The album remained out of stock for months afterward, which affected sales and frustrated the band.|$|E

6000|$|Guy Pollock {{answered}} with disconcerting readiness, [...] "I'll tell you: since we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something artistic, {{and not simply}} fool around, I believe we ought to give something classic. How about 'The School for Scandal'?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Excuse me, Ralph, I {{simply said}} that the idea {{occurred}} to me that he might be a spy, which is a very different thing to my accusing him of being one. I am ready to admit that the chances are infinitely greater that he is an honest trader or a relation of the merchant, and that his presence here is perfectly legitimate and natural, than that he should be a spy. Still, there is a chance, if it be but one out of a thousand, that he may be the latter. I don't think that I am at all of a suspicious nature, but I really should like to learn a little about this man. I do not mean that I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. It would be an unworthy action to pry into another's business, when it is no concern of one's own. Still, I should like to know why he is here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{insisted that}} the hakims should be sent for. When they came I called them to witness that, at the Emir's command, I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the {{operation}} I had seen the white doctor perform, although I was but an ignorant man, and feared greatly that I might fail. I really was desperately nervous, though {{at the same time}} I did feel that, having seen the operation performed two or three times, and as it was a simple one, I {{ought to be able to}} do it. Of course, I had everything laid handy. The tourniquet was first put on the arm, and screwed tightly. Then I administered the chloroform, which took its effect speedily. My nerves were braced up now, and I do think I made a fair job of it--finding and tying up the arteries, cutting and sawing the bone off, and making a flap. A few stitches to keep this together, and it was done, and to my relief the Arab, who had lain as rigid as a statue, winced a little when the last stitch was put in.|$|E
