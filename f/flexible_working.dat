Regulation and practical use of <b>flexible</b> forms of <b>working</b> hours are current issues and the aim of this thesis is to provide comprehensive but clear explanation of these issues. As theoretical bases, the thesis includes parts focused on selected legal principles, international and national regulation of working time and the concept of flexibility. The main part of the thesis is divided into three sections, of which the first one deals with the practical use of <b>flexible</b> forms of <b>working</b> hours, the second one presents particular forms of working hours which are regulated in the Labour Code and the third one is devoted to <b>flexible</b> forms of <b>working</b> time, regulation of which the Labour Code does not include...|$|R

This includes the right to a minimum wage of £7.50 for over 25-year-olds under the National Minimum Wage Act 1998. The Working Time Regulations 1998 give the right to 28 days paid holidays, breaks from work, and attempts to limit excessively long working hours. The Employment Rights Act 1996 gives the right to leave for child care, and the right to request <b>flexible</b> <b>working</b> patterns.

25|$|Bob Hawke, a less polarising Labor leader than Whitlam, {{defeated}} Fraser at the 1983 Election. The {{new government}} stopped the Franklin Dam project via the High Court of Australia. The 1980s saw severe concerns about Australia's future economic health take hold, with severe current account deficits and high unemployment at times. Hawke, together with treasurer Paul Keating undertook micro-economic and industrial relations reform {{designed to increase}} efficiency and competitiveness. After the initial failure of the Whitlam model and partial dismantling under Fraser, Hawke re-established a new, universal system of health insurance called Medicare. Hawke and Keating abandoned traditional Labor support for tariffs to protect industry and jobs. They moved to deregulate Australia’s financial system and ‘floated’ the Australian dollar. An agreement was reached with trade unions to moderate wage demands and accept more <b>flexible</b> <b>working</b> condition arrangements by accepting tax cuts in return. Ultimately, many of the reforms, continued by successive governments, {{appear to have been}} successful in pushing the economy along.|$|E

500|$|Around 1957–58, Tyndall {{decided to}} commit {{full-time}} to his political cause, something enabled {{by the fact}} that his job as a salesman allowed him <b>flexible</b> <b>working</b> hours. He decided against joining the Union Movement led by prominent British fascist Oswald Mosley, disagreeing with its promotion of the political union of Britain with continental Europe. Instead he was attracted to the League of Empire Loyalists (LEL)—a right-wing group founded by Arthur Chesterton—after seeing coverage of one of their demonstrations on television. He visited their basement office in Westminster, where he was given some of their literature. He enjoyed Chesterton's writings and concurred with his conspiracy theory that Jewish people had been plotting to bring down the British Empire. Tyndall began associating with other young men who had joined the LEL. At a February 1957 by-election in Lewisham North, Tyndall aided the LEL campaign, during which he met fellow party member John Bean, an industrial chemist. Both Tyndall and Bean were frustrated by the LEL's attempts to exert pressure on the mainstream Conservative Party. They wanted to be involved in a more radical party, one that would combine [...] "nationalism" [...] with [...] "popular socialism" [...] and which would reach out to the white working class through appeals against immigration from the Caribbean.|$|E

40|$|<b>Flexible</b> {{forms of}} <b>working</b> hours Flexibility is hotly debated {{term in the}} recent years and not only in a {{relation}} to labour market. This diploma thesis deals with <b>flexible</b> forms of <b>working</b> hours, which represents one of the means to achieve greater flexibility of labour law as well as flexible labour market. Increased options in adjusting working hours based on the needs of the subjects of labour-law relations contributes to more efficient use of employees work, provides new possibilities for some risk groups of employees on the labour market and helps employees in achieving work- life balance. These factors also have positive influence on unemployment rate. The thesis is divided into four chapters, which are further divided into subchapters. The first chapter introduces selected legal principles with the regards to the subject of the thesis. Main focus is on subsidiary relation between civil and labour law and "what is not forbidden, is allowed" principle, which is crucial for <b>flexible</b> forms of <b>working</b> hours, followed by an overview of selected basic principles of labour-law relations and introduction of flexicurity concept. The second chapter builds a foundation and much needed context for subsequent chapters by defining working hours and it's legal regulation on national as well as [...] ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{right of}} workers to collectively bargain with {{employers}} for a [...] "fair day's wage for a fair day's work" [...] {{is regarded as}} a fundamental right in common law, by the European Convention on Human Rights article 11, and in international law. Historically the UK had, however, left the procedure for making collective agreements, and their content, largely untouched by law. This began to change from 1971, though by contrast to other countries in the Commonwealth, Europe, or the United States the UK remains comparatively [...] "voluntarist". In principle, it is always possible for an employer and a trade union to come voluntarily to any collective agreement. Employers and unions would usually aim to develop an annually updated wage scale for workers, fair and <b>flexible</b> <b>working</b> time, holidays and breaks, transparent and just procedures for hiring or dismissals, fair and jointly administered pensions, and a commitment to work together for the enterprise's success. In 2010, around 32 per cent of the UK workforce was covered by a collective agreement, leaving around two-thirds of the British workforce with little influence over the terms of their work.|$|E
2500|$|In further {{specific}} situations, {{there are}} a jumble of other rights to leave spread across the ERA 1996 sections 55 to 80I. [...] "Emergency leave" [...] is, under ERA 1996 section 57A, available for employees to deal with birth or a child's issues at school, {{as well as other}} emergencies such as dependents' illness or death, so long as the employee informs the employer as soon as reasonably practicable. In Qua v John Ford Morrison Solicitors Cox J emphasised that there is no requirement to deliver daily updates. After EA 2002, employees gained the right to request <b>flexible</b> <b>working</b> patterns for the purpose of caring for a child under the age of 6, or a disabled child under age 18. The right to make the request is contained in ERA 1996 section 80F, {{and despite the fact that}} employers may decline the request, employers grant requests in 80 per cent of cases. An employee must make the request in writing, the employer must reply in writing, and can only decline the request on the basis of a correct fact assessment, and within 8 grounds listed in section 80G, which generally concern business and organisational necessity. In Commotion Ltd v Rutty a toy warehouse assistant was refused a reduction to part-time work because, according to the manager, everyone needed to work full-time to maintain [...] "team spirit". The Employment Appeal Tribunal ruled that because [...] "team spirit" [...] was not one of the legitimate grounds for refusal, Mrs Rutty should get compensation, which is set at a maximum of 8 weeks' pay. Finally, the ERA 1996 sections 63D-I give employees (and agency workers are expressly included) the right to request the right to get time off for training.|$|E
