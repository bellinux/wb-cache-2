5000|$|The Act {{is often}} wrongly {{described}} as {{the origin of the}} writ of habeas corpus. But the writ of habeas corpus had existed in various forms in England for at least five centuries before and is thought to have originated in the 12th Century Assize of Clarendon.

[...] The Act of 1679 followed an earlier Habeas Corpus Act of 1640, which established that the command of the King or the Privy Council was no answer to a petition of habeas corpus. Further Habeas Corpus Acts were passed by the British Parliament in 1803, 1804, 1816, and 1862, but it is the Act of 1679 which is remembered {{as one of the most}} important statutes in English constitutional history.

40|$|Dissenter {{from the}} Fourth Crusade, <b>disseised</b> earl of Leicester, {{leader of the}} Albigensian Crusade, prince of {{southern}} France: Simon of Montfort led a remarkable career of ascent from mid-level French baron to semi-independent count before his violent death before the walls of Toulouse in 1218. Through the vehicle of the crusade, Simon cultivated autonomous power in the liminal space between competing royal lordships in southern France {{in order to build}} his own principality. This first English biographical study of his life examines the ways in which Simon succeeded and failed in developing this independence in France, England, the Midi, and on campaign to Jerusalem. Simon’s familial, social, and intellectual connexions shaped his conceptions of political order, which he then implemented in his conquests. By analysing contemporary narrative, scholastic, and documentary evidence—including a wealth of archival material—this book argues that Simon’s career demonstrates the vitality of baronial independence in the High Middle Ages, despite the emergence of centralised royal bureaucracies. More importantly, Simon’s experience shows that barons themselves adopted methods of government that reflected a concern for accountability, public order, and contemporary reform ideals. This study therefore marks an important entry in the debate about baronial responsibility in medieval political development, as well as providing the most complete modern account of the life of this important but oft-overlooked crusader...|$|R

Accordingly, when negotiations broke down with Manfred in 1262, Pope Urban IV again took up the scheme of <b>disseising</b> the Hohenstaufen from the kingdom, and offered the crown to Charles again. Manfred's own usurpation from Conradin told upon King Louis' scruples; this time, he was persuaded to admit the offer, and Charles ratified a treaty with the Pope in July 1263. The terms were heavily in favor of the Pope; the kingdom must never be re-united with the Empire, and the king was never to hold Imperial or Papal office, or interfere with ecclesiastical matters in the kingdom. Nevertheless, Charles accepted eagerly. For money, he called for help from the then-omnipotent Sienese banker Orlando Bonsignori. Charles' cousin, Henry of Castile (the Senator), lent him forty thousand ounces of gold to finance the war against King Manfred. This loan was never repaid. Henry of Castile, angered by Charles' disregard, changed sides to Conradin's and fought with a host of Spanish knights against Charles in Tagliacozzo. Defeated, Henry was imprisoned by Charles for 22 years in Canosa di Puglia and Castel del Monte, where he wrote the famous novel of chivalry, Amadis de Gaula.|$|R

It is a balance our Government has, I believe, got right. But in order to ensure we continue to do so, this conversation is one that should proceed in a considered manner respectful of the views and experience of others. And to better understand where we should go, we should not forget from where we came. Eight hundred years ago, England’s most despised King affixed his seal to England’s most venerated document. As a peace treaty the Magna Carta failed - King John renounced it within a month, the civil war was resumed and the rebellious barons effectively renounced it within a year when they offered the throne to the French heir. Most of its 63 chapters are long forgotten, but generations of Britons and their descendants in the New Worlds of the Western and Southern Hemispheres drew from it the very distillation of the rule of law. Most important of all is what became Chapter 29 in the 1297 restatement: “No freeman is to be taken or imprisoned or <b>disseised</b> of his free tenement or of his liberties or free customs, or outlawed or exiled or in any way ruined, nor will we go against such a man or send against him save by lawful judgement of his peers or by the law of the land.

40|$|When {{battle and}} inquest were {{introduced}} into England by the Normans as modes of proof, {{they took their}} places beside the Anglo-Saxon ordeal and wager of law as methods of determining disputes between litigants. The functions of the court {{with reference to the}} inquest were identical with its functions with respect to the ordeal or battle, namely, to decide whether it was a permitted means of proof and to supervise its performance. The issues submitted to the older forms of trial frequently, if not usually, involved mixed conclusions of law and fact. Naturally the inquiries put to the inquest were of a similar character. There was no thought of separating questions of law from questions of fact. Thus, the grand assize in a writ of right was asked to say whether the demandant or the tenant had the greater right in the land, services, or other thing involved. In the assize of novel disseisin, the jurors who forrmed the petty assize were called upon to determine whether A had <b>disseised</b> B unjustly and without judgment. In the assize of mort d 2 ̆ 7 ancestor, they were required to tell whether A was seised of certain land on the day of his death and whether B was his next heir. The answer given by ordeal, battle, or wager of law was final, for it was dictated by the supernatural. While there {{seems to have been a}} tendency at first to accord the same finality to the answer given by the inquest, yet it was early perceived that, as the work of mere man, it was liable to error, and that it should be subject to correction...|$|R
6000|$|It {{is hard to}} {{distinguish}} with the last degree of accuracy what laws are fundamental, and what not. However, there is a distinction between them, authorized by the writers on jurisprudence, and recognized in some of our statutes. I admit the acts of King William and Queen Anne to be fundamental, {{but they are not}} the only fundamental laws. The law called Magna Charta, by which it is provided that [...] "no man shall be <b>disseised</b> of his liberties and free customs but by the judgment of his peers or the laws of the land," [...] (meaning clearly, for some proved crime tried and adjudged,) I take to be a fundamental law. Now, although this Magna Charta, or some of the statutes establishing it, provide that that law shall be perpetual, and all statutes contrary to it shall be void, yet I cannot {{go so far as to}} deny the authority of statutes made in defiance of Magna Charta and all its principles. This, however, I will say,--that it is a very venerable law, made by very wise and learned men, and that the legislature, in their attempt to perpetuate it, even against the authority of future Parliaments, have shown their judgment that it is fundamental, on the same grounds and in the same manner that the act of the fifth of Anne has considered and declared the establishment of the Church of England to be fundamental. Magna Charta, which secured these franchises to the subjects, regarded the rights of freeholders in counties to be as much a fundamental part of the Constitution as the establishment of the Church of England was thought either at that time, or in the act of King William, or in the act of Queen Anne.|$|R
