5000|$|A tee is {{an object}} (wooden or plastic) that is pushed into or {{placed on the}} ground to rest a ball on top of for an easier shot; however, this is only allowed for the first stroke (tee shot or drive) of each hole. Conventional <b>golf</b> <b>tees</b> are {{basically}} spikes with a small cup on the head to hold the ball, and are usually made of wood or plastic. Wooden tees are generally very inexpensive and quite disposable; a player may damage or break many of these {{during the course of a}} round. Plastic tees are generally more expensive but last longer. The length of tees varies according to the club intended to be used and by personal preference; longer tees (3-3.5") allow the player to position the ball higher off the ground while remaining stable when planted, and are generally used for modern deep-faced woods. They can be planted deeper for use with other clubs but then tend to break more often. Shorter tees (1.5-2.5") are suitable for irons and are more easily inserted and less easily broken than long tees. Other designs of tee exist; the [...] "step tee" [...] is milled or molded with a spool-shaped upper half, and so generally provides a consistent ball height from shot to shot. The [...] "brush tee" [...] uses a collection of stiff bristles instead of a cup to position the ball; the design is touted by its manufacturer as providing less interference to the ball or club at impact, for a straighter, longer flight.|$|E

40|$|Soccer {{fields and}} golf courses in Norway are {{reported}} to have poor playing surfaces. This {{study was conducted to}} determine the rootzone composition and the turf quality on sports areas exposed to compaction and wear. Thirty-nine soccer fields were investigated in August/September of 1990, and further eighteen fields and nineteen golf courses in the late summer of 1993. Non-acceptable turf quality was observed on 33 % of the soccer fields, while 3. 5 % of the playing surfaces were excellent. There was a tendency of increased proportion of annual bluegrass as the overall quality ratings decreased. A combination of fine-textured rootzone material, and high gravel and organic matter content, was found independent of the turf quality ratings. On the golf courses, 64 % of the tees and 26 % of the greens did not have acceptable playing surfaces. Both <b>golf</b> <b>tees</b> and greens had more sandy and uniform rootzones with a lower organic matter content than the soccer fields. ...|$|E
40|$|Chance seedling: {{observed}} in about 1989 as a distinctly coarser textured, densely matting, darker green mutant bermuda grass plant growing among the hybrid ‘Tifgreen’ {{on the eighth}} green at the Townsville Golf Course. Although ‘TL 1 ’ was selected from a sward of the hybrid Bermuda grass ‘Tifgreen’, its inflorescence structure (4, not 3, racemes per inflorescence), agronomic attributes (e. g. its tolerance to certain herbicides), and its DNA profile are consistent with a chance seedling of Cynodon dactylon rather than a mutant plant of hybrid (C. dactylon x transvaalensis) origin. Selection criteria: exceptionally short stolon internodes resulting in an extremely tight knit stolon mat under close (c. 5 - 6 mm) but not very close (c. 3 - 4 mm) mowing; very deep, strong rhizome system; very dark green colour; tolerates shade better than other Australian bermuda grass varieties of common knowledge (except for ‘Plateau’A); and remains low growing under heavy tropical cloud cover even after 6 - 8 months. Designated ‘TL 1 ’ by Tropical Lawns Pty Ltd and trialed successfully during the late 1990 s and early 2000 s in high wear situations (e. g. <b>golf</b> <b>tees)</b> in north Queensland.

40|$|Ecologists {{often use}} {{multiple}} observer transect surveys to census animal populations. In addition to animal counts, these surveys produce sequences of detections and non-detections for each observer. When combined with additional data (i. e. covariates such as {{distance from the}} transect line), these sequences provide the additional information to estimate absolute abundance when detectability on the transect line is less than one. Although existing analysis approaches for such data have proven extremely useful, they have some limitations. For instance, {{it is difficult to}} extrapolate from observed areas to unobserved areas unless a rigorous sampling design is adhered to; it is also difficult to share information across spatial and temporal domains or to accommodate habitat-abundance relationships. In this paper, we introduce a hierarchical modeling framework for multiple observer line transects that removes these limitations. In particular, abundance intensities can be modeled as a function of habitat covariates, making it easier to extrapolate to unsampled areas. Our approach relies on a complete data representation of the state space, where unobserved animals and their covariates are modeled using a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Observer detections are modeled via a bivariate normal distribution on the probit scale, with dependence induced by a distance-dependent correlation parameter. We illustrate performance of our approach with simulated data and on a known population of <b>golf</b> <b>tees.</b> In both cases, we show that our hierarchical modeling approach yields accurate inference about abundance and related parameters.

40|$|In {{the chronicle}} of life, the passing away {{of a person}} is oft simply noted as demise. At other times, such an event is {{recorded}} {{as the end of}} an era.

Abdul Majid’s life and times spanning 92 years reminds us of another person in another era in another country who rose from the log cabin to the White House, but just more remarkable that ours was in a far- flung outpost of the British Empire. The beginning Abdul Majid was born, the eldest of 12 children, in his grandfather’s house in Kampong Baru in Kuala Lumpur, on 15 November 1921, to Ismail, his “Baba”, as he liked to refer to his father, who was a poor, illiterate machinist in the Central Railway Workshops in Sentul. His mother was “Nya ” to him. His years of growing up and schooling were sprinkled with escapades of mischief and pranks, recorded in his own words and inimitable style in his memoir. He was Mark Twain’s Huckleberry Finn and Charles Dickens ’ Artful Dodger rolled into one but totally harmless and quite innocent. At various times through those years he had been a farmer, a golf caddy (carrying the bag for the white tuan and his mem – there were no <b>golf</b> <b>tees</b> those days and the caddy had to shape a small mound of earth with his hand on which the golfer placed the ball for tee-off), an entrepreneur during the Japanese occupation (selling tapioca grown by him, kerosene oil and dried fish), a waiter at elegant government functions in Carcosa, a glamorous, elegant colonial mansion, celebrating British Empire Day or in honour of visiting royalties and dignitaries. He loved movies, fishing and climbing coconut trees, and in between when he was a boy he had typhoid fever and was treated with loads of quinine, and later in 1939 had survived an attack of scrub typhus.
