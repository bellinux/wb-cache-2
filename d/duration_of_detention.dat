On {{the question of}} whether the Migration Act allowed people in Al-Kateb's situation to be detained indefinitely, he said:"...the most that could ever be said in a particular case where it is not now, and has not been, reasonably practicable to effect removal, is that there is now no country which will receive a particular non-citizen whom Australia seeks to remove, and it cannot now be predicted when that will happen."He said that because the removal or deportation of people always involves some degree of uncertainty, then the interpretation of the relevant provisions in the Migration Act could not proceed on the assumption that removal is always possible. He concluded that:"...even if, as in this case, it is found that 'there is no real likelihood or prospect of non-citizen's removal in the reasonably foreseeable future', that does not mean that continued detention is not for the purpose of subsequent removal."Justice McHugh stated simply that the language of the sections was not ambiguous, and clearly required the indefinite detention of Al-Kateb.

Quality of life (QOL) is a broad concept incorporating the self-evaluation of one’s own health and well-being that can provide {{an understanding of the}} health and well-being of immigrant detainees. The aim of this study was to estimate QOL among immigrant detainees in Sweden and to assess its relationship with the services provided in detention centres and with the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>detention.</b> Design: All immigrants in all five existing Swedish detention centres (N 193) were invited to participate in the study (n 127). In this cross-sectional study, QOL was measured using the WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire, which was administered by the first author. The questionnaire contained four additional questions measuring participants ’ satisfaction with the services provided in detention. Associations between QOL domain scores and service satisfaction scores were assessed using regression analysis. The Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient was calculated to measure the degree of association between the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>detention</b> and QOL scores.

In so doing, we show how practices in both systems fail to meet basic human rights protections, raising urgent questions about the legitimacy and justification of these sites of confinement. Whereas in the UK problems arise from {{the absence of a}} statutory upper time limit to detention, in France it is the brevity for which foreign nationals may be held that raises humanitarian concerns.

40|$|This article {{addresses}} the state's police power authority to deprive people of liberty based on predictions of antisocial behavior. Most conspicuously exercised against so-called "sexual predators," this authority purportedly justifies {{a wide array}} of other state interventions as well, ranging from police stops to executions. Yet there still is no general theory <b>of</b> preventive <b>detention.</b> This article is a preliminary effort in that regard. The article first surveys the various objections to preventive detention: the unreliability objection; the punishment-in-disguise objection; the legality objection; and the dehumanization objection. None of these objections justifies a complete prohibition on the state's power to detain people based on dangerousness. But they do suggest significant limitations on that power regarding acceptable methods of prediction, the nature and <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> preventive <b>detention,</b> the threshold conduct that can trigger such detention, {{and the extent to which}} it can replace punishment as the official response to antisocial behavior. On the latter issue, the central conclusion is that preventive detention which functions as a substitute for punishment, as in the case of sexual predator statutes, is only permissible if certain psychological and predictive criteria are met. The rest of the paper develops these criteria. It argues that the psychological criterion should be undeterrability, defined as the characteristic ignorance that one's criminal activity is criminal or a characteristic willingness to commit crime despite certain and significant punishment, a definition that differs from both the usual academic stance and the Supreme Court's inability-to-control formulation. The paper next argues that selection of a prediction criterion should be informed by two principles, the proportionality principle (which varies the legally requisite level of dangerousness with the nature and <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> the state's intervention) and the consistency principle (which takes as a reference point the implicit dangerousness assessments in the law of crimes). Finally, the paper explores some of the implications of the latter principle for the criminal law, including the possibility that some crimes - in particular various possession offenses, reckless endangerment and vagrancy - violate the fundamental norms of the police power authority...|$|R
40|$|Personal {{freedom is}} one of the {{interests}} which were very early counted among the rights of an individual declared and protected by constitutions. The Constitution of the Polish People's Republic of 1952 generally grants to citizens personal inviolability and stresses that the deprivation of liberty may take place only in instances determined by law. In Polish law legal titles of the deprivation of liberty are highly diversified. They comprise repressive measures, e. g. the deprivation of liberty for criminal offences and transgressions, and to some extent, e. g. in military law, for disciplinary delicts, preventive measures in criminal proceedings, arrest and preliminary detention, executive measures in civil and criminal proceedings, forced hospitalization, e. g. of people with contagious diseases, or of people who commited offences but who require medical treatment in isolation due to the threat they constitute to others, measures applied towards addicts. internment in extraordinary situations, measures applied for diagnostic ses, etc. A new constitution should determine the grounds and purposes of the deprivation of liberty so that {{to reduce the number of}} situations when a citizen may be deprived of liberty.

40|$|Governments {{around the}} world use {{immigration}} detention to detain and deport irregular immigrants, which negatively affects their health. The aim of this thesis was to explore, describe and identify factors that could mitigate the effect of immigration detention {{on the health of}} detainees. This was a mixed method study using qualitative methods (Papers I and II), quantitative methods (Paper III) and descriptive case comparison (Paper IV) comparing the Swedish system to the system in the Benelux countries (Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg). The study design was strengthened by triangulation of methods and data sources. Detainees experienced lack of control over their own lives due to lack of information in a language they can understand, inadequate responses from detention staff and restrictions within detention centers further limiting their liberty. <b>Duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>detention</b> was negatively associated with satisfaction of services provided in detention and the detainees’ Quality of Life (QOL). Detainees had low QOL domain scores with the psychological domain having the lowest score (41. 9 / 100). The most significant factor positively associated with the QOL of detainees was the support received from detention staff. A sense of fear was present among detainees and staff. Detainees’ fear was due to their inadequate interaction with authorities, perceiving it as threatening, and due to their worry of facing repercussions of being involved in incidents caused by others. The potential for physical threat from detainees created a sense of fear among the staff. The detention staff expressed the need for more support to manage their emotional dilemma and role conflict of being a civil servant, simultaneously enabling the deportation process while providing humane care to detainees as fellow human beings. Detention centers in the Benelux countries had more categories of staff providing different services to detainees. Compared to the Benelux countries, healthcare services at the Swedish detention centers were limited. Detainees were offered no medical screening on arrival and no regular access to mental healthcare professionals. Detaining authorities have the obligation to safeguard the health of detainees.

40|$|SUMMARY {{by public}} safety for the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>detention,</b> {{but also for}} the {{long-term}} aims of rehabilitation, treatment and other individual interests. This also enforces an adequate offer of care, which suits the risk for recidivism and which is equivalent to the care outside detention. With the ISD it is necessary that authorities concerned will hold the view that the two-years detention is primarily aimed at contributing to solving the individual offender problems. By that, not only an individual interest is served, but also the currently prioritized collective interests of public safety and prevention of recidivism. Moreover, this chapter discusses the research question and provides answers. First, the positioning of the ISD in the historical development of the Dutch penal sanction system with regard to combating recidivism and criminal nuisance is discussed. Based on the foundation, the legitimacy of the statutory regulation, the objective, the offender target group and the execution of this particular sanctioning, it is concluded that the ISD fits within a broader, long-term and lasting development. In many ways, the ISD builds on aspects of the labour colony penalty, the statutory regulation for recidivism, the criminal custody measure and, especially, the SOV. This development appears to be continuing, considering the bill introducing minimum penalties for recidivism of severe crimes, as well as the bill introducing a restraining criminal measure to impose, for example, area injunctions on offenders. Because this past and future development together concern the criminal theoretical dual system of a penalty and a criminal measure, the minima and maxima of the applied sanctions, the conditional or unconditional detention and finally, the restraint, it is concluded that for the last 125 years the legislator has wanted to make full use of the penal sanction system to combat recidivism and criminal nuisance. When social problems are indeed so severe that a certain use is necessary, this broad sanctioning can in principle be legitimate. However, a less simplistic and functional legitimation is needed. Furthermore, {{there is a need for}} an integrated, systematic revision of the penal sanction system. The conclusion that the ISD fits within a broader, long-term and lasting development leaves unimpeded that there appears to be no lucid, constant, balanced development. [...] . etc...|$|E

40|$|Background: In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo), {{maternal}} mortality is high, government financing {{for health care}} negligible, and 80 % of people live in poverty. Women unable to pay hospital charges may be detained in hospital beyond the standard 3 days after an uncomplicated birth or 10 days after a caesarean. Here, we aimed to document policy and practice around detention {{of women in the}} maternity ward of a large government hospital in Lubumbashi, DR Congo. Methods: In a cross-sectional survey of post-partum women in the Jason Sendwe Hospital's maternity ward, we collected information on socioeconomic, demographic, and obstetric characteristics, and recorded the number of mother-infant pairs detained for non-payment of medical fees. We conducted semi-structured interviews with clinical staff and administrators about policy, and did a retrospective record review to identify the number of mother-infant pairs that had been detained for non-payment in 2014 and 2015. Findings: Of 85 women in the maternity ward and eligible for discharge between August 5 and September 15, 2016, 46 (54 %) were detained for non-payment of medical fees. Median <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>detention</b> was 5 days (range 1 – 30) and amounts owed were between US$ 8 and $ 611 (median $ 317). All the detained women in this study had received emergency care for delivery-related complications. To leave, four women went into debt, three sold belongings, and 14 were released when a politician paid their bills; 25 had not resolved their detention by study end on (September 15, 2016). From the retrospective record review, we identified 2446 deliveries at Sendwe hospital in 2014 and 2015; of these, 716 files included discharge data, and we retrospectively identified 108 cases of post-partum detention. From interviews with ten hospital clinical staff and administrators, we noted that detention of post-partum women and their infants for non-payment of hospital fees is accepted practice, and that hospital and staff depend on revenue from the maternity unit for hospital operating costs, including staff salaries. Interpretation: Cost recovery can increase out-of-pocket payments and limit access to care for health-care users. Dependence on user fees has also put health-care providers and facility administrators in a difficult situation, since money for their salaries and supplies must come out of revenues, which may be insufficient if users do not pay. We hope our findings about reasons for, and the frequency of, detention for non-payment of fees will support proposals for changes in policy and alternative models of health-care financing in DR Congo. Such changes would improve quality and access to care and reduce or eliminate the human rights violation of post-partum detention of women who cannot pay hospital fees. Funding: None...|$|E

However, by July 2010, then Prime Minister, Julia Gillard announced in her first major policy speech that the Government had begun having discussions with regional neighbours about the possibility of establishing a regional processing centre for the purpose of receiving and processing irregular entrants to the region. Whilst only 25 asylum seekers had travelled by boat to Australia to seek asylum in the 2007 – 08 financial year by the time Gillard made her announcement in July 2010, more than 5, 000 people had travelled by boat to Australia to seek asylum. Whilst Gillard acknowledged that the number of asylum seekers arriving by boat to Australia was ‘very, very minor’ and that at the current rate of arrival it would take about 20 years to fill the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) with asylum seekers, she identified a number of reasons why the processing of asylum seekers in other countries was again considered necessary: 	to ensure that people smugglers have no product to sell 	to remove the financial incentive for the people smugglers to send boats to Australia 	to ensure that those arriving by boat do not get an unfair advantage over others 	to secure Australia’s borders and create a fair and orderly migration 	to prevent people embarking on a voyage across dangerous seas with the ever present risk of death 	to ensure that everyone is subject to a consistent, fair assessment process 	to improve the protection outcomes for refugees by establishing a framework for orderly migration within the region 	to prevent the piling up of unauthorised arrivals in detention in Australia 	in response to increased numbers of unauthorised people movements in the region and around the world and 	in acknowledgment that irregular migration is a global challenge that can only be tackled by nations working together. Though it took another two years for her Government to secure the statutory and practical arrangements for asylum seekers to be sent to third countries, people began to be transferred to Nauru on 14 September 2012 and to PNG on 21 November 2012. It was not until two months before the 2013 federal election and in the wake of growing support for the Opposition’s tougher border protection policies, newly appointed Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd made a surprise announcement on 19 July 2013 that Australia had entered into a Regional Resettlement Arrangement with Papua New Guinea (PNG). Under the Arrangement, all (not just some) asylum seekers that arrive by boat would be transferred to PNG for processing and resettlement in PNG and in any other participating regional State. He subsequently made a similar Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Nauru. Notwithstanding Prime Minister Rudd’s announcement, the Australian Labor Party was unable to secure another term in office and on 7 September 2013, the Liberal and National parties were voted in to form a Coalition Government, led by Tony Abbott. The current Coalition Government continues to implement the former Government’s offshore processing arrangements. However, the offshore processing of asylum seekers in Nauru and PNG has in due course proved contentious for a number of reasons, including: 	the financial cost (see statistics below) 	ongoing concerns about the safety and security of asylum seekers in the Processing Centres and in the broader community 	ongoing concerns about the sustainability of involuntary settlement (currently in Nauru, PNG and Cambodia) 	prolonged <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>detention</b> and harsh living conditions are seen by some as punitive which is said to be causing or exacerbating psychological harm and 	inadequate independent oversight of the Processing Centres to ensure relevant international standards are being met (see Annex for further information about these concerns).
