The building served as an anchor for Omak until its location was transferred when the post office moved to the former building's location.|$|E

60|$|The {{year was}} drawing to its {{end and the}} time {{approached}} when I was to leave Samoa. My boat was scheduled to sail for Sydney {{on the fourth of}} January. Christmas Day had been celebrated at the hotel with suitable ceremonies, but it was looked upon as no more than a rehearsal <b>for</b> <b>New</b> <b>Year,</b> and the men who were accustomed to foregather in the lounge determined on New Year's Eve to make a night of it. There was an uproarious dinner, after which the party sauntered down to the English Club, a simple little frame house, to play pool. There {{was a great deal of}} talking, laughing, and betting, but some very poor play, except on the part of Miller, who had drunk as much as any of them, all far younger than he, but had kept unimpaired the keenness of his eye and the sureness of his hand. He pocketed the young men's money with humour and urbanity. After an hour of this I grew tired and went out. I crossed the road and came on to the beach. Three coconut trees grew there, like three moon maidens waiting for their lovers to ride out of the sea, and I sat at the foot of one of them, watching the lagoon and the nightly assemblage of the stars.|$|E
