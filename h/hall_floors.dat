2500|$|The reconfigured {{platforms}} and new station building, platform awnings and subway at Graceville Railway Station, built between [...] and 1959, demonstrate the principal {{characteristics of a}} suburban railway station embodying Modernist post-World War Two architectural ideas. As part of what was a large suite of similar but individually-designed station structures, Graceville stands out as a significant example of the type, being the first constructed and described {{at the time as}} the most modern in Australia. The Graceville and Chelmer railway stations are the most aesthetically successful examples of the butterfly-roof typology adopted for station building and awning design at that time, utilising new materials and technologies to perform the tasks of sheltering passengers, selling tickets and outfitting rail staff. Through a high degree of intactness, the Graceville station complex maintains the integrity of its original design, and is greatly complemented by the standardised butterfly-roofed platform awnings, also largely intact, that accompany it. Significant elements include the platforms, station building, platform awnings, and subway, and fabric of particular note includes: terrazzo tiles to the waiting room and ticket <b>hall</b> <b>floors,</b> the painted steel balustrade to the stairs leading from the subway, the terrazzo windows sills and the early aluminium double-hung window sets, the tiles to the subway walls, the timber and concrete seating throughout, the cast iron drinking fountain adjacent to the northern facade of the building, and the lettering on the southern and western facades of the building.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1976 The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to examine factors associated with the social climate of single-sex and coeducational residence halls, fraternities, sororities, and cooperatives on the Oregon State University campus. The primary sources of data for this study were student responses to the ten subscales of the URES Form R, as well as responses to a set of locally developed questions which accompanied the URES and which provided data on ordinal position of birth, family size, dating frequency, and extracurricular activity. In addition, living group mean scores for SAT-V, SAT-M, high school and college grade point averages were obtained from appropriate student records. Participants in the study were students living on randomly selected floors in physically similar residence halls, and in randomly selected fraternities, sororities, and cooperatives. A total of 1016 students completed the URES and the related questionnaire near the end of January, 1975. The data were analyzed through the use of analysis of variance, the Least Significant Difference test, the Pearson product moment correlation coefficient, and the chi-square test of independence. Statistical comparisons were made to determine if differences existed between: (1) each of the ten URES Form R subscale mean scores of all living group types involved in the study; (2) scholastic aptitude and academic achievement of students who resided in single-sex residence halls; (3) a selected aspect of the living group environment, as measured by a subscale mean score, and corresponding measures of student social and academic activity; and (4) ordinal position of birth and living group type selected. Observed differences were accepted as significant when p ≤. 05. The follow ing selected conclusions were drawn from the results of the study: 1. Students residing in coeducational residence halls scored significantly higher on the Intellectuality subscale than students who resided in single-sex halls, but {{there were no significant differences}} between the two living group-type mean scores on any of the remaining nine subscales. 2. Students residing in Greek living groups scored significantly higher than students who resided in cooperatives on the Involvement, Emotional Support, Traditional Social Orientation, Intellectuality, and Order and Organization subscales, and significantly lower on the Independence subscale. 3. Male students involved in the study scored significantly higher than females on the Independence and Innovation subscales, and significantly lower on the Emotional Support, Traditional Social Orientation, and Order and Organization subscales. 4. Students who resided in small living groups (fraternities, sororities, and cooperatives) scored significantly higher than students who resided in the larger living groups (coeducational and single-sex residence halls) on the Involvement, Emotional Support, Intellectuality, Order and Organization, and Student Influence subscales, and significantly lower on the Independence subscale. 5. No significant relationship existed between the Academic Achievement subscale mean scores and fall 1974 and winter 1975 college grade point averages of the students who resided on the 12 residence <b>hall</b> <b>floors</b> involved in the study. 6. A significant relationship existed between the Involvement subscale mean score and the degree of actual participation in the internal affairs of all living group types except sororities and female cooperatives. 7. A significant relationship existed between the Traditional Social Orientation subscale mean score and the frequency of dating activity which occurred for students in single-sex male residence <b>hall</b> <b>floors,</b> fraternities, and female cooperatives. 8. A significant relationship existed between the Traditional Social Orientation subscale mean score and the frequency of internal, informal dating which occurred in the three female coeducational residence <b>hall</b> <b>floors</b> included in the study. 9. A significant relationship existed between the Traditional Social Orientation subscale mean score and the frequency of external, formal dating which occurred in the three male coeducational residence <b>hall</b> <b>floors</b> included in the study...|$|E

The organization of Residential Life is very similar to that of many large departments: employees are hierarchically organized and policy is set in a hierarchical fashion as well. Policies that affect residents are made by administrators (starting with a director) and implemented by the resident advisors. This is where communication appears to be absent.

40|$|As the {{consumption}} levels of alcoholic beverages have increased {{on college campuses}} across the country, administrators have addressed the problem by presenting information-related programs to students {{in order to increase}} student understanding of the effects of alcohol. Evaluations of these programs have generally concluded that the programs have not been successful in changing student drinking behavior;The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the impact of an alcohol education program series on residence hall student drinking behaviors at Iowa State University. In addition, selected environmental characteristics were assessed to determine their impact on student consumption levels. The programs were presented to a treatment group of six residence <b>hall</b> <b>floors</b> following a pre-test assessment of the twelve floors chosen for this study. The treatment and control groups each consisted of a male, female and co-ed floor from a high-rise and low-rise building. At the end of the session, a post-test was conducted on the sample;The pre-test results revealed a significant difference between the alcohol use levels on male and female floors with males having a higher consumption rate. There was also a significant difference between the alcohol use between co-ed floors and single-sex floors with students living on co-ed floors reporting higher rates of use;The post-test results indicated a significant reduction in {{the consumption}} levels of residences in low-rise buildings from the pre-test to the post-test. Co-ed residents also reported a significant reduction during the test period. Male treatment group members also exhibited a decrease in drinking behaviors, while control group members exhibited an increase. The results also indicate that although neither the program series nor the environment had a significant affect on student alcohol use, the interaction between the two variables had a significant affect;Generally, the results indicate that sub-group differences exist within residence hall environments which affect student alcohol use. Persons developing alcohol education programs should understand and address these differences in their programming efforts in order to have a greater impact on student drinking behaviors...|$|E
