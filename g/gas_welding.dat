40|$|Abstract In {{order to}} {{establish}} a reasonable and integrated fatigue design criterion for the long life design of the <b>gas</b> <b>welded</b> body structure, stress distribution around the <b>gas</b> <b>welded</b> joints subjected to tensile load was numerically analyzed. And also, the ∆P-Nf curves were obtained by fatigue tests. By using these results, ∆P-Nf curves were rearranged in the ∆σ-Nf relation with the hot spot stress at the welded joint.

25|$|Oxy-fuel {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} welding processes, besides forge welding. In recent decades it has been obsolesced in almost all {{industrial}} uses due to various arc welding methods offering more consistent mechanical weld properties and faster application. <b>Gas</b> <b>welding</b> is still used for metal-based artwork and in smaller home based shops, as well as situations where accessing electricity (e.g., via an extension cord or portable generator) would present difficulties.|$|E
500|$|Russell Meredith of Northrop Aircraft {{perfected the}} process in 1941. Meredith named the process Heliarc because it used a {{tungsten}} electrode arc and helium as a shielding gas, but it {{is often referred to}} as tungsten inert <b>gas</b> <b>welding</b> (TIG). [...] The American Welding Society's official term is gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW). Linde Air Products developed a wide range of air-cooled and water-cooled torches, gas lenses to improve shielding, and other accessories that increased the use of the process. Initially, the electrode overheated quickly and, despite tungsten's high melting temperature, particles of tungsten were transferred to the weld. To address this problem, the polarity of the electrode was changed from positive to negative, but the change made it unsuitable for welding many non-ferrous materials. Finally, the development of alternating current units made it possible to stabilize the arc and produce high quality aluminum and magnesium welds.|$|E
2500|$|Oxy-fuel welding (commonly called {{oxyacetylene}} welding, oxy welding, or <b>gas</b> <b>welding</b> in the U.S.) and oxy-fuel cutting [...] are {{processes that}} use fuel gases and oxygen to weld and cut metals, respectively. French engineers Edmond Fouché and Charles Picard {{became the first}} to develop oxygen-acetylene welding in 1903. [...] Pure oxygen, instead of air, is used to increase the flame temperature to allow localized melting of the workpiece material (e.g. steel) in a room environment. A common propane/air flame burns at about , a propane/oxygen flame burns at about , an oxyhydrogen flame burns at , and an acetylene/oxygen flame burns at about [...]|$|E

50|$|While {{weldability}} can {{be generally}} defined for various materials, some welding processes work better {{for a given}} material than others.

2500|$|Approximately 20% of {{acetylene}} {{is supplied}} by the industrial gases industry for oxyacetylene <b>gas</b> <b>welding</b> and cutting due to the high temperature of the flame. Combustion of acetylene with oxygen produces a flame of over , releasing 11.8kJ/g. Oxyacetylene is the hottest burning common fuel gas. [...] Acetylene is the third-hottest natural chemical flame after dicyanoacetylene's [...] and cyanogen at [...] Oxy-acetylene welding was a popular welding process in previous decades. The development and advantages of arc-based welding processes have made oxy-fuel welding nearly extinct for many applications. Acetylene usage for welding has dropped significantly. On the other hand, oxy-acetylene welding equipment is quite versatile – {{not only because the}} torch is preferred for some sorts of iron or steel welding (as in certain artistic applications), but also because it lends itself easily to brazing, braze-welding, metal heating (for annealing or tempering, bending or forming), the loosening of corroded nuts and bolts, and other applications. Bell Canada cable repair technicians still use portable acetylene fuelled torch kits as a soldering tool for sealing lead sleeve splices in manholes and in some aerial locations. Oxyacetylene welding may also be used in areas where electricity is not readily accessible. As well, oxy-fuel cutting is still popular and oxy-acetylene cutting is utilized in many metal fabrication shops. For use in welding and cutting, the working pressures must be controlled by a regulator, since above 15 psi, if subjected to a shockwave (caused for example by a flashback), acetylene decomposes explosively into hydrogen and carbon.|$|E
