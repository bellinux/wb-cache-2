5|$|During {{his later}} {{creative}} years, Rodin's work turned increasingly toward the female form, and themes of more overt masculinity and femininity. He concentrated on small dance studies, and produced numerous erotic drawings, sketched {{in a loose}} way, without taking his pencil from the paper or his <b>eyes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> model. Rodin met American dancer Isadora Duncan in 1900, attempted to seduce her, {{and the next year}} sketched studies of her and her students. In July 1906, Rodin was also enchanted by dancers from the Royal Ballet of Cambodia, and produced some of his most famous drawings from the experience.|$|E
25|$|Protective eyewear is {{beneficial}} to those exposed to ultraviolet radiation. Since light {{can reach the}} <b>eyes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sides, full-coverage eye protection is usually warranted {{if there is an}} increased risk of exposure, as in high-altitude mountaineering. Mountaineers are exposed to higher-than-ordinary levels of UV radiation, both because there is less atmospheric filtering and because of reflection from snow and ice.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} diaries from {{survivors}} {{and hundreds of}} written correspondences made to relations {{from those in the}} ghetto at the time. Photos of many of the ghetto's deportees to Auschwitz were preserved. A collection of over 2,000 photographs was discovered in October, 1986, including many images of life in Będzin and the ghetto. Some of them have been published in a book or in a video. The <b>Eyes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Ashes Foundation administers the collection.|$|E

25|$|By {{wearing a}} flat diving mask, humans can see clearly under water. The scuba mask's flat window {{separates}} the <b>eyes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> surrounding water by {{a layer of}} air. Light rays entering from water into the flat parallel window change their direction minimally within the window material itself. But when these rays exit the window into the air space between the flat window and the eye, the refraction is quite noticeable. The view paths refract (bend) {{in a manner similar}} to viewing fish kept in an aquarium. Linear polarizing filters decrease visibility underwater by limiting ambient light and dimming artificial light sources.|$|E
25|$|The Brooklyn Excelsiors was {{the first}} team to wear what would later become the modern {{baseball}} cap, with its distinctive rounded top and peak, in the 1860s. By {{the early years of the}} twentieth century, this style of cap had become common, but some teams occasionally revived the flat-topped cap, such as the New York Giants in 1916 and the Pittsburgh Pirates as recently as during the 1979 World Series. Over time, the peak has enlarged slightly to further protect the player's <b>eyes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sun. More recently, players have worn hats with fold-down ear flaps in cold weather.|$|E
25|$|The {{nature of}} the Emerald City is changed in the film. In the book, the city is not {{actually}} all green, but everyone is forced to wear green tinted spectacles (ostensibly to protect their <b>eyes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> glory and splendor of the luxurious city), thus making everything appear green. In the film, the city is actually all green. The architecture of the Emerald City in the movie uses a much more contemporary Art Deco style than Baum could have imagined. In the book, a giant green wall studded in glittering emeralds surrounds the entire city, whereas in the movie {{there is only a}} gate opening.|$|E

25|$|As a rule {{it is not}} {{difficult}} to guess which eyes are which in a living or preserved specimen, but sometimes it can be. Apart from the fact that in some species one or more pairs may be missing, sometimes <b>eyes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> posterior and anterior rows may be very close to each other, or even fused. Also, either one row or both might be so grossly curved that some of the notionally anterior eyes actually may lie posterior to some of the eyes in the posterior row. In some species the curve is so gross that the eyes apparently are arranged into two anteroposterior parallel rows of eyes.|$|E
25|$|Blücher's army finally lurched {{into motion}} on 18 March, with its {{commander}} wearing a lady's green silk hat {{in order to}} protect his inflamed <b>eyes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sun. On this day, Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg's corps compelled Étienne Pierre Sylvestre Ricard's division to abandon Berry-au-Bac though the French managed to destroy the bridge over the Aisne River. Marmont had overall command of the forces facing Blücher and his orders were to cover Paris and stop his foes from crossing the Aisne. Mortier was at Reims while Henri François Marie Charpentier's division held Soissons. Since Blücher had 109,000 troops while the French only mustered 13,000 infantry and 3,600 cavalry, it was plain that the Allies could not be stopped for long. In order to block the road to Paris and to rendezvous with Charpentier, Marmont fell back southwest toward Fismes and called in Mortier from Reims. He believed that Blücher wished to bring him to battle, but in fact the Prussian field marshal was heading for Reims and Châlons-sur-Marne to link up with Schwarzenberg.|$|E
25|$|Meri was a kind-hearted and {{beautiful}} lady and Phra Rothasen {{lived with her}} very happily for some time, but he remembered his blind mother and aunts who still stayed in the dark cave. While showing him the palace, Meri had told Rothasen about certain magic medicines kept in a locked room including Phra Rothasen's mother and aunts's eyes. Then he made a plan to get Meri to sleep by making her drink wine and take the eyes for his mother and aunts. Thus one night, after Meri was sleeping, Phra Rothasen stole many medicines and the <b>eyes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> locked room. Meri woke up and looked for her husband but she saw him far away riding his flying horse. She suddenly grew into a giant and followed Phra Rothasen crying and calling him with a loud voice. To stop her, Phra Rothasen threw a magic branch that turned the space between them into a deep lake and a high mountain. Seeing her husband escape from her Meri wailed in despair, asking him to stop. Phra Rothasen was moved by her sad screams and replied that he will back after he finished his urgent mission. Then Phra Rothasen flew away and left Meri with a broken heart crying bitterly at {{the shore of the}} lake.|$|E

500|$|Analysts of {{democratisation}} in the Middle East {{cite the}} Islamists' references to respect {{human rights in}} their justification for these programmes as evidence that these groups {{can serve as a}} progressive force in the region. Some Islamist parties have been particularly critical of the government's readiness to sign international treaties such as the United Nations' International Convention on Civil and Political Rights. At a parliamentary session in June 2006 to discuss ratification of the Convention, Sheikh Adel Mouwda, the former leader of salafist party, Asalah, explained the party's objections: [...] "The convention has been tailored by our enemies, God kill them all, to serve their needs and protect their interests rather than ours. This why we have <b>eyes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> American Embassy watching us during our sessions, to ensure things are swinging their way".|$|E

The duo M/M (Paris), known for applying and integrating their work on photographs (so called dessin dans l'image, or [...] "drawings in the picture"), illustrated the cover, featuring a swan and the album's title with feathers. Björk thought swans embodied Vespertines music, describing them as [...] "a white, sort of winter bird" [...] and [...] "very romantic". Vespertine came with a booklet of M/M (Paris) artwork.|$|E

According to a myth attributed to the Sateré-Maué tribe, guarana's domestication originated with a deity killing a beloved village child. To console the villagers, a more benevolent god plucked <b>the</b> left <b>eye</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> child and planted it in the forest, resulting in the wild variety of guarana. The god then plucked <b>the</b> right <b>eye</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> child and planted it in the village, giving rise to domesticated guarana.|$|R

500|$|Six runs {{after the}} fall of Washbrook, the {{diminutive}} Emmett fended a rising ball from Lindwall to Sid Barnes at short leg, leaving England 28/2. Surprised by Lindwall's bouncer, Emmett took his <b>eyes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ball and fended with one hand on the horizontally-held bat, while ducking his head down below his arms. The ball bounced slowly off the pitch and after hitting Emmett's bat, rebounded gently up in the air for Barnes to collect. In Australia's match against Gloucestershire immediately preceding the Test, Lindwall bowled a bouncer to Emmett, who hesitantly parried it away for a single. Lindwall did not deliver any more bouncers to Emmett during the match, and O'Reilly thought the paceman was quietly waiting until the Tests to expose his opponent's weakness against the short ball. O'Reilly concluded that Australia's pace duo [...] "had again disposed of the English opening batsmen with the minimum amount of effort".|$|E
500|$|Julian Hirsch's {{cinematography}} can {{be regarded}} as a relief to the <b>eyes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> film's gory Holocaust theme, stated Ronnie Scheib (Variety). Jacques Mandelbaum at Le Devoir added that the beauty of scenes such as the arrival of the Romani in caravans in their first scene and the gentle music is a stark contrast to the harsh themes of concentration camps and extermination. Odile Tremblay (Le Monde) made mention of a number of scenes, including the one where Taloche opens a tap to [...] "free" [...] water, and the scene with an abandoned watch implying the ghettos as the best moments of the film. Nick Schager (The Village Voice) stated that the film scores on its aesthetics in sequences depicting key elements, like the one with trains symbolising the Holocaust, and its detailed depiction of the characters' intimate practices, which bring depth to a rather predictable plot. Brian Lafferty (East County Magazine) criticised Julian Hirsch for making the sequences look dull and gloomy with insufficient lighting. The tap scene received a special mention in L'Express review too.|$|E

500|$|The {{prominent}} {{facial features}} include the [...] long black tufts on the ears, two black stripes from the forehead to the nose, the black {{outline of the}} mouth, the distinctive black facial markings, and the white patches surrounding the eyes and the mouth. The eyes appear to be narrowly open due to the lowered upper eyelid, probably an adaptation to shield the <b>eyes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sun's glare. The ear tufts may start drooping as the animal ages. The coat is uniformly reddish tan or sandy, though black caracals are also known. The underbelly and the insides of the legs are lighter, often with small reddish markings. The fur, soft, short and dense, grows coarser in the summer. The ground hairs (the basal layer of hair covering the coat) are denser in winter than in summer. The length of the guard hairs (the hair extending above the ground hairs) can be up to [...] long in winter, but shorten to [...] in summer. These features indicate the onset of moulting in the hot season, typically in October and November. The hindlegs are longer than the forelegs, so that the body appears to be sloping downward from the rump.|$|E
500|$|Sleipnir is {{generally}} considered as appearing in a sequence of events described in book I of Gesta Danorum. In book I, the young Hadingus encounters [...] "a certain man of great age who had lost an eye" [...] who allies him with Liserus. Hadingus and Liserus set out to wage war on Lokerus, ruler of Kurland. Meeting defeat, the old man takes Hadingus with him onto his horse as they flee to the old man's house, and the two drink an invigorating drought. The old man sings a prophecy, and takes Hadingus back to where he found him on his horse. During the ride back, Hadingus trembles beneath the old man's mantle, and peers out of its holes. Hadingus realizes that he is flying through the air: [...] "and he saw that before {{the steps of the}} horse lay the sea; but was told not to steal a glimpse of the forbidden thing, and therefore turned his amazed <b>eyes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> dread spectacle of the roads that he journeyed." [...] Additionally, in book II, Biarco mentions Odin and Sleipnir: [...] "If I may look on the awful husband of Frigg, howsoever he be covered in his white shield, and guide his tall steed, he shall in no way go safe out of Leire; it is lawful to lay low in war the war-waging god." ...|$|E
500|$|The [...] is a {{heightened}} form of Sharingan introduced {{towards the end}} of Part I. At that time, the Mangekyō Sharingan is explained to be rare, even among the members of the Uchiha clan, and present only in those who have killed the person closest to them, be it their best friends, relatives, or significant others, either accidentally or intentionally. Madara Uchiha is stated to be the first person to awaken the Mangekyō Sharingan, which resulted in a common tradition for members of the Uchiha clan to follow his example by killing their friends, though an ability of the Mangekyō (Susanoo) had been used since {{the time of the first}} Sharingan user, Indra. In the case of transplanted eyes, when one of the <b>eyes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> same eyeset awakens the Mangekyō, the other eye awakens the Mangekyō too; this happened when Kakashi killed his best friend, causing Mangekyō to awaken in both himself and Obito. As explained late in Part II, the event is the end result of the [...] "Curse of Hatred", in which the brain releases special chakra to the eyes so that the Sharingan eventually transforms into Mangekyō Sharingan. While benefiting from increased power, the Uchiha clan members who possess the Mangekyō Sharingan will start to lose their sanity, eventually descending to complete madness.|$|E
