30|$|High {{stresses}} at the pin–bone interface {{contribute to}} micro-motion and failure resulting in unicortical loosening. Experimental models have demonstrated far higher pressures are generated under loading {{conditions at the}} bone interface from half pins as compared to fine wires [5]. The pin–bone interface has therefore been regarded as the weakest link in the mechanical stability of external fixation systems and has been investigated extensively [6, 7, 8]. In contrast, no studies {{have looked at the}} interface between the half pin and frame assembly. Loss of stability here compromises the bone remodelling process through a change in the biomechanics of the construct. In the systems of Ilizarov and Taylor Spatial frames (TSF) external fixation by Smith and Nephew, grub screws are used to secure half pins on Rancho cubes. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate 2 different methods used (grub screw or 10  mm stainless steel <b>hexagonal</b> <b>headed</b> <b>bolt</b> [M 6 A 2 - 70]) to secure external fixation half pins to circular frames. This is to determine whether use of bolts is appropriate and could reduce the potential for loosening at this interface.|$|R

Analysis showed that the flange of the collar near the <b>hexagonal</b> <b>head</b> of the <b>bolt</b> had fretting damages. Stress concentration arising from these damages led to premature fatigue crack initiation on the flange and the fatigue crack progressed to about 10 mm depth before it was detected during inspection.

In 1951, Freeman received another patent on an improved <b>head</b> <b>bolt</b> heater. These early heaters replaced one of the engine's cylinder <b>head</b> <b>bolts</b> with a hollow, threaded shank containing a resistive heating element.

Some even shoveled embers underneath their vehicle's engine to obtain the same effect.|$|R
25|$|A third cause {{might be}} {{cracks in the}} engine block from {{overtightening}} the <b>head</b> <b>bolts.</b> Some engines developed cracks in the block that would leak coolant and/or oil, sometimes accompanied by broken <b>head</b> <b>bolts</b> directly above the crack.

40|$|A {{prototype}} extractor {{was developed}} for extraction of okra seeds. Studies were conducted on effect of different cylinder speed (5, 6 and 7 m/s), concave clearance (7, 10 and 13 mm), moisture content of okra fruit (12. 3, 15. 8 and 18. 8 % db) and type of extraction drum at a feed rate of 70 kg/h on machine performance and seed quality. Three types of extractor drums namely; square <b>head</b> <b>bolted,</b> rubberized and rasp-bar were used. Seed quality was evaluated for vigour index, dead seed, normal and abnormal germination. The performance of seed extractor was evaluated for its extraction efficiency, cleaning efficiency, seed loss and energy consumption at different crop and machine variables. Extraction efficiency (99. 3 %) caused by square <b>head</b> <b>bolted</b> drum was found highest among all the three extraction mechanisms. Cleaning efficiency {{was found in the}} range of 97. 9 to 99. 6 % for all crop variables. The value of seed loss (4. 7 %) was low with the square <b>head</b> <b>bolted</b> drum in comparison to rasp-bar and rubberized extraction mechanism.

Higher germination was found with square <b>head</b> <b>bolted</b> drum as compared to the rasp-bar and rubberized drum. The germination decreased, whereas dead seed percentage increased with cylinder speed. The best seed quality machine performance was found at 12. 3 percent moisture content (d. b.), 7 mm concave clearance and 5 m/s cylinder speed with the square <b>head</b> <b>bolted</b> drum extraction mechanism...|$|R

50|$|The numbers {{stamped on}} the <b>head</b> of the <b>bolt</b> are {{referred}} to the grade of the bolt used in certain application with {{the strength of a}} bolt. High-strength steel bolts usually have a <b>hexagonal</b> <b>head</b> with an ISO strength rating (called property class) stamped on the head. And the absence of marking/number indicates a lower grade bolt with low strength. The property classes most often used are 5.8, 8.8, and 10.9. The number before the point is the ultimate tensile strength in MPa divided by 100. The number after the point is the multiplier ratio of yield strength to ultimate tensile strength. For example, a property class 5.8 bolt has a nominal (minimum) ultimate tensile strength of 500 MPa, and a tensile yield strength of 0.8 times ultimate tensile strength or 0.8(500) = 400 MPa.|$|R

50|$|GM ceased {{production}} of the Northstar series in July 2010, with the final cars to receive it, the Cadillac DTS, Buick Lucerne, and Cadillac STS, rolling off the line in 2011. Newer Cadillac V8 models like the CTS-V use the GM LS small-block OHV engine, marking {{a return to a}} simpler push rod engine design. The North star has been plagued from the beginning with reliability issues, particularly head gaskets that fail when <b>head</b> <b>bolts</b> pull out of the block, allowing coolant to seep into the oil system. To exacerbate the situation, the entire engine must be completely removed to replace the head gasket, and a solution implemented to repair the <b>head</b> <b>bolts.</b> The cost to repair is usually upwards of $3000, and involves adding inserts (Normserts, timeserts) in the block to better grip the bolts. The LC3 supercharged variant, with its sealed deck design, has been largely immune from these issues. Cadillac implemented design changes throughout the Northstar's run (particularly 2000 and 2004), lengthening the <b>head</b> <b>bolts</b> and making the threads coarser, but even the 2004+ engines have experienced head gasket failures. The only way to bulletproof the engine is to tap deeper, drill extremely coarse threads, and stud the head to the block.|$|R
