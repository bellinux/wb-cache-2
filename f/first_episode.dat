5|$|After Stuart Urban {{left the}} {{production}} and the decision {{had been made to}} re-shoot some of the material that he had completed with Pedr James directing, producer Charles Pattinson suggested to Peter Flannery that the <b>first</b> <b>episode</b> should not simply be remade, but also rewritten.
