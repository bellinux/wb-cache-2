Delors and his team are also considered as the [...] "founding fathers of the euro". The International Herald Tribune noted the work of Delors {{at the end of}} his second term in 1992: [...] "Mr. Delors rescued the European Community from the doldrums. He arrived when <b>Europessimism</b> was at its worst. Although he was a little-known former French finance minister, he breathed life and hope into the EC and into the dispirited Brussels Commission. In his first term, from 1985 to 1988, he rallied Europe to the call of the single market, and when appointed to a second term he began urging Europeans toward the far more ambitious goals of economic, monetary and political union".|$|E

40|$|This article {{argues that}} pessimistic {{analyses}} of integration constitute a distinct category of critique separate from euro-scepticism or the democratic deficit literature. Drawing on an interdisciplinary analysis of law, political science, and international relations theory, three strands of <b>europessimism</b> are identified: realist, federalist, and social-democratic. The {{analysis of these}} varieties examines how the grounds for <b>europessimism</b> differ and how these {{can be applied to}} understand the causes and consequences of the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis. This application reveals how <b>europessimism</b> finds its vindication whilst also exposing evolution in how pessimistic each analytical tradition is. Indeed, whereas realism has never been optimistic about integration the article shows how federalism and social democracy are associated with optimistic or transformative visions of integration. Yet, the analysis concludes by showing the increasing pessimism of the social democratic tradition alongside the enduring optimism of federalism. By extension, the conceptual analysis of <b>europessimism</b> promises to have applications for the study of other research questions in European integration...|$|E
40|$|European Community (EC) {{economy was}} {{adversely}} affected by the first oil crisis. Following wage explosion in the early 1970 s, energy cost extraordinarily arose. This consequence was 1974 / 75 worldwide recession. The inflationary crisis and stagflation became the general phenomena in the capitalist world. Particularly, EC economy apparently worsened due to wage-price spiral. EC economy could not elastically absorb the rapid rise of production costs in supply side. The new technological innovation eminently slowed down in contrast to Japanese economy. <b>Europessimism</b> prevailed and import penetration pressure strengthened. The comparative disadvantage in high-tech sectors {{and the risk of}} de-industrialization came to be evident. Therefore, in order to this trap, single market initiative is proposed. The transition to the higher economic integration becomes real because of the repeated historical decline of European economy. The 1992 market integration is implemented. One market inevitably needs 2 ̆ 7 one money 2 ̆ 7. This is the 1999 monetary integration. The economic integration reaches its extreme form. 欧文抄録: p. 17...|$|E
40|$|The {{discourse}} of the European Union is undergoing remarkable changes that also find reflection in new communicative practices at institutional level. Against a background of widespread <b>Europessimism</b> and deficit in perceived legitimacy, these changes mainly result from the need to promote EU values and identity more effectively, while prompting civic participation and popular endorsement. In this respect, the EUROPA website represents a node of interaction between citizens and institutions and a constitutive element in fuelling public consensus and (re) building {{a sense of belonging}} to the EU. Through the lens of critical discourse analysis and visual semiotics, this study sets off to investigate the discursive construction of the EU as a social actor in instances of symmetrical and asymmetrical interaction with the citizens. A longitudinal analysis of the textual and visual formulations of the EU’s website reveals the emergence of new consensus building strategies, where priority is increasingly placed on the practical achievements reached by the EU and on the ensuing rights and benefits that are granted to its citizens...|$|E
