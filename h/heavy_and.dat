5|$|Prior to the war, the {{artillery}} worked independently and {{was taught to}} support the infantry {{to ensure a successful}} attack. In 1914, the heaviest artillery gun was the 60-pounder, four in each heavy battery. The Royal Horse Artillery employed the 13-pounder, while the Royal Field Artillery used the 18-pounder gun. By 1918, the situation had changed; {{the artillery}} were the dominant force on the battlefield. Between 1914 and 1918, the Royal Field Artillery had increased from 45 field brigades to 173 field brigades, while the <b>heavy</b> <b>and</b> siege artillery of the Royal Garrison Artillery had increased from 32 <b>heavy</b> <b>and</b> six siege batteries to 117 <b>heavy</b> <b>and</b> 401 siege batteries.|$|E

5|$|During this period, an army {{formation}} of around 5,000 men (of both <b>heavy</b> <b>and</b> light infantry) {{was known as}} a legion. The manipular army was based upon social class, age and military experience. Maniples were units of 120 men each drawn from a single infantry class.|$|E

5|$|The mosque's {{interior}} {{is supported by}} 45 columns, 33 of which are white marble and 12 of stone. The column rows of the central aisles are <b>heavy</b> <b>and</b> stunted. The remaining four rows are better proportioned. The capitals of the columns are of four different kinds: those in the central aisle are <b>heavy</b> <b>and</b> primitively designed, while those under the dome are of the Corinthian order, and made from Italian white marble. The capitals in the eastern aisle are of a heavy basket-shaped design and those east and west of the dome are also basket-shaped, but smaller and better proportioned. The columns and piers are connected by an architectural rave, which consists of beams of roughly squared timber enclosed in a wooden casing.|$|E

5|$|Auxiliary uniform, armour, {{weapons and}} {{equipment}} were probably standardised {{by the end}} of the Julio-Claudian period. Auxiliary equipment was broadly similar to that of the legions (see Section 2.1 below for possible differences in armour). By 68AD, there was little difference between most auxiliary infantry and their legionary counterparts in equipment, training and fighting capability. The main difference was that auxilia contained combat cavalry, both <b>heavy</b> <b>and</b> light, and other specialized units that legions lacked.|$|E

5|$|England {{is highly}} industrialised, {{but since the}} 1970s {{there has been a}} decline in {{traditional}} <b>heavy</b> <b>and</b> manufacturing industries, and an increasing emphasis on a more service industry oriented economy. Tourism has become a significant industry, attracting millions of visitors to England each year. The export part of the economy is dominated by pharmaceuticals, cars (although many English marques are now foreign-owned, such as Land Rover, Lotus, Jaguar and Bentley), crude oil and petroleum from the English parts of North Sea oil along with Wytch Farm, aircraft engines and alcoholic beverages.|$|E
5|$|Fighting was <b>heavy</b> <b>and</b> the {{two sides}} fought to capture and {{recapture}} P'ohang-dong and An'gang-ni, with the North Koreans seeking {{to break through the}} Kyongju corridor as a way to attack the UN base at Pusan.

5|$|Following {{activation}} with antigen, B cells {{begin to}} proliferate rapidly. In these rapidly dividing cells, the genes encoding the variable domains of the <b>heavy</b> <b>and</b> light chains undergo {{a high rate}} of point mutation, by a process called somatic hypermutation (SHM). SHM results in approximately one nucleotide change per variable gene, per cell division. As a consequence, any daughter B cells will acquire slight amino acid differences in the variable domains of their antibody chains.|$|E
