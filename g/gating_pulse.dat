40|$|Under both {{static and}} common MAS {{conditions}} (< 15 kHz) {{the question of}} residual X-Y heteronuclear decoupling can become a complicating factor {{in the analysis of}} various NMR results. In our lab the impact of {sup 31 }P-{sup 23 }Na dipolar coupling on the observed {sup 23 }Na M{sub 2 } relaxation for a series of sodium phosphate glasses was recently investigated by employing continuous wave {sup 31 }P decoupling during the entire pulse sequence.

50|$|The Wilkinson ADC was {{designed}} by D. H. Wilkinson in 1950. The Wilkinson ADC {{is based on the}} comparison of an input voltage with that produced by a charging capacitor. The capacitor is allowed to charge until its voltage is equal to the amplitude of the input pulse (a comparator determines when this condition has been reached). Then, the capacitor is allowed to discharge linearly, which produces a ramp voltage. At the point when the capacitor begins to discharge, a <b>gate</b> <b>pulse</b> is initiated. The <b>gate</b> <b>pulse</b> remains on until the capacitor is completely discharged. Thus the duration of the <b>gate</b> <b>pulse</b> is directly proportional to the amplitude of the input <b>pulse.</b> This <b>gate</b> <b>pulse</b> operates a linear <b>gate</b> which receives <b>pulses</b> from a high-frequency oscillator clock. While the gate is open, a discrete number of clock pulses pass through the linear gate and are counted by the address register. The time the linear gate is open is proportional to the amplitude of the input pulse, thus the number of clock pulses recorded in the address register is proportional also. Alternatively, the charging of the capacitor could be monitored, rather than the discharge.|$|R

For the DP-TROG geometry, we show that measurements of the autocorrelation trace of the pulse after propagation through a medium with variable dispersion together with a single measurement of its intensity spectrum contain sufficient information to reconstruct the pulse in amplitude and phase. Pulse reconstruction for this DP-TROG geometry works very well even for the case of a nonlinearly chirped double pulse.

40|$|Information {{transmission}} {{is a key}} element for information processing in the brain. A number of mechanisms have been proposed for transferring volleys of spikes between layers of a feedforward neural circuit. Many of these mechanisms use synchronous activity to provide windows in time when spikes may be transferred more easily from layer to layer. Recently, we have demonstrated that a pulse-gating mechanism can transfer graded information between layers in a feedforward neuronal network. Our transfer mechanism resulted in a time-translationally invariant firing rate and synaptic current waveforms of arbitrary amplitude, thus providing exact, graded information transfer between layers. In this paper, we apply a Fokker-Planck approach to understand how this translational invariance manifests itself in a high-dimensional, non-linear feedforward integrate-and-fire network. We show that there is good correspondence in spiking probabilities between the Fokker-Planck solutions and our previous mean-field solutions.

In the usual arrangement, an off-axis <b>gating</b> <b>pulse</b> induces birefringence {{in a medium}} exhibiting a strong Kerr response (commonly carbon disulfide) which {{is followed by a}} polarizer aligned to fully attenuate the on-axis imaging beam. By properly timing the gate pulse, imaging light experiences a polarization change allowing time-dependent transmission through the polarizer to form an ultrashort image. The crossed-beam system is effective in generating short gate times, however, signal transmission through the system is complicated by the crossing angle of the gate and imaging beams. This work presents a robust ultrafast time-gated imaging scheme based on a combination of type-I frequency doubling and a collinear optical arrangement in carbon disulfide.
