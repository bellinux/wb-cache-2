5|$|The 1982-dated issues {{banknotes}} differed {{little from}} the earlier, {{except that it}} took into account of the renaming of the country's capital from Salisbury to <b>Harare.</b> However, there was an error with early runs of the $10 banknote (Pick no. 3b), because it bears Salisbury as {{the name of the}} capital city instead of <b>Harare.</b> These type of issues are rare. Later runs of the $10 note (Pick no. 3c) corrected the error. There were no $2 banknotes dated 1982: the second run of this denomination was taken in 1983 with K. Moyana as governor of the Reserve Bank.|$|E
5|$|Across the country, {{statues of}} Cecil Rhodes were removed and squares and roads named after {{prominent}} colonial figures were renamed after black nationalists. In 1982 Salisbury was renamed <b>Harare.</b> Mugabe employed North Korean architects to design Heroes' Acre, a monument and complex in western <b>Harare</b> {{to commemorate the}} struggle against minority rule. Zimbabwe also received much aid from Western countries, whose governments hoped that a stable and prosperous Zimbabwe would aid the transition of South Africa away from apartheid and minority rule. The United States provided Zimbabwe with a $25 million three-year aid package. The UK financed a land reform program, and provided military advisers to aid {{the integration of the}} guerrilla armies and old Rhodesian security forces into a new Zimbabwean military. Members of both ZANLA and ZIPRA were integrated into the army, although there remained a strong rivalry between the two groups. As President, Mugabe retained Walls {{as the head of the}} armed forces.|$|E

5|$|Having {{made his}} One Day International (ODI) debut in October 1998 against Zimbabwe at the <b>Harare</b> Sports Club, Shoaib's first five-wicket haul came against New Zealand in 2001, a match Pakistan won at the Eden Park, Auckland. His best bowling {{performance}} in ODIs was 6 wickets for 16 runs against New Zealand at the National Stadium, Karachi, in December 2001. Shoaib played 19 Twenty20 Internationals for Pakistan, however {{he never took}} a five-wicket haul in this format. He retired from international cricket after the 2011 Cricket World Cup.

This included a haul of 3/34 and then a score of 50 as India collapsed to 164 all out and a 51-run loss to New Zealand. In another match, he took his ODI career best of 5/27 against Zimbabwe in <b>Harare</b> as the hosts fell for 65. Despite his overall good form, Pathan was punished by the New Zealanders in the final, conceding 40 runs in five wicketless overs as India lost their second successive final. He was subsequently the leading wicket-taker as India took a 2â€“0 clean sweep of an away Test series against Zimbabwe. In the First Test in Bulawayo, Pathan took 5/58 and 4/53 as well as scoring 52 in {{a man of the}} match performance to help India to an innings victory. He followed this with a 7/59 haul, his Test career best innings haul, and 5/67 in the final Test in <b>Harare,</b> his second ten-wicket match haul to set up a ten wicket victory, having also scored 32 in the first innings. He was again named man of the match, and his 21 wickets at 11.29 runs saw him named man of the series. This made him only the third bowler after Anil Kumble and Johnny Briggs to take 21 wickets in a two-match series.|$|E
5|$|Insect {{attributes}} {{are sometimes}} mimicked in architecture, {{as at the}} Eastgate Centre, <b>Harare,</b> which uses passive cooling, storing heat {{in the morning and}} releasing it in the warm parts of the day. The target of this piece of biomimicry is the structure of the mounds of termites such as Macrotermes michaelseni which effectively cool the nests of these social insects. The properties of the Namib desert beetle's exoskeleton, in particular its wing-cases (elytra) which have bumps with hydrophilic (water-attracting) tips and hydrophobic (water-shedding) sides, have been mimicked in a film coating designed for the British Ministry of Defence, to capture water in arid regions.|$|E

5|$|The Chiremba Balancing Rocks near <b>Harare</b> is {{the main}} artwork used for obverse sides {{of the first two}} {{banknote}} designs of the first Zimbabwean dollar. Notes of these design also feature on either side major landmarks and landscapes such as the Kariba Dam and fauna. As hyperinflation took hold {{at the end of the}} 20th century the quality of the notes deteriorated as printing plates from previous issues were reconstituted for printing emergency notes. Although the notes of the first design were gradually phased out from 1997, all remaining notes of the first dollar were forcibly demonetised on 22 August 2006.|$|E
5|$|The Desmond Crough {{series was}} the first series of {{banknotes}} for Zimbabwe, which carried the signature of Dr. Desmond C. Crough, then the last governor of the Reserve Bank of Rhodesia. They are dated 1980 but issued in 1981 (except for the $20 note, which was issued in 1982). The notes bear Salisbury as the name of its capital rather than <b>Harare,</b> as the name was changed on 18 April 1982. There are four denominations in this series: $2, $5, $10 and $20; its designs make extensive use of the GuillochÃ© technique, heavily relied upon by banknotes of many currencies during the 1980s.|$|E

During the series, Kohli became the fastest Indian batsman to reach 1,000 runs in ODI cricket. He made his T20I debut against Zimbabwe at <b>Harare</b> and scored an unbeaten 26. Later that month, Kohli batted at 3 in a full-strength Indian team throughout the 2010 Asia Cup and scored a total of 67 runs {{at an average of}} 16.75.

5|$|The king cheetah is {{a variety}} of cheetah with a rare {{mutation}} for cream-coloured fur marked with large, blotchy spots and three dark, wide stripes extending from their neck to the tail. In 1926 Major A.Cooper wrote about an animal he had shot near modern-day <b>Harare.</b> Describing the animal, he noted its remarkable similarity to the cheetah, but the body of this individual was covered with fur as thick {{as that of a}} snow leopard and the spots merged to form stripes. He suggested that it could be a cross between a leopard and a cheetah. After further similar animals were discovered, it was established they were similar to the cheetah in having non-retractable clawsa characteristic feature of the cheetah.|$|E
50|$|As {{the scope}} of the CHOGM has {{expanded}} beyond the meetings of the heads of governments themselves, the CHOGMs have become progressively shorter, and their business compacted into less time. The 1971 CHOGM lasted for nine days, and the 1977 and 1991 CHOGMs for seven days each. However, <b>Harare's</b> epochal CHOGM was the last to last a week; the 1993 CHOGM lasted for five days, and the contentious 1995 CHOGM for only three-and-a-half. The 2005 and subsequent conferences were held over two-and-a-half days.|$|R
30|$|The {{spread of}} the fast-growing water {{hyacinth}} weed in <b>Harareâ€™s</b> Lake Chivero and other open water sources is threatening the capital cityâ€™s main water supply. Environmentalists blame the {{spread of the}} weed on the discharge of effluent, particularly raw sewage, into the Lake and its tributaries. The weed has spread, to many other water bodies throughout Zimbabwe. The plant grows rapidly and produces enormous amounts of biomass. Due to its flat top leaf structure, it covers extensive areas of open waterways.|$|R
50|$|Other notable {{cultural}} {{locations in}} Mbare include the Mai Musodzi Hall, one of <b>Harare's</b> oldest theatres, named after Mai Musodzi, pioneer {{of education for}} women in Zimbabwe. The Mai Musodzi Hall is next to the Mbare Musika, and young adults go there to watch late 1990s action movies. Stodart Hall, Mbare's biggest community centre, hosted Sir Cliff Richard during his tour in the 1960s, and nowadays the recently-upgraded hall hosts DJ parties and club nights. The hall is also used for film screenings and {{as a place of}} last vigil for deceased national heroes.|$|R
