40|$|Abstract. A major {{fraction}} of fine particle matter consists of organic carbon (OC) but its origin is still inadequately known. In this study {{the sources of}} OC were investigated in the northern European urban environment in Helsinki, Fin-land. Measurements were carried out over one year and they included both filter (PM 1) and online methods. From the fil-ter samples OC, elemental carbon (EC), water-soluble OC (WSOC), levoglucosan and major ions were analyzed. Filter data together with the concentrations of inorganic gases were analyzed by Positive matrix factorization (PMF) {{in order to find}} the sources of OC (and WSOC) on an annual as well as on a seasonal basis.

The comparison was performed over two months (May and June 2010) at a coastal site characterized by low local pollution, located in the Southern Italy (Central Mediterranean basin). The online measurements of the above inorganic ions and carbonaceous components of the aerosols were carried out using an Ambient <b>Ion</b> Monitor-Ion <b>Chromatograph</b> (AIM IC URG 9000 -D) and a Sunset Laboratory Model- 4 Semi-Continuous OCEC Field Analyzer, respectively, while the offline analyses were performed with two <b>ion</b> <b>chromatographs</b> instruments (Dionex DX- 120 and Dionex 500) and a Sunset Laboratory Dual-Optical Carbonaceous Analyzer (Sunset Laboratory). The collocation of instruments allowed to evaluate the differences between online and offline daily concentrations and to interpret the origin {{of positive and negative}} sampling artefacts. As an example, the offline OC concentrations are constantly higher than online concentrations and this is explained by positive artefacts of offline measurements. The analysis was performed separately for days with and without transport of Saharan dust and revealed significant enhancement of concentrations for both inorganic ions and carbonaceous aerosols in the presence of dust. The increase of EC concentrations during dust events may be explained by an increase of emissions transport from sea traffic to the site. Moreover, the results showed that the online instruments may be used at a low polluted site for the acquisition of high temporal resolution data...|$|R

The sampling campaign, which lasted from 1 July to 14 August 2004, centered over the eastern United States and Canada and showed that sulfate was the dominant inorganic species measured. The highest sulfate concentrations were observed at altitudes below 2 km, and back trajectory analyses showed a distinct difference between air masses that had or had not intercepted the Ohio River valley (ORV) region. Air masses encountered below 2 km with a history over the ORV had sulfate concentrations that were higher by a factor of 3. 2 and total sulfur (S) concentrations higher by 2. 5. The study’s highest sulfate concentrations were found in these air masses. The sulfur of the ORV air masses was also more processed with a mean sulfate to total sulfur molar ratio of 0. 5 compared to 0. 3 in non-ORV measurements.

The concentrations of major water-soluble ions and WSOC were measured by the PILS-TOC-IC system from 25 April to 28 May 2009.

The WSPOM contributed on average 51 % to particulate organic matter (POM) measured with the AMS. The correlation between the data of all the online measurement devices (AMS, PILS-TOC-IC, semicontinuous EC/OC carbon analyzer and TEOM) was excellent.

40|$|Particle in-situ pH (pHIS), {{defined as}} pH of the aqueous phase on aerosols, is an {{important}} factor in influencing aerosol-phase chemistry and uptake of gaseous species by particles. In this study, a continuous system, Particle-into-Liquid System (PILS) coupled with two <b>ion</b> <b>chromatographs,</b> was used to obtain PM 2. 5 ionic chemical composition at a time resolution of 30 min at a suburban site in Hong Kong under three different synoptic conditions. The chemical composition data and meteorological parameters (e. g., temperature, relative humidity (RH)) are input into Aerosol Inorganic Model (AIM-III) for estimation of in-situ pH through calculation of H+ amount and aerosol liquid water content (LWC). The particle pHIS ranged from - 1. 87 to 3. 12, with an average at - 0. 03, indicating the PM 2. 5 particles in Hong Kong are highly acidic. Unlike particle strong acidity, which was dominated by sulfate concentration, the amount of aerosol liquid water content could significantly influence in-situ particle acidity. Principal factor analysis has identified the equivalent concentration ratio between cations and anions (i. e., R+/-) and RH to be the two most important factors influencing the particle pHIS. pHIS under different synoptic conditions in this study could be well approximated by a single linear regression equation (slope: 0. 95, R 2 : 0. 93), i. e., pHIS = 4. 94 R+/- + 3. 11 RH - 5. 70.

Muscle was obtained from a rat infused with stable-isotope-labeled leucine. The muscle was homogenized, b-F 1 -ATPase immunoprecipitated, and the protein was resolved using 1 D-SDS PAGE. Following trypsin digestion of the isolated protein, the resultant peptide mixtures were subjected to analysis by HPLC-ESI-MS/MS, which resulted in the detection of multiple b-F 1 -ATPase peptides. There were three b-F 1 -ATPase unique peptides with a leucine residue in the amino acid sequence, and which were detected with high intensity relative to other peptides and assigned with. 95 % probability to b-F 1 -ATPase. These peptides were specifically targeted for fragmentation to access their stable-isotope enrichment based on MS/MS peak areas calculated from extracted <b>ion</b> <b>chromatographs</b> for selected labeled and unlabeled fragment ions.

In this study, the concentration of organic nitrogen (ON) and major inorganic ions in PM 2. 5 aerosol were measured at the Duke Forest Research Facility near Chapel Hill, NC, during January and June of 2007. A novel on-line instrument was used, which is based on the Steam Jet Aerosol Collector (SJAC) coupled to an on-line total carbon/total nitrogen analyzer and two on-line <b>ion</b> <b>chromatographs.</b> The concentration of ON was determined by tracking the difference in concentrations of total nitrogen and of inorganic nitrogen (determined as the sum of N-ammonium and N-nitrate). The time resolution of the instrument was 30 min with a detection limit for major aerosol components of ~ 0. 1 μg m − 3. Nitrogen in organic compounds contributed ~ 33 % on average to the total nitrogen concentration in PM 2. 5, illustrating the importance of this aerosol component. Absolute concentrations of ON, however, were relatively low (< 1. 0 μg m − 3) with an average of 0. 16 μg m − 3. The absolute and relative contribution of ON to the total aerosol nitrogen budget was practically the same in January and June. In January, the concentration of ON tended to be higher during the night and early morning, while in June it tended to be higher during the late afternoon and evening. Back-trajectories and correlation with wind direction indicate that higher concentrations of ON occur in air masses originating over the continental US, while marine air masses are characterized by lower ON concentrations.
