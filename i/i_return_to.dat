500|$|In September 2006, Langan made {{a low-key}} {{departure}} from Granada {{to take up}} a position as an executive producer with BBC Films. Although approached to join BBC Films some years before, only in 2007 did she feel it was the time to [...] "concentrate more exclusively on film". She immediately began overseeing editing work on The Other Boleyn Girl, which was already in post-production. She also began developing The Damned United, a film based on David Peace's novel that fictionalised the 44 days Brian Clough managed Leeds United F.C. in 1974. The film was adapted by Peter Morgan, executive produced by Andy Harries, and starred Michael Sheen as Clough. On why she continues to work with the same people on her projects, Langan said, [...] "The reason <b>I</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> working with the same people is that you have invested time, energy and thought and care into these relationships and that can pay dividends—The Queen is an example of those relationships paying dividends".|$|E

500|$|The game's title {{went through}} {{multiple}} revisions during development, with Nintendo producer Hitoshi Yamagami {{saying that he}} went through discussions with Yamakura about ten times and Yamakura stated that about five thousand titles had been suggested. The Japanese subtitle, [...] "Until <b>I</b> <b>Return</b> <b>To</b> Your Side", was proposed and approved at a fairly early stage. The final title was only decided {{two months before the}} mastering process began. The Oraclos Chain was present in early concepts as a means of contrasting with Elena's feminine image, and was born as a gameplay device from discussions on how to best create an action-based experience with limited controls. Alongside this, the team wanted to make the game suitable for gamers not comfortable with action games, so upgrades and equipment repair were added. The boss battles were designed to make players pull on all their available resources, creating puzzles that would leave players satisfied upon completion. No original music was created for the game, with it instead using samples from western classical music that fitted the concept. While original music was considered, it was dropped as staff felt it would be [...] "too powerful" [...] for an overseas audience.|$|E

On the day the demolition began, the commission's chairman, Amanbek Mukhashev, told Forum 18, [...] "I know nothing about the demolition of the Hare Krishna homes – I'm on holiday." [...] He added, [...] "As soon as <b>I</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> work {{at the beginning of}} December we will officially announce the results of the Commission's investigation."

[...] My principal comforters at such times are Handel and the Bachs and those few great men of our own day who, taking these as their masters, follow resolutely in the same quest for greatness and truth.|$|E

2500|$|Wen was [...] "discovered" [...] by then-general {{secretary}} Hu Yaobang, {{and joined}} the ranks of the Central Committee and Politburo. There was some public speculation after 1989 over whether Wen was closer to Hu Yaobang or Zhao Ziyang, but Wen implicitly confirmed that he was a protégé of Hu by the release of his 2010 article, [...] "Recalling Hu Yaobang when <b>I</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> Xingyi". After Wen was promoted to work in Beijing, he served as Chief of the Party's General Affairs Office, an organ that oversaw day-to-day operations of the party's leaders. He remained in the post for eight years.|$|E
2500|$|Resigning {{from the}} National Hospital in 1892, Rivers {{travelled}} to Jena {{to expand his}} knowledge of experimental psychology. Whilst in Jena, Rivers became fluent in German and attended lectures, not only on psychology but on philosophy as well. He also became deeply immersed in the culture; in a diary he kept of the journey he comments on the buildings, the picture galleries, the church services, and the education system, showing his wide interests and critical judgement. In this diary he also wrote that: [...] "I have {{during the last three}} weeks {{come to the conclusion that}} I should go in for insanity when <b>I</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> England and work as much as possible at psychology." ...|$|E

Both Garbo and Stiller arrived in New York in July 1925 after a 10-day trip on the SS Drottningholm. But they {{remained}} in New York for more than six months without any word from MGM. They decided to travel to Los Angeles on their own, but another five weeks passed with no contact from the studio. On the verge of returning to Sweden, she wrote to her boyfriend back home: [...] "You're quite right when you think I don't feel at home here… Oh you lovely little Sweden, I promise that when <b>I</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> you my sad face will smile as never before." ...|$|E

2500|$|On April 2010 (the 21st {{anniversary of}} Hu's death), Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao {{wrote an article}} in the People's Daily titled [...] "Recalling Hu Yaobang when <b>I</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> Xingyi". Presented as an essay, it recollected an {{investigation}} of ordinary people's lives by Hu Yaobang and Wen Jiabao in Xingyi County, Guizhou, in 1986. Wen, who worked with Hu from 1985 to 1987, praised Hu's [...] "superior working style of being totally devoted to the suffering of the masses", and his [...] "lofty morality and openness [...] ". Wen's essay elicited an enthusiastic reaction in Chinese-language websites, generating over 20,000 responses on Sina.com on the day the article appeared. The article was interpreted by observers familiar with the Chinese political system as a confirmation by Wen that he was a protege of Hu, rather than Zhao Ziyang.|$|E
2500|$|They can, at any moment, {{have peace}} simply by laying {{down their arms}} and {{submitting}} to the national authority under the Constitution[...] [...] [...] If questions should remain, we would adjust them by the peaceful means of legislation, conference, courts, and votes, operating only in constitutional and lawful channels[...] [...] [...] In presenting the abandonment of armed resistance to the national authority {{on the part of}} the insurgents, as the only indispensable condition to ending the war {{on the part of the}} government, I retract nothing heretofore said as to slavery. I repeat the declaration made a year ago, that [...] "while I remain in my present position I shall not attempt to retract or modify the emancipation proclamation, nor shall <b>I</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> slavery any person who is free by the terms of that proclamation, or by any of the Acts of Congress.|$|E
2500|$|Responding to such {{criticism}} Popović said in early 1994: [...] "Well, I'm a lawyer, so technically yes, I am committing {{an act of}} treason under Serbian laws. But I distinguish between {{the interests of the}} Serbian state and the Serbian people and I think these interests are opposed at this moment. The military defeat of the Milošević government {{is in the best interest}} of the Serbian people. It is something that every good Serbian patriot should wish for. I don't think I betrayed my people". Pressed further to clarify his position on the ramifications of such an act such as an implication that a violent foreign intervention can solve certain political problems, like the problem of an armed Serb secession from Bosnia-Herzegovina, or from Croatia, as well as his position on the inevitable civilian death toll if such an action is to occur, Popović said: [...] "I think that's an unfair question. If I see somebody trying to murder somebody else, of course my duty is to try to stop him. I'm not saying that by doing so and applying violence to the situation, I'm actually trying to help those people lead a good life. I don't know what they will do once they leave the scene. What I see Serbs doing in Bosnia is committing an act of aggression against a state that has been recognized by United Nations, and I see them committing genocide. I think that both of these things should be stopped. Of course, stopping it would not solve the problem of how these people will live next to each other in the future, but first you have to stop the crimes. The international community has an obligation to do so, under the Genocide Convention and the United Nations Charter. They have an obligation to use force to stop aggression, and to stop genocide. In any armed conflict there will be civilian casualties. Unfortunately, that's something that can't be avoided. But I don't think that this fact should prevent the international community from doing what they are obliged to do under the international law: stopping the aggression, stopping the genocide. It sounds nice to advocate peaceful means, but it is not realistic. <b>I</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> this parallel: If you see some big guy beating a kid in the street, it would be very good if you could go to him and say 'Please stop this, you shouldn't be doing this, it is uncivilized. This poor guy cannot defend himself.' No, if that doesn't work, you call the police, who have to use violence. At this point in history you have to revert to violence to stop crime." [...] Asked whether he signed the particular petition because of the circumstances rather than principally thinking that such measures solve problems, Popović said: [...] "I'll go even further. I signed this document knowing perfectly well that this will never happen. I did it as a gesture to show that I realized who's the main culprit in the Yugoslav conflict. And I wanted to express my opinion that this government would deserve it, even though it will never happen".|$|E
