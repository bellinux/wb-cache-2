5|$|May is 13, but {{she knows}} nothing, is unable to talk fluently, nor walk with ease due to for her bandy legs. Her father is dead and she has four elder brothers, all mentally retarded... The {{students}} are all disabled, retarded and of different ages. Teaching them is a hard job. They are of the 3rd grade {{but many of them}} find it <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the reading. Only a few of them can. Their pronunciation is distorted due to their twisted lips and their memory is quite short. They easily forget what they've learned... In the Village, it is quite hard to tell the kids' exact ages. Some in their twenties have a physical statures as small as the 7- or 8-years-old. They find it difficult to feed themselves, much less have mental ability or physical capacity for work. No one can hold back the tears when seeing the heads turning round unconsciously, the bandy arms managing to push the spoon of food into the mouths with awful difficulty... Yet they still keep smiling, singing in their great innocence, at the presence of some visitors, craving for something beautiful.|$|E

25|$|Gagné {{acknowledged}} {{that he has been}} looked to as a role model, and called himself an example of what one should not do. On the other hand, when asked whether he had given an honest performance to Dodgers fans, he maintained that he had always worked <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so.|$|E

25|$|Diabetic {{retinopathy}} {{often has}} no early warning signs. Even macular edema, {{which can cause}} rapid vision loss, may not have any warning signs for some time. In general, however, a person with macular edema {{is likely to have}} blurred vision, making it <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> things like read or drive. In some cases, the vision will get better or worse during the day.|$|E
25|$|In system {{programming}}, often limited programming {{facilities are}} available. The use of automatic garbage collection is not common and debugging is sometimes <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> The runtime library, if available at all, is usually far less powerful, and does less error checking. Because of those limitations, monitoring and logging are often used; operating systems may have extremely elaborate logging subsystems.|$|E
25|$|Airbrushes are {{commonly}} used by scale modeling enthusiasts because finer coats can be laid down, as well as opaque effects, like weathering, adding stains etc. The fine atomization of paint in modern airbrushes also {{makes it possible to}} accurately reproduce soft-edged mottled camouflage schemes, which are very <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> convincingly by hand-brushing (Luftwaffe aircraft are a good example of this).|$|E
6000|$|... "I think," [...] said Ida, [...] "I could {{forgive you}} for one offense--the one {{you seem to}} think most important--rather easily. It would have been ever so much <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that had you gone away without telling me." ...|$|R
5000|$|This type of {{assembly}} {{has been achieved}} before using DNA, but {{it has always been}} assumed that it would be much <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this with proteins because there is no straightforward code that relates sequence to structure, as there is with DNA.|$|R
50|$|Mignola {{has stated}} {{that this is one}} of his {{favorite}} Hellboy stories but it was one of the <b>hardest</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> as it was a very close adaptation of a Japanese folktale that he wanted to have an authentic feel despite knowing nothing about the country.|$|R
25|$|A {{shoulder}} separation occurs {{where the}} collarbone (clavicle) meets the shoulder blade (scapula). When ligaments {{that hold the}} AC (acromioclavicular) joint together are partially or completely torn, the outer end of the clavicle may slip out of place, preventing it from properly meeting the scapula. Most often the injury {{is caused by a}} blow to the shoulder or by falling on an outstretched hand. After injury it is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a 180 degrees rotation.|$|E
25|$|Although Artemis tried {{diligently}} {{to distinguish}} herself from her predecessor in both New York City and Boston, this {{proved to be}} rather <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Her approach to various situations were often seen as more violent than beneficial. Because of this, and due to Man's World's respect of Diana, Artemis often would receive the cold shoulder from those she tried to help, extending even to her brief time in the Justice League. Superman once commented to Diana that Batman refused to allow Artemis to sit in Diana's chair during Justice League meetings. Diana's twin sister Donna Troy even showed resentment toward Artemis carrying the Wonder Woman title, which caused their first meeting to escalate into a heated argument.|$|E
500|$|Cleveland's health {{had been}} declining for several years, {{and in the}} autumn of 1907 he fell seriously ill. In 1908, he {{suffered}} a heart attack and died on June 24 at age 71. His last words were, [...] "I have tried so <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> right." [...] He is buried in the Princeton Cemetery of the Nassau Presbyterian Church.|$|E

50|$|He was a sumo wrestler {{under the}} shikona Kinomura, a direct {{modification}} of his surname. He {{had taken up}} sumo to build his body for Western-style professional wrestling, thus by 1964 he decided to quit, considering {{that it would be}} <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so the higher up the divisions he went.|$|R
60|$|It is {{my great}} {{ambition}} now {{to catch a}} broadbill. That would completely round out my fishing experience. And I shall try. But I doubt that I will be so fortunate. It takes a long time. Boschen was years catching his fish. Moreover, though it is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> get a broadbill <b>to</b> bite--and <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> hook him--it is infinitely <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> anything with him after you <b>do</b> get fast <b>to</b> him.|$|R
500|$|Garrett Hedlund as Samuel [...] "Sam" [...] Flynn, {{a primary}} {{shareholder}} of ENCOM who, while investigating his father's disappearance, is transported onto the Grid himself. Hedlund won a [...] "Darwinian casting process" [...] which tested hundreds of actors, being chosen {{for having the}} [...] "unique combination of intelligence, wit, humor, look and physicality" [...] that the producers were looking for in Flynn's son. The actor trained <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> his own stunts, which included jumping over cars and copious wire and harness work. Owen Best portrays the seven-year-old Sam Flynn.|$|E
500|$|To date, Necrid has {{appeared}} in only one game of the series, Soulcalibur II. He did {{not appear in the}} original arcade version, but was added later when the game was ported to the GameCube, PlayStation 2, and Xbox video game consoles. When asked whether the character would return in Soulcalibur III, Yotoriyama replied, [...] "Necrid has gone on vacation." [...] When the subject came up again during the production of Soulcalibur V, game director Daishi Odashima responded via his Twitter account, “To be honest, that will be too <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> due to copyright issues.” ...|$|E
500|$|Kubrick {{continues}} to be cited as a major influence by many directors, including Christopher Nolan, Todd Field, David Fincher, Guillermo del Toro, David Lynch, Lars von Trier, Tim Burton, Michael Mann, and Gaspar Noé. [...] Many filmmakers imitate Kubrick's inventive and unique use of camera movement and framing, {{as well as his}} use of music, notably Frank Darabont. Paul Thomas Anderson, in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, stated, [...] "it's so <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> anything that doesn't owe some kind of debt to what Stanley Kubrick did with music in movies. Inevitably, you're going to end up doing something that he's probably already done before. It can all seem like we're falling behind whatever he came up with." ...|$|E
50|$|The Parke County Commissioners paid J.J. Daniels $2.25 in 1873 {{to inspect}} the bridge. In 1874 the {{embankment}} was repaired.

50|$|Time Signs {{was created}} in 1988 when {{producer}} Tim Taylor asked Mick Aston to present Time Signs, a history and archaeology series that {{tells the story of}} Wolf Valley in Devon.

500|$|Chaiken also didn't want {{to portray}} Jenny's ordeal in an {{explicit}} manner, confirming this she said: [...] "I am loath to portray rape as a filmmaker. I {{think it is}} really <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it without somehow becoming complicit and exploitative. And so as much as it's important to talk about it, I wanted to be vague and not milk it." [...] Chaiken has also admitted {{that the use of}} dream sequences involving Jenny were not a successful inclusion, but claimed it was necessary to portray Jenny coming to terms with her abuse. Heather Hogan of AfterEllen criticized the storyline because there was no conclusion to it, also stating it was never explored enough, leading everyone to think she was just a jerk.|$|E
500|$|Retrospective critiques {{continue}} {{to praise the}} game's narrative and degree of choice. In 2009, an article in Rock, Paper, Shotgun declared: [...] "The sense of sorrow comes from the realisation that there's nothing like [...] on the horizon... why should there be so few games like this? Oh right, because it's so very <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>do...</b> the lack of games comparable to Bloodlines {{is one of the}} great tragedies of our time." [...] Eurogamer called the game inspirational, with an unmatched level of narrative detail. In 2010, The Escapist called Bloodlines a flawed masterpiece which could have been a genuine masterpiece with more time, money and staff; although great games may inspire awe, it instead created a devoted fan base which continued to develop the game. Bloodlines is considered a cult classic.|$|E
500|$|On 17 April 1910, Wallis was {{confirmed}} at Christ Episcopal Church, Baltimore, and between 1912 and 1914 her uncle Warfield {{paid for her}} to attend Oldfields School, the most expensive girls' school in Maryland. There she became a friend of heiress Renée du Pont, a daughter of Senator T. Coleman du Pont of the du Pont family, and Mary Kirk, whose family founded Kirk Silverware. A fellow pupil at one of Wallis's schools recalled, [...] "She was bright, brighter than all of us. She {{made up her mind}} to go {{to the head of the}} class, and she did." [...] Wallis was always immaculately dressed and pushed herself <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> well. A later biographer wrote of her, [...] "Though Wallis's jaw was too heavy for her to be counted beautiful, her fine violet-blue eyes and petite figure, quick wits, vitality, and capacity for total concentration on her interlocutor ensured that she had many admirers." ...|$|E

5000|$|If you're {{trying to}} feign shock or anger, it's much <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{over a long}} period. People accused of {{something}} they're trying to hide will start out feigning outrage - 'How dare you ask me that?' But that will start to change to objection rather than shock, as it's psychologically very difficult to mimic emotion. Dr Simon Moore ...|$|R

500|$|Wadia {{admitted}} to feeling [...] "emotionally drained" [...] after her scenes with Ace Bhatti. She explained to The People: [...] "It's very draining. I'm putting myself into this very dark place which I know sadly {{is a reality}} for so many women. Zainab's confidence has been steadily eroded. She's feeling isolated and has fallen under Yusef's control. He wants revenge. She is totally in his power. I had to show this can happen to any woman, no matter how strong she seems. Zainab was strong and not naive, but a woman is vulnerable if the man hits the right psychological weak spots. But both Ace and I have found it <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> I've known Ace {{for a long time}} and we're good friends. He has been wonderful to work with on this and very concerned about me all the way through." [...] Wadia has been given advice on the storyline from the Roshni refuge in Birmingham, which specializes in abuse within Asian families.|$|E
500|$|.....that was so hard, it's just, {{and it felt}} strained, and as a result, I'm {{happy that}} I worked <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> those, because those English {{versions}} are really good and [...] "Simple and Clean," [...] I think, {{is a really good}} song, and people- most of the people that know me here, they know me for that- but it's not ideal for me as a writer, to- because, actually, I changed the melodies for [...] "Simple and Clean" [...] and [...] "Hikari," [...] because when you change the language you're singing in, the same melodies don't work- and as a writer, it's just very frustrating to have, like- I wrote these melodies for Japanese words, and to have to write in English for that, it's just not right. And then, so, for this, uh, this contract with Island Def Jam, in the beginning I separated it to this English language album, and I don't do Japanese translations. I just, my integrity as an artist just would not take that, could not take that." ...|$|E
500|$|Due to {{the complex}} {{technology}} used to for the video, Robyn believed [...] "It looked like 'MacGyver' on the set." [...] She said that the video [...] " [...] very much about [...] giving almost a physical experience of {{what it feels like}} to be on a dance floor or fall in love, whether it's blood or endorphins or other body fluids." [...] She wanted to make a video about sex, but said that [...] "in a way that wasn't so clichéd. [...] And [...] is made to give you a picture of what sex really is, which I think is something that's very <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> because sex is everywhere all the time, but very rarely is it made out to be something real." [...] The video begins with a reversed scene of a young couple having sex. In cutscenes, Robyn appears with a tube dress with clear liquid flowing through it. When the young woman begins to switch her sex partners, the liquid in the tubes wrapped around Robyn begins to alter colors and flow more quickly. The video ends with Robyn standing alone with black liquid in the tubes.|$|E

2500|$|Patton's {{reaction}} to this fame has been unconventional. He has acted irreverently towards the music industry, and expressed his distaste for the infamous lifestyles of rock stars. In a 1995 interview with the San Francisco Chronicle, he stated: [...] "It's <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> see as much as you'd like to with our schedule on the road, but it's <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> coke and fuck whores every night.

Stephen took his life in January 2010 and Gwen then struggled to keep Dog Mountain going. She took her own life, as well, in 2013.|$|R
