5000|$|Though {{the player}} {{directly}} controls the boy, Blobert {{is controlled by}} the computer AI. The player must rely on the shapeshifting blob to cross gaps, reach higher platforms, and overcome the obstacles and enemies. Blobert can change into several different tools when the player feeds him flavored jelly beans. A licorice jelly bean, for instance, will change Blobert into a ladder, while an apple jelly bean will turn him into a jack. Whistling at Blobert causes him to change back to his original shape and continue following the boy. The player is encouraged to experiment with the jelly beans and their effects to navigate the puzzling game world. Scattered throughout Earth's caverns are various treasures and diamonds that increase the player's score and can be used to purchase vitamins at a drugstore located within the game world. Vitamins can be used in conjunction with a special [...] "VitaBlaster" [...] gun, which is in turn used on Blobolonia to complete certain tasks. Also found on the map are <b>extra</b> <b>jelly</b> beans and peppermints, which increase the player's lives.|$|E
50|$|Oh-Aew is a {{very famous}} desert of Phuket, and it {{originates}} from Phuket. Oh-Aew is made from jellied banana-flour mixed with boiled red beans, ice and sweet red syrup <b>Extra</b> <b>jellies</b> and fruit is also added to make it sweeter and more flavorful. People who come to visit Phuket must try this {{because this is the}} signature desert of Phuket town.|$|R
50|$|As the egg hatches, worker bees add {{royal jelly}} - a {{secretion}} from glands on {{the heads of}} young bees. For three days the young larvae are fed royal jelly, then they are fed nectar or diluted honey and pollen. A few female larvae in special queen cups may be selected to become queens. Their special queen cups are flooded with royal jelly for six days. The <b>extra</b> royal <b>jelly</b> speeds up the queen larvae development. Only the queen will have fully developed ovaries, i.e. she will be sexually mature.Drone brood develops from unfertilized eggs. Drone brood cells are larger than the cells of female worker bees.|$|R
5000|$|Members of Proterospongia {{have the}} typical choanoflagellate cell {{structure}} {{characterized by a}} cell body 5-10μm in diameter with a 20-30μm apical flagellum surrounded by a collar of 15-25 actin-filled microvilli. The flagellum propels swimming cells through the water column and creates water currents through the microvilli, which trap foodstuff such as bacteria and detritus. The arrangement of organelles in Proterospongia appears consistent with other choanoflagellates and is characterized by an anterior dictyosome under the flagellar base, a central nucleus, peripheral mitochondria and a posterior food vacuole. As {{a member of the}} Codonosigidae family, Proterospongia have only a fine investment that is indistinct by light microscopy or completely lack an outer-covering. Proterospongia species are distinguished by colony morphology, which vary from simple chains of cells to striking astral assemblages. [...] Colonies having <b>extra</b> cellular <b>jelly</b> or mucilage have been described by Kent, Lackey, and Leadbeater; however the composition of this substance is unknown. [...] Kent also described a Proterospongia species containing two types of cells embedded in mucilage; however, this is the only account of such a species and {{it has been suggested that}} the observed amoeboid cells were actually posterior tentacles that are present on some choanoflagellates.|$|R
50|$|The Rescue of Princess Blobette {{tells the}} story of a young, male protagonist and his blob {{companion}} as they attempt to rescue the latter's girlfriend, the titular Princess Blobette. The damsel in distress has been imprisoned by the Antagonistic Alchemist within the highest tower of the Royal Castle on the planet Blobolinia. Like its predecessor, A Boy and His Blob: Trouble on Blobolonia, The Rescue of Princess Blobette is a puzzle-platformer in which the player directly controls the boy as he is followed around by the blob, who is controlled by the computer AI. The pair must navigate the various passages and floors of the castle to locate and free Blobette. The boy can only run back and forth, cannot jump or swim, and will die if he falls a long distance or comes in contact with dangerous objects such as flame throwers and sewer serpents. However, the blob can be made to turn into useful tools when he is fed jelly beans of various flavors. Each flavor causes a different transformation. For example, feeding the blob a tangerine jelly bean will change him into a trampoline, which the boy can then use to reach high platforms. The player may also locate <b>extra</b> <b>jelly</b> bean sacks and numerous, optional treasures. Finding five peppermints will increase the player's extra lives by one.|$|E
40|$|Peroxidase (POD) and polyphenoloxidase (PPO) are {{oxidative}} enzymes {{related to}} the darkening process suffered by fruits. Thus, {{the control of the}} effects of these enzymes, in the preservation of fruit, in order to minimize the darkening process is considered of great importance for food processing technology. The present study investigated the effects of POD and PPO on fresh grapes from Benitaka and Rubi cultivars, as well as the thermal stability and the residual enzymatic activities in the processing of juice and <b>jelly</b> (<b>extra</b> and light). Moreover, the microbiological quality of the processed products was evaluated. It was observed that, the effect of the POD enzyme, from the soluble fraction, {{as well as from the}} ionically bound fraction, was similar in both varieties of grapes, Benitaka and Rubi. But the effect of the PPO enzyme was higher in the Rubi variety. Operations such as cooking and pasteurizing were the most efficient processes to reduce the residual enzymatic effect of POD and PPO in grape jelly, in comparison to the juice. Although such processes were not enough for total enzymatic inactivation, they permitted a considerable reduction, thus were efficient to guarantee the microbiological safety of the products, such as jelly and juice...|$|R
40|$|A {{peroxidase}} e a polifenoloxidase estão relacionadas com o escurecimento de frutas, por isso o controle das atividades destas enzimas é de grande importância para a tecnologia de alimentos. Neste trabalho estudaram-se as atividades dessas enzimas nas uvas frescas das cultivares Benitaka e Rubi, bem como as suas termoestabilidades e as suas atividades enzimáticas residuais no suco e nas geléias (extra e light). Foi também avaliada a qualidade microbiológica dos produtos elaborados. As atividades da enzima POD, tanto da fração solúvel quanto da ionicamente ligada, foram semelhantes nas uvas das duas variedades, Benitaka e Rubi. A atividade da enzima polifenoloxidase foi maior na variedade Rubi. As operações de cocção e pasteurização foram mais eficientes para baixar as atividades enzimáticas residuais da POD e PPO quando aplicadas às geléias de uva, em comparação com o suco. Embora não foram suficientes para a total inativação enzimática, essas operações reduziram-nas consideravelmente, e foram eficientes para garantir seguridade microbiológica dos produtos, geléias e suco.
