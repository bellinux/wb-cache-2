5|$|Kemp was {{considered}} {{the star of the}} 1992 Republican National Convention. In 1992 and 1993, Kemp {{was considered}} the favorite or co-favorite for the 1996 Presidential nomination. At the time of the 1994 mid-term elections, Kemp was widely anticipated to announce his candidacy for 1996, and his supporters wanted a formal announcement {{by the end of the}} year. In January 1995, Kemp's stated reason for not entering the 1996 Republican Party presidential primaries was that his personal beliefs were out of balance with the contemporary Republican political landscape: Kemp opposed term limits, he always preferred tax cuts to anything resembling a balanced budget amendment and, unlike most Republicans, favored federal incentives to combat urban poverty. In 1995, Gloria Borger noted Kemp was not <b>in</b> <b>step</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> 1994 Contract with America. Kemp also noted a distaste for the vast fundraising necessary for a Presidential campaign. Gergen stated that by 1996 the selection process had become so expensive, mean and personally invasive that it discouraged several top Republicans from running. In 1995, while the world awaited the campaign decision announcement by Colin Powell, Kemp had positive thoughts on the prospect of such a campaign.|$|E

25|$|A brief {{recovery}} in 1994 {{was followed by}} an economic slump in 1995–1996. Since that date, the Canadian economy has improved markedly, <b>in</b> <b>step</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> boom in the United States. In the mid-1990s, Jean Chrétien's Liberal government began to post annual budgetary surpluses, and steadily paid down the national debt. Once {{referred to as a}} fiscal basket-case , Canada has become a model of fiscal stability as the government has posted surpluses every fiscal year from 1996 to the 2008 recession.|$|E
25|$|Back-arc basins are {{hypothesized}} to form {{as a result}} of trench rollback (also, hinge rollback). This is the backward motion of the subduction zone relative to the motion of the plate which is being subducted. As the subduction zone and its associated trench pull backward, the overriding plate is stretched, thinning the crust which is manifest in the back-arc basin. Sedimentation is strongly asymmetric, with most of the sediment supplied from the active magmatic arc which regresses <b>in</b> <b>step</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> rollback of the trench.|$|E

2500|$|Single stage presses {{often do}} not provide {{an easy way to}} prime cases. Various add-on tools can be used for priming the case on the down-stroke, or a {{separate}} tool can be used. Since cases loaded with a single stage press are done <b>in</b> <b>steps,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> die being changed between steps, a purpose made priming tool is often faster than trying to integrate a priming step to a press step. [...] A purpose made tool is also often more consistent than a model that fits on a single stage press, resulting in a more consistent primer seating depth.|$|R

25|$|Haloalkanes {{have been}} known for centuries. Chloroethane was {{produced}} synthetically in the 15th century. The systematic synthesis of such compounds developed in the 19th century <b>in</b> <b>step</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> development of organic chemistry and {{the understanding of the}} structure of alkanes. Methods were developed for the selective formation of C-halogen bonds. Especially versatile methods included the addition of halogens to alkenes, hydrohalogenation of alkenes, and the conversion of alcohols to alkyl halides. These methods are so reliable and so easily implemented that haloalkanes became cheaply available for use in industrial chemistry because the halide could be further replaced by other functional groups.|$|E
25|$|Originally, since c. 1250, {{there was}} only the Parlement of Paris, severed from the King's Council in 1307, with {{sessions}} held inside the medieval royal palace on the Île de la Cité, still the site of the Paris Hall of Justice. The Paris parlement's jurisdiction covered the entire kingdom {{as it was in the}} 14th century, but did not automatically advance <b>in</b> <b>step</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Crown's ever expanding realm. In 1443, following the turmoil of the Hundred Years' War, King Charles VII of France granted Languedoc its own parlement by establishing the Parlement of Toulouse, the first parlement outside Paris; its jurisdiction extended over most of southern France.|$|E
25|$|Following the 2008/09 season, Conor Henry was {{replaced}} by former Sydney Spirit head coach Rob Beveridge. However, in May 2009, the Wildcats came within weeks of folding unless they raised {{a million dollars in}} sponsorship. The NBL itself was also in strife; with the competition falling on tough times, there was a real possibility at the time {{that there would be no}} league in 2009/10. The Wildcats eventually received backing from property developer Diploma Group, while the NBL made significant changes to the competition. One of Basketball Australia's moves for the 2009/10 season was to return the NBL game to a 40-minute format from the 48-minutes it adopted in 1984, ostensibly to accommodate the international game. This was done to bring Australia back <b>in</b> <b>step</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> rest of the world (outside the NBA) and to be more attractive to television as a package because a 40-minute game slots well into a two-hour timeslot.|$|E

500|$|The English courts {{initially}} wavered {{in recognizing}} {{that an individual}} has a legitimate expectation of a substantive benefit arising from a representation from the authorities. The notion of protecting a substantive legitimate expectation was espoused in the 1995 High Court decision in R. v. Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, ex parte Hamble (Off-shore) Fisheries Ltd. In that controversial case, Justice Stephen Sedley formulated the framework for legitimate expectations as {{the balance of the}} requirements of fairness against the decision-maker's reasons to change the policy. This was <b>in</b> <b>step</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> development of the doctrine of proportionality as prescribed in the Treaty on European Union, and in European Court of Justice case law. The decision wove proportionality back into the fabric of judicial review in the UK under the banner of an expanding doctrine of [...] "fair administration" [...] despite the clear rejection of proportionality as a self-standing ground of review by the House of Lords in R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Brind (1991).|$|E

Steve Peake of About.com placed [...] "Voices Carry" [...] at number five of his list of the [...] "Top 10 Songs of 1985", calling it a [...] "nearly flawless pop single". Lynn Van Matre of the Chicago Tribune said that [...] "much of the group's material falls into the dance rock category", adding that the [...] "bluesy title cut, [...] 'Voices Carry', was particularly impressive". Brent Mann, in his book 99 Red Balloons... called it [...] "the quintessential New Wave song", and felt that [...] "Mann's cool, dark lead vocals were right <b>in</b> <b>step</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> style".|$|E
500|$|The {{design for}} the $50 {{received}} contemporary criticism; some suggested {{that the presence of}} the dolphins on the octagonal coin implied that the canal had been constructed for cetacean convenience. A 1916 column in the American Journal of Numismatics contained the conclusion that [...] "the criticism often heard that 'there is nothing American about the coin except the inscription' is fully warranted." [...] Swiatek and Breen dismissed criticisms as [...] "numerous and mostly irrelevant, based on total misreading of the iconography. [...] with stupid claims that Pallas Athena meant nothing on a U.S. coin unless she could be identified with Liberty, and that Athena's owl would never mean anything to all of us". Vermeule deemed the $50 coins [...] "a tour de force, dated to be sure, but unusual enough in all respects to be worthy of what American numismatic art could achieve". Later Chief Engraver Elizabeth Jones felt that the $50 pieces were [...] "stylistically <b>in</b> <b>step</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> period [...] considerable artistic merits". Jeff Garrett and Ron Guth, in their book on U.S. gold coins, deemed the Panama–Pacific $50 pieces [...] "one of the most stunning issues ever produced by the U.S. government".|$|E

2500|$|The {{forerunner of}} all modern Zoroastrian {{calendars}} {{is the system}} used to reckon dates in the Persian Empire. In 539 BC, Persia's rulers conquered Babylon, and soon afterwards – at least by the 4th century BC – adopted the Babylonian luni-solar calendar for civil purposes. [...] This kept <b>in</b> <b>step</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> seasons, unlike the religious calendar which consisted of 12 months each containing 30 days, adjusted at that time {{by the addition of}} five epagomenal days {{at the end of the}} year to bring the total up to 365. [...] The earliest Zoroastrian calendar (also misleadingly called [...] "Avestan calendar" [...] although it is younger than the Avesta proper) follows the Babylonian in relating the seventh and other days of the month to Ahura Mazda.|$|E

2500|$|Low {{profit margins}} in {{themselves}} do {{not explain the}} deterioration of revenues. To a large extent {{the costs of the}} operation of the VOC had a [...] "fixed" [...] character (military establishments; maintenance of the fleet and such). Profit levels might therefore have been maintained if the increase in the scale of trading operations that in fact took place had resulted in economies of scale. However, though larger ships transported the growing volume of goods, labour productivity did not go up sufficiently to realise these. In general the Company's overhead rose <b>in</b> <b>step</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> growth in trade volume; declining gross margins translated directly into a decline in profitability of the invested capital.

Among the orchestral arrangements appearing on Pet Sounds (1966), [...] "God Only Knows" [...] is considered [...] "exquisite baroque pop" [...] by The Sydney Morning Herald. Concerning the Beach Boys' involvement with sunshine pop, the orchestral style of Pet Sounds (1966) was imitated by many Los Angeles record producers in the 1960s, but as The A.V.
