5|$|A total {{solar eclipse}} {{provides}} {{a rare opportunity}} to observe the corona (the outer layer of the Sun's atmosphere). Normally this is not visible because the photosphere is much brighter than the corona. According to the point reached in the solar cycle, the corona may appear small and symmetric, or large and fuzzy. It <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> to predict this in advance.|$|E
5|$|Found in dry sclerophyll {{forest on}} sandstone-based nutrient-deficient soils, P.linearis {{is adapted to}} a fire-prone environment; the plants resprout epicormic buds from beneath their thick bark after bushfires. The fruit are {{consumed}} by vertebrates such as kangaroo, possums and currawongs. As {{with other members of}} the genus, P.linearis is rare in cultivation as it <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> to propagate, either by seed or cuttings. It adapts readily to cultivation, preferring acidic soils with good drainage and at least a partly sunny aspect.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} parts of Van Cortlandt Park have a varied geology. The Northwest Woods and Old Croton Aqueduct Trailway have a steep terrain dotted with Fordham gneiss, a metamorphic rock that <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> to weather. The Tibbetts Brook valley is set in Inwood marble, which weathers more easily. The {{east side of the}} park near Indian Field contains Yonkers granite, an igneous rock that mixed with Fordham gneiss as a hot magma before later cooling.|$|E

25|$|Bias may be actual, imputed or apparent. Actual bias is {{established}} {{where it is}} actually established that a decision-maker was prejudiced in favour of or against a party.

25|$|This type of resin is {{typically}} used post-1930s {{and is an}} indication of modern conservation work. Generally epoxy <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> but unlike shellac is not brittle. The color of epoxy resin can range from yellow/green to a dark yellow/brown. Yellowing of the resin {{is an indication of}} aging. Warm to hot water or acetone are known to be the solvents of this adhesive.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} fragment is the First Partheneion or Louvre-Partheneion, found in 1855 in Saqqara in Egypt by the French scholar Auguste Mariette. This Partheneion consists of 101 lines, of {{which more than}} 30 are severely damaged. It <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> {{to say anything about}} this fragment, and scholars have debated ever since the discovery and publication about its content and the occasion on which this partheneion could have been performed.|$|E

25|$|The phase {{structure}} of quark matter remains mostly conjectural {{because it is}} difficult to perform calculations predicting the properties of quark matter. The reason is that QCD, the theory describing the dominant interaction between quarks, is strongly coupled at the densities and temperatures of greatest physical interest, and hence it <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> to obtain any predictions from it. Here are brief descriptions of some of the standard approaches.|$|E

Cooch is better than Wal at golf, even though the course <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> (the first hole is a par 14). When they do play on a real course Cooch usually wins. Wal claims that the trees are on Cooch's side. Wal and Cooch also play snooker on a small table in Cooch's house, where a tree hampers play.|$|E
25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> {{to come up}} {{with another}} process that would produce {{deuterium}} other than by nuclear fusion. Such a process would require that the temperature be hot enough to produce deuterium, but not hot enough to produce helium-4, and that this process should immediately cool to non-nuclear temperatures after {{no more than a few}} minutes. It would also be necessary for the deuterium to be swept away before it reoccurs.|$|E

25|$|Fused quartz, {{also called}} fused-silica glass, vitreous-silica glass: silica (SiO2) in vitreous, or glass, form (i.e., its {{molecules}} are disordered and random, without crystalline structure). It has very low thermal expansion, <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard,</b> and resists high temperatures (1000–1500°C). It {{is also the}} most resistant against weathering (caused in other glasses by alkali ions leaching out of the glass, while staining it). Fused quartz is used for high-temperature applications such as furnace tubes, lighting tubes, melting crucibles, etc.|$|E
25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> to {{estimate}} the number of Pomaks along with the Turkified Pomaks who live in Turkey, as they have blended into the Turkish society and have been often linguistically and culturally dissimilated. According to Milliyet and Turkish Daily News reports, the number of Pomaks along with the Turkified Pomaks {{in the country is}} about 600,000. According to the Bulgarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Bulgarian Orthodox Christian community in Turkey stands at 500 members.|$|E

25|$|A {{butterfly}} gag is a wing-shaped gag that {{is usually}} inflatable {{by means of a}} rubber bulb. The central part fits behind the teeth to fill up the mouth, while the wings go between the teeth and the lips. The gag inflates {{in the shape of a}} butterfly. This kind of gag <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> to keep in the wearer; the use of an O-ring in front of the gag strapped to the back of the head will hold the butterfly gag in place.|$|E
25|$|Foley {{is another}} method of adding sound effects. Foley {{is more of}} a {{technique}} for creating sound effects than a type of sound effect, but it is often used for creating the incidental real world sounds that are very specific to what is going on onscreen, such as footsteps. With this technique the action onscreen is essentially recreated to try to match it as closely as possible. If done correctly it <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> for audiences to tell what sounds were added and what sounds were originally recorded (location sound).|$|E
25|$|Most {{of these}} {{techniques}} were developed during World War II or earlier, and {{have been used to}} some degree in every conflict since. Daniel Lerner was in the OSS (the predecessor to the American CIA) and in his book, attempts to analyze how effective the various strategies were. He concludes that {{there is little evidence that}} any of them were dramatically successful, except perhaps surrender instructions over loudspeakers when victory was imminent. It should be noted, though, that measuring the success or failure of psychological warfare <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard,</b> as the conditions are very far from being a controlled experiment.|$|E
