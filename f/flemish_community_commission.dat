25|$|The {{region was}} placed on equal footing with the Flemish Region and the Walloon Region. Nonetheless, Brussels does not have its own community; rather the Flemish Community and the French Community both have {{jurisdiction}} in Brussels. The <b>Flemish</b> <b>Community</b> <b>Commission</b> (VGC) and the French Community Commission (COCOF) were to act on their respective Communities' behalf in Brussels. Brussels divides its funding for the Communities between them, with 20% going to the VGC, and 80% to the COCOF.|$|E
25|$|The French Community and the Flemish Community {{exercise}} their powers in Brussels through two community-specific public authorities: the French Community Commission (French: Commission communautaire française or COCOF) and the <b>Flemish</b> <b>Community</b> <b>Commission</b> (Dutch: Vlaamse Gemeenschapscommissie or VGC). These two bodies each have an assembly {{composed of the}} members of each linguistic group of the Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region. They also have a board composed of the ministers and secretaries of state of each linguistic group in the Government of the Brussels-Capital Region.|$|E
25|$|In 1971, the FDF {{managed to}} secure the right for {{individuals}} to again {{be able to choose}} the language of their education, and the FDF expected that Francization would continue as before. Initially, the effect was a {{reduction in the number of}} students enrolled in Flemish schools, falling from 6000 students in elementary school and 16,000 in high school in 1966-1967 to 5000 and 12,000 nine years later. But by that point, the Flemish Centre of Education, created in 1967, had begun its campaign to promote education in Dutch, with its initial target being Dutch-speaking families. In 1976, this task was taken up by the precursor to today's <b>Flemish</b> <b>Community</b> <b>Commission</b> (VGC), which made substantial investments to improve the quality of Dutch language schools. Starting in the 1978-1979 school year, the strategy began to bear fruit, and the number of children enrolled in Flemish daycares began to increase. This translated to an increase in the enrollment in primary schools a few years later. As a result, all young Dutch-speaking children born after the mid-1970s have only gone to Flemish schools. The Francization of Dutch-speakers became more and more rare with time. Nonetheless, foreign immigration continued to tilt the balance in favor of French.|$|E
25|$|The French <b>Community</b> <b>Commission</b> {{has also}} another capacity: some {{legislative}} {{powers of the}} French Community have been devolved to the Walloon Region (for the French language area of Belgium) and to the French <b>Community</b> <b>Commission</b> (for the bilingual language area). The <b>Flemish</b> <b>Community,</b> however, did the opposite; it merged the Flemish Region into the <b>Flemish</b> <b>Community.</b> This is related to different conceptions in the two communities, one focusing more on the Communities and the other more on the Regions, causing an asymmetrical federalism. Because of this devolution, the French <b>Community</b> <b>Commission</b> can enact decrees, which are legislative acts.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to these two, a Common <b>Community</b> <b>Commission</b> exists which is the entity when the Brussels-Capital Region exercises community powers. In these cases, there are more requirements for the legislative process in order to safeguard the interests of both linguistic communities (de facto the <b>Flemish</b> <b>community).</b>|$|R
50|$|The Common <b>Community</b> <b>Commission</b> (Commission communautaire commune, Gemeenschappelijke Gemeenschapscommissie) is {{responsible}} for Brussels community matters that are common to both the French <b>Community</b> and the <b>Flemish</b> <b>Community</b> and for institutions that fall within the competencies of the Communities but do not belong exclusively to either Community in the Brussels-Capital Region of Belgium. Examples of this include the bilingual hospitals in the Brussels Region.|$|R
