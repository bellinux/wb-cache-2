40|$|AbstractIn modern school {{different}} levels of teaching, besides gaining knowledge, {{are becoming more and}} more important, especially didactics and use of modern teaching technologies. The purpose of our research was to establish the use of multimedia at science classes in spite of only 5 days a year of additional permanent technical education for teachers, granted by law. We were interested in multi-level use of computers at science classes and teachers methodical approaches. The research included all science teachers in technical and vocational schools all over Slovenia. We can conclude that teachers have given the multimedia method more than big advantage over classical methods. Rationalization and efficiency improvement points of view were especially emphasized as the results have improved for more than half according to standard methods. Insufficient knowledge about multimedia and its advantages over classical methods was noticed among science teachers. But teachers gave multimedia big support in science classes and they exposed how necessary <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>using</b> multimedia in future...|$|E
40|$|Joyce Fortune and Geoff Peters’ {{research}} into how the failures in organizations can be best understood extends {{over twenty years}} and their observations and conclusions have been well tested. This book shows that understanding {{can also lead to}} prevention. It aims to raise the study of failure to a point where experiences and lessons learnt are openly discussed as positive achievements rather than dark secrets. The Systems Failures Method, which {{is at the core of}} this book, is designed to focus systems thinking to the specifics of understanding failure. Major disasters and smaller failures could be prevented using systems thinking because it is uniquely suited to the task of avoiding failure. The Systems Failures Method has now been applied by well over 1000 people in a wide range of situations. Cases used in this book include the gas leak at a chemical plant in Bhopal, India, and the failure of electronic medical records in the health care systems of the UK, Canada and the USA. The challenge for those in business <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>using</b> failure as a trigger for organizational learning. This book will help them. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{thesis is}} focused on {{premature}} newborn thermomanagement. It is focused particularly on very premature and extremely premature newborns which suffer {{the highest level of}} thermolability. The theoretical part deals with the particularities of premature newborn thermoregulation, newborns' reactions to thermal stress, thermomanagement in the delivery room and providing a thermoneutral environment in the incubator. The thesis describes a method of servo-control mode of body temperature, which has not been utilised for premature newborns in Czech Republic. The aim of the thesis <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>using</b> this method and compare it with the method of manual control. Based on the total time not meeting the standard, number of failures and other parameters to assess which method is more suitable for body temperature regulation. The research sample consists of 47 newborsn who were born between the 24 th and 32 nd gestational week. Quantitative data collection at one-minute intervals was conducted in the 72 hours after birth. The method choice was random. Statistically important differences between the two methods were measured regarding the total time not meeting the standards.

40|$|Suitable {{analysis}} methods {{are needed for}} evaluation of future timetable scenarios, both in short term operational planning and for strategic planning with a longer time horizon. One method is to use simulation software which {{makes it possible to}} model large networks. The Swedish Transport Administration (Trafikverket) is in a process where the aim <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>using</b> simulation software RailSys as a tool for timetable planning. This will at first be applied for long term strategic planning with the possibility to also use it in operational planning further on. The main focus in this paper is to estimate primary run time extensions from registered data. Ideally these should only represent primary causes, e. g. decreased vehicle performance, variation in driver behaviour or infrastructure malfunctions. These extensions are important in order to make simulations more realistic. Different reduction levels of registered data are tested in order to estimate primary run time extensions. Registered data used are absolute values without distinction between primary and secondary causes. Calibration simulations are done on the Southern main line in Sweden where the mix of high and low speed trains is substantial. TSC import 863 2012 - 02 - 06. QC 20120413 </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{thesis is}} focused on {{problematic}} of risk management process. This topic is frequently ignored in number of firms in Czech Republic. The aim of this thesis is to evaluate the system of risk management based on analyzing in a company of AWIGO s. r. o. and in case of deficiencies propose own solution. The diploma thesis {{is divided into two}} parts, theoretical and practical. The theoretical part is based on the processing of literature research from the technical literature, summarizes the basic concepts and then explains the process of analysis and risk management in companies and other organizations. The practical part analyzes the specific company. In the company ran an interview with three respondents. The interview outlined the current status of the company's risk management. For the evaluation of the real state of risk management was used an internal documents dealing with risk management. After analyzing the status of the proposed solution containing the identification of the fundamental risks for the areas in which the company is engaged. Individual identified risks are assessed according to established criteria set out on my own experiences and observations from the position of temporary worker and consultations with experts in the area of company business. In conclusion of this thesis are given evaluations and recommendations based on previous analysis of risk management in the company. The main proposal <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>using</b> risk management and appropriately adjust the responsibilities and duties within the company...|$|E
40|$|Because many errors {{still exist}} in {{information}} systems for organizations, professional companies like CEPO {{are needed for}} testing information systems on their fit to the organization. To do so, one usually applies a testing framework. The existing (CEPO-way) framework {{is the result of}} ten years of experience. The DEMO methodology (Dietz [1]) is a methodology that has proven itself successful in modelling organizations. DEMO is a powerful tool for identifying all important transactions of an organization (as well as communication with external actors). From this point of view, it could be possible to use DEMO as an aid to check the completeness of an information system, i. e. whether it covers the essential business processes. Note that the coverage need not be full; in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises it may be partial. The existing CEPO-way framework is based on the DEMO methodology, but on only one model. In this study two models were added. The new, so-called DEMO-way, framework was discussed and one test case was used to demonstrate the added value. The new framework is supported by a tool that was built by the author, DEMO-way Script Creator (DSC tool). This tool is a valuable addition to the derivation of testing scripts, because the process model as well as the state model can be placed into the scripts with little effort. Several criteria were determined at the start of this study in order to evaluate the use of extra DEMO models in the framework: development time, walkthrough time, understandability, reproduction possibilities and lacking functionality / error detection. Ultimately, the DEMO-way scored better for many of these criteria, especially the detection of lacking functionality / errors in information systems. Although the DEMO testing script encompasses more testing instructions than the CEPO testing script, the testers did not spend more time walking through the scripts, due to more detailed navigation. Therefore, the recommendation <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>using</b> the two extra DEMO models in combination with DSC tool. Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Scienc...|$|E

40|$|Often {{organizations}} do {{not exactly}} {{know what they}} desire, {{when it comes to}} information systems. Professional companies like ForMetis are needed to give advice and design tailor made information systems for organizations that have the need of it. To do so, one usually uses a software developing methodology. ForMetis has developed such a methodology with their ten year of experience (The ForMetis methodology). The DEMO methodology is a powerful tool that has proven itself successful in the modeling of organizations. DEMO methodology models the essence of an organization and claims to be coherent, consistent, comprehensive and concise. It is a very powerful tool for identifying transaction of an organization and also the communication with the external actors. DEMO can be used as an aid to design information systems and can check the completeness of these systems whether it covers the essential business processes. The ForMetis methodology consists of the following phases: planning, analysis, design, implementation and system. The analysis and design phase are the most important phases. In these phases requirements are retrieved in an informal way and are written on large sheets, which are not reusable. Informal specifications are made and often the implementation is the specification. The new, so called F-DEMO methodology was discussed and a postmortem case (intermediary) was used to illustrate the added value of DEMO. The new methodology is the ForMetis methodology extended with DEMO in the analysis and design phase. In these phases the Construction Model, Proces Model and the State Model are added. These models are a valuable addition to the derivation of requirements and the making of specifications. In order to evaluate the use of F-DEMO a survey was held to check how many of the findings that were raised when producing the information system at the intermediary could be prevented. The findings were categorized in implementation, requirements, usability, misunderstandings, wishes and irrelevant types. From all these findings 33, 1 percent could be prevented using the new methodology. The project time is also reduced. Therefore, the recommendation <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>using</b> the F-DEMO methodology in future projects.
