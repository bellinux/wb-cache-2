EXECUTIVE SUMMARY GPS-Squitter is a technology for aircraft surveillance in which aircraft broadcast their GPSdetermined positions to all listeners via the Mode S data link. It can be used to provide aircraft traffic displays, on the ground for controllers and in the cockpit for pilots. It is compatible with existing <b>ground-based</b> <b>beacon</b> interrogator radars and is an evolutionary way to move from ground-radar surveillance to Automatic Dependent Surveillance. During a July 1994 meeting, the FAA requested that MIT Lincoln Laboratory conduct a demonstration of GPS-Squitter in the Gulf of Mexico. Shortly thereafter, in November-December 1994, a field evaluation of GPS-Squitter for air surveillance was held in the Gulf. Objectives of this evaluation were to determine the suitability of GPS-Squitter for air surveillance in general, and more specifically for air surveillance of helicopters servicing oil platforms in the Gulf ofMexico...|$|E
40|$|In {{an earlier}} study, Thampi et al. (2006) {{have shown that}} the {{strength}} and asymmetry of Equatorial Ionization Anomaly (EIA), obtained well ahead of the onset time of Equatorial Spread F (ESF) have a definite role on the subsequent ESF activity, and a new "forecast parameter" has been identified for the prediction of ESF. This paper presents the observations of EIA strength and asymmetry from the Indian longitudes during the period from August 2005 –March 2007. These observations are made using the line of sight Total Electron Content (TEC) measured by a <b>ground-based</b> <b>beacon</b> receiver located at Trivandrum (8. 5 ° N, 77 ° E, 0. 5 ° N dip lat) in India. It is seen that the seasonal variability of EIA strength and asymmetry are manifested in the latitudinal gradients obtained using the relative TEC measurements. As a consequence, the "forecast parameter" also displays a definite seasonal pattern. The seasonal variability of the EIA strength and asymmetry, and the "forecast parameter" are discussed in the present paper and a critical value for has been identified for each month/season. The likely "skill factor" of the new parameter is assessed using the data for a total of 122 days, and it is seen that when the estimated value of the "forecast parameter" exceeds the critical value, the ESF is seen to occur on more than 95 % of cases...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this work}} is to assert the {{feasibility}} {{of the use of}} a ground-based network, consisting of beacons, to aid in the provision of localization for mobile stations on Mars. The dayside ionosphere can be utilized to refract and reflect radio signals to some receiver beyond the horizon. The propagation of radio signals is studied {{with the use of a}} simulation, which makes use of a ray-tracing method to track radio signals in the ionosphere. Several scenarios are defined to classify the state of the ionosphere. A nominal scenario is provided, with ionospheric properties prevalent at Mars. Furthermore, scenarios are defined to include both a minimum and maximum solar activity, as well as dust storms and SEP events. The determination of the position of a mobile station can be done by exploiting the properties of the received signal. Three localization technologies are studied in detail in this work, being the time of arrival (TOA), received signal strength (RSS) and angle of arrival (AoA). The Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is used to determine the lower bound of the precision of a position estimate, produced by any of these technologies. A comparison of the obtained precisions shows that it is possible to obtain a precision of less than 13 m for any scenario when using TOA technology, and 6 m when using AoA technology. Furthermore, a coverage of at least 92 % is achieved in all but the most extreme scenarios. The coverage increases with decreasing frequency. The best results are obtained with a frequency of 2 : 5 MHz. Moreover, it is shown that the best precision is obtained by placing beacons either in a rectangular or triangular grid on Mars, with beacons spaced 10 _ apart. By doing so, a 4 m precision can even be obtained under the nominal scenario for a frequency of 2 : 5 MHz and 4 : 5 MHz with any technology. Ultimately, a <b>ground-based</b> <b>beacon</b> system has proven to be a sound solution to providing positioning estimates on the Martian surface...|$|E
50|$|In the United States, RNAV was {{developed}} in the 1960s, and the first such routes were published in the 1970s. In January 1983, the Federal Aviation Administration revoked all RNAV routes in the contiguous United States due to findings that aircraft were using inertial navigation systems rather than the <b>ground-based</b> <b>beacons,</b> and so cost-benefit analysis was not in favour of maintaining the RNAV routes system. RNAV was reintroduced after the large-scale introduction of satellite navigation.|$|R
50|$|Vehicle Infrastructure Integration (VII) is an {{initiative}} fostering research and applications development {{for a series}} of technologies directly linking road vehicles to their physical surroundings, first and foremost in order to improve road safety. The technology draws on several disciplines, including transport engineering, electrical engineering, automotive engineering, and computer science. VII specifically covers road transport although similar technologies are in place or under development for other modes of transport. Planes, for example, use <b>ground-based</b> <b>beacons</b> for automated guidance, allowing the autopilot to fly the plane without human intervention. In highway engineering, improving the safety of a roadway can enhance overall efficiency. VII targets improvements in both safety and efficiency.|$|R

40|$|Target signal {{requirements}} for aircraft navigation systems that use radiometric receivers which map thermally emitted power radiated by terrain or power radiated by <b>ground-based</b> <b>beacons</b> are discussed. For selected millimeter wavelength bands, microwaves suffer relatively little degradation by absorption or scattering on {{passage through the}} atmosphere, despite extreme weather variations. Interest centers on 8 -millimeter waves because of component availability, portability (small size), high image resolution, and all-weather capability at this wavelength. The idea of radiometric airborne navigation is introduced. Elements of radiometry, terrain radiation, and atmospheric transmission characteristics are reviewed. Data pertaining to these elements at 8 mm wavelength are collected. Calculation of radiometric contrasts is discussed for some simple models of terrain targets...|$|R

50|$|<b>Ground-based</b> radio <b>beacons</b> emit {{a signal}} which {{is picked up}} by {{receiving}} satellites. This is in reverse configuration to other GNSS, in which the transmitters are space-borne and receivers are in majority near {{the surface of the}} Earth. A frequency shift of the signal occurs that is caused by the movement of the satellite (Doppler effect). From this observation satellite orbits, ground positions, as well as other parameters can be derived.|$|R
40|$|Ionospheric data {{obtained}} from the DORIS system are used in this paper. The DORIS system is composed of several <b>ground-based</b> <b>beacons</b> which emit at two frequencies (400 MHz and 2 GHz) and of receivers on board several satellites (currently SPOT 2, SPOT 4, SPOT 5, Topex-Poseidon, Jason 1 and Envisat). Thanks to the density of its network coverage (∼ 50 stations), DORIS provides information on the ionosphere. The TEC (Total Electron Content) parameter which is the electron density integrated over the vertical could be obtained from DORIS measurements. In a first step, the paper describes the way to obtain the TEC data from the DORIS ionospheric measurements, and comparisons of the results are done with the IRI 2001 model. In a second step, TEC values are used to search for correlation between ionospheric perturbations and seismic activity. Earthquakes of magnitude larger than 5 are chosen close to the ground-based DORIS stations. Among other results, the statistics show that, during the night time and at geomagnetic latitude close to the equator (< 10 °), TEC amplitude fluctuates {{at the time of}} the earthquakes as it is expected, but also 2 days and 5 days before...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} how differential GPS (DGPS) and miniature, low-cost Integ-rity Beacon pseudolites {{were used to}} carry out 110 successful automatic landings of a United Airlines Boeing 737 aircraft. These autopilot-in-the-loop flight tests using GPS Integrity <b>Beacons</b> (low-power, <b>ground-based</b> marker <b>beacon</b> pseudolites placed under the approach path) furnished evidence that GPS can provide the full performance necessary to meet the stringent specifications of Category III. The built-in geometrical redundancy provided by Integrity Beacon ranging is coupled with centimeter-level accuracy to provide the system integrity. This integrity-calculated {{to be better than}} one part in a billion probability of missed detection-is achieved independently from ground-based monitors using receiver autonomous integrity monitoring @AIM) ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} {{the concept and}} estimates of the pointing-knowledge ac-curacy of a star tracker-based acquisition, tracking, and pointing system. The major advantages of this technology are (1) no requirement for a costly <b>ground-based</b> laser <b>beacon,</b> (2) a large mission range beyond the solar system, and (3) a heritage of mature star tracker technology. The key concept is to combine high-accuracy star trackers and high-bandwidth inertial sensors to achieve high-accuracy and high-bandwidth pointing knowledge through the iterative averaging process. The pointing-knowledge bandwidth {{is divided into three}} areas (0 – 10 Hz, 10 – 50 Hz, and> 50 Hz). Signal for each bandwidth are provided by star tracker gyros and angle sensors. Analysis shows that a pointing knowledge of 150 nanoradians (single axis, 1 sigma) can be achieved with an 8 -cm-diameter telescope aperture. Addi-tional expectations include 1 / 25 pixel accuracy per star, Space Infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF) -class gyros (ARW = 0. 0001 deg/root-hr), 5 -Hz star trackers with an ∼ 5. 0 degree field of view, a detector of 1000 by 1000 pixels, and stars of roughly 9 to 9. 5 magnitudes. This 150 -nanoradian pointing knowledge is well below the typical deep-space optical communications requirements of 200 to 300 nanoradians. Furthermore, the link availability can be maintained above 98 percent with a single star tracker. I...|$|R
30|$|The airglow observations, {{described}} in the previous section, show the occurrence of ionospheric perturbations at bottomside F-region heights. We found the fluctuations to be localized, occurring within only a few degrees of longitude. When two low-intensity airglow bands were observed simultaneously, the spacing between them was about 350 – 460 km. Previous observations of large-scale wave structures (LSWS) made by the ALTAIR incoherent scatter radar indicated a zonal wavelength between 340 and 870 km (Tsunoda and White 1981; Tsunoda et al. 2011). The initial faint airglow perturbations associated with the bottomside fluctuations (see Figs.  4, 5, and 6) show zonal motion. ALTAIR observations of LSWS, however, show a near-stationary growth (Tsunoda 2005). Using measurements of the ionospheric electron content (TEC) made by <b>ground-based</b> receivers and <b>beacon</b> signals from low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, Tsunoda et al. (2011) and Tulasi Ram et al. (2014) found TEC perturbations prior to ESF development that they associated with LSWS. A statistical study carried out by Tulasi Ram et al. (2014) showed that the TEC LSWS had zonal wavelengths varying between 100 and 700 km with most cases having a wavelength ranging between 200 and 500 km.|$|R
