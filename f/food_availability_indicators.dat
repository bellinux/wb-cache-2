Best practices to fight hunger and undernutrition {{have been available}} for a long while, but lack of political will among leaders {{and a lack of}} political power among the poor have hampered their implementation. Since indices have proven to be powerful tools for advocacy and are able to capture multifaceted phenomena, the Global Hunger Index (GHI) was developed to increase attention to the hunger problem and mobilize the political will to speed up urgently needed progress in the fight against hunger. The GHI captures three dimensions of hunger: insufficient availability of food, shortfalls in the nutritional status of children, and child mortality, which is to a large extent attributable to undernutrition.

40|$|Abstract Background The Bolsa Família Program {{was created}} in Brazil in 2003, by the joint of {{different}} social programs aimed at poor or very poor families with focus on income transfer to promote immediate poverty relief, conditionalities and complementary programs. Given the contributions of conditional cash transfer programs to poverty alleviation and their potential effects on nutrition and health, {{the objective of this}} study was to assess the impact of the Bolsa Família Program on food purchases of low-income households in Brazil. Methods Representative data from the Household Budget Survey conducted in 2008 – 2009 were studied, with probabilistic sample of 55, 970 households. 11, 282 households were eligible for this study and 48. 5  % were beneficiaries of the BFP. <b>Food</b> <b>availability</b> <b>indicators</b> were compared among paired blocks of households (n[*]=[*] 100), beneficiaries or non-beneficiaries of the Bolsa Família Program, with monthly per capita income up to R$ 210. 00. Blocks of households were created based on the propensity score of each household to have beneficiaries and were homogeneous regarding potential confounding variables. The <b>food</b> <b>availability</b> <b>indicators</b> were weekly per capita expenditure and daily energy consumption, both calculated considering all food items and four food groups based on the extent and purpose of the industrial food processing. The comparisons between the beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries blocks of households were conducted through paired ‘t’ tests. Results Compared to non-beneficiaries, the beneficiaries households had 6  % higher food expenditure (p[*]=[*] 0. 015) and 9. 4  % higher total energy availability (p[*]=[*] 0. 010). It was found a 7. 3  % higher expenditure on in natura or minimally processed foods and 10. 4  % higher expenditure on culinary ingredients among the Bolsa Família Program families. No statistically significant differences were found regarding the expenditure and the availability of processed and ultra-processed food and drink products. In the in natura or minimally processed foods group, the expenditure and the availability of meat, tubers and vegetables were higher among the Bolsa Família Program beneficiaries. Conclusion The Bolsa Família Program impact on food availability among low-income families was higher food expenditure, higher availability of fresh foods and culinary ingredients, including those foods that increase diet’s quality and diversity...|$|E

The lifespan difference arose through higher baseline mortality rate of individuals from harsh developmental conditions, despite a decrease in the rate of actuarial senescence.

We measured leptin levels in 154 samples of free living African striped mice (Rhabdomys pumilio). Striped mice gain significant body mass during the moist season to survive the following dry season with low <b>food</b> <b>availability.</b> We found a strong seasonal effect, with higher leptin levels in the dry season with low <b>food</b> <b>availability,</b> which was in contrast to the hypothesis deriving from studies on laboratory rodents, but in agreement with ecological leptin hypothesis: leptin levels remained low in the period of high <b>food</b> <b>availability,</b> allowing fattening, but increased during periods of low <b>food</b> <b>availability,</b> possibly suppressing energetically costly foraging in an environment where foraging success would have been very low. Leptin correlated significantly and negatively with testosterone levels, and high testosterone levels in the moist season could explain why leptin levels were low even though <b>food</b> <b>availability</b> was high. However, analysing samples from an experimental laboratory study where testosterone levels were increased via implants found no support for a suppressive role of testosterone on leptin.

Less food-secure households depended more on short-cycle food crops as compared with better-off households, who focused more on plantation (cash) crops, although this varied among regions.

40|$|In the {{freshwater}} copepod, Macrocyclops albidus, <b>food</b> <b>availability,</b> {{rearing conditions}} and tapeworm infection clearly affected various life-history traits and their trade-offs. I found that low <b>food</b> <b>availability</b> clearly constrained resource allocations to several life-history (often phenotypically plastic) traits, whereas high <b>food</b> <b>availability</b> either allowed for adjustments in resource allocation patterns or allowed resources to be allocated to several traits without apparent trade-offs. Both {{male and female}} copepods allocated resources according to food availability; developing more slowly and achieving smaller adult body size when food was scarce. When <b>food</b> <b>availability</b> was low females were constrained and produced fewer eggs (in total and per clutch), and started reproduction later than females with more food available. Males under low <b>food</b> <b>availability</b> allocated relatively more to spermatophore size (current reproduction) with decreasing body size. In contrast, when <b>food</b> <b>availability</b> was high males allocated resources to body size as well as spermatophore size. Overall, at maturity, copepods of both sexes were more similar in size than in age, suggesting that large body size was more important for fitness than fast development. In nature the prevalence of copepods infected with cestode tapeworms {{was found to be}} low (0 - 3 %). Female copepods, experimentally infected with the cestode Schistocephalus solidus, showed lower overall fecundity, especially when <b>food</b> <b>availability</b> was low. However, infected females produced a larger proportion of their life-time egg production early in life than non-infected females. This might be an adaptation to reduce future fitness costs of infection. Females grown under bad rearing conditions, but with high <b>food</b> <b>availability,</b> produced their first clutch earlier than females grown under good rearing conditions, indicating an adjustment in timing of reproduction.

40|$|Food {{security}} {{has become a}} key issue worldwide in recent years. According to the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affair (DEFRA) UK, the key components of food security are <b>food</b> <b>availability,</b> global resource sustainability, access, food chain resilience, household food security, safety and confidence of public towards food system. Each of these components has its own indicators which need to be monitored. Only a few studies had been made towards analysing food security {{and most of these}} studies are based on conventional data analysis methods {{such as the use of}} statistical techniques. In handling food security datasets such as crops yield, production, economy growth, household behaviour and others, where most of the data is imprecise, non-linear and uncertain in nature, it is better to handle the data using intelligent system (IS) techniques such as fuzzy logic, neural networks, genetic algorithm and hybrid systems, rather than conventional techniques. Therefore this thesis focuses on the modelling of food security using IS techniques, and a newly developed hybrid intelligent technique called a 2 -stage hybrid (TSH) model, which is capable of making accurate predictions. This technique is evaluated by considering three applications of food security research areas which relate to each of the indicators in the DEFRA key food security components. In addition, another food security model was developed, called a food security risk assessment model. This can be used in assessing the level of risk for food security. The TSH model is constructed by using two key techniques; the Genetic Algorithm (GA) module and the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) module, where these modules combine the global and local search, by optimizing the inputs of ANN in the first stage process and optimizing of weight and threshold of ANN, which is then used to remodel the ANN resulting in better prediction. In evaluating the performance of the TSH prediction model, a total of three datasets have been used, which relate to the food security area studied. These datasets involve the prediction of farm household output, prediction of cereal growth per capita as the <b>food</b> <b>availability</b> main <b>indicators</b> in <b>food</b> security component, and grain security assessment prediction. The TSH prediction model is benchmarked against five others techniques. Each of these five techniques uses an ANN as the prediction model. The models used are: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Multi-layered Perceptron-Artificial Neural Network (MLP-ANN), feature selection (FS) of GA-ANN, Optimized Weight and Threshold (OWTNN) and Sensitive Genetic Neural Optimization (SGNO). Each of the application datasets considered is used to show the capability of the TSH model in making effective predictions, and shows that the general performance of the model is better than the other benchmarked techniques. The research in this thesis can be considered as a stepping-stone towards developing other tools in food security modelling, in order to aid the safety of food security...|$|R

This increased survival, combined with increased breeding productivity associated with food supplementation, implies that an increase in natural <b>food</b> <b>availability,</b> of the magnitude simulated in our experiment, would increase the population growth rate of wheatears on Fair Isle from approximately λ = 0. 93 (a contracting population) to λ = 1. 14 (an expanding population) ...|$|R
40|$|We {{calculated}} {{a simple}} <b>indicator</b> of <b>food</b> <b>availability</b> {{using data from}} 93 sites in 17 countries across contrasted agroecologies in sub- Saharan Africa (> 13, 000 farm households) and analyzed the drivers of variations in <b>food</b> <b>availability.</b> Crop production was {{the major source of}} energy, contributing 60 % of <b>food</b> <b>availability.</b> The off-farm income contribution to <b>food</b> <b>availability</b> ranged from 12 % for households without enough food available (18 % of the total sample) to 27 % for the 58 % of households with sufficient food available. Using only three explanatory variables (household size, number of livestock, and land area), we were able to predict correctly the agricultural determined status of <b>food</b> <b>availability</b> for 72 % of the households, but the relationships were strongly influenced by the degree of market access. Our analyses suggest that targeting poverty through improving market access and off-farm opportunities is a better strategy to increase food security than focusing on agricultural production and closing yield gaps. This calls for multisectoral policy harmonization, incentives, and diversification of employment sources rather than a singular focus on agricultural development. Recognizing and understanding diversity among smallholder farm households in sub-Saharan Africa is key for the design of policies that aim to improve food security.

50|$|Caching {{behavior}} is typically {{a way to}} save excess edible food for later consumption - either soon to be eaten food, such as when a jaguar hangs a partially eaten prey in a tree to be eaten within a few days, or long term where the food is hidden and retrieved many months later. Caching is a common adaptation to seasonal changes in <b>food</b> <b>availability.</b> In regions where winters are harsh, <b>food</b> <b>availability</b> typically becomes low, and caching food during the times of high <b>food</b> <b>availability</b> in the warmer months provides a significant survival advantage.

40|$|Accurate {{prediction}} of the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationship requires adequate {{understanding of the}} interactions among species in a community. Effects of species diversity on ecosystem functioning are usually considered more pronounced with increasing functional dissimilarity, although species within functional groups may also perform non-identical functions and interact with each other. Here we present results of a laboratory experimental study aimed at elucidating whether interspecific interactions among species within a single nematode trophic group, bacterivores, (1) affect population development and community structure, and (2) depend on <b>food</b> <b>availability.</b> We studied the population growth of Rhabditis (Pellioditis) marina, a rhabditid nematode known to favour very high food densities when in monoculture, and of Diplolaimelloides meyli and D. oschei, congeneric Monhysteridae known to perform better in monocultures at intermediate <b>food</b> <b>availability.</b> Both Diplolaimelloides species showed significantly different patterns of food-density dependence in combination culture compared to monoculture. At very high <b>food</b> <b>availability,</b> the rhabditid nematode facilitated growth of both monhysterid species, probably {{as a result of}} down-regulation of bacterial density. At the lowest <b>food</b> <b>availabilities,</b> the presence of even low numbers of monhysterid nematodes lead to exclusion of the rhabditid, which at such low <b>food</b> <b>availability</b> has a very inefficient food uptake. At intermediate <b>food</b> <b>availabilities,</b> abundances of both Diplolaimelloides species were strongly depressed in the combination culture, as a result of food depletion by the rhabditid, indirect inhibitory interactions between the two congeneric species, or both. The complexity of the species interactions render predictions on the outcome and functional consequences of changes in within-trophic-group diversity highly problematic...|$|R

This is accounted to the increasing amount of wild Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) and the reduction of primary production of phytoplankton.
