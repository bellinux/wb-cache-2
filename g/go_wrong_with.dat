Belt, who now manages the shuttle program, dismisses the agents' concerns and states {{that nothing can}} possibly <b>go</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> the mission. He allows the agents to watch the launch from Mission Control. The launch is successful. As the agents are leaving however, Generoo informs them that contact is lost with the shuttle in orbit. While driving back to Mission Control, Generoo sees the face come at her through her windshield, causing her to crash her car.|$|E

When {{it comes to the}} 'Catalogue of all catalogues that don't list themselves', {{the librarian}} cannot include it in its own listing, because then it would include itself, and so belongs to the other catalogue, that of catalogues that do include themselves. However, if the librarian leaves it out, the catalogue is incomplete. Either way, it can never be a true master catalogue of catalogues that do not list themselves.|$|E
25|$|A {{well trained}} soldier could fire {{up to three}} rounds per minute, {{and the use of}} the platoon {{formation}} by the British army meant that a constant volley of fire could be employed. There was much that could <b>go</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> the musket– from misfires in wet weather, to the gun firing at random due to sparks which set the powder off. In the heat of battle a soldier may forget to remove the ramrod from the barrel before firing. Nonetheless, the musket proved to be an overall reliable weapon which's performance, especially when used en masse, should not be underestimated. Even though contemporary writers often state that a musket's effective range when firing at an individual target did not go beyond 30 paces, modern test firings at individual human-sized targets suggest that a musket's effective range lies somewhere between 70 and 100 yards.|$|E

500|$|The {{controversy}} over New Melones Dam {{was one of}} the most heated environmental disputes in the U.S. at the time. The dam was constructed at a time of growing public support for environmental preservation, as compared to development or utilitarian conservation of natural resources. Friends of the River describes the campaign against the dam as [...] "probably the biggest citizen effort to save a river and stop a dam in American history." [...] The Bureau of Reclamation itself has called New Melones [...] "a case study of all that can <b>go</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> a project." [...] Although opponents of the dam were ultimately unsuccessful, the campaign greatly strengthened the political power of the river conservation movement in California and the rest of the United States; in California, a number of later dam projects were defeated by citizen opposition, including a hydroelectric project on the nearby Tuolumne River which was canceled less than two years after New Melones Dam was completed.|$|E
500|$|The {{income from}} the concerts did not permit generous {{rehearsal}} time. Wood had nine hours to rehearse all the music for each week's six concerts. To gain the best results on so little rehearsal, Wood developed two facets of his conducting that remained his trademark throughout his career. First, he bought sets of the orchestral parts and marked them all with minutely detailed instructions to the players; secondly he developed a clear and expressive conducting technique. An orchestral cellist wrote that [...] "if you watched him, you couldn't come in wrong." [...] The violist Bernard Shore wrote, [...] "You may be reading at sight in public, but you can't possibly <b>go</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> that stick in front of you". Thirty-five years after Wood's death, André Previn recounted a story {{by one of his}} players who recalled that Wood [...] "had everything planned out and timed to the minute ... at 10a.m. precisely his baton went down. You learned things so thoroughly with him, but in the most economical time." ...|$|E

500|$|New Melones Dam {{has come}} under even greater {{controversy}} than Shasta Dam, {{mainly because of the}} project's conflicts with federal and state limits {{and its impact on the}} watershed of the Stanislaus River. The original Melones Dam, submerged underneath New Melones Lake (hence the name New Melones Dam) is the source of one of these problems. The disused Melones Dam blocks cold water at the bottom of the lake from reaching the river, especially in dry years when the surface of the lake is closer to the crest of the old dam. This results in the river below the dam attaining a much higher temperature than usual, hurting native fish and wildlife. To solve this problem, Reclamation shuts off operations of the dam's hydroelectric power plant when water levels are drastically low, but this results in power shortages. Originally, after the dam was constructed, the State of California put filling the reservoir on hold because of enormous public opposition to what was being inundated: the limestone canyon behind the dam, the deepest of its kind in the United States, contained hundreds of archaeological and historic sites and one of California's best and most popular whitewater rafting runs. Thus the reservoir extended only to Parrot's Ferry Bridge, [...] below its maximum upriver limit, until the El Niño event of 1982-1983, which filled it to capacity within weeks and even forced Reclamation to open the emergency spillways, prompting the state and federal governments to repeal the limits they had imposed on the reservoir. Furthermore, the project allows a far smaller sustainable water yield than originally expected, and Reclamation calls the dam [...] "a case study of all that can <b>go</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> a project".|$|E

2500|$|Other {{orthodox}} Marxists or economists {{inspired by}} Marx (including Karl Kautsky, Mikhail Tugan-Baranovsky, Nikolai Bukharin, Rudolf Hilferding, Rosa Luxemburg, Vladimir Lenin, Otto Bauer, Fritz Sternberg, Natalia Moszkowska, Paul Sweezy, Kozo Uno and Makoto Itoh) provided alternative crisis theories, focusing variously on the anarchy of capitalist production, sectoral disproportions, underconsumption and realization problems, labor-shortage and population pressures, credit insufficiency, excess capital and wages squeezing profits. According to Professor Costas Lapavitsas, [...] "both Hilferding and Lenin – indeed {{most of the}} leading Marxists of their time – treated crises as complex and multifaceted phenomena {{that could not be}} reduced to a simple theory of the rate of profit to fall. The notion that the normal state of capitalist production is to malfunction due to a persistently excessive organic composition of capital, or even due to falling 'surplus' absorption, would have been alien to classical Marxists." [...] Implicitly or explicitly, it was argued by these Marxist economists that economic crises, although they are a fairly regular occurrence in the last two centuries of capitalist development, do not all have exactly the same causes. There are all sorts of things that can <b>go</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> capitalism, throwing the markets out of kilter.|$|E
2500|$|Madeline's {{characterization}} {{received a}} mixed response from video game critics. In their book New Trends in Software Methodologies, Tools and Techniques, professors Hamido Fujita and Paul Johannesson argued that Madeline {{was a good}} role model for girls, due to her use of problem solving, critical thinking, and logic skills throughout the games to achieve her objectives. The Record said that her [...] "spirit and enthusiasm are well-suited to the coaching and teaching role" [...] she adopts throughout the series. Bishop asserted the games had the [...] "bounce and charm" [...] of other ventures within the Madeline franchise. Kathy Yakal of PC Magazine wrote that [...] "Madeline's warmth as a host" [...] made the series [...] "a nice, gentle activity platform for younger children." [...] Kawamoto thought Madeline was a [...] "feisty female lead", he felt the games had the potential to be [...] "equally enjoyable for boys and girls", but Abel noted in a separate article in the same magazine that the series is [...] "especially appealing to girls" [...] due to the choice of protagonist. Reviewers from Children's Software Revue wrote the games are [...] "popular with girls", while a writer from SuperKids said Madeline was [...] "the epitome of the strong young female", and editor of the publication Warren Buckleitner commented that [...] "you can't <b>go</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> this solid program." ...|$|E
2500|$|His next posting, {{starting}} 25 September 1879, was to [...] as Flag Captain to Sir Leopold McClintock, {{commanding the}} North American squadron. Northampton {{was a new}} ship {{with a number of}} innovations, including twin screws, searchlights and telephones, as well as being armed with torpedoes. It was fitted with an experimental Thompson-designed compass, which the inventor was on hand to adjust. Three days were spent attempting and failing to adjust the compass, with Thomson becoming increasingly bad tempered, until it was noticed that by accident the degree card had only been marked with 359 degrees instead of 360. The ship was fitted with a new design of lamp created by Captain Philip Colomb, who came on board to inspect them. As a joke, Fisher arranged for anything that could <b>go</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> the lamps to do so, sending Colomb away disheartened over his invention (although Fisher officially reported favourably about the lamps). On another occasion, the naval hospital at Halifax requested some flags to fly for the Queen's birthday. Fisher obliged, but sent only yellow and black flags signifying plague and quarantine. On the other hand, he worked hard at improving his ship. As reported by his second in command, Commander Wilmot Fawkes, the ship carried out 150 runs with torpedoes in a fortnight, whereas the whole rest of the navy only performed 200 in a year.|$|E

2500|$|The 1980s saw {{controversy}} surround The Century. The {{building was}} purchased in 1982 by an investment group and {{a proposal that}} thirteen months would have created a cooperative corporation of The Century. The proposal offered to sell the building, purchased for $36 million, to the tenants for $110 million. That proposal was quickly nixed by the New York State Attorney General's Office but it engendered a long running [...] "kill or be killed relationship" [...] between the building's tenants and its owners. In 1983 tenants accused owners of neglecting to maintain the property and sought court action against the owners. Lawyers representing about 200 tenants described the building as a slum [...] "with crumbling walls both inside and out, vermin infestation, extensive leaks, and virtually everything else that can <b>go</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> a structure." [...] The move was one in a tenant-owner dispute that would last until 1989 when an agreement was finally reached. The New York Times called the dispute, [...] "one of the longest, bitterest conversion fights in Manhattan apartment house history." [...] It ended with a compromise that allowed tenants in 229 of the 410 apartments to purchase their apartments at prices which were estimated to be one half or one third the market rate. By February 1989 several of the apartments new owners had sold their individual properties at profits exceeding $1,000,000. The investment group that purchased the building in 1982, Century Apartment Associates, saw their investment rise in value from $36 million to around $140 million.|$|E
