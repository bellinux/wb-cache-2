5|$|Toxic {{blue-green algae}} blooms are a {{reasonably}} common occurrence in the lake. Warnings about coming {{into contact with}} the water are released when an algal bloom is detected. Attempts are being made to limit the amount of phosphates entering the lake in the hope of improving its water quality. Blue-green algae (more correctly cyanobacteria) produce toxins, which can be <b>harmful</b> <b>for</b> humans and any other animals that come in contact with the contaminated water. There have been several cases of dogs being affected after playing in and drinking the lake water.|$|E
5|$|While high {{metallicity}} {{is beneficial}} {{for the creation}} of terrestrial extrasolar planets, an excess amount can be <b>harmful</b> <b>for</b> life. Excess metallicity may lead to the formation {{of a large number of}} gas giants in a given system, which may subsequently migrate from beyond the system's frost line and become hot Jupiters, disturbing planets that would otherwise have been located in the system's circumstellar habitable zone. Thus, it was found that the Goldilocks principle applies to metallicity as well; low-metallicity systems have low probabilities of forming terrestrial-mass planets at all, while excessive metallicities cause a large number of gas giants to develop, disrupting the orbital dynamics of the system and altering the habitability of terrestrial planets in the system.|$|E

5|$|Another event which {{attracted}} {{much debate}} was the Supreme Court's annulment of the 1946 war crimes conviction of Gregorij Rožman. Rožman was the Catholic bishop of Ljubljana {{who had been}} found guilty of war crimes and treason during World War II {{as a result of}} his collaboration with Italian and German occupation forces. Several attempts during the 1990s to review the trial had failed. This had led to Janša's government changing the law, enabling the religious communities to request a review of trials of their deceased members, something which had previously been reserved only for close relatives. After the Archdiocese of Ljubljana initiated the review, the Supreme Court annulled the 1946 trial on procedural grounds, effectively rehabilitating Rožman, a decision that caused much controversy. This proved <b>harmful</b> <b>for</b> Peterle's campaign, as he was closely associated with the Catholic Church. When asked about the Rožman case in a TV debate, Peterle confined himself to remarking that he was a supporter of the rule of law, that the war had divided the nation and that Rožman had played some part in that.|$|E

25|$|Despite these findings, many {{therapists}} {{and other professionals}} maintain that simultaneous bilingualism can be <b>harmful</b> <b>for</b> a child's cognitive development.

Some bilingual families have chosen to stop speaking a language after hearing about the supposed negative developmental effects of child bilingualism from people in authority.|$|E

25|$|Two Canadian {{studies have}} shown that the natural trans fat vaccenic acid, found in beef and dairy products, could {{actually}} be beneficial compared to hydrogenated vegetable shortening, or a mixture of pork lard and soy fat, by lowering total and LDL and triglyceride levels. A study by the US Department of Agriculture showed that vaccenic acid raises both HDL and LDL cholesterol, whereas industrial trans fats only raise LDL without any beneficial effect on HDL. In light of recognized evidence and scientific agreement, nutritional authorities consider all trans fats equally <b>harmful</b> <b>for</b> health and recommend that consumption of trans fats be reduced to trace amounts.|$|E

The juice will be extracted out by a juice extraction system. The outer skin, seed, stem, and fiber of fruits would be separated from the juice in a process known as pulping. Once separated, the juice and the pulp from the tomato get filtered and processed into ketchup. A smoother ketchup consistency is achieved through more filtering and screenings, weeding out any excess pulp.|$|E
25|$|Although {{conscientiousness}} {{is generally}} {{seen as a}} positive trait to possess, recent {{research has suggested that}} in some situations it may be <b>harmful</b> <b>for</b> well-being. In a prospective study of 9570 individuals over four years, highly conscientious people suffered {{more than twice as much}} if they became unemployed. The authors suggested this may be due to conscientious people making different attributions about why they became unemployed, or through experiencing stronger reactions following failure. This finding is consistent with perspectives which see no trait as inherently positive or negative, but rather the consequences of the trait being dependent on the situation and concomitant goals and motivations.|$|E

Between 20% and 30% of melanomas develop from moles. People with light skin are at higher risk as are those with poor immune function such as from medications or HIV/AIDS. Diagnosis is by biopsy.|$|E
25|$|From an {{evolutionary}} psychology perspective, different fears {{may be different}} adaptations that have been useful in our evolutionary past. They may have developed during different time periods. Some fears, such as fear of heights, may be common to all mammals and developed during the mesozoic period. Other fears, such as fear of snakes, may be common to all simians and developed during the cenozoic time period. Still others, such as fear of mice and insects, may be unique to humans and developed during the paleolithic and neolithic time periods (when mice and insects become important carriers of infectious diseases and <b>harmful</b> <b>for</b> crops and stored foods).|$|E

25|$|Producing rice in paddies is <b>harmful</b> <b>for</b> the {{environment}} {{due to the}} release of methane by methanogenic bacteria. These bacteria live in the anaerobic waterlogged soil, and live off nutrients released by rice roots. Researchers have recently reported in Nature that putting the barley gene SUSIBA2 into rice creates a shift in biomass production from root to shoot (above ground tissue becomes larger, while below ground tissue is reduced), decreasing the methanogen population, and resulting in a reduction of methane emissions of up to 97%. Apart from this environmental benefit, the modification also increases the amount of rice grains by 43%, which makes it a useful tool in feeding a growing world population.|$|E
25|$|The {{launches}} {{have been}} met with resistance from the locals living nearby. Fear has also been <b>harmful</b> <b>for</b> local tourism and business. Residents {{of the city of}} Paju living near the launch site of Imjingak tried to stop balloons from being launched in October 2014 by blocking the way with tractors. The locals were joined by left-wing activists supporting rapprochement. However, a small group of North Korean defector activists managed to break away and launch 20,000 leaflets from the nearby town of Gimpo. Launching balloons is not illegal, but the South Korean police sometimes intervenes. Some of the failed balloon release attempts have ended in clashes with the South Korean police and activists, such as Park Sang-hak being detained in April 2015.|$|E
25|$|High {{levels of}} sulfur in diesel are <b>harmful</b> <b>for</b> the {{environment}} because they prevent {{the use of}} catalytic diesel particulate filters to control diesel particulate emissions, {{as well as more}} advanced technologies, such as nitrogen oxide (NOx) adsorbers (still under development), to reduce emissions. Moreover, sulfur in the fuel is oxidized during combustion, producing sulfur dioxide and sulfur trioxide, that in presence of water rapidly convert to sulfuric acid, one of the chemical processes that results in acid rain. However, the process for lowering sulfur also reduces the lubricity of the fuel, meaning that additives must be put into the fuel to help lubricate engines. Biodiesel and biodiesel/petrodiesel blends, with their higher lubricity levels, are increasingly being utilized as an alternative.|$|E
