40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the notion of}} a jobs guarantee (JG) that is bestowed on each individual as a right of citizenry. Central to a JG economy is the notion that <b>full</b> employment with <b>inflation</b> control is both possible and desirable. Unlike a liberal economy, which has used the deficiency of demand {{over the last two decades}} to manage price stability, a JG economy controls inflation by manipulating the ratio of employees that are in the private labor sector vis-à-vis the elastic public labor market. The JG labor sector, unlike the private labor market, is underwritten by the state acting as an employer of last resort. The paper makes a case illustrating that although a JG economy is superior to a liberal economy, political impediments would render the scheme inoperative, owing to organized labor's resistance to how a JG economy (1) controls inflation and (2) stabilizes balance of payments disequilibrium. The paper concludes with an alternative examination illustrating that <b>full</b> employment with <b>inflation</b> control is possible, though only if certain post-liberal institutions are established. Post-liberal institutions are a prerequisite, in other words, if full employment and price stability are to be achieved.

40|$|Reduction {{in total}} lung {{capacity}} (TLC) in obese men is associated with restricted expansion of the thoracic cavity at <b>full</b> <b>inflation.</b> We hypothesized that thoracic expansion was reduced by the load imposed by increased total trunk fat volume or its distribution. Using MRI, we measured internal and subcutaneous trunk fat and total abdominal and thoracic volumes at <b>full</b> <b>inflation</b> in 14 obese men [mean age: 52. 4 yr, body mass index (BMI) : 38. 8 (range: 36 – 44) kg/m 2] and 7 control men [mean age: 50. 1 yr, BMI: 25. 0 (range: 22 – 27. 5) kg/m 2]. TLC was measured by multibreath helium dilution and was restricted (< 80 % of the predicted value) in six obese men (the OR subgroup). All measurements were made with subjects in the supine position. Mean total trunk fat volume was 16. 65 (range: 12. 6 – 21. 8) liters in obese men and 6. 98 (range: 3. 0 – 10. 8) liters in control men. Anthropometry and mean total trunk fat volumes were similar in OR men and obese men without restriction (the ON subgroup). Mean total intraabdominal volume was 9. 41 liters in OR men and 11. 15 liters in ON men. In obese men, reduced thoracic expansion at <b>full</b> <b>inflation</b> and restriction of TLC were not inversely related to a large volume of 1) intra-abdominal or total abdominal fat, 2) subcutaneous fat volume around the thorax, or 3) total trunk fat volume.

In conclusion, this study failed to support the hypotheses that restriction of TLC or impaired expansion of the thorax at <b>full</b> <b>inflation</b> in middle-aged obese men was simply a consequence of a large abdominal volume or total trunk fat volume or its distribution...|$|E

Two hypotheses are as follows: 1) increased abdominal volume prevents full descent of the diaphragm; and 2) increased intrathoracic fat reduces space for full lung expansion. We have measured total intrathoracic volume at <b>full</b> <b>inflation</b> using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 14 asymptomatic obese men [mean age 52 yr, body mass index (BMI) 35 – 45 kg/m 2] and 7 control men (mean age 50 yr, BMI 22 – 27 kg/m 2). MRI volumes were compared with gas volumes at TLC. All measurements were made with subjects supine. Obese men had smaller functional residual capacity (FRC) and FRC-to-TLC ratio than control men. There was a 12 % predicted difference in mean TLC between obese (84 % predicted) and control men (96 % predicted). In contrast, differences in total intrathoracic volume (MRI) at <b>full</b> <b>inflation</b> were only 4 % predicted TLC (obese 116 % predicted TLC, control 120 % predicted TLC), because mediastinal volume was larger in obese than in control [heart and major vessels (obese 1. 10 liter, control 0. 87 liter, P = 0. 016) and intrathoracic fat (obese 0. 68 liter, control 0. 23 liter, P 80 % predicted (ON) was 26 % predicted TLC.

40|$|This paper briefly {{discusses}} {{the causes and}} consequences of financial dollarization with special reference to the recent Turkish experience. Most developing countries have a limited, unofficial form of dollarization, which makes them vulnerable to external shocks through currency mismatches. Financial dollarization can limit the scope of macroeconomic policies and cause fear of floating. Consequently, dedollarization policies are now shifting from a generally passive stance “learning {{to live with it}} ” type approach to a more active stance such as “carrot and stick ” approach. This paper also presents a composite financial dollarization index for Turkey along with a brief discussion of corporate sector debt dollarization. The recent Turkish experience towards endogenous dedollarization appears to be consistent with the view that dedollarization can also be viewed as a side effect of prudent fiscal and monetary policies. Although the dollarization composite index is on a decreasing trend, it is however still high. Therefore, an active dedollarization strategy associated with a sound macroeconomic policy stance should be considered to support the implementation of a <b>Full</b> Fledged <b>Inflation</b> Targeting Regime in the near future...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a model in}} which the level of taxes and seignorage are too low to finance government expenditures and debt service. Government debt will therefore grow without bound, implying the eventual need to change policy. Starting with utility maximization, we analyze {{the effect of the}} expected switch on equilibrium time paths before the switch takes place. We analyze stabilization via increasing taxes, increasing money growth rates, or cutting expenditures, both under certainty and under uncertainty about the composition or timing of a stabilization. Under <b>full</b> certainty, <b>inflation</b> may rise, fall, or remain constant before the stabilization, depending on which policy tool is used to stabilize. Uncertainty solely about the composition of the stabilization will yield paths in between the above cases, with a price jump at the time of stabilization. In general there is no simple correlation between changes in the budget deficit and inflation. With uncertainty about the timing OF a stabilization, the inflation rate will most likely exhibit fluctuations and may overshoot its steady state value, even when real balances move monotonically. Uncertainty about the timing of a stabilization can therefore itself induce fluctuation in inflation, even if underlying utility and subjective probability functions are smooth. ...|$|R

The most cost-effective recontact risk mitigation is the prelaunch deployment of a drogue parachute that is released after the X- 37 ALTV has safely cleared the B- 52 H. After release, a fully-inflated drogue parachute takes 30 min to reach ground and results in a large footprint that excessively restricts the days available for flight.
