40|$|Biometric based {{authentication}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular techniques adopted in large-scale identity matching systems due to its robustness in access control. In recent years, the number of enrolments has increased significantly posing serious issues towards the performance and scalability of these systems. In addition, the use of multiple modalities (such as face, iris and fingerprint) is further increasing the issues related to scalability. This research work focuses on the development of a new Hybrid Data Storage Framework (HDSF) that would improve scalability and performance of biometric authentication systems (BAS). In this framework, the scalability issue is addressed by integrating relational database and NoSQL data store, which combines the strengths of both. The proposed framework improves the performance of BAS in three areas (i) by proposing a new biographic match score based <b>key</b> <b>filtering</b> process, to identify any duplicate records in the storage (de-duplication search); (ii) by proposing a multi-modal biometric index based <b>key</b> <b>filtering</b> process for identification and de-duplication search operations; (iii) by adopting parallel biometric matching approach for identification, enrolment and verification processes. The efficacy of the proposed framework is compared with that of the traditional BAS and on several values of False Rejection Rate (FRR). Using our dataset and algorithms it is observed that when compared to traditional BAS, the HDSF is able to show an overall efficiency improvement of more than 54 % for zero FRR and above 60 % for FRR values between 1 - 3. 5 % during identification search operations...|$|R

Design tables with normalized element values for both cases are given. The filter elements were calculated using three different design criteria: equal resistors, capacitors and impedance tapered elements.

An understanding of these artefacts {{is important in the}} design of computationally affordable, good quality equalisers. A detailed investigation into these artefacts using various forms of arithmetic, filter frequency response, input excitation and sampling frequencies is described in this thesis. Novel coefficient calculation techniques, based on the matched z-transform (MZT) were developed to minimise filter response distortion and computation for on-line implementation. It was found that MZT-based filter responses can approximate more closely to s-plane filters, than BZTbased filters, with an affordable increase in computation load. Frequency response distortions and prewarping/correction schemes at higher sampling frequencies (96 and 192 kHz) were also assessed. An environment for emulating fractional quantisation in fixed and floating point arithmetic was developed. Various <b>key</b> <b>filter</b> topologies were emulated in fixed and floating point arithmetic using various input stimuli and frequency responses. The work provides detailed objective information and an understanding of the behaviour of key topologies in fixed and floating point arithmetic and the effects of input excitation and sampling frequency. Signal disturbance behaviour in <b>key</b> <b>filter</b> topologies during coefficient update was investigated through the implementation of various coefficient update scenarios. Input stimuli and specific frequency response changes that produce worst-case disturbances were identified, providing an analytical understanding of disturbance behaviour in various topologies. Existing parameter and coefficient interpolation algorithms were implemented and assessed under fihite wordlength arithmetic. The disturbance behaviour of various topologies at higher sampling frequencies was examined. The work contributes to the understanding of artefacts in audio equaliser implementation. The study of artefacts at the sampling frequencies of 48, 96 and 192 kHz has implications in the assessment of equaliser performance at higher sampling frequencies. Allen & Heath Limite...|$|R
40|$|The contourlet {{transform}} {{was proposed}} {{to address the}} limited directional resolution of the separable wavelet transform. In order to guarantee good nonlinear approximation behavior, the directional filters in the contourlet filter bank require sharp frequency response which incurs a large support size. We seek to isolate the <b>key</b> <b>filter</b> property that ensures good approximation. In this direction, we propose filters with directional vanishing moments (DVM). These filters, we show, annihilate information along a given direction. We study twochannel filter banks with DVM filters. We provide conditions under which the design of DVM filter banks is possible. A complete characterization of the product filter is thus obtained. We propose a design framework that avoids two-dimensional factorization using the mapping technique. The filters designed, when used in the contourlet transform, exhibit nonlinear approximation comparable to the conventional filters while being shorter and therefore providing better visual quality with less ringing artifacts...|$|R

Recently, the biorthogonal coiflet (cooklet) family of wavelet filters has been constructed [2] [4], and explicit frequency domain formulae {{have been developed}} [2] in the Bernstein polynomial basis. In this paper we use the Bernstein basis for frequency domain design and construction of biorthogonal nearly coiflet wavelet bases.

40|$|In this paper, {{based on}} {{theories}} of complex adaptive systems, I {{argue that the}} main case for antitrust policy should be extended to include the criteria of "evolvability.

Both production and transaction costs are considered as part of economizing and other factors are use to consider the benefits of different industry structures. CAS analysis focuses attention on dynamics, evolution and networks. As I will show, the criteria of evolvability requires us to consider various types of direct and indirect network impacts in business that go beyond the traditional focus on production and transaction costs. These network impacts stem from the connections between transactions and relations over time and place, including how business arrangements at one time, limit or enable arrangements in the future.

The <b>key</b> <b>filter</b> performances in terms of insertion loss (as low as 1. 4 dB), operating frequency (250 - 1280 MHz), and out-of-band rejection (up to 60 dB) constitute a significant advancement over all other state-of-the-art RF MEMS technologies. The fabrication process, namely stacking of two piezoelectric AlN layers (600 nm each) and three Pt electrode layers (100 nm each), is fully compatible with the previously demonstrated AlN RF MEMS switch process (also post-CMOS compatible), which {{makes it possible to}} implement multi-frequency switchable filter banks on a single chip. The S 2 D configuration is also able to combine the balun, filter, and impedance transformer functions in a single MEMS structure and only takes on a very small form factor (60 × 200 μm).

40|$|Graph <b>filters</b> play a <b>key</b> role in {{processing}} the graph spectra of signals {{supported on the}} vertices of a graph. However, despite their widespread use, graph filters have been analyzed only in the deterministic setting, ignoring the impact of stochastic- ity in both the graph topology {{as well as the}} signal itself. To bridge this gap, we examine the statistical behavior of the two <b>key</b> <b>filter</b> types, finite impulse response (FIR) and autoregressive moving average (ARMA) graph filters, when operating on random time- varying graph signals (or random graph processes) over random time-varying graphs. Our analysis shows that (i) in expectation, the filters behave as the same deterministic filters operating on a deterministic graph, being the expected graph, having as input signal a deterministic signal, being the expected signal, and (ii) there are meaningful upper bounds for the variance of the filter output. We conclude the paper by proposing two novel ways of exploiting randomness to improve (joint graph-time) noise cancellation, as well as to reduce the computational complexity of graph filtering. As demonstrated by numerical results, these methods outperform the disjoint average and denoise algorithm, and yield a (up to) four times complexity redution, with very little difference from the optimal solution...|$|R
