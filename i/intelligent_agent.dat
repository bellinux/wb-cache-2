5|$|In {{parallel}} of {{the video}} game approach, in the media art field, Maurice Benayoun’s Virtual Reality artwork The Tunnel under the Atlantic (1995), often compared to video games, introduced a virtual film director, fully autonomous <b>intelligent</b> <b>agent,</b> to shoot and edit in real time a full video from the digging performance in the Pompidou Center in Paris and the Museum of Contemporary art in Montreal. The full movie, Inside the Tunnel under the Atlantic, 21h long, was followed in 1997 by Inside the Paris New-Delhi Tunnel (13h long). Only short excerpts where presented to the public. The complex behavior of the Tunnel’s virtual director makes it a significant precursor of later application to video games based machinimas.|$|E
25|$|<b>Intelligent</b> <b>agent</b> paradigm: An <b>intelligent</b> <b>agent</b> is {{a system}} that {{perceives}} its environment and takes actions which maximize its chances of success. The simplest intelligent agents are programs that solve specific problems. More complicated agents include human beings and organizations of human beings (such as firms). The paradigm gives researchers license to study isolated problems and find solutions that are both verifiable and useful, without agreeing on one single approach. An agent that solves a specific problem can use any approach that works – some agents are symbolic and logical, some are sub-symbolic neural networks and others may use new approaches. The paradigm also gives researchers a common language to communicate with other fields—such as decision theory and economics—that also use concepts of abstract agents. The <b>intelligent</b> <b>agent</b> paradigm became widely accepted during the 1990s.|$|E

25|$|Specified {{complexity}} is {{an argument}} proposed by Dembski and used by him in his works promoting intelligent design. According to Dembski, the concept is intended to formalize a property that singles out patterns that are both specified and complex. Dembski states that specified complexity is a reliable marker of design by an <b>intelligent</b> <b>agent,</b> a central tenet to intelligent design and which Dembski argues for in opposition to modern evolutionary theory. The concept of specified complexity {{is widely regarded as}} mathematically unsound and has not been the basis for further independent work in information theory, complexity theory, or biology. Specified complexity is one of the two main arguments used by intelligent design proponents, the other being irreducible complexity.|$|E
500|$|An <b>intelligent</b> <b>agent</b> is {{a system}} that {{perceives}} its environment and takes actions which maximize its chances of success. By this definition, simple programs that solve specific problems are [...] "intelligent agents", as are human beings and organizations of human beings, such as firms.

500|$|A recent {{objection}} of creationists to {{evolution is}} that evolutionary mechanisms such as mutation cannot generate new information. Creationists such as William A.

Dembski has argued that life demonstrates specified complexity, and proposed a law of conservation of information that extremely improbable [...] "complex specified information" [...] could be conveyed by natural means but never originated without an <b>intelligent</b> <b>agent.</b> [...] Gitt asserted that information is an intrinsic characteristic of life and that an analysis demonstrates the mind and will of their Creator.|$|E
500|$|Views superficially similar, but {{unrelated}} to Hoyle's, are thus invariably justified with arguments from analogy. The basic {{idea of this}} argument for a designer is the teleological argument, an argument {{for the existence of}} God based on the perceived order or purposefulness of the universe. A common way of using this as an objection to evolution is by appealing to the 18th-century philosopher William Paley's watchmaker analogy, which argues that certain natural phenomena are analogical to a watch (in that they are ordered, or complex, or purposeful), which means that, like a watch, they must have been designed by a [...] "watchmaker"—an <b>intelligent</b> <b>agent.</b> This argument forms the core of intelligent design, a neo-creationist movement seeking to establish certain variants of the design argument as legitimate science, rather than as philosophy or theology, and have them be taught alongside evolution.|$|E

2500|$|This {{is because}} {{electricity}} {{is different from}} all other products in {{that it must be}} produced and distributed at the exact moment that it is consumed, and in that it is essential for the functioning of a modern, industrial nation. Thus a market in electricity does not respond {{in the same way as}} the market for products which can be stored, whose purchase can be deferred, or which are not essential. Naing Win Oo and V. Miranda used <b>intelligent</b> <b>agent</b> simulation to show that in moving from a vertically integrated to a competitive electricity market, retail consumers were heavily disadvantaged and suppliers used this to steadily increase both prices and profits. This occurred even with a large number of suppliers, and in the absence of any active collusion between them.

2500|$|The {{technological}} singularity (also, simply, the singularity) is {{the hypothesis}} that the invention of artificial superintelligence will abruptly trigger runaway technological growth, resulting in unfathomable changes to human civilization. According to this hypothesis, an upgradable <b>intelligent</b> <b>agent</b> (such as a computer running software-based artificial general intelligence) would enter a [...] "runaway reaction" [...] of self-improvement cycles, with each new and more intelligent generation appearing more and more rapidly, causing an intelligence explosion and resulting in a powerful superintelligence that would, qualitatively, far surpass all human intelligence. John von Neumann first used the term [...] "singularity" [...] (c. 1950s), in the context of technological progress causing accelerating change: [...] "The accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life, give the appearance of approaching some essential singularity {{in the history of the}} race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue". Subsequent authors have echoed this viewpoint. I. J. Good's [...] "intelligence explosion" [...] model predicts that a future superintelligence will trigger a singularity. Emeritus professor of computer science at San Diego State University and science fiction author Vernor Vinge said in his 1993 essay The Coming Technological Singularity that this would signal the end of the human era, as the new superintelligence would continue to upgrade itself and would advance technologically at an incomprehensible rate.|$|E

And imagine that it had been possible to show that all these changes had resulted, first, from a tendency of the structure to vary indefinitely; and secondly, from something in the surrounding world which helped all variations in the direction of an accurate time-keeper, and checked all those in other directions; then it is obvious that the force of Paley's argument would be gone.
