5|$|South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut is a 1999 American adult {{animated}} {{musical comedy}} film {{based on the}} Comedy Central animated television series South Park. The film was directed by series creator Trey Parker and stars the regular television cast of Parker, Matt Stone, Mary Kay Bergman, and Isaac Hayes, with guest performances by George Clooney, Eric Idle and Mike Judge. The film follows the <b>four</b> <b>boys</b> Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Eric Cartman, and Kenny McCormick as they sneak into an R-rated film featuring Canadian actors Terrance and Phillip and begin cursing incessantly. Eventually, their mothers pressure the United States to wage war against Canada for allegedly corrupting their children.|$|E
5|$|The show {{follows the}} {{exploits}} of <b>four</b> <b>boys,</b> Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Eric Cartman and Kenny McCormick. The boys live in the fictional small town of South Park, located within the real-life South Park basin in the Rocky Mountains of central Colorado.

Prominent settings on the show include the local elementary school, bus stop, various neighborhoods and the surrounding snowy landscape, actual Colorado landmarks, and the shops and businesses along the town's main street, all of which are based on the appearance of similar locations in Fairplay.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of {{the early years of}} the legacy. This bequest was {{administered}} by the Corporation of London in around 1460 and a small college was founded next to Guildhall Chapel, also using the library facilities in the chapel. Despite the fact that this continued for over 70 years, the earliest certain evidence of the existence of Carpenter's Children can only be traced back to 1536, and thus it isn't clear who these boys were, what they were taught and where they lived. In 1547, under the Chantries Act the Guildhall Chapel and Library were forfeited. The funding for the <b>four</b> <b>boys</b> was also discontinued. The Corporation of London remained in control of Carpenter's estate and accounts from the next 300 years show that the money continued to be spent on children's benefits such as providing new coats to every child or providing them with access to education.|$|E
60|$|The {{next day}} it snowed again and the <b>four</b> <b>boy</b> hunters were almost in despair, for they had {{calculated}} to strike out for Firefly Lake {{as soon as it}} grew light.|$|R

60|$|The <b>four</b> <b>boy</b> hunters held a consultation, {{which almost}} {{ended in a}} quarrel. Whopper was {{determined}} to go ahead after the deer and so was Shep, while Snap and Giant insisted upon returning to the camp.|$|R

60|$|With such game {{so close}} at hand the <b>four</b> <b>boy</b> hunters were in a fever of excitement. All rushed to the shelter and got their firearms, Whopper and Giant {{throwing}} their fish and lines in a heap on the floor. For the time being the tramp was practically forgotten.|$|R
