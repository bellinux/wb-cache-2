PAMPS was found to achieve a dose-dependent inhibition of microvessel formation in the CAM assay ranging from 57 +/- 16 % inhibition at 10 micrograms/disc to 72 +/- 15 % at 150 micrograms/ disc. Also, PSS and PAS caused a strong inhibition of angiogenesis (55 +/- 19 % and 48 +/- 16 %, respectively, at 50 micrograms/disc), whereas poly(vinylsulfonic acid) (PVS) {{was found to be}} inactive at this dose.

Suramin, which was included as a reference compound, caused only a slight inhibition of vascular density, at a dose of 150 micrograms/disc, whereas pentosan polysulfate (PPS) was found to be toxic.
