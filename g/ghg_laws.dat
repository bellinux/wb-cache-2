40|$|The U. S. {{construction}} industry ranks {{third in the}} nation in its production of carbon dioxide emissions. Increasing global pressure towards developing emissions reduction strategies is bound to affect the {{construction industry}}. The objective of this thesis was to develop a tool to estimate the carbon footprint of construction projects associated with transportation infrastructure. The tool determines emissions from an inventory of equipment, construction processes, and credits efforts to reduce emissions, while incorporating recent and future greenhouse gas (GHG) policies on quantifying emissions. This tool will enable construction companies to identify sources and reduce emissions, while also allowing state agencies to monitor these companies in accordance with <b>GHG</b> <b>laws.</b> The tool was applied to data associated with the construction of the Intercounty Connector, a new roadway that will connect counties in Maryland. Application of the tool to this case study showed its utility and highlighted the need for reduction strategies...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} {{greenhouse}} gas emissions has become a global focus, but few studies have considered saline-alkali paddy fields. Gas samples and saline-alkali soil samples were collected during the green, tillering, booting, heading and grain filling stages. The emission fluxes of CO 2, CH 4, and N 2 O {{as well as the}} pH, soil soluble salt, available nitrogen, and soil organic carbon contents were detected to reveal the greenhouse gas (<b>GHG)</b> emission <b>laws</b> and influence factors in saline-alkali paddy fields. Overall, GHG emissions of paddy soil during the growing season increased, then decreased, and then increased again and peaked at booting stage. The emission fluxes of CO 2 and CH 4 were observed as having two peaks and a single peak, respectively. Both the total amount of GHG emission and its different components of CO 2, CH 4, and N 2 O increased with the increasing reclamation period of paddy fields. A positive correlation was found between the respective emission fluxes of CO 2, CH 4, and N 2 O and the available nitrogen and SOC, whereas a negative correlation was revealed between the fluxes of CO 2, CH 4, and N 2 O and soil pH and soil conductivity. The study is beneficial to assessing the impact of paddy reclamation on regional greenhouse gas emissions and is relevant to illustrating the mechanisms concerning the carbon cycle in paddy soils...|$|R
5000|$|Because EPA's {{authority}} to regulate GHG emissions has such significant implications for the economy, the environment, and our society at large, it is a topic of interest to {{a broad range of}} organizations including Congress, the courts, the states, environmental organizations, and the regulated industry. All of these entities have had a direct hand in shaping the laws, regulations, and policies concerning GHGs into what they are today and will likely continue {{to do so in the}} future. As discussed above, California has played a large role in shaping the motor vehicle regulations. EPA's {{authority to}} regulate GHGs under the CAA is also a topic of continuing political debate in both chambers of Congress. On January 21, 2010, Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) introduced a disapproval resolution under the Congressional Review Act, which would have nullified EPA's endangerment finding. The resolution was defeated by a vote of 53-47, with six Democrats voting in favor of it. Later that year on March 4, Senator Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) introduced a bill that would suspend for two years any EPA action to regulate CO2 or CH4 under the CAA except for the vehicle standards under section 202. He re-introduced similar legislation on January 31, 2011, the same day Senator John Barrasso (R-WY) introduced broad legislation to preempt regulation of <b>GHGs</b> under federal <b>law.</b> On February 2, 2011, Representative Fred Upton (R-MI), Representative Ed Whitfield (R-KY), and Senator James Inhofe (R-OK) released a draft bill, which would amend the CAA to, [...] "prohibit the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency from promulgating any regulation concerning, taking action relating to, or taking into consideration the emission of a greenhouse gas due to concerns regarding possible climate change, and for other purposes." ...|$|R
5000|$|On November 23, 2009, Premier Jean Charest {{announced}} {{targets for}} reducing greenhouse gases during the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen. Quebec will cut its emissions by 20% {{by the year}} 2020 compared to international reference of 1990. On January 14, 2010, a new law came into force to reduce greenhouse gases from automobiles which represent 40% of Quebec <b>GHGs.</b> This new <b>law</b> stipulates that car manufacturers serving the territory of Quebec must meet an emission ceiling of 187 grams of GHG/km or approximatively 7.7 L/100 km. This level must be reduced annually up to 127 grams of GHG/km or approximatively 5.3 L/100 km in 2016. These standards are as stringent as those in California (United States), according to the Government of Quebec. The provincial government plans to offer up to $8,000 rebate towards the purchase of an electric car. The government hopes that by 2020, a quarter of cars purchased in Quebec will be electric. The plan would position Quebec as a world leader in electrified transportation according to Jean Charest. Quebec became the first region in North America to set a carbon tax. Since 2007, consumers pay a special tax on gasoline. Since July 2011, Quebec has imposed a carbon tax that affect more than 85% of industries in the province. This tax will be mandatory from 2013. The sectors affected by this carbon tax will have to reduce their carbon dioxide below 25 000 kilotonnes per year. Only the forest industry, agriculture and waste industries are not affected by this tax. In addition, the Quebec government plans to recover 60% of putrescible organic matter by 2015 {{in order to reduce}} its emissions. Quebec climate policy has been harshly criticised by the federal government under Prime minister Stephen Harper. In 2010, former minister Jim Prentice has openly criticized Quebec's plan to set GHG standards for motor vehicles sold in the province, describing it as [...] "lunatic". However, ten months later, Prentice successor, John Baird, has praised Quebec as a world leader in GHG abatement.|$|R
