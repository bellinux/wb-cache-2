40|$|Increased {{demand on}} power transformers, {{due to the}} {{extension}} of equipment lifetimes and a trend to lower costs, {{has led to a}} need for condition based maintenance. However, there are currently no established techniques to accurately monitor and diagnose faults in real-time while the transformer is on-line. A major factor in the degradation of transformer insulation is partial discharging which, if left unattended, will eventually cause complete insulation failure. A partial discharge detection system (PDDS) is presented for electrically identifying partial discharge pulses and determining the number of partial discharge sources while the transformer is on-line and subjected to external <b>interference.</b> <b>Current</b> and <b>voltage</b> transducers are placed on the transformer bushings rendering it unnecessary for the transformer to be disconnected or opened. Partial discharge pulses are identified within narrowband and pulse interference using digital signal processing techniques which include an automated Fourier domain threshold filter and a continuous wavelet directional coupling filter. If multiple sources are active, the partial discharge pulses are grouped by a clustering neural network. Two 7. 5 kVA, 11 kV transformers were used to conduct testing of the PDDS. High recognition rates of artificial partial discharge pulses were achieved in an off-line transformer, while a previously unknown natural partial discharge source was identified in the second energised transformer...|$|R
40|$|Interference {{represents}} {{one of the most striking}} manifestation of quantum physics in low-dimensional systems. Despite evidences of quantum interference in charge transport have been known for a long time, only recently signatures of <b>interference</b> <b>induced</b> thermal properties have been reported, paving the way for the phase-coherent manipulation of heat in mesoscopic devices. In this work we show that anomalous thermoelectric properties and efficient heat rectification can be achieved by exploiting the phase-coherent edge states of quantum Hall systems. By considering a tunneling geometry with multiple quantum point contacts, we demonstrate that the interference paths effectively break the electron-hole symmetry, allowing for a thermoelectric charge current flowing either from hot to cold or viceversa, depending on the details of the tunnel junction. Correspondingly, an <b>interference</b> <b>induced</b> heat <b>current</b> is predicted, and we are able to explain these results in terms of an intuitive physical picture. Moreover, we show that heat rectification can be achieved by coupling two quantum Hall systems with different filling factors, and that this effect can be enhanced by exploiting the interference properties of the tunnel junction.
