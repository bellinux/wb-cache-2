40|$|The Golden Apple Snail (GAS) or Pomacea canaliculata {{as it is}} scientifically known, is a major pest of paddy. It can {{be managed}} by using {{cultural}} techniques, biological control and synthetic molluscicides. While bio-pesticide is an effective and safer alternative, economical mass production can be a constraint. In Sabah, the planting of Acacia mangium is an agroforestry initiative in the paper pulp industry, and efforts to recycle its industrial byproduct are suggested. Therefore this study aims to screen the beneficial phytochemical compounds of Acacia mangium, to test its molluscicidal activity, and to determine the effective dosage that can cause mortality on GAS. Phytochemical screenings of Acacia mangium methanol extract from the leaves, flower, and bark detected the presence of saponin, a class of chemical compound reported to be toxic to snails. The bark was particularly chosen due to its abundant availability as a processing byproduct. The molluscicidal activity was tested using dip bio-assay experiment. The test solution was prepared by mixing ground Acacia mangium bark with distilled water and the concentration was adjusted to 25 mg/ml, 50 mg/ml, 75 mg/ml, and 100 mg/ml respectively. <b>Furcraea</b> selloa var. marginata, a plant that {{has been reported to}} be toxic to GAS was used as positive control and prepared with similar concentrations while distilled water was used as negative control.

40|$|Great {{advances}} {{have been made}} in our understanding of the phylogeny and classification of Agavaceae in the last 20 years. In older systems Agavaceae were paraphyletic due to overemphasis of ovary position or habit. Discovery of a unique bimodal karyotype in Agave and Yucca eventually led to a reexamination of concepts and relationships in all the lilioid monocots, which continues to the present day. Developments in cytogenetics, microscopy, phylogenetic systematics, and most recently DNA technology have led to remarkable new insights. Large-scale rbcL sequence studies placed Agavaceae with the core Asparagales and identified closely related taxa. Analysis of cpDNA restriction sites, rbcL, and ITS nrDNA sequences all supported removal of Dracaenaceae, Nolinaceae, and clarified relationships. Agavaceae s. s. presently consists of Agave, Beschorneria, <b>Furcraea,</b> Hesperaloe, Hesperoyucca, Manfreda, Polianthes, Prochnyanthes, and Yucca. In this paper we analyze recently obtained ndhF sequence data from Agavaceae and Asparagales and discuss the implications for classification. Parsimony analysis of ndhF data alone resolves most genera of Agavaceae and supports the inclusion of Camassia, Chlorogalum, Hesperocallis, and Hosta within Agavaceae s. l. Analysis of combined ndhF and rbcL data sets of selected Asparagales results in better resolution and stronger bootstrap support for many relationships. Combination of all available ndhF, rbcL, and ITS data in a single analysis results in the best resolution currently available for Agavaceae s. l.

40|$|Cancer {{is known}} as the second major {{mortality}} cause. The number of new cases is increasing every year. Thus, it is urgent for scientists to search for alternative drugs with selective antitumor action and minimal side effects. It is known that some plant metabolites exhibit antioxidant, cytotoxic, and antitumor activity, {{while at the same time}} being less toxic than modern allopathic drugs. In this work, we have investigated the cytotoxic and apoptosis-inducing effects of extracts obtained from plants of the family Asparagaceae on A 549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells. The analysis has been performed using flow cytofluorometry. If extracts showed cytotoxicity, the apoptosis-inducing action has been evaluated at the concentration of 50 μg/mL; in other cases, the analyzed concentration range was 50 – 300 μg/mL. On the basis of the experiments carried out, the following conclusions have been made. Extracts of the leaves and rhizomes of Sansevieria cylindrica and Sansevieria trifasciata do not possess antitumor activity. Extracts of the leaves of Polianthes tuberosa and <b>Furcraea</b> gigantea, which were cytotoxic at high concentrations, cause cell death at 50 μg/mL in the amount of 21. 35 ± 1. 86 and 15. 6 ± 3. 23, respectively.

When the concentration reaches 100 μg/mL, the proportion of apoptotic cells for these plants is 45. 76 ± 1. 34 and 11. 33 ± 0. 07, respectively. The number of dead cells at the concentration of 300 μg/mL increased up to 73. 33 ± 3. 05 and 81. 75 ± 4. 07.
