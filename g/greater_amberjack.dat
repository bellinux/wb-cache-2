5000|$|The {{black jack}} lives both in {{solitude}} and in schools {{of up to}} 30 individuals. Like several other jacks, black jack are able to coordinate these aggregations over coral reefs based on the release of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) from the reef. DMSP is a naturally occurring chemical produced by marine algae {{and to a lesser}} extent corals and their symbiotic zooxanthellae. In the Atlantic the species has also been video-recorded schooling with the almaco jack, Seriola rivoliana, and the <b>greater</b> <b>amberjack,</b> Seriola dumerili. The diet of the species has been reported on two occasions; once from Easter Island in the south Pacific, where the diet consisted mainly of fish and crustaceans including stomatopods and isopods; and from Brazil, where a variety of fish, crustaceans and molluscs were taken. There is also some suggestion that in Brazil the species may be competing for food with the red snapper, Lutjanus campechanus, with both having almost identical diets. The black jack is also known to follow spinner dolphins to feed off their excrements. The life history of the species has been determined in part from the waters of Jamaica. Here the Male:Female sex ratios have been reported as 1:0.55, indicating males are nearly twice as common than females. [...] The black jack reaches sexual maturity at 34.6 cm in females and 38.2 cm in males. The timing of spawning is poorly known, with occurrences recorded in February, April, May and July to September. The reproductive behaviour and early life history of the species is entirely unknown. Analysis of black jack catches suggest the average length of the fish is 50 cm for males and 48 cm for females.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this paper}} was to {{describe}} the distribution of non-specific immune parameters in two fish species considered as new candidates for aquaculture diversification, <b>greater</b> <b>amberjack</b> and blackspot seabream. In particular, haemolysins, haemagglutinins and lysozyme were investigated to monitor their changes induced by two different stressors: 1) an experimental challenge of <b>greater</b> <b>amberjack</b> with the bacterial pathogen Listonella (Vibrio) anguillarum, which simulated an acute stress condition, and 2) a 14 -day starvation period in blackspot seabream, which simulated a chronic stress condition. For each experiment, unstressed fish were kept and sacrificed at the same time intervals to be used as controls. In <b>greater</b> <b>amberjack</b> an increase in lysozyme was detected in challenged fish compared to control ones, while haemolytic activity and haemagglutinating titres showed a depressive effect following to the challenge.

40|$|The <b>greater</b> <b>amberjack</b> Seriola dumerili {{is a large}} teleost {{fish with}} rapid growth and {{excellent}} flesh quality, whose domestication represents an ambitious challenge for aquaculture. The occurrence of reproductive dysfunctions in <b>greater</b> <b>amberjack</b> reared in captivity was investigated by comparing reproductive development of wild and captive-reared individuals. Wild and captive-reared breeders were sampled in the Mediterranean Sea during three different phases of the reproductive cycle: early gametogenesis (EARLY, late April-early May), advanced gametogenesis (ADVANCED, late May-early June) and spawning (SPAWNING, late June-July). Fish reproductive state was evaluated using the gonado-somatic index (GSI), histological analysis of the gonads and determination of sex steroid levels in the plasma, and correlated with leptin expression in the liver and gonad biochemical composition. The GSI and sex steroid levels were lower in captive-reared than in wild fish. During the ADVANCED period, when the wild <b>greater</b> <b>amberjack</b> breeders were already in spawning condition, ovaries of captive-reared breeders showed extensive atresia of late vitellogenic oocytes and spermatogenic activity ceased in the testes of half of the examined males. During the SPAWNING period, all captive-reared fish had regressed gonads, while wild breeders still displayed reproductive activity. Liver leptin expression and gonad proximate composition of wild and captive <b>greater</b> <b>amberjack</b> were similar. However, the gonads of captive-reared fish showed different total polar lipid contents, as well as specific lipid classes and fatty acid profiles with respect to wild individuals. This study underlines {{the need for an}} improvement in rearing technology for this species, which should include minimum handling during the reproductive season and the formulation of a specific diet to overcome the observed gonadal decrements of phospholipids, DHA (22 : 6 n- 3) and ARA (20 : 4 n- 6), compared to wild breeders...|$|E

The {{first part of the}} research (trial 1 and 2) was designed to determine the efficacy of clove oil as an anaesthetic alternative to MS- 222. In trial 1, the minimum concentration of anaesthetic producing the total loss of muscular tone within 3 min, and recovery within 10 min, was determined. The obtained results showed that MS- 222 and clove oil were effective as anaesthetics for juveniles of blackspot sea-bream and <b>greater</b> <b>amberjack</b> at concentrations of 40 and 100 mg L- 1, respectively. The aim of trial 2 was to assess the side-effects of both anaesthetics on <b>greater</b> <b>amberjack</b> juveniles by monitoring serum cortisol and glucose levels, and haematocrit values. No significant differences between anaesthetics were found for most of the measured physiological variables. The second part of research (trial 3) was designed to establish the ability of anaesthesia to mitigate stress responses blocking activation of the HPI axis associated to handling stress. In this trial, the stress responses to handling of adult blackspot sea-bream anaesthetised with either anaesthetics were compared to those of unanaesthetised fish used as controls. Serum cortisol and glucose concentrations were used as stress indicators. Both anaesthetics were unable to block activation of the HPI axis that occurs as a consequence of handling stress in blackspot sea-bream, although anaesthesia with both anaesthetics proved to be effective in reducing the duration of stress response...|$|E

Distribution and abundance of fishes associated with Sargassum mats in the NW Gulf of Mexico were examined off northern (Galveston) and southern (Port Aransas) Texas from May-August, 2000. A total of 37 species (17 families) was identified from larval purse seine collections. Individuals from seven species composed over 97 % of the catch: planehead filefish (Monacanthus hispidus), blue runner (Caranx crysos), gray triggerfish (Balistes capriscus), chain pipefish (Syngnathus louisianae), sergeant major (Abudefduf saxatilis), sargassum fish (Histrio histrio), and <b>greater</b> <b>amberjack</b> (Seriola dumerili). Sizes were variable throughout the sampling period; however, over 95 % of the species collected were in the early life stages. Temporal patterns were observed for several taxa; M. hispidus, S. louisianae, and H. histrio were more abundant in early summer (May-June), while C. crysos and A. saxatilis were more prominent late in the season (July-August). Abundance of dominant taxa was higher in northern waters and both abundance and diversity increased as a function of distance from shore. Distribution, age, and growth of young-of-the-year (YOY) <b>greater</b> <b>amberjack</b> Seriola dumerili associated with pelagic Sargassum were examined offshore Galveston, TX in the NW Gulf of Mexico. A total of 181 S. dumerili (33 - 210 mm SL) was collected from May to July of 2000 and 2001. Temporal patterns of habitat use showed relative abundance of S. dumerili was greatest early in the season (May and June). In addition, spatial patterns indicated that abundance in the offshore zone (CPUE, 7. 60 ? 3. 6) was greater than the inshore zone (CPUE, 1. 27 ? 0. 5). Ages of S. dumerili ranged from 35 - 150 days and hatch-date analysis indicated that the majority of spawning occurred from February to April. Average daily growth rates were 1. 45 mm d?? throughout the sampling period, while both spatial and temporal differences in growth rates were observed. Mortality estimates were 0. 0045 (0. 45 % d??) for S. dumerili between 40 and 139 days of age.

Stomach content {{analysis}} showed three different phases of predation during this period, {{depending on the size}} variation of the specimens. Cluster analysis suggested prey choice differed within three size groups. Class I (individuals up to 80 mm SL) feed mainly on the zooplankton community (Copepoda and Crustacea larvae). Class II (individuals ranging from 80 to 120 mm SL) represent a transition stage in which fish continue to feed on zooplankton, but benthic and nectonic items also become important. Class III (individuals greater than 120 SL mm) feed mainly on nectonic and nectobenthic items. Fish belonging to the size class II showed the highest value of niche breadth. The role of the Cymodocea nodosa system is stressed as an energy supply of invertebrate and vertebrate food items, especially to the size class II, in which fish shift from a planktivorous to a piscivorous diet.

40|$|Knowledge {{of mercury}} {{concentrations}} in fish {{is essential for}} human health protection. Mercury is a naturally occurring element {{that acts as a}} neurotoxin to humans and other species. The biologically available mercury form, methylmercury (MeHg), bio accumulates from small benthic invertebrates to large pelagic fish, and therefore high end consumers and terminal predators have elevated Hg concentrations. The main pathway of MeHg exposure in humans is by consumption of contaminated fish. In this study total Hg concentrations were measured in 10 Gulf of Mexico pelagic fish species using a DMA 80 analyzer. Total Hg concentrations ranged from 0. 004 to 3. 55 ppm (wet wt). The highest mean concentration (1. 04 ppm, wet wt) recorded in king mackerel (Scomberomorus cavalla) exceeded FDA recommended criteria of 1 ppm. Dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus) and vermilion snapper (Rhomboplites aurorubens) had lowest mean Hg concentrations (< 0. 3 ppm).

However, component by component analysis did not show {{statistically significant differences between}} P. balearicus and P. grandispinus. Molecular data based on rITS 2 and mCO 1 gene sequences also supported the separation into four species. Morphological and molecular data were used to examine phylogenetic relationships between Paradeontacylix species from S. dumerili and other species in the genus. The results coincided in revealing two main branches with P. kampachi + P. ibericus and (((P. grandispinus + P. balearicus) Paradeontacylix sanguinicoloides) Paradeontacylix godfreyi). Paradeontacylix odhneri, for which little data are available, was located basal in a separate branch. This is the only species of Paradeontacylix which parasitizes a non-carangid host which might probably explain the separation from the other species. Paired similarities between the Japanese and the Mediterranean species, despite the large geographic distance, could be explained by the speciation of parasite geminate lines before host separation by tectonic events. Consequently, geographic and historical isolation support the morphological and genetic differences leading to the evolution of the new species described here. [URL]...|$|E

A survey questionnaire was administered in the summer and fall of 1994 by interviewers in face-to-face meetings with owners or operators of randomly selected boats. Fishermen were asked for background information about themselves and their boats, their capital investments in boats and equipment, and about their average catches, revenues, and costs per trip for their two most important kinds of fishing trips during 1993 for species in the reef fish fishery. Respondents were characterized with regard to their dependence on the reef fish fishery as a source of household income. Boats were described in terms of their physical and financial characteristics. Different kinds of fishing trips were identified by the species that generated the greatest revenue. Trips were grouped into the following categories: yellowtail snapper (Ocyurus chrysurus); mutton snapper (Lutjanus analis), black grouper (Mycteroperca bonaci), or red grouper (Epinephelus morio); gray snapper (Lutjanus griseus); deeper water groupers and tilefishes; <b>greater</b> <b>amberjack</b> (Seriola dumerili); spiny lobster (Panulirus argus); king mackerel (Scomberomorus cavalla); and dolphin (Coryphaena hippurus). Average catches, revenues, routine trip costs, and net operating revenues per boat per trip and per boat per year were estimated for each category of fishing trips. In addition to its descriptive value, data collected during this study will aid in future examinations of the economic effects of various regulations on commercial reef fish fishermen.

40|$|Three {{continuous}} {{cell lines}} were established: JSKG from gonads of Japanese striped knife jaw Oplegnathus fasciatus, KRE from embryos of {{a hybrid of}} kelp Epinephelus moara and red spotted grouper E. akaara, and PAS from the skin of <b>greater</b> <b>amberjack</b> (also called purplish amberjack) Seriola dumerili; these cell lines were passed 60, 89, 120 times, respectively. Although initially cultured in Leibovitz's L- 15 medium, two of the cell lines, JSKG and PAS, exhibited optimal growth response in Eagle's minimum essential medium buffered {{with a combination of}} tris and sodium bicarbonate. These cell lines were initiated at a higher NaCl concentration of 0. 206 M but gradually adapted to the low NaCl concentration of 0. 116 M after several subcultures. Optimum growth temperature was 25 ℃ for JSKG and PAS cells, and 30 ℃ for KRE cells. The modal chromosome number is 83 for the JSKG cell line, 92 for the KRE cell line, and 96 for the PAS cell line. Results for efficiency of plating indicate that all three cell lines are composed of transformed cells. Cell lines JSKG and PAS are susceptible to nine fish viruses, including channel catfish virus (CCV) and chum salmon virus (CSV). The KRE cell line is susceptible to CCV and fish rhabdoviruses of the vesiculovirus group. None of the cells showed cytopathic effect for Oncorhynchus masou virus (OMV) or Herpesvirus salmonis. Yields of infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV), infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV), hirame rhabdovirus (HRV), and CSV were relatively low in these cell lines...|$|E
40|$|Two {{new species}} of teleost blood fluke {{belonging}} to the sanguinicolid genus Paradeontacylix are described from the <b>greater</b> <b>amberjack,</b> Seriola dumerili, i. e. Paradeontacylix ibericus n. sp. from the Iberian Peninsula and Paradeontacylix balearicus n. sp. from the Balearic Islands. P. ibericus n. sp. and P. balearicus n. sp. show morphological similarities with Paradeontacylix kampachi and Paradeontacylix grandispinus respectively, which occur in mixed infection in S. dumerili from Japan. Multivariate analysis of morphometrical data provided statistical evidence for the separation of four species. However, component by component analysis did not show {{statistically significant differences between}} P. balearicus and P. grandispinus. Molecular data based on rITS 2 and mCO 1 gene sequences also supported the separation into four species. Morphological and molecular data were used to examine phylogenetic relationships between Paradeontacylix species from S. dumerili and other species in the genus. The results coincided in revealing two main branches with P. kampachi + P. ibericus and (((P. grandispinus + P. balearicus) Paradeontacylix sanguinicoloides) Paradeontacylix godfreyi). Paradeontacylix odhneri, for which little data are available, was located basal in a separate branch. This is the only species of Paradeontacylix which parasitizes a non-carangid host which might probably explain the separation from the other species. Paired similarities between the Japanese and the Mediterranean species, despite the large geographic distance, could be explained by the speciation of parasite geminate lines before host separation by tectonic events. Consequently, geographic and historical isolation support the morphological and genetic differences leading to the evolution of the new species described here...|$|E
