40|$|My master's {{thesis is}} focused on {{grounding}} of HV switchgear. The aim of this work {{is to create a}} computer program intended for dimensioning of earthing networks. The earthing networks are the most convenient alternative in term of effective grounding and distribution of ponential. They are based on latiny a flat conductor network cables and connection of appliance parts to network. Introduction of the thesis is dedicated to explanation of grounding theory and to description of requirements essential for properly designed earthing system (dimensioning of earthing system). Following chapter brings description of computer program algorithm testing propriety of an assigned <b>earthing</b> <b>network</b> for a particular switchgear. The chapter also contains description of an user interface and explanation of all features, included in the program.

40|$|International Standards IEC 61936 - 1 and EN 50522 {{define a}} global {{earthing}} system (GES) as the <b>earthing</b> <b>network,</b> {{created by the}} interconnection of local earthing systems that should guarantee the absence of dangerous touch voltages. Despite that, standards do not provide any official practical guidelines for its identification. The official classification of GES areas {{would lead to a}} simplification of the design and verification procedures of medium voltage/low voltage (MV/LV) substations grounding systems with associated economical savings for both distribution system operators and MV users. To overcome this regulatory vacuum, several teams of researchers proposed methods to identify the presence of a GES. In this paper, the main methods developed to identify a GES are presented. The different methodologies are applied to a real urban scenario and compared...|$|E

40|$|International Standards IEC 61936 - 1 and EN 50522 {{define a}} Global Earthing System (GES) as the <b>earthing</b> <b>network,</b> {{created by the}} {{interconnection}} of local earthing systems, that should guarantee the absence of dangerous touch voltages. This is achieved through two effects: {{the division of the}} earth fault current between many earthing systems {{and the creation of a}} quasi equipotential surface. The second effect can be enhanced by the presence of buried metallic parts, such as light poles and water/gas pipelines, that can modify the earth surface potential profile. In order to characterize these buried conductors, an extensive measurement campaign was organized; in order to determine the resistance to earth of these buried conductors a simplified measurement protocol has been applied to more than 800 metallic objects. In this paper, the measurement set-up, the results and their analysis are reporte...|$|E
40|$|In {{shipboard}} installations ungrounded earthing {{is selected}} {{because it provides}} continuous power supply, even {{in the case of}} single-phase earth faults, which cannot be accomplished by low resistance earthing in the neutral point of wye-connected generator or transformer windings. However the electric network is actually earthed via the high impedance capacitances of all the equipment installed onboard. Therefore, as already discussed in literature, the 'ungrounded' earthing type of shipboard installations has to be treated as 'grounded' via capacitive elements. This paper aims to show, for the first time, an analytical description of statements given in previous publications, ie, that in all analyses performed, it is the entire zero sequence (homopolar) impedance that has to be taken into account. This homopolar impedance includes, among others, leakage capacitances of the entire electrical installation. Therefore, an investigation of the influence of the zero sequence impedance is performed in representative case studies, all referring to unbalanced operating conditions. Within this frame, analytical expressions of voltages and currents with respect to zero sequence impedance are yielded. Moreover, the significant adverse effects of leakage capacitances on the occasion of an actual ship <b>earthing</b> <b>network,</b> are highlighted...|$|E
40|$|The {{power of}} modal {{analysis}} reaches {{far beyond the}} structural dynamics domain which has nurtured its development. One of the areas where it has scarcely – if ever- been applied is in the electromagnetic dynamics of electrical machine windings. Because {{of the use of}} power-electronic drives, it transpires that these systems are seeing excitation at frequencies which are in the same order as resonances and a modal approach is highly relevant. Current electromagnetic dynamics models contain strong frequency-dependent properties which can be replaced by suitable discretisations and model reduction which retains modal fidelity is central. Component-mode synthesis methods also have much to offer in the modelling of the drive, cable, motor and <b>earthing</b> <b>network</b> system and in enabling measured characteristics to be substituted for component models. Identification methods based on modal parameters can apply directly but most importantly, the concept of modal participation factors at the terminals is pivotal since all excitation of these complex dynamic systems must pass through these degrees of freedom which are very few in number. This paper attempts to build an initial bridge to make the advances in structural modal analysis accessible to an engineering discipline which can benefit greatly...|$|E

40|$|As part of {{my final}} year studies I was {{fortunate}} enough to participate in an Internship program with Leighton Contractor’s. During the internship I was placed in a small electrical design team, responsible for the design and procurement of the Mumbida Wind Farm project. The Mumbida Wind Farm is being constructed as a turnkey package by a consortium agreement with Leighton Contractors and General Electric (GE) Energy. With a bachelor in engineering with majors in renewable energy and power engineering – this project was perfect; combining elements of both majors. The following report provides a background on the successful operation of Leighton Contactors and their involvement on the Mumbida Wind Farm. In addition it details the work performed by myself as an intern including the tools and methodology used to do so. The 5 core tasks of the internship include; · Meteorological Mast Design & Installation · SCADA System Management · 22 kV Counterpoise Cable Design · Primary Electrical Equipment Procurement · Wind Farm <b>Earthing</b> <b>Network</b> Design In addition to these points I was involved in a number of administrative and general duty activities which will be discussed later. Each task was required to be completed over the 16 week between September 2 nd and December 23 rd 2011. In order to successfully reach this deadline I was required to apply knowledge obtained during my studies as well as develop new skills in the workplace. This was mostly done so with the cooperation and guidance of team members Surendran Nair and Siva Vadiveloo. As detailed in the report, each task did have its own challenges and problems – fortunately all were eventually satisfied as required. The internship itself can be considered just as successful having developed the industry skills to apply myself as a prominent engineer of the future...|$|E
40|$|Earthing of {{electrical}} installations {{is a complicated}} task upto some extent. It requires to follow necessary guide lines to achieve the most correct results. But in Sri Lanka, we don't have particular standards to follow when earthing circuit is designed. According to the assets to be protective from the required earthing circuit, it is designed and implemented. Large assets like power plants, substations and large factories etc. are protected by a well designed <b>earthing</b> <b>network.</b> Most probably this design includes, a reputed contractor who is using necessary software makes calculations etc. and a design is submitted. This submission is then reviewed by a consultant. When the implementation stage it is well. supervised and :finally it is tested at the commissioning of the said asset. When {{it comes to the}} domestic earthing, the engineer or technician uses his own experience to make the electrical system earthed. At this level most probably no calculations are done, no commissioning tests are done but the system is earthed to achieve a some earth resistance. This achievement is somewhat acceptable when the assets to be protected is considered. But when we take medium scale assets like distribution substations, auto re-closures etc., there are no common accepted standards for designing and implementation of earthing systems. Even in the Ceylon Electricity Board and LECO, there is no proper set of guide lines to be followed when it is going to design and implementation an earthing circuit for the same. Therefore the technology being used for implementation of earthing circuit is not related with the assets to be protective when these medium scale assets are considered. The purpose of this project is to develop a protocol which can be acceptable in making these earthing of medium scale asset...|$|E

A majority of the lightning-caused deaths in Sri Lanka has occurred among the working community with low income which forces them to live in areas and houses which are vulnerable to lightning.
