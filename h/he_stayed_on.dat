5|$|After the Seven Years' War, Zieten {{retired from}} active service, widely {{considered}} a hero. During the War of the Bavarian Succession, Frederick forbade him to go, so <b>he</b> <b>stayed</b> <b>on</b> his estate at Wustrau with his niece, Johanna von Blumenthal, whose son was serving in his regiment. During this period she gathered his reminiscences for a biography.|$|E
5|$|Duke of Marmalade raced {{against his}} stable {{companion}} Dylan Thomas {{again in the}} Irish Champion Stakes at Leopardstown in September. He led into the straight before being overtaken by Dylan Thomas, and although he had no chance with the winner <b>he</b> <b>stayed</b> <b>on</b> to take second ahead of notable winners such as Red Rocks (Breeders' Cup Turf), Maraahel (Hardwicke Stakes) and Finsceal Beo (1000 Guineas). O'Brien {{was pleased with the}} run and said that Duke of Marmalade was still improving. On his final start of the year he was brought back to one mile for the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes in which he led until the last quarter mile, setting a strong pace, before finishing third to Ramonti and Excellent Art.|$|E
5|$|For {{his last}} two starts of the year, Fantastic Light was sent to East Asia. In November, in the Japan Cup <b>he</b> <b>stayed</b> <b>on</b> {{strongly}} in the closing stages to finish a close third, beaten a neck and a nose by T M Opera O and Meisho Doto. Dettori reportedly felt that the slow pace {{was the reason for}} his defeat. Despite three successive defeats, Fantastic Light still managed to end the season with a major victory. In December he was sent to Sha Tin for the Hong Kong Cup and justified favouritism by leading in the straight and staying on strongly to beat Greek Dance and Jim and Tonic. The win earned Fantastic Light top place in the Emirates World Series, a competition in which points were awarded for performances in a number of international races.|$|E

5|$|In 1755, Kościuszko began {{attending}} school in Lyubeshiv, but never finished {{due to his}} family's financial straits after his father's death in 1758. Poland's King Stanisław August Poniatowski established a Corps of Cadets (Korpus Kadetów) in 1765, at what is now Warsaw University, to educate military officers and government officials. Kościuszko enrolled in the Corps on December 18, 1765, likely thanks to the patronage of the Czartoryski family. The school emphasized military subjects and the liberal arts, and after graduating on December 20, 1766, Kościuszko was promoted to chorąży (a military rank roughly equivalent to modern lieutenant); <b>he</b> <b>stayed</b> <b>on</b> as a student instructor and by 1768 had attained the rank of captain.|$|E
5|$|Penfold {{was born}} to Alfred and Florence (née Green) in 1944 and educated at Sutton Grammar School for Boys, where <b>he</b> <b>stayed</b> <b>on</b> until 19. He left school with A-levels in French, German, and geography, and took casual {{employment}} to earn money. Having a desire {{to make use of}} his language qualifications, he began applying for jobs at multi-national companies. He applied to Her Majesty's Civil Service and passed the civil service exam, but was keen to join the Foreign Service. He took and passed a second exam to join the Foreign Service, but had to enter at a lower grade than he would have held in the Civil Service.|$|E
5|$|As America's {{involvement}} in World War II intensified, Motley joined the U.S. Navy in 1944 {{and was sent}} to the Great Lakes Naval Training Station. There he played for the Great Lakes Navy Bluejackets, a military team coached by Paul Brown, who was serving in the Navy during an extended leave from his job as head coach of The Ohio State University's football team. Motley played fullback and linebacker at Great Lakes, and was {{an important component of the}} team's offense and defense. The highlight of his time at Great Lakes was a 39–7 victory over Notre Dame in 1945. Motley was eligible for discharge before the game – it was the final match of the season and the last military game of World War II – but <b>he</b> <b>stayed</b> <b>on</b> to play. Motley put up an impressive performance, thanks in part to Brown's experimentation with a new play: a delayed handoff later called the draw play.|$|E

5|$|Clough was {{appointed}} as manager at Third Division Brighton & Hove Albion on 1 November 1973, with Taylor joining as his assistant. Just after the pair were appointed, the team lost 4–0 {{at home to}} Walton & Hersham in an FA Cup replay and then 8–2 at home to Bristol Rovers on 1 December. Brighton finished 19th in the final table in the 1973–74 season, narrowly avoiding relegation to the Fourth Division, and the pair began to rebuild the team by signing Peter Grummitt, Andy Rollings, Ian Mellor, Steve Govier, and Ken Goodewe; Taylor felt that Clough never settled at Brighton however, and {{spent too much time}} away on media commitments. Clough left for Leeds United in July 1974, but Taylor refused to go with Clough as he felt Brighton and club chairman Mike Bamber had treated them well, and so the partnership ended after nine years as Taylor stayed at the Goldstone Ground as sole manager. He went on to sign striker Peter Ward and midfielder Brian Horton, but admitted that both he and Clough were much more effective as a duo; he felt that he had struggled to make the good players he signed play to their full potential whilst feeling that Clough had bought and sold poorly as Leeds manager. <b>He</b> <b>stayed</b> <b>on</b> at the South coast club for a further two seasons, guiding the team to a fourth-place finish in 1975–76, missing promotion by two points. His successor, Alan Mullery, managed to lead the team Taylor left behind to promotion in 1976–77 and then into the top-flight in 1978–79.|$|E
5|$|Still {{enduring}} is {{the debate}} {{as to why}} Voss chose to fight on against clearly almost impossible odds rather than disengage from the action. However, {{it is possible that}} he wanted to close the kill gap between himself and the Red Baron, by shooting down some British aircraft, so <b>he</b> <b>stayed</b> <b>on.</b> Although Voss's apparent refusal to retreat is not mentioned in the contemporary English combat reports, nor in McCudden's autobiography written in June and July 1918, McCudden is credited with the observation that Voss seemingly rejected several opportunities to disengage and withdraw from the tactically grave situation in which he found himself. In 1942 Hector Bolitho and James Ira Thomas Jones received letters from both Chidlaw-Roberts and Bowman concerning their recall of Voss's last stand. Bowman read and savaged the Chidlaw-Roberts account for its inaccuracies, although his own account had obvious errors. At the same time Bowman also stated that he believed Voss had an opportunity to disengage and save himself, but had deliberately chosen instead to fight in spite of the overwhelmingly unequal situation with which he was faced. This is the earliest positively identified historical source for the assertion that Voss rejected chances for a safe retreat that were open to him. The dogfight remains a subject of debate and controversy among combat aviation historians and interested parties.|$|E
