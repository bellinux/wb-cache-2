One of the biggest challenges of wide adoption of distributed data storage is how to store these data securely. In this work, we study the frequency-based attack, a type of attack that is different from previously well-studied ones, that exploits additional adversary knowledge of domain values and/or their exact/approximate frequencies to crack the encrypted data. To cope with frequency-based attacks, the straightforward 1 -to- 1 substitution encryption functions are not sufficient. We propose a data encryption strategy based on 1 -to-n substitution via dividing and emulating techniques to defend against the frequency based attack, while enable efficient query evaluation over encrypted data. We further develop two frameworks, incremental collection and clustered collection, which are used to defend against the global frequency-based attack when the knowledge of the global frequency in the network is not available. Built upon our basic encryption schemes, we derive two mechanisms, direct emulating and <b>dual</b> encryption, to <b>handle</b> updates on the data storage for energy-constrained sensor nodes and wireless devices.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{considers}} jointly optimal {{design of}} crosslayer congestion control, routing and scheduling for ad hoc wireless networks. We first formulate the rate constraint and scheduling constraint using multicommodity flow variables, and formulate resource allocation in networks with fixed wireless channels (or single-rate wireless devices that can mask channel variations) as a utility maximization problem with these constraints. By dual decomposition, the resource allocation problem naturally decomposes into three subproblems: congestion control, routing and scheduling that interact through congestion price. The global convergence property of this algorithm is proved. We next extend the <b>dual</b> algorithm to <b>handle</b> networks with timevarying channels and adaptive multi-rate devices. The {{stability of the}} resulting system is established, and its performance is characterized with respect to an ideal reference system which has the best feasible rate region at link layer. We then generalize the aforementioned results to a general model of queueing network served {{by a set of}} interdependent parallel servers with time-varying service capabilities, which models many design problems in communication networks. We show that for a general convex optimization problem where a subset of variables lie in a polytope and the rest in a convex set, the dual-based algorithm remains stable and optimal when the constraint set is modulated by an irreducible finite-state Markov chain. This paper thus presents a step toward a systematic way to carry out cross-layer design in the framework of “layering as optimization decomposition ” for time-varying channel models. I...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} the interaction and transport of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) through the arterial endothelium in rat aorta and coronary artery, by perfusing in situ native, untagged human, and rat LDL. The latter was rendered electron-opaque after it interacted with the endothelial cell and was subsequently fixed within tissue. We achieved LDL electron-opacity by an improved fixation procedure using 3, 3 '-diaminobenzidine, and mordanting with tannic acid. The unequivocal identification of LDL was implemented by reacting immunocytochemically the perfused LDL with anti LDL-horseradish peroxidase conjugate. Results indicate that LDL {{is taken up}} and internalized through two parallel compartmented routes. (a) A relatively small amount of LDL is taken up by endocytosis via: (i) a receptor-mediated process (adsorptive endocytosis) that involved coated pits/vesicles, and endosomes, and, probably, (ii) a receptor-independent process (fluid endocytosis) carried out by a fraction of plasmalemmal vesicles. Both mechanisms bringing LDL to lysosomes supply cholesterol to the endothelial cell itself. (b) Most circulating LDL is transported across the endothelial cell by transcytosis via plasmalemmal vesicles which deliver LDL to the other cells of the vessel wall. Endocytosis is not enhanced by increasing LDL concentration, but the receptor-mediated internalization decreases at low temperature. Transcytosis is less modified by low temperature but is remarkably augmented at high concentration of LDL. While the endocytosis of homologous (rat) LDL is markedly more pronounced than that of heterologous (human) LDL, both types of LDL are similarly transported by transcytosis. These {{results indicate that the}} arterial endothelium possesses a <b>dual</b> mechanism for <b>handling</b> circulating LDL: by a high affinity process, endocytosis secures the endothelial cells' need for cholesterol; by a low-affinity nonsaturable uptake process, transcytosis supplies cholesterol to the other cells of the vascular wall, and can monitor an excessive accumulation of plasma LDL. Since in most of our experiments we used LDL concentrations above those found in normal rats, we presume that at low LDL concentrations saturable high-affinity uptake would be enhanced in relation to nonsaturable pathways...|$|R

We simply refer to them as FT-BFS (or FT-MBFS) for k= 1, and dual FT-BFS (or dual FT-MBFS) for k= 2. The problem of k FT-BFS was first studied by Parter and Peleg [ESA 13]. They designed an algorithm to compute FT-BFS subgraph of size O(n^ 3 / 2). Further, they showed how their algorithm can be easily extended to FT-MBFS requiring O(sigma^ 1 / 2 n^ 3 / 2) space.

In addition to that, the outdoor air contains excessive humidity {{due to the nature}} of the climate. Air-conditioning system is the main energy consumer of the buildings, more so with the requirement of the full 12 months cooling period in the country. The increasing demand of energy due to its status as a developing country puts Malaysia in a critical situation in terms of building sustainability. Another quandary associated with tropical environment is the indoor thermal comfort due to the high humidity. The usage of normal air-conditioning system means that the room has to be overcooled in order to bring down the humidity. Unfortunately, the low temperature set-point technique is neither comfort cautious nor energy friendly. There is an option to solve the humidity problems by the use of the outdoor air treatment system which neutralizes the incoming fresh air into the room. However, high equipment cost renders the system unfavorable in Malaysia. Therefore, the viable solution to the high latent load requires an innovative system that is affordable, runs at relatively low energy consumption yet be able to provide satisfactory indoor thermal comfort. In the research, a new air-conditioning approach termed <b>Dual</b> ABU (air <b>handling</b> unit) system is proposed to be the answer. The simplicity in arrangement and control setup ensures that the system can be reasonably priced. On top of that, it can be designed as an add-on configuration to the existing air-conditioning.

40|$|Carefree {{handling}} {{refers to}} the ability of a pilot to operate an aircraft without the need to continuously monitor aircraft operating limits. At the heart of all carefree handling or maneuvering systems, also referred to as envelope protection systems, are algorithms and methods for predicting future limit violations. Recently, envelope protection methods that have gained more acceptance, translate limit proximity information to its equivalent in the control channel. Envelope protection algorithms either use very small prediction horizon or are static methods with no capability to adapt to changes in system configurations. Adaptive approaches maximizing prediction horizon such as dynamic trim, are only applicable to steady-state-response critical limit parameters. In this thesis, a new adaptive envelope protection method is developed that is applicable to steady-state and transient response critical limit parameters. The approach is based upon devising the most aggressive optimal control profile to the limit boundary and using it to compute control limits. Pilot-in-the-loop evaluations of the proposed approach are conducted at the Georgia Tech Carefree Maneuver lab for transient longitudinal hub moment limit protection. Carefree maneuvering is the <b>dual</b> of carefree <b>handling</b> in the realm of autonomous Uninhabited Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Designing a flight control system to fully and effectively utilize the operational flight envelope is very difficult. With the increasing role and demands for extreme maneuverability {{there is a need for}} developing envelope protection methods for autonomous UAVs. In this thesis, a full-authority automatic envelope protection method is proposed for limit protection in UAVs. The approach uses adaptive estimate of limit parameter dynamics and finite-time horizon predictions to detect impending limit boundary violations. Limit violations are prevented by treating the limit boundary as an obstacle and by correcting nominal control/command inputs to track a limit parameter safe-response profile near the limit boundary. The method is evaluated using software-in-the-loop and flight evaluations on the Georgia Tech unmanned rotorcraft platform- GTMax. The thesis also develops and evaluates an extension for calculating control margins based on restricting limit parameter response aggressiveness near the limit boundary. Ph. D.

In this work, we investigate {{the suitability of}} TM- 1000 media processor and Analog Device's ADSP 21160 as a compute engine for the execution of image reconstruction algorithms. Philips Trimedia TM- 1000, a very large instruction word (VLIW) processor, is a high performance media processor optimized for real-time processing of audio, video, graphifcs, and communication data streams. TM- 1000 has a high performance digital signal processor (DSP) core, supported by multiple functional units. The DSP core and the functional blocks operate in parallel, driven by a mix of RISC, multimedia, SIMD-type DSP and floating point instructions. A typical DSP such as Analog Device's ADSP 21160 is based on super harvard architecture (SHARC) and is an optimized processor for digital signal processing applications. It has two sets of computation units. Each computation unit comprises of three functional blocks namely, arithmetic and logic unit (ALU), multiplier and shifter unit. ADSP 21160 supports single instruction multiple data (SIMD) computation model to <b>handle</b> <b>dual</b> computation units. Both sets of computation units operate concurrently. We compare the performance of TM- 1000 media processor and ADSP 21160 DSP processor to execute the image reconstruction algorithms by comparing the execution time of CBP and ART algorithms on them. The image reconstruction algorithms normally break down to a repetitive multiply-accumulate operation (MAC). All DSP processors support single-cycle MAC and zero-overhead loop instructions. The media processors normally do not support single-cycle MAC instruction and zero-overhead loop functionality. However, media processors are equipped with multiple functional units that perform multiple operations in a single instruction time. A DSP processor is expected to execute image reconstruction algorithms much faster than a multimedia processor. However, the experimental {{results show that the}} execution time on DSP and media processor are more or less same when 16 -bit representation is used for data. When floating point data is used for implementation, DSP processor has an edge. ADSP 21160 gives same execution time for both floating point and 16 -bit fixed point data. But, the execution time almost doubles when data is in floating point format on the media processor, compared to a 16 -bit implementation. This {{can be attributed to the}} fact that TM- 1000 processes two sets of operands in a single instruction time when data is in 16 -bit format.
