However, when development strategies are constructed errors of poorly defined concepts for practical and therefore activities focus only on one dimension, when they meet two what happens?

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a simple method of event encoding {{as an extension}} to a previously defined standard format, the European Data Format (EDF). The specification ensures full backward compatibility with the existing <b>definition.</b> <b>By</b> using this <b>extension,</b> the format {{can be used to}} store both continuous recordings and selected epochs of recordings. The encoding is performed in a channel of event-codes or in a pseudo-channel for annotations. Standardisation of event encoding is discussed. Decoding of events or annotations from the extendedformat is implemented at the application level. Existing programs that do not support the new encoding scheme still operate correctly and can simply ignore the new channels in processing ‘extended’ data files. The event encoding is also compatible with EDF’s capability to encode channels of different sampling frequency...|$|R

This dissertation explores the nature and state of district representation in one case study city through the lens of a newly created citizen participation program. Elected executive and council members as well as city employees were interviewed and re-interviewed over a 2. 5 year period between 1999 [...] 2002. The dissertation suggests the possibility that underlying, even motivating, citizen participation and decentralization efforts in city government is a role definition for council representatives. Through interviewing, the study found that elected officials, including council members, make a clear distinction between city-wide and district-level representation, and a majority prefer that council representation be confined to the latter. The citizen participation effort in the case study city reflects and reinforces this majority view. A minority number of representatives were aware, however, that this role <b>definition,</b> and <b>by</b> <b>extension</b> the citizen participation program, limits their reach and ultimate effectiveness on issues actually vital to their constituents. Thus, while the citizen participation effort provided some needed ward assistance, by maintaining this distinction between ward and city, citizen participation efforts may disempower representatives and citizens. Because the majority in this study regards a more powerful or far-reaching district representation as negative, preferring instead a citizen participation or administrative-based approach to representation, the study suggests citizen participation itself should be made stronger and considered from a statutory perspective akin to federal bureaucratic decision-making...|$|R

40|$|The {{fundamental}} group π of a Kodaira fibration is, <b>by</b> <b>definition,</b> the <b>extension</b> of {{a surface}} group Π_b by another surface group Π_g, i. e. 1 →Π_g →π→Π_b → 1. Conversely, we can inquire about what conditions {{need to be}} satisfied {{by a group of}} that sort in order to be the fundamental group of a Kodaira fibration. In this short note we collect some restriction on the image of the classifying map m Π_b →Γ_g in terms of the coinvariant homology of Π_g. In particular, we observe that if π is the fundamental group of a Kodaira fibration with relative irregularity g-s, then g ≤ 1 + 6 s, and we show that this effectively constrains the possible choices for π, namely that there are group extensions as above that fail to satisfy this bound, hence cannot be the fundamental group of a Kodaira fibration. In particular this provides examples of symplectic 4 [...] manifolds that fail to admit a Kähler structure for reasons that eschew the usual obstructions. Comment: 6 pages, submitte...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} a quantum mechanical three-particle system made of two identical fermions of mass {{one and a}} different particle of mass m, where each fermion interacts via a zero-range force with the different particle. In particular we study the unitary regime, i. e., the case of infinite two-body scattering length. The Hamiltonians describing the system are, <b>by</b> <b>definition,</b> self-adjoint <b>extensions</b> of the free Hamiltonian restricted on smooth functions vanishing at the two-body coincidence planes, i. e., where the positions of two interacting particles coincide. It is known that for m larger than a critical value m^* ≃ (13. 607) ^- 1 a self-adjoint and lower bounded Hamiltonian H_ 0 can be constructed, whose domain is characterized {{in terms of the}} standard point-interaction boundary condition at each coincidence plane. Here we prove that for m ∈(m^*,m^**), where m^**≃ (8. 62) ^- 1, there is a further family of self-adjoint and lower bounded Hamiltonians H_ 0,β, β∈R, describing the system. Using a quadratic form method, we give a rigorous construction of such Hamiltonians and we show that the elements of their domains satisfy a further boundary condition, characterizing the singular behavior when the positions of all the three particles coincide.

60|$|These various {{operations}} {{might be}} brought within the compass of the science, and the additional advantage be obtained {{of a very}} simple <b>definition,</b> if, <b>by</b> an <b>extension</b> of the term, sanctioned by high authorities, we were to define logic as the science which treats of {{the operations of the}} human understanding in the pursuit of truth. For to this ultimate end, naming, classification, definition, and all other operations over which logic has ever claimed jurisdiction, are essentially subsidiary. They may all be regarded as contrivances for enabling a person to know the truths which are needful to him, and to know them at the precise moment at which they are needful. Other purposes, indeed, are also served by these operations; for instance, that of imparting our knowledge to others. But, viewed with regard to this purpose, they have never been considered as within the province of the logician. The sole object of Logic is the guidance of one’s own thoughts: the communication of those thoughts to others falls under the consideration of Rhetoric, in the large sense in which that art was conceived by the ancients; or of the still more extensive art of Education. Logic takes cognizance of our intellectual operations only as they conduce to our own knowledge, and to our command over that knowledge for our own uses. If there were but one rational being in the universe, that being might be a perfect logician; and the science and art of logic would be the same for that one person as for the whole human race.|$|R
