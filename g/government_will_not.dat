Miller wants to secure the border to stop more immigrants from entering America illegally and protect the country from possible terrorist threats. Miller does not believe the millions of immigrants already here illegally should be granted amnesty. Miller supports efforts by states such as Arizona to enforce immigration laws when the federal <b>government</b> <b>will</b> <b>not,</b> and he believes illegal immigrants should be deported when they come into contact with law enforcement officials.|$|E

More credit unions will offer financing against them than against co-ownerships. They are a relatively new form of construction, designed to encourage owner occupancy by having the building's corporation hold back a percentage of the unit's share equity to ensure owner occupancy.

25|$|In general, Negev Bedouins {{have one}} of the highest school dropout rates in Israel. Between grades one and twelve, 85% of girls and 71% of boys drop out. As with many other areas, poor {{infrastructure}} (especially pronounced in the unrecognized villages, but also in the official towns) is a significant obstacle. The physical conditions of school buildings are often substandard, with many lacking in basic facilities, such as libraries, gyms, cafeterias, and heating and cooling systems. Under Israeli law, education is compulsory for all students between the ages of six and thirteen. However, indifference at the government level has meant that this law has not always been enforced with regards to the Negev Bedouin. Moreover, the <b>government</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> support infrastructure developments to schools in the unrecognized villages, as the official policy is to incentivize the relocation of the Bedouin into towns. As the building and maintenance of schools is a municipal matter, there are relatively fewer Bedouin schools (compared to the rest of Israeli society), and schools are often further away from most households.|$|E
25|$|The French army {{arrives at}} the {{barricade}} and demands that the students surrender ("At the Barricade—Upon These Stones"). Though Javert tells the students that the <b>government</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> attack that night ("Javert's Arrival"), Gavroche recognises him and quickly exposes him as a spy, and the students detain Javert ("Little People"). Their plan is to spark a general uprising with their act of defiance, hoping that {{all the people of}} Paris will side with them and overwhelm the army. Éponine returns to find Marius but is shot by the soldiers crossing the barricade. As Marius holds her, she assures him that she feels no pain and reveals her love for him before dying in his arms ("A Little Fall of Rain"). The students mourn this first loss of life at the barricades and resolve to fight in her name, and they carry her body away while Enjolras attempts to comfort Marius, who is heartbroken over Éponine's death. Valjean {{arrives at the}} barricade, crossing the government lines, disguised as a soldier ("Night of Anguish"), hoping that he might somehow protect Marius in the coming battle for Cosette's sake. The rebels are suspicious of him at first, but when the army attacks, Valjean saves Enjolras by shooting at a sniper and scaring him off, and they accept him as one of them. In return, he asks Enjolras {{to be the one to}} execute the imprisoned Javert, which Enjolras grants. But as soon as Valjean and Javert are alone, Valjean frees Javert. Javert warns Valjean that he will not give up his pursuit and rejects what he perceives as a bargain for Valjean's freedom. Valjean says there are no conditions to his release, and holds no ill-will toward Javert for doing his duty. ("The First Attack").|$|E

Kim Coco Iwamoto of the Hawaii Board of Education countered civil unions would make children in gay families {{less likely to be}} harassed. Lieutenant Governor of Hawaii Duke Aiona criticized the bill, arguing it [...] "attempts to circumvent {{the will of the people}} by authorizing the equivalent to same-sex marriage".

The paper introduces recent phenomena which further indicate that expropriation is unlikely to resurface {{in the near future}} as a source of multinational corporation-developing country contention. Many developing countries now protect foreign direct investors from expropriation. The broad-scale movement in developing countries to privatize state-owned enterprises also indicates that <b>governments</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> be eager to replace private-sector activity with state ownership...|$|R

This was Alexander Hamilton's argument in his [...] "Report on Manufactures", and the primary reason why George Washington signed the Tariff Act of 1789. Mainstream economists do concede that tariffs can in the short-term help domestic industries to develop, but are contingent on the short-term nature of the protective tariffs {{and the ability of}} the government to pick the winners. The problems are that protective tariffs <b>will</b> <b>not</b> be reduced after the infant industry reaches a foothold, and that <b>governments</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> pick industries that are likely to succeed.
