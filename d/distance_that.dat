5|$|The {{throwing}} events involve hurling {{an implement}} (such as a heavy weight, javelin or discus) from a set point, with athletes being judged on the <b>distance</b> <b>that</b> {{the object is}} thrown. Combined events involve {{the same group of}} athletes contesting a number of different track and field events. Points are given for their performance in each event and the athlete with the greatest points total at the end of all events is the winner.|$|E
5|$|A {{factor that}} {{influences}} how easy or difficult a bike {{will be to}} ride is trail, the <b>distance</b> <b>that</b> the front wheel ground contact point trails behind the steering axis ground contact point. The steering axis is the axis about which the entire steering mechanism (fork, handlebars, front wheel, etc.) pivots. In traditional bike designs, with a steering axis tilted back from the vertical, positive trail tends to steer the front wheel into {{the direction of a}} lean, independent of forward speed. This can be simulated by pushing a stationary bike to one side. The front wheel will usually also steer to that side. In a lean, gravity provides this force. The dynamics of a moving bike are more complicated, however, and other factors can contribute to or detract from this effect.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 581d orbits Gliese 581 at 0.21847 AU, {{approximately}} {{a fifth of}} the <b>distance</b> <b>that</b> the Earth orbits the Sun, though its orbital eccentricity has not been confirmed. There are currently two models for its orbit, a circular one like Earth's, and an eccentric one like Mercury's. These are based on the four planet and six planet model for the Gliese 581 system, respectively. Under the four planet model Gliese 581d would most probably be in a spin-orbit resonance of 2:1, rotating twice for each orbit of its parent star. Therefore, the day on Gliese 581d should approximately be 67 Earth days long.|$|E

5|$|In December 2010, it was {{reported}} that only 20% of the game was complete. Numerous features {{were not included in the}} final product due to time and budget constraints. The developers originally planned to add a special weapon designed to be used underwater and acquired from Chris at the end of the eight episode, but the plot of the game changed during development and the team had to discard it. Additionally, the land in the <b>distance</b> <b>that</b> can be seen from the ship in the first episode was originally going to be the setting of the last episode, where Jill would have found something from her past.|$|E
5|$|In {{front of}} Marlborough {{the rest of}} the van had mixed success. HMS Bellerophon and HMS Leviathan were both still {{suffering}} the effects of their exertions earlier in the week and did not breach the enemy line. Instead they pulled along the near side of Éole and America respectively and brought them to close gunnery duels. Rear-Admiral Thomas Pasley of Bellerophon was an early casualty, losing a leg in the opening exchanges. HMS Royal Sovereign, Graves's flagship, was less successful due to a miscalculation of <b>distance</b> <b>that</b> resulted in her pulling up too far from the French line and coming under heavy fire from her opponent Terrible. In the time it took to engage Terrible more closely, Royal Sovereign suffered a severe pounding and Admiral Graves was badly wounded.|$|E
5|$|In the 3000 m team race on {{the next}} day, Nurmi and Ritola again {{finished}} first and second, and Elias Katz secured the gold medal for the Finnish team by finishing fifth. Nurmi had won five gold medals in five events, but he left the Games embittered as the Finnish officials had allocated races between their star runners and prevented him from defending his title in the 10,000 m, the <b>distance</b> <b>that</b> was dearest to him. After returning to Finland, Nurmi set a 10,000 m world record that would last for almost 13 years. He now held the 1500 m, the mile, the 3000 m, the 5000 m and the 10,000 m world records simultaneously.|$|E

5|$|Prior {{to turning}} onto Rutgers Street, CR-506 runs along Washington Street {{concurrent}} {{with the northern}} section of Route 7. Though the northern section of Route 7 begins a few blocks south, it is not readily recognized (minimal signing). As CR-506 runs concurrently with it here, and then turns down Rutgers for the short <b>distance</b> <b>that</b> bridges {{the gap between the}} two Route 7 sections, Rutgers/506 is often viewed as if it continues Route 7, while the short portion of the northern section that lies south of Rutgers is sometimes seen as a spur, even though {{it is part of the}} main route.|$|E
5|$|The Do 217s trailed {{the fleet}} for some time, but the Italian fleet did not open fire upon {{sighting}} them; they were trailing the fleet {{at such a}} <b>distance</b> <b>that</b> {{it was impossible to}} identify them as Allied or Axis, and Bergamini believed that they were the air cover promised to them by the Allies. However, an attack upon Italia and Roma at 15:37 spurred the fleet into action, as the anti-aircraft batteries onboard opened fire and all ships began evasive maneuvers. About fifteen minutes after this, Italia was hit on the starboard side underneath her fore main turrets, while Roma was hit on the same side somewhere between frames 100 and 108. This bomb passed through the ship and exploded beneath the keel, damaging the hull girder and allowing water to flood the after engine room and two boiler rooms. The flooding caused the inboard propellers to stop for want of power and started a large amount of arcing, which itself caused many electrical fires in the aft half of the ship.|$|E

25|$|Because, {{especially}} in digital signal processing, switching frequencies {{have continued to}} rise, the demand for high frequency decoupling or filter capacitors increases. With a simple design change the ESL of a MLCC chip can be reduced. Therefore, the stacked electrodes are connected on the longitudinal side with the connecting terminations. This reduces the <b>distance</b> <b>that</b> the charge carriers flow over the electrodes, which reduces inductance of the component.|$|E
