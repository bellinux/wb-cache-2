25|$|The eigenstates are {{obtained}} by diagonalizing this matrix. This gives new eigenvectors, {{which we can}} call K1 which {{is the sum of}} the two states of opposite strangeness, and K2, which is the difference. The two are eigenstates of CP with opposite eigenvalues; K1 has CP=+1, and K2 has CP=−1 Since the two-pion final state also has CP=+1, only the K1 can decay this way. The K2 must decay into three pions. Since the mass of K2 <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> larger than the sum of the masses of three pions, this decay proceeds very slowly, about 600 times slower than the decay of K1 into two pions. These two different modes of decay were observed by Leon Lederman and his coworkers in 1956, establishing the existence of the two weak eigenstates (states with definite lifetimes under decays via the weak force) of the neutral kaons.|$|E
25|$|Based on Voyager observations, {{the total}} {{mass of the}} rings was {{estimated}} to be about 3×1019 kg. This is {{a small fraction of the}} total mass of Saturn (about 50ppb) and <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> less than the moon Mimas. More recent observations and computer modeling based on Cassini observations show that this may be an underestimate due to clumping in the rings and the mass may be three times this figure. Although the largest gaps in the rings, such as the Cassini Division and Encke Gap, can be seen from Earth, both Voyager spacecraft discovered that the rings have an intricate structure of thousands of thin gaps and ringlets. This structure is thought to arise, in several different ways, from the gravitational pull of Saturn's many moons. Some gaps are cleared out by the passage of tiny moonlets such as Pan, many more of which may yet be discovered, and some ringlets seem to be maintained by the gravitational effects of small shepherd satellites (similar to Prometheus and Pandora's maintenance of the F ring). Other gaps arise from resonances between the orbital period of particles in the gap and that of a more massive moon further out; Mimas maintains the Cassini Division in this manner. Still more structure in the rings consists of spiral waves raised by the inner moons' periodic gravitational perturbations at less disruptive resonances.|$|E
500|$|Although the IWW {{was built}} on the basis of uniting workers of industry, a rift began between the union and the Socialist Party. It started when the electoral wing of the Socialist Party, led by Victor Berger and Morris Hillquit, became irritated with speeches by Haywood. In December 1911, Haywood told a Lower East Side {{audience}} at New York's Cooper Union that parliamentary Socialists were [...] "step-at-a-time people whose every step <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> shorter than the preceding step." [...] It was better, Haywood said, to [...] "elect the superintendent of some branch of industry, than to elect some congressman to the United States Congress." [...] In response, Hillquit attacked the IWW as [...] "purely anarchistic..." ...|$|E

500|$|Phineas has {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Emily Ashby of Common Sense Media describes Phineas as [...] "boisterous," [...] {{and he and}} Ferb as [...] "partner in crime." [...] Susan Stewart, reviewing the show in the New York Times, notes that Phineas and Ferb [...] "work on a heroic scale and are apparently not limited {{by the laws of}} nature." [...] Jean Yoo, an official press member for Disney Channel, describes him as [...] "a precocious bundle of energy whose tolerance for sitting still <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> thinner than his patience for the social echelon in which he finds himself." [...] She as well notes that he is [...] "endearing and smart." ...|$|E
500|$|Duane Allman {{created the}} idea of having two lead guitarists, which was {{inspired}} by Curtis Mayfield; [...] " [...] wanted the bass, keyboards, and second guitar to form patterns behind the solo rather than just comping," [...] said Allman. Their style and incorporation of guitar harmonies was very influential on later musicians. [...] "The pair also had a wide range of complementary techniques, often forming intricate, interlocking patterns {{with each other and with}} the bassist, Berry Oakley, setting the stage for dramatic flights of improvised melodies." [...] Dickey Betts' playing was very melody-based; [...] "My style <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too smooth and round to play the blues stuff straight, because I’m such a melody guy that even when I’m playing the blues, I go for melody first," [...] he said. His listening of country and string bluegrass growing up influenced this considerably: [...] "I played mandolin, ukulele, and fiddle before I ever touched a guitar, which may be where a lot of the major keys I play come from." [...] He later characterized their style as [...] "question and answer, anticipation and conclusion," [...] which involved allowing each musician's downbeat to arrive in a different spot, while also keeping consideration of the bass guitar lines.|$|E
500|$|Warner Bros. Records premiered {{the final}} mix of [...] "Ghost" [...] for {{streaming}} on December 10, 2013, {{and the song}} became available in digital stores by January 31, 2014. A remix by house producer Claude VonStroke was released on February 18, 2014 by Spin magazine, which journalist Chris Martins named a [...] "demented dance-floor delight." [...] A day later, Vice Media's channel Noisey released a remix by New York City-based duo Solidisco, advertised to [...] "make you nostalgic for the long weekend just gone (thanks President's Day!), but super happy because Friday <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit closer than it should be." [...] Both re-workings {{were part of the}} song's remix EP that also featured remixes from Fred Falke, Thomas Newson and Viceroy. A re-cut by producer Martignetti that was not on the EP premiered on the blog Stoney Roads, who noted the song to be fitting in an episode of the HBO series Girls. [...] "Ghost" [...] was also included on the soundtrack for the game WWE 2K15, and Dubuc has admitted to being happy of being involved with the game: [...] "I've been a really big fan for a long time, and they found out I was a fan, {{and it turns out that}} some of the people that work at WWE and in the game specifically are fans of Mystery Skulls and they were like, [...] "What the fuck?
