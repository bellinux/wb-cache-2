The enzymes of this pathway were first studied in Manduca sexta, which produces both homoisoprenoid and isoprenoid (JHIII) JHs. Very early on propionate was shown to incorporate very highly efficiently into JH II and JH I in cell free extracts of M. sexta corpora allata. Mevalonate and acetate also incorporate into JH I, II, JH III from M. sexta, albeit far less efficiently that propionate. Jennings et al. showed that homomevalonate incorporates into JH II in M. sexta.Baker identified 3-hydroxy-3-ethylglutarate and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarate from the same enzyme source incubated with acetyl and propionyl-CoA. Lee et al. showed that the same source of enzymes efficiently make both mevalonate and its 3-ethyl homolog, homomevalonate. Bergot showed that the mevalonate and homomevalonate produced by these enzymes has the same 3S optical isomer configuration as the vertebrate enzymes. Baker showed that isopentenyl diphosphate, and its homolog, 3-ethyl-butenyl diphosphate (homoisopentenyl diphosphate) are metabolized to their corresponding allyic diphosphates, DMAPP and homoDMAPP (3-ethyl-3-methylallyl diphosphate). The latter is required for biosynthesis of JH I, JH II, and 4-methylJH I. 2 units of homoDMAPP are required for JH I and 4methyl JH I biosynthesis, and one for JH II biosynthesis. All parts of the carbon skeleton comes from IPP. Then an enzyme prenyl transferase/farnesyl diphosphate synthase binds IPP, strips the diphosphate off it to give an allyllic carbocation, and adds this to an IPP to give geranyl diphosphate (C10). Then it does the same thing to geranyl diphosphate, giving farnesyl diphosphate (C15). This reaction appears to be the only known enzymatic reaction involving the coupling of two molecules with a carbocation.

These methods generally assume that common compounds elute in the same order but they do not test whether this assumption holds.

However, some analytes are still challenging as HPLC shows limited resolution capabilities for highly polar analytes as they interact insufficiently on conventional reversed-phase (RP) columns.

Some highly polar sympathomimetic drugs and their metabolites showed almost no retention on different RP columns. Their retention remains poor even on phenylhexyl phases that show different selectivity due to π-π interactions. Supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) as an orthogonal separation technique to HPLC may help to overcome these issues. Selected polar drugs and metabolites were analyzed utilizing SFC separation.

A reversal of the enantiomer <b>elution</b> <b>order</b> of amlodipine was only observed with chiral stationary phases with both electron-withdrawing (chloro) and electron-donating groups (methyl) on the phenyl moieties of the chiral selector, namely cellulose tris(3 -chloro- 4 -methylphenylcarbamate) and cellulose tris(4 -chloro- 3 -methylphenylcarbamate). The highest enantioresolution (R(s) : 4. 1) value was obtained at the lowest FA concentration (0. 01 %) using cellulose tris(4 -chloro- 3 -methylphenylcarbamate) as the chiral selector and the enantiomeric impurity, R-amlodipine, eluted first under these conditions. Therefore, the mobile phase selected for the prevalidation of the method consisted of ACN/ 0. 1 % DEA/ 0. 01 % FA and the temperature was set at 25 degrees C. The method was prevalidated by means of the strategy based on the total measurement error and the accuracy profile. The method was found to be selective and the limit of quantification was found to be about 0. 05 % for R-amlodipine, while the limit of detection was close to 0. 02 %. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|A study {{into the}} {{optimisation}} and selectivity of a reversed-phase ion-interaction liquid chromatographic method for {{the separation of}} metallo-cyanide complexes is described. A stable ion-interaction system was developed in which a C 18 stationary phase was equilibrated with a 60 mM solution of tetrabutylammonium hydroxide ion-interaction reagent in order to saturate the stationary phase and to minimise retention changes caused by adsorption and desorption of this material. The effects on retention of the metallo-cyanide complexes caused by changes in pH and ionic strength were minimised through {{the addition of a}} high concentration of a phosphate buffer (150 mM) to the mobile phase. Perchlorate (0. 32 – 5. 62 mM) was then added to the mobile phase as a competing anion and its effect upon the capacity factors of each complex determined. A linear relationship between the logarithm of capacity factor and the logarithm of the concentration of perchlorate was observed, although the slopes of these plots were not accordance with those predicted by a simple ion-exchange model. However, the linearity of the data allowed a simple optimisation procedure to be applied and the concentration of perchlorate could be used to manipulate the separation selectivity of the system. Three differing <b>elution</b> <b>orders</b> of metallo-cyanide complexes were achieved by varying the concentration of perchlorate in the mobile phase within the range 0. 94 – 5. 62 mM...|$|R
40|$|Enantioselective high {{performance}} liquid chromatography (HPLC) {{coupled with a}} detection system based on the simultaneous measurement of UV absorption and electronic circular dichroism (ECD) allowsa complete stereochemical characterization of chiral compounds, once the relationship between sign of the chiroptical properties and absolute configuration is determined. In the present communication, the development of enantioselective HPLC methods for the resolution {{of a series of}} fluorinated 2 -phenanthrenylpropionic acids (1 – 6) is reported. Different chiral stationary phases (CSPs) were tested: Chiralcel® OJ, Chiralcel® OD, Chiralpak® AD, (S,S) -Whelk-O® 1, ChirobioticTM T and 1 -acid glycoprotein (AGP). The results allow the application of the methods to a reliable determination of the enantiomeric excess for all the examined compounds; the highest enantioselectivity values were obtained with the Hibar® [(S,S) -Whelk-O® 1] column for some of the examined compounds. In the case of rac- 2 -(6 -fluorophenanthren- 1 -yl) propionic acid (1), the relationship between circular dichroism and absolute configuration of the enantiomeric fractions was determined by ECD analysis and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations. The experimental ECD spectrum of the second-eluted fraction of 1 on the Hibar® [(S,S) -Whelk-O® 1] column was found to be in excellent agreement with the theoretical ECD spectrum of (S) - 1; therefore, the absolute configuration of the first- and second-eluted enantiomers on the (S,S) -Whelk-O® 1 CSP was assessed as (R) and (S), espectively, and the <b>elution</b> <b>orders</b> of the enantiomeric forms of 1 were determined on all the different CSPs...|$|R
40|$|Alkamides are {{the most}} {{abundant}} lipophilic constituents of Echinacea purpurea (L.) Moench (Asteraceae), a well-known medicinal plant, widely used as immunomodulant in the treatment and prevention of upper respiratory tract infections, such as common cold and influenza [1]. Over 20 alkamides were identified in Echinacea species, differing {{one from the other}} by the insaturation degree of the aliphatic chains. E. purpurea roots were found richer in alkamide content than aerial parts [2]. Recent studies suggested that alkamides are involved in the immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral activity of the plant, due to their high bioavailability [3]. The role of bacterial endophytes in immunomodulatory activity of E. purpurea was recently evidenced, suggesting that it could originate from its endophytic communities [4]. In order to investigate the interaction between E. purpurea and its endophytic bacterial community and the role of microbiota on the secondary metabolite production, axenic in vitro E. purpurea plants were infected with a pool of bacterial strains isolated from the aerial compartment [5]. Roots and leaves of axenic and endophyte-infected plants were extracted with n-hexane, then the methanol soluble part of these extracts was subjected to a phytochemical study. In particular, the alkamide content was analysed by HPLC coupled to a photo diode array (PDA) /UV detection and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). A total of 15 different alkamides were identified comparing their HPLC <b>elution</b> <b>orders,</b> ESI-MS/MS, and PDA/UV spectra with data reported in the literature [6]. Root and leaf extracts displayed different alkamide profiles, with leaf extract showing more alkamide constituents. On the other hand, the alkamide chemical profiles were similar in control and infected plants for both root and leaf extracts. A relative estimation of the alkamide level revealed instead a major alkamide content in endophyte-infected roots and leaves, when compared to not-infected organs, leading to suppose that alkamide biosynthesis should be modulated by endophyte infection...|$|R
