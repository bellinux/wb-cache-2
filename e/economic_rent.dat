5|$|The {{history of}} the board game Monopoly {{can be traced back}} to the early 20th century. The {{earliest}} known version of Monopoly, known as The Landlord's Game, was designed by an American, Elizabeth Magie, and first patented in 1904 but existed as early as 1902. Magie, a follower of Henry George, originally intended The Landlord's Game to illustrate the economic consequences of Ricardo's Law of <b>Economic</b> <b>rent</b> and the Georgist concepts of economic privilege and land value taxation. A series of board games were developed from 1906 through the 1930s that involved the buying and selling of land and the development of that land. By 1933, a board game had been created much like the version of Monopoly sold by Parker Brothers and its related companies through the rest of the 20th century, and into the 21st. Several people, mostly in the Midwestern United States and near the East Coast, contributed to the game's design and evolution.|$|E

The efficiency of using <b>economic</b> <b>rent</b> for taxation is (as economists agree) {{due to the fact}} that such taxation cannot be passed on and does not create any dead-weight loss, and that it removes the incentive to speculate on land. Its morality is based on the Geoist premise that private property is justified for products of labour but not for land and natural resources.|$|E

An implicit assumption of resource−based {{theory is that}} the firm’s property rights to such resources are secure. However, where property rights to potentially value−creating resources are not fully secure, as in business contexts where multiple parties are jointly participating in creating economic value, potentially value−creating combinations of resources may not be realized. Similar difficulties may arise within the firm, where multiple stakeholders that supply factor inputs are jointly producing economic value. To address these theoretical issues, we map out a property rights theory of the firm that is grounded in resource−based theory on <b>economic</b> <b>rents.</b> We emphasize how firms create <b>economic</b> <b>rents</b> (ex ante) as well as how firms appropriate or capture <b>economic</b> <b>rents</b> (ex post) ...|$|R

25|$|Although Africa and Asia {{had similar}} levels of {{income in the}} 1960s, Asia has since outpaced Africa. One school of economists argues that Asia's {{superior}} economic development lies in local investment. Corruption in Africa consists primarily of extracting <b>economic</b> <b>rent</b> and moving the resulting financial capital overseas instead of investing at home; the stereotype of African dictators with Swiss bank accounts is often accurate. University of Massachusetts Amherst researchers estimate that from 1970 to 1996, capital flight from 30 sub-Saharan countries totalled $187bn, exceeding those nations' external debts. This disparity in development {{is consistent with the}} model theorized by economist Mancur Olson. Because governments were politically unstable and new governments often confiscated their predecessors' assets, officials would stash their wealth abroad, out of reach of any future expropriation.|$|E
25|$|Economist {{and social}} {{reformer}} Henry George opposed sales taxes and protective tariffs for their {{negative impact on}} trade. He also believed in the right of each person to {{the fruits of their}} own labour and productive investment. Therefore, income from labour and proper capital should remain untaxed. For this reason many Geoists—in particular those that call themselves geolibertarian—share the view with libertarians that these types of taxation (but not all) are immoral and even theft. George stated there should be one single tax: the Land Value Tax, which is considered both efficient and moral. Demand for specific land is dependent on nature, but even more so on the presence of communities, trade, and government infrastructure, particularly in urban environments. Therefore, the <b>economic</b> <b>rent</b> of land is not the product of one particular individual and it may be claimed for public expenses. According to George, this would end real estate bubbles, business cycles, unemployment and distribute wealth much more evenly. Joseph Stiglitz's Henry George Theorem predicts its sufficiency for financing public goods because those raise land value.|$|E

Theoretical analysis reveals that the following properties help {{to make it possible}} to design a self-enforcing constitution that can settle recurring distributional disputes between social classes without civil conflict: *Neither social class has a big advantage in civil conflict. *The expected incremental costs of civil conflict are large relative to aggregate appropriable <b>economic</b> <b>rents.</b> *Both social classes are greatly concerned about the future consequences of their current actions. Theoretical analysis also reveals that a self-enforcing constitution can require limitations on the prerogatives of winners of constitutional contests such that on average the distribution of appropriable <b>economic</b> <b>rents</b> under the constitution is not too favorable to one social class or the other and such that the outcome of a constitutional contest does not matter too much for the current distribution of <b>economic</b> <b>rents.</b> ...|$|R

2500|$|Henry George is {{best known}} for his {{argument}} that the <b>economic</b> <b>rent</b> of land (location) should be shared by society. The clearest statement of this view is found in Progress and Poverty: [...] "We must make land common property." [...] By taxing land values, society could recapture the value of its common inheritance, raise wages, improve land use, and eliminate the need for taxes on productive activity. George believed it would remove existing incentives toward land speculation and encourage development, as landlords would not suffer tax penalties for any industry or edifice constructed on their land and could not profit by holding valuable sites vacant.|$|E

Georgist economists argue that all of the <b>economic</b> <b>rent</b> collected from natural resources (land, mineral extraction, fishing quotas, etc.) is unearned income, and belongs to the community rather than any individual.

2500|$|During the 1820s there {{took place}} a setpiece {{intellectual}} discussion within {{the proponents of}} political economy, often called the [...] "Malthus–Ricardo debate", after the leading figures of Malthus and David Ricardo, a theorist of free trade, both of whom had written books with the title Principles of Political Economy. Under examination were the nature and methods of political economy itself, while it was simultaneously under attack from others. The roots of the debate were in the previous decade. In The Nature of Rent (1815), Malthus had dealt with <b>economic</b> <b>rent,</b> a major concept in classical economics. Ricardo defined a theory of rent in his Principles of Political Economy and Taxation (1817): he regarded rent as value in excess of real production—something caused by ownership rather than by free trade. Rent therefore represented a kind of negative money that landlords could {{pull out of the}} production of the land, by means of its scarcity. Contrary to this concept, Malthus proposed rent {{to be a kind of}} economic surplus.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the remnant}} of the Mughal Empire revenue system {{existing}} in pre-1765 Bengal, zamindars, or [...] "land holders," [...] collected revenue {{on behalf of the}} Mughal emperor, whose representative, or diwan supervised their activities. In this system, the assortment of rights associated with land were not possessed by a [...] "land owner," [...] but rather shared by the several parties with stake in the land, including the peasant cultivator, the zamindar, and the state. The zamindar served as an intermediary who procured <b>economic</b> <b>rent</b> from the cultivator, and after withholding a percentage for his own expenses, made available the rest, as revenue to the state. Under the Mughal system, the land itself belonged to the state and not to the zamindar, who could transfer only his right to collect rent. On being awarded the diwani or overlordship of Bengal following the Battle of Buxar in 1764, the East India Company found itself short of trained administrators, especially those familiar with local custom and law; tax collection was consequently farmed out. [...] This uncertain foray into land taxation by the Company, may have gravely worsened the impact of a famine that struck Bengal in 1769-70, in which between seven and ten million people—or between a quarter and third of the presidency's population—may have died. However, the company provided little relief either through reduced taxation or by relief efforts, and the economic and cultural impact of the famine was felt decades later, even becoming, a century later, the subject of Bankim Chandra Chatterjee's novel Anandamath.|$|E

George had all the popular gifts of the American orator and journalist, with something more. Sincerity rang out of every utterance." [...] Many others agree with Hobson. George Bernard Shaw claims that Henry George was responsible for inspiring 5 out of 6 socialist reformers in Britain during the 1880s, who created socialist organizations such as the Fabian Society. [...] The controversial People's Budget and the Land Values (Scotland) Bill were inspired by Henry George and resulted in a constitutional crisis and the Parliament Act 1911 to reform of the House of Lords, which had blocked the land reform. [...] In Denmark, the Danmarks Retsforbund (known in English as the Justice Party or Single-Tax Party) was founded in 1919. The party's platform is based upon the land tax principles of Henry George. The party was elected to parliament for the first time in 1926, and they were moderately successful in the post-war period and managed to join a governing coalition with the Social Democrats and the Social Liberal Party from the years 1957–60, with diminishing success afterwards.|$|E

6000|$|The law of rent, in the {{economic}} sense, operates in the United [...] States as truly as elsewhere, {{although there is no}} separate class [...] of landlords here. With us, almost all land is owned by the [...] cultivator; so that two functions, those of the landlord and [...] farmer, are both united in one person. Although one payment is [...] made, it is still just as distinctly made up of two parts, one of [...] which is a payment to the owner for the superior quality of his [...] soil, and the other a payment (to the same person, if the owner is [...] the cultivator) of profit on the farmer’s working capital. Land [...] which in the United States will only return enough to pay a profit [...] on this capital can not pay any rent. And land which can pay more [...] than a profit on this working capital, returns that excess as [...] rent, even if the farmer is also the owner and landlord. The [...] principle which regulates the amount of that excess—which is the [...] essential point—is the principle which determines the amount of [...] <b>economic</b> <b>rent,</b> and it holds true in the United States or Finland, [...] provided only that different grades of land are called into [...] cultivation. The governing principle is the same, no matter [...] whether a payment is made to one man as profit and to another as [...] rent, or whether the two payments are made to the same man in two [...] capacities. It has been urged that the law of rent does not hold [...] in the United States, because “the price of grain and other [...] agricultural produce has not risen in proportion to the increase [...] of our numbers, as it ought to have done if Ricardo’s theory were [...] true, but has fallen, since 1830, though since that time our [...] population has been more than tripled.”(181) This overlooks the [...] fact that we have not even yet taken up all our best agricultural [...] lands, so that for some products the law of diminishing [...] productiveness has not yet shown itself. The reason is, that the [...] extension of our railway system has only of late years brought the [...] really good grain-lands into cultivation.

At the same time, Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) stocks of non-fat dry milk (NFDM) went from nothing {{to more than}} 500 million pounds. Consequently, U. S. milk producers attributed low milk prices and dairy farmer income during this period to the increased imports of MPC. U. S. milk producers were especially concerned with MPC imports for two reasons. First, MPC between 40 and 90 percent protein had been classified in subheading 0404. 90. 10 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS). Thus, MPC was {{not subject to the}} tariff-rate quotas applied to many other dairy products. Second, MPC produced in the European Union (EU) and exported to the United States was eligible for production and export subsidies. Along with the high U. S. internal milk protein prices maintained by the Dairy Price Support Program, and volatile world prices of NFDM, these policies created <b>economic</b> <b>rents</b> for trade in MPC between the European Union and the United States. To test the relationship between these policies and U.
