40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an {{adaptive}} prefetch scheme <b>for</b> <b>network</b> <b>use,</b> {{in which we}} download files that will very likely be requested in the near future, based on the user access history and the network conditions.

In the threshold module, we compute the prefetch threshold for each related server, the idea being that the access probability is compared to the prefetch threshold. An important contribution {{of this paper is}} that we derive a formula for the prefetch threshold to determine its value dynamically based on system load, capacity, and the cost of time and system resources to the user. We also show that by prefetching those files whose access probability is {{greater than or equal to}} its server's prefetch threshold, a lower average cost can always be achieved.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} in unlimited. The {{purpose of this}} study was to investigate the feasibility of using personal mobile devices for Naval e-Learning (NeL). Another objective was to find out which mobile device and which method of authentication offers the most practical and secure form of essentially bring your own device (BYOD). The use of personal mobile devices to access NeL is a form of BYOD. Finally, Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) was examined in this study as another secured means to access NeL from BYOD. This study tested the various mobile devices that were Department of Defense (DOD) approved <b>for</b> <b>network</b> <b>use.</b> The study also tested the Common Access Card (CAC) readers that are approved by DOD for CAC authentication against the approved mobile devices. Then the mobile devices and CAC readers’ functionality were tested in a VDI environment to examine the various layers of security that could be implemented when using BYOD on DOD networks to maintain the necessary level of information protection. The results of this study show the iOS devices were capable of accessing NeL training site via the approved CAC readers. However, the iOS devices could only access and enroll, they were unable to launch training due to Flash not being supported by the native browser, the language used to develop NeL training. The results also revealed attempts to use the iOS device and CAC in a VDI to be unsuccessful as a work around to the Flash issue with the iOS browser. The principal conclusion is that through the use of multi-layer security BYOD could be used to access NeL— making it truly available “whenever and wherever. ” There is also a need to look into ways authentication can be done without the use of hardware readers. Finally, there is also the need to develop training to support multiple browsers. Major, United States Marine Corp...|$|E

40|$|This thesis investigates {{potential}} energy savings {{due to the}} application of power managed PCS, monitors, and workstations. The basis of this effort includes electric metering of such equipment at six preliminary and one primary location, a large business office in Boston, Massachusetts. Metering there occurred over an 8 week period, using an in-line metering device, and at a resolution of one minute intervals. The {{results of this study}} show that many problems exist in the field today which prevent any energy savings from being realized. These include both software and hardware incompatibilities. It was found that either the equipment was not enabled from the beginning; that various problems caused inadvertent disabling of the energy saving features, or that lack of knowledge about specific power management techniques caused the user to intentionally disable the features. Since this work began, the EPA's Energy Star Computers and Monitors Program updated their requirements such that energy saving features are now enabled when they are shipped from the manufacturer. All computers tested in this investigation were installed before the application of this condition, which was October 1, 1995. However, many problems exist other than those remedied by this requirement, including: computers which disengage from the network environment upon entering the lowest power management levels, various software incompatibilities, problematic methods of achieving power reduction, and little to no training of users or even prior negative experiences with power managed equipment There is a need for manufacturers to develop suitable or standard methods of achieving power management In addition, computer procurement employees or users must be taught about power management methods, and must have an opportunity to voice questions or concerns to manufacturers regarding power managed equipment. More research needs to be focused on network incompatibilities. Specifically, many computers are disconnected from their network upon engaging the lowest power level. This is due to either unacceptable power management methods or "stand-alone" power manageable computers which are placed on a network. Users purchasing computers intended <b>for</b> <b>network</b> <b>use</b> should be informed about whether the energy saving features are compatible with their type of network. This thesis is divided into two parts, the first for PCs and the second for workstations. The primary metering site for workstations was the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which contains both Energy Star compliant and non-compliant machines. Opportunities for energy conservation in workstations are compared and contrasted to those of desktop PCs and monitors. In addition, current and future trends in workstation manufacturing and their impacts on energy conservation are explored. by Kristie L. Bosko. Thesis (M. S.)
