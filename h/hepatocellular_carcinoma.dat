40|$|Molecular {{biological}} and immunohistochemical {{analyses of the}} expression of biliary glycoprotein I (BGP I) were performed in <b>hepatocellular</b> <b>carcinomas.</b> The following results were obtained : 1.

There {{was no significant difference between}} cancerous and non-cancerous colon tissues in the expression of BGP I mRNA, which was distinct from that of NCA mRNA. 3. BGP I mRNA was revealed in hepatocytes and <b>hepatocellular</b> <b>carcinomas</b> by Northern blot and in situ hybridization analyses. 4. An immunohistochemical study was carried out using anti-CEA peptide MoAb P 1 - 255 which had been shown to be crossreactive with BGP I, since CEA and NCA mRNAs were not detected in the liver. The cytoplasm and bile canaliculi were positive for P 1 - 255 in non-cancerous tissues. 5. In <b>hepatocellular</b> <b>carcinomas</b> the expression of BGP I tended to decrease with the level of differentiation. In conclusion, it was revealed at the levels of mRNA and protein that BGP I is expressed in the hepatocytes and <b>hepatocellular</b> <b>carcinomas...</b>|$|R

5|$|A {{technique}} called radioembolization {{is used to}} treat <b>hepatocellular</b> <b>carcinoma</b> and liver metastasis. Radioembolization is a low toxicity, targeted liver cancer therapy that uses millions of tiny beads made of glass or resin containing radioactive yttrium-90. The radioactive microspheres are delivered directly to the blood vessels feeding specific liver tumors/segments or lobes. It is minimally invasive and patients can usually be discharged after a few hours. This procedure may not eliminate all tumors throughout the entire liver, but works on one segment or one lobe {{at a time and}} may require multiple procedures.|$|E
5|$|Children {{are less}} likely than adults to clear the infection. More than 95% of people who become {{infected}} as adults or older children will stage a full recovery and develop protective immunity to the virus. However, this drops to 30% for younger children, and only 5% of newborns that acquire the infection from their mother at birth will clear the infection.

5|$|Liver {{disease may}} present itself as tiredness, {{increased}} bleeding tendency or confusion (due to hepatic encephalopathy) and portal hypertension. The latter, {{a condition in}} which the pressure in the portal vein is markedly increased, leads to esophageal varices, blood vessels in the esophagus that may bleed in a life-threatening fashion, as well as enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly) and accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity (ascites). On examination, signs of chronic liver disease such as spider angiomata (small distended blood vessels, usually on the chest) may be observed. Chronic active hepatitis has caused cirrhosis of the liver in most by the time they develop symptoms. While most people with cirrhosis have an increased risk of <b>hepatocellular</b> <b>carcinoma</b> (liver cancer), this risk is relatively very low in Wilson's disease.|$|E

40|$|Background: The zinc {{transporter}} ZIP 4 (Slc 39 a 4) {{is important}} for proper mammalian development and is an essential gene in mice. Recent studies suggest that this gene may {{also play a role}} in pancreatic cancer. Methods/Principal Findings: Herein, we present evidence that this essential zinc transporter is expressed in <b>hepatocellular</b> <b>carcinomas.</b> Zip 4 mRNA and protein were dramatically elevated in hepatocytes in the majority of human <b>hepatocellular</b> <b>carcinomas</b> relative to noncancerous surrounding tissues, as well as in hepatocytes in <b>hepatocellular</b> <b>carcinomas</b> occurring in farnesoid X receptor-knockout mice. Interestingly, meta-analysis of microarray data in the Geo and Oncomine databases suggests that Zip 4 mRNA may also be elevated in many types of cancer. Potential mechanisms of action of ZIP 4 were examined in cultured cell lines. RNAi knockdown of Zip 4 in mouse Hepa cells significantly increased apoptosis and modestly slowed progression from G 0 /G 1 to S phase when cells were released from hydroxyurea block into zinc-deficient medium. Cell migration assays revealed that RNAi knockdown of Zip 4 in Hepa cells depressed in vitro migration whereas forced overexpression in Hepa cells and MCF- 7 cells enhanced in vitro migration. Conclusions: ZIP 4 {{may play a role in}} the acquisition of zinc by <b>hepatocellular</b> <b>carcinomas,</b> and potentially many differen...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT- The {{pathogenesis}} of hepatocellular tumors induced in F 344 rats by the antihistaminic methapyrilene {{was investigated}} by light and electron microscopy in a serial sacrifice study. Eosinophilic foci of alteredhepatocytes {{were found in}} portal areas after 1 week of treatment, the eosinophilia being caused by proliferation of mitochondria. Eosino-philic neoplastic nodules developed from such lesions after 16 weeks of treatment. <b>Hepatocellular</b> <b>carcinomas</b> developed after 26 weeks of treat-ment. Mitochondrial proliferation, which had been found as a marker for hepatocytes altered by this compound at 1 week of treatment, was still present in the <b>hepatocellular</b> <b>carcinomas,</b> which therefore met the mor-phologic criteria of oncocytomas. -JNCI 1983; 71 : 1021 - 1031.

25|$|<b>Hepatocellular</b> <b>carcinoma</b> (HCC) is {{the most}} common type of primary liver cancer in adults, and {{is the most}} common cause of death in people with cirrhosis.|$|E
25|$|The usual {{outcome is}} poor, because only 10–20% of {{hepatocellular}} carcinomas {{can be removed}} completely using surgery. If the cancer cannot be completely removed, the disease is usually deadly within 3 to 6 months. This is partially due to late presentation with tumors, but also the lack of medical expertise and facilities in the regions with high HCC prevalence. However, survival can vary, and occasionally people will survive much longer than 6 months. The prognosis for metastatic or unresectable <b>hepatocellular</b> <b>carcinoma</b> has recently improved due to the approval of sorafenib (Nexavar®) for advanced <b>hepatocellular</b> <b>carcinoma.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Hepatocellular</b> <b>carcinoma,</b> {{like any}} other cancer, {{develops}} {{when there is a}} mutation to the cellular machinery that causes the cell to replicate at a higher rate and/or results in the cell avoiding apoptosis. In particular, chronic infections of hepatitis B and/or C can aid the development of <b>hepatocellular</b> <b>carcinoma</b> by repeatedly causing the body's own immune system to attack the liver cells, some of which are infected by the virus, others merely bystanders. While this constant cycle of damage followed by repair can lead to mistakes during repair which in turn lead to carcinogenesis, this hypothesis is more applicable, at present, to hepatitis C. Chronic hepatitis C causes HCC through the stage of cirrhosis. In chronic hepatitis B, however, the integration of the viral genome into infected cells can directly induce a non-cirrhotic liver to develop HCC. Alternatively, repeated consumption of large amounts of ethanol can have a similar effect. The toxin aflatoxin from certain Aspergillus species of fungus is a carcinogen and aids carcinogenesis of hepatocellular cancer by building up in the liver. The combined high prevalence of rates of aflatoxin and hepatitis B in settings like China and West Africa has led to relatively high rates of <b>hepatocellular</b> <b>carcinoma</b> in these regions. Other viral hepatitides such as hepatitis A have no potential to become a chronic infection and thus are not related to <b>hepatocellular</b> <b>carcinoma.</b>|$|E
40|$|Insulin {{receptor}} substrate- 1 (IRS- 1) is a multisite docking protein {{occupying a}} central position in signaling cascades stimulated {{by a number}} of growth factors including insulin. Using Western blotting and immunohistochemistry, we investigated the expression of IRS- 1 in more than 400 preneoplastic foci of altered hepatocytes and in 12 <b>hepatocellular</b> <b>carcinomas</b> induced in rats by oral administration of N-nitrosomorpholine. In both N-nitrosomorpholine-treated and untreated rat livers, IRS- 1 was demonstrable by Western blotting, but {{with the exception of a}} few single hepatocytes it was not detectable in the normal parenchyma by immunohistochemistry. In contrast, immunohistochemistry revealed that IRS- 1 was strongly expressed in the majority of foci of altered hepatocytes particularly in approximately 97 % of the clear/acidophilic and mixed cell foci showing excessive storage of glycogen (glycogenosis). In glycogen-poor basophilic foci of altered hepatocytes and <b>hepatocellular</b> <b>carcinomas,</b> IRS- 1 was not detected by immunohistochemistry, but a weak expression was observed in small subpopulations of three <b>hepatocellular</b> <b>carcinomas</b> containing remnants of glycogen. These results indicate that the focal overexpression of IRS- 1 is an early event in hepatocarcinogenesis, which is closely correlated with preneoplastic hepatic glycogenosis. During progression from glycogenotic foci to <b>hepatocellular</b> <b>carcinomas,</b> IRS- 1 -overexpression is gradually down-regulated, and this late event is associated with a fundamental metabolic shift leading to the malignant neoplastic phenotype...|$|R
