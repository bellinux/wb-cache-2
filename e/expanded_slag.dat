40|$|The {{effect of}} porous {{sound-absorbing}} concrete slabs on railway noise reduction is {{examined in this}} paper. First, the acoustical absorption coefficients of porous concrete materials with various aggregate types, gradations, fibre contents, and compaction indexes are measured in the laboratory. The laboratory results show that porous concrete that uses a composite of <b>expanded</b> perlite and <b>slag</b> as aggregate can not only obtain good acoustical absorption properties but also satisfy mechanical requirements. Also, the gradation of the combined aggregate has {{a significant effect on}} the acoustic absorption performance of the porous concrete, with an optimal aggregate gradation of 1 ~ 3 [*]mm. Furthermore, the fibre content and compaction index affect both the strength and the acoustic absorption property of the porous concrete, with the optimum value of 0. 3 % and 1. 6, respectively. Then, the findings from the laboratory studies are used to make porous sound-absorbing concrete slabs, which are applied in a test section. The measurements indicate that porous sound-absorbing concrete slabs can significantly reduce railway noise at different train speeds and that the amount of the noise reduction changes roughly linearly with speed when the train is traveling at less than 200 [*]km/h. The maximum noise reduction is 4. 05 [*]dB at a speed of 200 [*]km/h...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{disposal}} {{and treatment}} of hazardous industrial waste is very costly affairs for the industries, {{it has been a}} dormant issue. The new millennium brings challenges for the civil and environmental engineers and opportunities for research on the utilization of the solid waste and by-products and basic properties of concrete and its materials. The recycling of waste and by-products attracts an increasing interest worldwide due to the high environmental impact of the cement and concrete industries. Normal concrete is manufactured using sand and stones, but lightweight concrete can be made by using industrial by-products and hazardous solid wastes such as <b>expanded</b> fly ash, <b>slag,</b> sludge, etc. The Best Demonstrated Available Technology (BDAT) stabilization/solidification (S/S) can be used for treatment of concrete contaminated solid hazard-ous wastes and by-products. The performance of concrete is measured in terms of physical, engi-neering, and chemical properties. The review describes how chemical and mineral admixtures help in the improvement of the light-weight concrete properties. Cement is replaced by the 15 - 35 % fly ash in the concrete mix. Fly ash increases concrete strength, improves sulfate resistance, decreases permeability, reduces the water ratio required, and improves the workability of the concrete. Partial substitution solid hazard-ous waste does not strongly affect the strength of concrete and other properties. This mixed light-weight concrete is safe enough to be used in sustainable environmental applications, like road-beds, filling materials, etc. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the project entitled ''Utilization of Lightweight Materials Made from Coal Gasification Slags'' was to demonstrate the technical and economic viability of manufacturing low-unit-weight products from coal gasification slags {{which can be used}} as substitutes for conventional lightweight and ultra-lightweight aggregates. In Phase I, the technology developed by Praxis to produce lightweight aggregates from slag (termed SLA) was applied to produce a large batch (10 tons) of <b>expanded</b> <b>slag</b> using pilot direct-fired rotary kilns and a fluidized bed calciner. The expanded products were characterized using basic characterization and application-oriented tests. Phase II involved the demonstration and evaluation of the use of <b>expanded</b> <b>slag</b> aggregates to produce a number of end-use applications including lightweight roof tiles, lightweight precast products (e. g., masonry blocks), structural concrete, insulating concrete, loose fill insulation, and as a substitute for expanded perlite and vermiculite in horticultural applications. Prototypes of these end-use applications were made and tested with the assistance of commercial manufacturers. Finally, the economics of <b>expanded</b> <b>slag</b> production was determined and compared with the alternative of slag disposal. Production of value-added products from SLA has a significant potential to enhance the overall gasification process economics, especially when the avoided costs of disposal are considered...|$|E

40|$|In {{previous}} projects, Praxis {{investigated the}} utilization of as-generated slags {{for a wide variety}} of applications in road construction, cement and concrete production, agricultural applications, and as a landfill material. From these studies, the authors found that it would be extremely difficult for as-generated slag to find large-scale acceptance in the marketplace even at no cost because the materials it could replace were abundantly available at very low cost. It became apparent that a more promising approach would be to develop a variety of value-added products from slag that meet specific industry requirements. This approach was made feasible by the discovery that slag undergoes expansion and forms a lightweight material when subjected to controlled heating in a kiln at temperatures between 1, 400 and 1, 700 F.

40|$|The {{development}} of improved means of thermal storage is {{an aspect of}} energy conservation which has lagged other advances in this field. The intent of the present work is to address this need. To that end, concrete building materials were selected as ideal candidates for improvement in respect to their thermal storage capability. This was achieved by the incorporation of organic phase change materials (PCM's) in the concrete. These PCM's absorb or release the {{latent heat of fusion}} at a selected temperature and thereby greatly enhance the heat storage capacity of the impregnated concrete over a small temperature range. Modification of the concretes were performed to enhance their compatibility with the PCM's. Four types of aggregate were studied, three of which also found to be suitable for pre-impregnation. The energy storing concretes developed in this research have a very wide range of use in the storage of waste heat, heat from solar collectors of off-peak, low cost heat. In addition, they {{can also be used to}} improve the performance of burners and chillers through reduction of operating frequency by thermal storage. Their application is cost effective in areas with an appropriate diurnal temperature swing and, as fuel costs rise, they may be applied in colder regions as well. Original aspects of energy storage developed in this work comprise: (i) new concrete modules with organic PCM's including fatty esters, fatty alcohols and C 22 -C 24 paraffins; (ii) the application of lightweight aggregates such as pumice, expanded shale and <b>expanded</b> <b>slag</b> as PCM carriers for direct incorporation in concrete; (iii) various techniques for direct incorporation of PCM's without carriers; (iv) the use of pozzolans to modify concrete to permit use of alkali sensitive PCM's; (v) {{development of}} theoretical considerations of PCM diffusion in concrete and the determination of absorption characteristics; (vi) development of technique for defining absorption constants; (vii) the use of PCM's as protective substances in concrete; (viii) development of means to use walls, floors and ceilings for enhanced thermal storage...|$|E
