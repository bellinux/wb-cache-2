50|$|The <b>sizing</b> {{operation}} <b>is</b> a squeezing {{operation that}} minimizes {{the thickness of}} the metal. <b>Sizing</b> <b>is</b> performed in an open die and only the surface where the die and workpiece touch will <b>be</b> <b>sized.</b> Many ferrous metal castings <b>are</b> <b>sized</b> to sharpen corners and flatten holes around piercings. <b>Sizing</b> pressure <b>is</b> determined by area to <b>be</b> <b>sized,</b> the metal used, and the change in metal thickness from the operation. <b>Sizing</b> <b>is</b> usually performed on semi-finished parts or parts that require an accurate finish. Stop blocks are used to ensure close tolerances.|$|R

25|$|Once {{the case}} <b>is</b> <b>sized</b> down, {{the inside of}} the neck of the case will {{actually}} be slightly smaller than the bullet diameter. To allow the bullet to be seated, the end of the neck is slightly expanded to allow the bullet to start into the case. Boattailed bullets need very little expansion, while unjacketed lead bullets require more expansion to prevent shaving of lead when the bullet is seated.|$|E
25|$|The SH09 {{is offered}} with various {{different}} layout configurations; the default of these options has {{a total of}} four passenger seats present in addition to a pair in the front for the pilots, all of which are fully adjustable in height and length. In a high density configuration, five seats are installed in the rear position along with two more passenger seats inline with the pilot's own, which loses the option of the floor window. The use of Kevlar-threaded crashworthy fuel tanks, which are built into the wall and floor of the cargo hold, freed up space to allow for fully adjustable passenger seats in the cabin. The cargo hold <b>is</b> <b>sized</b> to accommodate 10 items of baggage, while the fuel tanks are sized to provide for an endurance of nearly five hours. The rear clamshell door and high-mounted tail boom is thought to potentially be attractive to North American-based air ambulance operators.|$|E
25|$|Each rod <b>is</b> <b>sized</b> to {{the fish}} being sought, the wind and water {{conditions}} and also to a particular weight of line: larger and heavier line sizes will cast heavier, larger flies. Fly rods come {{in a wide variety}} of line sizes, from size #000 to #0 rods for the smallest freshwater trout and pan fish up to and including #16 rods for large saltwater game fish. Fly rods tend to have a single, large-diameter line guide (called a stripping guide), with a number of smaller looped guides (aka snake guides) spaced along the rod to help control the movement of the relatively thick fly line. To prevent interference with casting movements, most fly rods usually have little or no butt section (handle) extending below the fishing reel. However, the Spey rod, a fly rod with an elongated rear handle, is often used for fishing either large rivers for salmon and Steelhead or saltwater surf casting, using a two-handed casting technique.|$|E

25|$|Belt press filters have 4 main zones: {{preconditioning}} zone, {{gravity drainage}} zone, linear compression (low-pressure) zone and roller compression (high-pressure) zone. Preconditioned slurry, which is flocculated and/or coagulated {{depending on the}} feed and process, is thickened in the gravity drainage zone. The gravity drainage zone is a flat or inclined belt where gravity drainage of free water occurs The gravity drainage area <b>is</b> <b>sized</b> according to feed solid concentrations. The standard size {{can be used for}} solids concentrations of 1.5 percent or greater, but a setup with a longer drainage area or extended size should be used for 1.5 to 2.5 percent feed solids for more free water drainage before compression. For dilute sludge with feed solids of less than 1.5 percent, an independent gravity drainage belt can be used. This belt is used only in the gravity drainage area, not in the pressure zones. The pressure or wedge zones use two belts, upper and lower, to sandwich the feed together, but an independent gravity zone has its own separate belt, making the belt filter a three-belt system. Depending on the required conditions of the cake, belt filters can have added washing stages and, infrared, hot gas or even microwave drying stages.|$|E

2500|$|Fly tying is {{a common}} {{practice}} in fly fishing, considered by many anglers {{an important part of}} the fly fishing experience. Many fly fishers tie their own flies, either following patterns in books, natural insect examples, or using their own imagination. The technique involves attaching small pieces of feathers, animal fur, and other materials on a hook in order to make it attractive to fish. This is made by wrapping thread tightly around the hook and tying on the desired materials. [...] A fly <b>is</b> <b>sized</b> according to the width of the hook gap; large or longer flies are tied on larger, thicker, and longer hooks. The construction of tube flies is different in that the tier secures materials a tube rather than to a hook. These flies are rigged by passing the fishing line through the tube before attaching a hook.|$|E
