5|$|Each {{software}} package has a maintainer {{that may be}} <b>either</b> <b>one</b> person or a team of Debian developers and non-developer maintainers. The maintainer keeps track of upstream releases, and ensures that the package coheres {{with the rest of}} the distribution and meets the standards of quality of Debian. Packages may include modifications introduced by Debian to achieve compliance with Debian Policy, even to fix non-Debian specific bugs, although coordination with upstream developers is advised.|$|E

In flag football the ballcarrier is not tackled; instead, defenders aim {{to pull a}} flag tied around his waist.

A game of touch football may require that the player be touched with <b>either</b> <b>one</b> or two hands to be considered down, depending on the rules used.|$|E
5|$|To combine glyphs, rongorongo employs {{consistent}} rules. First, the ‘defining feature’ of a glyph is identified, and {{the rest}} is discarded. Then, this ‘defining feature’ is grafted onto a ‘main body’ glyph which retains most of its original shape (except for the addition of the ‘defining feature’). This is done {{in such a way that}} aesthetic unity is maintained. Typically, <b>either</b> <b>one</b> or two ‘defining features’ may be grafted onto a single ‘main body’.|$|E
5|$|By his own reckoning, Offenbach {{composed}} {{more than}} 100 operas. Both {{the number and}} the noun are open to question: some works were so extensively revised that he evidently counted the revised versions as new, and commentators generally refer to {{all but a few}} of his stage works as operettas, rather than operas. Offenbach reserved the term opérette (English: operetta) or opérette bouffe for some of his one-act works, more often using the term opéra bouffe for his full-length ones (though {{there are a number of}} one- and two-act examples of this type). It was only with the further development of the Operette genre in Vienna after 1870 that the French term opérette began to be used for works longer than one act. Offenbach also used the term opéra-comique for at least 24 of his works in <b>either</b> <b>one,</b> two or three acts.|$|E

5|$|Falklands '82 is a turn-based {{strategy}} game {{focusing on}} land battles during the Falklands War. The player commands the British Task Force against the Argentine ground forces, who are occupying the islands. The game begins by allocating fifteen Royal Navy ships {{for the task}} force; a proportionate amount must be devoted for attack and defence purposes. The player must then choose four landing spots in northern East Falkland to begin the invasion: Port Stanley, Berkeley Sound, Cow Bay and San Carlos Bay. The SAS or SBS are available throughout the game to provide intelligence on Argentine movements; however, intelligence is limited and may only be collected {{a certain number of}} times. At any time, the player may request reinforcements from <b>either</b> <b>one</b> of the two aircraft carriers, HMS Hermes or HMS Invincible.|$|E
5|$|For use in {{a binary}} digital computer, the tube had {{to be capable of}} storing <b>either</b> <b>one</b> of two states at each of its memory locations, {{corresponding}} to the binary digits (bits) 0 and1. It exploited the positive or negative electrostatic charge generated by displaying either a dash or a dot at any position on the CRT screen, a phenomenon known as secondary emission. A dash generated a positive charge, and a dot a negative charge, either of which could be picked up by a detector plate in front of the screen; a negative charge represented 0, and a positive charge1. The charge dissipated in about 0.2seconds, but it could be automatically refreshed from the data picked up by the detector.|$|E
5|$|High-speed USB2.0 hubs contain devices called {{transaction}} translators that convert between high-speed USB2.0 {{buses and}} full and low speed buses. When a high-speed USB2.0 hub is plugged into a high-speed USB host or hub, it operates in high-speed mode. The USB hub then uses <b>either</b> <b>one</b> transaction translator per hub {{to create a}} full/low-speed bus routed to all full and low speed devices on the hub, or uses one transaction translator per port to create an isolated full/low-speed bus per port on the hub.|$|E

5|$|Horses are {{odd-toed}} ungulates, {{or members}} of the order Perissodactyla. This order also includes the extant species of rhinos and tapirs, and many extinct families and species. Members of this order walk on <b>either</b> <b>one</b> toe (like horses) or three toes (like rhinos and tapirs). This {{is in contrast to}} even-toed ungulates, members of the order Artiodactyla, which walk on cloven hooves, or two toes. This order includes many species associated with livestock, such as sheep, goats, pigs, cows and camels, as well as species of giraffes, antelopes and deer.|$|E
5|$|However, if a {{preference}} set is non-convex, then some prices determine a budget-line that supports two separate optimal-baskets. For example, {{we can imagine}} that, for zoos, a lion costs {{as much as an}} eagle, and further that a zoo's budget suffices for one eagle or one lion. We can suppose also that a zoo-keeper views either animal as equally valuable. In this case, the zoo would purchase <b>either</b> <b>one</b> lion or one eagle. Of course, a contemporary zoo-keeper does not want to purchase half of an eagle and half of a lion (or a griffin)! Thus, the zoo-keeper's preferences are non-convex: The zoo-keeper prefers having either animal to having any strictly convex combination of both.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, the {{outbreak}} of the Korean War and Britain's heavy involvement in this conflict led to a flurry of orders being issued; the need for capable modern interceptors was felt to be so pressing that the RAF was willing to consider accepting interim fighter aircraft while more capable fighters would continue to be pursued. In particular, the RAF felt that a pair of proposed fighter aircraft from Hawker Aircraft and Supermarine were of high importance and thus placed orders for these proposed fighters 'off the drawing board' in 1950. The reasoning behind these two aircraft being ordered in 1950 was intended to serve as an insurance policy in the event of <b>either</b> <b>one</b> of these projects failing to produce a viable aircraft; these two aircraft would later become known as the Supermarine Swift and the Hawker Hunter respectively.|$|E

5|$|In deposit, {{the spores}} are pale orange to {{yellowish}} orange. Ascospores are egg-shaped, measuring 20–24 by 14–16µm when mature, but smaller (14.5–19 by 9–10µm) in immature fruit bodies. They are thin-walled, hyaline (translucent), and inamyloid. The cylindrical asci (spore-bearing cells) are 300–360 by 16–20µm with walls up to 1.5µm thick. Paraphyses measure 90–184 by 10–18.5µm (6–9µm thick if immature); they are hyaline, have a septum at the base, and comprise <b>either</b> <b>one</b> or two cells. The flesh {{is made of}} thin-walled, hyaline hyphae measuring 3–9µm wide.|$|E
5|$|In the aftermath, Robert forced Henry {{to leave}} Rouen, {{probably}} because Henry's {{role in the}} fighting had been more prominent than his own, and possibly because Henry had asked to be formally reinstated as the count of the Cotentin. In early 1091, William Rufus invaded Normandy with a sufficiently large army to bring Robert to the negotiating table. The two brothers signed a treaty at Rouen, granting William Rufus a range of lands and castles in Normandy. In return, William Rufus promised to support Robert's attempts {{to regain control of}} the neighbouring county of Maine, once under Norman control, and help in regaining control over the Duchy, including Henry's lands. They nominated each other as heirs to England and Normandy, excluding Henry from any succession while <b>either</b> <b>one</b> of them lived.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1800s, John Dalton used {{the concept of}} atoms to explain why {{elements}} always react in ratios of small whole numbers (the law of multiple proportions). For instance, {{there are two types}} of tin oxide: one is 88.1% tin and 11.9% oxygen and the other is 78.7% tin and 21.3% oxygen (tin(II) oxide and tin dioxide respectively). This means that 100g of tin will combine either with 13.5g or 27g of oxygen. 13.5 and 27 form a ratio of 1:2, a ratio of small whole numbers. This common pattern in chemistry suggested to Dalton that elements react in whole number multiples of discrete units—in other words, atoms. In the case of tin oxides, one tin atom will combine with <b>either</b> <b>one</b> or two oxygen atoms.|$|E
