50|$|A {{signal box}} {{is located on}} Platform 1, which {{controls}} a crossover to allow trains to terminate here. The <b>interlocked</b> <b>frame</b> at this signal box was abolished in 1976, replaced by a control panel, with boom barriers replacing interlocked gates at the level crossing, at up end of the station, in 1977. Approximately 100 metres south of the station is a stabling yard that can hold a number of trains. It was upgraded to a Premium station on 20 December 1995.|$|R
50|$|On 8 May 1988, {{the former}} signal box and <b>interlocked</b> <b>frame</b> were {{abolished}}. Also abolished were crossovers, formerly {{located at the}} Up and Down ends of the station, and the double line block system between Reservoir and Keon Park, which was replaced with automatic three position signalling. Pedestrian boom barriers were also provided at the pedestrian crossing, located at the Down end of the station, and at the High Street level crossing.

50|$|The {{contract}} {{for the construction of}} the station building was awarded in 1889, for £1809/8/11. A 45 lever <b>interlocking</b> <b>frame,</b> in a signal box, was brought into use in 1890. By this time, the station had a main platform, with a dock platform at the eastern end, a main line and crossing loop, turntable, and a number of sidings. The station was originally provided with a 53 ft turntable. In 1957, it was replaced by a 70-foot unit.|$|E
5000|$|On 5 August 1901, Queenscliff Junction was abolished, {{with a new}} {{parallel}} line built next to the old line, effectively making South Geelong {{the junction}} to Queenscliff.

50|$|The {{printing}} business grew quickly, but Comino {{never felt}} happy in printing and wanted further business challenges. In 1937, he established Dexion Ltd (from the Greek for 'right') to market products {{he had developed}} and patented to improve {{the efficiency of the}} printing process. These included: a gauge to check the squareness and register of a printer's forme; trolleys; chutes; a duplicate book; <b>interlocking</b> <b>frames</b> to hold print in place inside the chase; and a compositor's chart. As a printer, he was also concerned about the lack of versatility of the wooden shelving often for storing paper and other consumables. He began to work on steel shelving which could readily be assembled, dismantled and then reassembled. By 1939 he had developed an angled section made of steel with slots cut down one side and a long groove cut down the other. Birmingham-based Accles & Pollock manufactured an initial batch which was delivered in late August, a week before the declaration of the Second World War on 3 September 1939, and Comino sold most of this angled section to local stores of Lillywhites, John Lewis and Selfridges.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{computational}} process of generating and constructing interlocking frames. Its outcome delivers a sophisticated software tool {{that creates a}} three dimensional interlocking pattern, analyzes the intersecting conditions between members, and immediately provides instruction of its assembly sequence in animated visualization. An <b>interlocking</b> <b>frame</b> {{is a system that}} consists of short members spanning on a large surface where members lock each other at their mid-spans by simple notches. Such a system should be designed with consideration of its assembly sequence, as a static interlocking form may be described but impossible to assemble in any sequence. Given a three dimensional digital model of an <b>interlocking</b> <b>frame,</b> the feasibility of the disassembly sequence can be assessed by analyzing the geometric contact constraints between each member. The assembly sequence can then be obtained by reversing the disassembly sequence, and helps a designer to evaluate different options in the earlier stage of design. The proposed tool uses the genetic algorithm and graph searching algorithms to find optimized notching configurations that guarantee an assembly sequence. It can analyze various types of assemblies defined by planar surface contact constraints, and has a potential for further development into a versatile, automated 4 D simulation tool. by Alan Song-Ching Tai.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{an exploration}} {{of the ways in which}} certain forms of interactive art can and do elicit experiences of co-evolution with a technologized environment. These "emergent arts", I argue, give rise to a sensory experience of a sense of being embedded and co-emergent with this environment. The term "co-evolution" is often taken to allude to Darwin biological processes of interaction between two or more species. However, much like humanities scholars such as Katherine Hayles and Mark Hansen do in their analyses of technology (Hayles 1999; Hayles 2002; Hayles 2007; Hansen 2006; Hansen 2005; Hansen 2009 a), I recast the term to refer to processes of emergence, self-organization and autopoiesis. By examining these artworks and experiences via the <b>interlocking</b> <b>frames</b> of cybernetics, phenomenological philosophy, posthumanism and interactive/new media art, this dissertation articulates the movement towards a framework that fuses theoretical and experiential modes of inquiry to provide insights relevant to both interactive artists and humanities scholars. New approaches to understanding and studying technologically-based artworks are proffered that attend to how these artworks are contributing to a new range of experiences that more adeptly attune us to our techno-ecological context. Experiences that I refer to as "symbiogenic". The framework centers on the exposition of four theoretical concepts: Ambiguity and Unknowability, Boundary, Distributed Intentionality and Collectively Emergent Autonomy. In addition, a taxonomical model of artworks is put forth that outlines a number of characteristics of new media and interactive arts practice that engage in processes that establish a foundation for the shifts in perceptual and embodied experience that I characterize as symbiogenic. Along with the textual exegesis, this dissertation details the conceptualization, design, construction and exhibition of two interactive artworks: Protocol and Biopoiesis. Their function in this research is threefold: first as a concrete method of putting theories to the ontological test beyond conventional textual means, second, a way developing new concepts and techniques and modifying existing ones (this applies to both the philosophical ideas and to the technical systems that are developed specifically for each artwork) and third they serve as embodiments of theoretical concepts in their own right...|$|R
25|$|The {{building}} has a curved frontage. Between of the arcade {{on the ground}} floor is a central feature consisting of perpendicular piers running up three storeys. Around the central feature, which projects slightly from the frontage, is an acanthus leaf border worked in precast concrete. A white stucco frieze of <b>interlocking</b> discs <b>frames</b> the panel. There is 18,000 feet of floor space in the building arranged around an air-well. The ground floor was designed for retail. The central entrance and show windows had curved plate glass that had to be specifically made in England. Italian tiles were used in the floors throughout the building. The upper four floors, of which one complete floor was reserved for the Oriental Government Security Life Assurance Company, was used as office space and was reached by a lift and staircase {{at the side of the}} building. The basement was constructed separately, with windows fitted with sliding steel doors. The contract time for completing the structure was eight months, and the construction was to start shortly after late November 1931, with the architects reported as Messrs. Booty and Edwards, the contractors as Gammon (Malaya) Ltd., and Steen Sehested as the consulting reinforced concrete specialist.|$|R
40|$|SAS {{ensures that}} {{commands}} are delivered in order at the link layer by <b>interlocking</b> COMMAND <b>frame</b> transmission. The sender must receive an ACK or NAK before proceeding. If the sender receives a NAK or detects an ACK/NAK timeout after sending a COMMAND frame, it can {{choose not to}} send the next command until it deals with the problem. This covers CRC errors and frames that are far too short or too long. SCSI’s ORDERED task attribute, autocontingent allegiance (ACA) feature, and unit attention interlock feature {{can be used to}} ensure that commands received correctly (i. e., ACKed by the link layer) are processed in order by the device server: a) Commands with ORDERED task attributes are processed in the order received; b) If a command fails and returns CHECK CONDITION status, ACA blocks all subsequent commands from being processed until the failure is cleaned up; and c) If a unit attention occurs (both for traditional unit attention reasons and also optionally whenever the logical unit returns BUSY, TASK SET FULL, or RESERVATION CONFLICT), the unit attention interlock blocks all subsequent commands from being processed until a REQUEST SENSE command is run. However, SAS leaves one hole that is not covered by the link layer NAK. In certain circumstances th...|$|R
