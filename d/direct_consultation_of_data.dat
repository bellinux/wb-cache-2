40|$|Unusually {{for this}} journal, the editors here {{republish}} with permission an article which first appeared elsewhere some twenty years ago.

The self-perpetuating unawareness (as the author perceives it) of this particular rich legacy of nineteenth-century European innovative thought is obviously attributable in part to the inaccessibility of Grundtvig’s Danish writings and the paucity o f reliable English-language translations and relevant editorial apparatus. The article is in effect a call both to American adult education scholars to incorporate Grundtvig in his proper place in the American reading o f the modem history of western education, and to Grundtvig-scholars in Europe to furnish translated resources sufficiently authoritative and comprehensive to serve as a source and a tool for such a mission...|$|R
40|$|In the European Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS) {{there is}} {{fertile ground for}} the {{development}} of eMonographs published in Open Access. As this study shows, an increasing number of scholars in these disciplines are using digital resources and tools in their daily research practice, in their reading and writing, as well as in their teaching curricula. A substantial part of the scholars in these fields is open to innovations in publishing formats and regimes, most importantly concerning eMonographs and Open Access. Despite the fact that this openness is not equally common in all scholarly fields, there is a critical mass to buttress the Open Access publishing of eMonographs. Many scholars in the HSS see this newly developing form of publishing as an important contribution to their ambition to share their knowledge and research results with their peers and other potential readers, provided there is sufficient quality control. These are the main conclusions of this study based on the <b>direct</b> <b>consultation</b> <b>of</b> some 40 experts from relevant groups of stakeholders in academic publishing, a review <b>of</b> relevant literature, <b>data</b> gathered from two round table discussions and an online survey that reached approximately 250 scholars in the Humanities and Social Sciences...|$|R

Prediction of compliance to diets for persons on the Air Force Weight Program could help the diet therapist with intervention planning with these people. Sixty-six active duty Air Force persons on the Weight Program were given a survey based on the Fishbein Model of Behavioral Intentions. The subjective norm, spouse, was beneficial in the prediction of behavior of following the diet prescription, R 2 = 0. 32, p = 0. 003.

Thanks to them, electronic devices are increasingly present in our lives in many forms: Mobile phones, music players and managers have become the essential of modern life. Access to information anywhere at any time is increasingly a daily challenge of embedded system technology. Following an innovative idea, this paper describes an embedded system that can query any database through SMS commands to extend the <b>consultation</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> to mobile networks early generations. Based on a UNIX embedded system, {{the result of this}} work can serve as a standard <b>consultation</b> <b>of</b> databases through SQL-SMS Gateway which converts an SMS command in an SQL query.

We proposed a HTA approach for considering the introduction of a new vaccine that could potentially have a great impact on the population’s health, using as an example the vaccine against Human Papilloma Virus (HPV). This approach could be of great interest when the decision making process involves choices regarding new vaccines. We developed a HTA approach for assessing all of the aspects involved in the introduction of vaccines against HPV in Italy, considering the following issues: - epidemiological evaluation of HPV infection and related pathologies through the <b>consultation</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> banks and the scientific literature; - evaluation of health care resources utilisation by people suffering from the infection/ related diseases, through the <b>consultation</b> <b>of</b> hospital archives; - systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials on HPV vaccination effectiveness and safety; - mathematical modelling and economic evaluation of the vaccination using a cost-effectiveness analysis; - evaluation of the impact of vaccination on the Health System [organisational aspects, vaccine surveillance, relationship between different decisional levels (national, regional) ]; - analysis of the ethical, social (acceptability, availability, accessibility, information) and legislative aspects of vaccination. A HTA report on the new vaccine could represent an new important tool to support the choice of decision makers in order to better inform the allocation of economic resources and maximize healthcare services, since it takes into account not only the burden and the epidemiology of the disease, and the economic evaluation of different scenarios, but also the social, legal and bioethical aspects.

Previous studies have used clinical records to gather this data, but the validity of these methods remains unclear. Direct observation {{has been used to}} collect similar data in medicine and may be better able to capture the complexities <b>of</b> the <b>consultation.</b> The aim <b>of</b> the {{study was to determine the}} common patients, presentations, diagnoses and interventions during small animal veterinary <b>consultations</b> using <b>direct</b> observation. A network of 8 sentinel practices in England and Scotland was recruited. A tool allowing collection <b>of</b> <b>data</b> during <b>direct</b> observation <b>of</b> <b>consultations</b> was developed and piloted. The tool was used to gather data on patient characteristics, problems discussed, diagnoses made and outcomes selected. Practice visits were conducted to feedback results and stimulate discussion. Consultations were highly complex, with discussion of multiple problems, leading to a wide range of diagnoses and outcomes. Discussion of several problems appeared to be associated with increased consultation length. Preventive medicine was a common reason for presentation, and these consultations were amongst the most complex. A definitive diagnosis was not reached for most problems, yet actions were frequently taken. Feedback from the practices involved was positive, and discussions surrounding priorities for future research echoed the findings of the study. <b>Direct</b> observation <b>of</b> <b>consultations</b> allows caseload to be recorded in great detail, which may not be possible with other collection methods. The results are the first step in directing future research towards areas relevant to practitioners and will also be useful in guiding the veterinary curriculum.

General {{practice as}} a complex system: a novel analysis <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> <b>data.</b> Family Practice 2005; Pages 1 – 6 of 6. Background. Complex systems have specific properties of robustness and self organisation which arise from interacting components within the overall system and which govern the system’s behaviour. These are typically associated with a power law distribution of event sizes. Commentators have suggested that health systems are complex, {{but there has been}} limited quantitative investigation of this issue. Objectives. To test the hypothesis that consultation patterns in primary care follow a power law distribution typical of a complex system. Methods. Analysis of 142 050 episodes of non-pathological back pain in routinely collected New Zealand national <b>data.</b> Calculation <b>of</b> the distribution of the duration and number <b>of</b> GP <b>consultations</b> for each illness episode. Secondary analysis of a published UK dataset <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> rates for 44 000 patients in four general practices. Results. Number <b>of</b> <b>consultations</b> per episode <b>of</b> back pain demonstrated excellent fit with a power law in the full dataset (r 2 = 0. 96) and all but one subgroups (r 2 = 0. 90 – 0. 99). The number <b>of</b> <b>consultations</b> per patient from four UK practices was suggestive of a power law distribution (r 2 = 0. 88 – 0. 93). Conclusions.

There is a plethora of reasons as to why underrepresented students struggle to get themselves through college; the most identifiable being lack of support, resources, family stability, and success lineage. A multitude of the underrepresented students here at the University of Rhode Island, in accordance to other institutions nation wide, are first generation students who are blindly trailblazing their way through college: an experience no one in their family can guide them through. It is an intrinsic law of physics that without a stable foundation of support, it is nearly impossible to build an edifice that is structurally sound; this is the same law we follow here at Seeds of Success. We are striving to be the foundation of support and empowerment for our underrepresented CELS students here at the University of Rhode Island. We realize that this mission cannot be accomplished without <b>direct</b> <b>consultation</b> <b>of</b> current underrepresented CELS students, hence their input has been pivotal in propelling us forward towards solidifying the program and addressing their personal needs. Sadly, research unveils numerous statistics that exhibit the common thread that students who start out planning to major in STEM fields graduate at far lower rates than their non-STEM classmates, especially if they’re Black, Latino or Native American. The obvious problem with this is that if students do not have accountability partners/mentors to help them down a successful career path that embodies their dreams, the vicious cycle of mediocrity repeats itself and the students become one more statistic for the books. It 2 ̆ 7 s a terrible chain reaction that needs to be broken but it requires brave students and a whole community of support to shatter that cycle. We are here to show that mentors come in many different forms and can in fact be the peers struggling right next to you in class. Unfortunately, our success lineage is scarce; leaving not enough rooting matter to uphold a small community, therefore, the objective is to start forming our own success lineage for the ones treading blindly behind us; starting the success lineage that was not passed down to us because our preceding ancestors had bigger issues to overcome. In an effort to address the unnumbered inadequacies misplaced in the hands of our CELS students and implement our program successfully, Seeds of Success will be a mentoring/networking program that will focus on developing and refining academic, professional, and social components in the college careers of our members...|$|R

This article aims at reflecting the taste and the relevance of dictionary usage research 20 years later.

In my view, the most important aim of research into dictionary use can no longer be limited to improving dictionaries. Research into dictionary use should also raise more awareness for user- orientation in general and should provide methodological reflection to enlighten the increasingly important usage statistics for online dictionaries. Another goal should be to look behind the scenes of collaborative dictionaries in order to provide background data to classify their relevance in relation to dictionaries elaborated by lexicographic experts. The crisis of lexicography makes it also necessary to broaden our view and concentrate on situations in which linguistic questions arise.
