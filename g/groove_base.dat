40|$|The helical {{junction}} {{region of}} a − 1 frameshift stimulating hairpin-type mRNA pseudoknot from sugarcane yellow leaf virus (ScYLV) {{is characterized by}} a novel C 27 ·(G 7 –C 14) loop 2 –stem 1 minor <b>groove</b> <b>base</b> triple, which is stacked on a C 8 +·(G 12 –C 28) loop 1 –stem 2 major <b>groove</b> <b>base</b> triple. Substitution of C 27 with adenosine reduces frameshifting efficiency to a level just twofold above the slip-site alone. Here, we show that the global structure of the C 27 A ScYLV RNA is nearly indistinguishable from the wild-type counterpart, {{despite the fact that the}} helical junction region is altered and incorporates the anticipated isostructural A 27 ·(G 7 –C 14) minor <b>groove</b> <b>base</b> triple. This interaction mediates a 2. 3 -Å displacement of C 8 + driven by an A 27 N 6 –C 8 + O 2 hydrogen bond as part of an A(n− 1) ·C+·G-Cn base quadruple. The helical junction regions of the C 27 A ScYLV and the beet western yellows virus (BWYV) pseudoknots are essentially superimposable, the latter of which contains an analogous A 25 ·(G 7 –C 14) minor <b>groove</b> <b>base</b> triple. These results reveal that the global ground-state structure is not strongly correlated with frameshift stimulation and point to a reduced thermodynamic stability and/or enhanced kinetic lability that derives from an altered helical junction architecture in the C 27 A ScYLV RNA as a significant determinant for setting frameshifting efficiencies in plant luteoviral mRNA pseudoknots...|$|E
40|$|SRY, a {{putative}} {{transcription factor}} encoded by the sex-determining {{region of the}} human Y chromosome, regulates a genetic switch in male development. Impairment of this switch leads to intersex abnormalities of the newborn and is observed in association with mutations in the SRY DNA-binding domain [the high-mobility-group (HMG) box]. Here we show that the SRY HMG box exhibits a novel mechanism of DNA recognition: partial intercalation of a nonpolar side chain in the DNA minor <b>groove.</b> <b>Base</b> stacking (but not base pairing) is interrupted {{at the site of}} insertion. Sequence specificity reflects topological requirements of partial intercalation rather than direct readout of base-specific functional groups. Our results predict that the SRY HMG box inserts an alpha-helix into a widened minor groove {{at the center of a}} sharp DNA bend. A similar mechanism may underlie binding of SRY and homologous HMG proteins to four-way junctions (Holliday intermediates) and other noncanonical DNA structures...|$|E

These activators exhibit site-specific binding to a conserved DNA sequence, TGT-N 3 -R-N 4 -Y-N 3 -aCA, that is located upstream of NucC-dependent S. marcescens promoters {{and the late}} promoters of P 2 -related phages. In this report we describe the interactions of NucC with the P 2 FETUD late operon promoter PF. NucC is shown to bind PF as a tetramer and to make 12 symmetrical contacts to the DNA phosphodiester backbone. The backbone contacts are centered on the TGT-N 3 -R-N 4 -Y-N 3 -aCA motif. Major <b>groove</b> <b>base</b> contacts {{can be seen at}} most positions within the ∼ 24 -bp binding site. Minor groove contacts map to adjacent positions in the downstream half of the binding site, which corresponds to the area in which the DNA also appears to be bent by NucC binding.

40|$|This paper reports two {{numerical}} simulation methods for modeling displacement instabilities around a surface groove {{in a metal}} substrate used in nuclear power plant. The amplitude change in the groove, the downward displacement at the base node, and the groove displacement at the periphery were simulated using ABAQUS to compare the results from two methods, {{as well as the}} tangential stress in the elements at the <b>groove</b> <b>base</b> and periphery. The comparison showed that for the tangential stress two methods were in close agreement for all thermal cycles. For the amplitude change, the downward displacement, the groove displacement, and the stress distribution, the two methods were in close agreement for the first 3 to 6 thermal cycles. After that, inconsistency increased with the number of thermal cycles. It is interesting that the thermal cycle at which the discrepancy between the two methods began to occur corresponded to a thermally grown oxide (TGO) thickness of 1 [*]μm, which showed the accuracy of the present work over the classic method. It is concluded that the present work’s {{numerical simulation}} scheme worked better with a thinner TGO layer than the classic method and could overcome the limitation of TGO thickness by simulating any thickness...|$|E

We report three {{structures of}} HinP 1 I–DNA complexes: in the pre-sence of Ca 2 + (pre-reactive complex), {{in the absence}} of metal ion (binary complex) and in the presence of Mg 2 + (post-reactive complex). HinP 1 I forms a back-to-back dimer with two active sites and two DNA duplexes bound on the outer surfaces of the dimer facing away from each other. The 10 bp DNA duplexes undergo protein-induced distortions exhibiting fea-tures of A-, B- and Z-conformations: bending on one side (by intercalation of a phenylalanine side chain into the major <b>groove),</b> <b>base</b> flipping {{on the other side of}} the recognition site (by expanding the step rise distance of the local base pair to Z-form) and a local A-form conformation between the two central C:G base pairs of the recognition site (by bind-ing of the N-terminal helix in the minor groove). In the pre- and post-reactive complexes, two metals (Ca 2 +or Mg 2 +) are found in the active site. The enzyme appears to cleave DNA sequentially, hydrolyzing first one DNA strand, as seen in the post-reactive complex in the crystalline state, and then the other, as supported by the observation that, in solution, a nicked DNA intermediate accumulates before linearization...|$|E

In the rarer C 20 -endo sugar puckers, orientations towards the O 30 atom of the same sugar are strongly favoured. Surprisingly, in helical regions, the frequently suggested intra-strand O 20 -H(n) [...] . O 40 (n 1) interaction is not found. This observation led to the detection of an axial C-H [...] . O interaction between the C 20 -H 20 (n) group and the O 40 (n 1) atom contributing to the stabilization of RNA helical regions. Subsequent analysis of crystallographic structures of both RNA and A-DNA helices fully supports this ®nding. Speci®c hydration patterns are also thought to play a signi®cant role in the stabilization of RNA structures. In the shallow groove of RNA, known as a favourable RNA or protein-binding region, three well-de®ned hydration sites are located around the O 20 atom.

40|$|Four novel piperazinylcarbonyloxyethyl {{derivatives}} of anthracene and pyrene {{have been}} prepared and investigated with respect to sequence specificity and synergism between hydrophobic and electrostatic effects upon binding to DNA. Linear and circular dichroism spectroscopy {{was used to assess}} the orientation of the aromatic chromophores relative to the nucleobases. Anthracene and pyrene derivatives 2 a and 3 are both concluded to bind to homo-polynucleotide poly(dA-dT) (2) by intercalation of their aromatic moieties between base pairs, with a binding constant K-AT of 4 x 10 (5) M- 1 and 2 x 10 (6) M- 1, respectively. Significantly reduced affinities (K-GC = 3 x 10 (4) M- 1 and 10 (5) M- 1, respectively) are observed with poly(dG-dC) (2), due to less favorable interactions of the piperazinium tail in the minor <b>groove.</b> <b>Base</b> pair specificity is reflected in the binding thermodynamics, with the binding to AT being more enthalpically driven than the binding to GC. Phenyl substitution at the quaternary piperazinium site of the anthracene derivative 2 b, does not affect the ratio K-AT/K-GC, but reduces the affinity for both AT End GC slightly. Moreover, the phenyl group in the 10 -position of 4 prevents intercalation, and apparently, this compound binds externally to both AT and GC duplex polynucleotides. The results are discussed in terms of general features of the interactions of the intercalating and minor-groove binding molecular moieties, and their interplay with each other, with potentials for tuning specificity...|$|E
40|$|Nuclear factor III (NFIII) is a HeLa sequence-specific DNA-binding {{protein that}} stimulates {{initiation}} of adenovirus DNA replication in vitro {{and may be}} involved in regulation of transcription of several cellular and viral genes. We have studied the interaction between NFIII and the binding site in the adenovirus type 2 (Ad 2) origin in detail by methidiumpropyl-EDTA. iron(II) and hydroxyl radical footprinting and by alkylation interference experiments. Our results indicate that (i) the core of the recognition sequence is 5 '-TATGATAAT- 3 '; (ii) both major and minor <b>groove</b> <b>base</b> contacts are detected, and all base pairs in the core are involved in binding; (iii) many backbone contacts are observed divided into a large domain coinciding with the core and a small domain; (iv) contact points are not confined {{to one side of the}} DNA helix in contrast to the nuclear factor I (NFI) -binding site; (v) the binding site overlaps the NFI-binding site for at least one nucleotide. A number of Ad 2 mutants as well as related binding sites in the origins of other adenovirus serotypes were systematically compared for binding with NFIII. The results are in good agreement with the contact point studies and show that at least one AT base pair is commonly required by NFI and NFIII for optimal binding. The strongest binding site, which contains the octamer/decanucleotide motif (ATGCAAAT[NA]), was found in the Ad 4 origin, which lacks an NFI-binding site. Stimulation of in vitro DNA replication of Ad 2, Ad 4, and Ad 12 by NFIII showed that the maximal level of stimulation is dependent on the affinity of NFIII for the origin...|$|E
40|$|The crystal {{structure}} of the heterodimer formed by the DNA binding domains of the yeast mating type transcription factors, MATa 1 and MATalpha 2, bound to a 21 bp DNA fragment has been determined at 2. 5 A resolution. The DNA fragment {{in the present study}} differs at four central base pairs from the DNA sequence used in the previously studied ternary complex. These base pair changes give rise to a (dA 5). (dT 5) tract without changing the overall base composition of the DNA. The resulting A-tract occurs {{near the center of the}} overall 60 degrees bend in the DNA. Comparison of the two structures shows that the structural details of the DNA bend are maintained despite the DNA sequence changes. Analysis of the A 5 -tract DNA subfragment shows that it contains a bend toward the minor groove centered at one end of the A-tract. The observed bend is larger than that observed in the {{crystal structure}}s of A-tracts embedded in uncomplexed DNA, which are straight and have been presumed to be quite rigid. Variation of the central DNA base sequence reverses the two AT base pairs contacted in the minor groove by Arg 7 of the alpha 2 N-terminal arm without significantly altering the DNA binding affinity of the a 1 /alpha 2 heterodimer. The Arg 7 side chain accommodates the sequence change by forming alternate H bond interactions, in agreement with the proposal that minor <b>groove</b> <b>base</b> pair recognition is insensitive to base pair reversal. Furthermore, the minor groove spine of hydration, which stabilizes the narrowed minor groove caused by DNA bending, is conserved in both structures. We also find that many of the water-mediated hydrogen bonds between the a 1 and alpha 2 homeodomains and the DNA are highly conserved, indicating an important role for water in stabilization of the a 1 /alpha 2 -DNA complex...|$|E

40|$|Plant luteoviral RNA viruses employ - 1 frameshifting for the {{production}} of P 1 and P 1 -P 2 fusion proteins important for viral replication. Luteoviral pseudoknots are characterized by three adenosines in the 3 ' side of loop L 2 known to be important for maintaining frameshifting efficiency and pseudoknot stability. A proposed P 1 -P 2 mRNA pseudoknot from sugarcane yellow leaf virus (ScYLV) was of interest since it contained two adenosine to cytidine substitutions in L 2. Functional analysis shows that the in vitro frameshifting efficiency is greater (~ 15 %) than any other luteoviral pseudoknot. The NMR-derived solution structure of the ScYLV RNA pseudoknot shows that C 25 is looped out of the triplex structure and the 3 ' most L 2 cytidine (C 27) and A 24 form cis Watson-Crick/sugar-edge interactions with C 14 and C 15 in stem S 1, respectively. Thus, the ScYLV pseudoknot maintains a similar triple helical architecture as other luteoviral pseudoknots. Surprisingly, the frameshifting efficiency of the C 27 A ScYLV pseudoknot is decreased by ~ 8 fold relative to wild-type ScYLV. The solution structure of the C 27 A ScYLV RNA exhibits a global fold similar to the wild-type RNA; however, distinct hydrogen bonding interactions at the helical junction are observed. Specifically, C 8 + in the C 8 + major <b>groove</b> <b>base</b> triple moves ~ 2. 3 ? relative to the accepting (G 12 -C 28) base pair relative to the WT RNA. New NMR experiments have been developed and/or applied to confirm Watson-Crick base pairs and tertiary structural interactions in the PEMV- 1 and ScYLV pseudoknots by direct observation of trans hydrogen bond scalar couplings. In addition, intrabase couplings in cytidine and adenosine have been measured, providing a valuable tool for the assignment of amino and N 3 /N 1 resonances in RNA. Finally, thermodynamic analysis of the pairwise coupling between the major groove and minor groove tertiary structural hydrogen bonds at the helical junction have been investigated by monitoring the thermal unfolding of WT, dC 14, C 27 A, and dC 14 /C 27 A RNAs as a function of pH. Favorable pairwise coupling characterized the WT ScYLV and BWYV RNAs, while unfavorable coupling characterized the poorly functional C 27 A ScYLV RNA. The implications of these structural, functional, and thermodynamic findings on the mechanism of frameshift stimulation is discussed...|$|E
