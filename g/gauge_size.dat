50|$|Though nylon coil zippers are a {{very popular}} choice for {{a large number of}} applications, the use of nylon is now being {{replaced}} with polyester.

There are other variations of these coil zippers too which are also used extensively according to their requirements.|$|R
50|$|The 537 m long tunnel (together with 'Six Chain') {{was built}} through the Little Liverpool Range on {{a section of}} narrow gauge railway from Grandchester to Gatton. The railway opened in June 1866, being delayed when the {{excavation}} of the tunnel revealed unexpected geological difficulties, requiring the tunnel to be lined with 3 layers of bricks. That resulted in the tunnel having restricted clearances, which limits the loading <b>gauge</b> (<b>size</b> of rolling stock) on {{this section of the}} Queensland Railways network, and the floor of the tunnel was lowered by 150mm in 1985 to improve that situation.|$|E
5000|$|Of {{this general}} class, {{the most common}} subset is birdshot, which uses a large number (from dozens to hundreds) of small pellets, meant to create a wide [...] "kill spread" [...] to hunt birds in flight. Shot shells are {{described}} by the size and number of the pellets within, and numbered in reverse order (the smaller the number, the bigger the pellet size, similar to bore <b>gauge).</b> <b>Size</b> nine (#9) shot is the smallest size normally used for hunting and is used on small upland game birds such as dove and quail. Larger sizes are used for hunting larger upland game birds and waterfowl.|$|E
50|$|One {{reason for}} the fire's {{duration}} {{was the lack of}} national standards in firefighting equipment. Fire crews and fire engines came {{from as far away as}} Philadelphia and Washington that day (units from New York City were on the way, but blocked by a train accident; they arrived the next day - Monday, February 8). The crews brought their own equipment. Most could only watch helplessly after discovering that their hoses could not connect to Baltimore's <b>gauge</b> <b>size</b> of water hydrants. High winds and freezing temperatures further contributed to the fire's extent and firefighters' difficulties. As a result, the fire burned over 30 hours, destroying 1,545 buildings spanning 70 city blocks—amounting to over 140 acre.|$|E

5000|$|The {{nasal septum}} is the {{cartilaginous}} dividing wall between the nostrils. Generally, the cartilage {{itself is not}} pierced, but rather the small gap between the cartilage and {{the bottom of the}} nose (sometimes called the [...] "sweet spot"), typically at 14ga (1.6mm) although it is often stretched to a larger <b>gauge</b> (<b>size).</b> The nose has many nerves running through it, and as a result, nose piercings can be painful, although the pain varies by individual. This piercing heals within {{a month and a half}} to three months also depending on the individual. It should only be stretched by 1mm at a time, and waiting at least a month between stretches is advisable. If a certain point is exceeded, usually about 8mm, the cartilage gets forced towards the top of the nose, which can be uncomfortable.|$|E
30|$|The {{stability}} of the wellbore is the factor that determines the <b>gauge</b> <b>size,</b> shape and integration. Well stability {{is the result of}} the drilling mud and the rock interactions (Zhang and Jia et al. 2015). To gain well stability water sensitivity should be controlled which can be done by reducing the interface contact between the water phase and the shale to eliminate unwanted interactions (Munshi and Singh et al. 2008; McElfresh and; Holcomb et al. 2012).|$|E
