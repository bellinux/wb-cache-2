25|$|Although Angie {{tries to}} stop drinking, her {{attempts}} always fail dismally {{and by the}} end of the year she is arrested for drink-driving when she crashes Den's car on the way home from a darts match. In episodes broadcast in 1986, Den's mistress, Jan, starts to frequent The Queen Vic. The physical arrival of Jan sends Angie's marriage into further decline as she is unable to contain her jealousy and anger. Angie becomes so depressed that she takes a near lethal cocktail of booze and pills in an attempted suicide. By chance, Den returns home early following an argument with Jan, discovers Angie and rushes her to the hospital where she has her stomach pumped. Angie recovers, but is left shaken when she discovers how close to death she actually came. Upon recovering, Angie decides to play Den at his own game and so she begins another affair with Andy O'Brien (Ross Davidson). Den is furious when he discovers them in bed together, but his rage is short-lived as <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>more</b> pressing things on his mind, such as the birth of his illegitimate daughter, Vicki Fowler (Emma Herry). Angie's affair with Andy only lasts a month, ending when Andy reunites with his ex-girlfriend Debbie Wilkins (Shirley Cheriton). Andy dies in a road accident shortly afterwards.|$|E
500|$|In Sir Philip Sidney's (1554–1586) courtly love poem [...] "The Nightingale", Sydney's narrator {{who is in}} {{love with}} a woman he cannot have compares his own romantic {{situation}} to that of Philomela's plight and claims that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>more</b> reason to be sad. However, recent literary criticism has labelled this claim as sexist and an unfortunate marginalization of the traumatic rape of Philomela. Sydney argues that the rape was an [...] "excess of love" [...] and less severe than being deprived of love as attested by the line, [...] "Since wanting is more woe than too much having." ...|$|E
500|$|Mr. Krabs has a {{distinct}} manner of walking; when he moves, he moves his feet very quickly and he is drawn as if <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>more</b> than two legs. When directing animation for early episodes, one of Stephen Hillenburg's goals was for each character to have a separate walk cycle that showed their personalities; storyboard artist Erik Wiese designed Krabs' walk cycle {{with the intention of}} making it cartoonish. Wiese recalled in 2012, [...] "I animated Mr. Krabs' little feet on a four-frame multi-blur cycle—I think it was the best solution to making him walk like a crab." [...] Steven Hillenburg approved of the walk after Wiese demonstrated it on a pencil test machine.|$|E

First, he is pitted against a group of white nationalists and Neo-Nazis in a scrap yard. Then, he faces a gang of a former military turned mercenaries called [...] "The Wardogs" [...] in an abandoned zoo. Here Cash has to save {{members of his own}} family who have been kidnapped by the Wardogs and are being used as bait to lure him out. Following this, he fights a gang of Satanic Latino occultists and perverted pedophiles called [...] "The Innocentz" [...] in a derelict shopping center.|$|E
500|$|According to Rowson, White's first {{advantage}} is that, [...] "The {{advantage of the}} first move has some similarities with the serve in tennis in that White can score an 'ace' (for instance with a powerful opening novelty), <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>more</b> control over the pace {{and direction of the}} game, and he has a 'second serve' in that when things go wrong his position is not usually losing." [...] Second, White begins the game with some initiative, although Rowson regards this as a psychological rather than a positional advantage, [...] "and whether it leads to a positional advantage depends on the relative skill of the players." [...] Third, some players are able to use the initiative to [...] "play a kind of powerful 'serve and volley' chess in which Black is flattened with a mixture of deep preparation and attacking prowess." [...] Fourth, [...] "If White wants to draw, it is often not so easy for Black to prevent this. This {{advantage is}} particularly acute in cases where there is a possible threefold repetition, because White can begin the repetition without committing to a draw and Black has to decide whether to deviate before he knows whether White is bluffing." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2012, the Louvre and the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco {{announced}} a five-year collaboration on exhibitions, publications, art conservation and educational programming.

The republic of Azerbaijan, the Emir of Kuwait, the Sultan of Oman and King Mohammed VI of Morocco donated in total €26 million. In addition, {{the opening of the}} Louvre Abu Dhabi is supposed to provide €400 million over the course of 30 years for its use of the museum's prestigious brand. Loyrette has tried to improve weak parts of the collection through income generated from loans of art and by guaranteeing that [...] "20% of admissions receipts will be taken annually for acquisitions". <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>more</b> administrative independence for the museum and achieved 90percent of galleries to be open daily, as opposed to 80percent previously.
