50|$|When a {{large part}} of the visual field moves, a viewer <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> has moved and that the world is stationary. For example, when one is in a train at a station, and a nearby train moves, one can have the {{illusion}} that one's own train has moved in the opposite direction. Common sorts of vection include circular vection, where an observer is placed at the center of rotation of a large vertically-oriented rotating drum, usually painted with vertical stripes; linear vection, where an observer views a field that either approaches or recedes; and roll vection, where an observer views a patterned disk rotating around his or her line of sight. During circular vection, the observer <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> is rotating and the drum is stationary. During linear vection, the observer <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> has moved forwards or backwards and the stimulus has stayed stationary.

500|$|Starkiller was {{designed}} as Luke Skywalker's photo-negative, and is named after [...] "Annikin Starkiller" [...] (Luke Skywalker's original name in the early Star Wars scripts). The developers tried to avoid making Starkiller too rigidly defined while keeping the character developed. The developers also wanted to avoid making Starkiller seem irredeemably evil, and used elements of his backstory and his relationships with other characters to balance it, while trying not to explain too much of his backstory. In {{order to avoid the}} character being over emotional, they tried to let short pieces of dialogue and looks carry scenes so that the player could interpret how Starkiller felt. They attempted to make Starkiller <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> would belong in the classic Star Wars trilogy by making his actions faster and more intense. During an interview to Haden Blackman by The Guardian, he claimed that most of the testing players wanted the character to be ultimately redeemed {{by the end of the}} game.|$|E

500|$|Frank Cifaldi of Gamasutra {{covered a}} speech by Jaffe on the {{development}} of God of War at the 2006 D.I.C.E. Summit in Las Vegas. Cifaldi said [...] "God of War was a rare opportunity for a game designer" [...] because Sony gave Jaffe nearly complete creative control to develop a game on his terms with a substantial budget. He stated that Jaffe wanted to make the game [...] "out of passion, not fear, {{and that it would be}} a game that [...] himself, as a game player, would want to play". Jaffe said the 1981 film Raiders of the Lost Ark also inspired the development of God of War; he wanted to make players <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> felt as a child watching that film, but did not want to put the player in the role of an adventurer, referencing The Legend of Zelda games. He elaborated that God of War was designed to be simplistic and forward-moving, but the game [...] "is not innovative or unique, and that's intentional". Jaffe said that their system was shallow and [...] "it forced the team to constantly create new content to trapeze the player from one area of interest to the next". He said he understood modular game design—the need to have great looking, high-detail levels without having to build and texture every minuscule piece of the environment—but [...] " [...] was going to get bored" [...] if they did not step outside of those boundaries.|$|E

500|$|Originally, Che was {{intended}} to be a much more traditional film based on Jon Lee Anderson's 1997 biography Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life. Actor Benicio del Toro and producer Laura Bickford optioned the film rights to Anderson's book. However, after two years they had not found a suitable writer and the rights expired. During this time, Del Toro and Bickford researched the events depicted in Guerrilla with the idea of exploring Guevara's attempts to start a revolution in Bolivia. Del Toro has said that he previously only thought of Guevara as a [...] "bad guy". For his role, Del Toro spent seven years [...] "obsessively researching" [...] Guevara's life, which made him <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> [...] "earned his stripes" [...] to interpret the character. Preparation included looking at Guevara's photographs and reading his personal writings. Del Toro read Don Quixote, one of Guevara's favorites, and the first book published and given out free after the Cuban Revolution. Del Toro then personally met with people from different stages of Guevara's life, including Guevara's younger brother and childhood friends, traveling to Cuba where Del Toro met Guevara's widow, family, and [...] "tons of people that loved this man". The visit included a five-minute encounter at a book fair with Fidel Castro, who expressed that he was happy for the [...] "serious" [...] research being undertaken. Such research included collaborating with the three surviving guerrillas from Guevara's ill-fated Bolivian campaign, and with several guerrillas who fought alongside him in Cuba. While researching for both films, Soderbergh made a documentary of his interviews with {{many of the people who}} had fought alongside Guevara. In his encounters with people ranging from fellow guerrillas to Guevara's driver, Del Toro described the reaction as [...] "always the same", stating that he was [...] "blown away" [...] by the [...] "bucketful of love" [...] they still harbored for Guevara. In an interview, Del Toro described Guevara as [...] "a weird combination of an intellectual and an action figure, Gregory Peck and Steve McQueen, wrapped in one". After the film's production concluded, Del Toro professed that [...] "when you tell the story of Che, you're telling a story of the history of a country, so you have to be very careful".|$|E
500|$|Oxbow drew post {{position}} {{five for}} the Haskell, carried the highest weight at 122 pounds, {{and was the}} second favorite in the race behind Verrazano. [...] Leading for {{the early part of}} the race, Oxbow was challenged for the lead by Verrazano at the three-quarter-mile marker, then weakened and finished fourth, earning another $60,000. Stevens felt something was wrong with Oxbow at the half-mile pole, later saying the horse [...] "didn’t <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> did in any of the Triple Crown races", and Lukas stated the jockey [...] "kind of held" [...] Oxbow from that point on. Oxbow was pulled up soon after crossing the finish line, then his rider jumped off and removed the saddle when Oxbow failed to jog sound on the track. [...] The horse walked back to the barn without obvious sign of injury, and radiographs of his right front ankle revealed no fracture, but he did have a soft tissue injury to the area, described as a [...] "sprain". Of Oxbow's overall health, Lukas commented, [...] "he had a pretty set of X-rays. It's amazing. For a horse with that many , they were really clean." [...] Nonetheless, as a result of the soft tissue injury, Oxbow was taken out of races for the duration of the summer, and after three weeks of hand-walking at Saratoga was shipped home to Calumet in mid-August, with an announcement that he was not anticipated to run again in 2013. Lukas said: [...] "He's been a warrior and a hell of a nice horse for us and I don't want to do anything to jeopardize his future down the line." [...] On October 25, 2013, Calumet Farm announced the decision to retire Oxbow. Combined with his winnings in his two-year-old season, his lifetime race earnings were $1,243,500. [...] He stood at stud for the 2014 breeding season at [...] Taylor Made Farm in Lexington, Kentucky, for an introductory stud fee of $20,000. He closed out the year ranked 17th in earnings with $1,146,000 won in 2013. For the 2015 season he moves to Calumet Farms, where he joins seven other stallions, including English Channel, who sired 2014 Travers Stakes winner V.E. Day.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} for Voliminal was mixed. The newspaper Dawn called the DVD [...] "an audible treat for thrash and speed metal fans", {{he went on}} to compliment drummer Joey Jordison, stating that he [...] "structures his beats and percussions in a very traditional thrash set-up, almost as well as (dare I say it) the great Dave Lombardo of Slayer fame". Ultimate Guitar called the DVD [...] "behind-the-scene action in an unorthodox format, complete with choppy editing and absolutely no specific chronology". They would go on to state though the DVD [...] "only gives partial attention to the music", [...] "The best moment in the 2-disc collection comes during a chat with Corey Taylor, who shares his feelings about everything from his less-than-perfect relationship with his father to the obstacles that the band faced in its early days". TuneLab wrote [...] "Slipknot takes a unique approach to their latest film, as they turn {{what could have been a}} mundane video of live footage and band antics into a rather peculiar and extremely interesting movie". The [...] "scatterbrained and choppy" [...] style of Voliminal [...] " [...] the viewer to <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> or she is [...] "outside looking in", rather than being truly involved with the band's happenings". Reviewing for Blogcritics, Chris Beaumont wrote [...] " [...] was enthralled and bored by the documentary". He went on to state, [...] "the best part is watching them perform", despite the [...] "audio is near unlistenable"; [...] "these guys know their way around the stage...this shows the whole package". Reviewing for Billboard, Christa Titus criticized the DVD writing it [...] "randomly [...] footage from concerts and the usual backstage antics with images of pigeons and overflowing toilets, then tossing in whatever visual effects struck M. Shawn Crahan's fancy while he edited it." [...] She concluded [...] "Save your cash for the band's next tour...that's where you'll get your money's worth". Film School Rejects's Cole Abaius wrote of the DVD, [...] ", probably no one else will purchase or enjoy this DVD". He added that with no narration, [...] "the images are left to speak for themselves", only [...] "some just don’t speak loudly enough". Despite the mixed reviews, Voliminal was certified gold in Australia, platinum in the United States, and double platinum in Canada. The album peaked at the 5th spot on Billboards Music Video charts, and remained on the chart for 10 weeks.|$|E
