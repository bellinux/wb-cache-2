5|$|BSkyB's {{continued}} {{partnership with}} the Premier League {{has led to an}} increase in the value of broadcasting rights and matches televised. Managers however have voiced their concerns about the latter and the excessive cost of live rights is partly a reason why top-flight football has not returned to the BBC or ITV. In 2005 BSkyB's monopoly on live rights ended after the European Commission ruled that the Premier League needed to <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> holder.|$|E

However, some long species have an anus and some with complex, branched guts <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> anus, since excretion {{only through the}} mouth {{would be difficult for}} them. The gut is lined with a single layer of endodermal cells that absorb and digest food. Some species break up and soften food first by secreting enzymes in the gut or pharynx (throat).|$|E

This record later became tied with another season nine years later. After Rosa formed {{a few days before}} Sergio, November 2006 became the first since 1961 to <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> storm in the month. The hurricane is currently the third strongest in the month, as well as the longest-lasting.|$|E

The most stable {{of them is}} promethium-148m, with a {{half-life}} of 43.1days; this is longer than the half-lives of the ground states of all promethium isotopes, except for promethium-143 to 147. In fact, promethium-148m has a longer half-life than its ground state, promethium-148.|$|E
5|$|The {{spacecraft}} verified {{the existence}} of a magnetic field surrounding the planet and discovered that the field was offset from the centre and tilted {{in a manner similar to}} the field around Uranus. Neptune's rotation period was determined using measurements of radio emissions and Voyager 2 also showed that Neptune had a surprisingly active weather system. Six new moons were discovered, and the planet was shown to <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> ring.|$|E

The player can only carry one type of pesticide at a time; during {{the early stages of the}} game the lethal pesticide can be carried at all times, but later stages <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> type of insect on screen at once, making the choice of pesticide more tactical.|$|E
5|$|This {{is a list}} of {{the colleges}} and {{universities}} who have had a player win a Heisman trophy: Ohio State and Notre Dame are tied for the most trophies at 7 each (USC's 2005 award having been voluntarily forfeited). Ohio State has the distinction of the only two-time winner, Archie Griffin, leaving their total players to have won the trophy at six. In total, players from 39 different schools have won a Heisman Trophy, while 18 schools <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> trophy.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Newman {{returned}} as Spectres composer. Rather than composing the score once the film {{had moved into}} post-production, Newman worked during filming.

Mendes stated that the final film would <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> hundred minutes of music. The soundtrack album was released on 23 October 2015 in the UK and 6 November 2015 in the USA on the Decca Records label.|$|E

Each location (normally a diocese, for example: Manchester) has a regiment or a diocesan battalion, this then divides into battalions (South, Central, North East - Durham, Oldham, Rochdale, Bolton, Tameside) {{and then into}} companies.

5|$|Vertical {{broaching}} machines {{can be designed}} for push broaching, pull-down broaching, pull-up broaching, or surface broaching. Push {{broaching machines}} are similar to an arbor press with a guided ram; typical capacities are 5 to 50 tons. The two ram pull-down machine {{is the most common}} type of broaching machine. This style machine has the rams under the table. Pull-up machines have the ram above the table; they usually <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> ram. Most surface broaching is done on a vertical machine.|$|E
5|$|Canadian {{stars are}} {{inducted}} in an annual group ceremony; while the Hollywood Walk of Fame rarely inducts {{more than two}} major stars at a time. Celebrities can <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> star on the Hollywood Walk, the same celebrity can receive {{as many as five}} stars under the various categories. This does not happen with Canada's Walk of Fame, although some may have an individual star but are also included {{as part of a larger}} group, such as John Candy, Martin Short, Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara who have their own star but also were in Second City Television.|$|E
5|$|For any graph G = (V,E), we may {{define a}} matroid {{on the edges}} of G, in which a set of edges is {{independent}} if and only if it forms a pseudoforest; this matroid is known as the bicircular matroid (or bicycle matroid) of G. The smallest dependent sets for this matroid are the minimal connected subgraphs of G that <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> cycle, and these subgraphs are sometimes called bicycles. There are three possible types of bicycle: a theta graph has two vertices that are connected by three internally disjoint paths, a figure 8 graph consists of two cycles sharing a single vertex, and a handcuff graph is formed by two disjoint cycles connected by a path.|$|E
