40|$|In conclusion, the <b>heat</b> <b>insulation</b> by {{radiation}} sheet packages or laminated foams is {{a complex}} problem, which only can be understood {{with the help of}} analytical simulations: On the one hand, the <b>heat</b> <b>insulation</b> is determined by the thermal conductivity. On the other hand, the reflectivity of the surfaces plays an important role. In particular the reflectivity of non laminated foams as well as the reflectivity of laminated foams has not been investigated until now. In principle, the benefit of the usage of open celled foams as <b>heat</b> <b>insulation</b> is twofold: Firstly, to the mass of the heat shields is reduced considerably and thus the production costs are expected to decrease. Secondly, it is expected, that better <b>heat</b> <b>insulation</b> capability may result in lower energy consumption of the furnaces. In conclusion, the project shows that open celled foams out of molybdenum are a potent substitute for conventional radiation sheet <b>heat</b> <b>insulation.</b> Since the masses of the Mo-foams is distinctly lower than that one of the radiation sheets, it is expected, that the use of foams as <b>heat</b> <b>insulation</b> will noticeably reduce production costs...|$|R

40|$|Currently, {{standard}} semitransparent photovoltaic (PV) modules can largely replace architectural glass {{installed in}} the windows, skylights, and facade of a building. Their main features are power generation and transparency, as well as possessing a heat insulating effect. Through <b>heat</b> <b>insulation</b> solar glass (HISG) encapsulation technology, this study improved {{the structure of a}} typical semitransparent PV module and explored the use of three types of high-reflectivity <b>heat</b> <b>insulation</b> films to form the HISG building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) systems.

The experimental results indicated that the <b>heat</b> <b>insulation</b> performance and power generation of HISGs were both improved. Selecting an appropriate <b>heat</b> <b>insulation</b> film so that a larger amount of reflective solar radiation is absorbed by the back side of the HISG can yield greater enhancement of power generation.

40|$|In {{the time}} when {{sustainable}} construction as well as cost saving on heating and cooling of buildings {{is one of the}} most important construction trends, it is important to acknowledge the possibilities of application of construction materials with high <b>heat</b> <b>insulation</b> parameters and the ways in which these parameters can be obtained. Autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) is a load bearing construction material, which has high <b>heat</b> <b>insulation</b> parameters, although it has one significant disadvantage. If the AAC masonry construction has high moisture content, it loses its <b>heat</b> <b>insulation</b> properties. This is the reason why it is important to detect the humidity distribution throughout the cross section of the masonry elements in order to conduct the drying process of the AAC construction. Therefore, the question about non-destructive detection of humidity distribution throughout the cross section of the material arises. Humidity distribution throughout the cross section of AAC masonry constructions has a significant impact on its heat resistivity properties. Application of electrical impedance spectrometry (EIS) method for determination of humidity distribution throughout the cross section of AAC constructions has been a subject of research recently. The EIS method is an easily applicable non-destructive testing method for detection of the humidity distribution throughout the cross section of a construction. Research on the impact of the external <b>heat</b> <b>insulation</b> layer on the speed of humidity distribution changes is described in this paper...|$|R

40|$|It is {{recommended}} {{to have a}} vapor-proof barrier on the internal side of <b>heat</b> <b>insulation</b> system in multi-layer building enclosing parts {{in order to ensure}} protection of a heat-insulation layer against humidification because relative humidity of internal air is generally higher than external one and diffusion of water steam is directed from premises outside. While having a barrier with high vapor permeability a part of moisture can be accumulated in the structure and <b>heat</b> <b>insulation</b> core and difference of actual and maximum possible partial pressures leads to condensate formation. In order to improve thermal properties of enclosing parts the necessity arises to create a vapor-proof protection screen. It complies with the design of a panel with a vapor-proof screen in the form of non-perforated aluminium foil. The given screen located at internal panel layer prevents penetration of water vapor from premises into enclosing part and <b>heat</b> <b>insulation</b> layer. In such a case condensation zones and, consequently, their moistening can occur in some layers of enclosing parts according to their thermal and physical characteristics. The paper contains a calculation of thermal and moisture regime of the enclosing parts with vapor-proof layer (non-perforated aluminium foil) located in enclosing part core between various layers. An analysis of thermal and moisture regime diagrams for multi-layer external enclosing part demonstrates that the part of non-perforated screen (aluminium foil) located between internal concrete layer and perforated <b>heat</b> <b>insulation</b> layer is considered the most rational one.
