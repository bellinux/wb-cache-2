25|$|Nicklaus {{was also}} known for his course {{management}} skills. He would plan to hit each <b>full</b> <b>shot</b> to the optimal position, to best set up his next shot, usually aiming for level lies and clear approach lines, while favoring his preferred shot shapes. He would often hold back on power to achieve this, but had a power advantage over most rivals through the set, {{so that he could}} hit a 3-wood or 1-iron from the tee with increased accuracy to avoid trouble, with sufficient length {{to keep up with the}} drivers hit by most rivals. An exceptional example of this came in the final round of the 1966 Open Championship at Muirfield, on the 17th hole, a 530-yard par 5 hole. Nicklaus needed a birdie, but the hole was framed by tall fescue rough, and was playing downwind with very firm turf conditions. He used a 3-iron from the tee and hit the shot 290 yards, then hit a 5-iron 240 yards onto the green, two-putted for birdie, and parred the final hole to win the title.|$|E
2500|$|Proxemics is an {{essential}} component of cinematic mise-en-scène, the placement of characters, props and scenery within a frame, creating visual weight and movement. [...] There are two aspects to the consideration of proxemics in this context, the first being character proxemics, which addresses such questions as: [...] How much space is there between the characters? [...] What is suggested by characters who are close to (or, conversely, far away from) each other? [...] Do distances change as the film progresses? [...] and, Do distances depend on the film's other content? [...] The other consideration is camera proxemics, which answers the single question: How far away is the camera from the characters/action? [...] Analysis of camera proxemics typically relates Hall's system of proxemic patterns to the camera angle used to create a specific shot, with the long shot or extreme long shot becoming the public proxemic, a <b>full</b> <b>shot</b> (sometimes called a figure shot, complete view, or medium long shot) becoming the social proxemic, the medium shot becoming the personal proxemic, and the close up or extreme close up becoming the intimate proxemic.|$|E

5000|$|A week later, on {{the night}} of October 30, Shallenberger and Fuller entered the Lewis' trailer through a back door that Teresa had left open. While she waited in the kitchen, Shallenberger shot the {{sleeping}} Julian several times, while <b>Fuller</b> <b>shot</b> Charles in his bedroom with a shotgun. After discovering Charles was not dead, <b>Fuller</b> <b>shot</b> him twice more. Teresa waited 45 minutes before calling for help, and while waiting for the police to arrive, she removed money from her dying husband's wallet. She divided $300 with Shallenberger and Fuller before they left. However, sheriff's deputies arrived prior to Julian dying, and heard him say, [...] "My wife knows who done this to me," [...] while she had claimed the two had been killed by unidentified assailants in a home invasion.|$|R

50|$|Smith's full-swing {{technique}} was much admired {{as one of}} the best of the hickory shaft era. Bing Crosby, himself an excellent player who followed golf closely, said that Smith's swing was better than any he had ever seen. Ben Hogan studied Smith's swing intently to improve his own. Smith employed a strong grip, with both hands turned more to the right on the club, which produced a draw on the majority of his <b>full</b> <b>shots.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{shot noise}} assumes {{independent}} arrivals. Vacuum tubes have shot noise because the electrons randomly leave the cathode and {{arrive at the}} anode (plate). A tube may not exhibit the <b>full</b> <b>shot</b> noise effect: {{the presence of a}} space charge tends to smooth out the arrival times (and thus reduce the randomness of the current).|$|E

Once this traditional first sip is completed one can drink the rest of the drink normally.|$|E

5000|$|In photography, filmmaking {{and video}} production, {{a long shot}} (sometimes {{referred}} to as a <b>full</b> <b>shot</b> or, and to remove ambiguity, wide shot) typically shows the entire object or human figure and is usually intended to place it in some relation to its surroundings. These are typically shot now using wide angle cameras (approximately a 25mm lens in 35mm photography and a 10mm lens in 16mm photography.) [...] However due to the sheer distance establishing shots and extreme wide shots can use almost any camera type.|$|E

He proceeds to perform magic with a hen and eggs. These are variations on simple sleight of hand tricks involving making objects appear, but the hen is able to take the eggs back into her body.|$|E
50|$|A motion comic (or {{animated}} comic) {{is a form}} {{of animation}} combining elements of print comic books and animation. Individual panels are expanded into a <b>full</b> <b>shot</b> while sound effects, voice acting, and animation are added to the original artwork. Text boxes and sound effect bubbles are typically removed to feature more of the original artwork being animated. Motion comics are often released as short serials covering a story arc of a long running series or animating a single release of a graphic novel. Single release issues of a story arc are converted into ten- to twenty-minute-long episodes depending on content.|$|E
50|$|Artistic billiards, {{sometimes}} called fantasy billiards or fantaisie classique, is a carom billiards discipline in which players compete at performing 76 preset shots of varying difficulty. Each set shot has a maximum point value assigned for perfect execution, {{ranging from a}} four-point maximum for lowest level difficulty shots, and climbing to an 11-point maximum for shots deemed highest in difficulty level. There is a total of 500 points available to a player, representing the combined value of a perfect score on all 76 shots, although not all games are played with the <b>full</b> <b>shot</b> catalogue. The governing body of the sport is the Confédération International de Billard Artistique (CIBA).|$|E
5000|$|Gainey {{uses the}} very rare {{baseball}} grip on <b>full</b> <b>shots,</b> where he hooks his left (top) thumb behind {{his right hand}} (normal position for the left thumb for a right-handed golfer is under the right thumb). His swing is also notably jerky and eccentric, and {{has been described as}} [...] "trying to kill a snake with a garden hose." [...] His early employer A.O. Smith continues to sponsor Gainey. His other 2011 sponsors included Under Armour, Adams Golf and The Dow Group. In 2012 Gainey made the switch to Callaway Clubs, and he continues to be sponsored by A.O. Smith and The Dow Group.|$|R
