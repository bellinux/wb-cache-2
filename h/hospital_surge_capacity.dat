However, what if an invisible bioweapon or dirty bomb was released in a major population center, or if avian flu took hold with sustained human to human transmission? Suddenly, we need to combine efforts from psychosomatic medicine and general medicine with public health practice to triage nonexposed patients with somatic symptoms from those with medical sequelae resulting from hazardous exposures. This would better enable the limited acute care resources to be directed to those most in need of urgent medical care. Furthermore, psychosomatic medicine experts are potentially important players in biodefense planning related to risk communication and health education strategies in a WMD scenario or outbreak in which individuals must make informed choices about their need for immediate medical attention.

40|$|A system {{dynamics}} model {{was developed to}} help hospitals assess their ability to handle surges of demand during various types of disasters. The model represents all major flows of patients through a hospital and indicates how specific responses to a surge may ameliorate bottlenecks and their potentially harmful effects on patients. The model was calibrated to represent a specific hospital in West Virginia and was tested under three quite different surge scenarios: a bus crash, a chemical plant leak, and a SARS outbreak. Under the difficult conditions of the SARS scenario, avoidable deaths of patients awaiting emergency care could be effectively reduced by adding reserve nursing staff not in the emergency department, as might be expected, but in the overloaded inpatient wards. The model can help hospital planners better anticipate how patient flows may be affected by disasters, and identify best practices for maximizing the <b>hospital’s</b> <b>surge</b> <b>capacity</b> under such conditions...|$|R

In many cases, hospitals were relatively successful in making sure that those patients most severely affected by the influenza strain were able to be seen, treated, and discharged in an efficient manner.

For example, CHOP took several steps to increase the emergency department (ED) <b>surge</b> <b>capacity</b> response abilities through careful planning and mitigation efforts. To increase ED capacity and response, CHOP used portions of the main lobby area as an ED waiting room; several of the region's hospital-based outpatient facilities were in use during evening and weekend hours for non-emergency cases; the ED's 24-hour short-stay unit was utilized to care for ED patients in a longer-term capacity; non-board certified physicians (in pediatric emergency medicine) and inpatient-unit medical nurses were utilized for ED patient care; hospital units normally utilized for other medical or therapeutic purposes were transformed into ED patient rooms; and rooms normally used for only one patient were expanded to at least a capacity of 2 ...|$|R
40|$|FluSurge 2. 0 Beta Test VersionOn cover: Preparing for {{the next}} {{influenza}} pandemic. Planning ahead in preparation for an influenza pandemic, with its potentially very high morbidity and mortality rates, is essential for hospital administrators and public health officials. To this end, FluSurge helps you estimate the impact of an influenza pandemic on your community. It {{has been designed to}} demonstrate the need to plan for a surge in demand for hospital services during the next pandemic, and to provide a method to estimate demand for these services, which can be used to plan the allocation of scarce resources. Based on census data and estimates of hospital resources (non-ICU [Intensive Care Unit] hospital beds, ICU beds, and mechanical ventilators) provided by you in a given area (e. g., a city, a state), FluSurge estimates the number of hospitalizations and deaths of an influenza pandemic (whose length and virulence are determined by you) and compares the number of persons hospitalized, the number of persons requiring ICU care, and the number of persons requiring ventilator support during a pandemic with existing hospital capacity.

40|$|Objectives: US {{hospitals}} {{are expected to}} function without external aid for up to 96 hours during a disaster; however, concern exists that there is insufficient capacity in hospitals to absorb large numbers of acute casualties. The aim {{of the study was}} to determine the potential for creation of inpatient bed surge capacity from the early discharge (reverse triage) of hospital inpatients at low risk of untoward events for up to 96 hours. Methods: In a health system with 3 capacity-constrained hospitals that are representative of US facilities (academic, teaching affiliate, community), a variety (N = 50) of inpatient units were prospectively canvassed in rotation using a blocked randomized design for 19 weeks ending in February 2006. Intensive care units (ICUs), nurseries, and pediatric units were excluded. Assuming a disaster occurred on the day of enrollment, patients who did not require any (previously defined) critical intervention for 4 days were deemed suitable for early discharge. Results: Of 3491 patients, 44 % did not require any critical intervention and were suitable for early discharge. Accounting for additional routine patient discharges, full use of staffed and unstaffed licensed beds, gross surge capacity was estimated at 77 %, 95 %, and 103 % for the 3 hospitals. Factoring likely continuance of nonvictim emergency admissions, net surge capacity available for disaster victims was estimated at 66 %, 71 %, and 81 %, respectively. Reverse triage made up the majority (50 %, 55 %, 59 %) of surge beds. Most realized capacity was available within 24 to 48 hours. Conclusions: <b>Hospital</b> <b>surge</b> <b>capacity</b> for standard inpatient beds may be greater than previously believed.

40|$|<b>Hospital</b> <b>surge</b> <b>capacity</b> is {{a crucial}} portion of {{disaster}} preparedness planning within a community. The demands generated by a disaster require additional capacity, {{in the form of}} beds, equipment, personnel, and special capabilities. The scope and urgency of these requirements must be balanced with a practical approach addressing cost and space concerns. The advent of new infectious disease threats, particularly an avian flu pandemic, have reinforced the need to be prepared for a prolonged surge, lasting six to eight weeks, in addition to the shorter duration surges required for industrial accidents, tornados, chemical disasters and terrorists. Using a standardized data form, the surge capacity/capability plan for each hospital in the Greater Dayton Area Hospital Association (GDAHA) was assessed in six areas and compared to the demand projected for an avian flu pandemic using the CDC’s FluAid and FluSurge tools. Using the CDC’s models, the cumulative GDAHA capability exceeds the projected demand for bed space, ICU beds, ventilators, and morgue space. There is a shortage of negative pressure beds, basic equipment for some of the surge rooms, and neuraminidase inhibitors to treat healthcare workers contaminated {{in the course of their}} duties. Many facilities do not have screening plans designed to segregate contaminated patients/staff prior to entering the hospital and do not have a complete set of written policies to address various aspects of a sustained surge. Few facilities have agreements with nursing homes or home health care agencies to care for patients discharged early in order to clear surge beds. Most facilities had programs, such as child care, to accommodate their workers’ needs. However, most of the personnel surge plans were designed for short term events, such as a tornado or an industrial accident, and might not be sustainable for a prolonged surge. If some of the assumptions are changed in the CDC’s models, to match the rates reported from the 1918 pandemic, the surge capacity of GDAHA facilities would not meet the projected demand...|$|E

40|$|Background : Lessons learnt from {{worldwide}} {{disaster and}} public health emergencies such as the earthquake in Haiti 2011 and the 2011 flooding in Pakistani have shown that poor <b>surge</b> <b>capacity</b> increases unnecessary morbidity and mortality. Tanzania has of recent experienced a number of disasters {{and public health}} emergencies. These include the capsizing of the MV Bukoba in 1996 that killed over 1000 people, {{the bombing of the}} United States Embassy in Dar es Salaam in 1998 that killed 11, the influenza outbreak in 2009 and the recent capsizing of MV spice Islander and MV Skagit in 2012 that killed 203 and 144 people respectively. The mortality and morbidity associated with these disasters could have been minimized if the hospital emergency departments where the victims were sent were better prepared to cater for this additional workload in terms of pharmaceutical supplies, medical equipment, and personnel. The <b>surge</b> <b>capacity</b> of <b>Hospitals</b> emergency departments in particular the pharmacy is unknown. Study Objective: To assess <b>hospital</b> pharmacies’ <b>surge</b> <b>capacity</b> for disasters and public health emergencies. Methodology: A cross sectional survey of tertiary hospitals with emergency departments was conducted. Both qualitative and quantitative data collection methods were applied. Guided in-depth interviews were conducted and data was analyzed using content relation analysis. Review of important documents was also done. Results: Thirteen out of fifteen of health personnel working in tertiary health facilities could not define the term <b>surge</b> <b>capacity.</b> Only two out of the seven hospitals reported to have adequate pharmaceutical personnel and the average number of pharmacists per pharmaceutical dispensing unit was less than one. Only one of these had a special pharmaceutical dispensing unit within the emergency department. None of the health facilities had a written disaster management plan. The overall perceived role of pharmaceutical personne l in managing disasters is simply as a drug dispenser. Lack of special pharmaceutical dispensing units for emergency departments, lack of training and out of stocks are the main perceived challenges by pharmaceutical personnel when dispensing during disasters. viii Conclusion: Currently hospital pharmacies in Dar es salaam have limited <b>surge</b> <b>capacity</b> to cater for natural and manmade disasters. This is due to lack of knowledge, available pharmaceutical personnel, training, and appropriate emergency plans and protocols. In addition to this, there is negative perception of the pharmacists’ role in disaster preparedness by pharmaceutical personnel and medical officers, inactive hospital disaster management committees, lack of specialized emergency pharmaceuticals’ dispensing units as well as poor management of the scarcely available emergency pharmaceuticals. Recommendations: Ministry of Health and Social Welfare should formulate a clear plan of action to ensure skilled staff availability by facilitating schools of Pharmacy in the country to enroll more students. They should also revise their curricula accordingly to incorporate basic life saving skills. The Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MoHSW) should conduct continuous education programs in disaster preparedness for all in service pharmaceutical personnel. The Prime Minister’s Office and Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, in collaboration with other stakeholders should prepare a set of regulations to govern the tertiary health facilities, both public and private health facilities in disaster and public health emergencies management...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} different combinations of collaboration strategies to deal with different types of supply chain disruptions, find the best combination, and provide targeting suggestions for investments. Design/methodology/approach – A system dynamics simulation is applied to study a supply chain with three tiers: a producer, a logistics service provider (LSP), and a retailer. There are three types of disruptions to simulate: a producer capacity disruption, an LSP capacity disruption, and a demand disruption. As each tier has the option to choose whether or not to collaborate with the other two tiers, eight (2 × 2 × 2) scenarios are generated to represent different combinations of collaboration strategies. Findings – For a producer capacity disruption, both the producer and the LSP should collaborate by providing their <b>surge</b> <b>capacities,</b> while the retailer does not have to collaborate. For an LSP capacity disruption, the producer should not provide its <b>surge</b> <b>capacity,</b> while the LSP should do so; the retailer does not have to collaborate. For a demand disruption, both the producer and the LSP should not provide their <b>surge</b> <b>capacities,</b> while the retailer should not collaborate but play shortage gaming. Targeting suggestions for investments are provided. Originality/value – Through system dynamics modeling, this study allows the discussion of <b>surge</b> <b>capacity</b> to help supply chain partners and the discussion of shortage gaming when products are oversupplied, in a disruption recovery system over time...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: <b>Surge</b> <b>capacity</b> for {{optimization}} {{of access}} to hospital beds is a limiting factor in response to catastrophic events. Medical facilities, communication tools, manpower, and resource reserves exist to respond to these events. However, these factors may not be optimally functioning to generate an effective and efficient surge response. The objective was to improve the function of these factors. Methods: Regional healthcare facilities and supporting local emergency response agencies developed a coalition (the Healthcare Facilities Partnership of South Central Pennsylvania; HCFP¬SCPA) to increase regional <b>surge</b> <b>capacity</b> and emergency preparedness for healthcare facilities. The coalition focused on 6 objectives: (1) increase awareness of capabilities and assets, (2) develop and pilot test advanced planning and exercising of plans in the region, (3) augment written medical mutual aid agreements, (4) develop and strengthen partnership relationships, (5) ensure National Incident Management System compliance, and (6) develop and test a plan for effective utilization of volunteer healthcare professionals. Results: In comparison to baseline measurements, the coalition improved existing areas covered under all 6 objectives documented during a 24 -month evaluation period.
