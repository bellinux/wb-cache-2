40|$|A novel {{heterogeneous}} {{extractive distillation}} process is considered for separating the azeotropic mixture chloroform – methanol in a batch rectifying column, including {{for the first}} time an experimental validation of the process. Heterogeneous heavy entrainer water is selected inducing an unstable ternary <b>heteroazeotrope</b> and a saddle binary <b>heteroazeotrope</b> with chloroform (ternary diagram class 2. 1 - 2 b). Unlike to well-known heterogeneous azeotropic distillation process and thanks to continuous water feeding at the column top, the saddle binary <b>heteroazeotrope</b> chloroform – water is obtained at the column top, condensed and further split into the liquid – liquid decanter where the chloroform-rich phase is drawn as distillate. First, feasibility analysis is carried out by using a simplified differential model in the extractive section for determining the proper range of the entrainer flowrate and the reflux ratio. The operating conditions and reflux policy are validated by rigorous simulation with ProSim Batch Column ® where technical features of a bench scale distillation column have been described. Six reproducible experiments are run in the bench scale column matching the simulated operating conditions with two sequentially increasing reflux ratio values. Simulation and experiments agree well.

First, the feasibility study of heterogeneous extractive distillation is carried out for determining essential operating conditions such as minimum entrainer flowrate and the proper range of reflux ratio, which provide the expected top and bottom product composition in a batch rectifying column.

40|$|International audienceFollowing {{previous}} studies on heterogeneous batch azeotropic distillation, we evaluate {{the use of}} heterogeneous entrainers for the separation of binary azeotropic mixtures by extractive distillation. This process is well suited for systems where the entrainer forms a saddle heteregeneous azeotrope with anyone of the original components, such systems being unsuitable for non extractive heterogeneous batch distillation processes. Process feasibility is assessed from the isovolatility curves and the volatility order diagram. It tells us whether the homogeneous original component or the <b>heteroazeotrope</b> is drawn at the column top and establishes the distillation tasks sequence using a batch rectifying column. The theoretical insights are validated via rigourous simulation for {{the separation of the}} mixture acetonitrile – water with hexylamine or butyl acetate.

40|$|Many fine chemicals, {{pharmaceuticals}} and speciality {{chemicals are}} produced in batch processes, which generate {{large volumes of}} solvent mixtures as ‘waste’. Due to the interactions between the solvents in these waste mixtures, azeotropes frequently occur. Hence, these solvents cannot be easily recovered by conventional distillation, and the solvent mixtures are usually incinerated. It {{is clear that the}} recovery of spent solvents from these azeotropic solvent mixtures could offer a direct cost saving to many chemical manufacturing companies and a large benefit for the environment. The increased world-wide competitiveness in production has forced the chemical industry to improve their current processes. Consequently, the reorganization of existing process designs and the development of new processes, with the possible integration of new technologies, is of growing importance to industry. Membrane technologies have emerged as an additional category of separation processes to the well-established mass transfer processes. The advantages of membrane separations include high selectivity, low energy consumption, moderate cost to performance ratio, and compact and modular design. In recent years, pervaporation has established itself {{as one of the most}} promising membrane technologies. It offers potential solutions in a wide range of applications from the well-established dehydration of solvents to the recovery of organics from water and the separation of organic/organic mixtures. Within these applications, pervaporation as a stand-alone process has often to compete with conventional, reliable separation processes like distillation, liquid-liquid extraction, adsorption and stripping, the cost of which can be readily calculated. Despite its clear advantages related to its energyefficient character, in many cases pervaporation alone may not supply products suitable for further processing or waste disposal in accordance with environmental standards. Therefore, hybrid processes are regarded as a means of overcoming these limitations. In an attempt to combine the advantages of robust standard thermal separation processes and an alternative, energy-efficient separation technology, a hybrid distillationpervaporation process was developed for the separation of azeotropic batch solvent mixtures. This hybrid concept is an innovative combination of separation techniques that, in many cases, individually fail in satisfactorily and/or efficiently separating azeotropic solvent mixtures and purifying the solvents to the requisite level. While azeotropic distillation is regarded as expensive and insufficiently sustainable due to the addition and recovery of entrainers, pervaporation as a stand-alone process does often not offer sufficient selectivity in the separation of solvent mixtures, especially since there are almost no pervaporation membranes for organic-organic separations on the market. By combining both separation techniques in a hybrid process, however, it is anticipated that solvents could be recovered from waste streams and purified to the targeted quality in an energy-efficient, thus competitive way. This hybrid separation concept was applied to several industrially relevant binary solvent mixtures. In general, an entrainer forming a <b>heteroazeotrope</b> with one of the solvents in the mixture was added first. The search for suitable entrainers was based on residue curve analysis using RegSol software. The ternary solvent mixture was then separated by heteroazeotropic distillation in which the two liquid phases constituting the <b>heteroazeotrope</b> were split by a decanter. Finally, the separated solvents, i. e. the light and heavy phases of the formed <b>heteroazeotrope,</b> were further purified by pervaporation. This contribution will focus on the heteroazeotropic distillation of a acetonitrile/toluene mixture using hexane as entrainer, and the subsequent processing of the obtained acetonitrile-rich heavy phase by pervaporation. status: accepte...|$|E
40|$|A general {{model of}} batch heteroazeotropic {{distillation}} is proposed. Both liquid phases {{present in the}} decanter can be refluxed or withdrawn as distillate, their hold-up can be increased, decreased or kept constant, as well. By assuming maximal separation, that is, that {{the composition of the}} condensate always equals to that of the <b>heteroazeotrope,</b> the still path equation was derived. The still path directions are determined for all the 16 possible operational policies. It is possible to steer the still path in a desired direction by changing the operational parameters, which allows the recovery of a pure component in the still. The still path directions are validated by rigorous simulations for three policies not published yet using the mixture water – formaldehyde – propyl formate. From the 16 operational policies, 11 can be considered as useful in practice. To demonstrate the advantage of using a non-traditional policy, the separation of the mixture aniline – ethylene glycol – water was investigated, as well. By using a non-traditional operational policy with hold-up reduction in the decanter a higher purity of ethylene glycol was obtained in the still...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{separation}} of an ethyl acetate–isooctane mixture by heterogeneous azeotropic distillation in a batch rectifying column. An initial list of 60 candidates was studied but only methanol and acetonitrile were obtained as potential heterogeneous entrainers. These entrainers form a low boiling heterogeneous azeotrope with isooctane. Experimental verification of the miscibility gap with isooctane was performed at 25 °C for each entrainer giving a smaller region for methanol than for acetonitrile. Feasibility of the heterogeneous azeotropic batch distillation was carried out experimentally in a laboratory batch distillation column having 44 theoretical equilibrium stages and using a high reflux ratio. Several distillate fractions were taken {{as a function of}} the temperature at the top of the column. For both methanol and acetonitrile, the main fraction was defined by the condensed vapor providing a liquid–liquid split of the isooctane/entrainer <b>heteroazeotrope</b> into the decanter. Ethyl acetate impurity was detected in both decanted phases, but in much lower amount when using acetonitrile as entrainer. The process with acetonitrile also resulted in a shorter operating time and higher purity and recovery yield of isooctane as the main distillate product. Pure ethyl acetate remained into the boiler at the end of each process...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{regulations}} and constraints have renewed interest for more efficient distillation process in separating azeotropic mixtures and close boiling components. We investigate {{the feasibility of}} heterogeneous extractive distillation process in a continuous column considering several feed point strategies for the entrainer recycle stream and for the main azeotropic feed. Depending on these choices, the heterogeneous distillation column is composed of one, two or three column sections. A differential mass balance model enables to compute continuous liquid composition profiles of the rectifying, extractive and stripping sections. Unlike homogeneous extractive distillation, reflux policy composed by a single or both decanted liquid phases is considered {{as well as the}} external feeding influence on the composition of the top column liquid stream. Limiting operating conditions of key parameters like the entrainer/feed flowrate ratio and reflux ratio required to obtain a target top and bottom product compositions are obtained. For illustration, separation of acetonitrile – water mixture using butyl acetate as a heavy heterogeneous entrainer is selected. In this case, withdrawal of a saddle binary <b>heteroazeotrope</b> is the main difference of this process compared with the well known heterogeneous azeotropic distillation process where the top vapor product is the lower boiling point of the ternary system...|$|E
40|$|A {{systematic}} {{study of}} the separation of the azeotropic mixture chloroform – methanol by heterogeneous extractive distillation process is addressed in this work by using a batch rectifying column. Water was selected as an effective heavy entrainer adding to the resulting ternary system one unstable heterogeneous ternary azeotrope and one saddle heterogeneous binary azeotrope with chloroform. Unlike to well-known heteroazeotropic distillation process, the saddle binary <b>heteroazeotrope</b> chloroform – water can be drawn as a top condensed vapour thanks to the feeding of water at the first tray of the column. Therefore, the splitting of two liquid phases occurs into the top decanter and the chloroform-rich phase can be drawn as distillate product. The zeotropic mixture methanol – water left in the still can be separated in a further conventional batch distillation step. First, the process performance was determined by using rigorous simulation with the batch process simulator ProSim Batch taking into the technical features of the real bench batch distillation column. Experimental validation of the computed operating conditions for the extractive distillation step (reflux ratio and entrainer flowrate) was performed in the bench rectifying distillation column. One litre of the organic waste mainly composed by chloroform and methanol was separated adding continuously 20 mol/h of water at 25 °C in the column top. Two constant reflux ratios, R= 1. 4 and R= 10, was kept in the extractive distillation step during 1 h and 20 minutes, respectively. Good agreement was obtained between simulation and experimental results. More than 85 % of recovery yield can be obtained of each original component with a molar purity higher than 0. 99 by using the proposed heterogeneous extractive distillation processes. This novel technology can be implemented at industrial scale for treatment of this organic waste and both azeotropic components can be reused in the genuine process...|$|E
40|$|Many fine {{chemicals}} and speciality chemicals are produced in batch processes, which generate solvent mixtures as ‘waste’. Due to {{the interaction between}} these solvents azeotropes occur. Therefore these solvents cannot be easily recovered by conventional distillation, and the solvent mixtures are incinerated. However, the recovery of solvents would be a direct cost saving for companies and a large benefit for the environment. A hybrid separation process was developed for the separation of azeotropic solvent mixtures. This hybrid concept is an innovative combination of separation techniques, which are individually not sufficient {{to have a good}} separation. The concept combines a clean, alternative technology (pervaporation) and a more robust standard technology (distillation). Pervaporation as a stand- alone process is usually not sufficiently selective for such organic-organic separations, while distillation is regarded as insufficiently sustainable. By combining both in a hybrid system, however, it is anticipated that solvents can be purified in an efficient, yet energy- saving way. The separation of a toluene/acetonitrile mixture was investigated by two different separation processes. Both processes start with the addition of an entrainer to the solvent mixture, which forms a <b>heteroazeotrope</b> with one of the solvents. To find the optimal entrainer, residue curve analysis by the RegSol software was used. Then the entrainer poor phase was purified by either conventional distillation or pervaporation. For pervaporation, a wide range of commercial membranes was tested. Residue curve analysis showed that n-hexane was the optimal entrainer for the heteroazeotropic distillation. The distillate separates in two layers. The hexane rich light phase issent back to the column. The acetonitrile rich phase contains about 95 mole% acetonitrile and 5 % hexane. The acetonitrile rich phase was treated with either conventional distillation or pervaporation. Two commercial PDMS based membranes, i. e. PERVAP 4060 a nd Pervatech PDMS and a novel hydrophobic membrane developed by VITO clearly performed best in terms of hexane/acetonitrile selectivity and permeate flux. Hexane can be almost completely removed by all three membranes leading to a acetonitrile purity > 99, 9 mole%). These processes were successfully applied on both laboratory and pilot scale and. First calculations of both CAPEX and OPEX showed that the cost of the process which combines a heteroazeotropic distillation and a conventional distillation is about 0. 5 euro/kg recovered solvent. The costs of the hybrid system are expected to be slightly larger,because of higher investment costs related to the pervaporation unit and membrane modules, which is not fully compensated by the lower energy costs. On the other hand, life cycle analysis shows that the most preferable process from an ecological point-of-view is the combination of heteroazeotropic distillation and pervaporation, due to the lower energy consumption. This study shows that a combination of a heteroazeotropic distillation and either conventional distillation or pervaporation is a technically feasible and cost efficient technique to separate the studied azeotropic toluene- acetonitrile mixture. The recovery of the valuable organic solvents from azeotropic mixtures is therefore economically and ecologically preferred to their incineration. status: publishe...|$|E
