40|$|Many {{distributed}} applications {{make use of}} distributed object technology. In this kind of systems, modules providing services are implemented as objects spread over a network. Distributed objects are usually accessed through communication frameworks based on specific middleware solutions, such as CORBA, DCOM, and RMI. Applications of this kind might be built up (or extended) integrating different modules, possibly already coded and available on the market. Each required and available module might use a specific communication framework, hampering its prompt integration into a system exploiting a different framework. A convenient way to tackle this problem is the insertion of a <b>gateway</b> <b>module,</b> passing service requests between two different middleware solutions. This approach allows a quick integration of service modules, but {{it could lead to}} performance problems, due to the introduced communication overhead. In this paper, we report our experience in developing a simple CORBA/RMI <b>gateway</b> <b>module,</b> and we discuss how it affects the application performance. Measures of the communication overhead show that the employment of the gateway is a viable solution in many real-world applications, and gives hints for efficiently placing modules on the available hosts...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{the wide}} variety of PHDs, the tasks related to PHD {{management}} have become more complicated than ever. In this paper, we propose a message processing scheme at an integrated PHD gateway that serves various PHDs. On receiving the ISO/IEEE-based health messages generated by PHDs, the PHD <b>gateway</b> <b>module</b> in the gateway puts the messages together to generate an integrated message and send it to the integrated PHD management server. ISO/IEEE 11073 protocol has to be extended when there are multiple and diverse PHDs to be managed, because the protocol does not specify how to process the diverse health messages generated by various PHDs. Therefore, in this paper, attribute IDs are assigned hierarchically to identify a specific attribute generated by a specific PHD and passed through a specific gateway. When the DM <b>gateway</b> <b>module</b> in the gateway receives an integrated OMA DM-based PHD management message from the server, the gateway separates its various parts to generate individual messages and send them to the related PHDs. For this purpose, OMA DM protocol is extended and the DM trees are managed hierarchically. Some examples of message processing (integration and separation) at the gateway are shown...|$|E
40|$|The {{issue of}} {{integrating}} mobile devices into smart environments for control purposes has {{been dealt with}} several times before. Most approaches lead to web-technology (browser visualisation) based solutions because the platform-independent thin-client concept allows {{the use of a}} broad range of devices. Other approaches are known, which have different advantages, but have to be regarded as more or less proprietary because of their platform-dependency. This novel approach aims at realising a platform-independent solution without the classical drawbacks of client-server communication in terms of real-time status consistency. For this purpose, the opportunities offered by a new API called JSR- 82 are taken, i. e. using Bluetooth access from Java-Midlets in mobile devices, e. g. mobile phones. These platform-independent applications are provided by a webservice, which takes the project information and the user’s personal preferences to generate a personalised Midlet, which afterwards is sent to the user’s mobile device (over-the-air provisioning, assuming a mobile phone is used). The data representation and code generation is mainly based on XML and XSL transformations. Having received the tailored application and plugged the developed module performing the Bluetooth gateway functionality onto a BCU, bidirectional real-time communication is made possible. According to the desired seamless integration into KNX environments, the <b>gateway</b> <b>module</b> is realised as a standard KNX application module that can be plugged onto a standard BCU 1. The mobile device becomes a part of the KNX environment by being connected to this <b>gateway</b> <b>module</b> by a “Bluetooth PEI”...|$|E

However, in heterogeneous environments, virtualized wireless sensor networks (VWSN) raises new challenges such {{as the need for}} on-the-fly, dynamic, elastic and scalable provisioning of gateways. Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) is an emerging paradigm that can certainly aid in tackling these new challenges. It leverages standard virtualization technology to consolidate special-purpose network elements on top of commodity hardware. This article presents a case study on NFV based gateways for VWSNs.

40|$|Abstract — Denial-of-Service (DoS) {{flooding}} {{attacks have}} become {{a serious threat to}} the reliability of the Internet. Web servers face all kinds of users; some of them engage malicious activities to degrade or completely block network services, such as flooding attacks. As a result, lots of resource and bandwidth on web sites might be wasted. While many approaches exist to filter network-level attacks, the application level attacks are harder to detect at the firewall. Filtering at this level can be computationally expensive and difficult to scale, while still producing false positives that block legitimate users. This paper presents a web application level approach to mitigate DoS attacks. The proposed method is to build a security <b>gateway</b> <b>module</b> with reverse proxy support that provides attack surface reduction enhancements against the HTTP Flood Attacks at the web application level. Web-based anomaly detection with reverse HTTP proxy which intercepts traffic and protects web application by providing users with a CAPTCHA to verify legitimate requests is used...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to build prototypes of Wireless Sensor Network rapidly based on virtual instruments technology. There are two different methods introduced in this paper. One of the two methods uses WSN (short for Wireless Sensor Network) Node and WSN Gateway manufactured by NI (short for National Instruments). The other method adopts Compact RIO (short for Reconfigurable Input and Output) and GPRS (short for General Packet Radio Service) module. Though they are two different methods, they have the same structure. Both of the two methods adopt DAQ (short for data acquisition) card and sensors to acquire specified data. The DAQ card and sensors compose a node which can sense and process data. Different nodes form a local area WSN. Nodes within a local area WSN communicate with each other via ZigBee or other means of communication. The local area WSN can access the Internet via a WSN <b>Gateway</b> or GPRS <b>module.</b> Modular hardware and graphic programming language LabVIEW (short for Laboratory Virtual Instrumentation Engineering Workbench) are adopted in this proposed approach...|$|R
40|$|For the old MR (Main Ring), {{deionization}} {{was done}} with two columns in CUB, using an ion exchange process. Typically 65 GPM of LCW flew through a column, and the resistivity was raised from 3 Mohm-cm to over 12 Mohm-cm. After a few weeks, columns lost their effectiveness {{and had to be}} regenerated in a process involving backwashing and adding hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide. For normal MR operations, LCW returned from the ring and passed through the two columns in parallel for deionization, although the system could have been operated satisfactorily with only one in use. A 3000 gallon reservoir (the Spheres) provided a reserve of LCW for allowing water leaks and expansions in the MR. During the MI (Main Injector) construction period, the third DI column was added to satisfy requirements for the MI. When the third column was added, the old regeneration controller was replaced with a new controller based on an Allen-Bradley PLC (i. e., SLC- 5 / 04). The PLC is widely used and well documented, and therefore it may allow us to modify the regeneration programs in the future. In addition to the above regeneration controller, the old control panels (which were used to manipulate pumps and valves to supply LCW in Normal mode and to do Int. Recir.
