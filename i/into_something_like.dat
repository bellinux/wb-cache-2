25|$|Under the {{supervision}} of the squatters, demonstrators expanded the barricades. They stole trailers and building materials from a nearby construction site to build more barricades. Soon the obstacles covered several streets, in places four or five layers deep. Cobblestones from the streets were broken up and distributed for use as missiles. Soon, the whole street had been turned <b>into</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> a fortress. After an hour, the police attacked with 50 men. They were quickly turned back by a hail of stones and iron pellets fired from slingshots. Several police officers were injured. The police then retreated, and both sides regrouped. Around 600 people, primarily youths, had chosen to remain behind the barricades and help the squatters defend the house.|$|E
500|$|An early {{interpretation}} of the film uses dream analysis to explain that the first part is a dream of the real Diane Selwyn, who has cast her dream-self as the innocent and hopeful [...] "Betty Elms", reconstructing her history and persona <b>into</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> an old Hollywood film. In the dream, Betty is successful, charming, and lives the fantasy life of a soon-to-be-famous actress. The last one-fifth of the film presents Diane's real life, in which she has failed both personally and professionally. She arranges for Camilla, an ex-lover, to be killed, and unable {{to cope with the}} guilt, re-imagines her as the dependent, pliable amnesiac Rita. Clues to her inevitable demise, however, continue to appear throughout her dream.|$|E
500|$|Maple {{ultimately}} described Murrell as [...] "the greatest {{and certainly}} the most influential of all the Cunning Men of the Essex marshlands", and elsewhere he termed him [...] "perhaps {{the last of the}} great Cunning Men", noting that upon his death Murrell [...] "became part of the great heritage of English witch mythology". Having studied the cunning man's legacy during the late 1950s, Maple believed that Murrell [...] "succeeded in agitating the old fear of witchcraft <b>into</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> a mania" [...] among the local community, and that [...] "in doing so he unwittingly preserved the old traditions and folktales for a generation beyond their normal span, and in this respect folklorists are in his debt". The historian Ronald Hutton has characterised Murrell as the [...] "most celebrated cunning man in the whole of nineteenth-century southern England".|$|E

500|$|Most {{reviews for}} Silent Hill: Origins were positive; its {{original}} release on the PSP received a Metacritic aggregate score of 78 out of 100. GameDaily wrote that Origins [...] "impressively brings {{all the elements}} we love about the Silent Hill franchise to a portable format that works wonderfully." [...] Shane Bettenhausen of 1UP.com concluded, [...] "Sure, it's predictable, conventional, {{and a little bit}} short, not to mention ill-suited for brief pick-up-and-play sessions on the bus, but we're encouraged to see developers making an original, console-quality experience for PSP." [...] According to Kristan Reed of Eurogamer, [...] "No doubt mindful of remaining faithful to the series' legacy, Climax pays such close attention to the ingredients of the first three Silent Hill games that it's basically an unapologetic homage to them." [...] While stating that Origins would appeal to fans for its story that adds to the series' mythos, Game Informer added, [...] "Unfortunately, the game has fallen <b>into</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> a rut in most other areas and less fanatical gamers won't be as forgiving of its faults." ...|$|E
500|$|The large {{positive}} {{response to the}} alpha footage convinced the studio to develop Goat Simulator as a full title to Steam, putting more people on the title. The team, having no plans for a full release, debated on whether to approach a large publisher to receive funding {{to help make the}} title <b>into</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> Grand Theft Auto, but decided to stay with a small, inexpensive title that would be truer to the teaser video. Recognizing that the glitching was part of the game's appeal, Ibrisagic only sought to fix software bugs that might cause the game to crash, leaving in the other glitches and bugs associated with the physics engine as the results from these were [...] "really hilarious". They limited themselves to a short development time of four weeks without significant management oversight as to set an urgent but realistic goal to bring the game to a playable state. Ibrisagic felt it was important for the game to be supported on Steam, but initially feared that Valve Corporation would not accept the quirky title. He instead found Valve to be welcoming of the title, including a joking response from the company that stated [...] " [...] has started wearing a goat costume to work he’s so excited about this game". As part of its release, Coffee Stain added support for Steam Workshop which would let players modify the game, aware that players would likely create levels and scenarios that will glitch and crash the game for humorous results. While the physics engine allows for spectacular rendering of destruction of the game environment, which is a main feature of the game, Coffee Stain acknowledged the downside of this as [...] "it would synchronise terribly in multiplayer". They estimated that adding multiplayer would remove [...] "90 percent of the physics" [...] and many other features, and left the game as a single player title at launch. The studio considered that it only spent a couple months to complete the Windows version, and opted to outsource versions for OS X and Linux, with Ryan Gordon handling the porting.|$|E

[...] He praised the staff's helpfulness in finding another place to valet-park his car with two bicycles on top, and the two half-liter water bottles and Toblerone candy bars on the desk when he came in. He had a few minor complaints: at the time (2007) the hotel did not have free Wi-Fi, the room's light switch could not function as a dimmer, and the hotel would stock the mini-bar only on a guest's request.|$|E
