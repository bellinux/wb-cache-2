25|$|There is no {{evidence}} that I can find in Being and Event that the author really understands what <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> when he invokes (as he constantly does) Georg Cantor's theory of transfinite cardinals, the axioms of set theory, Gödel's incompleteness proof or Paul Cohen's proof of the independence of the continuum hypothesis. When these things appear in Badiou's texts it is always allusively, with fragments of symbolism detached from the context that endows them with sense, and often with free variables and bound variables colliding randomly. No proof is clearly stated or examined, and the jargon of set theory is waved like a magician's wand, to give authority to bursts of all but unintelligible metaphysics.|$|E
25|$|Boys {{continues}} {{the story of}} the schoolboys and Ilyusha last referred to in Book Four. The book begins with the introduction of the young boy Kolya Krasotkin. Kolya is a brilliant boy who proclaims his atheism, socialism, and beliefs in the ideas of Europe. He seems destined to follow in the spiritual footsteps of Ivan Karamazov; Dostoyevsky uses Kolya's beliefs especially in a conversation with Alyosha to poke fun at his Westernizer critics by putting their beliefs in {{what appears to be a}} young boy who doesn't exactly know what <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about.</b> Kolya is bored with life and constantly torments his mother by putting himself in danger. As part of a prank Kolya lies between railroad tracks as a train passes over and becomes something of a legend for the feat. All the other boys look up to Kolya, especially Ilyusha. Since the narrative left Ilyusha in Book Four, his illness has progressively worsened and the doctor states that he will not recover. Kolya and Ilyusha had a falling out over Ilyusha's maltreatment of a dog: Ilyusha had fed it bread in which there was a pin on Smerdyakov's suggestion. But thanks to Alyosha's intervention the other schoolboys have gradually reconciled with Ilyusha, and Kolya soon joins them at his bedside. It is here that Kolya first meets Alyosha and begins to reassess his nihilist beliefs.|$|E

500|$|The cold opening {{references}} several notable {{bands and}} musicians: the scene consists of Ryan complaining because he recently heard—erroneously—that notable musician Smokey Robinson died.

However, Ryan, on the bequest of Pam, is only able to name one song that Robinson sung, [...] "The Tracks of My Tears".

2500|$|The {{commander}} of the Army of the Potomac, Maj. Gen. George Meade, and his cavalry commander, Maj. Gen.

2500|$|Generals Meade and Sheridan had quarreled {{about the}} cavalry's {{performance}} {{throughout the campaign}} and this incident with Wilson, compounding the frustration of the uncleared Brock Road, brought Meade's notorious temper to a boil. After a heated exchange laced with expletives on both sides, Sheridan told Meade that he could [...] "whip Stuart" [...] if Meade let him.

[...] Meade deferred to Grant's judgment and issued orders to Sheridan to [...] "proceed against the enemy's cavalry" [...] and from May 9 through May 24, sent him on a raid toward Richmond, directly challenging the Confederate cavalry. The raid was less successful than hoped; although his raid managed to mortally wound Confederate cavalry commander Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart at Yellow Tavern on May 11 and beat Maj. Gen. Fitzhugh Lee at Meadow Bridge on May 12, the raid never seriously threatened Richmond and it left Grant without cavalry intelligence for Spotsylvania and North Anna. Historian Gordon C. Rhea wrote, [...] "By taking his cavalry from Spotsylvania Court House, Sheridan severely handicapped Grant in his battles against Lee. The Union Army was deprived of his eyes and ears during a critical juncture in the campaign. And Sheridan's decision to advance boldly to the Richmond defenses smacked of unnecessary showboating that jeopardized his command." ...|$|E
2500|$|Their {{relationship}} was severely tested when Chrissie {{made contact with}} Mark's father, Frank Williams.

What she does not know is that the issues between Mark and his father are nothing compared to the issues between Mark's father and Tricia, his daughter-in-law." [...] Indeed, Tricia was extremely pensive about the reunion, even more so when Frank was taken ill and admitted to the hospital. Sharon Maughan expanded on the storyline: [...] "Tricia's horrified when Lisa tells her that Frank had a suspected stroke in the night and was rambling on about Chrissie being his daughter. At first, Tricia claims that Frank doesn't know what <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> because he is ill. But later, when Lisa finds her crying, she breaks down and reveals that Frank raped her when she was a teenager, during the time she was married to Mark." [...] Tricia had Frank take a secret paternity test, confirming that he was indeed Chrissie's biological father. [...] As his condition deteriorated, she lied, claiming that he had expressed an instruction that he did not wish to be resuscitated. Frank died, and Tricia hoped that Chrissie's true paternity could remain a secret.|$|E

2500|$|The {{views of}} the {{majority}} of the post-war British military establishment were made succinctly by Slim (commander of the Fourteenth Army), when he wrote [...] "... the Chindits, gave a splendid example of courage and hardihood. Yet I came firmly to the conclusion that such formations, trained, equipped and mentally adjusted for one kind of operation were wasteful. They did not give, militarily, a worth-while return for the resources in men, material and time that they absorbed. ... were usually formed by attracting the best men ... The result of these methods was undoubtedly to lower the quality of the rest of the Army". He makes several other arguments against special forces, about the danger of ordinary battalions thinking that some tasks could only be performed by special forces, and that special forces can only stay in the field for relatively short periods compared to regular battalions. He sums up that [...] "Anything, whatever the short cuts to victory it may promise, which thus weakens the Army spirit is dangerous". [...] To underline his point he suggests that [...] "This cult of special forces is as sensible as to form a Royal Corps of Tree Climbers and say that no soldier, who does not wear its green hat with a bunch of oak leaves stuck in it should be expected to climb a tree". [...] He does acknowledge the need for small units to stir up trouble in the enemy's rear area but does not make it clear if <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> V Force or the actions of Force 136.|$|E
2500|$|BevMo! employs Wilfred Wong, {{an expert}} taster and wine {{competition}} judge, who assigns bottles a wine rating {{based on his}} own version of Robert M. Parker, Jr.'s 50–100-point system. Wong, a veteran industry analyst and wine writer who has written regular columns for Vineyard & Winery Management magazine and Beverage Industry News, tastes some 8,000 bottles a year for BevMo!, and may taste 40 wines a day. A San Francisco native and resident who grew up working in his family's upscale grocery store in the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood, Wong was hired to work for BevMo! in 1995, when they had six stores. He told a New York Times reporter in 2006 that it can be tricky working as a wine critic inside a large retail chain that sells wine—there can be conflicts between appropriate scoring for a wine and business plans for that wine. He reported that he has, upon occasion, been encouraged by company management to give a high score to a wine, especially one that did not receive a high rating from other reviewers, or one that was purchased by BevMo! at a good price. Wong said, [...] "we have fights all the time." [...] Wong made assurances that he does not treat a wine to a good score based on company founders' wishes. Executive VP David Richards agrees: [...] "If we were to impinge on Wilfred's credibility, it would be very bad for our brand." [...] Wong reports only to Richards, to keep him from being influenced by wine sellers or BevMo!'s own buyers. Richards said, [...] "we have to give him independence within the organization." [...] Alder Yarrow, publisher of the wine blog Vinography.com, said of Wong, [...] "he is not a shill... He knows what <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> when it comes to wine." [...] Professor Emeritus Robert Smiley, Director of Wine Studies, Graduate School of Management, University of California, Davis, said about Wong's ratings: [...] "I {{think this is a good}} innovation and he's helpful to the consumer. It brings more people to BevMo and it probably moves them up in price because typically, the higher-price wines get the better scores." [...] Smiley said that shoppers were too smart to be fooled: [...] "If Wilfred and BevMo fix the ratings, people will catch on and go elsewhere." ...|$|E
2500|$|At a {{cocktail}} party hosted by the courtesan Magda, the poet Prunier expounds his theories on love. Magda's friends Yvette, Bianca and Suzy playfully mock him, while Lisette, Magda's maid, tells him {{he does not know}} what <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about.</b> Prunier takes offence and Magda orders Lisette to leave. Prunier maintains that no one is immune to romantic love and sings the first verse of his latest song about Doretta, who rejected a king as her suitor because of the value she placed on true love. He does not know how to finish the song, so Magda takes over and provides the second verse: she recounts how Doretta {{falls in love with a}} student (Aria: Chi il bel sogno di Doretta). Magda's guests are charmed by her performance and her long-term protector Rambaldo gives her a pearl necklace. Lisette enters to announce the arrival of a young man – the son of an old school friend of Rambaldo. Lisette is ordered by Rambaldo to bring in the guest. Suddenly nostalgic, Magda recalls her life as a young working girl and happy evenings spent dancing at Bullier's, where she first experienced love (Aria: Ore dolci e divine). [...] Some of the guests suggest that Prunier should compose a song based on Magda's story but he declares a preference for songs about perverse heroines, such as Berenice or Salome. Prunier demonstrates his skills at palmistry to some of the girls, while Lisette brings in the visitor, Ruggero. He has an introduction from his father for Rambaldo. Prunier reads Magda's palm and tells her that she is like a swallow: she longs for migration towards the sun and true love. Ruggero explains that it is his first visit to Paris and asks where he may find the best place to spend an evening: after much discussion, Lisette recommends Bullier's. Ruggero leaves. Magda chides the other guests for mocking him. After they too have gone, she tells Lisette that she will remain at home that evening. Then, on a whim, she determines to disguise herself and go to Bullier's as well. She goes to get changed. Prunier returns in secret to escort Lisette to Bullier's and flirts extravagantly with her. Lisette is wearing Magda's hat and Prunier tells her that he dislikes it and orders her to take it off. They then set out together. Magda re-enters, disguised as a working girl. She sings a fragment of Prunier's song about Doretta as she leaves, happily anticipating an adventure.|$|E
