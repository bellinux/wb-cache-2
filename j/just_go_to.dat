5|$|Drug use {{is often}} portrayed in {{conjunction}} with the hippie subculture, through hippie characters, such as the two teenagers that give LSD to Mackey, and the woman that he befriends and eventually marries. Jimbo and Cartman both use the term hippie pejoratively. During their argument, Jimbo tells Mackey that he should <b>just</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> a Grateful Dead concert, to which Mackey says he can't since Jerry Garcia is deceased. On two occasions, the episode shows people watching Teletubbies while high on marijuana or in rehab. In his drug prevention speech, Mackey claims that LSD was made famous by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, former members of The Beatles. Both Lennon and McCartney are known to have experimented with the drug.|$|E

500|$|Todd's rampant {{popularity}} intruded on Howarth's life. [...] "It's really {{starting to}} frustrate me because I can't <b>just</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> work anymore," [...] he said. He stopped {{doing a lot of}} press interviews after female fans screamed [...] "Rape me, Todd" [...] at fan events, and because of his disagreement with Todd's redemption arc. His comings-and-goings from time to time throughout the years, even though the role of Todd had been re-cast with St. John, were greeted with anticipation, excitement, and speculation from the fans. At one point in 2000, Howarth returned for a week, accompanied by significant fanfare, in order to assist with the departure of Florencia Lozano (Teá). During the ten years he was on the show, rumors of his departures were reported sometimes weekly by the soap opera press.|$|E
500|$|The {{audience}} response at Presley's live shows {{became increasingly}} fevered. Moore recalled, [...] "He'd start out, 'You ain't nothin' but a Hound Dog,' and they'd <b>just</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> pieces. They'd always react the same way. There'd be a riot every time." [...] At the two concerts he performed in September at the Mississippi-Alabama Fair and Dairy Show, 50 National Guardsmen {{were added to}} the police security to prevent crowd trouble. Elvis, Presley's second album, was released in October and quickly rose to number one. The album includes [...] "Old Shep", which he sang at the talent show in 1945, and which now marked the first time he played piano on an RCA session. According to Guralnick, one can hear [...] "in the halting chords and the somewhat stumbling rhythm both the unmistakable emotion and the equally unmistakable valuing of emotion over technique." [...] Assessing the musical and cultural impact of Presley's recordings from [...] "That's All Right" [...] through Elvis, rock critic Dave Marsh wrote that [...] "these records, more than any others, contain the seeds of what rock & roll was, has been and most likely what it may foreseeably become." ...|$|E

[...] She did not give evidence but was awarded custody of Alexis and $200 a month in child support. She left Wichita as soon as Alexis was returned to her. Her reunion with her daughter was uncertain to the last, as Hubbard had second thoughts about letting her go as he drove Northrup and Alexis to the local airport. She persuaded him that the compulsion instilled by the communists would be dissipated by going ahead with the flight: [...] "Well, I have to follow their dictates. I'll <b>just</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the airplane." [...] She was so desperate to leave by the time she got to the airport that she left behind her daughter's clothes and her own suitcase and one of Alexis's shoes fell off as she dashed to the plane. [...] "I just ran across the airfield, across the runways, to the airport and got on the plane. And it was the nineteenth of June and it was the happiest day of my life." ...|$|E

500|$|Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter said, [...] "Avengers: Age of Ultron {{succeeds in}} the top {{priority}} of creating a worthy opponent for its superheroes and giving the latter a few new things to do, {{but this time the}} action scenes don't always measure up." [...] Scott Foundas of Variety wrote, [...] "If this is what the apotheosis of branded, big-studio entertainment has come to look like in 2015, we could be doing much worse. Unlike its title character, Age of Ultron most definitely has soul." [...] Writing for the Chicago Sun-Times and giving the film three-and-a-half out of four stars, Richard Roeper said, [...] "Some day, an Avengers film might collapse under the weight of its own awesomeness. I mean, how many times can they save the world? But this is not that day." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote, [...] "Age of Ultron is a whole summer of fireworks packed into one movie. It doesn't <b>just</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> 11, it starts there. [...] takes a few wrong turns, creating a jumble when the action gets too thick. But he recovers like a pro, devising a spectacle that's epic {{in every sense of the}} word." [...] Matt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com gave the film three out of four stars, stating that despite being [...] "bigger, louder and more disjointed" [...] than its predecessor, [...] "it’s also got more personality—specifically Whedon's—than any other film in the now seven-year-old franchise." [...] Helen O'Hara of Empire praised the interactions between the characters, the action set-pieces and Whedon's ability as a director in her review, stating that the film [...] "redefines the scale we can expect from our superheroes." ...|$|E

[...] The scandal became notorious as the [...] "Rome Walkout". Callas brought a lawsuit against the Rome Opera House, {{but by the time the}} case was settled thirteen years later and the Rome Opera was found to be at fault for having refused to provide an understudy, Callas's career was already over.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the spring}} of 1956, Presley was fast {{becoming}} a national phenomenon and teenagers came to his concerts in unprecedented numbers. There were many riots at his early concerts. Scotty Moore recalled: [...] "He’d start out, 'You ain’t nothin’ but a Hound Dog,' and they’d <b>just</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> pieces. They’d always react the same way. There’d be a riot every time." [...] Bob Neal wrote: [...] "It was almost frightening, the reaction... from teenage boys. So many of them, through some sort of jealousy, would practically hate him." [...] In Lubbock, Texas, a teenage gang fire-bombed Presley's car. Some performers became resentful (or resigned to the fact) that Presley going on stage before them would [...] "kill" [...] their own act; he thus rose quickly to top billing. At the two concerts he performed at the 1956 Mississippi-Alabama Fair and Dairy Show, one hundred National Guardsmen were on hand to prevent crowd trouble.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, on 60 Minutes, he told Mike Wallace {{that his}} life could have turned out differently. [...] "I'd got {{accepted}} to a seminary in Wisconsin, and I was gonna become a priest, {{but at the last}} second I thought, 'I'll <b>just</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> public school.' I had just gotten a new amplifier in my bedroom, and I didn't think I was allowed to take it with me." [...] Instead, he got accepted into the famed Cass Technical High School as a business major, and played the drums and trombone in the band. At 15, he began a three-year upholstery apprenticeship with a family friend, Brian Muldoon. He credits Muldoon with exposing him to punk music as they worked together in the shop. Muldoon goaded his young apprentice into forming a band: [...] "He played drums", Gillis thought. [...] "Well I guess I'll play guitar then." [...] The two recorded an album, Makers of High Grade Suites, as the Upholsterers.|$|E
2500|$|Guitarist Michael Einziger {{noted that}} his {{contributions}} to the album were influenced by his musical studies during the band's hiatus: [...] "Maybe my desire to return to simplicity, or even to <b>just</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> simplicity - because I've never really written music that simple before — {{is sort of a}} response to maybe having a better or larger perspective of the overall musical landscape that I’ve never had before." [...] Einziger elaborated further, [...] "Over the years, we've become less and less aggressive as far as our music goes. There's always moments of that aggression, but this album is pretty free of that. It's definitely not a hard rock record. I think we're asking a lot of our fans. We're asking them to listen for things that they normally wouldn't listen for. We're not leaning on the strengths of our last records either. It's that much different than our previous work. I think we took a risk by making this type of album. But it's not some crazy, experimental album." [...] Vocalist Brandon Boyd cited Einziger as a key reason for the band's new direction, noting [...] "Michael really buckled down and studied musical composition that inspired him to reach out and dig into different places that he never has before." ...|$|E

2500|$|When the {{families}} finally meet for the eventual “pamamanhikan” at the palatial Fuentebella residence, what starts as a civilized encounter between two families escalates into a hilarious rich-versus-poor mano-a-mano where Tracy's grandfather (Jaime Fabregas) insulted the Polotan's family, {{a scenario that}} turns the mansion into a madhouse of outlandish proportions which resulted in Rock and Tracy's separation. Rock got depressed and did not leave his room for three days. [...] He was confronted by his mother Rose, saying that life must go on. Rose thinks her son is still young for fatherhood, so she is {{not in favor of}} the marriage. Nick thinks the family would be in shame if Tracy will raise a child with no father, so he wants the wedding to push through as soon as possible. Elaine, who also got pregnant at a young age does not want her daughter to experience a forced marriage and get trapped in a loveless marriage as {{what had happened to her}} and her husband, Nick. Elaine suggested that it would be better if Tracey would <b>just</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the USA and give birth there, but before Tracy's departure, Rock was able to sneak into Tracy's room, and they elope. The two then sent an MMS to their families stating that they got married in the City hall. The two parties become so depressed because of Rock and Tracey's decision. Elaine seems to be disappointed with Nick. She thinks that Nick is not a good father to Tracy so their daughter grew up to be imperfect person. She decides to leave, but on her way out of the estate, Nick stops her and professes his undying love, stating that it would be best if they will try to start again. On the other hand, Rose and Pol also renew their love. Meanwhile, Brent (Coleta), Rock's best friend who is a closeted gay and is secretly in love with Rock, professes his love when they were drunk but the two remain best friends. In the end, the two families are able to accept the fate of Rock and Tracy who become parents at 19. The movie ends with the cast singing [...] "Pag-Ibig", and [...] "I Do Bidoo Bidoo".|$|E
