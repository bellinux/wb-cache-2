40|$|International audiencePosaconazole is {{extensively}} {{used for}} prophylaxis for invasive fungal infections. The <b>gastro-resistant</b> <b>tablet</b> formulation {{has allowed the}} bioavailability issues encountered with the oral suspension to be overcome. However, overexposure is now frequent. This study aimed to (i) describe the pharmacokinetics of posaconazole tablets in a real-life cohort of patients with hematological malignancies and (ii) perform Monte Carlo simulations to assess {{the possibility that the}} daily dose can be reduced while keeping a sufficient exposure. Forty-nine consecutive inpatients were prospectively included in the study. Posaconazole trough concentrations (TC) were measured once a week, and biological and demographic data were collected. The concentrations were analyzed by compartmental modeling, and Monte Carlo simulations were performed using estimated parameters to assess the rate of attainment of the target TC after dose reduction. The pharmacokinetics of posaconazole were well described using a one-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination. The values of the parameters (interindividual variabilities) were as follows: the absorption constant (k(a)) was 0. 588 h(- 1) (fixed), the volume of distribution (V/F) was 420 liters (28. 2 %), and clearance (CL/F) was 7. 3 liters/h (24. 2 %) with 31. 9 % interoccasion variability. Forty-nine percent of the simulated patients had TC at steady state of >= 1. 5 mu g/ml and maintained a TC above 1 mu g/ml after a reduction of the dose to 200 mg daily. A third of these patients eligible for a dose reduction had TC of >= 1. 5 mu g/ml as soon as 48 h of treatment. Though posaconazole tablets were less impacted by bioavailability issues than the oral suspension, the pharmacokinetics of posaconazole tablets remain highly variable. Simulations showed that approximately half of the patients would benefit from a reduction of the dose from 300 mg to 200 mg while keeping the TC above the minimal recommended target of 0. 7 mu g/ml, resulting in a 33 % savings in the cost of this very expensive drug...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. The {{properties}} of colostrum were recognized and investigated more thoroughly {{in the first}} half of the eighties, when the immune factors and growth factors it contains were pointed out. Numerous studies show that the administration of colostrum benefits the subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus as it gradually regulates appetite, improves utilization of nutrients, especially glucose, and leads to a significant decrease in body fat. Materials and Methods. The following study is aimed at verifying a possible reduction in the use of insulin in 27 subjects with type 2 diabetes, treated with goat colostrum in the form <b>gastro-resistant</b> <b>tablets</b> of 300 mg (4 /die). Results. In subjects with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin, the administration of colostrum has obtained a significant reduction of insulin dosage and normalization of blood glucose levels. Conclusions. The effects of colostrum are presumably linked to increased levels of IGF- 1 that improves the utilization of glucose, stimulates glycogen and protein synthesis...|$|R
40|$|Absorption and {{distribution}} of zinc in 6 dosage forms were determined in 10 subjects by performing a pharmacokinetic study of the serum zinc profile after oral administration of a dose corresponding to 45 mg elemental zinc. The {{aim of this study}} was to document the influence on zinc bioavailability of factors such as the chemical form of zinc, the pharmaceutical form, and the division of the administered dose. The pharmacokinetic parameters indicate for gelatin capsules without excipients taken in a non divided dose better performances for zinc gluconate in comparison to zinc sulfate. Concerning the pharmaceutical form, little difference is observed between an aqueous solution and a gelatin capsule for zinc sulfate and a non divided dose; on the contrary, a commercial gelatin capsule containing zinc gluconate with various excipients show better performances than <b>gastro-resistant</b> <b>tablets</b> when zinc intake is 3 times 15 mg. Finally, the division in 3 parts of the dose of zinc sulfate given in gelatin capsules very significantly improves zinc absorption. These results demonstrate the interest of the developed pharmacokinetic method in the assessment of zinc bioavailability in different pharmaceutical dosage forms.

40|$|International audiencePosaconazole is an {{antifungal}} drug {{used in both}} prophylaxis {{and treatment}} of invasive fungal infections. Its oral formulation requires therapeutic drug monitoring. To overcome gastric acidity, a <b>gastro-resistant</b> posaconazole <b>tablet</b> has recently been developed. POSANANTES was a prospective noninterventional study that aimed to monitor plasma concentration trough level (Cmin) of posaconazole tablets used prophylactically in patients with hematological malignancies. Fifty patients were included. Group A (n = 31) included patients receiving induction chemotherapy for myeloid malignancies, and group B (n = 19) included patients treated for graft-versus-host disease after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells transplantation. In multivariate analysis, female sex, group B assignment, and evaluation of Cmin at day 8 (versus any other day planned by the analysis) were associated with a higher Cmin, while diarrhea {{was associated with a}} lower Cmin (P < 0. 05). Thirty-four percent (n = 17) of all included patients had to prematurely stop treatment, mainly in group A. In conclusion, this real-life prospective study showed good absorption of posaconazole tablets used for prophylaxis in patients with hematological malignancies, even though this strategy was somewhat limited due to the high number of patients in group A who had to stop their treatment in an untimely fashion...|$|R
40|$|The {{establishment}} of physiologically relevant in vitro-in vivo correlations (IV-IVCs) is key for any biorelevant dissolution test. Historically, bicarbonate buffers have produced better correlations than compendial phosphate buffered media, though such tests are usually performed {{at a constant}} pH experiment, overlooking {{the notion that the}} pH of the luminal fluids is variable and fluctuating. In this work, we have devised a dynamic dissolution test method employing a physiological bicarbonate buffer under pH conditions of the proximal gut in order to assess the dissolution behaviour of various enteric polymer-coated (<b>gastro-resistant)</b> prednisolone <b>tablets.</b> The pH of the media is modulated and controlled by an Auto pH System™ which exploits the physiological equilibria between [H 2 CO 3] and [HCO 3 -], to match it to the aboral change in pH with transit of the dosage form through the proximal small intestine (from pH 5. 6 up to 6. 8). The lag time values for an accelerated release and standard EUDRAGIT® L 30 D- 55 coated formulation (25 min and 60 min, respectively) were close to the previously reported initial tablet disintegration time data obtained in-vivo by γ-scintigraphy (28 min and 66 min, respectively). Dissolution of alternative delayed release coated products was also better discriminated in the dynamic buffer system. These data confirm the dynamic dissolution system provides a robust and reliable platform to predict the in vivo fate of oral products in a laboratory setting...|$|R
40|$|Summary: This work {{reports a}} {{clinical}} trial performed at palermo University Hospital "paolo Giaccone". From January 2004 to December 2011, 79 patients were enrolled (40 men and 39 women). All patients suffered from Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) and were subjected to orthopedic consultation at the institute of Orthopaedics, University Hospital of palermo, for arthropathy to IBD. The patients {{were divided into two}} groups (A and B) and dealt with different therapies for the resolution of the inflammatory picture of the colonic mucosa and the treatment of the extraintestinal articular manifestations. Group A was treated with drug therapy: Diclofenac (75 mg im/ day for 10 days 9 and Mesalazine (800 mg <b>gastro-resistant</b> tabletes, one <b>tablet</b> twice a day in mild forms, and one tablet three times per day in moderate forms). In group B, in addition to the previous treatment protocol, two probiotic mixture were added in a time of two weeks: in the first week, twice a day, one capsule containing mixture of Enterococcus faecium and saccharomices boluard was administered, with the main purpose to mitigate the intestinal inflammation; in the second week, twice a day too, one capsule containing a mixture of lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus acidophilus was administered, with the main purpose to mitigate the intestinal inflammation, in the second week, twice a day too, one capsule containing a mixture of lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus acidophilus was administered, with the aim to promote the restoration of a normal intestinal microenvironment. The attenuation of intestinal inflammation, improved by the presence of probiotics, could have important effects on the articular manifestations, resulting in a significant improvement of the arthropathy. All patients were evaluated with the Harvey-Bradshaw Index. Both Crohn Disease and Ulcerative Cholitis diagnosis was made with clinical, laboratory, endoscopic and instrumental tests; the degree of disease activity was evaluated using the criteria of Truelove and witts. The WOMAC-Score (Western Ontario Mcmaster) was used in our study to investigate the degree of articular involvement of the patients. The data were statistically evaluated and these are shown that the B group of patients treated with conventional therapy + probiotic mixture had a better resolution of the clinical and of this post-treatment parameters: WOMAC score, ESR, CRP and white blood cells; and also the B group of patients have a better response to standard therapy compared with patients who did not receive the probiotic with a remarkable statistic significance (p> 0, 0001) ...|$|R
