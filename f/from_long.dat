5|$|The routing of NY28N was {{originally}} designated, but not signed, {{as part of}} legislative Route25 in 1908. In 1924, the portion of Route25 <b>from</b> <b>Long</b> Lake to North Creek was designated {{as part of the}} signed NY10. The segment of former Route25 between Blue Mountain Lake and Long Lake became part of NY10A in the late 1920s. In the 1930 renumbering, the NY10A designation was eliminated, and NY10 was rerouted south of Long Lake to follow the modern routing of NY30 south to Speculator. The former routing of NY10 between Long Lake and North Creek was then administratively redesignated as NY28N, which continued southward <b>from</b> <b>Long</b> Lake to Blue Mountain Lake by way of an overlap with NY10.|$|E

5|$|Domestic American {{alligators}} range <b>from</b> <b>long</b> {{and slender}} to short and robust, possibly due to variations in {{factors such as}} growth rate, diet, and climate. American alligators have broad snouts, especially in captive individuals. When the jaws are closed, {{the edges of the}} upper jaws cover the lower teeth which fit into the jaws' hollows. Like the spectacled caiman, this species has a bony nasal ridge, though it is less prominent. The teeth number 74–80. Dorsally, adult American alligators may be olive, brown, gray, or black in color, while their undersides are cream-colored.|$|E

The meeting came to nothing, as Lord Howe was not authorized to grant terms the Congressional delegation insisted on. It did, however, postpone the impending British attack, allowing Washington more time to decide if and where to confront the enemy.|$|E

The Cross Bronx extension was planned to connect the bridge to several highways at the Bruckner Circle (now the Bruckner Interchange), while the Clearview was intended to connect with Horace Harding Boulevard (later the Long Island Expressway) in order to serve motorists <b>from</b> <b>Long</b> Island.|$|E

5|$|An American {{punk rock}} band <b>from</b> <b>Long</b> Island, New York named {{themselves}} after the film's alternative title, Horror Planet.

The song was not released as a record but was circulated on cassette demonstration tapes prior to the only official release by the band. In 1985, Horror Planet released a professionally produced recording on an EP record with hand-painted fabric sleeves. The songs from the Horror Planet record were subsequently re-released in their entirety on the anthology CD compilation, Something in the Water: the Secret History of Long Island Punk, by Winged Disk Records.|$|E

5|$|As Esther {{began to}} {{parallel}} the coastline, a hurricane warning was issued for coastal areas <b>from</b> <b>Long</b> Island to Provincetown, Massachusetts on September 20, and were extended to Eastport, Maine early on September 21. All hurricane watches were discontinued on September 21 as Esther {{moved away from}} the New England coast, and all hurricane warnings were downgraded to gale warnings later that day as Esther passed near Nantucket and weakened to a tropical storm, and all warnings were discontinued on September 22 after the storm {{moved away from the}} coast. After Esther completed its anticyclonic loop over the northwestern Atlantic, a gale warning was again issued from Provincetown, Massachusetts to Eastport, Maine on September 25, and was discontinued the next day after Esther made its second landfall in Maine. Personnel on two offshore surveillance stations called the Texas Towers were evacuated; a third tower had collapsed during a storm in January 1961, prompting higher safety standards.|$|E
5|$|Aside from control interfaces, {{the bridge}} set was {{populated}} with monitors looping animations. Each oval monitor was a rear-projection screen on which super 8mm and 16mm film sequences looped for each special effect. The production acquired 42 films {{for this purpose}} from an Arlington, Virginia-based company, Stowmar Enterprises. Stowmar's footage was exhausted {{only a few weeks}} into filming, and it became clear that new monitor films would be needed faster than an outside supplier could deliver them. Cole, Minor, and another production designer, Rick Sternbach, worked together with Povill to devise faster ways of shooting new footage. Cole and Povill rented an oscilloscope for a day and filmed its distortions. Other loops came <b>from</b> <b>Long</b> Beach Hospital, the University of California at San Diego, and experimental computer labs in New Mexico. In all, over two hundred pieces of monitor footage were created and catalogued into a seven-page listing.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere in Canada, the Smoking Man (William B. Davis) {{is found}} by Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea). At FBI Headquarters, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) reveals to Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) that Jeffrey Spender (Chris Owens) {{is leading the}} case {{investigating}} the shooting. Despite Spender's request that Mulder not be involved, he bursts into the meeting and offers the explanation that the assassin was firing at Gibson, not the Russian. In the meeting is Diana Fowley (Mimi Rogers), an acquaintance from Mulder's past. The Smoking Man is reunited with the Syndicate members, including the First Elder and the Well-Manicured Man, who want him {{to help them with}} the situation concerning Gibson. Fowley accompanies Mulder and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) as they go visit Gibson in Gaithersburg, Maryland. Mulder believes that Gibson can read minds, hence his expertise at chess.
