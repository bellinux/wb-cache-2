5000|$|Barring contacts, a good lens {{designer}} doesn’t {{have many}} parameters {{which can be}} traded off to improve vision. Index has little effect on <b>error.</b> <b>Note</b> that, although chromatic aberration is often perceived as [...] "blurry vision" [...] in the lens periphery and gives the impression of power error, this is actually due to color shifting. Chromatic aberration can be improved by using a material with improved ABBE. The best way to combat lens induced power error is to limit the choice of corrective lens to one {{that is in the}} best spherical form. A lens designer determines the best-form spherical curve using the Oswalt curve on the Tscherning ellipse. This design gives the best achievable optical quality and least sensitivity to lens fitting. A flatter base-curve is sometimes selected for cosmetic reasons. Aspheric or atoric design can reduce errors induced by using a suboptimal flatter base-curve. They cannot surpass the optical quality of a spherical best-form lens, but can reduce the error induced by using a flatter than optimal base curve. The improvement due to flattening is most evident for strong farsighted lenses. High myopes (-6D) may see a slight cosmetic benefit with larger lenses. Mild prescriptions will have no perceptible benefit (-2D). Even at high prescriptions some high myope prescriptions with small lenses may not see any difference, since some aspheric lenses have a spherically designed center area for improved vision and fit.|$|E

The system uses a pitch profile encoding for queries in any key and an n-note indexing method for approximate matching in sub-linear time. A distinct function that extracts key melodies for query suggestion is developed. The Web-based system provides flexible user interface for query formulation and result browsing. Users can search {{the system by}} a short sequence of notes, by uploading a file created by singing, or by clicking suggested key melodies without input. Experiments show that the pitch profile encoding and a 3 -note indexing are able to overcome the key mismatch problem and the random errors caused by pitch <b>error,</b> <b>note</b> deletion and insertion. The use of extracted key melodies improves performance over direct search of the music database. For the type of burst mismatch, a query expansion approach is applied...|$|E

40|$|In this work, {{we propose}} "Residual Attention Network", a {{convolutional}} neural network using attention mechanism which can incorporate with state-of-art feed forward network architecture in an end-to-end training fashion. Our Residual Attention Network is built by stacking Attention Modules which generate attention-aware features. The attention-aware features from different modules change adaptively as layers going deeper. Inside each Attention Module, bottom-up top-down feedforward structure is used to unfold the feedforward and feedback attention process into a single feedforward process. Importantly, we propose attention residual learning to train very deep Residual Attention Networks which can be easily scaled up to hundreds of layers. Extensive analyses are conducted on CIFAR- 10 and CIFAR- 100 datasets to verify the effectiveness of every module mentioned above. Our Residual Attention Network achieves state-of-the-art object recognition performance on three benchmark datasets including CIFAR- 10 (3. 90 % error), CIFAR- 100 (20. 45 % error) and ImageNet (4. 8 % single model and single crop, top- 5 <b>error).</b> <b>Note</b> that, our method achieves 0. 6 % top- 1 accuracy improvement with 46 % trunk depth and 69 % forward FLOPs comparing to ResNet- 200.

Here we have dictated {{that it should be}} the long-shafted hook of the A. minus that is the model, the decision made as a basis of the results of part 2 of the study when we discovered that the evolutionary sparkle had gone into the development of a cellulose hook that was fibrous and therefore non-homogenous. Therefore, it can be predicted from shape efficiency constraints that all of the hook will not be used to absorb stress in copper where it is homogenous in structure as laid down by the layered manufacturing device. So it is true {{that there will be some}} use in FEA but only if specified correctly for forces and anchorage points and surfaces that are accurate. It will be the same for both of the new acts called the <b>error</b> <b>note</b> of the state, namely the way in which it uses a lot of its energy to absorb sound and noise to stop it from being a friction-destroyed device and rather reusable without destructive tendencies.
