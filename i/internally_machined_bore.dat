40|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{clarifying}} the tool wear of spur machine-bits (alloy steel, high-speed steel, and cemented carbide) in the <b>machine</b> <b>boring</b> of western redcedar (Thuja plicata Donn), tool-life tests were performed. After boring 1000 number of holes, the amount of tool wear was measured and the worn surface of spur edge of the bit was observed with a scanning electron microscope. From the results, the difference between in the <b>machine</b> <b>boring</b> of air-dried western redcedar {{and that in the}} <b>machine</b> <b>boring</b> of green one was determined. Potential difference was occurred between the bit and workpiece when green wood was bored in every tool material, the tool-wear progressions of high-speed steel bit and cemented carbide bit in the <b>machine</b> <b>boring</b> of green wood were faster than those in the <b>machine</b> <b>boring</b> of air-dried one. These results were completely contrary to the result of alloy steel bit. From the scanning electron microscope observation of each machine bit, it was observed that worn surface of the bit was corroded remarkably by chemical or electrochemical corrosive action...|$|R

50|$|Work on the Manhattan side {{includes}} {{building a}} new 8-track train station deep underground and connecting it to the 63rd Street Tunnel's lower level. The new station will be housed in two gigantic caverns blasted out of the Manhattan schist rock formation under the station. A three level structure is being built in each cavern, with a train platform and two tracks each {{on the top and}} bottom levels and a passenger concourse in the middle. The middle levels in the two caverns will be connected by passageways and the west cavern, in turn, will be connected by banks of escalators and elevators to a new concourse being constructed on the lower level of Grand Central Terminal. That concourse will replace ten tracks {{on the west side of}} GCT's Madison Yard. The track connections from the new station to the 63rd Street tunnel were excavated using tunnel <b>boring</b> <b>machines.</b> Dragados/Judlau created a launch chamber for the tunnel <b>boring</b> <b>machines</b> under Second Avenue at 63rd Street in Manhattan using a controlled drill-and-blast method, then assembled and launched each 640-ton machine. The first tunnel <b>boring</b> <b>machine</b> was launched west and southbound from the 63rd Street tunnel in September 2007 and reached Grand Central Terminal in July 2008. The second <b>machine</b> began <b>boring</b> a parallel tunnel in December 2007 and had completed its tunnel at 37th Street on September 30, 2008. Geocomp Corporation was hired to monitor the boring, using a battery of instruments to record vibration, ground settlement and any tilting or drift suffered by the tunnel <b>boring</b> <b>machines.</b> The instruments include inclinometers, extensometers, seismographs, observation wells, dynamic strain gauges, tilt meters and automated motorized total stations with prismatic targets. The next step in construction was to back the tunnel <b>boring</b> <b>machines</b> out of the tunnels and make cast-in-place concrete sections to create the tunnel lining. Each tunnel is 22 ft in diameter and carry trains 140 ft beneath street level. The tunnel <b>boring</b> <b>machines</b> <b>bored</b> an average of 50 ft per day. Cross-connections between the tunnels were created under Park Avenue, between 49th and 51st Streets, by controlled drill-and-blast; the work began in mid-July 2008 and was required between six and eight months to complete.|$|R
