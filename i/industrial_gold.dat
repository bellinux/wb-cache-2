50|$|Since the {{government}} fees and taxes were extremely high, only the 19 wealthiest prospectors {{were able to}} make claims and then employ the rest of the prospectors. The largest claims had 30-40 men, who worked for 11 hours per day, six days a week. The major claims produced some 10 kilograms of gold yearly, but the rush was over soon, as the gold started running out. In 1873, {{the government}} fees were cut in half and a year later a special law for the gold prospecting on the Tana River was passed. The Ivalo River area was almost abandoned in the early 1880s, and the few prospectors that were left moved to Sotajoki and to the Laanila village, located 10 kilometers east. In 1883-1884, the Kultala Crown Station was used by the professor Selim Lemström for exploring the northern lights, until it was closed in 1900.

Canadian mining investment in Mali in 2009 was estimated by the Canadian government at Cdn.$500m. and grew from four Canadian-owned mining properties in Mali in 1991 to 73 in 2005. From 1996 to 2007, approximately US$267m., or 3% of Mali's total revenue from <b>industrial</b> <b>gold</b> production, went to the Canadian company IAMGOLD Corporation and its investors, including both of Canada's public pension funds. The two mines part-owned by IAMGOLD yielded half of Mali's gold output over this period. According to IAMGOLD's South African co-partner in these mines, AngloGold Ashanti, 40% of earnings went into the Malian economy through various government revenues, workers' salaries, Malian sub-contractors and local community development initiatives. As Mali's gold mines were estimated to contribute 8% {{of the gross domestic product}} in 2007, IAMGOLD's mines comprised about 3-4% of Mali's economy. Sixty percent of these mines' revenue went to foreign stakeholders, including IAMGOLD, AngloGold Ashanti and its sub-contractors, the World Bank's International Finance Corporation, and European creditors.|$|E
5000|$|In 2008, Freeston {{reported}} from El Salvador on Canadian mining company Pacific Rim's attempt {{to open an}} <b>industrial</b> <b>gold</b> mine in the Central American country. He documented how the company hired 'promoters' in communities opposed to mining, a move that led to violence in a phenomenon the Salvadoran social movement began to call [...] "social contamination". His video reports for The Real News document the popular resistance to mining and the $100 million lawsuit Pacific Rim launched against the government of El Salvador itself for alleged losses when, after months of exploration, it was denied a mining permit. In a November 15, 2009 story for The Real News, Freeston interviewed Tom Shrake, the CEO and President of Pacific Rim about the lawsuit. Shrake claimed Pacific Rim followed El Salvador's mining, investment, and environmental laws and was therefore denied a mining permit illegally. Freeston's investigation from San Isidro revealed contamination of the country's little-accessible water during the exploration stage, the inflammation of conflict by company promoters, {{the perception that the}} 2% tax Pacific Rim would pay on its revenues, and other social and environmental concerns were behind the resistance to the proposed mining project. He also reported on cases of murder and torture of anti-mining activists, such as that of Gustavo Marcelo Rivera. The Rivera family maintains that Rivera was killed for his opposition to the mining project and the local leadership that supports it.|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{examined how}} inequality manifests itself through {{the processes of}} <b>industrial</b> <b>gold</b> mining using {{a case study of}} Newmont Mining Corporations’ Ahafo Gold Mine in Ghana. The pursuit of neoliberal development and widespread transnational capitalism has led to highly globalised patterns of production and consumption, and gold is representative of a single commodity whose production acts as a proximate mechanism through which globalisation could be linked to the growth of inequality. There are growing perceptions of inequality between stakeholders within the <b>industrial</b> <b>gold</b> mining industry. The research focused on what may be deemed a number of social and environmental injustices experienced by groups of individuals who do not value gold as it is valued in the contemporary industrialised world. The findings question the underlying motivations and assumptions that justify the implementation of <b>industrial</b> <b>gold</b> mining projects for the benefit of local communities, when in fact, it should be acknowledged that the benefits are not always equitably distributed and can produce highly stratified societies. The main grievances expressed by local communities affected by the operations of Newmont Mining Corporation in Ghana are documented and attempts are made to understand the perspectives of different stakeholders in framing social and environmental issues. The empirical observations help to identify where perceptions of inequality emerge and to uncover the processes through which inequality may be constructed or perpetuated within systems of embedded power relations. Various changes occur in stakeholders’ expectations and aspirations during the processes of <b>industrial</b> <b>gold</b> mining related to the transfer of power and sovereignty. Newmont’s CSR programmes may be understood as efforts to manage inequalities. However, in many ways, the company has failed to prevent the emergence of the same environmental and social injustices associated with industrial mining around the world, despite the company’s claims to be implementing ‘best practice’. Therefore, the research suggests that socially responsible mining {{may not be enough to}} prevent the production of inequality...|$|E

40|$|The Mukodek gold {{field is}} {{discussed}} {{as an example}} proving that dynamometamorphism {{is a major factor}} in the formation of gold deposits in the Abchad fault zone. This deposit belongs to the gold‐silver‐ore zones of mylonitization and schistosity. The ore source is related to the original host rocks with an increased geochemical background concentration of Au. Due to dynamometamorphism processes, gold particles are abundant and mostly enlarged. From the primary rocks, the dynamometamorphites inherit a positive correlation between the number of particles and the concentrations of gold. The dynamometamorphic complex of the ore field developed in two stages, as a minimum. At the early stage (321. 0 ± 1. 9 Ma), the host rocks were mechanochemically deformed and transformed into the gold‐ bearing mineralized dynamometamorphites containing sericite, chlorite, ankerite, albite, and quartz. In the second stage (280 ± 15 Ma), the albite‐dolomite‐quartz ore veins were formed. Such veins have <b>industrial</b> <b>gold</b> contents...|$|E
