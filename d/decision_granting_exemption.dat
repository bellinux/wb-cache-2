5000|$|The NRC's <b>granted</b> an <b>exemption</b> to {{the defense}} in depth {{regulations}} to the Indian Point nuclear plant. The defense in depth rule required electric power cables, which control reactor shutdown in an emergency, to have fire insulation that lasts one hour. The NRC granted Indian Point an exemption to use insulation that lasts 24 minutes. The decision was challenged in Federal District Court with the judge deciding [...] "the NRC's <b>decision</b> to <b>grant</b> the <b>exemption</b> was neither arbitrary nor capricious" [...] {{and concluded that the}} agency had performed a comprehensive safety review before issuing the exemption order. However, on appeal, the Federal Circuit Court, determined that the NRC must hold public hearing on any exemption {{to the defense}} in depth rule.|$|R
50|$|Due to its one country, {{two systems}} stance, the Government of Hong Kong {{can make a}} visa-waiver {{agreement}} for Chinese residents of Hong Kong with other countries bypassing the Central People's Government. As a result of both bilateral visa abolition agreements (e.g. between Hong Kong and Russia) and unilateral <b>decisions</b> to <b>grant</b> visa <b>exemptions</b> (e.g. by Nicaragua), Hong Kong Special Administrative Region passport holders enjoy visa exemptions and simplified visa procedures to {{a large number of}} destinations worldwide. Whilst the visa exemptions mostly only apply when Chinese citizens of Hong Kong are visiting on short trips for pleasure or on business, a number of countries extend the visa exemption to short stays involving paid activities (e.g. Belgium and Luxembourg). , the passports of Hong Kong (SAR), South Korea, Israel, and Chile are the only ones to provide visa-free access to all of the European continent.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} how the Securities and Exchange Commission balances competing regulatory objectives in its decisions to approve requests to withhold proprietary information from firms' financial reports. The confidential treatment process requires the SEC {{to balance the}} public interest in protecting proprietary information with the public interest in promoting disclosures to investors. I draw upon {{the economic and political}} science literatures on regulatory decision-making to test the strength of these interests on three aspects of the SEC's <b>decisions</b> to <b>grant</b> confidential treatment: the duration of time required to approve the request, the duration of time the SEC agrees to protect proprietary information from disclosure, and whether the firm is successful in securing confidential treatment for all redacted information. I find that the public interest in promoting disclosure and protecting proprietary information influence different aspects of the SEC's <b>decisions</b> to <b>grant</b> regulatory <b>exemptions</b> for confidential treatment. Firms requiring greater monitoring by the SEC receive greater scrutiny and have lower odds of successful redaction. High proprietary costs are associated with significantly longer protection periods but proprietary costs generally are not associated with duration to approval or the success of the application. Finally, I find that the SEC applies greater scrutiny to firms exhibiting objective and salient measures of low financial reporting quality although these firms have higher odds of success. These findings are consistent with the SEC reviewing CTRs {{to reduce the risk of}} legislative oversight. This study contributes to the literature on disclosure regulation by providing evidence as to how securities regulators balance competing interests when reviewing requests for disclosure exemptions. These findings also contribute to the role of political influence on disclosure policy, as the SEC's exemption decisions are consistent with avoiding the threat of legislative oversight. Second, these findings contribute to the literature on the SEC's regulatory decisions by demonstrating that the SEC staff appears to allocate resources and apply scrutiny to applications for disclosure exemptions using aspects of registered firms' financial reporting quality. Third, these findings contribute to the literature on redaction as a disclosure choice by providing evidence suggesting that firms with low financial reporting quality are more likely to redact, and I provide evidence on the success of this disclosure choice. Overall, these findings suggest that the public interest in promoting disclosure, as well as the threat of legislative oversight, influence the SECs <b>decisions</b> when <b>granting</b> regulatory <b>exemptions</b> to protect proprietary information...|$|R
