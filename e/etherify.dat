Quingestrone (Enol-Luteovis) is a progesterone ether (specifically, the 3-cyclopentyl ether of progesterone) that has been marketed in Italy as an oral contraceptive. Quingestrone is a variant of progesterone with improved pharmacokinetics, including higher potency, oral activity, greater lipophilicity, and a longer half-life.

40|$|The Energy Policy Act {{requires}} the Secretary of Energy {{to determine the}} feasibility of producing sufficient replacement fuels to replace at least 30 percent of the projected consumption of motor fuels by light duty vehicles in the year 2010. The Act also {{requires the}} Secretary to determine the greenhouse gas implications {{of the use of}} replacement fuels. A replacement fuel is a non-petroleum portion of gasoline, including certain alcohols, ethers, and other components. The Oak Ridge National Laboratory Refinery Yield Model has been used to study the cost and refinery impacts for production of {open_quotes}low petroleum{close_quotes} gasolines, which contain replacement fuels. The analysis suggests that high oxygenation is the key to meeting the replacement fuel target, and a major contributor to cost increase is investment in processes to produce and <b>etherify</b> light olefins. High oxygenation can also increase the costs of control of vapor pressure, distillation properties, and pollutant emissions of gasolines. Year-round low petroleum gasoline with near- 30 percent non-petroleum components might be produced with cost increases of 23 to 37 cents per gallon of gasoline, and with greenhouse gas emissions changes between a 3 percent increase and a 16 percent decrease. Crude oil reduction, with decreased dependence on foreign sources, is a major objective of the low petroleum gasoline program. For year-round gasoline with near- 30 percent non-petroleum components, crude oil use is reduced by 10 to 12 percent, at a cost $ 48 to $ 89 per barrel. Depending upon resolution of uncertainties about extrapolation of the Environmental Protection Agency Complex Model for pollutant emissions, availability of raw materials and other issues, costs could be lower or higher...|$|E

The degree of substitution (DS) value reaches up to 0. 40 by adjusting the mass ratios (NaOH/hemicellulose, total <b>etherifying</b> agents/hemicellulose and 2, 3 -epoxypropyltrimethylammonium chloride/acrylamide), the reaction temperature and the reaction time in a one-step synthesis.

40|$|A novel {{approach}} for the quantification {{of the degree}} of condensation at the C₅ position of <b>etherified</b> and phenolic phenylpropane (C- 9) units of in situ lignin is described.

Analysis of milled wood lignin (MWL) isolated from the same wood by ³¹P NMR spectroscopy before and after thioacidolysis showed that the phenolic guaiacyl C- 9 units were more condensed than those in the in situ lignin.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{effectiveness}} of the analysis of cell wall-bound hydroxycinnamic acids and the composition of lignin to evaluate the in vivo digestibility of a silage collection with unknown botanical composition was evaluated. RESULTS: Syringyl units content and total <b>etherified</b> phenols showed the highest correlation coefficients with in vivo dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) (r = − 0. 792 and r = − 0. 703, respectively), while guaiacyl units and total phenols showed the highest correlation coefficients with in vivo organic matter digestibility (IVOMD) (r = − 0. 871 and r = − 0. 817, respectively). Using the above-mentioned chemical parameters, 10 equations were also developed to predict in vivo digestibility. The prediction of IVDMD produced a high adjusted R 2 value (0. 710) using syringyl, total lignin, <b>etherified</b> total phenols, esterified ferulic acid and total phenol content as predictors. The prediction of IVOMD produced a higher adjusted R 2 value (0. 821) using guaiacyl, total phenols, total ferulic acid and <b>etherified</b> p-coumaric acid content as predictors. CONCLUSION: Cell wall digestibility depends on a multiplicity of factors {{and it is not}} possible to attribute a causal effect on in vivo digestibility to any single factor. However, syringyl and guaiacyl content and <b>etherified</b> phenols emerge as good predictors of digestibility.

Nine pastes (seven <b>etherified</b> cellulose (methyl cellulose) and the native cellulose (control) were prepared by dispersing them in distilled water (35 % w/v) and heating the eight dispersions to 45 °C with continuous agitation for 15 min. The solutions were then cooled to room temperature and allowed to gel. The effect of DS on the adhesive properties of the pastes (tack strength, rolling ball test, gelation time, drying time, optical clarity, relative viscosity, syneresis) was comparatively investigated.

Thus, the objective {{of this study is to}} synthesize a new novel flocculant based on hemicellulose derived from OPT for cationic dye removal application. Two different flocculants were synthesized in this study: (a) hemicellulose <b>etherified</b> with chloroacetic acid (HcECA) and (b) hemicellulose <b>etherified</b> with acrylamide (HcEAM). Both hemicellulose derivatives were prepared with various etherification mole ratios. The native hemicellulose and its derivatives were characterized using gel permeation chromatography, Fourier transform infrared and proton nuclear magnetic resonance. The coagulation/flocculation performance of the hemicellulose derivatives were evaluated with cationic dye (i. e. methylene blue, MB) at different initial pH values, hemicellulose derivative dosages and initial dye concentrations. The characterization results confirmed a successful synthesis of the respective hemicellulose derivatives with the improvement on the solubility of both derivatives. The coagulation/flocculation results indicated that HcECA 15 has better ability to remove the cationic dyes compared to HcECA 10 and HcECA 5 whereas, HcEAM 1 was better than HcEAM 0. 1, HcEAM 0. 5, HcEAM 10 and HcEAM 15. Changing the initial pH of the dye solution from acidic to alkaline resulted in the increase of dye removal percentage. In addition, higher dosages of hemicellulose derivatives also increased dye removal. On the contrary, high initial dye concentrations reduced the percentage of dye removal. HcEAM showed better efficiency on the cationic dye removal than HcECA due to its ability to produce denser flocs which are usually helpful during sedimentation. As a conclusion, both hemicellulose derivatives have their own novelty to be new flocculants for successful application in cationic dye removal processes. Yet, both flocculants had not fully decolourized the MB and still not highly likely to be applied in real industrial applications for textile wastewater treatment. Thus, the process, ratio of the etherification and mechanism of MB removal should be investigated further to enhance the dye removal performanc...|$|R
40|$|The {{top three}} senescent internodes of six genotypes of pearl millet (ICMV 155 Nor 155, ICMV 155 bmr, ICMV 221, ICMH 356, ICMH 94410, NCD 2) and sorghum (CSV 15, CSH 9, local yellow, ICSV 93046, ICSV 89057, ICSV 112) {{were used to}} asses the {{relationship}} between cell walls and wall components and in vitro gas production. Walls, (nitrogen) N, total soluble sugar contents and gas production in stems of both sorghum and pearl millet were significantly different between genotypes. In pearl millet stems, lignin and esterified p-coumaric acid (pCA) were significantly different between genotypes. In sorghum, N, lignin and phenolic acids—except esterified pCA were significantly different between genotypes. Except at 12 h for sorghum, gas production of walls was significantly different between genotypes and ranked genotypes differently than gas of stems. Soluble sugars in the stems of both pearl millet and sorghum were positively correlated to gas production at 12, 24, and 36 h, and vice versa for cell walls. In pearl millet, phenolic acids were not significantly correlated with either gas production of whole stems or that of walls, {{with the exception of}} <b>etherified</b> pCA of walls. On the other hand, in sorghum, <b>etherified</b> pCA of stems and walls were negatively correlated with gas at 72 and 96 h. The significant differences of gas production between genotypes, different ranking of genotypes with the progression of the fermentation, and the gas production differences between whole stems and walls indicate the differential effect of soluble sugars and of cell wall type on the digestibility of whole stems. This study points out the need to look in greater details at the relationship and the interactions between the effects of soluble and structural carbohydrates in stovers and the genetic base that determines it. Such studies could identify the most adequate combination of traits useful in crop improvement programs taking into account feed value of stover of dual-purpose crops. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTwo {{types of}} cationized nanofibrillated {{cellulose}} (NFC) were prepared by redox initiated graft copolymerization and etherification with quaternary ammonium compounds (QAC). The QAC content and charge {{density of the}} products were measured. The NFC derivatives were tested for antimicrobial activity against Gram positive and negative bacteria, and yeast. Both NFC types exhibited broad spectrum antimicrobial activity. Etherification resulted in {{a higher degree of}} substitution and charge density, and the product also showed higher antimicrobial activity than the copolymerization product. <b>Etherified</b> NFC was more efficient against Gram negative than positive bacteria, whereas the polymer grafted NFC was equally active against both. This was attributed to the ability of the polymeric grafts to penetrate the thick cell wall of Gram positive bacteria, followed by the destabilization of the cellular membrane. Neither cationized NFC type showed cytotoxicity against human cells, providing means to manufacture safe, insoluble, and permanently antimicrobial materials via aqueous synthesis...|$|R
