50|$|Channichthyids' most {{well known}} feature is {{their lack of}} erythrocytes. Genetic {{evidence}} shows that crocodile <b>icefish</b> had erythrocytes but have back evolved to not use hemoglobin, or any protein binding for oxygen transport. Instead, white-blooded fish have improved heart output, higher blood volume, higher uptake of oxygen and lower metabolic rates. The discovery that <b>icefish</b> species Neopagetopsis ionah possesses a nearly intact, but useless set of globin genes demonstrates that multiple events led {{to the loss of}} hemoglobin expression in <b>icefish.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{crocodile}} <b>icefish</b> or white-blooded fish (Channichthyidae) {{comprise a}} family of notothenioid fish found in the Southern Ocean around Antarctica and southern South America, where water temperatures remain relatively stable (generally ranging from -1.8 to +2.0 Â°C).

50|$|The loss of {{hemoglobin}} {{was initially}} {{believed to be}} an adaptation to the extreme cold as the lack of hemoglobin and red blood cells decreases blood viscosity, which is an adaptation that has been seen in species adapted to cold climates. However, current analysis {{has shown that the}} lack of hemoglobin, while not lethal, is not adaptive. Any adaptive advantages incurred by reduced blood viscosity are outweighed by the fact that <b>icefishes</b> must pump much more blood per unit of time so as {{to make up for the}} reduced oxygen-carrying capacity of their blood. The high blood volume of <b>icefishes</b> is itself evidence that the loss of hemoglobin and myoglobin was not advantageous for the ancestor of the <b>icefishes.</b> Their unusual cardiovascular physiology, including large heart, high blood volume, increased mitochondrial density, and extensive microvasculature, suggests that <b>icefishes</b> have had to evolve ways of coping with damages to their impaired oxygen-binding and transport systems.|$|E

50|$|Antarctic fish is {{a common}} name {{for a variety of}} fish that inhabit the Southern Ocean. They {{originate}} from the five different families that belong to the suborder Notothenioidei of the order Perciformes. They are from families Artedidraconidae (barbeled plunderfishes), Bathydraconidae (Antarctic dragonfishes), Channichthyidae (crocodile <b>icefishes</b> or white-blooded fishes), Harpagiferidae (spiny plunderfish), and Nototheniidae (cod <b>icefishes).</b> They are also called notothenioids, but this name is also used to describe the other three, non-Antarctic families and some of the non-Antarctic genera in the mainly Antarctic families belonging to the suborder.|$|E
50|$|The key {{to solving}} this {{conundrum}} {{is to consider}} the other function that both hemoglobin and myoglobin perform. While emphasis is often placed and understandably so {{on the importance of}} hemoglobin and myoglobin in oxygen delivery and use, recent studies have found that both proteins are actually also involved in the process of breaking down nitric oxide. This means that when <b>icefishes</b> lost hemoglobin and myoglobin it did not just mean a decreased ability to transport oxygen, but it also meant that total nitric oxide levels went up in individuals. Nitric oxide plays a role in regulating various cardiovascular processes in <b>icefishes</b> such as the dilation of branchial vasculature, cardiac stroke volume, and power output. The presence of nitric oxide also can increase angiogenesis, mitochondrial biogenesis, and cause muscle hypertrophy - all traits that are characteristic of <b>icefishes.</b> The similarity between nitric oxide-mediated trait expression and the unusual cardiovascular traits of <b>icefishes</b> suggests that while these abnormal traits have evolved over time, much of these traits were simply an immediate physiological response to heightened levels of nitric oxide, which may in turn have led to a process of homeostatic evolution. In addition, the heightened levels of nitric oxide that followed as an inevitable consequence of the loss of hemoglobin and myoglobin may have actually provided an automatic compensation, allowing for the fish {{to make up for the}} hit to their oxygen transport system, thereby providing a grace period of the fixation of these less than desirable traits.|$|E
50|$|As {{discussed}} previously, phylogenetic relationships {{indicate that}} the expression of myoglobin in cardiac tissue has occurred at least four discrete times. This repeated loss suggests that cardiac myoglobin might be vestigial or even detrimental to <b>icefishes.</b> Sidell and O'Brien (2006) investigated this possibility. First, they performed a test using stopped-flow spectrometry. They found that across all temperatures, oxygen binds and dissociates faster from icefish than it does from mammalian myoglobin. However, when they repeated the test with each organism at a temperature that accurately reflected its native environment, the myoglobin performance was roughly equivalent between <b>icefishes</b> and mammals. So, they concluded that icefish myoglobin is neither more nor less functional than the myoglobin in other clades. This means that {{it is unlikely that}} myoglobin would be selected against. These same researchers then performed a test in which they selectively inhibited cardiac myoglobin in <b>icefishes</b> with natural myoglobin expression. They found that icefish species that naturally lack cardiac myoglobin performed better without myoglobin than did fish that naturally express cardiac myoglobin. This finding suggests that fish without cardiac myoglobin have undergone compensatory adaptation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Icefish</b> {{blood is}} colorless because it lacks hemoglobin, the oxygen-binding protein in blood. Channichthyidae {{are the only}} known {{vertebrates}} to lack hemoglobin as adults. Although they do not manufacture hemoglobin, remnants of hemoglobin genes {{can be found in}} their genome. The hemoglobin protein is made of two subunits (alpha and beta). In 15 of the 16 <b>icefish</b> species, the beta subunit gene has been completely deleted and the alpha subunit gene has been partially deleted. In only one of the <b>icefish</b> species, Neopagetopsis ionah, there is a more complete, but still nonfunctional hemoglobin gene.|$|R
50|$|Instead <b>Icefish</b> {{carried out}} another very useful {{function}} of our submarines. On 7 June with a PBY Catalina for air cover, she rescued six Army aviators {{off the coast}} of Formosa. <b>Icefish</b> arrived Fremantle 4 July for refit and sailed 29 July for her fifth war patrol. En route to station 7 August a small diesel lugger of 15 tons was intercepted. The crew consisted of two Japanese, two Eurasians, and five Chinese. One Japanese jumped overboard rather than be captured; the rest were taken on board <b>Icefish.</b> The lugger was sunk by gunfire.|$|R
40|$|The {{mackerel}} <b>icefish</b> Champsocephalus gunnari LÃ¶nnberg is {{an important}} component of the ecosystem at South Georgia. Its diet is dominated by Antarctic krill Euphausia superba; in turn, it is also an important prey of a number of upper trophic level predators, as well as being the target of commercial fisheries. Data on the frequency and size structure of mackerel <b>icefish</b> in the diet of Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella and gentoo penguins Pygoscelis papua from 1991 to 2002 were used to examine trophic interactions involving this species and to evaluate the potential impact of predators on its population. Mackerel <b>icefish</b> occurred in 10 to 20 % of scats from Antarctic fur seals and comprised 48 % of the diet by mass of gentoo penguins. The contribution of mackerel <b>icefish</b> to the diet of predators was in inverse proportion to the contribution of Antarctic krill. The length-frequency distributions of mackerel <b>icefish</b> indicated a dominant mode at 130 to 180 mm total length (the 1 + age class), with apparent strong cohorts entering the population in 1993, 1996, 1999 and 2001. Extrapolation of diet data to produce a consumption estimate for the South Georgia population of Antarctic fur seals and gentoo penguins suggests that scientific trawl surveys may underestimate the standing stock of mackerel <b>icefish</b> by 1 order of magnitude. Changes in the South Georgia ecosystem over the past 2 decades may have increased the level of consumption of mackerel <b>icefish</b> by predators, providing a potential ecosystem-based explanation for the lack of a recovery to the pre-exploitation population size...|$|R
