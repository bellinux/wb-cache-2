40|$|BACKGROUND: Reducing {{treatment}} delay improves {{outcomes in}} breast cancer. The {{aim of this}} study was to determine factors influencing patient- and system-related delays in commencing breast cancer treatment in different countries. METHODS: A total of 6588 female breast cancer patients from 12 countries were surveyed. Total <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> was determined as the sum of the patient-related <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> (time between onset of the first symptoms and the first medical visit) and system-related <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> (time between the first medical visit and the start of therapy). RESULTS: The average patient-related <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> and total <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> were 4. 7 (range: 3. 4 - 6. 2) weeks and 14. 4 (range: 11. 5 - 29. 4) weeks, respectively. Longer patient-related <b>delay</b> <b>times</b> were associated with distrust and disregard, and shorter patient-related <b>delay</b> <b>times</b> were associated with fear of breast cancer, practicing self-examination, higher education level, being employed, having support from friends and family and living in big cities. The average system-related <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> was 11. 1 (range: 8. 3 - 24. 7) weeks. Cancer diagnosis made by an oncologist versus another physician, higher education level, older age, family history of female cancers and having a breast lump as the first cancer sign were associated with shorter system-related <b>delay</b> <b>times.</b> Longer patient-related <b>delay</b> <b>times</b> and higher levels of distrust and disregard were predictors of longer system-related <b>delay</b> <b>times.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The <b>delay</b> in diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer remains a serious problem. Several psychological and behavioural patient attributes strongly determine both patient-related <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> and system-related <b>delay</b> <b>time,</b> but their strength is different in particular countries...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} <b>time</b> <b>delay</b> {{effects on the}} {{stability}} and performance of active feedback control systems for engineering structures. A computer algorithm is developed for stability analysis of a SDOF system with unequal <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> pair in the velocity and displacement feedback loops.

50|$|Kalkitoxin exerts this {{cytotoxic}} effect through inhibition of the mitochondrial electron transport chain complex 1. This causes the inhibition of hypoxia-induced HIF-1 activation, which {{is crucial in}} solid tumor cancers because hypoxia drives tumor angiogenesis, leading to worsening disease stages and increased resistance to treatment. HIF-1 is a transcription factor which induces expression of genes promoting oxygen availability and decreasing oxygen consumption, the effect of which counteracts cellular hypoxia. Therefore, kalkitoxin's HIF-1 inhibitory ability positions it as a potentially promising molecule to counteract the progression of some solid tumor cancers by blocking the tumor proliferative response to hypoxia. The caveat to kalkitoxin's promising anti-proliferative properties is its neurotoxic effects. At concentrations comparable to those required for tumor-selective cytotoxicity, kalkitoxin induces cell death when applied to rat cerebellar granule neurons (CGN) in culture. Kalkitoxin acts as an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor agonist, and induces cytotoxicity in cultured rat CGNs at <b>delayed</b> <b>time</b> points.

40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the dynamics of}} <b>delayed</b> <b>time</b> and real time computer-mediated communication (CMC) when small groups use text-based computer communication programs to reach closure on a priority setting problem task. This study was a preliminary investigation into the effects of computer-mediated communication mode on several measures: decision quality, gain-loss scores and utilization resources, time to solution, text sequencing, and text readability. The problem related to identifying mode of transmission (<b>delayed</b> <b>time</b> and real time) as a variable that can directly impact computer-mediated discourse. Prior studies involving CMC and group decision making were performed using either <b>delayed</b> <b>time</b> or real time computer-mediated communication mode (Kiesler, Siegel, 2 ̆ 6 McGuire, 1984; Sproull and Kiesler, 1986). This study investigated group communication under both modes. Thirty two (N= 32) three-person member groups completed a priority setting problem online in a unix* environment that supports computer-mediated communication in delayed and real time modes. Ninety six participants {{were randomly assigned to}} one of two computer- mediated communication modes (<b>delayed</b> <b>time</b> or real time). All participants completed the task from their home locations, communicating via modem connection to Nova University 2 ̆ 7 s VAX 8550 mini-computer running DEC 2 ̆ 7 s version of Unix, 2 ̆ 2 Ultrix 2 ̆ 2 Version 2. 3. Participants were physically, and potentially geographically and time-zone dispersed from others with whom they participated with in the experiment. There was no face-to-face interaction among group members. Transcripts of electronic mail (<b>delayed</b> <b>time)</b> activities and recordings of 2 ̆ 2 Phone 2 ̆ 2 (real time) computer conversation program activities were made during the experiment and later analyzed. It was hypothesized that there would be a difference between CMC mode and group decision making performance and that coordination of communication would be reduced more under <b>delayed</b> <b>time</b> CMC than under real time CMC. Additionally, it was hypothesized that <b>delayed</b> <b>time</b> groups would take longer to reach closure on the task than real time groups. It was also hypothesized that <b>delayed</b> <b>time</b> groups would prepare and share more text than real time groups. It was also hypothesized that <b>delayed</b> <b>time</b> groups would produce higher text readability grade levels than real time CMC groups. Two of four hypotheses were supported. Bonferroni protected univariate F analyses were performed at the. 01 level of significance. Results indicated that while patterns of group process to reach closure were unique according to respective CMC modes, there were no significant differences between groups in regard to decision making quality (score on task). Group decision making is achievable through CMC despite time delays and absence of face-to-face or voice communication. <b>Delayed</b> <b>time</b> groups took longer to reach closure on the task than real time groups. Real time groups exchanged more messages than <b>delayed</b> <b>time</b> groups. There were no significant differences between CMC groups in regard to the number of sentences and words exchanged. <b>Delayed</b> <b>time</b> groups produced text that was of higher readability quality. However, it was discovered that short text exchanges by groups from both CMC modes influenced the readability analysis, thus misleading true text readability grade levels under CMC modes. It was recommended that future research is needed to provide further insight as to why users would choose to use <b>delayed</b> <b>time</b> computer communication versus real time computer communication. This will become increasingly important to ascertain as more end-users increase their utilization of interactive computer mediated communication, now a standard feature offered under multi-user and multi-tasking operating system environments...|$|E

To increase the database of auto-ignition <b>delay</b> <b>times</b> for methane-based fuel mixtures characteristic of natural gas, experiments to measure auto-ignition <b>delay</b> <b>times</b> have been performed for a variety of gaseous fuels in an atmospheric flow reactor. Autoignition <b>delay</b> <b>times</b> were measured for pure fuels in air including methane, ethylene, ethane, and propane. The effect of higher hydrocarbon addition on methane-based fuel ignition delay was then investigated for fuel mixtures composed of methane/ethylene, methane/ethane, and methane/propane where methane composition varied from 25 - 95 % by volume. Autoignition <b>delay</b> <b>times</b> were also measured for multi-component methane-based fuels composed of methane/ethane/propane and air. Finally the effect of CO 2 addition on methane autoignition was investigated. For all experiments, equivalence ratios for the experiments ranged between 0. 5 and 1. 25 and temperatures ranged from 931 - 1137 K. The most dramatic decrease (30 - 60 %) in auto-ignition <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> of binary methane-based fuels occurred with the addition of the first 5 - 10 % of a higher hydrocarbon. Further addition of a higher hydrocarbon continued to reduce auto-ignition <b>delay</b> <b>time,</b> but less dramatically.

The French SSS Observation Service (SSS-OS) manages a network of Voluntary Observing Ships equipped with thermosalinographs (TSG).

It is found that these two parameters can be derived independently based on the <b>delay</b> <b>times,</b> with short <b>delay</b> <b>times</b> (0.1 - [...]5 ns) resulting in the thermal conductivity and longer <b>delay</b> <b>times</b> (> 2ns) resulting in the thermal conductance.|$|R
40|$|Using {{a special}} {{property}} of dynamic complementary-suppression-modulated transmission (DCSMT) in the bacteriorhodopsin (bR) film, we have demonstrated an all-optical time-delay relay. To extend our work, {{the relationship between}} the <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> of the all-optical time-delay relay and parameters of a bR film is numerically studied. We show how the <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> changes with the product of concentration and thickness (PCT) of a bR film. Furthermore, the shortest and longest <b>delay</b> <b>times</b> are given for the relay of 'switch of'. The saturable <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> and maximum delay-time of 'switch on' are also given. How the wave lengths (632. 8, 568, 533 and 412 nm) and intensities of the illuminating light influence the <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> is also discussed. The simulation results are useful for optimizing the design of all-optical time-delay relays...|$|R
