Commentating on the local elections of May 1977, The Economist noted [...] "The Tory tide swamped the smaller parties. That specifically includes the National Front (NF), which suffered a clear decline from last year". Her standing in the polls rose by 11% after a January 1978 interview for World in Action in which she said [...] "the British character has done so much for democracy, for law and done so much throughout the world that if there is any fear that it might be swamped people are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>react</b> and be rather hostile to those coming in", as well as [...] "in many ways [...] add to the richness and variety of this country. The moment the minority threatens to become a big one, people get frightened". In the 1979 general election, the Conservatives attracted voters from the NF, whose support almost collapsed. In a meeting in July 1979 with Foreign Secretary Lord Carrington and Home Secretary William Whitelaw she objected to the number of Asian immigrants, in the context of limiting the total of Vietnamese boat people allowed to settle in the UK to fewer than 10,000.|$|E
500|$|On the film's Rotten Tomatoes listing, 57% {{of critics}} gave the film {{positive}} reviews from {{a total of}} 23 reviews. DVD Authority says [...] "After this one, the other Jaws movies seemed to just not be as good." [...] One review says: [...] "it's obviously not a patch on Spielberg's classic, but it's {{about as good as}} could be hoped for, with some excellent sequences, almost worthy of the original, several genuine shocks, a different enough story and some pretty decent characters." [...] The performances of Scheider, Gary and Hamilton are particularly praised. George Morris for the Texas Monthly preferred Jaws 2 over the original because it is [...] "less insidious in its methods of manipulation" [...] and [...] "because director Jeannot Szwarc streamlines the terror ... By crosscutting among the teenagers, Scheider, and the officials' efforts to rescue them, Szwarc works up enough suspense to keep the adrenaline going." [...] However, Morris' review is not entirely complimentary. He would have preferred the shark to have been seen less, positing [...] "producers and audiences alike seem to have forgotten that the greatest suspense derives from the unseen and the unknown, and that the imagination is capable of conceiving far worse than the materialization of a mere mechanical monster." [...] Similarly, John Simon felt that the [...] "shark's waning is caused by a decline in direction: Jeannot Szwarc has none of Steven Spielberg's manipulative cleverness. For one thing, he allows us close and disarming close-ups of the shark almost immediately..."Simon praises Scheider and Hamilton, but is less complimentary about Gary. A reviewer for the BBC complained that the additional screen time awarded to the shark makes it [...] "seems far less terrifying than its almost mystical contemporary". [...] The Radio Times was not pleased with Jaws 2, calling it a [...] "pale imitation of the classic original" [...] and stating that [...] "the suspense comes unglued because the film floats in all-too-familiar waters. You just know how everyone is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>react</b> — from the stars to the director, and even the mechanical shark." ...|$|E
