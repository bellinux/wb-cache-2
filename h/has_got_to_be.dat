Eve's incorrect reattachment of Julian's penis was criticized by co-star McKenzie Westmore.

Gerson noted how the song's intro provided an effective [...] "pull on the listener" [...] and wrote that, while the lyrics had a sorrowful quality, [...] "the effect is warming".

500|$|During World War II, Citizen Kane was {{not seen}} in most European countries. It was shown in France {{for the first time}} on July 10, 1946 at the Marbeuf theatre in Paris. Initially [...] most French film critics were {{influenced}} by the negative reviews of Jean-Paul Sartre in 1945 and Georges Sadoul in 1946. At that time many French intellectuals and filmmakers shared Sartre's negative opinion that Hollywood filmmakers were uncultured. Sartre criticized the film's flashbacks for its nostalgic and romantic preoccupation with the past instead of the realities of the present and said that [...] "the whole film is based on a misconception of what cinema is all about. The film is in the past tense, whereas we all know that cinema <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in the present tense." ...|$|E
500|$|Other Passions {{cast members}} {{had a more}} {{uncertain}} understanding of the character. Tracey Ross, who portrayed Eve Russell, responded negatively to Vincent's involvement in her character's storylines. While discussing the filming of the scenes in which Vincent gives birth to his father's child, Ross said she felt [...] "physically nauseous" [...] and could only complete them after the show's acting coach, Maria O'Brien, convinced her of [...] " [...] comedic possibilities". Vincent's manipulation of Eve to incorrectly reattach Julian's penis was criticized by co-star McKenzie Westmore, ("This <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the worst storyline ever done, what are they doing?"), who cited it {{as a reason for}} the show's cancellation. Kim Johnston Ulrich, who played Ivy Winthrop, said she was confused by Vincent's story arcs even though she was a fan of the series' supernatural elements.|$|E

500|$|On release, Meddle {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Rolling Stones Jean-Charles Costa wrote: [...] "Meddle not only confirms lead guitarist David Gilmour's {{emergence as a}} real shaping force with the group, it states forcefully and accurately that the group is well into the growth track again", and the NME called it [...] "an exceptionally good album". Steve Peterson of Hit Parader cited [...] "Fearless" [...] as its best song and said of the album, [...] "This <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> their best ever." [...] Ed Kelleher of Circus called it [...] "another masterpiece by a masterful group", noting [...] "Fearless" [...] as [...] "fascinating" [...] and praising [...] "Echoes" [...] as [...] "a tone poem that allows all four group members much time to stretch their muscles". However, Melody Maker was more reserved, describing it as [...] "a soundtrack to a non-existent movie".|$|E

[...] The Times stated that whoever {{thought it was a}} good idea for will.i.am to participate in the song ought to be [...] "locked in a windowless cell with nothing but those songs on a continuous loop". PopMatters, however, praised Thriller 25 and the remix of [...] "The Girl Is Mine". They wrote, [...] "Any album good enough to make you forgive (although maybe not forget) a song as bad as the Paul McCartney duet 'The Girl is Mine' <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> damn good." [...] They added that will.i.am had put a [...] "breezy spin" [...] on the track and that the song's omission of McCartney did not suffer because of it.|$|E
500|$|Ross was {{impressed}} with the in-camera effects achieved for the series, but he would always propose visual effect alternatives to these on set because [...] "you have to embrace what VFX can do for you. The cost of spending half a day on a special scene <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> worth it, or else you can just shoot a plate and do the rest in post and save yourself all that production time". Ross photographed all the series' sets as reference footage to work from in case a visual effect shot was ultimately required, explaining, [...] "Sometimes while looking at the assembly I’ll realize we need another shot but there isn’t any coverage that works. [...] us a starting point for building our new shots. And whether they are all-CG or just elements, we are always dealing with Noah’s aesthetic of making it look as real as possible." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite his radical views, Haywood {{emerged from}} the trial with a {{national}} reputation. Eugene Debs called him [...] "the Lincoln of Labor." [...] Along with his colorful background and appearance, he {{was known for his}} blunt statements about capitalism. [...] "The capitalist has no heart," [...] he often said, [...] "but harpoon him in the pocketbook and you will draw blood." [...] Another time, he began a speech by noting, [...] "Tonight I am going to speak on the class struggle and I am going to make it so plain that even a lawyer can understand it." [...] Yet Haywood also had a flair for dangerous hyperbole that, when quoted in newspapers, was used to justify wholesale arrests of IWW strikers. [...] "Confiscate! That's good!" [...] he often said. [...] "I like that word. [...] It suggests stripping the capitalist, taking something away from him.

500|$|Adversely, Bill Gibron, {{writing for}} DVD Verdict, gave Gunslinger a {{negative}} review, writing, [...] "Roger Corman {{was responsible for}} a lot of smoldering cinematic cowflops {{over the course of his}} economically sound career, but Gunslinger <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> one of the most overripe and ridiculous." [...] While he stated that [...] "Beverly Garland, who plays our dispassionate Rose, and John Ireland, as the cool and callous Cane Myro, are decent enough," [...] he wrote that [...] "there isn't much to recommend in this movie," [...] saying that [...] "there's too much unresolved intrigue, too many easy answers to rotten questions, to make heads or tails of what is supposed to matter." [...] TV Guide gave Gunslinger two stars, and said that [...] "it's a strange little Corman film, made before he went wholeheartedly for horror films, and this too has a semi-sense of the strange." [...] Film reviewer Leonard Maltin gave Gunslinger one star and a half.|$|E

[...] Kamara added: [...] "Now I am hungry for second helpings of success. And I am absolutely convinced I can get it here. We will not look out of place in the First Division because we have so much quality." [...] County's manager Colin Murphy told the press: [...] "All credit to Bradford, they won it fair and square. And that does not always happen in football. Bradford are a very experienced side compared to mine. Maybe this came a year too early for my boys." [...] Jacobs, the Bradford full-back who played 11 years for the club and won a subsequent promotion to the Premier League, said after his career: [...] "I just look back on some amazing times and I was delighted to be part of them.

500|$|... "Irresistible" [...] {{received}} largely positive {{reviews from}} critics. Entertainment Weekly rated [...] "Irresistible" [...] a B+, {{saying it was}} based on [...] "an unsettling concept to begin with" [...] that was reinforced by [...] "Chinlund's skin-crawling one-man show". Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club rated the episode A, praising the acting, particularly of Chinlund as Pfaster, and describing it as [...] "legitimately scary, a sign of a show that was pushing itself in new and interesting directions". The only criticism was for the scenes where Scully hallucinates Pfaster shapeshifting as [...] "pretty silly, almost feeling like an attempt to make sure something vaguely paranormal is in the episode so the fans don't get bored with what is ultimately a very good episode". Jessica Morgan of Television Without Pity gave the episode a B+ grade. Writing for Den of Geek, Nina Sordi ranked [...] "Irresistible" [...] the sixth best X-Files episode, saying that [...] "excluding CSM and his cronies, Pfaster <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the most disturbing villain that our favorite agents have encountered". Den of Geek writer Juliette Harrisson named it the [...] "finest" [...] stand-alone episode of the second season, describing it as [...] "a genuinely creepy 45-minute horror movie". Connie Ogle of Popmatters listed Pfaster among the best monster-of-the-week characters of the series, and IGN's Christine Seghers ranked Chinlund the seventh best guest star {{in the history of the}} show, considering that [...] "what makes him all the more frightening is how downright passive and polite he is up until the moment he's going to kill; the perfect camouflage for a modern-day monster." [...] TV Guide listed Pfaster among the [...] scariest X-Files monsters describing him as [...] "evil incarnate".|$|E
500|$|Her first {{starring}} film {{role was}} in the 2007 horror–thriller P2, in which she played a businesswoman who becomes trapped inside a public parking garage with a deranged security guard. About the dress her character wears {{for much of the}} film, Nichols said, [...] "When I read the script originally, it wasn't a dress, it was a small nightgown with no bra or underwear. Then I read the first scene where she gets wet, and I went: 'OK, this <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> altered! Nichols {{said in an interview that}} among the rules established in her contract were: [...] "I will not get wet and show nipples" [...] in addition to no nudity. A bra was sewn into the [...] "Marilyn Monroe dress" [...] she wore in the film. She said, [...] "I wasn't going to run around for two months without a bra, I thought that was inappropriate. But in place of the nipples there's clearly a lot of cleavage. So we made a compromise." [...] P2 was generally disliked by critics. Reviewer James Berardinelli said that her performance was [...] "admirable, although one wonders whether she was cast more for her physical assets than her acting ability." [...] John Anderson of Variety wrote that [...] "Nichols is in territory well trod over the years by everyone from Fay Wray and Grace Kelly to Heather Langenkamp, the terrified but gutsy heroine, who in this case has been chloroformed and put into a sheer white evening dress by her abductor—who must have anticipated that his captive would try to escape in an elevator, which he could then fill with water. (Nichols' considerable physical attributes, henceforth, seem to occupy most of the screen.) She's sympathetic, hysterical when required and likeable." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{pilot was}} first {{screened}} {{by a group}} of two dozen NBC executives in Burbank, California in early 1989. Although the pilot did not yield the explosion of laughter garnered by the pilots for the decade's previous NBC successes like The Cosby Show and The Golden Girls, it drew mostly positive responses from the assembled executives. One exception was Brandon Tartikoff, who was concerned that the show was [...] "Too New York, too Jewish". Before the episode's TV premiere it was shown to a test audience of 400 households, and met with extremely negative responses. Littlefield would later recall [...] "In the history of pilot reports, Seinfeld <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> one of the worst of all time". The memo that summarized the test audience's reaction, contained feedback such as [...] "No segment of the audience was eager to watch the show again" [...] and [...] "None of the [...] were particularly liked". Despite the low rating the show received from its test audience, the first public broadcast of [...] "The Seinfeld Chronicles" [...] took place on the fifth of July 1989, to see how viewers would react, even though the executives had already decided the show would not be picked-up for a full season. [...] "The Seinfeld Chronicles" [...] finished second in its time slot, behind the CBS police drama Jake and the Fatman, receiving a Nielsen rating of 10.9/19, meaning that the pilot was watched by 10.9% of American households, and that 19% of all televisions in use at the time were tuned into it. With these ratings [...] "The Seinfeld Chronicles" [...] finished in the 21st place of the week it was broadcast, tied with Fox's Totally Hidden Video.|$|E
