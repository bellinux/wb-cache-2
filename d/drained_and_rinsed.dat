50|$|LHM, being {{a mineral}} oil, absorbs only an infinitesimal {{proportion}} of moisture, plus it contains corrosion inhibitors. The dust inhalation problem continued, so a filter assembly was fitted into the hydraulic reservoir. Cleaning the filters {{and changing the}} fluid at the recommended intervals removes most dust and wear particles from the system, ensuring the longevity of the system. Failure to keep the oil clean is {{the main cause of}} problems. It is also imperative to always use the correct fluid for the system; the two types of fluids and their associated system components are not interchangeable. If the wrong type of fluid is used, the system must be <b>drained</b> <b>and</b> <b>rinsed</b> with Hydraflush, before draining again and filling with the correct fluid. These procedures are clearly described in DIY manuals obtainable from automotive retailers.|$|E
50|$|Bánh bột lọc trần is made {{by adding}} boiling water with tapioca starch, then mixing and {{kneading}} until a smooth, soft, and elastic dough is formed. The dough is then divided into small balls and flattened, where the filling {{is placed in the}} middle. The dough gets folded over the filling and the edges pinched together to seal the filling in and creating a dumpling shape. The dumplings are cooked in boiling water, then <b>drained</b> <b>and</b> <b>rinsed</b> with cold water. Making bánh bột lọc lá is similar to making bánh bột lọc trần. The dough is placed in blanched banana leaves, some filling is added in the center, and then some more dough is placed on top to cover the filling. The banana leaves are then wrapped tightly and tied together with small strands of banana leaf before being steamed. Regardless of the method, the dish can be frozen for later use.|$|E
40|$|Hydatid cyst, {{caused by}} Echinococcus granulosus is a {{worldwide}} occurring infectious disease. Although diffuse internal localization of hydatid cysts is common, intramuscular localization {{has rarely been}} reported. In this article, we present two cases. In case 1, ultrasonography (US) of a 22 years old male revealed a cystic mass in the paraspinal muscles. After the magnetic resonance imaging, percutaneous drainage was implemented under US guidance to the patient. The cavity was <b>drained</b> <b>and</b> <b>rinsed</b> with alcohol (95 %). The cysts, examined after 7 days, displayed a progressive shrinkage and solidification. In case 2, the hydatid cysts were localized in the lateral abdominal wall region. The patient was operated and treated with albendazole. The cystic lesions with rare anatomic localizations require differential diagnosis, especially particularly in the endemic regions of hydatid disease. Following a positive diagnosis, a less invasive method can be applied. Percutaneous drainage treatment was efficient for both diagnosis and treatment in case 1.

40|$|The fate of ammoniacal-nitrogen (NH 4 -N) was {{studied in}} a lab-scale {{downflow}} reed bed system treating an artificial landfill leachate. Individual reed beds were submerged by the leachate, then <b>drained</b> <b>and</b> <b>rinsed</b> by tap water. It {{was discovered that}} NH 4 -N was removed by a two-staged process, adsorption onto the reed bed media followed by nitrification into nitrite-nitrogen (NO 2 -N) and nitrate-nitrogen (NO 3 -N). A drop of NH 4 -N level of the leachate was observed when the reed beds were submerged. By rinsing of the beds, part of the NH 4 -N adsorbed inside the bed matrices was re-released into the rinse water. The presence of NO 2 -N and NO 3 -N in the rinse water demonstrated that nitrification process took place while the NH 4 -N was being retained inside the bed matrices. For artificial leachates with NH 4 -N levels of 150 ± 5 mg/l, an average removal rate of 43. 8 % in a three-hour treatment was achieved; mass balance analysis indicated that processes of adsorption, and transformation into NO 2 -N and NO 3 -N accounted for 63. 7 %, 4. 3 % and 24. 4 % of the NH 4 -N removal, respectively. This study also demonstrated that in general greater recirculation rate of effluent around the downflow reed beds gives higher NH 4 -N removal...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objectives}} of this dissertation were to refine electrochemical GAC reactivation technology, a promising alternative technology, and to investigate its technical feasibility. The specific {{objectives of the}} study were: (1) to evaluate alternative reactor designs; (2) to assess the effect of contaminant and GAC types on the regeneration efficiency; (3) to study the electrolyte post-treatment; and (4) to investigate reactivation mechanisms and model them. To achieve these objectives many interrelated topics were investigated using phenol, 2 -nitrophenol (2 NP) and naturally occurring background organic matter (NOM) as adsorbates and Filtrasorb 400 (F- 400), Westvaco Carbon (WV-B), Darco Norit, and Filtrasorb 300 (F- 300) as adsorbents. The impact of reactor operation conditions (reactivation time, current density, pH) on the reactivation efficiency showed that the reactivation efficiency (RE%) could be increased to a maximum by increasing the current and/or time. It was concluded that electrochemical reactivation of GAC is contaminant-type dependent. The reactivation efficiencies of F- 400 loaded with 2 NP and phenol at different reactivation currents and times showed similar patterns. A comparison of the percent reactivation of GACs showed that F- 400 and WV-B performed essentially {{the same for the}} tested conditions. Total destruction of desorbed contaminants and their by-products were possible. Desorbed phenol and 2 NP from loaded GAC react to form a number of reaction by-products that are eventually oxidized to CO 2 and H 2 O. The main mechanism responsible for electrochemical reactivation is high-pH induced desorption at the cathode. It accounts for approximately 50 [...] 60 % of the total reactivation of a single layer of GAC. It is recommended that the GAC electrochemical reactivation should be a three step process. First, the GAC is reactivated with a relatively low current to minimize potential alterations of the GAC surface. Second, the GAC is <b>drained</b> <b>and</b> <b>rinsed</b> with a buffered solution. Finally, the electrolyte is treated electrochemically for an extended time at a much higher current (and possibly a different electrode) to reduce the electrolyte's TOC so that it may be reused or discharged.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this Australian Coal Association Research Programme (ACARP) supported project was to bring together at a single site the two research groups involved in dense medium cyclone (DMC) instrumentation and software development to demonstrate the following: the long-term capability of the instruments in a coal preparation plant environment, a comprehensive DMC monitoring and measurement reporting capability, {{and the application of}} smart sensors to maximize the utility of measurements of this nature. The instruments were deployed for a minimum of 12 months and, apart from some initial issues, were shown to operate effectively in the robust environment of an operating plant. These instruments included motion analyzers on the desliming, product <b>and</b> reject <b>drain</b> <b>and</b> <b>rinse</b> screens, electrical impedance spectroscopes (EIS) for measuring the medium densities of the correct, DMC feed, overflow and underflow streams, a through tile density meter, and in-stream density meter provided measurements of the amount of magnetite in the medium at the DMC vortex finder and underneath the product drain screen. The motion analyzers were calibrated to link the stroke of the screens with the tonnes per hour of the oversize stream reporting from the screens. This meant that the mass flow of feed to the DMC and the product and reject streams was now available dynamically. From this data, an estimate, for the first time, of the on-line yield could be calculated...|$|R
30|$|Although it {{is found}} in many types of plants, the {{presence}} of caffeine in environmental waters is largely attributed to discharges of domestic wastewater (Martín et al. 2012; Metcalfe et al. 2003; Seiler et al. 1999; Wu et al. 2010). On the island of Barbados caffeine plants are not commonly grown, moreover, few cocoa and coffee plants are found in botanical gardens. Some {{researchers have found that}} anthropogenic caffeine is transported to ponds and marine systems via streams <b>and</b> rivers <b>draining</b> to the coast. Other researchers have indicated that overflows of on-site wastewater treatment systems and storm water run-off are also contributors of caffeine to surface waters. (Buerge et al. 2006; Peeler et al. 2006; Rounds et al. 2009). However, a significant source of caffeine to domestic wastewater {{is likely to be the}} disposal of unconsumed coffee, tea or soft drinks down household <b>drains</b> <b>and</b> <b>rinsing</b> of coffee pots and cups. The disposal of even a few cups of coffee into household drainage systems could contribute to hundreds of milligrams of caffeine to surface waters as domestic wastewater from sinks may flow to streams, rivers or ponds that finally deposits into the marine environment (Seiler et al. 1999). Another anthropogenic source of caffeine to the environment that is commonly neglected is the direct disposal of leftover medications into household sinks, toilets, or in trash that end up at the landfill. Caffeine tracked the population density and elevated concentrations of caffeine were attributed to large populations (Peeler et al. 2006; Rodriguez del Rey et al. 2012).|$|R
