Since 100% of natural thorium {{can be used}} as a fuel, and the fuel is in the form of a molten salt instead of solid fuel rods, expensive <b>fuel</b> <b>enrichment</b> and solid fuel rods' validation procedures and fabricating processes are not needed. This greatly decreases LFTR fuel costs. Even if the LFTR is started up on enriched uranium, it only needs this enrichment once just to get started. After startup, no further enrichment is required.|$|E
2500|$|According to the report, Iran had {{increased}} the number of operating centrifuges at its <b>Fuel</b> <b>Enrichment</b> Plant in Isfahan, and continued to enrich uranium. Contrary to some media reports which claimed that Iran had diverted uranium hexafluoride (UF6) for a renewed nuclear weapons program, the IAEA emphasized that all of the uranium hexafluoride was under IAEA safeguards. This was re-iterated by IAEA spokesman Melissa Fleming, who characterized the report of missing nuclear material in Iran as being [...] "fictitious." [...] Iran was also asked to clarify information about foreign assistance it may have received in connection with a high explosive charge suitable for an implosion type nuclear device. Iran stated that there had been no such activities in Iran.|$|E

The report stated that the IAEA had [...] "been able to verify the non-diversion of the declared nuclear materials at the enrichment facilities in Iran," [...] and that longstanding issues regarding plutonium experiments and HEU contamination on spent fuel containers were considered [...] "resolved." [...] However, the report added that the Agency remained unable to verify certain aspects relevant to the scope and nature of Iran's nuclear program.|$|E

This article summarizes the activities of the OECD/NEA working groups that coordinate and carry out work in the domain of criticality safety. Particular attention is devoted to establishing sound databases required in this area and to addressing issues of high relevance such as burn-up credit.

2500|$|In {{explaining}} why it had left its enrichment program undeclared to the IAEA, Iran {{said that for}} the past twenty-four years it has [...] "been subject to the most severe series of sanctions and export restrictions on material and technology for peaceful nuclear technology," [...] so that some elements of its program {{had to be done}} discreetly. Iran said the U.S. intention [...] "is nothing but to make this deprivation" [...] of Iran's inalienable right to enrichment technology [...] "final and eternal," [...] and that the United States is completely silent on Israel's nuclear enrichment and weapons program. Iran began its nuclear research as early as 1975, when France cooperated with Iran to set up the Esfahan Nuclear Technology Center (ENTC) to provide training for personnel to develop certain nuclear fuel cycle capabilities. Iran did not hide other elements of its nuclear program. For example, its efforts at mining and converting uranium were announced on national radio, and Iran also says that in consultation with the Agency and member states throughout the 1990s it underlined its plans to acquire, for exclusively peaceful purposes, <b>fuel</b> <b>enrichment</b> technology. Iran's contracts with other nations to obtain nuclear reactors were also known to the IAEA – but support for the contracts was withdrawn after [...] "a U.S. special national intelligence estimate declared that while 'Iran's much publicized nuclear power intentions are entirely in the planning stage,' the ambitions of the shah could lead Iran to pursue nuclear weapons, especially in the shadow of India's successful nuclear test in May 1974". In 2003, the IAEA reported that Iran had failed to meet its obligations to report some of its enrichment activities, which Iran says began in 1985, to the IAEA as required by its safeguards agreement. The IAEA further reported that Iran had undertaken to submit the required information for agency verification and [...] "to implement a policy of co-operation and full transparency" [...] as corrective actions.|$|E

40|$|In many countries, the {{criticality}} {{evaluation of}} {{spent fuel storage}} or transport casks assumes that fresh fuel is loaded instead of spent fuel. For criticaliry safety analysis, this assures a safety margin by simple calculations. However, this results in an excessively large criticality safety margin for typical burned light water reactor (LWR) fuel. There are indications that the nuclear power industry is moving to increased <b>fuel</b> <b>enrichments</b> in order to attain even higher burnups in LWRs. The resulting spent fuel {{can no longer be}} treated as if it were fresh. Current interest in plutonium recycle also provides an incentive to modify the fresh fuel transport assumption in that it inherently requires that spent LWR fuel be transported to and from reprocessing facilities on a timely and efficient basis. A balance needs to be sought between the two requirements: (b reduction of cost and optimal safety. Conventional reactor codes and data used for in-core physics calculations can be used to evaluate the criticality state of burned LWR fuel...|$|R

The current {{project was}} {{conducted}} in order to select an optimized open Thorium/Uranium fuel cycle for the Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR) concept in motivation for the 100 MWth PBMR Power Plant. A sensitivity study on the heavy metal loading of the fuel sphere was performed to accomplish this task. The effect on various parameters was evaluated to {{determine the influence of}} varying the Heavy Metal (HM) from 6 gHM/sphere to 20 gHM/sphere and at different feed <b>fuel</b> <b>enrichments</b> from 6 to 18 wt%. The findings also gave insight into the fuel cycle performance and the Uranium ore savings that is envisaged. The 20 gHM/sphere HM loading performed the best amongst the other HM fuel loadings.

Recommendations for further research based on the results obtained in the study, are made in the closing chapters. Master...|$|R

2500|$|The Nuclear Regulatory Commission was {{established}} under the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974. Under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, a single agency, the Atomic Energy Commission, had {{responsibility for the}} development and production of nuclear weapons {{as well as the}} development and safety regulation of the civilian uses of nuclear materials. The Act of 1974 split these functions, assigning to one new agency, the Department of Energy, the responsibility for the development and production of nuclear weapons, promotion of nuclear power, and other energy-related work. Regulatory work, excluding regulation of defense nuclear facilities, it assigned to the NRC. The Act of 1974 gave the NRC its collegial structure and established its major offices. The later amendment to the act also provided protections for employees who raise nuclear safety concerns. Applications for new plants are filed with the NRC and usually take between three and five years to be approved. They require detailed reports on all reactor operations, transportation of <b>fuels,</b> <b>enrichment,</b> waste storage, mining of yellow cake, and more. Moreover, the government often [...] "promises to provide incentives for building new plants through loan guarantees and tax credits," [...] backs loans or even direct funding for building, and conducts atomic research to further the field.|$|R
