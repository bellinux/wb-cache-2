5|$|Taft and <b>his</b> <b>Secretary</b> of State, Philander Knox, {{instituted a}} policy of Dollar Diplomacy towards Latin America, believing U.S. {{investment}} would benefit all involved, while diminishing European influence in regions where the Monroe Doctrine applied.

No foreign affairs controversy tested Taft's policy more than the collapse of the Mexican regime and subsequent turmoil of the Mexican Revolution.|$|E
