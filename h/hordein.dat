50|$|Gluten can {{be found}} in many common cereal grains {{including}} barley and wheat. Even in small quantities, the glutens specifically from barley and wheat (<b>hordein</b> and gliadin respectively) can trigger serious symptoms in those who suffer from Celiac disease.

50|$|The term gluteome {{is used to}} {{describe}} the entire set of all gluten-like proteins in grains, which consumption causes occurrence of clinical manifestations in celiac patients. These proteins include gliadins and glutenins from wheat, secalins from rye, <b>hordeins</b> from barley, avenins from oats and potentially homologues from other related grain species.

The occurrence of oat avenin toxicity in people with gluten-related disorders depends on the oat cultivar consumed, because the immunoreactivities of toxic prolamins are different among oat varieties. Also, many oat products are cross-contaminated with other gluten-containing cereals.|$|R

50|$|Gluten-free beer is beer {{made from}} {{ingredients}} {{that do not}} contain gluten such as millet, rice, sorghum, buckwheat or corn (maize). People who have gluten intolerance (including celiac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis sufferers) have a reaction to certain proteins in the grains commonly used to make beer, barley and wheat.

They are characterised by a high glutamine and proline content and are generally soluble only in strong alcohol solutions. Some prolamins, notably gliadin, and similar proteins found in the tribe Triticeae (see Triticeae glutens) may induce coeliac disease in genetically predisposed individuals.|$|E
25|$|Oat prolamins, named avenins, {{are similar}} to {{gliadins}} found in wheat, <b>hordeins</b> in barley, and secalins in rye, which are collectively named gluten.

50|$|The {{experimental}} {{evidence for the}} magnitude of this variation is very limited, but as the heats of combustion of the individual amino-acids are different it is reasonable to expect variations between different proteins. An observed range of from 5.48 for conglutin (from blue lupin) to 5.92 for <b>Hordein</b> (barley) was reported, which compares with Atwatersâ€™ range of 5.27 for gelatin to 5.95 for wheat gluten. It is difficult to calculate expected values for a protein from amino-acid data, as some of the heats of combustion are not known accurately. Preliminary calculations on cow's milk suggest a value of around 5.5 kcal/g (23.0 kJ/g).|$|E
5000|$|The {{majority}} of the proteins in food responsible for the immune reaction in coeliac disease are the prolamins. These are storage proteins rich in proline (prol-) and glutamine (-amin) that dissolve in alcohols and are resistant to proteases and peptidases of the gut. Prolamins are found in cereal grains with different grains having different but related prolamins: wheat (gliadin), barley (<b>hordein),</b> rye (secalin), and oats (avenin).

Gliadin in wheat is the best-understood member of this family, but other prolamins exist, and <b>hordein</b> (from barley), secalin (from rye), and avenin (from oats) may contribute to coeliac disease. Avenins toxicity in people with coeliac disease depends on the oat cultivar consumed because of prolamin genes, protein amino acid sequences, and the immunoreactivities of toxic prolamins which vary among oat varieties.|$|E

40|$|Celiac {{disease is}} an {{inflammatory}} {{condition of the}} small intestine in genetically susceptible individuals caused by ingestion of wheat gluten and corresponding proteins from barley and rye. Cereal storage proteins (prolamins) are responsible for immunological response of patients with celiac disease. Prolamins are alcohol soluble fractions, namely gliadins (wheat), <b>hordeins</b> (barley) and secalins (rye). The main triggering factor is wheat fraction with low molecular weight (20 - 30 kDa) called Î±-gliadins. Immunochemical detection of celiac active proteins is based on reactivity of gluten-detecting antibodies with prolamins extracted from cereals. In our study, we used Western blot analysis for detection of prolamin complex in cereal grains and processed foods (breads). Western blot {{was carried out by}} polyclonal antibody raised against wheat gluten. Reaction was positive for all kind of cereal grains. The samples of wheat and spelt wheat show much more positive affinity to antibody than rye and oat. As well as for cereal grains, all samples of bread showed positive immunological reaction with used antibody.

40|$|Celiac {{disease is}} caused by a {{selective}} lack of T cell tolerance for gluten. It is known that the enzyme tissue transglutaminase (tTG) is involved in the generation of T cell stimulatory gluten peptides through deamidation of glutamine, the most abundant amino acid in gluten. Only particular glutamine residues, however, are modified by tTG. Here we provide evidence that the spacing between glutamine and proline, the second most abundant amino acid in gluten, plays an essential role in the specificity of deamidation. On the basis of this, algorithms were designed and used to successfully predict novel T cell stimulatory peptides in gluten. Strikingly, these algorithms identified many similar peptides in the gluten-like <b>hordeins</b> from barley and secalins from rye but not in the avenins from oats. The avenins contain significantly lower percentages of proline residues, which offers a likely explanation for the lack of toxicity of oats. Thus, the unique amino acid composition of gluten and related proteins in barley and rye favors the generation of toxic T cell stimulatory gluten peptides by tTG. This provides a rationale for the observation that celiac disease patients are intolerant to these cereal proteins but not to other common food proteins.

5000|$|Beers brewed {{mainly from}} cereals such as millet, rice, sorghum, {{buckwheat}} and corn (maize), {{which do not}} contain gluten, do not trigger an autoimmune response in celiacs. Some brewers brew with barley or rye, and reduce the level of gluten to below 20 ppm. In most countries this technically classifies them as gluten-free beers. These brewers believe they are safe to drink. The brewers argue that the proteins from barley are converted into non-harmful amino acids. Statements from brewers show that their scientists feel confident that their product is non-harmful {{to those who are}} gluten intolerant. Some celiacs report problems drinking these beers. However, there is some concern and evidence that the claim is not true.(for example: Sheehan, Evans & Skerritt, 2001). Brewers who produce low gluten beers are required to test every batch for gluten, and record gluten levels in [...] "parts per million" [...] ('ppm'). Although the barley <b>hordein</b> in such tests may not be detected, smaller pieces of these proteins, known as peptides, may remain and be toxic for celiacs. Those involved in gluten-free brewing, and others representing celiacs or those with other conditions that require a gluten-free diet, tend to be concerned that beer brewed using wheat or barley are not appropriate for those with celiacs or dermatitis herpetiformis, although the carefully controlled gluten levels of particular malt brews of England and Finland may be low enough to be consumed in relative safety (Against the Grain, 5 ppm; Sinebrychoff Koff III, 20 ppm; Laitilan Kukko Pils, 4 ppm).|$|E
40|$|The low protein barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) {{cultivar}} `Karl' is {{deficient in}} hordeins, the major storage protein fraction, but has normal levels of other endosperm protein fractions. We compared <b>hordein</b> gene expression in Karl {{with that in}} `Traill,' a related cultivar that contains normal amounts of <b>hordein.</b> In plants grown in controlled environmental conditions, <b>hordein</b> accumulation in Karl was 55 % of that in Traill. The amount of <b>hordein</b> synthesized at all developmental stages tested was lower in Karl, as shown by pulse labeling of excised spikes with [3 H]leucine. To determine whether levels of <b>hordein</b> mRNAs were related to amounts of <b>hordein</b> synthesis, total RNA preparations from endosperms at three or four developmental stages were hybridized to cDNA probes corresponding to B and C <b>hordein</b> genes. Both B and C <b>hordein</b> mRNA levels were significantly lower in Karl than in Traill at intermediate developmental stages.

40|$|The {{effect of}} sowing date on grain protein, <b>hordein</b> {{fraction}} content and malting quality of two-rowed spring barley was investigated by using ten commercial cultivars with different grain protein {{content and the}} relationships among these traits were examined. The results showed that grain protein content and B <b>hordein</b> content increased as the sowing date postponed and were significantly affected by sowing date, while C and D <b>hordein</b> contents were less influenced by sowing date. There were significant differences in grain protein and <b>hordein</b> fraction content among the ten cultivars. The coefficient of variation of D <b>hordein</b> content was much larger than that of B and C <b>hordein</b> contents, suggesting its greater variation caused by different sowing dates. Beta-amylase activity and diastatic power were also significantly affected by sowing date, with malt extract being less affected. Significant differences in measured malt quality were found among the ten cultivars. Grain protein was significantly correlated with B <b>hordein</b> and malt extract positively and negatively, respectively. There was no significant correlation between beta-amylase activity or diastatic power and grain protein content.

40|$|The {{majority}} of beer proteins originate from barley (Hordeum vulgare) {{which is used}} for brewing. Barley is known to contain celiacogenic gliadin-like prolamins (<b>hordeins)</b> along with other immunogenic proteins which endure malt proteases and the harsh conditions of brewing. In addition, a multitude of peptides that may retain or even amplify the immune-stimulating potential is released in beer because of proteolysis. The comprehensive annotation of the beer proteome is challenged both by the high concentration range of the protein entities and by a severe degree of processing-induced modifications. Overcoming the pitfalls of the classical two-dimensional electrophoresis approach coupled to mass spectrometry (MS), the gel-free shotgun proteomic analysis expanded the current inventory of a popular Italian beer to 33 gene products, including traces of intact B- and D-hordeins and 10 proteins from Saccharomyces spp. The high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray MS/MS peptidomic analysis of the low-molecular weight beer components disclosed a panel of hordein-derived peptides that encrypt gluten-like sequence motifs, potentially harmful to celiacs. The presence of antigliadin IgA-immunoresponsive prolamins was assayed by Western and dot blot using sera of N= 4 celiac patients.

A second, more abundant protease {{has now been}} purified from this tissue. This protease, designated EP-B, has an apparent Mr of 30, 000 on 10 % sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). It resolves into two bands during native isoelectric focusing with pl of 4. 6 to 4. 7. The analysis of hemoglobin digestion products by both gradient SDS-PAGE and Bio-Gel P 2 chromatography, the inhibition of protease activity by E- 64, leupeptin, iodoacetate, and p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, and N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis all indicate that EP-B is a cysteine proteinase. The first 22 amino acids at the N terminus of EP-B have been determined, and their sequence is 90 % {{similar to that of}} EP-A. EP-B has properties similar to EP-A; however, EP-B is much more sensitive to high pH during gel electrophoresis and therefore is not detectable on native activity gels used to detect EP-A.

40|$|High malting {{quality of}} barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) relies on many traits, such as Î²-amylase and limit {{dextrinase}} activities and Î²-glucan and protein fraction contents. In this study, interval mapping was utilized to detect quantitative trait loci (QTLs) affecting these malting quality parameters using a doubled haploid (DH) population from a cross of CM 72 (six-rowed) by Gairdner (two-rowed) barley cultivars. A total of nine QTLs for eight traits were mapped to chromosomes 3 H, 4 H, 5 H, and 7 H. Five {{of the nine}} QTLs mapped to chromosome 3 H, indicating a possible role of loci on chromosome 3 H on malting quality.
