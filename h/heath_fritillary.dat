50|$|The wood {{has been}} heavily managed {{in the past}} as wood pasture and as a source for sweet {{chestnut}} (Castanea sativa) coppice. When conditions are open, after the coppice is cut, much of the ground is colonised by common cow-wheat (Melampyrum pratense), which is the food plant of the caterpillar of the rare <b>heath</b> <b>fritillary</b> (Melitaea athalia) butterfly. As the chestnut grows up again and the shade becomes denser, the habitat becomes unsuitable for the flowers and butterflies, therefore {{it is very important that}} regular coppicing is carried out to maintain open areas for our colony of one of Britain's rarest butterflies. The older coppice is, however, valuable for nesting birds such as warblers, and the maturing oak and wild service tree (Sorbus torminalis) stands attract many insects and birds such as woodpeckers, nuthatches and treecreepers.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Species {{movement}} {{responses to}} landscape structures {{have been studied}} {{using a variety of}} methods, but movement research is still in need of simple methods that help predicting and comparing movements across structurally different landscapes. We demonstrate how habitat-specific movement models can be used to disentangle causes of differentiated movement patterns in structurally different landscapes and to predict movement patterns in altered and artificial landscapes. In our case study, we studied the role of riparian landscapes to the persistence of the endangered false <b>heath</b> <b>fritillary</b> butterfly (Melitaea diamina) in its newly discovered coastal distribution region in Finland. We compared the movement parameters of the riparian population to two reference populations by using capture-recapture data and habitat-specific diffusion modelling, and analysed the role of the river and riverbank buffer zones in facilitating or hindering false <b>heath</b> <b>fritillary</b> movement with movement simulations. Results The riparian population of the false <b>heath</b> <b>fritillary</b> did not show major differences to reference populations in terms of movement parameters within breeding habitat, high-quality matrix and low-quality matrix. However, movement simulations showed that the habitat-specific movement parameters estimated for the false <b>heath</b> <b>fritillary</b> can lead into markedly different movement patterns in structurally different landscapes. An artificial riparian landscape mimicking those of the coastal distribution resulted into more directional, longitudinal movements both parallel and perpendicular to the river than a more mosaic-like landscape, but the existence of the river in the landscape reduced movements across the river. Conclusions Our study demonstrates how habitat-specific movement models enable comparisons of movement patterns across structurally different real, altered and artificial landscapes. As such, they can be used to compare movement parameters across populations, to study the effects of management interventions to endangered species and to identify areas that have high sensitivity to individual movement. In our case study, the river is shown to perform a dual role for the movements of the riparian false <b>heath</b> <b>fritillary</b> population. Whereas the river acts as a moderate movement barrier for the false <b>heath</b> <b>fritillary,</b> the longitudinal configuration of riverbank habitats provides a means especially for the male false heath fritillaries to move across the landscape...|$|E
40|$|Species {{living in}} metapopulations depend on {{connected}} habitat networks for their survival. If habitat networks experience fast temporal dynamics, species conservation requires preventing habitat discontinuities {{that could lead}} to metapopulation extinctions. However, few institutional solutions exist for the maintenance of spatiotemporally dynamic habitat networks outside of protected areas. To explore this often neglected problem, we studied the institutional fit of false <b>heath</b> <b>fritillary</b> (Melitaea diamina) conservation in Finland from the perspective of conservation institutions' ability to manage early successional habitat availability for this endangered species. We identified four institutional arrangements that enable effective conservation management of dynamic habitat networks: (1) acknowledgment of habitat dynamics, (2) monitoring of and responding to changes in the habitat network, (3) management of resources for fluctuating resource needs, and (4) scaling of activities through flexible collaborations. These arrangements provide the institutional flexibility needed for responding to temporal changes in habitat availability...|$|E
40|$|HIGHLIGHTS • A major {{milestone}} {{was made}} {{as the number}} of sites monitored in 2009 exceeded a thousand, whilst trends were assessed for 53 of the 59 regularly occurring UK species. • Following two of the poorest years on record for butterflies in the UK, most species made some recovery in {{what turned out to be}} a mixed year, still ranking below average (23) in the 34 - year series. • The year ranked as the second best on record for Painted Lady migration with a huge influx in May/June. • Many expanding species continued to do well, whilst five species produced their highest index of the series – Comma, Green-veined White, Ringlet, Speckled Wood and the habitat specialist, Large Heath. • However, despite a warm, sunny start to the year, much of the butterfly season in July and August was once again characterised by wet weather having an adverse effect on a number of species. • Four species had their worst year with continued declines for some of our most threatened species – Duke of Burgundy, <b>Heath</b> <b>Fritillary,</b> Lulworth Skipper and Wood White. • Other threatened species, as well as some of our commoner species, still produced low indices despite the slight recovery from 2008. • For 47 of the 53 species assessed (89...|$|E
40|$|Many species require {{habitats}} {{that are}} naturally patchily-distributed and ephemeral, but human activities fundamentally alter the rate and scale of habitat change. This thesis describes {{the development of}} a new metapopulation simulation model applicable to a broad range of species that depend on dynamic habitat. I apply the model to two' case studies, both involving butterfly species that use early-successional habitats and that are UK BiodiversIty Action Plan priority species. I describe. two methods for parameterising the model for a particular metapopulation in a particular landscape. One method uses parallel disturbance ar:d population presence data for a few consecutive years; the other derives population parameters and landscape parameters from separate data sources. In the first case study, I found that the BAP target for <b>Heath</b> <b>Fritillary</b> (Melitaea athalia) populations in the Blean Woods, Kent, could either be met by approximately doubling the coppicing effort, or by concentrating the existing effort into one of the larger woodland blocks. In the second case study, I found that the rate of heathland burning in the South Stack area of Angl~seywas not enough by itself to sustain the metapopulation of Silver-studded Blues (Plebejus argus). However, the metapopulation is probably saved from extinction by the existence of permanently-suitable habitat close to the coast. I have also elucidated an important phenomenon in metapopulations with dynamic habitat: the relationship between patch occupancy and patch connectivity can be obscured by the temporal changes in habitat. This has important implications for the debate about whether many real populations actually fit the metapopulation paradigm because the existence of metapopulation dynamics is often determined by testing the connectivity-occupancy relationship. The simulation model, 'MANAGE', is an important new tool for integrating landscape-scale information, and answering conservation questions, in a field which is relatively new and unexplored.
