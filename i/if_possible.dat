5|$|<b>If</b> <b>possible,</b> {{the use of}} {{wood and}} {{cellulose}} derivatives should be avoided entirely. Many varnishes and paints are well known emitters of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), {{some of which may}} be acidic, and thus have the potential to damage calcium carbonate specimens. Because of this, these coatings should also be avoided; water-based varnishes and paints are considered less harmful, and should be preferred.|$|E

5|$|Cells cannot {{function}} if DNA damage corrupts {{the integrity}} and accessibility of essential information in the genome (but cells remain superficially functional when non-essential genes are missing or damaged). Depending {{on the type of}} damage inflicted on the DNA's double helical structure, a variety of repair strategies have evolved to restore lost information. <b>If</b> <b>possible,</b> cells use the unmodified complementary strand of the DNA or the sister chromatid as a template to recover the original information. Without access to a template, cells use an error-prone recovery mechanism known as translesion synthesis as a last resort.|$|E
5|$|Gregory also {{instructed}} Augustine {{on other}} matters. Temples {{were to be}} consecrated for Christian use, and feasts, <b>if</b> <b>possible,</b> moved to days celebrating Christian martyrs. One religious site was revealed to be a shrine of a local St Sixtus, whose worshippers were unaware of details of the martyr's life or death. They may have been native Christians, but Augustine did not treat them as such. When Gregory was informed, he told Augustine to stop the cult and use the shrine for the Roman St Sixtus.|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} I argue that {{pedagogical}} reform {{is needed in}} the current Westernized teaching of sociology to create a new, more equal, humane and ecologically sound world. Present teaching methods encourage instrumental approaches to studying and learning. As a result, students seem to have grown indifferent to learning, becoming mere reflections of their study environment. In confronting the needed pedagogical reform, I focus on the smallest particle of higher education – {{the structure of the}} teaching and learning process in the sociology classroom, and suggest the implementation of collaborative learning situations.

5|$|However, {{the retreat}} went awry. The Allied contingents in the centre missed their {{appointed}} position {{and ended up}} scattered in front of Plataea itself. The Athenians, Tegeans and Spartans, who had been guarding {{the rear of the}} retreat, had not even begun to retreat by daybreak. A single Spartan division was thus left on the ridge to guard the rear, while the Spartans and Tegeans retreated uphill; Pausanias also instructed the Athenians to begin the retreat and <b>if</b> <b>possible</b> join up with the Spartans. However, the Athenians at first retreated directly towards Plataea, and thus the Allied battle line remained fragmented as the Persian camp began to stir.|$|E

The city centre is closed to cars, and no trams ride {{in the heart of}} the city; people are urged to avoid Amsterdam Centraal railway station and use other stations <b>if</b> <b>possible</b> from their direction. International trains that normally begin or terminate at Amsterdam Centraal are instead directed to a suburban stop.|$|E

Authors are not permitted to nominate their own works, though they can decline nominations. Ties in the final vote are broken, <b>if</b> <b>possible,</b> by the number of nominations the works received.|$|E
5|$|On 19 July, {{reconnaissance}} aircraft located a Turkish {{force in the}} desert moving west. The regiment and the 2nd Light Horse Brigade were ordered to establish a line of observation posts in their path. They were to send out patrols to locate them, but withdraw if attacked. <b>If</b> <b>possible,</b> they were to retire towards Romani, enticing the Turks to follow them. At dawn on 20 July the regiment located the Turks digging trenches near Ogratina. Rifle fire was exchanged and some prisoners were captured. The prisoners revealed that the force comprised twelve battalions with artillery support, planning to attack Romani.|$|E

40|$|Sightlence is a haptic game {{interface}} {{translation of}} Pong.

The two-fold purpose of answering these questions was to explore <b>if</b> it is <b>possible</b> to make computer games more accessible with haptic interfaces, and the possibility of using the haptic modality alone {{in a manner similar to}} the graphic and audio modalities when designing computer games. The Sightlence game demonstrates that game designers can create haptic game interfaces with expressive capabilities closer to that of its graphical and audio counterparts even though it’s currently not common to do so in game development projects...|$|R
