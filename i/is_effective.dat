The influence of different moisture levels (47, 57 and 67 w. b. %), in two loading orientation (longitudinal and transverse) and three loading speed (4, 6 and 8 mm min- 1) on the mechanical properties of pea such as maximum deformation, rupture force, rupture energy, toughness {{and the power to}} break the pea was investigated. It was observed in the physical properties that moisture changes were affective at 1 % on, dimensions, geometric mean diameter, volume, sphericity index and the surface area. It was observed in the mechanical properties that moisture changes <b>were</b> <b>effective</b> at 1 % on, maximum deformation, rupture force, rupture energy, toughness and the power to break.

5|$|A {{successful}} {{test for}} beryllium in air and on surfaces has been recently developed and published {{as an international}} voluntary consensus standard ASTM D7202. The procedure uses dilute ammonium bifluoride for dissolution and fluorescence detection with beryllium bound to sulfonated hydroxybenzoquinoline, allowing up to 100 times more sensitive detection than the recommended limit for beryllium concentration in the workplace. Fluorescence increases with increasing beryllium concentration.
