5|$|Barça's local rival {{has always}} been Espanyol. Blanc-i-blaus, {{being one of the}} clubs granted royal patronage, was founded <b>exclusively</b> <b>by</b> Spanish {{football}} fans, unlike the multinational nature of Barça's primary board. The founding message of the club was clearly anti-Barcelona, and they disapprovingly saw FC Barcelona as a team of foreigners. The rivalry was strengthened by what Catalonians saw as a provocative representative of Madrid. Their original ground was in the affluent district of Sarrià.|$|E
5|$|In 1831, {{construction}} on the third state capitol building began. This building, designed by the firm of Ithiel Town and Alexander Jackson Davis, had a design inspired by the Greek Parthenon and opened in 1841. It was the first statehouse that was built and used <b>exclusively</b> <b>by</b> the state government.|$|E
5|$|In 1881, Dr. Carlos Finlay, a Scottish {{physician}} practising in Havana, {{theorized that}} yellow fever was transmitted by a specific mosquito, later designated Aedes aegypti. The theory remained controversial {{for twenty years}} until confirmed in 1901 by Walter Reed. This was the first scientific proof of a disease being transmitted <b>exclusively</b> <b>by</b> an insect vector, and demonstrated that control of such diseases necessarily entailed control or eradication of its insect vector.|$|E

5|$|In 2016, {{three new}} major {{metabolites}} of bupropion, all formed <b>exclusively</b> <b>by</b> CYP2C19, were identified. These include 4'-OH-bupropion, erythro-4'-OH-hydrobupropion and threo-4'-OH-hydrobupropion, and represent 24% of {{a dose of}} bupropion excreted in urine. For comparison, bupropion and its three previously known primary metabolites, hydroxybupropion, threohydrobupropion, and erythrohydrobupropion represent 23% of a dose of bupropion excreted in urine.|$|E

5|$|Kingdoms—roughly {{the size}} of commanderies—were ruled <b>exclusively</b> <b>by</b> the emperor's male {{relatives}} as semi-autonomous fiefdoms. Before 157 BC some kingdoms were ruled by non-relatives, granted to them {{in return for their}} services to Emperor Gaozu. The administration of each kingdom was very {{similar to that of the}} central government. Although the emperor appointed the Chancellor of each kingdom, kings appointed all the remaining civil officials in their fiefs.|$|E
5|$|The album Adios {{was written}} and {{performed}} almost <b>exclusively</b> <b>by</b> Konietzko and Skold. Ogre again provided vocals, as did German musician Nina Hagen. Originally {{the fulfillment of}} the band's ten record contract with Wax Trax!/TVT, Adios later signaled {{the breakup of the}} band itself, which Esch's and Schulz's limited participation foreshadowed.|$|E

In the 1733 version this continuo line is given to a continuo that includes cello, but not bassoon and violone.|$|E

5|$|The yucca, Yucca whipplei, is pollinated <b>exclusively</b> <b>by</b> Tegeticula maculata, a yucca moth {{that depends}} on the yucca for survival. The moth eats the seeds of the plant, while {{gathering}} pollen. The pollen has evolved to become very sticky, and remains on the mouth parts when the moth moves to the next flower. The yucca provides a place for the moth to lay its eggs, deep within the flower away from potential predators.|$|E
5|$|While at Busen, Abbe also {{enrolled}} in Hajime Tanabe's philosophy class at Kyoto University (then known as Kyoto Teikoku Daigaku, or 'Kyoto Imperial University'). During this period, his sister Toyoko began studying Tendō-ryū naginata under a female instructor named Mitamura Chiyo (in Japan, arts {{focusing on the}} handling of naginata have been practiced almost <b>exclusively</b> <b>by</b> women since the Edo period), and she would continue practicing that art {{for the rest of}} her life.|$|E
5|$|Also {{included}} in the NBA's 50th-anniversary celebration was {{the selection of the}} Top 10 Teams in NBA History. The list was compiled based upon unranked selection undertaken <b>exclusively</b> <b>by</b> members of the print and broadcast media who regularly cover the NBA. Teams were chosen from among all single-season individual teams. Each team won the NBA championship, and they combined to average 66 wins per season.

Between 2003 and 2005 viewers had around 10 minutes to vote after all the songs had been performed. Between 2006 and 2010 the televoting lines have been open throughout the programme. Since 2011 viewers vote after all the songs had been performed. Profits made from the televoting during the 2007 and 2008 contests were donated to UNICEF.|$|E
5|$|As of 2017, Toronto FC {{games are}} {{exclusively}} broadcast by TSN, with certain games (typically against other Canadian MLS franchises) also shown on CTV. Prior to 2017, Toronto FC games were broadcast <b>exclusively</b> <b>by</b> TSN and Sportsnet. Games {{that were not}} covered under national broadcast contracts with MLS or other competition organizers were divided evenly between the two broadcasters, pursuant to agreements between their parent companies (Bell Canada and Rogers Communications respectively) in connection to their joint 2011 purchase of MLSE.|$|E
5|$|As {{opposed to}} the VZ and all models {{previous}} which used Opel-sourced platforms adapted both mechanically and in size for the local market, the whole-new VE programme is the first Commodore to be developed <b>exclusively</b> <b>by</b> Holden in Australia. Despite its status as an all-new model, engines—comprising the 3.6-litre V6 and more powerful 6.0-litre V8—have been largely carried over from the VZ series. Innovative features to help minimise export redevelopment costs, such as a symmetrical centre console housing a flush-fitting hand brake lever, facilitate the conversion to left-hand drive. Internationally, the VE was badge engineered as the Chevrolet Lumina, Chevrolet Omega and Pontiac G8.|$|E
