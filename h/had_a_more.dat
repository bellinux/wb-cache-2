5|$|Van Alen was {{respected}} {{in his field}} for {{his work at the}} Albemarle building at Broadway and 24th Street, designed in collaboration with his partner H. Craig Severance. Van Alen and Severance complemented each other, with Van Alen being an original, imaginative architect and Severance being a shrewd businessperson who handled the firm's finances. However, the relationship between them became tense because of their disagreements on how best to run the firm. The breaking point came after a 1924 article in the Architectural Review that praised the building's design, giving attribution to Van Alen while ignoring Severance's role altogether; their association dissolved months later. This ended up being decisive for the design of the future Chrysler Building, since Severance <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> traditional architectural style and Van Alen <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> modern style.|$|E
5|$|After {{being dropped}} from the senior state team, Karthik was {{overlooked}} for the selection in the zonal Duleep Trophy, and played in the Under-19s for South Zone. He <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> productive time in his second zonal season, scoring 180 runs at 60.00 with three half-centuries. He was rewarded with selection in the national Under-19 team, and played in three youth one day internationals (ODIs) against Nepal. He made only 51 runs at 17.00 without taking a catch, but India won all their matches with ease.|$|E

5|$|Although the Romans <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> hostile {{attitude}} {{than the}} Greeks towards the Egyptians, some traditions such as mummification and {{worship of the}} traditional gods continued. The art of mummy portraiture flourished, and some Roman emperors had themselves depicted as pharaohs, though not {{to the extent that}} the Ptolemies had. The former lived outside Egypt and did not perform the ceremonial functions of Egyptian kingship. Local administration became Roman in style and closed to native Egyptians.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the success}} of the test programme, Senior Prom was {{cancelled}} in 1982; reportedly one reason for the cancellation of the project was that the size and configuration of the Senior Prom aircraft rendered it incapable of being carried in internal weapons bays such as that on the B-1 bomber; the AGM-129 ACM, a competing design to Senior Prom for the cruise missile requirement, <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> slender airframe with retractable wings, which rendered it capable of internal carriage; it began flight testing shortly {{after the end of the}} Senior Prom programme.|$|E
5|$|Game Revolution <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> {{critical}} review of Dino Crisis than others, saying the game expanded on the worse elements of Resident Evil while also ruining the good elements. They {{were impressed by}} the graphics but thought the environments looked too similar and got boring after a short time. Overall, they believed the game to be worse than Resident Evil 2, pointing out the game's shorter length, more tedious puzzles, weaker action, and lesser scare factor.|$|E

After appearing in Joey Breaker and the critically panned teen zombie picture My Boyfriend's Back, he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> notable role playing John Cusack's wealthy {{friend in the}} crime comedy Money for Nothing. In 1994, he portrayed an inexperienced mobster in the crime thriller The Getaway, starring Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger, and appeared with Andy García and Meg Ryan in the romantic drama When a Man Loves a Woman. He then played an uptight police deputy who gets punched by Paul Newman– one of Hoffman's acting idols– in the drama Nobody's Fool.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, Ian Gillan {{announced}} the band would fold, as {{he needed to}} rest his damaged vocal cords. The tone and style of his singing changed considerably when he eventually returned. His voice <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> nasal tone and this can be heard on albums he has made from 1983 to the present day. His use of multi-tracked backing vocals also became highly prominent. The rest of the band Gillan, particularly McCoy and Towns, were not happy at the sudden disbanding of the group so soon after the success of Magic, and sued Gillan for royalties.|$|E
5|$|In December 1877, Saint-Saëns <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> solid operatic success, with Samson et Dalila, his one opera to {{gain and}} keep {{a place in the}} {{international}} repertoire. Because of its biblical subject, the composer had met many obstacles to its presentation in France, and through Liszt's influence the premiere was given at Weimar in a German translation. Although the work eventually became an international success it was not staged at the Paris Opéra until 1892.|$|E

5|$|In {{the view}} of Pierre Riché, the {{disappearance}} of 220 bishops' seats indicates that the Lombard migration was a crippling catastrophe for the Church. Yet according to Walter Pohl the regions directly occupied by Alboin suffered less devastation and had a relatively robust survival rate for towns, whereas the occupation of territory by autonomous military bands interested mainly in raiding and looting <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> severe impact, with the bishoprics in such places rarely surviving.|$|E
5|$|Low {{concentrations}} of pollen {{are found in}} sediments left by Lake Tauca in the Salar de Uyuni. Lake Minchin sediments contain more pollen (indicating {{that it may have}} <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> favourable climate), but the lack of pollen may be the product of a deeper lake. Polylepis may have thrived in favourable salinity and climatic conditions. Increased Polylepis and Acaena pollen is observed {{towards the end of the}} Tauca episode.|$|E

5|$|Reverberation is {{the sixth}} studio album by the English rock band Echo & the Bunnymen. The album was {{released}} amidst a line-up {{change for the}} group, due to the departure of vocalist Ian McCulloch {{and the death of}} drummer Pete de Freitas. The remaining members, guitarist Will Sergeant and bassist Les Pattinson, were joined by ex-St. Vitus Dance singer Noel Burke, keyboard player Jake Brockman and drummer Damon Reece. The album was produced by former engineer for The Beatles Geoff Emerick at Ridge Farm Studio in Surrey, England, and <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> pronounced psychedelic sound than the group's previous releases.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the less}} common hadrosaurs in the Dinosaur Park Formation of Dinosaur Provincial Park, such as Parasaurolophus, may {{represent}} the remains of individuals who died while migrating through the region. They might also have <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> upland habitat where they may have nested or fed. The presence of Parasaurolophus and Kritosaurus in northern latitude fossil sites may represent faunal exchange between otherwise distinct northern and southern biomes in Late Cretaceous North America. Both taxa are uncommon outside of the southern biome, where, along with Pentaceratops, they are predominate members of the fauna.|$|E

The Jaguar S and B <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> comprehensive nav/attack system(consisting of a Ferranti/Marconi NAVWASS (NAVigation and Weapon Aiming Sub System) and a Plessey 10 Way Weapon Control System) than the A and E models used by the French Air Force. RAF Jaguars were used for rapid deployment and regional reinforcement, and others flew in the tactical nuclear strike role, carrying the WE.177 bomb.|$|E
5|$|Throughout its range, {{the giant}} otter interacts with {{indigenous}} groups, who often practice traditional hunting and fishing. A study of five indigenous communities in Colombia suggests native {{attitudes toward the}} animal are a threat: the otters are often viewed as a nuisance that interferes with fishing, and are sometimes killed. Even when told {{of the importance of}} the species to ecosystems and the danger of extinction, interviewees showed little interest in continuing to coexist with the species. Schoolchildren, however, <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> positive impression of the animal.|$|E

The new Politburo <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> conservative outlook than that found under Khrushchev; Kosygin, Podgorny and Andrei Kirilenko {{were the most}} liberal members, Brezhnev and Arvīds Pelše belonged to the moderate faction while Mikhail Suslov retained his leadership of the party's Stalinist wing.|$|E
