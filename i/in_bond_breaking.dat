It uses a linear combination of configuration state functions (CSF) or configuration determinants to approximate the exact electronic wavefunction of an atom or molecule. In an MCSCF calculation, the set of coefficients of both the CSFs or determinants and the basis functions in the molecular orbitals are varied to obtain the total electronic wavefunction with the lowest possible energy.

It is shown that the experimental results observed on n-Si/SiO 2 /ZrO 2 /Au capacitors at low voltage can only be reproduced with realistic values of the physical parameters when the trap-assisted contribution to the tunnelling current is included. The increase in the gate current density observed in a SiO 2 /ZrO 2 gate stack during constant gate voltage stress was investigated next. It is shown that the stress-induced leakage current can also be very well explained by the trap-assisted tunnelling model, taking into account the increase in the trap density N-t with stress time. It is found that N-t, varies as a power law with the stress time in the ZrO 2 layer, as in ultra-thin thermal SiO 2 layers.

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{fabricate}} strong and extraordinarily stable Bragg gratings in {{any type of}} fibre using femtosecond laser light has attracted much interest in the recent past. The induced index change {{has been attributed to}} glass densification brought about by nonlinear multiphoton ionisation resulting <b>in</b> <b>bond</b> <b>breaking,</b> local melting and rapid cooling occurring after optical breakdown by the high-energy femtosecond light. In this paper, a preliminary comparative study between fibre Bragg grating fabrication in germanosilicate fibre using 244 nm femtosecond source with a repetition rate of 250 kHz and 200 fs pulse duration and a 244 nm CW frequency doubled argon-ion source is presented. The reflectivities achieved in both cases were close to identical for similar writing fluences, as were the isochronal annealing profiles. This indicated that despite the very high repetition rate used, the collective heat generated by the femtosecond radiation plays no role in the compaction of the glass matrix. The index change observed in this case is a result of single photon absorption into known defect centres - the laser intensity was insufficient to excite the glass band edge leading to glass compaction. No qualitative difference in index change between CW and short-pulse excitation of these defects is found...|$|E

Since the van der Waals distance separates monomer molecules approximately three times greater than a covalent bond does, the formation of new covalent bonds upon polymerization is destined to produce the substantial amount of volume contraction.

The observation of functional group dependence in dissociative electron attachment (DEA) in gas phase 2, 3 has suggested its increasing potential for controlling the electron induced chemistry. In this case, selective bond breaking is possible by tuning the electron energy to the respective resonant energy.

This is mainly due to the inherent difficulties in condensed phase electron scattering experiment such as charge trapping, neighboring interaction etc. Moreover condensed phase electron-molecule interactions are different from gas phase.

In particular, {{it is noteworthy that}} zeolite L undergoes a slight thermal expansion, which is very unusual for an alumino-silicate microporous material. Actually, while most of zeolites show the so-called negative thermal expansion [see 5 for a review], the positive one is observed in a number of neutral siliceous zeolites, like CIT- 5, AlPO 4 - 31 and the one-dimensional 12 MR system ITQ- 4. In these materials the expansion is mainly realized along the direction of the main and large 12 - or 14 -ring channel [6], as observed in the zeolite L here investigated. Usually, in zeolites, most of the extraframework cations are coordinated by water molecules. Upon dehydration these cations move closer to the framework to form new bonds inducing strains on the framework, resulting in a structural deformation or even <b>in</b> <b>bond</b> <b>breaking.</b> Zeolite L represents an exception, because only one of the three cation sites (KD) is bonded to a water molecule, while the coordination spheres of the other cations are formed by only framework oxygen atoms. Moreover, among the five water sites, only two are at coordination distance from the framework oxygen atoms, while the others are involved only in water-water hydrogen bonds.
