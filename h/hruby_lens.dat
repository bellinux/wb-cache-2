50|$|Biomicroscopes {{have been}} {{a staple of the}} {{ophthalmic}} examination for nearly a century. The addition of slit beam illumination to a horizontally-mounted stereo microscope enables users of a slit lamp biomicroscope to optically 'slice' through transparent tissues in the eye to see them in cross section. Stereoscopic magnification further enables highly detailed inspection of ocular tissues. The use of lenses, such as the <b>Hruby</b> <b>lens,</b> contact lenses or handheld 90D or 78D diopter lenses enables magnified inspection of posterior structures such as the retina.|$|E
40|$|A new {{fiber optic}} probe {{developed}} for determining transport properties of sub-micron particles in fluid experiments in a microgravity environment {{has been applied}} to study different parts of an eye. The probe positioned in front of an eye, delivers a low power (approximately few microW) light from a laser diode into the eye and guides the light which is back scattered by different components (aqueous humor, lens, and vitreous humor) of the eye through a receiving optical fiber to a photo detector. The probe provides rapid determination of macromolecular diffusivities and their respective size distributions in the eye lens and the gel-like materials in the vitreous humor. In a clinical setting, the probe can be mounted on a standard slit-lamp apparatus simply using a <b>Hruby</b> <b>lens</b> holder. The capability of detecting cataracts, both nuclear and cortical, in their early stages of formation, in a non invasive and quantitative fashion, has the potential in patient monitoring and in developing and testing new drugs or diet therapies to 'dissolve' or slow down the cataract formation before the surgery becomes necessary. The ability to detect biochemical and macromolecular changes in the vitreous structure can be very useful in identifying certain diseases of the posterior chamber and their complications, e. g., posterior vitreous detachment and diabetic retinopathy...|$|E
50|$|Also ophthalmoscopy and {{gonioscopy}} examinations {{can also}} be performed through the slit lamp when combined with special lenses. These lenses include the Goldmann 3-mirror lens, gonioscopy single-mirror/ Zeiss 4-mirror lens for (ocular) anterior chamber angle structures and +90D lens, +78D lens, +66D <b>lens</b> & <b>Hruby</b> (-56D) <b>lens,</b> the examination of retinal structures is accomplished.|$|R
30|$|Till the {{introduction}} of the Volk lenses the concept of concave lenses for fundus observation with the slit lamp had been pursued (Littmann 1950 b), which had been introduced by Leonhard Koeppe with a contact lens (Koeppe 1918) and Karl Hruby through a hand held <b>lens</b> (<b>Hruby</b> 1941; Hruby 1950). From that earlier period the Goldmann three mirror contact lens has survived which is still a reliable clinical tool for examination of the macula and the fundus periphery (Goldmann 1949). Its disadvantages are the small area of visible retina, the need of touching the cornea and dilating the pupils.|$|R
