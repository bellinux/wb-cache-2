5|$|After Pantjawarna, Fred Young drew Njoo and {{his wife}} to the newly {{established}} Majestic Film. Deprived of their director and main star, Oriental hired the journalist Sutan Usman Karim to direct their fourth production, Panggilan Darah (Call of Blood). This film, written by Karim and starring Dhalia and Soerip, told of two young orphans {{as they tried to}} eke a living in Batavia. This film, which debuted in June 1941, prominently featured the cigarette factory Nitisemito, leading the Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran to suggest that it may <b>have</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> the advertisement. He records it as a modest success, although he notes that reviews were mixed.|$|E
5|$|Aston Villa have {{a unique}} {{relationship}} with the Acorns Children's Hospice charity that is groundbreaking in English football. In a first for the Premier League, Aston Villa donated {{the front of the}} shirt on their kit, usually reserved for high-paying sponsorships, to Acorns Hospice so that the charity would gain significant additional visibility and greater fund raising capabilities. Outside of the shirt sponsorship the club <b>have</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> hospice care for the charity as well as regularly providing player visits to hospice locations.|$|E
5|$|Although kings, {{rulers and}} {{powerful}} {{people have always}} been able to pay for entertainment to be provided for them and in many cases <b>have</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> public entertainment, people generally have made their own entertainment or when possible, attended a live performance. Technological developments in the 20th century meant that entertainment could be produced independently of the audience, packaged and sold on a commercial basis by an entertainment industry. Sometimes referred to as show business, the industry relies on business models to produce, market, broadcast or otherwise distribute many of its traditional forms, including performances of all types. The industry became so sophisticated that its economics became a separate area of academic study.|$|E

5|$|This section {{lists the}} record {{transfer}} fees {{paid by the}} club for a player. The highest transfer fee received by the club {{is believed to be}} the reported £32.5 million fee paid by Liverpool F.C. for Christian Benteke during the Transfer window following the Premier League 2014-15 season. The record fee Aston Villa <b>have</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> a player was £18 million (rising to £24 million with add ons) for Darren Bent from Sunderland in January 2011. In August 2008 Milner was bought from Newcastle United for an undisclosed fee. Milner's fee is officially undisclosed; various sources declare it to be between £1012 million. Also in August 2008, Aston Villa bought Curtis Davies for an undisclosed fee. Sources have speculated on the fee paid, and this has varied between £810 million. Due to the uncertainty surrounding these transfers they are not included in this table at this time.|$|E
5|$|When the Radstock branch was constructed, it was {{intended}} to link it to the main line of the Paulton branch at Midford, which was at a lower level at this point. The Lock Fund created in 1802 was to <b>have</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> the construction of the locks, but because there was little regular traffic on the branch, the company built one lock, an aqueduct over the Midford Brook, and a short tramway to bridge the gap. This contributed to the economic failure of the branch, and its replacement by a tramway in 1815. The tramway was laid along the former canal's towpath. It was single-line with passing places every , and was originally laid using cast iron plates on stone block sleepers, but was relaid using wrought iron plates.|$|E

He thought that the young people should have left off dancing when he appeared, and should have greeted him, as they would undoubtedly have greeted my lord the Count, had the latter deigned to come.|$|R

5|$|The planned {{extensions}} and realignment of the Canarsie Line were cancelled in 1973, due {{to community}} opposition against the proposed expressways {{that the line}} would have been built along with. Later that year, the LIE line was canceled because New York state voters had declined a $3.5 billion bond measure that would <b>have</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> five subway extensions, including the LIE line. This {{was the second time}} that voters declined a bond issue to finance this extension, with the first being on November 2, 1971 for $2.5 billion. The defeat set back the construction of subway construction projects, including the Lower East Side Loop, the Utica Avenue Line, the Nostrand Avenue extension, the Jamaica Avenue Line, and the Northeast Queens Line. The 1973 bond issue, in addition to financing the LIE line would have also paid for an extension of the IRT Dyre Avenue Line to Co-op City, an extension of the IND Queens Boulevard Line to Hillside Avenue and Springfield Boulevard, a joint LIRR/subway extension from the Atlantic Avenue LIRR terminal to Lower Manhattan, and a branch of the Queens Boulevard Line at 63rd Drive to the Rockaways via the abandoned Rockaway Beach Branch. The double fare to the Rockaways would have been removed, and while this was not done as part of the bond issue, it was removed on September 1, 1975. However, the MTA believed that many other projects would still be built. By November 1974, the MTA projected a 1981 opening date for the Archer Avenue Line to Springfield Boulevard, as well as a 1982 opening date for the 63rd Street Line and for the SAS from 34th Street to 125th Street. In 1983, the Queens Super Express Bypass was to open, and in the same year, the Bronx extension of the SAS and the BMT Jamaica Line reroute to Archer Avenue would open. The MTA thought that the SAS's southern extension to Whitehall Street would open by 1988, and that by 1993, the Utica Avenue, Nostrand Avenue, and LIE subway lines and the LIRR East Side Access would all open.|$|E

25|$|The NYCTA {{once again}} {{requested}} for {{funds for the}} third-tracking of the Jamaica Line for its 1965–1966 fiscal year. This time the projected cost would {{have been reduced to}} $16,450,000. In November 1967, William Ronan, chairman of the Metropolitan Commuter Transportation Authority, and later the chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, suggested that money from a transportation bond issue could <b>have</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> the installment of the third track on the line.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{several of}} the indoor arenas would be {{assembled}} elsewhere in the UK. The construction of the Aquatics Centre and the Velopark was confirmed before London won the Games, so {{it might be more}} accurate to call them legacies of the bid rather than of the Games. While the legacy venues would be tailored to London's ongoing needs, some of them would be expensive for that purpose. For example, London will <b>have</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> an 80,000-seat athletics stadium, but will only possess a 25,000-seat stadium.|$|E

25|$|On February 14, 2007, Skybus {{announced}} they {{had chosen the}} CFM56-5B engine built by CFM International to power the 65 A319 aircraft on order from Airbus.

As of April 2008, the Skybus Airlines fleet consisted of 13 Airbus A319 aircraft (out of a total order of 63), 12 received in December 2007 and one in March 2008, two of which were leased from Virgin America.

25|$|However {{the severe}} {{shortage}} of money further inhibited progress, with shareholders failing {{to respond to}} calls (in which they should <b>have</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> their shares in instalments) and by summer of 1854 {{more than half the}} company's shares had been forfeited from this cause. The directors now approached the Associated Companies (a consortium of the Great Western Railway, the Bristol & Exeter Railway and the South Devon Railway) for financial help, and in June 1855 a lease of the line was agreed, by which the Associated Companies guaranteed the Cornwall company's debentures (bank borrowings). This considerably eased the financial difficulties, enabling further contracts to be let.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, it was {{revealed}} that the county had budgeted $13.5 million for the land, or about $1.7 million per acre for 8 acres, mistakenly assuming they could acquire it for roughly the dollar amount of the 2004 option agreement between the city of Minneapolis and Land Partners II (the investment group which owned Rapid Park). The dollar amount on that deal had been $12.9 million, though the deal had also included 5 acres of adjacent land. Effectively, it would <b>have</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> only three acres of the 8-acre site that Hennepin County now needed to acquire, at a proposed price of $4.3 million per acre.|$|E

25|$|One economist's {{analysis}} calculates that, despite increased overall spending, Christmas is a {{deadweight loss}} under orthodox microeconomic theory, {{because of the}} effect of gift-giving. This loss is calculated as the difference between what the gift giver spent on the item and what the gift receiver would <b>have</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> the item. It is estimated that in 2001, Christmas resulted in a $4 billion deadweight loss in the U.S. alone. Because of complicating factors, this analysis is sometimes used to discuss possible flaws in current microeconomic theory. Other deadweight losses include the effects of Christmas on the environment and the fact that material gifts are often perceived as white elephants, imposing cost for upkeep and storage and contributing to clutter.|$|E
25|$|Bidding fee auction, {{also known}} as a penny auction, often {{requires}} that each participant must pay a fixed price to place each bid, typically one penny (hence the name) higher than the current bid. When an auction's time expires, the highest bidder wins the item and must pay a final bid price. Unlike in a conventional auction, the final price is typically much lower than the value of the item, but all bidders (not just the winner) will <b>have</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> each bid placed; the winner will buy the item at a very low price (plus price of rights-to-bid used), all the losers will have paid, and the seller will typically receive significantly more than the value of the item.|$|E
25|$|For {{repayment}} of the Government loans, {{there was}} a proposal to create an 'asset pool' at the bank, of a size greater than the loans. The bidder would have issued bonds against this asset pool, with maturities set inline with the repayment. Proceeds from the bond issue would have also gone to the Government and the bank would <b>have</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> a government guarantee for the bonds to trade in the market at or near prices of similar gilt-edged stocks. This would have replaced the original plan for the bidders {{to have to find}} their own investors to cover the first £15bn, which proved impossible, due to the credit crunch. The government would also continue to guarantee the Bank's liabilities, such as savers' deposits.|$|E
