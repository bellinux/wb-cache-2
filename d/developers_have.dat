5|$|Drake {{stars in}} 2012's , which is {{released}} on Sony's PlayStation Vita. The game's events take place sometime before those of Drake's Fortune, though <b>developers</b> <b>have</b> {{stated that it}} is not a prequel to Drake's Fortune but rather a separate original story. Nathan Drake was also on the shortlist for being a guest character in Street Fighter x Tekken, however the idea was scrapped.|$|E
5|$|European units {{primarily}} use the PEGI rating system, while North American units use the ESRB rating system. The Wii {{supports the}} rating systems of many countries, including CERO in Japan, the USK in Germany, the PEGI and BBFC in the United Kingdom, the ACB in Australia and the OFLC in New Zealand. Homebrew <b>developers</b> <b>have</b> reverse-engineered the function which Nintendo uses to recover lost parental-control passwords, creating a simple script to obtain parental-control reset codes.|$|E
5|$|It {{will also}} have glass walls, which {{according}} to DITIB spokesman Alboga will give visitors a feeling of openness. According to the architect, openness is further enhanced by an inviting staircase from the street. The <b>developers</b> <b>have</b> required that the secular areas of the mosque (e.g. the restaurant, event halls and stores) be open to people of all religions.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>developer</b> <b>has</b> {{said it is}} [...] "a {{bit like}} the film Contagion except {{you are on the}} other side". The <b>developer</b> <b>has</b> said the game was {{inspired}} by Pandemic 2, a browser-based Flash game released in 2008 by Dark Realm Studios.|$|R

5|$|Yuke's {{studios in}} Yokohama, Japan worked with WWE writers to create storylines {{for the season}} modes of each game. When WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2007 was {{released}} {{for more than one}} console, Yuke's had to port their original game codes that make up each game mode and graphic designs to a new game engine that supported the new consoles. When new features are added to WWE 2K games, <b>developers</b> <b>have</b> to create new gaming codes for the features. Along with the features, the <b>developers</b> <b>have</b> to test the game for any errors. An improvement done yearly by Yuke's with each release of a WWE 2K game is the polygon count for the 3D models of the superstars in each game. Technical limitations had occurred through the series which lead the developers to adjust custom characters while loading. Beginning with WWE '12, promotion render art photos were used up to WWE 2K16; from WWE 2K17 on, the promotion render art was replaced with in-game rendering to accommodate created characters to lessen loading times.|$|E
5|$|Game <b>developers</b> <b>have</b> {{continued}} to increase support for machinima. Products such as Lionhead Studios' 2005 business simulation game The Movies, Linden Research's virtual world Second Life, and Bungie's 2007 first-person shooter Halo 3 encourage the creation of user content by including machinima software tools. Using The Movies, Alex Chan, a French resident with no previous filmmaking experience, took four days to create The French Democracy, a short political film about the 2005 civil unrest in France. Third-party mods like Garry's Mod usually offer the ability to manipulate characters {{and take advantage of}} custom or migrated content, allowing for the creation of works like Counter-Strike For Kids that can be filmed using multiple games.|$|E
5|$|In August 2007, Sony Computer Entertainment America {{released}} {{news that}} PlayStation 3 consoles {{would be used}} as the dedicated servers for Warhawk. A photograph was released which showed a server room with several PlayStation 3 consoles in racks. Each server is able to support 32 players. The games <b>developers</b> <b>have</b> commented that the engine used in the game features technology which could not be easily implemented on any other platform, such as procedurally generated water and waves, as well as volumetric clouds.|$|E

50|$|The <b>developer</b> <b>has</b> now {{confirmed}} {{a substantial}} completion date of September 30, 2016, for the Nova Centre, with an official opening for the Halifax Convention Centre planned for January 2017. The final floor {{plans for the}} convention centre have been unveiled and the <b>developer</b> <b>has</b> committed to regular project updates and ongoing collaboration with project partners to ensure that progress continues as scheduled.|$|R
5|$|The {{designers}} {{have stated that}} non-human characters and races feature {{a prominent role in}} the game, which was influenced by an interest in history among the developers. Comparing the non-human races in Final Fantasy IX with those of XII, the <b>developers</b> <b>have</b> stated that the former were modeled after humans, while the latter were fundamentally different in terms of biological characteristics. These non-human races include Bangaa, Viera, Seeq, and Moogles. In the game humans are referred to as Humes. Some of the races in the game that first appeared in Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, such as Bangaa, were originally designed for Final Fantasy XII.|$|E
5|$|The {{private sector}} has {{also played a}} large role in revitalizing the area, even without public aid and incentives. <b>Developers</b> <b>have</b> been {{attracted}} to the historic buildings and their surrounding neighborhoods, calling it the city's strongest asset, although they have complained about past stalemates in city government. One initiative has often led to others. River Street's development into a center for antique stores came about without any public effort or intent, and the restoration of the music hall at the Savings Bank led to many new restaurants opening in the neighborhood. The blocks of River Street north of Monument Square have a dozen woman-owned businesses.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{repetitive}} {{actions and}} long-playing times, 4X games {{have been criticized}} for excessive micromanagement. In early stages of a game this is usually not a problem, but later in a game directing an empire's numerous settlements can demand several minutes to play a single turn. This increases playing-times, which are a particular burden in multiplayer games. 4X games began to offer AI governors that automate the micromanagement of a colony's build orders, but players criticized these governors for making poor decisions. In response, <b>developers</b> <b>have</b> tried other approaches to reduce micromanagement, and some approaches have been more well received than others. Commentators generally agree that Galactic Civilizations succeeds, which GamingNexus.com attributes to the game's use of programmable governors. Sins of a Solar Empire was designed to reduce the incentives for micromanagement, and reviewers found that the game's interface made empire management more elegant. On the other hand, Master of Orion III reduced micromanagement by limiting complete player control over their empire.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of the Megami Tensei series is developed by Atlus' R Department 1. Other <b>developers</b> <b>have</b> {{been involved with the}} series: these include Multimedia Intelligence Transfer (Last Bible series), Lancarse (Strange Journey), CAVE (Imagine) and Nex Entertainment (Nine), and Arc System Works (Persona 4 Arena). Most of the games up to 2003 were handled by Okada, but when he departed to form his own company Gaia, Kazuma Kaneko became the series' creative director. There are two main writers in the franchise: Shogo Isogai and Ryutaro Ito. Ito first worked on Megami Tensei II, joining the team after development to write the script, along with working with the script and being part of the debug team. Isogai's first work for the series was the script for Shin Megami Tensei II. The next entry If... was also written by Ito, and designed as a departure from the grand scale of previous games, instead being set within a cloistered school environment. His final work for the series was the first Devil Summoner. Isogai also worked on Shin Megami Tensei II and If..., and later worked on multiple Devil Summoner games, Nocturne and Strange Journey. The music for the first five main Megami Tensei titles was composed by Tsukasa Masuko. For Nocturne, Shoji Meguro, who had done work on earlier spin-off titles, was brought in. He later became well known for his work on the Persona titles.|$|E

25|$|It {{appears to}} me that the <b>developers</b> <b>have</b> been {{completely}} indifferent to, or perhaps have even welcomed, this deterioration in the condition of the building, and have done virtually nothing to halt it. I feel the <b>developers</b> <b>have</b> shown a complete disregard for the moral obligations which arose from their course of dealing with the corporation or the planning applications; but I feel the corporation have also been extremely remiss to exercising whatever statutory powers were open to them to cope with the situation.|$|E
