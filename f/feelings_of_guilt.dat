5|$|Once you're a Catholic, you're {{always a}} Catholic—in {{terms of your}} <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> and remorse and whether you've sinned or not. Sometimes I'm wracked with guilt when I needn't be, and that, to me, is left over from my Catholic upbringing. Because in Catholicism you are born a sinner {{and you are a}} sinner all of your life. No matter how you try to get away from it, the sin is within you all the time.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} episode, Big Boo and Doggett's {{friendship}} continues to develop. Seeing that Doggett bears strong <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> {{relating to the}} six abortions that she has had, Big Boo makes reference to the book Freakonomics, which suggests that crime rates in the 1990s fell because of Roe v. Wade. Following Lorna Morello (played by Yael Stone) being relieved of her duty of driving the prison van, the role is given to Doggett. She comes into contact {{with one of the}} new correctional officers called Charlie Coates (played by James McMenamin). Coates is initially friendly towards Doggett. Despite relationships between prison staff and prisoners being forbidden, Coates kisses Doggett, against her will, after feeding some ducks. Following another outing, Coates gets in trouble with his boss Joe Caputo (played by Nick Sandow) for being late for count and is placed on probation. Doggett apologises for having caused him trouble, and he rapes her {{in the back of the}} prison van.|$|E

40|$|This {{study has}} {{investigated}} {{the relationships between}} consumer ethics and the <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> and the <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> shame.   In addition, the relationships between consumer ethics and {{the willingness of the}} consumers to accepting religion, law and traditions  have also been investigated. The data has  been obtained from the responses of 159 students in Turkey to the questionnaire. The results revealed that there were positive relationships between the willingness to accept religious  rules and the consumer ethics. In addition, the results have shown that there  was no relationship between copyright and the <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt,</b> the <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> shame, the willingness to accept  law and the willingness to accept traditions...|$|R

25|$|The work theorizes {{that all}} people have self-destructive tendencies, {{including}} the narrator. The narrator's ultimate confession as a murderer is not inspired by any <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> but, instead, from a desire to publicize his actions despite knowing that he should not.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} investigates the effect <b>of</b> {{defendants}}' <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt,</b> during their trial {{as well as}} their interrogation, on their penalties. Results show that defendants who experience a guilty feeling are sentenced less severely than defendants who do not. Two cognitive processes mediate this effect: attribution of the offence to internal factors (referring to the defendant's personality) and attribution to external factors (referring to the situation). Results also emphasize the participants' difficulty in suppressing the information about the <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> and in controlling its effects on judgement. The implications are discussed. © 2011, Presses universitaires de Grenoble. SCOPUS: re. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

25|$|A {{hunger strike}} {{is a method}} of non-violent {{resistance}} or pressure in which participants fast {{as an act of}} political protest, or to provoke <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> in others, usually with the objective to achieve a specific goal, such as a policy change. Most hunger strikers will take liquids but not solid food.|$|E
25|$|Dreams of {{absent-minded}} transgression (DAMT) are dreams {{wherein the}} dreamer absentmindedly performs {{an action that}} he or she has been trying to stop (one classic example is of a quitting smoker having dreams of lighting a cigarette). Subjects who have had DAMT have reported waking with intense <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt.</b> One study found a positive association between having these dreams and successfully stopping the behavior.|$|E

25|$|Major {{life events}} that include trauma can cause {{individuals}} to experience <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> or self-hatred. Humans {{have the ability}} to reflect on their behaviours to determine if their actions are moral. In situations of trauma, humans can choose to self-forgive by allowing themselves to change and live a moral life. Self-forgiveness may be required in situations where the individual hurt themselves or in situations where they hurt others.|$|E
25|$|Fasting {{is often}} used {{as a tool to}} make a {{political}} statement, to protest, or to bring awareness to a cause. A hunger strike is a method of non-violent resistance in which participants fast as an act of political protest, or to provoke <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt,</b> or to achieve a goal such as a policy change. A spiritual fast incorporates personal spiritual beliefs with the desire to express personal principles, sometimes {{in the context of a}} social injustice.|$|E
25|$|Why did {{the date}} of Benjamin Britten's death – 4 December 1976 – touch such a chord in me? During this time I was {{obviously}} {{at the point where}} I could recognise the magnitude of such a loss. Inexplicable <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt,</b> more than that even, arose in me. I had just discovered Britten for myself. Just before his death I began to appreciate the unusual purity of his music – I had had the impression of the same kind of purity in the ballads of Guillaume de Machaut. And besides, for a long time I had wanted to meet Britten personally – and now it would not come to that.|$|E

25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Diane's death, Lofty blames himself and Dylan tries to support him by reminding him it was Diane's fault she died. <b>Feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> resurface when Lofty meets Diane's mother, Meg Stuart (Sharon Duce). On {{the day of his}} interview (which decides whether can continue practising medicine), Lofty meets Diane's daughter, Lana Westmore (Mimi Keene), and helps her to grieve for her mother. Consequently, he is late for the interview where he is allowed to continue working. Despite this, Lofty resigns from his job and decides to travel and retrain as a bereavement counsellor. Before he leaves Holby, he shares an emotional goodbye with Dylan and expresses his gratitude for his support.|$|E
25|$|Much of Audelay's {{poetry is}} {{concerned}} with the theme of repentance; he seems to have had a particular fondness for Saint Winifred, a local saint who was credited with both the power to free criminals from their shackles (perhaps significant in view of Audelay's possible <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> over Lestrange's transgression) and the power to cure blindness. Audelay also appears to have been strongly concerned with the exposure of priests to accusations of heresy, and particularly of Lollardy, in the wake of Archbishop Thomas Arundel's Constitutions: he directs an untitled satirical dialogue (usually known as Marcol and Salamon) against certain aspects of the church hierarchy, incorporating references to the great satirical poem Piers Plowman.|$|E
25|$|In 1901 Balmont and Lokhvitskaya met, apparently, for {{the last}} time. Since then their {{relationship}} has been confined to enigmatically constructed poetic dialogues, full of demands and threats on his part and pleas for mercy on hers. Apparently both were taking their shared self-created world of horror and passion seriously. Balmont was continuously complaining in his letters of being 'possessed', while Lokhvitskaya submerged herself in a quagmire of violent visions which, coupled with <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> towards her family, might have led to an illness the roots of which were obviously psychosomatic. Some (Alexandrova included) regard the involvement of Valery Bryusov, Balmont's close rival/friend {{to be the most}} damaging factor. The well-publicized fact that Bryusov (who hated Lokhvitskaya, thinking she was trying to 'steal' a friend of his) dabbled in black magic added a gothic touch to the whole affair.|$|E

25|$|Miller {{said that}} he did not feel he had to top himself in terms of {{production}} design compared to the previous films in the series. Instead, he wanted the production design to harken back to the earlier films and reflect the changes of the past 30 years. Colin Gibson, the production designer, said that they developed an internally consistent history to explain the film's look and justify its use of hot rods. Gibson designed the film's vehicles, all of which are fully functional. Construction of some of the vehicles began as early as 2003. The cars were designed to show characterisation and detail in the world, including the characters' <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt,</b> loss, and their attempts to recycle the remains of civilisation. Both the Doof Wagon and the Doof Warrior's guitar are fully functional – none of his scenes were rendered in CGI.|$|E
25|$|Scrooge has a nasty {{temper and}} rarely hesitates to use cartoon {{violence}} {{against those who}} provoke his ire (often his nephew Donald, but also bill and tax collectors as well as door-to-door salesmen); however, {{he seems to be}} against the use of lethal force. On occasion, he has even saved the lives of enemies who had threatened his own life but were in danger of losing their own. According to Scrooge's own explanation, this is to save himself from <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> over their deaths; he generally awaits no gratitude from them. Scrooge has also opined that only in fairy tales do bad people turn good, and that he is old enough to not believe in fairy tales. Scrooge believes in keeping his word—never breaking a promise once given. In Italian-produced stories of the 1950s to 1970s, however, particularly those written by Guido Martina, Scrooge often acts differently from in American or Danish comics productions.|$|E
25|$|The Jerusalem Talmud (Shevi'it 6:1) relates {{how that}} Rabbi Phinehas ben Jair, a priest of Aaron’s lineage, {{and others with}} him, used to go down into the {{marketplace}} of the Saracens in Ashkelon to buy wheat during the Seventh Year, and return to their own city, and immerse themselves in order to eat their bread (Terumah) {{in a state of}} ritual purity. The Beth-Din of Rabbi Ishmael ben Jose and Ben HaKapar, when they heard about what Rabbi Phinehas ben Jair had done, a most pious man on all other accounts, but who went down into Ashkelon when it was not permitted for priests to venture outside the Land of Israel, understood thereby that Ashkelon – though not conquered by those returning from the Babylonian exile – was not like other lands of the gentiles, and that defilement had not been decreed upon that city. Therefore, taking as an exemplum the act they heard performed by Rabbi Phinehas ben Jair, they assembled themselves and reverted the old practice, decreeing a state of cleanness over the city’s air, and that, henceforth, Jews (including those of the priestly stock) were permitted to go into the city without harboring <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> or fear of contracting uncleanness.|$|E
