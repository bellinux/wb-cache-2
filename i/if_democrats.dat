500|$|Practical {{differences}} between the candidates were few, and Republicans began the campaign with the familiar theme of waving the bloody shirt: reminding Northern voters that the Democratic Party was responsible for secession and four years of civil war, and that <b>if</b> <b>Democrats</b> held power they would reverse the gains of that war, dishonor Union veterans, and pay Confederate veterans pensions out of the federal treasury. With fifteen years having passed {{since the end of}} the war, and Union generals at the head of both tickets, the bloody shirt was of diminishing value in exciting the voters. With a few months to go before the election, the Republicans switched tactics to emphasize the tariff. Seizing on the Democratic platform's call for a [...] "tariff for revenue only", Republicans told Northern workers that a Hancock presidency would weaken the tariff protection that kept them in good jobs. Hancock made the situation worse when, attempting to strike a moderate stance, he said, [...] "The tariff question is a local question." [...] The ploy proved effective in uniting the North behind Garfield. In the end, fewer than two thousand votes, of the more than 9.2 million popular votes cast, separated the two candidates, but in the Electoral College Garfield had an easy victory over Hancock, 214 to 155.|$|E

5000|$|During his 2010 campaign, Shuler showed {{interest}} {{in taking the}} place of Nancy Pelosi as Speaker of the House, <b>if</b> <b>Democrats</b> maintained their majority.

Two other Republican Senators, Mark Kirk of Illinois and Susan Collins of Maine, have expressed their support for hearings and an up-or-down vote on Garland, with Collins also supporting Garland's nomination.

5000|$|The Two Santa Claus Theory is a {{political}} theory and strategy published by Wanniski in 1976, which he promoted within the United States Republican Party. The theory states that in democratic elections, <b>if</b> <b>Democrats</b> appeal to voters by proposing programs to help people, then the Republicans cannot gain broader appeal by proposing less spending. The first [...] "Santa Claus" [...] of the theory title refers to the Democrats who promises programs to help the disadvantaged.

5000|$|Conway portrayed Northup as an {{ineffective}} legislator {{who would}} not protect Social Security and healthcare benefits. Northup countered that, at 33 years old, Conway lacked experience, and said not being married had deprived him of [...] "a responsibility to somebody else". She attacked Conway for his ties to Governor Patton, who had become embroiled in a sex-for-favors scandal. Northup's campaign raised and spent almost twice {{as much money as}} Conway's - aided by fundraisers featuring President George W. Bush (twice) and Vice President Dick Cheney - allowing her to run more television ads on the district's four network television stations. Conway countered with a rally at the headquarters of the local chapter of the United Auto Workers - who gave him their endorsement - featuring then-Democratic House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt. Gephardt promised if Conway were elected and <b>if</b> <b>Democrats</b> gained control of the House, that he would appoint Conway to the powerful Appropriations Committee, of which Northup was then a member. In the November 5 general election, Northup defeated Conway with 51.6% of the vote to Conway's 48.4%. Patton later told the Lexington Herald-Leader that he thought the scandal in his administration cost Democrats several legislative races, including Conway.|$|E

40|$|The lecture was {{delivered}} on 19 February 2014 (written version August 2014). Starting {{in the early}} 1990 s, Republican and Democratic elites and legislators moved toward polar opposite stands on environmental and global warming issues, yet rank-and-file voters remained less divided and more open to environmental protections. In 2006, when {{it looked as if}} most of the public might support government action to deal with global warming, right-wing media moguls and free-market advocates mounted a successful campaign to convince rank and file conservatives that climate science is a hoax and new regulations would hurt the economy. By 2007, pressures from below and outside Washington made compromise impossible for GOPers. Oblivious to this shift, supporters of cap and trade kept trying to strike bargains with business leaders and Senate Republicans. They failed to build support across the country, and presented an anemic message that did nothing to counter worries that new carbon caps could leave families paying higher energy prices from shrinking incomes. Most supporters of carbon capping recognize that the post- 2010 Congress will not act as long as Republicans wary of challenges from the right remain in charge. But what happens when another opening comes – for example, <b>if</b> <b>Democrats</b> take control in 2016 or 2018 ? To be prepared when the next opening arises in Congress, organizational efforts must reach far beyond the Beltway – to knit together alliances and inspire tens of millions of ordinary Americans to push for change...|$|E

5000|$|The {{plan was}} {{originally}} {{proposed by the}} Republican National Committee {{in the spring of}} 2000, to take effect in the 2004 campaign. However, it was voted down by the general convention that summer. [...] There was some opposition from Iowa delegates, as Iowa would not have been in the first group. More significantly, Republican leaders worried that, if they acted unilaterally, that they would be handing a huge advantage to the <b>Democrats.</b> <b>If</b> the Republicans did indeed use this plan, it would be almost impossible to know who the GOP nominee would be until early or mid-June. But <b>if</b> the <b>Democrats</b> maintained their primary schedule unchanged, then the identity of the Democratic nominee might well be clear in March.
