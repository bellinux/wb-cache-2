25|$|The Boeing EC-135 was {{a command}} and control version of the Boeing C-135 Stratolifter. During the Cold War, the EC-135 was best known for being {{modified}} to perform the Looking Glass mission where one EC-135 was always airborne 24 {{hours a day to}} serve as flying command post for the Strategic Air Command in the event of nuclear war. Various other EC-135 aircraft sat on airborne and <b>ground</b> <b>alert</b> throughout the Cold War, with the last EC-135C being retired in 1998. The EC-135N variant served as a tracking aircraft for the Apollo program.|$|E

50|$|On July 26, 2005, VMFA(AW)-332 {{departed}} MCAS Beaufort for its combat deployment {{in support}} of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF). 332 regularly flew a twelve-sortie Air Tasking Order cycle with intermittent surge days and <b>ground</b> <b>alerts.</b> Typical missions included close air support (CAS), Armed Reconnaissance (AR), Infrastructure Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), Advanced Tactical Airborne Reconnaissance System (ATARS) and Convoy Escort. These missions were conducted on a daily basis, during both day and night, {{in support of}} Marine, Army, and various Joint Special Operations units. The most common tasking from these ground units required use of the LITENING Pod to identify, monitor, and report any activity {{in the vicinity of}} historical insurgent mortar and rocket Points of Origin (POO) sites. Most of these POO sites were in the vicinity of Forward Operating Bases (FOBs) and coalition airfields throughout Al Anbar province.|$|R
500|$|The {{barn owl}} is a bird of open country such as {{farmland}} or grassland with some interspersed woodland, usually at altitudes below [...] but occasionally {{as high as}} [...] in the tropics. This owl prefers to hunt {{along the edges of}} woods or in rough grass strips adjoining pasture. It has an effortless wavering flight as it quarters the <b>ground,</b> <b>alert</b> to the sounds made by potential prey. Like most owls, the barn owl flies silently; tiny serrations on the leading edges of its flight feathers and a hairlike fringe to the trailing edges help to break up the flow of air over the wings, thereby reducing turbulence and the noise that accompanies it. Hairlike extensions to the barbules of its feathers, which give the plumage a soft feel, also minimise noise produced during wingbeats. The behaviour and ecological preferences may differ slightly even among neighbouring subspecies, as shown {{in the case of the}} European T. a. guttata and [...] T. a. alba that probably evolved, respectively, in allopatric glacial refugia in southeastern Europe, and in Iberia or southern France.|$|E
2500|$|The 4th ACCS was the {{workhorse}} of ALCS operations. Three dedicated Airborne Launch Control Centers (ALCC) were on <b>ground</b> <b>alert</b> around-the-clock providing ALCS {{coverage for}} {{five of the}} six Minuteman ICBM Wings. These dedicated ALCCs were mostly EC-135A aircraft but could also have been EC-135C or EC-135G aircraft depending on availability. ALCC No. 1 was on <b>ground</b> <b>alert</b> at Ellsworth AFB, SD and during a wartime scenario would have taken off and orbited between the Minuteman Wings at Ellsworth AFB, SD and F.E. Warren AFB, WY providing ALCS assistance if needed. ALCCs No. 2 and No. 3 were routinely on forward deployed <b>ground</b> <b>alert</b> at Minot AFB, ND. During a wartime scenario, ALCC No. 3 would have orbited between the Minuteman ICBM Wings at Minot AFB and Grand Forks AFB, both in North Dakota, providing ALCS assistance if needed. ALCC No. 2 was dedicated to orbiting near the Minuteman ICBM Wing at Malmstrom AFB, MT providing ALCS assistance if needed. The 4th ACCS also maintained an EC-135C or EC-135G on <b>ground</b> <b>alert</b> at Ellsworth AFB, SD as the West Auxiliary Airborne Command Post (WESTAUXCP) as a backup to SAC’s [...] "Looking Glass" [...] Airborne Command Post (ABNCP) as well as a radio relay link between the Looking Glass and ALCCs when airborne. Although equipped with ALCS, the WESTAUXCP did not have a dedicated Minuteman ICBM wing to provide ALCS assistance to.|$|E

50|$|TOWS is {{designed}} to sound a warning for numerous other dangerous errors in the take-off configuration, such as the flaps and slats not being extended when the throttles are opened while the aircraft is on the <b>ground.</b> The <b>alert</b> is typically {{in the form of}} an audible warning horn accompanied by a voice message that indicates the nature of the configuration error.|$|R
2500|$|The {{division}} {{was formed to}} command four strategic wings that were formed in the Southeastern United States as part of SAC's program to disperse its B-52 force to minimize attrition from a possible Soviet first strike. [...] Once the division's wings were organized and equipped, they maintained {{a portion of their}} aircraft on airborne and <b>ground</b> <b>alert.</b> [...] During the Cuban Missile Crisis, all combat aircraft of the division were placed on increased alert status. [...] In addition to its SAC mission, the division's wing at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida was involved in testing armament for the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress.|$|E
2500|$|On 20 October 1962, at {{the start}} of the Cuban Missile Crisis, each of the division's wings were {{directed}} to put two additional B-52s on alert. [...] Two days later 1/8 of the B-52s were placed on airborne alert. [...] Additional division KC-135s were placed on alert to replace KC-135s devoted to maintaining the increased B-52 bomber force on airborne alert. [...] On 24 October SAC went to DEFCON 2, placing all aircraft on alert. [...] This posture was maintained until 21 November, when SAC returned to its normal airborne alert status and assumed DEFCON 3, but the 822d maintained an increased number of bombers and tankers on <b>ground</b> <b>alert</b> for another week.|$|E
2500|$|Cold War {{tensions}} between the United States and Russia {{came to a head}} in October 1962. [...] President John F. Kennedy informed the American public that the Soviet Union had installed missile sites in Cuba from which it could strike the United States. As a result, SAC canceled flying training and increased the size of its ground and airborne alert forces. The wing launched four B-52s on Chrome Dome and Hard Head VI missions, established the Loring Tanker Task Force, and aircraft not supporting airborne alert were put on <b>ground</b> <b>alert.</b> [...] During the Cuban Missile Crisis, wing bombers flew 132 airborne alert missions and its tankers flew 214 air refueling missions, transferring almost 24 million pounds of fuel to the B-52s.|$|E
5000|$|EC-135 Looking Glass {{aircraft}} were airborne 24 {{hours a day}} {{for over}} 29 years, until July 24, 1990, when [...] "The Glass" [...] ceased continuous airborne alert, but remained on <b>ground</b> or airborne <b>alert</b> 24 hours a day.|$|R

2500|$|The 4133d wing was {{established}} by SAC in a program to disperse its Boeing B-52 Stratofortress bombers over {{a larger number of}} bases, thus making it more difficult for the Soviet Union to knock out the entire fleet with a surprise first strike. [...] Half of the wing's aircraft were maintained on fifteen-minute alert, fully fueled and ready for combat. [...] The 4133d (and later the 319th) continued to maintain an alert commitment {{until the end of the}} Cold War. [...] The 905th also refueled B-52s participating in Operation Chrome Dome, the airborne component of SAC's alert force until Chrome Dome was terminated in 1968. [...] The squadron's <b>ground</b> <b>alert</b> commitment was increased in the fall of 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis, when all available aircraft assumed an alert status.|$|E
2500|$|The 2nd ACCS {{was another}} {{major player in}} ALCS operations. The primary mission of the 2nd ACCS was to fly the SAC ABNCP [...] "Looking Glass" [...] {{aircraft}} in continuous airborne operations. However, due to its proximity in orbiting over the central United States, the airborne Looking Glass provided ALCS coverage for the Minuteman ICBM Wing located at Whiteman AFB, MO. Not only did Whiteman AFB have Minuteman II ICBMs, but it also had ERCS configured Minuteman missiles on alert. The 2nd ACCS also had an additional EC-135C on <b>ground</b> <b>alert</b> at Offutt AFB, NE as the EASTAUXCP, providing backup to the airborne Looking Glass, radio relay capability, and a means for the Commander in Chief of SAC to escape an enemy nuclear attack. Although the EASTAUXCP was ALCS capable, {{it did not have}} a dedicated ALCS mission.|$|E
2500|$|From 1958, the Boeing B-47 Stratojet {{wings of}} Strategic Air Command (SAC) began to assume an alert posture {{at their home}} bases, {{reducing}} {{the amount of time spent}} on alert at overseas bases. The SAC alert cycle divided itself into four parts: planning, flying, alert and rest to meet General Thomas S. Power’s initial goal of maintaining one third of SAC’s planes on fifteen minute <b>ground</b> <b>alert,</b> fully fueled and ready for combat to reduce vulnerability to a Soviet missile strike. [...] To implement this new system B-47 wings reorganized from three to four squadrons. [...] The 427th was activated at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base as the fourth squadron of the 303d Bombardment Wing. [...] The alert commintment was increased to half the wing's aircraft in 1962 and the four squadron pattern no longer met the alert cycle commitment, so the squadron was inactivated on 1 January 1962.|$|E

2500|$|The {{missions}} {{most directly}} associated with USSTRATCOM and its predecessors are deterrence and global strike. These were the missions of Strategic Air Command (SAC) from 1946 to 1992 {{and of the}} first USSTRATCOM from 1992 to 2002. SAC was created in March 1946 as one of three major commands of the U.S. Army Air Forces and became a major command of the U.S. Air Force in September 1947. As a specified combatant command, it was also charged with conducting long-range strike operations {{under the direction of}} the Joint Chiefs of Staff. SAC's second commander, Gen. Curtis E. LeMay, built it into a combat-ready force with a peak strength in the late 1950s and early 1960s of 3,200 aircraft and 280,000 people. In the 1960s, aircraft strength dropped, offset by a force of 1,054 intercontinental ballistic missiles. To deter attack, the command kept these missiles and a sizable proportion of its bombers and tankers on alert, ready to launch within minutes. To assure command and control, in February 1961 EC-135, [...] "Looking Glass" [...] airborne command posts began round-the-clock flight operations that continued until July 1990.

2500|$|McNamara took {{other steps}} to {{increase}} U.S. deterrence posture and military capabilities. He raised {{the proportion of}} Strategic Air Command (SAC) strategic bombers on 15-minute <b>ground</b> <b>alert</b> from 25% to 50%, thus lessening their vulnerability to missile attack. In December 1961, he established the United States Strike Command (STRICOM). Authorized to draw forces when needed from the Strategic Army Corps (STRAC), the Tactical Air Command, and the airlift units of the Military Air Transport Service and the military services, Strike Command had the mission [...] "to respond swiftly and with whatever force necessary to threats against the peace {{in any part of}} the world, reinforcing unified commands or... carrying out separate contingency operations." [...] McNamara also increased long-range airlift and sealift capabilities and funds for space research and development. After reviewing the separate and often uncoordinated service efforts in intelligence and communications, McNamara in 1961 consolidated these functions in the Defense Intelligence Agency and the Defense Communications Agency (the latter originally established by Secretary Gates in 1960), having both report to the secretary of defense through the JCS. The end effect was to remove the Intelligence function from the control of the military and to put it {{under the control of the}} Secretary of Defense. In the same year, he set up the Defense Supply Agency to work toward unified supply procurement, distribution, and inventory management under the control of the Secretary of Defense rather than the uniformed military.|$|E
