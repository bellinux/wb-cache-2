40|$|The {{conventional}} {{meaning of}} <b>extension</b> has been changing to accommodate challenges presented {{by changes in}} <b>extension</b> policies and dwindling <b>extension</b> resources. Staffing rationalization programs have led to drastic reductions in number of <b>extension</b> staff. Financial resources for <b>extension</b> have dwindled to halting levels. The emerging trend is that institutional arrangements for <b>extension</b> services are being founded on facilitation, participatory and local capacity building principles. The challenge at hand is how to integrate responsibility of <b>extension</b> staff into community-driven <b>extension</b> approaches; yet the staff are accustomed to top-down <b>extension</b> service.
