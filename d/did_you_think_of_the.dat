Director Charles McDougall {{reported}} seeing around 150 [...] "very good and determined women" [...] audition {{for the four}} leads. Eva Longoria was the first actor cast in a lead role, landing the role of Gabrielle Solis, a materialistic ex-model, after two auditions. Longoria, an unknown soap opera actress at the time, stated that prior to her audition, she had not read the entire script. She recounted, [...] "Marc Cherry asks, 'So what <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> script?' like the whole thing. And I said, 'Well I didn’t read the script. I only read my part.' And Marc Cherry goes, 'I knew you were Gabrielle at that moment because {{it was such a}} Gabrielle thing to say.'" [...] Roselyn Sánchez also auditioned for the role. Teri Hatcher was cast in the role of Susan Mayer, a single mother looking for love, after a second audition for ABC network executives. Cherry commended Hatcher's audition, calling it [...] "the best audition I've ever seen in network [...]" [...] Actors originally considered for the role include Courteney Cox, Calista Flockhart, Mary-Louise Parker, and Sela Ward. Julia Louis-Dreyfus also expressed interest in the role, but network executives felt she was not right for the part.|$|E

6000|$|At times, of course, {{the barber}} prefers {{to test his}} {{customer}} with a question or two. He gets him pinned in the chair, with his head well back, covers the customer's face with soap, and then planting his knee {{on his chest and}} holding his hand firmly across the customer's mouth, to prevent all utterance and to force him to swallow the soap, he asks: [...] "Well, what <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Detroit-St. Louis game yesterday?" [...] This is not really meant for a question at all. It is only equivalent to saying: [...] "Now, you poor fool, I'll bet you don't know anything about the great events of your country at all." [...] There is a gurgle in the customer's throat {{as if he were trying}} to answer, and his eyes are seen to move sideways, but the barber merely thrusts the soap-brush into each eye, and if any motion still persists, he breathes gin and peppermint over the face, till all sign of life is extinct. Then he talks the game over in detail with the barber at the next chair, each leaning across an inanimate thing extended under steaming towels that was once a man.|$|E

'Why, you oughtn't {{to think}} I needed any {{improvement}} at all, sir,' Edie answered, pouting; 'and as to talking, I'm not aware I had ever any dearth of subjects for conversation even before I {{went on the}} Continent. There are things enough {{to be said about}} heaven and earth in England, surely, without one having to hurry through France and Italy, like Cook's excursionists, just to hunt up something fresh to chatter about. It's my belief that a person who can't find anything new to say about the every-day world around her won't discover much suggestive matter for conversation in a Continental Bradshaw. It's like that feeble watery lady I met at the table d'hote at Geneva. From something she said I gathered she'd been in India, and I asked her how she liked it. [...] "Oh," [...] she said, [...] "it's very hot." [...] I told her I had heard so before. Presently she said something casually about having been in Brazil. I asked her what sort of place Brazil was. [...] "Oh." [...] she said, [...] "it's dreadfully hot." [...] I told her I'd heard that too. By-and-by she began to talk again about Barbadoes. [...] "What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> West Indies?" [...] I said. [...] "Oh," [...] said she, [...] "they're terribly hot, really."

40|$|The {{setting for}} the {{dialogue}} is a rolling lawn {{on the campus of}} a small liberal-arts college in Arcádia, a prosperous, peaceful (and, alas, fictional) small town in upstate Rio de Janeiro. Lycidas, a young professor of English-language literature, recently read Stanley Fish’s article, published in Brazil in the first issue of paLavra. 2 So enthusiastic was he that he talked his colleague Melibœus, a notoriously skeptical middle-aged professor of Brazilian literature, into reading it too. LYC. Well, then, Melibœus? What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> article? MEL. I must say I enjoyed it a lot. These Americans have a wonderful sense of humor.

40|$|When {{we make a}} {{definite}} reference to a thing, we normally {{make sure that our}} audience "shares" with us certain knowledge about that thing. To refer to a woman as she, the woman, or Nancy, we usually have good evidence that our audience knows about her too. But exactly what "shared " knowledge is required? This question is critical if we are ever to discover how people make or interpret definite reference [...] how they represent knowledge in memory and consult it in uttering and interpreting expressions like she, the woman, or Nancy. The question is critical if we are ever to characterize the mental archive people have for storing the facts they need to know for definite reference. We will argue that this archive has to be another detailed diary, or reference diary, supplemented by atlases, histories, and certain other reference texts. To make this argument, and to see what goes into the archive, we will examine the prior question, What "shared " knowledge is required for definite reference? As it happens, this question leads directly to a puzzle we will call the mutual knowledge paradox. It is in the solution of this puzzle that we get our best clues as to what the reference diary must be like. The Mutual Knowledge Paradox Imagine that there is a Marx brothers retrospective on at the local theater for which there are two or three movies a night for several evenings. Against this background consider the following scenario: Version i. On Wednesday night Ann and Bob go to see Monkey Business. The next morning Ann meets Bob and asks, "What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> movie?" What we are interested in is Ann's definite reference the movie, which she intends to refer to Monkey Business. What facts does Ann have to assure herself of before she can felicitously make this reference? Our interest here is in only those facts that are involved in "shared " knowledge. As a first condition, for example, Ann must herself have a certain awareness of Monkey Business. For now we will express that awareness as "knowing about R " (where R stands for the referent Monkey Business). Thus one fact Ann must assure herself of is this: (i) Ann knows about R. But is this enough? Of course not, for (i) provides no assurance that Bob knows about Monkey Business. The way it fails can be made clear in a variation on the original scenario that goes like this...|$|E
