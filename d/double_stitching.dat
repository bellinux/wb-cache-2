25|$|The Lapels: Neapolitan jackets {{are famous}} for their wide lapels, which oftentimes are peaked (“a punta”) for {{double-breasted}} jackets, formal jackets, and coats. The “risvolto dentellato” (the “classic” style of lapels – not peaked) are notoriously wider in Neapolitan jackets: they can be as wide as 4 inches, compared to the 3 inches of a regular lapel width). Just {{as is the case}} for the pockets, the Neapolitan lapel features <b>double</b> <b>stitching</b> running along the sides – a stunning detail that’s peculiar of a Neapolitan creation – although reserved for the less formal pieces. The “scollo a martiello” (literally “hammer neck”) is the opening of the jacket over the shirt, which in Neapolitan tailoring is perfectly parallel to the lapels. The cran is the space that separates the lapel and the neck, and it is usually higher in Neapolitan tailoring to create the illusion of a more slender figure.|$|E

50|$|To {{create a}} picot in tatting, {{the first half}} of a <b>double</b> <b>stitch</b> is made. However, instead of pulling that half-stitch taut against the stitch before it, the half-stitch is pinched against the {{foundation}} thread and held some distance from the stitch before it. The distance at which the half-stitch is held indicates the final size of the picot. The second half of the stitch is formed, and this stitch is slid down the foundation thread and into place next to the stitch before it. The resulting picot is then anchored between two <b>double</b> <b>stitches.</b> It is also possible to anchor the picot between the two halves of a full <b>double</b> <b>stitch.</b>|$|R

40|$|To bond the {{two layers}} in double fabrics, {{various types of}} {{stitching}} can be distinguished such as self-stitching, <b>double</b> <b>stitching,</b> center warp stitching, center weft stitching, and so on. In this article, a mathematic model based on a software program has been developed to automatically generate a double fabric stitched by additional warp called center warp. Each layer has been represented in a 2 D binary matrix, and a new matrix called warps order matrix has been defined to demonstrate the modality of position of the center warps in relating {{to the top and}} bottom fabrics’ warps. After insertion of all warps in the extended weave matrix, the lifter conditions has been discussed and the stitching points have been determined...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a research of women clothing style, pattern design, and fabric by developing origami culture and double faced jacquard weaving. Four kinds of clothing styles are researched by folding fabric according some origami concept. Based on the developed folded garment structures, some positioned patterns are studied for modern advanced fashion design purposes. In the technology aspect, jacquard technology {{is used in}} this study. Jacquard technology uses <b>double</b> <b>stitching</b> structure which face and back patterns are not the same. The face fabric is colorful with pure silk while the back fabric is composite of twill and eight weft satin pattern with silk and cashmere yarn. The final example {{presents a}} combination creation of garment and fabric. The method and design {{of this type of}} creation requires a high integration of aesthetic and technical aspects, therefore a high added value would be achieved...|$|E

50|$|The main {{modification}} {{that separated}} the R3 from the GTi was its <b>double</b> <b>stitch</b> welded chassis, which meant the car was welded twice for increased structural rigidity, aided by the inclusion of front and rear suspension strut braces. The R3 was also stripped of its sound-deadening material and driver's airbag, which helped bring the weight down to just 995 kg. Suspension improvements included uprated springs and dampers, thicker anti-roll bars and lower ride height.|$|R

5000|$|Any granny square {{begins with}} a small loop of chain stitches. Basic granny squares {{alternate}} sets of <b>double</b> <b>stitches</b> and chain stitches. Variant patterns use different stitch types or produce other geometric shapes such as hexagons. In order to achieve a distinct angle at the corners the designer uses extra chain stitches. [...] Subsequent rounds are added by wrapping multiple stitches around the existing chain stitches. Hundreds of variant motifs are in use and entire books have been devoted to granny square designs.|$|R
50|$|Filet crochet is {{most often}} worked from a graph or a symbol diagram. Patterns are created by {{combining}} solid and open meshes, usually working the design in solid meshes and the background in open meshes. The size of the space {{is determined by the}} number of chain <b>stitches</b> between each <b>double</b> <b>stitch.</b> Filet crochet may also be worked by alternating chain stitches with another type of crochet stitch such as (U.S. terminology) half double or triple crochet, and may be worked from yarn instead of thread.|$|R
5000|$|Filet crochet {{is a type}} of crocheted fabric. This type of {{crocheted lace}} is gridlike because it uses only two crochet stitches: the chain <b>stitch</b> and the <b>double</b> crochet <b>stitch</b> (U.S. terminology; known in some other {{countries}} as chain stitch and treble). Old filet patterns used a treble or triple stitch vertically but chained two between the vertical stitches. This was to prevent distortion of some patterns. Chain stitches use less yarn than <b>double</b> crochet <b>stitches,</b> which results in a visual difference in appearance between the two kinds of stitch. Filet crochet forms patterns by filling in parts of a mostly chain <b>stitch</b> mesh with <b>double</b> crochet <b>stitches.</b> [...] Filet crochet is usually constructed from monotone crochet thread made of Mercerised cotton in white or ecru, and worked in rows. Filet crochet is used for decorative applications such as window curtains, tablecloths, and place settings such as coasters and placemats.|$|R
5000|$|Tatting is a {{technique}} for handcrafting a particularly durable lace {{from a series of}} knots and loops.

The lace is formed by a pattern of rings and chains formed from a series of cow hitch or half-hitch knots, called <b>double</b> <b>stitches,</b> over a core thread. Gaps can be left between the stitches to form picots, which are used for practical construction as well as decorative effect.|$|R
