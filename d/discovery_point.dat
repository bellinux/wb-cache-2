25|$|On 28 March 1986, Discovery left London {{aboard the}} cargo ship Happy Mariner {{to make her}} journey home to the city that built her. She arrived on the River Tay on 3 April. Moved to a custom built dock in 1992, Discovery is now the centrepiece of Dundee's visitor {{attraction}} <b>Discovery</b> <b>Point.</b> She is displayed in a purpose-built dock, in a configuration as near as possible to her 1924 state, when she was refitted in the Vosper yard at Portsmouth. She is listed {{as part of the}} National Historic Fleet. <b>Discovery</b> <b>Point</b> is a fully accredited museum and has won numerous national awards, as well as being a 5 star rated tourist attraction with Visit Scotland. In 2008, Discovery and the associated polar collections were named as a Recognised Collection of National Significance.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1990s, the <b>Discovery</b> <b>Point</b> {{museum has}} {{concentrated}} on interpreting the vessel {{on all of}} her voyages, with personal items from the ship's crew {{as well as information}} on her scientific activities. Items range from the games played by the crew on her first expedition to examples of sea fauna. Star objects on display including Captain Scott's rifle and pipe. Her three main voyages, the National Antarctic Expedition (1901–1904), the Discovery Oceanographic Expedition (1925–1927) and the BANZARE expedition (1929–31), are all explored in the museum through film and photographic evidence with artefacts from each era represented. The museum also holds other pieces from Scott's subsequent Terra Nova expedition and Shackleton's Endurance expedition.|$|E
2500|$|The rise of {{the textile}} {{industries}} brought with it an expansion of supporting industries, notably of the whaling, maritime and shipbuilding industries, and extensive development of the waterfront area started in 1815 to cope with increased demand for port capacity. At its height, 200 ships per year were built there, including Robert Falcon Scott's Antarctic research vessel, the [...] This ship is now on display at <b>Discovery</b> <b>Point</b> in the city. A significant whaling industry was also based in Dundee, largely existing to supply the jute mills with whale oil. Whaling ceased in 1912 and shipbuilding ceased in 1981.|$|E

2500|$|Today, Dundee is {{promoted}} as [...] "One City, Many Discoveries" [...] {{in honour of}} Dundee's history of scientific activities and of the RRS Discovery, Robert Falcon Scott's Antarctic exploration vessel, which was built in Dundee and is now berthed at <b>Discovery</b> <b>Point.</b> Biomedical and technological industries have arrived since the 1980s, and the city now accounts for 10% of the United Kingdom's digital-entertainment industry. Dundee has two universities — the University of Dundee and the Abertay University. In 2014 Dundee was recognised by the United Nations as the UK's first UNESCO City of Design for its diverse contributions to fields including medical research, comics and video games.|$|E

2500|$|A trio of gold prospectors: John Wesley Hillman, Henry Klippel, and Isaac Skeeters {{were the}} first white people to visit the lake. On June 12, 1853, they {{stumbled}} upon the long, sloping mountain while hunting for provisions. Stunned by vibrant blue color of the lake, they named the indigo body of water [...] "Deep Blue Lake" [...] and the place on the southwest side of the rim where he first saw the lake later became known as <b>Discovery</b> <b>Point.</b> [...] But gold was more {{on the minds of}} settlers at the time and the discovery was soon forgotten.

2500|$|Heading {{northwest}} {{from the}} Crater Lake National Park {{headquarters in the}} Munson Valley Historic District, it is three miles (5km) to Crater Lake rim and the Rim Village visitor area {{which is also a}} historic district.

[...] Leaving Rim Village, the speed limit is reduced to [...] [...] Visitors reach the <b>Discovery</b> <b>Point</b> viewing area in just over one mile (1.6km). [...] From there, it is five miles (8km) to the junction with the North Entrance Road. [...] Between these two way points visitors pass over the [...] West Rim Summit. [...] The section of Rim Drive between Rim Village and the North Entrance Road is known as West Rim Drive. [...] This part of the road is used heavily during the summer because it is the direct route between the park’s north and south entrances and passes by the Rim Village visitor area and the park headquarters at Munson Valley. [...] It also offers classic views of Crater Lake and Wizard Island along the way.|$|E

50|$|The game {{presents}} the player {{with a large}} part of the Harry Potter universe, combining the movie blueprints, J.K. Rowling's drawings and books' descriptions to recreate known places, including the Ministry of Magic, Grimmauld Place and Little Whinging. As well as the main missions, and as part of the new sandbox style of playing, players can explore Hogwarts and interact with objects, using magical spells to earn <b>Discovery</b> <b>points.</b> One can duel Slytherins in the Entrance Courtyard, Paved Courtyard, and specific floor corridors. One can also duel throughout the story. Most of them are played as Harry. Nevertheless, near the end, one will play as Sirius Black and Dumbledore in different duels. Earning <b>Discovery</b> <b>points</b> increases the power of the owned spells, and earns player bonuses, such as behind-the-scenes videos and trophies, which can be viewed in the Room of Rewards. Items in the room such as trophies can also be unlocked by taking part in the various mini games, such as Exploding Snap, Wizard chess and Gobstones. There are various missions to complete which follow the storyline of the film, such as the recruiting of Dumbledore's Army members, or creating havoc when Umbridge is made Headmistress.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Change <b>point</b> <b>discovery</b> is an {{important}} problem in data mining and industrial systems. Different approaches have been proposed {{and some of the}} most promising approaches are based on singular spectrum analysis (SSA). These algorithms have the advantages of requiring no ad-hoc tuning for different types of signals and having a built-in noise attenuation mechanism. In this paper we try to unify these approaches and present a novel method for comparing change <b>point</b> <b>discovery</b> algorithms. We then use the proposed method to compare different SSA based change <b>point</b> <b>discovery</b> algorithms. Even though we focused on comparing only SSA based algorithms, the proposed metric applicable to any kind of change <b>point</b> <b>discovery</b> algorithm and have the advantages of requiring no localization steps, and being independent of any predefined thresholds (unlike traditional metrics).

As reported in this issue of Cancer Cell, Szakács et al. couple quantitative, real-time PCR assays for all 48 human ABC transporters with chemosensitivity information mined from the NCI- 60 cancer cell line database. Predictions of transporter involvement in drug effect were validated in selected cases, and furthermore produced novel leads relating ABC transporter expression and chemoresistance or chemosensitivity...|$|R

This review examines {{the role of the}} reticular activating system, especially the pedunculopontine nucleus, in the symptoms of insomnia, mainly representing an overactive waking drive. We determined that high frequency activity during waking and REM sleep is controlled by two different intracellular pathways and channel types in PPN cells. We found three different PPN cell types that have one or both channels and may be active during waking only, REM sleep only, or both. These <b>discoveries</b> <b>point</b> to a specific mechanism and novel therapeutic avenues for insomnia...|$|R

25|$|In 2001, archaeologists {{studying}} {{the remains of}} two men from Mehrgarh, Pakistan, discovered {{that the people of}} the Indus Valley Civilisation, from the early Harappan periods, had knowledge of proto-dentistry. Later, in April 2006, it was announced in the scientific journal Nature that the oldest (and first early Neolithic) evidence for the drilling of human teeth in vivo (i.e., in a living person) was found in Mehrgarh. Eleven drilled molar crowns from nine adults were discovered in a Neolithic graveyard in Mehrgarh that dates from 7,500–9,000 years ago. According to the authors, their <b>discoveries</b> <b>point</b> to a tradition of proto-dentistry in the early farming cultures of that region.|$|R
