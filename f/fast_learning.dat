50|$|There are {{two basic}} methods of {{training}} ART-based neural networks: slow and fast. In the slow learning method, the degree of training of the recognition neuron’s weights towards the input vector is calculated to continuous values with differential equations and is thus dependent {{on the length of}} time the input vector is presented. With <b>fast</b> <b>learning,</b> algebraic equations are used to calculate degree of weight adjustments to be made, and binary values are used. While <b>fast</b> <b>learning</b> is effective and efficient for a variety of tasks, the slow learning method is more biologically plausible and can be used with continuous-time networks (i.e. when the input vector can vary continuously).|$|E
