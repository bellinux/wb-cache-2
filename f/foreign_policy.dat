5|$|Kennan {{found it}} {{difficult}} to perform his job in Belgrade. President Josip Broz Tito and his foreign minister, Koča Popović, began to suspect that Kennedy would adopt an anti-Yugoslav policy during his term. Tito and Popović considered Kennedy's decision to observe Captive Nations Week as an indication that the United States would assist anticommunist liberation efforts in Yugoslavia. Tito also believed that the CIA and the Pentagon were the true directors of American <b>foreign</b> <b>policy.</b> Kennan attempted to restore Tito's confidence in the American <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> establishment but his efforts were compromised by a pair of diplomatic blunders, the Bay of Pigs Invasion, and the U-2 spy incident.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after, the {{religious}} reformers (and protégés of Cromwell) Robert Barnes, William Jerome and Thomas Garret were burned as heretics. Cromwell, meanwhile, {{fell out of}} favour although it is unclear exactly why, for {{there is little evidence}} of differences of domestic or <b>foreign</b> <b>policy.</b> Despite his role, he was never formally accused of being responsible for Henry's failed marriage. Cromwell was now surrounded by enemies at court, with Norfolk also able to draw on his niece's position. Cromwell was charged with treason, selling export licences, granting passports, and drawing up commissions without permission, and may also have been blamed for the failure of the <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> that accompanied the attempted marriage to Anne. He was subsequently attainted and beheaded.|$|E

5|$|After the {{demotion}} of Malenkov, Khrushchev and Molotov initially {{worked together}} well, and the longtime foreign minister even proposed that Khrushchev, not Bulganin, replace Malenkov as premier. However, Khrushchev and Molotov increasingly differed on policy. Molotov opposed the Virgin Lands policy, instead proposing heavy investment to increase yields in developed agricultural areas, which Khrushchev felt was not feasible {{due to a}} lack of resources and a lack of a sophisticated farm labor force. The two differed on <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> as well; soon after Khrushchev took power, he sought a peace treaty with Austria, which would allow Soviet troops then in occupation of part of the country to leave. Molotov was resistant, but Khrushchev arranged for an Austrian delegation to come to Moscow and negotiate the treaty. Although Khrushchev and other Presidium members attacked Molotov at a Central Committee meeting in mid-1955, accusing him of conducting a <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> which turned the world against the USSR, Molotov remained in his position.|$|E
