5|$|Groening {{thought that}} it would be <b>funny</b> <b>to</b> have a baby {{character}} that did not talk and never grew up, but was scripted to show any emotions that the scene required. Maggie's comedic hallmarks include her tendency to stumble and land on her face while attempting to walk, and a penchant for sucking on her pacifier, the sound of which has become the equivalent of her catchphrase and was originally created by Groening during the Tracey Ullman period. In the early seasons of the show, Maggie would suck her pacifier over other characters' dialogue, but this was discontinued because the producers found it too distracting.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Richard Appel and {{directed}} by Dominic Polcino. Appel was looking for new locales to put Bart and {{thought it would be}} <b>funny</b> <b>to</b> have him work at a burlesque house. The problem was {{to find a way to}} put such a house in Springfield, which was solved with the bit with the toy airplane. There were a dozen different possible names for the Burlesque house, some of which were raunchy.|$|E

Bart remarks that one cloud resembles Jebediah Springfield, but without a head. His new friends remark that they wish someone would decapitate the statue, saying it would be <b>funny</b> <b>to</b> see the town so upset. When Bart disagrees, the bullies make fun of him. Bart is {{conflicted}} and asks Homer whether it is okay to compromise one's beliefs to be popular. Homer tells Bart that popularity {{is the most important thing}} in the world, as long as Bart is not talking about killing someone. That night, Bart sneaks out of the house and decapitates the statue.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea for}} the rolling HP meter began with pachinko balls that would drop balls off the screen upon being hit. This did not work as well for {{characters}} with high health. Instead, around 1990, they chose an odometer-style hit points counter. The bicycle {{was one of the}} harder elements to implementâ€”it used controls similar to a tank before it was tweaked. Iwata felt that the Ape programmers were particularly willing to tackle such challenges. The programmers also found difficulty implementing the in-game delivery service, where the delivery person had to navigate around obstacles to reach the player. They thought it would be <b>funny</b> <b>to</b> have the delivery person run through obstacles in a hurry on his way off-screen. The unusual maps laid out with diagonal streets in oblique projection required extra attention from the artists. Itoi specifically chose against having an overworld map, and didn't want to artificially distinguish between towns and other areas. Instead, he worked to make each town unique. His own favorite town was Threed, though it was Summers before then.|$|E

500|$|Welles {{considered}} Falstaff to be [...] "Shakespeare's greatest creation" [...] {{and said}} that the role was [...] "the most difficult part I've ever played." [...] Keith Baxter believed that making the film was Welles's life's ambition. Before the 1939 Boston premiere of Five Kings, Welles told journalists [...] "I will play him as a tragic figure. I hope, of course, he will be <b>funny</b> <b>to</b> the audience, just as he was <b>funny</b> <b>to</b> those around him. But his humor and wit were aroused merely {{by the fact that he}} wanted to please the prince. Falstaff, however, had the potential of greatness in him." [...] Reviews for the 1939 play mention Welles' choice to downplay the traditional comedic elements of Falstaff in his performance. This reverence for the character increased over the years and by the time Welles made Chimes at Midnight, his focus was entirely on the relationships between Falstaff, Hal and Henry IV. He believed that the core of the story was [...] "the betrayal of friendship." [...] Welles called Hal's rejection of Falstaff [...] "one of the greatest scenes ever written, so the movie is really a preparation for it. Everything prepares for it." [...] Throughout the film, Hal constantly turns his back on Falstaff, foreshadowing the film's ending.|$|E
500|$|In two {{separate}} 2016 AMAs on Reddit, both Nick Jonas and Joe Jonas {{reflected on the}} episode. [...] "When it first came out I didn't think it was <b>funny</b> <b>to</b> be honest, but probably because I was actually living all of that in real time, so it just made it harder to come and live your life as a young person and have all that going on," [...] Nick said. [...] "But years later and once the purity rings were no longer around, it was very <b>funny</b> <b>to</b> me and I've actually watched the episode a few times." [...] "I loved it. When it first came out I was so pumped". Joe said. [...] "I know that Nick was really kind of not into watching it, but I {{thought it was the}} funniest thing at the time and it's kind of a compliment because obviously {{if you go to a}} comedy show and they pick you out and make fun of you, you can't heckle back, you gotta just take it and enjoy it, and for me I've always been a fan and I knew that was kind of a wow we made it moment, and also they were kind of attacking Disney more than me, so I didn't really feel threatened. Now I watch it back and laugh and Mickey kicked my ass so I won the episode by being beat up by Mickey Mouse." ...|$|E

500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} were mixed. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club called Brian's plotline a [...] "pretty funny, if uninspired, take on the pilot process." [...] VanDerWerff also criticized the Stewie storyline, calling it an {{unnecessary}} [...] "grossout gag." [...] In a more positive review, Jason Hughes of TV Squad noted that [...] "both storylines were <b>funny</b> <b>to</b> their respective ends," [...] in addition to praising James Woods' performance in the episode. Ramsey Isler of IGN criticized Brian's plotline, writing that it [...] "really didn't work as comedy" [...] and [...] "if the episode had been entirely about Stewie's predicament, {{it might have been}} much better".|$|E

The episode was also the first time Mr. Garrison was portrayed as an anti-semite and racist, particularly when he asks Mayor McDaniels if she can get rid of all the Mexicans in South Park. Parker said this decision was made because, [...] "Garrison at that point had already shown himself to be the most messed up person in the entire town, and there's obviously so much wrong with him mentally.

500|$|In 1990, Burton hired Jonathan Gems {{to write}} a sequel titled Beetlejuice Goes Hawaiian. [...] "Tim {{thought it would be}} <b>funny</b> <b>to</b> match the surfing {{backdrop}} of a beach movie with some sort of German Expressionism, because they're totally wrong together," [...] Gems said. The story followed the Deetz family moving to Hawaii, where Charles is developing a resort. They soon discover that his company is building on the burial ground of an ancient Hawaiian Kahuna. The spirit comes back from the afterlife to cause trouble, and Betelgeuse becomes a hero by winning a surf contest with magic. Keaton and Ryder agreed to do the film, on the condition that Burton directed, but both he and Keaton became distracted with Batman Returns.|$|E
500|$|The Malay and English {{voices of}} the {{characters}} were dubbed by Malaysian voice actors. [...] Child actors were employed for the younger roles; however, Mat, Ana, Bo, and Tak were voiced by actors who were in their early twenties. [...] Certain actors had the task of voicing multiple roles; for example, the voice director was responsible for speaking the roles of Mrs Hew and Yah. [...] Initially, voice talents were hired in Los Angeles to dub the English version, but they [...] "kept slipping into a Jamaican accent". [...] Although this soundtrack was not used in the series, the producers felt it was too <b>funny</b> <b>to</b> waste and included it in The Making of Kampung Boy, which was broadcast {{a week before the}} start of the series.|$|E
500|$|The critic Michael Billington, {{writing in}} The Guardian, gave a mixed review: [...] "Once or twice one of Stoppard's brightly {{coloured}} balls {{falls to the}} ground, partly because Michael Hordern's moral philosopher substitutes academic mannerism for apprehension of the argument. But {{this is not to}} deny that Hordern's simian habit of scratching his left earlobe with right hand or leaning over his desk as if he is doing intellectual press-ups is very <b>funny</b> <b>to</b> watch or that he is brilliant at displaying cuckolded curiosity." [...] Harold Hobson, the drama critic, thought that failing to enjoy the play was [...] "not actually a criminal offence but it is a sad evidence of illiteracy". Jumpers won the Evening Standard 's Best Play Award which, much to Hordern's amusement, was presented by the philosopher A. J. Ayer.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by John Swartzwelder and {{directed}} by Wesley Archer. A plot twist that involved Homer being carried away to an eagle nest and being raised as a baby eagle was suggested for this episode by executive producer James L. Brooks, but they ended up going with Maggie being raised by bears instead. The sequence with Marge and Lisa by the bonfire was originally longer and included a conversation between the two about boys, but it was cut from the episode.

[...] Feeling that [...] "comedy films and horror films are kind of similar" [...] due to being films where you can significantly gauge intense reactions from the audience, Cody stated, [...] "They're laughing, they're screaming, it's not a passive experience.
