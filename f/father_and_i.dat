5|$|That rebellious {{attitude}} really came, I think, when {{my father}} remarried. Because for the three years before he married, I clung to him. It was like, OK, now you're mine, and you're not going anywhere. Like all young girls, I {{was in love with}} my <b>father</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> didn't want to lose him. I lost my mother, but then I was the mother, my father was mine. Then he got taken away from me when he married my stepmother. It was then that I said, OK I don’t need anybody. No one's going to break my heart again. I'm not going to need anybody. I can stand on my own and be my own person and not belong to anyone.|$|E
500|$|George and May {{had five}} {{sons and a}} daughter. Randolph Churchill claimed that George was a strict father, {{to the extent that}} his {{children}} were terrified of him, and that George had remarked to Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby: [...] "My father was frightened of his mother, I was frightened of my <b>father,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> am damned well going {{to see to it that}} my children are frightened of me." [...] In reality, there is no direct source for the quotation and it is likely that George's parenting style was little different from that adopted by most people at the time.|$|E
500|$|In August 1991, Gore {{announced}} that his son's accident {{was a factor}} in his decision not to run for president during the 1992 presidential election. Gore stated: [...] "I would like to be President. But I am also a <b>father,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> feel deeply about my responsibility to my children. I didn't feel right about tearing myself away from my family to the extent that is necessary in a Presidential campaign." [...] During this time, Gore wrote Earth in the Balance, a text which became the first book written by a sitting U.S. Senator to make The New York Times Best Seller list since John F. Kennedy's Profiles in Courage.|$|E

500|$|... "Papa Don't Preach" [...] is {{a message}} song that {{everyone}} is going to take the wrong way. Immediately they're going to say I am advising every young girl {{to go out and get}} pregnant. When I first heard the song, I thought it was silly. But then I thought, wait a minute, this song is really about a girl who is making a decision in her life. She has a very close relationship with her father and wants to maintain that closeness. To me it's a celebration of life. It says, 'I love you, <b>father,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> love this man and this child that is growing inside me'. Of course, who knows how it will end? But at least it starts off positive." ...|$|E
500|$|Screenwriter John August {{identified}} with Will's character and adapted it after himself. In college, August's father died, and like Will, August {{had attempted to}} get to know him before his death, but found it difficult. Like Will, August had studied journalism and was 28 years old. In the film, Will says of Edward, [...] "I didn't see anything of myself in my <b>father,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't think he saw anything of himself in me. We were like strangers who knew each other very well." [...] Will's description of his relationship with Edward closely resembled August's own relationship with his father. Burton also used the film to confront his thoughts and emotions concerning {{the death of his father}} in 2000: [...] "My father had been ill for a while... I tried to get in touch with him, to have, like in this film, some sort of resolution, but it was impossible." ...|$|E

Her parents were Milton, a farmer turned greenkeeper, and Wendy, {{who worked in}} a pharmacy. Her {{creativity}} was nurtured from a young age. Aged just eight, Oliver attended weekend art classes in Inverell run by Ian Howard, {{who went on to}} become dean of the college in Sydney where she would later study. As she was dux of her school, her parents expected her to go on to university. However, Oliver wished to pursue a creative career. When she told her parents of her plans, her mother replied, [...] "Darling, your <b>father</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> are very pleased you're going to art school, but if you'd been a son, I think we'd be a little disappointed." [...] A rift subsequently developed between her and her family that resulted in her having no contact with them for 25 years.|$|E

My <b>father</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> had made some photo albums together of his relatives and different people in the family. A couple people saw [...] and they were like, 'This is amazing that you have this.' I guess everybody was like, 'How would you feel about this type of concept ?' So I guess I thought if someone's going to do it might as well be me. The story line [...] is about an interracial couple. It's sort of Romeo and Juliet but it's set in the '60s and they're kind of torn apart. It's about their struggle and I'm sort of the narrator. I don't want to give too much away about it, but it's nice. Something I could relate to, being the product of an interracial union, though [...] did not wind up happily ever after standing in church together.|$|E
500|$|Throughout his life, Rudolph {{suffered}} from a gambling problem and was labeled a [...] "compulsive gambler". [...] He would often spend his leisure time placing bets at race tracks and Las Vegas, Nevada and Puerto Rico casinos. At that time, NBA referees were allowed to gamble, but this practice has since been prohibited. [...] As he incurred gambling losses, Rudolph was once offered by a Las Vegas gambler to erase his outstanding debt by participating in point shaving. [...] However, he {{refused to accept the}} offer and said to his wife, [...] "It goes against all my principles. I love the game too much, respect it too much. I couldn't do it to you. I couldn't do it to the memory of my <b>father,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> couldn't do it to myself. If I have to go into bankruptcy, something I'd hate to do, I'd do it," [...] according to in a 1992 New York Times interview with Susan Rudolph. [...] Rudolph had cashed in his $60,000 pension fund to pay debts and he still owed an additional $100,000. [...] While he refused to seek professional help, Rudolph cut back on his gambling habit later in his life.|$|E

Bradley Bell co-created The Bold and the Beautiful with his father. William Bell Jr. became involved in the family's production companies as president of Bell Dramatic Serial Co. and Bell-Phillip Television Productions Inc. [...] "It's worked out very well for us because we really all worked in very different aspects of the show," [...] William Bell Jr. said.

Zhuge Zhan led the Shu forces to Fu to resist the enemy but retreated to Mianzhu (緜竹) when he heard that the Shu vanguard had been defeated. Deng Ai sent a messenger to ask Zhuge Zhan to surrender, but Zhuge refused and executed the messenger.

2500|$|Hopkins {{was born}} on New Year's Eve 1937, in Margam, a suburb of Port Talbot, Glamorgan. His parents were Annie Muriel (née Yeates) and Richard Arthur Hopkins, a baker. He stated his father’s working class values have always underscored his life. “Whenever I get a feeling that I may be special or different, I think of my <b>father</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{remember}} his hands – his hardened, broken hands". His school days were unproductive; he would rather immerse himself in art, such as painting and drawing, or playing the piano, than attend to his studies. In 1949, to instill discipline, his parents insisted he attend Jones' West Monmouth Boys' School in Pontypool. He remained there for five terms and was then educated at Cowbridge Grammar School in the Vale of Glamorgan. In a 2002 interview he stated: [...] "I was a poor learner, which left me open to ridicule and gave me an inferiority complex. I grew up absolutely convinced I was stupid." [...] In desperation, his parents sent him off to boarding school, where the headmaster {{told him he was}} [...] "hopeless" [...] and he developed a [...] "sheer contempt for authority." [...] He stumbled into acting at 17 with a YMCA group (his one line: [...] "").|$|E
2500|$|I am Mesha, son of Chemosh-gad, king of Moab, the Dibonite. My father reigned over Moab thirty years, and I have reigned {{after my}} <b>father.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> have built this {{sanctuary}} for Chemosh in Karchah, a sanctuary of salvation, for he saved me from all aggressors, {{and made me}} look upon all mine enemies with contempt. Omri was king of Israel, and oppressed Moab during many days, and Chemosh was angry with his aggressions. His son succeeded him, and he also said, I will oppress Moab. In my days he said, Let us go, and I will see my desire upon him and his house, and Israel said, I shall destroy it for ever. Now Omri took the land of Madeba, and occupied it in his day, and {{in the days of}} his son, forty years. And Chemosh had mercy on it in my time. And I built Baal-meon and made therein the ditch, and I built Kiriathaim. And the men of Gad dwelled in the country of Ataroth from ancient times, and the king of Israel fortified Ataroth. I assaulted the wall and captured it, and killed all the warriors of the city for the well-pleasing of Chemosh and Moab, and I removed from it all the spoil, and offered it before Chemosh in Kirjath; and I placed therein the men of Siran, and the men of Mochrath. And Chemosh said to me, Go take Nebo against Israel, and I went in the night and I fought against it from the break of day till noon, and I took it: and I killed in all seven thousand men, but I did not kill the women and maidens, for I devoted them to Ashtar-Chemosh; and I took from it the vessels of Jehovah, and offered them before Chemosh. And the king of Israel fortified Jahaz, and occupied it, when he made war against me, and Chemosh drove him out before me, and I took from Moab two hundred men in all, and placed them in Jahaz, and took it to annex it to Dibon. I built Karchah the wall of the forest, and the wall of the Hill. I have built its gates and I have built its towers. I have built the palace of the king, and I made the prisons for the criminals within the wall. And there were no wells in the interior of the wall in Karchah. And I said to all the people, ‘Make you every man a well in his house.’ And I dug the ditch for Karchah with the chosen men of Israel. I built Aroer, and I made the road across the Arnon. I took Beth-Bamoth for it was destroyed. I built Bezer for it was cut down by the armed men of Daybon, for all Daybon was now loyal; and I reigned from Bikran, which I added to my land. And I built Beth-Gamul, and Beth-Diblathaim, and Beth Baal-Meon, and I placed there the poor people of the land. And as to Horonaim, the men of Edom dwelt therein, on the descent from old.
