Several <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>interesting</b> chemical problems are investigated {{by analyzing the}} MW spectra of the corresponding molecular systems. First, the general aspects of rotational spectroscopy are summarized, and then the basic theory on molecular rotation and experimental method are described briefly. ab initio and density function theory (DFT) calculations that used in this thesis to assist the assignment of rotational spectrum are also included. From chapter 3 to chapter 8, several molecular systems concerning different <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> general chemical problems are presented. In chapter 3, the conformation and internal motions of dimethyl sulfate are reported. The internal rotations of the two methyl groups split each rotational transition into several components line, allowing for the determination of accurate values of the V 3 barrier height to internal rotation and of {{the orientation of the}} methyl groups with respect to the principal axis system.
