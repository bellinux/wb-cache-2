5000|$|William Shakespeare made {{substantial}} use of cross-dressing {{for female}} characters who took on masculine clothing {{to carry out}} actions difficult for women. In Shakespeare's play The Merchant of Venice, Portia and her maid <b>dress</b> <b>as</b> men to plead in court on the merchant's behalf, and are quite successful in their ruse; in the same play, Shylock's daughter Jessica <b>dresses</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> man to elope with her Christian lover. Twelfth Night, or What You Will deals extensively with cross-dressing through the female protagonist Viola. She disguises herself as Cesario and immediately finds herself {{caught up in a}} love triangle. She loves Duke Orsino who loves Countess Olivia who loves Cesario. Luckily, all is resolved when Viola's presumed dead twin brother Sebastian comes along. We only see Viola as Viola in one scene; {{for the rest of the}} play she is <b>dressed</b> <b>as</b> Cesario. When Rosalind and Celia flee court in As You Like It, Rosalind dresses, for their protection, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> man. However, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> way to further complicate the situation for comedic affect, Shakespeare has Rosalind's male character [...] "Ganymede" [...] <b>dress</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> woman to help a male friend, Orlando de Boys, practice wooing Rosalind, with whom he is smitten, while at the same time fending off the affections Phoebe has for [...] "Ganymede". In other words, it is a man, (the actor), <b>dressing</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> woman, <b>dressing</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> man, <b>dressing</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> woman.|$|R
