40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effect of variables that may influence the decision of seniors {{over the age of}} 60 not to participate in adult learning activities and literacy skills. Three research questions were of interest to the researcher. First, which of five socio-economic status (SES) variables (age, income, gender, employment status, education) are the best predictors of <b>deterrents</b> <b>to</b> participation in adult learning activities by seniors 60 years of age and over? Second, which of six <b>deterrents</b> <b>to</b> participation (lack of confidence, lack of course relevance, time constraints, low personal priority, cost, and personal problems) are the best predictors of participation in adult learning activities by seniors 60 years of age and over? Finally, is participation in adult learning activities by seniors 60 years of age and over a predictor of seniors' literacy skills? To measure seniors' reasons for not participating in adult learning activities, the <b>Deterrents</b> <b>to</b> Participation Scale-General was administered. Literacy skills were measured by the Tests of Applied Literacy Skills document literacy domain. To test the factors that were expected to affect non-participation, a survey questionnaire was administered to two groups, those who were currently participating in an organized adult learning activity and those who were not. Multiple regression estimates demonstrated that none of the regression lines could be plotted against any of the six <b>deterrents</b> <b>to</b> participation as criterion variables on the five SES variables as predictors. However, when the SES variables were held constant, only the effect of the variable employment status using the <b>deterrents</b> <b>to</b> participation lack of course relevance and low personal priority had a tendency to deliver the strongest explanatory power among all other predictor variables. Furthermore, regression estimates demonstrated that none of the six <b>deterrents</b> <b>to</b> participation had any effect on participation and that document literacy skills could not be predicted as a function of participation. In addition, the DPS-G showed low reliability estimates suggesting that the instrument needs to be revised taking into consideration other dimensions of <b>deterrents</b> <b>to</b> participation that are more relevant to seniors' lives...|$|R

5|$|Because {{of their}} status as the largest {{warships}} in the U.S. Navy, the deployment of an aircraft carrier can fulfill a symbolic role, not {{just in terms of}} a <b>deterrent</b> <b>to</b> an enemy, but often as a diplomatic tool, in strengthening relations with allies and potential allies. The latter of these functions can take place either as a single visit to a country, in which senior naval officers are allowed to observe the operating of the carrier and to interact with its senior officers, or as part of an international task force. This can be in combat operations, such as NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999, or other deployments involving training, such as Exercise RIMPAC. In addition, carriers have participated in international Maritime security operations, combating piracy in the Persian Gulf and off the coast of Somalia.|$|E

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Educational LeadershipW. Franklin SpikesMillions of Americans profess {{belief in}} God and follow a Protestant Christian belief system. However, very little {{research}} or literature explores {{their participation in}} religious adult education. Several areas within adult education are exhaustively researched such as health care, leisure, and career related courses, but studies within religion go largely unexamined. This study sought to develop an understanding concerning <b>deterrents</b> <b>to</b> participation in religious adult education. Additionally, this study sought <b>to</b> compare <b>deterrents</b> in the Protestant Christian church <b>to</b> <b>deterrents</b> experienced by the general adult population {{in their pursuit of}} education. 	This study used a modified <b>Deterrents</b> <b>to</b> Participation Scale-General (DPS-G) Likert scale survey to gather both demographic and barrier to participation information. Data collected from the survey was analyzed using a variety of descriptive and nonparametric statistical tests. Comparative analyses were conducted <b>to</b> liken <b>deterrents</b> <b>to</b> participation in religious adult education to the general adult population. 	The study revealed that all six <b>deterrents</b> <b>to</b> participation categories found on the DPS-G survey instrument had a bearing on a Protestant Christian’s religious adult education participation. The barrier to participation found to deter the most demographic groups was personal problems. This deterrent was followed in order of magnitude by: lack of confidence, time, lack of relevance, low personal priority, and cost. This study also found that barriers deterring adult Protestant Christian participation vary from those deterring the general adult population’s participation in secular educational programs. 	This study was exploratory and, as such, can be used for future researchers to examine why certain deterrents impact certain demographic groups. However, in the interim this research can be used for religious adult education program planners <b>to</b> better understand <b>deterrents</b> <b>to</b> participation and develop courses of action to help overcome these barriers...|$|R

5|$|Nevertheless, {{it was not}} an easy {{introduction}} to the front for the New Zealanders. On arriving in their sector, they found the defensive arrangements to be poor and immediately set about improving the trenches and wire emplacements. Although the bulk of the division's personnel manned secondary defences rearward of the front line to avoid the German artillery, the forward areas had to be constantly patrolled as a <b>deterrent</b> <b>to</b> an attack and to give the impression they were fully manned. The static nature of the war meant that the Divisional Mounted Troops, intended to be used as scouts, were redundant and, along with two Light Horse squadrons from the Australian infantry divisions, were soon transferred to a new formation designated 1st ANZAC Light Horse Regiment. In July, the New Zealand Division was transferred to the newly arrived II ANZAC Corps while I ANZAC moved south to the Somme.|$|E
5|$|News of the French {{declaration}} of war arrived by ship in Calcutta, having traveled from George Baldwin, British ambassador in Alexandria, on 1 June 1793. Cornwallis immediately sailed to Pondicherry, instituting a blockade and seizing an ammunition supply ship entering the port. Plans to eliminate the French presence in India had already been drawn up. The British and EIC forces, commanded on land by Colonel John Braithwaite, moved rapidly, seizing Chandernagore, Karaikal, Yanam and Mahé without resistance. Pondicherry proved stronger, and Braithwaite was forced to besiege the city for 22 days until the French commander, Colonel Prosper de Clermont, agreed to surrender. Cornwallis's blockade was augmented by several large East Indiamen, proving sufficient as a <b>deterrent</b> <b>to</b> drive off the French frigate Cybèle and accompanying storeships which sought to resupply the garrison on 14 August.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} Chinese adults' motivational orientations for learning and the <b>deterrents</b> <b>to</b> participation in educational activities and compare the motivational factors and <b>deterrents</b> <b>to</b> participation between Chinese men and women. The participants in the study were 377 Chinese men and 202 women from fifteen adult education programs in Chengdu city, China southwest capital of Sichuan province. Roger Boshier's Education Participation Scale and Scanlan and Darkenwald's <b>Deterrents</b> <b>to</b> Participation Scale were used as data collection instruments. The mean scores of EPS and DPS items were calculated and used for examination of the extent to which they influenced Chinese adults' decisions to and not to participate in educational activities. The data from EPS and DPS were analyzed by using Chi-square statistics to examine the relationship between Chinese men and women in terms of motivational orientations for learning and <b>deterrents</b> <b>to</b> participation. The study found that the factor of Professional Advancement showed the strongest motivation which influenced Chinese adults on their decisions of participation in adult education. Followed by the factor of Social Welfare and the factor of Social Relationship. The factor of ExternalExpectation was found the least influential typology on decision of participation. The deterrent factor of Lack of Course Relevance showed the highest summed mean scores of all six dimensions. The reasons related to the institutional barrier appeared to have the strongest influence on Chinese adults' decisions not to participate in adult education. To a lesser extent, mean scores in the factors of Time Constraints and Cost indicated moderate influence on decisions not to participate. The Personal Problems was found with the lowest mean score in the <b>Deterrents</b> <b>to</b> Participation Scale. Significant differences were found between Chinese men and women in the factors of External Expectations, Escape/Stimulation and Cognitive Interest at. 01 level (p. <. 01), and factors of Social Relationship and Social Welfare at. 05 level (p. <. 05). In terms of <b>deterrents</b> <b>to</b> participation, significant differences were found between Chinese men and women in the factor of Time Constraints at. 01 level, and the factors of Lack of Course Relevance, Cost and Personal Problems at. 05 level.

Such systems posed a major <b>deterrent</b> <b>to</b> the Republic of Vietnam Air Force, since its aircraft were not {{equipped to deal with}} such threats. As a result, South Vietnamese aerial interdiction of the communist logistical build-up became almost impossible and reconnaissance flights were held to a minimum.

40|$|Senior {{leaders in}} state {{government}} public sector agencies must manage employee performance to ensure quality {{services to the}} citizens they serve. Limited academic research exists to study the barriers that these leaders acknowledge as <b>deterrents</b> <b>to</b> managing employee performance. The purpose of this qualitative study {{was to understand the}} reasons that public sector leaders at the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) were challenged to manage employee performance and explore the role of transformational leadership. The ODOT was selected for this research because two prior worker surveys conducted by the agency revealed that employee performance accountability was an issue of concern. Following the conceptual framework of transformational and full range leadership, the research question for this study examined the barriers that these leaders cited as <b>deterrents</b> <b>to</b> managing employee performance. Twelve leaders were interviewed using a 5 -item, open-ended questionnaire. Data were analyzed using inductive coding techniques and examined against the full range leadership continuum. The results of the study revealed nine barriers that leaders cited as <b>deterrents</b> <b>to</b> managing employee performance. The most frequently occurring included subordinates 2 ̆ 7 self-preservation interests, market pay disparity, employee low motivation levels, and ineffective leadership training. The study concluded the role of transformational leadership was minimal, as leaders identified mostly with transactional characteristics. These findings may assist public leaders to improve performance management outcomes and possibly increase the quality of services to citizens...|$|R

5|$|Bradley {{raised the}} {{possibility}} of using nuclear weapons in Korea at a Joint Chiefs of Staff meeting on 9 July 1950 at Eisenhower's instigation, but there was no support for the idea. The Army staff sent a cable to Collins in Tokyo suggesting that he seek out MacArthur's opinion. In a teleconference on 13 July, Major General Charles L. Bolte proposed sending nuclear weapons. MacArthur had already turned down Air Force proposals to fire bomb North Korean cities, and suggested that atomic bombs could be used to isolate North Korea by taking out bridges and tunnels. The Army staff considered this impractical. However, on 28 July, the Joint Chiefs decided to send ten nuclear-capable B-29 bombers of the 9th Bombardment Wing to Guam as a <b>deterrent</b> <b>to</b> Chinese action against Taiwan. Truman publicly denied that he was considering the use of nuclear weapons in Korea, but authorised the transfer to Guam of atomic bombs without their fissile cores. The deployment did not go well; one of the bombers crashed on takeoff from Fairfield-Suisun Air Force Base in California on 5 August, killing the mission commander, Brigadier General Robert F. Travis, and 18 others. The remaining nine bombers remained in Guam until 13 September, when they returned to the United States. The bomb assemblies stayed behind.|$|E
