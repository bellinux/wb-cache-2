5|$|The Hale Commission was {{established}} by the Commonwealth of England on 30 January 1652 and led by Sir Matthew Hale to investigate law reform. Consisting of eight lawyers and thirteen laymen, the Commission met approximately {{three times a week}} and proposed changes as radical (at the time) as reducing the use of the death penalty, allowing witnesses, legal aid and lawyers for defendants in criminal cases and creating County Courts and a Court of Appeal for criminal cases. Though the Commission was unsuccessful at passing any of its measures under the Rump Parliament, two of its measures were put into law by the subsequent Barebone's Parliament, and, {{by the middle of the}} 20th century, most of the others were as well. Debate has occurred over the effectiveness and strife within the Commission between its more moderate and radical members; the general conclusion <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>with</b> the sheer volume of work produced and the vast proportion of moderate to radical members, it is unlikely such strife existed.|$|E

It includes the base {{system and a}} complete set of manual pages, and may include source code and useful packages in future versions. The advantage of this <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>with</b> a single CD you can install the software onto a computer, use a full set of tools to repair a damaged installation, or demonstrate the capabilities of the system without installing it. Daily snapshots are available from the master site {{for those who want to}} install the most recent versions of DragonFly without building from source.|$|E
5|$|Two {{external}} factors had their impacts on Verdi's compositions of this period. One <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>with</b> increasing reputation and financial security {{he no longer}} needed to commit himself to the productive treadmill, had more freedom to choose his own subjects, and {{had more time to}} develop them according to his own ideas. In the years 1849 to 1859 he wrote eight new operas, compared with fourteen in the previous ten years.|$|E

30|$|Thus, {{the only}} {{reasonable}} conclusion would <b>be</b> <b>that,</b> <b>with</b> the relative paucity of data available, {{the effectiveness of}} antidepressants, whether prescribed as monotherapy or adjunctive to mood stabilizers for bipolar depression is still unproven (Gitlin 2012).|$|R
5|$|Granule cells receive all {{of their}} input from mossy fibers, but outnumber them by 200 to 1 (in humans). Thus, the {{information}} in the granule cell population activity state is the same as {{the information in the}} mossy fibers, but recoded in a much more expansive way. Because granule cells are so small and so densely packed, it is difficult to record their spike activity in behaving animals, so there is little data to use as a basis for theorizing. The most popular concept of their function was proposed in 1969 by David Marr, who suggested that they could encode combinations of mossy fiber inputs. The idea <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>with</b> each granule cell receiving input from only 4–5 mossy fibers, a granule cell would not respond if only a single one of its inputs were active, but would respond if more than one were active. This combinatorial coding scheme would potentially allow the cerebellum to make much finer distinctions between input patterns than the mossy fibers alone would permit.|$|E
25|$|A more {{rigorous}} statement <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>with</b> respect to exchange of two identical particles the total wave function is antisymmetric for fermions, and symmetric for bosons. This {{means that if}} the space and spin co-ordinates of two identical particles are interchanged the wave function changes its sign for fermions, and does not change for bosons.|$|E
25|$|The {{popularity}} of the term fractional ownership has caused extensive rebranding in other industries where similar concepts, such as real estate timeshares, were already well established. The main distinction between timeshare and fractional ownership <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>with</b> a timeshare you buy {{the right to use}} a property, but with fractional ownership, you are buying real estate. You get a deeded piece of real estate, just not for the entire parcel.|$|E

50|$|Alsted's {{approach}} influenced, among others, the pedagogue Johann Amos Comenius and the Hungarian encyclopedist Apáczai Csere János (1625-1659).

25|$|Problem-solving {{analysis}} {{is the second}} method initiated by the Harvard Business School which {{is by far the}} most widely used method in MBA and executive development programs. The underlying concept <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>with</b> enough practice (hundreds of case analyses) students develop intuitive skills for analyzing and resolving complex business situations. Successful implementation of this method depends heavily on the skills of the discussion leader.|$|E
25|$|Centrifugal {{compressors}} {{are often}} used in small gas turbine engines like APUs (auxiliary power units) and smaller aircraft gas turbines. A significant reason for this <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>with</b> current technology, the equivalent flow axial compressor will be less efficient due primarily {{to a combination of}} rotor and variable stator tip-clearance losses. Further, they offer the advantages of simplicity of manufacturing and relatively low cost. This is due to requiring fewer stages to achieve the same pressure rise.|$|E
25|$|Angiography, {{since the}} 1960s, {{has been the}} {{traditional}} way of evaluating for atheroma. However, angiography is only motion or still images of dye mixed with the blood with the arterial lumen and never show atheroma; the wall of arteries, including atheroma with the arterial wall remain invisible. The limited exception to this rule <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>with</b> very advanced atheroma, with extensive calcification within the wall, a halo-like ring of radiodensity {{can be seen in}} most older humans, especially when arterial lumens are visualized end-on. On cine-floro, cardiologists and radiologists typically look for these calcification shadows to recognize arteries before they inject any contrast agent during angiograms.|$|E

25|$|The basic {{reason for}} the {{constant}} shortage of labour <b>was</b> <b>that,</b> <b>with</b> large amounts of cheap land available and lots of landowners searching for workers, free European immigrants were able to become landowners themselves after a relatively short time, thus increasing the need for workers.|$|R
25|$|As of 2007, Feyenoord {{currently}} have three formal partnerships, a satellite club arrangement with nearby Excelsior, {{a partnership with}} Hungary's Újpest FC and the Feyenoord Academy in Ghana. The strongest of these partnerships <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>with</b> Excelsior, who since 1996 have loaned young Feyenoord players {{on the verge of}} the first team. The purpose of this is to allow them to experience regular first-team football, aiding their development while simultaneously strengthening Excelsior's squad. The highest profile players to have played at Excelsior as part of this arrangement are Thomas Buffel and Salomon Kalou, who were both subsequently involved in transfer deals worth several million euros. The partnership between Feyenoord and Excelsior was scaled back in 2006, though the clubs still work together.|$|E
25|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to examine the difference between the hot-hand and gambler's fallacy. The gambler's fallacy is the expectation of a reversal following a run of one outcome. Gambler's fallacy occurs mostly in cases in which people feel that an event is random, such as rolling a pair of dice on a craps table or spinning the roulette wheel. It is caused by the false belief that the random numbers of a small sample will balance out the way they do in large samples; this is known as the law of small numbers heuristic. The difference between this and the hot-hand fallacy <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>with</b> the hot-hand fallacy an individual expects a run to continue. There is a much larger aspect of the hot hand that relies on the individual. This relates to a person's perceived ability to predict random events, which is not possible for truly random events. The fact that people believe that they have this ability is in line with the illusion of control.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the theories that people connected to the revisionist movement are the perpetrators of murder {{and that it was}} an intended sexual attack by two Arabs there are theories connecting it to the Soviet and Nazi regimes. One involves the Nazi leader Joseph Goebbels: During the first world war, Magda Behrend, who later became the wife of Joseph Goebbels, met and became close friends with Lisa Arlosoroff, Haim Arlosoroff's sister. The nature of her relationship with Haim Arlosoroff is unknown. Magda married Goebbels on 19 December 1931, with Adolf Hitler as a witness. A year and a half later, Arlosoroff went to Germany to negotiate the Ha'avarah (transfer) agreement with high Nazi officials. The theory <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>with</b> Haim Arlosoroff's personal involvement in the negotiations, Goebbels took notice of his wife's former Jewish friend and sought to erase what might have been an embarrassment for the Goebbelses. Magda's former Jewish stepfather, Richard Friedländer, was arrested on Goebbels orders and died in the concentration camp in 1938. The Soviet connection was promoted by Shmuel Dothan in 1991 to counter what the Soviet considered as a global military plot against them.|$|E

25|$|Although {{physical}} characteristics and sizes at various instars {{have been used}} to estimate fly age, a more recent study has been conducted to determine the age of an egg based on the expression of particular genes. This is particularly useful in determining developmental stages that are not evidenced by change in size; such as the egg or pupa and where only a general time interval can be estimated based on the duration of the particular developmental stage. This is done by breaking the stages down into smaller units separated by predictable changed in gene expression. Three genes were measured in an experiment with Drosophila melanogaster: bicoid (bcd), slalom (sll), and chitin synthase (cs). These three genes were used because {{they are likely to be}} in varied levels during different times of the egg development process. These genes all share a linear relationship in regards to age of the egg; that is, the older the egg is the more of the particular gene is expressed. However, all of the genes are expressed in varying amounts. Different genes on different loci would need to be selected for another fly species. The genes expressions are mapped in a control sample to formulate a developmental chart of the gene expression at certain time intervals. This chart can then be compared to the measured values of gene expression to accurately predict the age of an egg to within two hours with a high confidence level. Even though this technique can be used to estimate the age of an egg, the feasibility and legal acceptance of this must be considered for it to be a widely utilized forensic technique. One benefit of this would be that it is like other DNA-based techniques so most labs would be equipped to conduct similar experiments without requiring new capital investment. This style of age determination is in the process of being used to more accurately find the age of the instars and pupa; however, it is much more complicated, as there are more genes being expressed during these stages. The hope <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>with</b> this and other similar techniques a more accurate PMI can be obtained.|$|E
