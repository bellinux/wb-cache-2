40|$|G. lucidum {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} and widely distributed ligninolytic white rot fungi from habitats such as forest soils, agricultural soils, and tropical mangrove ecosystems and produce laccases as an important family of lignin modifying enzymes. Biochemically, laccases are blue multi copper oxidases that couple four electron reduction of molecular oxygen to water. There is a growing interest in the use of laccases for a variety of industrial applications such as bio-pulping and biobleaching as well as in their ability to detoxify a wide variety of toxic environmental pollutants. These key oxidative enzymes are found in all the three domains of life: Eukaryota. Prokarya, and Archaea. Ganoderma lucidum (strain no. 103561) produces laccase with some of the highest activity (17, 000 micro <b>katals</b> per mg of protein) reported for any laccases to date. Our results showed that this organism produces at least 11 different isoforms of laccase based on variation in mol. weight and/or PI. Our Studies showed that the presence of copper in the medium yields 15 - to 20 -fold greater levels of enzyme by G. lucidum. Dialysation of extra cellular fluid of G. lucidum against 10 mM sodium tartrate (pH 5. 5) gave an additional 15 to 17 fold stimulation of activity with an observed specific activity of 17, 000 {micro}katals/mg protein. Dialysis against acetate buffer gave five fold increase in activity while dialysis against glycine showed inhibition of activity. Purification by FPLC and preparative gel electrophoresis gave purified fractions that resolved into eleven isoforms as separated by isoelectric focusing, and the PI,s were 4. 7, 4. 6, 4. 5, 4. 3, 4. 2, 4. 1, 3. 8, 3. 7, 3. 5, 3. 4 and 3. 3. Genomic clones of laccase were isolated using G. lucidum DNA as a template and using inverse PCR and forward/reverse primers corresponding to the sequences of the conserved copper binding region in the N-terminal domain of one of the laccases of this organism. Inverse PCR amplication of HindIII digested and ligated G. lucidum DNA was done using ABI Geneamp XL PCR kit in Ribocycler. The 5 conserved copper binding region of laccase was used for designing forward primer (5 TCGACAATTCTTTCCTGTACG 3) and reverse primer (5 TGGAGATGGG ACACT GGCTTATC 3). The PCR profile was 95 C for 3 min, 94 C for 1 min, 57 C for 30 sec and 68 C for 5 min. for 30 cycles, and the final extension was at 72 C for 10 min. The resulting {approx} 2. 7 Kb inverse PCR fragment was cloned into ZERO TOPOII blunt ligation vector (INVITROGEN) and screened on Kanamycin plates. Selected putative clones containing inserts were digested with a battery of restriction enzymes and analyzed on 1 % agarose gels. Restriction digestion of these clones with BamHI, PstI, SalI, PvuII, EcoRI, and XhoI revealed 8 distinct patterns suggesting gene diversity. Two clones were sequenced using overlapping primers on ABI system. The sequences were aligned using Bioedit program. The aa sequences of the clones were deduced by Genewise 2 program using Aspergillus as the reference organism. Eukaryotic gene regulatory sequences were identified using GeneWise 2 Program. Laccase sequence alignments and similarity indexes were calculated using ClustalW and BioEdit programs. Blast analysis of two distinct BamHI clones, lac 1 and lac 4, showed that the proteins encoded by these clones are fungal laccase sequences. The coding sequence of lac 1 gene is interrupted by 6 introns ranging in size from 37 - 55 nt and encodes a mature protein consisting of 456 aa (Mr: 50, 160), preceded by a putative 37 -aa signal sequence. This predicted Mr is in agreement with the range of Mrs previously reported by us for the laccases of G. lucidum. The deduced aa sequence of LAC 1 showed relatively high degree of homology with laccases of other basidiomycetes. It showed 96 % homology to full-length LAC 4 protein and 47 - 53 % similarity to unpublished partial laccase sequences of other G. lucidum strains. Among the other basidiomycete laccases, LAC 1 showed the highest similarity of 53 - 55 % to Trametes versicolorLAC 3 and LAC 4. The consensus copper-binding domains found in other basidiomycete laccases are conserved in the LAC 1 protein of G. lucidum. Eight putative N-glycosylation sites as well as consensus eukaryotic promoter sequence and polyadenylation signal sequences are also found. Coding sequence of lac 4 is interrupted by 7 introns, encodes a mature protein of 525 aa (Mr: 57, 750), and has 98 % nt homology to lac 1, but was otherwise identical. Molecular masses of GLAC 1 and GLAC 4 were 49. 8 kDa (462 aa) and 52. 5 kDa (524 aa) in comparison to T. versicolr laccase which was 56. 3 kDa (524 aa). Predicted PI values of GLAC 1, GLAC 4 and T. versicolor laccase are, respectively 4. 5, 4. 7, and 4. 2. Eight other laccase clones, distinct from lac 1 and lac 4 have recently been isolated from G. lucidum Our results show the existence of a laccase multi-gene family in G. lucidum in agreement with our earlier results showing multiple isoforms of laccase in this organism...|$|R

50|$|The {{specific}} activity of an enzyme is another common unit. This is {{the activity of}} an enzyme per milligram of total protein (expressed in μmol min−1mg−1). Specific activity gives a measurement of enzyme purity in the mixture. It is the moles of product formed by an enzyme in a given amount of time (minutes) under given conditions per milligram of total proteins. Specific activity {{is equal to the}} rate of reaction multiplied by the volume of reaction divided by the mass of total protein. The SI unit is <b>katal</b> kg−1, but a more practical unit is μmol mg−1 min−1. Specific activity is a measure of enzyme processivity, at a specific (usually saturating) substrate concentration, and is usually constant for a pure enzyme. For elimination of errors arising from differences in cultivation batches and/or misfolded enzyme etc. an active site titration needs to be done. This {{is a measure of the}} amount of active enzyme, calculated by e.g. titrating the amount of active sites present by employing an irreversible inhibitor. The {{specific activity}} should then be expressed as μmol min−1 mg−1 active enzyme. If the molecular weight of the enzyme is known, the turnover number, or μmol product per second per μmol of active enzyme, can be calculated from the specific activity. The turnover number can be visualized as the number of times each enzyme molecule carries out its catalytic cycle per second.|$|E

Using all the necessary parameters we determined the kinetic parameters of the enzyme and found that 250 i. u. correspond to 1 nkat. An empirical viscometric was used to estimate the activity of the enzyme, and the Km was determined using the kinetic dilution method. The estimates produced by the absolute and empirical approaches were in good agreement.

In contrast, an example of big data could be a dataset of several million or more weather forecast reference points for collecting real-time weather data, or Medicare claims records collected from providers over several years [6]. The increasing reliance on big data applications worldwide makes a case for developing effective and efficient ways to extract knowledge from this type of data.
