50|$|Covini's first prototype, the Covini T44 Turbo, was a 4x4 {{off-road}} vehicle with the exterior body consisting entirely of flat, <b>interchangeable</b> <b>panels.</b> It was {{powered by a}} 2000 cc turbocharged diesel motor. However, the T44 never saw actual production beyond the one prototype. Over the following 20 years, Covini developed several two-door sport cars with diesel engines: the T46, B24, T40, and C36. Only the B24 was produced in small quantities (including a few BT424 with Lancia Gamma petrol engine), while the other models remained at prototype level. The B24 was the first diesel car to reach 200 km/h, and the C36 in its final prototype form reached 300 km/h with its VM Motori diesel engine.|$|R

25|$|The AMC Cavalier {{was unique}} in that the vehicle was a study in symmetry. It was built to {{demonstrate}} the use of numerous <b>interchangeable</b> body <b>panels.</b> For example, the fenders were identical (the opposite ends, e.g. left front and right rear). The doors were similarly shared with opposite sides (an idea originated by Cord on its prototype 935 Saloon) since the rear doors were hinged in the back (suicide door). The hood and decklid were also interchangeable. The Nash Metropolitan, which was sold by AMC up to 1962, also had <b>interchangeable</b> inner <b>panels,</b> but their outer skins were different. In addition to reducing tooling costs by thirty percent, the design objective of the AMC Cavalier was also to demonstrate how to reduce the costs of production.|$|R

5000|$|The Ludix is a [...] scooter made by Peugeot Motorcycles {{which comes}} in various models {{including}} [...] "One", [...] "Snake" [...] and the [...] "Blaster RS12". The scooter comes in both air-cooled and water-cooled forms. The 'One' {{model is a}} single seat vehicle whereas other variants allowed for the carrying of pillion passengers. The One was also a very basic model that used drum brakes front and rear {{as opposed to a}} hydraulic front disc on more expensive models. Similarly, the One was a kick start only model whereas others were available with electric start. Also the One model runs on a generator instead of a 12 volt battery like other models and many other Peugeot scooters, this causes the indicators to be very dim, the horn to be poor sounding and quiet and there to be no lights on the small dash other than a two-stroke warning light. The models were designed to target the budget end of the market and used a modular panel system that allowed for cheap customising options through the use of easily <b>interchangeable</b> <b>panels.</b> Ludix 50cc scooters are used to stunt in Sweden Bollebygd.|$|R

50|$|Charles Darwent {{discusses}} Botticini's {{legacy in}} his article about the artist's painting San Gerolamo. The altarpiece, which was one unified scene created {{with a combination of}} multiple panels, is described as an engineering masterpiece as well as an art masterpiece. The uncommon painted outer frame gave Botticini the chance to experiment with his artistry and stray from the strict guidelines of the patron. This trend became popular with other artists in Botticini's realm of influence. Before this style of experimentation with the flexibility of the panels, artists were slaves to the carpenters initial construction of the altarpiece. Darwent believes that Botticini's new style of constructing <b>interchangeable</b> <b>panels</b> allowed artists to stray from the orthodox style of the patron and employed carpenter of the piece.Botticini also influenced the modern art world with his painting of Saint Sebastian, a Christian martyr who was killed with arrows because of his faith. In his painting Botticini depicts the Saint bound to a wooden pole, with arrows piercing his torso. In April 1968, Esquire Magazine imitated Botticini's painting in their cover shot of their article on Muhammad Ali, The Passion of Muhammed Ali. The cover was meant to relate the persecution of Saint Sebastian to the persecution of Muhammad Ali when we was stripped of his heavyweight boxing title for refusing to serve in the Vietnam War. George Lois, the art director of the magazine at the time, {{came up with the idea}} for the cover and pitched it to Ali. Ali initially liked the connection between the suffering of the Saint and himself, but initially refused to pose as a Christian. Eventually he agreed after speaking with the leader of the Nation of Islam, Elijah Muhammad, and studying a postcard of Botticini's painting for inspiration. The final product shows Ali with his hands bound behind him, arrows piercing his torso, his head tilted upwards in pain, imitating the Saint Sebastian that Botticini created.|$|R

40|$|Roof {{curvature}} is used {{to increase}} ground vehicle camber and enhance rear-body boat-tailing to reduce aerodynamic drag.

Optimum magnitudes of roof profile depth and axial location are suggested and the limited dataset indicates that increasing roof curvature is effective in reducing drag over a large yaw range, compared to a flat roof profile. This is primarily due to increased base pressure, possibly from enhanced mixing of longitudinal vortices shed from the rear-body upper side edges and increased turbulent mixing in the near-wake due to the increased effective boat-tail angle...|$|R

Lamson was a former test pilot for Boeing, setting up a joint venture, the Central-Lamson Corporation, to design and build a specialized agricultural aircraft, the Air Tractor, {{one of the first}} purpose-built aircraft for this role. The first prototype Air Tractor, registration N-31237, made its maiden flight on December 10, 1953. It was a single-engined, single-seat biplane of mixed wood and metal construction, with a gulled upper wing to give improved visibility for the pilot, who sat in an open cockpit aft of the trailing edge of the wings. The fuselage was of steel-tube construction, with the structure aft of the pilot's cockpit left uncovered for ease of maintenance. The wings were of fabric-covered wood structure, with all four main wing <b>panels</b> <b>interchangeable,</b> and with fuel tanks installed in the upper wing roots. Large endplates were fitted to the wingtips to give greater lift and better distribution of chemicals. The aircraft was fitted with a fixed tailwheel undercarriage, and was powered by a single Pratt & Whitney Wasp Junior radial engine.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} {{the suitability of}} the current wind provisions of the National Building Code of Canada for design wind loads on gable roofs of intermediate roof angles (10 ∘- 30 ∘). The study is initiated by the discrepancies found in recent research projects against the current design wind loading provisions for such roofs. Five building models with roof angles of 10 ∘, 15 ∘, 20 ∘, 25 ∘ and 30 ∘ equipped with an <b>interchangeable</b> roof slope <b>panel</b> have been tested in a typical open country exposure in the boundary layer wind tunnel of the Centre for Building Studies at Concordia University. The experimental settings satisfy the corresponding wind tunnel simulation criteria specified in the wind load test standards of American Society of Civil Engineers. Local and area-averaged roof pressure coefficients have been obtained from the wind tunnel measurements. Extreme value analysis has been performed to establish the peak pressure coefficient values. This thesis presents a comparative study based on the experimental data, which consists of two parts. The first part includes the comparisons of the measured results with those from other researches. The comparisons show that the present experimental results are appropriate and suitable for application to codification. The {{second part of the}} study examines the suitability of the current wind provisions by comparing the present results with those specified in the provisions. It appears that there is underestimation of the extreme suctions in the current wind provisions, particularly those on the ridge and edge regions of the roofs with intermediate slopes. As a result of the present study, an alternative zoning and loading definition is attempted, accompanied by a set of new curves. At the same time, the codal roof categories are rearranged. The proposed design roof wind pressure coefficients are somewhat higher than the current design value...|$|R
