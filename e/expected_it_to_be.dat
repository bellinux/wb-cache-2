5|$|Although Casablanca was an A-list {{film with}} {{established}} stars and first-rate writers, no one involved with its production <b>expected</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{anything out of}} the ordinary. It was just one of hundreds of pictures produced by Hollywood every year. Casablanca was rushed into release {{to take advantage of the}} publicity from the Allied invasion of North Africa a few weeks earlier. It had its world premiere on November 26, 1942, in New York City and was released nationally in the United States on January 23, 1943. The film was a solid if unspectacular success in its initial run.|$|E
5|$|A year {{prior to}} Kameo release, GamesRadar wrote {{that while they}} highly {{anticipated}} the title and <b>expected</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> of high quality, they thought the game's continual delays would likely hurt the final product. Closer to release, Tom Bramwell (Eurogamer) added that he had expected the game {{to be the best}} among the Xbox 360 launch titles. Kameo core gameplay concept brought his anticipation to par with that customary for The Legend of Zelda titles, and he thought the game would reap the benefits of its long development through refined audiovisuals. Xbox executive Peter Moore announced Kameo as his favorite launch title in anticipation of the Xbox 360's launch.|$|E
5|$|Whistler {{submitted}} {{the painting to}} the Academy, but according to Heffernan, he <b>expected</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> rejected at this point. The previous year, in 1861, another painting had caused a minor scandal. Edwin Henry Landseer's The Shrew Tamed showed a horse with a woman resting on the ground nearby. The model was named as Ann Gilbert, a noted equestrienne of the period: however it was soon rumoured that it was actually Catherine Walters, the notorious London courtesan. Whistler's painting was reminiscent enough of Landseer's that the judges were wary of admitting it. White Girl was submitted to the Academy along with three etchings, all three of which were accepted, while the painting was not.|$|E

In addition to the two South African brigades, he had the 201st Guards (Motorised) Brigade, 11th Indian Infantry Brigade, 32nd Army Tank Brigade and the 4th Anti-Aircraft Brigade. Tobruk had withstood a siege of nine months, before being relieved by Operation Crusader in December 1941. Allied leaders <b>expected</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to hold out for two months with the supplies in the fortress.

His new mother-in-law, also called Ann Thornton, had inherited a fortune of £8,000 after Colonel Brookes committed suicide in 1834. She died on 18 January 1849, two weeks after coming to stay with Palmer; she was known to have lent him money. An elderly Dr Bamford recorded a verdict of apoplexy. Palmer was disappointed with the inheritance {{he and his wife}} gained from the death, having <b>expected</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> much greater.|$|E
25|$|On 18 December, German {{infantry}} and armor resumed their {{attack on the}} twin villages. They were supported by the German 560th Heavy Antitank Battalion equipped with the state-of-the-art Jagdpanther tank destroyer. The Jagdpanther was armed with the 88mm cannon and the German leadership <b>expected</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the decisive element of the battle. The battle opened {{on the morning of}} the 18th with both sides targeting the village area with repeated artillery strikes, and German armored vehicles advanced into the twin villages. All that day and night, the battle raged, with SS tank and assault guns hitting the villages from the east, supported by a barrage of Nebelwerfer rockets. These forces were met in turn by a hailstorm of U.S. heavy artillery shells with proximity fuses and about 20 Sherman tanks belonging to the U.S. 741st Tank Battalion, and several M10 tank destroyers.|$|E

Footloose opened in 3,549 theaters taking in $15.5million and placing number two, behind Real Steel ($16.2million) in its opening weekend. Exit polls indicated that the film appealed to 75percent of females and 28percent of the teen market. About 60percent of the audience were over age 25 and 46percent over age 35. The 20th highest grossing locations on Friday were in Salt Lake City, Oklahoma City, Knoxville, Kansas City, and San Antonio. The opening was lower than other recent dance films like, Save the Last Dance (2001, $23.4million), Step Up (2006, $20.7million), but it performed around the same as Step Up 3D (2010, $15.8million) and You Got Served (2004, $16.1million). The 1984 Footloose opened to $20million when adjusted for ticket price inflation. In its second weekend the film held well, with a drop of 34percent. It placed third and grossed an estimated $10.4million.|$|E
25|$|Rivervale, {{bounded by}} Punggol Road and Sengkang East Drive forms the Punggol East Single Member Constituency (SMC), which was {{carved out of}} Pasir Ris-Punggol Group Representation Constituency (GRC) in the 2011 General Elections. Punggol East SMC saw the only three-cornered fight in the 2011 elections, with Michael Palmer from the People's Action Party (PAP), Desmond Lim from the Singapore Democratic Alliance (SDA), and Lee Li Lian from the Workers' Party (WP) contesting. The SMC was {{retained}} by incumbent Michael Palmer, who was also the MP when the ward was part of Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC. In December 2012, Palmer quit the PAP over an extra-marital affair, thereby vacating his seat and {{paving the way for}} a by-election that was called by the Prime Minister in January 2013. SDA's Lim and WP's Lee returned to contest the by-election, and the PAP fielded a newcomer, Dr Koh Poh Koon, who had joined the party only three weeks earlier. They were joined by a fourth competing party, the Reform Party (RP), represented by its secretary-general Kenneth Jeyaretnam. Despite this being a four-way fight, WP's Lee emerged victorious with 54.52% of valid votes cast, shocking many {{on both sides of the}} political divide, who <b>expected</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a close fight. PAP's Koh came in second with 43.71% of the votes, with the RP and SDA candidates losing their electoral deposits with less than 2% of the votes combined. However, Lee was unseated in the 2015 elections to the PAP's candidate and Deputy Speaker Charles Chong when he garnered 51.76% of the valid votes cast, while Lee getting the remaining 48.24%.|$|E

500|$|The fleet {{arrived in}} Boston on 24 June, and {{the troops were}} disembarked onto Noddle's Island (the present-day {{location}} of Logan International Airport).

[...] Since the fleet had left with insufficient supplies, its organizers <b>expected</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> fully provisioned in Boston.

[...] Laws were passed to prevent merchants from price-gouging, and sufficient provisions were eventually acquired.

He honored the compilation's concept of an EDM Star Wars tribute as funny: [...] "I'm not sure how long I'll listen to it, because in the end, it's still {{an hour or so}} of EDM, but it was a delightful soundtrack to a busy weekend, and all of the small surprises built into it should make it something that any Star Wars fan will be able to easily enjoy."

On February 22, 2010, the NCAA accused Michigan of failing to comply with practice time rules and [...] "failed to promote an atmosphere of compliance within the football program" [...] under coach Rich Rodriguez. The university had 90 days to respond and appeared at an NCAA hearing on infractions in August. Michigan issued self-sanctions on May 25, 2010, which included cutting practice time and placing itself on two years worth of probation. Michigan did, however, dispute the claim that Coach Rodriguez [...] "failed to promote an atmosphere of compliance." [...] The NCAA handed down their final verdict in the case on November 4, 2010, which accepted almost all of the self-sanctions that Michigan provided. Michigan was docked 130 practice hours, which was twice the number of excess hours that the university had exceeded, and placed on three years probation, which was one more than originally proposed; but the university and Rodriguez did, however, escape the most serious charge of [...] "failing to promote an atmosphere of compliance," [...] as the NCAA agreed with Michigan's statement that the cases were not deliberate and isolated.
