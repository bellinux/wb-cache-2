The Pan and Padoan (PP 10) model {{shows that the}} relative velocity between different particles has two contributions, named the generalized shear and acceleration terms, respectively. The generalized shear term represents the particles' memory of the spatial flow velocity difference across the particle distance in the past, while the acceleration term {{is associated with the}} temporal flow velocity difference on individual particle trajectories. Using the simulation of Paper I, we compute the root-mean-square relative velocity, ^ 1 / 2, {{as a function of the}} <b>friction</b> <b>times,</b> tau_p 1 and tau_p 2, of the two particles, and show that the PP 10 prediction is in satisfactory agreement with the data, confirming its physical picture. For a given tau_p 1 below the Lagrangian correlation time of the flow, T_L, ^ 1 / 2 as a function of tau_p 2 shows a dip at tau_p 2 ~tau_p 1, indicating tighter velocity correlation between similar particles.

When the joint was made at a <b>friction</b> <b>time</b> of 0 · 9 s, i. e. just after the initial peak of the friction torque, it had ∼ 93 % joint efficiency and fractured on the P-Al side.

The tensile strength of the P-Al base metal has decreased with increasing compression stress at any temperature.

But there was still a small amount of molten material flow into these two points; so the temperature was still higher than that of the welded time 3  s experimental group.|$|E
40|$|Motivated by its {{importance}} for modeling dust particle growth in protoplanetary disks, we study turbulence-induced collision statistics of inertial particles {{as a function}} of the particle <b>friction</b> <b>time,</b> tau_p. We show that turbulent clustering significantly enhances the collision rate for particles of similar sizes with tau_p corresponding to the inertial range of the flow. If the <b>friction</b> <b>time,</b> tau_p,h, of the larger particle is in the inertial range, the collision kernel per unit cross section increases with increasing <b>friction</b> <b>time,</b> tau_p,l, of the smaller particle, and reaches the maximum at tau_p,l = tau_p,h, where the clustering effect peaks. This feature is not captured by the commonly-used kernel formula, which neglects the effect of clustering. We argue that turbulent clustering helps alleviate the bouncing barrier problem for planetesimal formation. We also investigate the collision velocity statistics using a collision-rate weighting factor to account for higher collision frequency for particle pairs with larger relative velocity. For tau_p,h in the inertial range, the rms relative velocity with collision-rate weighting is found to be invariant with tau_p,l and scales with tau_p,h roughly as ~ tau_p,h^(1 / 2). The weighting factor favors collisions with larger relative velocity, and including it leads to more destructive and less sticking collisions. We compare two collision kernel formulations based on spherical and cylindrical geometries. The two formulations give consistent results for the collision rate and the collision-rate weighted statistics, except that the spherical formulation predicts more head-on collisions than the cylindrical formulation.
