500|$|Eurogamer's Chris Schilling {{commented that}} {{although}} Ancient Trader {{was not as}} comprehensive and expansive as other Xbox Live titles such as , it deserved [...] "the opportunity {{to do business with}} the big boys rather than risk getting washed away with the shovelware tide". Schilling expressed concern that [...] "a game so elegant and accomplished should have to be dredged up from the depths of Indie Games". Lorenzo Fantoni from Eurogamer Italy awarded Ancient Trader the same score as Schilling, and explained that [...] "the final result is a quite simple title, which will last long <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> feel happy of having invested your money in this indie title".|$|E
500|$|In contrast, The Hollywood Reporter quoted Rolling Stones Meredith Blake in her concert review {{saying she}} found it {{pointless}} to have those items onstage given the song's theme. Writing for NME, Emily MacKay did a live review of the singer's tour at the HMV Hammersmith Apollo in London during March 2011. She said that the spiritless [...] "Circle the Drain", [...] "Hummingbird Heartbeat" [...] and [...] "Who Am I Living For?" [...] were <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> feel somewhat {{like that of a}} [...] "fractious toddler having a series of expensive toys waved in its mottled face by a fretful aunt to keep it from deciding it wants to cry." ...|$|E

[...] The Times stated that whoever {{thought it was a}} good idea for will.i.am to participate in the song ought to be [...] "locked in a windowless cell with nothing but those songs on a continuous loop". PopMatters, however, praised Thriller 25 and the remix of [...] "The Girl Is Mine". They wrote, [...] "Any album good <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> forgive (although maybe not forget) a song as bad as the Paul McCartney duet 'The Girl is Mine' has got to be damn good." [...] They added that will.i.am had put a [...] "breezy spin" [...] on the track and that the song's omission of McCartney did not suffer because of it.|$|E

500|$|... ‘Chanderlier’ has {{received}} critical acclaim. Andrew Trendall from Gigwise {{wrote that the}} song [...] "springboards Sia from a behind-the-scenes genius into a superstar in her own right". Gordon from Pitchfork Media praised Sia's vocal performance on the track and commented that the track [...] "is <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> want to swing from a chandelier". Bradley Stern from the website MuuMuse labelled [...] "Chandelier" [...] the best pop single of 2014, complimenting Sia's songwriting credits and her voice on the song. In a VH1 article, Emily Exton shared that thought, deeming it the best song Sia had ever written. Writing for Time magazine, Jamieson Cox deemed [...] "Chandelier" [...] a [...] "disarming, unforgettable listen that'll make you glad Sia kept this one for herself." [...] In a less enthusiastic review, Melinda Newman from HitFix thought that Sia [...] "can {{do a lot better}} than this".|$|E

[...] He was of the opinion that if anyone should draw the line, the Internal Revenue Service should be the one. Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor, on the other hand, felt that residents were employees, as evidenced by her statement [...] "You don't think receiving $50,000 or $60,000 a year is <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> an employee of someone?" [...] According to The Wall Street Journal, Associate Justice Samuel Alito appeared to be more favorable to the medical schools, asking the Justice Department's lawyer at one point [...] "in general, why do medical students become residents? Are they enrolled in the program to make money...or do they want additional education?" ...|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weekly {{characterized}} the song as {{a sequel to}} Madonna's 1985 synthpop single [...] "Into the Groove". The publication listed [...] "Hella Good" [...] seventh on its list of the top singles of 2002. It went on to include the song in its list {{of the top five}} No Doubt songs, in which it described the song as [...] "a dance-pop delight irresistible <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> forget that hella is one of history's most irritating slang terms." [...] Stylus Magazine was pleased with the use of overdubbing in the song's [...] "anthemic rock chorus", but referred to its lyrics as stupid. [...] Billboard referred to the group as the B-52's of the 2000s and praised [...] "Hella Good"'s combination of a strong bassline; [...] "fairly aggressive electric guitar accents"; Kraftwerk-style electronics; and Stefani's [...] "loose, playful" [...] vocals. [...] The song was listed at number twenty-six on the 2002 Pazz & Jop list, a survey of several hundred music critics conducted by Robert Christgau.|$|E

500|$|The {{conclusion}} of the serial in March brought similar praise. [...] "Our Friends in the North confounded the gloomier predictions about its content and proved {{that there was an}} audience for political material, provided that it found its way to the screen through lives imagined in emotional detail... It will be remembered for an intimate sense of character, powerful <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> forgive its faults and stay loyal to the end," [...] was the verdict of The Independent on the final episode. Writing in the same newspaper the following day, Jeffrey Richards added that [...] "Monday night's final episode of Our Friends in the North has left many people bereft. The serial captivated much of the country, sketching a panoramic view of life in Britain from the sixties to the nineties... At once sweeping and intimate, both moving and angry, simultaneously historical and contemporary, it has followed in the distinguished footsteps of BBC series such as Boys from the Blackstuff." ...|$|E
500|$|Rene Rodriguez of The Miami Herald {{revealed}} that the film was from [...] "the John Hughes playbook of high-school comedies but lack the heart and insight Hughes invested in his pictures.", but still praised the teenage cast saying [...] "The performances in Bandslam are uniformly strong – good <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> wish this bunch of charismatic, talented kids had been given better material." [...] Time Out reviewer Derek Adams said that Bandslam is far from exceptional, but is saved by decent character development, a cluster of engaging performances and several amusing deadpan moments. Canada's The Globe and Mail reviewer's conclusion follows: [...] "Bandslam offers some nice observational and comedy moments, and director and co-writer Todd Graff deftly deliver the coming-of-age goods for the three main characters." [...] The Daily Telegraphs reviewer Leight Paastch says that the film gives the genre a right old spin thanks to some lively performances and sharp pacing.|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, [...] "City Girl" [...] {{received}} moderate critical acclaim. Pitchfork Media writer Mark Richardson {{said that}} [...] "on first listen {{it sounds like}} a demo of a pre-Loveless track, possibly from the You Made Me Realise era" [...] and while there was [...] "no exploration on that front … the melody and voice are familiar and welcome." [...] Writing for Stylus Magazine, Andrew Unterberger called [...] "City Girl" [...] "a worthy opener" [...] and added that [...] " [...] where Kevin's at right now—making pretty pop songs. There is so little to this song that it's almost <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> think Kevin's lost his mind." [...] Unterberger summarised the song as [...] "gorgeous, and definitely has that sighing quality to it that makes the film so delectable." [...] Exclaim! journalist Michael White noted that it was [...] "the indisputable highlight of the soundtrack" [...] and AllMusics Heather Phares described [...] "City Girl" [...] as an [...] "open-ended piece" [...] and [...] "naïve [...] guitar-driven" [...] but added that it did not compare to Shields' compositions on Loveless (1991).|$|E

5000|$|The film {{opened to}} {{generally}} positive reviews from UK critics. The Guardian writer Phelim O'Neill said, [...] "the violence is skilfully <b>enough</b> executed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> think you see {{much more than}} you actually do and the fundamentally disturbing and creepy aspects about such random and unpredictable child-centric mayhem are always present, no matter how ludicrously intense and darkly humorous things get".|$|R

500|$|Having {{attended}} the concerts six months before, Ed Kelleher of Circus magazine {{was relieved to}} discover that the live album didn't just do justice to the [...] "magic... the sheer joy" [...] of the event, but rather its music [...] "practically jumps right out into your life". After singling out as defining moments Dylan's [...] "Just Like a Woman" [...] ("it's <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> cry and smile at once"), Russell's medley and Harrison's [...] "Here Comes the Sun", along with the talents of Shankar– [...] "the most masterful and accomplished of them all"– Kelleher admitted to the futility of trying to identify [...] "individual highlights" [...] on an album that was [...] "one consistent high". In fact, almost every selection on the three-record set was named as a highlight by one reviewer or another: Preston's [...] "That's the Way God Planned It" [...] coming as a [...] "sheer delight" [...] to Landau, Harrison's [...] "Something" [...] especially [...] "delicate and moving" [...] to Playboys album reviewer, Dylan's [...] "A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall" [...] resonating most with Nicholas Schaffner, while to Richard Williams, [...] "Just Like a Woman" [...] was [...] "the masterpiece".|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called it [...] "a sleek, spooky collaboration with Kanye West", while Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone said the collaboration [...] "gel perfectly". Ben Kelly of Attitude said, [...] "West’s production makes a real moment" [...] and [...] "Her anti-Vogue rap of suspected Illuminati members {{is probably the}} only time Rihanna and Queen Elizabeth will feature side by side". Gavin Haynes of NME described it as [...] "classy, 'Vogue'-referencing". Randall Roberts of Los Angeles Times called it [...] "one of the record’s highlights," [...] saying, [...] "he raps during [...] and doesn’t sound totally ridiculous". He also said the track balances [...] "club frenzy and revelatory lyricism". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine said, [...] "West gives 'Illuminati' the Yeezus treatment...her rapped verses about the titular secret society are clean and tight <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> forget about 'American Life'". Kevin Ritchie of Now called it one of [...] "the most ambitious and interesting lyrically". Lindsay Zoladz of New York Daily News wrote that the song is [...] "just goofy enough to work".|$|E
500|$|The special episode {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} media critics. In his review for the Los Angeles Times, Robert Lloyd wrote, [...] "I felt I'd been somewhere, watching this. When it ended, I {{was not ready}} to leave." [...] David Hinckley of the New York Daily News wrote, [...] "It's <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> want to dream of a yellow Christmas." [...] Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club called the episode [...] "cute, and goofy and doesn't have a mean bone in its body." [...] Mark Frauenfelder of Boing Boing said that [...] "...they [...] perfectly captured {{the look and feel of}} those delightful old stop motion specials." [...] Judge Dawn Hunt of DVD Verdict called the episode [...] "a sweet holiday treat, punctuated by musical numbers that'll leave you smiling." [...] He added [...] "If you're looking for a new holiday viewing, 'It's a SpongeBob Christmas!' is definitely worthy of consideration." [...] Paul Mavis of DVD Talk applauded the episode but has doubts if it will become the classic that will be watched every season.

500|$|Zoe Williams {{reviewed}} the restaurant for The Daily Telegraph in 2010, after Burbidge became head chef. She found issues {{with some of}} the dishes, such as a mackerel which wasn't properly filleted, and some overcooked samphire. However she thought that the dessert was perfect, stating that [...] "It was <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> wonder why anybody ever makes custard without fennel". Fay Maschler visited the new establishment in April 2010 for the Evening Standard, who disagreed with the idea that it was a reopening and said that it instead should be considered to be a new Ramsay restaurant. She was impressed by the majority of the food, especially the desserts, however felt that the service was a little alien. [...] Marina O'Loughlin for the Metro in June 2010, thought that the food was fine and although the restaurant seems to have been entirely designed with gathering Michelin stars, it seemed that everything on the menu had been done somewhere else but better. Time Outs review of the restaurant rated it at four out of five stars, being impressed with the quality of the food and describing the wine selection as [...] "crammed with class".|$|E
500|$|James Poniewozik of The New York Times called Chopra the series' [...] "strongest human asset": [...] "She is {{immediately}} charismatic and commanding." [...] Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly called Quantico the best Shonda Rhimes drama that Rhimes never touched and wrote that [...] "Chopra's {{bound to be}} a breakout star." [...] Rob Lowman of the Los Angeles Daily News enjoyed the show and Chopra's performance, saying: [...] "Although a bit over-frenetic at times, the series seems to take inspiration from a man-on-the run Hitchcock thriller. Only in Quantico's case it's a woman, and they have a charismatic star in Chopra. I was immediately struck by her dynamic screen presence. So far it’s one of the most-promising new shows, and Chopra is someone worth keeping an eye on." [...] Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter, in a lukewarm review, found its pilot [...] "just good <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> watch another." [...] Although TheWrap's Tim Grierson wrote that the show [...] "provides sexy fun", [...] "For a show about highly trained, incredibly intelligent agents, Quantico often succumbs to lame-brained plotting and a less-than-convincing portrayal of its specialized milieu. This new show's fluffy, which doesn’t fit so well with the darker, somber tones meant to be struck by the introduction of a cataclysmic terrorist attack." ...|$|E
500|$|The New York Times {{reviewer}} Jeannette Catsoulis praised it {{for avoiding}} the dichotomy of [...] "corporate greed versus environmental well-being", adding {{that instead of}} being an exposé, [...] "Under the gentle, humane investigations of its director, what emerges most strongly is a portrait of exploitation that ought to make us more nauseated than elated over those $20 jeans". Tamsin Blanchard, for the Daily Telegraph, called it a work that will [...] "do for the fast fashion business what Food Inc did for fast food". The Hollywood Reporters Frank Scheck commended it for approaching an issue often [...] "untouched by major news organizations". He said the film was [...] "more despair-inducing than instructive", but was optimistic about its possible impact on the fashion culture, citing the effect that films such as Super Size Me and Fast Food Nation had on the fast food industry. Carson Quiros of Paste also compared it to the former film. David Noh of Film Journal International called it a [...] "vitally important documentary" [...] that contains scenes that [...] "are <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> never want to go shopping again". Gabrielle Wilson of MTV stated it is [...] "hard to swallow but never feels preach-y or like a barrage of depressive factoids" [...] and will empower viewers to change their shopping habits. Casey Jarman said she was disappointed by [...] "the only solution offered: eliminating global capitalism"; however, ultimately, she wrote for Willamette Week {{that it is a}} [...] "compelling film, which is, above all else, a badly needed conversation-starter".|$|E
6000|$|The {{sun rose}} red, {{the air was}} thick and hot. Anticipating that the day would be very oppressive, Vivian and Essper were on their horses' backs at an early hour. Already, however, many of the rustic revellers were about, and {{preparations}} were commencing for the fête champêtre, which this day was to close the wedding festivities. Many and sad were the looks which Essper George cast behind him at the old castle on the lake. [...] "No good luck can come of it!" [...] said he to his horse; for Vivian did not encourage conversation. [...] "O! master of mine, when wilt thou {{know the meaning of}} good quarters! To leave such a place, and at such a time!

500|$|Some reviewers {{said that}} the second act of the game, {{taking place in the}} less-structured portion of the old Aperture facilities, may be {{confusing}} to some players. Young wrote that in the second act, the game [...] "cranks up the difficulty level at a speed that may dishearten casual gamers", and said that particularly when traveling between chambers, he had [...] "absolutely no idea where I was supposed to head next". [...] Kohler wrote that while the player can explore the abandoned areas of Aperture, [...] "none of it ever does anythingit's just a lot of sterile, duplicated, non-interactive environments". Watters wrote that the loading time between the game's levels, in contrast to earlier Valve games, are [...] "long <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> take notice and wish they were shorter". Watters also said that it was unfortunate that the game lacks [...] "stand-alone test chambers and leaderboards...but even so, Portal 2 is not light on content" [...] without these. Welsh {{said that the}} attempt to recapture the spirit of the song [...] "Still Alive" [...] at the end credits of Portal 2 [...] "was a mistake". Video game critic Ben [...] "Yahtzee" [...] Croshaw named it the best game of 2011 in his review show Zero Punctuation. However he wrote in his Extra Punctuation column that, while Portal 2 was a [...] "very good game", it unnecessarily retconned portions of the origin game's story, and did not really further the game's concept. However, this criticism was directed solely at the campaign, and he stated that he found the game's co-op to be [...] "much more appealing and much more within the spirit of the original".|$|E
500|$|Reviews for the Saturn and PlayStation ports {{were mostly}} {{positive}} although some were mixed. Sam Hickman from the Sega Saturn Magazine {{commented that the}} game manages to be extremely creepy and terrifying despite having almost no bloodshed. He predicted that the game would be outclassed by Resident Evil (still in development {{at the time of}} the review), but concluded that D was the best horror game presently on the market. Four reviewers at Electronic Gaming Monthly commented that the Saturn version had reduced the load times seen in the 3DO version to almost nothing. They highly praised the storyline and intelligently designed puzzles, and described it as [...] "scary <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> an insomniac." [...] GamePro staff gave positive reviews for both the Saturn and PlayStation versions, recommending it to those looking for a horror experience. Maximum staff likewise gave positive reviews to both versions, saying that D is similar to Myst (1993) and Mansion of Hidden Souls (1993) but ultimately better due to its more enticing story. They also praised the FMV graphics and cinematic presentation, but criticized it for its lack of longevity. The reviewers felt its short length, addictive gameplay, and lack of overly challenging puzzles ensured that the player will be finished with it very quickly. A Next Generation reviewer gave the same praises for the scary storyline and graphics, and also said the puzzles [...] "are just challenging enough to satisfy and yet not so difficult as to impede your progress for very long." [...] However, he felt the slow character movement and lack of longevity kept the game from being truly exceptional. Staff at Game Informer were more critical in their review of the Saturn version. They found the gameplay tedious but did praise the graphics and the storytelling, concluding the [...] "story would make a great movie or book, but not a game." ...|$|E
2500|$|For {{the week}} of the final episode, the magazine's {{television}} editor, Alison Graham, joined in the praise, picking out individual cast members for particular attention. [...] "Anna Maxwell Martin as Esther was a superb heroine, but in years to come it's [...] Anderson's portrayal of a secretly tormented aristocrat that we'll treasure." [...] And of Charles Dance, [...] "As the scheming attorney-at-law, Dance was wolfishly lethal, his hooded eyes and sonorous voice loaded with evil.
