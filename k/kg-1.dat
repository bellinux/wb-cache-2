Although ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) coexist in most non-acidic agricultural soils, the factors that influence their relative contributions to soil nitrification activity remain unclear. A 2 - to 4 -d whole soil microcosm assay was developed, utilizing the aliphatic C₈ alkyne 1 -octyne to inactivate AOB-driven nitrification activity without impacting AOA nitrification activity. Responses of AOA- and AOB-supported net nitrification activities (accumulation of NO₂⁻ + NO₃⁻) to different concentrations of extractable NH₄⁺ were examined in four diverse, paired cropped and non-cropped Oregon soils sampled in summer and winter. Maximum AOA-supported net nitrification rates were significantly higher in non-cropped (3. 7 mg N <b>kg⁻¹</b> soil d⁻¹) than in cropped soils (0. 9 mg N <b>kg⁻¹</b> soil d⁻¹) and in summer (3. 1 mg N <b>kg⁻¹</b> soil d⁻¹) compared with winter soils (1. 6 mg N <b>kg⁻¹</b> soil d⁻¹). The NH₄⁺ concentration required to significantly stimulate AOB nitrification activity was significantly higher in cropped soils (67 mg N <b>kg⁻¹</b> soil) than in non-cropped soils (12 mg N <b>kg⁻¹</b> soil). Maximum AOB activity was significantly higher in cropped (8. 6 mg N <b>kg⁻¹</b> soil d⁻¹) than in non-cropped soils (2. 9 mg N <b>kg⁻¹</b> soil d⁻¹) and in summer (7. 8 mg N <b>kg⁻¹</b> soil d⁻¹) compared with winter soils (3. 8 mg N <b>kg⁻¹</b> soil d⁻¹).

40|$|Article first {{published}} online: 29 SEP 2014 Solvent-extracted soybean meal (SESBM) {{has been reported}} to cause subacute enteritis in certain fish species. Two 34 -day experiments investigated the effects of SESBM and soy protein concentrate (SPC) on the intestinal mucus layer and development of subacute enteritis in the hindgut of yellowtail kingfish (Seriola lalandi) at 22 and 18 °C. Fish were fed increasing levels of SESBM (Exp. 1 : 0 g <b>kg⁻¹,</b> 100 g <b>kg⁻¹,</b> 200 g <b>kg⁻¹,</b> 300 g <b>kg⁻¹)</b> and SPC (Exp. 2 : 0 g <b>kg⁻¹,</b> 200 g <b>kg⁻¹,</b> 300 g kg ⁻¹, 400 g <b>kg⁻¹.</b> No visual signs of inflammation in the hindgut were observed in either experiment. However, increasing dietary SESBM significantly reduced mucus layer thickness. Neutral and acidic goblet cell mucin composition increased at 18 and 22 °C, respectively. A significant positive linear relationship was evident between goblet cell number and SESBM inclusion at 18 °C. SPC inclusion and water temperature had no significant effect on mucus layer thickness or mucin composition. However, at 18 °C, goblet cell numbers decreased with SPC inclusion. Results suggest the early stages of subacute enteritis may have been manifesting in SESBM fed fish. In the long term, mucus layer alterations associated with feeding SESBM may compromise fish health. Longer-term studies should investigate the effects of feeding SESBM to yellowtail kingfish, particularly at suboptimal water temperatures. M. S. Bansemer, R. E. A. Forder,G. S. Howarth, G. M.

40|$|Objectives: To {{examine the}} effect of a high {{carbohydrate}} meal on serum caffeine concentration following caffeine intake. Design: Randomised, double-blind, crossover. Methods: Fourteen healthy males randomly completed 4 trials, each separated by 5 days. Participants either remained fasted (on 2 occasions) or ingested a high carbohydrate meal (2. 0 g <b>kg⁻¹</b> carbohydrate, 42. 4 ± 0. 6 kJ <b>kg⁻¹)</b> prior to consuming either 6 or 9 mg <b>kg⁻¹</b> anhydrous caffeine. Venous blood was sampled for the analysis of serum caffeine at baseline and at 6 time-points over 4 h following caffeine intake. Results: Peak caffeine concentration occurred 60 min following ingestion for both the 6 and 9 mg <b>kg⁻¹</b> fasted (p p p < 0. 001) in the 9 mg <b>kg⁻¹</b> fasted trial (3262 μmol L⁻¹ h⁻¹), whilst areas were lowest in the 6 mg <b>kg⁻¹</b> fed trial (1644 μmol L⁻¹ h⁻¹).

40|$|Regulation {{of manure}} {{application}} in Manitoba {{has raised the}} question of whether or not biosolids application should be regulated in the same way. This study examined the effects of biosolids (BIO) applications on P sorption characteristics of a Vertisol in comparison with dairy cattle (DAIRY) and hog (HOG) manures, and monoammonium phosphate (MAP) fertilizer using the classical sorption isotherm and single point sorption index. Pertinent chemical properties and degree of P saturation (DPS) were also determined. The sorption maximum (Smax) in the control was reduced from 655 mg <b>kg⁻¹,</b> to a range of 536 – 655 mg <b>kg⁻¹</b> with BIO, 559 – 650 mg <b>kg⁻¹</b> with MAP, 402 – 568 mg <b>kg⁻¹</b> with DAIRY, and 350 – 587 mg <b>kg⁻¹</b> with HOG depending upon the rate of P added.

Two oilseed rape genotypes had a differential response to Zn application. Xinxa 2 responded significantly for shoot and root dry matter only up to 0. 1 mg applied Zn <b>kg⁻¹</b> soil, while 92 – 13 responded up to 0. 2 mg Zn <b>kg⁻¹</b> soil. Zinc at 10 mg <b>kg⁻¹</b> soil slightly reduced shoot dry matter and drastically reduced root dry matter of both the genotypes. Shoot and root dry matter production at 0, 0. 1, 0. 2, and 1 mg Zn <b>kg⁻¹</b> soil were significantly greater under high P supply compared with low P supply. High P supply did not accentuate Zn deficiency symptoms compared with low P supply even at nil Zn. Phosphorus concentration in plant parts was significantly higher at nil Zn compared with Zn application. An increase in P supply had a non‐significant effect on Zn concentration, but significantly increased the P concentration and P uptake in shoots.

40|$|OBJETIVO: O objetivo do estudo foi determinar o gasto energético (GE) em termos de gasto calórico e equivalente metabólico (MET) de duas sessões de um protocolo de exercício. MÉTODOS: Quinze indivíduos adultos (51, 0 ± 5, 5 anos) realizaram as sessões de exercício (80 min), compostas por (aquecimento, caminhada e flexibilidade; Sessão A) e (aquecimento, caminhada e resistência muscular local; Sessão B). A frequência cardíaca (FC) foi medida durante cada parte da sessão. Em laboratório, foram medidos, em dias diferentes, o consumo máximo de oxigênio (VO 2 max), durante repouso e exercício (usando a FC média obtida nas aulas), por calorimetria indireta. O MET dos exercícios foi obtido dividindo VO 2 em exercício (mL. <b>kg-¹.</b> min-¹) pelo VO 2 em repouso (mL. <b>kg-¹.</b> min-¹). O GE dos exercícios foi calculado por: MET x Peso (kg) x Tempo (min) / 60. RESULTADOS: Os resultados foram analisados por ANOVA com teste {{post hoc}} de Tukey (p 0, 05). Nenhuma atividade foi classificada como vigorosa (> 7 METs).

OBJECTIVE: Determine the energy {{expenditure}} (EE) {{in terms of}} caloric cost and metabolic equivalents (METs) of two sessions of an exercise protocol. METHODS: Fifteen subjects (51. 0 ± 5. 5 years) performed the exercise sessions (80 min), composed of warm-up, walking and flexibility exercises (Session A) and warm-up, walking and local muscular endurance exercises (Session B). Heart hate (HR) was measured during {{each part of the}} sessions. In laboratory environment, maximal oxygen consumption (VO 2 max) and oxygen uptake at rest and exercise conditions (using mean HR obtained in classes) were measured on different days, using indirect calorimetry. Exercise METs were obtained by dividing VO 2 in exercise (mL. <b>kg-¹.</b> min-¹) by VO 2 at rest (mL. <b>kg-¹.</b> min-¹). The EE of the exercises was calculated by the formula: MET x Weight (kg) x Time (min) / 60. The results were analyzed by ANOVA with Tukey post hoc test (p 0. 05).

Methods Cardiovascular responses to epinephrine infusion (0. 05 - 0. 5 mcg <b>kg⁻¹</b> min⁻¹) were measured in rats using arterial and left ventricular catheters. Epinephrine and cAMP levels were measured using ELISA techniques. Results The lowest dose of epinephrine infusion (0. 05 mcg <b>kg⁻¹</b> min⁻¹) did not raise plasma epinephrine levels and did not lead to cardiovascular response. Incremental increase in epinephrine infusion (0. 1 mcg <b>kg⁻¹</b> min⁻¹) elevated plasma but not myocardial epinephrine levels, providing vascular, but not cardiac effects. Further increase in the infusion rate (0. 2 mcg <b>kg⁻¹</b> min⁻¹) raised myocardial tissue epinephrine levels sufficient to increase heart rate but not contractility. Inotropic and lusitropic effects were significant at the infusion rate of 0. 3 mcg <b>kg⁻¹</b> min⁻¹. Correlation of plasma epinephrine to haemodynamic parameters suggest that as plasma concentration increases, systemic vascular resistance falls (EC 50 = 47 pg/ml), then HR increases (ED 50 = 168 pg/ml), followed by a rise in contractility and lusitropy (ED 50 = 346 pg/ml and ED 50 = 324 pg/ml accordingly). Conclusions The dose response of epinephrine is distinct for vascular tone, HR and contractility. The need for higher doses to see cardiac effects is likely due to the threshold for drug accumulation in tissue. Successful inotropic support with epinephrine cannot be achieved unless the infusion is sufficient to raise the heart rate...|$|E
40|$|Commingled {{municipal}} solid waste (MSW) was autoclaved {{in the presence of}} saturated steam for 30 min at 145 °C and 600 kPa. The organic fibre fraction from the autoclaved resulting material was examined for biodegradability. Aerobic and anaerobic tests were carried out to characterise the fibre in terms of biodegradation potential, which was moderate (biogas production potential of 251 ± 22 l [biogas] <b>kg⁻¹</b> [total solids (TS) ] and dynamic respiration index (DRI) of 1575 ± 116 mg [O 2] <b>kg⁻¹</b> [TS] h⁻¹). Manual and chemical characterisations were also performed to organic fibre. Following this characterisation, a laboratory-scale thermophilic anaerobic digestion process and a pilot-scale composting process were carried out to determine the possibilities of these biological treatments. In the anaerobic digestion process the biogas yield values obtained were within 0. 15 – 0. 21 m³ [biogas] <b>kg⁻¹</b> [volatile solids (VS) ] with an organic loading rate (OLR) of 3 kg [VS] m⁻³ d⁻¹. However, it was difficult to reach the steady state in the anaerobic thermophilic process for the different organic loads tested. Further experiments are necessary to determine the optimal biogas production and performance under these conditions. The composting process performed correctly and the final material was stable (DRI of 504 ± 74 mg [O 2] <b>kg⁻¹</b> [TS] h⁻¹) and with good properties for its application to soil regarding heavy metal contents that corresponding to class B compost, with the exception of some metals that corresponded to class A...|$|E
40|$|International audienceGamma {{irradiation}} is {{a common}} process mostly used for sterilization against bacteria growth. However, when the process is applied to a material, physical and chemical changes may alter its integrity and behaviour. The {{aim of this study}} was to observe the effect of γ-irradiation on the surface chemistry of CNCs. The carbonyl content (both carboxylic acid and aldehyde functionalities) was followed to investigate the influence of the irradiation dose. Thermal stability, wettability and antioxidant properties were also measured. Conductometric titration showed that the carboxylic acid groups content (COOH) was increased from 43 mmol COOH <b>kg⁻¹</b> CNCs for native CNCs to 631 mmol COOH <b>kg⁻¹</b> CNCs when a dose of 80 kGy was applied. These changes were confirmed by FTIR and fluorescence spectroscopy. At high irradiation doses, a significant decrease of approximately 30 % was observed in the cellulose degree of polymerization while the aldehyde groups content was increased to 379 mmol CHO <b>kg⁻¹</b> CNCs due to the cleavage of glycosidic linkages. These physicochemical changes led to enhanced antioxidant properties of CNCs...|$|E
