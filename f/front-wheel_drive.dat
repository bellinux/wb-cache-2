5|$|In December 2013, Holden {{announced}} that it would cease its local production by October 2017 committing, however, to use the long-standing Commodore nameplate on its fifth-generation fully imported replacement, moving to a <b>front-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> (FWD) platform.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of launch in Australia, Ford's BF Falcon {{directly}} competed with the VE Commodore. In November 2006 Toyota released their key Aurion model to the Australian market. The <b>front-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> Mitsubishi 380 also indirectly competed with the Holden Commodore but has since been discontinued.|$|E
5|$|Between the {{extremes}} of bicycles with classical front-wheel steering and those with strictly rear-wheel steering is a class of bikes with a pivot point somewhere between the two, referred to as center-steering, and similar to articulated steering. An early implementation of the concept was the Phantom bicycle in the early 1870s promoted as a safer alternative to the penny-farthing. This design allows for simple <b>front-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> and current implementations appear to be quite stable, even rideable no-hands, as many photographs illustrate.|$|E
50|$|HydroGen3 is an Opel {{hydrogen}} fuel cell vehicle used for testing. HydroGen3’s 400 km driving range is the highest of any fuel cell vehicle approved for public roads in Japan. The five seater <b>front-wheel</b> <b>driven</b> prototype {{is based on the}} Opel Zafira compact MPV.|$|R
50|$|Inboard brakes are {{fitted to}} a driven axle of the car, as they require a drive shaft {{to link the}} wheel to the brake. Most have thus been used for rear-wheel drive cars, {{although}} four-wheel <b>drive</b> and some <b>front-wheel</b> <b>drives</b> have also used them. A rare few rear wheel drive racing cars (e.g., the Lotus 72) have also used inboard front discs, accepting {{the need to provide}} a drive shaft to gain the unsprung weight and braking torque advantages.|$|R
50|$|In December 1930, Adler {{assigned}} the German engineer Josef Ganz, {{who was also}} editor-in-chief of Motor-Kritik magazine, as a consultant engineer. In {{the first months of}} 1931, Ganz constructed a lightweight Volkswagen prototype at Adler with a tubular chassis, a mid-mounted engine, and independent wheel suspension with swing-axles at the rear. After completion in May 1931, Ganz nicknamed his new prototype Maikäfer (May Beetle). After a shift in management at Adler, further development of the Maikäfer was stopped as the company's new technical director Hans Gustav Röhr concentrated on <b>front-wheel</b> <b>driven</b> cars.|$|R
5|$|PSA {{decided that}} the Linwood plant would be {{unprofitable}} to maintain and should be closed, which meant an end to both the Avenger and Sunbeam model lines, further emphasizing {{the need for a}} new small car in the Talbot lineup. On the eve of the 1980s, PSA's city cars lineup consisted of models based on the veteran <b>front-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> 1972 Peugeot 104, which came in a shorter three-door and longer five-door version. Citroën rebadged the short-wheelbase 104 as the Citroën LN, and the long-wheelbase chassis formed the base of the five-door Citroën Visa.|$|E
5|$|The Sunbeam was {{originally}} conceived by Chrysler as a stopgap model, developed {{to keep the}} Linwood works running—it {{was based on the}} running gear of the earlier Avenger made there—while helping the company to maintain a foothold in the growing small car market. Aware that a more modern design was needed to compete with upcoming <b>front-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> rivals, Chrysler undertook some development work on a shortened version of the Chrysler Horizon (which had the development code C2), dubbed C2-short, but it was cut short by the company's financial problems and plans to divest Chrysler Europe.|$|E
5|$|The mid-engine {{complicated}} {{the design of}} the four-wheel drive system, and an innovative solution was needed to get drive {{from the rear of the}} engine to the front wheels. The chosen design took the <b>front-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> from the central differential on the rear transaxle and sent it through the V in the centre of the engine using a quill drive, before joining an inverted differential. The clutch was a twin-plate unit designed by AP Racing.|$|E

40|$|The {{usefulness}} in control {{theory of the}} geometric theory of motion on Lie groups and homogeneous spaces will be shown. We quickly review some recent results concerning two methods {{to deal with these}} systems, namely, a generalization of the method proposed by Wei and Norman for linear systems, and a reduction procedure. This last method allows us to reduce the equation on a Lie group $G$ to that on a subgroup $H$, provided a particular solution of an associated problem in $G/H$ is known. These methods are shown to be very appropriate to deal with control systems on Lie groups and homogeneous spaces, through the specific examples of the planar rigid body with two oscillators and the <b>front-wheel</b> <b>driven</b> kinematic car.

50|$|Recumbents can be {{categorized}} by their wheelbase, wheel sizes, steering system, faired or unfaired, and <b>front-wheel</b> or rear-wheel <b>drive.</b>|$|R
5|$|Toyota {{launched}} the Aurion in Australasia, where it competes with the rear-wheel drive Ford Falcon, Holden Commodore, and the now discontinued <b>front-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> Mitsubishi 380. The TRD variants were pitched {{to compete with}} the Subaru Liberty GT and Mazda 6 MPS. Since its introduction, the Aurion has received numerous awards and positive reviews. In particular, the car has been praised for its good performance mated with comparatively low fuel consumption, and the inclusion of safety and comfort features that are optional on competitor vehicles.|$|E
5|$|In the Australasian and Middle Eastern markets, {{to further}} {{differentiate}} the Aurion from its Camry sibling, Toyota equipped the Aurion exclusively with a 3.5-litre V6 engine. With the Camry, the company only offered the 2.4-litre four-cylinder version. Previously in these markets, {{prior to the}} introduction of the Camry XV40, Toyota had offered both four- and a six-cylinder powerplants. Along with the naturally aspirated version, Toyota produced an Australia-only supercharged TRD Aurion between 2007 and 2009 as tuned by Toyota Racing Development (TRD). At its release, Toyota claimed this performance variant to be the world's most powerful <b>front-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> car. The powertrains used in the Asian specification Camry vary slightly from those of the Aurion. As well as the 3.5-litre V6, two four-cylinder engines are offered in either 2.0- or a 2.4-litre form. These engines are teamed with a six-, four- and five-speed automatic transmissions, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Through the 2000s (decade), most Lexus {{sedan and}} SUV {{production}} {{has occurred in}} Japan at the Tahara plant in Aichi and Miyata plant in Fukuoka. In addition to the Tahara factory, Lexus vehicles have been produced at the Miyata plant (Toyota Motor Kyushu, Inc.) in Miyawaka, Fukuoka, Higashi Fuji plant (Kanto Auto Works, Ltd.) in Susono, Shizuoka, and Sanage plant (Toyota Boshoku Corp.; Araco) in Toyota City, Aichi. <b>Front-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> cars, such as the ES and HS, are produced in the Fukuoka Prefecture. The Kokura plant in Kitakyushu, Fukuoka, which opened in 2008, is a dedicated hybrid production site for Lexus models such as the gasoline-electric RX. The North American–market RX 350 (since the 2004 model year) is produced at the Cambridge plant (Toyota Canada, Inc.) {{in the city of}} Cambridge, in Ontario, Canada, which is the first Lexus production site located outside Japan. In late 2015, Lexus started to assemble North American-spec ES 350 sedans at the Georgetown plant (TMMK, Inc.).|$|E

5000|$|... 2002 and 2003 saw now Champion-sponsored Rydquist {{visit the}} one-spec series Swedish Junior Touring Car Challenge with MH Motorsport in a <b>front-wheel</b> <b>driven</b> Volvo S40 JTCC car {{as well as}} adding ground-effects {{experience}} to his merits when racing in the Scandinavian Sports Racing Car Challenge. Rydquist's laptimes in the JTCC Volvo topped those of his two teammates in his first practice and in his second race weekend he won a podium position after taking 4th in two earlier heats. Rydquist also collected more points during his second weekend in JTCC than both his teammates. Racing a Radical the Scandinavian Sports Racing Car Challenge, Rydquist set faster laptimes than both of his teammates and took a podium finish in his first race weekend in this car type (in his 2nd event Rydquist made an advancement to 8th from 16th starting position stemming from mechanical failure in qualifying). In 2003 Rydquist also qualified an ex-BTCC BMW M3 in 3rd place in a Swedish Endurance Racing Series event.|$|R

25|$|Alvis was {{a pioneer}} of <b>front-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> vehicles. While J. Walter Christie had {{designed}} the first <b>front-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> race car, which he drove in the 1906 Vanderbilt Cup, the next notable <b>front-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> race car was the supercharged Alvis 12/50 racing car designed by G. T. Smith-Clarke and W. M. Dunn, which was entered in the 1925 Kop Hill Climb in Princes Risborough in Buckinghamshire on 28 March 1925. Two months later (on Saturday, 30 May 1925), Harry Arminius Miller's Miller 122 <b>front-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> car was entered in the 1925 Indianapolis 500.|$|E
25|$|In Europe, the Bluebird {{was joined}} in 1981 by the similar-sized Stanza, which gave Nissan buyers the {{alternative}} option of <b>front-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> and a hatchback body style {{for the first}} time, as <b>front-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> hatchbacks were by now overtaking rear-wheel drive saloons in popularity.|$|E

Also, the car has the ability to switch the power from <b>front-wheel</b> to rear-wheel <b>drive.</b>|$|R
50|$|As it {{requires}} a drive shaft, the Chapman strut can only be used at the driven end of the vehicle. For the Lotus designs to which it was applied, this was their rear. MacPherson struts are most commonly used for front suspension and the strut axis forms the kingpin bearing, for steering movement. There is little reason why a Chapman strut {{could not be used}} similarly, although there is no record of this being tried on a <b>front-wheel</b> or four-wheel <b>drive</b> car. Both designs are struts, where the strut base is rigidly attached to the hub carrier.|$|R
