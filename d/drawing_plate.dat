5000|$|Modern wire is {{manufactured}} {{in a different}} process that was discovered in Ancient Rome. In this process, a solid metal cylinder is pulled through a <b>draw</b> <b>plate</b> with holes of a defined size.

40|$|Footprint {{analysis}} of brush-pen {{is an important}} part of studying Chinese drawing and painting. The designed platform is capable to capture and {{analysis of}} the brush footprint in real-time. Transparent <b>drawing</b> <b>plate</b> and an underneath camera system are installed, together with projective rectification and video segmentation algorithms, analog footprint can be transformed to digital data. Both non-parametric and parametric modeling on the captured footprint data will be explored in this thesis. Dynamics and time-delay will also be studied. The results are demonstrated by producing a well-known Chinese calligraphy in our study. Robot drawing is an integrated study in the fields of robotics, machine intelligence, genetic algorithms (GA), rule base techniques, and expert system, etc. Besides looking into sophisticated methods in manipulator planning and control, robot drawing also aims to fulfill a human desire to put creativity in machines and to explore a basic question: can art be programmed? In this thesis, we report on the design and construction of a robot platform in our laboratory geared toward the production of Chinese painting and calligraphy which we will use to explore some of the above issues. This thesis aims to report on the design and development of a robot drawing platform supporting a pen motion with five degrees of freedom (x, y, and z translation, z-rotation, and pitch) of a brush-pen motion in our laboratory. The platform is interfaced with a camera system and a writing tablet via a window based PC. The integration programming language is Visual Basic 6, with direct access to MATLAB for image processing and the needed computation. The objective of design is to have a platform that is highly accurate and repeatability, easy to command, versatile and user friendly, etc. This thesis also describes the addition of vision-based capabilities in the platform. Those vision feedback measures have to be calibrated by using optimization method or Genetic Algorithm. Various examples of how the vision information can be used to improve various aspects of the drawing quality in iterative drawing will be demonstrated. by Lo, Ka Wah. "August 2007.

5000|$|A wire is a single, usually cylindrical, {{flexible}} strand or rod of metal. Wires {{are used}} to bear mechanical loads or electricity and telecommunications signals. Wire is commonly formed by drawing the metal {{through a hole in}} a die or <b>draw</b> <b>plate.</b> Wire gauges come in various standard sizes, as expressed in terms of a gauge number. The term wire is also used more loosely to refer to a bundle of such strands, as in [...] "multistranded wire", which is more correctly termed a wire rope in mechanics, or a cable in electricity.|$|R

Grönvold also completed numerous plates for Walter Rothschild, many of which appeared in Rothschild's journal Novitates Zoologicae. Grönvold mostly illustrated birds and eggs, rare and newly discovered species from {{many parts of the}} world, and mostly worked in lithographs. His egg plates include some of great auk eggs made for Alfred Newton. He made some depictions of mammals as well, and the Natural History Museum collection has oil paintings of apes he made for Rothschild.|$|R
2500|$|The {{wire drawing}} process is quite simple in concept. The wire is {{prepared}} by shrinking {{the beginning of}} it, by hammering, filing, rolling or swaging, {{so that it will}} fit through the die; the wire is then pulled through the die. As the wire is pulled through the die, its volume remains the same, so as the diameter decreases, the length increases. Usually the wire will require more than one draw, through successively smaller dies, to reach the desired size. The American wire gauge scale is based on this. This can be done on a small scale with a <b>draw</b> <b>plate,</b> or on a large commercial scale using automated machinery. [...] The process of wire drawing changes material properties due to cold working.|$|R

50|$|Wire gauges may be broadly {{divided into}} two groups, the {{empirical}} and the geometric. The first includes all the older gauge measurements, notably the Birmingham (B.W.G. or Stubs) and the Lancashire. The origin of the B.W.G. is obscure. The numbers of wire were in common use earlier than 1735. It is believed that they originally {{were based on the}} series of drawn wires, No. 1 being the original rod, and succeeding numbers corresponding with each draw, so that No. 10, for example, would have passed ten times through the <b>draw</b> <b>plate.</b> But the Birmingham and the Lancashire gauge, the latter being based on an averaging of the dimensions collated from a large number of the former in the possession of Peter Stubs of Warrington, have long held the leading position, and are still retained and used probably {{to a greater extent than}} the more recent geometrical gauges.|$|R

5000|$|Since {{it is made}} of metal, wire {{has this}} same {{hardness}} property. Most modern manufacturers of jewelry wire make the wire with a defined hardness, generally a hardness of 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Historically, these numbers {{were associated with the}} number of times that the wire was pulled through a <b>draw</b> <b>plate,</b> becoming harder or stiffer each time it was drawn through the drawplate. A hardness of 0 meant that the wire had been drawn through only once and was as soft and as pliable as possible. A hardness of 4 meant that the wire had been drawn through five or more times and the wire was as stiff and as hard as possible. Most jewelry wire that is sold now is designated dead soft, half-hard, or hard, where dead soft is wire that is manufactured with a hardness of 0, half-hard is wire manufactured with a hardness of 2, and fully hardened wire is wire with a hardness of 4.|$|R
