25|$|Castro's Cuban {{government}} {{ordered the}} country's oil refineries – then controlled by US corporations Esso and Standard Oil and Anglo-Dutch Shell – to process crude oil purchased from the Soviet Union, but {{under pressure from}} the US government, these companies refused. Castro responded by expropriating the refineries and nationalizing them under state control. In retaliation, the US canceled its import of Cuban sugar, provoking Castro to nationalize most US-owned assets, including banks and sugar mills. Relations between Cuba and the US were further strained following the explosion and sinking of a French vessel, the Le Coubre, in Havana harbor in March 1960. The cause of the explosion was never determined, but Castro publicly insinuated that the US government were guilty of sabotage. On 13 October 1960, the US government then prohibited the majority of exports to Cuba – the exceptions being medicines and certain foodstuffs – marking the start of an economic embargo. In retaliation, the Cuban National Institute for Agrarian Reform took control of 383 private-run businesses on 14 October, and on 25 October a further 166 US companies operating in Cuba had their premises seized and nationalized, including Coca-Cola and Sears Roebuck. On 16 December, the US then ended its <b>import</b> <b>quota</b> of Cuban sugar.|$|E

The ship carried weapons purchased from Belgium, {{the cause of the}} explosion was never determined, but Castro publicly insinuated that the U.S. government were guilty of sabotage. He ended this speech with [...] "¡Patria o Muerte!" [...] ("Fatherland or Death"), a proclamation that he made much use of in ensuing years. Inspired by their earlier success with the 1954 Guatemalan coup d'état, in March 1960, U.S. President Eisenhower authorized the CIA to overthrow Castro's government. He provided them with a budget of $13 million and permitted them to ally with the Mafia, who were aggrieved that Castro's government closed down their brothel and casino businesses in Cuba. On October 13, 1960, the U.S. prohibited the majority of exports to Cuba, initiating an economic embargo. In retaliation, the National Institute for Agrarian Reform INRA took control of 383 private-run businesses on October 14, and on October 25 a further 166 U.S. companies operating in Cuba had their premises seized and nationalized.

2500|$|The {{aftermath}} of the Bay of Pigs invasion and events involving Cuba that followed caused the US to feel threatened by their neighbor. [...] Previous to the events at Playa Girón the US government imposed embargoes that limited trade with Cuba. An article that appeared in The New York Times on 6 January 1960 called trade with Cuba [...] "too risky" [...] and about six months later in July 1960, the US reduced the <b>import</b> <b>quota</b> of Cuban sugar, which left the US to increase its sugar supply using other sources. Just following the Bay of Pigs invasion the Kennedy Administration considered complete trade restrictions with Cuba. Five months later the president was authorized to do so. After Cuba’s declaration of Marxism, the Kennedy administration imposed a complete trade embargo against Cuba. After the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 the Kennedy Administration imposed strict travel restrictions for U.S. citizens.|$|E

40|$|International audienceBackground. Denmark {{decreased}} its tax on spirits by 45 % on October 1 st 2003. Shortly thereafter, on January 1 st 2004, Sweden {{increased its}} <b>import</b> <b>quotas</b> of privately <b>imported</b> alcohol, allowing travellers {{to bring in}} much larger amounts of alcohol from other EU countries. Whereas these changes were assumed to increase alcohol-related harm in Sweden, and in particular among people living close to Denmark, analyses based on survey data collected before and after these changes have not supported this. The present paper test whether alcohol-related harm in southern Sweden was further affected by these changes by analysing other indicators of alcohol-related harm, e. g. harm recorded in different kinds of registers. Methods. Interrupted time-series analysis taking the effect of interventions into consideration was performed with monthly data on cases of hospitalizations due to acute alcohol poisoning, number of reported violent assaults and drunk driving for the years 2000 - 2007. The final model also controlled for variations in harm in the northern parts of Sweden {{as well as two}} earlier major changes in quotas. Results. The findings indicate increases in acute alcohol poisonings for southern Sweden, at least in relation to the change in private <b>import</b> <b>quotas.</b> The other harm indicators, reported number of violent assaults and drunk driving, do not seem to have been affected by the decrease in Danish spirits tax or the increase in Swedish alcohol <b>import</b> <b>quotas.</b> Conclusions.

We utilize a panel of 227 manufacturing industries between 1960 and 1969. We find that on the one hand, the removal of de facto <b>import</b> <b>quotas</b> had significantly negative effects on real output, real output per establishment, and employment. On the other hand, for those industries where <b>import</b> <b>quotas</b> were removed, tariff protection was effective in maintaining real output and employment.

In that sense, the industrial policy change had limited effects...|$|R
40|$|This paper uses a {{numerical}} {{general equilibrium model}} to examine the quantitative importance of pre-existing factor tax distortions for the welfare effects of tariffs and <b>import</b> <b>quotas.</b> The presence of pre-existing taxes can greatly raise the costs of these policies, possibly by over several hundred percent. For a tariff much of this extra cost can be offset if tariff revenues are used to reduce distortionary taxes. Hence {{there can be a}} large cost discrepancy between tariffs and quotas. The optimal tariff for a country with market power in trade can be reduced to zero, unless revenues finance cuts in distortionary taxes.
