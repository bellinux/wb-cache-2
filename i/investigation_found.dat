5|$|The <b>investigation</b> <b>found</b> {{that the}} level gauge had stuck at random times after a tank service in August 2005, {{but it did not}} concern {{maintenance}} contractors or site management. The independent shut-off switch was not fitted with a critical padlock to allow its check lever to work. Secondary containment (meant to trap the petrol in a retaining wall around the tank) failed and allowed petrol to flow out. Tertiary containment (drains and catchment areas to prevent release of spilled chemicals to the environment) also failed, and fuel and firefighting foam entered groundwater supplies. The <b>investigation</b> <b>found</b> secondary and tertiary containment to be inadequately designed and poorly maintained.|$|E
5|$|An <b>investigation</b> <b>found</b> several {{shortcomings}} in the airline's operating procedures, in particular lack of proper cockpit communication and mutual {{control of the}} descent and approach plans. This was in part caused by the airline electing to not follow the Sterile Cockpit Rule and that a passenger {{was sitting in a}} cockpit jump seat during the flight. The investigating commission also found lack of proper pilot training in the airline. Flight 710 was the second of four Widerøe accidents between 1982 and 1993, all of which revealed {{shortcomings in}} the airline's operations and internal control.|$|E
5|$|An <b>investigation</b> <b>found</b> that a {{non-return}} valve in the fuel system had been installed {{the wrong way}} round causing two of the engines to be starved of fuel. The technician found responsible for incorrectly fitting the valve was charged under the Air Force Act. Following the accident, the {{non-return valve}} was re-designed so {{it could not be}} installed incorrectly.|$|E
50|$|Additional <b>investigations</b> <b>found</b> more {{problems}} with the design and construction of the London Avenue Canal, Industrial Canal, MRGO, and other levees and flood walls.|$|R
50|$|The final {{manager of}} Napier's Marineland, Gary Macdonald, {{resigned}} on 18 November 2009 after 32 years at Marineland after <b>investigations</b> <b>found</b> he falsified documentation to keep wild animals illegally.|$|R
25|$|Subsequent <b>investigations</b> <b>found</b> {{more than}} 100 kilns. They are {{clustered}} into seven groups, namely Asan-Kamuiyaki, Asan-Yanagida (South), Asan-Yanagida (North), Isen-Higashiyanagida, Isen-Hirasuko, Kenpuku-Iyagawa and Kenpuku-Utta. In 2007, they were {{designated as a}} national historic site.|$|R
5|$|During the 1990s, {{the company}} {{was the subject of}} {{controversy}} for its official stance against gay and lesbian employees and for discriminatory practices against African-American customers and female employees. In 2004, a U.S. Department of Justice (USDOJ) <b>investigation</b> <b>found</b> that Cracker Barrel discriminated against minority customers; patrons complained of racially segregated seating and service quality. In an agreement with the USDOJ, Cracker Barrel implemented non-discrimination policies and pledged to focus on improving minority representation and civic involvement, particularly in the black community. Company shareholders added sexual orientation to the company's non-discrimination policy in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Following Italy's September 1911 {{invasion}} of Libya, al-Qassam began collecting funds in Jableh {{for the joint}} Ottoman-Libyan resistance movement and composed a victory anthem. Jableh's district governor sought to gain control over the fundraiser and when locals nevertheless continued to send their donations to al-Qassam, he attempted to have him jailed. The district governor alleged that al-Qassam was working against the Ottoman state, but an official <b>investigation</b> <b>found</b> him not guilty and the governor was consequently dismissed.|$|E
5|$|In April 1885, the Cosmos Club {{considered}} {{purchasing the}} house from the Tayloe family. The influential club already owned most of the block north of the Tayloe House, and was expanding rapidly. It valued the home at $60,000 and the furnishings at an additional $5,000. The Cosmos Club declined to buy the home after an <b>investigation</b> <b>found</b> {{that the cost of}} upgrading the Tayloe property for its use would be too costly.|$|E
25|$|Other {{considerations}} as to {{the cause}} of the collapse included design of the superstructure, quality of materials and construction, and inspection and maintenance. <b>Investigations</b> <b>found</b> that these factors did not contribute to the collapse.|$|R
50|$|Subsequent <b>investigations</b> <b>found</b> {{more than}} 100 kilns. They are {{clustered}} into seven groups, namely Asan-Kamuiyaki, Asan-Yanagida (South), Asan-Yanagida (North), Isen-Higashiyanagida, Isen-Hirasuko, Kenpuku-Iyagawa and Kenpuku-Utta.

2500|$|A secret unit called Yamlam ( [...] , Yehida Merkazit LeHakirot Meyuhadot, lit. Central Unit for Special <b>Investigations),</b> <b>founded</b> in 1982, which conducts {{high profile}} investigations. Some are done {{together}} with the Israel Police and the Shabak.|$|R
5|$|On March 8, 2013, the {{engineering}} firm NORR, {{commissioned by the}} Ontario Provincial Police, released {{the results of their}} forensic engineering investigation to the Elliot Lake Inquiry. The <b>investigation</b> <b>found</b> that the collapse was caused by a two-stage failure of the welding on a connection, due to extensive corrosion. The corrosion was caused by improper waterproofing and the placement of a parking lot on the roof, which allowed water, contaminated with road salt (which accelerated the corrosion) to corrode the structure.|$|E
5|$|The {{community}} {{also had}} a secondary school, named Southern Okanagan Secondary School, until it was burnt by a fire in September 2011, during the school's multi-million dollar renovation project. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police's (RCMP) <b>investigation</b> <b>found</b> no conclusion. The Government of British Columbia are contributing to the school's rebuilding; its construction began in spring 2012, being slated for completion in 2013.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{accident}} <b>investigation</b> <b>found</b> that procedures and policies were supposedly {{already in place}} to prevent such a crash from occurring again, {{the fact that this}} crash occurred showed that in at least one instance, the existing safety policies and their enforcement had been grievously inadequate. To re-emphasize the importance of adherence to existing safety policies and correcting the actions of anyone violating them at any time, the USAF quickly distributed the findings of {{the accident}} investigation throughout the service. These measures failed to prevent – sixteen years later – the occurrence in almost identical circumstances of another accident, when a C-17 transport aircraft crashed shortly after taking off from Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska, on an aerial-display practice flight.|$|E
50|$|<b>Investigations</b> <b>found</b> {{the claims}} to be as preposterous. Sales {{recovered}} only after an extensive public relations campaign that included then-New York City Mayor David N. Dinkins, who is Black, drinking a bottle of the soda for television news cameras.|$|R
25|$|A 2012 {{article in}} Der Spiegel {{reported}} that recent <b>investigations</b> <b>found</b> {{evidence of a}} nail having been driven through the book, {{which could have been}} the result of the book being nailed to a tree, in a Germanic, anti-Christian ritual.|$|R
50|$|Further <b>investigations</b> <b>found</b> {{that the}} levels of Chromium VI at the zone {{to the west of}} Glasgow Road were five times greater than at the cleared east zone near to the new bridge, and will require more {{intensive}} remediation treatment to address.|$|R
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 2005 season, an NCAA <b>investigation</b> <b>found</b> that eleven ineligible {{players had}} played for the Yellow Jackets between the 1998 and 2005 seasons. These players played while not making {{progress}} towards graduation on the NCAA-approved schedule. The football victories for that season were initially revoked, and Georgia Tech was put on two years of NCAA probation. Twelve football scholarships were stricken from Georgia Tech's allotment for the 2006 and 2007 freshman classes. The Georgia Tech Athletic Department appealed this decision by the NCAA, and the records were restored but scholarship reductions and probation remained. Athletic Director Dave Braine retired in January 2006, and Dan Radakovich was hired as Athletic Director.|$|E
5|$|Concerns {{about the}} {{proposed}} measure—particularly its {{denial of the}} right to appeal—were voiced by the UK, US, and Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace. The US, UK, IMF, and World Bank threatened that if Zimbabwe implemented the law, it would forfeit foreign aid packages. Responding to the criticisms, the government removed the ban on court appeals from the bill, which was then passed as law. Over the following few years, hundreds of thousands of acres of largely white-owned land were expropriated. In April 1994, a newspaper <b>investigation</b> <b>found</b> that not all of this was redistributed to landless blacks; much of the expropriated land was being leased to ministers and senior officials such as Witness Mangwede, who was leased a 3000-acre farm in Hwedza. Responding to this scandal, in 1994 the UK government—which had supplied £44 million for land redistribution—halted its payments.|$|E
5|$|During the Blizzard of 1996, on January 6, a Metro {{operator}} {{was killed}} when a train failed {{to stop at the}} Shady Grove station. The four-car train overran the station platform and struck an unoccupied train that was awaiting assignment. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) <b>investigation</b> <b>found</b> that the crash was a result of a failure in the train's computer-controlled braking system. The NTSB recommended that Metro grant train operators the ability to manually control the braking system, even in inclement weather, and recommended that Metro prohibit parked rail cars on tracks used by incoming outbound trains.|$|E
40|$|Archaeological {{watching}} brief on soil investigations at The Gas Holder site exposed London Clay, Wittering Formation, River Terrace gravels {{and natural}} brickearth. In the higher southwest {{part of the}} site {{a number of the}} soil <b>investigations</b> <b>found</b> burnt flint suggesting possible prehistoric occupation...|$|R
50|$|The initial {{studies of}} {{multimedia}} learning {{were limited to}} logical scientific processes that centered on cause-and-effect systems like automobile braking systems, how a bicycle pump works or cloud formation. However, subsequent <b>investigations</b> <b>found</b> that the modality effect extended {{to other areas of}} learning.|$|R
5000|$|Early <b>investigations</b> <b>found</b> {{that the}} train {{had gone into}} the curve where it derailed at almost three times the posted speed limit. The engineer, William Rockefeller, later {{admitted}} that before reaching the curve he had gone into a [...] "daze", a sort of highway hypnosis.|$|R
5|$|In 2015, Riverkeeper was alerted of a sewage leak in the kill, noting {{high levels}} of {{bacteria}} indicating the presence of fecal matter. A New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) <b>investigation</b> <b>found</b> nearby private sewer pipes and manholes {{to be filled with}} sludge; they were cleaned and plans have been instated to ensure that sewers would stay clear henceforth. An oil spill was observed in the kill in 2016 and DEC staff were again sent to respond. The DEC installed booms to absorb the oil and began an investigation into the spill's source, which was unknown as of December 6.|$|E
5|$|In August 1922, a {{traveling}} salesman named Jack Eaton {{was arrested for}} allegedly assaulting several young girls. The girls' parents refused to press charges, and Eaton was released. Later, he was captured by a mob, who cut him several times and poured turpentine into his wounds. An <b>investigation</b> <b>found</b> that the Scott County sheriff had willfully delivered Eaton to the mob, and Morrow removed him from office. Though Eaton was a white man, blacks were elated with the removal because they hoped it would encourage other jailers to step up efforts to protect against lynchings and mob violence.|$|E
5|$|The NTSB <b>investigation</b> <b>found</b> {{that after}} a June 17 {{replacement}} of a track circuit component at what became {{the site of the}} June 22 collision, the track circuit had been suffering from parasitic oscillations which left it unable to reliably report when that stretch of track was occupied by a train. The struck train came to a stop because of traffic ahead. Because the entire train was within the faulty circuit, it became invisible to the Automatic Train Control (ATC) system. The train behind it was therefore commanded to proceed at 55mph. The operator of the striking train applied the emergency brake after the stopped train came into full view but there was not enough time to prevent the collision, which occurred at approximately 44mph.|$|E
50|$|The Economic Report, a {{syndicated}} business and economy television program hosted by Greg Gumbel, announced in October 2008 {{that it would}} be featuring Heritage in an upcoming episode. Later <b>investigations</b> <b>found</b> The Economic Report to be an infomercial scam which charged $20,000-$30,000 for a five-minute segment.|$|R
50|$|Three formal Occupational Health and Safety {{investigations}} on Willis Island {{have been}} undertaken by independent assessors - GHD (2007 and 2011) and Parsons Brinkerhoff (April 2011 - after TC Yasi). These <b>investigations</b> <b>found</b> no significant potential for exposure to asbestos fibre for employees stationed on Willis Island.|$|R
5000|$|Princess Iman Center for Research and Laboratory Sciences: a {{reference}} {{center for the}} laboratory <b>investigations,</b> <b>founded</b> in 2001.

5|$|The {{captain and}} most of the crew of the shipall {{nationals}} of the Philippineshad to face a U.S. Coast Guard Board of Inquiry, which required them to remain in the United States for several weeks after the wreck. In addition, a federal grand jury investigated the incident for criminal wrongdoing. Captain Morgado refused to answer many of the questions posed at the inquiry, citing his Fifth Amendment rights. The crew was released after their testimony and returned to the Philippines. On September 16, the Coast Guard issued its findings that captain's error was the primary cause of the wreck, with the first and third officers of the ship also partly responsible. The <b>investigation</b> <b>found</b> no evidence of criminal wrongdoing, and no charges were filed against any member of the New Carissa crew.|$|E
5|$|The <b>investigation</b> <b>found</b> that crewing of {{the train}} was insufficient. There was no {{traction}} inspector on board. WCRC had discontinued the use of traction inspectors by 2012. A traction inspector's duties include assisting the driver with the sighting of signals. Two members {{of the train}} support crew were also on the footplate of Tangmere, {{but they had no}} responsibility in respect of the operation of the train. No problems were found with the ability to sight signals SN43 and SN45. The locomotive and carriages from the train were tested separately following the incident; no fault was found with either, although some of the sensors were not being recorded by the On Train Data Recorder (OTDR). The RAIB were able to reconstruct the sequence of events from the data that was recorded by the OTDR.|$|E
5|$|Webber took {{provisional}} {{pole position}} in Friday qualifying of the , out-qualifying local driver Rubens Barrichello by 0.138 seconds during a rain-affected session. He continued his good {{performance in the}} Saturday session taking a career-best 3rd on the grid, Jaguar Racing's best qualifying performance in their four-year Formula One history. In the race, which was hit heavily by rain, Webber was in seventh place when he attempted to cool his tyres by driving through a puddle lying off-line in the final corner. The resultant lack of grip caused Webber to crash heavily into the pit straight walls, leaving debris on the track which caused a second major crash; Fernando Alonso hitting a stray tyre. The race was subsequently red-flagged, and although Webber was originally classified in 7th, an FIA <b>investigation</b> <b>found</b> a timekeeping error which meant that Webber was placed 9th in the re-classification.|$|E
50|$|Much later, Hangman {{surfaced}} {{again when}} a demon named Bloodbath revealed that {{his former wife}} had sired a son {{he did not know}} about. Bloodbath forced Hangman to kill people for him for a while, until X-Factor <b>Investigations</b> <b>found</b> out about the killings and fought, then helped him.|$|R
50|$|On 22 February The Guardian {{revealed}} that A4e had forced jobseekers to work unpaid {{in its own}} offices, had been investigated nine times by the Department for Work and Pensions since 2005, and {{had been forced to}} repay public funds on five separate occasions after government <b>investigations</b> <b>found</b> 'irregularities'.|$|R
