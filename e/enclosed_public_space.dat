40|$|A {{spate of}} {{legislations}} prohibiting cigarette smoking in <b>enclosed</b> <b>public</b> <b>spaces,</b> mainly {{on grounds of}} public health protection, recently swept across cities around the world. This is in tandem with a raft of increasingly restrictive national laws that emerged {{on the back of}} the ratification of the WHO Framework for Tobacco Control by more than one 168 countries in 2005. The central debate on the increasingly restrictive tobacco laws revolves on the extent to which public health interests justification should ground political intervention in a private right as basic as tobacco smoking, which interestingly is often lumped in the food and beverage category. The pertinent legal and ethical questions therefore are the following: Is or should there be a general unrestricted right to tobacco smoking? If there were such a right, should public health or ethical considerations trump private right to smoke in <b>enclosed</b> <b>public</b> <b>spaces?</b> And if <b>public</b> health interests were so paramount, should they go farther and ground tobacco smoking proscription in all private and public spheres? Using ethical principles and rights-based arguments, the paper critically examines the legal and ethical ramifications of public health justification for tobacco smoking proscription in <b>enclosed</b> <b>public</b> <b>spaces...</b>|$|R

40|$|Aims: To {{establish}} {{how frequently}} {{different types of}} stakeholders were cited in the UK media debate about e-cigarette regulation, their stances towards different forms of e-cigarette regulation, and what rationales they employed in justifying those stances. Methods: Quantitative and qualitative content analyses of 104 articles about e-cigarette regulation published in eight UK and three Scottish national newspapers between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2014. Results: Reporting on e-cigarette regulation grew significantly (p< 0. 001) throughout the sample period. Governments and regulatory bodies were the most frequently cited stakeholders and uniformly supported regulation, while other stakeholders did not always support regulation. Arguments for e-cigarette regulation greatly outnumbered arguments against regulation. Regulating purchasing age, restricting marketing and regulating e-cigarettes as medicine were broadly supported, while stakeholders disagreed about prohibiting e-cigarette use in <b>enclosed</b> <b>public</b> <b>spaces.</b> In rationalising their stances, supporters of regulation cited child protection and concerns {{about the safety of}} e-cigarette products, while opponents highlighted the potential of e-cigarettes in tobacco cessation and questioned the evidence base associating e-cigarette use with health harms. Conclusions: In the UK between 2013 and 2014, governments and tobacco control advocates frequently commented on e-cigarettes in UK-wide and Scottish national newspapers. Almost all commentators supported e-cigarette regulation but there was disagreement about whether e-cigarette use should be allowed in <b>enclosed</b> <b>public</b> <b>spaces.</b> This appeared to be linked to whether commentators emphasised the harms of vapour and concerns about renormalizing smoking or emphasised the role of e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation aid...|$|R

University students (N = 705) completed self-report measures of motivation, social cognitive factors, and intention according to a hypothetical H 1 N 1 pandemic scenario in which their professors asked them to wear facemasks in the lecture hall, using either an ‘autonomy-supportive’ interpersonal style or a ‘controlling’ style. The results showed that the manipulation of professors’ autonomy support exerted a positive effect on students’ perception of autonomy support, which positively predicted their self-determined motivation, social cognitive factors, and intentions to wear facemasks. In conclusion, promoting self-determined motivation using autonomy-supportive communication styles might be an effective means of fostering individuals’ adaptive beliefs and motivation of H 1 N 1 prevention.
