5|$|The Solar System is {{subdivided}} {{into the inner}} planets, the asteroid belt, and the outer planets. The inner terrestrial planets consist of Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. The outer gas giant planets are Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.

5|$|Initially, {{the death}} of Kirchner caused a power vacuum, as Cristina Kirchner had ruled so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> figurehead, while Néstor Kirchner still managed the {{government}}. She changed {{the style of the}} government making it more authoritarian, and more critical of the U.S.. She broke with allies of her husband, such as the union leader Hugo Moyano, and increased the political clout of the youth wing La Cámpora instead. She also relied on her public image more than her husband had. The popularity of the Kirchners had been in a decline at the time of Néstor's death, but after being widowed, Cristina Kirchner's popularity increased greatly. As a result, she won the reelection in the 2011 general elections by a landslide.|$|E

5|$|Jorge Remes Lenicov {{resigned}} in April, alongside ministers De Mendiguren and Capitanich. Peronist governors, legislators, and union leaders {{met at the}} Quinta de Olivos, amid rumors that Duhalde would appoint the populist Daniel Carbonetto as minister of economy. They gave their full support {{to the president and}} the economic policies instrumented so <b>far.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result, Duhalde appointed the conservative Roberto Lavagna. Lavagna was the Argentine ambassador to the European Union, and switched offices with Remes Lenicov. He was suggested by Governor Carlos Ruckauf and supported by Alfonsín. He stabilised prices and the exchange rate with tight fiscal and monetary policies, and prevented the crisis from growing into an hyperinflation. The recovery also benefited from the idle capacity of the economy.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} phase of the operation, the 17th Infantry Brigade {{exploited}} the breach made in the perimeter, and pressed south as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> secondary line of defences known as the Switch Line. On the second day, the 16th Infantry Brigade captured the township of Bardia, cutting the fortress in two. Thousands of prisoners were taken, and the Italian garrison now held out only in the northern and southernmost parts of the fortress. On the third day, the 19th Infantry Brigade advanced south from Bardia, supported by artillery and the Matilda tanks, now reduced in number to just six. Its advance allowed the 17th Infantry Brigade to make progress as well, and the two brigades reduced the southern sector of the fortress. Meanwhile, the Italian garrisons in the north surrendered to the 16th Infantry Brigade and the Support Group of the British 7th Armoured Division outside the fortress. In all, some 36,000 Italian prisoners were taken.|$|E
5|$|Sherman {{attacked}} {{once again}} down the Graveyard Road, with 150 volunteers (nicknamed the Forlorn Hope detachment) {{leading the way}} with ladders and planks, followed by the divisions of Blair and Brig. Gen. James M. Tuttle, arranged in a long column of regiments, hoping to achieve a breakthrough by concentrating their mass on a narrow front. They were driven back {{in the face of}} heavy rifle fire. Blair's brigades under Cols. Giles A. Smith and T. Kilby Smith made it as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> ridge 100 yards from Green's Redan, the southern edge of the Stockade Redan, from where they poured heavy fire into the Confederate position, but to no avail. Tuttle's division, waiting its turn to advance, did not have an opportunity to move forward. On Sherman's far right, the division of Brig. Gen. Frederick Steele spent the morning attempting to get into position through a ravine of the Mint Spring Bayou.|$|E

25|$|N. americanus {{is between}} 25 and 45mm long {{and can be}} {{identified}} by its striking, distinctive coloring. The body is shiny black, and on its wing covers are four scalloped, orange-red markings. Most distinctively, there is an orange-red marking on the beetle's pronotum, a large shield-like area just behind the head. N. americanus has orange facial markings and orange tips on their large antennae. The beetle is nocturnal and is a strong flier, moving as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> kilometer in one night.|$|E

An estimated 93.5% of {{the population}} ages 6–14 attend an institution of education. Estimated 12.8% of residents of the state have obtained a college degree.

25|$|Around Karlsruhe, Kassel, and Saarbrücken in Germany, dual-voltage {{light rail}} trains partly use {{mainline}} railroad tracks, sharing these tracks with heavy rail trains. In the Netherlands, this concept was first applied on the RijnGouweLijn. This allows commuters to ride {{directly into the}} city centre, rather than taking a mainline train only as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> central station and then having change to a tram. In France, similar tram-trains are planned for Paris, Mulhouse, and Strasbourg; further projects exist. In some cases, tram-trains use previously abandoned or lightly used heavy rail lines in addition to or instead of still in use mainline tracks.|$|E
25|$|While the {{suggestion}} of ending appeals to the Privy Council had {{been around since the}} Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1947, proposals to end appeals to the Privy Council began in the late 1970s, when a Royal Commission on the judiciary canvassed arguments for replacing the Privy Council. In the early 1980s, Minister of Justice Jim McLay suggested their abolition. Proposals for an indigenous final appellate court {{can be traced back to}} 1985. In 1996, Paul East, Attorney-General of the Bolger government, proposed to end the status of the Privy Council as the country's highest court of appeal. The proposal got as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Bill being introduced into Parliament. However, this Bill met with little support from within the National Party, and the Bill was not carried over by the next Parliament following the 1996 general election.|$|E
