40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to present an Object Oriented Analysis (OOA) of a firm and its {{accounting}} and financial environments for the implementation of a working capital management system. The object oriented analysis has been designed so that it can be used by different types and sizes of companies, (e. g., industrial, commercial or service). This versatility is a consequence of an important feature of the object oriented paradigm: the reusability of code. This OOA includes firm's regular operations as well as tools and reports used in the management of working capital such as cash flows and <b>estimated</b> <b>balance</b> sheets. In order to demonstrate the functionality of the OOA, we discuss parts of the analysis that we have implemented successfully in the C++ object oriented programming language...|$|E
40|$|We have {{measured}} ice {{flow and}} detailed topography in northeastern Greenland using satellite-based Synthetic Aperture Radar (S A R) interferometry. The object {{of this study}} is the large ice stream that drains this quadrant of the ice sheet. A single S A R interferogram allows the measure-ment of one component of motion over a several-day long interval. We have used a set of such measurements, from several look directions, to produce a mosaic of ice flow velocity. The result-ing flow field is tied to an <b>estimated</b> <b>balance</b> velocity distribution in slow moving areas, and assumes flow to be locally surface parallel. In spite of these assumptions, the velocity field is the most detailed, consistent data set available over a flow feature of this size. It compares with GPS control points at the 5 m/yr level. In the process of mapping ice flow velocity, an enhanced eleva-tion model of the ice stream was produced. The elevation model is based on a blend of interfero-metrically-derived short wavelength topography and radar-altimetry based longer wavelength topography. This enhanced model has improved information on local surface slope, which was useful for estimating the horizontal components of the velocity field...|$|E

Immediately {{following}} touchdown confirmation, best {{estimates of}} position were calculated {{to assist in}} determining official MSL locations during entry, descent and landing (EDL). Additionally, <b>estimated</b> <b>balance</b> mass impact locations were provided and used to assess how predicted locations compared to actual locations. For MSL, the Program to Optimize Simulated Trajectories II (POST 2) was the primary trajectory simulation tool used to predict and assess EDL performance from cruise stage separation through rover touchdown and descent stage impact. This POST 2 simulation was used during MSL operations for EDL trajectory analyses in support of maneuver decisions and imaging MSL during EDL. This paper presents the simulation methodology used and results of pre/post-landing MSL location estimates and associated imagery from Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter s (MRO) High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera. To generate these estimates, the MSL POST 2 simulation nominal and Monte Carlo data, flight telemetry from onboard navigation, relay orbiter positions from MRO and Mars Odyssey and HiRISE generated digital elevation models (DEM) were utilized.

40|$|What is a {{permanent}} incapacity benefit? A permanent incapacity (PI) benefit is a payment made from your super account balance if you are injured or ill and permanently unable {{to work as a}} result. When can I claim a PI benefit? You can apply for a PI benefit if you are medically certified as meeting this definition of permanent incapacity: ‘Permanent incapacity, in relation to a member, means ill-health (whether physical or mental), where the Trustee is reasonably satisfied the member is unlikely, because of the ill-health, to ever again engage in gainful employment for which the member is reasonably qualified by education, training or experience. ’ Is there a waiting period? There is no waiting period, but to start the claim process you must attach recent medical certificates from two different legally qualified medical practitioners confirming you meet the PI definition above. We cannot assess your claim until we receive all the required documentation (see the Document checklist on page 2 and Certifying your identification on page 3 for details). How much will it cost to process my application? You will need to pay the cost of obtaining the required medical certificates and any fees charged for certifying copies of your documents. Keeping your HESTA account open You can keep your HESTA super account active by leaving at least $ 1, 500 invested in it (see Section 3 of the application form).

40|$|Approximately 1 in 3 - 4 {{patients}} presenting with an {{ischemic stroke}} {{will also have}} atrial fibrillation (AF), and AF-related strokes can be effectively prevented using oral anticoagulant therapy (OAC), either with well-controlled vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) or non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs). In addition, OAC use (both VKAs and NOACs) {{is associated with a}} 26 % reduction in all-cause mortality (VKAs) or an additional 10 % mortality reduction with NOACs relative to VKAs. The decision to use OAC in individual AF patient is based on the <b>estimated</b> <b>balance</b> of the benefit from ischemic stroke reduction against the risk of major OAC-related bleeding [essentially intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) ]. Better appreciation of the importance of VKAs' anticoagulation quality [a target time in therapeutic range (TTR) of ae 70 %] and the availability of NOACs (which offer better safety compared to VKAs) have decreased the estimated threshold for OAC treatment in AF patients towards lower stroke risk levels. Still, contemporary registry-based data show that OAC is often underused in AF patients at increased risk of stroke. The uncertainty whether to use OAC may be particularly pronounced in AF patients with a single additional stroke risk factor, who are often (mis) perceived as having a "borderline" or insufficient stroke risk to trigger the use of OAC. However, observational data from real-world AF cohorts show that the annual stroke rates in such patients are higher than in patients with no additional stroke risk factors, and OAC use has been associated with reduction in stroke, systemic embolism, or death in comparison to no therapy or aspirin, with no increase in the risk of bleeding relative to aspirin. In this review article, we summarize the basic principles of stroke risk stratification in AF patients and discuss contemporary real-world evidence on OAC use and outcomes of OAC treatment in AF patients with a single additional stroke risk factor in various real-world AF cohorts...|$|E
40|$|Re-utilisation {{of organic}} waste	is {{globally}} widely	 employed to maximise {{both economic and}} environmental	 sustainability of human activities. Re-utilisation	 of organic waste nutrients of biochars produced	from	 such wastes do offer a critical	element	for enhancing	soil fertility and thus supporting sustainable agriculture. Newfoundland and Labrador produces a variety of organic waste streams ranging from municipal to	farm, fishery and timber production. We carried out a	best estimate {{of the amount of}} these waste streams with a goal to	 understand the potential utility of each as a source of nutrients or biochar for sustaining agricultural activities in the province. Municipal sources, i. e. 	municipal organic waste	streams	 and wastewaters, and fishery waste were	estimated to	 offer the largest potential for	nutrient recovery. 		 Dairy industry is the largest producer of nutrient rich	 organic	waste among agricultural activities. The dairy	 industry might possibly	produce most of	the nutrients	 required to fertilise their own	land base; note	that the	 dairies	in the province	still import a significant portion of their feed and that is reflected in the waste	 stream. 	Nutrients currently available in the estimated	 waste streams are likely sufficient to support most	 fertilisation needs of the current land-base, or	 nearly double the current land base in the case	of	phosphorus. Given the <b>estimated</b>	<b>balance</b>	of waste	nutrients in the province any expansion	in agricultural	land base would	require	supplementary imports of fertilizers or,	preferably, an integrated livestock	and crop agriculture expansion. A secondary estimation	 was carried out to assess the value of the same organic	 waste streams for biochar production. This offered an	 alternative to nutrient	reutilisation, an alternative	that is	also in support	of soil	fertility. Sawmill	waste,	that carried little nitrogen and phosphorus	value, was also	included in biochar estimates. The	assessment has shown a significant potential for biochar	production mainly for fishery and municipal organic waste. However,	pursuing a biochar agenda for these	 materials would	require	a trade-off with the nutrients	lost during pyrolysis. 	 The assessment presented here confirms that organic wastes are a valuable resource for agricultural	production and sustainability. However specific	decisions	 would require a	more detailed analysis of the geographic	 integration of waste streams and agricultural production...|$|E
40|$|Selenium (Se) {{has been}} applied to Finnish {{agricultural}} soils in mineral fertilizers as sodium selenate since 1985. Usually, less than 10 % of applied Se is taken up by the crop. Previous studies indicate that the level of easily soluble (hot water extractable) Se has not been elevated during the period of Se fertilization. It is assumed that Se not taken up by the crop is mostly retained by the acidic soil. In this study, Se balance over the period of 13 years (1992 - 2004) was calculated on the basis of crops grown and fertilizers used in 48 fields of 10 research stations at different parts of Finland. The material consisted of 10 organogenic soils, 18 coarse mineral soils and 20 clay and silt soils. The pH(H 2 O) of the soils was 4. 6 6. 9 (mean 5. 9). The soil samples taken from these fields in 1992 and 2004 were analysed for aqua regia (AR) extractable Se, which indicates the semi-total Se concentration. These results were also converted to grams per hectare by multiplying the AR extractable results with the volume weight of the soil in order to compare them with the Se balance of the respective fields. The cumulative Se application was on average 37 g/ha (range 3 78 g/ha) during the 13 -year period. Highest applications took place in intensive grassland cultivation. Se applications resulted in the <b>estimated</b> <b>balance</b> of 31 g Se/ha (range 2 67 g/ha). The average concentrations of AR extractable Se in the samples taken in 1992 were 0. 393 mg/kg in organogenic soils, 0. 148 mg/kg in coarse mineral soils and 0. 211 mg/kg in clay and silt soils. These results corresponded to 516, 363 and 470 g/ha in the three soil groups, respectively. According to soil analyses, the Se content of a 23 -cm deep plough layer was on average 23 g/ha higher in 2004 but the difference was not statistically significant. It was concluded that the possible accumulation of Se in soil occurring during the 13 -year period was masked by the heterogeneity of the sampled fields and could not yet be detected by soil analyses. The balance, calculated from fertilizer use and estimated crop uptake, corresponded to 8 % (range 0. 7 22 %) of the Se content of the plough layer. vokMyynti MTT tietopalvelut 31600 Jokioine...|$|E

This law disposes for the appointment of a Commissioner by the Prefecture to carry on with the governance in place of the political government agency for the pursuance of the government in spite of political bodies. The aim of this research, which is the first one of all time who try to analyze a small pool of local governments of the Italian public administration, is to identify all the critical issues, trying to find all the elements that must be to overcome for improve efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the actions of Commissioners, and create the basement for future researches. Due to the Public Performance Management and Measurement (PPMM) approach, authors have tried to analyze the action of a Commissioner by the Prefeture through a multidimensional investigation, of their Performance so as to steer the necessary redefinition of the institution towards raising the standard quantitative and qualitative productivity and cost containment which guide, restricting it, the path to follow. This is because it must be possible to pervade the bureaucratic action of Commissioners, as well as emerge from the search results, by a system of values designed to guide his public behavior and to measure the results, in view of the creation of public value (Public Value Management or PVM), although on this occasion,because of the characteristics of the commissioner through guidelines established by the Central Administration, that Commissioners must observe. The heterogeneity that characterizes the figure of Commissioner in the different administrative systems International led the authors to not carry out an analysis of comparative with that of other countries, but to national circumscribe it, comparing the performance of the commissioner's management with that of management policies. In particular, we sought to test whether the commissioners are more or less efficient than the political bodies in the management of local Italian Governments, not forgetting the constraints which can be found in strategic and operational <b>estimated</b> <b>balance</b> sheets guidelines often already approved by its political bodies ranging to replace. Moreover, being the non-elected commissioners organs, face greater operational constraints than elected because their activities ferrying the new administration is essentially maintaining the status quo and administrative regularization of the shortcomings of the functioning of the municipality. Precisely for these reasons, the commissioner's management were found to be directed at containing the financial risk related to investment decisions and not to increase leverage tax and tariff, although this fact does not allow to consider options to create value for the communities directly administered but only institutional opportunities...|$|E
