25|$|Aminoglycoside antibiotics, such as <b>kanamycin,</b> gentamicin, streptomycin, etc., {{were once}} {{effective}} against staphylococcal infections until strains evolved mechanisms to inhibit the aminoglycosides' action, which occurs via protonated amine and/or hydroxyl {{interactions with the}} ribosomal RNA of the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit. Three main mechanisms of aminoglycoside resistance mechanisms are currently and widely accepted: aminoglycoside modifying enzymes, ribosomal mutations, and active efflux of the drug out of the bacteria.|$|E

2500|$|As of Oct 2006, [...] "Extensively {{drug-resistant}} tuberculosis" [...] (XDR-TB) {{is defined}} as MDR-TB that is resistant to quinolones and also {{to any one of}} <b>kanamycin,</b> capreomycin, or amikacin. [...] The old case definition of XDR-TB is MDR-TB that is also resistant to three or more of the six classes of second-line drugs. This definition should no longer be used, but is included here because many older publications refer to it.|$|E
50|$|While {{the main}} product {{produced}} by Streptomyces kanamyceticus is <b>kanamycin</b> A, additional products are also produced, including <b>kanamycin</b> B, <b>kanamycin</b> C, <b>kanamycin</b> D and <b>kanamycin</b> X.|$|E
50|$|The <b>kanamycin</b> biosynthetic pathway can {{be divided}} into two parts. The first part is common to several {{aminoglycoside}} antibiotics, such as butirosin and neomycin. In it a unique aminocyclitol, 2-deoxystreptamine, is biosynthesized from D-glucopyranose 6-phosphate in four steps. At this point the <b>kanamycin</b> pathway splits into two branches due to the promiscuity of the next enzyme, which can utilize two different glycosyl donors - UDP-N-acetyl-α-D-glucosamine and UDP-α-D-glucose. One of the branches forms <b>kanamycin</b> C and <b>kanamycin</b> B, while the other branch forms <b>kanamycin</b> D and <b>kanamycin</b> X. However, both <b>kanamycin</b> B and <b>kanamycin</b> D can be converted to <b>kanamycin</b> A, so both branches of the pathway converge at <b>kanamycin</b> A.|$|E
50|$|<b>Kanamycin</b> is {{a mixture}} of three main {{components:}} <b>kanamycin</b> A, B, and C. <b>Kanamycin</b> A is the major component in <b>kanamycin.</b> The effects of these components {{do not appear to be}} widely studied as individual compounds when used against prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.|$|E
50|$|<b>Kanamycin</b> {{is used in}} {{molecular}} biology as a selective agent most commonly to isolate bacteria (e.g., E. coli) which have taken up genes (e.g., of plasmids) coupled to a gene coding for <b>kanamycin</b> resistance (primarily Neomycin phosphotransferase II II/Neo). Bacteria that have been transformed with a plasmid containing the <b>kanamycin</b> resistance gene are plated on <b>kanamycin</b> (50-100 ug/ml) containing agar plates or are grown in media containing <b>kanamycin</b> (50-100 ug/ml). Only the bacteria that have successfully taken up the <b>kanamycin</b> resistance gene become resistant and will grow under these conditions. As a powder, <b>kanamycin</b> is white to off-white and is soluble in water (50 mg/ml).|$|E
50|$|<b>Kanamycin</b> enters {{breast milk}} in small amounts. The {{manufacturer}} therefore advises {{that people should}} either stop breastfeeding or <b>kanamycin.</b> The American Academy of Pediatrics considers <b>kanamycin</b> okay in breastfeeding.|$|E

50|$|<b>Kanamycin</b> A, often {{referred}} to as simple <b>kanamycin,</b> is an antibiotic used to treat severe bacterial infections and tuberculosis. It is not a first line treatment. It is used by mouth, injection into a vein, or injection into a muscle. <b>Kanamycin</b> is recommended for short-term use only, usually from 7 to 10 days. As with all antibiotics, it is ineffective in viral infections.|$|E
5000|$|Drugs {{that are}} {{resistant}} to streptomycin and capreomycin are still susceptible to amikacin; drugs that {{are resistant to}} <b>kanamycin</b> have varying susceptibility to amikacin. Resistance to amikacin also confers resistance to <b>kanamycin</b> and capreomycin.|$|E
50|$|The npt I gene {{in place}} of the T-DNA in EHA101 {{requires}} that binary plasmids that are put into the strain encode a drug resistance other than <b>kanamycin.</b> Strains EHA105 was generated from EHA101 through site-directed deletion of the <b>kanamycin</b> resistance gene from the Ti plasmid, otherwise the strains are identical. This latter strain has been useful to plant biotechnologists who use <b>kanamycin</b> as a selectable marker on their binary plasmids.|$|E

50|$|Resistance to {{amikacin}} and <b>kanamycin</b> in Mycobacterium, the causative {{agent of}} tuberculosis, {{is due to}} a mutation in the rrs gene, which codes for the 16S rRNA. Mutations such as these reduce the binding affinity of amikacin to the bacteria's ribosome. Variations of aminoglycoside acetyltransferase (AAC) and aminoglycoside adenylyltransferase (AAD) also confer resistance: resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa is caused by AAC(6')-IV, which also confers resistance to <b>kanamycin,</b> gentamicin, and tobramycin, and resistance in Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis is caused by AAD(4',4), which also confers resistance to <b>kanamycin,</b> tobramycin, and apramycin. Some strains of S. aureus can also inactivate amikacin by phosphorylating it.|$|E
