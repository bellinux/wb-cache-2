Their Collembolan species composition 145 species, with only 43 rare species) was analysed by Benzecri's correspondence analysis, a multivariate method. Five groups of species, each associated with a given habitat, were determined: above the ground surface a distinction is evident between light species (open sites), hygrophilic species (moist forest sites) and corticolous species (dry forest sites); edaphic species may be divided into acidophilic species (mor, moder and acid mull humus) and neutroacidocline species (<b>earthworm</b> <b>mull).</b> A depth gradient may be traced from edaphic to atmobiotic species in both forest and open sites. As a conclusion, {{it is apparent that}} vegetation in itself does not directly influence Collembola but may effect them indirectly through humus formation...|$|E
40|$|Two {{examples}} are given of strong {{relationships between the}} activity of soil animals {{and the development of}} humus forms in a mountain spruce forest and a lowland Scots pine stand. Both were based on field distributions of fauna and humus components. The vertical heterogeneity of soil animal communities in a moder humus profile under Scots pine is related to successional processes occurring during litter decomposition. Accumulation of faecal pellets by litter-dwelling animals influences in turn the development of the root system of pine and associated ectomycorrhizal fungi. The heterogeneity of humus forms in a mountain spruce forest is related to the developmental phases of spruce stands. Typical <b>earthworm</b> <b>mull</b> humus forms are restricted to regeneration sites with a low herbaceous vegetation. Typical moder humus forms with a thick OH horizon (dysmoder) are restricted to the pole phase of spruce stands. Between these two stages of the forest successional cycle, intermediary humus forms are found. They correspond to changes in soil animal communities, mostly burrowing earthworms, occurring together with changes in vegetation. These observations are discussed in terms of feed-back loops involving humus forms, soil animal and plant communities...|$|E
40|$|Summary—The humus forms {{during the}} life cycle of a spruce forest are described. A {{significant}} change in humus form may be attributed to plant and soil fauna changes. This phenomenon is considered to be fundamental for the renewal of the forest ecosystem. Forest dynamics is perceived as a biphasic cycle, (i) the tree growth phase with a shift from mull towards moder humus form, as a consequence of a decline in earthworm populations and (ii) a humus form improvement from moder towards <b>earthworm</b> <b>mull</b> humus, {{during the second half of}} the life of spruce trees. This results from a succession of earthworm species. The particular role of anecic species during the second phase has been highlighted, where they allow endogeic earthworm species and young spruce seedlings to install themselves in the regeneration site, the fall of parent trees not being considered as the chief factor governing humus changes. The life cycle of the spruce ecosystem can nevertheless be impaired by the development of a bilberry heath, with a mor humus form which is detrimental to the germination and growth of spruce seedlings. Earthworm populations of anecic and endogeic species are present in this case but without any burrowing activity...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWhether the {{structure}} of Oa and A horizons varies according to animal activity is still a matter of conjecture, especially in amphi, a humus form with mixed features of mull and moder, which has been described in environments with strong seasonal contrasts. The Oa and A horizons of spruce [Picea abies (L.) Karst. ] coniferous forests of the Province of Trento (Italy) were sampled in six sites {{with a total of}} 134 humus profiles along transect lines, embracing the variety of parent rocks, climate, and vegetation conditions that prevail at the upper montane level in this region. The distribution of humus components (plant debris, roots, animal feces, minerals) was assessed by an optical method and analyzed with correspondence analysis (CA). Moder humus forms were characterized by enchytraeid activity, with concomitant deposition of organic and mineral-organic feces in Oa and A horizons, respectively. Conversely, amphis were characterized. by the concomitant deposition of organic and mineral-organic earthworm feces in Oa and A horizons, respectively. We conclude that Oa and A horizons of moders and amphis differed only quantitatively in the content of mineral matter in animal feces. The fine-grained mineral-organic structure that is mostly found in the A horizon of amphis results from. the alimentary activity of small epigeic earthworms that mix organic matter with mineral matter, like anecic <b>earthworms</b> do in <b>mulls...</b>|$|R
5000|$|It {{is often}} {{held that the}} roots of {{scientific}} ecology may {{be traced back to}} Darwin. This contention may look convincing at first glance inasmuch as On the Origin of Species is full of observations and proposed mechanisms that clearly fit within the boundaries of modern ecology (e.g. the cat-to-clover chain - an ecological cascade) and because the term ecology was coined in 1866 by a strong proponent of Darwinism, Ernst Haeckel. However, Darwin never used the word in his writings after this year, not even in his most [...] "ecological" [...] writings such as the foreword to the English edition of Hermann Müller’s The Fertilization of Flowers (1883) or in his own treatise of <b>earthworms</b> and <b>mull</b> formation in forest soils (The formation of vegetable mould through the action of worms, 1881). Moreover, the pioneers founding ecology as a scientific discipline, such as Eugen Warming, A. F. W. Schimper, Gaston Bonnier, F.A. Forel, S.A. Forbes and Karl Möbius, made almost no reference to Darwin’s ideas in their works. This was clearly not out of ignorance or because the works of Darwin were not widespread. Some such as S.A.Forbes studying intricate food webs asked questions as yet unanswered about the instability of food chains that might persist if dominant competitors were not adapted to have self-constraint. Others focused on the dominant themes at the beginning, concern with the relationship between organism morphology and physiology on one side and environment on the other, mainly abiotic environment, hence environmental selection. Darwin’s concept of natural selection on the other hand focused primarily on competition. The mechanisms other than competition that he described, primarily the divergence of character which can reduce competition and his statement that [...] "struggle" [...] as he used it was metaphorical and thus included environmental selection, were given less emphasis in the Origin than competition. Despite most portrayals of Darwin conveying him as a non-aggressive recluse who let others fight his battles, Darwin remained all his life a man nearly obsessed with the ideas of competition, struggle and conquest - with all forms of human contact as confrontation.|$|R
40|$|International audienceRelationships between anecic {{earthworms}} (Lumbricus terrestris and Aporrectodea giardi) and the collembolan species Heteromurus nitidus (Templeton, 1835), {{which is}} known to be attracted to earthworms, were investigated in an 8 -week laboratory experiment. Our aims were (1) to assess whether earthworms influence the population dynamics of H. nitidus, and (2) to study pathways of influence and how earthworm effects are modified by humus forms and predators. Using microcosms with three defaunated humus forms, then provided with earthworms and predators, we intended to demonstrate that, amongst possible favourable effects of earthworms on springtail populations, earthworm activity may provide greater access and more pathways for springtails to explore soil and avoid predation. We expected that the effects of predators (centipedes) on the abundance of H. nitidus would increase from less (calcic mull) to more (moder) compact soil, and we hypothesized that earthworms would reduce predation pressure on H. nitidus by providing escape routes through increased macroporosity. Humus forms and earthworms only affected the population size of H. nitidus under high predation pressure, when collembolan numbers were higher in calcic mull than in moder, and were increased by the presence of earthworms. These results corroborate the hypothesis that earthworms, by increasing soil macroporosity, improve the escape routes for Collembola and thus evade predation. In moder humus earthworms increased the density of H. nitidus whether predators were present or not, so we cannot exclude that earthworms were also directly beneficial to H. nitidus. However, the hypothesis of a functional relationship mediated by soil macroporosity seems relevant since it was supported by differences observed when considering body size. When two size classes were distinguished within populations of H. nitidus (1) the positive effect of earthworms in moder was observed only on larger Collembola (> 1 mm), (2) the density of the larger Collembola was decreased by predation only in moder and not in mull, (3) the effects of predators on the smaller individuals were not influenced by the presence of earthworms whatever the humus form, and was not decreased by the presence of earthworms. Nevertheless, factors other than macroporosity may operate as the presence of <b>earthworms</b> in acidic <b>mull</b> led to an unexplained decrease in the abundance of small-sized H. nitidus...|$|R
