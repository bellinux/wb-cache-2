40|$|The present {{invention}} is {{an automated}} crawling robot system including a platform, a first <b>leg</b> <b>assembly,</b> a second <b>leg</b> <b>assembly,</b> first <b>and</b> second rails {{attached to the}} platform, and an onboard electronic computer controller. The first <b>leg</b> <b>assembly</b> has an intermittent coupling device <b>and</b> the second <b>leg</b> <b>assembly</b> has an intermittent coupling device for intermittently coupling the respective first <b>and</b> second <b>leg</b> <b>assemblies</b> to a particular object. The first <b>and</b> second <b>leg</b> <b>assemblies</b> are slidably coupled to the rail assembly and are slidably driven by motors to thereby allow linear movement. In addition, the first <b>leg</b> <b>assembly</b> is rotary driven by a rotary motor to thereby provide rotary motion relative to the platform. To effectuate motion, the intermittent coupling devices of the first <b>and</b> second <b>leg</b> <b>assemblies</b> alternately couple the respective first <b>and</b> second <b>leg</b> <b>assemblies</b> to an object. This motion is done while simultaneously moving one of the <b>leg</b> <b>assemblies</b> linearly in the desired direction and preparing the next step. This arrangement allows the crawler of the present invention to traverse an object {{in a range of}} motion covering 360 degrees...|$|R

40|$|A {{total of}} 1379 beef bull {{pictures}} were surveyed to determine visibility of <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> <b>legs</b> from four American semen company websites. Five different breeds were represented: Angus, Red Angus, Hereford (polled and horned), Simmental, and Charolais. In addition to visibility, data on other variables were collected to establish frequencies and correlations. These included breed, color, material that obscured visibility, such as grass, picture taken at livestock show or outside, semen company, photographer, video, {{and age of}} bull. A <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> <b>leg</b> visibility score was given to each bull picture. Only 19. 4 % of the pictures had fully visible <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> <b>legs.</b> Both the hooves and dewclaws were hidden on 32. 5 % of the pictures. Correlation between bull’s birthdate and the first four visibility scores was statistically significant (P < 0. 0001). As age increased the <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> <b>legs</b> {{were more likely to}} be visible in the bull’s picture. This may possibly be due to greater availability of both photo editing software and digital photography. One positive finding was that 6 % of the bulls had a video of the bull walking which completely showed his <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> <b>legs...</b>|$|R
40|$|Direct {{selection}} for decreased disease incidence is difficult given low hsuperscript 2 s {{and the absence}} of disease recording. Genetic correlations between diseases and type traits indicate possibilities for indirect selection; however, correlations often include experimentally instead of routinely scored type traits. The aim {{of this study was to}} estimate genetic correlations of clinical mastitis <b>and</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> <b>legs</b> problems with milk yield and routinely scored type traits in Dutch Black and White [DBW; Dutch Black Pied] cows. From 1983 to 1991, the incidence of diseases was recorded at 44 farms with DBW dairy cattle. Records on 3617 cows sired by 224 bulls were analysed. Heritabilities for milk yield, type traits and diseases were obtained using an equal design multivariate Restricted Maximum Likelihood procedure considering all observations on a continuous scale. A bivariate threshold procedure was used to estimate hsuperscript 2 s of diseases and genetic correlations of diseases with milk yield and type traits. Genetic correlations of clinical mastitis <b>and</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> <b>legs</b> problems with milk yield were 0. 16 and 0. 26 respectively, and hsuperscript 2 s for diseases were low 0. 01 - 0. 11. Unexpected positive relations between udder type traits and clinical mastitis were found (0. 09 - 0. 26), and possible reasons are discussed. Genetic correlations between type traits for <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> <b>legs</b> <b>and</b> problems of the <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> <b>legs</b> were negative - 0. 01 and - 0. 24 respectively. Final score for <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> <b>legs</b> could be used as a selection criterion to select to reduce the incidence of <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> <b>legs</b> problems...|$|R

40|$|This {{invention}} {{is comprised}} of a pipe crawler having a midsection that provides the stability and flexibility to allow the pipe crawler to negotiate curved and uneven segments of piping while traveling through piping systems. The pipe crawler comprises a front <b>leg</b> <b>assembly,</b> a rear <b>leg</b> <b>assembly,</b> a midsection with a gimbal at each end for connecting the midsection to the front <b>and</b> rear <b>leg</b> <b>assemblies</b> in a flexible manner, and an air cylinder for changing {{the distance between the}} front <b>and</b> rear <b>leg</b> <b>assemblies.</b> The pipe crawler moves in ``inch worm`` fashion with the front <b>and</b> rear <b>leg</b> <b>assemblies</b> alternating between an extended and a retracted position as the air cylinder moves the retracted <b>leg</b> <b>assembly</b> forward. The midsection has a plurality of legs extending radially for holding the midsection within a maximum displacement from the piping axis so that the gimbals are not pivoted to extreme angles where they might lock up or seize. When the midsection is displaced sufficiently, its legs with wheels on each end engage the interior surface of the piping and prevent further displacement. Using two gimbals divides the angle between the planes defined by the front <b>and</b> rear <b>leg</b> <b>assemblies</b> which also helps to prevent excessive gimbal pivoting...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} a portion from the {{validation}} process of an objective methodology to measure <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> <b>leg</b> joint angles <b>and</b> to evaluate their relationship with sow longevity. Joint angle measurements from five <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> <b>leg</b> conformation traits (knee, hock, front and rear pasterns and rear stance) that have been previously described in the literature as being related with sow longevity were obtained from maternal gilts at selection and during their second gestation and compared with those obtained from 45 crossbred sows parity 5 and above. Significant differences (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) between parities were identified in the knee, both pasterns, hock and rear stance joint angle measurements. These results suggest that as pigs age, structural changes occur. The range of which these changes occur could carry implications {{for the use of}} objective <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> <b>leg</b> angles towards future selection programs and protocols...|$|R
