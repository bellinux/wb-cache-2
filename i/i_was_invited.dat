Though he was the senior of our group by many years, Toru stayed up with us every night and literally drank us under the table. I was confirmed in my impression of Toru {{as a person who}} lived his life like a traditional Zen poet." ...|$|E

He was invited by the president of the students' debating society, who said [...] "We believe that the only way to get the truth of what the BNP are saying and to combat them is to do it in public in a debate." [...] The move was attacked by anti-racist groups, some of whom refused to participate in the discussion. [...] Griffin said [...] "I am coming up because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>invited</b> by the students at the university because they have a debate on an intelligent subject on which I have something to say. The people against it are the usual bunch of people who cannot win the argument and refuse to stand on a platform." [...] The society withdrew the invitation before the event was to take place.|$|E
