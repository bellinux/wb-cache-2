5|$|Initially, {{loitering}} munitions {{were not}} {{referred to as}} such but rather as suicide UAVs or loitering missiles. <b>Different</b> <b>sources</b> point at different projects as originating the weapon category. The early 1980s initial Israeli Delilah variants or the failed US AGM-136 Tacit Rainbow program are mentioned by some sources. Alternatively, the late 1980s IAI Harpy which was widely exported is considered by some as the first loitering munition system.|$|E

The magnetic field around Jupiter emanates {{from a number of}} <b>different</b> <b>sources,</b> including fluid circulation at the planet's core (the internal field), electrical currents in the plasma surrounding Jupiter and the currents flowing at the boundary of the planet's magnetosphere. The magnetosphere is embedded within the plasma of the solar wind, which carries the interplanetary magnetic field.|$|E

5|$|Supply {{problems}} {{in the aftermath of}} the war meant that the concrete piers were founded on jarrah timber piles, rather than concrete. Additionally, a steel plate shortage forced the bridge's designers to avoid the use of steel to design the forms in the bridge's superstructure. Also, the cement that was used on the bridges had to be sourced from seven <b>different</b> <b>sources,</b> which led to different durability for different parts of the bridges.|$|E

5|$|The monophyly of Malacostraca {{is widely}} accepted. This is {{supported}} by several common morphological traits which are present throughout the group and is confirmed by molecular studies.

5|$|Zoology is {{discussed}} in Books VIII to XI. The encyclopedia mentions <b>different</b> <b>sources</b> of purple dye, particularly the murex snail, the highly prized source of Tyrian purple. It describes the elephant and hippopotamus in detail, {{as well as the}} value and origin of the pearl and the invention of fish farming and oyster farming. The keeping of aquariums was a popular pastime of the rich, and Pliny provides anecdotes of the problems of owners becoming too closely attached to their fish.|$|E
5|$|Archaeoastronomy uses {{a variety}} of methods to uncover {{evidence}} of past practices including archaeology, anthropology, astronomy, statistics and probability, and history. Because these methods are diverse and use data from such <b>different</b> <b>sources,</b> integrating them into a coherent argument has been a long-term difficulty for archaeoastronomers. Archaeoastronomy fills complementary niches in landscape archaeology and cognitive archaeology. Material evidence and its connection to the sky can reveal how a wider landscape can be integrated into beliefs about the cycles of nature, such as Mayan astronomy and its relationship with agriculture. Other examples which have brought together ideas of cognition and landscape include studies of the cosmic order embedded in the roads of settlements.|$|E
5|$|Galveston Bay {{is mostly}} shallow {{with an average}} depth of 7–9feet. It is fed by the Trinity River and the San Jacinto River, {{numerous}} local bayous and incoming tides from the Gulf of Mexico. This unique and complex mixing of waters from <b>different</b> <b>sources</b> supports many types of marine life including crabs, shrimp, oysters, and many varieties of fish thereby supporting a substantial fishing industry. Additionally the system of bayous, rivers, and marshes that ring the Bay support their own ecosystems allowing for diverse wildlife and enabling freshwater farming of crawfish. The areas near the bay shore in fact have a higher diversity of habitats than the nearby Gulf coast.|$|E
40|$|International audienceSubjective Chinese speech {{intelligibility}} was evaluated {{by using an}} omnidirectional source,i. e., a source with the approximate directivity of human speaker and a human speaker source in both real and simulated rectangular rooms with different reverberation time. The result shows that subjective Chinese {{speech intelligibility}} scores have statistical differences under <b>different</b> <b>source</b> conditions. Speech intelligibility scores obtained by using omnidirectional source are lower than those obtained by using the other two sources. Therefore, it will underestimate the speech intelligibility in rooms. Subject Chinese speech intelligibility obtained from auralization is basically {{the same as that}} which obtained in actual rooms under <b>different</b> <b>source</b> directivity conditions. By using auralization technique one can properly evaluate the subjective Chinese speech intelligibility even with <b>different</b> directional <b>sources...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{qualification}} method {{of a point}} cloud created by SfM (Structure-from-Motion) software. Recently, SfM software is popular for creating point clouds. Point clouds created by SfM Software seems to be correct, but in many cases, the result does not have correct scale, or does not have correct coordinates in reference coordinate system, and in these cases {{it is hard to}} evaluate the quality of the point clouds. To evaluate this correctness of the point clouds, we propose to use the difference between point clouds with <b>different</b> <b>source</b> of images. If the shape of the point clouds with <b>different</b> <b>source</b> of images is correct, two shapes of <b>different</b> <b>source</b> might be almost same. To compare the two or more shapes of point cloud, iterative-closest-point (ICP) is implemented. Transformation parameters (rotation and translation) are iteratively calculated so as to minimize sum of squares of distances. This paper describes the procedure of the evaluation and some test results...|$|R
