25|$|Early in {{the morning}} {{somebody}} wakens me, <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>my</b> eyes and that's when my roommate from the Mexico Olympic Games says, 'Get up, Monie was killed by Arab terrorists'. I knew him as a joker but that sounded too serious, so without thinking much, in my pyjamas, I went to the entrance door of the apartment, opened it and looked around. I have seen guards from the village and they were speaking to somebody that {{was standing in the}} entrance to apartment number one. I have noticed his dark skin and the hat and I listened, still without being afraid or thinking that something is very dangerous for me, and the guards are asking the permission to let the Red Cross enter apartment one and provide some aid to a wounded person and the man, he refuse. They said, 'Why should you be inhumane ?', and the man replied something like either, the Jews or the Israelis 'are not humane either.' At that point I understood that something is going on and I closed the door.|$|E
500|$|During his 16-year NBA career, Barkley was {{regarded}} as one of the most controversial, outspoken and dominating players in the history of basketball. His impact on the sport went beyond his rebounding titles, assists, scoring and physical play. His confrontational mannerisms often led to technical fouls and fines on the court, and his larger than life persona sometimes gave rise to national controversy off of it, such as when he was featured in ads that rejected pro athletes as role models and declared, [...] "I am not a role model." [...] Although his words often led to controversy, according to Barkley his mouth was never the cause because it always spoke the truth. He stated, [...] "I don't create controversies. They're there long before <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>my</b> mouth. I just bring them to your attention." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Sing for Me" [...] {{is a power}} ballad, with a {{duration}} of four minutes (...) [...] Its instrumentation consists of [...] "soft" [...] strings, a [...] "delicate" [...] piano melody and [...] "80s power ballad-type drums" [...] at its close. The key in which the structure was composed is changed {{during the course of the}} song. Aguilera's vocals span from E♭3 to E♭5. Aguilera's vocal performance garnered a comparison to Gabby Douglas and the vocal gymnastics that she projects from Mike Wass for Idolator. He also noted that although Carey would consider the vocals runs as [...] "over-the-top", they fit with the nature of the song. The song features a [...] "thunderous" [...] ironic chorus which consists of the lyrics Cause when <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>my</b> mouth, my whole heart comes out." [...] According to Chris Younie for 4Music, Aguilera belts the song out [...] "as if her life depends on it." [...] The [...] "reflective ballad" [...] may be what was created as a result of Aguilera singing [...] "Beautiful" [...] alone in her bedroom after the weak commercial response of Bionic. It represents a [...] "fine line" [...] between the [...] "her hurt over the Bionic backlash and the woe-is-me territory she occasionally veers into on some of the album’s worst tracks." [...] Aguilera tries to [...] "shake her insecurities" [...] during the lines [...] "I don't care what the world thinks or how I sound." [...] According to Annie Zaleski for The A.V. Club, Aguilera [...] "discusses working through regret and reclaiming her sense of self." ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{asked about}} his {{religious}} or spiritual views, Seeger replied: [...] "I feel most spiritual when I’m out in the woods. I feel part of nature. Or {{looking up at the}} stars. [...] I was an atheist. Now I say, it's all according to your definition of God. According to my definition of God, I'm not an atheist. Because I think God is everything. Whenever <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>my</b> eyes I'm looking at God. Whenever I'm listening to something I'm listening to God.". He {{was a member of a}} Unitarian Universalist Church in New York.|$|E

6000|$|... "I pulled back, made fast {{again to}} the jetty, {{and then went to}} sleep at last. I had faced the silence of the East. I had heard some of its languages.
