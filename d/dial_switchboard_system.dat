500|$|Between 1987 and 1990, Greyhound Lines' former parent {{continued}} to be called Greyhound Corp., confusing passengers and investors alike. Greyhound Corp. retained both Premier Cruise Lines, and ten Greyhound-brand non-bus subsidiaries, such as Greyhound Leisure Services, Inc. (an operator of airport and cruise ship duty-free shops), and Greyhound Exhibits. In March 1990, the former conglomerate parent {{changed its name to}} Greyhound Dial. [...] Because Greyhound <b>Dial's</b> <b>switchboard</b> {{continued to}} get questions from misdirected bus passengers, it ultimately changed its name to Dial Corporation in March 1991, to eliminate any association with bus travel.|$|R

50|$|Sound {{branding}} also {{encompasses the}} use of targeted audio messages by organizations to communicate with customers over the telephone, known as on-hold marketing or on-hold messaging. These messages are typically deployed on an organizations interactive voice response (IVR) <b>switchboard</b> <b>system</b> or when customers are placed on hold and incorporate short, informative voice messages often accompanied by music.|$|R
50|$|In tele{{communication}}, a called-party camp-on is {{a communication}} system service feature {{that enables the}} system to complete an access attempt in spite of issuance of a user blocking signal. This is most often found in a <b>switchboard</b> <b>system</b> at a company. Instead of going to voicemail or simply sitting on hold until the line is free, this feature places you in a queue whereby the moment the line clears, the call will be put through.|$|R

50|$|As {{telephone}} exchanges converted to automatic (<b>dial)</b> service, <b>switchboards</b> continued to serve specialized purposes. Before {{the advent of}} direct-dialed long distance calls, a subscriber would need to contact the long-distance operator in order to place a toll call. In large cities, there was often a special number, such as 112, which would ring the long-distance operator directly. Elsewhere, the subscriber would ask the local operator to ring the long-distance operator.|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a method for}} discriminative training of a language model that makes use of syntactic features. We follow a reranking approach, where a baseline recogniser is used to produce 1000 -best output for each acoustic input, and a second “reranking ” model is then used to choose an utterance from these 1000 -best lists. The reranking model makes use of syntactic features together with a parameter estimation method {{that is based on}} the perceptron algorithm. We describe experiments on the Switchboard speech recognition task. The syntactic features provide an additional 0. 3 % reduction in test–set error rate beyond the model of (Roark et al., 2004 a; Roark et al., 2004 b) (significant at p < 0. 001), which makes use of a discriminatively trained n-gram model, giving a total reduction of 1. 2 % over the baseline <b>Switchboard</b> <b>system.</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|A major {{renovation}} project, lasting from 1985 to 1987, restored {{the building to}} its original 18th century condition. [...] Non-original walls and partitions were removed, opening the hallways in the two wings for free movement, and the main lobby and first floor foyer were restored. For the exterior, the roof, soffit, and facis were repaired and the brickwork was repainted in a Colonial ivory. The three porches, {{on the front and}} one on each wing, and the chestnut pillars were restored and reconstructed. The basement was converted into offices for the clerical staff and the mailroom. The electrical wiring, ventilation <b>system,</b> telephone, and <b>switchboard</b> <b>system</b> were replaced. Overall, this restoration cost $800,000 and was funded by private sources generated through the College's [...] "Century III Fund" [...] capital campaign. The newly restored building housed the President’s Office and other administrative offices, including Development, Public Information, and Admissions Offices. It also served as a welcome center for prospective students and campus visitors. On Founders Day 1993, the building was rededicated as John McMillan Hall.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we show how a discriminative {{objective}} function such as Maximum Mutual Information (MMI) {{can be combined}} with a prior distribution over the HMM parameters to give a discriminative Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimate for HMM training. The prior distribution can be based around the Maximum Likelihood (ML) parameter estimates, leading to a technique previously referred to as I-smoothing; or for adaptation it can be based around a MAP estimate of the ML parameters, leading to what we call MMI-MAP. This latter approach is shown to be effective for task adaptation, where data from one task (Voicemail) is used to adapt a HMM set trained on another task (Switchboard). It is shown that MMI-MAP results in a 2. 1 % absolute reduction in word error rate relative to standard ML-MAP with 30 hours of Voicemail task adaptation data starting from a MMI-trained <b>Switchboard</b> <b>system.</b> This is used to derive the update formulae for MMI. Section 3 describes the use of weak-sense auxiliary functions for {{the case of a}} prior distribution and introduces MMI-MAP. distribution is included.

5000|$|Each pair of plugs {{was part}} of a cord circuit with a switch {{associated}} that let the operator participate in the call. Each jack had a light above it that lit when the telephone receiver was lifted (the earliest systems required a generator on the phone to be cranked by hand). Lines from the central office were usually arranged along the bottom row. Before the advent of operator distance dialing and customer Direct <b>Dial</b> (DDD) calling, <b>switchboard</b> operators would work with their counterparts in the distant central office to complete long distance calls. With the development of computerized telephone dialing systems, many telephone calls which previously required a live operator can be placed automatically by the calling party without additional human intervention. Switchboard operators are typically required to have very strong communication skills.|$|R
2500|$|Peggy Caserta and Seth Morgan {{had both}} {{failed to meet}} Joplin the Friday {{immediately}} prior to her death, October 2, and Joplin had been expecting both of them to keep her company that night. According to Caserta, Joplin was saddened that neither of her friends visited her at the Landmark as they had promised. During the 24 hours Joplin lived after this disappointment, Caserta did not phone her to explain why she had failed to show up. Caserta admitted to waiting until late Saturday night to <b>dial</b> the Landmark <b>switchboard,</b> only to learn that Joplin had instructed the desk clerk not to accept any incoming phone calls for her after midnight. [...] Morgan did speak to Joplin via telephone within 24 hours of her death, {{but it is not}} known whether he admitted to her that he had broken his promise.|$|R
50|$|Seems {{to be some}} history missing above - in 1967-1968 I {{commanded}} D company, 78th Signal battalion at Ft Lewis, Washington, {{where the}} battalion was reactivated in late 1966. It was a Corps Area Signal Bn with A, B, C, D and HQS companies (and the 208th Signal Company attached for admin purposes). The 4 line companies were identical, each with the mission to install, operate and maintain multichannel radio and cable communications {{in conjunction with other}} Corps Area Battalions. Each company basically was responsible for setting up a combat area signal center and tying that center into adjacent area centers with our multichannel radio (AN/TRC-24) and cable (Spiral-4) systems. Army units in our assigned AO then would hook into our telephone <b>switchboard,</b> teletype <b>systems</b> and use our comm center services.|$|R
30|$|When McGowan {{looked at}} the problem his way—from more than one direction—he noticed two things. First, no one could explain to his {{satisfaction}} why AT&T deserved its long-distance monopoly. “People said AT&T is so smart and so loved and so big,” he recalls. “Or they said that’s {{just the way it}} is. But I once worked for a railroad that had its own phone <b>system,</b> <b>switchboards</b> and all, so I knew better.” Second, he could see that a lean competitor with lower overhead could underprice the giant (Nulty 1992).|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} a new conversational speech task [...] recognizing call-center speech [...] using data collected from Dragon's own technical support line. We compare performance of models trained from conversational telephone speech (the Switchboard corpus) and models trained from predominantly read, microphone speech, and report {{on a series of}} experiments focusing on adapting the microphone speech models to the telephone channel and conversational task. We also discuss the importance of task-specific language model data. We benchmark our test set by comparing the performance of our 1998 <b>Switchboard</b> Evaluation <b>system</b> to that of our simpler call-center system. 1. INTRODUCTION In this paper we investigate what happens when we take models trained for other tasks/domains and apply them to a new task for which we have no transcribed data: recognition of telephone calls to Dragon Systems' technical support line.

40|$|Abstract—Minimum Bayes-Risk (MBR) speech recognizers {{have been}} shown to yield {{improvements}} over the conventional maximum a-posteriori probability (MAP) decoders through N-best list rescoring and search over word lattices. We present a Segmental Minimum Bayes-Risk decoding (SMBR) framework that simplifies the implementation of MBR recognizers through the segmentation of the N-best lists or lattices over which the recognition is to be performed. This paper presents lattice cutting procedures that underly SMBR decoding. Two of these procedures are based on a risk minimization criterion while a third one is guided by word-level confidence scores. In conjunction with SMBR decoding, these lattice segmentation procedures give consistent improvements in recognition word error rate (WER) on the Switchboard corpus. We also discuss an application of risk-based lattice cutting to multiple-system SMBR decoding and show that it is related to other system combination techniques such as ROVER. This strategy combines lattices produced from multiple ASR systems and is found to give WER improvements in a <b>Switchboard</b> evaluation <b>system.</b> Index Terms—ASR system combination, extended-ROVER, lattice cutting, minimum Bayes-risk decoding, segmental minimu...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} our continuing {{work on the}} development of a hybrid SVM/HMM speech recognition system. The original hybrid system was evaluated on the OGI Alphadigits corpus and performed at 11. 0 % WER, compared to 11. 9 % for a triphone mixture-Gaussian HMM system. In a new set of experiments reported here, the hybrid system performs at 10. 6 % WER on the Alphadigits task using a simple score combination mechanism. On a largevocabulary task, <b>SWITCHBOARD,</b> the hybrid <b>system</b> improves the performance over the baseline HMM-based system from 41. 6 % to 40. 6 % WER. This is the first time SVMs have been applied to a complex large-vocabulary task. Several oracle experiments are discussed which demonstrate the potential benefit of this approach over traditional HMM systems. 1...|$|R
40|$|In today’s {{competitive}} {{power transmission}} and distribution (T&D) industry the need for predictive and scheduled maintenance of the infrastructure has become a vital necessity. On-line condition monitoring of underground cables and switchboards for the dominant failure mechanism of Partial Discharge (PD) has been in use for some time now. It {{has been shown that}} on-line measurements for monitoring the activity and the degradation severity of the PD can not be calibrated in terms of their charge (pC). Although the direct interpretation of the measured voltage gives some indication, for more profound results specific locations have to be monitored over time to record the evolution of the amplitude and/or phase shift (trending). For these reasons a pilot on-line cable monitoring system is currently being implemented in a substation of the Electricity Authority of Cyprus (EAC) on selected breakers of the 11 kV <b>switchboard.</b> This <b>system</b> will alleviate the need for the physical presence of expert personnel on site, as measurements from sensors that will be non-invasively installed will automatically be recorded and processed on a continuous basis thus allowing potential dangerous PD events to be captured. Furthermore, the proposed system will implement permanent capacitive couplers that offer better sensitivity compared to other sensors. In this paper the setup and calibration of these sensors, together with some preliminary results will be presented...|$|R
40|$|After {{identifying}} the general {{structure of a}} POTS (Plain Old Telephone System) Switching System we model individual components as communicating finite state machines. Formulating the finite state machines in Promela (Process Meta Language) allows us to verify general and specific properties of the model using the model-checker Spin. Modelling operational systems imposes design decisions, which we will consider in the appropriate context. 1 Introduction The development of telephone switching <b>systems</b> from manual <b>switchboards</b> to automated <b>systems</b> has required the development of control software. The development process of the switching software has in general been complex and evolutionary; this is sometimes reflected in the software which may be large, poorly structured and/or undocumented legacy code.

40|$|Model-checking is {{becoming}} very popular for automated reasoning about hardware and software. The input {{can be in}} any language provided there is a translation to transition systems or Kripke structures; properties are then expressed in a temporal logic. Telephone switching systems are concurrent systems which are naturally described by a composition of interacting finite automata. We describe a model of one switching system in IO-Automata, express it in Promela (process meta language) and then formulate certain properties in LTL (linear temporal logic). Using the model-checker Spin, we have attempted to verify the model with respect to some properties. A particular challenge is that even a simple switching system leads to state space explosion. 1 Introduction Telephone switching systems have developed from manual <b>switchboards</b> to automated <b>systems.</b> The latter require control software, which is usually large, unstructured and not well documented (legacy software).

40|$|This project {{entails the}} design and {{assembly}} of the photovoltaic <b>system,</b> <b>switchboard</b> panel enclosure, and battery enclosure for the DC House’s main electrical system. The intended purpose of this project is to provide the electrical framework necessary for future students to easily modify and add to this rendition of the DC House. The principle design implements a variety of renewable energy sources, however this senior project only uses solar power {{in order to maintain}} a manageable scope. Each of these renewable energy sources are stepped down to a voltage of 24 V and input to a Multi Input Single Output DC to DC converter (MISO) located within the switchboard panel enclosure. The MISO then connects to a set of batteries which power the loads of the DC House operating at 48 V. The finished assembly of the photovoltaic array and panel enclosure will then be retrofitted to a small house located at the Student Experimental Farm (SEF). After the retrofit, the electrical system will be tested at the source and load sides to ensure proper system functionality...|$|R
40|$|Modern medical {{practice}} {{gives rise to}} a significant volume of electronic data, and numerous online personal health record (PHR) banking services have emerged to satisfy the growing demand for self-management of this data. These services provide interoperable, centralized repositories that collect this data and make it ubiquitously accessible to patients, providers and referring practitioners by means of a variety of Internet-capable handheld devices. However, these Web-based PHRs currently offer very limited or no support for medical imagery. This is primarily attributed to the security concerns, heterogeneity in the data standards of medical images, and compatibility issues among target platforms. With ever increasing reliance on medical imaging data, the accessibility and interactive visualisation of said data are now becoming a fundamental requirement in PHRs. The aim of our study is to make biomedical image data available for use with handheld devices by means of such web-based PHR, so as to increase patients' access to their image data, and facilitate practitioner collaboration and review, without reducing the mobility that characterises these records. Our proposed system consists of a Web-based interface for the review of nuclear medicine imaging, in particular, dual-modality PET/CT images, on handheld devices, which is embedded within an online PHR, as well as a <b>switchboard</b> dispatch <b>system</b> that allows an archival image server (i. e., hospital information system) to respond securely to interactive visualisation requests made over the Internet. Our support for the complex and large data of dual-modal imaging ensures our work supports the latest in biomedical imaging standards. A key aspect of Internet-based systems is the importance of patient privacy and security issues. Our system uses industry-standard encryption and a remote-service architecture to address the perceived security limitations of PHR systems, and takes advantage of the same Web standards as th- e PHRs themselves to deliver a consistent user experience across all target platforms. Our experimental results suggest that by enabling PHRs to propagate medical image data to Internet capable devices, our system can potentially improve the utility of health record banking.
