5|$|The thyroid hormones {{are created}} from thyroglobulin. This is a protein within the <b>follicular</b> space that is {{originally}} created within the {{rough endoplasmic reticulum}} of <b>follicular</b> cells and then transported into the <b>follicular</b> space. Thyroglobulin contains 123 units of tyrosine, which reacts with iodine within the <b>follicular</b> space.|$|E
5|$|The luteal {{phase of}} the menstrual cycle {{is about the same}} length in most {{individuals}} (mean 14.13 days, SD 1.41 days) whereas the <b>follicular</b> phase tends to show much more variability (log-normally distributed with 95% of individuals having <b>follicular</b> phases between 10.3 and 16.3 days). The <b>follicular</b> phase also seems to get significantly shorter with age (geometric mean 14.2 days in women aged 18–24 vs. 10.4 days in women aged 40–44).|$|E
5|$|Females {{have been}} found to {{experience}} different eating habits at different stages of their menstrual cycle, with food intake being higher during the luteal phase than the <b>follicular</b> phase. Food intake increases by approximately 10% during the luteal phase compared to the <b>follicular</b> phase.|$|E
5|$|Postovulatory follicles are {{structures}} formed after oocyte release; they do {{not have}} endocrine function, present a wide irregular lumen, and are rapidly reabsorbed in a process involving the apoptosis of <b>follicular</b> cells. A degenerative process called <b>follicular</b> atresia reabsorbs vitellogenic oocytes not spawned. This process can also occur, but less frequently, in oocytes in other development stages.|$|E
5|$|The {{core of a}} {{follicle}} {{is surrounded}} by a single layer of <b>follicular</b> cells. When stimulated by thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), these secrete the thyroid hormones T3 and T4. They do this by transporting and metabolising the thyroglobulin contained in the colloid. <b>Follicular</b> cells vary in shape from flat to cuboid to columnar, depending on how active they are.|$|E
5|$|At the {{microscopic}} level, {{there are three}} primary features of the thyroid—follicles, <b>follicular</b> cells, and parafollicular cells, first discovered by Geoffery Websterson in 1664.|$|E
5|$|Estrogen {{levels may}} affect thyroid behavior. For example, during the luteal phase (when {{estrogen}} levels are lower), {{the velocity of}} blood flow in the thyroid is lower than during the <b>follicular</b> phase (when estrogen levels are higher).|$|E
5|$|Scattered among <b>follicular</b> {{cells and}} in {{spaces between the}} spherical follicles are another type of thyroid cell, parafollicular cells. These cells secrete {{calcitonin}} and so are also called C cells.|$|E
5|$|The {{degree of}} {{ovulation}} suppression in progestogen-only contraceptives {{depends on the}} progestogen activity and dose. Low dose progestogen-only contraceptives—traditional progestogen only pills, subdermal implants Norplant and Jadelle, and intrauterine system Mirena—inhibit ovulation in about 50% of cycles and rely mainly on other effects, such as thickening of cervical mucus, for their contraceptive effectiveness. Intermediate dose progestogen-only contraceptives—the progestogen-only pill Cerazette and the subdermal implant Nexplanon—allow some <b>follicular</b> development but more consistently inhibit ovulation in 97–99% of cycles. The same cervical mucus changes occur as with very low-dose progestogens. High-dose, progestogen-only contraceptives—the injectables Depo-Provera and Noristerat—completely inhibit <b>follicular</b> development and ovulation.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} {{phases of}} the menstrual cycle correlate with women’s moods. In some cases, hormones released during the menstrual cycle can cause behavioral changes in females; mild to severe mood changes can occur. The menstrual cycle phase and ovarian hormones may contribute to increased empathy in women. The natural shift of hormone levels during the different {{phases of the}} menstrual cycle has been studied in conjunction with test scores. When completing empathy exercises, women in the <b>follicular</b> stage of their menstrual cycle performed better than women in their midluteal phase. A significant correlation between progesterone levels {{and the ability to}} accurately recognize emotion was found. Performances on emotion recognition tasks were better when women had lower progesterone levels. Women in the <b>follicular</b> stage showed higher emotion recognition accuracy than their midluteal phase counterparts. Women were found to react more to negative stimuli when in midluteal stage over the women in the <b>follicular</b> stage, perhaps indicating more reactivity to social stress during that menstrual cycle phase. Overall, it has been found that women in the <b>follicular</b> phase demonstrated better performance in tasks that contain empathetic traits.|$|E
5|$|The <b>follicular</b> {{phase is}} {{the first part of}} the ovarian cycle. During this phase, the ovarian follicles mature and get ready to release an egg. The latter part of this phase {{overlaps}} with the proliferative phase of the uterine cycle.|$|E
5|$|While {{some forms}} of birth control do not affect the menstrual cycle, {{hormonal}} contraceptives work by disrupting it. Progestogen negative feedback decreases the pulse frequency of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release by the hypothalamus, which decreases the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) by the anterior pituitary. Decreased levels of FSH inhibit <b>follicular</b> development, preventing an increase in estradiol levels. Progestogen negative feedback {{and the lack of}} estrogen positive feedback on LH release prevent a mid-cycle LH surge. Inhibition of <b>follicular</b> development and the absence of a LH surge prevent ovulation.|$|E
5|$|Elephants are {{polygynous}} breeders, and copulations {{are most}} frequent {{during the peak}} of the wet season. A cow in oestrus releases chemical signals (pheromones) in her urine and vaginal secretions to signal her readiness to mate. A bull will follow a potential mate and assess her condition with the flehmen response, which requires the male to collect a chemical sample with his trunk and bring it to the vomeronasal organ. The oestrous cycle of a cow lasts 14–16 weeks with a 4–6-week <b>follicular</b> phase and an 8- to 10-week luteal phase. While most mammals have one surge of luteinizing hormone during the <b>follicular</b> phase, elephants have two. The first (or anovulatory) surge, could signal to males that the female is in oestrus by changing her scent, but ovulation does not occur until the second (or ovulatory) surge. Fertility rates in cows decline around 45–50 years of age.|$|E
5|$|The {{menstrual cycle}} can be {{described}} by the ovarian or uterine cycle. The ovarian cycle describes changes {{that occur in the}} follicles of the ovary whereas the uterine cycle describes changes in the endometrial lining of the uterus. Both cycles can be divided into three phases. The ovarian cycle consists of the <b>follicular</b> phase, ovulation, and the luteal phase whereas the uterine cycle consists of menstruation, proliferative phase, and secretory phase.|$|E
5|$|About 20,000 protein coding {{genes are}} {{expressed}} in human cells and 70% of these genes {{are expressed in}} the normal thyroid. Some 250 of these genes are more specifically expressed in the thyroid with about 20 genes being highly thyroid specific. The corresponding specific proteins are mainly involved in thyroid hormone synthesis, such as thyroglobulin, TPO and IYD, and expressed in <b>follicular</b> cells. Other proteins elevated in the thyroid are calcitonin related proteins such as CALCA and CALCB, expressed in the parafollicular c-cells.|$|E
5|$|Hip and elbow {{dysplasia}} are common. Giant Schnauzers {{are also}} prone to eye {{problems such as}} keratoconjunctivitis sicca, glaucoma, cataracts, multifocal retinal dysplasia, and generalized progressive retinal atrophy. They are also prone to skin diseases, such as seasonal flank alopecia, vitiligo, and <b>follicular</b> cysts. Cancer of the skin is common in dark-colored dogs, with the most frequently occurring varieties being melanoma of the limbs and digits, and squamous cell carcinoma of the digit. This susceptibility occurs because melanoma {{is caused by a}} defect in the melanocytes, the cells that darken the color of the skin. Noncancerous skin tumors are also common.|$|E
5|$|In most cases, thyroid cancer {{presents}} as a painless {{mass in the}} neck. It is {{very unusual}} for thyroid cancers to present with other symptoms, although in some cases cancer may cause hyperthyroidism. Most malignant thyroid cancers are papillary, followed by <b>follicular,</b> medullary, and thyroid lymphoma. Because of the prominence of the thyroid gland, cancer is often detected earlier {{in the course of}} disease as the cause of a nodule, which may undergo fine needle aspiration. Thyroid function tests will help reveal whether the nodule produces excess thyroid hormones. A radioactive iodine uptake test can help reveal the activity and location of the cancer and metastases.|$|E
5|$|Ovulation is {{the second}} phase of the ovarian cycle in which a mature egg is {{released}} from the ovarian follicles into the oviduct. During the <b>follicular</b> phase, estradiol suppresses release of luteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary gland. When the egg has nearly matured, levels of estradiol reach a threshold above which this effect is reversed and estrogen stimulates the production of a large amount of LH. This process, known as the LH surge, starts around day12 of the average cycle and may last 48 hours.|$|E
5|$|Breastfeeding causes {{negative}} feedback to occur on pulse secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Depending {{on the strength}} of the {{negative feedback}}, breastfeeding women may experience complete suppression of <b>follicular</b> development, but no ovulation, or normal menstrual cycle may resume. Suppression of ovulation is more likely when suckling occurs more frequently. The production of prolactin in response to suckling is important to maintaining lactational amenorrhea. On average, women who are fully breastfeeding whose infants suckle frequently experience a return of menstruation at fourteen and a half months postpartum. There is a wide range of response among individual breastfeeding women, however, with some experiencing return of menstruation at two months and others remaining amenorrheic for up to 42 months postpartum.|$|E
5|$|Combined {{hormonal}} contraceptives {{include both}} an estrogen and a progestogen. Estrogen negative {{feedback on the}} anterior pituitary greatly decreases the release of FSH, which makes combined hormonal contraceptives more effective at inhibiting <b>follicular</b> development and preventing ovulation. Estrogen also reduces the incidence of irregular breakthrough bleeding. Several combined hormonal contraceptives—the pill, NuvaRing, and the contraceptive patch—are usually used {{in a way that}} causes regular withdrawal bleeding. In a normal cycle, menstruation occurs when estrogen and progesterone levels drop rapidly. Temporarily discontinuing use of combined hormonal contraceptives (a placebo week, not using patch or ring for a week) has a similar effect of causing the uterine lining to shed. If withdrawal bleeding is not desired, combined hormonal contraceptives may be taken continuously, although this increases the risk of breakthrough bleeding.|$|E
5|$|No skin {{impressions}} {{have ever}} been found in association with fossils of Deinonychus. Nonetheless, {{the evidence suggests that}} the Dromaeosauridae, including Deinonychus, had feathers. The genus Microraptor is both older geologically and more primitive phylogenetically than Deinonychus, and within the same family. Multiple fossils of Microraptor preserve pennaceous, vaned feathers like those of modern birds on the arms, legs, and tail, along with covert and contour feathers. Velociraptor is geologically younger than Deinonychus, but even more closely related (within the subfamily velociraptorinae, see Classification, below). A specimen of Velociraptor has been found with quill knobs on the ulna. Quill knobs are where the <b>follicular</b> ligaments attached, and are a direct indicator of feathers of modern aspect.|$|E
5|$|Poliovirus {{enters the}} body through the mouth, infecting the first cells {{with which it}} comes in contact — the pharynx and {{intestinal}} mucosa. It gains entry by binding to an immunoglobulin-like receptor, known as the poliovirus receptor or CD155, on the cell membrane. The virus then hijacks the host cell's own machinery, and begins to replicate. Poliovirus divides within gastrointestinal cells for about a week, from where it spreads to the tonsils (specifically the <b>follicular</b> dendritic cells residing within the tonsilar germinal centers), the intestinal lymphoid tissue including the M cells of Peyer's patches, and the deep cervical and mesenteric lymph nodes, where it multiplies abundantly. The virus is subsequently absorbed into the bloodstream.|$|E
5|$|Mating {{occurs during}} the winter months. Once a female quoll has been impregnated, the folds on her abdomen convert into a pouch that opens at the back. The {{gestation}} period is 21 days. A baby quoll, or pup, {{is the size of}} a grain of rice. Up to 18 quolls are born in each litter, but only six survive the first two weeks. The survivors stay in their mother's pouch for eight weeks, suckling on one of the mother's six teats for milk. During the ninth week, the pups venture out of the pouch and onto the mother's back, where they remain for six weeks. Quolls reaches maturity when they are one year old, and have a natural lifespan of between two and five years. A 2008 study of the pouches of tiger quolls reported the pouches' appearance' were reliable indicators of the quolls' reproductive status: during the <b>follicular</b> phase, pouches were found to be red and have many secretions. After ovulation, pouches became deep and wet. Researchers can use this information to determine where a female quoll is in her ovarian cycle, which is anticipated to be helpful in breeding management.|$|E
5|$|The luteal {{phase is}} {{the final phase of}} the ovarian cycle and it {{corresponds}} to the secretory phase of the uterine cycle. During the luteal phase, the pituitary hormones FSH and LH cause the remaining parts of the dominant follicle to transform into the corpus luteum, which produces progesterone. The increased progesterone in the adrenals starts to induce the production of estrogen. The hormones produced by the corpus luteum also suppress production of the FSH and LH that the corpus luteum needs to maintain itself. Consequently, the level of FSH and LH fall quickly over time, and the corpus luteum subsequently atrophies. Falling levels of progesterone trigger menstruation {{and the beginning of the}} next cycle. From the time of ovulation until progesterone withdrawal has caused menstruation to begin, the process typically takes about two weeks, with 14 days considered normal. For an individual woman, the <b>follicular</b> phase often varies in length from cycle to cycle; by contrast, the length of her luteal phase will be fairly consistent from cycle to cycle.|$|E
25|$|The <b>follicular</b> phase (or proliferative phase) is {{the phase}} of the menstrual cycle during which the ovarian follicles mature. The <b>follicular</b> phase lasts from the {{beginning}} of menstruation to the start of ovulation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Follicular</b> cyst, {{the most}} common type of ovarian cyst. In menstruating women, a {{follicle}} containing the ovum, an unfertilized egg, will rupture during ovulation. If this does not occur, a <b>follicular</b> cyst of more than 2.5cm diameter may result.|$|E
25|$|<b>Follicular</b> {{lymphoma}} (follicle centre cell lymphoma) are CD10+.|$|E
25|$|T4 is {{synthesised}} in {{the thyroid}} gland <b>follicular</b> cells as follows.|$|E
25|$|Estrogen was {{originally}} included in oral contraceptives for better cycle control (to stabilize the endometrium and thereby {{reduce the incidence}} of breakthrough bleeding), but was also found to inhibit <b>follicular</b> development and help prevent ovulation. Estrogen negative feedback on the anterior pituitary greatly decreases the release of FSH, which inhibits <b>follicular</b> development and helps prevent ovulation.|$|E
25|$|Newly {{reclassified}} variant: noninvasive <b>follicular</b> thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features {{is considered}} an indolent tumor of limited biologic potential.|$|E
25|$|Estrogen levels vary {{through the}} menstrual cycle, with levels highest {{near the end}} of the <b>follicular</b> phase just before ovulation.|$|E
25|$|The endocytosed vesicles fuse {{with the}} lysosomes of the <b>follicular</b> cell. The {{lysosomal}} enzymes cleave the T4 from the iodinated thyroglobulin.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms appear predictably {{during the}} luteal (premenstrual) phase, reduce or {{disappear}} predictably shortly before or during menstruation, and remain absent during the <b>follicular</b> (preovulatory) phase.|$|E
25|$|Ovarian cysts may be {{classified}} {{according to whether}} they are {{a variant of the}} normal menstrual cycle, referred to as a functional or <b>follicular</b> cyst.|$|E
25|$|Progestogen {{negative}} feedback decreases the pulse frequency of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release by the hypothalamus, which decreases {{the release of}} follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and greatly decreases the release of luteinizing hormone (LH) by the anterior pituitary. Decreased levels of FSH inhibit <b>follicular</b> development, preventing an increase in estradiol levels. Progestogen {{negative feedback}} {{and the lack of}} estrogen positive feedback on LH release prevent a mid-cycle LH surge. Inhibition of <b>follicular</b> development and the absence of a LH surge prevent ovulation.|$|E
25|$|Hair and Scalp. The scalp {{is rarely}} {{affected}} by a condition known as lichen planopilaris, acuminatus, <b>follicular</b> lichen planus, and peripilaris, characterised by violaceous, adherent <b>follicular</b> scale with progressive scarring alopecia. While lichen planus and lichen planopilaris may occur together, aside from sharing the term ‘lichen’ and revealing inflammation on skin biopsy, there is neither established data on their co-occurrence nor data to suggest a common etiology. Lichen planopilaris is considered an orphan disease with no definitive prevalence data and no proven effective treatments.|$|E
