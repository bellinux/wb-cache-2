5000|$|The risk {{of being}} laid off varies {{depending}} on the workplace and country a person is working in. Unemployment compensation in any country or workplace is a function which has two main factors. The first factor of unemployment compensation depends on the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>unemployment</b> benefits in a workplace outlined in an employee handbook. The second factor is the risk of inequality being conditioned upon the political regime type in the country an employee is working in. For example, in Canada, Dorion (1995) states that white-collar workers who have been made redunant receive higher re-employment wages, than those in blue-collar occupations as there job is regarded as being of a higher status than blue collar workers, whereas in France, Margolis (1999, 2002) finds that workers who {{have been laid off}} have smaller unemployment periods and higher re-employment earnings in comparison with other unemployed people.

40|$|This study {{examines}} whether the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> aggregate <b>unemployment</b> by duration affects individual well-being. Two hypotheses are provided {{to explain how}} the shares of short-term (up to 3 months) and long-term (more than 1 year) unemployed people could affect the well-being of the employed and unemployed: The severity hypothesis and the flow hypothesis. Using data from almost 300, 000 individuals from 11 EU countries, an ordered probit estimator is used to analyze the impact <b>of</b> the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> aggregate <b>unemployment</b> by duration on individual well-being. We find significant evidence in favor of both the severity and the flow hypotheses. Hence, the fear of losing (or not finding) a job is more detrimental when the prospect is to remain unemployed for a longer time. At some point, however, both the employed and unemployed adapt to unemployment at the macro level. Using an alternative specification that allows for a duration-specific risk of becoming/being unemployed, we arrive at similar conclusions. What seems to bother people is thus not just the risk of becoming/remaining unemployed, but more so the risk of being out of work for 4 to 12 months. unemployment, unemployment duration, life satisfaction, happiness...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>unemployment</b> by duration on the level of unemployment. It explores one central as- sumption that is observed empirically: when the share of long-term (short-term) unemployed increases, the unemployment rate increases (decreases). By embodying this assumption in a standard equilibrium unemployment model we characterize the joint behavior of unemploy- ment and the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>unemployment</b> by duration. In the theoretical part of the paper an extension of the standard equilibrium unemployment model is provided where the average job finding prob- ability depends on the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>unemployment</b> by duration. In the empirical section we estimate a panel data model for 16 OECD countries to test the implications of the theoretical model. The main results are: First, in a steady state equilibrium the flow rates are larger, the larger the share of short-term unemployed. Second, out of steady state the unemployment rate increases (decreases) with the share of long-term (short-term) unemployed. Third, the larger the duration dependent job finding probabilities the larger the share of short term unemployed. Fourth, panel estimates for 16 OECD countries provide robust and significant evidence that an increase in the share of short- term (long-term) unemployment decreases (increases) the unemploy- ment rate. Therefore, the empirical evidence supports our hypotheses whereby (a) the reemployment probability decreases with an increasing spell of unemployment and (b) average exit rates have international differences. Hence, the different experiences with unemployment {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic can be explained by observed aggregated duration dependence and differences in the average exit rate. <b>Distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>Unemployment</b> by Duration, Duration Dependence...|$|E

40|$|Excerpt] There is {{a growing}} {{consensus}} among economists that reliance on aggregate demand policies alone will {{not be sufficient to}} move the economy to full employment with a nonaccelerating inflation rate, and that policies which alter the structure of labor markets will be required. While obvious structural policies such as public sector employment programs and training programs are the focus of current debate, many other public policies affect labor markets in subtle ways which may well adversely affect the level and <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> employment and <b>unemployment.</b> To help improve the inflation-unemployment tradeoff, policymakers should seek to marginally modify these policies, preserving their benefits while reducing their adverse labor market effects. To illustrate these points, this paper discusses the influence of public and private retirement policies on the level and <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> employment and <b>unemployment.</b> I focus on the Social Security system (OASDHl), the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), the amendment to the Age Discrimination in Employment Act that raised the permissible mandatory retirement age to 70, the Supreme Court decision in the Manhart case prohibiting sex differentials in employee pension contributions, and early retirement provisions negotiated in private collective bargaining agreements. Certainly, {{it would be difficult to}} criticize the intent of these policies. However, each of the public policies adversely affects the level or <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> employment and <b>unemployment.</b> I conclude by noting several reforms of the method of financing the Social Security system which would reduce the system 2 ̆ 7 s adverse labor market effects...|$|R
