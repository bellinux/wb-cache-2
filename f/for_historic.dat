5|$|Clwyd County Council and its six districts ceased {{operations}} at midnight on 1 April 1996, {{and local government}} was immediately transferred to the new principal areas of Conwy, Denbighshire, Flintshire and Wrexham. However, although bearing the same names, the boundaries of Flintshire and Denbighshire were substantially {{different from those of}} the earlier counties. As it happened, the county records <b>for</b> <b>historic</b> Flintshire had been retained at the Hawarden branch of the Clwyd Records Office while those <b>for</b> <b>historic</b> Denbighshire had continued to be held at the Ruthin branch, so there was no problem in segregating the records.|$|E

5|$|The castle's {{location}} was ostensibly chosen to protect England's south coast from raids by the French.

5|$|The {{lighthouse}} {{has been}} threatened by erosion for decades. In the 1930s, {{as a response}} to the erosion, a breakwater was constructed to protect the boat landing area. In 1996, the Connecticut Trust <b>for</b> <b>Historic</b> Preservation and the National Trust <b>for</b> <b>Historic</b> Preservation assisted the task of obtaining funding for a $4.5 million erosion-control project. The funds were approved in 1998 with the help of Connecticut Senators, Joseph Lieberman and Christopher Dodd and New Haven's Congressional Representative Rosa DeLauro. In 2001, the construction of a stone wall and creation of a buffer zone was completed. The second phase of the project calls for protective revetment on the south side of the island.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the first}} discoveries by Johannes Bureus {{in the late}} 16th century, these runestones have been {{frequently}} identified by scholars, with many stones discovered during a national search <b>for</b> <b>historic</b> monuments in the late 17th century.

5|$|A {{group of}} area {{residents}} initiated {{an effort to}} have the former West Michigan Pike designated {{what is now called}} a Pure Michigan Byway. The designation would prioritize the area <b>for</b> <b>historic</b> preservation grants. A Preserve America grant funded a survey from June 2007 through September 2010, the results of which were a set of reports through the Michigan State Historic Preservation Office on the historical nature of the West Michigan Pike. In 2011, the group {{was in the process of}} securing resolutions from municipalities along the highway in support of the designation. According to officials working on the byway, it can take up to seven years to complete the process. The initial proposals had the byway continuing to Mackinaw City, but as approved in 2016, it runs from New Buffalo on I-94 to Ludington, following US31 except between business loops at South Haven, Muskegon, Whitehallâ€“Montague and Pentwater.|$|E

5|$|Chicago Landmark is a {{designation}} of the Mayor of Chicago and the Chicago City Council <b>for</b> <b>historic</b> buildings and other sites in Chicago, Illinois, United States. Listed sites are selected after meeting {{a combination of}} criteria, including historical, economic, architectural, artistic, cultural, and social values. Once a site is designated as a landmark, it {{is subject to the}} Chicago Landmarks Ordinance, which requires that any alterations beyond routine maintenance, up to and including demolition, must have their permit reviewed by the Landmarks Commission. Many Chicago Landmarks are also listed on the National Register of Historic Places, providing federal tax support for preservation, and some are further designated National Historic Landmarks, providing additional federal oversight.|$|E

5|$|For most of {{its history}} the National Register has been {{administered}} by the National Park Service (NPS), an agency within the United States Department of the Interior. Its goals are to help property owners and interest groups, such as the National Trust <b>for</b> <b>Historic</b> Preservation, coordinate, identify, and protect historic sites in the United States. While National Register listings are mostly symbolic, their recognition of significance provides some financial incentive to owners of listed properties. Protection of the property is not guaranteed. During the nomination process, the property is evaluated {{in terms of the}} four criteria for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places. The application of those criteria {{has been the subject of}} criticism by academics of history and preservation, as well as the public and politicians.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, Koubek {{was hired}} to help {{renovate}} the long-shuttered, historic Willard Hotel. The original hotel (consisting of six townhouses joined together) was built in 1816, renovated and enlarged by leaseholder Henry Willard in 1847, and the current 12-story structure erected in 1901. Due to mismanagement and competition from more modern hotels, the Willard closed in 1968. With the redevelopment of Pennsylvania Avenue in the 1960s and 1970s, the Willard was threatened repeatedly with demolition. In May 1974, the National Trust <b>for</b> <b>Historic</b> Preservation paid Koubek $25,000 to study saving the hotel, either as a hotel, as a mixed-used structure, or as an office building. The Willard's owners, Charles Benenson and Robert Arnow, had earlier commissioned Koubek to design a modern office building for the site which would have required demolition of the structure.|$|E
