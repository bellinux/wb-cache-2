5|$|After Leif's <b>first</b> <b>trip</b> to Vinland, he {{returned}} to the family estate of Brattahlíð in Greenland, and started preaching Christianity to the Greenlanders.

Leif is last mentioned alive in 1019, and by 1025 he had passed on his chieftaincy of Eiríksfjǫrðr to another son, Thorkell. Nothing is mentioned about his death in the sagas—he probably died in Greenland some time between these dates.
