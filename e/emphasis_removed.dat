40|$|A {{great many}} {{arguments}} in philosophy turn on claims {{about what is}} possible, and in fact it’s difficult to overstate how central modal claims are {{in all areas of}} philosophy. Making claims about what could be and what must be is the bread-and-butter of philosophy. In philosophy of per # 1 mind, for example, it is contended that some of the best arguments for dualism hinge on a Paper # 1 modal premise. In recent years there has been a resurgence of debate about the merits of modal arguments for dualism, and this has in turn sparked interest in modal arguments generally. What makes for a good modal argument? How do we know that the crucial modal premises of such arguments are true? Hume offers the traditional answer in the Treatise: “ ‘Tis an established maxim in metaphysics, That whatever the mind clearly conceives includes the idea of possible existence, or, in other words, that nothing we imagine is absolutely impossible ” (I. ii. 2, <b>emphasis</b> <b>removed).</b> Hume is certainly right about this much: many in philosophy presume this established maxim.

40|$|Trade between {{developing}} countries, or South-South trade, {{has been}} growing rapidly in recent years following reductions in tariff barriers. However, significant barriers remain, and there is currently reluctance {{in many developing countries}} to undertake further reductions, with a preference instead for focusing on opening up access to developed country markets, or maintaining the status quo given that multilateral liberalisation may result in the erosion of preferential access enjoyed by some developing countries. This emphasis on Northern markets represents a missed opportunity for developing countries. To assess this we compare the potential effects of the removal of barriers on South-South trade with the gains from developed country liberalisation and from regional free trade areas within Africa, Asia and Latin America. A general equilibrium model, the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) model, containing information on preferential bilateral tariffs, is used to estimate the impacts. The results indicate that the opening up of Northern markets would provide annual welfare gains to developing countries of $ 22 billion. However, the removal of South-South barriers has the potential to generate gains 40 per cent larger. The results imply that giving greater <b>emphasis</b> to <b>removing</b> barriers between as well as within continents could prove a successful Southern survival strategy.

40|$|It has {{now been}} 21 months since President Nixon 2 ̆ 7 s Executive Order # 11643 was issued {{and there has been}} a {{complete}} annual reproductive cycle in the coyote population of the western states without any major influence by chemical controls. The use of mechanical controls, including non-lethal methods, and greater <b>emphasis</b> on <b>removing</b> only specific offending animals has been advocated during this time as a solution where coyotes prey on domestic animals. With this brief look back, what have been the results? We do not have absolute data on coyote numbers and livestock depredations resulting from this change in coyote management programs. We can, however, consider reports from state agencies in wildlife management and agriculture. In states that employed chemical controls prior to the Executive Order, these agencies report substantial increases in coyote numbers. Similar reports were given by ten Western Region Predator Research Committee members at their annual meeting in Hopland, California, in September of this year. These committee members also reported apparent increases in livestock losses to coyotes and observations by hunters, ranchers and county Extension agents substantiate those reports. The presence of the group here today gives additional evidence that the coyote problem is real. Moreover, it has not been solved by current mechanical and non-lethal controls in those states where chemical controls were removed by the Executive Order and federal policy...|$|R

The {{purpose of the present}} study was to investigate the effects of an integrated control strategy for schistosomiasis control. Methods An integrated control strategy for schistosomiasis japonica with <b>emphasis</b> on <b>removing</b> cattle from snail-infested grasslands, providing farmers with mechanized farm equipment, improving sanitation by supplying tap water and building lavatories and latrines and providing boats with fecal-matter containers was implemented in 107 villages of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, Jiangsu Province, China, during a 32 -month period from May 2005 to 2008, and the effectiveness was investigated. Results Following the effects of the comprehensive control, the snail habitat, infected snail habitat, snail infection rate, and S. japonicum prevalence in both humans and livestock all appeared a declining trend year by year, with reductions of 47. 88 %, 94. 29 %, 92. 55 %, 96. 94 %, and 100 % compared with those before the comprehensive control. In addition, all of the 17 counties achieved the infection control in 2007, and 7 reached the criteria of transmission control in 2008. The confirmed snail habitats reduced from 107 to 20, and the acute infections have also been controlled for 2 successive years since 2007. Conclusions The integrated control strategy for schistosomiasis japonica is effective to control the transmission of S. japonicum. </p...|$|R
40|$|SummaryPurposeDespite recent {{advances}} {{in the management of}} epilepsy the efforts to assess knowledge, attitude and practice towards epilepsy are limited, particularly in the developing countries. To delineate the magnitude and scope of this problem, present study was conducted to assess the knowledge attitude and practice about epilepsy amongst schoolteachers in Northeast Uttar Pradesh, the most populous state of India. The basis of involving schoolteachers was their special role in Indian society with their larger interaction among the segment of population most affected by epilepsy. MethodsSimple self-administered questionnaires were sent to the schoolteachers of primary and secondary levels. The questionnaires contained 15 questions related to awareness and attitudes towards epilepsy with details of first aid management of seizures. ResultsWe found that 97 % of schoolteachers were aware of epilepsy with majority including it as a brain disease. A substantial proportion (38. 2 %) was uncertain about relation of epilepsy and insanity and 31. 7 % felt epileptics to be of below average intelligence. Only about half of them (55. 3 %) preferred their children to play with an epileptic. An overwhelming no was obvious about marriage with an epileptic (86. 8 %). Only 27. 8 % of the respondents had given any first aid measure to a seizing patient with only 16. 3 % giving it properly. ConclusionDespite a great degree of awareness about epilepsy amongst schoolteachers in India negative and wrong attitudes still exist. Stress on proper first aid measure to a seizing child needs greater <b>emphasis</b> to <b>remove</b> fright and fear amongst the public. Besides adequate management, public education to address existing biases and fear are equally important {{to improve the quality of}} life of epileptics...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction Gastric outlet {{obstruction}} usually presents with non-bilious vomiting, colicky epigastric pain, loss {{of appetite}} and occasionally, upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Causes can be classified as benign or malignant, or as extra- or intraluminal. Gastrojejunostomy is a well-recognised surgical procedure performed to bypass gastric outlet obstruction. A bezoar occurs most commonly in patients with impaired gastrointestinal motility or {{with a history of}} gastric surgery. It is an intestinal concretion, which fails to pass along the alimentary canal. Case presentation A 62 -year-old Asian woman with a history of gastrojejunostomy for peptic ulcer disease was admitted to hospital with epigastric pain, vomiting and dehydration. All investigations concluded gastric outlet obstruction secondary to a "stricture" at the site of gastrojejunostomy. Subsequent laparotomy revealed that the cause of the obstruction was a bezoar. Conclusion Many bezoars can be removed endoscopically, but some will require operative intervention. Once <b>removed,</b> <b>emphasis</b> must be placed upon prevention of recurrence. Surgeons must learn to recognise and classify bezoars in order to provide the most effective therapy. </p...|$|R
40|$|Applying {{selective}} {{emphasis to}} photographs {{is a critical}} aspect of the visual design process. There is evidence from psychophysics that contrast in texture is a key contributor to saliency in an image, yet unlike other low-level perceptual features, texture cannot be directly modified with existing image-processing software. We present a post-processing technique to subtly change the salience of regions of an image by modifying spatial variation in texture. Our method is inspired by computational models of visual attention that capture sensitivity to outliers in local feature distributions. We use the steerable pyramid, which encodes multi-scale oriented image features and compute a set of power maps which capture the local texture content at each scale and orientation. With this representation, texture variation can be modified to selectively add or <b>remove</b> <b>emphasis</b> in the image. Two user studies provide qualitative and quantitative psychophysical validation of our approach. by Sara Lee Su. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|White (1988) {{recently}} {{claimed that}} direct extrapolation of light-trapping samples to non-sampled nights may violate sampling assumptions and {{give rise to}} mis-leading results. A careful reading of the paper will find no suggestion that factors such as cloud cover, wind, rain, moonlight, trap design and insect dispersal are ignored by the case presented. These are secondary factors {{to the question of}} sampling frequency for they apply regardless of sampling frequency. Yet, McGregor (1988) and Allan (1988) replied by emphasising such factors and by treating the assumptions of the illustrated example as literal biology and methodology. Rather, the simplifications of the example (100 % trap efficiency, 10 -day phenology, and 2 -night moth longevities) were stated in the form of propositions for a simplest possible case, facilitating a clear analysis. Thomas (this issue) adds to the analysis by stressing that errors of extrapolation depend on the proportions of the population removed, but cites a formula based on absolute population numbers (P). As abundance estimates from light-trapping are not absolute but relative (his <b>emphasis),</b> the proportions <b>removed</b> should not be expressed in terms of P, but in terms of only its catchable members, i. e, the "trappable population " of White.

40|$|Esta pesquisa tem como tema o processo organizativo e de construção das demandas do movimento de moradores de favelas e como este movimento social foi conformando, ao longo do tempo, seu repertório de luta para afirmação da moradia digna, mediados por seu apoiador {{principal}} naquele momento, a Igreja Católica, sua relação com o governo e seu processo de aprendizagem na tentativa do atendimento de suas reivindicações. Nosso principal objetivo é descrever como se davam as interações entre moradores de favelas e poder público, na cidade de São Paulo, entre 1975 e 1982, em um momento no qual as políticas públicas para as favelas aos poucos iam se deslocando da ênfase na remoção, ainda hegemônicas, para a ideia da assistência coletiva às famílias. Para a nossa análise retomaremos, de forma mais rápida e como contraponto, a luta dos moradores dos loteamentos clandestinos, como forma de avaliarmos os diferentes padrões de resposta estatal associados à luta pela terra urbana. A pesquisa foi desenvolvida utilizando bibliografia secundária e análise de documentos do período, alguns deles produzidos pelo próprio movimento e também pela pesquisa de jornais da época. This {{research has}} as its theme the organizational process and construction of {{the demands of the}} movement of the favelas's residents and how this social movement has been conforming, over time, his repertoire of struggle for affirmation of the decent housing, mediated by its main supporter at that time, the Catholic Church, its relationship with the Government and their learning process in the attempt to support their claims.

40|$|The {{conceptual}} basis {{of poverty in}} Pakistan remained limited to absolute notion of poverty which has been criticised {{on the grounds that}} it minimises the range and depth of human needs. The paper broadens the discussion on poverty and poverty measurement by examining the prevalence of relative poverty in Pakistan. Based on the moderate relative consumption poverty line of Rs 775 per capita per month, the prevalence of relative poverty was at 40. 7 percent in 2001 - 02. On the other hand, half of the population was below the income-based moderate relative poverty line, implying that 77. 5 million individuals were poor in Pakistan. At the province level, the results suggest the highest prevalence of urban poverty in the NWFP, followed by Sindh, Balochistan, and Punjab. On the other hand, rural Sindh was the poorest region in the country, followed by the NWFP and Balochistan. The trends implied by the concept of relative poverty suggest a more rapidly increasing trend in relative poverty because of rising income inequality. As a result, gains in income accrued to the richest at the expense of the poorest and the middle income groups, implying that the rich got richer and the poor got poorer over the last 15 year. These results suggest that adverse distributional outcome may be due to the pursuance of stabilisation and adjustment programmes within the framework of the “Washington Consensus” which put too much <b>emphasis</b> on <b>removing</b> macroeconomic imbalances and enhancing economic growth while giving no consideration to equity and poverty. While economic growth alone is not enough for poverty reduction, there is a need to raise PRSP spending in order to pursue an effective poverty reduction strategy with a focus on redistributive policies. While the country has already made a commitment to attain the Millennium Development Goals, economic policies need to be expansionary. Poverty reduction strategy should be based on the policies of building up the assets of the poor and increasing the demand for those assets. An expansion of health and education for the low-income households and measures that increase the relative prices of agricultural commodities and the wages of unskilled labour should be part of new poverty reduction strategy. Focusing on agrarian strategies, especially those also favouring rural industrialisation, can lead to more egalitarian growth. Rapid expansion of labour-intensive exports may contribute to faster growth in employment. Policies to support this should favour labour-intensive techniques, e. g., by not subsidising capital and by securing more credit for small enterprises. ...|$|R
40|$|Shotton Colliery Community Economic Development Initiative (CEDI) {{began in}} 2007. It {{is one of}} three CEDI areas funded through the Single Programme. CEDI builds on a {{previous}} County Durham-wide programme, Settlement Renewal Initiatives (SRIs), which ended in 2006. Shotton Colliery CEDI receives funding from One North East, the Neighbourhood Renewal Fund and the Shotton Investment Pot. The aim of CEDI is to improve the local economy in Shotton Colliery by designing projects to support local people and businesses. The <b>emphasis</b> is on <b>removing</b> barriers to employment, supporting skills and training, and stimulating business growth. CEDI’s outcomes are: 1. New economic activity contributing to diversification in the local economy; 2. Enhance the contribution made by the settlement to the local economy; 3. Reduced unemployment and worklessness; 4. Increased skill levels and educational attainment; 5. Improved access to employment through addressing multiple barriers such as poor health, childcare responsibilities and transport; 6. Increased economic opportunities through enhancing the built and natural environment. CEDI outcomes are organised into four themes: community enterprise; reducing worklessness; education, training and skills, and business support and stimulating entrepreneurship. Projects to achieve the outcomes include the development of community enterprises such as a community café, increasing the range of leisure, welfare and learning opportunities offered by the community centre, improved broadband access for the area, and initiatives to support unemployed people and encourage business growth. Shotton Partnership 2000 Ltd oversees the CEDI along with partner agencies including Shotton Parish Council and Easington District Council. It commissioned this independent evaluation in November 2007. The evaluation had the following objectives: to consider the effectiveness of the delivery of Shotton CEDI against the outputs and outcomes included in the project’s approval; to examine the particular circumstances that exist in Shotton and which may have impacted on the delivery of CEDI; and to recommend potential activities and outcomes that would be of benefit to the community of Shotton and match the aspirations of those supporting the initiative in its continuation...|$|R
