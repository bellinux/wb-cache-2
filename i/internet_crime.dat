Data was obtained utilizing semistructured, conversational interviews with eight ICAC investigators. Three main themes emerged from these interviews: general demographic descriptions, motivations and behaviors. Perpetrators of <b>Internet</b> <b>crimes</b> against children were found to be predominantly non-Hispanic males. Other significant findings included the lack of selfv control, the downward spiral associated with obtaining and viewing child pornography, and the addictive behaviors observed in the perpetrators. It was recognized that treatment has been found to not always be successful and incarceration of these individuals may be necessary to protect the children. That notwithstanding, a cognitive-behavioral model of therapy integrated with Christian counseling was provided. The goal of treatment would be developing positive regard for self and others, stopping the cycle of pornography, and establishing and maintaining a relationship with God.
