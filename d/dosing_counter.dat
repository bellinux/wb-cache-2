This study compared respiratory-related emergency department (ED) visit rates in patients with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or both when they used albuterol MDIs with versus without <b>dose</b> <b>counters.</b> Methods: This retrospective study used US claims data to identify patients (ages 4 – 64 years) with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or both, using albuterol MDIs with or without an integrated <b>dose</b> <b>counter.</b> The study comprised a 1 -year baseline period for patient characterization and confounder definition and a 1 -year outcome period following the first albuterol prescription. The primary end point was the incidence rate of respiratory-related ED visits, compared using a reduced zero-inflated Poisson regression model. We also compared severe exacerbation rates and rescue medication use. Results: A total of 93, 980 patients were studied, including 67, 251 (72 %) in the <b>dose</b> <b>counter</b> cohort and 26, 729 (28 %) in the non-dose-counter cohort. The cohorts were broadly similar at baseline (55, 069 [59 %] female patients; median age, 37 years). The incidence rate of respiratory-related ED visits during the outcome year was 45 % lower in the <b>dose</b> <b>counter</b> cohort than in the non-dose-counter cohort (adjusted rate ratio: 0. 55; 95 % confidence interval: 0. 47 – 0. 64). Exacerbation rates and short-acting β-agonist use were similar between cohorts. Conclusion: These findings suggest that <b>dose</b> <b>counter</b> integration into albuterol MDIs is associated with decreased ED visit rates. The presence of integrated <b>dose</b> <b>counters</b> on rescue inhalers can help patients avoid using an empty or near-empty inhaler during exacerbations, thereby ensuring available medication for relief of their symptoms. Integrated <b>dose</b> <b>counters</b> on rescue MDIs could represent a simple and effective tool to improve clinical outcomes during exacerbations, with a potential for cost savings to health care systems.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundConsistent {{delivery}} of medication to treat asthma and {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) {{is critical for}} disease control. Dose tracking may eliminate the possibility of sub-therapeutic dosing. This study evaluated the overall performance, including accuracy and ruggedness, of the mometasone furoate/formoterol (MF/F) metered-dose inhaler (MDI) with an integrated numerical dose-counting mechanism in adolescent and adult subjects (aged ≥ 12  y) with persistent asthma or COPD. MethodsIn a phase III, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study, subjects demonstrating at least 90 % compliance with MF/F during the screening period received twice daily MF/F MDI 100 / 10  μg with the integrated <b>dose</b> <b>counter</b> for 4 weeks. Accuracy and ruggedness of the <b>dose</b> <b>counter</b> were assessed by the overall discrepancy rate of subject-recorded actuations versus subject-recorded <b>dose</b> <b>counter</b> readings. Discrepancy rates for Counterstrip™, a manual counting method, were evaluated for reference. Compliance and ergonomic safety were also assessed. ResultsThe 233 subjects who used ≥ 90 % of labeled actuations were included in the primary analysis. Of 26, 317 total actuations, 33 <b>dose</b> <b>counter</b> discrepancies occurred (rate =  0. 13 / 100 actuations), of which 13 were due to undercounting. In comparison, the Counterstrip discrepancy rate was 10 -fold higher (1. 34 / 100 actuations). Compliance with medication use, Counterstrip use, and e-diary recordings were all high (> 98 %). No new repetitive strain injuries or exacerbations of preexisting ergonomic injuries of the finger, hand, or arm were reported. ConclusionsThe MF/F MDI <b>dose</b> <b>counter</b> was accurate and rugged in subjects with asthma or COPD. No new repetitive strain injuries or exacerbations of existing ergonomic injuries were associated with inhaler use.

There are few published data on the real-world impact of rescue inhalers with integrated <b>dose</b> <b>counters</b> (IDCs) on health care resource utilization (HRU) for asthma patients. This study evaluates HRU among users of ProAir® hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) (albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol), with IDC versus without IDC, in asthma patients. Methods: This was a retrospective administrative claims study of asthma patients receiving a new prescription for albuterol inhalation aerosol without IDC during 2 years (January 2011 –December 2012) or with IDC during the first full year after IDC implementation in the USA (July 2013 –July 2014). Six months of continuous enrollment with medical and prescription drug benefits were required {{before and after the}} first prescription during the study period. Data on respiratory-related hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits were collected during the follow-up period. Results: A total of 135, 305 (32 %) patients used albuterol inhalation aerosol with IDC, and 287, 243 (68 %) patients received albuterol inhalation aerosol without IDC. After adjusting for baseline confounding factors, the odds ratio (OR) for experiencing a respiratory-related hospitalization (OR= 0. 92; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 88 – 0. 96) or ED visit (OR= 0. 92; 95 % CI 0. 90 – 0. 94) was significantly lower among patients using albuterol inhalation aerosol with IDC versus without IDC. Conclusion: In a real-world setting, asthma patients using ProAir HFA with IDC experienced significantly fewer hospitalizations and ED visits compared with patients using ProAir HFA without IDC. Dosage information provided by IDCs may allow providers to better understand patients’ disease severity and aid in titrating controller medications and also decrease the likelihood that the canister will be empty when needed, thereby enhancing disease management and reducing HRU.

40|$|Abstract Background Poor {{adherence}} with prescribed asthma {{medication is}} a major barrier to positive treatment outcomes. This {{study was designed to}} determine the effect of a once-daily administration of mometasone furoate administered via a dry powder inhaler (MF-DPI) on treatment adherence compared with a twice-daily administration. Methods This was a 12 -week open-label study designed to mimic an actual clinical setting in patients ≥ 12 years old with mild-to-moderate persistent asthma. Patients were randomized to receive MF-DPI 400 μg once-daily in the evening or MF-DPI 200 μg twice-daily. Adherence was assessed primarily using the number of actual administered doses reported from the device counter divided by the number of scheduled doses. Self-reports were also used to determine adherence. Health-related quality of life, healthcare resource utilization, and days missed from work or school were also reported. Results 1233 patients were randomized. The mean adherence rates, as measured by the automatic <b>dose</b> <b>counter,</b> were significantly better (P P Conclusion Mean adherence rates were greater with a once-daily dosing regimen of MF-DPI than with a twice-daily dosing regimen.

40|$|AbstractFor most {{dry powder}} inhalers (DPIs) a defined minimal inspiratory flow must be {{achieved}} {{immediately after the}} start of the inspiration procedure, to avoid insufficient deposition in the lung and excessive drug deposition in the patient's mouth and/or oropharynx. The Novolizer® (VIATRIS GmbH & Co. KG, Frankfurt, Germany) provides a combination of technical features that ensure that every inhalation manoeuvre is performed with adequate inspiratory and sufficient drug particles are delivered to the patient's lung. One of these technical features is an inspiratory flow rate threshold triggering feedback mechanisms to the patient which confirm that an adequate inspiratory flow rate (minimum 35 – 50 l/min) has been achieved. Correct inhalation manoeuvre is confirmed to the patient by optical, acoustic and taste feedback which is likely to improve patient compliance. The Novolizer® also delivers a high-quality aerosol (high fine particle fraction representing the proportion of respirable particles), provides a refillable cartridge system, an accurate <b>dose</b> <b>counter,</b> a low intrinsic resistance, and enables reliable and consistent dose delivery. The Novolizer® is {{at the cutting edge of}} inhalation technology and represents a major step forward in DPI design...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{influence}} of type of inhalation device on medication adherence of COPD patients. Methods: Adherence to inhalation medication of 795 patients was recorded from pharmacy records over 3 years. It was expressed as percentage and deemed good at ≥ 75 –≤ 125 %, sub-optimal ≥ 50 – 125 % (overuse). Since most patients used more than one device, 1379 medication periods were analyzed. Results: Patients using a Metered Dose Inhaler (MDI) or Diskus had a 2. 3 -fold and 2. 2 -fold increased risk, respectively, of suboptimal adherence versus good adherence, compared to Handihaler and a 2. 1 -fold and 2. 2 -fold increased risk, respectively, of underuse versus good adherence compared to Handihaler. Turbuhaler, MDI, Respimat had a 7. 9 -fold, 3. 5 -fold, and 2. 0 -fold increased risk, of overuse versus good adherence compared to Handihaler. Conclusions: In COPD, adherence to inhalation medication is device-related. Overuse was most pronounced for devices without a <b>dose</b> <b>counter,</b> devices {{with the ability to}} load a dosage without actual inhalation, or devices lacking feedback of correct inhalation. The design of the device seems to be related to underuse and overuse of inhaled medication.

40|$|SummaryInability to use inhaler devices {{correctly}} is a {{major source}} of non-compliance in patients with asthma. The problem of coordinating dose release with inspiration seen with pressurised metered dose inhalers (pMDIs) is overcome by dry powder inhalers (DPIs), since they use inspiratory flow energy to carry the drug dose to the respiratory tract. The first DPIs were not popular because they were single dose devices and inconvenient to use. The introduction of multiple dose DPIs improved the image of the dry powder systems in the eyes of both the clinician and the patient. The continued development of DPIs has led to inhaler devices which include <b>dose</b> <b>counters,</b> are easy to use, are refillable and provide feedback to the patient on a correct inhalation. Criteria that may improve patient compliance with an inhaler include: correct use of the device by most patients; ease and convenience of device use; dose release even at low inspiratory flow rates; feedback of drug release which could instill confidence that the dose has been inhaled; cartridge refills and overall confidence in the device. The Novolizer® has all the desirable features listed above and is expected to improve compliance if prescribed for the large number of patients who cannot use the conventional pMDI or less efficient DPIs...|$|R

40|$|Pressurized metered-dose inhalers (pMDIs) are {{sometimes}} viewed as old-fashioned and {{as having been}} superseded by dry powder inhalers (DPIs). Here, we review the technological advances that characterize modern pMDIs, and consider how they can influence the effectiveness of drug delivery for patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Compared with old chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) -based inhalers, many hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) -driven pMDIs have more favorable plume characteristics such as a reduced velocity and a higher fine particle fraction; together, these advances {{have resulted in the}} development of pMDIs with reduced oropharyngeal deposition and increased lung deposition. In addition, the plume from many HFA-pMDIs is warmer, which may facilitate their use by patients; moreover, devices are equipped with <b>dose</b> <b>counters,</b> which improves their reliability. As well as reviewing the technological advances of pMDIs, we also discuss the importance of individualizing inhaler therapies to each patient by accounting for their personal preferences and natural breathing patterns. Because pMDIs and DPIs differ considerably in their handling characteristics, matching the right inhaler to the right patient is key to ensuring effective therapy and good compliance. Finally, the majority of patients can be trained successfully in the correct use of their pMDI; training and regular monitoring of inhalation technique are essential prerequisites for effective therapy. While the 'ideal inhaler' may not exist, pMDIs are an effective device option suitable for many patients. pMDIs, together with other types of devices, offer opportunities for the effective individualization of treatments...|$|R

Sixty-one adult asthmatic subjects with FEV 1 50 – 80 % predicted and ≥ 15 % increase in FEV 1 to salbutamol took part. Equivalence was declared if the 95 % CI for {{the ratio of the}} FEV 1 responses to the two treatments was within the range 90 – 111 %. Following the cumulative four doses, FEV 1 (l) changes pre-dose to the highest dose were: 2. 53 – 3. 31, 2. 47 – 3. 30, 2. 51 – 3. 35, 2. 52 – 3. 31 and 2. 57 – 2. 55 for AirmaxTM salbutamol, salbutamol Ventolin®, salbutamol Diskhaler®, salbutamol Accuhaler® and placebo, respectively. The 95 % CIs for the ratio of AirmaxTM salbutamol to each of the active devices were within ± 5 % demonstrating a 1 : 1 dose equivalence between AirmaxTM salbutamol and Ventolin® and a 1 : 2 dose equivalence between each of the other two salbutamol dry powder devices.

40|$|Inhaled {{medications}} are {{the mainstay}} of therapy {{in the treatment of}} chronic respiratory diseases like asthma and COPD because they allow delivery of the active ingredient directly to the site of action. Poor adherence to inhaled controller medications has been estimated to account for up to 60 % of asthma-related hospitalizations and increased rates of 30 - and 60 - day hospital readmissions in patients with COPD. Numerous electronic monitoring devices have been developed over the last four decades to monitor temporal non-adherence; however, many of these devices do not monitor all or most aspects of inhaler technique. Currently used methods for monitoring inhaler technique, including subjective checklists, are suboptimal. There is a need to study the frequency of temporal and technique non-adherence in the Irish population and to investigate the impact of dosing and technique errors on drug delivery. Moreover, a comprehensive system of tracking the date and time of inhaler use, as well as {{the presence or absence of}} technique errors, on a daily basis is essential to not only an epidemiological understanding of inhaler use but to tailoring of inhaler training and clinical care plans to individual patients. This thesis describes the use of the INCATM device, a novel acoustic monitor, which provides longitudinal data on the date and time of inhaler use, as well as data on inhaler technique. Studies showed that inhalation flow rate, exhalation into the inhaler mouthpiece prior to inhalation, breath-hold duration and missed doses had a significant effect on delivered dose. Data on both temporal and technique adherence were combined in an algorithm, which provided a single measure of overall adherence, called “actual adherence”. The <b>dose</b> <b>counter</b> rate correlated poorly with INCATM derived adherence rates, highlighting the need to incorporate technologies, like the INCATM device, into clinical trials and patient care...|$|R

Incorrect usage leads to suboptimal disease control. Complex treatment regimens and use of multiple inhalers may reduce patient compliance. The Anoro Ellipta™ dry powder inhaler (DPI) simultaneously delivers umeclidinium bromide (UMEC) and vilanterol (VI) without coformulation being required. Aim: To assess the correct usage {{and ease of use}} of the Ellipta™ DPI administering UMEC/VI and to compare patient preference for Ellipta™ with the HandiHaler® through exploratory analyses of patient and observer questionnaires in five Phase III studies. Methods: Two Phase III, 3 -month double-blind, placebo-controlled studies assessed the correct usage of the Ellipta™ DPI at Day 1 and after 6 weeks, and ease of use of the Ellipta™ DPI using a nonvalidated patient questionnaire after 6 weeks or early withdrawal. In three 6 -month, blinded double-dummy, active comparator studies (two Phase IIIa and one Phase IIIb), patients completed a COPD device preference questionnaire between the Ellipta™ DPI and the HandiHaler® at Day 168 (Week 24) or early withdrawal. Results: In the 3 -month placebo-controlled studies, ≥ 98 % of patients used the Ellipta™ DPI correctly and 99 % of patients found the inhaler easy/very easy-to-use and the <b>dose</b> <b>counter</b> easy/very easy to read. Across the two Phase IIIa active comparator studies, patients consistently stated a preference for the Ellipta™ DPI over HandiHaler® regarding the number of steps to use (59 % vs 17 %), time taken to use (62 % vs 14 %), and ease of use (63 % vs 15 %) regardless of which inhaler contained active drug.

DESIGN: Systolic blood pressure (SBP), body weight and morphology of the femoral artery were evaluated, and the ultrastructure of the endothelium was analysed by transmission and scanning electron microscopy. METHODS: SHR were divided into three groups, a control group which was left untreated and two isradipine treatment groups, one at 0. 01 mg/kg per day and the other at 0. 1 mg/kg per day. Two age-matched groups of Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats were included in the study; one group was left untreated and was used as a normotensive reference group and the other was treated with isradipine at 0. 1 mg/kg per day. The study lasted 12 weeks. RESULTS: SBP did not change in the WKY rats, whether treated with isradipine or not, but was significantly increased in SHR as a function of age. The lower dose of isradipine did not alter SBP in the SHR, but the higher dose brought SBP values into the normal range after the first week of treatment. Light microscopy of sections of the femoral artery did not reveal any structural differences in the five rat groups examined. Both transmission and scanning electron microscopy showed endothelial alterations in the SHR, together with thickening of the internal elastic lamina. Treatment with isradipine significantly improved the morphology of the endothelium in SHR.

40|$|Dengue {{vaccines}} {{will soon}} provide a new tool for reducing dengue disease, but {{the effectiveness of}} widespread vaccination campaigns {{has not yet been}} determined. We developed an agent-based dengue model representing movement of and transmission dynamics among people and mosquitoes in Yucatán, Mexico, and simulated various vaccine scenarios to evaluate effectiveness under those conditions. This model includes detailed spatial representation of the Yucatán population, including the location and movement of 1. 8 million people between 375, 000 households and 100, 000 workplaces and schools. Where possible, we designed the model to use data sources with international coverage, to simplify re-parameterization for other regions. The simulation and analysis integrate 35 years of mild and severe case data (including dengue serotype when available), results of a seroprevalence survey, satellite imagery, and climatological, census, and economic data. To fit model parameters that are not directly informed by available data, such as disease reporting rates and dengue transmission parameters, we developed a parameter estimation toolkit called AbcSmc, which we have made publicly available. After fitting the simulation model to dengue case data, we forecasted transmission and assessed the relative effectiveness of several vaccination strategies over a 20 year period. Vaccine efficacy is based on phase III trial results for the Sanofi-Pasteur vaccine, Dengvaxia. We consider routine vaccination of 2, 9, or 16 year-olds, with and without a one-time catch-up campaign to age 30.

40|$|The {{antagonistic}} potentials of {{aqueous extract}} of Talinum triangulare (Tt) against Acetaminopheninduced {{damage in the}} hepatic cells were concisely studied in randomly grouped female Wistar albino rats. The dosage of the extract received by the various groups {{was based on the}} average weight of each group. Negative control group received normal animal feed and water ad libitum, the Control group (Positive) received 200 mg/ml Acetaminophen without Tt while group 1 received 200 mg/ml Acetaminophen with 100 mg/kg Tt. On the other hand, based on average weight, group 2 received 200 mg/kg Tt with 200 mg/ml Acetaminophen and group 3 received 200 mg/ml Acetaminophen alongside with the <b>counter</b> <b>dose</b> of 300 mg/kg of the extract. The levels of liver marker enzymes, malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduced glutathione (GSH) in the tissue of the animals (both the treated and untreated) were estimated after the experiment. The result showed a significant (p < 0. 05) increase in the level of ALT, ALP and AST in both the liver and serum. Also, a significant (p < 0. 05) decrease was observed in the GSH level in the serum of the tested groups when compared to the control group (positive). Severe liver impairment was observed in the Control group (Negative) based on histophotographic analysis and ameliorating effects were observed in the Tt treated groups significantly...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of hypertension and of treatment with some dihydropyridine-type Ca(2 +) channel blockers {{and with the}} nondihydropyridine-type vasodilator hydralazine on the morphology of kidney was investigated in 26 -week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and in age-matched Wistar-Kyoto rats. Fourteen-week-old SHR were treated for 12 weeks with a nonhypotensive dose of lercanidipine or with equihypotensive doses of lercanidipine, manidipine, nicardipine, and hydralazine. In control SHR, systolic pressure values were significantly higher in comparison with Wistar-Kyoto rats. Treatment with the low dose of lercanidipine did not reduce systolic blood pressure in SHR, whereas the higher dose of lercanidipine or other compounds tested significantly decreased systolic pressure values. Glomerular hypertrophy accompanied by signs of glomerulosclerosis, increase of mesangial cells, and convoluted tubules degeneration were observed in control SHR. Hypotensive doses of Ca(2 +) antagonists countered glomerular injury, the increase of mesangial cells, the reduction of capsular space, and tubular degeneration. Hydralazine, {{in spite of its}} hypotensive activity, displayed a slight nephroprotective action. The nonhypotensive <b>dose</b> of lercanidipine <b>countered</b> in part glomerular injury, narrowing of capsular space, and tubular degeneration, and decreased mesangial cell augmentation in SHR. These results suggest that treatment with dihydropyridine-type Ca(+ 2) antagonists counters hypertensive glomerular and tubular changes occurring in SHR. The demonstration of nephroprotection by the nonhypotensive dose of lercanidipine suggests that the renal effects of the compound may be in part unrelated to its hemodynamic activity...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground and purposeAlthough FDG-avid {{tumors are}} {{recognized}} as a potential target for dose escalation, {{there is no clear}} basis for selecting a boost <b>dose</b> to <b>counter</b> this apparent radioresistance. Using a novel analysis method, based on the new concept of an outcome-equivalent dose, we estimate the extra dose required to equalize local control between FDG-avid and non-avid head and neck tumors. Materials and methodsBased on a literature review, five reports of head and neck cancer (423 patients in total), along with an internal validation dataset from our institution (135 oropharynx patients), were used in this analysis. To compensate for the heterogeneity among multi-institutional patient cohorts and corresponding treatment techniques, local control data of the cohorts were fit to a single dose–response curve with a clinically representative steepness (γ 50 = 2), thereby defining an ‘outcome-equivalent dose’ (OED) for each institutional cohort. Separate dose–response curves were then determined for the FDG-avid and FDG-non-avid patient cohorts, and the ratio of TD 50 (tumor dose required for 50 % of control) values between the high- and low-FDG-uptake groups (TD 50,high/TD 50,low) was estimated, resulting in an estimated metabolic dose-modifying factor (mDMF) due to FDG-avidity. ResultsFor individual datasets, the estimated mDMFs were found to be in the range of 1. 07 – 1. 62, decreasing if the assumed slope (γ 50) increased. Weighted logistic regression for the six datasets resulted in a mDMF of 1. 19 [95 % CI: 1. 04 – 1. 34] for a γ 50 value of 2, which translates to a needed dose increase of about 1. 5 Gy per unit increase in the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVm) of FDG-PET [95 % CI: 0. 3 – 2. 7]. Assumptions of lower or higher γ 50 values (1. 5 or 2. 5) resulted in slightly different mDMFs: 1. 26 or 1. 15, respectively. A validation analysis with seven additional datasets, based on relaxed criteria, was consistent with the estimated mDMF. ConclusionsWe introduced a novel outcome-equivalent dose analysis method to estimate the dose–response modifying effect of FDG uptake variation. To reach equal response rates, FDG-avid tumors are likely to require 10 % to 30 % more dose than FDG-non-avid tumors. These estimates provide a rational starting point for selecting IMRT boosts for FDG-avid tumors. However, independent tests and refinements of the estimated dose-modifying effect, using high-quality prospective clinical trial data, are needed...|$|R
40|$|Infections {{with the}} {{opportunistic}} yeast Candida glabrata have increased dramatically in recent years. Antifungal therapy of yeast infections commonly employs azoles, such as fluconazole (FLC), but C. glabrata frequently develops resistance to these inhibitors of ergosterol biosynthesis. The pyrimidine analog flucytosine (5 -fluorocytosine [5 FC]) is highly active versus C. glabrata {{but is now}} rarely used clinically due to similar concerns over resistance and, a related concern, the toxicity associated with high <b>doses</b> used to <b>counter</b> resistance. Azole- 5 FC combination therapy would potentially address these concerns; however, previous studies suggest that 5 FCmay antagonize azole activity versus C. glabrata. Here, we report that 5 FC at subinhibitory concentrations antagonized the activity of FLC 4 - to 16 -fold versus 8 of 8 C. glabrata isolates tested. 5 FC antagonized the activity of other azoles similarly but had only indifferent effects in combination with unrelated antifungals. Since azole resistance in C. glabrata results from transcription factor Pdr 1 -dependent upregulation of the multidrug transporter gene CDR 1, we reasoned that 5 FC antagonismmight be similarly mediated. Indeed, 5 FC-FLC antagonism was abrogated in pdr 1 and cdr 1 strains. In further support of this hypothesis, 5 FC exposure induced CDR 1 expression 6 -fold, and this upregulation was Pdr 1 dependent. In contrast to azoles, 5 FC is not a Cdr 1 substrate and so its activation of Pdr 1 was unexpected. We observed, however, that 5 FC ex-posure readily induced petite mutants, which exhibit Pdr 1 -dependent CDR 1 upregulation. Thus, mitochondrial dysfunction resulting in Pdr 1 activation is the likely basis for 5 FC antagonism of azole activity versus C. glabrata. Candida albicans and related yeasts are typically present in lownumbers among the normal mucosal flora, but antibiotic ex...|$|R
40|$|Introduction The {{embrace of}} PET by medical clinicians has been {{reluctant}} (ΔT ≈ 20 yr) primarily due to {{the scale of the}} infrastructure that is needed. The capital cost of a cyclotron (≈ 106 USD) is now dwarfed by the demand for compliance to recent regulatory standards. This is a recurring expense, not only imposing an order-of-magnitude increase in staffing and operating costs, but damping the enthusiasm of researchers recalling the brisk pace of research in earlier days. Now an academic site, with little interest or opportunity to scale up production for wider distribution, is burdened by the new regulatory terrain of good manufacturing practice (GMP), mandated for translational studies that will reach only a few subjects. With our production resources held within a basic science department, the Medical Physics cyclotron facility at the University of Wisconsin has sought a sustainable pathway. We now anchor the operating budget by providing high-value, long-lived radionuclides to off-site users, to buffer the fluctuations of local demand for conventional PET synthons. Material and Methods: The tools of the trade The radioisotopes discussed here belong to the 3 -d and 4 -d sub shell, but are now moving into the rare-earths, with applications ranging from -	targeted molecular imaging agents, -	internal radionuclide therapy using to Auger electron-emitters, -	to basic physics experiments using 163 Ho (t 1 / 2 ≈ 4500 yr) to determine the mass of the neutrino. Rather than focusing on the dozens of radionuclides produced, a number of tools deserve mention, as they support a variety of targets, reactions and products. These will be listed in order (A-G) from cyclotron to extraction to analysis. A. 	Two cyclotrons are used, a legacy RDS 112 (# 1; 1985) and a GE PETtrace (2009). Neutron and gamma detectors are monitored during the long irradia-tions, signaling any subtle changes in the running conditions. (1). The PET-trace is fitted with a quick-change variable degrader target (2), as well as a beam-line with a 5 -port (0 o, ± 15 o, ± 30 o) vertical switching magnet (3). The downward directed beam ports provide support for solid targets (e. g. Ga, S, Se, Te) that melt at low temperature. The irradiation of gas targets employs a generalized manifold to handle inert gases such as 36 Ar for the production of 34 mCl, as well as natural Kr and Xe for making Rb and Cs isotopes to act as fission product surrogates. These products are captured on a stainless steel target chamber liner, and rinsed off with warm water. The alkali metals are convenient tracers to study the ion exchange trapping process, pivotal in future 99 Mo production from solution reactors (4). B. 	The preparation of malleable solid targets employs a 10 -ton hydraulic bench press, and a jeweler’s mill to roll out foils from pellets, pressed between Nb foils to avoid contamination. C. 	Binary alloys are smelted in a programmable 1600 o tube furnace under argon flow (eg. NiGa 4). Alternatively, an induction furnace now permits highly localized heating of the binary metal charge, while allowing mechanical agitation during the smelting process. D. 	Electroplating onto gold discs is used for various enriched target material or the alloys above where quantitative recovery is essential, or where heat transfer from high beam current is demanding. E. 	The separation chemistry, prior to che-lation to targeted molecular imaging agents, is performed in LabView-driven, home-built “black boxes” resident in mini-cells (Radiation Shielding Inc.). F. 	Analysis of the targets after irradiation makes use of HPGe spectroscopy for gammas and characteristic X-rays of decay (e. g. rare earths). The elemental constitution of target alloys is deter-mined prior to irradiation by X-ray fluorescence analysis, excited by 109 Cd and 241 Am sources. G. 	Finally, broad-band elemental analysis at the ppb level now makes use of a microwave plasma atomic emission spectrometer (Agilent 4200), to be de-scribed elsewhere in this meeting. Results and Conclusions The tools above (A-G) are employed in the pro-duction of the expanded list of radionuclides offered by our cyclotron group to both local and off-site colleagues. The list below is ordered in terms of decreasing use, from regular production for national distribution (64 Cu, 89 Zr), to weekly inhouse use (44 Sc, 66, 68 Ga, 68, 69, 71 Ge, 72 As, 61 Cu, 86 Y), to infrequent production for multi-site collaborations (163 Ho, 95 mTc, 206 Bi) : Radionuclide Target	 Employs 64 Cu	 64 Ni/Au	 A, D, G 89 Zr	 natY	 A, E, G 44 Sc	 natCa	 A, B, E, F, G 66, 68 Ga	 Zn/Ag	 A, B, D, E, F, G 68, 69, 71 Ge Ga, GaO 2 A, B, C, E,F 72 As	 GeO 2 	 A, B, E, F 52 Mn	 natCr	 A, E, F, G 76, 81 mBr	 SeO	 A, E, F 34 mCl, Rb, Cs noble gas A, E, F 95 mTc, 163 Ho Mo, Dy A, E, F TABLE 1. Target materials and processes. The production of long-lived radionuclides lends itself to crowd-sourcing, with distributed irradia-tion at virtually any site with a suitable accelera-tor and a relaxed beam schedule. A number of unique challenges do arise that don’t appear in the usual production of conventional cyclotron products such as 11 C or 18 F. Contamination by stable metals, inadvertently introduced by target pressing or beam-induced sputtering from degraders, can cause serious interference downstream limiting effective specific activity. Long-lived manganese isotopes are ubiquitous. And some very high value products are simply not within the reach of small cyclotrons, such as 52 Fe and 67 Cu, being too far off the line of beta stability. In conclusion, the research leading to a doctoral degree necessarily must focus on the physics and chemistry of novel radionuclides and tracers. On the other hand, clinical and translational research needs established imaging agents, with little room for innovation within the regulatory constraints. Our experience at Wisconsin has led us to a balancing act, with our routine production of clinical <b>doses</b> <b>countered</b> with our research program to provide high-value radionu-clides for our collaborative work with our basic science colleagues...|$|R
40|$|Jake A. Deckert, Catherine A. Hambleton, Trent J. Herda, Eric M. Mosier, Philip M. Gallagher. University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas; e-mail: jaked 6 @ku. edu Ibuprofen, a non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug, {{is one of}} {{the most}} commonly used over the counter drugs. Ibuprofen has been shown increase skeletal muscle hypertrophy/strength while at the same time decreasing measures of delayed onset muscle soreness and inflammation. Ibuprofen has a number of effects on the properties of skeletal muscle, yet few studies have investigated changes musculotendinous stiffness (MTS) resulting from Ibuprofen ingestion. PURPOSE: Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of ibuprofen (IBU) intake on musculotendinous stiffness (MTS) in the plantar flexors. METHODS: 15 participants (age 18 - 30) completed the study (8 male; 7 female). Subjects visited the lab on two separate occasions. Each visit consisted of two maximum voluntary contractions (MVC) followed by three passive range of motion tests (ROM), on a Biodex System 3 Isokinetic Dynamometer. On the first visit, subjects were given either a placebo or maximum over the <b>counter</b> <b>dose</b> of ibuprofen (1200 mg/day) to be ingested in three doses (400 mg/dose). Ibuprofen was taken for three days. Multifactorial ANOVA’s were used for all analyses; significance was set at p 3 ̆c. 05. RESULTS: There were no significant treatment by time interactions for ROM, MTS, or Torque. No significant individual interactions for time or treatment existed for ROM, MTS, or Torque. There were no significant changes in MVC. CONCLUSION: Ingesting maximal values of Ibuprofen for a 3 -day period does not appear to impact MTS and related measures. Given chronic ingestion is commonly recommended by healthcare professionals for maladies from headache to muscle pain to menstrual cramps, it is recommended that future research investigate the impact of chronic ingestion at maximal and supra-maximal doses. With the propensity of tears in the Achilles tendon and other soft tissue in adults who chronically ingest ibuprofen, this research could provide pertinent information as to the mechanism of tendon matrix remodeling as well as a safe timeframe for consumption...|$|R
40|$|Microbiological {{screening}} of antimicrobial residues in eggs needs special attention {{because of the}} high level of naturally occurring inhibitors contained in eggs which often lead to false positive results. However, it was discovered that heating egg samples at 800 C for 10 minutes inactivated the inhibitors. The new bacteriological screening test for antimicrobial residues in eggs which was developed during this study, contains viable spores of Geobacillus stearothermophilus which are sensitive to antimicrobial residues including beta-lactams, tetracycline’s and macrolides. The new test method was validated based on the comparison with a reference method, namely the Kundrat micro-screening four-plate test, 1 and published literature of another standard reference method, the Premi®Test. A preliminary trial was conducted on 36 hens that were given therapeutic oral <b>doses</b> of overthe- <b>counter</b> antimicrobials daily for seven days with one of eleven antimicrobials based on the manufacturer’s recommendations. Eggs were collected from the hens during and after treatment and tested for {{the presence or absence of}} antimicrobial residues. Several performance criteria and minimum detection concentrations were estimated and discussed. Some agreements and differences were found between the new and the reference tests with the new test being more sensitive to beta-lactams, tetracyclines and macrolides than the Kundrat and Premi®Test on the average. The use of florfenicol and norfloxacin in laying hens is banned and therefore there are no maximum residue limits (MRL) or published Premi®Test values. For meat, the MRL is 100 mg/kg. It was therefore concluded that the new screening test could be used for routine {{screening of}} antimicrobial residues in eggs. A two seasonal survey was also conducted to determine the prevalence of antimicrobial residues in commercial chicken eggs in Tshwane area of Gauteng Province, South Africa. Although the season did not impact statistically on the antibiotic residues found in the eggs; eggs sold at the roadside (informal businesses), certain egg brands, and those sold at lower prices were found to be more likely to contain antibiotic residues than those obtained from formal outlets and at higher prices.
