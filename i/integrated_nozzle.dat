These studies indicate that the fixed-geometry scramjet module will provide practical levels of thrust performance with low cooling requirements.

40|$|A coupled zonal {{method has}} been {{developed}} for modeling flows about aircraft with highly <b>integrated</b> advanced <b>nozzle</b> installations in which the exhaust plume interacts with the aircraft flow field to enhance performance. A cost effective flow analysis is achieved by dividing the flow domain into zones and coupling the zonal solutions. PAN AIR is used to model the flow in the inviscid zone which surrounds the aircraft. The plume zone flow field is solved with a PNS code. The flow in the optional internal nozzle zone is modeled using a full Navier-Stokes code. An automated iterative procedure couples the inviscid and plume zones by passing updated boundary conditions between the zones. The coupled analysis provides converged solutions for the overall flow field.

40|$|Superior {{performance}} levels of advanced fighter aircraft require highly <b>integrated</b> <b>nozzles</b> with thrust vectoring capability. A platypus nozzle design {{with a large}} width to height ratio of its exhaust duct exit meets propulsion integration goals. The aerodynamic performance of three different geometry concepts of two-dimensional convergent/divergent nozzles with thrust vector control capability was investigated at flight Mach numbers 0. 6 and 0. 8 at sea level altitude. Under consideration of the external afterbody flowfield, Euler calculations were carried out for a nozzle with a slot exit, a nozzle with an S-shaped duct, and a nozzle configuration with injection of secondary air as coolant to reduce vectoring flap wall temperatures and for fluidic control of the gross thrust vector. As results of the CFD calculations of the nozzle/afterbody flow fields the thrust vector behavior is shown for a large range of nozzle pressure ratios, various pitch vectoring flap positions, and different mass flows of secondary air. Due to the asymmetry of the nozzle geometry, pitching moments are generated which change considerably when varying the nozzle pressure ratio from idle to maximum dry power operating conditions. The complex interaction between the external afterbody flow, the jet plume flow, and the secondary cooling air flow at subsonic Mach numbers leads to large changes of the longitudinal moment coefficients {{as a function of}} secondary air pressure ratios. Flowfield phenomena are demonstrated with isolines for Mach numbers and pressure coefficients together with pressure distributions along internal nozzle walls and external afterbody contours. (orig.)

40|$|Open water {{tests have}} been carried out at the SVA to {{determine}} the effect of the integration of the nozzle in the hull on the characteristics of ducted propeller systems. The integration of different nozzle sectors in the hull was realized by using of dummy models. The integration of the nozzle sectors took place in two variants: - Variante 1 : The entrance and exit area of the nozzle are preserved also in the integrated sector. - Variant 2 : The inner diameter of the nozzle is constant in the integrated sector between the entrance and exit area of the nozzle. Three different nozzle sectors with the angle of #psi#= 90, 135 and 180 have been tested. The characteristics of the ducted propellers K_T_P, K_Q as a function of J show a greater gradient with the increasing of the <b>integrated</b> <b>nozzle</b> sector in the hull. The thrust and torque coefficients grow at low advance coefficients, while the nozzle thrust coefficients decrease. A distinct decreasing of the thrust and torque coefficients is yielding at higher advance coefficients. The influence of the integration of the nozzle have been tested for two nozzle sectors with the angles of #psi#= 90 and 180. The decreasing of the entrance and exit area of the nozzle due to the integration in the hull yields to a distinct decreasing of the nozzle thrust and a distinct increasing of the propeller coefficients at higher thrust loading coefficients. The dependence between the thrust and torque coefficients of the propeller is nearly linear for integrated ducted propeller systems. The way of the integration of the nozzle in the hull and the angle of the <b>integrated</b> <b>nozzle</b> sector don't influence this dependence. The integration of the nozzle up to the inner diameter yields to a decrease of the nozzle thrust and the total thrust of the ducted propeller system for thrust loading coefficients C_T_H> 10. The cavitation observations at constant propeller thrust coefficients have shown a reduction of the cavitation area on the propeller blades with the increasing of the <b>integrated</b> <b>nozzle</b> sector in the hull. The reduction of the cavitation area at the propeller blades can be explained with higher velocities and change of the nozzle and the flow in the diffusor have to be considered for a prediction of the characteristics of integrated ducted propellers. The program DVPFIX was modified for a prediction of the influence of the integration of the nozzle in the hull on the coefficients of the propulsion system.

Experimental data were compared with the results obtained theoretically. Also, morphological analysis was accomplished by optical microscopy and the observation of fractured surfaces, by scanning electron microscopy.

40|$|A {{calibration}} of the Arc-Heated Scramjet Test Facility (AHSTF) Mach 4. 7 and Mach 6 nozzles {{was performed}} in 1998. For each nozzle, three different typical facility operating test points were selected for calibration. Each survey consisted of measurements, at 340 separate locations across the 11 inch square nozzle exit plane, of pitot pressure, static pressure, and total temperature. Measurement density was higher (4 /inch) in the boundary layer near the nozzle wall than in the core nozzle flow (1 /inch). The results generated {{for each of these}} calibration surveys were contour plots at the nozzle exit plane of the measured and calculated flow properties which completely defined the thermodynamic state of the nozzle exit flow. An area integration of the mass flux at the nozzle exit for each survey was compared to the AHSTF mass flow meter results to provide an indication of the overall quality of the calibration performed. The percent difference between the <b>integrated</b> <b>nozzle</b> exit mass flow and the flow meter ranged from 0. 0 to 1. 3 percent for the six surveys.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development and}} experimental evaluation of Juelichâ€™s novel reactor type ATR AH 2 for autothermal reforming of diesel fuel and kerosene. ATR AH 2 overcomes the disadvantages of Juelichâ€™s former reactor generations {{from the perspective of}} the fuel cell system by constructively integrating an additional pressure swirl nozzle for the injection of cold water and a steam generation chamber. As a consequence, ATR AH 2 eliminates the need for external process configurations for steam supply. Additionally, the internal steam generator has been modified by increasing its cross-sectional area and by decreasing its length. This measure reduces the pressure drop of the steam generator from approx. 500 mbar to roughly a thirtieth. The experimental evaluation of ATR AH 2 at steady state revealed that the novel concept for heat management applied in ATR AH 2 is suitable for fuel cell systems at any reformer load point between 20 % and 120 % when the mass fractions of cold water to the newly <b>integrated</b> <b>nozzle</b> are set to values between 40 % and 50 %. The experimental evaluation of ATR AH 2 during start-up and shut-down showed that slight modifications of the reaction conditions during these transient phases greatly reduced the concentrations of ethene, ethane, propene and benzene in the reformate. From the fuel cell system perspective, these improvements provide a very beneficial contribution to longer stabilities for the catalysts and adsorption materials...|$|E

The approaches by Gutsche and Amtsberg/Horn resulted in slightly lower P/D-ratios than the systematic experimental investigations by Oosterveld. It has been found, that for the practical applications with variable water depths the results obtained by the method of Oosterveld are most suitable. The caluclations yielded to pitch ratios between 1. 0 and 1. 3, depending on the water depth. For the model propeller the mean ratio has been defined with P/D= 1. 1. The design of the axial symmetrical Schuschkin nozzle has been done using the calculation sheet of the VBD for 'standard nozzles for inland motor cargo ships'. The unconventional partially <b>integrated</b> <b>nozzle</b> has been developed by Techno-Trans Rostock. With both nozzle types open water propeller tests and propulsion tests {{have been carried out}} on different water depths. The open water tests with the nozzles have been performed on 3 water depths, both in partially integrated and free condition. A dependency of the water depth could not be detected. Both nozzle types were better when they have been partially integrated. The unconventional nozzle, which was more opened to one side was superior in the open water tests compared with the axial symmetrical Schuschkin nozzle. In the propulsion tests both nozzle types have been investigated in partially integrated condition. On all water depths the symmetrical nozzle produced better results in the propulsion efficiency.

The primary data was far-field acoustic spectral directivity.

Data is presented that demonstrate several checks on data quality and that {{provide an overview of}} trends observed to date. Among the findings presented here: (i) Data was repeatable between jet rigs for single nozzles with and without surfaces to within +/- 0. 5 dB. (ii) The presence of a second jet caused a strong reduction of the summed noise in the plane of the two plumes and an increase over the expected source doubling in most other azimuthal planes. (iii) The impact of the second jet was reduced when the jets were unheated. (iv) The impact of adding a second isolated rectangular jet was relatively independent of the nozzle aspect ratio up to aspect ratio 8 : 1. (v) Forward flight had similar impact on a high aspect ratio (8 : 1) jet as on an axisymmetric jet, except at the peak noise angle where the impact was less. (vi) The effect of adding a second round jet to a tightly <b>integrated</b> <b>nozzle</b> where the nozzle lip was less than a diameter from the surface was very dependent upon the length of the surface downstream of the nozzle.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a vertically positioned microfluidic system made of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) and glass, {{which can be}} applied as a microbubble column (ÂµBC) for biotechnological screening in suspension. In this ÂµBC, microbubbles are produced in a cultivation chamber through an <b>integrated</b> <b>nozzle</b> structure. Thus, homogeneous suspension of biomass is achieved in the cultivation chamber without requiring additional mixing elements. Moreover, blockage due to produced carbon dioxide by the microorganisms - a problem predominant in common, horizontally positioned microbioreactors (MBRs) - is avoided, as the gas bubbles are released by buoyancy at {{the upper part of}} the microsystem. The patterned PDMS layer is based on an optimized twolithographic process. Since the naturally hydrophobic PDMS causes problems for the sufficient production of microbubbles, a method based on polyelectrolyte multilayers is applied in order to allow continuous hydrophilization of the already bonded PDMS-glass-system. The ÂµBC comprises various microelements, including stabilization of temperature, control of continuous bubble formation, and two optical configurations for easurement of optical density with two different sensitivities. In addition, the simple and robust application and handling of the ÂµBC is achieved via a custom-made modular plug-in adapter. To validate the scalability from laboratory scale to microscale, and thus to demonstrate the successful application of the ÂµBC as a screening instrument, a batch cultivation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is performed in the ÂµBC and compared to shake flask cultivation. Monitoring of the biomass growth in the ÂµBC with the integrated online analytics resulted in a specific growth rate of 0. 32 h - 1, which is almost identical to the one achieved in the shake flask cultivation (0. 31 h - 1). Therefore, the validity of the ÂµBC as an alternative screening tool compared to other conventional laboratory scale systems in bioprocess development is proven. In addition, vertically positioned microbioreactors show high potential in comparison to conventional screening tools, since they allow for high density of integrated online analytics and therefore minimize time and cost for screening and guarantee improved control and analysis of cultivation parameters...|$|E
40|$|Simultaneous {{multiple}} path measurements of temperature and H 2 O concentration {{will be presented}} for the AIMHYE test entries in the NASA Ames 16 -Inch Shock Tunnel. Monitoring the progress of high temperature chemical reactions that define scramjet combustor efficiencies is a task uniquely suited to nonintrusive optical diagnostics. One application strategy to overcome the many challenges and limitations of nonintrusive measurements is to use laser absorption spectroscopy coupled with optical fibers. Absorption spectroscopic techniques with rapidly tunable lasers are capable of making simultaneous measurements of mole fraction, temperature, pressure, and velocity. The scramjet water absorption diagnostic {{was used to measure}} combustor efficiency and was compared to thrust measurements using a nozzle force balance and <b>integrated</b> <b>nozzle</b> pressures to develop a direct technique for evaluating integrated scramjet performance. Tests were initially performed with a diode laser tuning over a water absorption feature at 1391. 7 nm. A second diode laser later became available at a wavelength near 1343. 3 nm covering an additional water absorption feature and was incorporated in the system for a two-wavelength technique. Both temperature and mole fraction can be inferred from the lineshape analysis using this approach. Additional high temperature spectroscopy research was conducted to reduce uncertainties in the scramjet application. The lasers are optical fiber coupled to ports at the combustor exit and in the nozzle region. The output from the two diode lasers were combined in a single fiber, and the resultant two-wavelength beam was subsequently split into four legs. Each leg was directed through 60 meters of optical fiber to four combustor exit locations for measurement of beam intensity after absorption by the water within the flow. Absorption results will be compared to 1 D combustor analysis using RJPA and nozzle CFD computations as well as to data from a nozzle metric balance measuring thrust and integrated pressure measurements {{along the length of the}} nozzle.

It has two settings: one for washing the anus and one for the bidet. The former is called posterior wash, general use, or family cleaning, and the latter is known as feminine cleaning, feminine wash or simply bidet. At no point does the nozzle actually touch the body of the user. The nozzle is also self-cleaning and cleans itself before and after operation. The user can select to wash the anus or vulva by pressing the corresponding button on the control panel. Usually the same nozzle is used for both operations, but at a different position of the nozzle head, and using different openings in the nozzle to squirt water at a different angle to aim for the correct spot. Occasionally, two nozzles are used, each dedicated for one area. The control logic is also attached to a pressure switch or a proximity sensor in the toilet seat, and operates only when the seat is occupied. The very first models did not include this automatic switch-off. A number of curious users pressed the button while watching the toilet to see its mode of operation, and promptly received a jet of warm water in their faces.|$|R
40|$|Integrated liquid {{chromatography}} (LC) chips are valued {{because of their}} significant advantages over conventional systems. However, they are very challenging to build due to the high complexity of LC systems {{and the need for}} high-level integration of many discrete microfluidic devices. The goal of this thesis is to develop technologies and devices towards a totally integrated LC system on-a-chip. Using parylene microfluidics technology, all of the devices are integrated on silicon wafers with CMOS-compatible batch processes. Due to the small size of the on-chip LC columns, the chips all perform nano LC, which means that the flow rates are on the scale of nano liters per minute. The thesis starts with the solution of the problem of bead integration, since most LC columns are packed with micro-beads. A wafer-scale batch process is developed to integrate beads into micromachined devices. The technology is applied to make an LC-ESI (Electro-Spray Ionization) chip with an integrated bead column packed with 5 Âµm diameter C 18 silica beads. The <b>integrated</b> ESI <b>nozzle</b> allows direct coupling to a mass spectrometer (MS). Due to the high-pressure nature of LC operations, a complete LC chip must be able to both withstand and generate high pressures on-chip. Therefore, an anchoring technique is developed to dramatically increase the pressure rating of parylene devices from about 30 psi to 1000 psi. In addition, on-chip high-pressure generation is achieved with electrolysis-based micro-actuators. An integrated ion {{liquid chromatography}} chip is demonstrated, which has on-chip column, filters, injection structure, and conductivity detector. The column is packed with 7 Âµm anion-exchange beads with a slurry packing technique. On-chip sample injection, separation, and detection of seven common anions are successfully demonstrated with a sensitivity of 1 ppm. Finally, a microchip that demonstrates high-pressure LC with integrated ESI coupling to MS is presented.

40|$|The {{application}} of an ejector <b>nozzle</b> <b>integrated</b> with a reaction drive rotor configuration for a vertical takeoff and landing rotorcraft is considered in this research. The ejector nozzle is {{a device that}} imparts energy from a high speed airflow source to a lower speed secondary airflow inside a duct. The overall nozzle exhaust mass flow rate is increased through fluid entrainment, while the exhaust gas velocity is simultaneously decreased. The exhaust gas velocity is strongly correlated to the jet noise produced by the nozzle, making the ejector {{a good candidate for}} propulsion system noise reduction. Ejector nozzles are mechanically simple in that there are no moving parts. However, coupled fluid dynamic processes are involved, complicating analysis and design. Geometric definitions of the ejector nozzle are determined through a reduced fidelity, multi-disciplinary, representation of the rotary wing ejector. The resulting rotary wing ejector geometric sizing procedure relates standard vehicle and rotor design parameters to the ejector. Additionally, a rotary wing ejector performance procedure is developed to compare this rotor configuration to a conventional rotor. Performance characteristics and aerodynamic effects of the rotor and ejector nozzle are analytically studied. Ejector nozzle performance, in terms of exit velocities, is compared to the primary reaction drive nozzle; giving an indication of the potential for noise reduction. Computational fluid dynamics are paramount in predicting the aerodynamic effects of the ejector nozzle located at the rotor blade tip. Two-dimensional, steady-state, Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models are implemented for sectional lift and drag predictions required for the rotor aerodynamic model associated with both the rotary wing ejector sizing and performance procedures. A three-dimensional, unsteady, RANS simulation of the rotary wing ejector is performed to study the aerodynamic interactions between the ejector nozzle and rotor. Overall performance comparisons are made between the two- and three-dimensional models of the rotary wing ejector, and a similar conventional rotor. Ph. D. Committee Chair: Dr. Daniel P.

40|$|The {{effective}} {{performance of}} modular thrusters in an aerospike configuration {{is difficult to}} determine. Standard analytical tools are applicable to conventional nozzle shapes, but are limited when applied to an aerospike nozzle (An aerospike nozzle is an altitude compensating external nozzle). Three baseline nozzle shapes are derived using standard analytical procedures. The baseline nozzle sizes are restricted to fill a volume envelope. The three shapes are an axi-symmetric round nozzle, a two dimensional planar square exit nozzle, and a super elliptic round to nearly square <b>nozzle.</b> The <b>integrated</b> (thruster/aerospike) performance of the three nozzles is determined {{through the use of}} three dimensional viscous computational fluid dynamic (CFD) calculation where complex features of the flow field can be accurately captured. The resulting installed performance is then used to evaluate the efficiency of these nozzle shapes for aerospike applications. The determination of effective performance of a thruster <b>nozzle</b> <b>integrated</b> into an aerospike nozzle require the solution of the three dimensional turbulent Navier-Stokes equations. The model used in this study consisted of two zones; one of the upstream thruster cowl surface so freestream conditions can be accurately predicted, and two, the aerospike surface beginning with the thruster outflow and extending {{to the end of the}} aerospike surface. The numerical grid consisted of over 120, 000 nodes and used symmetry on the thruster centerline and edge. A two species non-reacting chemistry model was used to capture the variation of fluid properties between the hot plume base and freestream air. From the results of the three baseline nozzle aerospike calculations, the effictive performance of the nozzle was determined. The flow fields of these calculations do show some variation between the cases. Recirculation zones on the cowl surface is predicted for the two dimensional planar nozzle and a smaller one for the super elliptic nozzle. The recirculation is caused by the strong pressure gradient between the plume and freestream flows. The axi-symmetric nozzle results indicate recirculation zones on the thruster face. These recirculation zones smooth the pressure gradient between the plume and freestream flow limiting the formation of recirculation on the cowl surface. Thruster to thruster interaction is evident for the axi-symmetric and supper elliptic calculation while the two dimensional planar nozzle did not have any lateral expansion in the nozzle, so thruster to thruster interaction is limited. The integrated performance results, at the altitude choosen, show very little variation between the three thruster shapes. This result allows for nozzle shape determination based on additional considerations (thermal, structural, weight) besides performance...|$|R
