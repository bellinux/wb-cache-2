In this device gate is applied {{over half of}} the channel and the entire source and hetero-gate dielectric is used. A compact electrostatic model for potential of the proposed device is formulated using central difference technique considering 16 x 16 matrix. Optimization has been done for various gate materials since electrical parameters like OFF current, ON current, threshold voltage, vertical electric field are strong function of gate work function. Furthermore, the proposed device is also compared with cuboidal partially gate-all-around 3 D structure for gate oxide scaling. The results of the potential model show good agreement with the simulated data obtained from TCAD simulation.

The excellent electrostatic control of the channel by the gate reduces dramatically short channel effects, such as charge sharing and DIBL.

Indeed the effect of high-κ dielectric on Field Induced Barrier Lowering (FIBL) has been studied. Due to the higher electron mobility in tensile strained silicon, the n-type FETs with strained silicon channel have better drain current compare with the pure Si one. In this structure gate dielectric divided in two parts, we have used high-κ dielectric near the source and low-κ dielectric near the drain to reduce the short channel effects. By this structure short channel effects such as FIBL will be reduced indeed by increasing the RSiGe, ID-VD characteristics will be improved. The leakage current and transfer characteristics, the threshold-voltage (Vt), the drain induced barrier height lowering (DIBL), are estimated with respect to, gate bias (VG), RSiGe and different gate dielectrics.
