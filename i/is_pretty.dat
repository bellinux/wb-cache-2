5|$|In {{the case}} of '4 Minutes', Tim had a vision from the {{beginning}} of how things should go, especially sonically... When I opened up the session of '4 Minutes', there was so much going on that I knew right away that the hard part would be {{to make sure that the}} vocals would cut through and were right in the pocket. Beginning with working on the vocals was the only way to achieve this. After that I formed all the other parts around the vocals. The other challenge was to make sure that everything in the track sounded clear and that you could hear every instrument, every syllable, every breath. Also, I do almost always work linear in time on a track. It's easier, because when you're done, you're done. So I keep working on section after section, until I get to the end of the track and then I know the whole mix <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> close.|$|E

25|$|The {{result of}} these {{combined}} causes {{is shown in the}} character of the seasons. Fogs are frequent, especially during the summer; frosts do not occur until the middle of October; ice forms on raised surfaces at least once a winter; snows are frequently light, seldom remaining on the ground {{more than two or three}} days, except in the higher elevations. The average rainfall is about fifty-three inches, which <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> uniformly distributed throughout the year.|$|E
25|$|Some African American {{students}} have reported feeling that their self-esteem {{has been raised}} by the class. However, some students feel that the class has shortcomings; they say that it <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> similar to a typical US history course, and that critical conversations about race are generally absent from class. The class does not always relate the topics of the course to issues related to race and racism that are present today. Some students praise the course because it adds representation in an otherwise fairly Euro-centric curriculum.|$|E

Jagannathan ends up being the chief political adviser for a struggling candidate John Kory (Sean James Sutton) in the California governor's election campaign and his use of tactics standard in Indian politics to win the election.|$|E

She is innocent to the sexual and narcotic world in which Effy indulges, but is ready and willing to explore it. Thomas Tomone (Merveille Lukeba) is an immigrant from DR Congo, with a morally upright outlook and good-hearted nature, and his storyline sees him becoming romantically involved with Pandora.|$|E
25|$|Nest refoundation by colonies that {{lose the}} {{original}} one <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> common, and allows this species of wasps {{to thrive in}} highly disturbed landscapes, that face frequent fires or other disturbances. When the nest is destroyed or goes lost, the swarm just moves to a near point (a branch or else) and begins another nest. Sometimes, when {{there are lots of}} wasps, the swarm may break up and create several new little nests. Only the one with the foundress in it will produce female offspring and complete the cycle, while the other ones will end up producing worker males. If one of those secondary nests is lost, its workers will rather rejoin a near group of other sisters instead of trying to found it again.|$|E
25|$|In 1682 he was, at {{more than}} sixty years of age, {{recognized}} as one of the foremost men of letters of France. Madame de Sévigné, one of the soundest literary critics of the time, and by no means given to praise mere novelties, had spoken of his second collection of Fables published in the winter of 1678 as divine; and it <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> certain that this was the general opinion. It was not unreasonable, therefore, that he should present himself to the Académie française, and, though the subjects of his Contes were scarcely calculated to propitiate that decorous assembly, while his attachment to Fouquet and to more than one representative of the old Frondeur party made him suspect to Colbert and the king, most of the members were his personal friends.|$|E

25|$|Erik Satie, Arthur Honegger, Darius Milhaud and {{the other}} members of The Group of Six in Paris never made any secret of their sympathy for ragtime, which is {{sometimes}} evident in their works. Consider, in particular, the ballet of Satie, Parade (Ragtime du Paquebot), (1917) and La Mort de Monsieur Mouche, an overture for piano for a drama in three acts, composed in the early 1900s in memory of his friend J.P. Contamine de Latour. In 1902 the American cakewalk was very popular in Paris and Satie two years later wrote two rags, La Diva de l'empire and Piccadilly. Despite the two Anglo-Saxon settings, the tracks appear American-inspired. La Diva de l'empire, a march for piano soloist, was written for Paulette Darty and initially bore the title Stand-Walk Marche; it was later subtitled Intermezzo Americain when Rouarts-Lerolle reprinted it in 1919. Piccadilly, another march, was initially titled The Transatlantique; it presented a stereotypical wealthy American heir sailing on an ocean liner on the New York–Europe route, going to trade his fortune for an aristocratic title in Europe. There is a similar influence in Milhaud's ballets Le boeuf sur le toite and Creation du Monde, which he wrote after a trip to Harlem during his trip in 1922. Even the Swiss composer Honegger wrote works in which the influence of African American music <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> obvious. Examples include Pacific 231, Prélude et Blues and especially the Concertino for piano and orchestra.|$|E
