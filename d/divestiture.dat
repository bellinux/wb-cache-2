5|$|The Army {{was using}} an {{incremental}} approach to combat vehicle modernization, {{centered on the}} Ground Combat Vehicle. The deployment was to be synchronized with upgrades, reset, and <b>divestiture</b> of existing vehicles. Vehicles displaced by the IFV may then replace selected M113 family of vehicles such as command and control, medical evacuation, and mortar carrier, allowing the Army to begin <b>divestiture</b> of the M113 family of vehicles. Upgrades to existing Bradley and Stryker vehicles may have been considered as risk mitigation based on {{the rate at which}} the GCV was introduced. Although upgraded, the Bradley and Stryker would also be replaced in the midterm.|$|E
5|$|On top of {{the failure}} of the franchises to approve the spin-off, a series of {{lawsuits}} complicated the <b>divestiture.</b> Two legal challenges to the parent company were filed by investors, one in Pillsbury's home state of Minnesota and another in the state where it was incorporated, Delaware, in which the legality of the stock tender plan was questioned. These three events eventually forced Pillsbury to give up its bid to fend off Grand Metropolitan and agree to be acquired in November 1988 for a sum of US$5.7 billion.|$|E
30|$|Second, {{managers}} undertake <b>divestitures</b> voluntarily. Most {{studies of}} <b>divestitures,</b> whether {{they appear in}} the finance or strategy literatures, explore either the motivations for or the implications of <b>divestitures</b> that managers choose to undertake, rather than <b>divestitures</b> that managers are mandated to undertake by some external entity such as a regulatory body. While this assumption, on its face, may {{not appear to be}} terribly consequential, it actually does have two important implications. One is that it underscores the need for scholars who are conducting empirical studies of <b>divestitures</b> to use statistical methodologies that account for the effects of non-random selection in the firms that choose to undertake <b>divestitures</b> (or certain types of <b>divestitures).</b> The other is that this assumption reveals an interesting opportunity for future research, namely, to identify a context in which certain firms are exogenously impelled to undertake <b>divestitures</b> and to study the causal consequences of those deals for those companies.|$|R
30|$|Divesting {{firms are}} the most broadly {{applicable}} unit of analysis with which to address why firms undertake <b>divestitures</b> and what implications <b>divestitures</b> have for firm performance, since one can readily observe whether divesting firms systematically display particular characteristics or experience certain performance trajectories. The biggest challenge with using divesting firms as {{the unit of analysis}} is the identification of a relevant counterfactual against which to benchmark these companies. More specifically, while one might hypothesize that certain firms are more likely to undertake <b>divestitures</b> or that performance improves when companies undertake <b>divestitures</b> (or particular types of <b>divestitures),</b> the questions that flow directly out of these predictions are “more likely to undertake <b>divestitures</b> relative to which firms?” and “performance improves relative to what?” Comparable firms that do not undertake <b>divestitures</b> are a useful counterfactual (Feldman 2015 b), as are companies that retain business units that are comparable to those that the divesting firms divested (Feldman 2014).|$|R
30|$|This article {{provides}} {{an introduction to}} <b>divestitures</b> and the research streams that examine these deals. <b>Divestitures</b> are defined as the removal {{of one or more}} of a company’s lines of business via selloff or spinoff. In this article, we describe how research on <b>divestitures</b> has evolved in the finance and strategy literatures, and we explain how to design and conduct empirical research studies on this topic. We also discuss the implications of <b>divestitures</b> for organization design, and outline some directions for future research in this domain.|$|R

5|$|Another major {{correction}} of Enron's earnings was announced on November 9, with {{a reduction of}} $591 million of the stated revenue of years 1997–2000. The charges were said to come largely from two special purpose partnerships (JEDI and Chewco). The corrections resulted in the virtual elimination of profit for fiscal year 1997, with significant reductions for the other years. Despite this disclosure, Dynegy declared it still intended to purchase Enron. Both companies {{were said to be}} anxious to receive an official assessment of the proposed sale from Moody's and S presumably to understand the effect the completion of any buyout transaction would have on Dynegy and Enron's credit rating. In addition, concerns were raised regarding antitrust regulatory restrictions resulting in possible <b>divestiture,</b> along with what to some observers were the radically different corporate cultures of Enron and Dynegy.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, {{after eight}} years of private operation, the Pillsbury Company {{acquired}} the Burger King brand and its parent company Burger King Corporation. At the time of the purchase, the chain had grown to 274 restaurants in the United States. Pillsbury continued to grow the company utilizing the existing franchise system despite its flaws. The power of its independent franchises came to a head in 1973 when Chart House, owner of 350 restaurants and one of its largest franchise groups, attempted to purchase the chain from Pillsbury for $100million (USD) which Pillsbury declined. When Chart House's bid failed, its owners Billy and Jimmy Trotter put forth a second plan that would require Pillsbury and Chart House spin off their respective holdings and merge the two entities into a separate company. Again Pillsbury declined the proposed <b>divestiture.</b> After the failed attempts to acquire the company, the relationship with Chart House and the Trotters soured; when Chart House purchased several restaurants in Boston and Houston in 1979, Burger King sued the selling franchisees for failing to comply with the right of first refusal clause in their contracts. Burger King won the case, successfully preventing the sale. The two parties did eventually reach a settlement where Chart House kept the Houston locations in their portfolio. Chart House eventually spun off its Burger King holdings and refocused on its higher end chains; its Burger King holding company, DiversiFoods, was eventually acquired by Pillsbury $390million (USD) in 1984 and folded into Burger King's operations.|$|E

40|$|Shareholders benefit when firms divest assets, {{but where}} do the gains come from? We find that the long term {{performance}} of the parent firm improves when assets are sold to another firm, but not when assets are sold to unit management. Our evidence suggests that gains from interfirm <b>divestitures</b> arise from within the parent firm as negative synergies are eliminated. <b>Divestitures</b> to unit managers are different. Gains from these <b>divestitures</b> do not arise from removing negative synergies, but likely arise from more efficient contracting.

40|$|We use new firm-level data {{to examine}} the effects of firm <b>divestitures</b> and {{privatization}} on corporate performance in a rapidly emerging market economy. Unlike the existing literature, we control for accompanying ownership changes and the fact that <b>divestitures</b> and ownership are potentially endogenous variables. We find that <b>divestitures</b> increase the firm's profitability but do not alter its scale of operations, while the effect of privatization depends on the resulting ownership structure - sometimes improving performance and sometimes bringing about decline. The effects of privatization are thus more nuanced than suggested in earlier studies. Methodologically, our study provides evidence that it is important to control for changes in ownership when analyzing <b>divestitures</b> and to control for endogeneity, selection and data attrition when analyzing the effects of <b>divestitures</b> and privatization.

40|$|Using {{a product}} markets {{perspective}} {{to investigate the}} decision to vertically disintegrate, we find that vertical <b>divestitures</b> are more likely in response to positive industry demand shocks, favorable industry financing conditions, and lower parent firm relative productivity and are less likely when the potential for contracting problems is high. Conditional on vertical <b>divestitures,</b> equity carve-outs are more likely in environments in which relationship-specific investments are more prevalent and when the need for external funds is high, while spin-offs are more likely in larger industries and in industries that experience positive demand shocks.

40|$|We study {{a sample}} of <b>divestitures</b> that alter the divisional {{organizational}} structure of diversified firms. We find that these firms experience substantial increases in firm value around the reorganization. Firms that continue to operate as diversified firms cut back on divisional investment levels and display improvements in the allocation of capital across divisions. Firms that refocus to become single segment firms significantly increase the investment of the surviving division. We find that improvements in the efficiency with which internal capital markets allocate investment are an important determinant of the gains from <b>divestitures.</b> <b>Divestitures</b> also enhance firm value by providing a source of funding for financially constrained segments. 2 <b>Divestitures</b> and Divisional Investment Policie...|$|R
30|$|To study <b>divestitures,</b> it {{is first}} {{important}} {{to identify the}} entities {{that are involved in}} those deals. Consistent with the foregoing discussion, this involves identifying divesting firms, divested business units, and either acquiring firms that buy divested business units (in the case of selloffs) or spinoff firms (in the case of spinoffs). Identifying each of these entities makes it possible to gather data on their attributes, such as their financial characteristics, their industrial classifications (i.e., their SIC or NAICS codes), the composition of their top management teams and boards of directors, their coverage by securities analysts (for publicly-traded companies), and the like. These characteristics can be used to measure the motivations for <b>divestitures</b> (e.g., does inappropriately-specialized analyst coverage drive firms to undertake <b>divestitures?),</b> to quantify the performance implications of <b>divestitures</b> (e.g., how do <b>divestitures</b> affect the return on equity of the divesting firms?), and to control for heterogeneity in the performance consequences of these deals. As mentioned previously, it is also necessary to gather analogous information on the companies that comprise the counterfactual set to the entities that are involved in the <b>divestitures</b> in the sample.|$|R

30|$|A {{third way}} to {{generate}} new research questions on <b>divestitures</b> {{is to identify}} novel dependent variables {{that have yet to}} be explored. As has been mentioned, various measures of stock market returns are the dependent variable that studies have typically used to represent the outcomes of <b>divestitures</b> (Markides 1992; Comment and Jarrell 1995; John and Ofek 1995; Daley et al. 1997; Desai and Jain 1999). However, this approach limits the conclusions that can be drawn about <b>divestitures</b> to addressing how investors respond to these deals. Thus, studies exploring how <b>divestitures</b> affect other performance metrics, such as operating performance (Bergh 1995; Feldman 2014) or analyst coverage (Krishnaswami and Subramaniam 1999; Gilson et al. 2001; Feldman 2015 a) would be a welcome addition to this field.|$|R
