25|$|The symbol {{was held}} by some as {{something}} to follow, many fans getting the symbol tattooed on their bodies. Many in the skateboard and surf subcultures have featured the symbol on their boards. Others saw <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>something</b> distasteful - the call sign of a forming cult. To some, the symbol recalled Nazi regalia. Tek has denied this, adamantly maintaining that the band and its music are apolitical, with no wish to present propaganda of any sort.|$|E

25|$|At present, {{the islanders}} are about evenly split between those favouring {{independence}} {{and those who}} prefer to continue {{as a part of}} the Kingdom of Denmark. Within both camps there is a wide range of opinions. Of those who favour independence, some are in favour of an immediate unilateral declaration of independence. Others see <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>something</b> to be attained gradually and with the full consent of the Danish government and the Danish nation. In the unionist camp there are also many who foresee and welcome a gradual increase in autonomy even while strong ties with Denmark are maintained.|$|E

500|$|... "Shiver" [...] {{was written}} {{two years before}} its release. Accordingly, Martin wrote the song while {{thinking}} of Australian singer-songwriter Natalie Imbruglia, the woman he was linked to, but later denied it. Some accounts have claimed, however, that Imbruglia was indeed not Martin's inspiration in writing the song. Instead, he {{appeared to have been}} inspired with girlfriends in his teenage days and early 20s. Martin actually wrote the song in a [...] "glum" [...] day, when he felt he would never find the right woman for him. He described <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>something</b> of a [...] "stalking song", admitting he wrote it for a specific woman. In addition, Martin wrote the song while listening to music of Buckley, and had claimed it is their [...] "most blatant rip-off song".|$|E
500|$|The Athsheans, in contrast, {{are shown}} as an {{innately}} peaceful and non-aggressive people, {{at least at}} the beginning of novel. Rape and murder are virtually unknown on the planet. They have adopted a number of behaviors that preempt violence; thus when Selver has Davidson pinned down after the attack on Smith camp, he finds himself unable to kill Davidson, despite the hate he feels towards the Terran. Selver spends much of the novel reflecting on the effect that violence has on his own culture. He turns to violence, against the Athshean ethic, in order to save his culture as he sees it. However, unlike Davidson, who enjoys killing, Selver sees <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>something</b> poisoning his culture. This perception is shared by his fellow Athsheans: one of the elders of the Athsheans says to Selver [...] "You've done what you had to do, and it was not right." ...|$|E
500|$|Designed by Tetsuya Nomura, Tifa was {{not present}} in early {{versions}} of Final Fantasy VII, as initially, the game was to have only three playable characters; the protagonist Cloud Strife, Aerith Gainsborough and Barret Wallace. However, during {{a phone call to}} project director Yoshinori Kitase, it was suggested that {{at some point in the}} game, one of the main characters should die, and after much discussion as to whether it should be Barret or Aerith, the producers chose Aerith. Nomura later joked that this was his idea, so as to enable him to introduce Tifa into the game. Regardless, the notion of having two concurrent heroines, and having the hero waver between them, was something Kitase liked, describing <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>something</b> new in the Final Fantasy series. Nomura describes Tifa's character in Advent Children as having several dimensions, calling her [...] "like a mother, a sweetheart, and a close ally in battle" [...] and [...] "remarkably strong, not only emotionally, but physically as well." ...|$|E

500|$|Executive {{producer}} Gary Glasberg began {{discussing the}} possibility of killing off Ziva's father and Vance's wife {{in the spring of}} 2012. He approached Rocky Carroll and Cote de Pablo about the potential storyline, as well as Paula Newsome and Michael Nouri, who portray Jackie Vance and Eli David respectively. De Pablo was interested in the idea, seeing the ramifications of <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>something</b> that had not been explored with her character before, and Carroll agreed that the death of Vance's wife would dynamically change his role in the series. Glasberg reported that Newsome and Nouri were understandably unhappy about their characters' deaths, but agreed to [...] "give it everything they could". The plot twist, initially advertised as a [...] "huge Ziva story" [...] that would [...] "rock Vance's world", culminated in Eli and Jackie being shot to death in a house attack in the 11th episode of the season, [...] "Shabbat Shalom".|$|E
500|$|A large seabird, the albatross, {{played a}} central part in Samuel Taylor Coleridge's {{influential}} 1798 poem The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, which in turn {{gave rise to the}} usage of albatross as metaphor for a burden. In his 1902 poem The Sea and the Hills, Rudyard Kipling expresses the urge for the sea, and uses alliteration to suggest the sea's sound and rhythms: [...] "Who hath desired the Sea?—the sight of salt water unbounded— The heave and the halt and the hurl and the crash of the comber wind-hounded?" [...] John Masefield also felt the pull of the sea in his Sea Fever, writing [...] "I must go down to the seas again, to the lonely sea and the sky." [...] The Argentine Jorge Luis Borges wrote the 1964 poem El mar (The Sea), treating <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>something</b> that constantly regenerates the world and the people who contemplate it, and that is very close to the essence of being human.|$|E
500|$|The Duke {{was highly}} unpopular with crews, who {{regarded}} <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>something</b> of a liability {{due to its}} poor steam production. Inefficiencies caused by the aforementioned problems regarding the draughting abilities and firebox design meant that no further examples were constructed. [...] The fact that no {{effort was made to}} rectify these problems indicates the change in policy regarding steam locomotives, with the Modernisation Plan entering circulation as the [...] "Duke" [...] entered service. Based for its entire working life at Crewe North depot, the locomotive was utilised in hauling boat trains on the undemanding North Wales Coast Line between Crewe and Holyhead. All of this culminated in the locomotive having a short service life of only eight years, being withdrawn from service in 1962. The reputation of the locomotive amongst its crews as being a poor steamer was eventually to disappear – but only after it was rescued from the scrapyard during 1974.|$|E
50|$|There are {{essentially}} three varieties of art forger. The person who actually creates the fraudulent piece, {{the person who}} discovers a piece and attempts to pass <b>it</b> off <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>it</b> is not, {{in order to increase}} the piece’s value, and the third who discovers that a work is a fake, but sells <b>it</b> <b>as</b> an original anyway.|$|R

500|$|Barre wrote a {{work on the}} Bible {{entitled}} Compendium de veteri et novo testamento, {{which he}} dedicated to Longchamp. The work arranged passages from the Bible under topics, and then annotated the passages with marginal notations such as were done with glosses on Roman law. It is still extant in two manuscript (MS) copies, MS British Library Harley 3255, and Lambeth Palace MS 105. The Harley manuscript is shorter than the Lambeth manuscript. Richard Sharpe, a modern historian who studied both works, stated that the Harley manuscript [...] "provides [...] well structured and systematic (though not complete) coverage of the whole Bible." [...] Because of the dedication to William Longchamp as [...] "bishop, legate, and chancellor", {{it is likely that}} the work was composed between January 1190 and October 1191, as Longchamp only held those three offices together during that period. The prologue to the work describes <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>something</b> to be used privately, and thus Sharpe feels that it was not intended to be a publicly published work; instead Barre may have intended it for Longchamp's private use in preparing sermons.|$|E
500|$|Victoria Principal {{has said}} that she feels Pam changed {{throughout}} the course of the series. She commented, [...] "Pam didn’t have two parents, her father was a drunkard, and she really had to fight for everything she aspired to and achieved. When Bobby married her, he wasn’t marrying milk toast; she was very, very spirited; she was always a good person. I always felt Pam was the moral centre of the programme but she was complicated, and she was fiery, she had opinions, and she was not afraid to voice them. But as the years went by, as JR became more and more evil, the writers felt, and I certainly understand why {{for the benefit of the}} show, that Pam had to become more and more good." [...] When asked about whether she had any input on her characters growth, she said: [...] "Once the show achieved extraordinary world wide fame, I don’t think any of us had much input. [...] You know the old saying, if it's not broken, don’t fix it; I really believe that Lorimar Television looked upon <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>something</b> that was working and they did not want to deviate from the formula." ...|$|E
500|$|Flower {{was well}} {{received}} by critics. Alice Liang of 1UP.com applauded the game, saying that [...] "the {{freedom of movement}} makes the game feel as relaxing as a gently wafting breeze". She felt that [...] "fun" [...] did not fully describe the game experience, saying {{that it had a}} [...] "well-constructed movie's emotional arc" [...] and that the game's music, visuals, and gameplay all drew the player into a compelling emotional experience. She also felt that it was very replayable, which offset its brevity. Ryan Clements of IGN agreed with Liang's opinion, saying that it provided [...] "more enjoyment, emotion and enlightenment than any game" [...] he had played in years. Though he noted that the game would not appeal to everyone, he described it as [...] "something very unique and very powerful", referring to it as a [...] "must-play". Michael Kontoudis of PALGN called it an [...] "utterly unique, brave and moving game brimming with personality and intent", though he noted that as it was closer to a work of art than a game, many players would not be interested in it. Gerard Campbell of The Press similarly described <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>something</b> more than a game, calling it a [...] "perfect foil" [...] to [...] "ultra-violent shoot-'em-up" [...] games and summarizing it as [...] "one of the most refreshing and relaxing games around".|$|E

500|$|Another {{reviewer}} {{who liked}} the graphics was Dawn Jepsen of Computer Gaming World, who also praised the humour, especially the [...] "wackiness" [...] of the illnesses, {{and described the}} game as [...] "delightful and absorbing". The humour was also approved by a reviewer of Jeuxvideo.com, who, like other reviewers, lauded the graphics, by describing them as colourful. Next Generation reviewer echoed others' views about the humour, describing <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>something</b> {{they had come to}} except from Bullfrog, but criticised the lack of multiplayer support. The humour was again praised by a reviewer of PC Power, who said that the ailments enabled Bullfrog to have [...] "hilarious" [...] cures. The [...] "thoroughly engrossing" [...] gameplay, and the graphics were also complimented: it was stated that the bright colours gave hospitals a [...] "cheerful look". Theme Hospital was described as a [...] "fantastic title". Other comments from critics included Edge reviewer's compliments of the balance of patients and illnesses against the player's resources, and his belief that the game is a refinement of its genre, and PC Zone reviewers commendation of the detail: it was remarked that it gets players [...] "helplessly immersed", and the game was awarded the PC Zone Classic accolade. Éric Ernaux of [...] said the quality is [...] "remarkable for a game of its genre".|$|E
500|$|In the 19-minute {{music video}} for [...] "Bad"—directed by Martin Scorsese—Jackson began using sexual imagery and choreography not {{previously}} {{seen in his}} work. He occasionally grabbed or touched his chest, torso and crotch. When asked by Oprah in the 1993 interview about why he grabbed his crotch, he replied, [...] "I think it happens subliminally" [...] and he described <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>something</b> that was not planned, but rather, as something that was compelled by the music. [...] "Bad" [...] garnered a mixed reception from both fans and critics; Time magazine described it as [...] "infamous". The video also featured Wesley Snipes; in the future Jackson's videos would often feature famous cameo roles. For the [...] "Smooth Criminal" [...] video, Jackson experimented with an anti-gravity lean where the performer leans forward at a 45 degree angle, beyond the performer's center of gravity. To accomplish this move live, Jackson and designers developed a special shoe that locks the performer's feet to the stage, allowing them to lean forward. They were granted [...] for the device. Although the music video for [...] "Leave Me Alone" [...] was not officially released in the US, in 1989 it was nominated for three Billboard Music Video Awards; the same year it won a Golden Lion Award {{for the quality of}} the special effects used in its production. In 1990, [...] "Leave Me Alone" [...] won a Grammy for Best Music Video, Short Form.|$|E
500|$|In January1994, Simon co-created with comedian George Carlin {{the sitcom}} The George Carlin Show for Fox. It aired for 27 episodes before being {{canceled}} in December1995. Simon served as showrunner throughout its run and directed several episodes. Simon persuaded Carlin {{to do the}} show after writing <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>something</b> which would not be [...] "typically sitcomy." [...] He conceived the show as what Carlin's {{life would have been}} like had he never become a comedian; Carlin played a heavy drinking New York taxi driver. Simon commented: [...] "When I was doing The Simpsons, people couldn't see how smart {{it was because of the}} low moments. There's something about this show. People who like it say it's classy. They don't see how vulgar it is." [...] Carlin wrote negatively of his relationship with Simon. On his own website, Carlin wrote of the show: [...] "always check mental health of creative partner beforehand. Loved the actors, loved the crew. Had a great time. Couldn't wait to get the fuck out of there." [...] In his final book, the posthumously published Last Words (2009), Carlin elaborated: [...] "I had a great time. I never laughed so much, so often, so hard as I did with cast members Alex Rocco, Chris Rich, Tony Starke. There was a very strange, very good sense of humor on that stage ... The biggest problem, though, was that Sam Simon was a fucking horrible person to be around. Very, very funny, extremely bright and brilliant, but an unhappy person who treated other people poorly." [...] Simon described himself as [...] "combative" [...] and said that most people see him as having a [...] "bad attitude".|$|E
