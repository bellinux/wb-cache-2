5|$|Preterm newborns {{are known}} to be at <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> bronchopulmonary {{dysplasia}} with extended exposure to high concentrations of oxygen. Other groups at <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> oxygen toxicity are patients on mechanical ventilation with exposure to levels of oxygen greater than 50%, and patients exposed to chemicals that increase risk for oxygen toxicity such the chemotherapeutic agent bleomycin. Therefore, current guidelines for patients on mechanical ventilation in intensive care recommends keeping oxygen concentration less than 60%. Likewise, divers who undergo treatment of decompression sickness are at increased risk of oxygen toxicity as treatment entails exposure to long periods of oxygen breathing under hyperbaric conditions, in addition to any oxygen exposure during the dive.|$|E

5|$|Birt, Hogg, and Dubé {{examined}} {{a family with}} a hereditary thyroid cancer and discovered {{that many of the}} members had fibrofolliculomas, trichodiscomas, and acrochordons, which became defined as the classical symptoms of the eponymous disease. The first case of spontaneous pneumothorax associated with BHD was discovered in 1986; the first case of renal cancer followed in 1993 and the presence of lung cysts in people with BHD was confirmed in 1999. It was formerly thought that people with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome were at <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> colorectal polyps and neoplasms, but this has been disproven. The BHD Foundation supports research into the syndrome and holds regular symposia in BHD and related disorders for researchers, clinicians, and family members.|$|E
5|$|Genetics {{may play}} a role in the risk that a person will develop PTE; people with the ApoE-ε4 allele may be at <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> PTE. The {{haptoglobin}} Hp2-2 allele may be another genetic risk factor, possibly because it binds hemoglobin poorly and thus allows more iron to escape and damage tissues. However, most studies have found that having family members with epilepsy does not significantly increase the risk of PTS, suggesting that genetics are not a strong risk factor.|$|E

5|$|Suicide is {{the act of}} {{intentionally}} causing one's own death. Risk {{factors include}} mental disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, personality disorders, and substance abuse, including alcoholism and use of benzodiazepines.

Those who have previously attempted suicide are at <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> future attempts. Suicide prevention efforts include limiting access to methods of suicide, such as firearms, drugs, and poisons, treating mental disorders and substance misuse, proper media reporting of suicide, and improving economic conditions.

5|$|Decompression {{sickness}} and arterial gas embolism in recreational diving {{are associated with}} certain demographic, environmental, and dive style factors. A statistical study published in 2005 tested potential risk factors: age, gender, body mass index, smoking, asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, previous decompression illness, years since certification, dives in the last year, number of diving days, number of dives in a repetitive series, last dive depth, nitrox use, and drysuit use. No significant associations with risk of decompression sickness or arterial gas embolism were found for asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, smoking, or body mass index. Increased depth, previous DCI, larger number of consecutive days diving, and being male were associated with <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> decompression {{sickness and}} arterial gas embolism. Nitrox and drysuit use, greater frequency of diving in the past year, increasing age, and years since certification were associated with lower risk, possibly as indicators of more extensive training and experience.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To help {{elucidate}} {{the mechanism of}} action of the Arabin cervical pessary in pregnancies at <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> preterm delivery. Methods: Cervical length and uterocervical angle were evaluated in relation to gestational age in 198 pregnancies not at <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> preterm birth that underwent clinical fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Additionally, in 73 singleton pregnancies at <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> preterm birth, an Arabin cervical pessary was placed at 14 - 33 weeks' gestation. We performed MRI of the cervix immediately before and after placement and at monthly follow-up until removal of the pessary. In a subgroup of 54 pregnancies with a short cervix and pessary placement at 17 - 31 weeks' gestation, the uterocervical angle and cervical length at follow-up were compared with the preplacement values. Results: In pregnancies not at <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> preterm birth, the uterocervical angle did not vary, but cervical length showed a significant decrease with gestational age (r = - 0. 15, P 0. 05). Conclusion: In patients at <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> preterm delivery, correct placement of the Arabin cervical pessary should be checked immediately; this can be performed quickly and easily using MRI. This study provides some evidence that, in singleton pregnancies with a short cervix, a cervical pessary delays birth through a mechanical effect on the uterocervical angle. Copyright © 2013 ISUOG.
