40|$|The {{motion of}} a test {{particle}} in the gravitational field of a non-spherical source endowed with both mass and mass quadrupole moment is investigated when a test radiation field is also present. The background is described by the Erez-Rosen solution, which is a static spacetime belonging to the Weyl class of solutions to the vacuum Einstein's field equations, and reduces to the familiar Schwarzschild solution when the quadrupole parameter vanishes. The radiation flux has a fixed but arbitrary (non-zero) angular momentum. The interaction with the radiation field {{is assumed to be}} Thomson-like, i. e., the particles absorb and re-emit radiation, thus suffering for a friction-like drag force. Such an additional force is responsible for the Poynting-Robertson effect, which is well established in the framework of Newtonian gravity and has been recently extended to the general theory of relativity. The balance between gravitational attraction, centrifugal force and radiation drag leads to the occurrence of <b>equilibrium</b> circular <b>orbits</b> which are attractors for the surrounding matter for every fixed value of the interaction strength. The presence of the quadrupolar structure of the source introduces a further degree of freedom: there exists a whole family of <b>equilibrium</b> <b>orbits</b> parametrized by the quadrupole parameter, generalizing previous works.

40|$|We analyze growth {{dynamics}} {{in an economy}} where a private good can be consumed {{as a substitute for}} a free access environmental good. In this context we show that environmental deterioration may be an engine of economic growth. To protect themselves against environmental deterioration, economic agents are forced to increase their labour supply to increase the production and consumption of the private good. This, in turn, further depletes the environmental good, leading economic agents to further increase their labour supply and private consumption and so on. This substitution process may give rise to self-enforcing {{growth dynamics}} characterized by a lack of correlation between capital accumulation and private consumption levels, on one side, and economic agents’ welfare, on the other. Furthermore, we show that agents’ self-protection consumption choices can generate indeterminacy; that is, they can give rise to the existence of a continuum of (Nash) <b>equilibrium</b> <b>orbits</b> leading to the same attracting fixed point or periodic orbit. ...|$|R

The simulation uses as input the velocity and equilibrium radius of the synchronous molecule taken from simulations of the synchrotron [39], and the longitudinal and transverse position and velocity distributions of the argon beams. The horizontal displacement of the argon beam relative to the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>orbit</b> of the ammonia molecules was varied in order to optimize the fit (simultaneously for all 8 curves).

The former determines the time difference between the peaks in Figs.  12 and 13, while the latter determines an off-set for the time axis. Furthermore, the simulations are scaled vertically to match the experimental data for each of the 8 curves individually. As seen from the figure, the simulations describe the measurements very well. For instance, the width of the distributions is well reproduced and so is the difference in signal at the two peaks. This agreement confirms that we have an excellent understanding of the experiment.|$|E

40|$|Alternating {{gradient}} (AG) focusing 1 {{provides a}} high degree of stability for both the radial and vertical modes of betatron oscillations in circular particle accelerators.

These machines contain stable <b>equilibrium</b> <b>orbits</b> for all particles from the injection energy to the output energy. These orbits may all be in an annular ring, as in a synchrotron or betatron; the magnetic field must then change rapidly with radius to provide orbits for the different energy particles.

40|$|We {{calculate}} global $m= 1 $ modes {{with low}} pattern speed corresponding to introducing a finite eccentricity into a protoplanetary disc. We consider disc models which are either isolated or contain {{one or two}} protoplanets orbiting in an inner cavity. Global modes that are strongly coupled to inner protoplanets are found to have disc orbits which tend to have apsidal lines antialigned with respect {{to those of the}} inner protoplanets. Other modes corresponding to free disc modes may be global over a large range of length scales and accordingly be long lived. We consider the motion of a protoplanet in the earth mass range embedded in an eccentric disc and determine the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>orbits</b> which maintain fixed apsidal alignment with respect to the disc gas <b>orbits.</b> <b>Equilibrium</b> eccentricities are found to be comparable or possibly exceed the disc eccentricity. We then approximately calculate the tidal interaction with the disc in order to estimate the orbital migration rate. Results are found to deviate from the case of axisymmetric disc with near circular protoplanet orbit once eccentricities of protoplanet and disc orbits become comparable to the disc aspect ratio in magnitude. Aligned protoplanet orbits with very similar eccentricity to that of the gas disc are found to undergo litle eccentricity change while undergoing inward migration in general. However, for significantly larger orbital eccentricities, migration may be significantly reduced or even reverse from inwards to outwards. Thus the existence of global non circular motions in discs with radial excursions comparable to the semi-thickness may have important consequences for the migration and survival of protoplanetary cores in the earth mass range.

The experimental energy spectra have been compared with those obtained from the statistical model calculation with "deformability" parameters predicted by rotating liquid drop model (RLDM) and also fitted the same with optimized "deformability" parameters, which are quite different from the respective RLDM values. The data have also been found to be explained quite well using "frozen" deformation approximation, where the "deformability" parameters have been kept fixed at RLDM values of the parent nucleus throughout the decay process. The effective radius in the latter case is smaller compared to that obtained using the optimized parameters; however, in both cases, the deformations (effective radii) are larger than the corresponding RLDM values. So, considering the uncertainties in the estimation of actual compound nucleus deformations, it can, only qualitatively, be said that <b>equilibrium</b> <b>orbiting,</b> which is similar to particle evaporation in time scale, could also be one of the contributing factors for the observed deformation.

With respect to fast particles dynamics, the extended model captures the range of particles motion (trapped/passing) with energy and thus represents a more realistic 1 D picture of the long range sweeping events observed for weakly damped modes, e. g. global Alfven eigenmodes, in tokamaks. The Poisson equation is solved numerically along with bounce averaging the Vlasov equation in the adiabatic regime.
