40|$|Objectives. To {{understand}} why a complex breastfeeding coaching intervention, which offered health professional-facilitated breastfeeding groups for pregnant and breastfeeding mothers and personal peer coaches, was more <b>effective</b> at improving <b>breastfeeding</b> rates {{in some areas}} than others. Methods. This controlled intervention study was designed, implemented and evaluated using principles from action research methodology. We theoretically sampled 14 health professionals with varying levels of involvement and 12 consented to be interviewed. We analysed data from 266 group diaries kept by health professionals, 31 group observations, 10 audio-recorded steering group meetings and field notes. Women's perspectives were obtained by analysing qualitative data from one focus group, 21 semi-structured qualitative interviews and responses to open-survey questions. Results. The intervention was more <b>effective</b> at improving <b>breastfeeding</b> rates in areas where health visitors and midwives were committed to working together to implement the intervention, where health professionals shared group facilitation and where inter- and intra-professional relationships were strong. The area where the intervention was ineffective had continuity of a single group facilitator with breastfeeding expertise and problematic relationships within and between midwife and health visitor teams. No one style of group suited all women. Some preferred hearing different views, others valued continuity of help from a facilitator with breastfeeding expertise. Conclusions.

40|$|Background Breastfeeding is {{beneficial}} to infant and child health, woman health and society. Breastfeeding is promoted by various strategies in Hong Kong. Although the breastfeeding initiation rate is increasing, the exclusive breastfeeding rate at 4 - 6 months remains low in Hong Kong. The current policy and interventions are not <b>effective</b> on promoting <b>breastfeeding</b> and addressing {{the needs of}} mothers. Aims This systematic review aimed to identify effective interventions to promote breastfeeding initiation, duration and exclusivity and their implications to future change of guidelines or policies in breastfeeding promotion. Method Studies were searched through PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to 13 thMay, 2013. Grey literature was searched. English publications with full text, experimental or quasi-experimental design, using World Health Organization definitions of breastfeeding classification, targeting to healthy mothers and infants were selected. Quality assessment was done using Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials and Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies by Effective Public Health Practice Project. Result Twenty studies were included in this review. The Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative was found to be the most effective strategy to promote breastfeeding duration and exclusivity. Home visit by peer counselor, a face-to-face intervention, was another effective strategy to increase initiation, duration and exclusivity of breastfeeding. The sole use of educational materials was not <b>effective,</b> but professional <b>breastfeeding</b> support combined with use of educational materials was shown to be effective on lengthening the duration of exclusive and predominant breastfeeding. The evidence of antenatal education programme was not convincing. The inclusion of father with breastfeeding promotion intervention was attempted but the evidence is less strong. The exclusion of infant formula advertisement in the educational package to mothers was <b>effective</b> on increasing <b>breastfeeding</b> rate only before hospital discharge. Findings on professional support interventions were inconsistent. Conclusion The Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative and home visit peer support are <b>effective</b> on promoting <b>breastfeeding</b> duration and exclusivity. Evidence for other strategies was limited due to low methodological quality and/or inconsistent findings. Future research should be conducted to investigate and identify suitable strategies that are applicable to local setting. published_or_final_versionPublic HealthMasterMaster of Public Healt...|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} decade, {{biological}} nurturing and activation of maternal and infant instincts after birth have constituted a major advance in clinical breastfeeding support. Yet, physiologic breastfeeding initiation {{is not enough}} to ensure ongoing pain-free and <b>effective</b> <b>breastfeeding</b> for many pairs. Current interventions, including “hands-off” mammalian approaches, do not improve breastfeeding outcomes, including in randomized controlled trials. Back-arching, difficulty latching or staying on the breast, and fussing at the breast are common signs of infant positional instability during breastfeeding. These cues are, however, often misdiagnosed as signs of medical conditions or oral connective tissue abnormalities, and underlying positional instability is not addressed. New clinical approaches are urgently required. This article offers a clinical approach to fit and hold (or latch and positioning) —gestalt breastfeeding, which aims to optimize positional stability and intraoral breast tissue volumes for pain-free <b>effective</b> <b>breastfeeding.</b> The word gestalt (pronounced “ger-shtolt”) means a whole that is {{more than the sum of}} its parts. Gestalt breastfeeding builds on the theoretical foundations of complexity science, physiologic breastfeeding initiation, and new understandings of the biomechanics of infant suck elucidated in ultrasound studies. It also integrates simple psychological strategies from applied functional contextualism, popularly known as Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, empowering women to attend mindfully to breast sensations and their infant’s cues. Gestalt breastfeeding can be reproduced for research purposes, including in comparison studies with oral surgery, and has the potential to improve breastfeeding outcomes.

40|$|Positioning and {{attachment}} of {{an infant}} at the breast for effective feeding prevents common breastfeeding problems such as nipple pain and breast engorgement. Existing tools to assess breastfeeding remain controversial. This paper reports on an observation study of 91 mother-baby dyads who were breastfeeding while in hospital. The 'Postnatal Breastfeeding Observation Tool' (PBOT) records maternal independence to breastfeed effectively prior to discharge from hospital. PBOT items relate to maternal nurturing, positioning, attachment, effective feeding and assistance received. Items were developed from a critical review of the literature, best available evidence, and reviewed by an expert panel of clinical midwives and International Board Certified Lactation Consultants. Validity was established in a pilot study with three midwives who observed seven mothers breastfeed. Intraclass correlation of scores between the three midwives who all observed seven individual mothers breastfeed were high 0. 895 (p < 0. 001). Results confirmed associations between mothers' positioning their baby for attachment to the breast (r = 0. 635, p< 0. 001) and <b>effective</b> <b>breastfeeding</b> (r = 0. 474, p< 0. 001) and between attachment and <b>effective</b> <b>breastfeeding</b> (r = 0. 427, p< 0. 001).

40|$|Abstract Background Despite the {{importance}} of multiple psychosocial factors on nutrition-related behavior, very few studies have explored beyond the role of mothers’ knowledge and perception of child-focused outcomes on the duration of exclusive breastfeeding in Africa. Our objective {{was to determine the}} relationships among mothers’ knowledge, outcome expectancies, normative beliefs, and cessation of exclusive breastfeeding in rural Kenya. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 400 mothers of children, 0 - 24 months old, in rural Kenya. Early child-feeding practices, knowledge of breastfeeding recommendations, beliefs associated with impact of exclusive breastfeeding on child- and mother-focused outcomes and perception of acceptability of exclusive breastfeeding by important others were examined. Cox regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between independent variables of interest and cessation of exclusive breastfeeding. Results Being knowledgeable of breastfeeding-related recommendations, positive beliefs on the impact of exclusive breastfeeding on child- focused outcomes, having a more positive perception of the impact of exclusive breastfeeding on mother-focused outcomes and a more positive perception of acceptability of exclusive breastfeeding by important others were associated with significantly lower risks of premature cessation of exclusive breastfeeding. Conclusion In addition to knowledge levels, mothers’ beliefs {{play an important role in}} mothers’ decisions to practice exclusive breastfeeding. Mother’s beliefs on the impact of exclusive breastfeeding on the mother’s health, physical appearance and ability to engage in other activities were shown to have the strongest relationship with premature cessation of exclusive breastfeeding.

Babies of primiparous mothers took significantly longer than babies of multiparous mothers in all groups. A number of possible explanations are advanced for this result. [...] Delay in initiation of breastfeeding has potentially deleterious effects on both mother and baby. From the results of the study a number of suggestions for further nursing research, practice and education are put forward...|$|E
40|$|The authors tested {{indicators}} of <b>effective</b> <b>breastfeeding</b> {{to identify those}} that provide reliable estimates of human milk intake. Human milk intake of 82 full-term infants was measured by test weights before and after feeding and compared with commonly used breastfeeding indi-cators: rooting, length of time before latch-on, latch-on, suckle, observable swallowing, and audible swallowing. Two models were tested: model 1, describing indicators at 96 hours postpartum, and model 2, describing indicators at> 96 hours postpartum. Median (interquartile) milliliters of mother’s milk consumed per feeding was 26 ml (range, 4 - 47) at 96 hours and 54 ml (range, 26 - 73) at> 96 hours. Significant predictors of human milk intake in model 1 were rooting and observable swallowing (R 2 = 26 %, P <. 01). In model 2, audible swallowing alone estimated human milk intake (R 2 = 29 %, P <. 001). Observed swallowing and rooting during the first 4 days (96 hours) following birth and audible swallowing after that time {{should be included in}} the breastfeeding assessment of full-term infants.

40|$|Infant feeding is {{a complex}} {{behavior}} enacted in a risk adverse society. Despite ongoing communication and education strategies, breastfeeding rates in countries like Australia, the United States, and the United Kingdom remain static, thus increasing the risk of short- and long-term health problems. Health professionals and nonprofit organizations recognize social marketing as an appropriate strategy for increasing breastfeeding duration since it addresses the shortfalls of education-only campaigns. Technology, as an innovative alternative to mass media and education, {{has the potential to}} reduce the social price of breastfeeding by assisting women to manage the identity and health risks associated with infant feeding. This article reports findings from six focus groups that explored the risks associated with breastfeeding and the potential role of technology in ameliorating these risks. A key finding of this research was that technology has the potential to negate the impact of perceived uncertainty and lack of control associated with breastfeeding. The results indicate that future breastfeeding campaigns that are innovative in their approach and use technology may be more <b>effective</b> in changing <b>breastfeeding</b> behavior...|$|R

To examine {{the association of}} self-efficacy, perception of milk production, and lactating women’s use of medication prescribed to increase breast milk in a cohort of 18 – 40 -year-old mothers over six months. Methods. Mothers (n = 76) attending community clinics completed the Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale and the Humenick/Hill Lactation Scale, a measure of perceived milk production, three times. Results. Domperidone, a dopamine antagonist, was used by 28 % of participants. On average, those using domperidone had lower self-efficacy scores than those not using it (P < 0. 05) andweremorelikelytohaveusedformula (Pearson chi-square test statistic = 6. 87, df = 1, P< 0. 05). Breastfeeding self efficacy and perception of milk production were positively correlated. Conclusion. Breastfeeding assessment conducted prior to prescription of galactogogues is recommended for mothers and healthy term babies. Following Baby-Friendly hospital protocols and increasing self-efficacy for lactating women may be most <b>effective</b> in sustaining <b>breastfeeding.</b> Risks and benefits of various galactogogues are discussed. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this pilot study was to compare two different methods of educating prenatal women regarding breast-feeding. Comparisons were made between traditional and innovative methods to determine which was more <b>effective</b> in increasing <b>breastfeeding</b> duration. Over a 32 month period, 197 prenatal women were assigned to either a control (C, n = 139) or an experimental (E, n = 51) group. The C group received standard breastfeeding education, while the E group received standard education in addition to information about infant hunger cues. Cox Regression and Kap-lan- Meier analysis were performed. Estimated mean number of weeks for C and E groups to continue breastfeeding was 14. 3 + 17. 4 weeks and 18. 5 + 17. 1 weeks, respectively. At 26 weeks, duration of breastfeeding approached significance (chi square = 2. 907, df = 1, p = 0. 088), indicating probability of continuing to breastfeed was about 28 % better for those in E group when compared to C group. Duration of breastfeeding may increase when prenatal women are taught to identify infant behavior such as hunger cues...|$|R
