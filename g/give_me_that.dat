500|$|After Carey {{finished}} {{writing and}} producing the track alongside Williams, Dogg added his rap verse, and added some ulterior beats and components. Before taking the still-uncompleted song to the studio, Dogg described {{the song and}} beat [...] "The beat was just sick and it was bangin'. I was like, 'All right, <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>that,</b> M.C.' I took [...] down to my studio and flipped my style to it." [...] After slightly altering the song, as well as adding his verses, Dogg met with Carey once again for her approval on the song, [...] "When I played [...] for her, she was like, 'Oh, I love it!' I said, 'OK, give me a hug, baby.' She was just as soft as a cotton swab! Lord have mercy! Jesus, M.C.! What I wouldn't ... Let me stop." ...|$|E
500|$|Winchilsea {{and about}} 150 other {{contributors}} withdrew {{their support of}} King's College London in response to Wellington's support of Catholic emancipation. In a letter to Wellington he accused the Duke to have in mind [...] "insidious designs for the infringement of our liberty {{and the introduction of}} Popery into every department of the State". The letter provoked a furious exchange of correspondence and Wellington accused Winchilsea of imputing him with [...] "disgraceful and criminal motives" [...] in setting up King's College London. When Winchilsea refused to retract the remarks, Wellington – by his own admission, [...] "no advocate of duelling" [...] and a virgin duellist – demanded satisfaction in a contest of arms: [...] "I now call upon your lordship to <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> satisfaction for your conduct which a gentleman has a right to require, and which a gentleman never refuses to give." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{title track}} is a soca-pop song, and blends horns and {{background}} vocals with ukulele folk-pop and island percussion {{morphed into a}} programmed beat. It contains handclaps and subtle modern sound effects. Trainor uses an assertive throwback aural tone on the song. The rap verse in [...] "Title" [...] was compared to the works of Australian rapper Iggy Azalea and American duo Karmin. The song's lyrics see Trainor demanding her lover to put a name on their relationship status. It was described by the singer as [...] "call me your girlfriend, I'm sick of being your boo thing, so call me your girlfriend and <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> title". Musically, Trainor felt the song showcased what her artistic style was about, and said, [...] "I loved that 'Title' showed a little Caribbean drum before the chorus and then, like, a rap bridge that was, like… totally different sound." [...] Christina Garibaldi of MTV News wrote that the song serves a lesson for women not {{to settle for a}} friends-with-benefits relationship.|$|E

500|$|The {{day that}} a new poll showed McCain five points ahead in the state, Bush allied himself on stage with a {{marginal}} and controversial veterans activist named J. Thomas Burch, who accused McCain of having [...] "abandoned the veterans" [...] on POW/MIA and Agent Orange issues: [...] "He came home from Vietnam and forgot us." [...] Incensed, McCain ran ads accusing Bush of lying and comparing the governor to Bill Clinton, which Bush complained was [...] "about as low a blow as you can give in a Republican primary and many Republicans thought comparing Bush's truthfulness to Bill Clinton's dishonesty was distasteful smear by McCain." [...] An unidentified party began a semi-underground smear campaign against McCain, delivered by push polls, faxes, e-mails, flyers, audience plants, and the like. [...] These claimed most famously that he had fathered a black child out of wedlock (the McCains' dark-skinned daughter Bridget was adopted from Bangladesh; this misrepresentation {{was thought to be}} an especially effective slur in a Deep South state where race was still central), but also that his wife Cindy was a drug addict, that he was a homosexual, and that he was a [...] "Manchurian Candidate" [...] traitor or mentally unstable from his North Vietnam POW days. [...] The Bush campaign strongly denied any involvement with these attacks; Bush said he would fire anyone who ran defamatory push polls. During a break in a debate, Bush put his hand on McCain's arm and reiterated that he had no involvement in the attacks; McCain replied, [...] "Don't <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> shit. And take your hands off me." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 1946 Christmas episode, for example, Benny buys {{shoelaces}} for Don, and {{is unable}} to {{make up his mind}} whether to give Wilson shoelaces with plastic tips or metal tips. After exchanging them repeatedly, Mel Blanc is heard screaming insanely, [...] "Plastic tips! Metal tips! I can't stand it anymore!" [...] A variation in 1948 was with an expensive wallet, but repeatedly changing the greeting card, prompting Blanc to shout, [...] "I haven't run into anyone like you in 20 years! Oh, why did the governor have to <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> pardon!?" [...] Benny then realizes that he should have gotten Don a wallet for $1.98, whereupon the store clerk responds by committing suicide. Over the years, in the Christmas episodes, Benny bought and repeatedly exchanged cuff links, golf tees, a box of dates, a paint set (water colors or oils), and a gopher trap. In later years, Benny would encounter Mel Blanc's wife (played by Jean Vander Pyl) or the clerk's psychiatrist at the store, and drive them crazy as well.|$|E
2500|$|Then Vishnu, the omniscient {{director}} of the cosmic game, staged a small comedy. He transformed Nandi (the bull of Shiva) into a dancing bull and conducted {{him in front of}} Gajasura, assuming, at the same time, the appearance of a flutist. The enchanting performance of the bull sent the demon into ecstasies, and he asked the flutist to tell him what he desired. The musical Vishnu responded: [...] "Can you <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> which I ask?" [...] Gajasura replied: [...] "Who do you take me for? I can immediately give you whatever you ask." [...] The flutist then said: [...] "If that's so, liberate Shiva from your stomach." [...] Gajasura understood then that this must have been no other than Vishnu himself, {{the only one who could}} have known that secret and he threw himself at his feet. Having agreed to liberate Shiva, Gajasura asks him for two last gifts: [...] "I have been blessed by you with many gifts; my last requests are that everyone should remember me adoring my head and you should wear my skin." ...|$|E

2500|$|Prince of Wales raised {{anchor and}} {{returned}} to sea, sailing aimlessly north and east {{in the hope of}} finding a more hospitable village from which to seek a guide. Shortly after midnight on 22 January she collided with a Chinese ship, striking the Chinese vessel amidships and crushing her under Prince of Wales bow. The English vessel suffered damage to her hull and the loss of her jib-boom, which fell over the side into the Chinese vessel. The smaller Chinese craft was more heavily damaged and began to sink, her crew scrambling overboard to avoid being dragged down with her. Several Chinese sailors sought to climb aboard Prince of Wales, panicking Milner's crew. Paine recorded in his journal that [...] "the Alarm caused me to jump from my cot and run to the arms chest, but such was the call for cutlasses that {{it was not until the}} third or fourth attempt I could reach the deck, being accosted each time in the companionway with [...] "O <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> cutlass sir, and get another for they are coming on board." ...|$|E
