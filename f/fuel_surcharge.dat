5|$|The Eastern Upper Peninsula Transportation Authority (EUPTA) {{operates}} the Drummond Island Ferry across the De Tour Passage {{in addition to}} two other ferries and the regional rural bus system for Luce and Chippewa counties. As part of the service between De Tour and Drummond Island, EUPTA operates up to three different vessels: the SS Drummond Islander, SS Drummond Islander III and the SS Drummond Islander IV. , fares start at $12 per car and increase based {{on the size of}} the vehicle transported, including a <b>fuel</b> <b>surcharge.</b> Passenger fares are $2 for adults and $1 for seniors or students; the vehicle driver's fare is included in the vehicle charge. Ferries leave Drummond Island at 10 minutes after the hour, from De Tour at 20 minutes to the hour, and run most of the day; some crossing times are only operated seasonally. M-134 is one of two highways in Michigan to use a ferry connection; the other is US10 between Ludington, Michigan, and Manitowoc, Wisconsin.|$|E

25|$|In July 2007, it was {{reported}} that many taxi drivers were engaged in rampant illegal price-cutting in their competition with call-cab drivers for passengers. Rates offered were up to 20% lower than the metered fares on long-distance trips, with competition being particularly fierce on the airport route. The warring factions took turns to blockade Hong Kong International Airport to air their grievances. Andrew Cheng Kar-foo, chairman of the Legislative Council's transport panel, proposed cutting taxi fares to deal with illicit discounting. Representatives of call-cab drivers and taxi owners were opposed to the idea. Urban taxi groups have been lobbying for permission to impose a HK$1 per trip <b>fuel</b> <b>surcharge</b> when the price of liquefied petroleum gas per litre is between HK$3.10 and HK$4. Legislative Councillors unanimously passed a motion urging the government to allow taxis to impose the surcharge. However, the vote was non-binding on the Government. The Transportation Secretary rejected the appeal.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} car pricing policy based on <b>fuel</b> <b>surcharges</b> in {{substitution}} of car ownership taxes for reducing {{greenhouse gas emissions}} by cars. The aim of the proposed policy is to change some (fixed) costs of car use that are not perceived at each trip into (variable) costs. The amount of <b>fuel</b> <b>surcharges</b> {{and the effects of}} their application on fuel consumption and on GHG emissions are estimated by a model that is able to relate gasoline and diesel consumption with fuel prices. The effects of the proposed policy on fuel consumption and on GHG emissions are estimated for Italy.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the simultaneous optimization problem of <b>fuel</b> <b>surcharges</b> and transit service runs for energy sustainability of multimodal transport network using a time-dependent activity-based approach. To model commuters' choices of trip chain, travel mode, departure time, route, and activity timing and duration over {{the times of}} a day, a time-dependent activity and multimodal travel choice equilibrium problem is first addressed and formulated as an equivalent variational inequality (VI) problem. A new model for optimizing the <b>fuel</b> <b>surcharges</b> and transit vehicle runs is proposed to maximize the total social net benefit of the multimodal transport system. The proposed model explicitly considers {{the interaction between the}} <b>fuel</b> <b>surcharges</b> and transit service runs and the commuters' activity–travel scheduling behavior. A heuristic solution algorithm is then developed to solve the proposed model. Finally, an illustrative example is given to show the application of the proposed model with various sensitivity tests. Insightful findings are presented with particularly the effects of the <b>fuel</b> <b>surcharges</b> and transit service improvement on the performance of the multimodal transport system in terms of the modal split, fuel consumption, and total social net benefit.

25|$|Taxi fares in Dallas {{compared}} to other large U.S. cities is very reasonable. The meter rate is $2.25 plus 20¢ every 1/9 mile. Additional passengers or pets (excluding service animals) are $2 extra, each. Also, fares {{to and from the}} two principal airports (DFW International Airport and Dallas Love Field) to Downtown Dallas and the Dallas Market Center area are set at a flat rate. Those rates are: $41 for DFW to or from Downtown Dallas, $18 to or from Dallas Love Field to Downtown, and $32 to or from DFW International to Dallas Market Center. Be advised: a <b>fuel</b> <b>surcharge</b> may also be added to fares if gas prices reach $2.50 per gallon or more for three consecutive weeks. In an April 2011 study conducted by the Chicago Dispatcher, Dallas taxis charge an estimated $12.75 for a distance of five miles with five minutes wait time. Tipping is not required, but is a good gesture if you receive good service from the driver.|$|E
25|$|Fares to {{and from}} Miami International Airport (MIA) and popular {{destinations}} {{are based on a}} zone system which covers Key Biscayne, Miami Beach and other communities east of the Intracoastal Waterway in Miami-Dade County, Coral Gables, and the Port of Miami, as well as short trips in the airport vicinity. For example, a trip from MIA to South Beach (approximately 11 miles) will cost passengers a flat fare of $32 (as of June 2009), inclusive of tolls and temporary fuel surcharges which rise and fall with fuel costs. An April 2011 study conducted by the Chicago Dispatcher showed that Miami taxis have moderately high fares, charging an estimated $16.10 for a distance of five miles and five minutes wait time (compared to an estimated $14.30 in Hillsborough County, FL and $18.20 in Palm Beach County, FL). Fares outside of these zones (including to Fort Lauderdale and Broward County) are metered; the first 1/6 of a mile costs $2.50, with each additional 1/6 of a mile costing $0.40 (not including any road tolls). An additional $2 surcharge (automatically included in zone fares) applies for trips to MIA or the seaport. As an example, a trip from MIA to Dolphin Mall, a distance of approximately 9.2 miles, would cost a passenger $27.25 (as of June 2009, including a $0.75 road toll and the $2 surcharge). A <b>fuel</b> <b>surcharge</b> may also be added to fares if gas prices reach $3.50 per gallon or more for three consecutive weeks. Tipping is not required, but is expected by most Miami taxicab drivers.|$|E

50|$|To recoup its sharply higher {{fuel costs}} in the Berlin market, the airline imposed a <b>fuel</b> <b>surcharge</b> on all tour {{operators}} that had contracted their flying programme from Berlin to it. The operators passed on this <b>fuel</b> <b>surcharge</b> to their IT passengers. A major disagreement over the <b>fuel</b> <b>surcharge</b> between Modern Air's management and its counterpart at Berliner Flugring, its main overseas business partner, led {{to a reduction in}} the Berlin-based fleet from five to four aircraft for the 1974 summer season. There was a plan to replace the fuel-guzzling CV-990s with more efficient, second-hand McDonnell Douglas DC-8s and DC-9s in time for the 1975 summer season. However, an attempt on Modern Air's part to pass on a further increase in its <b>fuel</b> <b>surcharge</b> to Berliner Flugring for the planned 1974/75 winter flying programme resulted in the tour operator's refusal to renew its long-standing charter contract with the airline. This in turn resulted in the closure of Modern Air's Berlin Tegel base at the end of October 1974. The airline had carried over two million passengers during its seven-year presence in West Berlin, which roughly equated to the city's contemporary population.|$|E

40|$|There {{are several}} annual rail rate indices {{commonly}} used to depict changes in the prices paid for rail service. While accurate for general analyses, each of these indices falls short in capturing the three major components of total railroad grain rates – tariff rates, <b>fuel</b> <b>surcharges,</b> and secondary railcar market costs. Grain is a unique rail commodity whereby bids in the secondary railcar market can affect whether the actual rate paid by shippers is above or below the published tariff rate. The seasonality of rates inherent in grain transportation is captured through the secondary market but is neither contained in other grain rail rate indices nor apparent in annualized data. In addition, most grain rate indices do not include <b>fuel</b> <b>surcharges,</b> which have become {{a major component of}} the total rate paid for any rail commodity movement. In this paper, we improve upon past grain rail rate indices by including information from the secondary rail market, <b>fuel</b> <b>surcharges,</b> and tariff rates into a weekly index between the years 1997 and 2011. The improved index shows a higher level of detail when compared to other annualized indices, allowing for a more thorough analysis of grain rates. This index shows grain rail rates generally higher than do other indices with a notable departure from rail costs {{at the beginning of the}} economic recession in 2009.

40|$|Since 2001, {{the airline}} {{industry}} has been affected {{by a number of}} external shocks, including terrorist attacks, volatile fuel prices, periods of challenging economic times, and an uncertain regulatory environment. In large part because of these factors, the industry has endured years of economic losses—$ 50 billion between 2001 and 2011 —resulting in many bankruptcies and mergers. These losses have led airlines to focus on revenue-management strategies. One important way airlines have generated additional revenue is by adding surcharges and/or increasing ancillary fees for optional services or a la carte pricing. As an example, rather than airlines passing on higher fuel costs in the form of fare increases, <b>fuel</b> <b>surcharges</b> may be less noticeable. Passengers {{may be more likely to}} accept increases in fares if they know that fuel prices and <b>fuel</b> <b>surcharges</b> are rising in tandem.
