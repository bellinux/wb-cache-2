25|$|The <b>greater</b> <b>rhea</b> (Rhea americana) is a flightless bird {{found in}} eastern South America. Other {{names for the}} <b>greater</b> <b>rhea</b> include the grey, common, or American rhea; ñandú (Guaraní and Spanish); or ema (Portuguese). One of two species in the genus Rhea, in the family Rheidae, the <b>greater</b> <b>rhea</b> is endemic to Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. It inhabits a variety of open areas, such as grasslands, savanna or grassy wetlands. Weighing , the <b>greater</b> <b>rhea</b> is the largest bird in South America. In the wild, the <b>greater</b> <b>rhea</b> has a life {{expectancy}} of 10.5 years. It is also notable for its reproductive habits, and {{for the fact that}} a group has established itself in Germany in recent years. The species is listed as Near Threatened by the IUCN.|$|R
25|$|The natural predators {{of adult}} <b>greater</b> <b>rheas</b> {{are limited to}} the cougar (Puma concolor), which are found in most areas {{inhabited}} by <b>greater</b> <b>rheas</b> and are certain to be their leading predator, and the jaguar (Panthera onca), which are found with <b>greater</b> <b>rheas</b> and opportunistically hunt them in the Paraguayan chaco, central Bolivia and the Brazilian cerrado. Feral dogs are known to kill younger birds, and the southern caracara (Caracara plancus) is suspected to prey on hatchlings. Armadillos sometimes feed on <b>greater</b> <b>rhea</b> eggs; nests have been found which had been undermined by a six-banded armadillo (Euphractus sexcinctus) or a big hairy armadillo (Chaetophractus villosus) and the rhea eggs were broken apart. Predation on young rheas has also been reportedly committed by greater grisons (Galictis vittata).|$|R
2500|$|Captive-bred <b>greater</b> <b>rheas</b> exhibit {{significant}} ecological naïvete. This fearlessness renders them highly {{vulnerable to}} predators if {{the birds are}} released into the wild in reintroduction projects. Classical conditioning of <b>greater</b> <b>rhea</b> juveniles against predator models can prevent this to some degree, but the personality type of the birds [...] whether they are bold or shy [...] influences the success of such training. In 2006, a protocol was established for training <b>greater</b> <b>rheas</b> to avoid would-be predators, and for identifying the most cautious animals for release.|$|R
25|$|Farmers {{sometimes}} {{consider the}} <b>greater</b> <b>rhea</b> pests, {{because they will}} eat broad-leaved crop plants, such as cabbage, chard and bok choy. Where they occur as pests, farmers tend to hunt and kill <b>greater</b> <b>rheas.</b> The burning of crops in South America has also contributed to their decline.|$|R

25|$|In {{fields and}} {{plantations}} of plants {{they do not}} like to eat, e.g., cereals or eucalyptus, the <b>greater</b> <b>rhea</b> can be a species quite beneficial to farmers. It will eat any large invertebrate it can catch; its food includes locusts and grasshoppers, true bugs, cockroaches, and other pest insects. Juveniles eat more animal matter than adults. In mixed cerrado and agricultural land in Minas Gerais (Brazil), R. a. americana was noted to be particularly fond of beetles. It is not clear whether this applies to the species in general but for example in pampas habitat, beetle consumption is probably lower simply due to availability while Orthoptera might be more important. The <b>greater</b> <b>rhea</b> is able to eat Hymenoptera in quantity. These insects contain among them many who can give painful stings, though the birds do not seem to mind. Sometimes, <b>greater</b> <b>rheas</b> will gather at carrion to feed on flies; they are also known to eat dead or dying fish in the dry season, but as vertebrate prey in general not in large quantities.|$|R

It is absent from the humid tropical forests of the Mata Atlântica and planalto uplands {{along the coast of}} Brazil and extends south to 40° latitude. They prefer lower elevations and seldom go above [...] During the breeding season (spring and summer), it stays near water.|$|R

5000|$|The rheas [...] {{are large}} ratites (flightless birds without a keel on their sternum bone) {{in the order}} Rheiformes, native to South America, related to the ostrich and emu.
