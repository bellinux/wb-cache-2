50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 19th century, wealthier citizens wanted a new bank to finance vessels, and to serve the town’s fishermen and merchants. On March 17, 1831, with a capital of $100,000, they founded the <b>Grand</b> <b>Bank.</b> The name was changed to National <b>Grand</b> <b>Bank</b> on October 3, 1864.|$|R
50|$|The Town of <b>Grand</b> <b>Bank</b> can {{attribute}} much of {{its past}} and present growth and prosperity to its proximity to the fishing grounds and its ice-free harbour. Original settlers thrived on trade with the French and a vigorous inshore fishing industry. <b>Grand</b> <b>Bank</b> became {{the nucleus of the}} bank fishing industry for Newfoundland and a service centre for Fortune Bay. With the decline of the salt fish industry, the town's emphasis quickly shifted to fresh fish production. Enterprising businessmen and town planners prepared the way for a fresh fish plant (present day <b>Grand</b> <b>Bank</b> Seafoods Inc.) and a fleet of trawlers.|$|R

5|$|Some {{residents}} claim that, {{independent of}} {{the truth of the}} Mussie legend, the legend's origins are older: supposedly, early settler Samuel de Champlain wrote of the creature's existence in the early seventeenth century.

5|$|The 18th century saw {{major changes}} in Newfoundland: {{population}} growth, beginnings of government, establishment of churches, reinforcement of commercial ties with North America {{and development of the}} seal, salmon and <b>Grand</b> <b>Banks</b> fisheries. St. John's population grew slowly. Although it was primarily a fishing station, it was also a garrison, a centre of government and a commercial hub. St. John's served as a naval base during the American Revolutionary War and the War of 1812.|$|E
5|$|Early on {{the morning}} of 15 May U-43 opened fire with her deck gun and {{anti-aircraft}} guns on the 488 ton French three-masted sailing ship Notre Dame du Châtelet, en route from St. Malo to the <b>Grand</b> <b>Banks</b> of Newfoundland to fish. After being hit by 45 shells the ship sank. Lüth suspected that the vessel was reporting the positions of U-boats to Allied forces, while the 10 survivors thought they had been attacked by a British submarine. They, from her crew of 38, abandoned ship in two lifeboats. Two were picked up by the Italian submarine Otaria on 23 May.|$|E

The island also had many seasonal settlements used by fishermen from Europe. These colonists numbered fewer than 2,000 English and 1,000 French permanent settlers (and many more seasonal visitors) who competed with one another for the fisheries of the <b>Grand</b> <b>Banks,</b> which were also used by fishermen from Acadia (then encompassing all of present-day Nova Scotia and New Brunswick) and Massachusetts.|$|E

5|$|After the {{publication}} of his book on the fur trade, Innis turned to a study of an earlier staple—the cod fished for centuries off the eastern coasts of North America, especially the <b>Grand</b> <b>Banks</b> of Newfoundland. The result was The Cod Fisheries: The History of an International Economy published in 1940, 10years after the fur trade study. Innis tells the detailed history of competing empires in the exploitation of a teeming natural resource—a history that ranges over 500years. While his study of the fur trade focused on the continental interior with its interlocking rivers and lakes, The Cod Fisheries looks outward at global trade and empire, showing the far-reaching effects of one staple product both on imperial centres and on marginal colonies such as Newfoundland, Nova Scotia and New England.|$|E
5|$|In Nova Scotia, Able {{produced}} hurricane-force winds, {{the only}} land along its path to receive such winds; {{a gust of}} 99mph (160km/h) was reported in Halifax. The hurricane also dropped heavy rainfall, including over 4.92inches (125mm) in Annapolis Valley. Initially there were three fishing boats missing throughout the region, although two later returned to harbor. By August22, the third was still missing over the <b>Grand</b> <b>Banks,</b> which prompted a rescue team {{to search for the}} boat. Many other boats crashed against the coast, and two children died when their raft capsized. Two bridges and several roadways were washed out or flooded, and in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, floodwaters left roadways impassable. On land, Able produced heavy damage estimated at over $1million (CAD), half of which in Annapolis Valley, and split between crops, communications, and fishing industries.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>Grand</b> <b>Banks</b> of Canada, {{the threat}} of the {{hurricane}} prompted fishing boats to venture back to port. In the Bay of Fundy, foggy conditions drove an ocean liner aground. Across Nova Scotia, rough seas washed a boat near Dartmouth, a schooner near Halifax, four yachts in Chester, and another three boats in Shelburne ashore. In addition, eleven yachts in Chester sank during the storm. The seas flooded a coastal road and nearby field in Prospect, destroying a garage. In Cow Bay, a man drowned after falling off of a yacht. Rough seas halted ferry service between Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia, as well as between Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick; other ferry service across the region were delayed.|$|E

5|$|Late in its duration, Gert passed just {{southeast}} of Newfoundland before becoming extratropical, producing wave heights of 77.4ft (23.6m) offshore and 30ft (9m) onshore. In St. Bride's along the Avalon Peninsula, a large wave severely damaged a wharf, destroying five boats and damaging 45 others. Along the wharf, a wave swept three {{people into the}} ocean, hospitalizing one of them. The wharf required $2million (1999CAD, $1.9million 1999USD) in repairs, forcing its closure. Further west, high waves damaged a fish plant in Lord's Cove. Gale-force winds extended across southeastern Newfoundland, and in the <b>Grand</b> <b>Banks</b> a station reported winds of 74mph (120km/h). Onshore, the winds downed trees and caused power outages, primarily in the St. John's area. In addition, the adverse conditions from Gert prompted the cancellation of flights to and from St. John's International Airport.|$|E
5|$|Early European (primarily from England, Ireland and France) {{settlement}} in Newfoundland {{was confined to}} the coast. The rich cod fishery on the <b>Grand</b> <b>Banks</b> and along {{the shore of the}} island was the primary reason for these settlements. The rugged shoreline provided many small, but isolated, harbors (outports) from which to conduct the fishery. The Avalon Peninsula was, and is, the most populous part of the island, and as such had the best developed system of early roads and trails. Transportation between communities on other parts of the coast, especially the south coast between Fortune Bay and Port aux Basques, was exclusively by boat. Almost all communities are now accessible by roads which are part of the provincial road system. The now-defunct Newfoundland Railway, built {{in the latter part of}} the 19th century, and the development of the lead, zinc and copper mine at Buchans and the paper mill in Grand Falls in the early 20th century marked the beginning of the settlement of the interior of the island. Despite these developments the majority of the population is still found along the coast.|$|E

There, he captured a French (or Portuguese—sources differ) pink, a narrow-sterned former man of war, which Low rearmed and refitted as his new flagship, naming it the Rose Pink. He also captured an English vessel with two Portuguese passengers aboard. Low had his crew hoist them up and drop them back down from the yard arm several times, until they died. He {{moved on to the}} Canaries, Cape Verde and then back across to the coast of Brazil, where he was driven back by foul weather.|$|E
