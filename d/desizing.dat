25|$|Scouring, is a {{chemical}} washing process {{carried out on}} cotton fabric to remove natural wax and non-fibrous impurities (e.g. the remains of seed fragments) from the fibres and any added soiling or dirt. Scouring is usually carried in iron vessels called kiers. The fabric is boiled in an alkali, which forms a soap with free fatty acids (saponification). A kier is usually enclosed, so the solution of sodium hydroxide can be boiled under pressure, excluding oxygen which would degrade the cellulose in the fibre. If the appropriate reagents are used, scouring will also remove size from the fabric although <b>desizing</b> often precedes scouring and {{is considered to be}} a separate process known as fabric preparation. Preparation and scouring are prerequisites to most of the other finishing processes. At this stage even the most naturally white cotton fibres are yellowish, and bleaching, the next process, is required.|$|E

40|$|International audienceSingle fiber {{fragmentation}} {{tests were}} carried out to measure {{the properties of the}} fiber-matrix interface in several carbon fiber (CFs) /epoxy composite systems. Four kinds of CFs were studied: (1) primary CFs (used as received); (2) <b>desized</b> CFs (sizing removed through thermal treatment); (3) resized CFs (deposited with epoxy sizing by solution); (4) carbon nanotube (CNT) -grafted CFs (grown with CNTs using a chemical vapour deposition method). The interfacial shear strength decreased by around 30 % for the <b>desized</b> CFs and the CNT-grafted CFs compared with the pristine CFs. The value of interfacial shear strength for the resized CFs was 20 % larger than that of the <b>desized</b> CFs.

40|$|To {{increase}} {{performance and}} durability of high-temperature composite for potential rocket engine components, {{it is necessary}} to optimize wetting and interfacial bonding between high modulus carbon fibers and high-temperature polyimide resins. Sizing commercially supplied on most carbon fiber are not compatible with polyimides. In this study, the chemistry of sizing on two high modulus carbon fiber (M 40 J and M 60 J, Tiray) was characterized. A continuous desizling system that uses an environmentally friendly chemical-mechanical process was developed for tow level fiber. Composites were fabricated with fibers containing the manufacturer's sizing, <b>desized,</b> and further treated with a reactive finish. Results of room-temperature tests after thermal aging show that the reactive finish produces a higher strength and more durable interface compared to the manufacturer's sizing. When exposed to moisture blistering tests, however, the butter bonded composite displayed a tendency to delaminate, presumably due to trapping of volatiles...|$|R

These enzymes in ready to use form, were applied in different concentrations with varying parameters like time and mechanical agitation. The two denim fabrics as mentioned were of different colours and enzymatic fading action was supposed to differ from fabric to fabric. The enzymes were applied at concentrations of 0.5, 1.25 and 2 % and treatment time was 30, 45 and 60  min for acid enzyme while it was 60, 75 and 90  min for the neutral cellulase. <b>Desized</b> samples were given the treatment in Infra red dyeing machine with required number of steel balls. An MLR of 1 : 30 was maintained while pH of the bath was adjusted with acetic acid.

30|$|The {{proposed}} sustainable pre-treatment {{process was}} highly efficient in conserving water, energy and process chemicals. When the scouring and bleaching process baths were recycled, 36  % excess utilisation of alkali in the scouring process was observed {{when compared with}} the conventional process whereas in bleaching, 30  % excess usage of alkali and 25.6  % of that of hydrogen peroxide was seen. The fabric properties after recycling remained unchanged. When the scouring and bleaching process water containing unexhausted alkali and hydrogen peroxide was reused to <b>desize</b> a new grey fabric, there was a 10 -fold increase in absorbency and 2.7 times increase in whiteness index. Considering the economical perspective, for processing 1  ton fabric/day, there was a saving of 83  % water, 74  % energy and 101542 INR. By properly understanding the potential of waste stream, we can generate new resources of water and chemicals. This will reduce the intake of fresh water and minimise the load on the effluent treatment plant.|$|R
