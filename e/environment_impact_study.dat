40|$|Gaussian air {{dispersion}} {{models are}} widely used for short-range pollutant dispersion study. In Hong Kong, ISC, an old-generation model is recommended in the <b>environment</b> <b>impact</b> <b>study</b> while there is advance generation of models grown in much interest in environmental field. The objective {{of this study is}} to investigate how Gaussian air dispersion models perform under Hong Kong scenario in order to find out which model would be the best candidate for replacement and at the same time provide some guidelines on applying Gaussian air dispersion models. In this study, four Gaussian air dispersion models, namely ISC 3, AUSPLUME (two old- generation models), AERMOD and ADMS (two advance models) are examined under Hong Kong meteorological conditions in two cases of study, one is the Hong Kong International Airport and the other one is the Castle Peak power plant. The results showed that these four models never agreed in the modeling results, due to various implementations of the dispersion equation and the meteorological processor. Advance models are preferred to the old ones due to better meteorological sense, discrete P-G stability class vs. continuous stability. Between the advance ones, ADMS is recommended over AERMOD due to several reasons. Firstly stability parameter estimated by ADMS’ meteorological pre-processor matched better with the observed stability than the one by AERMOD’s meteorological pre-processor, which is a crucial parameter in determining the dispersion parameters. Secondly, ADMS provides more functionality in modeling dispersion in urban region for instance setting minimum M-O length and street canyon model...|$|E

The DSSAT and SALUS models long term seasonal and rotational simulations, were carried out to evaluate the effects of manure and slurry application on soil N and N leaching for the study period (2007 - 2008) {{and for a long}} term (50 years) weather record and to determine the management strategies that reduce the risk of nitrates contamination maintaining a sustainable production. The simulation results show that inappropriate agronomic management strategies, even when the initial soil N content is low, could allow to reach extremely high values of soil N content and N leaching. Irrigation volumes and scheduling based on the plant extractable soil water and a N fertilization based on crops uptake made possible to reach an adequate biomass production reducing significantly the N leached into the soil profile, even when organic fertilizers are used. Simulation models can support the selection of management options that allow to decrease environmental pollution and the use of improper amount of management inputs and consequently to achieve an ecological improvement for the ecosystem and an economical return...|$|R

The proposal is to replace the surface reservoir with three underground reservoirs beneath it to store [...] of water. The underground structures are proposed to be covered initially with soil and then covered over with local vegetation. Hiking trails are also proposed {{to pass through the}} filled up area as a recreational activity to trek the canyon. The objective of this project is basically to follow the regulations set under the Federal Laws for uncovered reservoirs. The lower reservoir has already been decommissioned for regular use but with provision to address emergency situations with a small water treatment plant built to handle such a situation. In case of fire emergency it is planned that the lower reservoir which has enough storage could provide firefighting requirements. The security aspect is also suitable addressed with the project of transferring water under the Stone Canyon Water Quality Improvement Project.

40|$|An {{accurate}} {{estimate of}} nitrate (NO 3 –N) leaching from agricultural land {{is critical to}} <b>environment</b> <b>impact</b> <b>studies.</b> Although NO 3 –N are almost always present in groundwater, their continued increase in managed agricultural land can lead to nitrate concentrations in groundwater above acceptable human health standards. The amount of NO 3 –N leached {{during the growing season}} may be minimal compared to leaching losses that occur between the harvest of one crop and the planting of the next. In this study we compared the effect of inorganic N and raw and composted animal manure on crop productivity and N leaching under field conditions in a maize–alfalfa system using undisturbed drainage lysimeters in Michigan. The cropping system rotation consisted of 3 years of continuous maize (Zea mays L.) and 3 years of continuous alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.). One cropping system consisted of a maize crop grown in the 1994 – 1996 seasons and alfalfa in the 1997 – 1999 seasons. The other cropping system was alfalfa (1994 – 1996) then maize (1997 – 1999). Four N treatments were imposed on the cropping systems. Treatment 1 was a check, no N fertilizer; Treatment 2 was manure; Treatment 3 was compost; Treatment 4 was inorganic fertilizer. No significant differences in yields of maize and alfalfa were found between N treatments in the 6 -year rotation, although the no N treatment in maize had consistently lower yields. The highest amount of NO 3 –N leaching was measured in the manure treatment with a mean annual value of 55 kg NO 3 –N ha 1 in maize–alfalfa rotation and 59 kg NO 3 –N ha 1 in alfalfa– maize, followed by compost (35 kg NO 3 –N ha 1 in alfalfa–maize and 30 kg NO 3 –N ha 1 in maize–alfalfa), inorganic N (33 kg NO 3 –N ha 1 in alfalfa–maize and 25 kg NO 3 –N ha 1 in maize–alfalfa) and no N (27 kg NO 3 –N ha 1 in alfalfa–maize and 25 kg NO 3 –N ha 1 in maize–alfalfa). The highest rates of NO 3 –N losses were also observed in the manure treatment with a mean value for the 6 -year rotation of 0. 14 kg NO 3 –N mm 1 in alfalfa–maize and 0. 35 kg NO 3 –N mm 1 in maize–alfalfa...|$|R
40|$|Estimation of nitrate {{leaching}} from agricultural systems {{is critical to}} <b>environment</b> <b>impact</b> <b>studies.</b> Simulation models can help to assess and understand the dynamics of nitrates in the soil and in relation to fertilizer types and agronomical management. The main hypothesis {{of this study was}} that the long term annual application of mineral and organic N fertilizers, in irrigated sandy soil areas increases dramatically the quantity of NO 3 − in the soil for potential {{nitrate leaching}}. The main objectives of this research were then to quantify inorganic N concentration in soil layers affected by mineral and organic N (manure and slurry) fertilizers; and to test the SALUS crop simulation model to identify the best N management strategy able to minimize NO 3 − leaching without compromising crop growth and yields. A first set of rotational simulations were carried out for the 2007 and 2008 experiments, with the goal of comparing measured and simulated results. A second set of rotational simulations were carried out for a long term assessment (50 years) of the two treatments in comparisons. Additional long term rotational simulation runs were carried out considering two different fertilization strategies based on the maize crop uptake in 2007 (276 kg N ha − 1) and on the PUA (“Best Nitrogen Management with manures”) which defines the fertilization practices adopted in the nitrate vulnerable zones (no more than 170 kg N ha − 1 year − 1). Measured data showed that in the manure treatment, the highest nitrate-N concentration was 627. 3 mg kg− 1 at 0. 10 m depth on August 2008, while the lowest was 2. 50 mg kg − 1 at 1. 40 m depth on July 2007. In the slurry treatment, the maximum nitrate N concentration was 344. 6 mg kg − 1 at 0. 10 m depth on August 2008 and the minimum was 8. 9 mg kg − 1 at 0. 60 cm depth on September 2007. The model was able to closely reproduce the measured results. The simulation results of the inorganic soil N were 1228 kg ha − 1 and 1370 kg ha − 1 for the manure and slurry treatment resperespectively versus the measured soil inorganic N content {{at the beginning of the}} experiment of 1267 kg ha − 1 for the manure treatment and 1323 kg ha − 1 for the slurry treatment. The simulated cumulative amount of nitrate leaching was 9251 kg ha− 1 for the manure treatment and 11, 101 kg ha − 1 for the slurry treatment for the 50 years simulations. The simulations results also showed that when the inorganic N was used alone, the amount of leaching and soil N were significantly reduced...|$|R

Cu powder {{extrusion}} {{developed in}} this work is aimed to be a pilot processing technique to plausibly replace conventional metal extrusion, which is higher in energy consumption and hence causes negative <b>environment</b> <b>impact.</b> In this <b>study,</b> both spherical- and irregular-shape Cu powders were used. 5 different binder formulae comprising low density polyethylene (LDPE); paraffin wax; and stearic acid of 25 : 70 : 5, 30 : 65 : 5, 35 : 60 : 5, 40 : 55 : 5 and 45 : 50 : 5 by weight were studied. Wettability between the binders and Cu powder of all formulae observed by naked eye appeared to be satisfactory. The binders were then mixed with 60 % by volume of Cu powder. Rheological properties, observed using a capillary rheometer with 2 mm diameter orifice at 95 °C, determined that the last 2 formulae gave sufficient green strength in the extrudate. However, only the latter binder formula gave extrudate with smooth surface. Downward extrusion with 45 cm distance from the die gave straight extrudates and no any distortion or warpage was found. Solvent debinding conditions using hexane at 40, 50 and 60 °C were studied. The debinding at 50 °C was the most effective in dissolving the binder and ensured that the Cu powder remained intact.
