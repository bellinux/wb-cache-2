40|$|AbstractThe {{exposure}} to radon (222 Rn and 220 Rn) <b>decay</b> <b>products</b> {{is of great}} concern both in dwellings and workplaces. The model to estimate the lung dose refers to the deposition mechanisms and particle sizes. Unfortunately, most of the dose data available {{are based on the}} measurement of radon concentration and the concentration of radon <b>decay</b> <b>products.</b> These combined measurements are widely used {{in spite of the fact}} that accurate dose assessments require information on the particle deposition mechanisms and the spatial distribution of radon <b>decay</b> <b>products</b> indoors. Most of the airborne particles and/or radon <b>decay</b> <b>products</b> are deposited onto indoor surfaces, which deposition makes the radon <b>decay</b> <b>products</b> unavailable for inhalation. These deposition processes, if properly known, could be successfully exploited to reduce the {{exposure to}} radon <b>decay</b> <b>products.</b> In spite of the importance of the surface deposition of the radon <b>decay</b> <b>products,</b> both for the correct evaluation of the dose and for reducing the exposure, little or no efforts have been made to investigate these deposition processes. Recently, two parallel investigations have been carried out in Rome and at Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM) in Mexico City respectively, which address the issue of the surface-deposited radon <b>decay</b> <b>products.</b> Even though these investigations have been carried independently, they complement one another.

50|$|The {{kinematics}} of a three-body decay can {{be completely}} described using two variables. In a traditional Dalitz plot, the axes {{of the plot}} are the squares of the invariant masses of two pairs of the <b>decay</b> <b>products.</b> (For example, if particle A decays to particles 1, 2, and 3, a Dalitz plot for this decay could plot m212 on the x-axis and m223 on the y-axis.) If there are no angular correlations between the <b>decay</b> <b>products</b> then the distribution of these variables is flat. However symmetries may impose certain restrictions on the distribution. Furthermore, three-body decays are often dominated by resonant processes, in which the particle decays into two <b>decay</b> <b>products,</b> {{with one of those}} <b>decay</b> <b>products</b> immediately <b>decaying</b> into two additional <b>decay</b> <b>products.</b> In this case, the Dalitz plot will show a non-uniform distribution, with a peak around the mass of the resonant decay.

One gram of uranium (in radioactive equilibrium) contains only 2 gram of 227Ac. Actinium-228 is a member of the radioactive thorium series formed by the decay of 228Ra; it is a β− emitter with a half-life of 6.15 hours. In one tonne of thorium there is 5 gram of 228Ac.

5|$|Because xenon is a tracer for two parent isotopes, xenon isotope ratios in meteorites are a {{powerful}} tool for studying the formation of the Solar System. The iodine–xenon method of dating gives the time elapsed between nucleosynthesis and the condensation of a solid object from the solar nebula. In 1960, physicist John H. Reynolds discovered that certain meteorites contained an isotopic anomaly {{in the form of an}} overabundance of xenon-129. He inferred that this was a <b>decay</b> <b>product</b> of radioactive iodine-129. This isotope is produced slowly by cosmic ray spallation and nuclear fission, but is produced in quantity only in supernova explosions. Because the half-life of 129I is comparatively short on a cosmological time scale (16 million years), this demonstrated that only a short time had passed between the supernova and the time the meteorites had solidified and trapped the 129I. These two events (supernova and solidification of gas cloud) were inferred to have happened during the early history of the Solar System, because the 129I isotope was likely generated shortly before the Solar System was formed, seeding the solar gas cloud with isotopes from a second source. This supernova source may also have caused collapse of the solar gas cloud.|$|E

The precipitate was washed and dissolved in hydrochloric acid, in which it was converted to nitrate form then dried on a film and counted. It mostly contained a +5 species, which was immediately assigned to dubnium, but also a +4 species; based on that result, the team decided that additional chemical separation was needed. In 2005, the experiment was repeated, with the final product being hydroxide rather than nitrate precipitate, which was processed further at both Livermore (based on reverse phase chromatography) and Dubna (based on anion exchange chromatography). The +5 species was effectively isolated; dubnium in that experiment appeared three times in tantalum-only fractions and not even once in niobium-only fractions.
