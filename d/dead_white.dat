500|$|In September 2010, {{the use of}} Flocabulary was {{postponed}} in Oklahoma City Public Schools after several teachers voiced concern {{over some of the}} lyrics in the program. The lyrics to the song [...] "Old <b>Dead</b> <b>White</b> Men" [...] drew complaints about referring to the Founding Fathers of the United States as <b>dead</b> <b>white</b> males, a term used to criticize perceived disproportionate emphasis on the contributions of historical European males. The lyrics to [...] "O.D.W.M." [...] also compare Andrew Jackson's policy of Indian removal to Adolf Hitler's Final Solution.|$|E
500|$|Two {{weeks prior}} to the group {{starting}} university, they decided that they would take a second gap year, and perform new material which the band felt did not suit their current outfit. Cave stated that [...] "I felt as though I couldn't write about anything personal, so I would make up semi-comical stories that weren't really important to anyone, not even me." [...] Fear of Flying disbanded in October 2007 with a MySpace bulletin stating [...] "Fear of Flying is <b>DEAD</b> ... <b>White</b> Lies is alive!", before introducing a darker sound and a new name that reflected their maturity. Cave stated that the band deleted their MySpace account [...] "without any token farewell gigs". McVeigh said that the current musical climate {{had an effect on}} the split, stating that [...] "Maybe a few years ago, we would have signed a deal and had a chance to make three albums [...] In the current climate...weâ€™d have been dropped". When asked about the name change in an interview with a radio station in San Francisco, Jack Brown said that [...] "We just thought that we should perform these songs as a different band. We had songs that we felt weren't suitable for the band that we were in and we thought White Lies would be the perfect vehicle for the songs." ...|$|E
2500|$|Five {{employees}} of Williams Station, a Pony Express {{post on the}} Carson River, captured and raped two Northern Paiute women. [...] A band of Northern Paiutes attacked the post, killed the men and freed the women. Major William Ormsby collected a force of 105 volunteers from Virginia city who went out to bury the <b>dead</b> <b>white</b> men, and then punish the Paiutes at Pyramid Lake.|$|E

It's true-they were white guys! So were most of the guys that died in Lincoln's name {{opposing}} slavery in the 1860s. So why should I be ashamed of white guys? Why is [...] "Hispanic Pride" [...] or [...] "Black Pride" [...] a good thing, while [...] "White Pride" [...] conjures shaven heads and white hoods? Why was the Million Man March on Washington celebrated by many as progress, while the Promise Keepers March on Washington was greeted with suspicion and ridicule? I'll tell you why: Cultural warfare! ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, The New York Times Book Review named Beloved {{the best}} work of American fiction {{published}} in the previous 25 years, as chosen by a selection of prominent writers, literary critics, and editors. In his essay about the choice, [...] "In Search of the Best," [...] critic A. O. Scott said, [...] "Any other outcome would have been startling, since Morrison's novel has inserted itself into the American canon more completely than any of its potential rivals. With remarkable speed, 'Beloved' has, less than 20 years after its publication, become {{a staple of the}} college literary curriculum, which is to say a classic. This triumph is commensurate with its ambition, since it was Morrison's intention in writing it precisely to expand the range of classic American literature, to enter, as a living black woman, the company of <b>dead</b> <b>white</b> males like Faulkner, Melville, Hawthorne and Twain." ...|$|E
2500|$|The NAACP devoted much of {{its energy}} during the interwar years to {{fighting}} the lynching of blacks throughout the United States by working for legislation, lobbying and educating the public. The organization sent its field secretary Walter F. White to Phillips County, Arkansas, in October 1919, to investigate the Elaine Race Riot. More than 200 black tenant farmers were killed by roving white vigilantes and federal troops after a deputy sheriff's attack on a union meeting of sharecroppers left one white man <b>dead.</b> <b>White</b> published his report on the riot in the Chicago Daily News. The NAACP organized the appeals for twelve black men sentenced to death a month later {{based on the fact}} that testimony used in their convictions was obtained by beatings and electric shocks. It gained a groundbreaking Supreme Court decision in Moore v. Dempsey [...] that significantly expanded the Federal courts' oversight of the states' criminal justice systems in the years to come. White investigated eight race riots and 41 lynchings for the NAACP and directed its study Thirty Years of Lynching in the United States.|$|E

40|$|With the Quincentenary upon us, it was {{predictable}} {{that some}} groups, once again, {{would seek to}} set the record straight concerning Christopher Columbus' "discovery " of America As if on cue, the Norwegians reminded us that 1991 was the 1000 th anniversary of Leif Ericsson's voyage to New Foundland, and Native Americans restated their objection to the very idea that Columbus "discovered" a land already inhabited by millions. The charges, however, have gone beyond such perennial pleadings for historical accuracy. As Gary Wills has put it, in Columbus we have been offered for our detestation "the <b>deadest</b> <b>whitest</b> male" ever. 1 "A funny thing happened on the way to the quincentennial observation of America's discovery, " Wills writes: "Columbus got mugged.

5000|$|It is {{eventually}} revealed that this diamond {{in question was}} hidden in the plane piloted by the Namibian woman and her companions when it crashed. She subsequently recovers it with Muende's help; the two, facing only inevitable defeat against Bakunda's army as it rapidly intensifies the fighting, decide to go into exile in Central America, dividing the proceeds of the diamond's sale. However, a vengeful Geordie tracks them down, and both are shot dead by a Kamangan soldier. This brings the figure of <b>dead</b> <b>whites</b> since the witch doctor's curse up to nine. While later attempting to stop the rebels from getting their hands on an old stockpile of Soviet warheads, Sharp is exposed to a near-fatal dose of radiation.|$|R

60|$|Belllounds turned <b>dead</b> <b>white,</b> not {{apparently}} from fury or fear, {{but from}} a shock that had its birth within the deep, mysterious, emotional reachings of his mind. He was utterly astounded, as if confronting a vague, terrible premonition of the future. Wade's swift words, like the ring of bells, had not been menacing, but prophetic.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Travers {{stood against}} the rail as {{motionless}} as a statue.
