5|$|Like other primates, lemurs groom {{socially}} (allogroom) to ease {{tensions and}} solidify relationships. They groom <b>in</b> <b>greeting,</b> when waking up, when settling in for sleep, {{between mother and}} infant, in juvenile relations, and for sexual advances. Unlike anthropoid primates, who part the fur with the hands and pick out particles with the fingers or mouth, lemurs groom with their tongue and scraping with their toothcomb. Despite the differences in technique, lemurs groom with the same frequency and {{for the same reasons}} as anthropoids.|$|E

5|$|Inquisitive foxes will rotate and flick {{their ears}} whilst sniffing. Playful {{individuals}} will perk their ears and rise on their hind legs. Male foxes courting females, or after successfully evicting intruders, will turn their ears outwardly, {{and raise their}} tails in a horizontal position, with the tips raised upward. When afraid, red foxes grin in submission, arching their backs, curving their bodies, crouching their legs and lashing their tails {{back and forth with}} their ears pointing backwards and pressed against their skulls. When merely expressing submission to a dominant animal, the posture is similar, but without arching the back or curving the body. Submissive foxes will approach dominant animals in a low posture, so that their muzzles reach up <b>in</b> <b>greeting.</b> When two evenly matched foxes confront each other over food, they approach each other sideways and push against each other's flanks, betraying a mixture of fear and aggression through lashing tails and arched backs without crouching and pulling their ears back without flattening them against their skulls. When launching an assertive attack, red foxes approach directly rather than sideways, with their tails aloft and their ears rotated sideways. During such fights, red foxes will stand on each other's upper bodies with their forelegs, using open mouthed threats. Such fights typically only occur among juveniles or adults of the same sex.|$|E

When Flight 28 did not respond in kind, the B-34 crossed over the airliner's line of flight and throttled back to allow the slower DC-3 to catch up. Lt Wilson flew close to the airliner to attempt a second greeting, but misjudged {{the distance between the}} aircraft, and when he tried to pull up, the B-34's right propeller sliced through the airliner's tail.|$|E

25|$|This {{concentrated}} dramatic {{story is}} {{an account of}} men of Niutao who come across a strange canoe out in the ocean. The men call out <b>in</b> <b>greeting</b> to the canoe but the crew make no reply. The men of Niutao believe it is a ghostly canoe – containing the gods – so in fear of impending disaster the men rapidly paddle home {{to the safety of}} Niutao. When performed the strong rhythm of the song imitates the strokes of the men paddling, with the increase in tempo in the repetition of the song providing the dramatic emphasis of the escape from disaster.|$|E
25|$|In platonic respects, {{such as in}} {{sacrificial}} {{loyalty and}} zeal for the kingdom, Jonathan's love is seen as surpassing that of romantic or erotic affection, especially that of the women David had known up until that time. The grammatical and social difficulties are pointed out in respect to 1 Samuel 18:21, {{as well as the}} marked difference in the Bible between sensual kissing (as in Song of Songs) and the cultural kiss of Near Eastern culture whether <b>in</b> <b>greeting</b> or as expression of deep affection between friends and family (as found throughout the Old and New Testaments). The strong emotive language expressed by David towards Jonathan is also argued to be akin to that of platonic expressions in more expressive or pre-urban cultures.|$|E

500|$|In January 1833 two Noongar, Gyallipert and Manyat, visited Perth from King George Sound, where {{relations}} between settlers and natives were amicable. Two settlers, Richard [...] Dale and George Smythe, {{arranged for the}} men to meet a party of local Noongar to encourage friendly relations in the Swan River Colony. On 26 January Yagan led a group of ten formally armed Noongars <b>in</b> <b>greeting</b> the two men near Lake Monger.

As an example of his prowess, Yagan struck a walking stick from a distance of 25metres.|$|E
500|$|Female ruffed lemurs produce {{relatively}} rich milk {{compared to}} other lemurs, and consequently, their young develop faster than those of other lemurs. Infants develop rapidly, attaining approximately 70–75% adult weight {{by the age of}} four months. They begin climbing and clinging at one month of age, advancing to the point of independently following their mother and group members through the canopy at heights of [...] by two to three months. Full adult mobility is attained at three to four months of age. Socially, they begin exchanging contact calls with their mother at three weeks, and select their mother as their play partner 75–80% of the time during the first three months. Participation <b>in</b> <b>greeting</b> displays and more extensive vocalizations commences around four months, while scent marking does not start until six months of age. Infants begin testing solid food starting around 40 days to two months with weaning occurring between four and six months in the wild, although some individuals have continued to nurse until seven to eight months.|$|E
500|$|The {{reverse is}} based on a statue of King Kamehameha I of Hawaii, {{designed}} by Thomas R. Gould, and intended [...] "to symbolize the past and future glory of the Kingdom [...] ". The sculpture that stands in downtown Honolulu (1883) is a replacement for one that sank while being transported from Germany; the original (1880) was later salvaged and stands at Kohala on the island of Hawaii. The coin features a Hawaiian chieftain in ceremonial dress surmounting the top of a hill, with his arm extended <b>in</b> <b>greeting.</b> He represents Hawaii rising from obscurity. The palm tree that rises above him is intended to signify romance. A Hawaiian village at Waikiki Beach with Diamond Head nearby are seen behind him, representing history and antiquity. The design is almost free of lettering, with only [...] "E PLURIBUS UNUM" [...] ("Out of many, one") and 1778 1928 to be seen. Ferns are visible under that Latin motto: Houston wanted the plants removed, but Beach insisted on retaining them to balance the design. Juliette Fraser had made a number of sketches, all with the same basic design elements, but with the chieftain in various poses and with Diamond Head in different positions.|$|E
5000|$|Touch can reassure and {{indicate}} understanding.

500|$|The Care Bears {{franchise}} {{was created}} in 1981 by Those Characters from Cleveland, {{a division of the}} greeting card company American Greetings. Early in their tenure, the characters appeared as toys from the Kenner company, and also <b>in</b> <b>greeting</b> cards by Elena Kucharik. [...] They starred in two syndicated television specials from a Canadian animation studio, Atkinson Film-Arts of Ottawa: The Care Bears in the Land Without Feelings (1983) and The Care Bears Battle the Freeze Machine (1984). [...] After the specials, Toronto's Nelvana studio produced the first Care Bears Movie in less than eight months. [...] It was distributed in the United States by The Samuel Goldwyn Company, an independent outfit, and grossed US$22.9 million at the North American box-office, the largest amount for a non-Disney animated film at the time. [...] This success guaranteed production of a second film, which was in consideration by May 1985. [...] As with the original, production took place at Nelvana's facilities and Taiwan's Wang Film Productions; the Canadian studio also hired South Korean personnel to handle inking and painting. [...] This time, over one hundred Nelvana animators worked on the film over a seven-month period that lasted until February 1986; the company itself received credit for the story development. [...] American Greetings and Kenner commissioned Nelvana to make the sequel on contract; television syndicator LBS Communications, a co-financier of the first one, became the producer and presenter.|$|E
