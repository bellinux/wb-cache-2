2500|$|The first day's {{proceedings}} {{were repeated}} {{before the second}} jury, followed, as permitted, by evidence {{of what had happened}} in Bath. Straffen's defence called several of those who had seen Straffen in earlier years to give evidence of his mental condition. The prosecution then called prison medical officers and psychiatrists to give <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>rebuttal.</b> Dr. Thomas Munro, who was a specialist in mental deficiency and had seen Straffen, testified that Straffen had said that to murder was wrong because it was breaking the law and because [...] "it is one of the commandments". When Munro asked Straffen to name the other commandments, Straffen could remember only four.|$|E

Conversely, Dusek argued, the nature and volume of Danielle's trace <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> Westerfield's home and motor home, and on his jacket, allows no reasonable explanation other than guilt.|$|R

(2) If the {{petitioner}} {{applies to}} the court for leave to adduce additional evidence, and shows {{to the satisfaction of}} the court that such additional evidence is material and that there were reasonable grounds for the failure to adduce such evidence in the proceeding before the Secretary, the court may order such additional evidence (and <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>rebuttal</b> thereof) to be taken before the Secretary, and to be adduced upon the hearing, in such manner and upon such terms and conditions as to the court may seem proper.

50|$|In law, {{special rules}} apply to {{rebuttal}}; rebuttal evidence or rebuttal witnesses must be confined {{solely to the}} subject matter of the evidence rebutted. New evidence on other subjects may not be brought <b>in</b> <b>rebuttal.</b> However, rebuttal is one of the few vehicles whereby a party may introduce surprise evidence or witnesses. The basic process is as follows: both sides of a controversy are obliged to declare in advance of trial what witnesses they plan to call, and what each witness is expected to testify to. When either a plaintiff (or prosecutor) or defendant brings direct evidence or testimony which was not anticipated, the other side may be granted a specific opportunity to rebut it. <b>In</b> <b>rebuttal,</b> the rebutting party may generally bring witnesses and evidence which were never before declared, so long as they serve to rebut the prior evidence.|$|R

50|$|After {{the third}} day, the prisoners {{accepted}} their position, uniting {{them as a}} group and allowing them to overthrow the guards. <b>In</b> <b>rebuttal,</b> the guards formed their own government with stricter rules and harder punishment.
