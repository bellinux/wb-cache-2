40|$|Overwhelming {{intrusion}} alerts {{have made}} timely response to network security breaches a difficult task. Correlating alerts {{to produce a}} higher level view of <b>intrusion</b> <b>state</b> of a network, thus, becomes an essential element in network defense. This work proposes to analyze correlated or grouped alerts and determine their ‘impact’ to services and users of the network. A network is modeled as ‘virtual terrain ’ where cyber attacks maneuver. Overlaying correlated attack tracks on virtual terrain exhibits the vulnerabilities exploited by each track and the relationships between them and different network entities. The proposed impact assessment algorithm utilizes the graph-based virtual terrain model and combines assessments of damages caused by the attacks. The combined impact scores allow to identify severely damaged network services and affected users. Several scenarios are examined to demonstrate the uses of the proposed Virtual Terrain Assisted Impact Assessment for Cybe...|$|E

40|$|Due to {{the rapid}} growth of {{networked}} computer resources and the increasing importance of related applications, intrusions which threaten the infrastructure of these applications have are critical problems. In recent years, several intrusion detection systems designed to identify and detect possible intrusion behaviors. In this work, an intrusion detection model is proposed to for building an intrusion detection system which can solve problems involved in building an intrusion detection systems, including pattern representation, computability, performance, extendibility and maintenance problems. In this model, IDML is first designed to express intrusion patterns, and these patterns are transformed into <b>intrusion</b> pattern <b>state</b> machines. Once the <b>intrusion</b> pattern <b>state</b> machines are obtained, the corresponding intrusion detection mechanism that can use these state machines to detect intrusions is designed. To evaluate the performance of our model, an IDML-based intrusion detection experimental system based upon this architecture has been implemented...|$|R

40|$|In {{an era of}} {{cooperating}} ad hoc {{networks and}} pervasive wireless connectivity, we are becoming more vulnerable to malicious attacks. Many of these attacks are silent in nature and cannot be detected by the conventional intrusion detection system (IDS) methods such as traffic monitoring, port scanning, or protocol violations. These sophisticated attacks operate under the threshold boundaries during an intrusion attempt and can only be identified by profiling the complete system activity {{in relation to a}} normal behavior. In this paper we discuss a hidden Markov model (HMM) strategy for intrusion detection using a multivariate Gaussian model for observations that are then used to predict an attack that exists in a form of a hidden state. This model is comprised of a self-organizing network for event clustering, an observation classifier, a drift detector, a profile estimator, a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) accelerator, and an HMM engine. We use this method to predict the <b>intrusion</b> <b>states</b> based on observation deviation from normal profiles or by fitting it into an appropriate attack profile...|$|R

We explore the benefits of virtualization to reliably detect and tolerate faulty replicas, allowing the transformation of Byzantine faults into omission faults. Our approach reduces {{the total number of}} physical replicas from 3 f+ 1 to 2 f+ 1. It is based on the concept of twin virtual machines, which involves having two virtual machines in each physical host, each one acting as failure detector of the other.

This Article responds to those claims, arguing that the Act reflects a relatively minimal <b>intrusion</b> into <b>state</b> law, particularly with regard to issues of director independence.

Still, federal assistance for internal improvements evolved slowly and haphazardly—the product of contentious congressional factions and an executive branch generally concerned with avoiding unconstitutional federal <b>intrusions</b> into <b>state</b> affairs. Monroe believed that the young nation needed an improved infrastructure, including a transportation network to grow and thrive economically. However, {{he did not think}} that the Constitution said anything about the authority to build, maintain, and operate a national transportation system.

With hope of meaningful judicial federalism having largely receded, and Congress persisting in its penchant for <b>intrusions</b> on <b>state</b> authority, of late several scholars have championed {{the capacity of}} executive agencies to enforce and preserve federalism interests. This paper tests this position, providing the first empirically based critical analysis of administrative federalism, focusing on the recently enacted Adam Walsh Act, intended by Congress to redesign states’ sex offender registration and community notification laws. The paper casts significant doubt on the accepted empirical assumptions of administrative federalism, adding to the limited evidence amassed to date on state influence on agency rulemaking, and provides an important cautionary tale for future agency-based criminal justice mandates that will likely come to pass...|$|R

40|$|When {{the state}} {{acts as a}} market regulator, the dormant Commerce Clause invalidates discriminatory {{regulation}} {{without the need for}} an order against the state. The courts simply refuse to enforce the state law on the ground that it is unconstitutional. When the state acts as a market participant, however, the court would have to direct its order against the state or its officials to negate the discrimination. This produces a direct confrontation with the state, the same kind of confrontation the clear statement rule was designed to avoid. Part II of this article examines the theory of the dormant Commerce Clause, and concludes that it is a presumption of congressional intent based on a substantive policy choice to limit discrimination against interstate commerce. Part III looks at the justifications offered for the market participant exception, which permits states to discriminate in favor of their own people in state purchases and sales, and suggests that justifications offered by the Court and commentators are conclusory or inadequately explained. Part IV explains the clear statement rule, which is concerned with <b>intrusions</b> into <b>state</b> sovereignty, and shows how that rule applies to the dormant Commerce Clause when the government participates in the market. Part V discusses the exception for downstream regulation of interstate commerce, in which the concern for <b>intrusion</b> into <b>state</b> sovereignty does not apply. Part VI examines other constitutional clauses that may prohibit states from using their power to purchase or sell goods or services in order to discriminate against commerce from other states. This Part concludes that the market participant doctrine, which prevents the federal government from ordering states to make specific purchases or sales without a congressional determination that such regulation is necessary, is a sound application of the clear statement rule that poses no threat to interstate commerce in the light of other safeguards...|$|R
