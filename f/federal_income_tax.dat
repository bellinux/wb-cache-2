5|$|The U.S. Supreme Court {{rejected}} that argument, essentially ruling that under <b>federal</b> <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> law all the future income earned by Mr. Earl was taxable {{to him at}} the time he earned the income, even though he had already assigned part of the income to his wife, and regardless of the validity of the assignment agreement under state law.

Furthermore, the recipient must assure that only eligible individuals or groups participated in the program by establishing strict controls of program funds to avoid non-eligible persons from receiving the specific assistance.|$|E
5|$|In Southern Pacific Company v.

No issues involving the definition of income with respect to wages, salary or other compensation for labor were decided by the Court.|$|E

5000|$|Approximately 40-50% of U.S. {{households}} {{do not pay}} <b>federal</b> <b>income</b> <b>taxes,</b> {{either because}} they do not earn sufficient <b>income</b> to pay <b>federal</b> <b>income</b> <b>taxes</b> or qualify for exclusions (e.g., many elderly households don't pay <b>income</b> <b>taxes</b> on their Social Security benefits). The percent of households paying <b>income</b> <b>taxes</b> by age tends to rise into the prime working years (peaking at about 80% around age 50) and falls upon retirement.|$|R
5|$|Other {{important}} legislation involved {{two measures}} to raise revenues for the Federal government: tariffs (a policy with long precedent), {{and a new}} <b>Federal</b> <b>income</b> <b>tax.</b> In 1861, Lincoln signed {{the second and third}} Morrill Tariff, the first having become law under James Buchanan. Also in 1861, Lincoln signed the Revenue Act of 1861, creating the first U.S. income tax. This created a flat tax of 3 percent on incomes above $800 ($ in current dollar terms), which was later changed by the Revenue Act of 1862 to a progressive rate structure.|$|E
5|$|Lucas v. Earl is {{a leading}} case {{in the area of}} U.S. income taxation, and stands for the Anticipatory Assignment of Income Doctrine. In the case, Mr. Earl was arguing that because he and his wife, in the year 1901, had made a legally valid {{assignment}} agreement (for state law purposes) to have his then-current and after-acquired income (which was earned solely by him) be treated as the income of both him and his wife as joint tenants with right of survivorship, the assignment agreement should also determine the <b>federal</b> <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> effect of the income he earned (i.e., only half the income should be taxed to him).|$|E
5|$|Regarding the {{taxability}} {{of income}} {{in connection with}} events or activities not involving a government privilege or franchise, the United States Supreme Court stated in United States v.

United States that the receipt of money obtained by extortion is taxable as income to the wrongdoer. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in James v.

5|$|During Reagan's presidency, <b>federal</b> <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> {{rates were}} lowered {{significantly}} with {{the signing of}} the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, which lowered the top marginal tax bracket from 70% to 50% and the lowest bracket from 14% to 11%. Other tax increases passed by Congress and signed by Reagan ensured however that tax revenues over his two terms were 18.2% of GDP as compared to 18.1% over the 40-year period of 1970–2010. Then, in 1982 the Job Training Partnership Act of 1982 was signed into law, initiating one of the United States' first public–private partnerships and {{a major part of the}} president's job creation program. Reagan's Assistant Secretary of Labor and Chief of Staff, Al Angrisani, was a primary architect of the bill.|$|E
5|$|Revenue from tariffs {{was then}} {{a major source of}} income for the federal government. There was no <b>federal</b> <b>income</b> <b>tax,</b> and tariff debates were passionate; the 1888 presidential {{election}} had them as a major issue. Many Democrats supported a tariff for revenue only—that is, the purpose of tariffs should be to finance government, not to encourage American manufacturers. McKinley disagreed with that and sponsored the McKinley Tariff of 1890. This act, passed by the Republican-dominated Congress, raised rates on imports to protect American industry. McKinley's tariff proved unpopular among many people who had to pay the increased prices, and was seen as a reason not only for his defeat for re-election to Congress in 1890, but also for the Republicans losing control of both House and Senate in that year's midterm elections. Nevertheless, McKinley's defeat did not, in the end, damage his political prospects, as the Democrats were blamed for gerrymandering him out of his seat.|$|E
5|$|The Civil War {{expenditures}} quickly strained the government's already fragile {{financial situation}} and Sherman, {{assigned to the}} Senate Finance Committee, {{was involved in the}} process of increasing the revenue. In July 1861, Congress authorized the government to issue Demand Notes, the first form of paper money issued directly by the United States government. The notes were redeemable in specie (i.e., gold or silver coin) but, as Sherman would note in his memoirs, they did not solve the revenue problem, as the government did not have the coin to redeem the notes should they all be presented for payment. To solve this problem, Chase asked for and Congress authorized the issuance of $150 million in bonds, which (as banks purchased them with gold) replenished the treasury. Congress also sought to increase revenue when they passed the Revenue Act of 1861, which imposed the first <b>federal</b> <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> in American history. Sherman endorsed the measure, and even spoke in favor of a steeper tax than the one imposed by the Act (3% on income above $800), preferring to raise revenue by taxation than by borrowing. In August, the special session closed and Sherman returned home to Mansfield to promote military recruitment again.|$|E
