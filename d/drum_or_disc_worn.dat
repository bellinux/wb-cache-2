The shredded, or masticated, debris forms a compacted layer of woody fuel on the soil surface, resulting in a fuel structure that is thought to alter fire behavior by reducing flame lengths, intensity, and rate of spread (Kane et al. 2009).|$|R
50|$|Certain {{heavier duty}} drum brake systems {{compensate}} for load when determining wheel cylinder pressure; a feature rare when discs are employed (Hydropneumatic suspension systems as employed on Citroën vehicles adjust brake pressure depending on load regardless of if <b>drum</b> <b>or</b> <b>discs</b> are used). One such vehicle is the Jeep Comanche. The Comanche can automatically send more {{pressure to the}} rear drums {{depending on the size}} of the load.

5000|$|A third type of {{flip-flop}} hub {{is rather}} rare and not truly a flip flop hub by design, {{although it can}} be used in that way. This type of hub has standard ISO 1.375" [...] x 24 tpi on BOTH sides, but it was not intended for two freewheels. These were designed for the use of a <b>drum</b> <b>or</b> <b>disc</b> hand brake on the left side, and a multi speed freewheel on the right. The drum and disc brakes designed for early tandems used standard ISO 1.375" [...] x 24 freewheel threads to attach the <b>disc</b> <b>or</b> <b>drum</b> to the hub. These tandem hubs can easily be adapted for use as single speed flip flop hubs using any combination of two ISO English threaded freewheels.|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been made}} of the rates of cooling of vehicle brake drums and discs. Thermocouples were inserted in the drums and discs and in the wheel hubs and their outputs fed via slip ring units to meters mounted inside the vehicle. The <b>drums</b> <b>or</b> <b>discs</b> were heated to a uniform temperature of 30 O 0 - 40 OcC by drag braking and the rate at which they cooled measured while the vehicle was driven at constant speed. Measure-ments were made at various speeds in the range 0 to 90 mile/h. From the log (temperature) against time plot a cooling coefficient b, was determined. It is shown that at a vehicle speed v the quantity b, can be expressed in the form b, = bo +KVO. ~ where b, represents the loss of heat to the hub and K is a constant depending on {{the size and shape of}} the <b>drum</b> <b>or</b> <b>disc.</b> Values of these constants have been determined on a variety of cars having discs and drums varying from 7 in to 11 in diameter and on a lorry fitted with 16. 75 in diameter drums. Cooling rates are shown to depend on shape and size of the <b>disc</b> <b>or</b> <b>drum.</b> Results show that the cooling rates of front brakes are about 20 per cent higher than the rear brakes and that front discs cool about 25 per cent more quickly than the corresponding drum size recom-mended for the same vehicle. The cooling rate of front discs did not change when wire wheels were fitted instead of solid wheels. Ventilated discs and solid discs were also compared. The effect of fitting dust shields on disc brakes is shown to reduce the cooling rates by about 30 per cent. The effect of otherwise disturbing the air flow was studied...|$|R
2500|$|Initially, the Escort {{was sold}} as a two-door saloon (with {{circular}} front headlights and rubber flooring on the [...] "De Luxe" [...] model). The [...] "Super" [...] model featured rectangular headlights, carpets, a cigar lighter and a water temperature gauge. A two-door estate was introduced {{at the end of}} March 1968 which, with the back seat folded down, provided a 40% increase in maximum load space over the old Anglia 105E estate, according to the manufacturer. The estate featured the same engine options as the saloon, but it also included a larger, [...] clutch, stiffer rear springs and in most configurations slightly larger brake <b>drums</b> <b>or</b> <b>discs</b> than the saloon. A panel van appeared in April 1968 and the 4-door saloon (a bodystyle the Anglia was never available in for UK market) in 1969.|$|R
40|$|Wood chips need {{to fulfill}} {{specific}} quality parameters {{in order to}} be used as fuel for industrial or residential use. Moisture content and chip size distribution are recognized as the main physical characteristics affecting energy conversion efficiency. Objective {{of the study was to}} evaluate the effects of harvesting mode on the quality of wood chips, under the typical conditions offered by SRC poplar grown in Central Italy. Single-pass and two-pass harvesting were compared. Standing stems and cut windrowed stems were harvested using two modified foragers alternately equipped with a <b>drum</b> <b>or</b> a <b>disc</b> chipper, allowing a further comparison of different chipping devices. Data were obtained from 3 fields in Central Italy and allowed analyzing the drying process occurring when stems are felled and stored in the field as windrows. The mean water content at the time of cutting was 59 % (wH 2 O) (wH 2 O), which was reduced below 30 % after about 100 days of storage in the windrows. Regression analysis of storage duration and moisture content showed that air temperature is the main driver of the drying process, under the typical conditions of a Mediterranean climate. Harvest mode (single-pass or two-pass) and chipping device (<b>drum</b> <b>or</b> <b>disc)</b> have a significant effect on particle-size distribution. The incidence of accept particle was higher when chipping windrowed stems <b>or</b> using the <b>drum</b> chipper.

50|$|The {{design was}} by Dipl-Ing Klaus Holighaus and the {{prototype}} first flew in May 1974. The production examples incorporated several improvements in January 1975. The Janus has a glass-fibre monocoque fuselage {{similar to that}} of the Nimbus-2 but the cockpit section is lengthened to accommodate the two pilots in tandem with dual controls under a right-hand side hinged one-piece canopy. Landing gear consists of either a non-retractable main wheel (Janus A, B & C) or a retractable main wheel (later models of Janus C and all Ce's) with a <b>drum</b> <b>or</b> <b>disc</b> brake, and a nose-wheel. The two-piece wings have 2° forward sweep on the leading edge, and have camber-changing flaps which are operated between +12° and -7°. The Janus has upper surface airbrakes, and although uncommon the Janus C could also be fitted with a tail parachute.|$|R
50|$|A lug nut is a nut {{with one}} rounded or conical (tapered) end, used on steel and most {{aluminum}} wheels. A set of lug nuts are typically used {{to secure a}} wheel to threaded wheel studs and thereby to a vehicle's axles.Some designs (BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Saab, Volkswagen) use lug bolts instead of nuts, which screw into a tapped (threaded) hole in the wheel's hub <b>or</b> <b>drum</b> brake <b>or</b> <b>disc.</b> This configuration {{is commonly known as}} a bolted joint.|$|R
50|$|The Flaminia's chassis was a {{development}} of the Aurelia's, but was significantly upgraded. The front suspension was changed to a more conventional configuration with double wishbones, coil springs, telescopic shock absorbers, and an anti-roll bar. The rear suspension retained the De Dion setup, with a transaxle mounted at the rear as in the Aurelia. The first Berlina was available with <b>drum</b> brake <b>or</b> <b>discs,</b> all other models used discs only.|$|R
5000|$|Brake fade {{typically}} {{occurs during}} heavy or sustained braking. Many high-speed vehicles use disc brakes, and many European heavy vehicles use disc brakes. Many U.S. and third-world heavy vehicles use drum brakes {{due to their}} lower purchase price. On heavy vehicles, air drag is often small compared to the weight, so the brakes dissipate proportionally more energy than on a typical car or motorcycle. Thus, heavy vehicles often need to use engine compression braking, and slow down so braking energy is dissipated over a longer interval. Recent studies have been performed in the United States to test the stopping distances of both drum brakes and disc brakes using a North American Standard called FMVSS-121. The results showed that when newer compounding of friction materials typically used in disc brakes is applied to drum brakes that {{there is virtually no}} difference in stopping distance or brake fade. As the United States changed its FMVSS-121 rules for Class Eight trucks built in 2012 to reduce stopping distances by about 1/3rd there was no recommendation to use either <b>drum</b> <b>or</b> <b>disc</b> brakes in the current law.|$|R

The most valuable award was the corona muralis, a crown made of gold awarded to the first man to scale an enemy rampart. This was awarded rarely, as such a man hardly ever survived.|$|R
40|$|Coal {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} energy resources in the US with nearly 800 million tons of it being mined annually. Process and environmental demands for low-ash, low-sulfur coals and economic constraints for high productivity are leading the coal industry to use such modern mining methods as longwall mining and such newer coal processing techniques as froth flotation, oil agglomeration, chemical cleaning and synthetic fuel production. All these processes are faced with one common problem area [...] fine coals. Dealing effectively with these fine coals during handling, storage, transportation, and/or processing continues to be a challenge facing the industry. Agglomeration by the unit operation of pelletization consists of tumbling moist fines in <b>drums</b> <b>or</b> <b>discs.</b> Past experimental work and limited commercial practice have shown that pelletization can alleviate the problems associated with fine coals. However, it was recognized that there exists a serious need for delineating the fundamental principles of fine coal pelletization. Accordingly, a research program has been carried involving four specific topics: (i) experimental investigation of coal pelletization kinetics, (ii) understanding the surface principles of coal pelletization, (iii) modeling of coal pelletization processes, and (iv) simulation of fine coal pelletization circuits. This report summarizes the major findings and provides relevant details of the research effort...|$|R

40|$|During vehicle {{deceleration}} due to braking there is {{friction between the}} lining surface and the brake <b>drum</b> <b>or</b> <b>disc.</b> In this process the kinetic energy of vehicle is turned into thermal energy that raises temperature of the components. The heating of the brake system {{in the course of}} braking is a great problem, because besides damaging the system, it may also affect the wheel and tire, which can cause accidents. In search of the best configuration that considers the true conditions of use, without passing the safety limits, models and formulations are presented with respect to the brake system, considering different braking conditions and kinds of brakes. Some modeling was analyzed using well-known methods. The flat plate model considering energy conservation was applied to a bus, using for this a computer program. The vehicle is simulated to undergo an emergency braking, considering the change of temperature on the lining-drum. The results include deceleration, braking efficiency, wheel resistance, normal reaction on the tires and the coefficient of adhesion. Some of the results were compared with dynamometer tests made by FRAS-LE and others were compared with track tests made by Mercedes-Benz. The convergence between the results and the tests is sufficient to validate the mathematical model. The computer program makes it possible to simulate the brake system performance in the vehicle. It assists the designer during the development phase and reduces track tests...|$|R
50|$|Another type {{of power}} brake {{installed}} in automobiles {{is called the}} drum brake. This type of brake, in general, will create some friction that will slow down the wheel. How this works {{is there is a}} brake cylinder that connects master cylinder to the drum brake via brake lines that transfer pressure from the master cylinder. When the driver pushes the brake pedal with his/her foot, the pistons inside the cylinder will activate. The activation of this piston will allow two brake shoes located within the drum of the brake to expand, thus generating friction to slow down and stop the wheel. Usually, this brake is located in the rear wheels of the vehicle, while the disk brake is located {{at the front of the}} vehicle. A car may also have only <b>drum</b> brakes <b>or</b> <b>disc</b> brakes both front and rear.|$|R

25|$|Cold judder, on {{the other}} hand, {{is the result of}} uneven <b>disc</b> <b>wear</b> {{patterns}} <b>or</b> <b>disc</b> thickness variation (DTV). These variations in the disc surface are usually the result of extensive vehicle road usage.

5000|$|Lacing is {{the process}} of {{threading}} spokes through holes in the hub and rim so that they form a spoke pattern. While most manufacturers use the same lacing pattern on both left and right sides of a wheel, it is becoming increasingly common to find specialty wheels with different lacing patterns on each side. A spoke can connect the hub to the rim in a radial fashion, which creates the lightest and most aerodynamic wheel. However, to efficiently transfer torque from the hub to the rim, as with driven wheels <b>or</b> wheels with <b>drum</b> <b>or</b> <b>disc</b> brakes, durability dictates that spokes be mounted at an angle to the hub flange up to a [...] "tangential lacing pattern" [...] to achieve maximum torque capability (but minimum vertical wheel stiffness). Names for various lacing patterns are commonly referenced to the number of spokes that any one spoke crosses. Conventionally laced 36- or 32-spoke wheels are most commonly built as a cross-3 or a cross-2, however other cross-numbers are also possible. The angle at which the spoke interfaces the hub is not solely determined by the cross-number; as spoke count and hub diameter will lead to significantly different spoke angles. For all common tension-spoke wheels with crossed spokes, a torque applied to the hub will result in one half of the spokes - called [...] "leading spokes" [...] tensioned to drive the rim, while other half - [...] "trailing spokes" [...] are tensioned only to counteract the leading spokes. When forward torque is applied (i.e., during acceleration [...] ), the trailing spokes experience a higher tension, while leading spokes are relieved, thus forcing the rim to rotate. While braking, leading spokes tighten and trailing spokes are relieved. The wheel can thus transfer the hub torque in either direction with the least amount of change in spoke tension, allowing the wheel to stay true while torque is applied.|$|R
50|$|The car example {{relies on}} the way the brakes operate on a {{rotating}} <b>drum</b> <b>or</b> on a <b>disc.</b> As long as the disc rotates the brake pads act to decelerate the vehicle via the kinetic frictional forces which create a constant braking torque on the disk. This decreases the rotation linearly to zero with constant angular acceleration, but when the rotation reaches exactly zero, this hitherto constant frictional force suddenly drops to zero, as well as the torque, and the associated acceleration of the car. This, of course, neglects all effects of tire sliding, dipping of suspension, real deflection of all ideally rigid mechanisms, etc. A sudden drop in acceleration indicates a Dirac delta in the physical jerk, which is smoothed down by the real environment, the cumulative effects of which are analogous to damping, to the physiologically perceived jerk.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} vehicle uses of master {{cylinders}} are in brake and clutch systems. In brake systems, the operated devices are cylinders inside of brake calipers and/or drum brakes; these cylinders {{may be called}} wheel cylinders or slave cylinders, and they push the brake pads towards a surface that rotates with the wheel (this surface is typically either a <b>drum,</b> <b>or</b> a <b>disc,</b> a.k.a. a rotor) until the stationary brake pad(s) create friction against that rotating surface (typically the rotating surface is metal or ceramic/carbon, {{for their ability to}} withstand heat and friction without wearing-down rapidly). In the clutch system, the device which the master cylinder operates is called the slave cylinder; it moves the throw out bearing until the high-friction material on the transmission's clutch disengages from the engine's metal (or ceramic/carbon) flywheel. For hydraulic brakes or clutches alike, flexible high-pressure hoses or inflexible hard-walled metal tubing may be used; but the flexible variety of tubing is needed for at least a short length adjacent to each wheel, whenever the wheel can move relative to the car's chassis (this is the case on any car with steering and other suspension movements; some drag racers and go-karts have no rear suspension, as the rear axle is welded to the chassis, and some antique cars also have no rear suspension movement).|$|R
50|$|Cold judder, on {{the other}} hand, {{is the result of}} uneven <b>disc</b> <b>wear</b> {{patterns}} <b>or</b> <b>disc</b> thickness variation (DTV). These variations in the disc surface are usually the result of extensive vehicle road usage. DTV is usually attributed to the following causes: waviness and roughness of disc surface, misalignment of axis (runout), elastic deflection, wear and friction material transfers.Either type could potentially fixed by ensuring a clean mounting surface {{on either side of the}} brake disc between the wheel hub and brake disc hub before usage and paying attention to imprinting after extended usage by leaving the brake pedal heavily depressed at the end of heavy usage. Sometimes a bed in procedure can clean and minimize DTV and lay a new even transfer layer between the pad and brake disc. However it will not eliminate hot spots or excessive run out.|$|R

25|$|When {{braking force}} is applied, {{the act of}} {{abrasive}} friction between the brake pad and the <b>disc</b> <b>wears</b> both the <b>disc</b> and pad away. The brake dust that is seen deposited on wheels, calipers and other braking system components consists mostly of disc material. Brake dust can damage the finish of most wheels if not washed off. Generally, a brake pad that aggressively abrades more disc material away, such as metallic pads, will create more brake dust. Some higher performing pads for track use or towing use may wear away much quicker than a typical pad causing additional dust from heightened brake <b>disc</b> <b>wear</b> and brake pad wear.|$|R
2500|$|A {{floating}} caliper (also called a [...] "sliding caliper") moves {{with respect to}} the disc, along a line parallel to the axis of rotation of the disc; a piston {{on one side of the}} disc pushes the inner brake pad until it makes contact with the braking surface, then pulls the caliper body with the outer brake pad so pressure is applied to both sides of the disc. Floating caliper (single piston) designs are subject to sticking failure, caused by dirt or corrosion entering at least one mounting mechanism and stopping its normal movement. This can lead to the caliper's pads rubbing on the disc when the brake is not engaged or engaging it at an angle. Sticking can result from infrequent vehicle use, failure of a seal or rubber protection boot allowing debris entry, dry-out of the grease in the mounting mechanism and subsequent moisture incursion leading to corrosion, or some combination of these factors. Consequences may include reduced fuel efficiency, extreme heating of the <b>disc</b> <b>or</b> excessive <b>wear</b> on the affected pad. A sticking front caliper may also cause steering vibration.|$|R
