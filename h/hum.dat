5|$|Although {{generally}} {{quiet and}} non-vocal, giraffes {{have been heard}} to communicate using various sounds. During courtship, males emit loud coughs. Females call their young by bellowing.

During nighttime, giraffes appear to <b>hum</b> to each other above the infrasound range for purposes which are unclear.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In query-by-humming system, {{minimizing}} the impact {{introduced by the}} pitch tracking errors and <b>humming</b> errors is always a difficult problem.

Also, the approach to combine the local and global distance measure is proposed. The experiment of our QBH system on the mobile phone channel shows that the performance is greatly improved...|$|R

5|$|Like their {{previous}} tours, The Joshua Tree Tour was a minimalistic, austere production, and U2 used this outlet for addressing {{political and social}} concerns. One such issue was Arizona Governor Evan Mecham's canceling the state's observance of Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. Throughout the tour, the group continued to explore American roots music: they collaborated with folk artist Bob Dylan, blues musician B. B. King, and Harlem's New Voices of Freedom gospel choir; U2 also visited Graceland and Sun Studios in Memphis, where they recorded new material. These new songs and the band's experiences on tour were documented for the 1988 Rattle and <b>Hum</b> album and Phil Joanou-directed motion picture.|$|E
5|$|The {{sound effects}} were {{designed}} by Star Wars veteran Ben Burtt. Whereas the phaser blast noises from the television series were derived from The War of the Worlds (1953), Burtt made his phaser sounds more like his blasters from Star Wars, because Abrams' depiction of phasers were closer to the blasters' bullet-like fire, rather than the steady beams of energy in previous Star Trek films. Burtt reproduced the classic photon torpedo and warp drive sounds: he tapped a long spring against a contact microphone, and combined that with cannon fire. Burtt used a 1960s oscillator to create a musical and emotional <b>hum</b> to the warping and transporting sounds.|$|E

In order to secure the loyalty of the noblemen he had subjugated, as well as to win over those still supporting Vuk, Tvrtko bestowed a number of grants; in August he invested Vukac Hrvatinić with the entire župa of Pliva for his part in the 1363 war with Hungary. After initially rapid success, Tvrtko's campaign slowed. Sanko Miltenović, ruler of eastern <b>Hum,</b> defected to Vuk in late 1366. Throughout the following year, Tvrtko forced Vuk southwards, eventually compelling him to flee to Ragusa. Sanko, Vuk's last supporter, submitted to Tvrtko in late summer and was allowed to retain his holdings. Ragusan officials made an effort to procure peace between the feuding brothers, and in 1368, Vuk asked Pope Urban V to intervene with King Louis I on his behalf. Those efforts were futile; but by 1374, Tvrtko had reconciled with Vuk on very generous terms.|$|E
