5|$|In {{adolescent}} and adults, common side effects reported include weight loss, constipation, dyslipidemia and, in women, <b>dysmenorrhea.</b>|$|E
5|$|Painful {{cramping}} in the abdomen, back, or upper thighs {{is common}} {{during the first}} few days of menstruation. Severe uterine pain during menstruation is known as <b>dysmenorrhea,</b> and it is most common among adolescents and younger women (affecting about 67.2% of adolescent females). When menstruation begins, symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) such as breast tenderness and irritability generally decrease. Many sanitary products are marketed to women for use during their menstruation.|$|E
5|$|While {{defended by}} those {{cultures}} {{in which it}} constitutes a tradition, FGC is opposed by many medical and cultural organizations {{on the grounds that}} it is unnecessary and harmful. Short term health effects may include hemorrhage, infection, sepsis, and even result in death, while long term effects include dyspareunia, <b>dysmenorrhea,</b> vaginitis and cystitis. In addition FGC leads to complications with pregnancy, labor and delivery. Reversal (defibulation) by skilled personnel may be required to open the scarred tissue. Amongst those opposing the practice are local grassroots groups, and national and international organisations including WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA and Amnesty International. Legislative efforts to ban FGC have rarely been successful and the preferred approach is education and empowerment and the provision of information about the adverse health effects as well the human rights aspects.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dysmenorrhea</b> can be {{classified}} as either primary or secondary based on the absence or presence of an underlying cause. Secondary <b>dysmenorrhea</b> is <b>dysmenorrhea</b> which is associated with an existing condition.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} cause of {{secondary}} <b>dysmenorrhea</b> is endometriosis, which can be visually confirmed by laparoscopy in approximately 70% of adolescents with <b>dysmenorrhea.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Dysmenorrhea</b> is {{estimated}} to affect approximately 25% of women. Reports of <b>dysmenorrhea</b> are greatest among individuals {{in their late teens}} and 20s, with reports usually declining with age. The prevalence in adolescent females has been reported to be 67.2% by one study and 90% by another. It has been stated that there is no significant difference in prevalence or incidence between races. Yet, a study of Hispanic adolescent females indicated a high prevalence and impact in this group. Another study indicated that <b>dysmenorrhea</b> was present in 36.4% of participants, and was significantly associated with lower age and lower parity. Childbearing is said to relieve <b>dysmenorrhea,</b> but this does not always occur. One study indicated that in nulliparous women with primary <b>dysmenorrhea,</b> the severity of menstrual pain decreased significantly after age 40. A questionnaire concluded that menstrual problems, including <b>dysmenorrhea,</b> were more common in females who had been sexually abused.|$|E
25|$|Primary or {{essential}} <b>dysmenorrhea</b> is a {{very common}} gynecological phenomenon experienced by women during their reproductive years. Clinical studies have shown symptom relief {{and a reduction in}} pain with dydrogesterone treatment for <b>dysmenorrhea.</b>|$|E
25|$|Symptoms often co-occurring with menstrual pain include {{nausea and}} vomiting, {{diarrhea}} or constipation, headache, dizziness, disorientation, hypersensitivity to sound, light, smell and touch, fainting, and fatigue. Symptoms of <b>dysmenorrhea</b> often begin immediately after ovulation and can last {{until the end}} of menstruation. This is because <b>dysmenorrhea</b> is often associated with changes in hormonal levels in the body that occur with ovulation. The use of certain types of birth control pills can prevent the symptoms of <b>dysmenorrhea</b> because they stop ovulation from occurring.|$|E
25|$|Use of {{hormonal}} {{birth control}} may improve symptoms of primary <b>dysmenorrhea.</b> A 2009 systematic review however found limited {{evidence that the}} birth control pill, containing low doses or medium doses of oestrogen, reduces pain associated with <b>dysmenorrhea.</b> In addition, no differences between different birth control pill preparations were found.|$|E
25|$|Diclofenac is used {{to treat}} pain, {{inflammatory}} disorders, and <b>dysmenorrhea.</b>|$|E
25|$|Other {{causes of}} {{secondary}} <b>dysmenorrhea</b> include leiomyoma, adenomyosis, ovarian cysts, and pelvic congestion.|$|E
25|$|Reviews found {{tentative}} {{evidence that}} ginger powder may be effective for primary <b>dysmenorrhea.</b>|$|E
25|$|Compared {{with other}} women, women with primary <b>dysmenorrhea</b> have {{increased}} {{activity of the}} uterine muscle with increased contractility and increased frequency of contractions.|$|E
25|$|Reviews {{have found}} {{promising}} evidence for Chinese herbal medicine for primary <b>dysmenorrhea,</b> {{but that the}} evidence was limited by its poor methodological quality.|$|E
25|$|Female-specific: masculinization, {{irreversible}} voice deepening, hirsutism (excessive facial/body hair growth), menstrual disturbances (e.g., anovulation, oligomenorrhea, amenorrhea, <b>dysmenorrhea),</b> clitoral enlargement, breast atrophy, uterine atrophy, teratogenicity (in female fetuses).|$|E
25|$|Hormonal {{birth control}} {{methods such as}} birth control pills, the {{contraceptive}} patch, vaginal ring, contraceptive implant, and hormonal IUD are used to treat cramping and pain associated with primary <b>dysmenorrhea.</b>|$|E
25|$|Hormonal {{contraception}} {{is primarily}} {{used for the}} prevention of pregnancy, but is also prescribed for the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome, menstrual disorders such as <b>dysmenorrhea</b> and menorrhagia, and hirsutism.|$|E
25|$|The main {{symptom of}} <b>dysmenorrhea</b> is pain {{concentrated}} in the lower abdomen or pelvis. It is also commonly felt in the right or {{left side of the}} abdomen. It may radiate to the thighs and lower back.|$|E
25|$|TCM Information: Species: Cinnamomum cassia. Pinyin: Gui Zhi. Common Name: Cinnamon Twig. Quality: Pungent (Acrid), Sweet, Warm. Meridians: Heart, Lung, Bladder. Actions: Induces sweating, warms and unblocks channels, unblocks yang qi of the chest, treats <b>dysmenorrhea.</b>|$|E
25|$|Estrogen is {{also used}} in the therapy of vaginal atrophy, hypoestrogenism (as a result of hypogonadism, oophorectomy, or primary ovarian failure), amenorrhea, <b>dysmenorrhea,</b> and oligomenorrhea. Estrogens {{can also be used}} to {{suppress}} lactation after child birth.|$|E
25|$|Nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs) {{are effective}} in relieving the pain of primary <b>dysmenorrhea.</b> They can have side effects of nausea, dyspepsia, peptic ulcer, and diarrhea. People {{who are unable to}} take the more common NSAIDs may be prescribed a COX-2 inhibitor.|$|E
25|$|Once a {{diagnosis}} of <b>dysmenorrhea</b> is made, further workup is required to search for any secondary underlying cause of it, {{in order to be}} able to treat it specifically and to avoid the aggravation of a perhaps serious underlying cause.|$|E
25|$|A {{survey in}} Norway showed that 14 percent of females {{between the ages}} of 20 to 35 {{experience}} symptoms so severe that they stay home from school or work. Among adolescent girls, <b>dysmenorrhea</b> {{is the leading cause of}} recurrent short-term school absence.|$|E
25|$|Endometriosis is {{a chronic}} disease {{which can cause}} severe, progressive, and at times, incapacitating <b>dysmenorrhea,</b> pelvic pain, {{dyspareunia}} and infertility. Dydrogesterone relieves pain without inhibiting ovulation, so that patients are able to become pregnant during treatment. Dydrogesterone is particularly suitable {{in cases where the}} woman desires to become pregnant and to prevent bleeding problems. Dydrogesterone results in statistically significant reductions in the symptoms pelvic pain, <b>dysmenorrhea</b> and dyspareunia after the first treatment cycle for the treatment of post-laparoscopic endometriosis. The amount and duration of menstrual bleeding is also significantly reduced, and {{from the end of the}} third month onwards, bleeding was considered normal in the majority of patients. Improvement of endometriosis was observed in 71% of patients and cure in 21%.|$|E
25|$|Species: Cinnamomum cassia. Pinyin: Rou Gui. Common Name: Cinnamon Bark. Quality: Pungent (Acrid), Sweet, Hot. Meridians: Heart, Kidney, Liver, Spleen. Actions: Tonifies kidney yang, leads fire {{back to its}} source, disperses cold, {{encourages}} {{generation of}} qi and blood, promotes blood circulation, alleviates pain due to cold, <b>dysmenorrhea.</b>|$|E
25|$|Prostaglandins are {{released}} during menstruation, {{due to the}} destruction of the endometrial cells, and the resultant release of their contents. Release of prostaglandins and other inflammatory mediators in the uterus cause the uterus to contract. These substances are thought to be a major factor in primary <b>dysmenorrhea.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Dysmenorrhea</b> is {{estimated}} to occur in 20% to 90% of women of reproductive age. It {{is the most common}} menstrual disorder. Typically it starts within a year of the first menstrual period. When there is no underlying cause often the pain improves with age or following having a child.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dysmenorrhea,</b> {{also known}} as painful periods, or menstrual cramps, is pain during {{menstruation}}. Its usual onset occurs around the time that menstruation begins. Symptoms typically last less than three days. The pain is usually in the pelvis or lower abdomen. Other symptoms may include back pain, diarrhea, or nausea.|$|E
25|$|It may {{be taken}} through {{prescription}} {{in the treatment of}} acute (short term) pain, and primary <b>dysmenorrhea</b> (period pains). Nimesulide should never be taken long-term, as for chronic conditions such as arthritis. This is due to its association with an increased risk of liver toxicity, including fulminant hepatic failure.|$|E
25|$|Spinal {{manipulation}} {{does not}} appear to be helpful. Although claims have been made for chiropractic care, under the theory that treating subluxations in the spine may decrease symptoms, a 2006 systematic review found that overall no evidence suggests that spinal manipulation is effective for treatment of primary and secondary <b>dysmenorrhea.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{frequency}} {{and severity of}} side effects {{and the availability of}} better tolerated alternatives make indometacin today a drug of second choice. Its use in acute gout attacks and in <b>dysmenorrhea</b> is well-established because in these indications the duration of treatment is limited to a few days only, therefore serious side effects are not likely to occur.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dysmenorrhea</b> occurs {{less often}} {{in those who}} {{exercise}} regularly {{and those who have}} children early in life. Treatment may include the use of a heating pad. Medications that may help include NSAIDs such as ibuprofen, hormonal birth control, and the IUD with progestogen. Taking vitamin B or magnesium may help. Evidence for yoga, acupuncture, and massage is insufficient. Surgery may be useful if certain underlying problems are present.|$|E
25|$|Dydrogesterone {{when used}} therapeutically {{is closely related}} to its {{physiological}} action on the neuroendocrine control of ovarian function, {{as well as on the}} endometrium. This is an indication in all cases of endogeneous progesterone deficiency – relative or absolute. The molecule was licensed for use in several indications, including threatened or recurrent miscarriage, dysfunctional bleeding, infertility due to luteal insufficiency, <b>dysmenorrhea,</b> endometriosis, secondary amenorrhea, irregular cycles, pre-menstrual syndrome and also as a hormone replacement therapy.|$|E
25|$|Ketorolac is {{used for}} {{short-term}} management of moderate to severe pain. It is usually not prescribed for longer than five days. Ketorolac is effective when administered with acetaminophen to control pain in neonates {{because it does not}} depress respiration as do opioids. Ketorolac is also an adjuvant to opioid medications and improves pain relief. It is also used to treat <b>dysmenorrhea.</b> Ketorolac is used to treat idiopathic pericarditis, where it reduces inflammation.|$|E
25|$|The {{diagnosis}} of <b>dysmenorrhea</b> is usually made simply on a medical history of menstrual pain that interferes with daily activities. However, {{there is no}} universally accepted gold standard technique for quantifying the severity of menstrual pains. Yet, there are quantification models, called menstrual symptometrics, {{that can be used}} to estimate the severity of menstrual pains as well as correlate them with pain in other parts of the body, menstrual bleeding and degree of interference with daily activities.|$|E
25|$|The Committee on the Review of Medicines {{carried out}} a review into benzodiazepines due to {{significant}} concerns of tolerance, drug dependence, benzodiazepine withdrawal problems, and other adverse effects and published the results in the British Medical Journal in March 1980. The committee found that benzodiazepines {{do not have any}} antidepressant or analgesic properties and are, therefore, unsuitable treatments for conditions such as depression, tension headaches, and <b>dysmenorrhea.</b> Benzodiazepines are also not beneficial in the treatment of psychosis. The committee also recommended against benzodiazepines for use in the treatment of anxiety or insomnia in children.|$|E
