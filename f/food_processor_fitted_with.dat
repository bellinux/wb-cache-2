50|$|An {{important}} {{distinguishing feature}} of the CS6400 which was not shared by the Sun SPARCcenter and SPARCserver was that each system was invariably equipped with an external System Service <b>Processor</b> (SSP) <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> a JTAG interface to configure the internal bus control card, the other systems have a JTAG interface {{but it is not}} routinely used. While the CS6400 strictly only requires an SSP when the configuration changes, (e.g. a CPU card is pulled for maintenance) some derivative designs, in particular the Sun Enterprise 10000, are useless without their matching SSP.|$|R

40|$|Japanese <b>food</b> <b>processors</b> {{have been}} faced with {{internal}} and external squeezes in recent years. Internally, the industry is faced with an overall demand ceiling due to Engel's law and a rapidly changing demand structure due to the "westernisation" of the Japanese consumers' taste. Externally, the industry is faced with increased import competition {{as a result of}} the liberalisation of the Japanese import market for agricultural and processed food products. Under these pressures, performance of the Japanese <b>food</b> <b>processors</b> in terms of productivity and profitability, is found to be below average, compared with Japanese manufacturing as a whole. Associated with the deteriorating productivity and profitability performance, Japanese <b>food</b> <b>processors</b> have stepped up their foreign direct investment (FDI) activities in the Asia-Pacific region. This development provides both challenge and opportunities for Australian producers and <b>food</b> <b>processors.</b> As most of the Japanese FDIs are either domestic market or export oriented, they are likely to pose serious competition for Australian firms. At the same time, through joint ventures with Japanese firms, the Australian <b>food</b> <b>processors</b> may acquire the inside knowledge of the Asian market which would enable them to capitalise on the enormous opportunities in the Asian food market.

5000|$|One of {{the first}} {{electric}} <b>food</b> <b>processors</b> was the Starmix, introduced by German company Electrostar in 1946. Although the basic unit resembled a simple blender, numerous accessories were available, including attachments for slicing bread, milk centrifuges and ice cream bowls. In a time when electric motors were expensive, they also developed the piccolo, where the <b>food</b> <b>processor's</b> base unit could drive a vacuum cleaner. In the 1960s, Albrecht von Goertz designed the Starmix MX3 <b>food</b> <b>processor.</b> Although the entire company was rebranded as Starmix in 1968 following {{the success of the}} processors, they later focused on vacuum cleaners and electric hand-dryers and the last mixer was produced around the year 2000. In France, the concept of a machine to process food began when a catering company salesman, Pierre Verdun, observed the large amount of time his clients spent in the kitchen chopping, shredding and mixing. He produced a simple but effective solution, a bowl with a revolving blade in the base. In 1960, this evolved into Robot-Coupe, a company established to manufacture commercial [...] "food processors" [...] for the catering industry. In the late 1960s, a commercial <b>food</b> <b>processor</b> driven by a powerful commercial induction motor was produced. The Magimix <b>food</b> <b>processor</b> arrived from France in the UK in 1974, beginning with the Model 1800. Then, a UK company Kenwood Limited started their own first Kenwood <b>Food</b> <b>Processor,</b> 'processor de- luxe,' in 1979.|$|R
