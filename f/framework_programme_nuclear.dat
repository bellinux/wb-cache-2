40|$|Degradation of B_ 4 C {{absorber}} rods {{during a}} beyond design accident {{in a nuclear}} power reactor may be a safety concern. Among others, the integral test QUENCH- 07 is performed in the FZK QUENCH facility and supported by analytical work within the Euratom Fifth <b>Framework</b> <b>Programme</b> on <b>Nuclear</b> Fission Safety to get a more profound database. Since the test differed substantially from previous QUENCH tests, much more work {{had to be done}} for pretest calculations than usual to guarantee the safety of the facility and to derive the test protocol. Several institutions shared in this work with different computer code systems, as used for nuclear reactor safety analyses. Due to this effort, problems could be identified and solved, leading to several modifications of the originally planned test conduct, until a feasible test protocol could be derived and recommended. All calculations showed the same trends. Especially the high temperatures and hence the small safety margin for the facility were a concern. In this report, contributions of various authors, engaged in this work, are presented. The test QUENCH- 07 and the related computational support by the engaged institutions were co-financed by the European Community under the Euratom Fifth <b>Framework</b> <b>Programme</b> on <b>Nuclear</b> Fission Safety 1998 - 2002 (COLOSS Project, contract No. FIKS-CT- 1999 - 00002).

40|$|The European Commission in Brussels {{supported}} a joint project on Deflagration-to-Detonation Transition (DDT) studies for hydrogen safety within the <b>framework</b> <b>programme</b> on <b>nuclear</b> fission safety. The project was {{initiated by the}} Forschungszentrum Juelich {{based on the results}} of a pilot project. The following main project was coordinated by the Freie Universitaet Berlin involving seven european partners. The partners came from universities, research centers and industry, as follows: FU-Berlin, RWTH-Aachen, CNRS-Marseille, IPSN-Saclay, FZ-Juelich, FZ-Karlsruhe, and NNC-Knutsford, which worked closely together. The working period was two years (1997 - 1998). The aim of the project was to develop models and criteria for prediction of deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT) in hydrogen-air-steam systems under severe accident conditions. The results obtained are documented in this final report, which was finished in 1999. The report consists of seven chapters, concerning: - Introduction -Experimental Investigations - Modelling and Numerics - Validation - Mitigation -Further Deliverables - Summary and Conclusion. The final report presents special experimental, theoretical, and computational aspects of the complex DDT phenomena for hydrogen safety studies, and it should be a solid basis for end user applications and further developments.

Beta-delayed proton {{emission}} from Mg {{has been}} measured at ISOLDE, CERN, with the ISOLDE Decay Station (IDS) setup including both charged-particle and gamma-ray detection capabilities. A total of 27 delayed proton branches were measured including seven so far unobserved. An updated decay scheme, including three new resonances above the proton separation energy in Na and more precise resonance energies, is presented. Beta-decay feeding to two resonances above the Isobaric Analogue State (IAS) in Na is observed. This may allow {{studies of the}} 4032. 9 (2. 4) keV resonance in Ne through the beta decay of Mg, which {{is important for the}} astrophysically relevant reaction O(α,γ) Ne. Beta-delayed protons were used to obtain a more precise value for the half-life of Mg, 91. 4 (1. 0) ms. © SIF, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg, 2016 This work has been supported by the European Commision within the Seventh <b>Framework</b> <b>Programme</b> “European <b>Nuclear</b> Science and Applications Research”, contract no. 262010 (ENSAR), by the Spanish research agency under number FPA 2012 - 32443, FPA 2015 - 64969 -P and FPA 2015 - 65035 -P and by the Romanian IFA Grant CERN/ISOLDE.
