5|$|A {{somewhat}} different design of cutting tool that can achieve the irregular hole or outer {{profile of a}} broach is called a rotary broach or wobble broach. One of the biggest advantages {{to this type of}} broaching {{is that it does not}} require a broaching machine, but <b>instead</b> <b>is</b> used on lathes, milling machines, screw machines or Swiss lathes.|$|E
5|$|Jahangir's Quadrangle {{occupies}} the northeastern {{corner of the}} fort. Though named for Jahangir, construction on the site began in 1617 or 1618 {{during the reign of}} Akbar, but was completed in 1620 under Jahangir. Akbar's syncretic style is noted in the quadrangle, as it employs column brackets carved in the form of animals. The quadrangle's layout differs from other Mughal quadrangles which are based upon the layout of a Persian paradise garden, and <b>instead</b> <b>is</b> formed by concentric rectangles with a fountain in its centre.|$|E

5|$|Male {{cocks-of-the-rock}} are polygamous, {{and have}} nothing to do with nesting once mating is done. The male’s energy <b>instead</b> <b>is</b> devoted to very elaborate display rituals that show off its magnificent plumage. These displays take place in communal leks, where males gather to challenge rivals and beckon the females. The males are easily disturbed, so their behavior is not easy to see. One study reported that the display activity is dependent on light intensity, with the morning display period occurring during the same light intensity level as the afternoon period.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, Reverend Orison releases Donnie Pfaster, Scully's former kidnapper, from jail {{in the hopes of}} passing judgment on him. What he discovers <b>instead</b> <b>is</b> that he has released pure evil, and it’s headed for Scully.|$|E
5|$|The smaller {{of the two}} cocks-of-the-rock, {{the male}} Guianan takes the lesser part in breeding. It is {{polygynous}} and {{has nothing to do}} with nesting once mating is done. The male's energy <b>instead</b> <b>is</b> devoted to very elaborate display rituals that show off its magnificent plumage. These displays take place in communal leks, where 40 or more males may gather to challenge rivals and beckon to the females.|$|E

5|$|In 1994, tomato systemin {{was found}} to bind to a 50KDa protein in the cell {{membrane}} of tomato. The protein has a structure similar to proteases of the Kex2p-like prohormone convertases. This led Schaller and Ryan {{to suggest that it}} is not a receptor, but <b>instead</b> <b>is</b> involved in the processing of ProSys into the active form, or the degradation of Sys. Synthetic forms of tomato systemin, with substituted amino acids at the predicted dibasic cleavage site, remained stable in cell cultures for longer than the native form. Later studies have noted that the enzymes responsible for processing ProSys remain unidentified. No further research has been reported on the 50KDa protein to date, and the gene has not been identified.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, an overdensity {{of stars}} in the region was {{announced}} to be the Canis Major Dwarf, the closest satellite galaxy to Earth. However, there remains debate over whether it represents a disrupted dwarf galaxy or in fact {{a variation in the}} thin and thick disk and spiral arm populations of the Milky Way. Investigation of the area yielded only ten RR Lyrae variables—consistent with the Milky Way's halo and thick disk populations rather than a separate dwarf spheroidal galaxy. On the other hand, a globular cluster in Puppis, NGC 2298—which appears {{to be part of the}} Canis Major dwarf system—is extremely metal-poor, suggesting it did not arise from the Milky Way's thick disk, and <b>instead</b> <b>is</b> of extragalactic origin.|$|E
5|$|Little Bee is {{detained}} {{and quickly}} deported back to Nigeria, where she believes {{she will be}} killed. Lawrence uses his Home Office connections to track Little Bee's deportation details, and Sarah and Charlie are able to accompany her back home. Sarah believes that Little Bee will be safe {{as long as she}} is present, and together they begin collecting stories for a book Andrew had begun, and which Sarah intends to finish on his behalf, about the atrocities committed in the Nigerian oil conflict. During a trip to the same beach where they first encountered one another, soldiers arrive to take Little Bee away. Despite being captured, Little Bee is not dispirited, and <b>instead</b> <b>is</b> ultimately hopeful at the sight of Charlie playing happily with a group of Nigerian children.|$|E

5|$|Seeking vengeance for Kureha's death, Ryu learns from Murai {{that the}} raiders were from Vigoor, so he stows away on an airship {{bound for the}} empire. Fighting {{his way through the}} streets of its capital city, Tairon, Ryu faces several bosses {{including}} the three Greater Fiends. He defeats Alma in a battle that wrecks the city, but leaves her to Rachel's mercy. Conversely, Rachel cannot bring herself to kill her sister, and <b>instead</b> <b>is</b> taken by Doku, who prepares to sacrifice her in a ritual to enhance Alma's power. With Alma's help Ryu rescues Rachel and destroys Doku's spirit, but with his dying breath Doku casts the blood curse on Ryu. The only way for Ryu to lift the curse is to kill the emperor, so he storms the palace, defeating Marbus who bars his way to the emperor's personal realm. Two successive boss fights must be completed to destroy the Emperor and reclaim the Dark Dragon Blade—once this is accomplished his realm starts to destruct. Ryu must then be maneuvered up a series of ledges to escape, but in the process he loses his grip on the Dark Dragon Blade.|$|E
5|$|The Odyssey {{consists}} of a black, white, and brown oblong box connected by wires to two rectangular controllers. The primary console box connects to the television set through an included switchbox, which allows the player to switch the television input between the Odyssey and the regular television input cable, and presents itself like a television channel. The controllers, which are designed {{to sit on a}} flat surface, contain one button marked Reset {{on the top of the}} controller and three knobs: one on the right side of the controller, and two on the left with one extending from the other. The reset button does not reset the game, but <b>instead</b> <b>is</b> used by different games to reset individual elements, such as making a player's dot visible after it is turned off during a game. The system can be powered by six C batteries, which were included. An optional AC power supply was sold separately. The Odyssey lacks sound capability and can only display monochrome white shapes on a blank black screen.|$|E
5|$|The SABRE engine design aims {{to avoid}} the {{historic}} weight-performance issue by {{using some of the}} liquid hydrogen fuel to cool helium within a closed-cycle precooler, which quickly reduces the temperature of the air at the inlet. The air is then used for combustion in a similar manner to a conventional jet engine; once the helium has left the pre-cooler, it is further heated by the products of the pre-burner, giving it enough energy to drive the turbine and the liquid hydrogen pump. As a consequence of the air being cooled at all speeds, the jet can be built of light alloys and the weight is roughly halved. Additionally, more fuel can be burnt at high speeds. Beyond Mach5.5, the air would normally become unusably hot despite the cooling; accordingly, the air inlet is closed upon attaining this speed and the engine <b>instead</b> <b>is</b> solely fed via on-board liquid oxygen and hydrogen fuel, as in a traditional rocket.|$|E

5|$|The {{historian}} R. R. Darlington {{argued that}} the Vita was written right after Æthelwig's death, but another historian, David Knowles, wrote that it probably was written about 1110, possibly by the prior of Evesham, Dominic. Antonia Gransden, another historian, agrees with Darlington, and finds it {{more likely to have}} been written shortly after Æthelwig's death. The work itself is not a hagiography, in that it doesn't attribute any miracles to Æthelwig, and <b>instead</b> <b>is</b> a mix of charters and narratives. Nor does it give any details on Æthelwig's early life or his selection as abbot. A large portion of the work is a detailed list of lands acquired by Æthelwig for the abbey, and concludes with a short description of the abbott's death.|$|E
