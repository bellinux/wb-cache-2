5000|$|A <b>ball</b> <b>head</b> {{utilizes}} a <b>ball</b> joint {{to allow}} movement of all axes of rotation {{from a single}} point. Some <b>ball</b> <b>heads</b> also have a separate panoramic rotation axis {{on the base of}} the head. The head has two main parts, the ball, which attaches to the camera and the socket, which attaches to the tripod. The camera is attached to the ball via quick release plate, or a simple UNC 1/4"-20 [...] screw. The socket is where the ball rotates in, and also contains the controls for locking the ball. The socket has a slot on the side, to allow the camera to be rotated to the portrait orientation. <b>Ball</b> <b>heads</b> come in varying styles of complexity. Some have only one control for both ball and pan lock. While others have individual controls for the ball, pan, and also <b>ball</b> friction. <b>Ball</b> <b>heads</b> are used when a free-flow movement of the camera is needed. They are also more stable and can hold heavier loads, than pan-tilt <b>heads.</b> However, <b>ball</b> <b>heads</b> have the disadvantage that only one control is available to allow or prevent movement of all axes of rotation, so if the camera is tilted on one axis, there may be a risk of tilting on the other axes as well. When a movement of one, or two axes or rotation is needed, a pan-tilt head is used.|$|R

40|$|Bio{{mechanics}} {{is an area}} {{of science}} devoted {{to the study of the}} mechanics (i. e., the physical laws) of biological systems at the cellular, tissue and whole organism levels. In sports biomechanics, the description of movement (kinematics) and the forces that produce movement (kinetics) are studied in pursuit of optimizing physical performance whilst minimizing injury risk. An understanding of sports biomechanics is particularly important in soccer because physical laws govern players 2 ̆ 7 abilities to move rapidly to catch or evade an opponent, jump to <b>head</b> a <b>ball,</b> apply forces to the ball to pass with high accuracy or velocity, or create swerve on a kicked or <b>headed</b> <b>ball.</b> Therefore, an understanding of biomechanical principles is required to improve performance, from beginners to advance players...|$|R

No one actually dies but limbs are broken, jaws shattered, faces are trod on, skulls fractured, ribs broken, and so on. Even buildings do not always survive such an attack. He picks up many injuries himself, but being shot, getting many cuts with Bowie <b>knives,</b> <b>head</b> bashed with numerous objects, having his ear chewed, scratched up by a mountain lion he then threw into {{a room full of}} feuding men and such are just minor nuisances to him.|$|R
