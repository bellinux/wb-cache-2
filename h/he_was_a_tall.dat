25|$|Pickering {{learned his}} {{football}} at Barnsley Grammar School and Mortomley St. Saviours {{from where he}} came directly to United {{at the age of}} 17, in 1925. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tall,</b> long striding attacking player, and was instantly seen as a successor to Billy Gillespie at inside-forward. Jack was a part-time player, first working as a bookmaker and then an accountant.|$|E
25|$|The {{son of a}} Latvian-born {{construction}} worker, Zesers ascended {{quickly to}} first-class ranks. He was selected {{at the age of}} 17 years and 256 days to represent South Australia against Tasmania in late 1984, whilst still a student at Marden High School after less than a year in grade cricket. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tall</b> fast bowler, and demonstrated all-round potential when he scored 85 and took 6/76 in a Sheffield Shield match against Victoria in his debut season. This earned him selection on the 198485 Australian Under-19 team to tour Sri Lanka and India. His efforts in claiming 11 wickets at an average of just 12, put him into contention for higher honours in the limited overs format. By the age of 21, Zesers had collected more than 100 first class wickets, the only person to have achieved this feat.|$|E
25|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tall</b> and bulky {{person with}} a {{prominent}} stomach and invariably played with a clean shaven head without any hat or cap {{or any kind of}} head gear. He always wore very loose pants and after batting for a while or keeping wicket for sometime his shirt will be hanging out of the trousers and somebody must tuck it in, now and then. He had a rather ugly and uncouth stance at the wicket as he held his bat very low and bent his body forward so much that his head was practically in line with the top of the wickets. Those who watched him from the on side could only see his prominent hind portion of the body sticking up while the head, bat and the rest of Dilawar Hussain were hardly visible. However, he had a very sound defense and so {{it was very difficult to}} get him out. He was the most selfish batsman that I have ever seen.|$|E

25|$|After he left school, {{he passed}} the {{entrance}} exam to the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, and, in 1909, was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Regiment of Artillery. He then joined the 138th Battery Royal Field Artillery. He {{wanted to be a}} pilot so he paid for private lessons in the Bristol Flying School at Brooklands and gained his aviators' certificate on 12 July 1912. He met Agatha Miller when he was invited to a ball on 12 October 1912 by Lady Clifford at her grand home Ugbrooke House in Chudleigh. A description of her meeting with Christie is given by Agatha in her autobiography:Christie came my way quite soon in the dance. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tall,</b> fair young man, with crisp curly hair, a rather interesting nose, turned up not down, and a great air of careless confidence about him. He was introduced to me, asked for a couple of dances, and said that his friend Griffiths had told him to look out for me. We got on together very well; he danced splendidly and I danced again several more times with him. I enjoyed the evening thoroughly.|$|E

[...] The New York Times spoke of him on his arrival in the Senate as [...] "the square-jawed, black eyed, lithe young man from the West" [...] and continued that [...] "The Senator's voice is his most impressive asset. Liquid and soft in quality when he is talking dispassionately, it is as harsh and rasping as a file when he is aroused." ...|$|E

2500|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tall,</b> heavily built man; in {{his later}} years, he tended towards stoutness, {{and he had a}} mass of about [...] when he died. He was fond of pomp and {{ceremony}} and insisted on being treated with respect at all times. [...] Highly sensitive to criticism, he hated having his authority challenged and tended to browbeat his political opponents. He had very little sense of humour and was greatly offended when a journalist playfully referred to him as the [...] "Commissioner for Crown Sands".|$|E
2500|$|When Mrs. Rodenhurst {{told me of}} {{the advent}} to Shrewsbury of Wainwright, I asked her {{if he was in}} his room, or where. 'No,' she said, 'he went out about an hour ago. I think you'll find him in the King's Arms.' I went to the King's Arms and made my very first {{appearance}} in the bar-parlour of a public-house. The room was empty save for one man, dressed in blue serge, with a shrewd lean face. I recognised him. I had seen him playing for Yorkshire at Old Trafford. I introduced myself. 'I'm the assistant pro.,' I explained. 'Art thou?' he replied, 'well, then 'ave a drink wi' me.' I told him I didn't drink — only ginger ale. 'Christ,' he said, 'tha'rt a reight bloody cricketer.' <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tall</b> man, who walked as though he didn't care a damn for anybody. There was something sinister about him. Every night he got drunk as a matter of course, quietly and masterfully. One day he backed a winner at a glorious price, and towards eleven o'clock that night he and the drill-sergeant of the school arrived arm-in-arm (supporting one another) in the sitting-room of our lodgings. Very gravely Ted introduced me to the drill-sergeant, whom of course I knew very well. The drill-sergeant as gravely introduced Ted to me, then taking my arm, he whispered rather noisily in my ear, 'I'm 'fraid 'e's a l'il drunk, so I've jus' bror him h-home.' Whereupon Ted dissolved into helpless laughter and said, 'My dear sersergeant, don't be 'diculous[...] [...] [...] Bror me home? Why, you ole fool, it's me that's bror you 'ome.' Then (aside), 'E's jus' a l'il drunk, so I've bror him home.' The sergeant hooted with glee. 'Bless m' soul,' he said, 'Ted; jus' lis'en t'me. If you'd bror me home, this would be my lodgin's, see? I would be 'ome, not you. See? But this is your lodgin's—so I mus' 'ave bror you 'ome. See?' ...|$|E
