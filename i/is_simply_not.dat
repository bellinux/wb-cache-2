5|$|Desperate for {{something}} to put on, Leslie tells Mark that he should propose to Ann {{in front of the}} camera and he agrees. Not long after, however, Ann confides in Leslie that she wants to break up with Mark, citing that he <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> <b>not</b> the one. Meanwhile, April (Aubrey Plaza) tries to make Andy jealous by flirting with someone over the phone, but it backfires when it turns out to be Joe (Kirk Fox) from the Pawnee sewer department. Andy is forced to kick Joe out of the studio when he actually arrives to bring April to his van.|$|E
5|$|Hospices: While late {{referral}} to hospice {{is a much}} more prevalent problem than early referral, some hospice providers will hesitate to admit patients to hospice (or they may de-certify them from hospice too early) due to scrutiny from Medicare for patients deemed to be on hospice too long. After a patient has been on hospice for six months, Medicare is more aggressive in auditing the hospice for inappropriate payment of services. For some hospices this <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> <b>not</b> worth the trouble, and patients are screened very carefully prior to admission.|$|E
5|$|Excluding a few {{controversial}} claims, scientists {{agree that}} all non-avian dinosaurs became extinct at the K–Pg boundary. The dinosaur fossil record {{has been interpreted}} to show both a decline in diversity and no decline in diversity {{during the last few}} million years of the Cretaceous, {{and it may be that}} the quality of the dinosaur fossil record <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> <b>not</b> good enough to permit researchers to distinguish between the options. There is no evidence that late Maastrichtian non-avian dinosaurs could burrow, swim, or dive, which suggests they were unable to shelter themselves from the worst parts of any environmental stress that occurred at the K–Pg boundary. It is possible that small dinosaurs (other than birds) did survive, but they would have been deprived of food, as herbivorous dinosaurs would have found plant material scarce and carnivores would have quickly found prey in short supply.|$|E

25|$|Colin McGinn {{argues that}} the Chinese room {{provides}} strong evidence that the hard problem of consciousness is fundamentally insoluble. The argument, to be clear, is not about whether a machine can be conscious, but about whether it (or anything else for that matter) can {{be shown to be}} conscious. It is plain that any other method of probing the occupant of a Chinese room has the same difficulties in principle as exchanging questions and answers in Chinese. It <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> <b>not</b> possible to divine whether a conscious agency or some clever simulation inhabits the room.|$|E

25|$|This {{claim is}} widely disputed, even by pilots in his unit.

Further, {{a series of tests}} made by Karl Doetsch at the behest of Willy Messerschmitt found that the plane became uncontrollable above Mach 0.86, and at Mach 0.9 would nose over into a dive that could not be recovered from. Post-war tests by the RAF confirmed these results, with the slight modification that the maximum speed using new instruments was found to be Mach 0.84, rather than Mach 0.86.|$|E
25|$|On 17 March 2006, the Met was {{threatened}} with legal action by Deputy Assistant Commissioner, Brian Paddick. In {{evidence to the}} IPCC, Paddick had stated that a member of Sir Ian's private office team believed the wrong man had been targeted just six hours after the shooting, contrary to the official line taken at the time. When this information became public, Scotland Yard issued a statement that the officer making the claim (Paddick) 'has categorically denied this in his interview with, and statement to, the IPCC investigators'. The statement continued that they 'were satisfied that whatever {{the reasons for this}} suggestion being made, it <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> <b>not</b> true.' Paddick's interpretation of this statement was that it accused him of lying.|$|E
25|$|India needs {{trillions of}} dollars to build its infrastructure, hospitals, housing and schools for its growing population. The Indian economy is small, with limited surplus capital. The {{government}} is already operating on budget deficits. It <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> <b>not</b> possible for Indian investors or the government to fund this expansion, job creation and growth at the rate India needs. Global investment capital through FDI is necessary. Beyond capital, the Indian retail industry needs knowledge and global integration. Global retail leaders, {{some of which are}} partly owned by people of Indian origin, can bring this knowledge. Global integration can potentially open export markets for Indian farmers and producers. Walmart, for example, expects to source and export some $1 billion worth of goods from India every year, since it came into Indian wholesale retail market.|$|E

25|$|Some {{studies suggest}} that {{reversals}} back to the ancestral free-living condition have occurred, but this evidence has been extensively challenged because: 1) the data exhibits taxa sampling bias and model dependency, 2) most non-mycorrhizal taxa lie within strongly AM clades, rather than EcM ones, and 3) the derived EcM condition is specialized, and would likely have given an ecological advantage that reversion to saprotrophy would not have. Furthermore, Hibbett and Matheny performed Bayesian relaxed molecular clock analyses yielding results that indicate that an ancestral EcM condition that was subsequently lost multiple times <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> <b>not</b> parsimonious. These reversals to a saprotrophic mode are impractical given that the host plants involved in the EcM symbioses (Pinaceae and rosids) had not yet evolved when the studied class Agaricomycetes first appeared.|$|E
25|$|On April 28, 2016, Massport {{approved}} {{funding for}} the installation of a Category IIIb instrument landing system at ORH. The geographic location of the airport, {{on top of the}} tallest hill in the city reaching approximately 1,000 feet above sea level, leaves Worcester on average with 40 more days of fog a year than nearby Boston. The installation of the Category IIIb landing system will allow aircraft to land and depart in virtually all weather conditions. There are no Category IIIc airports in the United States; it <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> <b>not</b> allowed for safety reasons. The installation of the landing system also will include a jug-handle taxiway at the approach end of Runway 11. Construction has begun and the ILS is expected to be operational sometime in late 2017. Once it is completed, new service with JetBlue Airways will begin to John F. Kennedy International Airport.|$|E
25|$|The Tennessee Constitution {{requires}} each {{county to}} elect a sheriff to a four-year term. In all Tennessee counties except one, the sheriff is an official with full police powers, usually county-wide, although Tennessee sheriffs and their deputies generally perform the patrol portion of their duties primarily in unincorporated areas of their counties if the municipalities have their own police departments. The {{exception to the rule}} is Davidson County. In Davidson County, the sheriff has the primary responsibility of serving civil process and jail functions without the common law powers to keep the peace. Protection of the peace is instead the responsibility of the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department under the county's Metropolitan Charter. The Metropolitan Charter did not remove the Davidson County Sheriff's status as a Law Enforcement officer however. It <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> <b>not</b> his or her primary function as it was prior to the consolidation of the City of Nashville and Davidson County.|$|E

25|$|Many {{specific}} {{points by}} Ehrman {{concentrate on what}} may {{be regarded as the}} 'embarrassments' and 'failures' of the various depictions of Jesus Christ found in the gospels and the works of Paul which point to an account based on a real person that got embellished rather than a completely made up figure. He notes that Jews in the first century AD expected their Messiah to come from Bethlehem while Jesus is described as growing up in Nazareth, a dilemma that <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> <b>not</b> addressed in the Gospel of Mark (which has no nativity account) even though it is regarded as the earliest gospel. The betrayal of Jesus by Judas is another example, as critics of early Christianity found it strange that the Messiah would display the lack of personal awareness and foresight even to keep his close followers in line. Ehrman states that such things would make sense for a historical Jesus whom multiple people believed grew up, lived, and died in a certain time and place versus a purely mythological figure with malleable personal details.|$|E
25|$|Nervous system {{injuries}} affect over 90,000 {{people every}} year. It {{is estimated that}} spinal cord injuries alone affect 10,000 each year. As {{a result of this}} high incidence of neurological injuries, nerve regeneration and repair, a subfield of neural tissue engineering, is becoming a rapidly growing field dedicated to the discovery of new ways to recover nerve functionality after injury. The nervous system is divided into two parts: the central nervous system, which consists of the brain and spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system, which consists of cranial and spinal nerves along with their associated ganglia. While the peripheral nervous system has an intrinsic ability for repair and regeneration, the central nervous system is, for the most part, incapable of self-repair and regeneration. There is currently no treatment for recovering human nerve function after injury to the central nervous system. In addition, multiple attempts at nerve re-growth across the PNS-CNS transition have not been successful. There <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> <b>not</b> enough knowledge about regeneration in the central nervous system. In addition, although the peripheral nervous system has the capability for regeneration, much research still {{needs to be done to}} optimize the environment for maximum regrowth potential. Neuroregeneration is important clinically, as it is part of the pathogenesis of many diseases, including multiple sclerosis.|$|E
25|$|Glass {{container}} manufacture in {{the developed}} world is a mature market business. World demand for flat glass was approximately 52 million tonnes in 2009. The United States, Europe and China account for 75% of demand, with China's consumption having increased from 20% in the early 1990s to 50%. Glass container manufacture is also a geographical business; the product is heavy and large in volume, and the major raw materials (sand, soda ash and limestone) are generally readily available, therefore production facilities need to be located close to their markets. A typical glass furnace holds hundreds of tonnes of molten glass, and so it <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> <b>not</b> practical to shut it down every night, or in fact in any period short of a month. Factories therefore run 24 hours a day 7 days a week. This means that there is little opportunity to either increase or decrease production rates by more than a few percent. New furnaces and forming machines cost {{tens of millions of dollars}} and require at least 18 months of planning. Given this fact, and the fact that there are usually more products than machine lines means that products are sold from stock. The marketing/production challenge is therefore to be able to predict demand both in the short 4- to 12-week term and over the 24- to 48-month-long term. Factories are generally sized to service the requirements of a city; in developed countries there is usually a factory per 1–2 million people. A typical factory will produce 1–3 million containers a day.|$|E
