5|$|The vowels of Ulster Irish {{are more}} <b>divergent</b> {{and are not}} {{discussed}} in this article.|$|E
5|$|Another {{example of}} a <b>divergent</b> {{electron}} transport chain is the alternative oxidase, which is found in plants, {{as well as some}} fungi, protists, and possibly some animals. This enzyme transfers electrons directly from ubiquinol to oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Another method uses provenance: for instance, all {{denominations}} {{that ultimately}} trace their history {{back to the}} LDS Church in Utah are organized as one factional group. <b>Divergent</b> Paths of the Restoration—a reference work on this subject—follows this approach.|$|E
5|$|Heathrow {{and other}} British {{airports}} used a highly <b>divergent</b> adaptation of Bembo for many years. Designed by Shelley Winters and named BAA Bembo or BAA Sign, {{it was very}} bold with a high x-height.|$|E
5|$|Three <b>divergent</b> {{lineages}} {{found in}} Yunnan province in China that are commonly marketed and sold as B. edulis (and are actually {{more closely related}} to B. aereus) were described in 2013 as B. bainiugan, B. meiweiniuganjun and B. shiyong.|$|E
5|$|After {{the initial}} {{sequence}} of rocks has been deposited, the rock units can be deformed and/or metamorphosed. Deformation typically occurs {{as a result}} of horizontal shortening, horizontal extension, or side-to-side (strike-slip) motion. These structural regimes broadly relate to convergent boundaries, <b>divergent</b> boundaries, and transform boundaries, respectively, between tectonic plates.|$|E
5|$|As well as <b>divergent</b> {{evolution}} of function (and even the triad's nucleophile), catalytic triads show {{some of the}} best examples of convergent evolution. Chemical constraints on catalysis have led to the same catalytic solution independently evolving in at least 23 separate superfamilies. Their mechanism of action is consequently one of the best studied in biochemistry.|$|E
5|$|Attempts {{to generalize}} {{ordinary}} quantum field theories, used in elementary particle physics to describe fundamental interactions, {{so as to}} include gravity have led to serious problems. Some have argued that at low energies, this approach proves successful, in that it results in an acceptable effective (quantum) field theory of gravity. At very high energies, however, the perturbative results are badly <b>divergent</b> and lead to models devoid of predictive power ("perturbative non-renormalizability").|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{specialized}} and rare circumstances {{required for a}} biological structure to fossilize, logic dictates that known fossils represent {{only a small percentage}} of all life-forms that ever existed—and that each discovery represents only a snapshot of evolution. The transition itself can only be illustrated and corroborated by transitional fossils, which never demonstrate an exact half-way point between clearly <b>divergent</b> forms.|$|E
5|$|Biological {{structures}} or sequences {{in different}} taxa are homologous {{if they are}} derived from a common ancestor. Homology thus implies <b>divergent</b> evolution. For example, many insects (such as dragonflies) possess two pairs of flying wings. In beetles, the first pair of wings {{has evolved into a}} pair of hard wing covers, while in Dipteran flies the second pair of wings has evolved into small halteres used for balance.|$|E
5|$|By 1915 when Tolkien {{was writing}} his first elven poems, the words elf, fairy and gnome had many <b>divergent</b> and {{contradictory}} associations. Tolkien had been gently warned against {{using the term}} 'fairy', which John Garth supposes {{may have been due}} to the word becoming increasingly used to indicate homosexuality, although despite this warning Tolkien continued to use it.|$|E
5|$|<b>Divergent</b> {{evolution}} of active site residues is slow, due to strong chemical constraints. Nevertheless, some protease superfamilies have evolved from one nucleophile to another. This {{can be inferred}} when a superfamily (with the same fold) contains families that use different nucleophiles. Such nucleophile switches have occurred several times during evolutionary history, however the mechanisms by which this happen are still unclear.|$|E
5|$|The {{opposite}} of convergence is <b>divergent</b> evolution, where related species evolve different traits. Convergent evolution {{is similar to}} but different from parallel evolution. Parallel evolution occurs when two independent but similar species evolve {{in the same direction}} and thus independently acquire similar characteristics; for instance, gliding frogs have evolved in parallel from multiple types of tree frog.|$|E
5|$|The {{sophistication of}} the active site network causes {{residues}} involved in catalysis (and residues in contact with these) to be highly evolutionarily conserved. However, there are examples of <b>divergent</b> evolution in catalytic triads, both in the reaction catalysed, and the residues used in catalysis. The triad remains {{the core of the}} active site, but it is evolutionarily adapted to serve different functions.|$|E
5|$|The state {{government}} {{made the decision}} to decommission Fremantle Prison in 1983, but it remained in operation until 30 November 1991. Prisoners were moved to a new metropolitan maximum security prison at Casuarina. There were <b>divergent</b> views in the community over the site's future, whether it should be preserved or redeveloped. The ultimate decision was for conservation of the prison, but allowing for the buildings to be adapted for reuse by the community.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two major}} but <b>divergent</b> {{scientific}} articles about jet stream power. Archer & Caldeira claim that the Earth's jet streams could generate a total power of 1700 terawatts (TW) and that the climatic impact of harnessing this amount would be negligible. However, Miller, Gans, & Kleidon claim that the jet streams could generate a total power of only 7.5 TW and that the climatic impact would be catastrophic.|$|E
5|$|Various immunoassays for T. cruzi are {{available}} {{and can be used}} to distinguish among strains (zymodemes of T.cruzi with <b>divergent</b> pathogenicities). These tests include: detecting complement fixation, indirect hemagglutination, indirect fluorescence assays, radioimmunoassays, and ELISA. Alternatively, diagnosis and strain identification can be made using polymerase chain reaction (PCR).|$|E
5|$|Wastek (also spelled Huastec and Huaxtec) {{is spoken}} in the Mexican states of Veracruz and San Luis Potosí by around 110,000 people. It {{is the most}} <b>divergent</b> of modern Mayan {{language}}s. Chicomuceltec was a language related to Wastek and spoken in Chiapas that became extinct some time before 1982.|$|E
5|$|Atman is the {{predominantly}} discussed {{topic in the}} Upanishads, but they express two distinct, somewhat <b>divergent</b> themes. Some state that Brahman (Highest Reality, Universal Principle, Being-Consciousness-Bliss) is identical with Atman, while others state Atman is part of Brahman but not identical. This ancient debate flowered into various dual, non-dual theories in Hinduism. The Brahmasutra by Badarayana (~ 100 BCE) synthesized and unified these somewhat conflicting theories, stating that Atman and Brahman are different in some respects particularly during the state of ignorance, but at the deepest level and {{in the state of}} self-realization, Atman and Brahman are identical, non-different.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{similarities}} in morphology, tooth shape, and behavior, the closest {{relatives of the}} spinner shark were originally {{believed to be the}} blacktip shark and the graceful shark (C. amblyrhynchoides). However, this interpretation was not supported by Gavin Naylor's 1992 allozyme analysis, which suggested that these similarities are the product of convergent evolution and that the closest relative of the spinner shark is the copper shark (C. brachyurus). In a 2007 ribosomal DNA study, the spinner shark was found to be the most genetically <b>divergent</b> of all the requiem shark species examined save for the tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier), being less related to other Carcharhinus species than the lemon shark (Negaprion brevirostris).|$|E
5|$|Implementation of the Bland–Allison Act {{did not end}} {{calls for}} free silver. The 1880s saw a steep decline in the prices of grain and other {{agricultural}} commodities. Silver advocates argued that this dropoff, which caused the price of grain to fall below its cost of production, {{was caused by the}} failure of the government to adequately increase the money supply, which had remained steady on a per capita basis. Advocates of the gold standard attributed the decline to advances in production and transportation. The late 19th century saw <b>divergent</b> views in economics as the laissez-faire orthodoxy was questioned by younger economists, and both sides found ample support for their views from theorists.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, biologically active hydroxyproline-rich glycopeptides were {{isolated}} from tobacco which activated {{the production of}} protease inhibitors {{in a similar way}} to systemin in tomatoes. Although they are structurally unrelated to systemins, their similar function resulted in them being named hydroxyproline-rich systemins (HypSys). Following the initial discovery other HypSys peptides were found in tomato, Petunia and black nightshade. In 2007, HypSys were found outside the Solanaceae, in sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) and sequence analysis identified HypSys analogs in poplar (Populus trichocarpa) and coffee (Coffea canephora). Systemins are highly conserved between species, whereas HypSys are more <b>divergent</b> but all contain a conserved proline or hydroxyproline-rich central domain.|$|E
5|$|In {{northern}} and western Africa, the desiccation and humectation {{of the modern}} Sahara desert has led to very fruitful archaeological sites, followed by completely barren soil, only to once again show evidence of population when the aridity of the region was ameliorated. Preservation in these two regions are alternately superb and lamentable, yet the sites that have been uncovered document the adaptive nature of early hominins to climatically unstable environments. Researchers such as Marean and Assefa consider the historic distinction between northern Africa {{and the rest of}} Africa, as though they represent <b>divergent</b> cultural developments, an arbitrary and antiquated distinction.|$|E
5|$|Late on September26, shear {{began to}} relax and deep {{convection}} redeveloped around the center of circulation and the forward motion of the storm began to increase. Several hours later, the storm made a sudden northwest jump due to a passing shortwave trough. By this time, Kyle was just below hurricane-status, with sustained winds up to 70mph (110km/h). Continued organization led to the storm attaining hurricane intensity at 1200UTC on September27 while located about 345mi (555km) west of Bermuda. Upon attaining this intensity, the storm became embedded within an area strong, <b>divergent,</b> upper-level winds. Increasing in forward motion, the center of Kyle was located along the southwestern edge of the deep convection.|$|E
5|$|Mesoscale {{convective}} systems, {{which can}} evolve into tropical cyclones, form along {{areas such as}} tropical waves or easterly waves which progress westward along monsoon troughs and the Intertropical Convergence Zone in regions of ample low level moisture, convergent surface winds, and <b>divergent</b> winds aloft. This typically occurs north of the equator from Africa across the Atlantic and eastern Pacific oceans, as well as across the northwest and southwest Pacific oceans, from Australia eastward into Oceania, the Indian ocean, Indonesia, and from southeast Brazil into the southern Atlantic ocean. It is also noted on occasion in the southeast Pacific ocean mild to cool ENSO years, outside of El Niño. More intense systems form over land than water.|$|E
5|$|More recently, it {{has been}} {{suspected}} that the western cicada killer represents more than one species. It co-occurs with the eastern cicada killer (S.speciosus) and Pacific cicada killer (S.convallis) at Big Bend National Park in Texas. There the three wasps hunt and nest in the same locales, and the eastern and western cicada killers hunt the same cicada species. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA showed that the western cicada killer contains two <b>divergent</b> clades, which may represent distinct species. The two clades appeared to be split by the Rocky Mountains, with one occurring mainly {{to the south and}} east, the other to the west.|$|E
5|$|Ninox boobook fusca {{is found}} on Timor, Roma, Leti and Semau Islands {{in the eastern}} Lesser Sunda Islands. It was {{described}} by Veillot in 1817 as Strix fusca. It has a more grey-brown plumage with no red tinge, unlike other subspecies. it has grey streaks on its belly and white spots on its secondaries, inner wing-coverts and nape. Genetic and call analysis show it to be markedly <b>divergent</b> to the Australian populations of the southern boobook, leading Gwee and colleagues to suggest it be reclassified as a separate species. Its calls are shorter and more frequent than subspecies boobook.|$|E
5|$|Ninox boobook plesseni {{is known}} from Pantar and Alor Islands {{in the eastern}} Lesser Sunda Islands. It was {{described}} by Erwin Stresemann in 1929. The upperparts are grey-brown and heavily spotted and marked with white, giving rise to a cross-barred pattern on its back. Its underparts have longitudinal white streaks and its tail is prominently barred. It lives in Eucalyptus urophylla woodlands, and has an unusual low-pitched call different to subspecies boobook. Genetic and call analysis show it to be markedly <b>divergent</b> to the Australian populations of the southern boobook, leading Gwee and colleagues to suggest it be reclassified as a separate species.|$|E
5|$|Ninox boobook rotiensis {{is found}} on Rote Island in the Lesser Sunda Islands. It was first {{described}} in 1997 by Australian biologists Ronald Johnstone and J.C. Darnell from a female {{collected in a}} mist net in 1990. It is smaller than subspecies boobook, with heavily barred primaries, rump and tail. Locally common, it is known to the local people as Tuterui and Kokorok. Genetic and call analysis show it to be markedly <b>divergent</b> from the Australian populations of the southern boobook, leading Gwee and colleagues to suggest it be reclassified as a separate species.|$|E
5|$|Over the years, the {{investigations}} into the disappearance of De Mauro by the Carabinieri and the police followed widely <b>divergent</b> leads. Colonel Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa and Captain Giuseppe Russo of the Carabinieri {{were among the first}} to work on his case. Years later, and in different circumstances, both were murdered by the Mafia. They focused on the lead of drug trafficking. According to them, the journalist would have been a victim of lupara bianca after discovering leads on drug trafficking by the Mafia between Sicily and the United States.|$|E
5|$|Pairs did not {{cooperate}} in feeding, {{at least not}} in a strict sense. All such reports are based on misunderstanding of an account by ornithologist Walter Buller of a pair kept in captivity obtaining wood-boring beetle larvae. According to this misunderstanding, which has become part of ecological folklore, the male would tear at the wood and open larval tunnels, thus allowing the female to probe deeply into the tunnels with her long, pliant bill. Rather, the <b>divergent</b> bills represent an extreme example of niche differentiation, reducing intraspecific competition between the sexes. This allowed the species to exploit a wide range of food sources in different microhabitats.|$|E
5|$|Partly {{as a way}} {{to bring}} {{publicity}} to progress in physics, Feynman offered $1,000 prizes for two of his challenges in nanotechnology; one was claimed by William McLellan and the other by Tom Newman. He {{was also one of the}} first scientists to conceive the possibility of quantum computers. In 1984–86, he developed a variational method for the approximate calculation of path integrals, which has led to a powerful method of converting <b>divergent</b> perturbation expansions into convergent strong-coupling expansions (variational perturbation theory) and, as a consequence, to the most accurate determination of critical exponents measured in satellite experiments.|$|E
5|$|The Chytridiomycota are {{commonly}} known as chytrids. These fungi are distributed worldwide. Chytrids and their close relatives Neocallimastigomycota and Blastocladiomycota (below) are the only fungi with active motility, producing zoospores that are capable of active movement through aqueous phases with a single flagellum, leading early taxonomists to classify them as protists. Molecular phylogenies, inferred from rRNA sequences in ribosomes, suggest that the Chytrids are a basal group <b>divergent</b> from the other fungal phyla, consisting of four major clades with suggestive evidence for paraphyly or possibly polyphyly.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanically}} rigid {{outer layer}} of Earth, the lithosphere, {{is divided into}} pieces called tectonic plates. These plates are rigid segments that move in relation to one another at one of three types of plate boundaries: convergent boundaries, at which two plates come together, <b>divergent</b> boundaries, at which two plates are pulled apart, and transform boundaries, in which two plates slide past one another laterally. Earthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain-building, and oceanic trench formation can occur along these plate boundaries. The tectonic plates ride {{on top of the}} asthenosphere, the solid but less-viscous part of the upper mantle that can flow and move along with the plates.|$|E
5|$|The {{purpose of}} the mandate was to prevent the {{healthcare}} system from succumbing to adverse selection, which would result in high premiums for the insured and little coverage (and thus more illness and medical bankruptcy) for the uninsured. Studies by the CBO, Gruber and Rand Health concluded that a mandate was required. The mandate increased the size and diversity of the insured population, including more young and healthy participants to broaden the risk pool, spreading costs. Experience in New Jersey and Massachusetts offered <b>divergent</b> outcomes.|$|E
5|$|The state {{government}} {{made the decision}} to decommission Fremantle Prison in 1983, but it remained in operation until 30 November 1991. Prisoners were moved to a new metropolitan maximum security prison at Casuarina and the prison was transferred to the Building Management Authority. There were <b>divergent</b> views in the community over the site's future: some wanted it demolished and redeveloped, or turned into gardens with a small monument; others wanted the historic site to be preserved, but were opposed to turning the misery of prisoners into entertainment for tourists. The ultimate decision was for conservation of the prison, but allowing for the buildings to be adapted for reuse by the community.|$|E
