5000|$|The Panasonic Lumix DMC-GM1 was {{announced}} October 2013, as Panasonic's [...] "pocketable", Micro Four Thirds compact mirrorless interchangeable lens camera. It features the same sensor as the GX7, AF detection range of -4 - 18 EV, focus peaking mode, an <b>electronic</b> <b>shutter</b> with <b>speeds</b> ranging from 60 - 1/16,000 sec, and Wi-Fi connectivity.|$|R
50|$|The Konica Hexar RF has a metal, {{vertical}} travel, {{focal plane}} <b>shutter</b> with digital <b>electronic</b> control of <b>shutter</b> <b>speed.</b> There is {{no provision for}} non-electronic shutter release: charged batteries are always required for shutter operation.|$|R
5000|$|... {{optional}} <b>electronic</b> <b>shutter</b> (allowing {{silent operation}} and a <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> of 1/32000 of a second) ...|$|R
50|$|Canon, which {{produced}} the FD lens mount (known as the breech-mount; a unique lens mounting system that combines {{the advantages of}} screw-mount and bayonet-mount) introduced their shutter priority 35 mm SLR, the Canon EF in 1976 or so. This camera's build quality was almost the equal of their flagship camera, the Canon F1, and featured a copal-square vertically travelling focal plane shutter that could synchronize <b>electronic</b> flash at <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> {{up to and including}} 1/125 of a second, thus making this a good second-body camera for the professional photographer.|$|R
50|$|At {{the same}} time, {{a variant of}} the SL35M, the SL35ME was also released. Built on the same body, the SL35ME had <b>electronic</b> <b>shutter</b> control inside, and could set <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> automatically. The {{viewfinder}} also came with a whole range of indicators, including aperture, <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> amongst others.|$|R
50|$|The Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ1000 is {{a digital}} superzoom bridge camera by Panasonic. It has a 20 {{megapixel}} 3:2 BSI-CMOS sensor and Leica-branded 25-400mm {{equivalent focal length}} lens with a maximum aperture of f/2.8 to f/4 (f/4 at about 170mm and higher). It has a 1-inch CMOS sensor and supports ISO film speeds from 80 to 25600, <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> from 1/16000s (<b>electronic</b> <b>shutter)</b> to 60s and RAW capture, while the lowest physical <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> is 1/4000s.|$|R
50|$|Flashbulbs {{took longer}} to reach full {{brightness}} and burned {{for longer than}} <b>electronic</b> flashes. Slower <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> (typically from 1/10 to 1/50 of a second) were used on cameras to ensure proper synchronization. Cameras with flash sync triggered the flashbulb {{a fraction of a}} second before opening the shutter, allowing faster <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds.</b> A flashbulb widely used during the 1960s was the Press 25, the (about 1 inch (25 mm) in diameter) flashbulb often used by newspapermen in period movies, usually attached to a press camera or a twin-lens reflex camera. Its peak light output was around a million lumens. Other flashbulbs in common use were the M-series, M-2, M-3 etc., which had a small ("miniature") metal bayonet base fused to the glass bulb. The largest flashbulb ever produced was the GE Mazda No. 75, initially developed for nighttime aerial photography during World War II.|$|R
50|$|Due {{to their}} construction, focal plane shutters, as used on most SLRs, only allow normal xenon flash units {{to be used}} at <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> slow enough that the entire shutter is open at once, {{typically}} at <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> of 1/60 or slower, although some modern cameras may have an X-sync speed as high as 1/500 (e.g. Nikon's D40 DSLRs). Special electronic flash units for focal-plane shutters fire several times as the slit moves across the film. <b>Electronic</b> <b>shutters</b> used in some digital cameras do not have this limitation and may allow a very high X-sync speed.|$|R
5000|$|The Olympus PEN-F is a micro four thirds {{camera and}} the most {{advanced}} model in the digital PEN range. It boasts a new 20 MP sensor, an improved 5-axis in-body image stabilisation, 10 frames per second continuous shooting, and a fully articulated [...] "swivel" [...] rear touch screen. The camera features a higher resolution sensor then previous models, an articulating rear screen, and a built in <b>electronic</b> viewfinder. Fastest <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> is 1/8000 sec, it has focus peaking to assist manual focus, and built in Wi-Fi for connection to smartphone or tablet. The camera has a unique dials layout: in addition to two horizontal top-plate dials for exposure adjustments, it has an exposure compensation dial, and a front-mounted [...] "Creative Mode" [...] dial. The PEN-F comes in two colour schemes: black, or silver.|$|R
5000|$|The Pentax KP is a 24 {{megapixel}} compact APS-C digital SLR camera {{announced by}} Ricoh on January 25, 2017. It features a PRIME IV image processor with an [...] "image accelerator unit" [...] that supports its operation up to ISO 819,200. It has a 1/6000s conventional and 1/24,000s <b>electronic</b> <b>shutter</b> (available in Live View). In terms of bracketing modes, it adds {{depth of field}} and <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> bracketing.|$|R
40|$|An {{apparatus}} for and {{a method}} of triggering a pulsed light source, in particular a laser light source, for predictable capture of the source by video equipment. A frame synchronization signal {{is derived from the}} video signal of a camera to trigger the laser and position the resulting laser light pulse in the appropriate field of the video frame and during the opening of the <b>electronic</b> <b>shutter,</b> if such shutter is included in the camera. Positioning of the laser pulse in the proper video field allows, after recording, for the viewing of the laser light image with a video monitor using the pause mode on a standard cassette-type VCR. This invention also allows for fine positioning of the laser pulse to fall within the <b>electronic</b> <b>shutter</b> opening. For cameras with externally controllable <b>electronic</b> <b>shutters,</b> the invention provides for background light suppression by increasing <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> during the frame in which the laser light image is captured. This results in the laser light appearing in one frame in which the background scene is suppressed with the laser light being uneffected, while in all other frames, the <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> is slower, allowing for the normal recording of the background scene. This invention also allows for arbitrary (manual or external) triggering of the laser with full video synchronization and background light suppression...|$|R
5000|$|In photography, the shutter-release button (sometimes just {{shutter release}} or shutter button) is a {{push-button}} found on many cameras, {{used to take}} a picture. When pressed, the shutter of the camera is [...] "released", so that it opens to capture a picture, and then closes, allowing an exposure time {{as determined by the}} <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> setting (which may be automatic). Some cameras also utilize an <b>electronic</b> <b>shutter,</b> as opposed to a mechanical shutter.|$|R
50|$|The OM-10 hit {{the markets}} in June 1979 {{at the same}} time as the OM-2N. The camera was a 35mm focal-plane shutter {{aperture}} priority AE SLR camera with an <b>electronic</b> <b>shutter.</b> Only aperture-priority AE was available with the camera unless the optional manual exposure adapter was installed. This allowed the setting of <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> between 1s and 1/1000s, (bulb mode was also available). The camera was equipped with a fixed pentaprism viewfinder which contained an LED exposure indicator. The finder coverage was measured to be 93%.|$|R
50|$|Simple leaf {{shutters}} have {{a single}} leaf, or two leaves, which pivot so as to allow light through to the lens when triggered. If two leaves are used they have curved edges to create a roughly circular aperture. They typically have only one <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> and are commonly found in basic cameras, including disposable cameras. Some {{have more than one}} <b>speed.</b> <b>Shutters</b> for newer digital cameras are a combination of electronic and mechanical timings. Some cameras employ a 100% <b>electronic</b> <b>shutter,</b> created by turning on and off the imaging sensor's signals. Digital cameras that can also take video implement this method for their video modes. For single-frame photography then either mechanical or mechanical and electronic methods are used.|$|R
5000|$|The last {{development}} of M42 lenses was {{the introduction of}} a link between camera and lens to transmit the lens aperture setting, which allowed light metering with the aperture remaining wide open. The means of doing this was not standardised, Praktica's method was to use an electrical connection which transmitted a variable resistance value to the camera's metering circuit. Asahi Pentax developed an additional lever on the lens which operated a variable resistor in the camera mount. These mechanisms spurred the use of <b>electronic</b> <b>shutters</b> linked to the metering circuit, allowing for automated <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> selection by the camera (aperture priority). M42 cameras with wide open metering facility include: ...|$|R
50|$|These two {{photographs}} are taken under same situation except for camera <b>shutter</b> <b>speed.</b> In above situation, slow <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> makes image more clear and bright because the low <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> takes more light than high <b>shutter</b> <b>speed.</b> However, the high <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> often {{is necessary for}} moving object.|$|R
5000|$|P Program AE (auto-exposure) mode. Exposure is set by {{calculating the}} correct <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> for the given lighting, film {{sensitivity}} and currently-selected aperture. If the calculated <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> {{is higher than}} the maximum available (1/250th of a second) the aperture is closed to expose with an achievable <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> value. If the calculated <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> is lower than the [...] "camera shake" [...] <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> (default 1/30 of a second, but variable from 1/4 to 1/60) the aperture is opened to expose with that <b>shutter</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Motion blur due {{to subject}} {{movement}} {{can usually be}} prevented by using a faster <b>shutter</b> <b>speed.</b> The exact <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> {{will depend on the}} speed at which the subject is moving. For example, a very fast <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> will be needed to [...] "freeze" [...] the rotors of a helicopter, whereas a slower <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> will be sufficient to freeze a runner.|$|R
50|$|Above two {{photographs}} are taken under same situation except for camera shutter speed.In case of moving object, the low <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> is not proper {{to capture the}} object. It needs faster <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> to capture it. <b>Shutter</b> <b>speed</b> has pros and cons.For capturing a moving object, photographers must use a high <b>shutter</b> <b>speed.</b> However, the image can be very dark. Low <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> must be used when capturing a clear image or object under the harsh condition, {{but it is hard}} to capture the moving objects.|$|R
5000|$|In manual mode, {{recommended}} <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> {{is indicated}} by LEDs. The chosen <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> is shown in a separate window.|$|R
5000|$|A Aperture {{priority}} AE mode. Exposure is set by {{calculating the}} correct <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> or the given lighting, film sensitivity and currently-selected aperture. If that <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> {{is not available}} the photo is taken with the closest available <b>shutter</b> <b>speed,</b> but the aperture value is not varied.|$|R
5000|$|Tv (<b>Shutter</b> <b>speed</b> priority): The camera {{lets the}} user set the <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> and {{automatically}} sets the aperture for correct exposure.|$|R
50|$|The ME Super has an <b>electronic</b> {{focal plane}} <b>shutter</b> with metal {{curtains}} and a vertical movement. <b>Shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> are selected with {{up and down}} buttons rather than the conventional wheel. They run from 4 seconds to 1/2000 of a second, with flash synchronisation at 1/125 of a second. The hotshoe features an additional shoe contact for dedicated Pentax flash units, not seen on the preceding ME.|$|R
50|$|The Konica Hexar RF meters for {{exposure}} either by aperture priority auto-exposure (with AE lock and +/-2EV exposure compensation) or in metered-manual mode. Aperture priority is selected by setting the <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> dial {{to either the}} AE or AE lock position. Manual exposure is set by selecting a specific <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> on the <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> dial (there is a central interlock button to prevent accidentally moving the dial from the AE modes to a manually selected <b>shutter</b> <b>speed).</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{duration}} of an exposure {{is referred to}} as <b>shutter</b> <b>speed,</b> often even in cameras that do not have a physical shutter, and is typically measured in fractions of a second. It is quite possible to have exposures from one up to several seconds, usually for still-life subjects, and for night scenes exposure times can be several hours. However, longer <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> blur motion, and shorter <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> freeze motion. Therefore, moving subjects require fast <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{ability of}} the {{photographer}} to take images without noticeable blurring by camera movement is an important parameter {{in the choice of}} the slowest possible <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> for a handheld camera. The rough guide used by most 35 mm photographers is that the slowest <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> that can be used easily without much blur due to camera shake is the <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> numerically closest to the lens focal length. For example, for handheld use of a 35 mm camera with a 50 mm normal lens, the closest <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> is 1/60 s (closest to [...] "50"), while for a 200 mm lens it is recommended not to choose <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> below 1/200th of a second. This rule can be augmented with knowledge of the intended application for the photograph, an image intended for significant enlargement and closeup viewing would require faster <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> to avoid obvious blur. Through practice and special techniques such as bracing the camera, arms, or body to minimize camera movement, using a monopod or a tripod, slower <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> can be used without blur. If a <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> is too slow for hand holding, a camera support, usually a tripod, must be used. Image stabilization on digital cameras or lenses can often permit the use of <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> 3-4 stops slower (exposures 8-16 times longer).|$|R
50|$|When using most Zorki cameras, the <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> {{should only}} be set after the shutter has been cocked. Setting the <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> before the <b>shutter</b> is cocked can {{permanently}} damage the camera. This especially affects all Zorki cameras with slow <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> under 1/30 of a second, in particular the Zorki-3 and Zorki-4.|$|R
50|$|<b>Shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> do not factor into {{guide number}} {{calculations}} and, {{for the most}} part, {{have no effect on}} electronic flash exposures. See Effect of <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds,</b> below.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A 64264 element CMOS {{active pixel}} sensor (APS) for star tracker {{applications}} is reported. The chip features an innovative regional <b>electronic</b> <b>shutter</b> {{through the use}} of an individual pixel reset architecture.

50|$|In manual mode, a green M LED came on. The OVER or UNDER LED would blink to {{indicate}} the exposure adjustment recommended by the meter, while a steadily lit LED showed the actual camera set <b>shutter</b> <b>speed.</b> The photographer would adjust the <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> and/or the lens aperture f-stop until the OVER or UNDER LED went out. Unlike most other SLRs of the era, the ME F used two push buttons to increase or decrease <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> instead of the traditional dial and this LED scale is the only display of the set <b>shutter</b> <b>speed.</b> What {{appeared to be a}} <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> dial on autoexposure M-series SLRs was actually the exposure mode dial: AUTO meant aperture priority and M was for manual.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to its effect on exposure, the <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> changes the way movement appears in photographs. Very short <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> {{can be used to}} freeze fast-moving subjects, for example at sporting events. Very long <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> are used to intentionally blur a moving subject for effect. Short exposure times are sometimes called [...] "fast", and long exposure times [...] "slow".|$|R

50|$|In 'M' (Manual Exposure Control) mode, {{the user}} selects both {{aperture}} and <b>shutter</b> <b>speed,</b> and the metering system provides a suggested <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> (indicated in the viewfinder) for the selected aperture.|$|R
50|$|<b>Shutter</b> <b>speed</b> is {{critical}} to catching motion, thus sports photography is often done in shutter priority mode or manual. A frequent goal is to capture an instant with minimal blur, in which case a minimal <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> is desired, but in other cases a slower <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> is used so that blur shows to capture the motion, not simply the instant. A particular technique is panning, where the camera uses an intermediate <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> and pans with the subject, yielding a relatively sharp subject and a background blurred {{in the direction of}} motion, yielding a sense of speed - compare speed lines.|$|R
