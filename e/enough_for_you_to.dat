25|$|Aguirre {{is helping}} Senator Grassley's staff examine 21,000 Federal Reserve (the Fed) {{transactions}} involving taxpayer funds distributed to {{banks and other}} financial institutions. The Fed was forced to reveal the information by Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests by Bloomberg News and Fox News, as well as provisions contained in Wall Street reform legislation. Despite pronouncements by the Fed about its transparency, the information released has been incomplete. The lack of details {{make it impossible to}} tell just how much profit the recipients of the funds are making and only the recipients' names and amount of funds are known. Aguirre says that between $3 and $4 trillion in cash transfers were made and another $9 to $11 trillion in commitments that taxpayer funds would cover the cost of failed investments. “It looks like they are borrowing the money from the Fed, say, at 70 cents on the dollar and selling it back to the Fed for 90 cents. We can’t tell for certain because the Fed won’t tell us. The Fed publishes information but not <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> figure out what the hell happened,” Aguirre said.|$|E
2500|$|Time {{reviewer}} Josh Tyrangiel praised guitarist Buck's [...] "resurgence" [...] and [...] "propulsive riffs," [...] {{but also}} wrote, [...] "R.E.M.'s 14th album never quite generates the moody atmospherics {{of their first}} 10; it's {{a little hard to}} lose yourself in something that doesn't pause long <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> get lost." [...] Uncut gave the album three out of five stars. Reviewer John Mulvey stated, [...] "Accelerate is a simple, pragmatic record built on an uncomfortable truth: sometimes, even the best bands have to retrace their steps, if only to remind themselves what they're really good at." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{division}} {{survived the}} hazards of the Soviet winter offensive, being moved around the 6th Army in January as the Wehrmacht prepared to continue their assault on the Soviet Union, helping to re-take Kharkov in May. The division's commander, Lieutenant General Max Pfeffer, anticipating a long upcoming struggle, joked to a Captain under his command over the latter's reluctance to accept a transfer offer to France, saying [...] "just be happy that you're getting a break. The war will last long enough and be terrible <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> get a good taste of it." [...] On June 10, the division began crossing the Seversky Donets River by assault boat, constructing a bridge for other units, including the 14th Panzer Division. The division continued to make inroads around the black sea to take down the industrial city of Stalingrad, serving in IV corps under General of the Engineers Erwin Jaenecke.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Wix at {{the same}} instant found another apostrophe. [...] "Isn't it <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> madam, <b>to</b> have brought her to {{discussing}} your relations?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wal, Nagger ain't so durned slow, come {{to think}} of thet," [...] replied Bill, with a grunt. [...] "He's good <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> not <b>to</b> want another hoss." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Stranger," [...] {{answered}} the Christian, blushing deeply as he spoke, [...] "we tell not rashly {{where it is}} we have bestowed our choicest treasures. It is <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>thee</b> <b>to</b> know that, as thou sayest, my love is highly and nobly bestowed--most highly--most nobly; but if thou wouldst hear of love and broken lances, venture thyself, as thou sayest, to the camp of the Crusaders, and thou wilt find exercise for thine ears, and, if thou wilt, for thy hands too." ...|$|R
2500|$|On {{two other}} {{occasions}} around this time, Van Gogh {{used the word}} [...] "arrangement" [...] to refer to color, {{similar to the way}} James Abbott McNeill Whistler used the term. In a letter to Gauguin in January 1889, he wrote, [...] "As an arrangement of colours: the reds moving through to pure oranges, intensifying even more in the flesh tones up to the chromes, passing into the pinks and marrying with the olive and Veronese greens. As an impressionist arrangement of colours, I’ve never devised anything better." [...] (The painting he is referring to is La Berceuse, which is a realistic portrait of Augustine Roulin with an imaginative floral background.) And to Bernard in late November 1889: [...] "But this is <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> understand that I would long to see things of yours again, like the painting of yours that Gauguin has, those Breton women walking in a meadow, the arrangement of which is so beautiful, the colour so naively distinguished. Ah, you’re exchanging that for something — must one say the word — something artificial — something affected." ...|$|E
2500|$|During a February 28, 2008 {{speech in}} Beaumont, Texas, Obama said, [...] "It's not good <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> {{say to your}} child, 'Do good in school,' and then when that child comes home, you got the TV set on, you got the radio on, you don't check their homework, {{there is not a}} book in the house, you've got the video game playing... So turn off the TV set, put the video game away. Buy a little desk or put that child by the kitchen table. Watch them do their homework. If they don't know how to do it, give them help. If you don't know how to do it, call the teacher. Make them go to bed at a {{reasonable}} time. Keep them off the streets. Give 'em some breakfast... I also know that if folks letting our children drink eight sodas a day, which some parents do, or, you know, eat a bag of potato chips for lunch, or Popeyes for breakfast [...] You can't do that. Children have to have proper nutrition. That affects also how they study, how they learn in school." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I say he isn't {{going to}} pay you a cent, Mr. Blodgett. Is that plain <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> understand?" [...] {{answered}} Dave, sharply.|$|E
6000|$|But Mrs. Guppy {{positively}} {{refused to}} come out of the gangway. She wouldn't hear of it. [...] "Why, get along with you," [...] said she to my guardian, [...] "what do you mean? Ain't my son good <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>you?</b> <b>You</b> ought <b>to</b> be ashamed of yourself. Get out with you!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No;--we {{need not}} quarrel. But I am afraid of him. He {{is not good}} <b>enough,</b> Clary, <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> be unhappy about him. And I fear,--I fear, he is--" ...|$|R
6000|$|Presently Eric saw where Little John stood {{among the}} others, a head and {{shoulders}} above them all, and he called to him loudly, [...] "Halloa, thou long-legged fellow in scarlet! Broad are thy shoulders and thick thy head; is not thy lass fair <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>thee</b> <b>to</b> take cudgel in hand for her sake? In truth, I believe that Nottingham men do turn to bone and sinew, for neither heart nor courage have they! Now, thou great lout, wilt thou not twirl staff for Nottingham?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you very, very much, dear Will. I {{only wish}} my little amb'lance was big <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> go in,--I'd so {{like to give}} you the first ride." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stoop {{down behind}} the breastwork," [...] Jethro shouted, [...] "until they are near <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> take aim. Have your spears ready to check their onslaught when they charge." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Gor on," [...] the {{corncrake}} {{would answer}} surlily. [...] "You keep your wife herself quiet; that's <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do." [...] And on {{he would go}} again worse than before.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Alas! {{the fruit}} is not ripe <b>enough</b> yet <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> eat,' {{answered}} the fox, who {{hoped that the}} tortoise would die of hunger long before the seven years were over.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wouldst {{fashion for}} thyself a seemly life?-- [...] Then fret not {{over what is}} past and gone; [...] And spite of all thou mayst have lost behind, [...] Yet act as if thy life were just begun. [...] What each day wills, <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>thee</b> <b>to</b> know; [...] What each day wills, the day itself will tell. [...] Do thine own task, and be therewith content; [...] What others do, that shalt thou fairly judge; [...] Be sure that thou no brother-mortal hate, [...] Then all besides leave to the Master Power." ...|$|R
6000|$|BILL [sneering after her] Naow, it warn't <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>you.</b> [Turning <b>to</b> the drum, {{he misses}} the money]. Ellow! If you ain't took it summun else az. Were's it gorn? Blame me if Jenny Ill didn't take it arter all! ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{think you}} should be thankful there is one human being--however wretched--who cares <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> care about the truth in what {{concerns}} you,' Laura said. 'Selina, Selina--are you hideously deceiving us?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There is one chance--one {{chance for}} him! Lift over the bank, sir! Lift over, while I run forward and meet them. My death will delay them long <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> save him!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't hurry {{about getting}} employment," [...] he said regretfully. [...] "I don't {{want you to}} do that. I wish you wouldn't, Sue. The boy and {{yourself}} are <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> attend to." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Could you {{not just}} let them have a few drawings, or {{a little bit of}} your company work--just <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> not <b>to</b> annoy every one, and seem to be testifying against them? You would not like to vex Meta." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{was then}} ushered into the drawing-room, and {{introduced}} in form to his grand-nieces. 'This is Gertrude, uncle, and this Linda; {{there is just}} <b>enough</b> difference <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> know them apart. And this Katie. Come here, Katie, and kiss your uncle.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Abe sure has {{got it in}} <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> Hans. Your {{standing}} up for the Dutchman and his woman was bad <b>enough,</b> but <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> arrest Hank without a warrant has set the old man a-poppin'." [...] He glanced at the ranger's empty belt. [...] "Better take your gun along." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{could not}} think of that, sir. It would be {{difficult}} <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> get through the enemy by yourselves. It would add terribly to your danger to have us with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, this is well <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> say, as a seaman yourself; {{though you}} will {{find it hard to}} persuade most of those who live on shore into your own ways of thinking." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Better {{keep your}} tongue between your teeth, young Beman," [...] {{one of the}} men said in a surly tone. [...] "When we ask for {{information}} there'll be time <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> wag it so freely." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{she chooses}} to stay with Mrs. Bromley! I'm sure it's quite <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> and mamma <b>to</b> do duty--and Emily, {{who wants to know}} why Mr. Calvert raves so about her--without MY going over there to stare." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Those {{who are now}} standing," [...] {{pursued the}} teacher, [...] "admit that they do, {{sometimes}} at least, commit this sin. I suppose all, however, are determined to reform; for I {{do not know what}} else should induce <b>you</b> <b>to</b> rise and acknowledge it here, unless it is a desire, hereafter to break yourselves of the habit. But do you suppose that it will be <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> merely <b>to</b> resolve here, that you will reform?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Little girl," [...] he said, [...] "I {{knew that}} there was some trouble. It is there in your dear, {{innocent}} little face for anyone to see who cares enough about <b>you</b> <b>to</b> look. When <b>you</b> have dried those eyes, you must tell me all about it. Remember that even if you won't have me for a husband, we are old <b>enough</b> friends <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> look upon me as an elder brother." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear, {{maybe that}} was just it. I suspect General Lodge cared <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> {{want you to come}} back to your job for your sake--for his sake--for sake of the railroad. And not for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] said Forester, [...] "you can not {{possibly}} have occasion {{to come to me}} about your writing; for here are pages <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> write upon for several days, and you have plenty of pens." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{exaggerate the}} effect of what has happened," [...] said the young man. [...] "It's enough, more than <b>enough,</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> have {{mentioned}} the matter to me, and I think it's unbecoming in me to hear you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "With {{such good}} fortune {{as we have}} had this day," [...] said her mother, [...] "we shall soon gather <b>enough</b> honey <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> carry to Queen Cor." [...] For it seems the wicked Queen was very fond of honey {{and it had been}} Zella's custom to go, once every year, to the City of Coregos, to carry the Queen a supply of sweet honey for her table. Usually she had but one pail.|$|R
6000|$|... 2. Witness {{also that}} strange kind of sweat that trickled down his most blessed face, {{where it is}} said: 'And he sweat, as it were, great drops' or clodders 'of blood,' {{trickling}} 'down to the ground.' O Lord Jesus! what a load didst thou carry! What a burden didst thou bear of {{the sins of the}} world, and the wrath of God! O thou didst not only bleed at nose and mouth with the pressure that lay upon thee, but thou wast so pressed, so loaden, that the pure blood gushed through the flesh and skin, and so ran trickling down to the ground. 'And his sweat was as it were great drops of blood,' trickling or 'falling down to the ground' (Luke 22:44). Canst thou read this, O thou wicked sinner, and yet go on in sin? Canst thou think of this, and defer repentance one hour longer? O heart of flint! yea, harder. O miserable wretch! What place in hell will be hot <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>thee</b> <b>to</b> have thy soul put into, if thou shalt persist or go on still to add iniquity to iniquity.|$|R
6000|$|... "Euphemia," [...] I said, presently, [...] "the ground seems hard {{a little}} way in front of you. If you step over there, I will go out on this strip, which seems pretty solid. Then I'll be near <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> swing the bird to me, and I'll catch hold of him." ...|$|R
