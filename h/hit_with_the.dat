The Daily Advertiser featured a weekly column on the gallery from May through August (exhibition season). Artists who had influence with the press, and Boydell himself, published anonymous articles to heighten interest in the gallery, which they hoped would increase sales of the edition.|$|E

5|$|When {{it opened}} on 4 May 1789 at 52 Pall Mall, the Shakespeare Gallery {{contained}} 34 paintings {{and by the}} end of its run it had between 167 and 170. The Gallery itself was a <b>hit</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> public and became a fashionable attraction. It took over the public's imagination and became an end in and of itself.|$|E
5|$|As {{the city}} prepares for the {{memorial}} service, Leslie and Ben are caught making {{out by a}} maintenance worker named George (Biff Yeager), so they send him home with a gift certificate {{in exchange for his}} silence. Unfortunately, George had the propane for Li'l Sebastian's eternal flame, which results in later confusion behind the scenes, that Leslie and Ben struggle to fix throughout the night. Jerry (Jim O'Heir) is sent to get propane for the flame but buys lighter fluid instead; this causes a huge fireball to shoot into the air when Ron lights it, which singes off his eyebrows, part of his mustache and hair. Leslie and Ben are relieved, however, when the crowd applauds in the belief the fireball was staged. Entertainment 720's show also proves to be a <b>hit</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> crowd, which makes Tom further contemplate quitting his job.|$|E

5|$|At home, Bart {{comes up}} with a {{character}} called Angry Dad, based on the frequent angry outbursts of his father, Homer. Bart rolls out the first issue of Angry Dad, which becomes a <b>hit</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> kids in school. During an autograph signing session in the schoolyard, Bart is approached by a spokesman for an Internet entertainment site. He wants to make Angry Dad into an online animated cartoon series, and Bart agrees in exchange for stock. The cartoon becomes an Internet hit, becoming the single most popular non-pornographic website of all time. The only one still unaware of Angry Dad is Homer, who finds out one day at work. Once the humiliated Homer gets home, he finds Bart and strangles him. Marge and Lisa stops him and calms him down, and Homer agrees to suppress his anger from that point on.|$|E
5|$|Cheetahs {{engage in}} several {{displays}} during fights, hunting, or self-defence. Prior to a sprint, the cheetah {{will hold its}} head down, with aggression on its face, and approach the target in a stiff gait. The aggressive expression is maintained during the run. To defend itself or its prey, a cheetah will hold its body low to the ground, and produce a snarl with its mouth wide open, the eyes staring threateningly ahead and the ears folded backward. This may be accompanied by moans, hisses, and growls. In more severe cases, the ground is <b>hit</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> paws. Fights are characterised by biting, tearing out the fur and attempts at strangling on both sides.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of the game, the player must acquire twelve Artifacts, which are prizes that are awarded after {{completing}} objectives such as winning minigames or beating bosses. Once having acquired twelve Artifacts, the player is granted access to a table called the Artifact Temple, which places six balls on the table at the same time. To complete the table, twelve different targets must be <b>hit</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> balls while they are bombarded by attacks from Meta Ridley, one of the antagonists of the Metroid Prime series. If all of the balls are lost, the table ends; the player does not lose any of the twelve Artifacts already collected but is forced to revisit another table and complete it before being allowed a second attempt at the Artifact Temple. Upon completing the Artifact Temple, access is granted to the final table, Impact Crater. After the player defeats the Metroid Prime creature on the Impact Crater table, the game unlocks a higher difficulty level, Expert mode.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, Cook was {{presented}} {{with the opportunity to}} become the CEO and controlling partner for the International Academy of Music Arts and Sciences (IAMAS Corporation). Years earlier, the company merged with its daughter company, The American Musical Academy of Arts Association, which proved profitable as there was an upswing in demand for Christian-based music and distribution opportunities. This was profitable as IAMAS was able to use its history in the entertainment industry as a door to help boost other smaller companies into existence. In 2004, the entertainment industry took a huge <b>hit</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> incoming markets of Napster, iTunes, and Amazon.com. IAMAS, no longer able to compete, decided to sell off only its American division and retain its overseas holdings. Since IAMAS Corporation had handled Cook's contracts since 1980, Cook offered to buy the company for an undisclosed amount. His offer was accepted and he officially filed for corporation status on November 24, 2004.|$|E
5|$|Rodgers {{had long}} {{wanted to write}} a musical comedy about the cast and crew {{backstage}} at a theatre. After Rodgers and Hammerstein had another <b>hit</b> <b>with</b> <b>The</b> King and I in 1951, Rodgers proposed the backstage project to his partner. Hammerstein was unenthusiastic, thinking the subject matter trivial, but agreed to do the project. The play required complex machinery, designed by Jo Mielziner, so that the audience could view action not only on the stage of the theatre where the show-within-the-show (also named Me and Juliet) takes place, but in the wings and on the light bridge (high above the stage, from which the lighting technicians train spotlights) as well.|$|E
5|$|The ad {{was also}} a <b>hit</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> public. It has been {{credited}} by Guinness as being responsible for the substantial boost in sales experienced by the brand during {{the period in which}} it was broadcast. While revenues within the UK beer market declined by an average of −0.4%(−£19M), the year-on-year figures for Guinness showed an increase of 3.6%(+£13.3M). Between October 2005 and October 2006, Guinness achieved its highest ever volume (6.8%) and value (7.4%) shares, taking the position of market leader from Stella Artois. Diageo attributed the growth in no small part to the positive reception garnered by noitulovE.|$|E

5|$|The {{scene in}} which Terrell kills Jedda, a Regula scientist, by {{vaporizing}} him with a phaser was filmed in two takes. Winfield and the related actors first played out the scene; this footage became the background plate. A blue screen was wheeled onto the set and actor John Vargas, {{the recipient of the}} phaser blast, acted out his response to being <b>hit</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> energy weapon. A phaser beam element was placed on top of the background plate, and Vargas' shots were optically dissolved into an airbrushed disintegration effect which matched Vargas' position in every frame.|$|E
5|$|They {{set out on}} {{the road}} with little money in a yellow 1973 Buick Skylark {{convertible}} with a guy named Ben (Anson Mount). Lucy, however, leaves without the permission of her overbearing father Pete (Dan Aykroyd), who wakes up the next day to find his daughter is gone. Shortly into their journey, the car breaks down. They realise that they don't have enough money between them for the travel or the repair costs. Mimi then suggests that she sing karaoke at a local bar, where good singers are tipped well by the customers. While at the bar, the girls dress up and go the stage to perform. However, when the song starts Mimi develops stage fright, being unable to sing. Seeing that they needed the money, Lucy takes her place, and quickly becomes a <b>hit</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> crowd. They make enough money to fix the car and continue on their way.|$|E
5|$|Wiggins {{was moved}} to second base in 1984. That move made room for rookie Carmelo Martínez in the outfield. Until that season, Martínez had been a first baseman, but the Padres already had a strong player there with Garvey, {{and they wanted to}} get Martínez's bat into the lineup to improve their outfield's home run production. Wiggins {{retained}} the leadoff spot in the lineup, hitting ahead of Tony Gwynn. During a May game, Wiggins became the fifth 20th-century MLB player to steal five bases in one game, tying an NL record. In an August game, Wiggins unwittingly became a party to a series of fights. Wiggins was <b>hit</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> first pitch of the game by Atlanta Braves pitcher Pascual Pérez. The teams retaliated against each other throughout the game with brushback pitches and beanballs. The tension resulted in three fights and several ejections.|$|E

5|$|Georgia Tech's mascot Buzz got {{his start}} in the 1970s. The {{original}} Georgia Tech Yellow Jacket mascot was Judi McNair who donned a homemade yellowjacket costume in 1972 and performed at home football games. She rode on the Ramblin' Wreck and appears in the 1972 Georgia Tech Blueprint yearbook. McNair's mascot was considered a great idea, {{as it was a}} big <b>hit</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> fans. In 1979, McNair's idea for a Yellow Jacket was reintroduced by another Georgia Tech student, Richie Bland. Bland, who was apparently unaware of McNair's prior initiative, paid $1,400 to have a local theme park costume designer make a yellowjacket costume that he first wore at a pep rally prior to the Tennessee football game. Rather than obtain permission from Georgia Tech as Judi had done in 1972, this student simply sneaked onto the field in costume during a football game and ran across the field. The fans believed that this costumed character was acting as an official member of the cheerleading squad and responded accordingly. By 1980, this new incarnation of the yellow jacket mascot was given the name Buzz Bee and was adopted as an official mascot by Georgia Tech. This new Buzz character would be the model for a new Georgia Tech emblem, designed in 1985 by Mike Lester.|$|E
