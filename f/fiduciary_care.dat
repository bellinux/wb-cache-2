40|$|Background. A written {{investment}} {{policy is the}} single most important element in a public funds investment program. An {{investment policy}} should describe the most prudent primary objectives for a sound policy: safety, liquidity, and yield. It should also indicate the type of instruments eligible for purchase by a government entity, the investment process, and the management of a portfolio. Such a policy improves the quality of decisions and demonstrates a commitment to the <b>fiduciary</b> <b>care</b> of public funds, with emphasis on balancing safety of principal and liquidity with yield. Adherence to an investment policy signals to rating agencies, the capital markets and the public that a government entity is well managed and is earning interest income suitable to its situation and economic environment. Recommendation. The Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA) recommends that all governing bodies adopt a comprehensive written investment policy and review and update its policies, if necessary on an annual basis. The process of creating an investment policy should include: 1. Examination of state public funds investment statutes. Most states have some form of public funds investment statutes. A state’s public funds statute defines the parameters of what a government entity may do and serves as a guideline to begin drafting an investment policy. A government entity’s policy may b...|$|E
40|$|This article {{explores the}} duty of “disclosure/complete candor” (among directors, from boards to {{shareholders}} and from controllers to minority shareholders) within state corporate fiduciary law (especially Delaware’s, the most developed). It observes the odd minimization of the candor/disclosure duty within the core doctrines of <b>fiduciary</b> <b>care,</b> loyalty and good faith. It analyzes {{the evolution of the}} fiduciary disclosure duty and its “moment of truth” in the watershed litigation in Malone v. Brincat. The belated appearance of the fiduciary disclosure duty is partly the result of historical, customary and political understandings which have dwarfed logic and conceptual coherence in this area of law. The customary dividing line between “corporate” law and governance and what’s deemed “federal securities law” and “market regulation,” has been grossly overstated and was untenable, as demonstrated by Congress’ subsequent enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and corporate law’s humbled stature in (minimally) responding to the massive financial frauds of ’ 01 -’ 02. A central claim is that the fiduciary disclosure/candor duty is the core principle within fiduciary law: it addresses the informational/power asymmetry that is the root of agency cost problems, inter alia. Too often technical problems relating to the quantification of remedies has derailed corporate law’s force in this area. But adjudicated fiduciary wrongs without remedies are far from trivial: they undermine the legitimacy and vitality of corporate law, even Delaware’s. Recent doctrinal expansion in {{the duty of}} disclosure supports this claim, as does the ongoing trend to a ‘knowledge’ based economy.

40|$|The term 2 ̆ 2 unsafe or unsound banking {{practices}} 2 ̆ 2 {{serves as}} a statutory trigger for virtually every key administrative sanction available against bank directors. Congress has not defined either the term 2 ̆ 2 unsafe or unsound banking practices 2 ̆ 2 or its counterpart 2 ̆ 2 safety and soundness, 2 ̆ 2 leaving the federal banking agencies considerable discretion in the interpretation and application of the term. Given the potential breadth of the term, the banking agencies {{have the ability to}} seek administrative remedies in cases covering a broad range of director conducL Thus, 2 ̆ 2 unsafe or unsound banking practices 2 ̆ 2 is a potent source of director liability. Professor Schooner argues that 2 ̆ 2 unsafe or unsound banking practices 2 ̆ 2 and the common law <b>fiduciary</b> duty of <b>care</b> appear to share the same theoretical basis. Although both concepts are derived from negligence theory, Professor Schooner shows that they retain certain vital differences in application. In cases brought by the FDIC or the RTC as receivers for failed banks against bank directors for breach of the <b>fiduciary</b> duty of <b>care,</b> the business judgment rule requires courts to defer to directors 2 ̆ 7 business decisions. In reviewing administrative actions against bank directors for unsafe or unsound banking practices, however, courts must defer to the banking agencies 2 ̆ 7 determinations. Professor Schooner argues that, {{as a result of this}} difference in application, the principles of safety and soundness create a higher standard of care for bank directors than that imposed by the common law <b>fiduciary</b> duty of <b>care.</b> She suggests that this inconsistency proves most troublesome in the context of the agencies 2 ̆ 7 cease and desist power.

40|$|For {{the average}} {{investor}} {{trying to save}} for retirement or a child’s college fund, the world of investing has become increasingly complex. These retail investors must turn more frequently to financial intermediaries, such as broker-dealers and investment advisers, to get sound investment advice. Such intermediaries perform different duties for their clients, however. The investment adviser owes his client a <b>fiduciary</b> duty of <b>care</b> and therefore must provide financial advice {{that is in the}} client’s best interests, while the broker-dealer must merely provide advice that is suitable to the client’s interests—a lower standard than the <b>fiduciary</b> duty of <b>care.</b> And yet these divergent standards are not necessarily evident to the average investor. As a result, investors run the risk of being placed into suboptimal investments by broker-dealers. Two competing solutions to this issue have been proposed: a higher fiduciary standard for both broker-dealers and investment advisers and a less burdensome disclosure standard in which broker-dealers would inform their clients that they are not fiduciaries. This Note analyzes these potential reforms using a traditional economics analysis as well as new behavioral-economics research. It concludes that a fiduciary standard more effectively protects investors and that a disclosure standard would actually have the perverse effect of making investors more susceptible to behavioral biases that can impair their ability to invest properly...|$|R

2500|$|A {{fiduciary}} is {{a person}} who holds a legal or ethical relationship of trust with one or more other parties (person or group of persons).

According to Professor Coffee, courts, using well-recognized techniques to interpret statutes and intrafirm contracts, often will reconcile whatever tension may exist between contractarians and anticontractarians. Anticontractarians, according to Coffee, generally misperceive the nature of corporate law because they fail to understand the extent to which courts adjust the mandatory statutory provisions imposed by legislatures.

40|$|Corporate law allocates to {{the board}} of {{directors}} the central role in the management of the American corporation. Three legal principles, taken together, coalesce to focus legal attention on corporate boards of directors. First, most states require board approval for important decisions. For example, organic changes to the corporate form such as mergers, sales of control, and sales of all or substantially all of a corporation 2 ̆ 7 s assets all require board approval. Second, by law, corporations are run by or under the direction of the board of directors. Courts have traditionally interpreted this requirement narrowly, and many board decisions are therefore considered nondelegable. Finally, at least in theory, boards of directors are ultimately responsible for corporate performance. Not only do directors owe shareholders a fiduciary duty of loyalty, they also owe shareholders a <b>fiduciary</b> duty of <b>care.</b> In essence, this means that directors must not only refrain from stealing from the corporation, but they must also attempt to maximize the economic value of the firm...|$|R

40|$|Most {{people would}} {{acknowledge}} {{the importance of}} the duty of loyalty, but the same is not true of the duty of care. Historically, the corporate law duty of care has been underenforced at best, and arguably unenforced entirely. Some scholars do not consider the duty of care to be a fiduciary duty at all, and there are those who would do away with it entirely. In this paper, I intend to provide a comprehensive defense of the corporate law <b>fiduciary</b> duty of <b>care.</b> I hope to show that the duty of care is not simply an ill-fitting appendage to the duty of loyalty, but rather an essential aspect of the singular fiduciary concept that also encompasses the duty of loyalty. Simply put, a fiduciary has the duty to act {{in the interests of the}} beneficiary in all relevant respects. Once the breadth of this singular fiduciary concept is properly understood, it is revealed to be much more than any of the individual duties that it comprises. Far from being streamlined or focused, fiduciary law would be impoverished if it were limited to the duty of loyalty. However, I do not intend to argue for a more robust duty of care. Rather, I will defend the duty of care as it currently exists in corporate law (more or less) — deliberately and advisedly underenforced, but not entirely unenforced. The duty of care works in the corporate context precisely because caution is built into the enforcement equation...|$|R

However, the remedies for those who breach their duty by mishandling funds or arbitrarily dispensing and denying benefits are quite limited.

Thus, disappointed policyholders and beneficiaries are limited only to the remedy of ERISA Section 502. ERISA Section 502 establishes an exclusive civil cause of action, but the federal court’s remedy is also quite narrow. Congress’s inclusion of Section 510 ’s whistleblowing, anti-retaliation provision acts as an additional safeguard to counter employers’ significant lack of transparency and accountability by encouraging employees and pension beneficiaries to bring to light any allegations of fiduciary breach. Given the limited public oversight of ERISA plans, a more expansive interpretation of ERISA Section 510 ’s whistleblowing provision is particularly important in order to allow it to be an effective, safeguarding mechanism.
