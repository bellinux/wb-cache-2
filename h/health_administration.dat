40|$|Being {{a healthy}} {{traveller}} involves communication {{in more than}} one sense of the word. <b>Health</b> <b>administrations</b> have a responsibility to prevent illness associated with international travel and trade without undue interference to these inevitable activities. Past experience of travel-associated disease transmission should determine epidemiologically justified and cost-effective preventive measures. The aeroplane transmits disease faster but should not become the scapegoat for travel-associated ill health. Viral influenza can spread rapidly because of air travel but the latter's role in transmission of diseases such as cholera and smallpox in the past or viral haemorrhagic fevers in the future may not be clear cut. Surveillance activities are essential to enable the earliest possible detection of disease because measures taken with the intention of keeping a disease out of a country cannot be foolproof. Frank and rapid exchange of information between national epidemiological services is essential for effective control of international spread of diseases. National <b>health</b> <b>administrations</b> have an obligation to provide travellers with reliable information. A specific programme co-opting the medical profession, travel agencies of every form and the media is necessary. The World Health Organisation should collaborate with national <b>health</b> <b>administrations</b> in the prevention of disease associated with trave...|$|R

40|$|The {{analysis}} of efficiency {{in health care}} has largely focused either on individual health care providers, or on sub-national health systems conceived as a unique decision-making unit. However, in hierarchically organized national health services, two separate entities are responsible for turning financial resources into services at the local level: <b>health</b> <b>administrations</b> and <b>health</b> care providers. Their separate roles and the one of <b>health</b> <b>administrations</b> in particular have not been explicitly considered in efficiency analysis. We applied stochastic frontier analysis to district-level panel data from Mozambique (2008 - 2011) to assess district efficiency in delivering outpatient care. We first assessed {{the efficiency of the}} whole district considered as an individual decision-making unit, and then we assessed separately the efficiency of <b>health</b> <b>administrations</b> and <b>health</b> care providers within the same district. We found that on average only 73 % of the outpatient consultations deliverable using available inputs were realized, with large differences in performance across districts. Individual districts performed differently in administrative or health care delivery functions. On average, a reduction of administrative inefficiency by 10 percentage points, for a given expenditure would increase by 0. 2 % the volume of services delivered per thousand population per year. Identifying and targeting the specific drivers of administrative inefficiencies can contribute to increase service...|$|R
