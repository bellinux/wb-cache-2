2500|$|NOAA {{describes}} {{the goal of}} Mussel Watch as “to support <b>ecosystem-based</b> <b>management</b> through an integrated nationwide program of environmental monitoring, assessment and research to describe the status and trends of our nation’s estuaries and coasts." [...] Mussel Watch is a program that monitors the health of bivalves, mussels and clams for contaminants along the coasts of the United States. This program was launched in 1986 and since then is the longest government-run monitoring program that has national influence. It was made {{in response to a}} legislative mandate to preserve the marine environment. In 2008 they released an assessment of their data from 1986 through 2005. In this report, concentrations of many different metals and organic pollutants are shown over the two decades of data collection. Using this set of data, trends can be identified for different coastal areas. Starting in 2000, the scientists that NOAA sent out to collect the mussels changed companies and the Mussel Watch program began employing citizen scientists to collect the mussels; this approach saved a good deal of money for the program. This can be seen on the local level in Washington State where The Snohomish County’s Natural Marine Resources Committee coordinated with the Mussel Watch program in 2007 to employ citizens to collect samples from the nearshore water Snohomish County. In 2010 and 2012 Western Washington University students assisted Whatcom County Public Works. [...] Mussel Watch originally monitored areas known for contamination where data would be easily found and monitored for trends in the toxicity data. Now the focus is to shift to areas of concern directed by organizations like the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Instead of focusing just on trends in the data Mussel Watch is looking to see if a given policy has actually made a positive impact on a specific environment.|$|E

40|$|The {{science and}} {{management}} of marine resources is increasingly grappling {{with the use of}} <b>ecosystem-based</b> fisheries <b>management.</b> Though <b>ecosystem-based</b> fisheries <b>management</b> seeks to unite biological and sociocultural concerns into a holistic framework, people are often seen simply as external drivers of change. The technical questions that are often posed, such as the delineation of boundaries or the strategies of governance, are however more broadly questions concerning the social production of nature. This paper explores these issues by analyzing both the spatial fishing practices of different fishermen and the results of a series of workshops held in New England to solicit opinions about <b>ecosystem-based</b> fisheries <b>management.</b> The paper emphasizes teasing apart the human dimensions of fishing embedded in predominant notions such as fishing effort through more explicit consideration of spatially based resource dependencies and mutual constitution of society-nature. <b>Ecosystem-based</b> fisheries <b>management</b> Social mapping Social production of nature Stakeholder involvement Fishing communities...|$|R
40|$|An {{ecosystem}} approach means {{different things to}} different people. As a result the concept of <b>ecosystem-based</b> fishery <b>management</b> is evolving and it has no universal definition or consistent application. As regards ecosystem modeling, most economic models of fishery ignore the linkages to lower trophic levels. In particular, environmental data and other bottom-up information is widely disregarded. The objective {{of this paper is to}} provide a critical review of concepts and ecological economic models relating to <b>ecosystem-based</b> fishery <b>management</b> especially to the environmental issues. The paper started by reviewing basic concepts related to <b>ecosystem-based</b> fishery <b>management</b> and the economic value of ecosystems. Then it aimed to review the development of ecosystem modeling with emphasis on economic aspects of ecology. This was followed by a presentation of the applications of <b>ecosystem-based</b> fishery <b>management</b> in practice. The paper concluded with some critical discussions and brought together conclusions derived from previous literature reviews. We found that although the concept of <b>ecosystem-based</b> fishery <b>management</b> has no universal definition, there is a widespread agreement about the need to implement the {{ecosystem approach}} for fisheries in practice. We also revealed that nutrient flow plays a crucial role in an ecosystem. In addition, it has many properties such as recycling and exchanging between consumers and producers, which are similar to monetary flows in an economy. Therefore, nutrients should be chosen as the currency in ecological economic models. Ecosystem approach, fisheries management, ecological economic models...|$|R

EBM also incorporates data analysis of various interactions over different amounts of time and space.

40|$|Keywords: Ecosystem-based {{fisheries}} management; marine reserves; marine protected areas; social capital; institutional analysis; Turks and Caicos Islands; Nassau grouper Many tropical fisheries {{around the}} world are in crisis because of the depletion of valuable reef species and the destruction of habitat upon which they depend. The complexity of reef fisheries and lack of management resources in southern nations limit the potential effectiveness of policies that focus on single species. As a result, <b>ecosystem-based</b> fisheries <b>management</b> is increasingly viewed as the only real alternative for managing these tropical reef fisheries. There is a widely held view that the devolution of management power from central government managers to local communities is central to the <b>ecosystem-based</b> fisheries <b>management</b> process and that marine reserves are the primary tool by which to implement <b>ecosystem-based</b> fisheries <b>management.</b> Marine reserves can protect or enhance multiple ecosystem services simultaneously and arguments are often made that they are more cost-effective than other management options because they are easy to monitor and enforce. The first theoretically-oriented part of this research emphasizes the role that social capital - the norms, networks and governance infrastructure that facilitates mutually advantageous collective action - plays in <b>ecosystem-based</b> fisheries <b>management.</b> In {{the second part of the}} research, I illustrate the utility of taking an institutional analysis approach to <b>ecosystem-based</b> fisheries <b>management</b> policy by examining the case of Nassau grouper (Epinephelus striatus) conservation and fisheries management in the Turks and Caicos Islands. While the focus of this case study is a single, small island nation, I believe that the results - that there are substantial incentives for private sector and government actors to oppose implementation of marine reserves - have broader relevance in the debate over the use of marine reserves for tropical fisheries management and conservation. Marine reserves are widely viewed as cost-effective, all-purpose tools for fisheries enhancement and conservation, yet my results suggest that there are policy alternatives - in this case, a commercial trade ban on Nassau grouper in tourist-oriented restaurants - that are much more likely to be effectively implemented and that should be substantially more cost-effective than marine reserves. Market-oriented policy tools should not be under-emphasized in <b>ecosystem-based</b> fisheries <b>management.</b> In instances where local social capital is lacking, they may actually have a higher likelihood of achieving conservation objectives and be more cost-effective than poorly supported marine reserves or `paper parks`...|$|R

50|$|<b>Ecosystem-based</b> <b>management</b> {{is seen as}} a {{critical}} planning and management framework for conserving or restoring ecosystems though it is still not widely implemented (Tallis et al. 2010). An ecosystem approach addresses many relationships across spatial, biological, and organizational scales and is a goal-driven approach to restoring and sustaining ecosystems and functions (Szaro et al. 1998). In addition, <b>ecosystem-based</b> <b>management</b> involves community influence as well as planning and management from local, regional and national government bodies and management agencies. All must be in collaboration in order to develop a desired future of ecosystem conditions, particularly where ecosystems have undergone radical degradation and change (Szaro et al. 1998). To move forward, <b>ecosystem-based</b> <b>management</b> should be approached through adaptive management, allowing flexibility and inclusiveness to deal with constant environmental, societal, and political change (Slocombe 1998b).|$|E

40|$|Although a {{consensus}} in marine science is developing {{on the need}} to adopt <b>ecosystem-based</b> fishery <b>management,</b> few studies try to quantify the context-specific gains from implementing it. Using a multi-species bioeconomic model for a Caribbean reef community, we determine the optimal harvesting rates for predator and prey species and ask how this more comprehensive optimization differs from traditional single-species approaches. We also identify tradeoffs when the objective of the manager includes nonfishing values. We find that the optimal solution when accounting for nonfishing values can include temporary or permanent fishing moratoriums in contrast to continuous fishing at low levels when only fishing profits are considered. We also show that the greatest gains from <b>ecosystem-based</b> fishery <b>management</b> are not from improved estimation of the trophic coupling, but from reforming the social and economic management of individual fish stocks and by explicitly incorporating a broader set of values into management decisions...|$|R
5000|$|The idea of <b>ecosystem-based</b> <b>management</b> {{began to}} catch on and {{projects}} throughout American National Parks reflected the idea of protecting an ecosystem in its entirety and not based on legal or ecological restrictions as previously used. Jim Agee and Darryll Johnson published a book-length report on managing ecosystems in 1988 explaining the theoretical framework management. While they did not fully embrace <b>ecosystem-based</b> <b>management</b> by still calling for [...] "ecologically defined boundaries", they stated the importance of [...] "clearly stated management goals, interagency cooperation, monitoring of management results, and leadership at the national policy levels" [...] (Grumbine 1994). Most importantly they demanded the recognition of human influence. It was argued that scientists must {{keep in mind the}} [...] "complex social context of their work" [...] and always be moving towards [...] "socially desirable conditions" [...] (Grumbine 1994). This need to understand the social aspects of scientific management is the fundamental step from ecological management to <b>ecosystem-based</b> <b>management.</b> Although it continues to become recognized, a debate over <b>ecosystem-based</b> <b>management</b> continues. Grumbine (1994) believes, while the approach has evolved, it has not been fully incorporated into management practices because the most effective forms of it have yet to be seen. He articulates that the current ecological climate calls for the most holistic approach of ecological management. This is in part due to the rapid decline in biodiversity and because of the constant state of flux in societal and political views of nature. Conflicts over public interest and understanding of the natural world have created social and political climates that require interagency cooperation, which stands as a backbone for <b>ecosystem-based</b> <b>management.</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} we show how {{substantial}} gains towards the goals of <b>ecosystem-based</b> fisheries <b>management</b> (EBFM) {{can be achieved by}} different single-species management. We show that fishing has much less impact on stocks if fish are caught after they have reached the size (Lopt) where growth rate and cohort biomass are maximum. To demonstrate our point we compare the impact of three fishing scenarios on 9 stocks from the North Sea and the Baltic. Scenario (1) is the current fishing regime, scenario (2) is a new management regime proposed by the European Commission, aiming for maximum sustainable yield obtained from all stocks, and scenario (3) is set so that it achieves the same yield as scenario (2), albeit with fishing on sizes beyond Lopt. Results show that scenarios (2) and (3) are significant improvements compared to current fishing practice. However, scenario (3) consistently shows least impact on the stocks, with seven-fold higher biomass of demersal fishes and an age structure similar to an unfished stock. This allows juveniles and adults to better fulfil their ecological roles, a major step towards the goals of <b>ecosystem-based</b> fisheries <b>management.</b> We give examples where scenario (3) is practiced in successful fisheries. We present a new interpretation of the relative yield per recruit isopleth diagram with indication of a new target area for fisheries operating within the context of EBFM. We present a new expression of the relative biomass per recruit isopleth diagram, which supports our analysis. We conclude that size matters for precautionary and <b>ecosystem-based</b> fisheries <b>management</b> and present a list of additional advantages associated with fishing at Lopt...|$|R
40|$|Indicator {{systems are}} seen as central tools for <b>ecosystem-based</b> {{fisheries}} <b>management,</b> helping to steer fisheries towards sustainability by providing timely and useful information to decision-makers. Without testing hypotheses about the links between policies and outcomes, however, indicator systems may {{do little more than}} promote ad hoc policies, possibly even prolonging the transition to sustainable fisheries.

A modified IAD framework is developed that transparently encompasses both process-oriented pressure-state-response (PSR) and structurally oriented sustainable livelihood indicator frameworks, thus providing a platform for <b>ecosystem-based</b> fisheries <b>management</b> policy experiment design and monitoring. An institutional approach to fisheries management facilitates critical examination of important cross-cutting issues, including assumptions regarding what comprises sustainability and how market, government and civil society organizations use strategic investments in capital assets and institutions to achieve sustainability objectives.
