2500|$|In the pre-writ period, the Liberal {{advertising}} featured Dalton McGuinty {{speaking to}} the camera, leaning against a tree while snow falls, saying [...] "People hear me say that I'll fix our hospitals and fix our schools and yet keep taxes down. Am I an optimist? Maybe. What I'm not is cynical, or jaded, or tired. I don't owe favours to special interests or old friends or political cronies. Together, we can make Ontario {{the envy of the}} world, once again. And, I promise you this, no one will work <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> will to create that Ontario." ...|$|E
2500|$|May later blamed {{her actions}} on fatigue and insisted she hadn't {{had too much}} to drink. [...] "I didn't have a lot of wine," [...] May said, [...] "but it may have hit me <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> thought it would". When {{questioned}} if she should resign, May responded that [...] "a lot of people have given bad press gallery speeches and have gone on to be Prime Minister or gone on to lead other aspects of their lives, time will tell." [...] May was quick to admit that her remarks at the annual press gallery dinner in Gatineau, Que., were a poor attempt at comedy. However, she said they shouldn't detract from her political track record. [...] President of the Treasury Board Tony Clement and NDP House Leader Peter Julian said Monday afternoon that May's apology was sufficient. [...] "Look, she's apologized which was appropriate and I'm going to leave the matter at that," [...] Clement told reporters. Laura Peck, senior partner at TransformLeaders.ca, said, [...] "She has apologized. She's done the right thing, she's apologized," [...] Peck said. [...] "One mistake is forgivable, two is a pattern." [...] It's more of an [...] "inside Ottawa beltway" [...] thing anyway, Peck added.|$|E

5000|$|Pudge works <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> anyone <b>I</b> know, {{because he}} sets goals {{for himself and}} then follows through. I think he's the {{ultimate}} professional. Former White Sox manager, Jim Fregosi ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{persistent}} dropping will, it is said, in time {{wear away}} considerably <b>harder</b> material <b>than</b> <b>I</b> am composed of. Words are also, one could fancy, even more efficacious than water in that respect." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] said Austin. [...] "There is a Spanish boat to Las Palmas to-morrow, {{and nothing}} to keep me now I have got the money. I don't mind admitting that the asking for it was <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> {{anything}} <b>I</b> did in Africa." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{take it all}} <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> do," [...] I {{returned}} as I sat down beside her. And then I added, smiling: [...] "Have you written to his mother?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Jack, I'm {{going to}} root <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> ever did in my life," [...] said Ruth, {{as she held}} up a banner marked Colby Hall and another marked Clearwater Hall.|$|E
6000|$|... "Go now!" [...] she said, and {{her voice}} had a faintly grating ring. [...] "Since you cannot help me, you shall, at least, not make it <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> can bear." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Ces idées sont plus difficiles à comprendre que je ne pensais."("These {{ideas are}} <b>harder</b> to {{understand}} <b>than</b> <b>I</b> thought.") ...|$|R
60|$|Poor thing! {{the bare}} {{idea of a}} man marrying her for his own selfish and {{mercenary}} ends had never entered her head. The task I had set myself began {{to look like a}} <b>harder</b> task <b>than</b> <b>I</b> had bargained for.|$|R
6000|$|... "True. But {{my studies}} in civil {{engineering}} {{have been a}} good deal <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> anything <b>I</b> tackled at school. If it wasn't for Mr. Ramsdell, the old civil engineer who is coaching Roger and me, I don't know how I would possibly have gotten along." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know; I'm {{curious about}} {{what they think of}} me. Anyway, I found the thing <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> expected. Why didn't you tell me Mrs. Colston was {{bringing}} her sister?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Home they went; and Rose {{fell asleep}} saying to herself, [...] "It was <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> thought, but I'm glad I did it, and I truly don't want any reward but Phebe's pleasure." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You may be right, Louis; I may be not {{sufficiently}} altered since I was a boy. I have struck <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> intended more than once, and I {{have told the}} boys so.' ...|$|E
6000|$|And with a fate-defiant smile, half {{bitter and}} half cheerful, Tom rose {{and went down}} again to his mates, and stopped their {{inquiries}} by--"What's done can't be mended, and needn't be mentioned; whining won't make me work the <b>harder,</b> and <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> ever <b>I</b> must work." ...|$|R
6000|$|On the 4th of April I {{am going}} to preside at a public dinner {{for the benefit of}} the printers; and if you were a guest at that table, wouldn't I smite you on the shoulder, <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> ever <b>I</b> rapped the well-beloved back of Washington Irving at the City Hotel in New York! ...|$|R
2500|$|Using his birds as {{an image}} for his own predicament, Jones said in the same Sports Illustrated piece: [...] "I spent all my life in my dad's cage. I could never be 100 percent of who I am until I left it. But because of him, nothing bothers me. I'll never face {{anything}} stronger and <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> what <b>I</b> already have." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. Only I am very tired. Traveling so far by rail is <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> imagined. I {{did have}} rather {{a long wait}} after {{arriving}} at the station, but I can't {{say that it was}} lonely." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My dear Sophy,--We {{have had}} a good examination, I think; perhaps rather <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> expected. Woolecombe and Chancellor Harrington spoke to me this morning, thanking me for my papers, and telling me to read the Gospel at the Ordination.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Appen so, an' a'!--What does he do, {{more than}} {{eat and drink}} and work?--an' {{take it out of}} hisself a sight <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> do, by th' looks of him.--What's it matter, if he eats a bit more or drinks a bit more--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{intend to}} spend the rest of my life in giving away the money I have earned--all of it. I do not intend to spare myself, and giving will be <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> earning. <b>I</b> shall found {{institutions}} for research of disease, hospitals, playgrounds, libraries, and schools. And I shall make the university here one of the best in the country. What more, may I ask, would you have me do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{notice no}} {{allowance}} for unexpected difficulties, which {{are bound to}} crop up," [...] Mowbray presently remarked. [...] "The work will, as usually happens, prove <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> it looks. <b>I</b> do not {{see how you can}} finish it before the frost comes." ...|$|R
5000|$|Arthur Penn, who {{directed}} Bonnie and Clyde, described Beatty as [...] "the perfect producer", adding, [...] "He makes everyone demand {{the best of}} themselves. Warren stays with a picture through editing, mixing and scoring. He plain works <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> anyone else <b>I</b> have ever seen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Peg, Place beat me {{over here}} last year, beat me 6-3. They hit me <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> ever was hit before, I guess. You {{went down to}} Washington, Worry said, to look them over. Tell me what you think--how you sized them up." ...|$|E
6000|$|The others rode on, and {{the girl}} turned to Winston. [...] "I made you a promise and {{did my best to}} keep it, but I find it <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> fancied it would be," [...] she said. [...] "I want you to release me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's the bread-winner," [...] Saxon replied. [...] "He works <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> <b>I,</b> and I've {{got more}} time than I {{know what to do}} with--time to burn. Besides, I want to wait on him because I love to, and because... well, anyway, I want to." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{is that in}} me," [...] Lingard murmured, deeply, [...] "which {{would set}} my heart <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> a stone. <b>I</b> am King Tom, Rajah Laut, and fit to look any man hereabouts in the face. I have my name to take care of. Everything rests on that." ...|$|R
30|$|Table  5 {{shows the}} growing amount of {{variables}} and constraints for tighter linearizations leading to higher solution times. While {{the number of}} variables and constraints only slightly deviates from the average within each row, the solution time is in general higher for higher non-electric gas loads. Moreover, Case II {{turns out to be}} <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> Case <b>I,</b> which {{can be seen from the}} average solution time and the higher number of instances that hit the time limit.|$|R
5000|$|Steele {{said that}} Halpern {{approached}} him {{one night after}} Steele had just finished refereeing a fight {{and told him that}} he wanted to be a referee. Steele recounted, [...] "I have had numerous people come to me and say that. I always tell them, 'I will meet you at the gym Monday.' He was there Monday. Most other guys never show up. He worked hard. He worked <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> anyone <b>I</b> had ever seen. He wanted to be the best." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will think}} better of this, Bourdon," [...] the girl resumed. [...] "We are going south, and cannot quit the river with this wind, {{but you could}} not have a better time to go north, unless the wind blows <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> think it does." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You must wear it; I shall {{feel real}} {{mean if you}} don't. You worked <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> did, {{and it was only}} luck my getting this. Do, Bab, to please me," [...] he persisted, awkwardly trying to fasten the {{ornament}} in the middle of Bab's' white apron.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{want to be}} turbulent," [...] Walter said; [...] "but if the Aldersgate {{boys will}} defy us, {{what are we to}} do? I don't hit <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> can help, and if Jonah Harris would leave his head {{unguarded}} I could not help hitting it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{were within}} {{a few feet of}} the edge of the cliff. I struck him <b>harder,</b> Perhaps, <b>than</b> <b>I</b> had intended, and he went over. I stood there and hooked down, but I could see nothing. I heard the {{crashing}} of some bushes, and after that--silence. I even called out to him, but there was no reply. Some time later, Robert and I searched the cliff and the bay below for his body. We discovered nothing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't mean to {{say that}} I wish you always to live here, for, maybe, Stoubes is a more {{pleasant}} abode, standing in a fair country, and with the climate somewhat less <b>hard</b> <b>than</b> this; but <b>I</b> should like you to come up here, at times, and to be known as Forster of Yardhope." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I don't {{think the}} Lonesome Duck {{was right in}} saying that," [...] {{answered}} the Wizard, gravely, [...] "but {{it is possible that}} their enchantment will be <b>harder</b> to overcome <b>than</b> <b>I</b> expected. I'll do my best, of course, and no one can do more than his best." ...|$|R
