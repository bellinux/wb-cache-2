Robert Herrick alludes to {{their association with}} death {{in a number of}} poems. Among the English romantic movement writers none is better known than William Wordsworth's short 1804 poem <b>I</b> <b>Wandered</b> Lonely as a Cloud which has become linked in the popular mind with the daffodils that form its main image. Wordsworth also included the daffodil in other poems. Yet the description given of daffodils by his sister, Dorothy is just as poetic, if not more so, just that her poetry was prose and appears almost an unconscious imitation of the first section of the Homeric Hymn to Demeter (see Greek culture, above). Among their contemporaries, Keats refers to daffodils among those things capable of bringing [...] "joy for ever".|$|E
