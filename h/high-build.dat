The resulting roller rotates {{at the same speed}} as the web in a roll-to-roll machine. The benefits are high output rates and long rolls of product. This {{is the only way to}} make <b>high-build</b> fully patterned printing/coating as a continuous process, and has been widely used for manufacturing textured wallpapers.|$|E

Polyesters are widely used as a finish on high-quality wood products such as guitars, pianos and vehicle/yacht interiors. Thixotropic properties of spray-applicable polyesters make them ideal for use on open-grain timbers, as they can quickly fill wood grain, with a <b>high-build</b> film thickness per coat. Cured polyesters can be sanded and polished to a high-gloss, durable finish.|$|E
50|$|Bi-membranes {{have been}} used {{extensively}} throughout Australia where 2 membranes are paired together—typically 2 coats of water based epoxy as a 'sealer' and stop the internal vapor pressure of the moist concrete exploding bubbles of vapor up underneath the membrane when exposed to hot sun. The bond strength of epoxy to concrete is stronger than the internal bond strength of concrete so the membranes won't 'blow' off {{the wall in the}} sun. Epoxies are very brittle so they are paired up with an overcoat of <b>high-build</b> flexible water based acrylic membrane in multiple coats of different colors to ensure film coverage—this is reinforced with non-woven polyproplene textile in corners and changes in direction.|$|E
5000|$|... ==New {{developments}} in Removable, Eco-friendly and customizable coatings== A recent trend in paint protection is DIY and professional applications that are roller on, brush on, and spray on <b>high-build</b> films, {{that provide a}} rugged protective finish and are removable. One such product is PaintArmorDIY and PaintArmorPRO by ColorXlabs. This is a water-borne, ecological protective coating. Some advancements are 1) Removability 2) Infinite thickness adjustment and 3) Color matching to OEM Colors. A rugged, textured finish is the result, with capabilities to match any factory color. In the off-road industry, popularity of rugged bed liner coatings on body panels has been taking off. PaintArmorDIY is similar to textured surfaces like Line-X or Rhino Liner without as much roughness and easier to care for surface that remains removable.|$|E

In 2008, SCDOT issued a problem statement for research supporting development of guidelines for pavement marking applications. Objectives of this research focused on determination of evidence-based guidelines and recommendations to support pavement marking best practices for consistent implementation across the state. Through the use of a data-driven research methodology and measured retroreflectivity values systematically collected at selected representative control sites, lifecycle models and degradation models were determined for waterborne, <b>high-build</b> and thermoplastic pavement marking applications for the State’s primary and secondary road network. A comparison of marking lifecycles was performe...|$|E

Figure 1 shows the floor plan and dimensions of the room. Surfaces and Partition Wall and floor surfaces in the room were covered with a 4 " shotcrete layer, followed by an Oxyguard 100 epoxy primer coat (see specifications in Appendix 1) designed to chemically bond to concrete surfaces. Two spray coats of Oxyguard 305 a gray <b>high-build</b> finishing epoxy formed a finishing layer about 1 mm thick. The epoxy was sprayed directly on to the existing shotcrete surface with no remedial preparation except for the removal of any loose material and a spray cleaning with water. The partition, shown in the floor plan, was installed to separate the semi-clean area from the clean area. It was constructed of drywall and plywood and sealed at the concrete surfaces using caulking and/or polyurethane foam. A 36 inch standard wood door and frame with a weather stri...|$|E

Purpose – The {{purpose of this paper}} is to identify the factors present in successful energy efficiency investments that might indicate how to resolve the landlord-tenant dilemma in existing and new commercial property. Design/methodology/approach – The paper reviews literature to indicate the importance of energy efficiency in buildings and to explore the barriers to such investments, including problematic landlord-tenant relationships. Such relationships have been investigated by the International Energy Agency, and a similar approach is used here in two case studies in new and existing buildings. These studies explore the nature of landlord-tenant relationships and the importance of policy and standards of building performance. Findings – In neither case did landlord-tenant issues constitute barriers to investments in energy efficiency, however, these investments were made for other reasons than simple cost savings. Construction of new commercial property to Passivhaus standards ensures a <b>high-build</b> quality and a comfortable building with low-energy costs. The added value to tenants may justify the cost of construction. The cost of investments in energy efficient buildings can also be justified by the enhanced reputation of landlords which may be more valuable than a DEC rating. In neither case was the commercial Green Deal felt to be an attractive funding mechanism. Practical implications – Conclusions based on these case studies must be regarded as tentative, so future studies of successful energy efficient buildings should be undertaken to explore the motivation to invest, particularly the relative importance of indirect benefits of energy efficiency. Originality/value – One of the case study buildings is exceptionally energy efficient and is the result of a particularly open and effective contractual relationship. Further study of such cases may suggest a new approach to landlord-tenant problems of energy efficiency, even in refurbishment of existing buildings...|$|E
40|$|The ends of {{prestressed}} concrete beams under expansion joints are often exposed to moisture and chlorides. Left unprotected, the moisture and chlorides {{come in contact}} with the ends of the prestressing strands and/or the mild reinforcing, resulting in corrosion. Once deterioration begins, it progresses unless some process is employed to address it. Deterioration can lead to loss of bearing area and therefore a reduction in bridge capacity. Previous research has looked into the use of concrete coatings (silanes, epoxies, fiber-reinforced polymers, etc.) for protecting {{prestressed concrete}} beam ends but found that little to no laboratory research has been done related to the performance of these coatings in this specific type of application. The Iowa Department of Transportation (DOT) currently specifies coating the ends of exposed prestressed concrete beams with Sikagard 62 (a <b>high-build,</b> protective, solvent-free, epoxy coating) at the precast plant prior to installation on the bridge. However, no physical testing of Sikagard 62 in this application has been completed. In addition, the Iowa DOT continues to see deterioration in the prestressed concrete beam ends, even those treated with Sikagard 62. The goals of this project were to evaluate the performance of the Iowa DOT-specified beam-end coating as well as other concrete coating alternatives based on the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) T 259 - 80 chloride ion penetration test and to test their performance on in-service bridges throughout the duration of the project. In addition, alternative beam-end forming details were developed and evaluated for their potential to mitigate and/or eliminate the deterioration caused by corrosion of the prestressing strands on prestressed concrete beam ends used in bridges with expansion joints. The alternative beam-end details consisted of individual strand blockouts, an individual blockout for a cluster of strands, dual blockouts for two clusters of strands, and drilling out the strands after they are flush cut. The goal of all of the forming alternatives was to offset the ends of the prestressing strands from the end face of the beam and then cover them with a grout/concrete layer, thereby limiting or eliminating their exposure to moisture and chlorides...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 06 Seattle {{is one of}} {{the fastest}} growing {{high-tech}} cities in the United States. Under the Washington State Growth Management Act, there is a finite urban land supply for housing development within the designated Urban Growth Areas. In return, Seattle’s housing affordability is in crisis. The city of Seattle formed the Housing Affordability and Livability Agenda (HALA) task force in 2014 and it produced 65 recommendations for how the city can facilitate the construction of 20, 000 affordable housing units and 30, 000 market rate housing units over the next ten years. One of the recommendations (Strategy L. 1 : Prioritize Use of Public Property for Affordable Housing) proposes that the city revise its existing reuse and disposition policies for surplus and underutilized publicly-owned property to prioritize these properties for the construction of affordable multifamily housing. This thesis seeks to add to existing research by examining one question: How feasible and effective would a policy be to prioritize the use of surplus and underutilized publicly-owned land for the development of affordable housing to meet HALA’s growth target? Any program intended to address affordable housing concerns must be palatable, practical, and have a reasonable chance of producing positive results for all parties involved in order to succeed. This research presents a grounded theory study that uses both qualitative and quantitative measures to document the complexity of the issues associated with using publicly-owned surplus and underutilized land for affordable housing development, including comparative case studies and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) land analyses. The feasibility and effectiveness of a revised property reuse and disposition policy is established using three development scenarios (low-build, medium-build, and <b>high-build)</b> for existing surplus and underutilized public land based on a buildable lands analysis. The research and its subsequent analysis provide a blueprint for understanding the challenges associated with housing development on public land. The conclusion of this research is that modifications to the city’s existing reuse and disposition policies would present minimal-to-no additional costs to implement and could result in the development of between 495 and 4, 450 affordable housing units, or between 2. 5 % and 22. 25 % of HALA’s target for affordable housing units. The achievement depends on how aggressive the policies were enforced, but it would require robust political support from the city and creative development approaches to be most effective towards the development of more affordable housing...|$|E
