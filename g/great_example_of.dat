25|$|The arts of Southeast Asia have {{affinity}} with {{the arts of}} other areas. Dance in much of Southeast Asia includes movement of the hands {{as well as the}} feet, to express the dance's emotion and meaning of the story that the ballerina is going to tell the audience. Most of Southeast Asia introduced dance into their court; in particular, Cambodian royal ballet represented them in the early 7th century before the Khmer Empire, which was highly influenced by Indian Hinduism. Apsara Dance, famous for strong hand and feet movement, is a <b>great</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> Hindu symbolic dance.|$|E
25|$|This amazingly gruesome predatory {{behavior}} is a <b>great</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> {{a collaboration between}} solitary and cooperative predation. The first ant will initially act alone in her predation, but after that other ants will come and join in the hunt, and still other will travel back to the domatia to recruit even more ants to aid in holding down and eventually dismembering the prey. This also demonstrates how much more effective a group of individuals can be than an individual working on its own. A single ant {{would never be able}} to kill such large prey; they are only able to do so by incorporating communication and cooperation.|$|E
25|$|From 1408 to 1418, Fra Angelico {{was at the}} Dominican friary of Cortona, {{where he}} painted frescoes, now mostly destroyed, in the Dominican Church {{and may have been}} {{assistant}} to Gherardo Starnina or a follower of his. Between 1418 and 1436 he was at the convent of Fiesole, where he also executed a number of frescoes for the church and the Altarpiece, which was deteriorated but has since been restored. A predella of the Altarpiece remains intact and is conserved in the National Gallery, London, and is a <b>great</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> Fra Angelico's ability.

25|$|Southeast Asia {{was slow}} to adopt Middle Eastern {{architectural}} styles. Islam entered Indonesia in the 15th-century via Java island, during which period the dominant religion in Southeast Asia included a variety of pagan groups. Introduction of Islam was peaceful. Existing architectural features in Indonesia such as the candi bentar gate, paduraksa (normally marks entrance to the most sacred precincts), and the sacred pyramidal roof was used for Islamic architecture. For centuries, Indonesian mosques lacked domes or minarets, both considered a Middle Eastern origin. Indonesian original mosques feature multi-layered pyramidal roofs and no minaret. Prayer are called by striking a prayer's drum known as beduk. The minaret of the Menara Kudus Mosque is a <b>great</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> Indonesian architecture. Indonesian mosque architecture also features strong influence from the Middle Eastern architecture styles.|$|E
25|$|A <b>great</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> this {{symbiosis}} are the mangroves in the gulf, {{which require}} tidal flow and {{a combination of}} fresh and salt water for growth, and act as nurseries for many crabs, small fish, and insects; these fish and insects {{are the source of}} food for many of the marine birds that feed on them. Mangroves are a diverse group of shrubs and trees belonging to the genus Avicennia or Rhizophora that flourish in the salt water shallows of the gulf, and are the most important habitats for small crustaceans that dwell in them. They are as crucial an indicator of biological health {{on the surface of the}} water, as the corals are to biological health of the gulf in deeper waters. Mangroves' ability to survive the salt water through intricate molecular mechanisms, their unique reproductive cycle, and their ability to grow in the most oxygen-deprived waters have allowed them extensive growth in hostile areas of the gulf. Unfortunately, however, with the advent of artificial island development, most of their habitat is destroyed, or occupied by man-made structures. This has had a negative impact on the crustaceans that rely on the mangrove, and in turn on the species that feed on them.|$|E
25|$|Bhishma {{is often}} {{considered}} as a <b>great</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> devotion and sacrifice. His name itself is an honour to him - Bhishma which means severe because he took a severe vow to remain celibate for life and Pitamah which means Grandfather. Bhishma {{was one of the}} greatest Bramhacharis of all time. Accumulation of Ojas due to his Bramhacharyam made him the strongest warrior of the era. He had stature and personality that in those times were fit for kings. He was a true Kshatriya as well as a disciplined ascetic - a rare combination. Like a true Kshatriya, he never unnecessarily exhibited passion and anger. A symbol of truth and duty, the benevolent Bhishma was in all senses a true human. It is unfortunate that a person as noble as Bhishma saw a life full of loneliness, frustration and sadness. But that was how Vashishta's curse was supposed to unfold. Bhishma's human birth was destined to be marked with suffering, and that was how his life transpired right till the last moment; even his death was very painful. But the strong as steel character which he possessed ensured that he never shied away from his duty, and never stopped loving those dear to him.|$|E

25|$|Neoteny is {{commonly}} seen in flightless insects like the {{females in the}} order Strepsiptera. The flightless trait in insects has evolved many separate times; environments that {{may have contributed to}} the separate evolution of this trait are: high altitudes, isolation on islands, and insects that reside in colder climates. These environmental factors may be responsible for the flightless trait, because in these situations it would be disadvantageous to have a population that is more dispersed, so flightlessness would be favored due to the boundaries it poses to dispersal. Also, in cooler temperatures heat is lost more rapidly through wings, thus the circumstance favors flightlessness. Another couple of main points to note about insects are that the females in certain groups become sexually mature without metamorphosing into adulthood, and some insects which grow up in certain conditions do not ever develop wings. Flightlessness in some female insects has been linked to higher fecundity, this would increase the fitness of the individual because the female is producing more offspring and therefore passing on more of her genes. In those instances, neoteny occurs because it is more advantageous for the females to remain flightless in order to conserve energy which thereby increases their fecundity. Aphids are a <b>great</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> insects that may never develop wings due to their environmental setting. If resources are abundant there is no need to grow wings and disperse. When the nutrition of a host plant is abundant, aphids may not grow wings, remaining on the host plant for the duration of their lives; however, if the resources become diminished, their offspring may develop wings in order to disperse to other host plants.|$|E

McNutt also wrote about the showrunners going back to yet to be used story lines from the books, and transposing them into later seasons, such as the Kingsmoot plot, noting [...] "It's a <b>great</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> the show's ability to adapt the books in a non-linear fashion, here wholesale moving a storyline where it serves a clearer purpose." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{narrative}} team {{wanted to}} establish a new villain who was both powerful and intelligent in Halo Wars 2, which led to the introduction of the Brute warlord Atriox. Grace cited the Arbiter as a <b>great</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> a character who was unique within his species; he noted that this trait was applied to the Brutes with the creation of Atriox. To subvert the notion that Brutes are just the [...] "dumb muscle" [...] of the Covenant, Atriox is presented as a smart commander that takes advantage of the alliance's collapse. Inspiration for the character was drawn from folklore legends such as Excalibur and stories of an underling rising to power. While Atriox's faction, the Banished, have been referenced in previous Halo media, Halo Wars 2 marks their debut as the primary enemy faction. Real-world events and historical mercenary groups were a source of inspiration when designing the Banished. From the beginning, Isabel was designed to exhibit flawed behavior to distinguish her from other AI characters in the series. Ellen Ripley from the 1986 film Aliens was a particular influence for Isabel's characterization.|$|E
