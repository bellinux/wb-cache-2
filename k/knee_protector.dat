2500|$|The Māori {{name for}} the Southern Cross is Te Punga ("the anchor"). It is {{thought of as the}} anchor of Tama-rereti's waka (the Milky Way), while the Pointers are its rope. In Tonga it is known as Toloa ("duck"); it is {{depicted}} as a duck flying south, with one of his wings (δ Crucis) wounded because Ongo tangata ("two men", α and β Centauri) threw a stone at it. The Coalsack is known as Humu (the [...] "triggerfish"), because of its shape. In Samoa the constellation is called Sumu ("triggerfish") because of its rhomboid shape, while α and β Centauri are called Luatagata (Two Men), just as they are in Tonga. The peoples of the Solomon Islands saw several figures in the Southern Cross. These included a <b>knee</b> <b>protector</b> and a net used to catch Palolo worms. Neighboring peoples in the Marshall Islands saw these stars as a fish.|$|E
25|$|Their {{equipment}} {{consists of}} <b>knee</b> <b>protectors,</b> kevlar helmets and anti-shrapnel vests. The ARD's main light infantry vehicle is the AGF.|$|R
50|$|Riders are {{generally}} required {{to wear a}} full-face, racing-style motorcycle helmet. Open-face and half helmets are not recommended. Motorcycle gloves and elbow protectors are compulsory, and protectors for shoulders, chest, and back are recommended. Other choices for protection are a leather jacket or a leather racing suit with built-in protectors. On the lower body, riders must wear <b>knee</b> <b>protectors</b> on pants. Protectors for hips and shins are also recommended. Riders may wear boots without laces, or racing boots.|$|R
50|$|The contestants {{are given}} trainer shoes, and elbow and <b>knee</b> <b>protectors,</b> but {{otherwise}} remain fully dressed and must {{participate in the}} clothes that they are already wearing to the show. Almost all contestants {{fall into one of}} the two pools in clothes ranging from casual wear or fancy dress to expensive dresses or suits which are ruined by the water. The pools are approximately 1.3m deep and filled with cold water, and falling from the rollers results in total immersion.|$|R
40|$|As part of {{the injury}} profylaxes in Denmark a {{questionnaire}} investigation was undertaken in 14 randomly chosen ice hockey teams [...] out of 266 players, 210 answered (79 %). The injury incidence per player per 1000 hours was 4. 7, i. e. 1. 5 in training and 38. 0 in match. Half of the injuries were localised to the head (28 %) and lower extremities (27 %), 19 % to the upper extremities and 7 % to the back. Of these 48 % were contusions. Knee and elbow injuries were of longest duration. The necessity for increased shock absorption in helmets and barriers as well as built-in rotational and collateral stabilizers in the existing <b>knee</b> <b>protectors</b> for injury prophylaxis is stressed...|$|R
50|$|Kolokotronis {{sported a}} brace of {{engraved}} pistols and an ornate cavalry-style cuirass, {{which are now}} {{on display at the}} National Historical Museum, Athens. Richard Church was depicted wearing a similar helmet-and-cuirass outfit plus metal greaves and <b>knee</b> <b>protectors</b> with gilt lion's heads along with a braided version of the uniform of the unit's sister regiment, in a painting now housed in the Royal Gallery. Both of these romanticized outfits imitating Ancient Greek styles were probably intended for ceremony and were not worn in their entirety in combat, although Kolokotronis did sometimes wear the helmet when he fought, even after the regiment disbanded. As officers, they both would have had the privilege of wearing pistols, and in Kolokotronis' career as a klepht, the carrying of more than one pistol would not have been uncommon.|$|R
5000|$|Wilhelm, {{expanding}} on {{the main}} theme of the grounds, commissioned his own Achilles statue from the sculptor Johannes Götz who created an imposing bronze sculpture that stands tall as a guardian of the Gardens facing north toward the city.Archaeologist Reinhard Kekulé von Stradonitz, who was also the Kaiser's advisor, was invited by the Kaiser to come to Corfu to give him advice where to position the huge statue. The famous salute to Achilles from the Kaiser, which had been inscribed at the statue's base, was also created by Kekulé. The inscription read: [...] To the Greatest Greek from the Greatest German [...] The inscription was subsequently removed after WWII. The Kaiser's statue represents Achilles in full hoplite uniform with intricate detailing such as a relief of a gorgon's head at the shield, apparently to petrify any enemies, as well as lion heads as <b>knee</b> <b>protectors.</b> This tall statue is surrounded by palm trees that complement its graceful outline. Kaiser Wilhelm visited the place until 1914 when World War I was declared. The Kaiser also attended performances at the Municipal Theatre of Corfu while vacationing at the Achilleion.|$|R
60|$|The {{child had}} slid {{down from his}} <b>protector's</b> <b>knee,</b> and stood looking {{from one to the}} other gravely while this {{discussion}} was going on. What change of destiny was then going on for him in this simple formula of adoption, none could tell; but, surely, never orphan stranded on a foreign shore found home with hearts more true and loving.|$|R
25|$|Goalkeepers wear limited {{protection}} {{provided by}} padded pants, a padded chest <b>protector,</b> <b>knee</b> pads, and a helmet. The goalkeeper may also wear other protective {{equipment such as}} elbow pads and jock straps but bulky padding is not permitted. Goalkeepers do not use sticks and may use their hands to play the ball when they are within the goalkeeper's box. There, {{they are allowed to}} throw the ball out to their teammates provided that the ball touches the ground before the half court mark. When they are completely outside the box, goalkeepers are considered field players and are not allowed to touch the ball with their hands.|$|R
60|$|Powlet was an {{intelligent}} boy. He understood him at once, {{and went on}} with his work, a boy {{coming up at the}} moment with some white paint in his hand, and another with some blue. A white diamond was immediately planted on each cheek, and a blue circle under each eye, with a red spot in the centre of each. So far, the work was very striking and suggestive, but when Powlet finished off by drawing a series of blue, red, and white lines over Olaf's eyes, in the forms that usually indicate astonishment, added a red oval to the chin, with a blue spot in the middle of it, and stuck some feathers in his hair, the effect was absolutely tremendous, for it caused the native boys to yell with delight, and Snorro almost to fall off his <b>protector's</b> <b>knee</b> in a fit of juvenile hysterics.|$|R
5000|$|When {{performed}} live, [...] "Jocko Homo" [...] {{is often}} {{the centerpiece of the}} show. During most tours, Devo strips off part of their stage costumes during the bridge, removing their iconic jumpsuits to strip down to T-shirts, shorts, and <b>knee</b> and elbow <b>protectors,</b> and when possible Mark Mothersbaugh descends into the audience to lead them a call-and-response of [...] "Are We Not Men?/We Are Devo!" [...] which degenerates into monkey noises. The first performance of [...] "Jocko Homo" [...] in 1975 went on for over twenty minutes. A portion of this appears on the album DEVO Live: The Mongoloid Years. When asked to open for Sun Ra, as a joke they performed a half-hour rendition of the song to annoy the crowd, according to Mark Mothersbaugh in an interview in 1997: [...] "We'd play [...] "Jocko Homo" [...] for 30 minutes, and we wouldn't stop until people were actually fighting with us, trying to make us stop playing the song. We'd just keep going, [...] "Are we not men? We are Devo!" [...] for like 25 minutes, directed at people in an aggressive enough manner that even the most peace-lovin' hippie wanted to throw fists." ...|$|R
50|$|Riot control {{refers to}} the {{measures}} used by police, military, or other security forces to control, disperse, and arrest people {{who are involved in}} a riot, demonstration, or protest. If a riot is spontaneous and irrational, actions which cause people to stop and think for a moment (e.g. loud noises or issuing instructions in a calm tone) can be enough to stop it. However, these methods usually fail when there is severe anger with a legitimate cause, or the riot was planned or organized. Law enforcement officers or military personnel have long used less lethal weapons such as batons and whips to disperse crowds and detain rioters. Since the 1980s, riot control officers have also used tear gas, pepper spray, rubber bullets, and electric tasers. In some cases, riot squads may also use Long Range Acoustic Devices, water cannons, armoured fighting vehicles, aerial surveillance, police dogs or mounted police on horses. Officers performing riot control typically wear protective equipment such as riot helmets, face visors, body armor (vests, neck <b>protectors,</b> <b>knee</b> pads, etc.), gas masks and riot shields. However, there are also cases where lethal weapons are used to violently suppress a protest or riot, as in the Boston Massacre, Haymarket Massacre, Banana Massacre, Hungarian Revolution of 1956, Kent State Massacre, Soweto Uprising, Mendiola Massacre, Bloody Sunday (1905) and Bloody Sunday (1972).|$|R
500|$|Football is a full-contact sport, and {{injuries}} are relatively common. Most injuries occur during training sessions, particularly ones that involve contact between players. To {{try to prevent}} injuries, players are required to wear a set of equipment. At a minimum players must wear a football helmet {{and a set of}} shoulder pads, but individual leagues may require additional padding such as thigh pads and guards, <b>knee</b> pads, chest <b>protectors,</b> and mouthguards. Most injuries occur in the lower extremities, particularly in the knee, but a significant number also affect the upper extremities. The most common types of injuries are strains, sprains, bruises, fractures, dislocations, and concussions. Repeated concussions can increase a person's risk in later life for chronic traumatic encephalopathy and mental health issues such as dementia, Parkinson's disease, and depression. Concussions are often caused by helmet-to-helmet or upper-body contact between opposing players, although helmets have prevented more serious injuries such as skull fractures. Various programs are aiming to reduce concussions by reducing the frequency of helmet-to-helmet hits; USA Football's [...] "Heads Up Football" [...] program is aiming to reduce concussions in youth football by teaching coaches and players about the signs of a concussion, the proper way to wear football equipment and ensure it fits, and proper tackling methods that avoid helmet-to-helmet contact. However, a study in the Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine found that Heads Up Football was ineffective; the same study noted that more extensive reforms implemented by Pop Warner Little Scholars and its member teams were effective in significantly reducing concussion rates.|$|R
