25|$|The APG-70 {{radar system}} allows air crews to detect ground targets from longer ranges. One {{feature of this}} system is that after a sweep of a target area, the crew freezes the {{air-to-ground}} map then goes back into air-to-air mode to clear for air threats. During the air-to-surface weapon delivery, the pilot is capable of detecting, targeting and engaging air-to-air targets while the WSO designates the <b>ground</b> <b>target.</b> The APG-70 is {{to be replaced by}} the AN/APG-82(v)1 active electronically scanned array Radar (AESA) radar, which will begin flight tests in January 2010 with initial operational capability expected in 2014.|$|E
25|$|On Labor Day, Monday, 1 September 1952, {{a tornado}} hit Carswell Air Force Base, Fort Worth, Texas {{damaging}} aircraft of the 7th and 11th Bomber Wings' complement of B-36s. Some {{two thirds of}} the USAF's entire B-36 fleet were affected, as well as six aircraft being built at that point at Convair's Fort Worth plant. The base was shut down and operations transferred to Meacham Field. Joint repairs by Convair and the USAF got ten of the 61 B-36s running within two weeks and repaired the other 51 aircraft within five weeks. 18 of 19 heavily damaged aircraft (and the six damaged and unfinished aircraft at Convair) were repaired by May 1953. The 19th (#2051) had to be scrapped, and was used as a nuclear testing site <b>ground</b> <b>target.</b> One heavily damaged aircraft (#5712) was written off and rebuilt as the NB-36H Nuclear Reactor Testbed aircraft.|$|E
500|$|<b>Ground</b> <b>target</b> marking, {{which was}} a key tactic for day time strikes, was {{investigate}}d. Project 2531 was to investigate target marking munitions, and looked into warheads for the Mk 40 2.75” rocket motor, {{using a variety of}} chemiluminescent materials. [...] These were to be loaded with compounds developed under the US Navy’s Target Illumination and Recovery Aid (TIARA) program. Initially they used modified M151 high-explosive warheads, but found the amount of compound that could be contained provided poor results. [...] The Shed Light Task Force noted that a lighter case for these compounds was in development. A combination of red phosphorus and a flare was investigated in an attempt to provide a system that could be used at night or during the day.|$|E
40|$|International audienceMultiple <b>ground</b> <b>targets</b> {{tracking}} with a GMTI (<b>Ground</b> Moving <b>Target</b> Indicator) sensor {{is considered}} a challenging problem {{in order to establish}} battlefield assessment. An IMM algorithm with a variable structure is adapted to the road network and used to track multiple manoeuvring <b>ground</b> <b>targets.</b> However, the case of undetected targets due to terrain elevation or Doppler obscuration was not taken into account in our tracking process. In this paper, we present our approach to track <b>ground</b> <b>targets</b> with the possibility for the target to be undetected. The perceivability probability is computed to update the estimated state and a "sentinel" concept is used to palliate the association ambiguities when several targets enter and exit the same terrain mask...|$|R

2500|$|On 26 February, {{along with}} other aircraft, he {{conducted}} a raid on the Axis-held airfield at Tartu. Taranchiev personally destroyed three German aircraft on the ground during the attack. [...] By 18 March, Taranchiev had made 35 successful sorties attacking defense structures, railways, airfields and other targets flying an Il-2 ground attack aircraft. On 18 March, Taranchiev flew a sortie with four other Il-2s, attacking enemy troops and equipment {{in the area of}} Jaama-kyule, Kyarikuyula and Lastikolony in Estonia. During the attack, Taranchiev's plane was hit by antiaircraft fire and he deliberately crashed his plane into a concentration of enemy tanks, in a maneuver called a [...] "fire taran" [...] – a suicide attack by an aircraft on a <b>ground</b> <b>target.</b> Taranchiev was killed in the crash, as was his gunner, Alexey Tkachev. On 29 April 1944, he was posthumously awarded the Order of the Patriotic War 1st class. For his actions, he was posthumously awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union and the Order of Lenin on 5 May 1991.|$|E
