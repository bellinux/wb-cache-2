These simulations {{were used to}} evaluate both the effects from certain parameters on the wall heat transfer, and to examine how reduction of heat transfer would effect the engine performance and emission levels. In the first study, an initial investigation concerning the in- cylinder heat transfer was performed. This included a simple parameter study, performed to estimate the contribution of each parameter on the in-cylinder engine heat transfer. The parameter study revealed {{that most of the}} parameters selected do in-fact significantly affect the in-cylinder heat transfer. However, the effects on the indicated mean effective pressure, or indicated power output are different. Changing the amount of EGR and the swirl number did not show any dramatic effects on the indicated power output, while the injection duration showed much more dynamic effects on the indicated power output. In the second study, an investigation was made on the same heavy duty diesel engine, using both conventional <b>diesel</b> combustion <b>mode</b> and a partially premixed combustion (PPC) mode.

40|$|New {{premixed}} diesel combustion strategies, {{with their}} low engine-out PM and NOx emissions, are highly attractive for production implementation given increasingly strict emissions regulations. Accordingly, premixed diesel combustion strategies must operate effectively on commercially available diesel fuel, whose critical properties vary substantially. It is therefore critical {{to understand how}} premixed diesel combustion strategies respond to variations in fuel properties, especially cetane number the primary quantification of ignition behavior. This research study sought to understand the connection between diesel fuel properties, in particular cetane number, and the combustion and emissions behavior of premixed diesel combustion. Four primary test fuels with cetane numbers varying over the range expected in the field (42 - 53) were used, along with a secondary matrix of fuels to characterize {{the behavior of a}} nitrate cetane improver. Fuel effects were quantified across a range of EGR levels, injection pressures, and engine loads to identify secondary parameter interactions. Gaseous emissions, particularly NOx emissions, were found to be dependent solely on combustion phasing and EGR rate for the primary test fuels at the studied condition. Fuel cetane number shifts the combustion phasing (increasing cetane number advances phasing) but {{is only one of many}} different parameters which shift combustion. The effect of varying cetane number can be counteracted by varying injection timing to yield matched combustion phasing. The presence of 2 -ethylhexyl nitrate (2 -EHN) cetane improver within the fuel introduces a new fuel-borne NOx formation mechanism to the combustion process, which significantly increases NOx emissions in a premixed <b>diesel</b> combustion <b>mode.</b> The increase in NOx emissions stems from NOx formed by the decomposition of the 2 -EHN additive. The trends and magnitudes of soot, CO, and HC emissions remain constant for all tested fuels across a range of engine loads. The high load limit of the tested premixed <b>diesel</b> combustion <b>mode</b> is primarily limited by equivalence ratio, with excessive soot, CO, and HC emissions resulting as the overall equivalence ratio approaches stoichiometric.

40|$|Premixed diesel combustion, as a {{promising}} combustion concept to achieve low NOx and smoke emissions {{as well as}} high thermal efficiency, is paid much attention. Sufficiently long ignition delay is required for pre-mixture preparation to avoid over-rich mixture {{taking part in the}} combustion while the maximum pressure rise rate is suppressed to a tolerance level. Therefore, the operational load range of premixed diesel combustion with diesel fuel is limited at low and medium loads by the high pressure rise rate when increasing the fuelling rate per cycle. The results in recent researches indicate,by late injection strategy, with sufficiently low ignitability and high volatility fuel like gasoline, almost full operational load and speed ranges can be established in diesel engines with higher thermal efficiency and low emission levels. In this study, the influence of fuel properties including fuel ignitability, compositions and volatility on premixed diesel combustion is systematically investigated by experiments conducted on a single-cylinder, supercharged, four-stroke cycle, direct injection diesel engine with low pressure loop cooled EGR and common-rail fuel injection systems to obtain the optimal fuel properties for premixed diesel combustion. Secondly, the stable premixed diesel operational range of intake oxygen concentrations for various indicated mean effective pressures (IMEP) was constraints of knocking (maximum pressure rise rate lower than 1. 0 MPa/°CA), unstable combustion (the coefficient of variance (COV) in IMEP below 5 %) and the lower indicated thermal efficiency (higher than 40 %). Influence of ignitability on premixed diesel combustion is firstly discussed with four primary reference fuels (PRFs) with octane numbers from 0 to 60. With increasing octane number, the combustion phasing is retarded and higher intake oxygen concentration can be used resulting in higher indicated thermal efficiencies due to the higher combustion efficiency and the larger maximum IMEP of the premixed diesel combustion. Silent, low NOx, and smokeless operation with a high thermal efficiency is possible up to 1. 0 MPa IMEP using PRF with a research octane number of 40 when the intake oxygen concentration was optimized corresponding to IMEP. Next, influence of the fuel compositions on premixed diesel combustion is investigated with the difference between PRF and normal heptane and toluene blend fuel (NTF) with the same research octane number as the PRF. Compared with PRFs, the stable operational ranges and optimum intake oxygen concentrations of premixed diesel combustion with NTFs with the same research octane numbers shift to the higher intake oxygen concentration side, showing lower ignition characteristics than PRFs. Slightly higher maximum IMEP can be achieved with NTF with premixed diesel combustion, compared with PRF of the same research octane number. Influence of fuel volatility on operational range and combustion characteristics of premixed diesel combustion is investigated with normal heptane, PRF 20 and an ordinary diesel fuel. The results show the fuel volatility has little effect on the stable operational range and combustion characteristics of premixed diesel combustion. However, the best indicated thermal efficiency with the ordinary diesel fuel was lower than with PRF 20 at the optimum intake oxygen concentration in a wide IMEP range, mainly due to the higher unknown loss. The unknown loss defined here includes the cooling loss (main component), the losses from unburned fuel entering the crank case and also the oxidized fuel after the apparent heat release in the cylinder during the expansion and exhaust strokes {{as well as in the}} exhaust manifold before the exhaust gas sampling. The deterioration of indicated thermal efficiency with the ordinary diesel fuel here is mainly due to the increased quantity of fuel which doesn’t contribute to the effective combustion, as the high distillation components in diesel fuel adhere to the wall of the combustion chamber without evaporating. Influence of fuel volatility on the thermal efficiency of premixed diesel combustion is investigated with three ordinary diesel fuels with different distillation temperature distributions and PRF 20 as a high volatility fuel. With the premixed <b>diesel</b> combustion <b>mode,</b> regardless of injection timings, the indicated thermal efficiencies with the ordinary diesel fuels are lower than with PRF 20 due to the higher unknown losses. With the conventional <b>diesel</b> combustion <b>mode,</b> the indicated thermal efficiencies with the ordinary diesel fuels and PRF 20 are similar. These results suggest that the deterioration in the thermal efficiency in the premixed <b>diesel</b> combustion <b>mode</b> with the ordinary diesel fuel is mainly due to the adhesion of high distillation temperature components on the walls of the combustion chamber, and occurs mainly during the premixing period (between the end of fuel injection and the ignition); the larger amount of unburned fuel enters the crank case and the fuel oxidized after the apparent heat release in the cylinder do not contribute to the effective heat release...|$|R

40|$|Alternative fuels for Diesel engines include ester-based fuels (derived {{from sources}} such as rapeseed, {{soybeans}} and palm oil), dimethyl ether, and various synthetic fuels. Use of these fuels could contribute to a cleaner environment, reduce global warming and improve the human health by reducing levels of harmful emissions. One such fuel is Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) fuel, a synthetic fuel that can be produced from coal, natural gas or biomass, the properties of which heavily depend on the catalyst used in its production. Various published {{studies have shown that}} use of F-T fuels could reduce emissions of soot, NOx, HC and CO, to varying degrees, since they have a number of desirable properties, including low sulfur and aromatic contents, high cetane numbers and low density. To further explore the performance of F-T fuels, and the emissions generated when they are used, engine tests were performed at Chalmers in both HCCI and conventional <b>Diesel</b> combustion <b>modes.</b> The engine used in the investigations was a single cylinder, 0. 5 liter, research engine, and the performance of two F-T Diesel fuels derived from natural gas, produced by Statoil in Trondheim, was compared with that of two conventional Diesel fuels (Swedish low sulfur Diesel and European EN 590 Diesel). In HCCI combustion mode the soot emissions were too low for meaningful comparison between the fuels. However, HC and NOx emissions were lower when using the F-T fuels. There were no significant between-fuel differences in emissions of CO and CO 2, or fuel consumption. In HCCI combustion mode, the combustion was phased by using exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), thus there were no between-fuel differences in ignition delay, despite the early injection (which is a key feature of HCCI combustion). However, higher levels of EGR were needed for the F-T fuels than for the standard Diesel fuels, which reduced the thermal efficiency of the engine. In conventional <b>Diesel</b> combustion <b>mode</b> the soot emissions were markedly lower (by up to 30 percent) when using the F-T fuels than when using the already clean Swedish low-sulfur Diesel. Reductions were also found in HC and CO emissions, while CO 2 and fuel consumption values obtained with the different fuels were similar. The high cetane number of the F-T fuels resulted in shorter ignition delays for the pilot injections. A challenge that had to be met before widespread use of F-T fuels could be economically viable was to minimize their production costs. However, these costs have fallen sharply, through a combination of intense research efforts and the construction of F-T plants with high production capacities, and they are now competitive with oil from fossil sources, so long as the price of the latter is higher than $ 25 /barrel. The possibilities of producing Fischer-Tropsch fuels from several feed-stocks and using existing engines without modifications are major advantages with F-T fuels. Moreover, F-T fuels can be blended in any proportions with petroleum-based Diesel, and existing refueling and maintenance infrastructure can be used for vehicles running on them. All these advantages, and the cleanliness of their exhaust gases, make F-T fuels attractive alternative Diesel fuels...|$|R
