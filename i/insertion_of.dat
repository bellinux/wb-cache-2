5|$|Because of {{the change}} in {{designated}} values relative to the WHERE clause, from a logic perspective the law of excluded middle is a tautology for CHECK constraints, meaning CHECK (p OR NOT p) always succeeds.

5|$|Gerald Fischbach {{spent nine}} {{years at the}} Washington University School of Medicine, where he served as the Edison Professor of Neurobiology and Head of the Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology. During his time here, Fischbach {{continued}} {{his work on the}} ARIA protein. When ARIA isolated from chick embryo brain was applied to chicken myotubes, which are developing chicken muscle fibers, it was shown to increase the rate of <b>insertion</b> <b>of</b> acetylcholine receptors into chicken myotube membranes. This indicated ARIA could play a role in acetylcholine receptor insertion in neuromuscular junctions. Additionally, it was demonstrated that ARIA stimulated the transcription of α acetylcholine receptor subunits leading to an increase in α subunit messenger RNA (mRNA) and precursors, but had no effect on the mRNA levels of the γ or δ acetylcholine receptor subunits. This indicated that the amount α acetylcholine receptor subunit limits the synthesis and subsequent <b>insertion</b> <b>of</b> acetylcholine receptors into chicken myotube membranes.|$|E

5|$|Minor {{complications}} {{are common}} after laryngoscopy and <b>insertion</b> <b>of</b> an orotracheal tube.

Other complications which are common but potentially more serious include accelerated or irregular heartbeat, high blood pressure, elevated intracranial and introcular pressure, and bronchospasm.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} is usually made on electromyography (EMG), {{which is one}} of the standard tests in the investigation of otherwise unexplained muscle weakness.

5|$|The {{treatment}} of pneumothorax {{depends on a}} number of factors, and may vary from discharge with early follow-up to immediate needle decompression or <b>insertion</b> <b>of</b> a chest tube.

5|$|Controversy rapidly {{surrounded}} Edward's death. With Mortimer's {{execution in}} 1330, rumours began to circulate that Edward {{had been murdered}} at Berkeley Castle. Accounts {{that he had been}} killed by the <b>insertion</b> <b>of</b> a red-hot iron or poker into his anus slowly began to circulate, possibly as a result of deliberate propaganda; chroniclers in the mid-1330s and 1340s spread this account further, supported in later years by Geoffrey le Baker's colourful account of the killing. It became incorporated into most later histories of Edward, typically being linked to his possible homosexuality. Most historians now dismiss this account of Edward's death, querying the logic in Edward's captors murdering him in such an easily detectable fashion.|$|E

40|$|Transposons Tn 5 (Km) and Tn 7 (Tp and Sm) were {{transferred}} to Caulobacter crescentus via P-type antibiotic resistance factors. Transposition was demonstrated by the isolation <b>of</b> chromosomal <b>insertions</b> <b>of</b> each transposon. With C. crescentus strains harboring RP 4 aphA::Tn 7, {{the introduction of a}} wild-type RP 4 resulted in the loss of the resident plasmid. Simultaneous selection for Kmr and Smr yielded colonies with chromosomal <b>insertions</b> <b>of</b> Tn 7. Examination of over 10, 000 chromosomal <b>insertions</b> <b>of</b> Tn 7 indicated no auxotrophic or motility mutants. Thus, Tn 7 appears to have a high specificity <b>of</b> <b>insertion</b> in C. crescentus. The Mu-containing plasmid pJB 4 JI transferred Tn 5 to C. crescentus, but the plasmid was not maintained. Control experiments showed that recovery of Mu-containing plasmids occurred at very low frequencies in C. crescentus and that the plasmids which were recovered had undergone extensive deletion of plasmid DNA. Presumably, some part of the Mu genome was not tolerated by C. crescentus. The instability of the Mu-containing plasmids makes them excellent vectors for the introduction of transposons, and we have used pJB 4 JI to isolated chromosomal <b>insertions</b> <b>of</b> Tn 5. When several thousand <b>of</b> these <b>insertion</b> mutants were examined, we found auxotrophic and motility mutants at frequencies of 1 and 2 %, respectively. These results indicate that Tn 5 had a low specificity <b>of</b> <b>insertion</b> in C. crescentus and therefore would be a useful mutagen for obtaining a variety of mutant phenotypes...|$|R
5|$|Idiopathic {{intracranial}} hypertension {{is a condition}} of unknown cause characterised by a rise in CSF pressure. It is associated with headaches, double vision, difficulties seeing, and a swollen optic disc. It can occur {{in association with the}} use of Vitamin A and tetracycline antibiotics, or without any identifiable cause at all, particularly in younger obese women. Management may include ceasing any known causes, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor such as acetazolamide, repeated drainage via lumbar puncture, or the <b>insertion</b> <b>of</b> a shunt such as a ventriculoperitoneal shunt.|$|E
5|$|In a large PSP (>50%), or in a PSP {{associated}} with breathlessness, some guidelines recommend that reducing the size by aspiration is equally effective as the <b>insertion</b> <b>of</b> a chest tube. This involves {{the administration of}} local anesthetic and inserting a needle connected to a three-way tap; up to 2.5liters of air (in adults) are removed. If there has been significant reduction {{in the size of}} the pneumothorax on subsequent X-ray, the remainder of the treatment can be conservative. This approach has been shown to be effective in over 50% of cases. Compared to tube drainage, first-line aspiration in PSP reduces the number of people requiring hospital admission, without increasing the risk of complications.|$|E
