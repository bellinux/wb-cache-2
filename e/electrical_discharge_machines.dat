The actuator can be attached to conventional <b>electrical</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>machines</b> to realize a high-speed and high-accuracy EDM. The actuator primarily consists of thrust and radial magnetic bearings, thrust and radial air bearings and a magnetic coupling mechanism.

40|$|AbstractThe {{high-speed}} and medium-speed wire <b>electrical</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>machines</b> {{which are}} originally developed in China are playing {{an important role}} in mold making. However, the wire electrode wear is a universal problem in the machining process because the wire electrode is used repeatedly. Considering the relative motion between the wire electrode and the workpiece, the heat transfer model of wire electrode under moving heat source was established, and the temperature field of wire electrode was simulated in single pulse discharge by FEM. The results indicated that the size of the melted zone along the wire electrode axial direction increased remarkably while the depth size, the width size and the volume of the melted zone reduced apparently when the wire running speed increased. It can be concluded that the high relative speed between the wire electrode and the workpiece is beneficial to reduce the wire electrode wear in radial direction. Furthermore, when the wire running speed is higher than a certain value, the discharge column will slide over the wire electrode surface before the wire material reaches its melting point, thus the melting and ablation of the wire electrode material does not happen, which can almost realize no wire electrode wear...|$|E
40|$|In micro {{electrical}} discharge milling it {{is necessary}} to calibrate empirically tool wear compensation strategies in order to accurately adjust the tool-workpiece relative position and achieve high precision machining. The measurement of the material removed from both tool and workpiece is of paramount importance, since tool wear compensation and machining simulation rely on this information. On-machine volume measurements enable process parameters optimization based on self-learning procedures as well as the implementation of process monitoring algorithms. Commercially available <b>electrical</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>machines</b> allow the detection of electrical contacts between the tool and the workpiece electrodes by sensing low voltage short-circuits.

However, accurate and traceable measurements of volumes can be challenging and a metrological validation of the method is missing. In this work an investigation of the accuracy of the on-the-machine volume measurements in a micro electrical discharge milling setup is carried out.
