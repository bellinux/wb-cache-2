25|$|Joe Paterno {{expressed}} his displeasure with the officials {{for the second}} time this season as he yelled at referee David Witvoet after regulation. There were a number of odd and questionable actions by the officials during the game, as pointed out by the TV commentators, including the roughing the punter penalty and the referee refusing to ask for measurements when it appeared Michigan had been stopped short of first down. Each time <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> the sideline and signaled first down. It was most noticeable in the third quarter when he signaled first down even as Michigan was lining up in short-yardage formation, thinking it was third-and-1.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the evening}} of April 9, 1968, Raiford dropped off a couple of just-freed A {{students}} and was returning home when he violated the curfew. Raiford, now age 61, said <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> his watch, quietly exited his car, sensing something was not right. Raiford said he attempted to continue stealthily on foot, hoping the darkness of a neighborhood park would protect him.|$|E
2500|$|A {{legend of}} {{uncertain}} validity {{is that when}} relating bedtime stories (the earliest form of the Oz books) Baum was asked by his niece, Ramona Baxter Bowden, {{the name of the}} magical land. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> a nearby filing cabinet, which had three drawers, labeled A–G, H–N, and O–Z. Thus he named the land Oz. This story was first told in 1903, but his wife always insisted that the part about the filing cabinet was not true. [...] In Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz, the name is translated as [...] "great and good". It has also been speculated that Oz was named after the abbreviation for ounce, in the theory that Oz is an allegory for the populist struggle against the illusion (the wizard) of the gold standard.|$|E

6000|$|Campbell: [...] "Oh, it's all right, Mr. McIlheny. You've {{only got}} {{about half a}} minute." [...] <b>He</b> <b>glances</b> <b>at</b> the clock, and McIlheny runs out, profusely waving his hand in adieu.|$|R

2500|$|Pachman once {{deliberately}} let an hour run off his {{clock in}} order to use his own time trouble to lure his opponent into a swindle. In Pachman–Doda, Havana 1965, Pachman had earlier sacrificed an exchange for attacking chances. In the left-most position, Pachman had just played 27.Re1–e3?, to which his opponent responded with 27...Nd7–e5!. After that move, Pachman writes, [...] "I was suddenly aware that my position was in ruins. Black threatens to win a second exchange with 28...Ng4; since 28.fxe5 fxe5, threatening both 29...Rxf2 and 29...exd4, is hopeless for White, White must allow the knight to penetrate to d3, where it will threaten White's b and f pawns, leaving Black with a crushing position. Pachman considered resigning immediately, but saw an opportunity for a possible swindle. Since Black could easily sidestep the swindle, leaving him with a winning position, it was essential for Black to think that the move introducing the swindle was a time-trouble induced blunder. Pachman, who had over an hour for the next 13 moves, accordingly let his time go down to three minutes, [...] "the absolute minimum required in case my opponent should err." [...] Pachman then played 28.Qd2, Doda responded 28...Nd3, and Pachman played 29.Nd1 immediately, [...] "in my artificially created time trouble!" [...] Doda now could have kept a winning position with (for example) 29...Bg4. Instead, <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> Pachman's clock, thought no more than 30 seconds, and played 29...Nxf4?, falling into Pachman's swindle. Pachman played 30.Nf5!, initiating a strong attack (see right-most diagram). Pachman writes, [...] "The rest of the game followed at lightning speed, with my opponent in no way short of time but clearly depressed by the piece sacrifice." [...] The game concluded 30...gxf5 31.Rg3+ Kh8 32.Qxf4 Rb3? (better was 32...Qxe4 33.Qd2 f4 34.Rf3 and 35.Rxf4, with a strong attack) 33.Nc3 Rxb2 34.exf5 a5 35.Ne4 Re2 36.Nxf6 Rxf6? (after the better 36...Re5 37.Ng4 Rxf5 38.Nh6! Rf8 39.Rg5! wins) 37.Qg5 Re1+ 38.Kh2 1–0 ...|$|E
