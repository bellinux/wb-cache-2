40|$|Iron {{deficiency}} is {{a nutritional}} problem of world-wide medical concern (1). The preva-lence of anemias {{in this country}} is an embar-rassing reminder that iron fortification of var-ious foods (e. g., bread) might be improved with respect to the assimilability of the iron supplement (2). We have been interested in the solution chemistry and metabolism of iron, and have studied its interaction with complexing agents, which not only maintain the solubility of iron at physiological pH, but also may fa-cilitate the intestinal absorption of this metal. Fructose, because of its unusual complexing properties (3), appears to satisfy these cri-teria. The <b>ferric</b> <b>fructose</b> complex (4) is quite stable throughout a wide range of pH (5) and exists as a low molecular weight complex in equilibrium with high molecular weight ferric oxyhydroxide polymers (6). Past studies with <b>ferric</b> <b>fructose</b> have emphasized its effective absorption by man (7, 8, and M. Pollycove, personal communication), rabbits (9), rats (10, 11), and swine (J. Todd, personal com-munication). We wished to re-examine the efficacy of <b>ferric</b> <b>fructose</b> as a prophylactic and thera-peutic iron source and, in particular, to com-pare its utility with that of some well-recog-nized iron complexes and chelates. Among other reasons, we chose to study the guinea pig because, like man, it requires ascorbate. Our criterion for assessing the assimilation of an iron compound was retention of radioac-tive iron by measurement of whole-body ra-dioactivity; the method and rationale have been adequately treated elsewhere (12) ...|$|E
40|$|An {{endophytic}} bacterium, AL 2 - 16, {{was isolated}} from Achyranthes aspera L. It was characterized and identified as Serratia sp. AL 2 - 16 and was experimented {{for the presence}} of plant growth-promoting properties. AL 2 - 16 produced siderophore in iron-deficient conditions. The quantitative estimation of siderophore production unit of AL 2 - 16 was maximum after 48  hours of incubation (83. 488 %) in the presence of 1  μM of <b>ferric</b> chloride. The <b>fructose</b> followed by glucose and sucrose were proved to be the best carbon sources resulting in appreciable amount of siderophore production, i. e. 77. 223 %, 73. 584 %, and 65. 363 % respectively. AL 2 - 16 also has the ability to produce indole acetic acid in medium supplemented with l-tryptophan. The highest amount of indole acetic acid, in the presence of 1. 0 % l-tryptophan, was 123. 2  μg/mL after 144  hours. This isolate solubilized inorganic phosphate and also gave positive result for ammonia production. Colonization and pot trial experiments were conducted on A.  aspera L. plant. The population of AL 2 - 16 increased from 16. 2  ×  106 to 11. 2  ×  108  colony forming unit/g between 3 rd and 5 th days after inoculation. It significantly (p ≤  0. 05) increased shoot length by 95. 52 %, fresh shoot weight by 602. 38 %, fresh root weight by 438 %, and area of leaves by 127. 2 % when inoculated with AL 2 - 16, as compared with uninoculated control...|$|R
