Long-lived water molecules with correlation time tau(c) larger than 0. 3 ns were found close to the RNA adenine H 2 and H 1 ' protons in the hybrid segment. A possible long-lived water molecule was also detected close to the methyl group of 7 T in the RNA-DNA junction {{but not to the}} other two thymine bases (8 T and 9 T). This result correlates with the structural studies that only DNA residue 7 T in the RNA-DNA junction adopts an O 4 '-endo sugar conformation (intermediate between B-form and A-form), while the other DNA residues including 3 C in the DNA-RNA junction, adopt C 1 '-exo or C 2 '-endo conformations (in the B-form domain). Based on the NOE cross-peak patterns, we have found that RNA C 2 '-OH tends to orient toward the O 3 ' direction, forming a possible hydrogen bond with the 3 '-phosphate group. The exchange rates for RNA C 2 '-OH were found to be around 5 - 20 s(- 1), compared to 26. 7 (+/- 13. 8) s(- 1) reported previously for the other <b>DNA</b> <b>RNA</b> <b>hybrid</b> duplex.

Oligodeoxynucleotides complementary to nucleotides 2 - 14 of human U 1 small nuclear RNA were investigated. Extensive cleavage of U 1 RNA was observed with the unmodified oligodeoxynucleotide and with the phosphorothioate analogue but not with U 1 -complementary oligodeoxynucleotides containing methylphosphonate, phosphoro-N-morpholidate, or phosphoro-N-butylamidate internucleoside linkages. Additional experiments using a 514 -nucleotide-long RNA substrate demonstrated the capacity of complementary phosphodiester- and phosphorothioate-linked oligodeoxynucleotides (but not ones containing methylphosphonate, phosphoro-N-morpholidate, or phosphoro-N-butylamidate linkages) to serve as RNase H targets when hybridized to an internal RNA site. Detailed comparisons revealed phosphodiester-linked oligodeoxynucleotides to be more efficient than the comparable phosphorothioate-linked oligomers with respect to RNase H action. Various pentadecamer oligodeoxynucleotides complementary to the 514 -nucleotide-long test RNA and containing 2 - 6 consecutive phosphodiester- or phosphorothioate-linked nucleotides flanked by RNase H-resistant methylphosphonate linkages afforded precise "site-directed" RNase H excision within the <b>DNA.</b> <b>RNA</b> <b>hybrid.</b> These results serve to assort modified oligodeoxynucleotide-containing hybrids into RNase H-sensitive and -resistant classes and also provide clues as to how RNase H makes contact with the DNA strand in a <b>DNA.</b> <b>RNA</b> <b>hybrid...</b>|$|E

We have prepared complexes of purified RNA polymerase II halted at defined positions along a DNA template and used RNase footprinting to map interactions of the polymerase with the nascent RNA. Unexpectedly, the transcript is sensitive to cleavage by RNases A and T 1 at positions as close as 3 nucleotides from the 3 '-terminal growing point. Ternary complexes in which the transcript has been cleaved to give a short fragment can retain that fragment and remain active and able to continue elongation.

The nucleotides were treated by fitting the scalar coupling data and NOE time courses to a two-state model comprising N and S sugar puckers each with a different glycosidic torsion angle, and the mole fraction of the S state. Restraint sets for different distributions of N and S states within molecules were constructed, such that each nucleotide was weighted in the ensemble according to the mole fractions (or a prioriprobabilities). The individual nucleotide conformations were strongly restrained, whereas the internucleotide restraints were set relatively loosely. Ensembles of conformations were generated and assessed by comparison of the NOEs calculated from ensemble-averaged relaxation matrices with the experimental NOEs. The ensemble averages accounted for the experimental data much better than any individual member, or for structures calculated assuming a single unique conformation. The two hybrids populated different degrees of conformational space. There was a general trend in minor and major groove widths in the order d(GAAGAGAAGC). d(GCTTCTCTTC), d(GAAGAGAAGC). r(GCUUCUCUUC), r(GAAGAGAAGC). d(GCTTCTCTTC), r(GAAGAGAAGC). r(GCUUCUCUUC) and a similar progression in global character from B-like to A-like structures. Furthermore, r(GAAGAGAAGC). d(GCTTCTCTTC) showed a greater dispersion of conformations in the ensemble than d(GAAGAGAAGC). r(GCUUCUCUUC), reflecting the greater flexibility of the sugars. If conformational averaging of the nucleotides is ignored, incorrect virtual structures are produced that nevertheless are able to satisfy a substantial fraction of the experimental data...|$|R

The {{relative}} extent of hybrid formation is always greater for ribosomal <b>RNA.</b> These DNA-RNA <b>hybrids</b> have been further characterized by their stability to increasing temperature, and, in every case, the stability of pulse-labeled <b>RNA</b> <b>hybrids</b> was {{lower than that of}} the corresponding ribosomal <b>RNA</b> <b>hybrids,</b> although 16 S and 23 S ribosomal <b>RNA</b> <b>hybrids</b> had very similar stabilities. Therefore, ribosomal RNA showed a greater degree of apparent conservation in base sequence than pulse-labeled or messenger RNA both in the extent of cross-reaction and in the stability of hybrid structures. Similar results were obtained with Myxococcus xanthus RNA. Since in this case the base composition of the pulse-labeled or messenger RNA is richer in guanine plus cytosine than ribosomal RNA, the higher cross-reaction of ribosomal RNA is more readily attributable to conservation of base sequence in these cistrons than to its base composition. Thus, the base sequence of ribosomal RNA cistrons of bacilli, enteric bacteria, and myxobacteria is conserved relative to those {{of the rest of the}} genomes. This conservation is, however, not absolute since the stability of heterologous ribosomal <b>RNA</b> <b>hybrids</b> is always lower than that of homologous hybrids...|$|R

50|$|Helicases are a {{class of}} enzymes vital to all living organisms. Their main {{function}} is to unpackage an organism's genes. They are motor proteins that move directionally along a nucleic acid phosphodiester backbone, separating two annealed nucleic acid strands (i.e., <b>DNA,</b> <b>RNA,</b> or RNA-DNA <b>hybrid)</b> using energy derived from ATP hydrolysis. There are many helicases resulting from the great variety of processes in which strand separation must be catalyzed. Approximately 1% of eukaryotic genes code for helicases. The human genome codes for 95 non-redundant helicases: 64 RNA helicases and 31 DNA helicases. Many cellular processes, such as DNA replication, transcription, translation, recombination, DNA repair, and ribosome biogenesis involve the separation of nucleic acid strands that necessitates the use of helicases.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A simple, {{versatile}} {{method for}} {{the synthesis of}} Peptide Nucleic Acids (PNA) from readily available building blocks has been developed. The approach is based on submonomer solid phase synthesis and allows for the structural variation of both the backbone and the nucleobase idechain. The efficiency of the method was demonstrated by the synthesis of PNA oligomers in high purity and good yields. Peptide Nucleic Acids (PNA), oligonucleotide analogs with an achiral { oligo-N-(2 -aminoethylglycine) } backbone, {{have been shown to}} specifically recognize the complementary sequence of oligonucleotide oligomers. 1 Moreover, PNA/oligonucleotide hybrids are thermally more stable than the corresponding <b>DNA</b> (or <b>RNA)</b> <b>hybrids,</b> 2 and they should possess increased biological stability. 3 Therefore, PNA molecules have potential for the development of gene-targeting pharmaceuticals nd as antagonists for proteins that recognize DNA. 4 In this communication, we describe a simple and highly versatile method for the synthesis of PNA oligomers. Using a "submonomer " approach, 5 PNA molecules were synthesized on polystyrene r sin from inexpensive precursors like bromoacetic acid, a protected ethylenediamine (e. g., 4 -methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl (Moz) - ethylenediamine), and a nucleobase derivative (e. g., 1 -carboxymethyl-thymine; 6 Scheme 1). In contrast to the original approach for the synthesis of PNA oligomers, 1 the solution-phase ynthesis of N-protected...|$|R

The spectra of the duplexes below 235 nm were related to the polypurine strands present (poly-[r(A) ] or poly[d(A) ]). We interpret the CD intensity in the intermediate 255 - 235 nm region of these spectra to be mainly due to stacking of the constituent polypurine strands. Three of the five hybrids (poly[r(A) X d(U) ], poly[r(A) X d(T) ], and poly[d(T) X r(A) X d(T) ]) were found to have heteronomous conformations, while poly[r(U) X d(A) X r(U) ] was found to be the most A-like and poly[r(T) X d(A) X r(T) ], the least A-like...|$|R
