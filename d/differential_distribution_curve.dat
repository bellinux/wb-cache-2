These effects were analyzed using statistical analysis and cloud representation with marginal <b>distribution</b> <b>curves</b> for the contractility index and heart rate as to assess the effect relationship between cardiac variables. Arterial blood pressure, left ventricular pressure, electrocardiogram and body temperature were monitored. The application of data cloud with marginal <b>distribution</b> <b>curves</b> to heart rate and contractility index provided an interesting tactic during the interpretation of drug-induced changes particularly during selective time resolution (i. e. marginal <b>distribution</b> <b>curves</b> restricted to Tmax). Taken together, the present data suggests that marginal <b>distribution</b> <b>curves</b> can be a valuable interpretation strategy when using the rat cardiovascular telemetry model to detect drug-induced cardiovascular effects.

Morphologies and sizes of mesophase microbeads are characterized by scanning electronic microcopy (SEM), polarized light optical microphotography (PLOM) and laser particle size analyzer.

In homogeneous system, there are a great deal of smaller mesophase microbeads and a very little of larger mesophase microbeads. The laser particle size analysis results show that size distribution of mesophase microbeads in heterogeneous system is quite different from that in homogeneous system. There are multi-peaks on volume <b>distribution</b> <b>curve</b> in heterogeneous system.

The shape of the distributions hardly differ from those obtained for scalar Higgs (H) production because, apart from the overall coupling constant and mass, there are only small differences between the partonic <b>differential</b> <b>distributions</b> for scalar and pseudo-scalar production. Therefore, there are only differences in the magnitudes of the hadronic <b>differential</b> <b>distributions</b> which can be mainly attributed to the unknown mixing angle β describing the pseudo-scalar Higgs coupling to the top quarks...|$|R

The concentration of calcium was higher in the upper side and the concentration of potassium and phosphorus was higher in the lower side of the hypocotyls placed in horizontal position. This <b>differential</b> <b>distribution</b> was correlated with the curvature. The re{{distribution of}} ions is not connected to geotropic perception since 0. 5 hour horizontal orientation at 25 C and subsequent exposure at 4 C did not result in any redistribution. No <b>differential</b> <b>distribution</b> was observed in the hypocotyls placed in horizontal position when curvature was stopped by pre-treatment with NPA. After unilateral IAA application (0. 1 % W/W in lanolin) the concentration of calcium was higher in the concave side whereas the concentration of potassium and phosphorus was higher in the convex side. IAA probably affects the ion pumps via differential growth which results in redistribution of ions. In unilaterally illuminated coleoptiles illuminated (concave) side showed higher concentration of calcium, whereas shaded (convex) side showed higher concentration of potassium and phosphorus. NPA inhibited phototropic curvature as a result no <b>differential</b> <b>distribution</b> of ion was observed. Unilateral application of mersalyl (10 - 4 M in hydrated lanolin) resulted some movement of calcium away from the donor side and movement of potassium into the donor side. Mersalyl affects the distribution of ions by altering ion pumps and its mechanism of ion pump operation must be different from that of IAA as mersalyl does not produce a differential growth response and the IAA effect is dependent on differential growth. Hence, the results show a correlation between <b>differential</b> <b>distribution</b> of ions and curvature. It is concluded, therefore, that <b>differential</b> <b>distribution</b> is probably caused by curvature. <p...|$|R
