40|$|We {{construct}} an empirical model for daily <b>highs</b> <b>and</b> daily <b>lows</b> of US stock indexes {{based on the}} intuition that <b>highs</b> <b>and</b> <b>lows</b> do not drift apart over time. Our empirical results show that daily <b>highs</b> <b>and</b> <b>lows</b> of three main US stock price indexes are cointegrated. Data on openings, closings, and trading volume are found to offer incremental explanatory power for variations in <b>highs</b> <b>and</b> <b>lows</b> within the VECM framework. With all these variables, the augmented VECM models explain 40 – 50 % of variations in daily <b>highs</b> <b>and</b> <b>lows.</b> The generalized impulse response analysis shows that the responses of daily <b>highs</b> <b>and</b> daily <b>lows</b> to the shocks depend on whether data on openings, closings, and trading volume {{are included in the}} analysis.

40|$|Abstract. In earlier studies, the {{estimation}} of the volatility of a stock using information on the daily opening, closing, <b>high</b> <b>and</b> <b>low</b> prices has been developed; the additional information in the <b>high</b> <b>and</b> <b>low</b> prices can be incorporated to produce unbiased (or near-unbiased) estimators with substantially lower variance than the simple open-close estimator. This paper tackles the more difficult task of estimating the correlation of two stocks based on the daily opening, closing, <b>high</b> <b>and</b> <b>low</b> prices of each. If we could assume that we saw the <b>high</b> <b>and</b> <b>low</b> values of some linear {{combination of the two}} log prices, then we could use the univariate results via polarisation, but this is not data that is available. The actual problem is more challenging; we present an unbiased estimator which halves the variance. ...|$|R

If contemporary digital culture is having an effect upon cognitive functioning, learned behaviours and learning behaviours it is imperative that educational establishments adapt to the educational needs of the learners. Our study explored 2 groups of school-aged learners. One group was deemed to be a high digital immersion group and the other group a low digital immersion group.
