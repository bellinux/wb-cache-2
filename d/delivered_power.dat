25|$|The KPGC10's successor, the KPGC110, was {{released}} in 1973 after its introduction at the 1972 Tokyo motor show. Powered by a 1989cc I6 S20 engine, the second generation GT-R <b>delivered</b> <b>power</b> to the rear wheels through a 5-speed manual gearbox. This car also had both front and rear disk brakes. The suspension was a semi-trailing ring arm setup and minor aerodynamic parts were added.|$|E
25|$|The Benz Patent-Motorwagon and the Ford Model T used a {{trembler}} {{coil ignition}} system. A trembler coil was a battery-powered induction coil; the trembler interrupted the current through the coil and caused a quick series of sparks during each firing. The trembler coil would be energized at an appropriate {{point in the}} engine cycle. In the Model T, the four-cylinder engine had a trembler coil for each cylinder; a commutator (timer case) <b>delivered</b> <b>power</b> to the trembler coils. The Model T would be started on battery but then switched to an alternator.|$|E
25|$|The {{drive train}} <b>delivered</b> <b>power</b> to all four wheels using an {{electronically}} controlled all-wheel-drive system Nissan called the ATTESA E-TS. The ATTESA E-TS system used two accelerometers mounted under the center console, which fed lateral and longitudinal inputs to the ECU. The ECU then controlled power delivery {{to the front}} wheels via an electronic torque split converter. In 1995, the ATTESA E-TS Pro was introduced as an option for R33 GT-R customers, and came as standard equipment in GT-R V.spec models. It was later standard equipment in all GT-R models for the R34 Skyline GT-R. The ATTESA E-TS Pro added an Active Limited Slip Differential, which was controlled by the onboard ATTESA computer. This was only for the rear differential, as the front differential remained as a normal Limited Slip Differential. The ATTESA E-TS Pro was also advertised in brochures as adding an electronically controlled 4-channel ABS brake system. Although it {{is not related to}} the all wheel drive system, it uses much of the same sensors, and the same computer. The R32 could be switched from AWD to RWD by removing the 4WD fuse, but R33 and R34 models had to have the front tailshaft removed, or the centre diff can be depressurised for 'towing mode' as specified in the owners manual.|$|E

500|$|Distinguished {{for being}} the remake's [...] "most powerful" [...] {{original}} song, [...] "Evermore" [...] {{has been described as}} a [...] "big" [...] and [...] "romantic" [...] number by music critics. A [...] "soaring ballad" [...] bolstered by [...] "grand orchestration", WTOP's Jason Fraley described [...] "Evermore" [...] as a [...] "haunting song of longing"; a [...] "mournful love song" [...] that crescendos into a powerful lament about lost love. An emotionally <b>delivered</b> <b>power</b> ballad, the Belfast Telegraph agreed that the ballad is [...] "a soaring lament of longing". The accompaniment begins with the Beast's [...] "eerie" [...] theme before transitioning into a solo, first emerging from the film's [...] "Rose" [...] theme before taking on its central melody and instrumental bridge. Despite being a miserable [...] "lovesick ballad", the somber tone of which Chris Knight of the National Post likened to songs from the musical Les Misérables, the ballad is a more upbeat offering than its Broadway counterpart, [...] "If I Can't Love Her", [...] "captur the elaborate aesthetic of musical theatre". However, the track remains one of the more melancholy inclusions on a soundtrack that consists of largely upbeat songs and musical numbers, contributing a sense of emotional depth to the album. Writing for Elle, Alyssa Bailey dubbed the song a [...] "Broadway version of a breakup ballad", which features the lyrics [...] "I let her steal into my melancholy heart/It's more than I can bear," [...] as [...] "swoon" [...] by Stevens. Musically, the track bares similarities to songs from Disney's animated film The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996), which Menken himself also composed, as well as the work of musical theatre composer Andrew Lloyd Webber.|$|E
2500|$|The use of CCS {{can reduce}} [...] {{emissions}} from {{the stacks of}} coal power plants by 85–90% or more, but it {{has no effect on}} [...] emissions due to the mining and transport of coal. It will actually [...] "increase such emissions and of air pollutants per unit of net <b>delivered</b> <b>power</b> and will increase all ecological, land-use, air-pollution, and water-pollution impacts from coal mining, transport, and processing, because the CCS system requires 25% more energy, thus 25% more coal combustion, than does a system without CCS".|$|E
2500|$|CNG is {{a cleaner}} and also cheaper {{alternative}} to other automobile fuels such as gasoline (petrol) and diesel. By {{the end of}} 2012 there were 17.25 million natural gas vehicless worldwide, led by Iran (3.3 million), Pakistan (3.1 million), Argentina (2.18 million), Brazil (1.73 million), India (1.5 million), and China (1.5 million). The energy efficiency is generally {{equal to that of}} gasoline engines, but lower compared with modern diesel engines. Gasoline/petrol vehicles converted to run on natural gas suffer because of the low compression ratio of their engines, resulting in a cropping of <b>delivered</b> <b>power</b> while running on natural gas (10%–15%). [...] CNG-specific engines, however, use a higher compression ratio due to this fuel's higher octane number of 120–130.|$|E

2500|$|All {{three were}} uni-body cars, dubbed the [...] "Y-body" [...] platform, {{combining}} {{the frame and}} body into a single construction, making them comparatively lighter and smaller. All three put into production new technology pushed by John DeLorean which GM {{had been working on}} for several years prior, but the Tempest was by far the most radical. A flexible steel shaft rotating at the speed of the engine <b>delivered</b> <b>power</b> from the front-mounted engine through a [...] "torque tube" [...] to a rear-mounted trans-axle. This innovation not only delivered close to a 50/50 front-rear weight distribution that drastically improved handling, it enabled four-wheel independent suspension which enhanced it even more. It also all but eliminated the large floor [...] "hump" [...] common to front-engined rear-drive cars.|$|E
2500|$|NIF is {{designed}} primarily {{to use the}} indirect drive method of operation, in which the laser heats a small metal cylinder instead of the capsule inside it. The heat causes the cylinder, known as a hohlraum (German for [...] "hollow room", or cavity), to re-emit the energy as intense X-rays, which are more evenly distributed and symmetrical than the original laser beams. Experimental systems, including the OMEGA and Nova lasers, validated this approach through the late 1980s. In {{the case of the}} NIF, the large <b>delivered</b> <b>power</b> allows for the use of a much larger target; the baseline pellet design is about 2mm in diameter, chilled to about 18 kelvins (−255°C) and lined with a layer of frozen deuterium-tritium (DT) fuel. The hollow interior also contains a small amount of DT gas.|$|E
