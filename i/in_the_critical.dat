5|$|Despite the {{modernity and}} {{the merit of}} the works {{produced}} {{and the ability of}} its protagonists, the historiography of Renaissance sculpture in Brescia was never able to win the honors of artistic and literary culture, neither at the time, nor in the following centuries, being forgotten even by the local sources. The main cause {{is to be found in}} a long series of errors and omissions that occurred <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>critical</b> literature from the earliest days until the twentieth century, which led to the misunderstanding of the cultural level and quality achieved by the Brescia school during the thirty years from the turn of the fifteenth century, and the oblivion of its main characters.|$|E
5|$|Given the inaccessibility {{of much of}} the species' range, {{particularly}} the central Amazon, estimating jaguar numbers is difficult. Researchers typically focus on particular bioregions, thus species-wide analysis is scant. In 1991, 600–1,000 (the highest total) were estimated to be living in Belize. A year earlier, 125–180 jaguars were estimated to be living in Mexico's 4,000-km2 (2400-mi2) Calakmul Biosphere Reserve, with another 350 in the state of Chiapas. The adjoining Maya Biosphere Reserve in Guatemala, with an area measuring 15,000km2 (9,000mi2), may have 465–550 animals. Work employing GPS telemetry in 2003 and 2004 found densities of only six to seven jaguars per 100km2 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>critical</b> Pantanal region, compared with 10 to 11 using traditional methods; this suggests the widely used sampling methods may inflate the actual numbers of cats.|$|E

5|$|In the A-not-B task, {{children}} are shown an object hidden at Location A within their reach, and are then prompted {{to search for}} the object at Location A, where they find it. This activity is repeated several times, with the hidden object at Location A.

Typically, children younger than one year old search for the object under Location A, where the object was previously hidden. However, after their first birthday, {{children are}} capable of mentally switching to locate the object in Location B, demonstrating flexibility. Researchers have agreed that the A-not-B task is a simple task that effectively measures cognitive flexibility during infancy.|$|E

While MDRM won decisive victories in the central and eastern province, results were close in the western province, where the MDRM candidate Joseph Raseta won 21,475 votes and the PADESM candidate Totelehibe won 19,014 votes.|$|E
5|$|Bale reprised {{his role}} as Wayne / Batman {{in the second part}} of Nolan's Batman film series, the sequel of 2005's Batman Begins {{entitled}} The Dark Knight (2008). After its release, the film received highly positive reviews and is considered one of the best films of the 2000s. With more than $1 billion in revenue worldwide, it is the thirteenth highest-grossing film of all time. A year later, he starred in the fourth installment of the Terminator film series, Terminator Salvation (2009) as John Connor. The film was poorly received by most movie critics, however, it was a commercial success. The same year, Bale starred together with Johnny Depp <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>critical</b> and commercial success Public Enemies as FBI agent Melvin Purvis. He acted alongside Mark Wahlberg in the biographical sports drama The Fighter (2010) as Dicky Eklund. The film was critically acclaimed and a commercial success. The Fighter earned Bale the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor at the 83rd Academy Awards. In 2012, Bale starred in the third and final installment of Nolan's Batman film trilogy entitled The Dark Knight Rises as Wayne / Batman. As with its prequels, the film received positive acclaim from movie critics. The Dark Knight Rises has earned more than $1 billion worldwide thus becoming the seventh highest-grossing film worldwide and the third highest-grossing film of 2012. For {{his role as}} Michael Burry in the biographical dramedy The Big Short, he was nominated for an Academy Award and BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actor.|$|E

5|$|Charles Darwin {{was aware}} of the severe {{reaction}} {{in some parts of the}} scientific community against the suggestion made in Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation that humans had arisen from animals by a process of transmutation. Therefore, he almost completely ignored the topic of human evolution in On the Origin of Species. Despite this precaution, the issue featured prominently in the debate that followed the book's publication. For most of the first half of the 19th century, the scientific community believed that, although geology had shown that the Earth and life were very old, human beings had appeared suddenly just a few thousand years before the present. However, a series of archaeological discoveries in the 1840s and 1850s showed stone tools associated with the remains of extinct animals. By the early 1860s, as summarized in Charles Lyell's 1863 book Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man, it had become widely accepted that humans had existed during a prehistoric period—which stretched many thousands of years before the start of written history. This view of human history was more compatible with an evolutionary origin for humanity than was the older view. On the other hand, at that time there was no fossil evidence to demonstrate human evolution. The only human fossils found before the discovery of Java Man in the 1890s were either of anatomically modern humans or of Neanderthals that were too close, especially <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>critical</b> characteristic of cranial capacity, to modern humans for them to be convincing intermediates between humans and other primates.|$|E
