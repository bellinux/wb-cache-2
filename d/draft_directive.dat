On 15 June, he joined fellow chiefs of staff Lieutenant General Henry Wells and Air Marshal John McCauley, Prime Minister Robert Menzies, and senior government members in approving a <b>draft</b> <b>directive</b> {{for the role of}} the Far East Strategic Reserve (FESR); this made Commonwealth forces available for the fight against communist insurgents in Malaya, {{as well as for the}} security of Malaya and Singapore against external aggression. The Navy's contribution to the FESR was to be at least two destroyers or frigates on an ongoing basis, as well as a yearly visit by an aircraft carrier. The destroyers [...] and , already in the region on an exercise, were immediately committed, and Dowling flew to Singapore to personally announce the plan and the reasons for it to the ships' crews.|$|E

2500|$|Named after Frits Bolkestein, the Directive on {{services}} in the internal market aims at enabling a company from a given member-state to recruit workers in other European Union countries using the law of its home country. It triggered huge protests in Europe. This directive was voted in the European Parliament in March 2006 and the MEPs proposed amendments to the provisional text. The [...] "principle of origin", which stipulates that workers are employed under the legal arrangements of their own state of residence, {{was replaced by a}} new [...] "freedom" [...] principle – freedom to provide services, meaning that administrative obstacles should be removed. The compromise allowed the <b>draft</b> <b>Directive</b> to continue to exist. However, {{there was a great deal}} of concern about its effect on social standards and welfare, triggering competition between various parts of Europe. This led to significant protests across Europe against the directive including a notable protest at the European Parliament in Strasbourg by port workers which led to damage to the building. MEPs eventually reached a compromise on the text and the Parliament adopted it on 12 December 2006; 2 years after Bolkestein left office, under the Barroso Commission.|$|E
2500|$|The Bill is modelled, {{more or less}} directly, on the {{proposals}} put forward by the European Commission for a draft Temporary and Agency Worker Directive (...) [...] This proposal was itself shelved, because of the UK government's consistent opposition to agency regulation, {{in the interests of}} labour market flexibility. According to newspaper reports, the UK got the backing of Germany to torpedo the <b>draft</b> <b>Directive</b> in return for the UK to help sink the Takeover Directive (Germany has comprehensive agency work regulation under its [...] and its Civil Code, esp §622, and the UK has strong Takeover Regulation, especially Rule 21 of the City Code). The significant difference between the proposed Directive and the Bill is that the former UK government managed to insert a 6 week qualification period in the Directive before the equal treatment rights click in (Art. 5(4)). The Bill has no proposed qualification period, though voices in the City have been calling for this to be one year. The latest reports suggest a 12 week qualifying period has been agreed between the private MP backers and the government, meaning a significant step back from the protection the Directive would offer. The Directive included equal treatment only for pay, hours, parental rights and anti-discrimination (Art. 3(1)(d)). A significant omission therefore was any regulation on reasonable notice before dismissal (in the UK, ERA s.86).|$|E

5000|$|The European Information and Communication Technology Association (EICTA) {{stated that}} the {{directive}} [...] "is extremely important {{for the future of}} innovation in Europe as it concerns two-thirds of all inventions in the European hi-tech industry".

After the heavily modified <b>draft</b> <b>directive</b> was finally rejected, EICTA's Director General said, [...] "This is a wise decision that has helped industry to avoid legislation that could have narrowed the scope of patent legislation in Europe. ...

5000|$|The {{proposal}} provoked public disagreement by diverse {{opponents of}} software patents, {{who argued that}} software patents were neither economically desirable nor mandated by international law. The FFII and the EuroLinux Alliance played key roles in co-ordinating this campaign, which drew support from some free software and open source programmers, some academics, some small business groups, and some proprietary software developers. Many of these organisations expressed concern over {{what they saw as}} abuses of the software patent system in the USA, and argued that although some software patents might be beneficial, the net effect of the Commission's proposals would be to suppress innovation and dampen legitimate competition. The opponent's campaign in its turn was characterised by supporters of the directive as [...] "a small but highly organised and vocal lobby", with EICTA stating that [...] "Those who depict the <b>draft</b> <b>directive</b> on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions as some sort of 'software patent law' are at best misinformed and at worst dishonest, malicious and disrespectful of the European democratic process".|$|E
