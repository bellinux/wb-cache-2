While walking around the property, Tim finds a gun and a bone in the backyard. At first he wants to dig up the {{surrounding}} ground to see if a body is buried there, but Lee convinces him it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>idea.</b>|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{admits that}} there may be death metal {{influences}} in the vocals, but says {{that it was not a}} conscious design, and that the music does not have any other similarities to death metal. He claims that there are no black metal influences. He says that describing Celestiial's music as folk <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>idea,</b> as folk is such a broad, vague description as to make it meaningless. He says that what he is creating is neither folk, nor traditional, and even the harp songs are not traditional works, though they are influenced by the traditional music of the United Kingdom and traditional Irish music.|$|E
5|$|On {{the weekend}} of Jack Donaghy's (Alec Baldwin) 51st birthday, his {{advances}} with CNBC host Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) are called into question when he learns that his high school sweetheart, Nancy Donovan (Julianne Moore), has finally been divorced from her husband. Jack spends evenings having dinner and wine with both, against Liz Lemon's (Tina Fey) suggestion that it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>idea.</b> He compares Nancy to actor Lee Marvin, after watching a movie marathon starring Marvin, and Avery to baseball player Derek Jeter, after he spends time with Avery at Jeter's home. He is moved by the thoughtful birthday gifts both women give him. Jack is torn between the easygoing, middle-class Nancy and his successful, wealthy counterpart Avery, and does not know whom to choose.|$|E

5|$|When {{the rest}} of the office is told of Phyllis' injury, they take this as {{confirmation}} that the Cafe Disco <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>idea</b> and reprimand Michael for what happened to Phyllis. Disappointed and angry, Michael instructs Erin (Ellie Kemper) to close up the Cafe Disco. Kelly (Mindy Kaling) comes down with her and the two start dancing after Erin turns on the stereo. This catches the eye of two male employees from Vance Refrigeration, and soon Cafe Disco is full of both Dunder Mifflin employees and non-employees, much to Michael's delight. Oscar (Oscar Nunez) is mildly baffled that Erin actually invited one of her friends to come, as opposed to being ashamed of the office. Kelly and Andy (Ed Helms) get into a competitive dance-off with each other, and Kevin (Brian Baumgartner) makes out in the corner with his girlfriend Lynne (Lisa K. Wyatt).|$|E
5|$|Amy {{discovers that}} Kyle's adoptive parents have died. She and Victoria attend the funeral {{to see if}} Kyle is there and see him at the wake with his adoptive grandmother, Joanie Wright (Denise Black). When Kyle drops his toy, Amy {{picks it up and}} tries to give it back but Joanie doesn't hear her so she keeps it. Amy returns the next day and a barmaid gives her Joanie's address. Amy plans to return the toy but changes her mind and leaves. Needing to see Kyle, she persuades Andy to let her take baby Jack to Kyle's playgroup and makes friends with Joanie, telling her that she is {{studying}} childcare and asking if she needs any help with Kyle. Joanie accepts and allows Amy to look after Kyle occasionally. Val is thrilled when she finds out but Victoria and Eric think it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>idea</b> and Eric tells Joanie that Amy is Kyle's birth mother. Disgusted, Joanie refuses to let Amy see Kyle again but is eventually persuaded to change her mind. Sadly, while Amy and Kyle are on a picnic together, Kyle almost drowns and Joanie blames Amy. She promptly bans her from seeing Kyle and refuses to even consider changing her mind, even calling the police when Amy visits repeatedly, who warn her to stay away. Desperate to see her son, Amy and Andy (who she is now dating) call Social Services to see if she can get custody but the social worker tells her that being awarded custody is very unlikely. Feeling now that the adoption was a mistake, Amy decides to snatch Kyle and go on the run. Kerry, understanding how Amy feels, tries to talk her out of it but when she can't, decides to help her. They go to Kyle's playgroup and kidnap him and Kerry drives them to the docks. During the drive, Val phones repeatedly but they don't answer. Eventually Kerry answers and Amy tearfully reveals her plans before throwing the phone away. Eric checks the computer's internet history and finds out where Amy is going. Cain, Andy, Val, Eric and Joanie all rush to the docks. In the end, Cain persuades Amy to return Kyle, warning her of the complications of the life on the run and how Kyle might be affected. She says goodbye to Kyle and gives him to Cain but fearing she'll be sent to prison, Amy leaves, devastating Val. Val later gets a call from Amy and learns that she is living in Ireland with her aunt.|$|E
25|$|The {{case has}} even {{involved}} both Manohara biological father and stepfather when Daisy informed Indonesian media that Pinot is in Jakarta to {{lend support to}} Manohara over recent reports that Manz had sided with Tengku Temenggong Muhammad Fakhry, 32, who is Manohara's husband. Pinot also planned to take Manohara to Europe to further her education in arts and economics. Manohara's biological father George Manz believed that it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>idea</b> as Pinot is convicted for sexual haressment and is threatening to get the US State Department involved because 17-year-old Manohara is a US citizen.|$|E

25|$|A {{ball that}} bounces {{a little way}} before the good length and rises to the batsman's abdomen {{is said to be}} short pitched or {{described}} as a long hop and is easier for a batsman to hit as he will have had more time to see if the height or line of the ball has deviated after bouncing. A short-pitched ball is also at a more suitable height for the batsman to play an attacking pull shot. A ball that bounces significantly before the good length and reaches shoulder or head height is a bouncer and can be an effective delivery. Any ball short enough to bounce over the batsman's head is usually called wide by the Umpire. Bowling short pitched or wide balls <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>idea</b> as they are relatively easy for the batsman to defend or attack.|$|E

Soon afterwards, Max returns {{to pick up her}} purse and finds Tim digging again. She joins him and discovers a plastic bag filled with bones. Meanwhile, Lee goes to visit her sister Squiggy (Melanie Lynskey) and brother-in-law Bob (Ron Livingston) for an afternoon after complaining to her mother that she no longer feels she has an identity outside of being a mother and wife.|$|E
500|$|In space suits, Sheppard and Zelenka {{reach the}} {{controls}} and repair them, {{but in the}} process Zelenka is injured by a micro-asteroid. By then, Atlantis has lost too much power to jump again. Furthermore, Sheppard learns McKay has disobeyed his order and angrily tells him to deactivate the nanites. Weir, having apparently fully recovered, regains consciousness. When she learns the nanites are keeping her alive, she warns Teyla (Rachel Luttrell) that saving her this way <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>idea.</b> McKay apologises to Sheppard, and they continue working. In the end, McKay decides to use an experimental Jumper with a hyperdrive he worked on since [...] "Tao of Rodney" [...] and use it to steal a Zero Point Module from the Asuran homeworld.|$|E

500|$|Some reviewers have {{suggested}} that Heinlein was simply discussing the merits of a selective versus a nonselective franchise. Heinlein made a similar claim, over two decades after Starship Trooperss publication, in his Expanded Universe and further claimed that 95 percent of [...] "veterans" [...] were not military personnel but members of the civil service. Heinlein's own description has been disputed, even among the book's defenders. Heinlein scholar James Gifford has argued {{that a number of}} quotes within the novel suggest that the characters within the book assume that the Federal Service is largely military. For instance, when Rico tells his father that he is interested in Federal Service, his father immediately explains his belief that Federal Service <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>idea</b> because there is no war in progress, indicating that he sees Federal Service as military in nature. Gifford states that although Heinlein's intentions may have been that Federal Service be 95 percent non-military, in relation to the actual contents of the book, Heinlein [...] "is wrong on this point. Flatly so." ...|$|E

Some critics suggested that Clarkson's appearance would turn a somber occasion of national mourning into a [...] "giant promotional opportunity". [...] Kelly Clarkson herself considered withdrawing from the commemoration, saying [...] "I think it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>idea</b> ...
