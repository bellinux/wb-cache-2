OBJECTIVE: In this study, we examined associations between personal use of permanent and temporary <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> and bladder cancer risk in a population-based case-control study involving 1, 385 cases (n = 246 women) and 4, 754 controls (n = 2, 587 women).

This study aims {{to evaluate the}} relationship between women’s personal <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> use {{and the risk of}} B-cell NHL. Methods: A 1 : 1 matched population-based case-control study of women conducted in Los Angeles County recruited 986 case-control pairs. Case participants were diagnosed with histologic confirmed primary B-cell NHL between 2004 and 2008. Control participants were individually matched to the index cases by age, gender, race, and neighborhood of residence. Exposure information was obtained by in-person interviews. Multivariable conditional logistic regression was performed to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) of B-cell NHL associated with personal <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> use overall, by race, and by NHL subtypes, adjusting for potential confounders (alcohol status, smoking status, and education levels).; Results: Compared to women who had never used any <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> products, those who had ever used personal <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> had a 38 % greater risk for B-cell NHL (OR= 1. 38, 95 %CI= 1. 05 - 1. 31). A younger age at first <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> use, a longer duration of <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> use, and a greater number of <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> applications were all associated with an elevated risk of B-cell NHL (p-values for trend= 0. 007, 0. 006, 0. 025, respectively).

30|$|One {{application}} for laccase is hair coloring. Oxidation-based hair color, which {{has dominated the}} hair color market, consists of dye intermediates and an oxidizing agent (Saito et al., 2012). In a typical hair color product, the dye intermediates are p-diamines and p-aminophenols, and hydrogen peroxide is used as the oxidant in the dyeing process.

However, side reactions with hair proteins commonly occur simultaneously because of the severe reactions conditions, resulting in hair damage (Saito et al., 2012). The commercial hydrogen peroxide oxidative-type <b>hair</b> <b>dyeing</b> formulations are mutagenic. Some <b>hair</b> <b>dyeing</b> components become strongly mutagenic after oxidation by hydrogen peroxide (Ames et al., 1975).

Eighteen professional hairdressers (3 /day) coloured hairdresser's training heads bearing natural human hair (hair length: approximately 30 cm) for 6 h/working day with a dark-shade oxidative hair dye containing 2 % [14 C]-para-phenylenediamine (PPD). Three separate phases of <b>hair</b> <b>dyeing</b> were monitored: (A) dye preparation/hair dyeing, (B) rinsing/shampooing/conditioning and (C) cutting/drying/styling. Ambient air and personal monitoring samples (vapours and particles), nasal and hand rinses were collected during all study phases. Urine (pre-exposure, quantitative samples for the 0 - 12, 12 - 24, 24 - 48 h periods after start of exposure) and blood samples (blank, 4, 8 or 24 h) were collected from all exposed subjects. Radioactivity was determined in all biological samples and study materials, tools and washing liquids, and a [14 C]-mass balance was performed daily. No adverse events were noted during the study. Waste, equipment, gloves and coveralls contained 0. 41 ± 0. 16 %, dye mixing bowls 2. 88 ± 0. 54 %, hair wash 45. 47 ± 2. 95 %, hair + scalp 53. 46 ± 4. 06 % of the applied radioactivity, respectively. Plasma levels were below the limit of quantification (≤ 10 ng PPDeq/mL). Total urinary 0 - 48 h excretion of [14 C] levels ranged from a total of < 2 - 18 μg PPDeq and was similar in subjects exposed during the different phases of <b>hair</b> <b>dyeing.</b> Minimal air levels at or slightly above the limit of quantification were found in a few personal air monitoring samples during the phases of <b>hair</b> <b>dyeing</b> and hair cutting, but not during the rinsing phase. Air area monitoring samples or nasal rinses contained no measurable radioactivity. Hand residues ranged from 0. 006 to 0. 15 μg PPDeq/cm 2, and were found predominantly after the cutting/drying phase. The mean mass balance of [14 C] across the six study days was 102. 50 ± 2. 20 %. Overall, the mean, total systemic exposure of hairdressers to oxidative hair dyes during a working day including 6 <b>hair</b> <b>dyeing</b> processes {{was estimated to be}} < 0. 36 μg PPDeq/kg body weight/working day.

40|$|<b>Hair</b> <b>dyes</b> {{have been}} {{evaluated}} as possibly being mutagenic and carcinogenic in animals. Studies of the association between human cancer risk and use of <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> have yielded inconsistent results. The authors evaluated the risk of lymphoid malignancies associated with personal use of <b>hair</b> <b>dyes.</b> The analysis included 2, 302 incident cases of lymphoid neoplasms and 2, 417 hospital- or population-based controls from the Czec...|$|R
40|$|In recent reports, {{multiple}} myeloma {{has been linked}} to use of hair coloring products containing mutagenic and carcinogenic chemicals. A population-based case-control study in Iowa of 173 White men with {{multiple myeloma}} and 650 controls obtained information on <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> use. Risk of multiple myeloma was significantly elevated (OR = 1. 9) among <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> users and was greatest among those using <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> {{at least once a month}} for a year or more (OR = 4. 3). These data, along with results from other studies, suggest that use of <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> contributes to the development of multiple myeloma...|$|R
