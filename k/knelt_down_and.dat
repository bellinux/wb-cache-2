25|$|In chapter 68, {{in another}} battle after Xiaoyao Ford, when Ling Tong was duelling with Yue Jin, Cao Xiu fired an arrow which hit Ling's horse, causing Ling {{to be thrown}} to the ground. Just as Yue Jin was moving in for the kill, he was {{suddenly}} hit by an arrow in the face. Both sides immediately rushed forth to rescue their respective generals and withdrew their forces after that. Later, Ling Tong was surprised to hear from Sun Quan that it was Gan Ning who saved him, and he <b>knelt</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> thanked the latter. Since then, Ling Tong forgot his past feud with Gan Ning and they became close friends.|$|E
25|$|Inside Fort Caroline, La Vigne {{was keeping}} watch with his company, but taking pity on his sentinels, wet and {{fatigued}} {{with the heavy}} rain, he let them leave their stations with the approach of day, and finally he himself retired to his own quarters. With the break of day on September 20, the feast of St. Matthew, Menéndez was already alert. Before dawn he held a consultation with his captains, after which the entire party <b>knelt</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> prayed for a victory over their enemies. Then he {{set out for the}} fort over the narrow path which led to it from the woods. A French prisoner, Jean Francois, led the way, his hands bound behind him, {{and the end of the}} rope held by Menéndez himself.|$|E
25|$|Countess Sztáray {{noticed a}} small brown stain above the empress's left breast. Alarmed that Elisabeth had not {{recovered}} consciousness, she informed {{the captain of}} her identity, and the boat turned back to Geneva. Elisabeth was carried back to the Hotel Beau-Rivage by six sailors on a stretcher improvised from a sail, cushions and two oars. Fanny Mayer, {{the wife of the}} hotel director, a visiting nurse, and the countess undressed Elisabeth and removed her shoes, when Sztáray noticed a few small drops of blood and a small wound. When they then removed her from the stretcher to the bed she was clearly dead; Frau Mayer believed the two audible breaths she heard the Empress take as she was brought into the room were her last. Two doctors, Dr. Golay and Dr. Mayer arrived, along with a priest, who was too late to grant her absolution. Mayer incised the artery of her left arm to ascertain death, and found no blood. She was pronounced dead at 2:10p.m. Everyone <b>knelt</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> prayed for the repose of her soul, and Countess Sztáray closed Elisabeth's eyes and joined her hands. No matter how reluctant or resentful she was of the title, Elisabeth had been the Empress of Austria for 44 years.|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} home {{belonged to}} a mother of seven. There were no tables or cutlery in the house, and the toilet operated without plumbing. Roaches and rats ran across the floor. Kennedy's attention was drawn to a 20 month-old boy who was playing with rice grains on the floor. The child was covered in sores and bloated from hunger. Kennedy <b>knelt</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> stroked his cheek. He said, [...] "My God, I didn't know {{this kind of thing}} existed. How can a country like this allow it? Maybe they just don't know." [...] Clark labeled what lay before them a [...] "national disgrace." [...] Kennedy caressed the child and talked to him, but elicited no response. The senator began to cry.|$|E
2500|$|M.B. Synge {{wrote this}} about the Company of Death: [...] "Nine hundred desperate patriots forming the Company of Death defended the sacred car. Seeing the Germans were gaining ground, fearful {{for the safety of}} their treasure, they {{suddenly}} <b>knelt</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> renewed their vow to God that they would perish for their country".|$|E
2500|$|Klebold {{walked toward}} {{another set of}} tables, where he {{discovered}} 18-year-old Isaiah Shoels, 16-year-old Matthew Kechter and 16-year-old Craig Scott (the younger brother of Rachel Scott), hiding under one table. All three were popular athletes. Klebold tried to pull Shoels {{out from under the}} table. He called to Harris, referring to him by his online identity and shouting, [...] "REB! There's a nigger over here!" [...] Harris left Pasquale and joined him. According to witnesses, Klebold and Harris taunted Shoels for a few seconds, making derogatory racial comments. Harris <b>knelt</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> shot Shoels once in the chest at close range, killing him instantly. Klebold also <b>knelt</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> opened fire, hitting and killing Kechter. Harris then yelled; [...] "Who's ready to die next?". Meanwhile, Scott was uninjured; he lay in the blood of his friends, feigning death. Harris turned and threw a CO2 bomb at the table where Hall, Steepleton, and Ireland were located. It landed on Steepleton's thigh, and Hall quickly threw it away.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the four}} panels {{on the right}} hand side are scenes from the Passion. In the first top right panel we see Jesus agonising {{in the garden of}} Gethsemane with the disciples asleep. Jesus had <b>knelt</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> prayed this prayer- [...] " [...] Father, if it be thy will, take this cup away from me; yet not my will but thine be done.” [...] And now there {{appeared}} to him an angel from heaven bringing him strength and in anguish of spirit he prayed the more urgently; and his sweat was like drops of blood falling to the ground. When he rose from prayer and came to the disciples he found them asleep, worn out by grief." [...] St Luke 22.42-46.|$|E
2500|$|When Lu Ji was {{six years}} old, his father brought him to Jiujiang Commandery (九江郡) to visit Yuan Shu. Yuan Shu treated his guests to {{mandarin}} oranges. Lu Ji secretly took three oranges and hid them in his sleeve. When Lu Ji and his father were preparing to leave, the oranges suddenly rolled out of his sleeve. Yuan Shu said, [...] "Young Man Lu, you came as a guest. Why did you hide the oranges?" [...] Lu Ji <b>knelt</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> replied, [...] "I want to bring them home for my mother." [...] Yuan Shu was very impressed with Lu Ji. This incident {{is one of the}} 24 stories of filial piety in the Confucian classic The Twenty-four Filial Exemplars.|$|E
2500|$|The French column set {{out from}} Hanoi at dawn and reached Paper Bridge at around 7.30 a.m. [...] Rivière was unwell, and the column was under the direct command of chef de bataillon Berthe de Villers, an {{excellent}} professional soldier who had won a spectacular victory against the Vietnamese only seven weeks earlier at the Battle of Gia Cuc. [...] While crossing the bridge, the French vanguard came under fire from Black Flag skirmishers. [...] Berthe de Villers immediately deployed his men into line and pushed forward against the Black Flags, clearing them from the villages of Ha Yen Ke and Thien Thong. [...] Liu Yongfu brought up his reserves, waited until the enemy line was fully committed, and launched a sudden counterattack against the French right wing. [...] A Black Flag regiment trotted smartly into position with rifles at the slope, deployed into line, <b>knelt</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> fired a series of accurate volleys at close range. [...] Berthe de Villers was mortally wounded in this engagement, and Rivière assumed direct command of the French column.|$|E
60|$|The boys now <b>knelt</b> <b>down</b> together, <b>and</b> {{asked for}} {{protection}} through the peril {{which they were}} about to encounter. A few minutes later they rose, grasped each other's hand; and then--blowing out the light--groped their way upstairs, opened a window which led into the garden, and stepped out.|$|R
6000|$|Dot was {{a little}} frightened, for never before had she heard the Queen speak in any voice but a {{laughing}} one; but she <b>knelt</b> <b>down</b> obediently, <b>and</b> the Queen placed upon her head a small golden crown with four points, each point being tipped with a flashing gem. Then the Queen said: ...|$|R
60|$|She <b>knelt</b> <b>down</b> awhile <b>and</b> prayed, and I devoutly {{respected}} her devotions. The moon {{had begun}} to shine in upon one side {{of each of the}} three windows, and make a misty clearness in the room, by which I saw her indistinctly. When she rearose she made the sign of the cross.|$|R
2500|$|On another occasion, when Cao Pi {{was out on}} {{a hunting}} excursion, the fences built to trap the deer in an {{enclosed}} area were not properly secured so the deer broke through the fences and escaped. Cao Pi was so furious that he drew his sword and wanted to execute his servants. Su Ze <b>knelt</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> pleaded with him to spare the servants, saying, [...] "Your Majesty, I heard that the sage-rulers of ancient times would not harm people {{for the sake of}} animals. Now, Your Majesty wishes to promote the culture of Yao's time, yet Your Majesty wants to execute so many people just because a hunting excursion went wrong. I don't think this is something Your Majesty should do. With my life, I beg Your Majesty to spare these people." [...] Cao Pi replied, [...] "You're a subject who speaks his mind." [...] He then spared all his servants. Since then, Cao Pi became more wary of Su Ze because he knew that Su Ze would not hesitate to speak up and criticise him if he did something wrong.|$|E
2500|$|Two {{years later}} in 217, Cao Cao {{personally}} led an army, claimed to be 400,000 strong, to attack Sun Quan's garrison at Ruxu (濡須). Sun Quan led about 70,000 troops to counter the enemy. Gan Ning commanded the 3,000-strong vanguard. Sun Quan gave a secret order for Gan Ning to attack the enemy {{under the cover of}} nightfall, so Gan selected 100 elite soldiers. Before the battle, Sun Quan sent wine and various dishes to Gan Ning, who gave them to his men. After the feast, Gan Ning poured wine into a silver bowl and drank two bowls before offering it to an officer. The officer <b>knelt</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> did not dare to take the bowl, so Gan Ning drew his sword, placed it on his lap and said, [...] "You respect our lord but not me? I don't fear death. Why do you fear death?" [...] The officer saw that Gan Ning was very stern so he obliged and drank from it and then ordered each soldier to drink one bowl of wine." ...|$|E
2500|$|Around 226, Sun Quan {{had a large}} vessel {{constructed}} in Wuchang and he named the ship [...] "Chang'an" [...] (長安). He sailed on it towards Diaotaiyi (釣臺沂) but encountered a storm along the way. Gu Li then ordered the crew to head towards Fankou (樊口; northwest of present-day Echeng District, Ezhou, Hubei). Sun Quan said, [...] "We should go to Luozhou (羅州; present-day Huazhou, Guangdong)." [...] However, Gu Li brandished his sword at the crew and threatened, [...] "I'll execute any person who does not go to Fankou." [...] Upon reaching the port at Fankou, the storm had not subsided yet so they remained there. Sun Quan then asked Gu Li, [...] "Were you afraid of the river?" [...] Gu Li <b>knelt</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> said, [...] "Your Majesty is the master of thousands. You should not venture into treacherous waters and brave the storm. The ship may be large and steady, but if you encounter danger, {{what will happen to}} the state? That was why I strongly objected (to sailing towards Luozhou)." [...] When Sun Quan heard that, he respected Gu Li even more and started calling Gu by his surname since then.|$|E
60|$|She {{approached}} <b>and</b> <b>knelt</b> <b>down</b> {{beside him}} <b>and,</b> taking his hand, pressed {{it to her}} forehead. She was a girl of some fourteen years old, already, according to Mexican ideas, a woman.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{said this}} whilst I <b>knelt</b> <b>down</b> at, <b>and</b> {{unlocked}} a trunk which contained a brace of loaded pistols: I mean to shoot myself. I only entertained the intention for a moment; for, not being insane, {{the crisis of}} exquisite and unalloyed despair, which had originated the wish and design of self-destruction, was past in a second.|$|R
60|$|But Mr. Stephens had <b>knelt</b> <b>down</b> beside Sadie <b>and</b> {{buried his}} haggard {{face in his}} long, thin hands. Only the Colonel and Monsieur Fardet {{remained}} standing. Cochrane looked at the Frenchman with an interrogative eye.|$|R
2500|$|Around this time, Hou Cheng sent {{a trader}} to {{purchase}} 15 horses, {{but the man}} escaped with the horses and headed towards Xiaopei (小沛; present-day Pei County, Jiangsu) {{with the intention of}} defecting to Liu Bei. Hou Cheng personally pursued the trader and retrieved all the horses. Lü Bu's officers then threw a feast to celebrate Hou Cheng's achievement. Hou Cheng prepared 5-6 hu (斛) of wine and about ten roasted hogs, and he presented half a hog and five dou (斗) of wine to Lü Bu before the feast started. He <b>knelt</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> said, [...] "With your grace, I managed to retrieve the stolen horses. The others came to congratulate me, so I prepared some wine and hogs for a feast. I don't dare to start first, so now I present the food and wine to you." [...] Lü Bu was furious and he said, [...] "I banned alcohol, but you and the others dare to throw a party! Are you plotting with them to kill me?" [...] Hou Cheng was shocked and he immediately left. He also discarded the wine he prepared and returned the gifts he received from the other officers. Later, Hou Cheng, along with his colleagues Song Xian (宋憲) and Wei Xu (魏續), captured Lü Bu's strategist Chen Gong and general Gao Shun, and led their troops to surrender to Cao Cao.|$|E
2500|$|The Wu Li (吳歷) {{provided}} a different {{account of how}} Taishi Ci came to serve Sun Ce. It mentioned that Taishi Ci was defeated and captured by Sun Ce after their fight at Shen Village. Sun Ce had heard of Taishi Ci before so he released Taishi Ci from his bonds and asked him for advice on his future conquests. Taishi Ci replied, [...] "I am an officer of a defeated army. I am not qualified to speak on such matters." [...] Sun Ce said, [...] "In the past, Han Xin heeded advice from Guangwu. In the present, I seek advice from a man of righteousness. What are you talking about?" [...] Taishi Ci replied, [...] "My army has recently been defeated. The troops are scattered and low on morale. It may be difficult, but I still intend to gather and bring them together. I am afraid {{this is not what}} you wish to see." [...] Sun Ce <b>knelt</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> said, [...] "What I want is your sincerity. I hope you will return by midday tomorrow." [...] When Sun Ce's subordinates raised doubts about Taishi Ci's loyalty, Sun Ce said, [...] "Taishi Ziyi is a famous man from Qing Province. He is known for keeping his promises. I believe he will not deceive me." [...] The following day, Sun Ce hosted a banquet and had a pole erected in the middle, so as to keep track of time by observing its shadow. By midday, when the shadow was shortest, Taishi Ci returned as promised. Sun Ce was overjoyed. He often consulted Taishi Ci on military affairs later on.|$|E
2500|$|Puyi {{noted that}} {{to travel from}} just one {{building}} to another in the Forbidden City or for a stroll in the gardens, he was always surrounded by [...] "large retinue" [...] of eunuchs and that:"In front went an eunuch whose function was roughly that of a motor horn; he walked twenty or thirty yards ahead of the party intoning the sound “...chir ... chir...” {{as a warning to}} anyone who might be waiting in the vicinity to go away at once. Next came two Chief Eunuchs advancing crabwise {{on either side of the}} path; ten paces behind them came the centre of the procession. If I was being carried in a chair there would be two junior eunuchs walking beside me to attend to my wants at any moment; if I was walking they would be supporting me. Next came an eunuch with a large silk canopy followed by a large group of eunuchs, some empty-handed, others holding all sorts of things: a seat in case I wanted to rest, changes of clothing, umbrellas and parasols. After these eunuchs of the Imperial Presence came eunuchs of the Imperial tea bureau with boxes of various kinds of cakes and delicacies ... They were followed by eunuchs of the Imperial dispensary ... at the end of the procession came the eunuchs who carried commodes and chamberpots. If I was walking, a sedan-chair, open or covered according to the season, would bring up the rear. This motley procession of several dozen people would proceed in perfect silence and order".Puyi never had any privacy and had all his needs attended to at all times, having eunuchs open doors for him, dress him, wash him, and even blow air into his soup to cool it. Puyi delighted in humiliating his eunuchs, at one point, saying that as the [...] "Lord of TenThousand Years" [...] it was his right to order an eunuch to eat dirt, recalling: [...] "‘Eat that for me’ I ordered, and he <b>knelt</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> ate it". At his meals, Puyi was always presented with a huge buffet containing every conceivable dish, the vast majority of which he did not eat, and everyday Puyi wore new clothing as Chinese emperors never reused their clothing. The eunuchs had their own reasons for presenting Puyi with buffet meals and new clothing every day, as Puyi's used clothes made from the finest silk were sold on the black market while the food that Puyi did not eat was either sold or eaten by the eunuchs themselves.|$|E
60|$|The camels of the Dervishes had all <b>knelt</b> <b>down</b> simultaneously, <b>and</b> the men {{had sprung}} from their backs.
