However, the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s led {{to the introduction of}} low-cost modems and the idea of a semi-dedicated point-to-point link was no longer appropriate. There were potentially thousands of users who might want to dial any of the other thousands of users, and the only solution at the time was to make the user dial manually.|$|E
40|$|The idea of {{changing}} our energy system from a hierarchical design into {{a set of}} nearly independent microgrids becomes feasible with the availability of small renewable energy generators. The smart microgrid concept comes with several challenges in research and engineering targeting load balancing, pricing, consumer integration and home automation. In this paper we first provide an overview on these challenges and present approaches that target the problems identified. While there exist promising algorithms for the particular field, we see a missing integration which specifically targets smart microgrids. Therefore, we propose an architecture that integrates the presented approaches and defines interfaces between the identified components such as generators, storage, smart and <b>dumb</b> <b>devices.</b> Comment: presented at the GI Informatik 2012, Braunschweig Germany, Smart Grid Worksho...|$|E
40|$|The {{vision of}} {{wireless}} sensor networks {{is one of a}} smart collection of tiny, <b>dumb</b> <b>devices.</b> These motes may be individually cheap, unintelligent, imprecise, and unreliable. Yet they are able to derive strength from numbers, rendering the whole to be strong, reliable and robust. Our approach is to adopt a distributed and randomized mindset and rely on in network processing and network coding. Our general abstraction is that nodes should act only locally and independently, and the desired global behavior should arise as a collective property of the network. We summarize our work and present how these ideas can be applied for communication and storage in sensor networks.

40|$|Computer system {{architecture}} has changed: an assem-bly of autonomous components {{has replaced the}} om-nipotent CPU and its legion of <b>dumb</b> <b>devices.</b> Database Management System (DBMS) architecture, however, does not yet reflect this change: it is still dominated by a centralized kernel that limits {{the autonomy of the}} de-vices and, thus, their ability to exploit their increased “smartness”. Distributed data management research can serve as an inspiration for an architecture that addresses this problem. However, the respective algorithms were never designed with CPU efficiency in mind implement-ing principles like dynamic programming and recursion. More than two decades ago, the transition to mem-ory resident databases spawned a plethora of research on CPU-efficient query processors. We predict that hard-ware heterogeneity will trigger a similar line of research on CPU-efficient distributed algorithms and architectures. In this paper, we examine benefits and challenges that come with such a micro-distributed database manage-ment system. We also discuss a number of approaches that we consider steps towards a micro-distributed sys-tem. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: An {{important}} feature that differentiates moving object database (MOD) from other databases is that MOD can support queries for locations recorded {{not only at}} the sample time, but also at time between samples and even at time in the future. The most important issue in MOD research is to build models of moving objects ’ mobility and their locations update. The advance in mobile Internet and location-based services requires appropriate models be built for popular dumb terminals, such as cell phones, which can only be located by auxiliary facilities like GSM/CDMA networks. Considering that users of such kind <b>dumb</b> <b>devices</b> often move on the road network, a novel model for these moving objects to calculate their velocities in the past and future and to update their locations with varied sample time based on road network is presented in this paper. Compared with traditional velocity models, the proposed model can reduce the location prediction errors effectively. And when comparing with the model of updating locations with uniform sample time, the proposed model can reduce the communication traffic between moving objects and locating facilities with the same average prediction error. Key words: moving object database; road network; velocity computing model; location update model; varied sample tim...|$|E
40|$|Research in {{pervasive}} computing aims to fully integrate computing devices into our everyday environments in a seamless and efficient manner. Wireless technology such as Bluetooth takes us {{a step closer}} by replacing traditional cable connections with a more searnless communication transport, adding mobility and more human-centric computation. However, {{if we are to}} fully integrate this technology, we must first address some of its shortcomings, particularly those with respect to areas with a high density of Bluetooth devices. Four of these shortcomings: susceptibility to anonymous attacks, poor power management, synchrony requirement, and lack of friendships stem from the tight coupling of device interactions during the discovery protocol. One solution to this problem uses the advantages of publish and subscribe systems to decouple this interaction between smart mobile devices. Available devices can announce their availability to a central controller while devices interested in finding others can announce their interests. When a match occurs, the controller notifies both parties and provides information on how they can form a direct connection. This solution preserves the functionality of the Bluetooth connection protocol while circumventing the four shortcomings. The assumptions it makes are reasonable when placed in a the context of personal computing environment. Future considerations include optimizations that utilize caching, improvements on performance, increases in system capacity, and solutions for including <b>dumb</b> <b>devices.</b> by Jessica Yu-Tien Huang.

50|$|The Maxwell zombies sidestep these shortcoming. First, {{they are}} {{macroscopic}} in size, rather than microscopic, hence are not crippled by thermal fluctuations. Moreover, they operate on {{vast numbers of}} molecules simultaneously, rather than one at a time, therefore {{they are much more}} efficient. Second, they have no need to 'see' molecules; instead, they operate on them as they come along. Third, they do not perform computations. Thus, unlike Maxwell's demon, which is a small, intelligent, perceiving creature, Maxwell zombies are big, <b>dumb,</b> and blind <b>devices.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{devices and}} {{facilities}} in the core / backbone networks are switches and routers. The trend is to push the intelligence and decision making into access and edge devices and keep the core <b>devices</b> <b>dumb</b> and fast. As a result, switches {{are more and more}} often used in the core/backbone network facilities. Technologies used in the core and backbone facilities are data link layer and network layer technologies such as SONET, DWDM, ATM, IP, etc. For enterprise backbone network, Gigabit Ethernet or 10 Gigabit Ethernet technologies are also often used.|$|R

However despite this recent evolution the Thin Client model {{has yet to}} re-emerge as a relevant design in an IT industry where Fat Clients (desktops and laptops) thrive. This paper describes two case studies performed within the Dublin Institute of Technology School of Computing, focused {{on the issue of}} student acceptance of this technology. The first case study provides a dedicated single service Thin Client implementation, while the second case study adopts a process of coexistence with Fat Clients in addition to providing new services to users. This paper examines both approaches as strategies for the integration of Thin Client technology into a Higher Level Educational Institute and through our data analysis demonstrates that while co-existence improves acceptance there are clearly additional factors to be resolved...|$|R
40|$|Networking data {{analytics}} is increasingly used for enhanced network visibility and controllability. We draw {{the similarities between}} the Software Defined Networking (SDN) architecture and the MapReduce programming model. Inspired by the similarity, we suggest the necessary data plane innovations to make network data plane devices function as distributed mappers and optionally, reducers. A streaming network data MapReduce architecture can therefore conveniently solve a series of network monitoring and management problems. Unlike the traditional networking data analytical system, our proposed system embeds the {{data analytics}} engine directly in the network infrastructure. The affinity leads to a concise system architecture and better cost performance ratio. On top of this architecture, we propose a general MapReduce-like programming model for real-time and one-pass networking data analytics, which involves joint in-network and out-of-network computing. We show this model can address a wide range of interactive queries from various network applications. This position paper strives to make a point that the white-box trend does not necessarily lead to simple and <b>dumb</b> networking <b>devices.</b> Rather, the defining characteristics of the next generation white-box are open and programmable, so that the network devices can be made smart and versatile to support new services and applications...|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} we argue that rescue {{robotics}} is an important steppingstone in the scientific challenge to create autonomous systems. We motivate why {{we believe that there}} is a significant market for rescue robots, which has unique features that allow a fruitful combination of application oriented developments and basic research. Based on several application examples, for example the estimate that about 2000 road accidents per year in Germany alone involve hazardous goods, we conclude that there is a tremendous need for rescue robots. Unlike other markets for advanced robotics systems like service robots, the rescue robotics domain benefits from the fact that there is a human in the loop, which allows a stepwise transition from <b>dumb</b> teleoperated <b>devices</b> to truly autonomous systems.
