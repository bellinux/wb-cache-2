He and his brother were present during the 1996 Dunblane school massacre, when Thomas Hamilton killed 16 children and a teacher before shooting himself; Murray took cover <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>classroom.</b> Murray says {{he was too young}} to understand what was happening and is reluctant to talk about it in interviews, but in his autobiography Hitting Back he states that he attended a youth group run by Hamilton, and that his mother gave Hamilton lifts in her car. Murray later attended Dunblane High School.|$|E
5|$|Shiva {{decides to}} travel to Panchavati under the {{guidance}} of Kali, who is the Naga queen and knows the path through the Dandak Forest to the Naga capital. While traveling they are attacked from the river side by a cache of ships containing {{the weapons of mass destruction}} known as Daivi Astra that was once forbidden by Lord Rudra, the legendary supreme ruler of India. After fleeing from the attack and safely reaching Panchavati, Shiva and Sati suspect Daksha to be behind this. Kali takes Shiva to a nearby school in the capital, where she believes that the greatest secret of the Nagas lies. There <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>classroom,</b> Shiva finds Brahaspati, perfectly alive and teaching a class.|$|E
5|$|Malawi {{has adopted}} task {{shifting}} strategies {{to overcome the}} shortage of workers available for HIV/AIDS treatment and care. Task shifting, which {{has been successful in}} many other regions, involves training less specialized health workers to perform health-related tasks that do not require professional training, such as the initiation of antiretroviral therapy. For example, at Thyolo District Hospital, health workers spend one week learning how to initiate antiretroviral therapy <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>classroom</b> setting and an additional two weeks practicing their knowledge in a supervised clinical setting; after completing this course, they are legally (under Ministry of Health guidelines) allowed to initiate antiretroviral therapy. Another form of task shifting involves training health-oriented counselors in HIV testing and counseling, which relieves nurses of this additional task.|$|E

5|$|The {{music video}} premiered on MTV Live on May 12, 1998. The clip {{starts with the}} rising of the sun, until it {{progresses}} into the Koyaanisqatsi inspired section, featuring time-lapse images of daily life, from people riding a subway, ordering food, bowling, and children <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>classroom</b> to sped-up city-scapes and freeways at night. Interspersed in the scenes is Madonna dancing and singing the track, her image partially merged with {{the backdrop of the}} fast-sped cityscape. During the intermediate verse the high-speed motion stops with the camera focusing on Madonna only against a sunset backdrop but quickly speeds up again. As the clip continues into nightfall, high-speed images of Madonna dancing in a discothèque is shown, with the camera focusing on the revelers, until she is seen falling asleep on the dance floor, and a revolving shot of planet Earth.|$|E
5|$|They awake <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>classroom</b> in a small, vacated island, {{surrounded}} by troops, and wearing metal collars around their necks. A teacher, psychopathic sadist Kinpatsu Sakamochi, briefs the students: the class has been chosen {{to participate in}} the Program. They have three days to kill each other until one stands as the victor, or the metal collars will detonate, killing them all (as Sakamochi gleefully demonstrates on one student). The students are issued survival packs and a random weapon/tool, and sent out onto the island one by one. While most of the students receive guns and knives, some acquire relatively useless items like boomerangs, dartboard darts, or a fork. Hiroki Sugimura finds a radar device that tracks nearby students, and Toshinori Oda receives a bulletproof vest.|$|E
5|$|After fans likened Naruto, Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno to {{the three}} main {{characters}} from Harry Potter fantasy books, Kishimoto noted that both trios began their careers <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>classroom,</b> though {{he added that the}} similarity was unintentional. During the series' publication, Kishimoto married and had children. This influenced how he viewed Naruto's character. Naruto met his parents, and learned of their sacrifices in order to help him to control the Fox inside him so that he could protect their world. As a result, Naruto appreciated his life more and learned that his parents loved him, something the author wanted the character to feel based on his own experience as a father. In the first chapters of the series, Kishimoto did not conceive the idea that Naruto would be the son of Minato Namikaze. However, as time passed on, the manga author made touches to Minato's face shown in the Hokage Mountain in Konoha to make them more similar to Naruto with an emphasis on their spiky hairs. However, in order to reduce too many similarities, Kushina Uzumaki's character was made to look like Naruto's face. Kishimoto's first editor, Kosuke Yahagi, praised the author for the way he handled Naruto's parents and his heritage.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} draw {{parallels}} between {{different approaches to}} classroom instruction and two contrasting musical styles and to examine how pupils with Acquired Brain Injuries (ABI) might fare <b>in</b> each. <b>A</b> polyphonic <b>classroom</b> is defined as one where an awareness of multiple layers of meaning are encouraged to enhance the learning opportunities, whereas <b>in</b> <b>a</b> classical <b>classroom</b> most of the layers expressly support a single dominant line.

Additionally, we define a set of learning analytics tasks as services, which defines a knowledge feedback loop for the smart classroom, {{in order to improve}} the learning process in it, and we explain how they can be invoked and consumed by the agents <b>in</b> <b>a</b> smart <b>classroom...</b>|$|R
5|$|The video {{opens in}} a deserted, {{destroyed}} school hallway with Lee's character shown {{sitting on the}} ground. As the first verse begins, he slowly begins {{to stand up and}} makes his way through the hallway. The boy then sees a female teacher <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>classroom</b> who's stricken with fear and closes the door, realizing that the boy is the cause of the damage. As the boy makes his way outside the school building, a police car arrives and the teacher rushes outside to tell the policeman about the boy, who then quickly rides a bicycle home to pack his things. While at home, he sees a news report about the incident, causing him to quickly gather his things to flee. Several policemen then appear outside {{the front door of the}} boy's house, while he tries to escape through the back door. The boy realizes that the door is locked so he uses his telekinetic powers to grab the keys from the kitchen bench. The policemen then enter the house to find that the boy has escaped, but find a teddy bear and a plush frog floating in the air. The final scene shows the boy running away from a SWAT team in the woods. The boy is caught by one of the men who pushes him to the ground. The video ends with the boy using his supernatural powers once again to push the men away in a burst of power; this references how the boy destroyed the school in the first place, as he's in the same position he was in at the beginning of the video. The aftermath of the outburst in the end, however, remains unknown.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the next}} {{two and a half}} hours, Cho {{returned}} to his room to rearm himself; he mailed a package to NBC News that contained pictures, digital video files and documents. At approximately 9:45a.m. EDT (13:45 UTC), he then crossed the campus to Norris Hall, a classroom building on the campus where, in a span of nine minutes, Cho shot dozens of people, killing 30 of them. As police breached the area of the building where Cho attacked the faculty and students, Cho committed suicide in Norris 211 with a gunshot to his temple. Cho's gunshot wound destroyed his face, obscuring identification of his body for several hours. The police identified Cho by matching the fingerprints on the guns used in the shootings with immigration records. Before the shootings, Cho's only known connection to Norris Hall was as a student in the sociology class, which met <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>classroom</b> {{on the second floor of}} the building. Although police had not stated positively at the time of the initial investigation that Cho was the perpetrator of the Norris Hall shootings and the earlier one at West Ambler Johnston Hall, forensic evidence confirmed that the same gun was used in both shooting incidents.|$|E
