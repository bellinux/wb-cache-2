25|$|In July 2001, Calgary Transit {{brought the}} first of 15 new SD160 LRVs into service to {{accommodate}} the South LRT Extension Phase I and increased capacity. Throughout 2003, another 17 SD160 LRVs were introduced into the fleet to accommodate the NW Extension to Dalhousie {{as well as the}} South LRT Extension Phase II. However, demand for light rail <b>has</b> <b>exploded</b> in recent years. In the decade prior to 2006, the city's population grew by 25% to over 1 million people, while ridership on the CTrain grew at twice that rate, by 50% in only 10 years. This resulted in severe overcrowding on the trains and demands for better service. In December 2004, city council approved an order for 33 additional SD-160 vehicles from Siemens to not only address overcrowding, but to accommodate the NE extension to McKnight–Westwinds and the NW extension to Crowfoot. These new SD160s started to enter service in November 2006. In December 2006, CT extended the order by seven cars to a total of 40 cars, which had all been delivered by the spring of 2008. There are now a total of 72 first-generation SD 160s numbered 2201 – 2272.|$|E
25|$|His nemesis in {{the film}} is adapted from the pulp series' long-running Asian villain (and for the film, a fellow telepath), the evil Shiwan Khan (John Lone), a {{descendant}} of Genghis Khan. He seeks to finish his ancestor's legacy of conquering the world by first destroying New York City, using a newly developed atomic bomb, {{in a show of}} his power. Khan nearly succeeds in this, but he is thwarted by The Shadow in a final psychic duel of death: Cranston, as The Shadow, imposes his will on, and defeats, Khan during a psychokinetically enhanced battle in a mirrored room, which <b>has</b> <b>exploded</b> into thousands of flying mirror shards. Focusing his mind's psychokinetic power, The Shadow flips a flying piece of jagged mirror in mid-air and then hurls it directly at a spot on Khan's forehead; this does not kill him, it renders him unconscious. To save both the warlord and the world, The Shadow secretly arranges with one of his agents, an administrative doctor at an unidentified New York asylum for the criminally insane, to have Khan locked away permanently in a padded cell; Khan's badly-injured frontal lobe, which controlled his psychic powers, having been surgically removed.|$|E

25|$|The {{first use}} of small-molecule drugs to treat cancer {{was in the early}} 20th century, {{although}} the specific chemicals first used were not originally intended for that purpose. Mustard gas was used as a chemical warfare agent during World War I and was discovered to be a potent suppressor of hematopoiesis (blood production). A similar family of compounds known as nitrogen mustards were studied further during World War II at the Yale School of Medicine. It was reasoned that an agent that damaged the rapidly growing white blood cells might have a similar effect on cancer. Therefore, in December 1942, several patients with advanced lymphomas (cancers of the lymphatic system and lymph nodes) were given the drug by vein, rather than by breathing the irritating gas. Their improvement, although temporary, was remarkable. Concurrently, during a military operation in World War II, following a German air raid on the Italian harbour of Bari, several hundred people were accidentally exposed to mustard gas, which had been transported there by the Allied forces to prepare for possible retaliation in the event of German use of chemical warfare. The survivors were later found to have very low white blood cell counts. After WWII was over and the reports declassified, the experiences converged and led researchers to look for other substances that might have similar effects against cancer. The first chemotherapy drug to be developed from this line of research was mustine. Since then, many other drugs have been developed to treat cancer, and drug development <b>has</b> <b>exploded</b> into a multibillion-dollar industry, although the principles and limitations of chemotherapy discovered by the early researchers still apply.|$|E

500|$|The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston in Berkshire was {{directed}} by William Penney, with William Cook as his deputy. The scientists at Aldermaston {{did not know how}} to build a hydrogen bomb, but produced three designs: Orange Herald, a large boosted fission weapon in which the fission yield was increased ("boosted") though the addition of lithium-6 deuteride; Green Bamboo, an interim thermonuclear design in which fusion occurred in layers of lithium-6 deuteride that alternated with layers of [...] uranium-235; and Green Granite, a true thermonuclear design in which the thermonuclear fuel was separate and the majority of the yield came from thermonuclear burning. The British bomb designers used the terms [...] "Tom" [...] and [...] "Dick" [...] for the bomb's primary and secondary stages respectively. The Tom would be a fission bomb. It would produce radiation to implode the Dick. Implicit in the creation of a hydrogen bomb was that it would be tested. Eden, who replaced Churchill as prime minister after the latter's retirement on 5 April 1955, gave a radio broadcast in which he declared: [...] "You cannot prove a bomb until it <b>has</b> <b>exploded.</b> Nobody can know whether it is effective or not until it has been tested." ...|$|E

Former world No. 1 Chris Evert writes: [...] "Tennis <b>has</b> <b>exploded</b> in China. The country now has some 15 million tennis players; 116 million watched Li win the French Open. That kind of exposure is crucial to our sport, and it never would have happened without Li. At tournaments, I've seen her charm the crowds. When she smiles, everyone melts. She's just such a breath of fresh air. Her friendly on-court demeanour as well as her hilariously-witty post-match interviews brings a smile to everyone's face." [...] Li also appeared on the cover of 26 May 2014 edition of Time magazine, which featured an article titled [...] "The Passion of Li Na", in which author Hannah Beech described Li as a world class sports idol, inspiring millions of Chinese people to regard her as an icon of pursuing independent character and freedom of thought. In 2012, Forbes listed Li as No. 85 in the Forbes Celebrity 100 list. Li, along with the fellow tennis players Maria Sharapova and Serena Williams, were the only three female athletes who cracked the Top 100 earning list. Li was ranked No. 5 and No.8 on the Forbes China Celebrity 100 list in 2012 and 2014 respectively. Li is affectionately called [...] "Big Sister Na" [...] (娜姐, pinyin: Nàjiě) among Chinese communities and is considered a [...] "strong, unbending and unyielding" [...] role model.
