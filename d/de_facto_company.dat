5000|$|Merchant {{shipping}} companies (and particularly liner {{companies such as}} Cunard Line and ferries such as Red Funnel) were quick to recognise the publicity value of distinctive funnels, {{both in terms of}} shape, number of funnels, and the colours they were painted. In an era when ship hulls were uniformly painted black (to conceal inevitable dirt when loading the ship with coal) and superstructures were white (to control the temperature in the passenger accommodation in hot summers) the funnel {{was one of the few}} parts of the ship that a company could use to clearly differentiate its ships from those of its competitors. Each company would have their own [...] "house colours", which were often used in publicity material as well as for recognition, making funnel colours an early form of trademark. Some companies became so closely associated with their funnel colours that their nickname became a <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>company</b> name. For example, the shipping line actually registered as 'Alfred Holt & Company' was more widely known as the Blue Funnel Line. The Southampton, Isle of Wight and South of England Royal Mail Steam Packet Company has traded under the name Red Funnel for most of its 150+ year history. Other colours such as the red with black stripes of the Cunard Line and the all buff colour of P&O remain icons of their respective lines and have remained in use for over a century through many changes of corporate ownership.|$|E

40|$|This thesis investigates de jure {{convergence}} of Vietnamese Accounting Standards (VAS) and International Accounting Standards (IAS/IFRS) and de facto (actual company reporting practice) compliance with VAS and IAS/IFRS using {{a sample of}} 200 Vietnamese listed companies’ 2010 annual financial reports. This study is important because Vietnam is one of Asia’s fastest growing economies whilst Vietnamese accounting is poorly understood. The de jure analysis shows that during the period 2001 - 2005 Vietnam initially adopted 84 % of the IAS/IFRS issued up through 2003. However, subsequent amendments and new IFRSs have not been updated to VASs, causing {{a significant decrease in}} overall de jure convergence to a very modest level of 62 %. Non-convergence is more noticeable for disclosure than for measurement issues. The de facto analysis shows a somewhat higher level (80 %) of compliance with VAS but a lower level (67 %) of compliance with IAS/IFRS by Vietnamese listed companies. Disclosure non-compliance is particularly problematic for Vietnam. State ownership, company size and audit firm type are major predictors of measurement compliance, whereas stock exchange location and audit firm type are key predictors of disclosure compliance. The modest de jure {{convergence of}} VAS and IAS/IFRS combined with the moderate <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>company</b> compliance with VAS leads to a lower de facto compliance with IAS/IFRS in Vietnam. The key implication is that enhancement of mechanisms for complying with accounting standards is as important as improvement of de jure convergence to achieve <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>company</b> reporting convergence with IAS/IFRS in Vietnam. This highlights the role of national accounting standard setters and regulators in promoting the convergence process. From a more global perspective, if the International Accounting Standards Board is to truly achieve its global convergence aim they should review their rule-making approach for emerging markets like Vietnam...|$|E
40|$|Taking {{into account}} the status of spouses by {{business}} law of the Organization for the Harmonization of African Business Law (OHADA) is referring to general commercial law and company law. The OHADA legislator values the status of spouses devoting equality between spouses, through the possibility {{for them to be}} able to be involved in low risk companies; the recognition of the <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>company</b> between them and the right granted to each power, under the same conditions, benefit from the commercial lease originally attached to privileges. The consideration that the OHADA law grants the quality of husband appears in heritage protection thereof, insofar as it puts it away in case of depletion bad deal made by one of them. This is why the prohibition for spouses to be involved in the unlimited risk firms and the requirement of a separate trade as a condition for the spouse of the trader can also acquire the same status. But the heritage protection system spouse taken from the OHADA business law is supplemented by certain mechanisms of civil law, including matrimonial property regimes, although not all have the same efficiency. Indeed, among the two groups of matrimonial property regimes are known as separation schemes and those of the community property, only the first effectively protect the couple's assets. This objective likely was not assigned to the second from the design. These look more forward the merger of most of the assets of the couple without the slightest idea of calculation...|$|E
