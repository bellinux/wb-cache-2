After seeing American Tejano pop singer Selena perform at a showcase event, Torres immediately wanted to record a duet with her. He said in Selena Remembered; a documentary about her career, [...] "...she had an attractive way about her that was always present. We got along very well and a friendship developed from that point on. Several months later I wrote a song which <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>would</b> be good to record a duet with Selena." [...] "Buenos Amigos" [...] was recorded for Torres' tenth studio album Nada Se Compara Contigo (1991).|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of shooting, Jack Nicholson had {{appeared}} in two films, and had worked with Roger Corman as the lead in The Cry Baby Killer. According to Nicholson, [...] "I went in to the shoot knowing I {{had to be very}} quirky because Roger originally hadn't wanted me. In other words, I couldn't play it straight. So I just did a lot of weird shit that <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>would</b> make it funny." [...] According to Dick Miller, all of the dialogue between his character and Mel Welles was ad-libbed. During a scene in which writer Charles B. Griffith played a robber, Griffith remembers that [...] "When [...] and I forgot my lines, I improvised a little, but then I was the writer. I was allowed to." [...] However, Welles states that [...] "Absolutely none of it was ad-libbed [...] every word in Little Shop was written by Chuck Griffith, and I did ninety-eight pages of dialogue in two days." ...|$|E
500|$|Before {{her death}} Brennan and Crowley began telling people about Richard and Richard's family {{became aware that}} there was a belief that she was [...] "special." [...] Floyd Calais, a Catholic priest who was at the time the {{chaplain}} of Charity Hospital in Lafayette, was a close friend of Brennan. In 1961, Calais began praying to Richard to be assigned to a parish. He was assigned to St. Edwards parish in Richard, Louisiana—Richard's burial place—that same year. Once there, he discovered the need to raise money to build a new church there. Calais says that he was [...] "invited to retreats and recollections, and began speaking about Charlene, how she achieved grace before she died" [...] and about the need for money to build a new church in the parish. [...] "People started going to her grave," [...] he said, [...] "and began sending checks to build the church. What <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>would</b> take 8–10 years took 2 1/2." ...|$|E

500|$|While {{performing}} at the 1998 KROQ Weenie Roast in Irvine, California, Third Eye Blind bassist Arion Salazar ran onstage and [...] "bear-hugged" [...] Dirnt, who was caught off-guard. [...] The incident escalated into an on-stage scuffle before Salazar {{was taken away}} by security. [...] After the performance, Dirnt confronted Salazar backstage, and as the two were arguing, a beer bottle struck Dirnt in the head, causing a small fracture in his skull. [...] Eyewitnesses later attributed the bottle throwing to a fan of Third Eye Blind. [...] Salazar and the band's management soon released a statement: [...] "I am sorry that my attempt at doing something <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>would</b> be funny escalated into Mike getting hurt. That was never my intention. I simply {{had too much to}} drink and made a very bad decision. [...] If I had been in Mike's place, I am sure I would have acted similarly. My heart goes out to him and I hope he recovers quickly." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{his running}} mate, Buchanan chose African-American activist and retired teacher from Los Angeles, Ezola B. Foster. Buchanan was {{supported}} in this election run by future Socialist Party USA presidential candidate Brian Moore, who said in 2008 he supported Buchanan in 2000 because [...] "he was for fair trade over free trade. He had some progressive positions that <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>would</b> be helpful to the common man." [...] On August 19, the New York Right to Life Party, in convention, chose Buchanan as their nominee, with 90 percent of the districts voting for him.|$|E

No. There were songs on the table, and I went with the one <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>would</b> represent the moment the best." [...] The cover reached number 24 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and number 13 on the Canadian Hot 100.

2500|$|.....in Buddhism {{the image}} of the mother as the {{embodiment}} of compassion is used a lot. She'll do anything for the children. As a mother I felt that depth of love and commitment and having somebody who I really would give my own life for—it was very powerful {{to have that kind of}} relationship. I also felt that I didn't really grow up until I had my children. There were ways that maturity was demanded of me and having children brought forth that maturity. So I wouldn't say my children were an inspiration in the sense of what <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>would</b> have been a spiritual inspiration before I had children. More so I think meeting the challenges of motherhood with what I had learned made my practice very rich.|$|E

It was while speaking to a West Indian Negro who was a passenger with me from Southampton, who was returning home to the East Indies from Basutoland with his Basuto wife, I further learned of the horrors of native life in Africa. He related to me in conversation such horrible and pitiable tales that my heart bled within me. Retiring from the conversation to my cabin, all day and the following night I pondered over the subject matter of that conversation, and at midnight, lying flat on my back, the vision and thought came to me that I should name the organization the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities (Imperial) League. Such a name <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>would</b> embrace the purpose of all black humanity. Thus to the world a name was born, a movement created, and a man became known." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tolkien {{wrote in}} one of his letters: [...] "what I think is a primary ‘fact’ about my work, that it is all of a piece, and {{fundamentally}} linguistic in inspiration. [...] It is not a ‘hobby’, in the sense of something quite different from one’s work, taken up as a relief-outlet. The invention of languages is the foundation. The ‘stories’ were made rather to provide a world for the languages than the reverse. To me a name comes ﬁrst and the story follows. I should have preferred to write in ‘Elvish’. But, of course, such a work as The Lord of the Rings has been edited and only as much ‘language’ has been left in as <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>would</b> be stomached by readers. (I now ﬁnd that many would have liked more.) [...] It is to me, anyway, largely an essay in ‘linguistic aesthetic’, as I sometimes say to people who ask me ‘what is it all about’." ...|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Tom Oreb was tasked as {{character}} stylist {{that would not}} only inhabit {{the style of the}} backgrounds, but also fit with the contemporary UPA style. Likewise with Earle's background styling, the animators complained that the character designs were too rigid to animate. For Maleficent, Marc Davis drew from Czechoslovakian religious paintings and used [...] "the red and black drapery in the back that looked like flames that <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>would</b> be great to use. I took the idea of the collar partly from a bat, and the horns looked like a devil." [...] However, in an act of artistic compromise, Earle, with final approval on the character designs, requested the change to lavender as red would come off too strong, which Davis agreed to. In addition, Davis served as directing animator over the title character with the character's figure and features based on those of Audrey Hepburn as well as her voice actress, Mary Costa.|$|E

2500|$|Foy {{appears in}} her feature-film debut {{as the girl}} {{who is accused of}} being a witch. Known for her titular role in the British miniseries Little Dorrit, she met Sena and sought the role in Season of the Witch. She {{explained}} the choice, [...] "It's quite a manipulative role; the character does a lot of manipulating. Pitting other people against each other, being quite mischievous... That was something <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>would</b> obviously be good to do." [...] Foy researched witchcraft and demonic possession for the role. She described its appeal, [...] "Playing a character that was making things happen, and mainly in control of an entire group of men. And for once, be the character that is completely in the know about everything. There is nothing that she doesn't know. Nothing is a surprise. And she is able to deal with every single situation that arises the way that she sees fit. And I think that was quite refreshing {{to be able to play}} a character that wasn't entirely beholden to everyone else." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 2012, writer Cullen Bunn {{stated that}} the concept of the series came to him while {{scripting}} the fifth or sixth issue of , which also starred Valkyrie. Bunn said he was campaigning for the book following the conclusion of Fear Itself: The Fearless, when an editor pitched the idea of doing it as a Defenders title. However Bunn explained that beyond the name there is [...] "little connection" [...] to the Defenders. In November 2012, Marvel Comics teased the announcement of The Fearless Defenders by releasing an image of the word [...] "Fearless" [...] with the creative team of Bunn and artist Will Sliney. A week later, Marvel made the full announcement. Bunn said, [...] "The basic idea of the book is that Valkyrie is choosing a new team of Valkyrior, and she's been asked to choose all these women from the heroes of Midgard (Earth), instead of from Asgard". Bunn also said that Misty Knight co-stars in the series, [...] "They're our co-leads, {{and the rest of the}} team will build around them. I think it'll be interesting to see how the two of them see things differently. You've got Misty, who's a very street-level character. And you've got Valkyrie, who's a goddess". Dani Moonstar was revealed as the third member of team. Bunn said, [...] "She has such a connection to the Valkyrie. She was on the top of my list when I started putting together who <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>would</b> be the core roster".|$|E
2500|$|When Chauvel {{arrived in}} Damascus, {{he told his}} staff [...] "to pitch my camp in a clean orchard {{just out of the}} city, which <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>would</b> suit me better after what I had seen of the place. I then went back to my camp, had lunch, and became {{immersed}} in problems of supply, collection of prisoners, orders for the morrow, etc., sending off first of all an aeroplane message to Lord Allenby, telling him what I had done." [...] He also sent for the British Supply Officer of the Hejaz Forces. [...] "Before discussing supply matters, however, he ... said 'they are out to make as little as possible of the British and make the populace think that it is the Arabs who have driven out the Turk. This is why Lawrence asked you to keep your men out of the city and they have no intention of asking you for any police.' He also said 'They are getting the British Consulate ready for you. If you go there you are not defining yourself as the Conqueror of this country, but rather as a contributory ally. You should take possession of Djemal Pasha's house, which is the best one in the place, and which they are reserving for Feisal.' He said there was absolute chaos in the city, the Bazaars were closed and all the better class of people were terrified at the idea of the Hejaz crowd being in charge." [...] As a result, Chauvel decided to march through the city the following day, with [...] "practically every unit being represented; guns, armoured cars, everything, and I also took possession of Djemal's house." ...|$|E
