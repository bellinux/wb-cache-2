Traditjonally the occasion when state regulatory commissions most explicitly sought to define the local calling area was {{in the context of a}} petition for <b>extended</b> <b>area</b> <b>service</b> (EAS). These proceedings tended to be contentious and time-consuming, and ad hoc solutions often had to be fashioned. In this report, EAS petitions are seen as an early warning that a change in some factor or trend is affecting the current commissio...|$|E

40|$|Although {{telephone}} pricing {{has received}} increasing attention in recent years, the geographic patterns of telephone pricing {{and the corresponding}} economic consequences of those patterns have remained perplexing to consumers and policymakers and largely unaddressed by economists. In this article we first specify {{a model of the}} demand for short (intraLATA) long distance calling. We then draw upon data made available by the recent adoption of <b>extended</b> <b>area</b> <b>service</b> (EAS) in four metropolitan areas to empirically measure the structure of inter-exchange telephone demand. Given these estimates, and a conceptual framework for analyzing the economic welfare effects, we were able to quantify the consumer-surplus effects of alternative pricing policies. The empirical results indicate that consumer surplus is noticeably enhanced by adopting EAS. But the net economic welfare effects are shown to be sensitive to, among other things, the level of price-cost margins prevailing prior to the implementation of EAS. ...|$|E

500|$|By 1916, under Harrison's leadership, the Southern had {{expanded}} to an [...] network across 13 states, its greatest extent until the 1950s. Following the United States' entry into World War I, {{the federal government}} {{took control of the}} railroads in December 1917, running them through the United States Railroad Administration, on which Harrison served. An economic boom after the war helped the company to expand its operations; Harrison worked to improve the railroad's public relations and to upgrade the locomotive stock by introducing more powerful engines. Another of his concerns was {{to increase the amount of}} railroad track and to <b>extend</b> the <b>area</b> <b>serviced</b> by the railway. Harrison struggled to keep the railroad afloat during the Great Depression, and by 1936 Southern was once again showing a profit. Harrison retired in 1937, intending to focus on his hobby of writing about historical subjects including the roots of the American Thoroughbred horse, but he died three months later in February 1938.|$|R

In November 2007, LED electronic destination signs were installed {{to replace the}} scroll-style signs prone to ripping during operation. In fall 2010, advertisements made their way aboard city buses. There are additional projects awaiting funding for infrastructure improvement and larger projects well into the planning stage. Many planned improvements and developments are aimed to expand <b>service</b> <b>area</b> and operation times and improving local transportation coordination, as well as adding new infrastructure and facilities. In August 2010 the fixed-route system was reconfigured, taking existing routes and rerouting them to <b>extend</b> the <b>service</b> <b>area.</b> Saturday routes (previously different from weekday routes) were aligned with weekday routes. The 105 Yellow route was restored to commuter-route status as the 105 Purple route; a transfer between 105 and 101 was added, and the 101 Orange Route South was rescheduled to travel against the congestion which had previously caused delays.|$|R
50|$|At night, {{especially}} in winter months {{and at times}} of low solar activity, the ionospheric D layer can virtually disappear. When this happens, MF radio waves can easily be received hundreds or even {{thousands of miles away}} as the signal will be refracted by the remaining F layer. This can be very useful for long-distance communication, but can also interfere with local stations. Due to the limited number of available channels in the MW broadcast band, the same frequencies are re-allocated to different broadcasting stations several hundred miles apart. On nights of good skywave propagation, the signals of distant stations may reflect off the ionosphere and interfere with the signals of local stations on the same frequency. In North America, the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement (NARBA) sets aside certain channels for nighttime use over <b>extended</b> <b>service</b> <b>areas</b> via skywave by a few specially licensed AM broadcasting stations. These channels are called clear channels, and the stations, called clear-channel stations, are required to broadcast at higher powers of 10 to 50 kW.|$|R

40|$|Multi-hop ad-hoc {{networks}} {{consist of}} nodes which cooperate by forwarding packets {{for each other}} to allow communication beyond the power range of each node. In pure ad-hoc networks, no additional infrastructure is required to allow the nodes to communicate. Multi-hop hybrid networks are a combination of ad-hoc and cellular networks. As in ad-hoc networks, the nodes forward packets on behalf of other nodes. However, a few base stations are introduced. This enables long-range communication, increases connectivity and allows centralized services. In our work, we investigate the problem of placing base stations in multi-hop hybrid networks. Since nodes <b>extend</b> the <b>service</b> <b>area</b> by themselves, conventional cellular approaches are not suitable for such networks. We propose the Cluster Covering Algorithm, an algorithm which {{takes into account the}} percolation phenomenon, and compare it with several greedy algorithms. We measure the connectivity through different simulations on real population distribution data of Zurich (CH), the Surselva Valley (CH) and Finland. The simulation result...|$|R

At night, especially in winter months and at times of low solar activity, the lower ionospheric D layer virtually disappears.

40|$|Abstract—Based on IEEE 802. 16 e standard, WiMAX {{proposed}} a relay-based approach, namely, the IEEE 802. 16 j standard, to <b>extend</b> the <b>service</b> <b>area</b> of Base Stations (BSs) {{and to improve}} the quality of RSS, and then achieved the advantages of low-cost and compatible with existing WiMAX protocol. According to the different features on mobility and relay range, Relay Station (RS) can be classified into three types: Fixed RS (FRS), Nomadic RS (NRS) and Mobile RS (MRS). Since a relay-based WiMAX network includes different types of RSs, how to efficiently construct the relay-based WiMAX and how to determine an optimal routing path between a Mobile Station (MS) and the MR-BS become two important issues. This paper thus {{proposed a}}n IEEE 802. 16 j-conformed relay-based adaptive cost-based routing approach, in which a multihop optimal path is selected in terms of link bandwidth, path length and channel condition. Numerical results demonstrated that the proposed routing approach significantly outperforms other approaches in Fractional Reward Loss, network utilization and average end-to-end path delay...|$|R
