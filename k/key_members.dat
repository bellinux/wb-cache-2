5|$|The Parisian bid {{suffered}} two setbacks {{during the}} inspection: {{a number of}} strikes and demonstrations coincided with the visit, and a report was released stating that Guy Drut, IOC member {{and one of the}} <b>key</b> <b>members</b> of Paris's bid team, faced charges over alleged political party financial corruption.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 1968 season, the MCC's public position followed the advice of Douglas-Home: it was unknown whether or not South Africa would accept D'Oliveira and it would be better not to press the issue. Even so, three <b>key</b> <b>members</b> of the MCC were aware of the reality of the situation. Vorster had avoided international condemnation as he had not publicly declared D'Oliveira unacceptable, but his stand had been clearly conveyed to London in private.|$|E
5|$|The British {{policy as}} stated in the {{declaration}} was to face numerous challenges to its implementation in the following years. The first of these was the indirect peace negotiations which took place between Britain and the Ottomans in December 1917 and January 1918 during a pause in the hostilities for the rainy season; although these peace talks were unsuccessful, archival records suggest that <b>key</b> <b>members</b> of the War Cabinet may have been willing to permit leaving Palestine under nominal Turkish sovereignty as part of an overall deal.|$|E

5|$|The assassins, the <b>key</b> <b>members</b> of the clandestine network, {{and the key}} Serbian {{military}} conspirators {{who were}} still alive were arrested, tried, convicted and punished. Those who were arrested in Bosnia were tried in Sarajevo in October 1914. The other conspirators were arrested and tried before a Serbian court on the French-controlled Salonika Front in 1916–1917 on unrelated false charges; Serbia executed three of the top military conspirators. Much {{of what is known}} about the assassinations comes from these two trials and related records.|$|E
5|$|The open {{world was}} {{modelled}} on Southern California and Los Angeles, and its design and in-game render constituted {{much of the}} game's early work. <b>Key</b> <b>members</b> of the game world production team took field research trips throughout the region and documented their research with photo and video footage. Google Maps projections of Los Angeles were used by the team to help design Los Santos' road networks. To reflect and reproduce Los Angeles' demographic spread, the developers studied census data and watched documentaries about the city. The team considered creating the open world the most technically demanding aspect of the game's production.|$|E
5|$|At Sony Music Entertainment, Kutaragi {{worked closely}} with Shigeo Maruyama, the CEO of Sony Music, and with Akira Sato to form Sony Computer Entertainment Inc. (SCEI) on November 16, 1993. A {{building}} block of SCEI was its initial partnership with Sony Music which helped SCEI attract creative talent to the company as well as assist SCEI in manufacturing, marketing and producing discs, something that Sony Music had been doing with Music Discs. The final two <b>key</b> <b>members</b> of SCEI were Terry Tokunaka, the President of SCEI from Sony's headquarters, and Olaf Olafsson. Olafsson was CEO and president of New York-based Sony Interactive Entertainment which was the mother company for the 1994-founded Sony Computer Entertainment of America (SCEA).|$|E

5|$|Despite the RIRA's renewed activity, the {{organisation}} was {{weakened by the}} arrest of <b>key</b> <b>members</b> and continued infiltration by informers. McKevitt was arrested on 29 March 2001 and charged with membership of an illegal organisation and directing terrorism, and remanded into custody. In July 2001, following the arrests of McKevitt and other RIRA members, British and Irish government sources hinted that {{the organisation}} was now in disarray. Other key figures were jailed, including the RIRA's Director of Operations, Liam Campbell, {{who was convicted of}} membership of an illegal organisation, and Colm Murphy who was convicted of conspiring to cause the Omagh bombing, although this conviction was overturned on appeal.|$|E
5|$|Development for Mulan {{began in}} 1994, after the {{production}} team sent {{a select group}} of artistic supervisors to China for three weeks to take photographs and drawings of local landmarks for inspiration; and to soak up local culture. <b>Key</b> <b>members</b> of the creative team at the time – Pam Coats, Barry Cook, Ric Sluiter, Robert Walker, and Mark Henn – were invited to travel to China as a research trip to study the landscape, people, and history of the original legend. From June 17 to July 2, 1994, the research trip flew to Beijing, China, which is where Pam Coats became inspired by the placement of flags on the Great Wall, Datong, Luoyang, Xi'an, Jiayuguan, Dunhuang, and Guilin.|$|E
5|$|In 1867 the Fenians were {{preparing}} to launch an armed uprising against British rule, but their plans became known to the authorities, and several <b>key</b> <b>members</b> of the movement's leadership were arrested and convicted. Two succeeded in evading the police, Thomas J. Kelly and Timothy Deasy, and travelled from Ireland to Britain to reorganise and raise {{the morale of the}} Fenian groups there {{in the wake of the}} failed uprising. Both were Irish Americans who had fought with distinction in the American Civil War– Kelly achieving the rank of colonel and Deasy that of captain– and both had played important roles in the abortive uprising; Kelly had been declared the chief executive of the Irish Republic at a secret republican convention, and Deasy commanded a Fenian brigade in County Cork.|$|E

5|$|In September 1949, Mirta {{gave birth}} to a son, Fidelito, so the couple moved to a larger Havana flat. Castro {{continued}} to put himself at risk, staying active in the city's politics and joining the September 30 Movement, which contained within it both communists and members of the Partido Ortodoxo. The group's purpose was to oppose the influence of the violent gangs within the university; despite his promises, Prío had failed to control the situation, instead offering many of their senior members jobs in government ministries. Castro volunteered to deliver a speech for the Movement on November 13, exposing the government's secret deals with the gangs and identifying <b>key</b> <b>members.</b> Attracting the attention of the national press, the speech angered the gangs, and Castro fled into hiding, first in the countryside and then in the U.S. Returning to Havana several weeks later, Castro lay low and focused on his university studies, graduating as a Doctor of Law in September 1950.|$|E
5|$|Krueger {{took with}} him several <b>key</b> <b>members</b> of the Third Army staff, {{including}} Brigadier General George Honnen {{as chief of}} staff, Colonel George H. Decker as deputy chief of staff, Colonel George S. Price as assistant chief of staff, G-1 (Personnel), Colonel Horton V. White as assistant chief of staff, G-2 (intelligence), Clyde Eddleman as assistant chief of staff, G-3 (operations) and Colonel Kenneth Pierce as assistant chief of staff, G-4 (supply). Honnen had health problems, and spent much of April, May and June 1943 in hospital before being ordered home on 18 June. He was replaced by Brigadier General Edwin D. Patrick, who had served {{on the staff of}} Admiral William F. Halsey in the South Pacific Area. Patrick did not get along smoothly with Krueger or the rest of the Sixth Army staff, and in May 1944 Patrick was appointed to command the 158th Regimental Combat Team, and Decker became chief of staff.|$|E
5|$|The Kentish rebels had {{assembled}} a wide-ranging {{list of people}} whom they wanted the King to hand over for execution. It included national figures, such as John of Gaunt, Archbishop Sudbury and Hales; other <b>key</b> <b>members</b> of the royal council; officials, such as Belknap and Bampton who had intervened in Kent; and other hated members of the wider royal circle. When they reached the Marshalsea Prison in Southwark, they tore it apart. By now the Kent and Essex rebels had been joined by many rebellious Londoners. The Fleet and Newgate Prisons were attacked by the crowds, and the rebels also targeted houses belonging to Flemish immigrants.|$|E

5|$|The year of 1964 {{marked a}} decisive {{turning point in}} the Vietnam War. Following the ousting of President Ngô Đình Diệm in 1963, South Vietnam's top army generals {{continued}} to vie with each other for control of the country’s military-dominated government instead of combating the emerging forces of the National Liberation Front, also known as the Viet Cong. The fragility of the South Vietnamese government was reflected on the battlefield, where its military experienced great setbacks against the Viet Cong. Taking advantage of Saigon's political instability, Communist leaders in Hanoi began preparing for war. Even though <b>key</b> <b>members</b> of North Vietnam's Politburo disagreed on the best strategy to reunite their country, they ultimately went ahead to prepare for armed struggle against South Vietnam and their American supporters.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 1950s, Soedjatmoko and President Sukarno, {{with whom}} he had had a warm working relationship, had a falling out over the president's {{increasingly}} authoritarian policies. In 1960 Soedjatmoko co-founded and headed the Democratic League, which attempted to promote democracy in the country; he also opposed Sukarno's Guided Democracy policy. When the effort failed, Soedjatmoko went to the US and took a position as guest lecturer at Cornell University. When he returned to Indonesia in 1962, he discovered that <b>key</b> <b>members</b> of the PSI had been arrested and the party banned; both Siasat and Pedoman were closed. To avoid trouble with the government, Soedjatmoko voluntarily left himself unemployed until 1965, when he became co-editor of An Introduction to Indonesian Historiography.|$|E
5|$|When Eisenhower was {{appointed}} Supreme Allied Commander in December 1943, he naturally wished to take <b>key</b> <b>members</b> of his AFHQ staff, including Strong, {{with him to}} his new assignment. On New Year's Eve, Smith met with Alan Brooke, now Chief of the Imperial General Staff, to discuss the transfer of key British staff from AFHQ to Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF). Brooke made some concessions but refused to transfer Strong, who he believed could not be spared from the Mediterranean. A heated exchange resulted, with Smith demanding Brooke explain how Operation Overlord could be a success if the British Army withheld its best talent. Later Brooke complained to Eisenhower about Smith's behaviour. Accordingly, another AFHQ hand, Brigadier John Whiteley, became G-2 at SHAEF. However Eisenhower and Smith eventually had their way, going over Brooke's head to Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and Strong assumed the post on 25 May 1944, with Brigadier General Thomas J. Betts as his deputy.|$|E

5|$|When {{development}} {{began in}} December 2007, the studio had employed five full-time team members. Development took eight weeks, though {{creation of the}} Velociraptor and jeep models had already been started before development began. Other staff {{were working on the}} title before then, but two <b>key</b> <b>members</b> were involved in the Independent Games Festival. A teaser trailer was released on January 18, 2008; quickly garnering interest from gaming blogs such as Kotaku and Destructoid. In an interview the developers hinted that a non-free downloadable version with extra content may be produced, or that advertisements may be introduced to the site. The company also revealed plans to continue developing free games with a development time of four to eight weeks. The most popular of these games will be further developed and released on platforms such as WiiWare, PlayStation Network or Xbox Live Arcade.|$|E
5|$|In December 1943, Eisenhower was {{appointed}} Supreme Allied Commander for Operation Overlord, {{the invasion of}} Normandy. Eisenhower wished to take Smith and other <b>key</b> <b>members</b> of his AFHQ staff with him to his new assignment, but Prime Minister Winston Churchill wanted to retain Smith at AFHQ as Deputy Supreme Commander in the Mediterranean. Churchill reluctantly gave way at Eisenhower's insistence. On New Year's Eve, Smith met with General (one day later Field Marshal) Sir Alan Brooke to discuss the transfer of key British staff members from AFHQ to Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF). Brooke released Gale only after a strong appeal from Smith, but refused to transfer Strong. A heated exchange resulted, and Brooke later complained to Eisenhower about Smith's behavior. This {{was the only time}} that a senior British officer ever complained openly about Smith. Whiteley became Chief of Intelligence (G-2) at SHAEF instead of Strong, but Eisenhower and Smith had their way in the long run, and Strong assumed the post on 25 May 1944, with Brigadier General Thomas J. Betts as his deputy.|$|E
5|$|PlatinumGames {{was founded}} by the merger of Seeds Inc. and Odd Ltd. in October 2007. Seeds Inc. had been founded by Shinji Mikami, Atsushi Inaba, and Hideki Kamiya on August 1, 2006. Prior to {{establishing}} the company, the three worked for Capcom, and were <b>key</b> <b>members</b> of the Osaka-based Clover Studio, which specialized in making new and creative intellectual properties. They worked closely together developing popular Capcom franchises including: Resident Evil, Devil May Cry, Viewtiful Joe and Ōkami. Most of these titles received critical acclaim, but under-performed commercially, leading to Capcom's decision to close the studio. Prior to the closure, the three founders had already left the studio to form their own company in mid-2006. In January 2006, the company expanded to 51 employees, including more former Capcom employees such as Masami Ueda, composer for the early Resident Evil games, and Mari Shimazaki, Ōkamis artist. Yusuke Hashimoto and Kenji Saito, who would eventually become PlatinumGames' directors, also joined during its establishment period. The new company revealed its existence by launching its website in February 2007.|$|E
