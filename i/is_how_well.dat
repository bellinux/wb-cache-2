25|$|Although the {{popularity}} of Mathieu's genre has suffered, given the domination {{of rock and roll}} and the global lack of interest in non-English popular music during her most profitable years, she remained a popular artist in France and Europe. Many thousands of fans have met her before and after performances for autographs and well wishes over the years, and the common refrain <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>well</b> she treats her fans. She easily interacts with the public. While the Mathieu sisters are quite wealthy, they have also made their songwriters extremely wealthy. Most of the record profits go to the authors, whereas Mireille had to tour and perform concerts live and on television.|$|E
25|$|Temporal performance: the {{temporal}} resolution of an LCD <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>well</b> it can display changing images, or the accuracy {{and the number}} of times per second the display draws the data it is being given. LCD pixels do not flash on/off between frames, so LCD monitors exhibit no refresh-induced flicker no matter how low the refresh rate. But a lower refresh rate can mean visual artefacts like ghosting or smearing, especially with fast moving images. Individual pixel response time is also important, as all displays have some inherent latency in displaying an image which can be large enough to create visual artifacts if the displayed image changes rapidly.|$|E
