It {{is used in the}} manufacture of jelly beans [...] and gummy bears, [...] and was formerly used in the manufacture of marshmallows before the advent of the extrusion process. The starch mogul system uses a machine with trays of starch. Each tray has a mold firmly pushed down in it to create cavities in the starch. The cavities are then filled with the candy material, and allowed to cool or harden as necessary. During this time, the starch helps absorb excess water, making the candy moldings <b>handleable.</b> Finally, the trays are dumped and the candy is separated from the starch, which is then reused by the machine.|$|E

Hybrids acted {{both as a}} semiaquatic predator like the European mink, and as a more terrestrial predator, like the polecat. They changed feeding habits between being a generalist predator basing its diet on amphibians, small rodents and birds (like the polecat) to being a frog eater similar to the European mink. Even in daily activity hybrids were intermediate between the two hybridized species. Vadim E. Sidorovich, of the IUCN/SSC Mustelid, Viverrid & Procyonid Specialist Group In {{some parts of the}} British Isles, the abandoning of domestic ferrets has led to ferret-polecat crossbreeds living in the wild. Ferrets were likely first brought to Britain after the Norman Conquest of England, or as late as the fourteenth century. It is currently impossible to distinguish pure polecats from hybrids through DNA analysis, as the two forms are too closely related and intermixed to be separated through modern genetic methods. Crossbreeds between the two animals typically have a distinct white throat patch, white feet and white hairs interspersed among the fur. Typically, first generation crossbreeds between polecats and ferrets develop their wild parents' fear of humans if left with their mothers during the critical socialisation period between 7½ and 8½ weeks of age. Occasionally, supposed ferret-polecat crossbreeds are advertised as superior to pure ferrets for the purposes of rabbiting, though actual crossbreeds are very likely to be less <b>handleable,</b> less willing to familiarise themselves with dogs, {{and are more likely to}} kill their quarry outright rather than simply flush it from its burrow.|$|E

Our results showed that both polyamines decreased the negative zeta potential of all samples under pH 8. 0 as a consequence of their ionic interaction with proteins. At the same time, they enhanced the dimension of nanoparticles under pH 8. 0 as a result of macromolecular aggregations. By using native protein solutions, <b>handleable</b> films were obtained only from samples containing either a minimum of 33 mM glycerol or 4 mM spermidine, or both compounds together at lower glycerol concentrations. However, 2 mM spermidine was sufficient to obtain <b>handleable</b> film by using heat-treated samples without glycerol. Conversely, brittle materials were obtained by spermine alone, thus indicating that only spermidine was able to act as an ionic plasticizer. Lastly, both polyamines, mainly spermine, were found able to act as “glycerol-like” plasticizers at concentrations higher than 5 mM under experimental conditions at which their amino groups are undissociated.

The fibres were characterised by various techniques.

40|$|We {{support the}} use of Haskell in two classes of applications. First, we note that {{although}} Haskell is well-suited for stream-oriented applications, like reactive systems, most implementations lack tools for locating subtle errors like deadlocks. To {{support the use}} of Haskell in such applications, we have designed and implemented a debugger with an intuitive graphical interface. The debugger simplifies the task of locating deadlocks by providing users with a mostly declarative view of programs as systems of recursive equations over streams. Second, we investigate the use of Haskell in the implementation of the debugger. As expected, this effort requires a variant of Haskell, currently used in the intermediate phases of Haskell compilers, that combines call-by-need semantics with computational effects. To support robust programming in this system-oriented variant, we formalize the semantics of <b>handleable</b> exceptions in a call-by-need language. 1 Streams and Deadlocks As Kahn showed in [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Contemporary {{computer}} {{theory is}} governed by the discretization of continuous problems. Classical Turing machines (TMs) are originally built to solve computation and computability problems, which main feature is discreteness. However, even some simple numerical calculations problems, e. g., iterations in Rn, generate difficulties to be described or solved by constructing a TM. This paper explores the computability of continuous problems by proposing a class of continuous Turing machines (CTMs) that are an extension of TMs. CTMs {{can be applied to}} the standard for the precision of algorithms. First, computable real numbers are precisely defined by CTMs and their computations are regarded as the running of the CTMs. CTMs introduce the coded recursive descriptions, machine states, and operations with the characters of computer instructions in essence compared with usual computable continuous models. Hence, they can precisely present continuous computations with the form of processes. Second, the concepts of CTM computable and CTM <b>handleable</b> are proposed. Moreover, the basic concepts on approximation theory such as convergency, metric space, and fixed-point in Rn are defined in a new space CTMRn. Finally, an iterative algorithm is shown by constructing a CTM to solve linear equations...|$|E
40|$|We firstly {{introduce}} a facile method for the site-specific direct physical exfoliation of few-layer graphene sheets from cheap and easily enlargeable graphite grown on a Ni foil using an optimized polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamp. By decreasing the PDMS cross-linking time, the PDMS elasticity {{is reduced to}} ~ 52 kPa, {{similar to that of}} a typical gel. As a result of this process, the PDMS becomes more flexible yet remains in a <b>handleable</b> state as a stamp. Furthermore, the PDMS adhesion to a graphite/Ni surface, as measured by the peel strength, increases to ~ 5. 1 N/m, which is approximately 17 times greater than that of typical PDMS. These optimized properties allow the PDMS stamp to have improved contact with the graphite/Ni surface, including the graphite wrinkles. This process is verified, and changes in surface morphology are observed using a 3 D laser scanning microscope. Under conformal contact, the optimized PDMS stamp demonstrates the site-specific direct physical exfoliation of few-layer graphene sheets including mono- and bi-layer graphene sheets from the graphite/Ni substrate without the use of special equipment, conditions or chemicals. The number of layers of the exfoliated graphene and its high quality are revealed by the measured Raman spectra. The exfoliation method using tunable elasticity and adhesion of the PDMS stamp can be used not only for cost effective mass production of defect-less few-layer graphene from th...|$|E
40|$|The {{international}} climate {{policy is}} in big trouble. The {{governments of the}} world cannot agree on a reasonable, enforceable cap on global CO 2 emissions – not today {{and not in the}} future. Concerning a strict enough cap, this issue is politically not <b>handleable</b> today, because this would directly interfere with the options of countries to generate future economic growth. Problems in this respect are politically unfeasible. The present text, therefore, argues for a new approach, for thinking out of the box, for overcoming the traps the negotiations are stuck in at the moment. The idea is to have governments agreeing only on a relaxed instead of a strict cap. This is politically much easier to achieve. In the text, we show that a relaxed cap is sufficient to solve the climate issue, if the private sector can be motivated to do the rest, given that there is an enforceable relaxed cap in place. The private sector can use at least two wild cards to contribute to this aim, and it can do this within the framework of climate neutrality for companies, organizations, and individuals to take legal CO 2 certificates out of order on the one hand, and, on the other hand, to plant trees (all over the world for the purpose of biological sequestration) and to do this in huge volumes...|$|E

Transplantation of cultured human limbal epithelial cells (hLE) on human amniotic membrane (HAM) can restore vision but clinical graft manufacture can be unreliable. We {{have developed a}} reliable and robust tissue equivalent (TE) alternative to HAM, Real Architecture for 3 D Tissue (RAFT). Here, we aimed to optimize the optical and mechanical properties of RAFT TE for treatment of LESC deficiency in clinical application. The RAFT TE protocol is tunable; varying collagen concentration and volume produces differing RAFT TEs. These were compared with HAM samples taken from locations proximal and distal to the placental disc. Outcomes assessed were transparency, thickness, light transmission, tensile strength, ease of handling, degradation rates and suitability as substrate for hLE culture. Proximal HAM samples were thicker and stronger with poorer optical properties than distal HAM samples. RAFT TEs produced using higher amounts of collagen were thicker and stronger with poorer optical properties than those produced using lower amounts of collagen. The ‘optimal’ RAFT TE was thin, transparent but still <b>handleable</b> and was produced using 0. 6 ml of 3 mg/ml collagen. Degradation rates of the ‘optimal’ RAFT TE and HAM were similar. hLE achieved confluency on ‘optimal’ RAFT TEs at comparable rates to HAM and cells expressed high levels of putative stem cell marker p 63 α.

The definitive version is available at: [URL] collected at monitored points around the Internet contain representative performance information about the paths their probes traverse. Basic measurement attributes, such as delay and loss, are easy to collect and provide a means to both build and validate empirical performance models. However, the task of analysis and extracting performance conclusions from measurements remains challenging. Ideally, performance modelling aims to find a set of self-contained parameters to describe, summarise, profile and easy display network performance status at a time. This can result in the provision of meaningful information to address applications in fault and performance management, hence providing input to network provisioning, traffic engineering and performance prediction. In this work we present the Weibull Mixture Model, a method to characterise endto- end network delay measurements within a few simple, accurate, representative and <b>handleable</b> parameters using a finite combination of Weibull distributions, with all the aforementioned benefits. The model parameters are related tomeaningful delay characteristics, such as average peak and tail behaviour in a daily profile, and can be optimally found using an iterative algorithm known as Expectation Maximisation. Studies on such parameter evolution can reflect current workload status and all possible network events impacting packet dynamics, with further applications in network management. In addition, a self-sufficient procedure to implement the Weibull Mixture Model is presented, along with a set of matching examples to real GPS synchronised measurements taken across the Internet, donated by RIPE NCC...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to develop two {{structure}} theorems for vector valued Siegel modular forms for Igusa’s subgroup Γ_ 2 [2, 4], the multiplier system induced by the theta constants and the symmetric square of the standard representation Sym^ 2 : GL(2,C) → Sym^ 2 (C^ 2). The thesis rests on the well-known fact that every holomorphic tensor on the upper half-space H_ 2 that is invariant under Γ_ 2 [2, 4] is associated to a vector valued modular form. We define a space of meromorphic tensors that are holomorphic outside a divisor and become holomorphic after a pullback along certain covering maps. Afterwards, we show that Γ_ 2 [2, 4]-invariant tensors on H_ 2 correspond to this particular space of tensors on the quotient space Γ_ 2 [2, 4] H_ 2 with poles along the ramification divisor. As an immediate consequence of a theorem by Runge, Γ_ 2 [2, 4] H_ 2 is embedded into the projective space P^ 3 C and its complement is an analytic set of codimension 2. The ramification divisor is given by 10 simple quadrics. Therefore, we shall describe the aforementioned modular forms with weights in 3 Z or 1 + 3 Z as rational tensors. The tensors with weights in 6 Z or 1 + 6 Z possess easily <b>handleable</b> poles along the 10 quadrics. It can be shown that these modular forms are contained in the module generated by the Rankin-Cohen brackets of the four theta series of the second kind. We extend this result to arbitrary weights by a simple argument from algebraic geometry...|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} a new simple game, which {{is referred to as}} the complementary weighted multiple majority game (C-WMMG for short). C-WMMG models a basic cooperation rule, the complementary cooperation rule, and can be taken as a sister model of the famous weighted majority game (WMG for short). In this paper, we concentrate on the two dimensional C-WMMG. An interesting property of this case is that there are at most n+ 1 minimal winning coalitions (MWC for short), and they can be enumerated in time O(n n), where n is the number of players. This property guarantees that the two dimensional C-WMMG is more <b>handleable</b> than WMG. In particular, we prove that the main power indices, i. e. the Shapley-Shubik index, the Penrose-Banzhaf index, the Holler-Packel index, and the Deegan-Packel index, are all polynomially computable. To make a comparison with WMG, we know that it may have exponentially many MWCs, and none of the four power indices is polynomially computable (unless P=NP). Still for the two dimensional case, we show that local monotonicity holds for all of the four power indices. In WMG, this property is possessed by the Shapley-Shubik index and the Penrose-Banzhaf index, but not by the Holler-Packel index or the Deegan-Packel index. Since our model fits very well the cooperation and competition in team sports, we hope that it can be potentially applied in measuring the values of players in team sports, say help people give more objective ranking of NBA players and select MVPs, and consequently bring new insights into contest theory and the more general field of sports economics. It may also provide some interesting enlightenments into the design of non-additive voting mechanisms. Last but not least, the threshold version of C-WMMG is a generalization of WMG, and natural variants of it are closely related with the famous airport game and the stable marriage/roommates problem.

40|$|This thesis explores {{shared data}} in list {{structures}} and ambiguity in language processing. Tolerance of ambiguity {{is necessary to}} support clear and modular expression. Data sharing is necessary to support ambiguity efficiently. Data sharing is useful also in compiled programs to save memory and time. Let us define some terms. A rewrite grammar {{is a set of}} replacement rules each of which specifies that a given phrase may be replaced by another given phrase. Each replacement rule expresses a local translation. A parser finds those sequences of replacements that bring a given text to a machine <b>handleable</b> form. Each such sequence represents a meaning or interpretation for the given text. Tolerance of ambiguity or multiple interpretations for a given text is necessary so that subsequent processing can place further constraints upon the input text. This thesis presents a parser which efficiently, handles general-rewrite grammars. To conserve computer time and memory, only essential differences among multiple interpretations are represented and processed. If several interpretations for a given text are valid, the parser yields a meaning which represents the ambiguity as, locally as possible. Even an exponential number of distinct meanings may be represented in a polynomial amount of memory. This thesis also presents a language processing system which supports semantic processing via independent rewrite grammars. Each grammar represents a distinct aspect of the language. A given sequence of grammars becomes a sequence of passes, or process steps. Each pass derives a meaning with respect to one grammar and uses that meaning to generate phrases which will be interpreted by the next pass. Although linguistic specification is usually done with context-free grammars, features of this parser which support general-rewrite grammars are essential for the integration of passes. Not only ambiguity, but also the locality of ambiguity is preserved from one pass to the next. It is necessary to preserve locality of ambiguity in order to avoid explosive computation arising from useless action among independent sets of interpretations. I have implemented a general-purpose programming language called ICL with this system. The fact that ICL's datatypes are processed by a rewrite grammar makes it simple to implement both user-defined datatype coercions and functions known as polymorphic operators whose definitions depend on parameter datatypes. Datatype coercions and Polymorphic operators reduce the amount,of specification required in algorithms {{to such an extent that}} a user can often modify declarations and achieve optimizations and changes in concept without modifying his algorithmic specification. ICL includes a simple and safe policy about pointers so that the user can ignore their existence completely if he wishes. ICL automatically maximizes data sharing and minimizes copying by adopting a "copy on write" policy. This policy supports the illusion that each and every reference to a data structure generates a complete copy of that data structure. This same technique is used in the language processor itself to facilitate data sharing among multiple interpretations in ambiguous cases...|$|E
