The activated sludge system depends on the activities of microbial communitiespresent in the sludge. However, exact knowledge of the microbial community structure in waste watertreatment plants is limited. In this study, the bacterial diversity of activated sludge was investigated inthe two waste water treatment plants by using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of PCRamplified 16 S ribosomal DNA fragments. Dominant bands from DGGE profiles were excised andsubjected to sequencing to identify the dominant genotypes. Sequence analysis gave insights into theidentities of the predominant bacterial populations present. The DNA sequencing results indicated themicrobial diversity, revealing that the dominant bacteria present in Bramhapuri waste water treatmentplant is Acinetobacter sp. whereas the dominant bacteria in Pratapnagar (Delawas) waste watertreatment plant is Alpha-proteobacteria. Futhermore, cluster analysis of the DGGE profiles indicatedsignificant diversity in the bacterial community by depicting two distinct clusters for each waste watertreatment plant.

40|$|Nimesulide is a non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} {{drug that}} acts through selective inhibition of COX- 2 enzyme. Poor bioavailability of this drug may leads to local toxicity {{at the site of}} aggregation and hinders reaching desired therapeutic effects. This study aimed at formulating and optimizing topically applied lotions of nimesulide using an experimental design approach, namely response surface methodology. The formulated lotions were evaluated for pH, viscosity, spreadability, homogeneity and in vitro permeation studies through rabbit skin using Franz diffusion cells. Data were fitted to linear, quadratic and cubic models and best fit model was selected to investigate the influence of permeation enhancers, namely propylene glycol and polyethylene glycol on percutaneous absorption of nimesulide from lotion formulations. The best fit quadratic model explained that the enhancer combination at equal levels significantly increased the flux and permeability coefficient. The model was validated by comparing the permeation profile of optimized formulations’ predicted and experimental response values, thus, <b>endorsing</b> <b>the</b> prognostic <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> response surface methodology...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of celebrity}} athletes as {{endorsers}} {{has become a}} popular marketing strategy. Celebrity athletes are often used to endorse products because it is believed they positively impact brand attitudes (Friedman 2 ̆ 6 Friedman, 1979; Kamins, et. al., 1989; Till, Stanley, Priluck, 2008) and fostering brand loyalty (Bush, et. al., 2004). In addition, celebrity athletes are used to help a company differentiate their products and build instant name recognition (Henriks, 1996). This dissertation explored factors associated with celebrity <b>endorser</b> effectiveness. <b>The</b> conceptual framework {{for this study was}} grounded by the Source Credibility Model (Hovland, Janis, 2 ̆ 6 Kelley, 1953; Hovland 2 ̆ 6 Weiss, 1951; McGuire, 1968) and the Source Attractiveness Model (McGuire, 1985). The two models consist of the factors: trustworthiness, attractiveness, expertise, similarity, familiarity, and likability. The six factors were analyzed {{to gain a better understanding}} of <b>the</b> construct celebrity <b>endorser</b> effectiveness or <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> an <b>endorser</b> to produce a strong positive impression. The purpose of this study was to create a valid and reliable measuring tool, based on the six factors included in the source credibility and source attractiveness models, to assess celebrity athlete <b>endorser</b> effectiveness. <b>The</b> specific research questions were; 1) What factors (i. e., expertise, trustworthiness, attractiveness, similarity, likability, familiarity) contribute to celebrity athlete endorser effectiveness? 2) Does a respondent 2 ̆ 7 s gender affect the perceived effectiveness of a celebrity athlete <b>endorser?</b> 3) Does <b>the</b> celebrity athlete <b>endorser</b> 2 ̆ 7 s gender affect his/her perceived effectiveness? The study was conducted through the use of an online survey. An undergraduate student sample (n= 813) viewed hypothetical advertisements of two celebrity athlete endorsers and answered a 36 -item survey with questions pertaining to the factors associated with the Source Credibility and Source Attractiveness Models. An exploratory factor analysis uncovered three factors impacting celebrity athlete endorser effectiveness. Two of the factors were contained previously by the Source Credibility and Source Attractiveness Models, attractiveness and familiarity while a newly forged factor, compatibility was also uncovered. The new factor compatibility, comprised of the factors similarity and expertise, is the strength of the perceived relationship between consumer and <b>the</b> celebrity athlete <b>endorser.</b> <b>The</b> study also resulted in the development of the 11 -item Athlete Endorser Effectiveness Scale which will provide a simple and comprehensive evaluation tool for sport marketers and academics to further research on <b>the</b> celebrity athlete <b>endorser</b> phenomenon...|$|R

The research was carried out at elementary schools in Gugus Yudistira Selogiri Wonogiri, from January to June 2009. The research method used was descriptive of correlational. The population of the research were the elementary school students in Gugus Yudistira Selogiri Wonogiri. The sample consisted of 120 students who were taken by using simple random sampling. The instruments used for data collection were: test for <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> reading comprehension, test for <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> short story appreciation; and questionary for language attitude. The technique used for analyzing the data was the statistical technique of regression and correlation.

40|$|International audienceThe {{interferon}} alpha (IFN-α) -inducible restriction factor MxB blocks HIV- 1 infection after {{reverse transcription}} but prior to integration. Fate-of-capsid experiments have correlated <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> MxB to block HIV- 1 infection with stabilization of viral cores during infection. We previously demonstrated that HIV- 1 restriction by MxB requires capsid binding and oligomerization. Deletion and gain-of-function experiments have mapped the HIV- 1 restriction <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> MxB to its N-terminal 25 amino acids. This report {{reveals that the}} N-terminal 25 amino acids of MxB exhibit two separate functions: (i) <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> MxB to bind to HIV- 1 capsid and (ii) the nuclear localization signal of MxB, which is important for <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> MxB to shuttle into the nucleus. To understand whether MxB restriction of HIV- 1 requires capsid binding and/or nuclear localization, we genetically separated these two functions and evaluated their contributions to restriction. Our experiments demonstrated that the (11) RRR(13) motif is important for <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> MxB to bind capsid and to restrict HIV- 1 infection. These experiments suggested that capsid binding is necessary for <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> MxB to block HIV- 1 infection. Separately from the capsid binding function of MxB, we found that residues (20) KY(21) regulate <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> N-terminal 25 amino acids of MxB {{to function as a}} nuclear localization signal; however, <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> N-terminal 25 amino acids to function as a nuclear localization signal was not required for restriction. IMPORTANCE MxB/Mx 2 blocks HIV- 1 infection in cells from the immune system. MxB blocks infection by preventing the uncoating process <b>of</b> HIV- 1. <b>The</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> MxB to block HIV- 1 infection requires that MxB binds to the HIV- 1 core by using its N-terminal domain. The present study shows that MxB uses residues (11) RRR(13) to bind to the HIV- 1 core during infection and that these residues are required for <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> MxB to block HIV- 1 infection. We also found that residues (20) KY(21) constitute a nuclear localization signal that is not required for <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> MxB to block HIV- 1 infection...|$|R
