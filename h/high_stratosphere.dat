The design of such a hypersonic airplane is based on the concept of integrating available technologies developed for aeronautical and space atmospheric re-entry systems. The vehicle, characterized by high aerodynamic efficiency and low wing loading, is able to provide aerodynamic stability and manoeuvrability along the flight path and to produce a reduced sonic boom during cruise and supersonic descent approach, ensuring a very limited environmental impact.

Aerodynamic and propulsive performances for the different flight regimes encountered during the missions are studied. Aerodynamic heating effects are analyzed, in order to identify suitable structures and materials design to sustain the hypersonic flight conditions.

The objective of this research was mainly to test the differentiating techniquesused by the various lidar teams involved in the NDSC for the calculation of the ozone numberdensity from the lidar signals. The exercise consisted of processing synthetic lidar signalscomputed from simple Rayleigh scattering and three initial ozone profiles. Two of these profilescontained perturbations in the low and the <b>high</b> <b>stratosphere</b> to test the vertical resolution of thevarious algorithms. For the unperturbed profiles the results of the simulations show thecorrect behavior of the lidar processing methods in the low and the middle stratosphere withbiases of less than 1 % with respect to the initial profile to as high as 30 km in most cases. In theupper stratosphere, significant biases reaching 10 % at 45 km for most of the algorithms areobtained. This bias is due to the decrease in the signal-to-noise ratio with altitude, which makes itnecessary to increase the number of points of the derivative low-pass filter used for dataprocessing. As a consequence the response of the various retrieval algorithms to perturbations inthe ozone profile is much better in the lower stratosphere than in the higher range.

However, the {{atmosphere of}} Titan also contains traces of oxygen compounds. The most abudant one detected is carbon monoxyde CO with a 47 ppmv concentration measured in <b>high</b> <b>stratosphere</b> [de Kok et al., 2007]. In this work we investigate the influence of CO on the N 2 -CH 4 reactivity. We simulate the whole reaction chains with a laboratory Radio Frequency Capacitively Coupled plasma discharge (RF CCP) gas mixture of nitrogen, methane and carbon monoxyde. In order to detect unambiguously the possible effects, CO is introduced with amounts of 0 - 1 - 2. 25 - 4. 5 %, larger than in Titan's atmosphere. The kinetics of the methane is monitored by mass spectrometry and the compositions of the gas phase and tholins are monitored by GC-MS and elemental analysis respectively. We find that CO modifies {{the composition of the}} gas phase with the detection of oxygenated compounds. CO decreases drastically the production efficiency of tholins, involving also a perturbation on the methane kinetics. The oxygen incorporation in tholins is found to be efficient. As a conclusion, we show that carbon monoxyde is effectively coupled with N 2 -CH 4 chemistry and that it impacts even the solid organic aerosols.

In addition, a similar comparison for the predecessor instrument GOME/ERS- 2 is described. The period of study is a whole year from May 2007 to April 2008. The results show that GOME- 2 /MetOp ozone data already has a very good quality, total ozone columns are on average 3. 05 % lower than Brewer measurements. This underestimation is higher than that obtained for GOME/ERS- 2 (1. 46 %). However, the relative differences between GOME- 2 /MetOp and Brewer measurements show significantly lower variability than the differences between GOME/ERS- 2 and Brewer data. Dependencies of these relative differences with respect to the satellite solar zenith angle (SZA), the satellite scan angle, the satellite cloud cover fraction (CF), and the ground-based total ozone measurements are analyzed. For both GOME instruments, differences show no significant dependence on SZA. However, GOME- 2 /MetOp data show a significant dependence on the satellite scan angle (+ 1. 5 %). In addition, GOME/ERS- 2 differences present a clear dependence with respect to the CF and ground-based total ozone; such differences are minimized for GOME- 2 /MetOp. The comparison between the daily total ozone values provided by both GOME instruments shows that GOME- 2 /MetOp ozone data are on average 1. 46 % lower than GOME/ERS- 2 data without any seasonal dependence.

40|$|International audienceStratospheric {{aerosols}} {{contribute to}} the terrestrial radiative budget during large eruptive events but also during volcanic quiescent periods (Kremser et al. 2016). The survey of background stratospheric aerosols, especially in the middle stratosphere, is challenging due to extreme experimental conditions and low particle concentration. Furthermore, during periods of low volcanic activity, origins and optical properties of aerosols {{in the middle and}} <b>high</b> <b>stratosphere</b> are not well defined yet (Neely et al. 2011). We propose to study the capabilities of a new miniature particle counter called LOAC (Light Optical Aerosol Counter), light enough to be carried under meteorological balloons, whichensure a very good frequency of flights and designed to be able to measure and discriminate between several main aerosol types. The LOAC miniature particle counter has been initially designed for balloon-borne tropospheric studies (Renard et al. 2016). Metrological performances of the LOAC instrument have been determined in the laboratory and during balloon flights. Principal limitations of the use of LOAC in the stratosphere areinduced by the temperature variations and the influence of cosmic rays. A detection threshold has been determined in the laboratory to be of 0. 8 particule. cm- 3 in terms of concentration which also limits the use of LOAC in the stratosphere where aerosol concentrations during volcanic quiescent periods may be lower than this limit. Since June 2013, more than 100 hundred LOAC instruments have been launched under meteorological balloons during the ChArMEx and Voltaire-LOAC field campaigns. This dataset has been studied and compared to satellite records such as OSIRIS, OMPS, and CALIOPbut also to ground-based lidar data (NDACC lidar OHP) and outputs from the WACCM/CARMA model. Results show that large variations in stratospheric aerosols are well defined by satellite but less visible in LOAC records. Instrumental LOAC limitations in the stratosphere can explain some of the difference between remote sensing methods and in-situ measurements but suggest also that local variations in the stratospheric aerosol contents may exist during volcanic quiescent periods. Flights made through the Calbucoplume in stratosphere during the summer 2015 show that LOAC can describe distribution in size and particle concentrations in a perturbed lower stratosphere.

Given this net mass flux and the cross tropopause diabatic mass flux, the residual adiabatic mass flux across the tropopause can also be estimated. These fluxes have been computed using meteorological fields from a free-running general circulation model (FVGCM) and two assimilation data sets, FVDAS, and UKMO. The data sets tend to agree that the annual average net mass flux for the Northern Hemisphere is about 1 P 10 kg/s. There is less agreement on the southern Hemisphere flux that might be half as large. For all three data sets, the adiabatic mass flux is computed to be from the upper troposphere into the lowermost stratosphere. This flux will dilute air entering from higher stratospheric altitudes. The mass fluxes are convolved with ozone mixing ratios from the Goddard 3 D CTM (which uses the FVGCM) to estimate the cross-tropopause transport of ozone. A relatively large adiabatic flux of tropospheric ozone from the tropical upper troposphere into the extratropical lowermost stratosphere dilutes the stratospheric air in the lowermost stratosphere. Thus, a significant fraction of any measured ozone STE may not be ozone produced in the <b>higher</b> <b>Stratosphere.</b> The results also illustrate that the annual cycle of ozone concentration in the lowermost stratosphere has as much of a role as the transport in the seasonal ozone flux cycle.

40|$|International audienceSaturn's axial tilt of 26. 7 ° {{produces}} {{seasons in}} a similar way as on Earth. Both the stratospheric temperature and composition are affected by this latitudinally varying insolation along Saturn's orbital path. The atmospheric thermal structure is controlled and regulated by the amount of hydrocarbons in the stratosphere, which act as absorbers and coolants from the UV to the far-IR spectral range, and this structure has an influence on the amount of hydrocarbons. We study here the feedback between the chemical composition and the thermal structure by coupling a latitudinal and seasonal photochemical model with a radiative seasonal model. Our results show that the seasonal temperature peak in the <b>higher</b> <b>stratosphere,</b> associated with the seasonal increase of insolation, is shifted earlier than the maximum insolation peak. This shift is increased with increasing latitudes and is caused by the low amount of stratospheric coolants in the spring season. At 80 ° in both hemispheres, the temperature peak at 10 - 2 mbar is seen to occur half a season (3 - 4 Earth years) earlier than was previously predicted by radiative seasonal models that assumed spatially and temporally uniform distribution of coolants. This shift progressively decreases with increasing pressure, up to around the 0. 5 mbar pressure level where it vanishes. On the opposite, the thermal field has a small feedback on the abundance distributions. Accounting for that feedback modifies the predicted equator-to-pole temperature gradient. The meridional gradients of temperature at the mbar pressure levels are better reproduced when this feedback is accounted for. At lower pressure levels, Saturn's stratospheric thermal structure seems to depart from pure radiative seasonal equilibrium as previously suggested by Guerlet et al. (2014). Although the agreement with the absolute value of the stratospheric temperature observed by Cassini is moderate, it is a mandatory step toward a fully coupled GCM-photochemical model...|$|R
40|$|Saturn's axial tilt {{produces}} {{seasons in}} a similar way as on Earth. Both the stratospheric temperature and composition are affected by this latitudinally varying insolation along the seasons. The thermal structure is controlled and regulated by the amount of hydrocarbons in the stratosphere, which act as absorbers and coolants from the UV to the far-IR spectral range, and this structure influences the amount of hydrocarbons. We study here the feedback between the chemical composition and the thermal structure by coupling a latitudinal and seasonal photochemical model with a radiative seasonal model. Our results show that the seasonal temperature peak in the <b>higher</b> <b>stratosphere,</b> associated with the seasonal increase of insolation, is shifted earlier than the maximum insolation peak. This shift is increased with increasing latitudes and is caused by the low amount of stratospheric coolants in the spring season. At 80 ^∘ in both hemispheres, the temperature peak at 1 d- 2 mbar is seen to occur half a season earlier than was previously predicted by radiative seasonal models that assumed spatially and temporally uniform distribution of coolants. This shift progressively decreases with increasing pressure, up to around the 0. 5 mbar pressure level where it vanishes. However, the thermal field has a small feedback on the abundance distributions. This feedback modifies the predicted equator-to-pole temperature gradient. The meridional gradients of temperature at the mbar pressure levels are better reproduced when this feedback is accounted for.

25|$|The Krakatoa {{eruption}} injected {{an unusually}} large amount of sulfur dioxide (SO2) gas <b>high</b> into the <b>stratosphere,</b> which was subsequently transported by high-level winds all over the planet. This led to a global increase in sulfuric acid (H2SO4) concentration in high-level cirrus clouds. The resulting increase in cloud reflectivity (or albedo) reflected more incoming light from the sun than usual, and cooled the entire planet until the suspended sulfur {{fell to the ground}} as acid precipitation.|$|R
