40|$|Recent {{evidence}} indicates that high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), an acute phase of an inflammatory marker, might be associated with atherosclerosis, hypertension, and other cardiovascular diseases. The present study was performed to assess the possible link between plasma hs-CRP and membrane fluidity (a reciprocal value of membrane microviscosity) in hypertensive <b>elderly</b> <b>men.</b> We measured the membrane fluidity of red blood cells (RBCs) in hypertensive and normotensive <b>elderly</b> <b>men</b> using an electron spin resonance and spin-labeling method. Membrane fluidity of RBCs was decreased in hypertensive <b>elderly</b> <b>men</b> compared with normotensive <b>elderly</b> <b>men.</b> Plasma hs-CRP levels were significantly higher in hypertensive <b>elderly</b> <b>men</b> than in normotensive <b>elderly</b> <b>men.</b> In contrast, plasma nitric-oxide- (NO-) metabolite levels were lower in hypertensive <b>elderly</b> <b>men</b> than in normotensive <b>elderly</b> <b>men.</b> The reduced membrane fluidity of RBCs was associated with increased plasma hs-CRP and decreased plasma NO-metabolite levels. In a multivariate regression analysis, plasma hs-CRP was an independent determinant of membrane fluidity of RBCs after adjustment for general risk factors.

To {{determine whether the}} seminiferous tubule defect in <b>elderly</b> <b>men</b> includes decreased Sertoli cell function, we measured serum immunoreactive inhibin concentrations in young and <b>elderly</b> <b>men</b> before and after clomiphene citrate (CC) administration. Thirty-eight healthy men, 19 young (aged 22 - 35 yr) and 19 elderly (aged 65 - 85 yr), were studied before CC administration. The mean baseline serum inhibin level was significantly lower (P less than 0. 001) in the <b>elderly</b> <b>men</b> than in the young men [416 +/- 22 (+/- SE) vs. 588 +/- 30 U/L], while serum immunoreactive FSH and LH levels {{were higher in the}} older men, and bioactive FSH levels were similar in the two age groups. Eleven young <b>men</b> and 13 <b>elderly</b> <b>men</b> were studied after 1 week of CC administration. The mean serum inhibin level increased by 71 %, from 566 +/- 36 to 970 +/- 82 U/L, in the young men, but it increased by only 24 %, from 421 +/- 26 to 520 +/- 38 U/L, in the <b>elderly</b> <b>men.</b> Serum immunoreactive LH and bioactive and immunoreactive FSH concentrations increased to similar levels in both groups after CC administration.

40|$|<b>Elderly</b> <b>men</b> {{with low}} {{testosterone}} (T) levels are increasingly diagnosed to have partial androgen deficiency {{of the aging}} male (PADAM). Frequently, magnetic resonance imaging is performed to exclude pituitary adenoma. The value of GnRH testing to differentiate PADAM from secondary hypogonadism is unknown. Serum levels of T as well as LH and FSH at baseline and after GnRH were evaluated in the following groups: 1) 24 <b>elderly</b> <b>men</b> with low serum T (11. 7 nmol/liter), 3) 10 men with primary hypogonadism, 4) 24 men with secondary hypogonadism, and 5) 13 healthy young volunteers. In <b>elderly</b> <b>men,</b> T levels were lower (P > 0. 001) and gonadotropin levels higher (P = 0. 03) compared with younger controls. LH and FSH response to GnRH was higher in <b>elderly</b> <b>men</b> with low T levels (PADAM) compared with <b>elderly</b> <b>men</b> with normal T levels (P = 0. 02 and P > 0. 001) {{in the presence of}} similar basal gonadotropin levels. To differentiate secondary hypogonadism from PADAM with a sensitivity of 100 %, a T less than 10 nmol/liter had a specificity of 50 %. This specificity was improved to 75 % by using a cutoff of {{less than or equal to}} 15 mU/liter increase of LH upon GnRH stimulation. Overall, decreased T levels and increased LH levels in <b>elderly</b> <b>men</b> suggest a primary Leydig cell dysfunction. In the subgroup of <b>elderly</b> <b>men</b> with low T levels, an increased LH response to GnRH with normal basal LH levels suggests additional, possibly hypothalamic changes.

5|$|The {{earthquake}} and its precursor tremor struck {{during the afternoon}} near an extremely populated area, with most buildings in the area already left in precarious conditions by previous earthquakes. It affected roughly 400,000 people directly, {{most of whom were}} estimated to have experienced at least strong (MM VI) shaking. Hospital officials confirmed at least 46 injuries after its occurrence; falling debris struck several people, while two others were left in critical condition. In the city centre, two workers had to be rescued from a collapsed church and were promptly hospitalised. The morning after, officials confirmed an <b>elderly</b> <b>man</b> had died after being knocked unconscious in a rest home when the earthquake struck.

40|$|This {{study of}} 40 elderly {{subjects}} (30 women and 10 men) {{between the ages}} of 70 to 90, attempts to qualify and quantify their voices and to compare the results with a young population and to establish any differences between the two sexes. The measurements concerned the Vital Capacity (VC), the Maximum Phonation Time (MPT) and the Phonation Quotient (PQ). The equivalent values for a young population were compiled from the literature. Spectral voice analysis was also included in the study. The mean speaking fundamental frequency (Fo) of the voice changes with age; it increases in men and decreases in women (158 Hz in <b>elderly</b> <b>men</b> vs a normal value of 120 Hz; 205 Hz in elderly women vs a normal value of 225 Hz). Ageing influences the vital capacity to the advantage of men (median VC = 2. 61 vs 1. 61 in <b>elderly</b> <b>men</b> and women, respectively). For sustaining a vowel a, the Maximum Phonation Time (MPT) is significantly better in <b>elderly</b> <b>men</b> (median MPT = 16 sec in <b>elderly</b> <b>men</b> and 12 sec for women). Phonation Quotient does not differ significantly between sexes (median PQ = 153 ml/sec in <b>elderly</b> <b>men</b> and 152 ml/sec in elderly women). Although, the physical capacity of elderly women decreases, their vocal output remains very good when compared to young women. In <b>elderly</b> <b>men,</b> however, there is a phonation quotient decrease of 25 per cent compared to young men. Peer reviewe...|$|R

Results Institutionalized men presented higher scores in physical and psychological domains of HRQL compared to <b>elderly</b> <b>men</b> living alone (p< 0. 05). Among women, the scores in all domains (physical, psychological, relationship, and environment) were similar between institutionalized and community-dwelling individuals.

5|$|However, in 1642 {{civil war}} broke out between the rival Royalist {{supporters}} of King Charles I and Parliament. Raglan Castle was still held by Henry, then an <b>elderly</b> <b>man,</b> supported by his son, Lord Herbert. Both men were firm royalists. King Charles sent his own son, Prince Charles, on a fund-raising tour of friendly regions, starting with Raglan Castle in October 1642, following which Henry was promoted {{to be the first}} Marquess of Worcester. Tensions grew in the immediate region, partially driven by religious tensions between some of the more Protestant local people and the Roman Catholic Marquess; on one of these occasions a local group attempted to search the castle, but were reportedly driven away by the sudden noise of Lord Herbert's steam-engine. The defences of Raglan were improved after this, with modern earthwork bastions built around the castle and a powder mill created; a garrison of around 300 men was established at a cost of £40,000. Heavier cannon were installed in the bastions, with lighter pieces placed in the castle towers.|$|E

Torrential rainfall up to 26.3in (668mm) created mudslides and landslides that {{damaged or destroyed}} numerous structures, bridges, and vehicles. Most of the island's plantain and banana crops were destroyed. Up to 14 people were killed. Farther west in Curaçao, Tomas led to the most prolific rain event in four decades. An <b>elderly</b> <b>man</b> was killed after suffering {{a heart attack and}} drowning in his flooded vehicle, while a rescue worker died after a hospital wall collapsed. In Haiti, already ravaged by a catastrophic 7.0 MW earthquake less than a year prior, heavy rainfall flooded a refugee camp and triggered mudslides that destroyed homes and roads.
