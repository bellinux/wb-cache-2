40|$|The {{condition}} {{known as}} <b>delta</b> <b>phalanx</b> (or longitudinally bracketed epiphysis) {{is a rare}} congenital anomaly first described In 1964. The deformity consists of a triangular bone with an epiphysis running along the shortened side of the phalanx In a proximal to distal direction, makIng longitudinal growth of the digit impossible. Isolated hallux varus congenitus due to a <b>delta</b> <b>phalanx</b> of the proximal phalanges of both great toes is extremely rare: {{there have been only}} three such cases reported, two of which were In one family-the only report of a familial occurrence of this deformity. This present report details the occurrence of isolated bilateral hailux varus congenitus In four members of one family, a father and his three eldest children. All three children show bilateral <b>delta</b> <b>phalanx</b> of the proximal phalanges of both great toes. There are associated thumb nail anomalies, but no suggestion of polydactylism. The condition known as <b>delta</b> <b>phalanx</b> or longitudinally bracketed epiphysis (Theander and Carstam 1974) was first described in 1964 by Blundell Jones, who reported five male patients with congenital angular deformity of the finger in which “the bone is triangular in shape an...|$|E

It is suggested that patients with a <b>delta</b> <b>phalanx</b> at the proximal phalangeal level should have a reversed wedge osteotomy early, while those with brachymesophalangism requiring surgery have a closing wedge osteotomy performed late. Delta phalanges in the triphalangeal thumb should be excised early and the joint reconstructed. An ulnar abduction deformity was noted in a minority of patients with clinodactyly. This deformity is relieved when the clinodactyly is corrected...|$|E

40|$|Angular {{deformity}} of {{the thumb}} {{is most often}} caused by a <b>delta</b> <b>phalanx</b> or a longitudinally bracheted diaphysis in a triphalangeal thumb. In some angled thumb, however, triangular-shaped secondary ossification center can cause the deformity, which can be called “abnormal triangular epiphysis ” of the thumb. A few clinicians have reported this entity, but they do that utilise this term instead clas-sifying class it as a subgroup of delta bone within a tri-phalangeal thumb. Classification (Figure 1) The classification {{of the types of}} angulatory deformity and the variants in ossification of the phalanges of the angled thumbs has not been presented concisely in the literature.

40|$|Congenital {{hallux varus}} {{is a rare}} {{condition}} in which the great toe is angled medially at the metatarsophalangeal joint. The varus deformity of the toe can vary in severity from only a few degrees {{to as much as}} 90 °. The cleft be-tween the great and second toe is usually larger than nor-mal. 1) Potential causes of the congenital hallux varus are multifactorial, including: thickened medial cords, medial slopes to the first metatarsocuneiform joints, first metatar-sal longitudinal epiphyseal bracket (LEB; <b>delta</b> <b>phalanx),</b> shortened block first metatarsals, space occupying extra metatarsals with the first web spaces and ineffective ab-ductor halluces and adductor hallucis insertions. 1 - 7) Surgical correction is generally recommended for Background: The {{purpose of this study was}} to report outcomes of congenital hallux varus deformity after surgical treatment.

40|$|Rubinstein-Taybi Syndrome {{is a rare}} {{condition}} affecting 1 : 125, 000 children. It {{is associated}} with short broad radially deviated thumbs, secondary to a delta proximal phalanx of the thumb. We undertook a retrospective review of seven children (13 thumbs) with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome whose thumbs were treated using a corrective osteotomy to the <b>delta</b> <b>phalanx</b> over a 13 year period. The types of osteotomy used in the series were reverse wedge osteotomy, opening wedge osteotomy and dome shaped osteotomy. The mean preoperative radial deviation of thumbs was 68 degrees (range 45 - 85 degrees). At follow up five of the 13 thumbs demonstrated some residual radial deviation. All recurrences occurred in the dome shaped osteotomy group. Our data suggest that surgery is effective in correcting the deformity, {{but there is a}} risk of incomplete correction or recurrence. Despite the recurrence the mean postoperative deformity was significantly better than preoperatively and the majority of patients families subjectively reported good function. No patient in our series has yet undergone further corrective surgery...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{management}} of triphalangism provides the age-old problem of marrying maximal functional benefit with acceptable cosmesis. The {{objective was to}} discuss the rare abnormality of bilateral triphalangeal thumb, the surgical existing surgical approaches, and to present a case in a pediatric patient who had a good result with a relatively simple and straightforward method of surgically managing the deformity. Method: We present {{the case of a}} 16 -year-old girl with isolated bilateral triphalangism of the thumbs. Her primary concern was the cosmetic deformity conferred by a delta middle phalanx, resulting in ulnar deviation of the thumb, in addition to the consequent reduced function of the thumb. Our approach to this problem was to perform a wedge osteotomy of the <b>delta</b> <b>phalanx</b> and a shave osteotomy of the articular surface of the distal phalanx, before using the Acutrak screw system to perform an arthrodesis. We present the first reported case in the literature. Results: This resulted in a near-anatomical correction of the deformity and consequent improvement of the cosmesis with a short anesthetic time, quick postoperative recovery, and very satisfied patient. Conclusion: We acknowledge that superior techniques exist; however, we also recognize that ever...|$|E
40|$|Malformations of {{the first}} ray of the foot vary widely and are divided into simple and complex. Complex malformations include {{abnormality}} of development {{of the first}} metatarsal or the main phalanx and refer to atypical adducted foot deformity. They are also characterized by varus location of the first ray of varying severity. The cause of deformation is a damage of longitudinal epiphyseal growth plate area of the first metatarsal - “longitudinal epiphyseal bracket” or the so-called <b>delta</b> <b>phalanx.</b> Over the past five years, we treated 37 patients (53 feet) aged from 6 months to 17 years old with developmental disabilities of the first ray of the foot. The spectrum of pathology is very diverse. In {{the majority of cases}} surgical treatment was multi-staged. It was revealed that the removal of deformity at the first stage of treatment should be complete, with maximum use of the bone to restore the length and shape of the affected bone. In treating combined deformities the good effect is guaranteed only with the removal of all the elements, including excision of the fibrous bridle along the inner surface of the first ray...|$|E
40|$|Desbuquois {{dysplasia}} is {{a severe}} condition characterized by short stature, joint laxity, scoliosis, and advanced carpal ossification with a <b>delta</b> <b>phalanx.</b> Studying nine Desbuquois families, we identified seven distinct mutations in the Calcium-Activated Nucleotidase 1 gene (CANT 1), which encodes a soluble UDP-preferring nucleotidase {{belonging to the}} apyrase family. Among the seven mutations, four were nonsense mutations (Del 5 ' UTR and exon 1, p. P 24 SRfsX 3, p. S 303 AfsX 20, and p. W 125 X), and three were missense mutations (p. R 300 C, p. R 300 H, and p. P 299 L) responsible for the change of conserved amino acids located in the seventh nucleotidase conserved region (NRC). The arginine substitution at position 300 was identified in five out of nine families. The specific function of CANT 1 is as yet unknown, but its substrates are involved in several major signaling functions, including Ca 2 + release, through activation of pyrimidinergic signaling. Importantly, using RT-PCR analysis, we observed a specific expression in chondrocytes. We also found electron-dense material within distended rough endoplasmic reticulum in the fibroblasts of Desbuquois patients. Our findings demonstrate the specific involvement of a nucleotidase in the endochondral ossification process...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Congenital clinodactyly is a {{condition}} characterized by the deviation of a digit or digits in the coronal plane. Angulation is often due {{to the presence of}} a <b>delta</b> <b>phalanx.</b> There is a scarcity of long-term data regarding the results of surgical treatment for clinodactyly, particularly with respect to postoperative phalangeal growth and risk factors for recurrent deformity. METHODS: Our retrospective study involved the analysis of data from medical records of patients who had corrective surgery for congenital clinodactyly. We also measured radiographs to quantify the angle of deviation and the longitudinal lengths of the surgically corrected phalanx and corresponding metacarpal. Clinodactyly was defined as radiographic angulation of 10 ° or greater in the coronal plane. Recurrence was defined as a final angulation of 10 ° or greater as well as an increase of at least 10 ° compared with the immediate postoperative measurement. The primary ratio was defined as the ratio of the length of the primary ossification center of the surgically corrected phalanx to the length of the primary ossification center of the corresponding metacarpal. The secondary ratio was the ratio of the length of the primary and secondary ossification centers together of the corrected phalanx to those of the metacarpal. Comparisons were made between preoperative, postoperative, and most-recent follow-up values. Postoperative data was restricted to radiographs taken within three months after surgery. Final follow-up data was initially permitted if radiographs were taken at least one year after surgery. Additional analysis was performed of patients with a minimum of two years clinical and radiographic follow-up. RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in angulation with surgery and a significant increase in angulation postoperatively (p< 0. 001; p< 0. 01). Overall, the mean preoperative and final digital angulation was 40. 4 ° and 17. 4 °, respectively, when a two-year minimum between the time of surgery and final follow-up measurements was implemented. This resulted in a significant average correction of 23. 3 ° (p< 0. 001). The postoperative change in angulation was found to be significantly different depending on the surgical technique used. Digits corrected with reverse wedge osteotomies showed little to no change in angulation during the postoperative period. However, digits corrected with closing wedge osteotomies showed a significant increase in angulation between the immediate postoperative and final follow-up measurements (p= 0. 007). The rate of recurrence was 43. 2 % (95 % CI: 28. 7 - 58. 9 % with a one year minimum for follow-up; 95 % CI: 27. 5 - 60. 4 % with a two year minimum for follow-up). Postoperative changes in angulation or recurrence were not significantly associated with gender, patient age at the time of surgery, the type of digit corrected, coexisting congenital syndromes, or the presence of additional hand abnormalities. The primary ratio decreased significantly with surgery, from 0. 35 preoperatively to 0. 27 postoperatively (p= 0. 03). The primary ratio then increased significantly over time to 0. 40 when there was a two-year minimum between the time of surgery and final follow-up. There was an insignificant change in primary ratio from immediately after surgery to final follow-up when data as early as one year postoperatively was included. The secondary ratio did not change significantly with surgery or during the postoperative period regardless of whether one or two-year time restrictions were in place. The mean secondary ratio was 0. 29 before surgery, 0. 25 immediately after surgery, and 0. 33 at the time of final follow-up at least two years after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Surgery to correct clinodactyly effectively decreases angulation of the digit, despite the risk of recurrent deformity over time. Our study did not identify any factors associated with recurrence. However, {{there was a significant difference}} in the change in angulation between the immediate postoperative and final follow-up measurements depending on the surgical technique used. Surgery to correct clinodactyly does not hinder postoperative growth of the corrected phalanx...|$|E
