500|$|Early in {{the fourth}} quarter, McCoy took a hard hit as he {{scrambled}} outside the pocket. He was shaken up badly enough to leave the game for a play. John Chiles came in at quarterback; his one play, a zone-read handoff to Jamaal Charles, produced 24yards. [...] According to the Associated Press recap of the game, “suddenly Texas <b>had</b> <b>figured</b> <b>out</b> how to beat a Cornhuskers' team that had been steamrolled {{on the ground in}} recent weeks.

500|$|Julia Ward of TV Squad exclaimed {{that the}} episode's three storylines were [...] "all brilliant". She praised Alec Baldwin, saying that [...] "his {{negotiation}} scenes were gold {{as was his}} line delivery". She felt that Baldwin's great acting was [...] "not unique to this episode", and was what earned him the Golden Globe. Ward finished her review by {{saying that it was}} [...] "satisfying to see a show come together as 30 Rock [...] past few weeks- settling into its rhythm [...] finding its feet". Eric Goldman of IGN felt that this episode [...] "did a very skillful job of juggling three different storylines, all of which delivered solid laughs". He thought that the crew of 30 Rock <b>had</b> <b>figured</b> <b>out</b> [...] "better uses for Jenna, and this episode offered some nice moments for her". He also enjoyed Tracy and Kenneth's subplot, saying it [...] "was a decent one".|$|E

500|$|The {{ship was}} given a short refit, during which her eight-inch gun turrets were removed and {{replaced}} by quadruple 1.1-inch (28mm) anti-aircraft guns. Rear Admiral Aubrey Fitch assumed command of Task Force 11 on 1 April and it was reorganized to consist of Lexington and the heavy cruisers [...] and [...] as well as seven destroyers. The task force sortied from Pearl Harbor on 15 April, carrying 14 Buffalos of VMF-211 to be flown off at Palmyra Atoll. After flying off the Marine fighters, the task force was ordered to train with the battleships of Task Force 1 {{in the vicinity of}} Palmyra and Christmas Island. Late on 18 April, the training was cancelled as Allied codebreakers <b>had</b> <b>figured</b> <b>out</b> that the Japanese intended to invade and occupy Port Moresby and Tulagi in the southeastern Solomon Islands (Operation Mo). Therefore, Fitch's ships, acting on a command from Nimitz, rendezvoused with TF 17 north of New Caledonia on 1 May, after refueling from the tanker [...] on 25 April to thwart the Japanese offensive. At this time, Lexingtons air group consisted of 21 Wildcats, 37 Dauntlesses and 12 Devastators.|$|E
500|$|The {{development}} {{team had}} troubles fitting the entire game {{on a single}} Game Boy Advance cartridge: while {{they had the same}} amount of memory available as when they made the first Ace Attorney game, Trials and Tribulations was 2.3 times as large content-wise. To accomplish this, they made use of [...] "tricks and workarounds" [...] they <b>had</b> <b>figured</b> <b>out</b> since working on the first game: for instance, they worked to create better structures for storing data efficiently, better compression of the graphical data, and good sounds that only use little data. Takumi found these constraints fun, as it was a chance to improve the team's abilities and a source of inspiration for doing as much as possible within the memory limitations. They still ended up having to cut or change several features: along with the art of the younger Mia, Phoenix and Edgeworth in the flashback episodes, they had planned to have new art assets for a younger Gumshoe, with his tie tied tightly and with only one hair spike, but had to settle for giving him a new coat. The character Oldbag from the first game was first cut, then included as a cameo at the end when they realized that they had just enough space for her; Takumi wanted to have her wear a lei as she would have just come back from a Hawaii trip, but was unable to due to memory limitations. Due to miscalculations of the game asset size, they had to make the character Bikini shorter in order to save some memory.|$|E
2500|$|Moore gave {{a reading}} and singing performance, with orchestral accompaniment, in 1877 at a Grand Rapids opera house. She managed to {{interpret}} jeering as {{criticism of the}} orchestra. Moore's second collection, A Few Choice Words to the Public appeared in 1878, but found few buyers. Moore [...] gave a second public performance in late 1878 at the same opera house. By then she <b>had</b> <b>figured</b> <b>out</b> that the praise directed to her was false and the jeering sincere.

2500|$|In December 2012, Taiwanese {{engineers}} from Macronix revealed {{their intention}} to announce at the 2012 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting that they <b>had</b> <b>figured</b> <b>out</b> how to improve NANDflash storage read/write cycles from 10,000 to 100 million cycles using a [...] "self-healing" [...] process that used a flash chip with [...] "onboard heaters that could anneal small groups of memory cells." [...] The built-in thermal annealing was to replace the usual erase cycle with a local high temperature process that not only erased the stored charge, but also repaired the electron-induced stress in the chip, giving write cycles of at least 100 million. The result {{was to be a}} chip that could be erased and rewritten over and over, even when it should theoretically break down. As promising as Macronix’s breakthrough might have been for the mobile industry, however, there were no plans for a commercial product to be released any time in the near future.|$|E

2500|$|The Chinese {{during the}} ancient Han Dynasty {{were also the}} first to apply {{hydraulic}} power (i.e. a waterwheel) in working the inflatable bellows of the blast furnace. This was recorded in the year 31 AD, an innovation of the engineer Du Shi, prefect of Nanyang. Although Du Shi {{was the first to}} apply water power to bellows in metallurgy, the first drawn and printed illustration of its operation with water power came in 1313, in the Yuan Dynasty era text called the Nong Shu. [...] In the 11th century, there is evidence of the production of steel in Song China using two techniques: a [...] "berganesque" [...] method that produced inferior, heterogeneous steel and a precursor to the modern Bessemer process that utilized partial decarbonization via repeated forging under a cold blast. By the 11th century, there was also a large amount of deforestation in China due to the iron industry's demands for charcoal. However, by this time the Chinese <b>had</b> <b>figured</b> <b>out</b> how to use bituminous coke to replace the use of charcoal, and with this switch in resources many acres of prime timberland in China were spared. This switch in resources from charcoal to coal was later used in Europe by the 17th century.|$|E

6000|$|His life at Stormfield--he {{had never}} seen the place until the day of his arrival, June 18, 1908--was a {{peaceful}} and serene old age. Not that he was really old; he never was that. His step, his manner, his point of view, were all and always young. He was fond of children and frequently had them about him. He delighted in games--especially in billiards--and in building the house at Stormfield the billiard-room was first considered. He had a genuine passion for the sport; without it his afternoon was not complete. His mornings he was likely to pass in bed, smoking--he was always smoking--and attending to his correspondence and reading. History and the sciences interested him, and his bed was strewn with biographies and stories of astronomical and geological research. The vastness of distances and periods always impressed him. He had no head for figures, but he would labor for hours over scientific calculations, trying to compass them and to grasp their gigantic import. I remember once finding him highly elated over the fact that he <b>had</b> <b>figured</b> <b>out</b> for himself the length in hours and minutes of a [...] "light year." [...] He showed me the pages covered with figures, and was more proud of them than if they had been the pages of an immortal story. Then we played billiards, but even his favorite game could not make him altogether forget his splendid achievement.|$|E
