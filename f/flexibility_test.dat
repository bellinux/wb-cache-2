50|$|The Response round was {{introduced}} by new producer Geoff Moore for the 1986 and 1987 series. In 1987, the Response round in the initial heats {{was a combination of}} a race between the contestants using double-odometer bicycles, and a video wall which would display random numbers of coloured blocks; the contestants were required to press one of four coloured buttons corresponding to the highest number of blocks of any one colour being displayed. This alternated with a test in which the contestants had to walk a balance beam to the first challenge - placing coloured wooden blocks into frames either side of them, swinging from side to side in doing so (this was known as the Fleischmann Flexibility Tests). They then had to run across a balance beam linked to the Minnesota Manual Dexterity Test, where they had to take a shape and place it into a corresponding space. After a final balance beam, they jump onto their respective mat to finish the race. The 1986 series consisted of the contestants competing in twos to perform first the Minnesota Manual Dexterity test (moving differently coloured cylinders {{from one side to the}} other), then running over to perform the Fleischmann <b>Flexibility</b> <b>Test</b> and then the final test, which involved hitting the relevant button whenever a colour flashed up on the screen (only one colour at a time in this case).|$|E

40|$|Back pain is a {{prevalent}} condition {{resulting in}} an annual cost of £ 500 million to the NHS. Back pain often arises from the intervertebral disc and can originate from mechanical factors (AdamsandDolan, 2005). A substantial body of research, therefore, {{is dedicated to the}} biomechanical investigation of the intervertebral discs (IVDs) (Gardner-MorseandStokes, 2003). This research field has polarised into two competing protocols:stiffness and <b>flexibility</b> <b>testing.</b> From a mechanical point of view the two are equivalent for elastic specimens. This does not hold true for non-elastic specimens, such as IVDs. The extent of any expected differences is not documented in the literature. This study investigated the effect of the two competing protocols on the reported propertie so fIVD susing acustom developed six-axis spine simulator(Holsgroveetal, 2014).

40|$|Abstract Background A lot {{of studies}} were {{directed}} to explore the relation between drug abuse and neuropsychological functions. Some studies reported that even after a long duration of disappearance of withdrawal or intoxication symptoms, many patients have obvious deterioration of cognitive functions. The {{aim of this study}} was to explore the relationship between the substance use disorders and the executive functions. Methods Two groups were selected for this study. An experimental group consisted of 154 patients and further subdivided according to the substance used into three different subgroups: opioid, amphetamine and alcohol groups which included 49, 56 and 49 patients respectively. The control group was selected matching the experimental group in the demographic characteristics and included 100 healthy persons. Tools used were: Benton visual retention tests, color trail making test, Stroop colors-word test, symbol digit modalities test, the five dots cognitive <b>flexibility</b> <b>test,</b> and TAM verbal <b>flexibility</b> <b>test.</b> All the data were subjected to statistical analysis Results The study showed that the group of drug-dependent subjects performed significantly worse than the comparison group on all measures Also, there were significant differences among the subgroups as the alcoholic group was much worse followed by the amphetamine then the opioids groups. Patients with longer duration of dependence and multiple hospital readmissions were much worse in comparison to patients with shorter duration of dependence and less readmission. Conclusion The study confirmed that the functions of specific brain regions underlying cognitive control are significantly impaired in patients of drug addiction. This impairment was significantly related to type of substance, duration of use and number of hospitalization and may contribute to most of behavioral disturbances found in addicts and need much attention during tailoring of treatment programs. </p...|$|E

To establish {{the extent of}} inter-dependence between these behavioral domains, we here undertook a systematic analysis to establish interactions between mood (assessed with the forced-swimming [FST] and sucrose consumption tests [SCT]), anxiety (elevated-plus maze [EPM] and novelty suppressed feeding [NSF] tests) and cognition (spatial memory and behavioral <b>flexibility</b> <b>tests)</b> in rats exposed to unpredictable chronic-mild-stress (uCMS). Expectedly, uCMS induced depressive-like behavior, a hyperanxious phenotype and cognitive impairment; {{with the exception of}} the measure of anxiety in the EPM, these effects were attenuated by antidepressants (imipramine, fluoxetine). Measures of mood by the FST and SCT were strongly correlated, whereas no significant correlations were found between the different measures of anxiety (EPM and NSF); likewise, measures of cognition by spatial memory and behavioral <b>flexibility</b> <b>tests</b> were poorly correlated. Inter-domain analysis revealed significant correlations between mood (FST and SCT) and anxiety-like behavior (NSF, but not EPM).

Methodology: Static and dynamic flexibility {{was measured using}} five modifications of the Straight Leg Raise test to measure hip flexion range of motion (deg). In {{the first part of}} the study (n = 33) hamstring flexibility was measured using a Static-passive, Static-active, Dynamic-supine and Dynamic-standing tests. The results of this study were used to calculate reliability statistics and to compare the various static and dynamic <b>flexibility</b> <b>tests.</b> This was followed by an intervention study (n = 12) where participants were randomly assigned to three intervention treatments of 225 s on separate days: No stretching (Treatment 1), static stretching (Treatment 2) and dynamic stretching (Treatment 3) in a cross-over study design. Results/conclusion: There was a significant difference between Static-passive and the Dynamic-supine hamstring <b>flexibility</b> <b>tests</b> (p. 05). When dynamic stretches were included in the warm-up instead of static stretches, it was expected that there would be changes, at least, in dynamic flexibility of the hamstrings. The analysis shows that there were statistically significant differences in both static (t (11) = 2. 62, p <. 05) and dynamic (t (11) = 5. 69, p <. 05). These findings were confirmed by non-parametric tests. Static stretching only influenced static flexibility (Wilcoxon, Z =- 2. 67, p <. 05) of the hamstrings, while dynamic stretching produced changes in both static (Wilcoxon, Z =- 2. 39, p <. 05) and dynamic flexibility (Wilcoxon, Z =- 2. 98, p <. 05).
