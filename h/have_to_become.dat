Other tie-ins included children's books such as My Name is Dug, illustrated by screenwriter Ronnie del Carmen. Despite Pixar's track record, Target Corporation and Walmart stocked few Up items, while Pixar's regular collaborator Thinkway Toys did not produce merchandise, claiming its story is unusual and {{would be hard to}} promote. Disney acknowledged not every Pixar film would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> a franchise. Promotional partners include Aflac, NASCAR, and Airship Ventures, while Cluster Balloons promoted the film with a replica of Carl's couch lifted by hot air balloons for journalists to sit in.|$|E

25|$|The attackers retreated after {{realizing that}} they would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> rebels against the state and their lord. Through Confucius's actions, the Bi {{officials}} had inadvertently revolted against their own lord, thus forcing Viscount Ji Huan's hand in having to dismantle the walls of Bi (as it could have harbored such rebels) or confess to instigating the event by going against proper conduct and righteousness as an official. Dubs (1949) suggests that the incident brought to light Confucius's foresight, practical political ability, and insight into human character.|$|E
25|$|With its eight daily round trips, Maersk Air only {{captured}} {{ten percent}} of the market on the Copenhagen–Stockholm route, losing money on it. Maersk therefore started negotiations with British Airways and KLM {{to see if they could}} become part of an airline alliance. They were in close negotiations with what would become Oneworld, but pulled out in the last minute. There were two main concerns: the first was that Maersk would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> a franchise partner of British Airways, and that they had already started negotiating with SAS.|$|E
25|$|The Zanj {{victory on}} the Nahr Shaytan, {{known as the}} Day of the Barges, was a {{watershed}} moment in the war, and transformed what had previously been a largely local affair into one requiring {{the intervention of the}} central government. In the aftermath of the battle, the residents of Basra became convinced that the rebels had become too strong to be defeated by local forces and abstained from engaging in further fighting. At the same time, the Abbasid government in Samarra realized that it would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> more involved in suppressing the revolt, and decided to dispatch additional government troops to the region.|$|E

The Strategic Highway Plan, list the Wilson-Wilmington Corridor as Corridor 50 and indicates {{the need to improve}} US 117 south of Goldsboro to a four lane divided access freeway. A study will include US 117 from US 13 to the boundary of the Goldsboro MPO. Currently US 117 between I-40 and Goldsboro is not at freeway grade, and many at-grade crossings would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> interchanges or be eliminated.|$|E
25|$|In {{his most}} famous exploit, Nicholas aided a poor man who had three daughters, but could not afford a proper dowry for them. This meant that they would remain {{unmarried}} and probably, in absence of any other possible employment, would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> prostitutes. Even if they did not, unmarried maidens in those days would have been assumed as being a prostitute. Hearing of the girls' plight, Nicholas decided to help them, but being too modest to help the family in public (or to save them the humiliation of accepting charity), {{he went to the}} house under the cover of night and threw three purses (one for each daughter) filled with gold coins through the window opening into the house.|$|E
25|$|Regardless of the controversies, Clarkson was asked, and agreed, {{to remain}} in the Queen's service for an {{additional}} year beyond the traditional, but not official, five-year period. Though the decision was met with mixed feelings from across the country, Prime Minister Martin had advised the Queen to retain Clarkson as her vicereine in order to provide stability while the country faced potential constitutional difficulties arising from a minority government; there had been speculation at the end of 2004 over whether or not Clarkson would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> directly involved in politics should the Cabinet led by Paul Martin lose the confidence of the House of Commons, leaving the Governor General {{to decide whether or not}} to ask the leader of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition, then Stephen Harper, to form a government, or to call a general election. Ultimately, circumstances played out so that Clarkson's personal involvement was rendered unnecessary.|$|E

500|$|Academic Sandi Mann's {{interviews}} {{found that}} the British wished and demanded cordiality from service personnel, more than from their coworkers. Israelis, Americans, and Australians, on the other hand, wanted friendliness from both their coworkers and service personnel.

500|$|The Killer {{was also}} {{influential}} on hip hop music. American hip hop artist, and Wu-Tang Clan member Raekwon released his critically praised debut album Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... (1995) that sampled numerous portions of dialog from the film. RZA, {{the producer of}} the album described the album's themes by stating that [...] "Rae and Ghost was two opposite guys as far as neighborhoods was concerned, I used John Woo's The Killer. [...] you got Chow Yun Fat [...] and Danny Lee [...] They <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> partners to work shit out." [...] Woo felt honored that the group sampled The Killer and asked for no monetary return from them. In 2005, Vibe magazine placed The Killer at number 21 on their list of top fifty films that shaped hip hop.|$|E
500|$|As the {{recording}} sessions progressed, Wim Wenders approached {{the band and}} asked them for a song for his next film, Faraway, So Close!. The Edge said [...] "we heard Wim Wenders {{was looking for a}} song... so I had a go at finishing it." [...] U2 watched the film, Faraway, So Close!, for inspiration on how to craft the song. Bono said [...] "the film was about angels who want to be human and who want to be on Earth. But to do so they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> mortal. That was a great image to play with- the impossibility of wanting something like this, and then the cost of having it." [...] Two versions of the song were crafted; the first was released on Zooropa, and the second, almost two minutes longer and featuring [...] "an edgier guitar and drum performance," [...] was included on the Faraway, So Close! soundtrack. Close to the completion of {{the recording}} Bono renamed the song [...] "Stay." [...] Wanting to further reference the Wenders film he then changed it once more, to [...] "Stay (Faraway, So Close!)".|$|E
500|$|On August 16, {{during a}} band practice, Easton told Ely {{that he wanted}} to abandon the drums and become the {{frontman}} and singer. Ely would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> the drummer, and since The Kingsmen was registered in Easton's name only, he technically led the band. Ely was not happy with this turn of events, and he and Nordby left the band at once. At the time, the song had sold roughly 600 copies and it was thought that the Kingsmen would disband. When he found out [...] "Louie Louie" [...] was climbing up the Billboard charts, Ely attempted to rejoin the group, but was blocked by Easton who was intent on adding replacements. Undeterred, Ely went on to form his own [...] "Kingsmen" [...] group and also recorded [...] "Love That Louie" [...] in 1964 for RCA Records as Jack E. Lee and the Squires. A legal battle ensued, resulting in Ely ceasing to call his group the Kingsmen and Wand Records being required to credit Ely as lead vocalist on all future [...] "Louie Louie" [...] pressings. Ely received $6000 in royalties, and Easton had to stop lip-synching the song in live performances.|$|E

500|$|Starting with Justice for All, {{the series}} {{localization}} direction has been handled by Janet Hsu; {{by the time}} she joined Capcom's localization team in 2005, the first Ace Attorney had already been localized, with the original localization team having decided to do a full localization, changing the setting from Japan to Los Angeles. While Hsu thought that this was the right choice to make, as it made the characters and dialogue more relatable and made for an emotional experience closer to what players of the Japanese version experience, it resulted in issues with each following game. According to the localization editor, Brandon Gay, Justice for All was one of their largest games to localize due to its focus on the story, and how it needs to convey the whole game world and its characters through just text; this made it a challenge to make the characters relatable for an American audience. Another thing the localization team had to keep in mind was to ensure that recurring characters were consistent with how they behave in the first Ace Attorney. According to JP Kellams, another staff member working on the localization, {{there was a lot of}} pressure on them to make a good localization, as the first game's localization had been well received; he also felt that there was room for creativity due to the game's style and subject, with room for humor that might not fit in other localizations. A lot of the humor in the original was based on Japanese wordplay; these jokes had to be redone entirely for the English release. Hsu felt that the game was more demanding than previous projects she had worked on, as the localizers [...] "almost <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> [...] " [...] in order to get the nuance and motivations right due to their complexity.|$|E
500|$|A {{significant}} {{moment in}} the character's story came when Clark decided to play football in season four, providing conflict {{between him and his}} father. Writer Darren Swimmer refers to this moment as a [...] "... callback to ..." [...] in season one. To him, when Clark defies Jonathan and joins the team anyway, it signified the moment where Jonathan finally decided that he can trust Clark to not hurt anyone. Writer Todd Slavkin viewed it as Clark finally emerging from his father's shadow. Two more significant moments came during the following season. First, Clark lost his powers when he failed to return to Jor-El to finish his training; leaving him human and vulnerable. According to Welling, [...] "... learned {{a little bit more about}} what it's like to be human, physically. Emotionally, he's pretty close to trying to understand that. It added more weight to his abilities once he got them back, and it made him realize his responsibilities for what he has." [...] The second moment came in the show's 100th episode, with the death of Clark's adoptive father. The decision to kill Jonathan was made so that Clark could finally step into his destiny, allowing Clark the boy to become Clark the man, as explained by Gough. In order to do that he needed his mentor to die, so that no one would buffer him from the world any longer. Welling saw the series' 100th episode as the chance for his character to evolve and grow. John Schneider saw the same catalyst for Clark's evolution. According to Schneider, Jonathan's death inspired Clark to make the move toward his eventual destiny. Jonathan provided such an example of sacrifice that it leaves a void in Clark. To fill that void Clark would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> Superman. It was Schneider's contention that had Jonathan not been the man he was, when the time came that the world needed Superman, Clark would have been unable to take on that persona, because he would not realize that the world needed him.|$|E
