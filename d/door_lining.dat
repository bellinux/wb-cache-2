The <b>door</b> <b>line</b> is a ‘flexible manufacturing line’. In the past, the choice has been between a highly automated but dedicated line and a manual but more flexible line. Flexible manufacturing makes it possible to combine automation with flexibility. The <b>door</b> <b>line</b> is flexible in that production can be quickly changed from one type of car door to another...|$|R

5000|$|The raised ranch {{includes}} a basement {{on the bottom}} and a [...] "full set of stairs" [...] (a full flight of stairs, usually 12 or 13) which leads to the first level. A raised ranch has a different look on the front than a split-entry as the front <b>door</b> <b>lines</b> up to the front windows differently. The front door entry is predominately at the lower floor. The top floor per FNMA/FHLMC is the living area and the lower floor is the basement, even if finished.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} of the original section {{of the house is}} intact with the original cedar joinery and room layout extant (with the exception of a superficial timber partition in one of the eastern rooms). The main entrance to the interior is via a timber door at the western end of the front verandah which leads to an entrance hall; however, panelled French <b>doors</b> <b>line</b> the front verandah gaining entrance to each of the formal rooms {{at the front of the}} house. There is also a side door on the easterly verandah.|$|R

Another uncomfortable feature was the raised ribs for door joints on some models like the Audi Alpensieger - a ridge {{to give the impression}} of the <b>door</b> <b>line</b> is unfortunate though the same practice is also seen on Spot-On models. Still, no other diecast company before or since has offered such classic German selections. They are done well, some of them very well and are reasonably priced on the normal auction sites.|$|R

A split entry has a different look than a raised ranch from the outside as the front entry <b>door</b> <b>lines</b> up to the front windows differently. A variation of the split entry is called the [...] "front to back split" [...] in which there are two upper levels.|$|R

50|$|PATCO {{operates}} 121 67 ft cars {{which were}} acquired {{in two separate}} orders, labeled PATCO I and PATCO II. The original PATCO I cars were designed and manufactured by Budd of Philadelphia, PA in 1968. Cars numbered 101-125 are single units, and cars numbered 201-250 are in permanently coupled married pairs. The PATCO II cars were delivered in 1980 (in parallel {{with the opening of}} the Woodcrest Park and ride facility) and consisted of married pairs numbered 251-296. The PATCO II cars were manufactured by Vickers Canada under a license from Budd, but are nearly indistinguishable from the PATCO I's, the only differences being that the PATCO II cars have a fixed partition behind the operator's booth and lack a stainless steel shroud below the <b>door</b> <b>line</b> to ease access to traction components.|$|R

5|$|When the glider was {{carrying}} tanks or other vehicles, common practice was that their engines would be {{started in the}} air, usually {{just prior to the}} glider casting off from the tug; special exhaust ducts were fitted to the glider to expel exhaust fumes. The Tetrarch and M22 Locust light tanks were so large that they barely fit inside the glider, and as such their crews stayed inside the tank {{for the duration of the}} flight. Once the glider landed, the anchorages keeping the vehicle stationary would be released by the driver pulling a lanyard within his reach, and the driver would then drive the tank forward, which automatically pulled a line that operated the swing door release. Universal Carriers and other vehicles relied on one of the pilots operating the <b>door</b> <b>line</b> manually. This was achieved by the pilot sliding down the fuselage and then dropping to the ground. They would then go to each undercarriage leg and release the valves there, which would expel hydraulic fluid and allow the shock absorbers struts to deflate, and then enter the glider and operate the <b>door</b> release <b>line.</b> If the swing door was jammed after the glider had landed, it was possible for tanks to break through the unopened forward fuselage and drive straight out of the glider, which occurred in both airborne operations where Hamilcars transported tanks.|$|R
