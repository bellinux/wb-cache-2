2500|$|The actual New Plymouth Night Express {{ceased to}} operate in 1956. [...] RM class 88 seater railcars had {{recently}} been introduced to New Zealand and they provided a more <b>economic</b> <b>service,</b> so they replaced the carriage train. [...] They offered a more regular daily service on a quicker timetable but continued the Expresss pattern of operating at night. [...] The southbound service arrived in New Plymouth at 11:23pm and departed for Auckland at 2:34am. [...] There was some speculation that the service was originally intended to only operate between Auckland and Taumarunui and its late running to New Plymouth {{was a result of}} this run being extended, but as it turned out, this section of the run was cancelled in 1971 and the railcars operated solely between New Plymouth and Taumarunui. [...] Soon after this change, the service was altered to a daytime run in December 1973, with a departure from New Plymouth at 8:30am and the return service leaving Taumarunui at 3:10pm.|$|E
60|$|The Abbey of Westminster rises {{amid the}} strife of factions. Around its consecrated precinct {{some of the}} boldest {{and some of the}} worst deeds have been {{achieved}} or perpetrated: sacrilege, rapine, murder, and treason. Here robbery has been practised on the greatest scale known in modern ages: here ten thousand manors belonging to the order of the Templars, without any proof, scarcely with a pretext, were forfeited in one day and divided among the monarch and his chief nobles; here the great estate of the church, which, whatever its articles of faith, belonged and still belongs to the people, was seized at various times, under various pretences, by an assembly that continually changed the religion of their country and their own by a parliamentary majority, but which never refunded the booty. Here too was brought forth that monstrous conception which even patrician Rome in its most ruthless period never equalled--the mortgaging of the industry of the country to enrich and to protect property; an act which is now bringing its retributive consequences in a degraded and alienated population. Here too have the innocent been impeached and hunted to death; and a virtuous and able monarch martyred, because, among other benefits projected for his people, he was of opinion that it was more for their advantage that the <b>economic</b> <b>service</b> of the state should be supplied by direct taxation levied by an individual known to all, than by indirect taxation, raised by an irresponsible and fluctuating assembly. But thanks to parliamentary patriotism, the people of England were saved from ship-money, which money the wealthy paid, and only got in its stead the customs and excise, which the poor mainly supply. Rightly was King Charles surnamed the Martyr; for he was the holocaust of direct taxation. Never yet did man lay down his heroic life for so great a cause: the cause of the Church and the cause of the Poor.|$|E
