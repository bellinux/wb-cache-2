[...] "My 5th <b>form</b> <b>teacher</b> of {{literature}} credited me with having talent; in the 6th form I wrote a novella called The Circassian Girl, {{and in the}} 7th a still longer one entitled The Iron Ring, both worthy of mention, apparently, only as stylistic exercises, dealing {{as they did with}} things I was totally ignorant of at the time," [...] Pisemsky remembered. He sent The Iron Ring (a novel telling of his first romantic passion) to several Saint Petersburg journals and met with all-round rejection. Several months later, already a university student, he gave the novel to Stepan Shevyryov. The professor's reaction was negative and he made a point to discourage the young man from writing about things he knew nothing about.|$|E
