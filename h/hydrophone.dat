5|$|Musashi {{was built}} with a Type 0 <b>hydrophone</b> system in her bow. It was only usable while {{stationary}} or at low speed. In September 1942 a Type 21 air-search radar was {{installed on the}} roof of the 15-metre rangefinder at the top of the forward superstructure. Two Type 22 surface-search radars were installed on the forward superstructure in July 1943. During repairs in April 1944, the Type 21 radar was replaced by a more modern version and a Type 13 early-warning radar was fitted.|$|E

B3 and B4 {{were transferred to}} Ardrossan {{by the end of}} 1915 to relieve two even more obsolescent A-class boats on local defence duties in the Firth of Clyde. B3 was transferred to Leith during mid-1916 where she was fitted with an experimental hull-mounted directional <b>hydrophone</b> system and later sent to Rosyth in 1917 where she was used as either a target to train anti-submarine forces or experimental work {{for the rest of the}} war. B4 was paid off before the end of 1916. B5 moved to Portsmouth during 1915 where she too was paid off before the end of 1916.|$|E
30|$|Once {{the number}} of <b>hydrophones</b> exceeds 3, the problem is overdetermined. Given {{time-delay}} errors caused by noise, waveguide fluctuation, and interference, a good solution may not be achieved if a large error exists {{on some of the}} <b>hydrophones.</b> Therefore, three <b>hydrophones</b> is a good choice for a practical localization system.|$|R
40|$|<b>Hydrophones</b> {{to be used}} in the {{characterization}} of medical ultrasonic transducers have been fabricated using a new polyvinylidene fluoride/trifluoroethylene (VF 2 /VF 3) copolymer. The copolymer has an advantage over VF 2 in that it does not require prestretching before poling. Thin copolymer films can be cast from solution and then poled using the corona discharge method. As there is a need for small‐diameter <b>hydrophones</b> to provide good spatial resolution in measuring highly focused ultrasonic beams, <b>hydrophones</b> with diameter as small as 0. 1 mm have been made. Both needle‐type and line <b>hydrophones</b> have been tested and their performance reported. In the case of line <b>hydrophones,</b> the output signal is proportional to the line integral of the acoustic pressure and a computer tomographic technique has been used to reconstruct the beam profiles...|$|R

5|$|Shōkaku was {{the first}} carrier in the IJN to be fitted with radar, a Type 21 early-warning radar, mounted {{on the top of}} the island around September 1942. The date of Zuikakus {{installation}} is unknown, but both ships received a second Type 21 radar in a retractable installation adjacent to the flight deck after October. Before June 1944, a Type 13 air-search radar was installed on the light tripod mast abaft the island. The Shōkaku-class carriers were also fitted with a Type 91 <b>hydrophone</b> in the bow that was only useful when anchored or moving very slowly.|$|E

40|$|The {{security}} and privacy of underwater acoustic sensor networks has received extensive attention recently {{due to the}} proliferation of underwater activities. This paper proposes an analytical model to investigate the eavesdropping attacks in underwater acoustic sensor networks. Our analytical framework considers the impacts of various underwater acoustic channel conditions (such as the acoustic signal frequency, spreading factor and wind speed) and different <b>hydrophones</b> (isotropic <b>hydrophones</b> and array <b>hydrophones)</b> in terms of network nodes and eavesdroppers. We also conduct extensive simulations {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} and the accuracy of our proposed model. Empirical results show that our proposed model is quite accurate. In addition, our results also imply that the eavesdropping probability heavily depends on both the underwater acoustic channel conditions and the features of <b>hydrophones...</b>|$|R

25|$|The first {{practical}} application for piezoelectric devices was sonar, first developed during World War I. In France in 1917, Paul Langevin {{and his coworkers}} developed an ultrasonic submarine detector. The detector consisted of a transducer, made of thin quartz crystals carefully glued between two steel plates, and a <b>hydrophone</b> to detect the returned echo. By emitting a high-frequency pulse from the transducer, and measuring {{the amount of time}} it takes to hear an echo from the sound waves bouncing off an object, one can calculate the distance to that object.|$|E
25|$|Suddenly {{there was}} a series of ear-splitting explosions, as Fame dropped a pattern of 10 depth charges. The lights in U-353 went out and water entered forward and aft through the <b>hydrophone</b> shafts. The {{electric}} motors stopped working, {{all but one of the}} depth gauges broke, and the aft hydroplanes were put out of action. U-353 went deeper, almost out of control as water poured in through the stern torpedo tube causing her to lose trim. The U-boat blew her tanks and surfaced, and the captain ordered the crew to prepare to abandon ship.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Focusing on the {{disturbance}} of ocean reverberation in active sonar detection, this article researched {{the characteristics of}} vector ocean reverberation when vector <b>hydrophones</b> were the receivers. By experiments and theoretic analyses, scalar and vector ocean reverberation was gained when transmitting signal with different frequencies, impulse widths, receivers at different depths, and the source levels and laws of energy attenuation were analyzed statistically. By comparison, reverberation received by vector <b>hydrophones</b> {{was found to have}} characteristic of lower reverberation levels and faster attenuation, thus, vector <b>hydrophones</b> have the ability of anti-reverberation...|$|R

Geophysicists studying the IUSS data find seismic events and correlate them between <b>hydrophones</b> to locate their sources. Marine biologists and intelligence personnel {{are interested in the}} identification and localization of other sounds in the IUSS data. The current means of identifying and correlating sounds is a laborious visual examination of the data on a graphics workstation. In this thesis, a computer-vision method is presented for automatically identifying the sources of low-frequency sounds that are received on the IUSS <b>hydrophones.</b> Also presented in this thesis is a blackboard architecture for correlating sound 'shapes' between <b>hydrophones</b> using a time-shift transform.

25|$|Australia's Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS). Data from an {{acoustic}} observatory (RCS) 40km west of Rottnest Island, Western Australia, near the Perth Canyon. IMOS stations {{have just one}} <b>hydrophone</b> each and therefore cannot provide a bearing on {{the source of the}} noise. Several IMOS recorders deployed in the Indian Ocean off northwestern Australia by CMST may have recorded data related to Flight 370. These recorders were not recovered as part of the investigation. These sensors record only five minutes out of every fifteen and are likely to be contaminated by noise from seismic surveys. CMST originally planned to recover the sensors in September or October, but now plan to make the trip in August.|$|E
25|$|Active sonar is {{also used}} to measure {{distance}} through water between two sonar transducers or a combination of a <b>hydrophone</b> (underwater acoustic microphone) and projector (underwater acoustic speaker). A transducer is a device that can transmit and receive acoustic signals ("pings"). When a hydrophone/transducer receives a specific interrogation signal it responds by transmitting a specific reply signal. To measure distance, one transducer/projector transmits an interrogation signal and measures the time between this transmission and the receipt of the other transducer/hydrophone reply. The time difference, scaled by the speed of sound through water and divided by two, is the distance between the two platforms. This technique, when used with multiple transducers/hydrophones/projectors, can calculate the relative positions of static and moving objects in water.|$|E
25|$|The U-boat threat lessened in 1917, when {{merchant}} ships began travelling in convoys, {{escorted by}} destroyers. This tactic {{made it difficult}} for U-boats to find targets, which significantly lessened losses; after the <b>hydrophone</b> and depth charges were introduced, accompanying destroyers could attack a submerged submarine with some hope of success. Convoys slowed the flow of supplies, since ships had to wait as convoys were assembled. The solution to the delays was an extensive program of building new freighters. Troopships were too fast for the submarines and did not travel the North Atlantic in convoys. The U-boats had sunk more than 5,000 Allied ships, at a cost of 199 submarines. World War I also saw the first use of aircraft carriers in combat, with launching Sopwith Camels in a successful raid against the Zeppelin hangars at Tondern in July 1918, as well as blimps for antisubmarine patrol.|$|E

25|$|Tunny {{returned}} to waters off Toagel Mlungui and resumed patrols. On {{the morning of}} 29 March, she observed {{a large number of}} small vessels leaving Malakal Harbor, none worth an attack. Apparently, the enemy had somehow received word of the Fifth Fleet's impending bombing attack on Japanese installations in the Caroline Islands and made a desperate attempt to clear the area. Late in the afternoon, a larger formation appeared: the 63,000-ton battleship Musashi, the light cruiser , and three destroyers, also fleeing the expected aerial bombardment. After a daring approach, Tunny fired six torpedoes at the battleship from her bow tubes. The torpedoes passed directly under an alert destroyer of the screen which immediately hoisted flags to warn the battleship, swung parallel to the torpedo tracks, and made a run on the submarine. Tunny went deep and ran for the southwest while the destroyer dropped 38 depth charges in a short, but concentrated counterattack. One torpedo had found its mark on the battleship's bow, which caused flooding of the <b>hydrophone</b> compartment and 18 casualties. Toward sunset, the submarine lost contact with the formation. Later that night, she encountered what she thought to be the same force and was held down for two hours by one of the escorting ships. Hits by two of Tunnys torpedoes had damaged but failed to slow the powerful battleship. However, Musashi was still forced to return to port for repairs and upgrades, which kept her out of action for most of April.|$|E
