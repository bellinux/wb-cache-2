5|$|After {{a year of}} courtship, Wallace became {{engaged in}} 1864 to a young woman whom, in his autobiography, he would only {{identify}} as Miss L. Miss L. {{was the daughter of}} Lewis Leslie who played chess with Wallace. However, to Wallace's great dismay, she broke off the engagement. In 1866, Wallace married Annie Mitten. Wallace had been introduced to Mitten through the botanist Richard Spruce, who had befriended Wallace <b>in</b> <b>Brazil</b> <b>and</b> who was also a good friend of Annie Mitten's father, William Mitten, an expert on mosses. In 1872, Wallace built the Dell, a house of concrete, on land he leased in Grays in Essex, where he lived until 1876. The Wallaces had three children: Herbert (1867–1874), Violet (1869–1945), and William (1871–1951).|$|E

Lemaitre and Chambers were seen as the only gold medal contenders for the 100 m final at the European Athletics Championships, but the event defied expectations in terms of times and placings. The Frenchman won in 10.11seconds into a headwind while a tight finish between the four following athletes (all 10.18) saw Chambers finish fifth.|$|E

5|$|Heavy metals can degrade air, water, {{and soil}} quality, and {{subsequently}} cause health issues in plants, animals, and people, {{when they become}} concentrated {{as a result of}} industrial activities. Common sources of heavy metals in this context include mining and industrial wastes; vehicle emissions; lead-acid batteries; fertilisers; paints; and treated timber; aging water supply infrastructure; and microplastics floating in the world's oceans. Recent examples of heavy metal contamination and health risks include the occurrence of Minamata disease, in Japan (1932–1968; lawsuits ongoing as of 2016); the Bento Rodrigues dam disaster <b>in</b> <b>Brazil,</b> <b>and</b> high levels of lead in drinking water supplied to the residents of Flint, Michigan, in the north-east of the United States.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, Torres was {{selected}} for Spain's UEFA Euro 2012 squad and won the Golden Boot award for his three goals scored at the tournament. He netted a brace against the Republic of Ireland before scoring the fourth goal in a 4–0 win over Italy in the final. Torres' goal against the Italians was his second in the final of a European Championship. The following year, Torres scored five goals at the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup. His tally, which included a four-goal haul against Tahiti, earned him another Golden Boot award. He was then included in Spain's squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup <b>in</b> <b>Brazil</b> <b>and</b> scored against Australia in a 3–0 group-stage victory. It was a dead rubber match for Spain, however, as their elimination from the competition had already been confirmed.|$|E
5|$|In the interim, {{rather than}} await a decision, Ferrari {{continued}} her studies. Between 1921 and 1923 she visited many clinics in Europe, including facilities in Austria, Belgium, England, France, Germany and Italy. She {{assisted in the}} clinic of Marie Curie in Paris {{as well as in}} the Columbia Hospital for Women and Lying-In Asylum in Washington, DC. The Faculty of Medicine of Paris awarded her the first diploma ever given to a woman for studies in urinary tract monitoring. In 1924, she designed a vaginoscope, which was much easier to sterilize and was more adaptable to multiple specula than previous models. The device significantly improved services which were available to women <b>in</b> <b>Brazil,</b> <b>and</b> was featured in the articles of the Journal of Gynecology and Obstetrics of Rio de Janeiro. The innovation won the Grand Prize at the 1924 Congreso Hispano Lusitano Americano de Ciencias Médicas held in Seville, Spain.|$|E
