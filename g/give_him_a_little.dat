500|$|... "Bart Stops to Smell the Roosevelts" [...] {{was written}} by Tim Long and {{directed}} by Steven Dean Moore. The episode features former American President Theodore Roosevelt {{with the use of}} archival audio recordings. The use of Roosevelt's voice was first announced at the San Diego Comic-Con International in San Diego, California, on July 23, 2011. Showrunner Al Jean revealed to the press that [...] "we [...] have actual audio of Roosevelt (taken from a speech circa 1918) in the show. I thought, 'Finally! We can put a president in the show.' And a good one too. We're going to <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> credit at the end." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{finding his}} lead actors, Lee Daniels {{set out to}} find a {{producer}} to craft the music for the series. Because he felt his own musical tastes and desires would be a little too dated for the show, Daniels consulted with people he thought could <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more insight, his children. At the urging of his son and daughter, Daniels contacted super producer Timothy [...] "Timbaland" [...] Mosley, known for scoring hits with some of pop's biggest artists including Missy Elliott, Madonna, Brandy, Destiny's Child, Justin Timberlake, Jay-Z, Nelly Furtado, Ginuwine and Aaliyah.|$|E
2500|$|On {{his return}} to Vienna, his indisposition {{increased}} visibly and made him gloomily depressed. His wife was truly distressed over this. One day when she was driving in the Prater with him, to <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> distraction and amusement, and they were sitting by themselves, Mozart began to speak of death, and declared that he was writing the Requiem for himself. Tears came to {{the eyes of the}} sensitive man: 'I feel definitely,' he continued, 'that I will not last much longer; I am sure I have been poisoned. I cannot rid myself of this idea.' ...|$|E
60|$|They {{complied}} with my wish, and I stepped down to Steele and <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> shake. He awoke instantly.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Captain Pratt,' she ses, drawing 'erself up. 'I'm Mrs. Pratt. He left {{yesterday}} morning, and I've come up 'ere {{by train}} to <b>give</b> <b>'im</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> surprise.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "’Captain Pratt,’ she ses, drawing ’erself up. ’I’m Mrs. Pratt. He left {{yesterday}} morning, and I’ve come up ’ere {{by train}} to <b>give</b> <b>’im</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> surprise.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A scapegrace? Bon Dieu, no. That is a harsh name to <b>give</b> <b>him.</b> <b>A</b> <b>little</b> indiscreet at times, {{a little}} rash, {{as is the}} way of youth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> longer," [...] said Mrs. Kybird. [...] "I {{only came}} 'ere to please 'im, {{and to get}} 'ome alone is more than I can do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You will {{excuse me}} if I <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> brandy, won't you, sir?" [...] he said. [...] "He's really not quite fit for getting about yet, {{but he was}} {{worrying}} about his book." ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Vivian <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> look--there {{was always}} {{more or less}} of it in her face--which seemed {{equivalent}} to an entreaty that her interlocutor should spare her.|$|R
60|$|Rosy. I {{was just}} <b>giving</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> advice.--Well I must {{go for the}} present.--Good-morning to your worship--you need not fear the {{lieutenant}} while he is in your house.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{sure you}} are very considerate," [...] said the duchess with a smile; and she <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> nod for good-by with which he took his departure.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{must try}} to keep him warm and when he can swallow <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> weak liquor and perhaps some hot soup. I expect that's all, but I have sent for a doctor." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> quiver first," [...] said Dave. [...] "He won't {{know what}} to make of it. I don't think he'll notice the cord. It is just the color of the wall." ...|$|E
6000|$|The elder lady {{shook her}} head. [...] "So we--heard," [...] she said. [...] "My dear, <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> time. I have seen many men and women--and can't help a fancy {{that there is}} good in him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Did he? How observing you are," [...] said Betty, <b>giving</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> sidelong glance. [...] "Well, {{he is very}} agreeable, and he dances {{better than}} many of the young men." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{stood looking}} at the girl, and trying in vain to think of {{something}} to say. Miss Hartley, with somewhat more colour than usual, <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bow and hurried off.|$|R
60|$|I <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> time to recover. He {{consumed}} it {{in putting}} {{his hand to}} his forehead and taking it away again, and in backing his chair into the corner behind him.|$|R
6000|$|... "O Tho-maas, {{ask your}} brother, Macumazahn, {{if he is}} ready to try to shoot the vultures. If not, as I wish to be fair, I will <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more time to make his magic medicine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here, drink this, {{it will do}} you good," [...] he said, {{and placed}} the tin cup to the sufferer's lips. The man gulped down the beverage, {{and it seemed to}} <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> strength. Presently he sat up again.|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear fellow, you quite {{misunderstand}} me. I'm {{amazed at}} your pluck, your energy. Soft, indeed! {{we have been}} most egregiously mistaken. Provocation! I just think you had; my only sorrow is that you didn't <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more." ...|$|E
50|$|Manisha is {{unaware of}} her secret admirer. When the boy musters {{up the courage}} and speaks his heart to her, she takes it in her stride and <b>gives</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> teaser on {{adolescent}} love.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{look as if}} you would," [...] ses the gal, <b>giving</b> <b>’im</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{look under}} ’er eyelashes. [...] "It must be nice {{to be a man}} and be brave. I wish I was a man." ...|$|R
60|$|The idea struck <b>him</b> like <b>a</b> revelation: {{he lifted}} his head, and eyed her with breathless interest. She <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{ornamental}} handbag, {{in which she was}} accustomed to carry her handkerchief, and purse, and smelling-bottle.|$|R
6000|$|... "O, {{better not}} speak of that," [...] {{interrupted}} Kitty with bitterness, [...] "it's all over now." [...] And the final tinge of superiority in his manner made her <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> stab of dismissal. [...] "Good by. I see my cousins coming." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am {{sure it is}} for us,' she repeated. A gladness {{came into}} her eyes. Still the cloud {{followed}} the train. She leaned forward to Siegmund and pointed out the cloud to him. She was very eager to <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> of her faith.|$|E
6000|$|... "We had to <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> rope to {{go through}} with his act," [...] he whispered confidentially. [...] "But he'll sign it all right. And now, if you'll excuse me, Mr. Paret, I'll lay a few mines. See you at the hotel, sir." ...|$|E
50|$|Loris goes to {{interview}} at the Chinese company. His teacher <b>gives</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> Chinese good luck charm, and Jessica sees this. Loris bombs the interview, unable to answer the very first question: to tell his name.|$|R
60|$|Yusuf <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> cup {{of black}} {{coffee and a}} {{cigarette}} with a strange, bitter taste. Then {{he talked about the}} grain, and presently took a long roll of paper and some documents from the chest.|$|R
6000|$|... "He couldn't stand, so I carried <b>him</b> {{home and}} <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> just <b>a</b> <b>little</b> milk. Fortunately {{he was able}} to lap it. I <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more at {{intervals}} all day, and when I left {{he was able to}} crawl around. I think he'll be all right, but you'll have to be careful how you feed <b>him</b> for <b>a</b> few days. Don't let your hearts run away with your judgment and kill him with kindness." ...|$|R
6000|$|VERA. A traitor! Three {{days ago}} {{he could have}} betrayed every man of you here, [19]and the gibbet would have been your doom.[19] He gave you all your lives once. <b>Give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> time--a week, a month, a few days; but not now!--O God,[20] not now! ...|$|E
60|$|For {{several days}} he {{wrestled}} grimly with the situation, while Mrs. Porter, who had planned out her week into {{four days of}} charing, two of amusement, and Sunday in bed, looked on with smiling approval. She even offered to <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> instruction--verbal--in scrubbing the kitchen-floor.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{not long}} arter {{he took it}} into his head that Huldy {{ought to have a}} pig to be a fattin' with the buttermilk. Mis' Pipperidge set him up to it; and jist then old Tim Bigelow, out to Juniper Hill, told him if he'd call over he'd <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> pig.|$|E
60|$|The {{absurdity of}} this idea, though <b>a</b> <b>little</b> grisly, struck Dan {{as a good}} joke. He hit the companionable Boardman on the shoulder, and then <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> hug, and remounted his path of air, and walked off in it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Any {{friend of}} my father’s is welcome to me, sir," [...] said the girl, coldly. She looked from the innkeeper to his odd-looking guest, and {{conscious}} of something strained in the air, <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bow and quitted the room.|$|R
60|$|At this, Annie {{could not}} help <b>giving</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> look which would have {{provoked}} reflection {{in the mind of}} the old lady, had she not been very earnestly engaged in gazing out into the road, in the hope of seeing Letty.|$|R
