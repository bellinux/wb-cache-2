40|$|Methods used to {{determine}} a procedure for correcting static engine data {{for the effects of}} forward motion are described. Data were analyzed from airplane flyover and static-engine tests with a JT 8 D- 109 low-bypass-ratio turbofan <b>engine</b> <b>installed</b> <b>on</b> a DC- 9 - 30, with a CF 6 - 6 D high-bypass-ratio turbofan <b>engine</b> <b>installed</b> <b>on</b> a DC- 10 - 10, and with a JT 9 D- 59 A high-bypass-ratio turbofan <b>engine</b> <b>installed</b> <b>on</b> a DC- 10 - 40. The observed differences between the static and the flyover data bases are discussed in terms of noise generation, convective amplification, atmospheric propagation, and engine installation. The results indicate that each noise source must be adjusted separately for forward-motion and installation effects and then projected to flight conditions as a function of source-path angle, directivity angle, and acoustic range relative to the microphones on the ground...|$|R
25|$|Visibility: Pilot {{visibility}} may be poorer due to {{the width}} of the <b>engine</b> <b>on</b> single-engine <b>aircraft,</b> although tight fitting cowlings helped reduce this factor somewhat.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the Refan Program is to {{establish}} the technical feasibility of substantially reducing the noise levels of existing JT 8 D powered aircraft.

No major technical problems exist that preclude the development and installation of refanned <b>engines</b> <b>on</b> <b>aircraft</b> currently powered by the JT 8 D engine. The refan concept is technically feasible and provides calculated noise reductions of from 7 to 8 EPNdB for the B 727 - 200 aircraft and from 10 to 12 EPNdB for the DC- 9 - 32 aircraft at the FAR Part 36 measuring stations. Corresponding reductions in the 90 EPNdB footprint area are estimated to vary from about 70 percent for the DC- 9 to about 80 percent for the B 727...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{the study}} is the {{accurate}} prediction of the effect of uncontained <b>engine</b> debris <b>on</b> <b>aircraft</b> structures.

Tcl, Perl, Rexx, and Python have graphics toolkits {{and can be used}} to code functions and procedures for shell scripts which pose a speed bottleneck (C, Fortran, assembly language &c are much faster still) and to add functionality not available in the shell language such as sockets and other connectivity functions, heavy-duty text processing, working with numbers if the calling script does not have those abilities, self-writing and self-modifying code, techniques like recursion, direct memory access, various types of sorting and more, which are difficult or impossible in the main script, and so on.

50|$|Whitehead built a model {{but decided}} that the idea was not viable.

50|$|The {{number of}} <b>engines</b> <b>on</b> an <b>aircraft</b> affects its {{reliability}} and safety. The more engines there are, the safer it is if one <b>engine</b> fails.
