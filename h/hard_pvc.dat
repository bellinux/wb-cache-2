50|$|The early '80s {{sees the}} 101 become quite {{popular in the}} United Kingdom. Advertised under the slogan Go New! Go Yugo!, the 311/ 313/ 511/ 513 is the {{cheapest}} new car available to British buyers. In 1984, the range's entry-level model costs less than £2,400, roughly half {{the price of the}} equivalent Ford Escort. In order to avoid rust caused by road gritting, <b>hard</b> <b>PVC</b> coating was used throughout the underside, sills and valances.|$|E
50|$|DX/Russian Balls are a {{style of}} juggling balls that {{combines}} many {{of the benefits of}} both beanbags and stage balls. DX balls are constructed with a <b>hard</b> <b>PVC</b> outer shell, similar to a stage ball, and are part-filled with millet seed, to give the ball a consistent weight. This produces a juggling ball that flies consistently in the air, and does not roll away when dropped. The DX ball is patented in the UK by Beard Enterprises Ltd.|$|E
5000|$|The toy {{manufacturer}} [...] 'Heimo GmbH' [...] was a German {{company in}} Germany. Since {{the end of}} the 1950s, it has been producing collective figures in cooperation with the US company Marx in Hamburg: one focus was on motifs according to Walt Disney, in addition to general popular figures from [...] <b>hard</b> <b>PVC</b> and later hard rubber Such as Vikings, Romans, Pirates, Knights, Indians and Cowboys as well as US soldiers. From the 1960s, some figures were distributed unchanged under the name Heimo; Some were even produced only for the new company in Mölln founded by Marx's CEO Heitmann.|$|E

50|$|Drift trikes are {{tricycles}} {{that have}} slick rear wheels, normally {{made from a}} <b>hard</b> plastic, often <b>PVC.</b> They are designed to drift, by intentionally initiating loss of traction to the rear wheels and counter-steering to negotiate corners. They are usually ridden on paved roads with steep downhill gradients, with corners and switchbacks.|$|R
40|$|Poly (vinyl chloride), {{which is}} {{commonly}} abbreviated as PVC, {{is widely used}} due to it being inexpensive, durable, and flexible. As a <b>hard</b> thermoplastic, <b>PVC</b> {{is used in the}} applications such as in building materials pipe and plumbing. The factors that should be considered in using PVC is safety and environmental issues. Mixing PVC with natural fibres is an interesting alternative. The main challenge in the research on natural fibre/polymer composites is the poor compatibility between the fibres and the matrix because this will affect their bonding strength. During the mixing with PVC, some natural fibres may acts as reinforcing materials while other natural fibres only act as filler, which contribute less to mechanical strength improvement. However, generally natural fibres also give positive outcome to the stiffness of the composites while decreasing the density...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Salt spray {{test chamber}} {{comprises}} {{of a test}} specimen mounted in it & secured in a tightly closed space for testing under corrosive environmental conditions. A fog assembly consisting of nozzle and valve is used to control and adjust the velocity and quantity of salt mixed water spray. The test specimen kept inside the inner tank is exposed to corrosive conditions. Thus we can obtain performance of specimen under the desirable corrosive conditions. We have optimized {{the weight of a}} 900 mm× 450 mm× 450 mm salt spray test chamber. The working temperature range for our salt spray test chamber is from ambient temperature upto 50 ْ C. The company is presently using stainless steel frame for inner tank support. We have changed the material from stainless steel to <b>Hard</b> <b>PVC</b> (Polyvinyl Chloride). Thus we have tried to use possible optimum solution for the design and manufacturing process, thereby we have reduced weight and simultaneously cost also...|$|E
40|$|Children {{have strong}} {{preferences}} for sex-typed toys; boys prefer trucks, whereas girls prefer dolls. These preferences {{appear to be}} driven by complex interactions of hormones and the socio-cultural environment. The relative contribution of each of these factors in children is impossible to isolate given ethical limitations. Non-human primate species afford the opportunity to examine preferences in the absence of societal values and influences that children experience. In two previous studies with non-human primates, one with vervet monkeys and one with rhesus monkeys, monkeys showed sex-typed object preferences that paralleled those of children. However, several uncontrolled variables could have influenced these preferences. Our study considered object characteristics and we controlled for possible color preferences. We also tested monkeys individually to eliminate the effects of social facilitation and dominance rank. In experiment 1, monkeys were given a choice between similar objects of different colors (Phase A) and moving vs. non-moving objects (Phase B). In experiment 2, monkeys were given a choice between dolls and trucks (Phase A) and subsequent phases looked at the influence of moving wheels (Phase B) and hardness (Phase C). Contrary to previous findings, monkeys did not show sex-typed object preferences. Instead, the monkeys preferred blue objects, <b>hard</b> <b>PVC</b> objects such as trucks and hard dolls, and dolls with wheels. The influence of previous reward based cognitive testing, familiarity of substrate materials, and rearing condition are considered as possible explanations for these findings...|$|E
40|$|Models for {{isotropic}} materials {{based on}} the equivalent stress concept are discussed. At first, so-called classical models which are useful {{in the case of}} absolutely brittle or ideal ductile materials are presented. Tests for basic stress states are suggested. At second, standard models describing the intermediate range between the absolutely brittle and ideal-ductile behavior are introduced. Any criterion is expressed by various mathematical equations formulated, for example, in terms of invariants. At the same time the criteria can be visualized which simplifies the application. At third, in the main part pressure-insensitive, pressure-sensitive and combined models are separated. Fitting methods based on mathematical, physical and geometrical criteria are necessary. Finally, three examples (gray cast iron, poly(oxymethylene) (POM) and poly(vinyl chloride) (<b>PVC)</b> <b>hard</b> foam) demonstrates the application of different approaches in modeling certain limit behavior. Two appendices are necessary for a better understanding of this chapter: in Chap. 2 applied invariants are briefly introduced and a table of discussed in this chapter criteria with references is given...|$|R
40|$|Three coating {{materials}} for rotating cylindrical-coated wiping rollers were fatigue tested in 2 Intaglio printing presses. The coatings were a <b>hard,</b> cross-linked, plasticized <b>PVC</b> thermoset (P-series); a plasticized PVC (A-series); and a hard, nitryl rubber (R-series). Both 2 - and 3 -parameter Weibull analyses {{as well as}} a cost-benefit analysis were performed. The mean value of life for the R-series coating is 24 and 9 times longer than the P- and A-series coatings, respectively. Both the cost and replacement rate for the R-series coating was significantly less than those for the P- and A-series coatings. At a very high probability of survival the R-series coating is approximately 2 and 6 times the lives of the P- and A-series, respectively, before the first failure occurs. Where all coatings are run to failure, using the mean (life) time between removal (MTBR) for each coating to calculate the number of replacements and costs provides qualitatively similar results to those using a Weibull analysis...|$|R
40|$|The study {{analyses}} the biotechnological {{production of}} poly(3 -hydroybutyrate) [PHB] (a raw-material for bioplastics) combined with well-known procedures and current technology {{under conditions of}} economic feasibility and ecological compatibility. Evidences are the material- and energy-balances {{as soon as the}} desired price of 1, 28 Euro/kg PHB. Stepwise single procedures have modelled as e. g. the 'model of the virtual microorganism'. Through integration in AweeSim a dynamic simulation tool is generated, that mirrored the manufacture of PHB up to the granulates. It is possible to replace pPolypropylene and <b>PVC</b> (<b>hard)</b> because attributes ranges of PHB. Raw materials are organic 'sources' or'value' substances: methane as substratum produces by e. g. agricultural wastes in a biogas plant. In use of final model most diverse scenarios can be tried out, which must be concretised in a follow-up project and must be developed as a decision-support-model. (orig.)
