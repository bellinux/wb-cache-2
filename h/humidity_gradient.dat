On average, ducts occurred 5 % of the time in the summer months, and 2 - 3 % in the spring, fall, and winter months.

In general, local areas near coast lines or near the pole over ice/ocean had higher frequency of ducts than local areas over land mass. For summer and fall months, <b>humidity</b> <b>gradients</b> contributed most to the formation of a duct, while temperature gradients contributed to a lesser degree.

The high-resolution model output data are utilized to diagnose the double front structure, and the distributions of potential temperature, equivalent potential temperature, and specic humidity {{in the vicinity of}} the Meiyu Front System (MYFS) in the Jiang-Huai Valley. The results show that both the potential temperature gradient and the specic <b>humidity</b> <b>gradient</b> have important impacts on the two strong equivalent potential temperature gradient zones associated with the double front structure of the MYFS, but the latter (mois ture gradient) is more important. In addition, the tendency equation of specic <b>humidity</b> <b>gradient</b> is theoretically derived.

After 1 h of acclimation at 70 % RH ticks were released so that they could either stay, or walk towards either the wet or the dry end. Their position was recorded 2 h post-release.

Riparian zones surrounding streams are important {{components of the}} bio-scape. Four tributary streams (Two perennial and Two intermittent) were sampled, in the Southern Cascade region of California using methods developed to infer effects of harvesting on microclimatic gradients from stream to upland. These methods were modified to observe the effects of flow on temperature and relative <b>humidity</b> <b>gradients.</b> The objectives of this study are: (1) to characterize flow of perennial and intermittent tributary streams of Big Chico Creek using temperature and stage methods; (2) identify differences in temperature and relative humidity at intermittent ix and perennial sites during different flow conditions; (3) describe effects of perennial and intermittent stream classes on temperature and relative <b>humidity</b> <b>gradients</b> and (4) compare changes in gradients from stream to upland between stream classes. Five temperature and relative humidity loggers were installed along transects running from stream to upland positions at each stream. Linear regressions of relative changes along transects were used to quantify gradients. One and two-way ANOVA {{were used to determine}} statistical differences in gradients and relative changes along transects respectively. This was done between stream classes, transects, and transects and Stations for appropriate time periods. Results point to distinct temperature and relative <b>humidity</b> <b>gradients</b> for perennial and intermittent streams (0. 0195 and 0. 0102 C/m), during daytime dry conditions, while the intermittent stream is dry and the perennial is still flowing. For the same time period significant differences exist between stream Stations and all other Stations (7. 5 m to 45 m) along the perennial transect, while intermittent statistical differences don???t exist until near upland Stations (30 m to 60 m). The study indicates that perennial and intermittent streams have distinctive temperature and relative humidity conditions above the stream during the peak daytime, when the intermittent ceases to flow and the perennial continues to flow. Additional site specific data are needed for various site conditions in order to determine if generalizations can be made about these stream classes. CSU, Chic...|$|R

40|$|The {{response}} of different bacterial species to reduced water availability was studied using a simple relative <b>humidity</b> <b>gradient</b> technique. Interestingly, distinct differences in morphology and growth patterns were observed between {{populations of the}} same species growing at different relative humidity. Gram-positive cocci increased in cell size as they approached humidity growth limits and staphylococcal species started growing in tetrad/cubical formations instead of their normal grape-like structures. Gram-negative rods displayed wave-like patterns, forming larger waves as they became increasingly filamentous at low humidity. In contrast, cells of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis became shorter, curved, and eventually almost coccoid. Moreover, B. subtilis started to sporulate at low humidity. The altered morphology and/or growth patterns of bacteria growing at low humidity might be more ecologically relevant than their textbook appearance at high humidity since their natural habitats are often dry. Transmission electron microscopic analyses revealed that staphylococci grown at low humidity have significantly thickened cell walls, which may explain why these cells displayed increased resistance to vancomycin.

RH was monitored at increasing distances from the stream edge to 30 m into the adjacent riparian forests.
