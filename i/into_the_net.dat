5|$|Ten {{minutes into}} the second half, Juventus {{equalised}}: Claudio Marchisio back-heeled the ball to right-back Stephan Lichtsteiner, who set up Carlos Tevez. Barcelona goalkeeper Marc-André ter Stegen blocked the shot from Tevez, but Álvaro Morata equalised by putting the rebound <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>net.</b> In the 67th minute, Juventus appealed for a penalty when Paul Pogba {{went down in the}} area when challenged by Dani Alves, but the referee did not give it. Two minutes later, Barcelona got back into the lead when Lionel Messi shot {{from the edge of the}} area, Gianluigi Buffon blocked it and Suárez put in the rebound. Soon after, Neymar put the ball <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>net</b> from Alba's cross, but it was disallowed as the referee deemed that Neymar had headed it into his own hand.|$|E
5|$|After {{taking a}} single point from their opening two games, Scotland had to defeat the Netherlands by three clear goals to progress. Despite the Dutch taking the lead, Scotland fought back to win 3–2 with a goal from Kenny Dalglish and two from Archie Gemmill, the second of which is {{considered}} one of the greatest World Cup goals ever; Gemmill beat three Dutch defenders before lifting the ball over goalkeeper Jan Jongbloed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>net.</b> The victory was not sufficient to secure a place in the second round, and Scotland were eliminated on goal difference for the second successive World Cup.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{were drawn}} {{away in the}} third round, against Sheffield United at Bramall Lane. Both teams scored rapidly, with three goals scored {{in the space of}} six minutes. The first {{as the result of a}} {{scramble}} which ended with Jimmy Brain heading the ball <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>net</b> for Arsenal. United quickly responded, equalising from a header by Harry Johnson. But Arsenal went ahead once more following a goal by Charlie Buchan. David Mercer equalised once more for Sheffield after 40 minutes, to keep the scores level going into half-time. Joe Hulme scored the final goal of the match, and the winner for Arsenal, in the 60th minute.|$|E

5|$|Both {{games against}} Barcelona ended in draws. Despite Giggs, Scholes and Beckham putting the team into a 3–2 lead at Old Trafford, the {{visitors}} were awarded a late penalty after Butt was sent off for handling the ball. Luis Enrique converted the ball <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>net</b> to leave both teams with {{a point on}} Matchday One. In the return game on 25 November at the Camp Nou, a fixture that Barça needed to win to avoid elimination, Dwight Yorke's goals put United ahead 3–2, but Barça star Rivaldo equalized and nearly scored again but his effort hit the crossbar.|$|E

In the first knockout game against Belgium he made another assist after chipping a free-kick into the penalty area, where David Platt volleyed the ball <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>net.</b> Gascoigne was at the centre of the action again in the quarter-final clash with Cameroon when he gave away a penalty, which Cameroon converted. In extra-time he made a successful through-ball pass from which Gary Lineker won, and subsequently scored a penalty, which proved to be the winning goal.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fifth}} round, Arsenal {{travelled}} to The Hawthorns to play West Bromwich Albion. Wenger added {{experience to the}} side to complement youth, with Parlour, Edu, Kanu and Keown all featuring. Arsenal {{took the lead in}} the 25th minute through Kanu. Lauren's cross from the right-hand side deflected {{in the direction of the}} striker. His header was saved by goalkeeper Russell Hoult, who was unable to deny Kanu shooting the rebounded ball <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>net.</b> Aliadière scored Arsenal's second goal of the match following Hoult's poor clearance.|$|E

5|$|In {{their last}} {{game of the}} League season, away to Sheffield United, Small Heath scored first when Foulkes' {{attempted}} clearance rebounded off his teammate Walter Hill <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>net,</b> and Mobley extended the lead after a break down the left by Hands. Although United came close to scoring from a second-half scrimmage when the ball appeared to cross the line, Small Heath held on to ensure their First Division survival with an unexpected victory.|$|E
5|$|On 15 May 1971, Banks was {{involved}} in a notorious incident with George Best who, while playing against England for Northern Ireland, flicked the ball out of Banks' hands and headed it <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>net.</b> The move was audacious, but was disallowed by the referee, who judged it to be dangerous play. Banks played his 73rd and final game for England on 27 May 1972, in a 1–0 win over Scotland at Hampden Park. During his 73 international games he kept 35 clean sheets and lost just nine games.|$|E
5|$|After a goalless first half, Corinthian {{went ahead}} {{early in the}} second half with a goal from Gilbert Ashton. There were a large number of attacks from both sides, but it took until the 77th minute before Cardiff {{equalised}} with a header by Hughie Ferguson after a series of passing plays. With only a few minutes remaining on the clock, Cardiff won a corner kick and from the cross, and Len Davies tapped the ball <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>net</b> to put them ahead. The game finished with the score two goals to one in Cardiff City's favour. Several charities benefited from the proceeds of the match, including the King Edward VII's Hospital for Officers and the National Institute for the Blind.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} to Birmingham, Doyle soon linked up with Championship club Nottingham Forest on a short-term loan deal in December 2004. The loan was then extended {{to keep him}} at the City Ground {{for the rest of}} the season. Doyle made his first-team debut for Forest in a fifth-round FA Cup tie against Tottenham Hotspur on 20 February 2005. As the match approached half-time, Doyle gifted Tottenham the lead as a Jermain Defoe free kick bounced out of his hands and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>net,</b> but Forest were able to equalise in the second half to take the tie to a replay. Even though Doyle only played in a further three league matches for Forest, he said he was glad to be able to play regular reserve-team football and the loan spell had exceeded his expectations. He was rumoured to be {{returning to}} Forest on loan for the following season, a move which did not occur.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{entered the}} {{competition}} in the third round, receiving a bye as a Premier League club. Their opening match was a 2–0 home win against Oxford United on 4 January 2003. Bergkamp scored his 100th goal for the club and an own goal by defender Scott McNiven ensured progression to the next round. Arsenal faced non-league side Farnborough Town but the match switched from Farnborough's ground at Cherrywood Road to Highbury due to concerns over safety. Farnborough as the home team began the match in disastrous fashion, conceding a goal scored by Campbell in the 19th minute, and going down to ten men after Christian Lee was sent off for a professional foul. Francis Jeffers scored twice before Rocky Baptiste added a consolation, beating Cygan for pace and despite having his first shot saved by goalkeeper Taylor, he managed to lift the ball over him and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>net.</b> Lauren and Bergkamp each scored in the final 15 minutes to give Arsenal a 5–1 victory.|$|E
5|$|Both teams {{started with}} attacking play, with Brazilian Marcelo's shot going wide {{in the third}} minute and German Sami Khedira's shot in the seventh minute being {{inadvertently}} blocked by his teammate Toni Kroos. In the 11th minute, the Germans scored from their first corner of the game. Thomas Müller escaped his marker, David Luiz, in the penalty box, and Toni Kroos's delivery found him wide open for a side-footed shot <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>net.</b> In the following minutes Brazil tried to respond but their attacks came to nothing; although Philipp Lahm needed to deliver a brilliant tackle to keep Marcelo from setting up a chance in the penalty box. Instead, in the 23rd minute, Germany scored again after Kroos and Müller combined to set up Miroslav Klose, who scored on the rebound after his initial shot was saved by goalkeeper Júlio César. It was Klose's 16th goal at a World Cup, passing the Brazilian Ronaldo as the all-time World Cup top scorer.|$|E

5|$|During Euro 2008, new Dutch manager Marco van Basten {{changed the}} side's {{formation}} to 4–2–3–1, preferring the midfield trio of Rafael van der Vaart, Wesley Sneijder and Dirk Kuyt, with Robben left to battle {{for a position}} with Robin van Persie on the wing. In the group match against France, which the Netherlands won 4–1, Robben was brought on at half-time. He dragged {{the ball out of}} reach of a defender near the half-way line and paced his way ahead of three defenders, then crossed straight to Van Persie, who powered a shot into the goal past France goalkeeper Grégory Coupet. At 2–0, Thierry Henry scored a goal for France, making it 2–1, but almost directly after the restart, Robben was played through by Sneijder and he ran at the France goal and was forced into an acute angle, but despite the angle, he shot the ball <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>net</b> past Coupet.|$|E
5|$|Eleven goaltenders {{have scored}} {{a total of}} {{fourteen}} goals in National Hockey League (NHL) games. A goalkeeper can score by either shooting the puck <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>net,</b> or being awarded the goal as the last player on his team to touch the puck when an opponent scored an own goal. A goal scored by shooting the puck is particularly challenging as the goaltender has to aim for a six-foot-wide net that is close to 180 feet away, while avoiding opposing defencemen; {{in the case of}} own goals, the combined circumstance of the own goal itself in addition to the goaltender being the last player to touch the puck makes it a very rare occurrence. Of the fourteen goals, seven were scored by shooting the puck and seven were the result of own goals.|$|E
5|$|For {{the second}} {{consecutive}} season, the Penguins played the Detroit Red Wings in the Stanley Cup Finals, marking {{the first time in}} 25years that two teams played each other in consecutive Finals. Tickets for Games 3 and 4, which were hosted at Mellon Arena, sold out in 10minutes. In {{the first game of the}} series, the Red Wings scored the first goal when a puck shot by Brad Stuart ricocheted off the boards behind the goal, then bounced off Marc-Andre Fleury and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>net.</b> Ruslan Fedotenko, with an assist from Evgeni Malkin, tied the game before the conclusion of the first period. Detroit went on to score a goal in each of the final two periods to win Game 1, 3–1. Evgeni Malkin scored a powerplay goal in the first period of game two, but the Penguins were held scoreless for the remainder of the contest; falling 3–1 for a second consecutive game.|$|E

5|$|Having {{recovered}} from his broken ankle {{in time for}} the 1941–42 season, Richard returned to the QSHL Canadiens, with whom he played 31 games and recorded 17 points before he was again injured. He suffered a broken wrist after becoming entangled with a defenceman and crashed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>net.</b> Richard rejoined the team for the playoffs. The skills he demonstrated in the QSHL, combined with the NHL parent club's loss of players to the war and struggles to draw fans due to its poor record and a lack of francophone players, earned Richard a tryout with the Canadiens for the 1942–43 season. He signed a contract worth $3,500 for the year and, wearing sweater number 15, made his NHL debut with the team. Richard's first goal was against the New York Rangers on November 8, 1942.|$|E
5|$|In the 77th minute, Keenor, Ferguson and Davies {{passed the}} ball among {{themselves}} before playing it wide to Thirlaway. Ferguson {{ran to the}} centre and the ball was crossed towards him.

It looked like Cardiff were about to go ahead, however, a last minute tackle by Alfred Bower prevented Ernie Curtis from scoring, giving the Welsh team another corner. The ball was fired towards the goal mouth, and was shot into the goal from close range by Davies putting Cardiff ahead. The final two attacks of the game were both by Cardiff, with Russell saving a header by Ferguson and then Curtis firing the ball over the crossbar.|$|E
