5000|$|The {{dry line}} {{typically}} advances eastward {{during the afternoon}} and retreats westward at night, mainly due to the increased mixing down {{to the surface of}} moist air aloft, rather than the air mass' surface density contrast. The movement of the dry line during daylight hours is quickest in areas where low level moisture is most shallow, as dryline movement slows in areas with deeper low-level moisture. Weaker winds aloft also slow its progression. [...] However, a strong storm system can sweep the dry line eastward into the Mississippi Valley or Texas/Louisiana border, regardless of the time of day. Stronger dry line passages result in a sharp drop in dew point, clearing skies, and a wind shift from south or south-easterly to west <b>or</b> south-westerly. <b>Blowing</b> <b>dust</b> and rising temperatures also may follow, especially if the dry line passes during the daytime. These changes occur in reverse order when the dry line retreats westward during the evening and nighttime hours. Severe and sometimes tornadic thunderstorms often develop along the slope-reversal zone east of the surface dry line, especially when it begins moving eastward.|$|R

40|$|On 8 July 1989, a {{very strong}} {{microburst}} was detected by the Low-Level Windshear Alert System (LLWAS), within the approach corridor just north of Denver Stapleton Airport. The microburst was encountered by a Boeing 737 - 200 in a "go-around" configuration which {{was reported to have}} lost considerable air speed and altitude during penetration. Data from LLWAS revealed a pulsating microburst with an estimated peak velocity change of 48 m/s. Wilson et al. (1991) reported that the microburst was accompanied by no apparent visible clues such as rain <b>or</b> virga, although <b>blowing</b> <b>dust</b> was present. Weather service hourly reports indicated virga in all quadrants near the time of the event. A National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) research Doppler radar was operating; but according to Wilson et al., meaningful velocity could not be measured within the microburst due to low radar-reflectivity factor and poor siting for windshear detection at Stapleton...|$|R
60|$|And the Cossar {{children}} {{left that}} great house unfinished, a mere hole of foundations {{and the beginning}} of a wall, and sulked back to their big enclosure. After a time the hole was filled with water and with stagnation and weeds, and vermin, and the Food, either dropped there by the sons of Cossar <b>or</b> <b>blowing</b> thither as <b>dust,</b> set growth going in its usual fashion. Water voles came out over the country and did infinite havoc, and one day a farmer caught his pigs drinking there, and instantly and with great presence of mind--for he knew: of the great hog of Oakham--slew them all. And from that deep pool it was the mosquitoes came, quite terrible mosquitoes, whose only virtue was that the sons of Cossar, after being bitten for a little, could stand the thing no longer, but chose a moonlight night when law and order were abed and drained the water clean away into the river by Brook.|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of the chemical transport model REM/CALGRID (RCG), {{that focuses on the}} EU framework directive species (i. e., O_ 3, CO, SO_ 2, NO_ 2 and PM 10) and target time scales (i. e., hour, day, year) is described. The premise was to design a Eulerian grid model of medium complexity that can be used on the regional, as well as the urban, scale for short-term and long-term simulations of oxidant and aerosol formation. Model evaluation was performed along two lines: Comparison of RCG results with measurements of the years 1995, 1997 and 1999, and with the results of other models. Overall, the model is able to reproduce the observed regional pattern of ozone, NO_ 2 and the aerosol components quite well. PM 10 is underestimated in summer probably because the current aerosol treatment does not include the formation of secondary organic aerosols and because the emissions data base does not include biogenic sources <b>or</b> wind <b>blown</b> <b>dust</b> from agricultural sources and natural surfaces. The comparison of the RCG results with the results of other models of two model intercomparison studies shows that the RCG medium complexity model is performing very well in comparison to other models. The model was applied to two European wide emissions scenarios, which describe the expected situation in 2005, respectively 2010. According to the calculations it cannot be expected for 2010 that Germany will be in compliance with all limit values described in the EU-daughter directives. (orig.)

40|$|Using VLT/SPHERE {{near-infrared}} dual-band {{imaging and}} integral field spectroscopy we discovered an edge-on debris disk around the 17 Myr old A-type {{member of the}} Scorpius-Centaurus OB association HD 110058. The edge-on disk {{can be traced to}} about 0. 6 " or 65 AU projected separation. In its northern and southern wings, the disk shows at all wavelengths two prominent, bright and symmetrically placed knots at 0. 3 " or 32 AU from the star. We interpret these knots as a ring of planetesimals whose collisions may produce most of the dust observed in the disk. We find no evidence for a bow in the disk, but we identify a pair of symmetric, hook-like features in both wings. Based on similar features in the Beta Pictoris disk we propose that this wing-tilt asymmetry traces either an outer planetesimal belt that is inclined with respect to the disk midplane <b>or</b> radiation-pressure-driven <b>dust</b> <b>blown</b> out from a yet unseen, inner belt which is inclined with respect to the disk midplane. The misaligned inner or outer disk may be a result of interaction with a yet unseen planet. Overall, the disk geometry resembles the nearby disk around Beta Pictoris, albeit seen at smaller radial scales. Comment: 13 pages, 3 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{the variability of}} <b>blowing</b> <b>dust</b> weather frequency (BDWF) and patterns in climatic factors over Baicheng for the period 1951 - 2006 in this study. The data showed that <b>blowing</b> <b>dust</b> over Baicheng occurs intensively during the spring and shows significant inter-decadal variability. One of the main findings is that the occurrence of <b>blowing</b> <b>dust</b> has significantly decreased after the mid- 1980 s. The mean wind speed (WS), diurnal temperature range (DTR), relative humidity (RH) and precipitation at Baicheng during the spring show decreasing trends. The decreasing trends of the mean WS and DTR are significant at 99 % confidence levels according to the t-test; the dataset also indicated a sharp decrease in WS occurred after the mid- 1980 s. The mean surface air temperature (SAT) escalated in a fluctuating manner during 1951 - 2006. BDWF at Baicheng {{was significantly related to}} local WS, SAT and DTR during the spring [correlation coefficients (CCs) are 0. 41, - 0. 47 and 0. 36, respectively]. The correlation between BDWF at Baicheng and selected climatic factors over the sand-dust source regions and transmission paths were also calculated. We found that BDWF is well correlated to the mean WS and SAT during the spring, with CCs of 0. 45 and - 0. 48, respectively. The most likely causes for the dramatic decrease observed in BDWF after the mid- 1980 s were related to the adjustment of large-scale circulation patterns in response to a decrease of meridional temperature differences, the weakening of steering westerlies and the strengthening of downward motions that has occurred at the middle latitudes of eastern Eurasia in recent decades...|$|R

40|$|AbstractHourly dust {{data was}} {{collected}} in Lubbock, Texas, from January 1, 2003, to January 1, 2008. Diurnal patterns of dust concentration were computed by averaging hourly values associated with a given time of day for all days within the 5 -yr sampling period. Results suggest that the overall diurnal pattern is characterized by relatively high dust concentrations {{during the day and}} relatively low values at night and in the early morning. Diurnal patterns of <b>blowing</b> <b>dust</b> are influenced by daily variations of key climatic factors. Generally, one finds relatively strong winds during the day and lighter winds at night. The morning increase in wind speed is associated with the rising sun, which produces thermal instability and enhances the mixing of high momentum winds from the upper levels of the atmosphere to the surface layer. Solar radiation can also reduce the critical threshold by drying the soil surface. Diurnal patterns of <b>blowing</b> <b>dust</b> were also computed separately {{for each of the four}} seasons. The most conspicuous change of the diurnal pattern occurred in the summer where the difference between peak afternoon values and early morning values was considerably less than that of other seasons...|$|R
