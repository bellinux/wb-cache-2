California State University, Los Angeles, 2012 Committee members: Katherine Roberts, Donald Johnson, Joseph PetersonAdhesives, ATR-FTIR, Decorative Art, Forensic Science, Glitter, GlueThe {{analysis}} of 78 decorative art adhesive samples {{was performed by}} attenuated total reflectance infrared spectrometry (ATR-FTIR) {{for the purpose of}} determining variation between and within decorative art adhesives across various manufacturers. Decorative art adhesives were allowed to cure at ambient temperature prior to sampling. Adhesives that included glitter were separated from each other prior to analysis. Analysis was conducted with an infrared spectrometer using a diamond crystal ATR accessory with minimal sample preparation. The IR spectra show a pattern of vibrational frequencies in the 1500 cm - 1 and 600 cm - 1 range, and at 1700 cm - 1, and 3000 cm - 1 for all decorative art adhesives. The results indicate variations occur between and within the ten adhesives classes evaluated across several manufacturers. The similarity between manufacturers was only apparent for the <b>glitter</b> <b>paint</b> adhesives. The spectral data presented for each adhesive allows for pattern recognition in criminal cases in addition to providing applications in other scientific fields.

5000|$|... ===Paint=== Paint was an {{important}} concern. Once bodywork was done, the cars were painted unusual colors. Transparent but wildly colored candy-apple paint, applied atop a metallic undercoat, and metalflake <b>paint,</b> with aluminum <b>glitter</b> within candy-apple <b>paint,</b> appeared in the 1960s. These took many coats to produce a brilliant effect - which in hot climates {{had a tendency to}} flake off. This process and style of paint job was invented by Joe Bailon, a customizer from Northern California.|$|R
5000|$|Massimo Freccia {{published}} an autobiography, The Sounds of Memory, in 1990 {{when he was}} 84, in which he expressed candid views on other conductors. Most of them, he wrote, were too conceited, mistrustful and even occasionally vicious. Sir Thomas Beecham, for instance, [...] "emphasised his pomposity" [...] by his poses and pretensions. [...] "Not once have I been touched by his performances. I always found his artistry superficial." [...] Herbert von Karajan was [...] "not a nice man". Leopold Stokowski produced a lush sound, yet [...] "one {{had the feeling that}} underneath there was something false. His speech was particularly affected... He gave the impression of a <b>glittering,</b> multi-coloured <b>painted</b> shell; when one looked inside one found an infinite emptiness." [...] Only Toscanini escaped savage censure, although Freccia conceded that his reputation for strict observance of the score was a myth.|$|R

She would go to New York--and study--and work, oh, so hard--and go abroad--and work harder--and win success--and be great and admired and famous--if only Aunt Rebecca--ah! if only Aunt Rebecca! Jane Lavinia sighed. There was spring in the world and spring in Jane Lavinia's heart; but a chill came with the thought of Aunt Rebecca, who {{considered}} tidies and afghans nicer than her pictures.|$|R
60|$|As {{soon as he}} was out of the station, his {{troubles}} began again. A veil seemed to have been torn from before his eyes. Just as in London every face into which he had looked, every building which he had passed, had seemed to him unfamiliar, appealing to an altered system of impressions, so here, during that brief walk, a new disgust was born in him. The showy-looking main street with its gingerbread buildings, all new and <b>glittering</b> with <b>paint,</b> appalled him. The larger villas--self-conscious types all reeking with plaster and false decorations--set him shivering. He turned into his own street and his heart sank. Something had indeed touched his eyes and he saw new and terrible things. The row of houses looked as though they had come out of a child's playbox. They were all untrue, shoddy, uninviting. The waste space on the other side of the unmade street, a repository for all the rubbish of the neighborhood, brought a groan to his lips. He stopped before the gate of his own little dwelling. There were yellow curtains in the window, tied back with red velvet. Even with the latch of the gate in his hand, he hesitated. A child in a spotted velveteen suit and a soiled lace collar, who had been playing in the street, greeted him with an amazed shout and then ran on ahead.|$|R
50|$|In 2010 Hixon {{made the}} first <b>Glitter</b> YES <b>painting</b> for a party and {{the mood in the}} room was unusually joyous. Art dealer, Latifa Metheny of Tria Gallery couldn’t help but notice and offered her a solo show on the spot. Sparkle {{followed}} in April 2010, an exhibition of paintings featuring words, punctuation, flowers, and fireworks. This show was a near sellout and another show, Scintilla followed a few months later at the same space on West 25th St in Chelsea, NYC. Tastemakers Bob and Cortney Novogratz took notice by acquiring two pieces for their townhouse in the West Village and featuring her art on two episodes of the internationally syndicated HGTV show Home by Novogratz. Hixon’s work was also featured on the nationally syndicated Wendy Williams show in 2011. Hixon has since exhibited glitter paintings in Singapore and on three separate occasions in Japan with Giant Mango Gallery as well as in Austria and Germany with Velvinoir Gallery. Shows and works on view in the U.S. include Los Angeles at Bergamot Station with Frank Pictures Gallery, Dallas, Texas at Gallery Noir, San Francisco with Stephanie Breitbard Fine Art and Washington D. C. at Dalton Pratt. Her museum shows include the American Textile Museum, Lowell Massachusetts, The Lyman Allyn Museum of Art, New London Connecticut, and The Cornell Museum of Art, Delray Beach, Florida.|$|R
5000|$|McCleary {{began making}} collages in the 1970s. In a 2009 {{interview}} in The Houston Chronicle she states: [...] "I was a print maker all through school, and when I {{got out of}} college and started teaching, my work shifted, because for the first time I wasn't accountable to a teacher. Somehow the work evolved over a number of years, and I started gluing three-dimensional items onto my collages — cut-paper things that almost look like advent calendars." [...] Over the years, as her work became more figurative, the collages became [...] "more complex and more detailed — the idea being to draw the viewer in, to give the viewer something to look at." [...] McCleary has used a variety of materials, including <b>paint,</b> <b>glitter,</b> foil, wire, mirrors, nails, glass, and other objects on heavy paper, to create her collages.|$|R
6000|$|With such {{unconscious}} intervals the monotonous {{procession of}} blue skies, glittering sunshine, brief twilights, and starlit nights passed over Red Gulch. Miss Mary grew fond of {{walking in the}} sedate and proper woods. Perhaps she believed, with Mrs. Stidger, that the balsamic odors of the firs [...] "did her chest good," [...] for certainly her slight cough was less frequent and her step was firmer; perhaps she had learned the unending lesson which the patient pines are never weary of repeating to heedful or listless ears. And so one day she planned a picnic on Buckeye Hill, and took the children with her. Away from the dusty road, the straggling shanties, the yellow ditches, the clamor of restless engines, the cheap finery of shop-windows, the deeper <b>glitter</b> of <b>paint</b> and colored glass, and the thin veneering which barbarism takes upon itself in such localities, what infinite relief was theirs! The last heap of ragged rock and clay passed, the last unsightly chasm crossed,--how the waiting woods opened their long files to receive them! How the children--perhaps because they had not yet grown quite away from the breast of the bounteous Mother--threw themselves face downward on her brown bosom with uncouth caresses, filling the air with their laughter; and how Miss Mary herself-- felinely fastidious and intrenched as {{she was in the}} purity of spotless skirts, collar, and cuffs--forgot all, and ran like a crested quail at the head of her brood, until, romping, laughing, and panting, with a loosened braid of brown hair, a hat hanging by a knotted ribbon from her throat, she came suddenly and violently, {{in the heart of the}} forest, upon the luckless Sandy! ...|$|R
5000|$|On a yellow-orange background, {{the large}} {{painting}} (8 {{feet high and}} 6 feet wide) depicts a black woman wearing a blue robe, a traditional attribute of the Virgin Mary. The work employs mixed media, including oil <b>paint,</b> <b>glitter,</b> and polyester resin, and also elephant dung, map pins and collaged pornographic images. The central Black Madonna is surrounded by many collaged images that resemble butterflies at first sight, but on closer inspection are photographs of female genitalia; an ironic reference to the putti that appear in traditional religious art. A lump of dried, varnished elephant dung forms one bared breast, and the painting is displayed leaning against the gallery wall, supported by two other lumps of elephant dung, decorated with coloured pins: the pins on the left are arranged to spell out [...] "Virgin" [...] and {{the one on the}} right [...] "Mary". Many other works by Ofili in this period - including No Woman No Cry - incorporate elephant dung, particularly as supports for the canvas, inspired by a period that Ofili spent in Zimbabwe.|$|R
40|$|Fluorescent {{effects have}} been {{observed}} for thousands of years. Stokes, in 1852, began the science of fluorescence culminating in his law of fluorescence, which explained that fluorescence emission occurs at longer wavelengths than the excitation wavelength. This phenomenon is observed extensively in the art world. Daylight fluorescent colors known as Day-Glo have become an artistic medium since the 1960 s. Modern artists exploit these saturated and brilliant colors to <b>glitter</b> their <b>painting.</b> Multispectral imaging as a noninvasive technique {{has been used for}} archiving by museums and cultural-heritage institutions for about a decade. The complex fluorescence phenomenon has been often ignored in the multispectral projects. The ignored fluorescence results in errors in digital imaging of artwork containing fluorescent colors. The illuminant-dependency of the fluorescence radiance makes the fluorescence colorimetry and consequently spectral imaging more complex. In this dissertation an abridged imaging bi-spectrometer for artwork containing both fluorescent and non-fluorescent colors was developed. The method developed included two stages of reconstruction of the spectral reflected radiance factor and prediction of the fluorescent radiance factor. The estimation of the reflected radiance factor as a light source independent component was achieved by imaging with a series of short-wavelength cutoff filters placed in the illumination path. The fluorescent radiance factor, a light source dependent component, was estimated based on a proposed model, the abridged two-monochromator method. The abridged two-monochromator method was developed for reconstructing the bi-spectral matrix of a fluorescent color based on a calibrated UV-fluorescence imaging. In this way, one could predict the fluorescence radiance factor under any desired illuminant and consequently a better color evaluation and rendering could be obtained. Furthermore, this method easily fitted in a general system for spectral imaging of paintings containing both fluorescent and non-fluorescent colors. The abridged two-monochromator method could predict fluorescent radiance factor of a fluorescent color via prediction of the true emission and the number of absorbed quanta by a fluorescing specimen for a given viewing light source. The superiority of the abridged fluorescence spectral imaging to the traditional spectral and colorimetric imaging for a few light sources was confirmed using fluorescent and non-fluorescent targets. Additionally, an exploratory visual experiment using a paired-comparison method was performed to evaluate the performance of the abridged fluorescence spectral imaging in comparison to the traditional spectral and colorimetric imaging for rendering images of a reference painting. The abridged fluorescence spectral imaging had better performance than traditional spectral and colorimetric imaging in rendering images for daylight...|$|R
