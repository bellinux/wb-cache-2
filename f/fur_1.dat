40|$|Primary {{resistance}} in Candida albicans to flucytosine (5 -FC) {{was investigated in}} 25 strains by identifying and sequencing the genes FCA 1, <b>FUR</b> <b>1,</b> FCY 21, and FCY 22, which code for cytosine deaminase, uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (UPRT), and two purine-cytosine permeases, respectively. These proteins are involved in pyrimidine salvage and 5 -FC metabolism. An association between a polymorphic nucleotide and resistance to 5 -FC was found within <b>FUR</b> <b>1</b> where the substitution of cytidylate for thymidylate at nucleotide position 301 results in the replacement of arginine with cysteine at amino acid position 101 in UPRT. Isolates that are homozygous for this mutation display increased levels of resistance to 5 -FC, whereas heterozygous isolates have reduced susceptibility. Three-dimensional protein modeling of UPRT suggests that the Arg 101 Cys mutation disturbs the quaternary structure of the enzyme, which is postulated to compromise optimal enzyme activity. A single resistant isolate, lacking the above polymorphism in <b>FUR</b> <b>1,</b> has a homozygous polymorphism in FCA 1 that results in a glycine-to-aspartate substitution at position 28 in cytosine deaminase...|$|E

40|$|AbstractHere we {{describe}} a novel set of peptidergic neurons conserved throughout all developmental {{stages in the}} Drosophila central nervous system (CNS). We show that a small complement of 28 apterous-expressing cells (Ap-let neurons) in the ventral nerve cord (VNC) of Drosophila larvae co-express numerous gene products. The products include the neuroendocrine-specific bHLH regulator called Dimmed (Dimm), four neuropeptide biosynthetic enzymes (PC 2, <b>Fur</b> <b>1,</b> PAL 2, and PHM), and a specific dopamine receptor subtype (dDA 1). For the PC 2, <b>Fur</b> <b>1,</b> and PAL 2 enzymes, and for the dDA 1 receptor, this neuronal pattern represents {{the vast majority of}} their total expression in the VNC. In addition, while Dimm and PHM are present in the peritracheal Inka cells in larvae, pupae, and adults, Ap, PC 2, <b>Fur</b> <b>1,</b> PAL 2, and dDA 1 are not. PC 2, PAL 2, and DA 1 receptor expression were all controled by both dimm and ap. Previous genetic analysis of animals deficient in PC 2 revealed an abnormal larval ecdysis phenotype. Together, these data support the hypothesis that the small cohort of Ap-let interneurons regulates larval ecdysis behavior by secretion of an unidentified amidated peptide(s). This hypothesis further predicts that the production of the Ap-let neuropeptide(s) is dependent on each of four specific enzymes, and that a certain aspect(s) of its production and/or release is regulated by dopamine input...|$|E

40|$|The iron-directed, {{coordinate}} {{regulation of}} genes {{depends on the}} fur (ferric uptake regulator) gene product, which acts as an iron-responsive, transcriptional repressor protein. To investigate the biological function of a fur homolog in the dissimilatory metal-reducing bacterium Shewanella oneidensis MR- 1, a fur knockout strain (<b>FUR</b> <b>1)</b> was generated by suicide plasmid integration into this gene and characterized using phenotype assays, DNA microarrays containing 691 arrayed genes, and two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Physiological studies indicated that <b>FUR</b> <b>1</b> {{was similar to the}} wild-type strain when they were compared for anaerobic growth and reduction of various electron acceptors. Transcription profiling, however, revealed that genes with predicted functions in electron transport, energy metabolism, transcriptional regulation, and oxidative stress protection were either repressed (ccoNQ, etrA, cytochrome b and c maturation-encoding genes, qor, yiaY, sodB, rpoH, phoB, and chvI) or induced (yggW, pdhC, prpC, aceE, fdhD, and ppc) in the fur mutant. Disruption of fur also resulted in derepression of genes (hxuC, alcC, fhuA, hemR, irgA, and ompW) putatively involved in iron uptake. This agreed with the finding that the fur mutant produced threefold-higher levels of siderophore than the wild-type strain under conditions of sufficient iron. Analysis of a subset of the <b>FUR</b> <b>1</b> proteome (i. e., primarily soluble cytoplasmic and periplasmic proteins) indicated that 11 major protein species reproducibly showed significant (P < 0. 05) differences in abundance relative to the wild type. Protein identification using mass spectrometry indicated that the expression of two of these proteins (SodB and AlcC) correlated with the microarray data. These results suggest a possible regulatory role of S. oneidensis MR- 1 Fur in energy metabolism that extends the traditional model of Fur as a negative regulator of iron acquisition systems...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Suicide {{gene therapy}} with FCY 1 gene, {{encoding}} cytosine deaminase (CD), together with <b>FUR</b> <b>1,</b> encoding uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (UPRT), {{has been proposed}} for pancreatic cancer therapy in vivo. We ascertained whether gene therapy with FCY 1 -FUR 1 is effective in killing pancreatic cancer cells after 5 -fluorocytosine (5 -FC) treatment. Methods: AsPC 1, BxPC 3, Capan 1, MIA PaCa 2, and Panc 1 cell lines were transfected using 2 plasmid vectors expressing CD only (pRSV-CD) or the chimera CD-UPRT (pRSV-CD-UPRT). Control and pRSV-CD- or pRSV-CD-UPRT-transfected cell lines were treated with 0, 0. 1, 0. 5, 1, 5, and 10 mM of 5 -FC for 1, 3, 6, 8, 10, and 13 days. Results: FCY 1 alone did not confer sensitivity to 5 -FC. The CD-UPRT-transfected BxPC 3 and Panc 1 were sensitive to very low 5 -FC doses (0. 1 mM). 5 -Fluorocytosine-sensitive transfected cell lines rapidly converted 5 -FC into 5 -fluorouracil, whereas the 5 -FC resistant cell lines had an impaired 5 -FC conversion. Conclusions: Suicide gene therapy with the FCY 1 gene alone was ineffective {{in the treatment of}} pancreatic cancer in vitro. The pRSV-CD-UPRT construct conferred 5 -FC sensitivity to some pancreatic cancer cell lines. Therefore, the application in vivo of suicide gene therapy with FCY 1 alone or in combination with the <b>FUR</b> <b>1</b> gene is probably destined to fail...|$|E

40|$|Mutants {{resistant}} to 5 -fluorouracil, 5 -fluorocytosine, and 5 -fluorouridine were selected in yeast, and {{the mechanisms of}} their resistance were investigated. The investigated mutations map in seven different loci. (i) A mutation at the locus FUI 1 gives specifically resistance to 5 -fluorouridine. (ii) Two loci {{are involved in a}} specific 5 -fluorocytosine resistance: a mutation at locus FCY 1 produces a loss of cytosine deaminase activity; a mutation at locus FCY 2 results in the loss of the activity of a cytosine-specific permease. (iii) A mutation at the locus FUR 4 gives a simultaneous resistance to 5 -fluorouracil and to 5 -fluorouridine by loss in the activity of the uracil-specific permease. (iv) We found three types of mutants in the locus <b>FUR</b> <b>1.</b> One is dominant and weakly {{resistant to}} 5 -fluorouracil, 5 -fluorocytosine, and 5 -fluorouridine. The two others are recessive and are unable to catalyze one of the steps involved in uracil transformation into uridine 5 ′-monophosphate; this block-age explains their strong resistance to 5 -fluorouracil and 5 -fluorocytosine. Of these two mutants, one is resistant to 5 -fluorouridine and the other is not. (v) Mutations at locus FUR 2 give resistance to 5 -fluorouracil, 5 -fluorocytosine, and 5 -fluorouridine. These mutations are dominant and lead to a loss in the feedback regulation of the aspartic transcarbamylase activity by uridine triphosphate.
