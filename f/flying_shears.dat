Centrifugal Flying Shear {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{advanced}} equipments, which is widely used in tandem mill production lines because of its simple structure and high shearing precision.

40|$|AbstractIncreasing {{demands for}} {{transporting}} {{oil and natural}} gas promote the developing and production of high-grade pipeline steel. The hot rolling is a vital process to produce the steel plate of pipe fabrication. In a hot rolling line, a <b>flying</b> <b>shear</b> is used to shear the leading and trailing edges of a rough rolled plate. In the present research, three-dimensional FE model of <b>flying</b> <b>shear</b> was built on ABAQUS/Explicit, considering the motions of blades. The feeding rollers and shear blades are considered as rigid material, and the steel plate adopts elastic-plastic material model. Ductile damage criterion for X 100 steel was built to simulate the material damage and fracture during the shear processing. By the simulation, the plastic deformation, the damage initiation and evolution, the fracture of steel plate can be obtained, which are coincided to production practise. The stroke-force curves of blades were generated from the FE simulation. The shearing force varying with the blade stroke was analyzed. FE simulation shows that the calculated force from FE model is much lower than that from empirical equation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, the {{shear force}} in the {{shearing}} process of the drum type linear blade flying shear is done. Two different approaches were taken to establish the shear force formula, and then the finite element simulation. The comparison results of the calculated values and simulated values {{can be seen that}} as the thickness increases, the maximum shear force calculated by the pure shear force formula increases rapidly, the shear force calculated by the energy release rate formula is relatively small, and the finite element simulation values and calculated values close to each other when the plate thickness is small. The derived formula in this paper not only can be applied to complex engineering problems, but also has provided a theoretical basis for drum type linear blade <b>flying</b> <b>shears</b> on the shear force calculations and equipment design...|$|E

50|$|The rods {{were cut}} into 22-foot lengths {{as they leave}} the last stand {{by means of a}} <b>flying</b> <b>shear.</b> The Savannah rods were air cooled to room {{temperature}} on the cooling bed and then were cold straightened in a Medart Straightener. Rods to be beta heat treated by-pass the cooling bed and were lifted into the beta heat treating furnace by means of a hoist, to be held at 1,320-1,365 °F for 11-20 minutes and then quenched in cold water. After quenching, these rods were conveyed to the Medart straightener for straightening. The rods were located in -inch Acme-Gridley automatic screw machines where slugs were cut from the rods. The Hanford slugs were then placed in the Heald machine, which cuts the slugs to desired lengths and finishes and radiuses the ends. The Savannah River slugs were reduced to exact dimensions of size, surface, and straightness on a centerless grinder after which a contour was placed on the surface by a thread rolling machine. The slugs were numbered and put on a basket on a conveyor that passes through a degreasing tank, pickling tank, two rinse tanks and a hot air dryer before depositing the slug basket in the Inspection Department. The slugs were inspected for seams, striations, dimensions and handling defects with the good slugs being packed for shipment.|$|R
50|$|Burgess' anchor mode is {{the product}} of {{alternative}} evolution on Earth, predicated on the assumption that, had the creatures of the Burgess Shale survived the Cambrian period, evolution might never have given rise to chordates. Shale is populated by hivers, such as Burgess, and evolved versions of many other creatures, such as giant land crabs, giant Hallucigenia, land-bound Marella, and giant Anomalocaris. Most of the creatures of this mode seem largely predatory in nature. For example, the beach area is populated by <b>shears,</b> <b>flying</b> creatures with scissor-like beaks that attack in swarms, and the ground of the plains area conceals huge carnivorous underground worms. Hivers such as Burgess appear to be the only creatures that have created a form of civilization.|$|R

40|$|Within the DLR-project “Wetter & Fliegen“ a {{feasibility}} study of airborne lidar sensors for active control at <b>flying</b> through wind <b>shear</b> and turbulent air masses (specifically wake vortices) was carried out. The main goal of such sensors is delivering sufficiently precise real-time {{measurements of the}} wind field in a short range {{in front of an}} aircraft under clear air conditions up to cruising speed at every altitude, so that a dangerous disturbance in terms of turbulent air motion at an encounter can be alleviated by an active control system with an automatic feed-forward controller. So far, no realized lidar sensor meets the requirements with regard to accuracy, rapidity and spatial resolution of wind measurements necessary for active control. For this reason, we investigate the potential of two suited systems by means of simulations including the physical properties of lidars and atmosphere: a Fringe-Imaging(FI) Doppler Wind Lidar (DWL) similar to the one developed within the project AWIATOR and a Backscatter Lidar (BL) for wind measurements. Though a totally new optical design might be necessary for the latter device to operate at a sufficiently high spatial resolution, the signal processing offers wind components in the y- and z-directions (transversal to the aircraft’s propagation axis x) in very short time. From the results of DWL and BL simulations {{it turns out to be}} advisable to combine a Fringe-Imaging DWL for the xcomponent measurements with a BL for the y- and z-component measurements...|$|R
