The <b>health</b> <b>care</b> plan <b>that</b> Members of Congress use indexes benefits to <b>health</b> <b>care</b> inflation, not the consumer price index.

25|$|From ancient times, Christian {{emphasis}} on practical charity {{gave rise to}} the development of systematic nursing and hospitals and the Catholic Church today remains the largest non-government provider of medical services in the world. Advanced industrial countries (with the exception of the United States) and many developing countries provide medical services through a system of universal <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>that</b> aims to guarantee care for all through a single-payer health care system, or compulsory private or co-operative health insurance. This is intended to ensure that the entire population has access to medical care on the basis of need rather than ability to pay. Delivery may be via private medical practices or by state-owned hospitals and clinics, or by charities, most commonly by a combination of all three.|$|E
25|$|Cultural {{norms and}} {{practices}} {{are two of}} the main reasons why gender disparities in health exist and continue to persist. These cultural norms and practices often influence the roles and behaviors that men and women adopt in society. It is these gender differences between men and women, which are regarded and valued differently, that give rise to gender inequalities as they work to systematically empower one group and oppress the other. Both gender differences and gender inequalities can lead to disparities in health outcomes and access to health care. Some of the examples provided by the World Health Organization of how cultural norms can result in gender disparities in health include a woman's inability to travel alone, which can prevent them from receiving the necessary <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>that</b> they need. Another societal standard is a woman's inability to insist on condom use by her spouse or sex partners, leading to a higher risk of contracting HIV.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{impact of}} hypersegregation {{can be found}} in the health of the {{residents}} of certain areas. Poorer inner-cities often lack the <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>that</b> is available in outside areas. That many inner-cities are so isolated from other parts of society also is a large contributor to the poor health often found in inner-city residents. The overcrowded living conditions in the inner-city caused by hypersegregation means that the spread of infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, occurs much more frequently. This is known as [...] "epidemic injustice" [...] because racial groups confined in a certain area are affected much more often than those living outside the area.|$|E
2500|$|Scientific {{research}} has not supported {{the existence of}} qi, meridians, or yin and yang. A Nature editorial described TCM as [...] "fraught with pseudoscience", {{with the majority of}} its treatments having no logical mechanism of action. Quackwatch states that [...] "TCM theory and practice are not based upon the body of knowledge related to health, disease, and <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>that</b> has been widely accepted by the scientific community. TCM practitioners disagree among themselves about how to diagnose patients and which treatments should go with which diagnoses. Even if they could agree, the TCM theories are so nebulous that no amount of scientific study will enable TCM to offer rational care." ...|$|E
2500|$|Health {{advocacy}} encompasses direct {{service to}} the individual or family as well as activities that promote health and {{access to health care}} in communities and the larger public. [...] Advocates support and promote the rights of the patient in the health care arena, help build capacity to improve community health and enhance health policy initiatives focused on available, safe and quality care. Health advocates are best suited to address the challenge of patient-centered care in our complex healthcare system. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) defines patient-centered care as: <b>Health</b> <b>care</b> <b>that</b> establishes a partnership among practitioners, patients, and their families (when appropriate) to ensure that decisions respect patientsâ€™ wants, needs, and preferences and that patients have the education and support they need to make decisions and participate in their own care. Patient-centered care {{is also one of the}} overreaching goals of health advocacy, in addition to safer medical systems, and greater patient involvement in healthcare delivery and design.|$|E

2500|$|Dr Sam Coulter-Smith, a {{consultant}} in {{obstetrics and gynaecology}} and a university master in the Rotunda Hospital, {{one of the largest}} maternity hospitals in Ireland, said that it would be preferable to introduce legislation to bring in clarity, saying, [...] "We really do need legislation in this area, otherwise we're going to be at risk of doctors working outside the law, and that's not appropriate." [...] Dr Rhona Mahony, Master of the National Maternity Hospital, said: [...] "It is very disappointing that, 20 years after the 'X-Case', we don't have legislation" [...] and that women [...] "need to know {{that they are going to}} get the appropriate <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>that</b> they need" [...] while doctors [...] "need to know that they are also protected in their ability to do their job." [...] Peter Boylan, of the Irish Institute of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said: [...] "The current situation is like a sword of Damocles hanging over us. If we do something with a good intention, but it turns out to be illegal, the consequences are extremely serious for medical practitioners." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{effective}} compliance {{date of the}} Privacy Rule was April 14, 2003, with {{a one-year}} extension for certain [...] "small plans". The HIPAA Privacy Rule regulates the use and disclosure of Protected Health Information (PHI) held by [...] "covered entities" [...] (generally, health care clearinghouses, employer sponsored health plans, health insurers, and medical service providers that engage in certain transactions.) By regulation, the Department of Health and Human Services extended the HIPAA privacy rule to independent contractors of covered entities who fit within the definition of [...] "business associates". PHI is any information held by a covered entity that concerns health status, provision of health care, or payment for <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>that</b> {{can be linked to}} an individual. This is interpreted rather broadly and includes any part of an individual's medical record or payment history. Covered entities must disclose PHI to the individual within 30 days upon request. They also must disclose PHI when required to do so by law such as reporting suspected child abuse to state child welfare agencies.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2013, the California Department of Managed Health Care levied a $4 million fine, {{the second}} largest in the agency's history, against Kaiser for not {{providing}} adequate mental health care to its patients. Alleged violations of California's timely access laws included failures to accurately track wait times and track doctor availability amid evidence of inconsistent electronic and paper records. It was also found by the DMHC that patients received written materials circulated by Kaiser dissuading them from seeking care, a violation {{of state and federal}} laws. [...] DMHC also issued a cease and desist order for Kaiser to end the practices. DMHC conducted a follow up investigation which published in April 2015. [...] The report found Kaiser had put systems in place to better track how patients were being cared for, but still had not addressed problems with actually providing mental <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>that</b> complied with state and federal laws. [...] Kaiser's challenges on this front were exacerbated by a long, unresolved labor dispute with the union representing therapists.|$|E

2500|$|Concepts of {{the body}} and of disease used in TCM have notions of a pre-scientific culture, similar to European humoral theory. TCM is {{characterized}} as full of pseudoscience. Some practitioners no longer consider yin and yang and the idea of an energy flow to apply. Scientific investigation has not found any histological or physiological evidence for traditional Chinese concepts such as qi, meridians, and acupuncture points. It is a generally held belief within the acupuncture community that acupuncture points and meridians structures are special conduits for electrical signals but no research has established any consistent anatomical structure or function for either acupuncture points or meridians. The scientific evidence for the anatomical existence of either meridians or acupuncture points is not compelling. Stephen Barrett of Quackwatch writes that, [...] "TCM theory and practice are not based upon the body of knowledge related to health, disease, and <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>that</b> has been widely accepted by the scientific community. TCM practitioners disagree among themselves about how to diagnose patients and which treatments should go with which diagnoses.
