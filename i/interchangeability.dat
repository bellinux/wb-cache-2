5|$|Many {{elements}} can {{be considered}} as tributes to the power of cinema. In the prison theater, the inmates watch the film Gilda (1946), but this scene was originally intended to feature The Lost Weekend (1945). The <b>interchangeability</b> of the films used in the prison theater suggests that it is the cinematic experience and not the subject which is key to the scene, allowing the men to escape the reality of their situation. Immediately following this scene, Andy is assaulted by the Sisters in the projector room and uses a film reel to help fight them off. Then in the end of the film, Andy passes through a movie poster to escape his cell and ultimately Shawshank.|$|E

25|$|Alternatively, a {{rail network}} {{comprises}} only narrow-gauge network could also eliminate the <b>interchangeability</b> problem.|$|E
25|$|Standardization and <b>interchangeability</b> {{have been}} cited as major {{contributors}} to the exceptional growth of the U.S. economy.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{emergence}} of new currencies in Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei, the <b>Interchangeability</b> Agreement which the three countries adhered to as original members of the currency union meant the Malaysian dollar was exchangeable at par with the Singapore dollar and Brunei dollar. This ended on 8 May 1973, when the Malaysian government withdrew from the agreement. The Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Brunei Currency and Monetary Board still maintain the <b>interchangeability</b> of their two currencies, as of 2009.|$|E
25|$|While {{there is}} some <b>interchangeability,</b> the {{alternative}} energy sources available tend to depend on whether the fuel is being used in static or mobile applications.|$|E
25|$|Both FeO and γ-Fe2O3 have {{a similar}} cubic close packed array of oxide ions and this {{accounts}} for the ready <b>interchangeability</b> between the three compounds on oxidation and reduction as these reactions entail a relatively small change to the overall structure. Fe3O4 samples can be non-stoichiometric.|$|E
25|$|While the {{imposition}} of only one town form regardless of region {{could be seen as}} an imposition of imperial authority, there is no doubting the practical reasoning behind the formation of the Roman grid. Under Roman guidance, the grid was designed for efficiency and <b>interchangeability,</b> both facilitated by and aiding the expansion of their empire.|$|E
25|$|Solutions to <b>interchangeability</b> {{problems}} of transshipment are bogie exchange between cars, a rollbock system, variable gauge, dual gauge, or even gauge conversion. European standard gauge trains normally use buffers and chain couplers, {{which do not}} allow such tight curves, a main reason to have narrow gauge. Therefore, narrow-gauge trains normally use other couplers, which makes bogie exchange meaningless.|$|E
25|$|Cadillac was {{the first}} volume {{manufacturer}} of a fully enclosed car in 1906. Cadillac participated in the 1908 <b>interchangeability</b> test in the United Kingdom, and was awarded the Dewar Trophy for the most important advancement {{of the year in}} the automobile industry. In 1912, Cadillac {{was the first}} automobile manufacturer to incorporate an electrical system enabling starting, ignition, and lighting.|$|E
25|$|The <b>interchangeability</b> of the {{equation}} may be represented by a triangle, where V (voltage) {{is placed on the}} top section, the I (current) is placed to the left section, and the R (resistance) is placed to the right. The line that divides the left and right sections indicate multiplication, and the divider between the top and bottom sections indicates division (hence the division bar).|$|E
25|$|As of 2016, the Singapore {{dollar is}} the twelfth most traded {{currency}} {{in the world}} by value. Apart from its use in Singapore, the Singapore dollar is also accepted as customary tender in Brunei according to the Currency <b>Interchangeability</b> Agreement between the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Autoriti Monetari Brunei Darussalam (Monetary Authority of Brunei Darussalam). Likewise, the Brunei dollar is also customarily accepted in Singapore.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to new vehicles and figures—such as Spy Magician (M13X & M14X)—Takara {{introduced a new}} class of figure dubbed the Titans which employed a magnetic ball/joint system that allowed for a new level of <b>interchangeability</b> between toys. Japanese pop-culture character tie-in toys were also released—such as Microman Jeeg, Robotman Gakeen and Robotman Mechadon—which helped expand Takara’s line beyond its own in-house characters and opened the door to greater licensing opportunities for their designs.|$|E
25|$|The International Electrotechnical Commission publishes {{standard}} 60269 for low-voltage power fuses. The {{standard is}} in four volumes, which describe general requirements, fuses for industrial and commercial applications, fuses for residential applications, and fuses to protect semiconductor devices. The IEC standard unifies several national standards, thereby improving the <b>interchangeability</b> of fuses in international trade. All fuses of different technologies tested to meet IEC standards will have similar time-current characteristics, which simplifies design and maintenance.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} General Motors {{purchased}} {{the company in}} 1909, Cadillac had already established itself as one of America's premier luxury carmakers. The complete <b>interchangeability</b> of its precision parts had allowed it to {{lay the foundation for}} the modern mass production of automobiles. It was at the forefront of technological advances, introducing full electrical systems, the clashless manual transmission and the steel roof. The brand developed three engines, with its V8 setting the standard for the American automotive industry.|$|E
25|$|The two {{different}} engine models {{compatible with the}} 787 use a standard electrical interface to allow an aircraft to be fitted with either Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 or General Electric GEnx engines. This <b>interchangeability</b> aims to save time and cost when changing engine types; while previous aircraft could exchange engines for those of a different manufacturer, the high cost and time required made it rare. In 2006, Boeing addressed reports of an extended change period by stating that the 787 engine swap was intended to take 24 hours.|$|E
25|$|The Hayabusa {{has been}} one of the top choices for streetbike customization, perhaps even the most popular {{customized}} sportbike. One reason may be the unique, instantly recognizable bodywork. The easy tunability of the engine, the wide selection of aftermarket parts, possibly more than any other Japanese motorcycle, and the <b>interchangeability</b> between models of Suzuki parts have also played a role. It was the vibrancy of this custom scene that prompted Suzuki to send Koji Yoshirua to the US for feedback and inspiration for the second generation design.|$|E
25|$|The {{expansion}} of BUA's long-haul flying programme — both scheduled and non-scheduled — {{resulted in an}} order for a third VC10 in early May 1965. Technically, BUA took over an order Ghana Airways had cancelled. Practically, {{this meant that the}} aircraft was built to BUA's specifications featuring the same cargo door {{on the left side of}} the forward fuselage as its sister aircraft, thereby ensuring fleet <b>interchangeability.</b> This aircraft was delivered on 31 July 1965. It entered service in a single-class configuration featuring 127, rear-facing seats to be primarily used for long-haul trooping flights.|$|E
25|$|The {{first model}} {{railways}} were not built {{to any particular}} scale and were more like toys than miniature representations of the full size prototype. Eventually, the authenticity of models grew and benefits of standardization became more obvious. The most significant and the most basic area of standardization was the model track gauge. At first, certain gauges became de facto standards in hobbyist and manufacturer circles. While the first unofficial standard gauges made <b>interchangeability</b> possible, the rolling stock were still only a rough approximation of the full scale prototype.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} hundred {{years or so}} of its history, the theatre was {{primarily}} a playhouse, with the Letters Patent granted by Charles II giving Covent Garden and Theatre Royal, Drury Lane exclusive rights to present spoken drama in London. Despite the frequent <b>interchangeability</b> between the Covent Garden and Drury Lane companies, competition was intense, often presenting the same plays at the same time. Rich introduced pantomime to the repertoire, himself performing (under the stage name John Lun, as Harlequin) and a tradition of seasonal pantomime continued at the modern theatre, until 1939.|$|E
25|$|Also of key {{importance}} to communist units was the <b>interchangeability</b> of the 7.62mm ammunition between the AK-47 {{and other types}} of weapons including the SKS carbine and the Soviet RPD light machine gun, another standard infantry weapon of the VC/NVA, capable of 650 rounds per minute. Heavier machine guns were sometimes used but often in set piece assaults, or in fixed mode such as anti-aircraft weapons, due to their weight. Communist units also employed mortars frequently, with the Soviet 82mm and its Chinese variants being the most common. French 60mm mortars also saw some use.|$|E
25|$|In 1988, Gunpei Yokoi and {{his team}} at Nintendo R {{conceived}} the new Game Boy handheld system, {{with the purpose of}} merging the two very successful ideas of the Game & Watch's portability along with the NES's cartridge <b>interchangeability.</b> Nintendo released the Game Boy in Japan on 21 April 1989, and in North America on 31 July 1989. Nintendo of America president Minoru Arakawa managed a deal to bundle the popular third party game Tetris along with the Game Boy, and the pair launched as an instant success.|$|E
25|$|<b>Interchangeability</b> {{of certain}} ULDs between LD3/6/11 {{aircraft}} and LD2/8 aircraft is possible when cargo {{needs to be}} quickly transferred to a connecting flight. Both LD2s and LD8s can be loaded in LD3/6/11 aircraft, but {{at the cost of}} using internal volume inefficiently (33ft3 wasted per LD2). Only the LD3 of the LD3/6/11 family of ULDs can be loaded in a 767; it will occupy an entire row where two LD2s or one LD8 would otherwise have fit (90ft3 wasted per LD3). Policies vary from airline to airline as to whether such transfers are allowed.|$|E
25|$|Maudslay left Bramah's {{employment}} {{and set up}} his own shop. He was engaged to build the machinery for making ships' pulley blocks for the Royal Navy in the Portsmouth Block Mills. These machines were all-metal and were the first machines for mass production and making components {{with a degree of}} <b>interchangeability.</b> The lessons Maudslay learned about the need for stability and precision he adapted to the development of machine tools, and in his workshops he trained a generation of men to build on his work, such as Richard Roberts, Joseph Clement and Joseph Whitworth.|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} ratings of {{plug and socket}} in BS546, (2A, 5A, 15A and 30A). Each has the same general {{appearance}} but they are different physical sizes to prevent <b>interchangeability,</b> they use pin spacing which is also different from the two pin plugs specified in BS 372, so earthed plugs will not fit into unearthed sockets, and vice versa. Plugs fitted with BS646 fuses have been optional since the original BS546:1934 with maximum fuse ratings of 2A in the 2A plug, and 5A in the 5A, 15A and 30A plugs. In practice most BS546 plugs are unfused with fused versions being unusual and expensive.|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} time in {{commercial}} aviation, both engine types will have a standard interface with the aircraft, allowing any 787 to be fitted with either a GE or Rolls-Royce engine at any time as long as the pylon is also modified. Engine <b>interchangeability</b> makes the 787 a more flexible asset to airlines, allowing them to change from one manufacturer's engine to the other's in light of any future engine developments which conform more closely to their operating profile. The cost of such a change would require a significant operating cost difference between the two engine types to make it economical - a difference that does not exist with the engines today.|$|E
25|$|Across the Meteor's {{production}} life, various {{different companies}} were subcontracted to manufacture aircraft sections and major components; {{due to the}} wartime workload on producing fighter aircraft such as the Hawker Hurricane and Hawker Typhoon, neither Gloster nor the wider Hawker Siddeley Group were able to internally meet the production demand of 80 aircraft per month. Bristol Tramways produced the forward fuselage of the aircraft, the Standard Motor Company manufactured the central fuselage and inner wing sections, the Pressed Steel Company produced the rear fuselage, and Parnall Aircraft made the tail unit. Other main subcontractors included Boulton Paul Aircraft, Excelsior Motor Radiator Company, Bell Punch, Turner Manufacturing Company, and Charlesworth Bodies; {{as many of these}} firms had little or no experience producing aircraft, both quality and <b>interchangeability</b> of components were maintained by contractually enforced adherence to Gloster's original drawings.|$|E
25|$|In 1900, Bertrand Russell {{published}} a critical study of Leibniz's metaphysics. Shortly thereafter, Louis Couturat {{published a}}n important study of Leibniz, and edited {{a volume of}} Leibniz's heretofore unpublished writings, mainly on logic. They made Leibniz somewhat respectable among 20th-century analytical and linguistic philosophers in the English-speaking world (Leibniz had already been of great influence to many Germans such as Bernhard Riemann). For example, Leibniz's phrase salva veritate, meaning <b>interchangeability</b> without loss of or compromising the truth, recurs in Willard Quine's writings. Nevertheless, the secondary literature on Leibniz did not really blossom until after World War II. This {{is especially true of}} English speaking countries; in Gregory Brown's bibliography fewer than 30 of the English language entries were published before 1946. American Leibniz studies owe much to Leroy Loemker (1904–1985) through his translations and his interpretive essays in LeClerc (1973).|$|E
25|$|The Yankee was {{originally}} designed to minimize the number of airframe parts used, {{with the aim of}} simplifying production and saving money. As a result of this philosophy many parts were interchangeable. Due to the use of a non-tapered tubular spar, which doubled as the fuel tank, and the lack of wing washout, the wings could be exchanged left and right. The fin and horizontal stabilizers were interchangeable, as were the rudder and the elevators. The ailerons and flaps were similarly the same part. While it did succeed in making production easier, this design philosophy produced many aerodynamic compromises in the design. For instance, because the flaps were the same part as the ailerons they were too small to be effective as flaps. The lack of wing washout, necessitated by the wing <b>interchangeability</b> requirement, meant that stall strips had to be installed to produce acceptable stall characteristics for certification. Over time this philosophy of compromising the aerodynamics in favour of a minimized parts count was abandoned. For example, the redesign of the AA-1B into the AA-1C by Gulfstream involved wider-span elevators and horizontal stabilizers that produced better longitudinal stability, but were no longer interchangeable with the rudder and fin.|$|E
25|$|In the 19th century, the {{connection}} between heat and mechanical energy was established quantitatively by Julius Robert von Mayer and James Prescott Joule, who measured the mechanical equivalent of heat in the 1840s. In 1849, Joule published results from his series of experiments (including the paddlewheel experiment) which show that heat {{is a form of}} energy, a fact that was accepted in the 1850s. The relation between heat and energy was important for the development of steam engines, and in 1824 the experimental and theoretical work of Sadi Carnot was published. Carnot captured some of the ideas of thermodynamics in his discussion of the efficiency of an idealized engine. Sadi Carnot's work provided a basis for the formulation of the first law of thermodynamics—a restatement of the law of conservation of energy—which was stated around 1850 by William Thomson, later known as Lord Kelvin, and Rudolf Clausius. Lord Kelvin, who had extended the concept of absolute zero from gases to all substances in 1848, drew upon the engineering theory of Lazare Carnot, Sadi Carnot, and Émile Clapeyron–as well as the experimentation of James Prescott Joule on the <b>interchangeability</b> of mechanical, chemical, thermal, and electrical forms of work—to formulate the first law.|$|E
25|$|The {{experience}} of the War of 1812 led the War Department to issue a request for contract proposals for firearms with interchangeable parts. Previously, parts from each firearm had to be carefully custom fitted; almost all infantry regiments necessarily included an artificer or armorer who could perform this intricate gunsmithing. The requirement for interchangeable parts forced forward the development of modern metal-working machine tools, including milling machines, grinders, shapers and planers. The Federal Armories perfected the use of machine tools by developing fixtures to correctly position the parts being machined and jigs to guide the cutting tools over the proper path. Systems of blocks and gauges were also developed to check the accuracy and precision of the machined parts. Developing the manufacturing techniques for making interchangeable parts by the Federal Armories took over two decades; however, the first interchangeable small arms parts were not made to {{a high degree of}} precision. It wasn't until mid century or later that parts for U.S. rifles and handguns could be considered truly interchangeable with a degree of precision. In 1853 when the British Parliamentary Committee on Small Arms questioned gun maker Samuel Colt, and machine tool makers James Nasmyth and Joseph Whitworth, there was still some question about what constituted <b>interchangeability</b> and whether it could be achieved at a reasonable cost.|$|E
500|$|... {{since some}} of the values were paired {{relative}} to their origin, using the raw option counts would overcount the number of permutations, due to <b>interchangeability</b> within the pairing. The option counts need to be divided by the permuted size of their grouping (2), here 2!.= 2 (See n Choose k) The pair in each row cancels the 2s for the B2 option counts, leaving a B2 contribution of 33×63. The B2×B3 combined contribution is 33×66.|$|E

500|$|The {{opening line}} of the song Min'na saikō arigatō, K-k-k-kawaii, k-k-k-kawaii, is a {{reference}} to the Japanese Kawaii culture. Kawaii is Japanese for [...] "cute", and the word is popularly used to describe endearing physical characterizations in Manga and Japanese video games. She was later asked about the double meaning of the song, on account of the <b>interchangeability</b> of the sexual euphemisms 'kitty' and 'pussy', to which she responded, [...] "Obviously it's flirtatious and somewhat sexual, but it's genuinely about my love for Hello Kitty as well." [...] Additionally, she said at MuchMusic Awards, [...] "It's really fun [...] it's about a slumber party and loving the kitty." ...|$|E
500|$|On 27 June 2007, {{the governments}} of Singapore and Brunei celebrated the 40th anniversary of the Currency <b>Interchangeability</b> Agreement (an {{agreement}} allowing citizens of both countries to use currency from either nation interchangeably) by issuing commemorative $20 notes, that are yellow, 149 × 72mm in size, and made of polymer. The obverse of the Singaporean version {{is similar to the}} current Portrait Series, whereas the obverse of the Brunei version is similar to the $50 and $100 of the 2004 series. [...] The reverses are almost identical except that the Brunei version has their state title in Jawi script, while the Singaporean version has the state title of Brunei in Latin script.|$|E
