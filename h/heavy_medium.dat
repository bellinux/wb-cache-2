500|$|The {{preceding}} Nevada-class battleships {{represented a}} leap forward from previous American battleship technology and from most contemporary foreign designs. They {{were the first}} in the world to employ the [...] "all or nothing" [...] armor scheme that characterized every succeeding American battleship. Devised with the knowledge that engagement ranges between battle fleets was growing greater as main battery sizes increased, the system moved away from previous designs that used <b>heavy,</b> <b>medium,</b> and light armor, in favor of using only heavy armor to protect vital areas on the ship. The new system envisioned that, at long ranges, ships would be attacked with only armor-piercing (AP) projectiles, stoppable only by heavy armor. Medium or light armor would only serve to detonate the shells. By removing gun turrets and reducing the overall protected length of the ship, the navy's designers were able to devote the weight savings to the belt, as well as extra deck armor to protect against plunging shells.|$|E

He also praised {{the game for}} delivering a sense of progression and offering players motivation to finish the game, {{as well as the}} narrative for [...] "intertwining with geography of Yharnam". However, he criticized the game's non-divergent class system, as well as the specialization, as he stated that [...] "lack of magic, miracles, pyromancy, archery, <b>heavy,</b> <b>medium,</b> and light options discourages experimentation." [...] He also criticized the game for always forcing players to upgrade and stock weapons only in certain sections of the game.|$|E
