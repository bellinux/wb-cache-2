40|$|Dielectric {{relaxation}} {{analysis was}} carried out on the main chain thermotropic liquid crystalline copolyesteramide Vectra B 950. The dielectric spectra of Vectra B 950 show four relaxations, instead of three as cited in the literature. These correspond, from high to low temperature, to the glass transition, the rotation of <b>hydroxynaphthoic</b> <b>acid</b> moieties, the rotation of terephthalic acid moieties, and the combined rotation of terephthalic acid and aminophenol moieties. The combination of TSD and DMA analysis {{made it possible to}} distinguish between dipole and charge relaxations. Although the TSD and the dielectric results compare well for the low-temperature dipole relaxations, they are not directly comparable for the alpha relaxation. TSD experiments reveal that free charges have a significant influence on the cl relaxation. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Alcaligenes sp. strain PPH degrades {{phenanthrene}} via 1 -hydroxy- 2 -naphthoic acid (1 -H 2 NA), 1, 2 -dihydroxynaphthalene (1, 2 -DHN), {{salicylic acid}} and catechol. Enzyme activity versus growth profile and heat stability studies suggested {{the presence of}} two distinct hydroxylases, namely 1 -hydroxy- 2 -naphthoic acid hydro- xylase and salicylate hydroxylase. 1 -Hydroxy- 2 -naphthoic acid hydroxylase was partially purified (yield 48 %, fold 81) and {{found to be a}} homodimer with a subunit molecular weight of $ 34 kDa. The enzyme was yellow in color, showed UV-visible absorption maxima at 274, 375 and 445 nm, and fluorescence emission maxima at 527 nm suggested it to be a flavoprotein. The apoenzyme prepared by the acid-ammonium sulfate (2 M) dialysis method was colorless, inactive and lost the characteristic flavin absorption spectra but regained $ 90 % activity when reconstituted with FAD. Extraction of the prosthetic group and its analysis by HPLC suggests that the holoenzyme contained FAD. The enzyme was specific for 1 -H 2 NA and failed to show activity with any other <b>hydroxynaphthoic</b> <b>acid</b> analogs or salicylic acid. The Km for 1 -H 2 NA in the presence of either NADPH or NADH remained unaltered (72 and 75 mM, respectively), suggesting dual specificity for the coenzyme. The Km for FAD was determined to be 4. 7 mM. The enzyme catalyzed the conversion of 1 -H 2 NA to 1, 2 -DHN only under aerobic conditions. These results suggested that 1 -hydroxy- 2 -naphthoic acid hydroxylase is a flavo- protein monooxygenase specific for 1 -H 2 NA and different from salicylate- 1 - hydroxylase. No Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|The optical microstructures of thin {{sections}} of two liquid crystalline polymers are {{examined in the}} polarizing microscope. The polymers are random copolyesters based on hydroxybenzoic and <b>hydroxynaphthoic</b> <b>acids</b> (B-N), and hydroxybenzoic acid and ethylene terephthalate (B-ET). Sections cut from oriented samples, so as to include the extrusion direction, show microstructures {{in which there is}} no apparent preferred orientation of the axes describing the local optical anisotropy. The absence of preferred orientation in the microstructure, despite marked axial alignment of molecular chain segments as demonstrated by X-Ray diffraction, is interpreted in terms of the polymer having biaxial optical properties. The implication of optical biaxiality is that, although the mesophases are nematic, the orientation of the molecules is correlated about three (orthogonal) axes over distances greater than a micron. The structure is classified as a multiaxial nematic...|$|R
40|$|Pseudomonas sp. strain PPD can metabolize {{phenanthrene}} as {{the sole}} source of carbon and energy via the 'phthalic acid' route. The key enzyme, 1 -hydroxy- 2 -naphthoic acid dioxygenase (1 -HNDO, EC 1. 13. 11. 38), was purified to homogeneity using a 3 -hydroxy- 2 -naphthoic acid (3 -H 2 NA) -affinity matrix. The enzyme was a homotetramer with a native molecular mass of 160 kDa and subunit molecular mass of ~ 39 kDa. It required Fe(II) as the cofactor and was specific for 1 -hydroxy- 2 -naphthoic acid (1 -H 2 NA), with Km 13. 5 占and Vmax 114 ?孯l min- 1 mg- 1. 1 -HNDO failed to show activity with gentisic acid, salicylic <b>acid</b> and other <b>hydroxynaphthoic</b> <b>acids</b> tested. Interestingly, the enzyme showed substrate inhibition with a Ki of 116 卮 1 -HNDO {{was found to be}} competitively inhibited by 3 -H 2 NA with a Ki of 24 卮 Based on the pH-dependent spectral changes, the enzyme reaction product was identified as 2 -carboxybenzalpyruvic acid. Under anaerobic conditions, the enzyme failed to convert 1 -H 2 NA to 2 -carboxybenzalpyruvic acid. Stoichiometric studies showed the incorporation of 1 mol O 2 into the substrate to yield 1 mol product. These results suggest that 1 -HNDO from Pseudomonas sp. strain PPD is an extradiol-type ring-cleaving dioxygenase. No Full Tex...|$|R
