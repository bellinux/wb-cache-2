40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) carried out a refined {{exposure}} assessment of <b>ethyl</b> <b>lauroyl</b> <b>arginate</b> (LAE) from its use as a food additive, for children and adults, based on revised proposed uses. Refined exposure estimates have been calculated with revised proposed use levels and individual food consumption data from the EFSA Comprehensive Database, according to five different scenarios. The anticipated dietary exposure to LAE for scenario 1, in which the use of LAE is estimated for all four proposed food categories, ranges from 0. 02 to 0. 13 mg/kg bw/day at the mean, and from 0. 07 to 0. 44  mg/kg bw/day at the 95 th percentile. Therefore, the 95 th percentile of exposure for all population groups is below the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of 0. 5  mg/kg bw/day. In all surveys and population groups, the main contributor to the total anticipated dietary exposure to LAE is preserved meat...|$|E
40|$|This PhD {{dissertation}} thesis {{has been}} {{focus on the}} development and characterization of antimicrobial packaging films based on the incorporation in the polymer matrix or on the attachment to the film surface of naturally occurring antimicrobial compounds {{with the purpose of}} inhibiting the proliferation of microorganisms and extend the microbiological shelf life of packaged food products. The studied active films are based on the use of ethylene vinyl copolymers (EVOH) containing 29 % (EVOH 29) or 44 % (EVOH 44) molar percentage of ethylene as polymeric vehicle for the incorporation of several antimicrobial compounds -oregano essential oil (OEO), citral, <b>ethyl</b> <b>lauroyl</b> <b>arginate</b> (LAE), epsilon-polylysine (EPL), green tea extract (GTE) and lysozyme. These antimicrobial agents have been incorporated in the film-forming solution or immobilized to the film surface by covalent bonding. Prior to the preparation of the active films, the antimicrobial activity of the selected compounds against selected microorganism was demonstrated, confirming that they could be good candidates to be used as preservatives for active food packaging applications, and an alternative to synthetic additives. The effect of the incorporation of the antimicrobial agents on relevant functional properties of the developed EVOH films was studied. In general, the polymer properties as materials for food packaging were not relevantly affected. In order to evaluate the potential of EVOH matrices as sustain release systems of active compounds, the release kinetics of the active compounds from the film to different media was evaluated; for that the agent release rate and extend into food simulants was monitored, and it was concluded that the agent concentration, release temperature, type of EVOH, interaction of EVOH with the food simulant, and the solubility of the active compound in the release media were the main controlling factors. EVOH matrices have also shown good properties to be used for the attachment of active molecules. In this regard, lysozyme was successfully immobilized on the film surface of EVOH. Several experiments were conducted to determine the antimicrobial properties of the resulting films in vitro against different microorganisms responsible for foodborne illness and in vivo with real foods –minimally-process salad, infant milk, surimi sticks and chicken stock- to enhance their preservation. All the materials presented a strong in vitro antimicrobial activity. Although the results obtained through in vivo tests showed activity reductions caused by food matrix effects, all materials presented significant microbial inhibition and, therefore, great potential {{to be used in the}} design of active food packaging. They can be applied as an inner coating of the packaging structure, releasing the active agent or acting by direct contact, producing a great protection against contamination with a prolongation of the microbiological food shelf life.

40|$|Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a {{ubiquitous}} {{gram-negative bacterium}} capable of forming a biofilm on living and non-living surfaces, which frequently leads to undesirable consequences. We found that <b>lauroyl</b> <b>arginate</b> <b>ethyl</b> (LAE), a synthetic non-oxidizing biocide, inhibited biofilm formation by P. aeruginosa at a sub-growth inhibitory concentration under both static and flow conditions. A global transcriptome {{analysis was conducted}} using a gene chip microarray to identify the genes targeted by LAE. In response to LAE treatment, P. aeruginosa cells up-regulated iron acquisition and signaling genes and down-regulated iron storage genes. LAE demonstrated the capacity to chelate iron in an experiment in which free LAE molecules were measured by increasing the ratio of iron to LAE. Furthermore, compared to untreated cells, P. aeruginosa cells treated with LAE exhibited enhanced twitching motility, a phenotype that is usually evident when the cells are starved for iron. Taken together, these results imply that LAE generated iron-limiting conditions, and in turn, blocked iron signals necessary for P. aeruginosa biofilm development. As destroying or blocking signals leading to biofilm development would be {{an efficient way to}} mitigate problematic biofilms, our findings suggest that LAE can aid in reducing P. aeruginosa biofilms for therapeutic and industrial purposes...|$|R
40|$|High {{pressure}} processing (HPP) {{is becoming}} increasingly popular in commercial food processing as it offers great potential within the food industry. The popularity of the technology {{is driven by the}} need to provide minimally processed foods which are safe, wholesome and have extended shelf-life that challenge traditional methods of food processing. High pressures of upto 900 MPa can be used to kill or inhibit microorganisms without changing the nutritional and sensory properties of the food. However, the inherent high resistances of bacterial endospores and food enzymes are the major challenges for the broader application of HPP. Therefore, a hurdle approach is almost axiomatic for significant widespread use of HPP in commercial food processing. Therefore, several antimicrobial compounds have been used in conjunction with HPP in a hurdle approach to improve the overall quality of the products. <b>Ethyl</b> <b>lauroyl</b> <b>arginate</b> (LAE) has not been investigated in combination with HPP. LAE is a novel antimicrobial compound derivative of lauric acid, L-arginine and ethanol, all of which are naturally occurring substances. LAE can extend the shelf-life of products due to its antimicrobial action on spoilage microorganisms during refrigerated storage. Therefore, the objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the effects of HPP and LAE on the shelf-life of ready-to-eat (RTE) cooked chicken breast roast during storage at 4 °C for 16 weeks. The RTE cooked chicken breast roast was prepared using portions (samples) of freshly marinated chicken breasts, which were cooked to an internal temperature of 75 °C for 5 minutes, and then cooled (4 °C), sliced (60 mm) and vacuum-packaged. The study was conducted in two phases, each carried out for 16 weeks. The first phase comprised of fourteen unique treatments which were screened by microbial and instrumental analysis. Based on the results of the first phase, five treatments were selected for further work. Similar tests were carried on these treatments, in addition to sensory evaluation. The effects of HPP at 450 MPa and 600 MPa pressures at 1 min, 3. 5 min and 5 min hold times respectively, on the shelf-life of RTE sliced chicken breast roast were studied for 16 weeks during storage at 4 °C. HPP in combination with LAE (200 ppm) was also investigated using similar treatment pressures, hold times and storage conditions. The effects of LAE (200 ppm & 315 ppm) alone on the shelf life of RTE sliced chicken breast roast was studied for 16 weeks when stored at 4 °C. RTE sliced chicken breast roast samples without any preservative and/or HPP treatment served as the controls. Aerobic plate counts (APCs), lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and yeasts and moulds (Y&M) were analyzed in five samples from each of the treatments at regular intervals for upto 16 weeks. Instrumental analyses of color and texture were also conducted on the samples to determine any significant changes during storage at 4 °C. Five sample treatments were selected after screening and evaluated by consumer sensory analysis using a 9 -point hedonic scale. Analyses for APCs, LAB, Y&M, color and texture were also conducted on the selected samples during refrigerated storage. Survival analysis methodology was used to estimate the consumer sensory shelf-life of the selected treatments at 25 % and 50 % rejection probability. The results showed the potential of using HPP to extend the microbiological and consumer sensory quality of the products. Samples treated with HPP alone, and HPP in combination with LAE (200 ppm) at 600 MPa inhibited the growth of APCs for 16 weeks when stored at 4 °C. However, there was no significant (P> 0. 05) difference in the microbial shelf-life of samples treated with 200 ppm or 315 ppm LAE. No significant (P> 0. 05) changes in color and texture were detected in all the treatments. Further, no LAB or Y&M were detected in all the sample treatments for the entire storage period at 4 °C. Samples treated with HP at 600 MPa for 1 min and 5 min, HPP+LAE (200 ppm) at 600 MPa for 1 min, LAE at 200 and 315 ppm were evaluated by a consumer sensory panel at different storage times. The results of the consumer sensory analysis showed no changes in color, texture, flavour and freshness of the HP-treated and HPP+LAE (200 ppm) -treated samples. LAE-treated (200 and 315 ppm) samples were not acceptable by a consumer panel at week 12. A maximum sensory shelf-life of > 16 weeks at 50 % and 13. 8 weeks at 25 % rejection probability was obtained for samples treated with HPP at 600 MPa for 1 min. Therefore, samples treated at 600 MPa for 1 min had stable sensory properties and were well-accepted by a consumer panel. Also, the samples had good microbiological quality...|$|E
