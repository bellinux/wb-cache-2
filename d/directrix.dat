For any hyperbola, the ratio of distances from a point Z to a focus A and to the <b>directrix</b> is a fixed constant called the eccentricity. The two directrices intersect at a point T, and from their two known distance ratios, Newton constructs a line passing through T on which Z must lie. However, the ratio of distances TZ/TA is also known; hence, Z also lies on a known circle, since Apollonius had shown that a circle {{can be defined as}} the set of points that have a given ratio of distances to two fixed points. (As an aside, this definition is the basis of bipolar coordinates.) Thus, the solutions to Apollonius' problem are the intersections of a line with a circle.|$|E

These general results are applied to backscattering from cylinders with conical section <b>directrixes</b> (circle, parabola, ellipse and hyperbola), and a number of new compact explicit equations are derived, especially for elliptic and hyperbolic cylinders illuminated at an arbitrary incidenc...|$|R

40|$|The present work {{deals with}} the teacherâs {{formation}} in the rural area of the State of CearÃ, focusing on the teacherâs ideal of the Normal School of Juazeiro do Norte having as topic of research the newspaper O Lavrador during 1934 through 1974, a period that corresponds to {{the early years of}} functioning of that School until its closing. This research found that the foundation of that educational institution had as its main goal to make available to the students a rural education because this objective is directly realated to the historical valorization of the agriculture by the northeastern rural agrarian elite, as a vital way to achieve the progress after 1930 Revolution. The aims of this research were: 1) Set up the commented chronology of the school in order to allow a reflexive appreciation of its trajectory. 2) Understand the pedagogical bases of the school, focusing on the rural thought and the support of the New School <b>directrixes.</b> 3) Try to identify and to analyse the changings and the continuities in the formation proposals of the teachers through the 113 issues published during the period of time mentioned above(1934 - 1974). We used historic and printed sources, these undestood in their multiple possibilities of materialization, cross reference and interpretation, using as an universe of search 113 editions of the O Lavrador, once this newspaper was published for this very school, and distributed by it {{in the first year of}} his foundation. We tried to show the results obtained in the contents examining, emphasizing the attention given by that paper on subjects related to the agricultural workerâs life, main events and pedagogical pactices of the school and the divers articles written by the very students. The five decades studied in which the paper existed, allowed us to delimitate de differences and we were able to identify the following features: 1) 1930 â it was the beginning and also the golden era of the school showing the prestige and the notoriety of the Pedagogical Ruralism had in the education of CearÃ State; 1940 â the continuity of the previous decade with intense activities; 3) 1950 â is remembered as the time of the publication of many speeches on Ruralims and the celebration of the birthday of Mrs. AmÃlia; 4) 1960 â it is the beginning of the decline of the issuing of the newspaper and 5) 1970 â it is the end of the school due to the lack of the rural spirit that animate the school during its entire life. The trajectory of the paper was one of deep finnancial difficulties. The word âfightâ is always linked to the celebration of the anniversary of the paper as a demonstration of the finnancial difficulties faced by that institution. Trata da formaÃÃo docente no meio rural cearense, enfocando o ideal de professor formado na Escola Normal Rural de Juazeiro do Norte tendo como objeto de pesquisa o Jornal O Lavrador, no perÃodo de 1934 Ã 1974, que compreende os primeiros anos do seu funcionamento e atÃ o fechamento desse Estabelecimento de Ensino. Evidencia que o surgimento da referida Escola, baseia-se no propÃsito de oferecer aos seus alunos uma educaÃÃo rural, teve relaÃÃo estreita com o momento histÃrico de valorizaÃÃo da agricultura pela elite agrÃria e nordestina, como meio indispensÃvel para a conquista do progresso, apÃs a RevoluÃÃo de 1930. Os objetivos desta pesquisa foram: 1) TraÃar a cronologia comentada da Escola, possibilitando uma reflexÃo de sua trajetÃria; 2) Compreender as bases pedagÃgicas da Escola, enfocando o pensamento ruralista e o apoio das diretrizes da Escola Nova; e 3) Identificar e analisar as mudanÃas e continuidades na proposta de formaÃÃo de professores atravÃs do estudo das 113 ediÃÃes publicadas no perÃodo de 1934 a 1974. Utiliza fontes historiogrÃficas e impressas, compreendendo-as em suas mÃltiplas possibilidades de materializaÃÃo, cruzamento e interpretaÃÃo, privilegiando 113 exemplares do periÃdico Jornal O Lavrador, cujo valor consiste em ter sido produzido pela prÃpria escola, que iniciou sua circulaÃÃo ainda no primeiro ano de fundaÃÃo daquela instituiÃÃo. Apresenta os resultados obtidos na anÃlise de conteÃdo realizada, destacando a Ãnfase dada por aquele jornal aos assuntos ligados Ã vida do lavrador, principais eventos e prÃticas pedagÃgicas da escola e diversos artigos escritos pelos prÃprios alunos. As cinco dÃcadas estudadas e pelas quais o jornal atravessou, permitiram delimitar diferenÃas e podemos considerar as seguintes caracterÃsticas: 1) 1930 â marca o inicio da fase Ãurea da Escola evidenciando o prestÃgio e a notoriedade que o Ruralismo PedagÃgico ocupava na educaÃÃo cearense; 2) 1940 â a continuidade da dÃcada anterior com intensas atividades; 3) 1950 â Ã marcado pela publicaÃÃo de palestras sobre o Ruralismo e a comemoraÃÃo do aniversÃrio de Dona AmÃlia; 4) 1960 â o inÃcio do declÃnio da publicaÃÃo dos jornais; e 5) 1970 â o fim da Escola Ã marcado pela ausÃncia do fervor ruralista que iluminou a Escola durante todo o seu funcionamento. Evidencia A trajetÃria de circulaÃÃo do jornal O Lavrador Ã assinalada por intensas dificuldades no que se refere ao custeamento do periÃdico.
