5|$|Tactile ASL (TASL) is {{a variety}} of ASL used {{throughout}} the United States by and with the <b>deaf-blind.</b> It is particularly common among those with Usher's syndrome. This syndrome results in deafness from birth followed by loss of vision later in life; consequently, those with Usher's syndrome often {{grow up in the}} Deaf community using ASL, and later transition to TASL. TASL differs from ASL in that signs are produced by touching the palms, and there are some grammatical differences from standard ASL in order to compensate for the lack of non-manual signing.|$|E

25|$|While {{providing}} an audio CAPTCHA allows blind users {{to read the}} text, it still hinders those who are both blind and deaf. According to sense.org.uk, about 4% of people over 60 in the UK have both vision and hearing impairments. There are about 23,000 people in the UK who have serious vision and hearing impairments. According to The National Technical Assistance Consortium for Children and Young Adults Who Are <b>Deaf-Blind</b> (NTAC), the number of deafblind children in the USA increased from 9,516 to 10,471 during the period 2004 to 2012. Gallaudet University quotes 1980 to 2007 estimates which suggest upwards of 35,000 fully deafblind adults in the USA.

25|$|One {{project that}} did {{particularly}} well for Bachchan was Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Black (2005). The film starred Bachchan as an aging teacher of a <b>deaf-blind</b> girl and followed their relationship. His performance was unanimously praised by critics and audiences and won him his second National Film Award for Best Actor, his fourth Filmfare Best Actor Award {{and his second}} Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor. Taking advantage of this resurgence, Amitabh began endorsing a variety of products and services, appearing in many television and billboard advertisements. In 2005 and 2006, he starred with his son Abhishek in the hit films Bunty Aur Babli (2005), the Godfather tribute Sarkar (2005), and Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna (2006). All of them were successful {{at the box office}}. His later releases in 2006 and early 2007 were Baabul (2006), Ekalavya and Nishabd (2007), which failed to do well at the box office but his performances in each of them were praised by critics.|$|E
2500|$|Howe was director, and {{the life}} {{and soul of the}} school; he opened a printing-office and {{organized}} a fund for printing for the blind — the first done in the United States. He was a ceaseless promoter of their work. Through him, the Institution became one of the intellectual centers of American philanthropy, and by degrees obtained more and more financial support. In 1837, Howe brought to the school Laura Bridgman, a young <b>deaf-blind</b> girl who later became a teacher at the school. She became famous as the first known <b>deaf-blind</b> person to be successfully educated in the United States. [...] Howe taught Bridgman himself.

5000|$|Every <b>deaf-blind</b> {{actor is}} escorted by a {{personal}} interpreter {{that is making}} the work process, the director instructions and the group dynamics accessible for him/her. Most of the Nalaga’at Theater's actors suffer from Usher Syndrome, a genetic disorder resulting in a combination of hearing loss and visual impairment. By performing regularly on stage, the <b>deaf-blind</b> actors of the Nalaga’at Theater improve their self-esteem and communication skills, and {{have the opportunity to}} express themselves while raising awareness of the <b>deaf-blind</b> population’s needs in Israel. Most <b>deaf-blind</b> actors can communicate only with people who can sign language by touch or by the [...] "Glove" [...] sign language (every joint on the palm of the hand is a letter in Hebrew that you can type on). Communication between the <b>deaf-blind</b> actors has developed in many ways, as every person in the group has different needs and abilities.|$|E

50|$|In some cases, {{especially}} if the speaker knows sign language, the <b>deaf-blind</b> person may use the Tadoma method with one hand, feeling the speaker's face; {{and at the same}} time, the <b>deaf-blind</b> person may use their other hand to feel the speaker sign the same words. In this way, the two methods reinforce each other, giving the <b>deaf-blind</b> person a better chance of understanding what the speaker is trying to communicate. In addition, the Tadoma method can provide the <b>deaf-blind</b> person with a closer connection with speech than they might otherwise have had. This can, in turn, help them to retain speech skills that they developed before going deaf, and in special cases, to learn how to speak brand new words.|$|E
5000|$|Smithdas {{was born}} in Brentwood, Pennsylvania. For many years, he was the {{director}} of Services for the <b>Deaf-Blind</b> at the [...] "Industrial Home for the Blind" [...] in New York City.
