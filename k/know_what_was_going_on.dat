5|$|New Year's Rockin' Eve {{returned}} to ABC the following New Year's Eve {{for the arrival}} of 2001. The 2000–01 edition also introduced a new primetime hour at 10:00p.m. ET/PT, which featured additional segments and music performances to lead into the main program. Clark felt positive about the program's expansion into primetime – believing that viewers, no matter where they were, wanted to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> in Times Square on New Year's Eve. Clark was joined by Fox & Friends anchor Steve Doocy, and Michelle Madison as reporters in Times Square. Comedian Wayne Brady hosted concert segments in Hollywood, which included performances by Lonestar, Boyz II Men, 98 Degrees, Baha Men, and Third Eye Blind among others.|$|E
25|$|North Dakota was {{far away}} from the centers of the hippie {{movement}} on the coasts of the United States, but this did not mean that the local students did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> with their peers at schools such as UC-Berkeley. The combination of tension between the students and the established powers, and the local and state governments' lack of experience in dealing with large gatherings of angry and drunk protesters led to the riot that would put Zap, North Dakota across the headlines of the U.S. newspapers and make it the lead story on the CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite. What started out as a lark turned into a riot that resulted in thousands of dollars of damage.|$|E

Macmillan, {{who served}} as an aide to the {{executive}} committee, later wrote that tensions at the Watch Tower Society headquarters mounted as the day for election of the Society's officers approached. He wrote: [...] "A few ambitious ones at headquarters were holding caucuses here and there, doing a little electioneering to get their men in. However, Van Amburgh and I held {{a large number of}} votes. Many shareholders, knowing of our long association with Russell, sent their proxies to us to be cast for the one whom we thought best fitted for office." [...] Macmillan, who claimed he had declined an offer from an ailing Russell months earlier to accept the position of president after his death, agreed with Van Amburgh that Rutherford was the best candidate. According to Macmillan, [...] "Rutherford did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on.</b> He certainly didn't do any electioneering or canvassing for votes, but I guess he was doing some worrying, knowing if he was elected he would have a big job on his hands ... There is no doubt in our minds that the Lord's will was done in this choice. It is certain that Rutherford himself {{had nothing to do with}} it." ...|$|E

The representatives of the safety inspectorate fled. Some of the equipment failed. The establishment repeatedly played down the risks and suppressed information about {{the movement of the}} radioactive plume, so some people were evacuated from more lightly to more heavily contaminated places." ...|$|E

When asked about {{the first time she}} performed an Amanar in competition, Maroney said, [...] "The first time I did it was at Visa Championships and I was just thirteen years old.

2500|$|Baird {{responded to}} Jordan's {{allegations}} by calling them [...] "the merest bosh" [...] and by denying {{there were any}} inducements or special favors for athletes. [...] He later noted: [...] "President Jordan has made these charges several times, and never brought forth one iota of proof to establish his claim." [...] Former Michigan player and then Drake coach, Willie Heston, {{one of the players}} named as a professional in Jordan's article, responded: [...] "I {{was in a position to}} <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> and I believe that I am safe in saying that no Michigan athlete ever did anything since Baird took hold of things there." ...|$|E

[...] However, in an interview published on 9 July 2009 in the Washington Post, Ramón Custodio López, Honduras's human rights ombudsman, said he had received no official complaints from journalists: [...] "This is the first I have heard about an occupation or military raid of a station," [...] he said.

2500|$|Faldo's {{decision}} to only appoint one vice-captain, {{instead of the}} usual four or five, was also met with doubts about his ability to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> in all the matches being played simultaneously. Faldo was accused by the media of being a [...] "loner" [...] and a [...] "control freak", thus also contributing to the team's failings. In an interview with the British Daily Mail newspaper in 2012, Faldo said of his Ryder Cup captaincy: [...] "The bottom line is that it was a tough experience and very tough for me to deal with afterwards." [...] The Daily Mail described Europe's 2008 Ryder Cup defeat as [...] "a calamitous loss".|$|E

2500|$|Former Yankee {{third baseman}} Scott Brosius was notorious for not {{responding}} {{immediately to the}} roll call, as other players on the diamond would. Sometimes he would even wait {{as long as a}} minute to respond, getting a kick out of the persistence of the Creatures. In Hideki Matsui's first game at the Stadium in 2003, the chant of [...] "MAT-SU-I!" [...] went on for approximately two minutes, because he did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> or how to react. In a 2009 press conference, former Yankees first baseman Jason Giambi said that [...] "The biggest thing I miss is (the Bleacher Creatures') roll call.

2500|$|Gavin was {{confirmed}} to be Sharon's birth {{father in the}} episode broadcast on 30 October 2015, in which he repeated Sharon's adopted father Den Watts's (Leslie Grantham) iconic line [...] "Hello, princess". Digital Spy Daniel Kilkelly said EastEnders had [...] "delivered the daddy of all cliffhangers". Taylforth confirmed that her character Kathy is unaware {{of the connection between}} Sharon and Gavin, and said, [...] always said that she would walk into a room and know straight away , and especially when he said those words: 'Hello princess'. We had the full scripts for the episode, but the other cast members didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on.</b> Paul was just fantastic delivering that line." [...] Nicholas said that the [...] "hello, princess" [...] line was used because it was a definite way of linking Gavin and Den. Inside Soap said that Sharon discovering Gavin is her father [...] "has to be the biggest [...] of all" [...] for Sharon, but added that viewers had already guessed before the episode was broadcast. Soaplife thought it was the [...] "most shocking reveal" [...] of 2015 in all British soap operas, saying they were [...] "stunned". They also opined that Gavin seemingly genuinely wants to reconnect with Sharon and be a father to her and seems very fond of Dennis, and that if Sharon were to reject him, he would probably try to kidnap Dennis.|$|E

2500|$|Having {{lost all}} of her {{endorsements}} too, Suzuki was faced {{with the problem of}} production companies refusing to sign her and tried to make a comeback {{in the next two years}} with little to no success. Her relationship with her producer, Tetsuya Komuro, also ceased. Sony also took {{all of her}} singles and albums released up to that point off CD shelves. Many people were convinced that her chances for making a comeback were nil. In 2003, Suzuki finally negotiated an out-of-court agreement with Sony. Her contract with the label was scheduled to end in December 2004. Eiji Yamada was subsequently fined for his role in the tax evasion. Government officials linked to the scandal included former Education Minister Takashi Kosugi and two other legislators, who allegedly received 34 million yen in unofficial payments for referring AG Communication and other clients seeking tax evasion. About this period, Suzuki herself has said [...] "I really didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on,</b> lots of lies were being thrown about in the media. For people to hear little things on the TV and believe that to be the truth was a surprise, and I suddenly realized the kind of world I was in.

2500|$|Despite a {{temporary}} cooling of {{tensions in the}} Irish camp after Keane's change of heart, things soon took {{a turn for the}} worse. Keane immediately gave an interview to leading sports journalist Tom Humphries, of the Irish Times newspaper, where he expressed his unhappiness with the facilities in Saipan and listed the events and concerns which had led him to leave the team temporarily. McCarthy took offence at Keane's interview and decided to confront Keane over the article in front of the entire squad and coaching staff. Keane refused to relent, saying that he had told the newspaper what he considered to be the truth and that the Irish fans deserved to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> inside the camp. He then unleashed a stinging verbal tirade against McCarthy: [...] "Mick, you're a liar... you're a fucking wanker. I didn't rate you as a player, I don't rate you as a manager, and I don't rate you as a person. You're a fucking wanker and you can stick your World Cup up your arse. The only reason I have any dealings with you is that somehow you are the manager of my country! You can stick it up your bollocks." [...] Niall Quinn observed in his autobiography that [...] "Roy Keane's 10-minute oration ... was clinical, fierce, earth-shattering to the person on the end of it and it ultimately caused a huge controversy in Irish society." [...] But at the same time, he was also critical of Keane's stance, saying that, [...] " [...] left us in Saipan, not the other way round. And he punished himself more than any of us by not coming back." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1997, {{shortly after}} the Boston Globe {{disclosed}} that Bulger and Flemmi had been informants, Weeks met with retired agent John Connolly (later sentenced to 40 years in prison), who showed him a photocopy of Bulger's FBI informant file. In order to explain Bulger and Flemmi's status as informants, Connolly said, [...] "The Mafia was going against Jimmy and Stevie, so Jimmy and Stevie went against them." [...] According to Weeks, [...] "As I read over the files at the Top of the Hub that night, Connolly kept telling me that 90 percent of {{the information in the}} files came from Stevie. Certainly Jimmy hadn't been around the Mafia the way Stevie had. But, Connolly told me, he had to put Jimmy's name on the files to keep his file active. As long as Jimmy was an active informant, Connolly said, he could justify meeting with Jimmy and giving him valuable information. Even after he retired, Connolly still had friends in the FBI, and he and Jimmy kept meeting to let each other <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on.</b> I listened to all that, but now I understood that even though he was retired, Connolly was still getting information, as well as money, from Jimmy. As I continued to read, I could see {{that a lot of the}} reports were not just against the Italians. There were more and more names of Polish and Irish guys, of people we had done business with, of friends of mine. Whenever I came across the name of someone I knew, I would read exactly what it said about that person. I would see, over and over again, that some of these people had been arrested for crimes that were mentioned in these reports. It didn't take long for me to realize that it had been bullshit when Connolly told me that the files hadn't been disseminated, that they had been for his own personal use. He had been an employee of the FBI. He hadn't worked for himself. If there was some investigation going on and his supervisor said, 'Let me take a look at that,' what was Connolly going to do? He had to give it up. And he obviously had. I thought about what Jimmy had always said, 'You can lie to your wife and to your girlfriends, but not to your friends. Not to anyone we're in business with.' Maybe Jimmy and Stevie hadn't lied to me. But they sure hadn't been telling me everything." ...|$|E
