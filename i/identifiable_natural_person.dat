40|$|Abstract. In Lithuania, {{bankruptcy}} of <b>natural</b> <b>persons</b> {{is a relatively}} new subject that has been scientifically only randomly dealt with. The bill of Bankruptcy of <b>Natural</b> <b>Persons</b> in Lithuania was proposed as early as in spring 2009 (No. XIP- 450, 24. 03. 2009). The bill met with a considerable amount of criticism and was postponed for further improvement. By decree No. 413 of April 7, 2010, the Government of the Republic of Lithuania approved the concept of the {{bankruptcy of}} <b>natural</b> <b>persons</b> of the Republic of Lithuania. The principal goal of the concept was to consolidate the main provisions of the future law. The Law of Bankruptcy of <b>Natural</b> <b>Persons</b> of the Republic of Lithuania has come into effect since March 1, 2013. The authors of the article overview the concept and models of bankruptcy of <b>natural</b> <b>persons</b> and introduce the advantages and shortcomings of the institute of bankruptcy of <b>natural</b> <b>persons.</b> Based on scientific sources of Lithuanian and foreign authors, the article offers a theoretically systemized version of the main reasons determining the bankruptcy of <b>natural</b> <b>persons.</b> The reasons fall into two categories – economic and social. The article is mainly targeted at defining the reasons that determine the bankruptcy of <b>natural</b> <b>persons</b> in Lithuania. To achieve this goal, a quantitative survey of the questionnaires of <b>natural</b> <b>persons</b> affected by bankruptcy has been taken for the basis. In their questionnaires, the <b>natural</b> <b>persons</b> affected by bankruptcy have been asked to evaluate the reasons of bankruptcy. The results have been analyzed with the help of factor analysis and statistically processed using the SPSS statistical software package.

30|$|In {{order to}} {{facilitate}} the use of data {{in the context of}} research projects, public health or biobanks as well as ‘big data’ analytics, while protecting personal data, the new GDPR proposes technical and organisational measures such as anonymisation, pseudonymisation and encryption. The term anonymisation refers to removing personally identifiable information where it is not needed (e.g. the name of the patient and institution, the date and other text data on images, and perhaps even DICOM metadata from the PACS file which would allow re-identification). Pseudonymisation refers to the users replacing personally identifiable material with artificial identifiers. It means the processing of personal data {{in such a way that}} the data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, as long as such additional information is kept separately and subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure non-attribution to an identified or <b>identifiable</b> <b>natural</b> <b>person.</b> Recital 26 (an explanatory text which is part of the legislation that sets out reasons for the provisions of Article 4) explains the following: data which have undergone pseudonymisation, which could be attributed to a natural person by the use of additional information, should be considered as information on an <b>identifiable</b> <b>natural</b> <b>person.</b> To determine whether a person is identifiable, account should be taken of all the means reasonably likely to be used, such as singling out, either by the controller or by any other person, to identify the individual directly or indirectly. To ascertain whether means likely to be used to identify the individual are reasonable, account should be taken of all objective factors, such as the costs of and the amount of time required for identification, taking into consideration both available technology at the time of the processing and technological development [2].|$|E
40|$|Personal data” means any {{information}} relating to an identified or <b>identifiable</b> <b>natural</b> <b>person.</b> Anidentifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to anidentification number or {{to one or more}} factors specific to his physical, physiological, mental, economic,cultural or social identity. There are different ways in which an individual can be considered ‘identifiable’. Aperson’s full name is an obvious likely identifier. But a person can also be identifiable from otherinformation, including a combination of identification elements such as physical characteristics, pseudonymsoccupation, address etc. International and national authorities tried to adopt different types of regulations inorder to protect individuals’ personal data and to inform them with respect to their rights. The legalprovisions are continuously changing according to the new realities (society and economy are changing,individuals are using different kind of communications). In order to have a strong protection of personal dataand unitary rules for all member states, the European Commission published in January 2012 a proposal for aGeneral Data Protection Regulation on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personaldata and on the free movement of such data, which will supersede Directive 95 / 46 /EC. A regulation wasconsidered the most appropriate legal instrument to define the new framework for the protection of personaldata in the European Union: is directly binding upon the Member States, is directly applicable within theMember States and as soon as a regulation is passed, it automatically becomes part of the national legalsystem. The document shall be discussed by the European Parliament and the EU Member States meeting inthe Council of Ministers for discussion. The rules will take effect two years after they have been adopted...|$|E
