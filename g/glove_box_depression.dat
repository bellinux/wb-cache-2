40|$|In {{a nuclear}} fuel cycle facility, radiotoxic {{materials}} are being handled in freestanding leak tight enclosures called <b>glove</b> <b>boxes</b> (GBs). These <b>glove</b> <b>boxes</b> {{act as a}} primary confinement for the radiotoxic materials. <b>Glove</b> <b>boxes</b> are designed as per codal requirements for class I component. They are designed to withstand extreme level of earthquake loading with a return period of 10, 000 years. To evaluate seismic performance of the <b>glove</b> <b>box,</b> {{there is a need}} to check the stability (sliding and overturning), structural integrity (stresses and strains) and leak tightness under earthquake loading. Extensive shake table experiments were conducted on a single standalone <b>glove</b> <b>box.</b> Actual laboratory conditions were simulated during testing to check the response. After extensive shake table testing, <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> structure was also analyzed using finite element (FE) software. Detailed three-dimensional model of <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> structure was developed and analyzed using nonlinear time history method. It was observed that finite element methods could be utilized to accurately predict dynamic response of <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> structure. This paper discusses the details and results of shake table testing and methodology used for modelling and analysing freestanding <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> structure under seismic loading. In addition, simplified numerical procedure, developed using energy conservation principle is applied to estimate approximate sliding displacement of the <b>glove</b> <b>box.</b> (C) 2014 Elsevier B.

25|$|All {{polonium}} compounds, such as polonium dioxide, {{are extremely}} radioactive and thus must be handled in a <b>glove</b> <b>box.</b> The <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> must further be enclosed in another box {{similar to the}} <b>glove</b> <b>box,</b> maintained at a slightly lower pressure than the <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> to prevent the radioactive materials from leaking out. Gloves made of natural rubber do not provide sufficient protection against the radiation from polonium; surgical gloves are necessary. Neoprene gloves shield radiation from polonium better than natural rubber.|$|R
40|$|The Casting Laboratory (CL) alpha <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> {{was used}} to melt and cast {{metallic}} uranium and plutonium fuels {{as part of the}} Department of Energy`s Liquid Metal Fast Breeder Reactor Program. This highly contaminated alpha <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> was decontaminated and reconditioned to allow a change in mission. The goal of reconditioning was to install experimental apparatus and to improve contamination control prior to introducing plutonium- 238 into the CL <b>glove</b> <b>box.</b> Construction of a <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> containment structure and an increase in room ventilation were required. A temporary breathing air station was provided for personnel protection as well as personnel comfort. The historical contamination levels, the decontamination techniques, and the results of decontamination also are presented.

40|$|We have {{developed}} {{a new approach to}} <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> monitoring that involves drawing air out of one glove port through a detection grid that collects ions created in the air inside the <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> by ionizing radiation, especially alpha radiation. The charge deposited on the detection grid by the ions is measured with a sensitive electrometer. The air can be circulated back to the <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> through the other glove port, preventing contamination from leaving the <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> and detector system. Initial experiments using a mock-up constructed of sheet metal indicate that this technology provides the measurement technique needed to perform a defensible, non-invasive measurement of alpha contamination inside <b>glove</b> <b>boxes</b> destined for waste disposal. This can result in an enormous cost savings if a given <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> can be shown to fall into the catagory of Low-Level Waste rather than Trans-Uranic Waste. Considering that hundreds of <b>glove</b> <b>boxes</b> contaminated with plutonium will be taken out of service at various nuclear facilities over the next few years, the potential cost savings associated with disposal as LLW rather than TRU waste are substantial...|$|R

40|$|A small, lightweight, {{collapsible}} <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> enables its user {{to perform}} small experiments and other tasks. Originally {{intended for use}} aboard a space shuttle or the International Space Station (ISS), this <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> could also be attractive for use on Earth in settings in which work space or storage space is severely limited and, possibly, {{in which it is}} desirable to minimize weight. The development of this <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> was prompted by the findings that in the original space-shuttle or ISS setting, (1) it was necessary to perform small experiments in a large general-purpose work station, so that, in effect, they occupied excessive space; and it took excessive amounts of time to set up small experiments. The design of the <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> reflects the need to minimize the space occupied by experiments and the time needed to set up experiments, plus the requirement to limit the launch weight of the box and the space needed to store the box during transport into orbit. To prepare the <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> for use, the astronaut or other user has merely to insert hands through the two fabric glove ports in the side walls of the box and move two hinges to a locking vertical position (see figure). The user could do this while seated with the <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> on the user fs lap. When stowed, the <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> is flat and has approximately the thickness of two pieces of 8 -in.

40|$|The Los Alamos LSDDP {{demonstrated}} a Mega-Tech hydraulic cutting shear to remove legs from plutonium <b>glove</b> <b>boxes.</b> The baseline technology used at LANL for removal of <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> legs is a reciprocating saw. Legs on <b>glove</b> <b>boxes</b> are typically either 3 -inch diameter pipe or unistrut. During the demonstration, the Mega-Tech hydraulic cutting shear cut eight pipe legs in 15 minutes, while the reciprocating saw took 45 - 60 minutes {{to cut through}} eight legs, including a rest break to alleviate worker fatigue. Despite its lower production rate, the reciprocating saw may be favored in confined spaces, {{because it does not}} require as much access room as the hydraulic shears. Based on the faster production rate of the hydraulic shear, LANL and Rocky Flats are expected to begin using the hydraulic shear as their new baseline technology to remove legs from over 1, 500 plutonium <b>glove</b> <b>boxes</b> at the two sites...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to provide {{radiological}} engineering services for the design of special contamination containments. These containments were to be used during the replacement of leaking and damaged gaskets on the <b>glove</b> <b>boxes</b> in Technical Area- 55 (TA- 55). The damaged gaskets involved 18 windows and 5 interconnecting spool pieces in fuel processing <b>glove</b> <b>boxes.</b> The work scope included the design and manufacture of special contamination containment enclosures (containments), the preparation of procedures and tool lists to support gasket replacement while using the containments, and the training of appropriate TA- 55 personnel in the proper installation, operation and removal of the containments. It was originally anticipated that two basic containment designs would be required, one for the windows and one for spool pieces. Upon examination of the <b>glove</b> <b>boxes</b> it was evident that the individual space envelopes and interferences associated with each <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> would require uniquely designed containments for effective gasket replacement. This resulted in 13 individual containment designs that accommodated the interferences and allowed gasket replacement within the containment. Successful use of the containments for <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> gasket replacement was a significant accomplishment. The operation has proven that a properly managed containment program can enhance routine maintenance of the <b>glove</b> <b>boxes</b> while preventing a contamination release. The ability to perform these operations in containments reduces costs by preventing a contaminant release and eliminating the associated cleanup expenses, reduced radioactive waste and fuel processing down time...|$|R

40|$|<b>Glove</b> <b>boxes</b> are {{extensively}} used in {{a nuclear}} industry to handle hazardous materials. They are generally interconnected with each other through a flexible link and stand freely on the floor. To check the seismic stability of the interconnected <b>glove</b> <b>boxes</b> and evaluate safety margins in design, extensive full scale shake table testing of two interconnected <b>glove</b> <b>boxes</b> had been carried out. Objective was to observe effects of rigid body and elastic motions, arising due to base excitation, on stability and integrity of the system. It was observed that sliding was predominant mode of motion with associated low amplitude rocking motion. Elastic deformations were very limited to affect {{the integrity of the}} system. It was observed that to increase seismic stability of the interconnected <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> system, relative sliding displacement between the two should be controlled. Further to shake table testing, nonlinear time history finite element analysis was also carried out. Analysis results were found to be coherent with the corresponding test results. In addition to that, to determine a safe upper bound on sliding displacement, a numerical method is proposed. This paper discuss the test results to enhance understanding of seismic behavior of two interconnected <b>glove</b> <b>boxes.</b> Important interpretations are accentuated to give a clear understanding to the designers.
