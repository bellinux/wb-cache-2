2500|$|The {{project was}} founded by Savage in {{response}} to the suicide of Billy Lucas and other teenagers who were bullied because they were gay or perceived to be, such as with Raymond Chase, Tyler Clementi, Ryan Halligan, Asher Brown, and Seth Walsh. [...] Savage wrote, [...] "I wish I could have talked to this kid for five minutes. I wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> Billy that it gets better. I wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> him that, however bad things were, however isolated and alone he was, it gets better." [...] In September, they launched their YouTube channel. A one-hour special aired on February 21, 2012, hosted by Savage. A second hour long [...] "It Gets Better" [...] special was aired on both MTV and Logo networks on October 9, 2012. On May 3, 2011, a video ad developed by Google Chrome was launched during an episode of Glee and later aired across the nation.|$|E
2500|$|Criticisms of the CoT {{began with}} its first tests, with the {{magazine}} Speedway Illustrated noting the car's {{poor performance in}} traffic (February 2006 issue). [...] The Winston-Salem Journal also noted extensive criticism of the project during 2006 testing, with drivers becoming more vocal by July 2007 and most fans rejecting the model, citing the falsity of many of its technical claims; one angle of criticism was the differing philosophies of NASCAR officials Gary Nelson and John Darby, with Darby a particularly ardent supporter of the CoT based on a misreading of the sport's competition packages. Jeff Gordon and Matt Kenseth were pointedly critical of the car's poor performance in traffic, with Gordon stating after the 2007 New England 300, [...] "I'd like to {{know who it was}} who said this car would reduce the aero push because <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> you from when I first drove this car that it would be worse." [...] Kyle Busch, who won the very first race with the car at Bristol in 2007, proclaimed that the car [...] "sucks" [...] afterward and expanded on this criticism at Dover in 2008 in noting how the CoT was [...] "hitting a wall of air" [...] {{in the wake of a}} leading car, thus neutralizing ability to close up on leaders.|$|E
60|$|Both on Thursday and Friday last I {{had been}} tormented by many things, {{and wanted to}} disturb my course of thought any way <b>I</b> <b>could.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> you what {{entertainment}} I got on Friday, first, for {{it was then that}} I began meditating over these letters; let me tell you now what entertainment I found on Thursday.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have your}} {{business}} and your pleasures, your horses and your fields and your friends. I have nothing,--but to remain here {{and know that}} I have disobliged all those that love me. Do you think, Larry, I would not go and be your wife if <b>I</b> <b>could?</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> you all, Larry, and now do not ask me again." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was written}} {{as though in}} mine own handwriting, and very hastily scrawled, but so like that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>told</b> it myself <b>had</b> I not known {{it to be a}} forgery.|$|R

6000|$|... "Does he indeed?" [...] said I. [...] "I {{never heard}} of such a thing! Why, my pet of pets, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> you that weeks and weeks ago!" ...|$|E
6000|$|It was a {{fair enough}} question, but I did not answer him, and simply turned the pad over with a {{movement}} of instinctive secrecy: <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>told</b> him he <b>had</b> put to flight the psychology of Nina Almayer, her opening speech of the tenth chapter and the words of Mrs. Almayer's wisdom which were {{to follow in the}} ominous oncoming of a tropical night. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>told</b> him that Nina had said: [...] "It has set at last." [...] He would have been extremely surprised and perhaps have dropped his precious banjo. Neither <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> him that the sun of my sea-going was setting too, even as I wrote the words expressing the impatience of passionate youth bent on its desire. I did not know this myself, and {{it is safe to say}} he would not have cared, though he was an excellent young fellow and treated me with more deference than, in our relative positions, I was strictly entitled to.|$|R
60|$|Somewhat to my anxiety it was {{afternoon}} before I {{arrived in}} town. For my life <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>told</b> why <b>I</b> knew {{something had happened}} since my last visit, but I certainly felt it; and was proportionately curious and anxious.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why do I keep {{on coming}} here?" [...] I repeated, taken by surprise. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>told</b> her. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not even tell myself with sincerity why I was coming there. [...] "What's {{the good of}} you asking a {{question}} like that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I were a Sherlock Holmes," [...] said Jessie, [...] "I suppose <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> {{you were}} a colonial from little things like that. But anyhow, I guessed it, didn't I?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, 'tis known, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> 'ee, if thee'd asked me," [...] {{said the}} shepherd. [...] "But you do just as I tell 'ee, and it'll {{be all right}} with the dog." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The room is {{nice and}} airy," [...] said Mrs. Prentice, [...] "but it’s a pity you didn’t {{come to me}} before deciding. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> you of a better house for the same money." ...|$|E
5000|$|When General George Marshall {{returned}} from China on his frustrating peace mission in 1946, {{he said that}} State Fair [...] did more to tell the Chinese about America, “about {{the heart and soul}} and about its people than <b>I</b> <b>could</b> possibly <b>have</b> <b>told</b> them in hours of talking." ...|$|R
60|$|Therefore it was <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>told</b> whether <b>I</b> sprang {{here and}} there in the effort to strike a deadly blow, five minutes or half an hour, and {{something}} very like disappointment came over me when Master Morgan concluded the fight without aid from any of us.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear me! Won't {{the truth}} do, then? <b>I</b> hoped you <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> them {{something}} consoling. I {{am thinking of}} the poor mother now. Your Russia is a cruel country." ...|$|R
6000|$|Miss Meadows {{evaporated}} {{in hopes}} that Sophy would be sensible of--and assurances that Mrs. Kendal {{was a great deal}} too--with finally, 'Good-bye, Sophy, I wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> grandmamma that you had shown some feeling.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{have been}} inquiring about him from old Redford, and I should judge {{him to be}} a most {{dangerous}} companion; as, indeed, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> from his whole air, which is completely that of a roué.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> Thousandacres why his {{daughter}} hesitated; {{but the girl}} {{got out of the}} scrape by her own presence of mind and ingenuity, a little aided, perhaps, by some practice in sins of the sort.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{found that}} Horace tasted {{very much like}} Aristotle;--you know I am fond of variety. Terentius <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>told</b> from Menander. Naso, to my astonishment, was Nicander in disguise. Virgilius had a strong twang of Theocritus. Martial put me much in mind of Archilochus--and Titus Livius was {{positively}} Polybius and none other." ...|$|R
60|$|I read, curiously enthralled--though {{whether by}} {{the beauty of the}} lines or the beauty of the woman there beside me <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not then <b>have</b> <b>told</b> you.|$|R
60|$|Sampson, {{like the}} devil he was, laughed when it was too late. He had good impulses, but they never {{interfered}} with his sardonic humor. He paced the little room, shrugging his shoulders, offering no explanation.

6000|$|... "Nothing, as I know of," [...] said Dame Scratchard, [...] "since you didn't come to {{me before}} you sat. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> you all about it. Maybe it won't kill 'em, but they'll always be deformed." ...|$|E
6000|$|By command, Beaupere {{resumed his}} {{examination}} of the accused. It being Lent, {{there might be a}} chance to catch her neglecting some detail of her religious duties. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> him he would fail there. Why, religion was her life! ...|$|E
6000|$|He paused, and beamed rather freely, to {{show that}} this was comedy. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> the man it was no use. Not a ripple. The corn {{chandler}} leaned against me and muttered [...] "Whoddidesay?" [...] but that was all.|$|E
60|$|Eight runs! Enough to win two games! <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>told</b> how it happened. I {{was sick}} and all but crushed. Still I had a blind, dogged faith in the big rustic.

6000|$|... "Nay, {{that is a}} libel on my invention!" [...] exclaimed Harry. [...] "If I {{had drawn}} on that, <b>could</b> <b>I</b> not <b>have</b> <b>told</b> you {{something}} much droller?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Andrew," [...] she whispered, [...] "I {{have been}} ashamed. I was wrong. That night--the {{thought of my}} pettiness--my foolish, selfish fears.--Oh, I was wrong!

6000|$|... 'Ah! I thought so, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> you so!' cried Margaret, triumphant in her sagacity, but astonished, as {{her brother}} started up and {{stood looking at}} her, {{as if he could}} hardly resolve to give credit to her words.|$|E
6000|$|... "This is all I have to say, if you please, sir, {{about how}} I first met with little Mary; and I wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> it {{in a way}} that was more fit for such as you to hear." ...|$|E
60|$|SIR PATRICK. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> you that. Ive tried these modern inoculations a bit myself. Ive killed {{people with}} them; and Ive cured people with them; but I gave them up because I never could tell which I {{was going to}} do.|$|E
6000|$|... "Most of {{that which}} you have learnt from Malpertuis to-night, <b>I</b> myself <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> you. Yes; St. Auban has carried Canaples's letter to the Cardinal already. I heard from his lips to-day--for I {{was present at the}} interview--how the {{document}} had been wrested from Malpertuis. For your sake, so that you might learn all he knew, I sought the fellow out, and having found him in the Rue des Tournelles, I took you thither." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why on earth--? A man {{ought to}} be labelled. You see, I'm {{separated}} from my wife. But she doesn't and won't divorce me. You don't understand the fix I am in. And you don't know what led to our separation. And, in fact, all round the problem you don't know and I don't see how <b>I</b> <b>could</b> possibly <b>have</b> <b>told</b> you before. I wanted to, {{that day in the}} Zoo. But I trusted to that ring of yours." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{went to the}} Morgue, {{thinking}} to find there Theodore's dead body, and found myself vaguely looking for the mutilated corpse of Carissimo.
