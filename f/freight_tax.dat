40|$|Abstract: Externalities such as {{pollution}} and road congestion are jointly {{produced by the}} use of intermediate inputs by firms and the consumption of final goods by households. Remarkably, to cope with such externalities policy proposals often suggest very partial tax reforms. A pertinent example is the current EU proposal to introduce congestion taxes for freight transport on major roads while, for political or technical reasons, failing to similarly address passenger transport. This paper uses a simple general equilibrium model to explore the effects of such a partial tax reform in a second-best setting. The theoretical model shows that the welfare effect of higher freight taxes is positive, unless passenger transport is severely under-taxed and the tax reform attracts substantially more passenger transport. Moreover, the optimal <b>freight</b> <b>tax</b> may be below or above marginal external cost; the former holds if passenger transport is under-taxed and the <b>freight</b> <b>tax</b> does not strongly affect labour supply. Budgetary neutral tax reform exercises with a numerical simulation model for the UK suggest that, under a wide variety of parameter values, higher freight transport taxes are indeed welfare increasing. The welfare gain of <b>freight</b> <b>tax</b> reform rises with the level of the passenger tax, but the optimal <b>freight</b> <b>tax</b> declines at higher taxes on passenger transport. Substantial net benefits of tax reform are obtained only under labour tax recycling of the revenues...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study, within a general {{equilibrium}} framework, the welfare implications of a balanced-budget tax reform for an externality-generating intermediate input in a second-best economic environment. For purposes of concreteness, the focus is on tax reform for freight road transport to cope with congestion externalities; results for other types of externalities can be derived as special cases. The model takes into account that passenger and freight flows jointly produce congestion, it captures feedback effects in demand, and it allows for existing distortions on all other input and output markets, including the passenger transport market and the labour market. Moreover, it clearly shows that the welfare effects of the reform depend on the instruments used to recycle the tax revenues. A numerical version of the model is calibrated to UK data. The numerical results suggest, among others, that (i) the welfare gain of a given <b>freight</b> <b>tax</b> reform rises with the level of the tax on the market for passenger transport; (ii) the higher the rate of passenger transport taxation, the lower the optimal freight tax; and (iii) compared to lump-sum recycling, both the welfare effects of a tax reform and the optimal tax are substantially higher when revenues are recycled via labour taxes. externalities; transport; taxes; freight; tax reform...|$|E
5000|$|General Electric in its {{agreements}} {{controlled the}} quantity and kind of stock to be kept on hand by the agents; Masonite made no such provision in its 1933 agreement. Likewise General Electric could order return of stock at any time; Masonite could only recall stock from its agents in special circumstances. With respect to indicia of ownership, Masonite's distributors were to pay the freight on the consigned goods, carry insurance on them, pay taxes in respect of sale, might not use Masonite's trademark, and {{had to pay for}} the goods consigned by advancing one-half of the price of the hardboard within a limited time even though the goods had not yet been sold[...] [...] [...] General Electric, in contrast, paid <b>freight,</b> <b>taxes,</b> and insurance, put its own trade-mark on the goods, and required no payment until the goods had been sold, but did require that the agent pay for any lost or broken stock. Finally, the distributors in the Masonite case agreed to save Masonite harmless from any tortious actions by third parties arising out of sale of hardboard.|$|R

50|$|The total {{cultivable}} {{area of the}} islands is only about 400 hectares. Although rainfall is abundant, wet and dry seasons are sharply defined. Better irrigation and drainage systems are needed to improve food crops. The government has taken various measures to reduce dependency on imported foods, including deregulating production and marketing and reducing the trades tax on fertilizers and equipment. As a result, vegetable and fruit production climbed from 505 tons in 1990 to 1,170 tons in 1992. This increase failed to be matched by a commensurate decrease in imports of fruits and vegetables, which reached 3,471 tons in 1992. Local consumption had apparently increased, and substitution between imported and domestic foodstuffs was possible only to a limited degree. In most cases, imported produce is significantly cheaper in spite of air <b>freight,</b> import <b>taxes,</b> and other costs, necessitating a high import markup by the SMB to prevent disruption of domestic production. Neither rice, a dietary staple, nor other grains can be grown on the islands.|$|R

40|$|As the key {{ingredient}} for steelmaking, iron ore {{is integral to}} the global economy and represents the world's second-largest natural resource market by value. The overall structure and dynamics of the iron ore market have recently undergone various radical changes. The global demand shock caused by the rapid industrialization of China has sent market prices skywards and triggered a collapse of the 40 -year-old benchmark pricing system. The newly adopted quarterly index-based pricing mechanism has brought an abrupt end to the traditional stability of the iron ore market, with price dynamics now experiencing greater volatility. Against the backdrop of these disruptive changes, this dissertation proposes a deterministic nine-region spatial equilibrium model of the 2020 iron ore market based on the fundamental characteristics and mechanics of the market. Key features of the model are its bottom-up structure, modeling supply volumes and costs on an individual mine level {{as well as the}} simulation of interregional trade flows using a linear optimization approach. In analyzing a number of relevant scenarios, this dissertation projects the key characteristics of the 2020 global iron ore market in terms of regional production volumes, demand, iron ore trade flows and market prices. It quantifies market dynamics based on changes in available production capacity, demand and freight rates. From a demand perspective, the dissertation proposes several strategies to mitigate the risk arising from higher and more volatile iron ore prices. Of these strategies, the captivity of mines and the introduction of iron ore export taxes are analyzed in greater detail with respect to their effectiveness and influence on the iron ore market. iron ore, mining, steel, steelmaking, China, market simulation, industry cost curve, pricing, linear opti-mization, trade flows, market dynamics, volatility, risk, <b>freight,</b> captivity, export <b>taxes...</b>|$|R
40|$|Texas is the nation’s highest energy consumer, {{as well as}} {{its highest}} emitter of carbon dioxide. The Texas {{transportation}} sector consumes 1. 95 quadrillion Btu, 20 percent of the state’s energy consumption (111 million Btu per capita, versus the US average of 90 million Btu per capita). Thus, the state’s contribution to global climate stabilization and local environmental quality will require a re-examination of its transportation system. In this study, four alternative scenarios were constructed, reflecting different energy strategies that Texas could pursue to address these issues. These alternative scenarios were then measured against a reference scenario, which reflects current regulations and trends in transport policy. The first alternative, a “Roll-Back ” Scenario, examined the consequences of revoking the current alternative fuels programs. Moderate, Aggressive and Visionary scenarios were also developed, consisting of increasingly aggressive policies to reduce energy consumption and emissions. Included in the analyses are various transportation control measures, employee trip reduction programs, broader use of telecommunications technologies to replace person and freight movement, accelerated vehicle scrappage, “feebates, ” mode shifts from automobile to various public transit alternatives and from truck to rail <b>freight,</b> and fuel <b>taxes.</b> We discuss the impacts of these measures, identifying the ones that have the greatest impact. Our scenarios suggest that only if very aggressive policies are adopted [...] such as those modeled in our Visionary Scenario [...] will transport energy use and greenhouse gas emissions in Texas stabilize, let alone decline. We also find that the major stumbling blocks to implementing such an aggressive suite of transportation policies is the long time-frame required for the impacts to come to full fruition and conclude that the political difficulties in taking a long-term perspective will need to be overcome...|$|R
