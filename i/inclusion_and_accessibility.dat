As such, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) may serve an integrity-enhancing function by improving the possibility of leading an independent and autonomous life. While generally optimistic about the possibilities mobility-enhancing ICT presents, the respondents also emphasize that ICT, even when universally accessible, is not the final missing piece of the mobility puzzle.

30|$|The role {{of media}} in taking “an active and {{inclusive}} role” and providing information “in a simple, transparent, easy-to-understand and accessible manner” {{was made in}} both the Zero Draft and the SFDRR (Paragraph 36 (d), UNISDR 2015 a, p. 21). While the paragraph does not specifically mention people with disabilities, it does contain the important constructs of <b>inclusion</b> <b>and</b> <b>accessibility.</b> In the United States, the accessibility of media services has been particularly of concern with respect to individuals with sensory disabilities. Closed captioning, alternative types of alerting systems, and sign language translation of public announcements have all been evaluated {{with respect to their}} capacity to make emergency communications more accessible.|$|E
30|$|Also in Paragraph 7, the SFDRR {{contains}} {{several important}} disability-related constructs that become highly relevant in disaster situations. The disability-related constructs of <b>inclusion</b> <b>and</b> <b>accessibility</b> appear as common terms in discussing disaster risk reduction and state “Disaster risk reduction practices {{need to be}} […] inclusive and accessible {{in order to be}} efficient and effective” (UNISDR 2015 a, p. 5). Within the disability community, “accessibility” is multifaceted and has been a longstanding goal in the areas of education, transportation, housing, and employment. “Accessibility” not only refers to physical access, but access to services and resources. It is a term that applies, for example, to how individuals in wheelchairs can board public buses or enter public buildings over ramps, but also to how individuals who are blind access public documents through Braille or how Deaf individuals can access public announcements on television through closed captions.|$|E
30|$|Although the {{concepts}} of <b>inclusion</b> <b>and</b> <b>accessibility</b> have been used within the disability community in connection with people with disabilities, these practices also benefit people without disabilities. For example, the accessibility shift {{to the use of}} curb-cuts in the United States on pedestrian sidewalks at intersections not only benefits people using wheelchairs, but also elderly people with balance problems and mothers pushing strollers. Similarly, the inclusion shift in the United States to provide close captioning on television not only benefits Deaf people but those who are learning English as a second language or those who would rather watch sports without narration. Within the context of disaster risk reduction, the constructs of accessibility and inclusion can be beneficial in similar ways. Evacuation procedures for people with mobility impairments, for example, will benefit both people who use wheelchairs and people who cannot walk long distances. Inclusive procedures, for example, such as considering the diverse dietary needs of people in a shelter, will benefit people with diabetes as well as people following religious dietary laws.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} {{the problem of}} designing a reconfigurable machining line. Such a line is composed of a sequence of workstations performing specific sets of operations. Each workstation is comprised of several identical CNC machines (machining centers). The line is required to satisfy the given precedence order, <b>inclusion,</b> exclusion <b>and</b> <b>accessibility</b> constraints on the given set of operations. <b>Inclusion</b> <b>and</b> exclusion are zoning constraints which oblige or forbid certain operations to be performed on the same workstation. The accessibility constraints imply that each operation has a set of possible part positions under which it can be performed. All the operations performed on the same workstation must have a common part position. Workstation times are computed taking into account processing and setup times for operations and must not exceed a given bound.

40|$|Drawing on {{the work}} of John Swain (2004) as well as {{scholarship}} surrounding the method of photovoice, this dissertation argues for a new approach in tackling the issues surrounding disability in a higher education setting. This research aims to identify the barriers of visibly disabled students by analysing their lived experiences through the innovative phenomenological method of photovoice. Photovoice has been used in the health sciences as well as in community research; however, using it in disability studies is new territory. Photovoice draws on Merleau-Ponty’s (2002) phenomenology to offer an in depth insight into the lived experiences of the participants; this in turn exposes the barriers which they face on a day to day basis. The main findings are that the notion of independence is a big issue for the participants; the sense of having a lack of independence is heavily connected with the physical environment as well as stigma (Goffman, 1986). This dissertation provides recommendations for the university in terms of policy and provision for its disabled students; it is argued that if these changes are made, Queen Margaret University {{will be one of the}} leading institutions within Scotland in terms of <b>inclusion</b> <b>and</b> <b>accessibility...</b>|$|E

A number of conference attendees stayed afterward {{to ask questions}} [...] one remarked {{that this was the}} best session she had attended. Unfortunately, no attendees appeared to have a role in providing library support at their institutions. Still, experience has shown that this project tends to produce unexpected results, promoting values related to <b>inclusion</b> <b>and</b> <b>accessibility.</b> I am confident that the presentation will have an impact for {{at least some of the}} participants in their work. The article (attached) was included in the Conference Proceedings and is under consideration for publication in the peer-reviewed online journal “E-Learning. ”In rural communities, common barriers to the use of web-based information and communication technology include a lack of equipment and connectivity, as well as expertise and literacy. These barriers are especially common for people who are economically or socially disadvantaged, such as individuals with disabilities and others in marginalized groups (e. g., aboriginal people, new immigrants, those living in poverty). The Inclusive Libraries Initiative has been designed to address these barriers. Since 2003, this project has been fostering the development of inclusive libraries in Northeast Alberta, the second-most-westerly province in Canada. The project is based on the premise that local libraries are ideally positioned to offer access to high-quality computer and online technology, including assistive technology, as well as expertise in their use. Libraries are natural supports that can be developed to increase community capacity, thereby enhancing the inclusion of individuals with disabilities, as well as those in other marginalized groups, in the communities where they live, work, and learn. This presentation will present the outcomes that are being achieved through this project and the lessons learned along the way. Academic & Professional Development Fund (A&PDF...|$|E
40|$|According to Wikimedia Foundation’s last {{biennial}} report, {{when talking}} about universal access to information, we are broadly referring to an ideal reality where every single person is given free access to {{the sum of all}} human language. Wikipedia, the largest portal of information covering about 270 languages of the world, has been pursuing that goal over the last 10 years. E-communication, digital <b>inclusion</b> <b>and</b> <b>accessibility,</b> however, not only refer to internet connection or ICTs availability, but also to the quality and usability of the information and services that the users are given access to. Simple English Wikipedia (SEW) is a participatory initiative that focuses on text simplification as a way to reach a broader audience, including non-native speakers, children, elderly, adults with low literacy skills and people with functional diversity. Turning a complex text into a simple one implies rewriting the content clearly and simply by applying a set of linguistic-and-style rules, such as lexical substitutions or syntactical simplifications. Through an accessible style, readers can reach a higher level of comprehension. Nonetheless, this treatment of the text must not only be seen as an operation to improve reading easiness, but also as a potential pre-edition phase to optimize the source language content for translation purposes. Since English Wikipedia’s and SEW’s articles are not always parallel and sometimes have been created independently, we applied a state-of-the-art language control checker to a set of complex articles to evaluate the impact on the translatability. Both versions (complex and simple) have been automatically translated into French. The machine translation output from both has been evaluated by native speakers from different countries considering two parameters: informativeness and simplicity. Results have shown that SEW is a source of valuable content to perform translation tasks. On the other hand, increasing Simple Wikipedia’s popularity could also encourage human translators (professionals or community members) to perform their task more smoothly and efficiently, and therefore, create a multilingual, alternative and more accessible-for-all digital information portal, easier and in less time...|$|E

40|$|This thesis, {{based on}} the results of an {{organizational}} ethnography of a university-based feminist organization in Southern Ontario (the Centre), traces how third wave feminism is being constituted in the goals, initiatives, mandate, organizational structure, and overall culture of university-based feminist organizations. I argue that, from its inception, the meanings and goals of the Centre have been contested through internal critique, reflection, and discussion inspired by significant shifts in feminist theory that challenge the fundamental principles of second wave feminism. I identify a major shift in the development and direction of the Centre that occurs in two distinct phases. The first phase of the shift occurs with the emergence of an antioppression framework, which broadens the Centre 2 ̆ 7 s mandate beyond gender and sexism to consider multiple axes of identity and oppression that affect women 2 ̆ 7 s lives. The second phase of this shift is characterized by a focus on (trans) <b>inclusion</b> <b>and</b> <b>accessibility</b> and has involved changing the Centre 2 ̆ 7 s name so that it is no longer identified as a women 2 ̆ 7 s centre in order to reflect more accurately its focus on mUltiple axes of identity and oppression. Along with identifying two phases of a major shift in the direction of the Centre, I trace two discourses about its development. The dominant discourse of the Centre 2 ̆ 7 s development is one of progress and evolution. The dominant discourse characterizes the Centre as a dynamic feminist organization that consistently strives to be more inclusive and diverse. The reverse discourse undermines the dominant discourse by emphasizing that, despite the Centre 2 ̆ 7 s official attempts to be inclusive and to build diversity, little has actually changed, leaving women of colour marginalized in the Centre 2 ̆ 7 s dominant culture of whiteness. This research reveals that, while many of their strategies have unintended (negative) consequences, members of the Centre are working to build an inclusive politics of resistance that avoids the mistakes of earlier feminist movements and organizations. These members, along with other activists, actively constitute third wave feminism in a process that is challenging, contradictory, and often painful. A critical analysis of this process and the strategies it involves provides an opportunity for activists to reflect on their experiences and develop new strategies in an effort to further struggles for social justice and equity...|$|E

This study links up to this tradition by reporting a survey of how the vocabulary knowledge has changed over time in Sweden, building on data from theSwedish Scholastic Aptitude Test (SweSAT). Ever since 1977, SweSAT has functioned as an instrument of selection to higher education. SweSAT consists of different quantitative and verbal subtests, and one of these subtest, the vocabulary test, is intended to assess understanding of words and concepts. The SweSAT vocabulary test is a multiple-choice test where no context is given. The study has been limited to comprise the period from the spring 2000 to the spring 2011. During this period, the vocabulary test consisted of 40 tasks at each occasion and was carried out by about 40. 000 participants each time. Based on data from the SweSAT vocabulary test, two substudies have been carried out. The first of these substudies focuses on differences in average test results over time. Since SweSAT is designed to rank the test takers as fairly as possible with regard to their expected study success,different tests are however not directly comparable. One solution to this problem is to restrict the comparison over time to different groups (i. e. based on age, educational background, and gender) in order to establish how the vocabulary knowledge has changed over time. The first substudy reports such an investigation of comparisons between groups, building on answers from 915, 491 participants. Over time, the average test score at the vocabulary test has decreased with about 2 points. During the same period we see a widening gap between different age groups. This widening gap can also be noticed when comparing test takers with or without university education. Other variables are of limited importance to explain the variation in test scores. A comparison of the average test score over time can, of course, not give any information of how the understanding of individual words has changed over time. However, every word that is given in a regular vocabulary test has previously been tried out on a smaller group of participants in connection with a regular SweSAT test (the test takers learn afterwards which part of the test that consisted of pretest tasks and which parts belonged to the regular test). By comparing the results for individual words from the pretests with the corresponding result from the regular test, changes in the understanding of individual words can however be tracked. The second substudy reports such an investigation of comparisons between pretests and regular vocabulary tests, building on results for a selection of 151 words. When comparing the results from the pretests with the regular vocabulary tests, 110 of the 151 words included have changed significantly over time. For 75 of the words included (49 %), the results have decreased between the pretests and the regular tests, whereas 36 (24 %) of the words display a significant increase. As {{was the case in the}} first substudy, there are clear differences between age-groups, whereas the difference between females and males is almost non-existent. When looking for possible explanations of the results demonstrated, some tendencies to a connection between the improvement and frequency have been found, whereas no such relationship could be supported for the words that show a decreased result over time. However, there is a clear connection between vocabulary knowledge and word origin in the sense that words used also in English shows a better result than domestic words...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The European Community (EC) {{has issued}} several {{directives}} to promote social <b>inclusion</b> <b>and</b> media <b>accessibility.</b> In turn, countries within the European Union (EU) are implementing media access services {{for people with}} disabilities at different rates, speeds and styles. What may start in one country as a media access anecdote or sporadic event may develop into a service that aims to improve media accessibility for all. Media accessibility tends to begin as an isolated event, {{as in the case of}} the Cooperativa Sociale Scurelle (Scurelle Cooperative Association), the Cinema senza Barriere (Cinema without Barriers) or the Museo del Cinema in Torino (Turin Cinema Museum) events in Italy, but once the trend is underway, and the audience is aware of its availability, the next step would be to establish a standard quality service. This is the objective of this article. The first part aims to provide an overview of Media Access in Europe, paying special attention to Italy, where media access for the disabled is not widely available. While even a minimum cultural content could have maximum diffusion, the opposite is the case in Italy. Very few movies are accessible and sometimes, are duplicated. In other words, we found different audio descriptions of the same film. Media access duplication is a widespread trans-European phenomenon. The second part of the article examines the different approaches to audio description of the same film in Italy. The results go to show that, rather than opting for an access trend of isolated anecdotes, a widespread quality access content should be encouraged, taking into consideration the many and wide-ranging technical exploitation channels and formats...|$|R
40|$|In November 2009, the Slovenian {{government}} {{implemented a}} new participatory tool called "Predlagam vladi" (I propose to the government) {{in order to}} include citizens in the governmental policy process, which aimed to increase active citizen participation and connect citizens and civil society with the government. At a declarative level of the proponent (the government), {{the use of this}} e-tool promotes <b>inclusion,</b> openness, <b>accessibility,</b> <b>and</b> deliberative communication. Although the web portal received almost no publicity in the mass media, citizens largely grasped the new opportunity for broader access to the policy process. This study focuses mainly on the deliberative character of the governmental portal on three specific levels: structure and architecture, openness to citizens, and concrete proposals and comments. By critically evaluating deliberative communication and the role of new media in such practical projects, the authors explain how these new opportunities are limited and, by debating deliberation and public sphere, determine important obstacles that prevent such projects from being deliberately effectiv...|$|R
