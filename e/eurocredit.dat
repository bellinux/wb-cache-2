5000|$|<b>Eurocredit</b> is a loan whose {{denominated}} {{currency is}} not the lending bank's national currency. A <b>eurocredit</b> loan would be made by a U.S. bank to a lender requiring a denominated currency which differs from the bank's local currency (USD) for specific reasons, most likely some sort of business operations or trade requirements. Despite {{the inclusion of the}} word [...] "euro," [...] a <b>eurocredit</b> is not immediately derived from the euro.|$|E

5000|$|Eurocredits are short-to-medium-term loans of Eurocurrency {{extended}} by Eurobanks to corporations, sovereign governments, nonprime banks, or international organizations. The loans are denominated in currencies {{other than the}} home currency of the Eurobank. Because these loans are frequently too large for a single bank to handle, Eurobanks will band {{together to form a}} bank lending syndicate to share the risk.The credit risk on these loans is greater than on loans to other banks in the interbank market. Thus, the interest rate on Eurocredits must compensate the bank, or banking syndicate, for the added credit risk. On Eurocredits originating in London the base lending rate is LIBOR. The lending rate on these credits is stated as LIBOR +X percent, where X is the lending margin charged depending upon the creditworthiness of the borrower. Additionally, rollover pricing was created on Eurocredits so that Eurobanks do not end up paying more on Eurocurrency time deposits than they earn from the loans. Thus, a <b>Eurocredit</b> may be viewed as a series of short-term loans, where {{at the end of each}} time period (generally three or six months), the loan is rolled over and the base lending rate is repriced to current LIBOR over the next time interval of the loan.|$|E
40|$|Since early 1984, note {{issuance}} facilities (NIFs) have {{in considerable}} degree replaced syndicated Eurocurrency bank credits in international credit markets, especially for borrowers in industrial countries, because borrowers have found it cheaper to bypass bank syndications and obtain funds more directly by issuing Euronotes. Factors behind this include an increasing awareness of borrowing possibilities, more freedom for Japanese investors to buy foreign securities, {{a drop in the}} relative popularity of bank obligations with investors, and banks' desire to slow asset growth to improve capital ratios.; Measurement of the cost savings to borrowers on NIFs as compared with <b>Eurocredits</b> is difficult because of limited comparison possibilities. Most NIFs arranged so far have not been drawn on through issuance of notes, and few of the actual issuers have arranged LIBOR-priced <b>Eurocredits</b> recently. In the 12 cases, as of mid- 1985, where meaningful comparisons could be made, it appears that the cost savings to the borrowers ranged from about 10 to around 50 basis points. All of the savings were in the interest spread, where the NIFs appear to have been about 15 to 55 basis points cheaper. Fee costs were slightly higher on NIFs than on Eurocredits; although front-end fees are lower, the total fee costs for NIFs are higher because of the annual facility fee paid to banks that underwrite the NIF. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, there is {{approached}} the experience harvested to {{the thread of}} the implantation of the <b>Eurocredit</b> (ECTS) {{in one of the}} new subjects of the Licentiate of Sciences of the Work. It is the case of the subject "Political Sociolabor", that, for his current stamp and his character interdiscipline, allows to bring the pupil to his content, from different methodological slopes. The study is constructed in three parts. First, there are approached the basic directives of the <b>Eurocredit</b> applied to the subject object of analysis. Secondly, there is an index of reflections extrated immediately after the experience harvested so much by the educational equipment as by the own student body (by means of surveys realized at the end of course). Finally, in the Annexes of the work, there is attached a synthesis of the methodological directives extracted from the Web page, elaborated specifically as tool of work for the follow-up of the subject. En el presente estudio, se aborda la experiencia cosechada al hilo de la implantación del Eurocrédito (ECTS) en una de las nuevas asignaturas de a Licenciatura de Ciencias del Trabajo. Es el caso de la asignatura Políticas Sociolaborales, que, por su impronta actual y su caracter interdisplinar, permite aproximar al alumno a su contenido, desde distintas vertientes metodológicas. El estudio se estructura en tres partes. Primero, se aborda las directrices básicas del Eurocrédito aplicadas a la asignatura objeto de análisis. En segundo lugar se esboza un elenco de reflexiones extraídas a raíz de la experiencia cosechada tanto por el equipo docente como por el propio Alumnado (mediante encuestas realizadas al final de curso). Finalmente en los Anexos del trabajo se adjuntan una síntesis de las directrices metodológicas extraídas de la página Web, elaborada específicamente como herramienta de trabajo para el seguimiento de la asignatura...|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates to {{what extent}} the {{international}} financial community has taken into account the risk characteristics of borrowing less developed countries when granting loans. Specifically, this study analyzes the determinants of the spread between the interest rate charged to a particular country and the London Interbank Borrowing Rate (LIBOR). The empirical analysis uses data on 727 public and publicly guarantied Eurodollar loans granted to 19 LDC's between 1976 and 1980. The results obtained show that lenders in <b>Eurocredit</b> markets have tended to take into account (some of) the risk characteristics of borrowers. In particular {{it was found that the}} level of the spread will be positively related to the debt/GNP ratio and the debt service ratio. On the other hand, the spread will benegatively related to the international reserves to GNP ratio and the propensity to invest. The results obtained also show that an increase in the foreign debt coupled with an equivalent increase in international reserves will tend to leave the perceived probability of default unaffected. The empirical analysis presented in this paper also indicates that as late as 1980 the international financial community had not perceived any significant increase in the probabilities of defaulting in the countries that eventually run into serious debt problems (i. e., Argentina, Brazil, Mexico). ...|$|E
