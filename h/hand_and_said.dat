Marseille was a gifted pianist and was invited to play a piece at the home of Willy Messerschmitt, an industrialist and designer of the Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter. Guests at the party included Adolf Hitler, party chairman Martin Borman, Hitler's deputy and Commander-in-Chief of the Luftwaffe, Hermann Göring, head of the SS, Heinrich Himmler and Reich Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels. After impressing with a display of Ludwig van Beethoven's Für Elise, Marseille proceeded to play American Jazz, which was considered degenerate in Nazi ideology. Hitler stood, raised his <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> [...] "I think we've heard enough" [...] before quickly leaving the room. Magda Goebbels found the prank amusing and Artur Axmann recalled how his [...] "blood froze" [...] when he heard this [...] "Ragtime" [...] music being played in front of the Führer.|$|E

[...] During one segment, a compass was made to move, apparently {{as a result of}} Geller's paranormal abilities. [...] However, critics say slow motion footage of the episode showed Geller attaching a magnet to his thumb immediately prior to the compass's movement. Geller denied that this was sleight of <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> he welcomed the [...] "mystical aura" [...] that the publicity gave him.|$|E

[...] Smith [...] "dragged him from the ring, bareheaded, and tore Rigdon's fine pulpit coat from the collar to the waist". Reportedly, [...] "after that Rigdon never countermanded the orders of the Prophet, to my knowledge—he knew who was boss." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the age of}} 24 Scates {{moved from}} player to coach. When the UCLA volleyball coach took a sabbatical, he offered Scates the job. Scates was {{surprised}} but accepted. He then went to meet with Athletic Director Wilbur Johns. [...] "He didn't even tell me to sit down," [...] Scates recalled. [...] "I told him that I cannot accept a salary for coaching volleyball because I {{wanted to be in}} the Olympics in 1964, and at that time if you coached a sport for money or played for money you were not considered an amateur and couldn't participate in the Olympics. [...] "When he heard that he jumped up, shook my <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'Congratulations, son, you're hired.'" ...|$|E

[...] He then {{spent most of the}} day near the entrance to the Dakota apartment building where Lennon lived, talking to fans and the doorman. Early in the morning, a distracted Chapman missed seeing Lennon step out of a cab and enter the Dakota. Later in the morning, Chapman met Lennon's housekeeper who was returning from a walk with their five-year-old son Sean.

2500|$|Second Army's XXX Corps (now {{commanded}} by Lieutenant General Brian Horrocks) {{took part in}} Operation Market Garden, the failed attempt to secure an early crossing of the River Rhine in September 1944, which Dempsey believed could not succeed and openly questioned to Montgomery. Airborne troops secured a succession of canal and river crossings to enable XXX Corps to reach the Lower Rhine at Arnhem and wheel right into Germany. Intelligence had not detected the presence of unexpected German formations {{in the area and}} resistance proved greater than expected frustrating XXX Corps attempts to reach its final objective. During the operation, Dempsey, forward near the front with his Tac HQ, witnessed the crossing of the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division's 504th Parachute Regiment cross the Nijmegen bridge. Impressed, he later wrote that the 82nd was [...] "easily the best division on the Western front". Dempsey met with the 82nd's commander, Brigadier General James M. Gavin, shook him by the <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> [...] "I am proud to meet the commander of the greatest division in the world today." ...|$|E
2500|$|Zhang Wen {{was from}} Wu County (吳縣), Wu Commandery (吳郡), {{which is in}} present-day Suzhou, Jiangsu. His father, Zhang Yun (張允), was famous in Wu Commandery for valuing {{friendship}} and having a low regard for material wealth. Zhang Yun also served as an Official in the East Bureau (東曹掾) under the warlord Sun Quan, who became the founding emperor of Eastern Wu later. At a young age, Zhang Wen was already known for his good moral conduct and for having a dignified appearance. When Sun Quan heard about him, he asked his subjects, [...] "As of now, who is Zhang Wen comparable to?" [...] Liu Ji, the Grand Prefect of Agriculture (大農令), said, [...] "He is comparable to Quan Cong." [...] However, Gu Yong, the Minister of Ceremonies (太常), had a different opinion, [...] "Liu Ji doesn't know him well enough. No one is comparable to Zhang Wen as of now." [...] Sun Quan said, [...] "If it is so, Zhang Yun must be still alive." [...] When Zhang Wen was summoned to the Wu court to meet Sun Quan and his subjects, he impressed them with his demeanour and his eloquent responses to their questions. As {{he was about to}} leave, Zhang Zhao held his <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I entrust my plans to you. You should understand what I mean." [...] Zhang Wen was then appointed as a Consultant (議郎) and Master of Writing in the Selection Bureau (選曹尚書). He was promoted to Crown Prince's Tutor (太子太傅) later and was highly regarded by Sun Quan.|$|E
