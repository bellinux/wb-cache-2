[...] Taubin praised Ackroyd's [...] "brilliant" [...] cinematography with multiple viewpoints. She said of the film's editing, [...] "Bob Murawski and Chris Innis's editing is similarly quick and nervous; the rapid changes in POV as they cut from one camera's coverage to another's makes you <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you,</b> like the characters, are under threat from all sides." ...|$|E
500|$|At Game Revolution, Devin Charles wrote a very {{positive}} review, awarding the game a 4.5/5 score. He felt that the game was very replayable, praising the amount of content that the game delivered {{as well as its}} online play. [...] "The game's overall presentation is solid, with the commentary and action cutscenes always making you <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> {{are a part of the}} heated battles and help keep the game flowing and relevant," [...] Charles stated in his review. His only criticism was the HUT mode and how little it was altered from the previous year.|$|E
500|$|The ZX Spectrum {{version of}} Wonder Boy in Monster Land {{received}} preview coverage in Your Sinclair magazine. They praised the new additions {{made to the}} game that separated it from Wonder Boy; they called the game [...] "a good arcade adventure with a smattering of strategy thrown in". The magazine reviewed the game four months later. The reviewer noted the diverse level designs and many [...] "surprises" [...] the player will encounter, and they praised the game's learning curve, saying that it [...] "is well thought out and you really <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> made some progress before you die". It was criticized for its long multi-load times on the ZXSpectrum, its jumping mechanics in which the character [...] "floats around", and the graphics which was {{not as good as}} its predecessor. The reviewer called Wonder Boy in Monster Land [...] "a souped-up version of Wonderboy, which improves much on the original theory but at a slight cost to gameplay". Reviewers from UK-based magazine The Games Machine called it [...] "probably the best conversion you could expect on the Spectrum". Crash magazine praised the ZXSpectrum version of the game for its detailed sprites and smooth movements, playability, and combat system. The reviewer further commended the game for the differences that set it apart from the original Wonder Boy game, citing the cartoon-like feel and the vast arrays of enemies and items; just as in Your Sinclair, it was criticized for its slow multi-loading. Overall, the reviewer said the game is [...] "great fun for the experienced games player or the person just starting out in the Spectrum world". Sinclair User magazine praised its gameplay, citing the ability to stab enemies with a sword, to collect gold and items left behind, and to go into shops and pubs and buy equipment. Further praise went to the colorful and detailed graphics and animations, though they said they tend not to perform well in more complex background settings. Spanish magazine MicroHobby said that the ZXSpectrum version brought nothing new from its arcade counterpart, but the execution was good; they lauded the game's graphics and its challenging and addictive gameplay, but they criticized it for its lack of originality.|$|E

2500|$|In {{his text}} Buddho Ajahn Thate {{describes}} {{what it is}} like when the mind has finally rid itself of preoccupation with sensual distractions and is able to focus on the breath, mantra, or a part of the body, in meditation: [...] "When you first enter concentration, this is what it's like: [...] You'll have no idea at all of what concentration or one-pointedness of mind is going to feel like. You are simply intent on keeping mindfulness firmly focused on one object – and the power of a mind focused firmly on one object is what will bring you to a state of concentration. You won't be thinking at all that concentration will be like this or like that, or that {{you want it to be}} like this or like that. It will simply take its own way, automatically. No one can force it. At that moment you will <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> are in another world (the world of the mind), with a sense of ease and solitude to which nothing else in the world can compare. When the mind withdraws from concentration, you will regret that that mood has passed, and you will remember it clearly. All that we say about concentration comes from the mind which has withdrawn from that state. As long as it is still gathered in that state, we aren't interested in what anyone else says or does. You have to train the mind to enter this sort of concentration often, so as to become skilled and adept, but don't try to remember your past states of concentration, and don't let yourself want your concentration to be like it was before – because it won't be that way, and you will just be making more trouble for yourself." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kris Graft for Gamasutra {{commented that}} many players and journalists had both high {{expectations}} for the game as well as wide expectations, with some believing that it would be, among other aspects, the [...] "best space sim", the [...] "best multiplayer action shooter", and the [...] "best pure exploration game". Ars Technicas Kyle Orland found that unlike Spore or Fable which had [...] "saturation PR campaigns that promised revolutionary and industry-changing gameplay features" [...] which failed {{to be present in}} the final releases, Hello Games' statements about No Man's Sky were [...] "relatively restrained and realistic about what they were promising". Orland surmises that many players and journalists [...] "layer their own expectations onto the game's gaps" [...] from what Hello Games actually claimed. Vlambeer's founder Rami Ismail considered the strength of the marketing campaign by Hello Games and Sony to generate interest in the game, calling the pitch using the concept of magnitudes and scale rather than absolutes as [...] "a little masterclass in explaining an abstract concept to the largest possible audience"; Polygons Ben Kuchera agreed on this point, but considered that the marketing may have gotten away from Sony and Hello Games since players did not have a concrete understanding of the game's limitations prior to launch. Murray himself was aware of the [...] "unrealistic, intangible level of excitement" [...] that fans had of the game and given that they had been waiting three years to play it, would be expecting it to be perfect. He countered that he felt he and Hello Games tried to be [...] "reasonably open and honest about what the game is" [...] all throughout the marketing cycle to set expectations. On the day before the official release, Murray cautioned players that No Man's Sky may not have been [...] "the game you imagined from those trailers" [...] and instead that the title was meant as a [...] "very very chill game", giving players a universe-sized sandbox that makes you <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> [...] "stepped into a sci-fi book cover"; Murray believed the game would have a [...] "super divisive" [...] response from players due to some of these expectations.|$|E
2500|$|The Indian cricket team, humiliated in {{all forms}} {{of the game in}} the tour, was the subject of ridicule from the media and former cricketers. The Australian wrote under the {{headline}} [...] "India's pillars of strength reduced to useless rubble" [...] Dhoni is not the only shaky pillar of what only eight months ago was the number one cricket nation in the world. VVS Laxman, once the scourge of Australian bowlers, is being flayed himself at home after scores of 2,1, 2, 66, 31 and 0. Virender Sehwag, who warmed up for this series by scoring the fastest double century in One-Day International history, also is trending south faster than Scott and Amundsen, having followed up his whirlwind 67 in Melbourne with innings of 7, 30, 4, 0 and 10. Worst of all, Dhoni has failed with the bat. The Indian captain is no thunderer at the best of times – neither is coach Duncan Fletcher, which may be part of the problem – but how can he demand more of his batsmen when he has nowhere to hide behind scores of 6, 23, 57no, 2, 12 and 2? India has not had a single century-maker in the past three Tests, The Daily Telegraph said that India's performance was [...] "so bad that the first question that came Michael Clarke's way at the press conference was 'did it <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> were playing Bangladesh?'". The newspaper also played up Dhoni's one-match ban due to the Indian team's slow over-rate in the third Test. Under the headline 'Dhoni dumped from Adelaide Test', the newspaper wrote, [...] "India's shambolic tour of Australia plunged into unprecedented disarray when their captain MS Dhoni was sensationally banned from playing in the final Test due to slow over rates". The Herald Sun wrote about how Australia built up a team after the Ashes humiliation last year while sarcastically mentioning the visiting players skipping practice sessions in the tour.As painful as it was, getting flogged in last year's Ashes may be remembered as the recession Australia had to have. Nothing is being taken for granted in Australian cricket any more. The new coaching unit is working well under head coach Mickey Arthur and Australia has worked hard to freshen up every aspect of its game. India, by contrast, just lobs along, its players pocketing millions each year and too spoilt to make major sacrifices. It's appropriate that many Indian players {{spent a lot of time}} last week sitting under trees at training, because their entire Test match game is being left in the shade.|$|E

Times said: [...] "The Goode Family, which is nicely acted and well animated, works best when the cultural potshots {{give way to}} the more basic human needs of its characters: a mother's desire to be close to her daughter, or to her father (Brian Doyle-Murray as the resident voice of political incorrectness), in spite of [...] "a lifetime of crippling negative comments," [...] and a father's willingness to go outside his comfort zone to make his son happy, as when Ubuntu joins the football team. There's a show there." [...] A reviewer for NJ.com said: The Goode Family <b>feels</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> are being dropped into a foreign land without any kind of guide, or even map." [...] A reviewer for The New York Times said: [...] "Mr. Judge, who remains obsessed with the absurdities of political correctness, still has his head very much in the Clinton years, and it is possible to watch The Goode Family feeling so thoroughly transported back to another time that you wonder where all the Monica Lewinsky jokes went.

60|$|After {{a while a}} lady came along, {{riding a}} little donkey. These donkeys have amused me so much since I have been here! At several places on the {{outskirts}} of the city they have them standing, all girt up with saddles covered with white cloth, for ladies to ride on. One gets out of London by means of an omnibus to one of these places, and then, for a few pence, can have a ride upon one of them into the country. Mrs. B. walked by the side of the lady, and said to her something which I did not hear, and she immediately alighted and asked me with great kindness if I wanted to try the saddle; so I got upon the little beast, which was about as large as a good-sized calf, and rode a few paces to try him. It is a slow, but not unpleasant gait, and if the creature were not so insignificantly small, as to make <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> much <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> were riding upon a cat, it would be quite a pleasant affair.
