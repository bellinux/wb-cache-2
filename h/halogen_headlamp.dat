25|$|When a <b>halogen</b> <b>headlamp</b> is {{retrofitted}} with an HID bulb, {{light distribution}} and output are altered. In the United States, vehicle lighting {{that does not}} conform to FMVSS 108 is not street legal. Glare will be produced and the headlamp's type approval or certification becomes invalid with the altered light distribution, so the headlamp is no longer street-legal in some locales.

25|$|The first US <b>halogen</b> <b>headlamp</b> bulb, {{introduced}} in 1983, was the HB1/9004. It is a 12.8-volt, transverse dual-filament design that produces 700 lumens on low beam and 1200 lumens on high beam. The 9004 is rated for 65 watts (high beam) and 45 watts (low beam) at 12.8 volts. Other US approved halogen bulbs include the HB3 (65W, 12.8V), HB4 (55W, 12.8V), and HB5 (65/55 watts, 12.8V). All of the European-designed and internationally approved bulbs except H4 are presently approved {{for use in}} headlamps complying with US requirements.|$|E
2500|$|Silent {{film star}} Florence Lawrence is often {{credited}} with designing the first “auto signaling arm”; a predecessor {{to the modern}} turn signal, along with the first mechanical brake signal. She did not patent these inventions, however, {{and as a result}} she received no credit for–or profit from–either one. Tail lamps and brake lamps were introduced around 1915, and by 1919 [...] "dip" [...] headlamps were available. The sealed beam headlamp was introduced in 1936 and standardised as the only acceptable type in the USA in 1940. Self-cancelling turn signals were developed in 1940. By 1945 headlamps and signal lamps were integrated into the body styling. <b>Halogen</b> <b>headlamp</b> light sources were developed in Europe in 1960. HID headlamps were produced starting in 1991.

2500|$|Tungsten-halogen {{technology}} (also called [...] "quartz-halogen", [...] "quartz-iodine", [...] "iodine cycle", etc.) {{increases the}} effective luminous efficacy of a tungsten filament: when operating {{at a higher}} filament temperature which results in more lumens output per watt input, a tungsten-halogen lamp has a much longer brightness lifetime than similar filaments operating without the halogen regeneration cycle. [...] At equal luminosity, the halogen-cycle bulbs also have longer lifetimes. European-designed <b>halogen</b> <b>headlamp</b> light sources are generally configured to provide more light at the same power consumption as their lower-output plain tungsten counterparts. By contrast, many US-based designs are configured to reduce or minimize the power consumption while keeping light output above the legal minimum requirements; some US tungsten-halogen headlamp light sources produce less initial light than their non-halogen counterparts. A slight theoretical fuel economy benefit and reduced vehicle construction cost through lower wire and switch ratings were the claimed benefits when American industry first chose how to implement tungsten-halogen technology. There was an improvement in seeing distance with US halogen high beams, which were permitted {{for the first time}} to produce 150,000 candela (cd) per vehicle, double the non-halogen limit of 75,000cd but still well shy of the international European limit of 225,000cd. After replaceable halogen bulbs were permitted in US headlamps in 1983, development of US bulbs continued to favor long bulb life and low power consumption, while European designs continued to prioritise optical precision and maximum output.|$|E

25|$|High-intensity {{discharge}} lamps (HID) produce light {{with an electric}} arc rather than a glowing filament. The high intensity of the arc comes from metallic salts that are vaporized within the arc chamber. These lamps are formally known as gas-discharge burners, and have a higher efficacy than tungsten lamps. Because of the increased amounts of light available from HID burners relative to <b>halogen</b> bulbs, HID <b>headlamps</b> producing a given beam pattern can be made smaller than <b>halogen</b> <b>headlamps</b> producing a comparable beam pattern. Alternatively, the larger size can be retained, {{in which case the}} xenon headlamp can produce a more robust beam pattern.|$|R
