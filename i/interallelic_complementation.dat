25|$|Diploid organisms contain {{two copies}} of each gene. If these are {{different}} (heterozygous / heteroallelic), the two different copies of the allele may {{interact with each other}} to cause epistasis. This is sometimes called allelic complementation, or <b>interallelic</b> <b>complementation.</b> It may be caused by several mechanisms, for example transvection, where an enhancer from one allele acts in trans to activate transcription from the promoter of the second allele. Alternately, trans-splicing of two non-functional RNA molecules may produce a single, functional RNA. Similarly, at the protein level, proteins that function as dimers may form a heterodimer composed of one protein from each alternate gene and may display different properties to the homodimer of one or both variants.|$|E
40|$|Mutations {{have been}} {{described}} in human methylmalonyl CoA mutase (MCM) that exhibit partial defects in enzyme activity, including cobalamin-dependent (i. e., mut-) or <b>interallelic</b> <b>complementation.</b> This work describes mutations in cells from four patients, three of whom exhibit a cobalamin-dependent phenotype and all four of whom exhibit <b>interallelic</b> <b>complementation.</b> Four novel mutations (R 694 W, G 648 D, G 630 E, and G 626 C) are identified that cluster near the carboxyl terminus of the protein, a region close to another mut- mutation (G 717 V). Each of these mutations was shown to express a phenotype congruent {{with that of the}} parental cell line, after transfection into mut 0 fibroblasts, and each exhibits <b>interallelic</b> <b>complementation</b> in cotransfection assays with clones bearing a R 93 H mutation. The activity of mutant enzymes expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae parallels the residual activity of the parental cell lines and exhibits novel sensitivities to pH and salt. The clustering of these mutations identifies a region of MCM that most likely represents the cobalamin-binding domain. The location of this domain, as well as the pattern of sequence preservation between the homologous human and Probiono-bacterium shermanii enzymes, suggests a mechanism for <b>interallelic</b> <b>complementation</b> in which the cobalamin-binding defect is complemented in trans from the heterologous subunits of the dimer...|$|E

40|$|The enzyme {{activities}} {{specified by}} the tyrA and pheA genes were studied in wildtype strain Salmonella typhimurium and in phenylalanine and tyrosine auxotrophs. As in Aerobacter aerogenes and Escherichia coli, the wild-type enzymes of Salmonella catalyze two consecutive reactions: chorismate → prephenate → 4 -hydroxy-phenylpyruvate (tyrA), and chorismate → prephenate → phenylpyruvate (pheA). A group of tyrA mutants capable of <b>interallelic</b> <b>complementation</b> had altered enzymes which retained chorismate mutase T activity but lacked prephenate dehydrogenase. Similarly, pheA mutants (in which <b>interallelic</b> <b>complementation</b> does not occur) had one group with altered enzymes which retained chorismate mutase P but lacked prephenate dehydratase. Tyrosine and phenylalanine auxotrophs outside of these categories showed loss of both activities of their respective bifunctional enzyme. TyrA mutants which had mutase T were considerably derepressed in this activity by tyrosine starvation and consequently excreted prephenate. A new and specific procedure was developed for assaying prephenate dehydrogenase activity...|$|E
40|$|AbstractHybrid {{forms of}} human {{phenylalanine}} hydroxylase (hPAH) mutants {{have been found}} to present catalytic activities lower than predicted from the individual recombinant forms, indicating that <b>interallelic</b> <b>complementation</b> could be a major determinant of the metabolic phenotype of compound heterozygous phenylketonuric (PKU) patients. To provide a molecular explanation for <b>interallelic</b> <b>complementation</b> we have here developed a bicistronic expression system and a purification strategy to obtain isolated hPAH heteromeric forms. On co-expression of WT-hPAH (~ 50 % tetramer; ~ 10 % dimer) and the N- and C-terminally truncated form ΔN 102 /ΔC 24 -hPAH (~ 80 % dimer) no heterodimers were recovered. Moreover, by co-expression of WT-hPAH and the N-terminally truncated form ΔN 102 -hPAH (~ 95 % tetramer), heterotetramers, {{as a result of an}} assembly of two different homodimers, were isolated. The recovered (WT) /(ΔN 102) -hPAH heterotetramers revealed a catalytic activity deviating significantly from that calculated by averaging the respective recombinant homotetrameric forms. The heterotetramer assembly also results in conformational changes in the WT-hPAH protomer, as detected by trypsin limited proteolysis. The finding that the presence of two homodimers with different kinetic parameters influences the properties of the resulting heterotetrameric protein indicates that the dimers exhibit interactions which are transmitted across the assembled tetramer. The bicistronic expression system developed here allowed the isolation of hybrid forms that exhibit negative <b>interallelic</b> <b>complementation,</b> and may represent a model system for studying the molecular pathogenic mechanisms of PAH gene mutations in compound heterozygous PKU patients, providing the rationale to understand the observed inconsistencies both in genotype/phenotype correlations and in the response to BH 4 supplementation...|$|E

40|$|Deficiency of propionyl-CoA {{carboxylase}} (PCC; alpha 4 beta 4) {{results in}} the rare, autosomal recessive disease propionic acidemia. Cell fusion experiments have revealed two complementation groups, pccA and pccB, corresponding to defects of the PCCA (alpha-subunit) and PCCB (beta-subunit) genes, respectively. The pccBCC group includes subgroups, pccB and pccC, which are thought to reflect <b>interallelic</b> <b>complementation</b> between certain mutations of the PCCB gene. In this study, we have identified the mutations in two pccB, one pccC, and two pccBC cell lines and have deduced those alleles participating in <b>interallelic</b> <b>complementation.</b> One pccB line was a compound heterozygote of Pro 228 Leu and Asn 536 Asp. The latter mutation was also detected in a noncomplementing pccBC line. This leaves Pro 228 Leu responsible for complementation in the pccB cells. The second pccB line contained an insertional duplication, dupKICK 140 - 143, and a splice mutation IVS + 1 G [...] >T, located after Lys 466. We suggest that the dupKICK mutation is the complementing allele, since the second allele is incompatible with normal splicing. The pccC line studied was homozygous for Arg 410 Trp, which is necessarily the complementing allele in that line. For a second pccC line, we previously had proposed that delta Ile 408 was the complementing allele. We now show that its second allele, "Ins. Del," a 14 -bp deletion replaced by a 12 -bp insertion beginning at codon 407, fails to complement in homozygous form. We conclude that the <b>interallelic</b> <b>complementation</b> results from mutations in domains that can interact between beta-subunits in the PCC heteromer to restore enzymatic function. On the basis of sequence homology with the Propionibacterium shermanii transcarboxylase 12 S subunit, we suggest that the pccC domain, defined by Ile 408 and Arg 410, may involve the propionyl-CoA binding site...|$|E

Forty mutants are osmotic remedial; 17 of these, and no others, are also temperature-sensitive. Seven of 133 mutations are suppressible by an amber suppressor and 11 are suppressible by an ochre suppressor. Seventy percent of the mutants exhibited <b>interallelic</b> <b>complementation,</b> suggesting that the functional gene product of the met 15 gene is a multimeric protein. Relative map positions of 30 met 15 were estimated from the frequencies of X-ray-induced mitotic reversion of various heteroallelic diploids. All complementing nonsense mutations are located near {{one end of the}} gene in contrast to other nonsense mutations which span most of the gene, thus relating the direction of translation of the mRNA with respect to the fine-structure map. Recombination studies indicated that two of 30 mutants contained deletions of the entire met 15 locus. —It was established that a variety of mutational types, including missense, nonsense, and deletions, are recovered with this unique system in which both forward and reverse mutations can be {{selected on the basis of}} methyl mercury resistance and methionine requirement of the met 15 mutants...|$|E
40|$|Using 5 -fluoroorotic acid (5 -FOA) as a {{positive}} selection system we isolated mutants of Mucor circinelloides altered in the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway. These mutants {{were found to be}} deficient either in orotidine- 5 '-monophosphate decarboxylase (OMPdecase), or in orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (OPRTase) activity. Complementation tests among mutants lacking OPRTase activity classified them into three groups, thus suggesting the possibility of <b>interallelic</b> <b>complementation.</b> To investigate this hypothesis a cDNA clone corresponding to the OPRTase-encoding gene of M. circinelloides was isolated by direct complementation of E. coli. The genomic copy transformed to prototrophy one member of each of the three classes of OPRTase-deficient mutants. We therefore concluded that they were all altered at the same locus, the pyrF locus. The corresponding alleles were cloned and sequenced. Comparisons of the amino acid sequence of M. circinelloides OPRTase with those of E. coli and S. typhimurium revealed a high degree of similarity in secondary and tertiary structure. As the two bacterial enzymes exist as dimers, a homodimeric quaternary structure of the M. circinelloides mature protein can be assumed. This would also explain the <b>interallelic</b> <b>complementation</b> between some pyrF mutants. The mutations found could affect either the active site or the structure of the dimer interface of the OPRTase...|$|E
40|$|Mutations at {{the mouse}} {{microphthalmia}} locus (Mitf) affect {{the development of}} different cell types, including melanocytes, retinal pigment epithelial cells of the eye, and osteoclasts. The MITF protein {{is a member of}} the MYC supergene family of basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine-zipper (bHLHZip) transcription factors and is known to regulate the expression of cell-specific target genes by binding DNA as homodimer or as heterodimer with related proteins. The many mutations isolated at the locus have different effects on the phenotype and can be arranged in an allelic series in which the phenotypes range from near normal to white microphthalmic animals with osteopetrosis. Previous investigations have shown that certain combinations of Mitf alleles complement each other, resulting in a phenotype more normal than that of each homozygote alone. Here we analyze this <b>interallelic</b> <b>complementation</b> in detail and show that it is limited to one particular allele, Mitf(Mi-white) (Mitf(Mi-wh)), a mutation affecting the DNA-binding domain. Both loss- and gain-of-function mutations are complemented, as are other Mitf mutations affecting the DNA-binding domain. Furthermore, this behavior is not restricted to particular cell types: Both eye development and coat color phenotypes are complemented. Our analysis suggests that Mitf(Mi-wh) -associated <b>interallelic</b> <b>complementation</b> is due to the unique biochemical nature of this mutation...|$|E

The cblA gene has not been identified or cloned. We have previously described a patient with the clinical and biochemical phenotype of the cblA disorder whose fibroblasts complemented cells from patients with all known types of inborn error of adenosylcobalamin synthesis, including cblA.  METHODS—We have performed somatic cell complementation analysis of the cblA variant fibroblast line with a panel of 28  cblA lines. We have also performed detailed complementation analysis on a panel of 10  cblA fibroblast lines, not including the cblA variant line.  RESULTS—The cblA variant line complemented all 28  cell lines of the panel. There was evidence for <b>interallelic</b> <b>complementation</b> among the 10  cblA lines used for detailed complementation analysis; no cell line in this panel complemented all other members.  CONCLUSIONS—These results strongly suggest that the cblA variant represents a novel complementation class, which we have designated cblH and which represents a mutation at a distinct gene. They also suggest that the cblA gene encodes a protein that functions as a multimer, allowing for extensive <b>interallelic</b> <b>complementation.</b>    Keywords: cobalamin metabolism; complementation class; cblA; cbl...|$|E

40|$|Temperature-conditional {{mutations}} of the Notch locus {{were characterized}} {{in an attempt}} to understand the organization of a "complex locus" and the control of its function in development. Among 21 newly induced Notch alleles, about one-half are temperature-conditional for some effects, and three are temperature-sensitive for viability. One temperature-sensitive lethal, l(1) Nts 1, is functionally non-complementing for all known effects of Notch locus mutations and maps at a single site within the locus. Among the existing alleles involved in complex patterns of <b>interallelic</b> <b>complementation,</b> Ax 59 d 5 is found to be temperature-sensitive, while fa g, spl, and l(1) N are temperature-independent. Whereas temperature-sensitive alleles map predominantly to the right-most fifth of the locus, fag, spl, and l(1) N are known to map to the left of this region. Temperature-shift experiments demonstrate that fag, spl, and l(1) N cause defects at specific, non-overlapping times in development. —We conclude (1) that the Notch locus is a single cistron (responsible for a single functional molecule, presumably a polypeptide); (2) that the right-most fifth of the locus is, at least in part, the region involved in coding for the Notch product; (3) that the complexity of <b>interallelic</b> <b>complementation</b> is a developmental effect of mutations that cause defects at selected times and spaces, and that complementation occurs because the mutant defects are temporally and spatially non-overlapping; and (4) that mutants express selected defects due to critical temporal and spatial differences in the chemical conditions controlling the synthesis or function of the Notch product. The complexity of the locus appears to reside in controlling the expression (synthesis or function) of the Notch product in development...|$|E

Unlike sadl mutants defective for multiple cell cycle checkpoints, pol 2 mutants are defective only for the S phase checkpoint and the activation of DUNI kinase necessary for the transcriptional response to damage. <b>Interallelic</b> <b>complementation</b> and mutation analysis indicate that pol ϵ contains two separable essential domains, an N-terminal polymerase domain and a C-terminal checkpoint domain unique to ϵ polymerases.

These viable mutations fall into four complementation groups. The most reasonable explanation of these mutations is that they are a subset of functionally hypomorphic alleles of essential genes: hypomorphic mutations with activity levels above a threshold required for survival, but below twice that level, should behave in this manner. We refer to these mutations as "haplo-specific lethal mutations. " In studies of autosomal lethals, haplo-specific lethal mutations can be included in lethal complementation tests without being identified as such.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{although}} not uniformly accepted that ageing {{is caused by}} time-dependent accumulation of damage. A side effect of ageing is {{an increased risk of}} developing a disease, such as cancer. Yet, the primary molecular target of damage accumulation has remained obscure. A clue has emerged from the notion that human inborn premature ageing syndromes are often associated with mutations in genes involved in DNA metabolism such as nucleotide excision repair (NER). In this thesis, mechanisms of pathological and normal ageing are addressed by genocopying naturally occurring human NER mutants with accelerated ageing and/or cancer phenotype in mouse model systems. Pathological conditions associated with mutations in the XPD and XPB genes, encoding the helicase components of the multifunctional TFIIH complex, range from a dramatic 1000 times elevated cancer predisposition (Xeroderma pigmentosum) to the severe neurodevelopmental premature ageing disorders trichothiodystrophy (TTD) and XP combined with Cockayne syndrome (XPCS). The aim of this thesis is to understand the mechanisms of accelerated ageing and to uncover variables determining the immense clinical heterogeneity ofNER disorders. Chapter 1 introduces the theory of ageing, summarizes clinical consequences ofNER mutations and describes the basic DNA repair mechanims involved. Chapter 2 presents experiments revealing TTD as a progeroid syndrome and defines the crucial role of DNA damage and repair in the rate ofTTD-related ageing. Chapter 3 reveals <b>interallelic</b> <b>complementation</b> between differentially compromised XPD molecules in mice and suggests a new variable in genotype-phenotype relationships within human recessive disease. Chapter 4 shows that CS and TTD share a common root cause in defective DNA repair. Chapter 5 uncovers the widely pleiotropic effects of combining different NER defects with the latent Xp!JXPCS mutation, ranging from moderately enhanced ageing to immediate postnatal lethality. Chapter 6 describes how <b>interallelic</b> <b>complementation</b> can be used for the reconstitution of CS pathology in mice and outlines some potentials for therapy.

40|$|A {{method has}} been devised to test intergenic {{complementation}} of mutations in the mitochondrial DNA of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The test {{is based on}} the observation that diploids issued from pairwise crosses of certain mit- mutants with deficiencies in cytochrome oxidase, or coenzyme QH 2 -cytochrome c reductase, acquire high levels of respiratory activity shortly after zygote formation. Under our experimental conditions neither biochemical complementation, <b>interallelic</b> <b>complementation,</b> nor recombination has been found to contribute to any significant extent toward the respiration measured in the diploids at early times. The test has been used to study the number of complementation groups represented by a large number of mit- mutants. Results of pairwise crosses of mutants in the oxi 1, oxi 2, oxi 3, cob 1, and cob 2 loci indicate that complementation occurs between the oxi and cob loci between different oxi loci but not between the two cob loci.

It accumulates large amounts of phytoene, small quantities of phytofluene, zeta-carotene and neurosporene, in decreasing amounts, and traces of beta-carotene. This phenotype indicates that it carries a leaky mutation affecting the enzyme phytoene dehydrogenase (EC 1. 3. -. -), which is specified by the gene carB.

Here we report a genetic characterization of the Drosophila punt gene that encodes a type II serine/threonine kinase TGF-beta/Dpp (Decapentaplegic) receptor. Although the punt gene was originally identified based on its requirement for embryonic dorsal closure, we have documented multiple periods of punt activity throughout the Drosophila life cycle. We demonstrate that potentially related embryonic punt phenotypes, defects in dorsoventral patterning and dorsal closure, correspond to distinct maternal and zygotic requirements for punt. In addition, we document postembryonic requirements for punt activity. The tight correspondence between both embryonic and postembryonic loss-of-function punt and dpp phenotypes implicates a role for Punt in mediating virtually all Dpp signaling events in Drosophila. Finally, our comparison of punt homoallelic and heteroallelic phenotypes provides direct evidence for <b>interallelic</b> <b>complementation.</b> Taken together, these results suggest that the Punt protein functions as a dimer or higher order multimer throughout the Drosophila life cycle...|$|E

Mutant homozygotes do not express H 1 antigen, nor is H 1 expressed in F 1 progeny of crosses to wild-type strains homozygous for SerH 2 or SerH 3.

To this end, transgenic flies were generated that carried a yellow gene modified by the inclusion of strategically placed recognition sites for the Cre and FLP recombinases. Independent action of the recombinases produced a pair of derivative alleles, one enhancerless and the other promoterless, at each transgene location. Transvection between the derivatives was assessed by the degree of <b>interallelic</b> <b>complementation.</b> Complementation was observed at all eight sites tested. These studies demonstrate that yellow transvection can occur at multiple genomic locations and indicate that the Drosophila genome generally is permissive to enhancer action in trans...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{phenylketonuria}} (PKU) patients, {{the combination}} of two phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) alleles is the main determinant of residual enzyme activity in vivo and in vitro. Inconsistencies in genotype-phenotype correlations have been observed in compound heterozygous patients and a particular combination of two PAH alleles may produce a phenotype {{that is different from}} the expected one, possibly due to <b>interallelic</b> <b>complementation.</b> METHODS: A dual eukaryotic vector system with two distinct PAH proteins N-terminally fused to different epitope tags was used to investigate the co-expression of PAH alleles reported in patients with inconsistent phenotypes. PAH variant proteins were transiently co-transfected in COS- 7 cells. PAH activity was measured by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS-MS), and protein expression was measured by Western blot. Genotypes were compared with predicted PAH activity from the PAH locus-specific database (PAHvdb) and with phenotypes and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH 4) responsiveness from more than 10, 000 PKU patients (BIOPKU database). RESULTS: Through the expression and co-expression of 17 variant alleles we demonstrated that interallelic interaction could be both positive and negative. The co-expressions of p. [I 65 T];[R 261 Q] (19. 5...|$|E
40|$|Two mutant alleles of {{the same}} gene, each located {{in one of the}} two {{homologous}} chromosomes, may in some instances restore the wild-type function of the gene. This is the case with certain combinations of mutant alleles in the mod(mdg 4) gene. This gene encodes several different proteins, including Mod(mdg 4) 2. 2, a component of the gypsy insulator. This protein is encoded by two separate transcription units that can be combined in a trans-splicing reaction to form the mature Mod(mdg 4) 2. 2 -encoding RNA. Molecular characterization of complementing alleles shows that they affect the two different transcription units. Flies homozygous for each allele are missing the Mod(mdg 4) 2. 2 protein, whereas wild-type trans-heterozygotes are able to synthesize almost normal levels of the Mod(mdg 4) 2. 2 product. This protein is functional as judged by its ability to form a functional insulator complex. The results suggest that the <b>interallelic</b> <b>complementation</b> in the mod(mdg 4) gene is a consequence of trans-splicing between two different mutant transcripts. A conclusion from this observation is that the trans-splicing reaction that takes place between transcripts produced on two different mutant chromosomes ensures wild-type levels of functional protein...|$|E
40|$|The {{gastrulation}} defective (gd) locus encodes a novel {{serine protease}} that {{is involved in}} specifying the dorsal-ventral axis during embryonic development. Mutant alleles of gd have been classified into three complementation groups, two of which exhibit strong interallelic (intragenic) complementation. To understand the molecular basis of this <b>interallelic</b> <b>complementation,</b> we examined the complementation behavior of additional mutant alleles and sequenced alleles in all complementation groups. The data {{suggest that there are}} two discrete functional domains of Gd. A two-domain model of Gd suggesting that it is structurally similar to mammalian complement factors C 2 and B has been previously proposed. To test this model we performed SP 6 RNA microinjection to assay for activities associated with various domains of Gd. The microinjection data are consistent with the complement factor C 2 /B-like model. Site-directed mutagenesis suggests that Gd functions as a serine protease. An allele-specific interaction between an autoactivating form of Snake (Snk) and a gd allele altered in the protease domain suggests that Gd directly activates Snk in a protease activation cascade. We propose a model in which Gd is expressed during late oogenesis and bound within the perivitelline space but only becomes catalytically active during embryogenesis...|$|E
40|$|Mutations in the Punch locus {{result in}} loss of GTP cyclohydrolase activity, but all {{mutations}} do {{not affect the}} enzyme in the same way. There {{are at least three}} classes of Punch mutations. One class results in a dominant eye color, recessive lethal phenotype. A second class of mutations also causes a recessive lethal phenotype, but heterozygous mutants have normal eye color. They show loss of GTP cyclohydrolase function in all tissues where activity can be measured. Alleles comprising a third class are recessive eye color mutations that are homozygous viable. Individuals with this third type of mutation show loss of enzyme activity in the eye, but show normal or near-normal activity elsewhere. In order to examine the organization and function of this locus further, we have performed <b>interallelic</b> <b>complementation</b> tests on 25 Punch mutations, monitoring viability and enzyme activity in prepupae and adults. Most allele combinations are lethal. Those that complement do so in ways that are tissue-or stage-specific and unpredictable. Tests of mutants with tissue-specific phenotypes and of individuals mutant for complementing Punch lethal alleles lead us to conclude that Punch is a complex locus, both with respect to its organization and to its products...|$|E
40|$|Although {{compound}} heterozygosity, or {{the presence}} of two different mutant alleles of the same gene, is common in human recessive disease, its potential to impact disease outcome has not been well documented. This is most likely because of the inherent difficulty in distinguishing specific biallelic effects from differences in environment or genetic background. We addressed the potential of different recessive alleles {{to contribute to the}} enigmatic pleiotropy associated with XPD recessive disorders in compound heterozygous mouse models. Alterations in this essential helicase, with functions in both DNA repair and basal transcription, result in diverse pathologies ranging from elevated UV sensitivity and cancer predisposition to accelerated segmental progeria. We report a variety of biallelic effects on organismal phenotype attributable to combinations of recessive Xpd alleles, including the following: (i) the ability of homozygous lethal Xpd alleles to ameliorate a variety of disease symptoms when their essential basal transcription function is supplied by a different disease-causing allele, (ii) differential developmental and tissue-specific functions of distinct Xpd allele products, and (iii) <b>interallelic</b> <b>complementation,</b> a phenomenon rarely reported at clinically relevant loci in mammals. Our data suggest a re-evaluation of the contribution of "null" alleles to XPD disorders and highlight the potential of combinations of recessive alleles to affect both normal and pathological phenotypic plasticity in mammals...|$|E
40|$|During {{neurogenesis}} in the ventral {{nerve cord}} of the Drosophila embryo, Notch signaling {{participates in the}} pathway that mediates asymmetric fate specification to daughters of secondary neuronal precursor cells. In the NB 4 - 2 [...] > GMC- 1 [...] > RP 2 /sib lineage, a well-studied neuronal lineage in the ventral nerve cord, Notch signaling specifies sib fate {{to one of the}} daughter cells of GMC- 1. Notch mediates this process via Mastermind (Mam). Loss of function for mam, similar to loss of function for Notch, results in GMC- 1 symmetrically dividing to generate two RP 2 neurons. Loss of function for mam also results in a severe neurogenic phenotype. In this study, we have undertaken a functional analysis of the Mam protein. We show that while ectopic expression of a truncated Mam protein induces a dominant-negative neurogenic phenotype, it has no effect on asymmetric fate specification. This truncated Mam protein rescues the loss of asymmetric specification phenotype in mam in an allele-specific manner. We also show an <b>interallelic</b> <b>complementation</b> of loss-of-asymmetry defect. Our results suggest that Mam proteins might associate during the asymmetric specification of cell fates and that the N-terminal region of the protein plays a role in this process...|$|E
