40|$|Relapsing polychondritis is an {{inflammatory}} disease of connective tissue {{characterized by the}} destruction of hyaline and <b>elastic</b> <b>cartilages.</b> Although the etiology of this disease is unknown, the demonstration of anti-cartilage antibodies in the sera of patients with this disorder suggests an autoimmune mechanism (1, 2). Recently, Foidart et al. (3) have reported an association between relapsing polychondritis and autoimmunity to type II collagen, the major collagen type in cartilage. This finding was of particular interest because we (4) mice (7), and others (5, 6) have reported that rats and after sensitization with purified native type II collagen, developed inflammatory polyarthritis that was closely associated with an intense immune response to type II collagen (4 - 6). We have recently discovered that some rats sensitized with type II collagen also develop inflammatory ear lesions (8) characterized by an intense, destructive chondritis resembling the histopathologic process seen in human relapsing polychondritis. Described here are our findings, which closely associate {{the presence of these}} experimental lesions with the immune response to native type II collagen. These observations suggest that collagen-induced chondritis in rats might serve as an experimental model for human relapsing polychondritis...|$|R

In this study, X. laevis tadpoles {{were exposed to}} Aroclor 1254 and PCB 3 from stage 46 / 47 (system of Nieuwkoop and Faber) for up to I month postmetamorphosis. After 24 months postmetamorphosis, the degree of secondary sexual development was examined. Male oviducts were observed {{in some of the}} PCB-exposed male frogs, but not in control males. These male oviducts had not completely developed in histological structure when compared with mature female oviducts. Larynx weight and width of PCB-exposed males were significantly less than those of control males. Laryngeal histology showed that PCBs inhibited cartilaginous and muscular development of male frogs, i. e. <b>elastic</b> <b>cartilages</b> had not completely developed and laryngeal muscle fibers were smaller. In a further study on adult male frogs, a decrease in serum testosterone level was found in PCB-exposed frogs compared with controls, but serum estradiol level was not significantly affected. Our study suggests that PCBs can cause phenotypic feminization/demasculinization of male genital ducts and larynges, and these effects may, in part, result from the decrease in serum testosterone level in X. laevis.

40|$|An <b>elastic,</b> cell-rich <b>cartilage</b> {{provides}} {{flexible support}} to the highly mobile, rostral tentacle of the mastacembelid, Macrognathus siamensis. Active movement of the tentacle is effected by skeletal muscles, the muscular bellies of which are located outside the organ. The tentacle returns to its original shape by <b>elastic</b> recoil. The <b>cartilage</b> resembles plant supporting tissue and the cartilages of certain invertebrates. It {{is surrounded by a}} thick perichondrium and articulates at a synovial joint with the supraethmoid. The chondrocytes are large and shrunken within lacunae. They contain glycogen and cytoplasmic stores of RNA. The matrix is reduced to thin seams between adjacent cells, and stains strongly with alcian blue and a variety of elastic stains. Parts of the matrix are trilaminar, and such an appearance recalls the distinction between the primary cell walls of adjacent plant cells and the intervening middle lamella. The perichondrium consists of an alternating sequence of cells, circularly arranged collagen fibres and a foamy, amorphous material of unknown composition. Deep to the perichondrium, the chondrocytes are packed with intermediate filaments. Membrane-bound organelles are not prominent, though mitochondria are located at the periphery of the cell. The ultrastructural similarities between these chondrocytes and those of hyaline-cell cartilage (chondroid) support the contention that Schaffer's concept of a rigid distinction between 'true' cartilage and 'chondroid' is no longer tenable. The matrix is devoid of collagen and is most distinctive. In the immediate vicinity of the cells it consists of matrix granules and matrix fibers but, where a trilaminar appearance is easily discernible, there is a central zone that consists of large masses of amorphous material that is presumed to contain elastin. Such amorphous material has not previously been seen in any teleostean elastic tissue. By contrast, elastic system fibres, readily demonstrable elsewhere in teleosts, are conspicuously absent...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{combined}} {{study of}} effects of poroelasticity and couple stresses {{on the performance}} of lubrication aspects of porelastic bearings in general and that of synovial joints in particular are analyzed. The modified form of Reynolds equation which incorporates the <b>elastic</b> nature of <b>cartilage</b> and Stokes couple-stress fluid as lubricant is derived and solved using a recently developed wavelet multigrid method. This method has greatest advantage of minimizing the errors using wavelet transforms in obtaining accurate solution as grid size tends to zero. It is found that, 6 – 7 cycles are required to obtain a reasonably accurate solution in the multigrid scheme, whereas, only one cycle is required to obtain the solution in the wavelet-multigrid method. Also, matrix of discrete wavelet-transform acts as a natural preconditioner producing rapid convergence. It is observed that, the poroelastic bearings with couple-stress fluid as lubricant provide enhancement in pressure and ensure the increased load carrying capacity compared with viscous fluids. This {{may be one of the}} reasons in the efficient lubrication and proper functioning of synovial joints...|$|R
40|$|Articular {{cartilage}} is {{an important}} load bearing surface in joints. Prone to damage and with limited self-repair ability, it is of interest to tissue engineers.

However, the effect of this on the local depth-dependent elasticity is poorly characterised. In this study, quasi-static ultrasound elastography is used both to compare the depthdependent <b>elastic</b> properties of <b>cartilage</b> structures with two different fibril arrangements and to monitor changes in the elastic properties of engineered samples during development. Results show global and local elastic properties of the native tissues and highlight the differences caused by fibril architecture.

The technique used for a quantitative evaluation of the elastic modulus under compression against a ball microindenter (curvature radius - 350 micron) and a nanoindenter (30 [*]nm) is described. It was shown that the cartilage behavior is highly stabile under the load if the entire composite structure of cartilage tissue is engaged into the deformation process. Tribological characteristics were investigated using the ball indenter oscillated by a tuning fork.

This research used atomic force microscopy to investigate the elastic behaviour of sheep knee cartilage on nanometre scale for OA study. All indentation tests were conducted in a hydrated mode.

The corresponding indentation depth was 800 – 1, 560 nm for a healthy joint and 420 – 1, 106 nm for a severe OA grade. This study has also revealed that no significant change of the elastic property occurs to early OA.

The <b>elastic</b> modulus of <b>cartilage</b> {{is similar to that of}} the synthetic rubber of a car tyre.

Experiments with hip joints in a pendulum machine show that fluid film lubrication obtains at some phases of joint action. Boundary lubrication prevails under certain conditions and has been examined with a reciprocating friction machine.

Methods 6 months old female Sprague-Dawley rats received ACLT on right knee and randomly divided into treatment and control groups. OA developed 12 weeks after surgery. LMHFV (35  Hz, 0. 3 g) treatment was given 20  min/day and 5 days/week. After 6, 12 and 18 weeks, six rats of each group were sacrificed {{at each time point}} and the right knees were harvested. OA grading score, distal femur cartilage volume (CV), subchondral bone morphology, <b>elastic</b> modulus of <b>cartilage</b> and functional changes between groups were analyzed. ResultsIncreased cartilage degradation (higher OA grading score) and worse functional results (lower duty cycle, regular index and higher limb idleness index) were observed after LMHFV treatment (P =  0. 011, 0. 020, 0. 012 and 0. 005, respectively). CV increased after LMHFV treatment (P =  0. 019). Subchondral bone density increased with OA progress (P <  0. 01). Increased BV/TV, Tb. N and decreased Tb.

40|$|ABSTRACT Cartilage {{stiffness}} wasmeasured ex vivo at the micrometer and nanometer scales {{to explore}} structure-mechanical property relationships at smaller scales {{than has been}} done previously. A method was developed to measure the dynamic elastic modulus, jE*j, in compression by indentation-type atomic force microscopy (IT AFM). Spherical indenter tips (radius; 2. 5 mm) and sharp pyramidal tips (radius; 20 nm) were employed to probe micrometer-scale and nanometer-scale response, respectively. jE*j values were obtained at 3 Hz from 1024 unloading response curves recorded at a given location on subsurface cartilage from porcine femoral condyles. With the microsphere tips, the average modulus was; 2. 6 MPa, in agreement with available millimeter-scale data, whereas with the sharp pyramidal tips, it was typically 100 -fold lower. In contrast to cartilage, measurements made on agarose gels, a much more molecularly amorphous biomaterial, resulted in the same average modulus for both indentation tips. From results of AFM imaging of cartilage, the micrometer-scale spherical tips resolved no fine structure except some chondrocytes, whereas the nanometer-scale pyramidal tips resolved individual collagen fibers and their 67 -nm axial repeat distance. These {{results suggest that the}} spherical AFM tip is large enough to measure the aggregate dynamic <b>elastic</b> modulus of <b>cartilage,</b> whereas the sharp AFM tip depicts the elastic properties of its fine structure.

40|$|Matrilin- 1 (Matn 1), a cartilage-specific peri-cellular and {{extracellular}} matrix (ECM) protein, has been hypothesized to regulate ECM interactions and transmit mechanical signals in cartilage. Since Matn 1 knock-out (Matn 1 -/-) mice exhibit a normal skeleton, its function in vivo is unclear. In this study, {{we found that}} the anabolic Acan and Col 2 a transcript levels were significantly higher in wildtype (Matn 1 +/+) mouse cartilage than that of MATN 1 -/- mice in vivo. However, such difference was not observed between Matn 1 +/+ and MATN 1 -/- chondrocytes cultured under stationary conditions in vitro. Cyclic loading significantly stimulated Acan and Col 2 a transcript levels in Matn 1 +/+ but not in MATN 1 -/- chondrocytes. This suggests that, while Matn 1 +/+ chondrocytes increase their anabolic gene expression in response to mechanical loading, the MATN 1 -/- chondrocytes fail to do so because of the deficiency in mechanotransduction. We also found that altered <b>elastic</b> modulus of <b>cartilage</b> matrix in Matn 1 -/- mice, suggesting the mechanotransduction has changed due to the deficiency of Matn 1. To understand the impact of such deficiency on joint disease, mechanical loading was altered in vivo by destabilization of medial meniscus. While Matn 1 +/+ mice exhibited superficial fissures and clefts consistent with mechanical damage to the articular joint, Matn 1 -/- mice presented more severe cartilage lesions characterized by proteoglycan loss and disorganization of cells and ECM. This suggests that Matn 1 deficiency affects pathogenesis of post-traumatic osteoarthritis by failing to up-regulate anabolic gene expression. This is the first demonstration of Matn 1 function in vivo, which suggests its protective role in cartilage degeneration under altered mechanical environment...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Intermolecular {{repulsion}} forces between {{negatively charged}} glycosaminoglycan (CS-GAG) macromolecules {{are a major}} determinant of cartilage biomechanical properties. It is thought that the electrostatic component of the total intermolecular interaction is responsible for 50 - 75 % of the equilibrium <b>elastic</b> modulus of <b>cartilage</b> in compression, while other forces (e. g., steric, hydration, van der Waals, etc.) may also play a role. To investigate these forces, radiolabeled CS-GAG polymer chains, with a fully extended contour length of 35 nm, were chemically end-grafted to a planar surface to form model biomimetic polyelectrolyte “brush ” layers whose environment (e. g., ionic strength, pH) was varied to mimic physiological conditions. The total intersurface force (enN) between the CS-GAG brushes and chemically modified probe tips (SO 3 - and OH) was measured as a function of tip-substrate separation distance in aqueous solution using the technique of high-resolution force spectroscopy (HRFS). These experiments showed long-range, nonlinear, purely repulsive forces that decreased in magnitude and range with increasing ionic strength and decreasing pH. To estimate the contribution of the electrostatic component to the total intersurface force, the data were compared to a theoretical model of electrical double layer repulsion based on the Poisson-Boltzmann formulation. The CS-GAG brush layer was approximated as either a flat surface charge density or a smoothed volume of known fixed charge density and the probe tip was modeled as a smooth hemisphere of constant surface charge density. Modeling the CS-GAG brush as a volume charge yielded theoretical fits much closer to the experimental data and is a good first step toward deconvolution of the force components...|$|R

40|$|Mechanical {{properties}} of articular cartilage that {{are vital to}} its function are often determined by indentation tests, which can be performed at different scales. Cartilage tissue exhibits various types of structural, geometrical, and spatial variations that pose strict demands on indentation protocols. This study aims to define a reproducible micro-indentation protocol for measuring the effective (average) stiffness of the cartilage surface in a region around 1 mm(2). We elucidated how different parameters such as indenter size, indenter depth, {{and the location of}} the indentation influence the effective elastic modulus measured in micrometer scale on rat knee cartilage. When an indentation was performed (50 μm radial probe, ≈ 10 μm indentation depth) at exactly the same location, the variability was less than 10 %, even with a recovery period of 30 s. However, there was a high spatial variation and a small change of around 60 μm in location could change the modulus values up to as much as 10 - 20 fold. The effective <b>elastic</b> modulus of <b>cartilage</b> surface layer cannot therefore be reproducibly determined from a few indentations on a cartilage sample, and requires at least 144 (12 × 12) indentations for a soft spherical probe with a 50 μm radius. With higher depths, the spatial variation is slightly lower, allowing slightly lower number of indentations (≈ 80 measurements or a 9 × 9 frame) to provide a representative elastic modulus. Using this protocol, we determined an elastic modulus of 2. 6 ± 1. 9 N/mm(2) at the medial side versus a higher modulus of 4. 2 ± 2. 6 N/mm(2) at the lateral side of the tibia of 12 weeks old Wistar rats.

40|$|Purpose: Subjects with knee {{osteoarthritis}} (OA) often complain {{first of}} pain during weight-bearing activities involving bending of the knee, as climbing or descending stairs. Indications of lower external flexion moments (KFM) and lower external adduction moments (KAM) during stair ascent and descent although {{no significant differences}} were found for KAM. This study presents case studies of subjects with lateral knee OA in which medial and lateral knee contact forces (KCF), accounting for the combined effect of intersegmental, musculotendon and ligament forces, are calculated while stair ascending and descending. We hypothesize that subjects with lateral knee OA will present reduced loading on the lateral compartment trying to decrease the pain, particularly during descending stairs. Methods: Four patients with knee OA at lateral compartment (mean age of 66. 5 ± 5. 4 and BMI of 28. 0 ± 4. 3 kg/m 2) were recruited. Patient classification was based on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) demonstrating articular cartilage degeneration, subchondral BMLs and presence of osteophytes (Table 1). Hip and Knee disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score questionnaires assessed knee and hip pain. Nine healthy subjects, with no signs of knee OA as determined using MRI or complaint of pain, have also participated (mean age of 49. 7 ± 13. 2 and BMI of 27. 4 ± 3. 7 kg/m 2). Motion analysis was performed while ascending and descending a staircase consisting of seven steps at self selected speed. A 10 -camera 3 D motion capture system (Vicon) synchronized with four force platforms (embedded in the middle of the staircase) recorded the 3 D position of 34 reflective markers according to an extended Helen Hayes protocol, at 100 Hz and measured ground reaction forces at 1, 000 Hz (Kistler). A multi-body right knee model with 6 DoF for each tibiofemoral and patellofemoral joints was used. The 3 D model consisted of 14 ligament bundles as nonlinear <b>elastic</b> springs. <b>Cartilage</b> contact pressures and forces were computed using an elastic foundation model. The knee model was incorporated into a generic multibody lower extremity musculoskeletal model that includes 44 muscle-tendon units. An enhanced static optimization routine was used to calculate the muscle forces. KCF were normalized to body weight (BW). Results: Patients with lateral knee OA reduced first peaks KFM and KAM while ascending stairs (Figure 1). Decreased first peak KCF were found at the lateral (0. 807 ± 0. 127 xBW) and medial (1. 712 ± 0. 499 xBW) compartments (Table 2). However, during the second half of the stance phase, these patients showed higher KCF on both compartments.
