The two men part company, Rolando moved by grief, Arrigo with embarrassment.|$|E
25|$|Forced to {{consider}} the available Paramount stars, Wilder and Brackett focused on William Holden, who had made an impressive debut a decade earlier in Golden Boy (1939). Following an appearance in Our Town (1940), {{he served in the}} military in World War II, and his return to the screen afterward had been moderately successful. He was enthusiastic about the script and eager to accept the role. He did not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> salary was $39,000 less than that offered to Clift.|$|E

Wilf, knowing {{it to be}} a robot (and not realising there is the real Pat too), tries to unmask the Patbot. Then, the real Pat interrupts the performance. As Carbunkle releases the first few Patbots to kill off Pat, Simon Cowbell and Mr Brown, revealing that he has had enough of them hindering his plans, Josh saves them.

25|$|When the Sultanate of Banten {{decided to}} remove Prince Jayawikarta from his {{position}} because {{he was accused of}} having a friendship agreement with British without prior approval; the VOC celebrated the decision and planned a new Castle on 12 March 1619 named Batavia Castle. Coen was quiet angry to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> request to name the Castle and the city Nieuw Hoorn (after his birthplace) was not granted. Batavia Castle was nine times larger than Fort Jacatra and engulfed the eastern part of Fort Jacatra. On 30 May 1619, Coen destroyed Jayakarta and expelled its population, the area becoming part of Batavia. On 4 March 1621, Batavia was officially the name of the city as well as the center of VOC trade empire which extend from the Cape of Good Hope to Japan.|$|E
25|$|Polovtsian maidens sing {{comparing}} love to {{a flower}} that droops {{in the heat}} of the day and is revived by night. They dance together (Dance of the Polovtsian Maidens). Konchakovna joins in the singing hoping that her own lover will join her soon (Konchakovna's Cavatina). The Russian prisoners arrive from their day's work and express their gratitude when fed by Konchakovna and the maidens. Their guards retire for the night leaving just Ovlur, a Christian, in charge. Vladimir, son of Igor, sings of his hope that his love will soon join him now that the day is fading (Vladimir's Cavatina). His love is Konchakovna. She comes and the two sing of their love and their desire to marry (Love Duet). While her father will consent to the marriage, they <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> will not. They part when they hear Igor coming. He sings of his disgrace and torment at being captured with his followers dead (Prince Igor's Aria). Only his wife, he feels, will be loyal. He hopes for the chance to regain his honour. Ovlur urges Igor to escape and the prince agrees to think about it. Khan Konchak asks him if all is well (Konchak's Aria) and he replies that the falcon cannot live in captivity. Konchak says that as Igor did not ask for mercy he is not a prisoner but an honoured guest equal to a Khan. Igor reminds him that he too knows what it is to be a captive. Konchak offers Igor freedom if he will promise not to wage war on him again, but he refuses saying he cannot lie. Konchak regrets that they were not born to be allies. They would then have captured all of Russia. He summons the Polovtsian slaves to entertain Igor and himself and offers Igor his choice of them. As the slaves dance the Polovtsy sing of Konchak's glory (Polovtsian Dances).|$|E

500|$|The genus name {{is derived}} from Greek mythology. Timandra {{was the mother of}} Neophron. Aegypius was a friend of Neophron and about the same age. It upset Neophron to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> mother Timandra was having a love affair with Aegypius. Seeking revenge, Neophron made {{advances}} towards Aegypius' mother, Bulis. Neophron succeeded and enticed Bulis into entering the dark chamber where his mother and Aegypius were to meet soon. Neophron then distracted his mother, tricking Aegypius into entering the chamber and sleeping with his own mother Bulis. When Bulis discovered the deception she gouged out the eyes of her son Aegypius before killing herself. Aegypius prayed for revenge and Zeus, on hearing the prayer, changed Aegypius and Neophron into vultures.

500|$|A {{scene in}} which Ivan and Paul shared a kiss on a sofa sparked some {{controversy}} with viewers. 126 people complained to media watch dog Ofcom deeming the scenes to be explicit. The company later cleared Emmerdale of any wrongdoing, and a spokesperson said that [...] "Ivan and Paul's behaviour was no more explicit than that previously exhibited by other characters in the soap. Given the inexplicit portrayal of this relationship, we consider that these scenes were acceptable." [...] While Andy Green of the Liverpool Echo said [...] "Paul and Ivan's fumble on the sofa was probably the steamiest pre-watershed gay scene ever shown on mainstream TV." [...] Brocklebank told So So Gay's reporter that Ivan's bisexuality storyline had a [...] "huge effect" [...] on the viewers.

However, after giving up 6 home runs in his first start on April 6, tying the modern era baseball record with another knuckleballer, Tim Wakefield, he was demoted to the Rangers' Triple-A minor league affiliate, the Oklahoma RedHawks.|$|E
