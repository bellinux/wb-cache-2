25|$|Those {{supporting}} {{membership of}} Freedmen descendants {{believe they have}} a rightful place <b>in</b> <b>Cherokee</b> society based on their long history in the tribe before and after forced removal, {{with a history of}} intermarriage and active members.

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} Cherokee Freedmen, who are people of African-American descent and peoples of mixed African-American and Native American descent, who were once enslaved by <b>Cherokees</b> <b>in</b> the <b>Cherokee</b> Nation, {{and who have}} articulated their identity and tribal citizenship status as <b>Cherokee</b> Natives <b>in</b> the <b>Cherokee</b> Nation. Upon emancipation, the Cherokee Nation adopted the Cherokee Freedmen as equal citizens <b>in</b> the <b>Cherokee</b> Nation under article nine from the Treaty of 1866, but this changed after citizens were recorded on the Dawes Rolls based upon blood quantum. The theoretical framework {{of this research is}} Antonio Gramsci’s theoretical perspective of cultural hegemony and core-periphery theory. Due to cultural hegemony, these citizenship rolls are still what articulate tribal citizenship status <b>in</b> the <b>Cherokee</b> Nation today. This research uses an Afro-Indigenous epistemological approach. Also, this Master’s thesis addresses the identity politics behind citizenship status today for the descendants of Freedmen as well as legitimizes their authenticity as Cherokee Native citizens, for their citizenship status has been revoked from the Cherokee Nation, because they do not meet the required blood quantum...|$|R

25|$|Despite the Worcester v.

This {{took place during the}} Indian Removal Act of 1830. The harsh treatment the Cherokee received at the hands of white settlers caused some to enroll to emigrate west. As some Cherokees were slaveholders, they took enslaved African-Americans with them west of the Mississippi. Intermarried European-Americans and missionaries also walked the Trail of Tears.|$|E
25|$|Race {{and blood}} quantum are not factors <b>in</b> <b>Cherokee</b> Nation tribal {{citizenship}} eligibility. To {{be considered a}} citizen in the Cherokee Nation, an individual needs a direct ancestor listed on the Dawes Rolls as {{a citizen of the}} Nation, whether as a Cherokee Indian or as one of the Cherokee Freedmen. The tribe currently has members who also have some degree of African, Latino, Asian, white and other ancestry. In the case of the Cherokee Freedmen, members may be predominantly or wholly African-American. Members of the Natchez Nation joined the Cherokee Nation, as did other southeastern tribes in the 18th century.|$|E

Larry Echo Hawk, Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs, Department of the Interior, sent a letter to acting Principal Chief Joe Crittenden stating that the Department of the Interior never approved the Cherokee constitutional amendments that excluded the Freedmen descendants from tribal membership. Echo Hawk stated said that the September 24, 2011 election would be considered unconstitutional if the Freedmen descendants were excluded from voting, as guaranteed by the Treaty of 1866.|$|E

The Cherokee also believed that if a hunter showed respect and prayed before and after killing an animal such as a deer, a wolf, a fox, or an opossum would guard his feet against frostbite. The Tewa tribe believed that wolves held the powers of the east and were one of the zenith power-medicine animals.|$|E
