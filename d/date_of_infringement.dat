It aims to analyze the offense <b>of</b> <b>infringement</b> <b>of</b> the competition rules under § 248 paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code. In the introduction the document compares unfair competition within the parameters of civil and criminal law. The following chapters examine in detail the criminal offense <b>of</b> <b>infringement</b> <b>of</b> the competition rules under § 248 paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code, and further, separate chapters are devoted to specific facts of unfair competition. An additional goal of this thesis is the introduction and brief analysis of other offenses that may qualify as unfair competition, and compare them with the offense <b>of</b> <b>infringement</b> <b>of</b> the competition rules under § 248 paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code. Not only due to the possibility of criminal sanctions for unfair competition when all of the elements of the criminal offense <b>of</b> <b>infringement</b> <b>of</b> the competition rules under § 248 paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code are not completely fulfilled, but also because of a possible single concurrent act with this offense. Based on the above, the text concludes by asking and answering the question whether the current legal regulation of unfair competition in the Criminal Code is appropriate and sufficient...|$|R

40|$|Studies on EU {{policy-making}} generally {{disregard the}} key {{role played by}} the Commission as an enforcement agent responsible for the instigation and continuation <b>of</b> <b>infringement</b> cases. Furthermore, the Commission employs both amicable (‘management’) and coercive means (‘enforcement’) to induce compliance by member states, which are reflected in the different stages <b>of</b> the <b>infringement</b> proceeding. In contrast to current research, this study incorporates the perspective of the Commission on non-compliance. Based on assumptions about the relation between the Commission and member states, it is assumed that different mechanisms drive the instigation <b>of</b> <b>infringement</b> proceedings and their escalation to later stages. Thus, it is predicted that conflict in the Council and member state low level of acceptance for EU policies increase the probability <b>of</b> instigating <b>infringement</b> cases. However, the same factors are expected to make escalations <b>of</b> <b>infringements</b> to ECJ referrals less likely, because the Commission dependence on the cooperation of member states. The hypotheses are tested using a dataset on the policy preferences of the Commission and 15 member states with regards to 18 EU directives. On the basis of multinomial logit and ordered logit regression analyses, I find evidence that there are differences between the effects on the instigation and the escalation <b>of</b> <b>infringement</b> cases...|$|R
