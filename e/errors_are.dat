5|$|Although {{distinctly}} {{different from each}} other, DNA damage and mutation are related because DNA damage often causes errors of DNA synthesis during replication or repair; these <b>errors</b> <b>are</b> {{a major source of}} mutation.|$|E
5|$|Progressive {{alignments}} are {{not guaranteed}} to be globally optimal. The primary problem is that when <b>errors</b> <b>are</b> made at any stage in growing the MSA, these <b>errors</b> <b>are</b> then propagated through to the final result. Performance is also particularly bad {{when all of the}} sequences in the set are rather distantly related. Most modern progressive methods modify their scoring function with a secondary weighting function that assigns scaling factors to individual members of the query set in a nonlinear fashion based on their phylogenetic distance from their nearest neighbors. This corrects for non-random selection of the sequences given to the alignment program.|$|E
5|$|Human {{factors are}} the {{physical}} or cognitive properties of individuals, or social behaviour specific to humans, which influences functioning of technological systems {{as well as}} human-environment equilibrium. Human error is inevitable and everyone makes mistakes at some time, {{and the consequences of}} these <b>errors</b> <b>are</b> varied and depend on many factors. Most <b>errors</b> <b>are</b> minor and do not cause harm, but in a high risk environment, such as in diving, <b>errors</b> <b>are</b> more likely to have catastrophic consequences. Examples of human error leading to accidents are available in vast numbers, as it is the direct cause of 60% to 80% of all accidents. Human error and panic are considered to be the leading causes of diving accidents and fatalities. A study by William P. Morgan indicates that over half of all divers in the survey had experienced panic underwater at some time during their diving career, and these findings were independently corroborated by a survey that suggested 65% of recreational divers have panicked under water. Panic frequently leads to errors in a diver's judgement or performance, and may result in an accident. The safety of underwater diving operations can be improved by reducing the frequency of human error and the consequences when it does occur.|$|E
5000|$|Harmless <b>error</b> <b>is</b> one {{considered}} not to {{have affected}} the trial's outcome and is thus not grounds for appeal. Harmless <b>error</b> <b>is</b> distinguished from [...] "plain error" [...] in that if <b>error</b> <b>is</b> [...] "preserved" [...] by {{the making of a}} timely objection, the burden of proof is on the respondent to show that the <b>error</b> <b>was</b> harmless, but if <b>error</b> <b>was</b> not preserved, the burden of proof is on the appellant to show that the <b>error</b> <b>was</b> plain.|$|R

It is evident from Equation (28) that if F ⋍ I, the data <b>error</b> <b>is</b> small but the noise <b>error</b> <b>is</b> large due to the noise enhancement effect; however, if F ⋍ 0, the noise <b>error</b> <b>is</b> small but the data <b>error</b> <b>is</b> large, and as a result, the solution is heavily damped and {{a large part of}} it is lost.|$|R
5000|$|In {{statistical}} hypothesis testing, a type I <b>error</b> <b>is</b> the incorrect rejection {{of a true}} null hypothesis (a [...] "false positive"), while a type II <b>error</b> <b>is</b> incorrectly retaining a false null hypothesis (a [...] "false negative"). More simply stated, a type I <b>error</b> <b>is</b> the (false) detection of an effect that is not present, while a type II <b>error</b> <b>is</b> the failure to detect an effect that is present.|$|R
5|$|Loading and {{unloading}} a bulker is {{time-consuming and}} dangerous. The process is planned by the ship's chief mate under {{the direct and}} continued supervision of ship's captain. International regulations require that the captain and terminal master agree on a detailed plan before operations begin. Deck officers and stevedores oversee the operations. Occasionally loading <b>errors</b> <b>are</b> made that cause a ship to capsize or break in half at the pier.|$|E

5|$|If a {{defendant}} is convicted, the usual remedy for {{a violation of}} one of these provisions is reversal of the conviction or modification of the defendant's sentence. With the exception of structural errors (such as the total denial of counsel), constitutional <b>errors</b> <b>are</b> subject to harmless error analysis, although they must be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. With the exception of a Double Jeopardy or Speedy Trial violation, the government will usually be permitted to retry the defendant. Pursuant to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), these provisions are the source of nearly all reviewable errors in federal habeas review of state convictions.|$|E

As the sensor will probably be used in 10 – 15 [*]V like the battery nominal voltage, the consumption will range from 488 to 624 [*]mW. The maximum <b>error</b> <b>is</b> 1.74 %, this corresponds to less than 1 [*]mA error from the real behaviour.|$|R
5|$|Lag <b>errors</b> <b>are</b> {{caused by}} the fact that any changes in the static or dynamic {{pressure}} outside the aircraft require a finite amount of time to make their way down the tubing and affect the gauges. This type of error depends on the length and diameter of the tubing as well as the volume inside the gauges. Lag error is only significant around the time when the airspeed or altitude are changing. It is not a concern for steady level flight.|$|E
5|$|Only 4.46% of the {{recreational}} diving fatalities in a 1997 study were attributable {{to a single}} contributory cause. The remaining fatalities probably arose {{as a result of}} a progressive sequence of events involving two or more procedural errors or equipment failures, and since procedural <b>errors</b> <b>are</b> generally avoidable by a well-trained, intelligent and alert diver, working in an organised structure, and not under excessive stress, it was concluded that the low accident rate in professional scuba diving is due to this factor. The study also concluded that it would be impossible to completely eliminate all minor contraindications of scuba diving, as this would result in overwhelming bureaucracy and bring all diving to a halt.|$|E
5|$|Von Neumann made {{fundamental}} {{contributions to}} mathematical statistics. In 1941, he derived the exact {{distribution of the}} ratio of the mean square of successive differences to the sample variance for independent and identically normally distributed variables. This ratio was applied to the residuals from regression models and is commonly known as the Durbin–Watson statistic for testing the null hypothesis that the <b>errors</b> <b>are</b> serially independent against the alternative that they follow a stationary first order autoregression.|$|E

30|$|When {{positioning}} <b>errors</b> <b>were</b> small, {{the naive}} method and the robust method chose the same sawing positions {{to a larger}} extent than when <b>errors</b> <b>were</b> larger. This is intuitive, since for a large positioning error, the robust method chose low risk areas of the value surfaces, while if the <b>error</b> <b>was</b> small, it chose more high risk peaks. The naive method always used the absolute maximum value, meaning that such peaks were frequently chosen regardless of how large the positioning <b>error</b> <b>was.</b>|$|R
25|$|The OLS {{estimator}} {{is consistent}} when the regressors are exogenous, and optimal {{in the class}} of linear unbiased estimators when the <b>errors</b> <b>are</b> homoscedastic and serially uncorrelated. Under these conditions, the method of OLS provides minimum-variance mean-unbiased estimation when the errors have finite variances.
