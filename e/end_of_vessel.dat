40|$|One of {{the most}} {{striking}} features of developmental biology is the dramatic morphological changes that an embryo must undergo to achieve its final form. Arguably, the most stunning example of this is found in the embryonic vasculature: not only does the vasculature undergo morphological changes, it must continue to do so adaptively as the size and nutritional needs of the embryo change during gestation. As embryonic blood flow starts long before the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>vessel</b> morphogenesis, the vessels must maintain the integrity of their cell-cell contacts {{while at the same time}} remodeling into their final state. Receptor tyrosine kinases and their ligands have been implicated in the regulation of blood vessel growth and remodeling during development. Recently, the Eph receptors and their ephrin ligands were found to be expressed in the developing vasculature. While one Eph receptor, EphB 4, is restricted to veins, its specific ligand, ephrinB 2, is restricted to arteries. Furthermore, the ephrinB 2 knockout mice exhibit defects in blood vessel remodeling, angiogenesis. Although the reciprocal expression of ephrinB 2 and EphB 4 suggested that Eph signaling from arteries to veins was important for blood vessel development, the presence of additional Eph receptors suggested EphB 4 might not be required for this process. Additionally, the widespread expression of ephrinB 2 outside the vasculature suggested that vascular-specific expression of this ligand might not be the tissue source necessary for angiogenic remodeling. To determine which Eph receptor was mediating the ephrinB 2 signal, I generated a knockout of the EphB 4 gene in mouse. A reporter gene replacement in the EphB 4 locus confirmed the vein-biased expression of this receptor. Homozygous EphB 4 mutant mice exhibit angiogenesis and cardiac defects, and embryonic lethality indistinguishable from those of ephrinB 2 knockout mice. This suggests that EphB 4 is the main Eph receptor responsible for transducing the angiogenic ephrinB 2 signal. To examine the importance of endothelial specific expression of ephrinB 2 in angiogenesis, in contrast to its nonvascular expression, I generated a conditional ephrinB 2 mouse. These mice carry a functional ephrinB 2 gene, which can be inactivated in a tissue specific manner. Mice with endothelial-specific inactivation of ephrinB 2 (and intact non-vascular ephrinB 2 expression) exhibit severe angiogenesis and cardiac defects identical to those of the conventional ephrinB 2 mutant mice. This suggests that vascular ephrinB 2 is essential, and cannot be compensated for by non-vascular ephrinB 2 from surrounding vessels. These studies have clarified two important issues. The first is that the ephrinB 2 signal is received by EphB 4 expressing endothelial cells (of the veins), rather than by perivascular cells that also express Eph receptors. Second, cphrinB 2 expression in endothelial cells of the vessels is an essential tissue source of angiogenic ephrin signals. Together, these studies reinforce the original interpretation of the ephrinB 2 mutant, that Eph signaling between arteries to veins is essential for angiogenesis in the early embryo. </p...|$|E
