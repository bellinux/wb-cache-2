50|$|MPP aims {{to become}} the {{equivalent}} of a high speed 3D-printer that produces three-dimensional objects directly from powder materials. This technique is based on the process principles of xerographic printers, (for example, laser or LED printers) that combine <b>electrostatic</b> <b>printing</b> with photography. The MPP process approach uses the same fundamental principles to build solid objects on a layer-by-layer basis. Layers of powder materials are generated by attracting different metal- and/or ceramic powders to their respective position on a charged pattern on a photoreceptor by means of an electrostatic field. The attracted layer is transferred to a punch and transported to the consolidation unit where each layer of part material is sintered onto the previous by pressure and heat. The procedure is repeated layer-by-layer until the three-dimensional object is fully formed and consolidated.|$|E
5000|$|Laser <b>printing</b> is an <b>electrostatic</b> digital <b>printing</b> process. It {{produces}} high-quality {{text and}} graphics (and moderate-quality photographs) by repeatedly passing {{a laser beam}} {{back and forth over}} a negatively charged cylinder called a [...] "drum" [...] to define a differentially charged image. The drum then selectively collects electrically charged powdered ink (toner), and transfers the image to paper, which is then heated in order to permanently fuse the text and/or imagery. As with digital photocopiers, laser printers employ a xerographic printing process. However, laser printing differs from analog photocopiers in that the image is produced by the direct scanning of the medium across the printer's photoreceptor. This enables laser printing to copy images more quickly than most photocopiers.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Diamond, {{because of}} its high modulus of elasticity, {{chemical}} inertness and exceptionally high hardness, is ideal for obtaining fine surface finish and accuracy. Today’s requirement of high precision parts like magnetic memory device, laser equipment, <b>electrostatic</b> copier, <b>printing</b> machine, etc., made of non-ferrous materials, such as aluminum, copper and resin demands very high surface finish. The Polycrystalline Diamond (PCD) tool is suitable for such precision machining {{because of its}} low affinity to these materials and sharp cutting edges. PCD tools {{also can be used}} for machining of carbon, ceramics, glass, reinforced plastics, rubbers, plastics and resins, aluminum oxide, etc. In this paper, Response Surface Methodology is used to make a predictive mathematical model of surface roughness for aluminum turned using PCD tool on a CNC turning center. This model can be used for selecting the values of process variables namely work piece rpm, feed and depth of cut to get the desired value of the response i. e. surface finish within the range of experimentation.

Newer versions are large-format laser printers and focus light onto a charged drum using lasers or LEDs. The image quality produced by some electrostatic plotters was lower than that of contemporary pen plotters, but the increased speed and economy made them useful. Unlike a pen plotter, the plot time of a rasterized electrostatic plotter was independent of the level of detail of the image. [...] Modern electrostatic color plotters are found in the short run graphics industry, printing on a variety of paper or plastic film surfaces.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Commercialization of {{materials}} utilizing patterned carbon nanotube (CNT) forests, such as hierarchical composite structures, dry adhesives, and contact probe arrays, will require catalyst patterning techniques {{that do not}} rely on cleanroom photolithography. We demonstrate the large scale patterning of CNT growth catalyst via adaptation of a laser-based <b>electrostatic</b> <b>printing</b> process that uses magnetic ink character recognition (MICR) toner. The MICR toner contains iron oxide nanoparticles that serve as the catalyst for CNT growth, which are printed onto a flexible polymer (polyimide) and then transferred to a rigid substrate (silicon or alumina) under heat and mechanical pressure. Then, the substrate is processed for CNT growth under an atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition (CVD) recipe. This process enables digital control of patterned CNT growth via the laser intensity, which controls the CNT density; and via the grayscale level, which controls the pixelation of the image into arrays of micropillars. Moreover, virtually any pattern can be designed using standard software (e. g., MS Word, AutoCAD, etc.) and printed on demand. Using a standard office printer, we realize isolated CNT microstructures as small as 140 μm and isolated catalyst ″pixels ″ as small as 70 μm (one grayscale dot) and determine that individual toner microparticles result in features of approximately 5 − 10 μm. We demonstrate that grayscale CNT patterns can function as dry adhesives and that large-area catalyst patterns can be printed directly onto metal foils or transferred to ceramic plates. Laser printing therefore shows promise to enable high-speed micropatterning of nanoparticle-containing thin films under ambient conditions, possibly {{for a wide variety}} of nanostructures by engineering of toners containing nanoparticles of desired composition, size, and shape...|$|E
40|$|Original {{scientific}} paper Screening dot is {{the basic}} printing element to reproduce continuous image and to form the printing image. Printing quality depends on the transfer quality of the screening dot. It is important to control the dot gain, sharpening, deformation, doubling and slur. In practice, some specific quality control techniques are used to monitor the screening dot variation. For dot gain control technique, multi-colour scales are often used to investigate dot gain or tone change. This article aims to investigate the secondary colour dot gain in <b>electrostatic</b> digital <b>printing,</b> by considering dot gain of the colour scales, Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Blue, Red and Green. The relations between secondary colour dot gain and primary colour dot gain are studied. Three primary colour scales, Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and three secondary colour scales, Blue, Red and Green, are designed from 2 % to 90 %. The colour scales are output by electrostatic colour press and measured by spectrophotometer. The dot gain of the secondary colour scales is modelled according to the dot gain rules of the primary colour scales using multiple linear regression method. The results illustrate that the dot gain of secondary colour changes with the dot gain o...|$|R
40|$|During acts of {{physical}} aggression, offenders frequently {{come into contact}} with clothes of the victim, thereby leaving traces of DNA-bearing biological material on the garments. Since tape-lifting and swabbing, the currently established methods for non-destructive trace DNA sampling from clothing, both have their shortcomings in collection efficiency and handling, we thought about a new collection method for these challenging samples. Testing two readily available electrostatic devices for their potential to sample biological material from garments made of different fabrics, we found one of them, the <b>electrostatic</b> dust <b>print</b> lifter (DPL), to perform comparable to well-established sampling with wet cotton swabs. In simulated aggression scenarios, we had the same success rate for the establishment of single aggressor profiles, suitable for database submission, with both the DPL and wet swabbing. However, we lost a substantial amount of information with electrostatic sampling, since almost no mixed aggressor-victim profiles suitable for database entry could be established, compared to conventional swabbing. This study serves as a proof of principle for electrostatic DNA sampling from items of clothing. The technique still requires optimization before it might be used in real casework. But we are confident that in the future it could be an efficient and convenient contribution to the toolbox of forensic practitioners...|$|R

40|$|The {{applications}} involving {{electromagnetic fields}} are so pervasive {{that it is}} difficult to estimate their contribution to the industrial output: generation of electricity, power transmission lines, electric motors, actuators, relays, radio, TV and microwave transmission and reception, magnetic storage, and even the mundane little magnet used to hold a paper note on the refrigerator are all electromagnetic in nature. One would be hard pressed to find a device that works without relaying on any electromagnetic principle or effect. This text provides a good theoretical understanding of the electromagnetic field equations but also treats a large number of applications.
