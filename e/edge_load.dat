From the numerical results, {{it has been observed}} that for the rotating disc made of incompressible material, radial stress is maximum at the internal surface as compared to circumferential stress and this value of radial stress further increases with the increase in angular speed.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to find new approaches to evaluate the performance of low-consistency refiners. Data from a paper mill producing TMP from Norway spruce was used in order to find a possible way to calculate the power split between the zones in a TwinFlo refiner. An assumption of equal amount of fibres captured between overlapping bars was found successful in order to develop equations for the power split. The equations predicted equal power in both zones at equal disc gaps. The power was found to increase approximately linearly with decreasing disc gap over the range, 0. 1 - 0. 2 mm. The power split was essential to know for calculating refining intensities expressed as specific <b>edge</b> <b>load</b> and forces on fibres in the two zones. The reduction in fibre length was about 5 % at 0. 17 mm disc gap or at 0. 03 N forces on fibres or at 0. 7 J/m specific <b>edge</b> <b>load.</b> Disc gap, forces on fibres and specific <b>edge</b> <b>load</b> was found to predict fibre shortening approximately equally upon changes in power and flow rate through the refiner...|$|E

The refining conditions affect fibre morphology, pulp suspension characteristics and paper properties. In this study we investigated the effect of refining intensity - given by the specific <b>edge</b> <b>load</b> (SEL) - on the fibre and paper properties. Lower refining intensity led to lower fibre cutting, lower fines generation, and lower ºSR development. Commercial Eucalyptus globulus bleached pulp was refined in a pilot refiner, using different specific edge loads (0. 05; 0. 1 and 0. 2 J/m) and specific energy consumption of 40, 80 and 120 kWh/ton in order to evaluate paper potential. The highest specific <b>edge</b> <b>load</b> tested (0, 2 J/m) resulted in a lower average fibre length, {{as a result of}} a higher fibre cutting. The papers produced presented higher mechanical resistance, but increasing refinement energy from 80 to 120 kWh/ton did not improve paper properties.

40|$|We {{consider}} the radially symmetric nonlinear von Kármán plate equations for circular or annular plates in {{the limit of}} small thickness. The loads on the plate consist of a radially symmetric pressure load and a uniform <b>edge</b> <b>load.</b> The dependence of the steady states on the <b>edge</b> <b>load</b> and thickness is studied using asymptotics as well as numerical calculations. The von Kármán plate equations are a singular perturbation of the Fӧppl membrane equation in the asymptotic limit of small thickness. We study the role of compressive membrane solutions in the small thickness asymptotic behavior of the plate solutions. We give evidence for the existence of a singular compressive solution for the circular membrane and show by a singular perturbation expansion that the nonsingular compressive solution approach this singular solution as the radial stress {{at the center of the}} plate vanishes. In this limit, an infinite number of folds occur with respect to the <b>edge</b> <b>load.</b> Similar behavior is observed for the annular membrane with zero <b>edge</b> <b>load</b> at the inner radius in the limit as the circumferential stress vanishes. We develop multiscale expansions, which are asymptotic to members of this family for plates with edges that are elastically supported against rotation. At some thicknesses this approximation breaks down and a boundary layer appears at the center of the plate. In the limit of small normal load, the points of breakdown approach the bifurcation points corresponding to buckling of the nondeflected state. A uniform asymptotic expansion for small thickness combining the boundary layer with a multiscale approximation of the outer solution is developed for this case. These approximations complement the well known boundary layer expansions based on tensile membrane solutions in describing the bending and stretching of thin plates. The approximation becomes inconsistent as the clamped state is approached by increasing the resistance against rotation at the edge. We prove that such an expansion for the clamped circular plate cannot exist unless the pressure load is self-equilibrating. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of <b>edge</b> <b>loading</b> in hip joint replacement {{has been associated}} with many factors such as prosthetic design, component malposition and activities of daily living. The present study aimed to quantify the {{occurrence of}} edge loading/contact at the articulating surface and to evaluate the effect of cup angles and <b>edge</b> <b>loading</b> on the contact mechanics of a modular metal-on-polyethylene (MoP) total hip replacement (THR) during different daily activities. A three-dimensional finite element model was developed based on a modular MoP bearing system. Different cup inclination and anteversion angles were modelled and six daily activities were considered. The results showed that <b>edge</b> <b>loading</b> was predicted during normal walking, ascending and descending stairs activities under steep cup inclination conditions (≥ 55 °) while no <b>edge</b> <b>loading</b> was observed during standing up, sitting down and knee bending activities. The duration of <b>edge</b> <b>loading</b> increased with increased cup inclination angles and was affected by the cup anteversion angles. <b>Edge</b> <b>loading</b> caused elevated contact pressure at the articulating surface and substantially increased equivalent plastic strain of the polyethylene liner.

Hip simulator testing under a wide range of clinically relevant loading conditions is important. <b>Edge</b> <b>loading</b> of hip replacements can occur following impingement under extreme activities and can also occur during normal gait where there is an offset deficiency and/or joint laxity. This study evaluated a hip simulator method that assessed wear and damage in polyethylene acetabular liners that were subjected to <b>edge</b> <b>loading.</b> The liners tested to evaluate the method were a currently manufactured crosslinked polyethylene acetabular liner and an aged conventional polyethylene acetabular liner. The acetabular liners were tested for five million standard walking cycles and following this five million walking cycles with <b>edge</b> <b>loading.</b> <b>Edge</b> <b>loading</b> conditions represented a separation of the centres of rotation of the femoral head and the acetabular liner during the swing phase, leading to loading of the liner rim on heel strike. Rim damage and cracking was observed in the aged conventional polyethylene liner.

This study supports previous clinical findings that <b>edge</b> <b>loading</b> may cause rim cracking in liners where component positioning is sub-optimal or where material degradation is present.

40|$|The {{chipping}} {{process in}} a brittle material subjected to a uniformly applied <b>edge</b> <b>load</b> has been investigated. The present analysis extends earlier work by recognizing that as the chip is formed it may bend and change the loading at the crack tip. This geometry change introduces a nonlinear effect and has significant influence on the phenomenon. The nonlinear effect was demonstrated by incorporating it into an analytical model for a crack propagating along an interface parallel to the free surface. A finite-element analysis was then conducted to examine the crack trajectory formed in a homogeneous material. This numerical analysis showed that the crack reaches a maximum depth, and then deviates back to the free surface to form a spall. The form of this trajectory results from the additional bending moment acting at the crack tip induced by the bending of the chip and the consequent displacement of the applied load. The length of the spall {{was found to be}} approximately proportional to the square root of Ê d 5 / 2 KIC, where KIC is the fracture toughness of the material, Ê is the appropriate modulus of the material, and d is the depth over which the <b>edge</b> <b>load</b> is applied...|$|E
40|$|This thesis studies routing in {{a general}} single o-d network and {{information}} structure induced by any two heterogeneous information systems. To model the asymmetric information environment, we formulate a Bayesian congestion game, where travelers subscribing to one information system is seen as one population. We study properties of Bayesian Wardrop Equilibrium, where each population assigns their demand to routes with the lowest expected cost based on their belief. We show that if population beliefs about {{the state and the}} signal received by the other population are based on a common prior, as the population sizes change, qualitative properties of equilibrium strategies change, resulting in three distinct regimes. In the intermediate regime, the equilibrium <b>edge</b> <b>load</b> does not vary with the relative population size, and both populations face identical cost in equilibrium. In the other two regimes, the "minor" population has lower cost in equilibrium. We also introduce a metric to evaluate the impact of information. The relative population size effects the equilibrium outcome (<b>edge</b> <b>load,</b> costs) if and only if the impact of information on either population is tightly bounded by its size. Finally, we compute the bounds on the equilibrium social cost, and provide a sufficient condition for the bounds to be tight. Although we consider a more general information environment, the worst case inefficiency of equilibrium is the same as that in complete information games [...] by Manxi Wu. Thesis: S.

40|$|Wear {{and fatigue}} of {{polyethylene}} acetabular cups {{have been reported}} {{to play a role in}} the failure of total hip replacements. <b>Edge</b> <b>loading</b> of hip replacements can occur where there is sub-optimal component positioning and/or joint laxity. Wear resistance can be improved by crosslinking but the manufacturing process of these materials involves post-irradiation thermal treatments to recombine free radicals and to stabilise the materials. Stabilisation can also be achieved by adding antioxidants. Material degradation due to oxidation and manufacturing process can result in rim cracking and/or fracture due to a reduction in mechanical properties and this has been observed in vivo. A requirement for pre-clinical hip simulator testing under <b>edge</b> <b>loading</b> conditions for all of these materials has therefore been identified. This thesis describes the development and evaluation of a hip simulator <b>edge</b> <b>loading</b> protocol using accelerated aged conventional UHMWPE acetabular liners as positive controls and commercially available crosslinked UHMWPE acetabular liners as negative controls. The <b>edge</b> <b>loading</b> protocol was then used to evaluate antioxidant stabilised liners in hip simulator tests. Explanted UHMWPE acetabular liners were evaluated for wear and damage mechanisms and compared with the damage observed on the hip simulator tested liners and new methodologies were developed to measure and analyse these explanted liners. The <b>edge</b> <b>loading</b> protocol produced cracking and subsurface damage in the aged UHMWPE liners but not in the non-aged crosslinked liners. Rim deformation was observed on all liners and the volume change produced was reduced under <b>edge</b> <b>loading</b> conditions for both types of UHMWPE liner.

Specifically, this study investigated the effect of both the variations in the medial–lateral translational mismatch between the centres of the femoral head and acetabular cup and the variations in the cup inclination angles on the occurrence and magnitude of the dynamic separation, the severity of <b>edge</b> <b>loading,</b> and the wear rate of ceramic-on-ceramic hip replacement bearings in a multi-station hip joint simulator during a walking gait cycle. An increased mismatch between the centres of rotation of the femoral head and acetabular cup resulted in an increased level of dynamic separation and an increase in the severity of <b>edge</b> <b>loading</b> condition which led to increased wear rate in ceramic-on-ceramic bearings. Additionally for a given translational mismatch, an increase in the cup inclination angle gave rise to increased dynamic separation, worst <b>edge</b> <b>loading</b> conditions, and increased wear. To reduce the occurrence and severity of <b>edge</b> <b>loading,</b> the relative positions (the mismatch) of the centres of rotation of the head and the cup should be considered alongside the rotational position of the acetabular cup.

The aim of this PhD was to investigate the role of hip joint soft tissues throughout the range of hip motion to better understand their role in preventing (or perhaps even causing) these problematic load cases. A musculoskeletal model was used to investigate the muscular contribution to <b>edge</b> <b>loading</b> and found that in the mid-range of hip motion, the lines of action of hip muscles pointed inward from the acetabular rim and thus would stabilise the hip. However, in deep hip flexion with adduction, nearly half the muscles had unfavourable lines of action which could encourage <b>edge</b> <b>loading.</b> Conversely, in-vitro tests on nine cadaveric hips found that the hip capsular ligaments were slack in the mid-range of hip motion but tightened to restrain excessive hip rotation in positions close to {{the limits of}} hip motion.

40|$|A {{parametric}} {{study of}} the buckling behavior of infinitely long symmetrically laminated anisotropic plates that are subjected to linearly varying edge loads, uniform shear loads, or combinations of these loads is presented. The study focuses {{on the effects of}} the shape of linearly varying <b>edge</b> <b>load</b> distribution, plate orthotropy, and plate flexural anisotropy on plate buckling behavior. In addition, the study examines the interaction of linearly varying edge loads and uniform shear loads with plate flexural anisotropy and orthotropy. Results obtained by using a special purpose nondimensional analysis that is well suited for parametric studies of clamped and simply supported plates are presented for [q] s thin graphite-epoxy laminates that are representative of spacecraft structural components. Also, numerous generic bucklingdesign charts are presented {{for a wide range of}} nondimensional parameters that are applicable to a broad class of laminate constructions. These charts show explicitl [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Calculations were {{performed}} on a pressurized thin spherical shell with a sealed opening for material obeying a simple r-power steady creep law; they were done by an iterative procedure on an IBM 7090 computer. The results, in terms of stress resultant distributions and deformation patterns in the neighbourhood of the opening for different eQge load boundary conditions, were examined critically {{with a view to}} detecting simple overall patterns of behaviour which are a function of the creep index r. Examination of the results from two different points of view leads to the conclusions that stress concentration factors vary smoothly and almost linearly with l / r and that deformation patterns are practically independent of r, for the same <b>edge</b> <b>load</b> boundary conditions. The strain rate concentration factors may be very high. The consequences of these conclusions are examined {{in the context of the}} design process...|$|E
40|$|An {{elasticity}} {{solution is}} obtained {{to the problem}} of a thin, laminated, isotropic circular plate under combined transverse and <b>edge</b> <b>loading.</b> The analysis yields an approximate, thin-plate theory which reduces to an exact, closed-form solution when the plate is <b>loaded</b> by <b>edge</b> forces and moments only. The results show that, under <b>edge</b> <b>loading,</b> the stress state is purely biaxial, there being no interlaminar normal or shearing stresses such as are usually present in bulk composite bodies. Further, an estimate of the edge-effect correction which is present when the applied stress distribution does not match the internal stress distribution, discloses no unusual effects due to the laminated structure. Under combined loading, a complex state of in-plane, normal and shearing stresses exists which is coupled through the property variations...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a dynamic {{stability}} analysis of unidirectional fiber-reinforced composite viscoelastic plates subjected to compressive <b>edge</b> <b>loads.</b> The integrodifferential equations governing the stability problem are obtained by using, {{in conjunction with a}} Boltzmann hereditary constitutive law for a three-dimensional viscoelastic medium, a higher-order shear deformation theory of orthotropic plates. Such a theory incorporates transverse shear deformation, transverse normal stress, and rotatory inertia effects. The solution of the stability problem as considered within this paper concerns the determination of the critical in-plane <b>edge</b> <b>loads</b> yielding the asymptotic instability. Numerical applications, based on material properties derived within the framework of Aboudi's micromechanical model, are presented and pertinent conclusions concerning the nature of the loss of stability and the influence of various parameters are outlined...|$|R
40|$|AbstractEdge loading can {{negatively}} {{impact the}} biomechanics and long-term performance of hip replacements. Although <b>edge</b> <b>loading</b> {{has been widely}} investigated for hard-on-hard articulations, limited work has been conducted for hard-on-soft combinations. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate <b>edge</b> <b>loading</b> and its effect on the contact mechanics of a modular metal-on-polyethylene (MoP) total hip replacement (THR). A three-dimensional finite element model was developed based on a modular MoP bearing. Different cup inclination angles and head lateral microseparation were modelled and their effect on the contact mechanics of the modular MoP hip replacement were examined. The results showed that lateral microseparation caused loading of the head on the rim of the cup, which produced substantial increases in the maximum von Mises stress in the polyethylene liner and the maximum contact pressure on both the articulating surface and backside surface of the liner. Plastic deformation of the liner was observed under both standard conditions and microseparation conditions, however, the maximum equivalent plastic strain in the liner under microseparation conditions of 2000 µm was predicted to be approximately six times that under standard conditions. The study has indicated that correct positioning the components to avoid <b>edge</b> <b>loading</b> is likely to be important clinically even for hard-on-soft bearings for THR...|$|R
