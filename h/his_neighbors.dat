5|$|The Gospel of Mark {{reports that}} Jesus comes into {{conflict}} with <b>his</b> <b>neighbors</b> and family.|$|E
5|$|Marshall did {{not believe}} in rule by the masses, {{frequently}} expressing his disdain for the common people. His sharp wit and lack of tact in writing did little to endear him to <b>his</b> <b>neighbors.</b> Like most of the members of his family, he subscribed to Federalist principles, although the majority of Kentuckians were affiliated with the Democratic-Republicans. He was also ostracized by many of <b>his</b> <b>neighbors</b> for being zealously antireligious. He wrote pamphlets denouncing religion of all kinds and published them at his own expense. His later descendants were so embarrassed of his anti-religious writings that they had his personal papers burned.|$|E
5|$|For {{more than}} a millennium, silk {{remained}} the principal diplomatic gift of the emperor of China to <b>his</b> <b>neighbors</b> or to his vassals. The use of silk became so important that silk (糸) soon constituted {{one of the principal}} radicals of Chinese script.|$|E
50|$|Additional Information:William Deakle that J W. Moore {{mentions}} in {{the letters}} from the battlefield was <b>his</b> <b>neighbor.</b> Betty that he mentions {{in the letters}} was also <b>his</b> <b>neighbor</b> Betty Shem.|$|R
50|$|He {{stops at}} <b>his</b> <b>neighbor's</b> place {{to rest for}} the night, and he tells the <b>neighbor</b> <b>his</b> story. The <b>neighbor</b> tells him he would hate {{to be in his}} shoes, because his wife would be very upset with him if he came home with nothing. Gudbrand tells <b>his</b> <b>neighbor</b> {{that he and his wife}} get along fine, and she will {{understand}} and agree with his decisions.|$|R
50|$|The New York Times {{reported}} in 2009 that Murphy {{had tried to}} persuade the buyer of <b>his</b> <b>neighbor's</b> house to buy his house instead. According to the article, the effort failed and <b>his</b> <b>neighbor</b> found out what {{he had tried to}} do.|$|R
5|$|Harding {{elected to}} conduct a front porch campaign, like McKinley in 1896. Some years earlier, Harding had had his front porch remodeled to {{resemble}} McKinley's, which <b>his</b> <b>neighbors</b> felt signified presidential ambitions. The candidate remained at home in Marion and gave addresses to visiting delegations. In the meantime, Cox and Roosevelt stumped the nation, giving hundreds of speeches. Coolidge spoke in the Northeast, {{later on in the}} South, and was not a significant factor in the election.|$|E
5|$|Jennings {{died of a}} heart attack, {{most likely}} brought on by another bout with jaundice, on July 26, 1834, at his farm near Charlestown. He was fifty years old. Jennings was buried after a brief {{ceremony}} in an unmarked grave. His estate lacked the funds to purchase a headstone. Jennings's creditors, many of whom were <b>his</b> <b>neighbors,</b> were left unpaid and disgruntled. Following Jennings's death, Tipton sold the Jennings farm to Joseph Carr and gave Jennings's widow a $100 gift from the proceeds.|$|E
5|$|Plume {{harvesting}} {{became a}} dangerous business. The Audubon Society became {{concerned with the}} amount of hunting being done in rookeries in the mangrove forests. In 1902, they hired a warden, Guy Bradley, to watch the rookeries around Cuthbert Lake. Bradley had lived in Flamingo within the Everglades, and was murdered in 1905 by one of <b>his</b> <b>neighbors</b> after he tried to prevent him from hunting. Protection of birds was the reason for establishing the first wildlife refuge when President Theodore Roosevelt set Pelican Island as a sanctuary in 1903.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, Keillor {{created a}} {{controversy}} in St. Paul when he {{filed a lawsuit}} against <b>his</b> <b>neighbor's</b> plan to build an addition on their home, citing his need for [...] "light and air" [...] and a view of [...] "open space and beyond". Keillor's home is significantly larger than others in his neighborhood and would still be significantly larger than <b>his</b> <b>neighbor's</b> with its planned addition. Keillor came to an undisclosed settlement with <b>his</b> <b>neighbor</b> shortly after the story became public.|$|R
50|$|Based on a {{story by}} Robert Hardy Andrews, the film is about an {{architect}} Gordon Wales (Wayne) who finds <b>his</b> <b>neighbor</b> Marcia Tallant (Marsh) locked out and flirts with her. When {{he is accused of}} murdering a racketeer, he becomes romantically involved with <b>his</b> <b>neighbor's</b> roommate.|$|R
50|$|Local legend {{states that}} Daniel Boone lived {{along the banks}} of Big Sugar Creek and led some of the early {{settlers}} through the Ozark trails. When ready to die, Boone made himself a walnut coffin, but <b>his</b> <b>neighbor's</b> wife died suddenly and Boone gave the coffin to <b>his</b> <b>neighbor.</b>|$|R
5|$|Sunday {{was welcomed}} into {{the circle of}} the social, economic, and {{political}} elite. He counted among <b>his</b> <b>neighbors</b> and acquaintances several prominent businessmen. Sunday dined with numerous politicians, including Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson, and counted both Herbert Hoover and John D. Rockefeller, Jr. as friends. During and after the 1917 Los Angeles campaign, the Sundays visited with Hollywood stars, and members of Sunday's organization played a charity baseball game against a team of show business personalities that included Douglas Fairbanks, Sr.|$|E
5|$|The {{television}} series Jackass {{is referred to}} frequently by Peter and <b>his</b> <b>neighbors,</b> and is the principal reason that they try to do stunts. Johnny Knoxville cameoes and takes a shotgun blast which blows off part of his face. In the episode, while being launched off a ramp and flying through the air, Peter wears the costume from The Greatest American Hero and sings the series' theme song.|$|E
5|$|After Barrington {{suffered}} a paralytic stroke in early 1919, {{he was unable}} to perform. He spent {{the rest of his life}} in poverty, although his fellow actors held benefits and made other efforts to help him, and his brothers and <b>his</b> <b>neighbors</b> in East Hagbourne, Berkshire, helped him as he became increasingly disabled and eventually unable even to speak. He died in 1922 while living at the St. James's Infirmary, Balham, in South London, at the age of 69 and is buried in Lower Morden Lane at the Morden Cemetery, also known as Battersea New Cemetery, in Surrey. On the 75th anniversary of Barrington's death, a granite monument with a photoplaque of Barrington as Pooh-Bah was dedicated to him at the Morden Cemetery, by members of the Gilbert and Sullivan Society, the Sir Arthur Sullivan Society and others.|$|E
50|$|Saber-Toothed Tiger: Alan Evans notices three menacing-looking cats {{hanging around}} {{his house and}} hears them talking—making plans to eat <b>his</b> <b>neighbor.</b> When <b>his</b> <b>neighbor</b> vanishes, Alan is alarmed, {{especially}} since the felines now have their eyes on him. He fights back by turning himself into a cat—a very big cat.|$|R

5|$|Arthur Compton, the {{chairman}} of the University of Chicago physics department, coordinated the uranium research of Columbia University, Princeton University, the University of Chicago, and the University of California, Berkeley. To remove disagreement and duplication, Compton transferred the scientists to the Metallurgical Laboratory at Chicago. Teller was left behind at first, because while he and Mici were now American citizens, they still had relatives in enemy countries. In early 1943, the Los Alamos laboratory was established in Los Alamos, New Mexico to design an atomic bomb, with Oppenheimer as its director. Teller moved there in March 1943. Apparently, Teller managed to annoy <b>his</b> <b>neighbors</b> there by playing the piano late in the night.|$|E
5|$|Born January 9, 1967, in Denver, Colorado, Matt Bevin was {{the second}} of six {{children}} born to Avery and Louise Bevin. He {{grew up in the}} rural town of Shelburne, New Hampshire, in a small farmhouse heated by wood-fired stoves. His father worked at a wood mill, and his mother worked part-time in a hospital admissions department. The family raised livestock and grew much of their own food. At age 6, Bevin made money by packaging and selling seeds to <b>his</b> <b>neighbors.</b> He credits his involvement in 4-H, where he {{served as president of the}} local and county chapters and as a member of the state teen council, with developing his public speaking and leadership skills. He was also involved with the county's Dairy Club.|$|E
5|$|Evan {{suspects}} {{that one of}} <b>his</b> <b>neighbors</b> is an alien due to his strange, stiff way of speaking and because he {{always seems to be}} watching Evan. As the watch scouts the neighbor's house, Bob learns that Chelsea is at an unsupervised party with Jason. Bob disobeys Evan's orders and rushes to the party with Franklin. Bob prevents Jason from raping Chelsea, but Jason beats him until Franklin intervenes. Evan and Jamarcus investigate the odd neighbor alone, discovering that he hosts orgies in his basement. When Bob returns, he and Evan argue over his putting his daughter above the watch. Bob is fired from the watch after saying Evan has no friends because he tries to control everything. Evan goes home and admits his infertility to Abby, who accepts the news and tells him they will work things out.|$|E

5|$|It is {{said that}} the MacIntyre chief {{at the time of}} the Jacobite rising of 1745, James (born c. 1727), would have joined the clans {{rallying}} to Prince Charles Edward Stuart but was dissuaded from doing so by his wife, who was a Campbell, and <b>his</b> <b>neighbors.</b> His loyalties to the Campbells were further deepened by the fact that his legal studies had been sponsored by the Campbell Earl of Breadalbane. Nonetheless, many MacIntyres were in the clan regiment of Stewart of Appin in the campaign of 1745–46, but they did not serve as an independent body.|$|E
5|$|On {{a council}} held in Constantinople on the {{relations}} with Bulgaria {{it was decided}} that the two countries should begin negotiations despite the calls for punishing the Bulgarians for the invasion. Michael Shishman divorced his wife Anna Neda and married Theodora Palaiologina, the 35-year-old widow of emperor Theodore Svetoslav. The exact reasons for that act are unclear. Many historians suggest that the deterioration of the Bulgarian-Serbian relations was rooted in the Serbian penetration in Macedonia. The marriage cemented the peace treaty with the Byzantine Empire but the need for an ally against the Serbs made Michael Shishman prone to make concessions. It was decided that the border should follow the Philippopolis-Chernomen-Sozopol line. The agreement was finally signed in the autumn of 1324 and Michael Shishman spent the next several years at peace with <b>his</b> <b>neighbors.</b>|$|E
5|$|Osorkon IV {{ascended to}} the throne of Tanis in c.730 BC, {{at the end of}} the long reign of his {{predecessor}} Shoshenq V of the 22nd Dynasty, who was possibly also his father. However, this somewhat traditional collocation was first challenged in 1970 by Karl-Heinz Priese who preferred to place Osorkon IV in a lower–Egyptian branch of the 23rd Dynasty, right after the reign of the shadowy pharaoh Pedubast II; this placement found the support of a certain number of scholars. Osorkon's mother, named on a electrum aegis of Sekhmet now in the Louvre, was Tadibast III. Osorkon IV's realm was restricted only to the district of Tanis (Rˁ-nfr) and the territory of Bubastis, both in the eastern Nile Delta. <b>His</b> <b>neighbors</b> were Libyan princes and Meshwesh chiefs who ruled their small realms outside of his authority.|$|E
2500|$|Thomas Aquinas {{points out}} that just as [...] "Thou shalt not kill" [...] forbids one to injure <b>his</b> <b>neighbor</b> in <b>his</b> own person; and [...] "Thou shalt not commit adultery" [...] forbids {{injury to the person}} to whom one is bound in marriage; the Commandment, [...] "Thou shalt not steal," [...] forbids one to injure <b>his</b> <b>neighbor</b> in <b>his</b> goods.|$|R
50|$|Marshall kills <b>his</b> <b>neighbor.</b> When the Inspector hears of {{this second}} death, he sets a trap {{in which he}} pretends to frame <b>his</b> <b>neighbor's</b> long-suffering {{innocent}} wife for the murder. The success of the trap depends on Marshall's coming forward, rather than letting the innocent woman hang. The inspector believes that, in spite of everything, Marshall has never lost his innate decency.|$|R

5|$|Peter {{decides to}} go fishing with Quagmire and Joe, but when Quagmire does not show up, they decide {{to try to find}} him at his house. After {{entering}} his home, they discover that he has hanged himself in a fit of autoerotic asphyxiation. Attempting to save his life, they take him to the hospital, where they discover that he is in a coma. Peter invites Quagmire's sister, Brenda, to visit him at the hospital, and she manages to wake up her brother. Brenda also brings along Jeffery Fecalman, her obnoxious, aggressive and abusive boyfriend, who harasses her throughout the night much to the fury and concern of Quagmire and <b>his</b> <b>neighbors.</b>|$|E
5|$|Whale {{was born}} in Dudley, England, the sixth of seven {{children}} of William, a blast furnaceman, and Sarah, a nurse. He attended Kates Hill Board School, followed by Bayliss Charity School and finally Dudley Blue Coat School. His attendance stopped in his teenage years because the cost would have been prohibitive and his labor was needed to help support the family. Thought not physically strong enough to follow his brothers into the local heavy industries, Whale started work as a cobbler, reclaiming the nails he recovered from replaced soles and selling them for scrap for extra money. He discovered he had some artistic ability and earned additional money lettering signs and price tags for <b>his</b> <b>neighbors.</b> He used his additional income to pay for evening classes at the Dudley School of Arts and Crafts.|$|E
5|$|At Governor William Dennison's request, Garfield {{deferred}} {{his military}} ambitions {{to remain in}} the legislature, where he helped appropriate the funds to raise and equip Ohio's volunteer regiments. Afterward, the legislature adjourned and Garfield spent the spring and early summer on a speaking tour of northeastern Ohio, encouraging enlistment in the new regiments. Following a trip to Illinois to purchase muskets, Garfield returned to Ohio and, in August 1861, received a commission as a colonel in the 42nd Ohio Infantry regiment. The 42nd Ohio existed only on paper, so Garfield's first task was to fill its ranks. He did so quickly, recruiting many of <b>his</b> <b>neighbors</b> and former students. The regiment traveled to Camp Chase, outside Columbus, Ohio, to complete training. In December, Garfield was ordered to bring the 42nd to Kentucky, where they joined the Army of the Ohio under Brigadier General Don Carlos Buell.|$|E
5000|$|He {{places a}} bet with <b>his</b> <b>neighbor</b> for one hundred dollars {{that he has}} at home. The bet is that Gudbrand's wife will not be displeased with his {{decisions}} and <b>his</b> <b>neighbor</b> accepts. The next day Gudbrand and <b>his</b> <b>neighbor</b> head off to his home where the neighbor hides behind the door while Gudbrand greets his wife and explains to her {{the details of his}} travels. As he tells her of his trades, she finds a positive side to all of his decisions, and with tells of selling the rooster because he needed food to get home, she exclaims, [...] "Now God be praised that you did so! Whatever you do, you do it always just after my own heart. Heaven be thanked that I have got you safe back again; you who do everything so well that I want neither rooster nor goose; neither pigs nor kine." [...] Gudbrand wins the bet with <b>his</b> <b>neighbor.</b>|$|R
