5|$|The {{electric}} shock delivered by a marbled <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> can be severe {{but is not}} directly life-threatening. Its electrogenic properties have been known since classical antiquity, when live rays were used to treat conditions such as chronic headaches. This and other <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> species are used as model organisms in biomedical research. Various coastal demersal fisheries take the marbled <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> as bycatch; captured rays are usually discarded as they have little commercial value. The impact of fishing on its population is uncertain, and thus International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this ray under Data Deficient. In the Mediterranean Sea, it remains the most common <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> and in some areas may be increasing in number.|$|E
5|$|The only <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> found off western North America, the Pacific <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> {{occurs as}} far south as Sebastian Vizcaino Bay in Baja California, and as far north as the Dixon Entrance in {{northern}} British Columbia. It is most common south of Point Conception, California, with the rays north of the Point perhaps representing one or more separate populations.|$|E

5|$|The marbled <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> {{is caught}} {{incidentally}} in bottom trawls, trammel nets, and bottom longlines; {{it has little}} economic value and is mostly discarded at sea when captured. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) presently lacks enough population and fishery data to assess its conservation status beyond Data Deficient. At least in the northern Mediterranean, surveys have found that it remains the most common <b>electric</b> <b>ray,</b> and is perhaps becoming more abundant in Italian waters. This and other <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> species are used as model organisms in biomedical research because their electric organs are rich in acetylcholine receptors, which {{play an important role}} in the human nervous system.|$|E
5|$|The shock {{from the}} ocellated <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> is not {{dangerous}} to humans. It occasionally {{appears in the}} home aquarium trade, but is difficult to keep because it requires live invertebrates for food. The ocellated <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> and other electric rays are used as model organisms in biomedical research because their electric organs are rich in ion channels and acetylcholine receptors, which play important roles in the human nervous system. The protein agrin, which concentrates acetylcholine receptors during human embryonic development, was first isolated from this species. Though the ocellated <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> is not utilized economically, it is caught incidentally by shrimp trawlers. Its mortality from fishing has not been quantified but {{is thought to be}} high, considering that trawling operations in the Atlantic are known to take Diplobatis species in large numbers. The catch rate is also probably underestimated due to problematic identification. Given the restricted range of this species and the intensity of trawling within its habitat, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Vulnerable.|$|E
5|$|Known parasites of the marbled <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> {{include the}} {{tapeworms}} Anthocephalum gracile and Calyptrobothrium riggii, the leeches Pontobdella muricata and Trachelobdella lubrica, the monogeneans Amphibdella torpedinis, Amphibdelloides kechemiraen, A. maccallumi, A. vallei, Empruthotrema raiae, E. torpedinis, and Squalonchocotyle torpedinis, and the nematodes Ascaris torpedinis and Mawsonascaris pastinacae.|$|E
50|$|Tetronarce is a genus of rays, {{commonly}} known as <b>electric</b> <b>rays.</b> They are slow-moving bottom-dwellers capable of generating electricity as a defense and feeding mechanism.

5|$|Solitary and nocturnal, the Pacific <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> can {{generate}} up to 45 volts of electricity {{for the purposes}} of subduing prey or self-defense. It feeds mainly on bony fishes, ambushing them from the substrate during the day and actively hunting for them at night. Reproduction is aplacental viviparous, meaning that the embryos are initially nourished by yolk, later supplemented by histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother. Females bear litters of 17–20 pups, probably once every other year. Care should be exercised around the Pacific <b>electric</b> <b>ray,</b> as it has been known to act aggressively if provoked and its electric shock can potentially incapacitate a diver. It and other electric rays are used as model organisms for biomedical research. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species under Least Concern, as it is not fished in any significant numbers.|$|E
5|$|Solitary and slow-moving, the marbled <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> {{may remain}} {{motionless}} {{for several days}} at a time. It is more active at night and spends {{much of the day}} buried in sediment with only the eyes and spiracles showing. Consistent with its sluggish nature, the marbled <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> has a low blood oxygen carrying capacity and heart rate (10–15 beats/min), and consumes less oxygen than other sharks and rays of similar size. It is highly tolerant of being deprived of oxygen (hypoxia), allowing it to cope with deoxygenated bottom waters or being stranded in small pools by the falling tide. The ray stops breathing entirely when the oxygen partial pressure in the water drops below 10–15 Torr, and can survive such a state for at least five hours. It deals with extreme hypoxia by coupling anaerobic glycolysis to additional energy-producing pathways in its mitochondria, which serves to slow down the accumulation of potentially harmful lactate within its cells.|$|E
5|$|The Pacific <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> was {{described}} by American ichthyologist William Orville Ayres, the first Curator of Ichthyology at the California Academy of Sciences, who named it after the U.S. state where it was first discovered by science. Ayers published his account in 1855, in the inaugural volume of the Academy's Proceedings; no type specimens were designated. In 1861, Theodore Gill placed this species in his newly created genus Tetronarce, {{on the basis of}} its smooth-rimmed spiracles. Later authors have generally regarded Tetronarce as a subgenus of Torpedo. Closely similar electric rays found off Peru, Chile, and Japan may be the same as this species. Other common names used for this ray include California torpedo ray, Pacific torpedo, or simply <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> or torpedo ray. This species is placed in the genus Tetronarce.|$|E

50|$|Lesser <b>electric</b> <b>rays</b> feed {{mainly on}} polychaete annelids. They also eat {{juvenile}} snake eels, sea anemones, small bony fish and various crustaceans.|$|R
5|$|The marbled <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> is {{an ambush}} {{predator}} that employs electricity to capture prey. Vision {{is of little}} importance in hunting, as the ray's eyes are often obscured as it lies buried on the bottom. Instead, it likely relies on the mechanoreceptors of its lateral line, as it only attacks moving prey. The electroreceptive ampullae of Lorenzini may also contribute to prey detection.|$|E

5|$|Within {{the genus}} Torpedo, the marbled <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> {{belongs to the}} {{subgenus}} Torpedo, which differs from the other subgenus Tetronarce in having fringed margins on their spiracles and generally ornate dorsal coloration. Other common names for this species include common crampfish, marbled torpedo, numbfish, and spotted torpedo.|$|E
50|$|The blind <b>electric</b> <b>rays</b> are small, flat {{cartilaginous}} {{fish with}} the round pectoral fin disc characteristic of <b>electric</b> <b>rays,</b> a short, fleshy tail, and one dorsal fin. The front {{part of their}} pelvic fins are modified for walking, while the back is fused to the disk. Their eyes are not visible externally and are practically useless, hence the name. The coloration is dark brown above and lighter below. T. aysoni grows to a maximum length of 38 cm and T. tarakea to 35 cm.|$|R
50|$|The family Torpedinidae {{contains}} 22 {{species of}} <b>electric</b> <b>rays</b> or torpedoes, flat cartilaginous fishes that produce electricity {{as a defense}} and feeding mechanism. They are slow-moving bottom-dwellers.|$|R
50|$|The diet of the black-spotted torpedo {{consists}} {{of fish and}} cuttlefish, which are probably stunned using electricity. Like other <b>electric</b> <b>rays</b> it is ovoviviparous, with parturition taking place in summer.|$|R
5|$|Bottom-dwelling in nature, the marbled <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> inhabits rocky {{reefs and}} {{seagrass}} beds, {{as well as}} nearby areas with sandy or muddy bottoms. During warm summer months, pregnant females are known to migrate into Arcachon Bay in northwestern France, where they are commonly found in very shallow, muddy pools near oyster beds. This species may conduct a northward migration in summer and autumn, into {{the waters of the}} British Isles.|$|E
5|$|The Pacific <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> and its {{relatives}} {{are used as}} model organisms for biomedical research, because their electric organs contain an abundance of important nervous system proteins such as nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and acetylcholinesterase. In the 1970s and 1980s, acetylcholine receptors from this species and the marbled <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> (T.marmorata) became the first neurotransmitter receptors to be isolated and sequenced, in what {{is considered to be}} a landmark success in the field of neurobiology. This led to a number of further advances, one of the most significant being the elucidation of the pathophysiology underlying the disease myasthenia gravis. A small commercial fishery in southern California supplies Pacific electric rays for research purposes; as of 2005 this fishery may have employed as few as two fishers. Otherwise, this ray has no economic value. It is caught incidentally by commercial trawl and gillnet fisheries, and on hook-and-line by sport anglers. These activities appear to have little impact on its population, leading it to be listed under Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Fishing for this ray is not managed by the Pacific Fishery Management Council.|$|E
5|$|The shock {{delivered}} by the marbled <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> can be painful but is seldom life-threatening, {{although there is a}} danger of a shocked diver becoming disoriented underwater. Its electrogenic properties have been known since classical antiquity, leading it and other electric fishes to be used in medicine. The ancient Greeks and Romans applied live rays to those afflicted with conditions such as chronic headaches and gout, and recommended that its meat be eaten by epileptics.|$|E
50|$|Some of {{the aquatic}} animals {{found in the}} park are sawfish, butter fish, <b>electric</b> <b>rays,</b> silver carp, starfish, common carp, {{horseshoe}} crabs, prawn, shrimps, Gangetic dolphins, skipping frogs, common toads and tree frogs.|$|R
50|$|Like {{all species}} of <b>{{electric}}</b> <b>rays,</b> B. yangi uses its electric shocks to paralyze prey. Remains of polychaete worms {{are found in}} some specimens, meaning that these animals are the preferred prey of B. yangi.|$|R
50|$|Along {{with other}} <b>electric</b> <b>rays,</b> the apron ray is {{important}} to neuroscience {{in the study of}} cholinergic synaptic transmissions, due to the high concentration of acetylcholine receptor and acetylcholinesterase in the cells of their electric organs.|$|R
5|$|Because of {{its large}} size and {{formidable}} defenses, The Pacific <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> seldom falls prey to other animals. There {{is a record}} of one being fed upon by a killer whale (Orcinus orca) off Santa Catalina Island. The Cooper's nutmeg (Cancellaria cooperi) is a specialized parasite of this ray, and possibly other bottom-dwelling fishes such as the Pacific angelshark (Squatina californica). The snail is attracted to the chemicals contained in the ray's surface mucus; it makes a small cut on the ventral surface of the ray and uses its proboscis to suck blood. Other known parasites of this species include the copepod Trebius latifurcatus, the fluke Amphibdelloides maccallumi, and the tapeworm Acanthobothrium hispidum.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the onefin <b>{{electric}}</b> <b>ray</b> can defend itself with a strong electric shock produced {{from a pair of}} kidney-shaped electric organs beside its head. It feeds mainly on polychaete worms, and likely gives birth to live young. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) presently lacks enough information to assess the conservation status of this species. It is often caught incidentally by bottom trawl fisheries off South Africa, and may also be impacted by pollution from coastal development.|$|E
5|$|The Pacific <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> {{exhibits}} aplacental viviparity, {{with the}} developing embryos at first receiving nourishment from yolk, and later from histotroph ("uterine milk", enriched with proteins, fat, and mucus) {{produced by the}} mother and delivered through specialized outgrowths of the uterine lining. Mature females have two functional ovaries and uteruses. Reproduction occurs year-round, with males apparently capable of mating every year and females every other year. The gestation period is unknown. Reported litter sizes range from 17 to 20; at least the number of ova, and perhaps also the number of young, increases {{with the size of}} the female.|$|E
50|$|Virtually {{nothing is}} known of {{the natural history of}} the Florida torpedo. Like other members of its family, it is capable of {{producing}} an electric shock for defense. Reproduction is presumably aplacental viviparous as in other <b>electric</b> <b>rays.</b>|$|R

[...] 2 pagesThe {{conservation}} of elasmobranchs depends on accurate biological and ecological data to develop population assessments, ecological risk analyses and ecosystem models. Deficiencies on this information for rare elasmobranch species impair {{the assessment of}} their ecological role in marine ecosystem and of management activities necessary to conserve and recover their populations. In this study, we generated new data of the trophic habits of several elasmobranchs poorly studied in the Mediterranean Sea, a highly impacted marine ecosystem. In particular, we combined stable isotope (δ 13 C and δ 15 N values) estimates with stomach content analyses to determine the feeding ecology, trophic level and functional role of 11 demersal sharks, 12 skates and 3 <b>electric</b> <b>rays.</b> These species are either cataloged by the IUCN as critically endangered, endangered, vulnerable or near threatened, or are data deficient. Our results revealed differences in the feeding ecology of these species. The rays generally consume small crustaceans, while sharks and <b>electric</b> <b>rays</b> prefer mixed diets composed of cephalopods, crustaceans and fish. Demersal sharks and <b>electric</b> <b>rays</b> showed higher trophic positions than skates. When comparing with other organisms of the ecosystem, results indicated that sharks and <b>electric</b> <b>rays</b> occupy similar positions than other top predators, whereas skates are more similar to medium predators.
