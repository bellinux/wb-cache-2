In 1967 Evans {{became a member of}} the East Coast chapter of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). She stated that she became interested in the civil rights movement after getting attacked by police during a demonstration at the Pentagon. “When I first became a political activist, I was a pacifist. I had never experience real violence <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>life</b> and naively hoped that it changed.” Evans demonstrated her interest in anti-racism movements by supporting various groups championing Black, Native and Puerto Rican liberation causes.|$|E

500|$|Krabs values money {{more than}} his own {{well-being}} and assesses the other characters based on their financial value to him. The only exceptions are Pearl and his girlfriend Mrs. Puff. His love for Mrs. Puff {{is so strong that}} it temporarily transcends his greed and drives him to buy her expensive gifts. Krabs tolerates his two employees because they work for little pay and because of their positive impact on his finances, but he is quick to rebuke them if they engage in behavior that drives away customers. Krabs has a tentative father-son relationship with SpongeBob; Krabs often scolds him if he gets in trouble, but at times gives him fatherlike advice. Former showrunner Paul Tibbitt has stated that this Krabs-SpongeBob dynamic is his favorite part of the show, telling Digital Spy in 2011 that [...] "the aspect of SpongeBob I love the most is his undying loyalty to Mr. Krabs. No matter how Mr. Krabs treats him. I try to replicate that <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>life</b> in every way." ...|$|E

Having to create a pilot, she drew inspiration for the show's setting of [...] "Stars Hollow, Connecticut" [...] after making a trip to Washington Depot, Connecticut, where she stayed at the Mayflower Inn. She explained: [...] "If I can make people feel this much of what I felt walking around this fairy town, I {{thought that would be}} wonderful ...

40|$|In {{the last}} half-century, {{a number of}} artists have chosen to abandon notions of good taste, skill, and {{aesthetics}} {{in the field of}} drawing in order to investigate and critique our social and cultural landscape. Two very different approaches have been taken to accomplish this – the use of humor, borrowing from the format of comics; and confessional art, in which the artist ostensibly lays themselves bare in order to act as a mirror for the viewer. <b>In</b> <b>my</b> senior thesis project, I explored these two forms of drawing <b>in</b> relation to <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>life</b> and identified institutional (within the Claremont Colleges) and larger cultural threads within my work...|$|R

Through extensive research and analysis, I intended to find the ideal social media outlet where marketers can reach and influence targeted consumers.

30|$|Stokes’s {{two-dimensional}} view is also {{intended to}} disrupt {{the idea of a}} one-way street from basic to applied work. Science is a dialogue between the world and the laboratory. Work on semiconducting materials was basic research before the invention of the transistor, but it might be considered “applied” afterward (Brooks, 1979). Our research is part of a similar dialogue. What is the dose-response curve relating light exposure shifts in the circadian clock (Boivin, Duffy, Kronauer, & Czeisler, 1996)? That is a fundamental question about our sleep-wake cycle that might not have arisen if we had not invented jet lag. <b>In</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> research <b>life,</b> I would not have asked the basic question of how target prevalence influences visual search if I had not noticed that airport baggage screeners were searching for a target that was almost never there (Wolfe, Horowitz, & Kenner, 2005). This is what Stokes calls “use-inspired, basic research,” and use-inspired, basic research is CRPI’s bread and butter.|$|R

60|$|I cannot {{write the}} name of Maupassant without recalling what was either a spiritual {{interposition}} or an extraordinary coincidence <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>life.</b> I had been travelling in Switzerland and had visited, among other places, that Gemmi Pass, where a huge cliff separates a French from a German canton. On the summit of this cliff was a small inn, where we broke our journey. It was explained to us that, although the inn was inhabited all the year round, still for about three months in winter it was utterly isolated, because it could at any time only be approached by winding paths on the mountain side, and when these became obliterated by snow it was impossible either to come up or to descend. They could see {{the lights in the}} valley beneath them, but were as lonely as if they lived in the moon. So curious a situation naturally appealed to one's imagination, and I speedily began to build up a short story in my own mind, depending upon a group of strong antagonistic characters being penned up in this inn, loathing each other and yet utterly unable to get away from each other's society, every day bringing them nearer to tragedy. For a week or so, as I travelled, I was turning over the idea.|$|E
60|$|When all {{has been}} said of a man's gifts, the {{critical}} question still stands over, how he regards his responsibility for using them. Once {{in a conversation with}} Mr. Gladstone, some fifty years from the epoch of this present chapter, we fell upon the topic of ambition. 'Well,' he said, 'I do not think that I can tax myself <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>life</b> with ever having been much moved by ambition.' The remark so astonished me that, as he afterwards playfully reported to a friend, I almost jumped up from my chair. We soon shall reach a stage in his career when both remark and surprise may explain themselves. We shall see that if ambition means love of power or fame for the sake of glitter, decoration, external renown, or even dominion and authority on their own account--and all these are common passions enough in strong natures as well as weak--then his view of himself was just. I think he had none of it. Ambition in a better sense, the motion of a resolute and potent genius to use strength for the purposes of strength, to clear the path, dash obstacles aside, force good causes forward--such a quality as that is the very law of the being of a personality so vigorous, intrepid, confident, and capable as his.|$|E

"I do not {{see that}} I shall be more lonely than I {{have been for the}} last two years, Edgar, and, indeed, as you know, even when you were at home I lived very much my own life, and only saw you at meals and {{for an hour or so}} of an evening; therefore, your being {{established}} here will make but little difference in my life, and, indeed, whenever I feel lonely I can ride over here for a day or two. I thank you all the same, Edgar; but, at any rate, for the present I will continue to live at St. Alwyth. I have the good prior, who often comes in for a talk with me in the evening, and makes me heartily welcome should I, as I do sometimes, go to the monastery for an hour after sunset.

40|$|In late 1999, Michèle Dominy and Laurence Carucci {{announced}} a session on ‘critical ethnography’ at the forthcoming {{conference of the}} Association for Social Anthropology in Oceania {{to be held in}} Vancouver. The notice came at a critical moment <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> professional <b>life.</b> Rumours had begun to spread that the University of Waikato, where I teach anthropology, had allowed Hans Joachim Kupka, a German Holocaust denier, to enrol in a PhD supposedly intended to explore the role of the German language in New Zealand history, culture and society (Renwick 2002). Kupka’s repellent views on race and a parallel controversy over ‘holocaust discourse’ (Goldsmith 2002) coincided with a complaint of racism by a student against someone associated with my department. <b>My</b> current interest <b>in</b> critical ethnography and anthropology, then, has roots in a specific combination of circumstances <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> work and workplace. More broadly, it also stems from my sense that anthropology has come to require more than the usual degree of justification in the economically neo-liberal, culturally hypersensitive and politically fractious space of contemporary New Zealand. Though I focus on <b>my</b> <b>own</b> society, the pressures I have just listed are not unique to it. I have no doubt that some of my comments will resonate with the experiences of anthropologists teaching, researching and commenting publicly elsewhere, especially those working in other (post) colonial societies...|$|R
