5|$|The {{city was}} also the wartime home of Richard Jordan Gatling, a {{physician}} and <b>entrepreneur,</b> <b>who</b> invented the Gatling gun. Tested in Indianapolis and patented in November 1862, the hand-cranked, rapid-fire gun was a predecessor to the modern machine gun. The U.S. Navy adopted the Gatling gun during the war, where it was used on federal gunboats, but the U.S. Army did not formally adopt it for use until 1866.|$|E

5|$|According {{to flight}} attendants Amy Sweeney and Betty Ong, who {{contacted}} American Airlines during the hijacking, the hijackers had stabbed flight attendants Karen Martin and Barbara Arestegui and slashed {{the throat of}} passenger Daniel Lewin. Lewin, an American-Israeli Internet <b>entrepreneur</b> <b>who</b> understood Arabic, had served as {{an officer in the}} elite Sayeret Matkal special operations unit of the Israel Defense Forces. Lewin was seated in 9B, and Suqami was directly behind him in 10B. The 9/11 Commission suggested that Suqami may have stabbed and killed Lewin after he attempted to stop the hijacking. Lewin {{is believed to be the}} first fatality in the 9/11 attacks. During a four-minute call to the American Airlines operations center, Ong provided information about lack of communication with the cockpit, lack of access to the cockpit, and passenger injuries. She provided the seat locations of the hijackers, which later helped investigators to determine their identities.|$|E
5|$|At {{first the}} revolutionary {{movement}} was uncertain whether {{to destroy the}} prison, to reoccupy it as a fortress {{with members of the}} volunteer guard militia, or to preserve it intact as a permanent revolutionary monument. The revolutionary leader Mirabeau eventually settled the matter by symbolically starting the destruction of the battlements himself, after which a panel of five experts was appointed by the Permanent Committee of the Hôtel de Ville to manage the demolition of the castle. One of these experts was Pierre-François Palloy, a bourgeois <b>entrepreneur</b> <b>who</b> claimed vainqueur status for his role during the taking of the Bastille, and he rapidly assumed control over the entire process. Palloy's team worked quickly and by November most of the fortress had been destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Radama's successor, Queen Ranavalona I (1828–61), {{responded to}} {{increasing}} {{political and cultural}} encroachment {{on the part of}} Britain and France by issuing a royal edict prohibiting the practice of Christianity in Madagascar and pressuring most foreigners to leave the territory. Residents of Madagascar could accuse one another of various crimes, including theft, Christianity and especially witchcraft, for which the ordeal of tangena was routinely obligatory. Between 1828 and 1861, the tangena ordeal caused about 3,000 deaths annually. Among those who continued to reside in Imerina were Jean Laborde, an <b>entrepreneur</b> <b>who</b> developed munitions and other industries on behalf of the monarchy, and Joseph-François Lambert, a French adventurer and slave trader, with whom then-Prince Radama II signed a controversial trade agreement termed the Lambert Charter. Succeeding his mother, Radama II (1861–63) attempted to relax the queen's stringent policies, but was overthrown two years later by Prime Minister Rainivoninahitriniony (1852–1865) and an alliance of Andriana (noble) and Hova (commoner) courtiers, who sought to end the absolute power of the monarch.|$|E

50|$|<b>Entrepreneurs</b> <b>who</b> commit smaller errors by anticipating {{consumer}} demand more correctly attain greater financial success. The <b>entrepreneurs</b> <b>who</b> form {{the most accurate}} opinions regarding the future state of markets (i.e., new trends in {{consumer demand}}s) earn the highest profits and gain greater control of industry. Those <b>entrepreneurs</b> <b>who</b> anticipate future market trends therefore waste {{the least amount of}} real capital and find the most favorable terms for finance on markets for financial capital. Minimal waste of real capital goods implies the minimization of the opportunity costs of capital- economic calculation. The value of capital goods is brought into line with the value of future consumer goods through competition in financial markets, because competition for profits among capitalist financiers rewards <b>entrepreneurs</b> <b>who</b> value capital more correctly (i.e., anticipating future prices more correctly) and eliminates capitalists who value capital least correctly.|$|R
30|$|We conduct {{multiple}} supplement {{analyses to}} explore the robustness of the above results. First, our treated sample of leaving entrepreneurs contains both <b>entrepreneurs</b> <b>who</b> are Chinese mainland citizens with foreign residency rights and <b>entrepreneurs</b> <b>who</b> are foreign nationals or citizens from Chinese Hong Kong, Chinese Macau and Chinese Taiwan. The two groups of entrepreneurs may have some different motives and preferences in doing business in Chinese mainland, so we restrict our treated sample to those <b>entrepreneurs</b> <b>who</b> are only Chinese mainland citizens with foreign residency rights and replicate the above tests and find our main results are similar.|$|R

40|$|Online {{businesses}} were heralded as being ‘anytime, anyplace, anywhere’ businesses, allowing the <b>entrepreneurs</b> <b>who</b> run {{them to be}} free of locational constraints. In contrast, <b>entrepreneurs</b> <b>who</b> operate home-based businesses have made a conscious choice to operate their business from home. This study explores the role of space and place for <b>entrepreneurs</b> <b>who</b> have brought these two types of business together, that is, <b>entrepreneurs</b> <b>who</b> are operating online home-based businesses. Such businesses are important as the have been identified as offering a unique opportunity for experimentation and innovation are hence a source of business diversity. The also offer economic benefits both at the individual micro level and at the macro-economic level. The study, which is exploratory in nature, is undertaken by means of key informant interviews with 42 <b>entrepreneurs</b> <b>who</b> are operating online home based businesses. The study finds that whilst certain factors allow such businesses to be location independent, other factors constrain the location of the businesses, usually to the home. The study findings suggest that there is a more subtle third alternative we term ‘tethered’ businesses, that lies between these two extremes of location dependent or independent, which is more appropriate for many online home-based businesses...|$|R
