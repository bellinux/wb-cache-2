500|$|Flowers {{occur in}} typical Banksia [...] "flower spikes", inflorescences {{made up of}} {{hundreds}} of pairs of flowers densely packed in a spiral around a woody axis. B.browniis flower spike is a metallic red-brown colour, roughly cylindrical, 6 to 19 centimetres (2–7½in) high and eight to ten centimetres (3–4in) wide. Each flower consists of a tubular perianth made up of four united tepals, and one long wiry style. Perianths are cream at the base and grey-brown at the end. Styles are rusty red-brown with a cream tip, and <b>downwardly</b> hooked rather than straight. The style end is initially trapped inside the upper perianth parts, but breaks free at anthesis.|$|E
500|$|In August 2011, it was {{reported}} that Barr was working on a new sitcom with 20th Century Fox Television tentatively titled <b>Downwardly</b> Mobile. Steven Greener, who also executive produced her reality show Roseanne's Nuts, will also executive produce the sitcom. [...] Eric Gilliland is attached as co-creator, writer and executive producer; Gilliland was also a writer on Barr's previous sitcom Roseanne. The show will be set in a mobile home community and use a multiple-camera setup. In October 2011, NBC picked up the show. A pilot was filmed but initially ended up being shelved by the network. Barr blames her [...] "Progressive politics" [...] as being the sole reason behind the pilot's rejection. Barr states that she was notified that the show would not be picked up due to its being labeled [...] "too polarizing" [...] by network executives. In an interview with Politicker, Barr revealed that the show had been axed only to announce three hours later that she had just received a phone call saying that NBC had not given up on the project completely. The show could end up as an NBC midseason replacement. Barr hopes she's given the opportunity to retool the show.|$|E
2500|$|The {{major key}} to {{effective}} decentralization is increased broad-based participation in local-public decision making. In 2000, the World Bank report reveals that local government knows {{the needs and}} desires of their constituents better than the national government, {{while at the same}} time, it is easier to hold local leaders accountable. From the study of West African tropical forest, it is argued that the <b>downwardly</b> accountable and/or representative authorities with meaningful discretional powers are the basic institutional element of decentralization that should lead to efficiency, development and equity. This collaborates with the World Bank report in 2000 which says that decentralization should improve resource allocation, efficiency, accountability and equity [...] "by linking the cost and benefit of local services more closely".|$|E

60|$|Of course I {{ought to}} have {{expected}} that, only I didn't. It came to me as an absolute, for a moment an overwhelming shock. It seemed as though it wasn't a face, as though it must needs be a mask, a horror, a deformity, that would presently be disavowed or explained. There was no nose, and the thing had dull bulging eyes at the side--in the silhouette I had supposed they were ears. There were no ears.... I have tried to draw one of these heads, but I cannot. There was a mouth, <b>downwardly</b> curved, like a human mouth in a face that stares ferociously....|$|E
60|$|Estimating {{the size}} of the {{creature}} by comparison with the diameter of the large trees near which it passed--the few giants of the forest which had escaped the fury of the land-slide--I concluded it to be far larger than any ship of the line in existence. I say ship of the line, because the shape of the monster suggested the idea--the hull of one of our seventy-four might convey a very tolerable conception of the general outline. The mouth of the animal was situated at the extremity of a proboscis some sixty or seventy feet in length, and about as thick as the body of an ordinary elephant. Near the root of this trunk was an immense quantity of black shaggy hair--more than could have been supplied by the coats of a score of buffaloes; and projecting from this hair <b>downwardly</b> and laterally, sprang two gleaming tusks not unlike those of the wild boar, but of infinitely greater dimensions. Extending forward, parallel with the proboscis, and on each side of it, was a gigantic staff, thirty or forty feet in length, formed seemingly of pure crystal and in shape a perfect prism,--it reflected in the most gorgeous manner the rays of the declining sun. The trunk was fashioned like a wedge with the apex to the earth. From it there were outspread two pairs of wings--each wing nearly one hundred yards in length--one pair being placed above the other, and all thickly covered with metal scales; each scale apparently some ten or twelve feet in diameter. I observed that the upper and lower tiers of wings were connected by a strong chain. But the chief peculiarity of this horrible thing was the representation of a Death's Head, which covered nearly the whole surface of its breast, and which was as accurately traced in glaring white, upon the dark ground of the body, {{as if it had been}} there carefully designed by an artist. While I regarded the terrific animal, and more especially the appearance on its breast, with a feeling or horror and awe--with a sentiment of forthcoming evil, which I found it impossible to quell by any effort of the reason, I perceived the huge jaws at the extremity of the proboscis suddenly expand themselves, and from them there proceeded a sound so loud and so expressive of wo, that it struck upon my nerves like a knell and as the monster disappeared at the foot of the hill, I fell at once, fainting, to the floor.|$|E

50|$|Exclusion Argument: He {{challenged}} the Exclusion Argument (EA) of Jaegwon Kim, {{according to which}} causal efficacy resides solely in the physical domain of the rootmost level of energy, by arguing that the EA does not hold if indeterminism is the case. This, he argues, provides an opening for information to be <b>downwardly</b> causal in the universe, whether high-level supervenient events such as conscious percepts or a concept, {{such as that of}} a ‘home-run’ in a baseball game, or ‘voting’ in a democracy. Information is <b>downwardly</b> causal, not as a force, he argues, but by filtering out possible paths that are open at the particle level which are not consistent with informational criteria. Under ‘criterial causation’ (see below) only physically causal paths which are also informational causal paths are permitted to occur in the nervous system and other information processing systems, such as underlie genetic inheritance, protein formation, membrane channel formation, or social interactions such as speaking or institutional interactions. Possible physical particle-level paths which do not meet high-level informational criteria are effectively filtered out by a criterial assessment. Thus information is causal, not as a force, or via attributes such as impact or force, but is causal as a filter on what possibilities can become real.|$|E
