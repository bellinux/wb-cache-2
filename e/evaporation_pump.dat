Oxybutynin release from a series of ethanol/acetone/methylal based formulations was assessed in vitro and the developed formulation was used for delivery from a metered dose spray. Various qualitative and quantitative parameters like spray pattern, particle size distribution, pH, <b>evaporation</b> time, <b>pump</b> seal efficiency test, average weight per metered dose, content per spray and content uniformity were evaluated.

Diffusion studies of the optimized formulations through the semipermeable membrane showed the release of drug to the extent of almost 50 % over a period of 24 h.

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{originated from}} work by Dr. A. H. McIlraith of the National Physical Laboratory who, in 1966, described {{a new type}} of charged particle oscillator. This makes use of two equal cylindrical electrodes to constrain the particles {{in such a way that}} they follow extremely long oscillatory paths between the electrodes under the influence of an electrostatic field alone. The object of this work has been to study the principle of the oscillator in detail and to investigate its properties and applications. Any device which is capable of creating long electron trajectories has potential application in the field of ultra high vacuum technology. It was therefore considered that a critical review of the problems associated with the production and measurement of ultra high vacuum was relevant in the initial stages of the work. The oscillator has been applied with a considerable degree of success as a high energy electrostatic ion source. This offers several advantages over existing ion sources. It can be operated at much lower pressures without the need of a magnetic field. The oscillator principle has also been applied as a thermionic ionization gauge and has been compared with other ionization gauges to pressures as low as 5 x 10 - 11 torr [...] This new gauge exhibited a number of advantages over most of the existing gauges. Finally the oscillator has been used in an <b>evaporation</b> ion <b>pump</b> and has exhibited fairly high pumping speeds for argon gas relative to those for nitrogen. This investigation supports the original work of Dr. A. H. McIlraith and shows that his proposed oscillator has considerable potential in the fields of vacuum technology and electron physics...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} a microfluidic device ultimately {{to be applied}} as a wearable sweat sensor. We show proof-of-principle of the microfluidic functions of the device, namely fluid collection and continuous fluid flow pumping. A filter-paper based layer, that eventually will form the interface between the device and the skin, is used to collect the fluid (e. g., sweat) and enter this into the microfluidic device. A controllable <b>evaporation</b> driven <b>pump</b> is used to drive a continuous fluid flow through a microfluidic channel and over a sensing area. The key element of the pump is a micro-porous membrane mounted at the channel outlet, such that a pore array with a regular hexagonal arrangement is realized through which the fluid evaporates, which drives the flow within the channel. The system is completely fabricated on flexible polyethylene terephthalate (PET) foils, which can be the backbone material for flexible electronics applications, such that it is compatible with volume production approaches like Roll-to-Roll technology. The evaporation rate can be controlled by varying the outlet geometry and the temperature. The generated flows are analyzed experimentally using Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV). Typical results show that with 1 to 61 pores (diameter = 250 μm, pitch = 500 μm) flow rates of 7. 3 × 10 - 3 to 1. 2 × 10 - 1 μL/min are achieved. When the surface temperature is increased by 9. 4 °C, the flow rate is increased by 130 %. The results are theoretically analyzed using an evaporation model that includes an evaporation correction factor. The theoretical and experimental results are in good agreement. cop. 2015, The Author(s) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Aiming at {{increasing}} the energy-saving efficiency of salt solution evaporation, {{the effect of}} several factors on heat pump energy-saving efficiency is studied through theoretical analyses and calculation. The factors include boiling point elevation caused by solution static pressure, superheat loss of surface evaporation, temperature difference loss caused by fouling. The conclusions are that falling-film evaporator helps improve heat <b>pump</b> <b>evaporation</b> energy-saving the most and forms the fluctuating flow of the falling film {{which can be used}} to remove fouling automatically. The Φ 38 mm× 2 mm single-tube dynamics experiment results show that the flow can produce stable 3 D vibration of the cleaning spiral when the nominal flow velocity is more than 0. 25 m/s. The axial reciprocating motion distance is longer than one spiral pitch and reciprocating periodicity is 3 - 6 seconds. The sodium carbonate solution fouling removal experiment results show that the salt fouling decreases the overall heat transfer coefficient by 30 % in one hour when there is no the 3 D vibrating spiral-insert; and the insert can enhance heat transfer by 59 % comparing to that during stable operation without this technology...|$|R
40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that human activities {{have a large}} influence on global climate. In order to minimize human impact on global warming, regulations and agreements may be introduced for all CO 2 generating sectors. Therefore, measures to reduce CO 2 -emissions will be of importance to the industrial sector. Strategic decisions and long-term thinking are needed {{to comply with the}} regulations and to fulfil the agreements. The pulp and paper industry is an energy intensive sector with relatively large potentials to accomplish energy efficiency measures that result in reduction of CO 2 -emissions. To settle the cost-effectiveness for each measure a number of system parameters have to be considered, such as investment costs, boundary conditions and reference systems. This paper presents two methods, pinch technology and the MIND method. These methods are used for analysis of industrial energy systems considering different parameters and aspects. Pinch technology is used for thermodynamic and economic evaluation of process integration possibilities and the MIND method is used for strategic evaluation of different energy efficiency measures. Foundation for long-term decision-making can be obtained by co-ordinating the results from the two methods. In this paper, cost-effectiveness has been determined for different energy efficiency measures. The measures are non-conventional <b>evaporation</b> and heat <b>pumping.</b> The case studied is from a Swedish board mill.

The following study investigated the <b>evaporation</b> rates of <b>pump</b> oil and several alkanes, which have a wide range of applications, using a thermogravimetric machine. Both static and dynamic temperature tests were conducted. The rate of evaporation of the test specimen was determined as the percentage of mass loss per unit time. Using the Arrhenius Equation, the activation energy of the evaporation process, Ea, can be calculated as the slope of the best fit line for a plot of the ln(k) vs. 1 /T (where k represents the rate of the evaporation). These values were shown to have good agreement with the enthalpy of vaporization calculated from the Clausius Clapeyron Equation and with the activation energy calculated using the Freeman and Carroll Method. The alkanes were compared using the rate of evaporation and the amount of activation energy required for evaporation as model systems. Further investigations were conducted to determine the relationship of surface area of the evaporating liquid and the rate of evaporation. It is suggested that the surface area is a function that depends on the activation, bonding, and interfacial energies of the liquid. However, the wetting angle, which aids in the description of the surface area, depends on the surface energy. Subsequent modeling was conducted in an attempt to predict the evaporation characteristics of other lubricants for the purpose of comparison...|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} years much {{interest}} {{has been paid to}} Low Temperature Systems, i. e. systems which use water to transfer the energy and have temperatures of this heating-cooling medium close to room temperature (20 °C for cooling, 26 °C for heating). Such systems show an overall energy consumption lower than for conventional air-conditioning systems and offer the possibility of using renewable or recovery sources of energy, or technologies not usable in traditional systems, such as condensation boilers, reversible heat <b>pumps,</b> <b>evaporation</b> exchangers, ground heat exchangers or water beds. With these equipments higher COP than in traditional systems can be obtained. To allow a correct design of a radiant system and the correct coupling with energy sources it is necessary to have a tool and a guideline available to evaluate, in his complexity, the physical system building-plant-environment.

30|$|The {{ability to}} {{controllably}} infuse or withdraw {{different types of}} reagents with nanometer precision unlocks the door for new processes {{that can lead to}} novel opportunities like cell surgery. Lately, more applications, particularly in chemistry and biology are continuously demanding the development of certain tools that would allow the precise dispensing and aspiration of extremely small amounts of liquids at predefined positions. In on-going efforts to achieve this, different types of fluid dispensing devices, such as micropipettes and ink-jet printers, have been explored. Nevertheless, these devices do not offer the degree of precision and control that is required to explore the intended applications. Furthermore, they are limited to handle volumes in the order of micro-to-picoliter [1, 2], which constitutes at least three orders of magnitude bigger than the suggested (sub)femtoliter regime for most of the upcoming applications. In attempts to manipulate liquid in the smallest possible regime, scientists have started to develop cantilever-based techniques (i.e. DPN [3], NADIS [4], NanoFountain Probe [5] and FluidFM [6]) which have been proved to surpass the picoliter barrier and handle volumes as small as few zeptoliters [7]. These devices, compatible with Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), combine the versatility of microfluidics with the high precision provided by the cantilever [6]. The challenge, nevertheless, remains on achieving controlled dispensing of the desired volume despite the complications given by external factors such as evaporation [8], humidity [9], hydrophobicity of the tip [10], surface energy of the substrate [10] and viscosity of the liquid [9]. Additionally, the incapability to aspirate controlled amounts of liquid has slowed down the potential break-through applications. In order to overcome these challenges and get closer towards the envisioned goals, we have developed a microcantilever AFM-based platform to enable the dispensing and aspiration of liquids with volumes in the femtoliter range under controlled environment. The various parts in this system constitute a basic AFM measurement system, a microfluidic chip, an automated substrate alignment, a humidity chamber and a microfluidic interface connected to an external pressure control system. The microfluidic chip consisted of a hollow silicon nitride (Si 3 N 4) tip and channelled silicon dioxide (SiO 2) cantilever which were connected to a fluidic reservoir located in the handling part of the chip. After filling the reservoir with liquid, a positive or negative pressure relative to the ambient is applied in the reservoir to infuse or withdraw liquids through an aperture located at the apex of the tip. Constant volume systems such as a syringe pump used for applying pressure differences suffer from the effect of shock waves produced by the stepper motors and have a slow response at low flow rates. Moreover, it can take up to few minutes for the pressure to stabilize. Therefore, we have chosen the constant pressure system which is pulse free, has a fast response and can also produce high flow rates. The results shown here represent an improvement over our earlier work on thermal <b>pumping</b> [8], <b>evaporation</b> based <b>pumping</b> and aspiration [11] and syringe-pump based pipetting [12].|$|R

The novelty of the ISI is a droplet evaporation unit, which separates liquid droplets and ice crystals in the airborne state, thus avoiding physical impaction of the hydrometeors and limiting potential artefacts. The design and validation of the droplet evaporation unit is based on modelling studies of droplet evaporation rates and computational fluid dynamics simulations of gas and particle flows through the unit. Prior to deployment in the field, an inter-comparison of the optical particle size spectrometers and a characterization of the transmission efficiency of the PCVI was conducted in the laboratory. The ISI was subsequently deployed during the Cloud and Aerosol Characterization Experiment (CLACE) 2013 and 2014 – two extensive international field campaigns encompassing comprehensive measurements of cloud microphysics, as well as bulk aerosol, ice residual and ice nuclei properties. The campaigns provided an important opportunity for a proof of concept of the inlet design. In this work we present the setup of the ISI, including the modelling and laboratory characterization of its components, as well as field measurements demonstrating the ISI performance and validating the working principle of the inlet.

40|$|Heat pipes, vapor {{chambers}} and thermosyphons {{are examples of}} two-phase devices used in electronics cooling which rely on latent heat exchange. In these devices, a wick structure forms the main unit that provides for <b>evaporation</b> and capillary <b>pumping.</b> An evaporating meniscus is fundamentally responsible for heat transport in these devices. Thin-film evaporation is the evaporation taking place in a few hundred nm region near the solid-liquid-vapor junction of meniscus and delivers heat transfer coefficients of up to 106 W/m 2 K. This intensive evaporation near the triple line creates a temperature gradient along the meniscus resulting in a surface tension gradient that gives rise to thermocapillary convection. Both the thin-film evaporation and the thermocapillary convection induced {{have been reported in}} the literature to play a major role in the total heat transferred. These transport mechanisms are functions of capillary structure, pore size, liquid properties and applied heat flux. But the exact nature of the relationship is not known and requires detailed experimental and theoretical investigation to establish a functional relationship. To understand this relationship, evaporation heat transfer in three different geometries - microcapillaries, microchannels and droplets - is experimentally investigated. ^ Micro-particle image velocimetry measurements of the three-dimensional convection patterns generated near an evaporating meniscus in unheated, horizontally oriented capillary tubes are presented. The relative influence of buoyancy and thermocapillarity on the flow is studied. The local mass transport in a 100 - 400 μm region near the contact line of a water droplet of radius 1810 μm on an unheated glass substrate is experimentally quantified to show the efficiency of contact line heat transfer. ^ Microscale infrared thermography is used to demonstrate the cooling effect due to thin-film evaporation in a meniscus in a channel. A detailed numerical model is developed that describes heat and mass transfer from a meniscus into an air-ambient. Evaporation at the interface is modeled using kinetic theory, while vapor transport in air is computed by solving the complete species transport equation. The numerical results obtained show satisfactory agreement with experimental data. It is shown that the limiting resistance in the domain is the evaporative resistance at the interface and that the thickness of the film does not play a significant role in determining the heat and mass transfer. The present generalized model may easily be extended to other geometries and hence may be used in the design of two-phase cooling devices. ^ Contrary to the general understanding that thin-film evaporation and thermocapillary convection are the dominant modes of heat transfer in water-based systems, this work shows that it is not true. ...|$|R
