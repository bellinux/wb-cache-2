"I am {{extremely}} sensible of {{the firm}} love and regard you had for [...] my father, and have for his memory; and upon that account it is [...] that I now renew my request, that you would at least <b>defer</b> this [...] <b>printing</b> until you have had the advice of friends.

40|$|Print bilingualised learners’ dictionaries, which {{typically}} include an L 2 definition immediately {{followed by an}} L 1 translation, represented a step forward {{in the field of}} pedagogical lexicography insofar as they provided users with access to both monolingual and bilingual information. However, the very structure of print bilingualised dictionaries minimises the monolingual part: most users read only the L 1 text, thus missing exposure to L 2. This paper presents a new kind of bilingualised dictionary, the ‘print deferred bilingualised dictionary’, in which users do not encounter translations immediately, as is the norm in other print (immediate) bilingualised dictionaries. Rather, in this new type of dictionary translations are deferred. This avoids the users’ skipping of monolingual L 2 definitions and reading only the bilingual (side-by-side) translation. Apart from that (and unlike print immediate bilingualised dictionaries, which are not circular), when giving bilingual L 1 !L 2 translations the <b>print</b> <b>deferred</b> bilingualised dictionary directs the reader towards the monolingual part, thus promoting L 2 exposure...|$|R
60|$|I liked your Play marvellously, {{having no}} {{objection}} to it but one, which strikes me as applicable to {{a large majority of}} plays, those of Shakspeare himself not entirely excepted--I mean a little degradation of character for a more dramatic turn of plot. Your present of Hone's book was very acceptable; and so much so, that your part of the book is the cause why I did not write long ago. I wished to enter a little minutely into notice of the dramatic extracts, and, on account of the smallness of the <b>print,</b> <b>deferred</b> doing so till longer days would allow me to read without candle-light, which I have long since given up. But, alas! when the days lengthened, my eyesight departed, and for many months I could not read three minutes at a time. You will be sorry to hear that this infirmity still hangs about me, and almost cuts me off from reading altogether. But how are you, and how is your dear sister? I long much, as we all do, to know.|$|R
