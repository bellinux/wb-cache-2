5|$|For {{much of the}} 1940s, one of {{the most}} {{prolific}} and successful authors of this often downbeat brand of suspense tale was Cornell Woolrich (sometimes under the pseudonym George Hopley or William Irish). No writer's published work provided the basis for more films noir of the classic period than Woolrich's: thirteen in all, including Black Angel (1946), Deadline at Dawn (1946), and <b>Fear</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Night (1947).|$|E
5|$|Scholar M. Daphne Kutzer {{points out}} that Mr. McGregor's role is larger in The Flopsy Bunnies than in the two {{previous}} rabbit books, but he inspires less <b>fear</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Flopsy Bunnies than in Peter Rabbit because his role as fearsome antagonist is diminished when he becomes a comic foil in the book's final scenes. Nonetheless, for young readers, {{he is still a}} frightening figure because he has captured not only vulnerable sleeping bunnies but bunnies whose parents have failed to adequately protect them.|$|E
5|$|Augustine flees {{back to the}} D.U.P. headquarters. Delsin tracks Hank down to the docks, {{where he}} is fleeing from D.U.P. forces. Hank begs for forgiveness, saying that he only worked with Augustine because she {{threatened}} to hurt his daughter. Delsin can choose to either kill Hank, or let him escape Seattle with his daughter. Aided by Fetch and Eugene, Delsin rallies {{an assault on the}} D.U.P. headquarters. After breaking through the building's defenses, Delsin confronts Augustine and reveals to her that he has figured out she staged the Conduit escape at Akomish to instill <b>fear</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> population and give the D.U.P. a reason to continue their regime. Augustine lets Delsin absorb her powers, and tells him that she wants to save the Conduits by imprisoning and protecting them from the population. Delsin battles and eventually defeats Augustine with his new concrete powers.|$|E

5|$|Human {{rights groups}} such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, {{as well as the}} United States Department of State and the European Union, have {{expressed}} concern about the state of human rights in Sri Lanka, and both the government of Sri Lanka and the rebel LTTE have been accused of human rights violations. Although Amnesty International in 2003 found considerable improvement in the human rights situation, attributed to a ceasefire and peace talks {{between the government and the}} LTTE, by 2007 they reported an escalation in political killings, child recruitment, abductions, and armed clashes, which created a climate of <b>fear</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> north and east of the country.|$|E
5|$|The Sinsinawa Mound raid {{occurred}} on June 29, 1832, near the Sinsinawa mining settlement in Michigan Territory (present-day Grant County, Wisconsin in the United States). This incident, {{part of the}} Black Hawk War, resulted {{in the deaths of}} two men; a third man survived by seeking cover in a nearby blockhouse. In the aftermath of the raid, Captain James W. Stephenson set out to pursue the attackersa straggling band of Sauk Native Americansbut lost their trail at the Mississippi River. The attack occurred in the same week as other skirmishes and raids, and as a result helped contribute to the growing <b>fear</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region. The raid caused the residents of nearby Platteville to consider fleeing their settlement.|$|E
5|$|Residents on the Gulf Coast and at San Antonio de Béxar began {{evacuating}} in January {{upon learning}} of the Mexican army's troop movements into their area, an event that was ultimately replayed across Texas. During early skirmishes, some Texian soldiers surrendered, believing that they would become prisoners of war — but Santa Anna demanded their executions. The news of the Battle of the Alamo and the Goliad massacre instilled <b>fear</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> population and resulted in the mass exodus of the civilian population of Gonzales, where the opening battle of the Texian revolution had begun and where, only days before {{the fall of the}} Alamo, they had sent a militia to reinforce the defenders at the mission. The civilian refugees were accompanied by the newly forming provisional army, as Houston bought time to train soldiers and create a military structure that could oppose Santa Anna's greater forces. Houston's actions were viewed as cowardice by the ad interim government, as well as by some of his own troops. As he and the refugees from Gonzales escaped first to the Colorado River and then to the Brazos, evacuees from other areas trickled in and new militia groups arrived to join with Houston's force.|$|E

50|$|Between {{them are}} sculpted warriors keeping watch. An {{inscription}} from identifies them: Behold threescore valiant ones {{of the most}} valiant of Israel surrounded the bed of Solomon. All holding swords, and most expert in war: every man's sword upon his thigh, because of <b>fears</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> night (Song of Songs 3.7). This is an allegory for Nocturnal Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament. Around the monstrance holding the Divine Solomon (Christ), the chosen men of Israel (Christians), armed with prayer and mortification, stand guard against <b>the</b> <b>fears</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> night (the traps that the Prince of Darkness has prepared <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shadows against the Church Militant).|$|R

25|$|As {{a result}} of the failed {{negotiations}} North Korea engaged in several acts of terrorism. In 1987, in an attempt to destabilize the Olympic Games and instill <b>fear</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> international community, a South Korean commercial flight, Korean Air Flight 858 was bombed killing 115 passengers on board. This event did not fulfill its intended purpose and instead further weakened North Korea's international reputation.|$|E

25|$|There was {{widespread}} <b>fear</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{aftermath of the}} rebellion, and white militias organized in retaliation against the slaves. The state executed 56 slaves accused {{of being part of}} the rebellion. In the frenzy, many non-participant slaves were punished. Approximately 120 slaves and free African Americans were murdered by militias and mobs in the area. Across the South, state legislatures passed new laws prohibiting education of slaves and free black people, restricting rights of assembly and other civil rights for free black people, and requiring white ministers to be present at all worship services.|$|E
25|$|One {{political}} theorist, James Blight, has {{analyzed the}} behavior of EXCOMM's members {{in the midst of}} the impending crisis with the Soviet Union. He suggests that the thought of war with the Soviet Union instilled a sense of <b>fear</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> committee members so that their deliberations became more productive as they reacted to this emotion. Blight argues that EXCOMM's focus of attention shifted: as the possibility of war with the Soviet Union became more probable, the committee members became less concerned with removing the missiles from Cuba and instead focused their energy on avoiding a nuclear war.|$|E
25|$|Slave rebellions, by Gabriel Prosser (1800), Denmark Vesey (1822), Nat Turner (1831), {{and most}} famously by John Brown (1859), caused <b>fear</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> white South, which imposed stricter {{oversight}} of slaves {{and reduced the}} rights of free blacks. The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 required the states to cooperate with slave owners when attempting to recover escaped slaves, which outraged Northerners. Formerly, an escaped slave that reached a non-slave state was presumed to have attained sanctuary and freedom under the Missouri Compromise. The Supreme Court's 1857 decision in Dred Scott v. Sandford ruled that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional; angry Republicans said this decision threatened to make slavery a national institution.|$|E

25|$|Sometime in May 1832 a Methodist {{minister}} {{and his wife}} disappeared and were subsequently tied to a tree and executed by burning by a band of Potawatomi. Also in May an attack at Holderman's Grove killed another minister, Adam Payne, and an attack at Hollenbeck's Grove drove numerous residents out of the area. In another attack, just before the Battle of Horseshoe Bend, a German immigrant named Henry Apple {{was killed in a}} Kickapoo ambush. At Ament's Cabin, near present-day Bureau County, Illinois, an attack left early settler Elijah Phillips dead. Together with other incidents during the war, these attacks helped contribute to an atmosphere of <b>fear</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region during the war.|$|E
25|$|The {{people are}} {{gathered}} at the square to watch the executions. The crowd is restless. Koroghlu's struggle for freedom has infused people with courage. People are protesting and loudly curse the khan. They receive the convicted persons with empathy; beautiful Nigar stands motionless on the scaffold {{with the support of}} her friends. She is the first to be executed. Hassan khan appears and orders the execution to begin. There is no <b>fear</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> courageous heart of Nigar. She angrily blames the khan. At that moment when the executioner' readies his axe Koroghlu's soldiers burst into the square and set the convicted free. It is the men who ordered the executions who receive the punishment. The people greet Koroghlu with delight..|$|E
25|$|Dr Harold Legg {{was one of}} the {{original}} twenty-three characters invented by the creators of EastEnders, Tony Holland and Julia Smith. Dr Legg was an attempt to represent the successive wave of Jewish immigrants that had settled in the East End of London between 1881 and 1914 in order avoid the persecution that they were being subjected to in Europe. The second generation of East End born Jews (as Dr Legg was meant to represent) prospered in the area until the 1930s when Oswald Mosley's British Union of Fascists was formed, and used violence to instil <b>fear</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Jewish population. As the Jewish community grew wealthier, many moved out of the East End to more affluent areas of London, just as the character of Dr Legg had done on-screen when the show began; living in Islington, but commuting to his practice in Walford.|$|E

25|$|The werewolves {{were known}} to exterminate all kind of farm animals, {{especially}} sheep. The transformation usually occurred <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Winter solstice, Easter and full moon. Later <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 17th and 18th century, <b>the</b> trials <b>in</b> Hungary not only were conducted against witches, but against werewolves too, and many records exist creating connections between both kinds. Also the vampires and werewolves are closely related in Hungary, being both <b>feared</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> antiquity.|$|R
25|$|The {{war against}} Denmark (Kalmar War) was {{concluded}} in 1613 with a peace {{that did not}} cost Sweden any territory, but it was forced to pay a heavy indemnity to Denmark (Treaty of Knäred). During this war, Gustavus Adolphus let his soldiers plunder towns and villages, and as he met little resistance from Danish forces in Scania, they pillaged and devastated twenty-four Scanian parishes. His memory in Scania has been negative because of that <b>fear.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> winter of 1612, {{during a period of}} two weeks, did he burn down, or otherwise destroyed 24 Scanian parishes and most of their population without meeting any enemy troops. The largest destroyed settlement was the Town Væ, which two years later was replaced by Danish King Christian IV as the nearby Christiansted (after the Swedification process, spelled Kristianstad), the last Scanian town to be founded by a Danish king.|$|E
25|$|The churchyard {{contains}} around 2,000 {{graves of}} patients who died at Kirkburton in Storthes Hall psychiatric hospital (1904–1991). Most of these graves are unmarked, in a separate field behind the church which was added by Rev. Arnold Escombe Jerram before he left in 1910. By 1913 there was <b>fear</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> village that the pauper burials were causing epidemics, because the sexton was saving money by leaving graves open to rain and weather, and not filling them with earth until they each contained their full complement of four coffins. The authorities claimed that Storthes Hall's use of the graveyard benefited Thurstonland by the payment of rates and that only fifty paupers per year, who were unclaimed by relatives, were buried there. Rev. P.S. Brown, at that time vicar of Thurstonland and chaplain to Storthes Hall, claimed that the burials were no danger to health, even though the sexton had to ladle out water from open graves before subsequent funerals.|$|E
25|$|On 13 March 1861, the Russian {{corvette}} Posadnik (Посадник, 1856), captained by Nicolai Birilev, {{arrived in}} Tsushima {{island in the}} inlet of Ozaki, the captain demanding landing rights. This event triggered <b>fear</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Japanese Shogunate, as the Russians had already attempted to breach Japan's isolation policy in the northern island of Hokkaido with the events involving Adam Laxman in 1792, the burning of villages there in 1806, and the events leading {{to the arrest of}} Vasilii Golovnin in 1811. At that time, only a few Japanese ports were open to foreign ships (Hakodate, Nagasaki, Yokohama), and Tsushima was clearly not one of them, thus suggesting unfriendly intentions {{on the part of the}} Russians. If taken over by the Russians, Tsushima could have become an effective base for further aggression. Japan received British help to support its policy. As tension rose, a second Russian ship arrived, and requests were made by the Russians to build a landing base and to receive supplies.|$|E
50|$|Due to <b>fears</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wider Arab world {{regarding}} {{the influence of}} <b>the</b> Muslim Brotherhood <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mid-twentieth century, Ghumari was accused of having ties to a foreign group.
