40|$|Entrepreneurship {{policy is}} an {{emerging}} area among economic policy developments {{that is currently}} not well developed. Policy makers are seeking to increase countries’ and regions’ <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>vitality</b> {{in recognition of the}} growing evidence that a high level of entrepreneurial activity contributes to economic growth and development. I report the results of a cross-sectional empirical analysis that was conducted to test the contribution of different types of entrepreneurship development programs to new business performance and growth. A sample of seventy-two Spanish footwear entrepreneurs were contacted and surveyed during 2000. Major findings suggest that some of the analyzed public policies significantly favor new business profitability and growth. These results should be taken with care because of the sample size, the profile of the economic sector analyzed, and the restricted geographical location of the new businesses considered in this research. ...|$|E
3000|$|In {{developing}} nations also, entrepreneurship {{policies have been}} implemented to promote entrepreneurial activities. In Taiwan, for instance, policy measures such as the establishment of industrial parks, Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI), and local industrial clustering, have enhanced <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>vitality</b> (Lin, Chang, & Shen, 2010). The Small Business Act of the Republic of South Africa (RSA, 1996) was promulgated to promote entrepreneurial activities in South Africa (Ladzani & Van Vuuren, 2002; Nieman, 2001). In Nigeria, structures and programmes such as the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency (SMEDAN), N-Power programme, Government Enterprise and Empowerment Programme (GEEP) and the You-win programme were designed to promote entrepreneurial activities by facilitating access to funds and other resources needed for SMEs (Oliyide, 2012; Today.ng, 2018). All these policies and much more are targeted towards promoting entrepreneurship. But the question {{that comes to mind}} is “Do all these government policies and programs have equal effects on all entrepreneurship phases?” [...]...|$|E
40|$|What are the {{entrepreneurial}} {{places in the}} USA? Although seminal theorizing on the determinants of entrepreneurship gives culture a unique and important role, systematic empirical evidence linking the distinct cultural identity of regions to their local <b>entrepreneurial</b> spirit and <b>vitality</b> is still scarce. This study offers a first, systematic overview on the nexus between regional cultural identity and latent and manifest entrepreneurship across the USA. To directly assess regional cultural identity, we apply the American Nations and Patchwork Community Types approaches and explore in which way these distinct spatially based cultural regions are reflected by significant differences in entrepreneurial activity and underlying biologically based propensities. We combine annual entrepreneurship rates at the county level with personality data collected in a large-scale, Internet-based study of 3, 457, 270 US residents. The findings suggest that entrepreneurship culture reflects the dynamic interplay between the region’s cultural identity and its latent and manifest entrepreneurship...|$|R
40|$|Do macropsychological factors predict “hard” {{economic}} outcomes like {{regional economic}} resilience? Prior approaches to understanding economic resilience {{have focused on}} regional economic infrastructure. In contrast, we draw on research highlighting the key role played by psychological factors in economic behaviors. Using large psychological data sets from the United States (n = 935, 858) and Great Britain (n = 417, 217), we characterize region-level psychological correlates of economic resilience. Specifically, we examine links between regions’ levels of psychological traits and their degree of economic slowdown (indexed by changes in <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>vitality)</b> {{in the wake of}} the Great Recession of 2008 – 2009. In both countries, more emotionally stable regions and regions with a more prevalent entrepreneurial personality makeup showed a significantly lower economic slowdown. This effect was robust when accounting for regional differences in economic infrastructure. Cause cannot be inferred from these correlational findings, but the results nonetheless point to macropsychological factors as potentially protective factors against macroeconomic shocks...|$|E
40|$|Facilitating {{entrepreneurial}} networks {{is a key}} {{to promoting}} <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>vitality</b> in a region. The focus of this research was to investigate methods to enhance member involvement in entrepreneur network organizations (ENOs), building from concepts in relationship marketing. Six organizations participated in the study, producing 205 usable surveys. The overall concept of organizational marketing strategies being mediated by the attitudinal variables of commitment and trust, which in turn may be related to behavior, was supported. Enhancement of member interdependence and core service performance emerged as important independent latent constructs, or marketing strategies, that might be employed. Service performance was directly related to participation as well as mediated by instrumental commitment and trust. Measures of affective commitment were not important. Normative commitment was positively related to instrumental commitment, retention and participation. A surprising negative relationship is noted between trust and participation. Of particular interest may be the role of normative commitment, which appears to be a powerful driver of participation, particularly notable since economic benefits might logically be expected to be stronger drivers of member involvement in this context. Entrepreneurial networks, relationship marketing, economic development...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, modern economies {{have shifted}} away from being based on {{physical}} capital and towards being based on new knowledge (e. g., new ideas and inventions). Conse-quently, contemporary economic theorizing and key public policies {{have been based on}} the assumption that resources for generating knowledge (e. g., education, diversity of indus-tries) are essential for regional economic vitality. However, policy makers and scholars have discovered that, contrary to expectations, the mere presence of, and investments in, new knowledge does not guarantee a high level of regional economic performance (e. g., high entrepreneurship rates). To date, this “knowledge paradox ” has resisted resolution. We take an interdisciplinary perspective to offer a new explanation, hypothesizing that “hid-den ” regional culture differences serve as a crucial factor that is missing from conventional economic analyses and public policy strategies. Focusing on entrepreneurial activity, we hypothesize that the statistical relation between knowledge resources and <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>vitality</b> (i. e., high entrepreneurship rates) in a region will depend on “hidden ” regional differ-ences in entrepreneurial culture. To capture such “hidden ” regional differences, we deriv...|$|E
40|$|In its 1998 White Paper on competitiveness, the British {{government}} {{stressed the}} importance of entrepreneurship in halting Britain's apparent relative economic decline and in enhancing international competitiveness. In this document the potential contribution of entrepreneurship is envisaged primarily in terms of the need to increase the supply of entrepreneurs capable of starting and growing innovative new businesses; less recognition is given to the <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>vitality</b> of the existing business base. This is in keeping with much of the influential policy and research literature, in which concentration through core growth of single firms has tended to be valued, rather than growth through diversification by entrepreneurs starting additional firms. The authors researched diversification as an entrepreneurial phenomenon through case studies of new high-growth Scottish companies. Most business founders in the study had established more than one company, and many had successfully pursued entrepreneurial forms of diversification. The high-growth companies were, in effect, embryonic business clusters, rather than single unidimensional businesses. This supports the notion that the greatest source of new high-growth businesses is entrepreneurs with existing businesses, not novice entrepreneurs. This has implications for future policy support for entrepreneurship. ...|$|E

Consequently, contemporary economic theorizing and key public policies {{have been based on}} the assumption that resources for generating knowledge (e. g., education, diversity of industries) are essential for regional economic vitality. However, policy makers and scholars have discovered that, contrary to expectations, the mere presence of, and investments in, new knowledge does not guarantee a high level of regional economic performance (e. g., high entrepreneurship rates). To date, this "knowledge paradox" has resisted resolution. We take an interdisciplinary perspective to offer a new explanation, hypothesizing that "hidden" regional culture differences serve as a crucial factor that is missing from conventional economic analyses and public policy strategies. Focusing on entrepreneurial activity, we hypothesize that the statistical relation between knowledge resources and <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>vitality</b> (i. e., high entrepreneurship rates) in a region will depend on "hidden" regional differences in entrepreneurial culture. To capture such "hidden" regional differences, we derive measures of entrepreneurship-prone culture from two large personality datasets from the United States (N = 935, 858) and Great Britain (N = 417, 217). In both countries, the findings were consistent with the knowledge-culture-interaction hypothesis. A series of nine additional robustness checks underscored the robustness of these results. Naturally, these purely correlational findings cannot provide direct evidence for causal processes, but the results nonetheless yield a remarkably consistent and robust picture in the two countries. In doing so, the findings raise the idea of regional culture serving as a new causal candidate, potentially driving the knowledge paradox; such an explanation would be consistent with research on the psychological characteristics of entrepreneurs...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{is focused on the}} city, as an {{urbanized}} space, thought and produced for and by man. It studies a notion of patrimony/ city that is beyond its architectonic and functional importance for it includes, forcibly, the human and humanized dimension, being this later vector the one that will grant it sustainability. Setting out from the will to contribute to the vitality of cities in the promotion of their requalification, we explored the viability of an interactive and mediatory instrument, which can be potentially useful to its management and planning. For doing so, we built measurable, objective but, above all, interactive parameters. This perspective, which is global and complex, claims the conjunction of the pedagogical approach, with factors of motivational capitalization and of the catalyzing of competences and abilities. It also casts a new look at the identification of opportunities able to vitalize the well-being of cities. Therefore, it is our belief that these are indicators of mediation because they aim at rethinking planning through a continuous exercise and systemic action in the intervention in potentially contentious spaces. Being our object of study “the places” in urban space, we built the concept of “entrepreneurial vitality”. We defined it based on the following three dimensions: (i) motivation, (ii) capabilities and (iii) opportunities. The conjugation of these three dimensions leads us to the notion of the degree of people’s capability, which, for us, will be greater (i) the better the motivational environment that structures the dynamic of places is, (ii) the better the factors that qualify and promote skills, capabilities and abilities are, {{so that they can be}} seen as social actors and agents and (iii) the more synergic the opportunities to catalyze the degree of participation in the several activities are, including the economic and political, which embody a community. In this reflection we started from an eclectic look at the critical field of social sciences regarding urban planning. Afterwards, we widened the perspective to show the importance of the articulation between analytical procedures and social intervention. We also plead for planning as a mediatory and relational practice in the creation of spaces that will enable social cohesion and convergence. This environment recreates the concepts of competitiveness and competences, here observed as spaces that materialize and instigate economic, social, political and cultural processes, whose interaction constitutes the core of sustenance for the sustainability of spaces. city, skills, competitiveness, <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>vitality,</b> sustainable planning. ...|$|E
