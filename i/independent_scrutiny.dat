40|$|NoDiscussion of the {{declared}} {{policies of}} the Catholic Church in England and Wales, since 2001, {{with regard to the}} ongoing status of priests convicted in criminal courts of offences against children is presented. The extent to which these policies have followed recommendations 77 and 78 of A Programme for Action (Nolan, 2001 a) {{and the extent to which}} they have resulted in the laicisation (removal from the clerical state) of priests are both explored, using national data and with reference to two particular cases from the Diocese of Salford. The potentially adverse impact on victims and survivors of any mismatch between the rhetoric of policy and the reality of practice by the Church is emphasised. Data presented demonstrate that, between November 2001 and September 2010, a majority (64 %) of relevantly convicted and sentenced priests had not been laicised as would be expected. Suggestion is made that the Church is inhibited in carrying out its declared policies because it is attempting to serve legitimacy communities beyond victims and survivors of clerical abuse.

40|$|Modern {{antitrust}} analysis {{rests on}} a strange perch. Its paradigmatic method—pretentiously entitled the Rule of Reason—appears (but only appears) to be a dichotomous analytic. At the first stage, a court supposedly defines the relevant market and determines, {{as a matter of}} fact, whether marketplace forces constrain the defendant from profitably raising price above the level that would prevail in a competitive market. Only when market forces are inadequate to protect consumers, that is, the defendant has market power, does the court proceed to stage two, at which it assesses, as a matter of law, whether the defendant used its power improperly. Nothing approaching this dichotomous analytic paradigm is true. The ostensibly separate inquiries into market power and competitive effects are really a unitary assessment of the industry’s best competitive makeup, that is the allocation of business realms into those requiring rivalry and those in which cooperation or foreclosure are permitted. For example, rivalry is usually required in the realm of short-run price competition. But in some cases, such as when a firm holds a valuable patent, courts permit foreclosure in that short-term realm in order to foster competition to innovate new products over the longer term. Although the “competitive makeup” term of art is foreign to the antitrust vocabulary, it captures actual antitrust practice in the courts. Everybody knows that pure competition is a fiction; all industries involve an amalgam of competitive, cooperative, and foreclosed realms. And antitrust law requires competition only where it serves consumer interests. Although many experts question whether federal judges can effectively assess business conduct as the competitive makeup approach requires, Austrian economics provides a theoretical justification for concluding that thoughtful judges {{can do a better job}} of resolving antitrust cases than would mindless, automaton courts applying necessarily over- and underinclusive bright-line prophylactic rules. Most importantly, the Supreme Court has to date, including its most recent 2013 decision, demanded that federal judges engage theory and make thoughtful antitrust decisions. Although much of this Article is interpretive, attempting to explain what courts actually do when they say they are applying the antitrust dichotomy, it recognizes a significant problem that requires a remedy. Trial judges have the power to dictate the level of scrutiny that appellate courts will apply to their decisions. The false dichotomy can be manipulated so that most decisions can be framed as either issues of market definition, reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard, or competitive effect, reviewed de novo. Given the complexity and social import of many antitrust cases, a single federal judge should not have this power. Appellate courts should thus abandon the clearly erroneous standard of review for market definition. The Supreme Court requires <b>independent</b> appellate <b>scrutiny</b> of fact-findings controlling important issues of public policy that are indistinguishable from the antitrust laws. It would thus be a small, but important, step to impose a de novo review standard for all antitrust issues...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the question as}} to why multilevel politics is becoming an integral part of politics in Europe. Multilevel politics is conceptualized as a system which functions through a complex web of political relations within and across levels of decision making. The thesis argues that the rise of multilevel politics can be explained by its institutionalization in terms of the emergence, the evolution and especially the effects of relevant institutions. Based on a mixed-method research project, the influence of European institutions on subnational actors and the alignment of actor motives with institutional characteristics are empirically shown. The first chapter of the dissertation establishes the centrality of institutions for political transformation, examines the role of transnational and domestic institutions for multilevel politics, and contextualizes the research question in terms of institution-actor relations. The second chapter develops a new-institutionalist theoretical framework that explains the emergence, the evolution and the effects of the institutions, and formulates a series of hypotheses with regard to freestanding institutional influence, power distribution, material benefits and political identification. The third chapter outlines the mixed-method research design which addresses individual-level and institutional-level variations through a Europe-wide survey and a comparative case study. The fourth chapter on survey results shows generally favourable views on multilevel politics, and strong associations of these views with the <b>independent</b> variables under <b>scrutiny.</b> The fifth chapter specifies a multivariate model which includes all posited variables and confirms the majority of the hypotheses. Therefore, the new-institutionalist argument is broadly confirmed, while there is relatively weak evidence to sustain sociological explanations. The final chapter compares the Committee of the Regions and the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities, and examines the institutional characteristics which correspond to the hypothesized variables. It is then concluded that the two institutions share several overarching similarities, and display complementarity in other aspects.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the human and}} sovereign rights of plane arrival asylum seekers in Australia. Since its inception, the Australian Federal Parliament has exercised its power to create exceptions to the law that exclude some people from gaining permanent residency and citizenship. This discriminatory practice undermines the power of Australian courts to protect the inalienable human rights of all sovereign human beings, regardless of their country of citizenship. Some of the tensions between the Federal Parliament and the Court regarding protection of asylum seekers are analysed. The basis for analysis is an in-depth and robust qualitative study of 20 plane arrival asylum seeker cases. All of the arrivals failed to gain asylum {{in the first stage}} of the process. The main focus is to examine the problem of achieving fair assessments of this cohorts protection claims and the human rights abuses suffered during this process. The reasons as to why they were not granted protection is assessed and interpreted in the context of international and domestic law. Particular refugee determination decisions are analysed in detail. This is followed by a forensic qualitative examination of tribunal review decisions and an examination of the way Ministerial requests for humanitarian consideration were declined. Legislation affecting court outcomes is also examined. Immigration department correspondence with asylum seekers and their advocates was included in the analysis where appropriate. The findings of this study demonstrate the systemic administrative practice of exclusion of some plane arrival asylum seekers from 1997 to 2009 regardless of the merits of their protection needs. Ways in which the assessment process could be made more just are presented. The thesis concludes that Australias Federal Parliament is failing in its duty to work co-operatively, but at arms-length with independent bodies, to establish appropriately fair policies for determining refugee status. Prior to and since the Parliamentary Human Rights Committee was established in 2012 asylum seekers arriving by plane have continued to suffer serious human rights breaches. Social justice requires an essential <b>independent</b> Human Rights <b>scrutiny</b> of legislation and refugee determination and this thesis highlights the failure of the system to do this...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{possibility}} of some degree of unity in Paradiso, which appears initially to be a work of poetic self-indulgence, lacking a coherent plot, credible characters and causality, and possessing seemingly extraneous chapters. In particular, the characters, with their one shared voice (Lezama’s) and apparently arbitrary appearances in <b>independent</b> scenarios, demand <b>scrutiny.</b> Lezama Lima's earlier works are devoted to his sistema poético, a working method aimed at a material representation of the mystical world of the Spirit in the "incarnate Word". Since the writer himself has defined Paradiso as a novela-poema, the novel is here examined as a poem, with the characters (recurring images) fulfilling symbolic roles. Luis Fernández Sosa’s reading of some of Lezama’s poems "anagogically" (following the terminology of Northrop Frye) is equally applicable to Paradiso, with its multiple levels of meaning. In Paradiso each act or incident is ritualized, suggesting that the characters are indeed symbolic and may attain the stature of archetypes. Characters derived from members of Lezama’s family circle acquire symbolic names and layer upon layer of additional imagery until they are expanded into archetypes. The recurring image of the (family) tree linking heaven and earth, continual emphasis on the cycle of birth/death/renewal and the main configurations, such as hero/princess/dragon/treasure, assist {{in the identification of}} the principal symbolic characters: Great Mother Goddess, Son/Lover, Dionysiac sacrifice, the questing Orpheus and the magnificent doomed Icarus. Each concept or character is a stepping-stone for the central auto- biographical figure, inspired by personal tragedy to seek self-perfection and accept his vocation. The stages on the journey [...] family relationships, the discovery and mastery of sexuality and creativity, the pursuit of infinite knowledge [...] are presided over by a variety of tutors, not least Rialta, Cemí’s anima, poetic Muse and spiritual guide. Within Cemí’s heroic conquest of the Unconscious, the imagery of the quest yields much when interpreted in terms of Jungian archetypes. With his eventual assimilation of opposites, Cemí becomes actively contemplative, attuned to ritmo hesicástico and obedient to his calling. 'The analysis of character is the key to Lezama’s fictionalized autobiography, which emerges as a finely structured novel given precise form by its symbolic characters...|$|R
