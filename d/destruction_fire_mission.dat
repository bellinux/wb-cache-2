Spotting rounds are then [...] "walked" [...] on to the target. When the spotting round is either on the target or the necessary adjustment is small enough to be within allowable limits, the FO calls for a <b>fire</b> <b>mission,</b> often with the phrase, [...] "Fire for effect." [...] If the first <b>fire</b> <b>mission</b> does not reduce the position or change the tactical situation sufficiently, other <b>fire</b> <b>missions</b> may be called for.|$|R

50|$|The MiniTSFO used {{a virtual}} DMD to control <b>fire</b> <b>missions.</b> The user was {{presented}} with one of five random target screens. The user would then determine how to engage the target by either grid location, polar coordinates, or shifting from a known point by flipping {{back and forth between}} the target screen and the map. Once the target was located, the user would go to the virtual DMD and enter a <b>fire</b> <b>mission</b> just as a real FO would do with a real DMD. Messages {{back and forth between the}} user and the fire direction center (shot and splash) would precede the depiction of an artillery round bursting where the user had described the target location. The user would then use the virtual DMD to adjust the fire onto the target, fire for effect, and then give end-of-mission details. After the end of the <b>fire</b> <b>mission,</b> the user would be critiqued on several factors such as initial target location, description, how many rounds were needed to fire-for-effect, and overall mission completion.|$|R

The Dragon Fire II was incorporated into testing with the Counter Rockets, Artillery, and Mortars (C-RAM) project while it was still undergoing engineering and safety tests at Yuma Proving Ground. It fired in support of C-RAM's demonstrations and was responsive and accurate, with most rounds landing within a circular error probable (CEP) of 15 m at a range of 5,600 m.|$|R
