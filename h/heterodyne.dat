5|$|Optical <b>heterodyne</b> {{detection}} is {{an extension}} of the <b>heterodyne</b> technique to higher (visible) frequencies.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} and widely used application of the <b>heterodyne</b> technique is in the superheterodyne receiver (superhet), invented by U.S. engineer Edwin Howard Armstrong in 1918. In this circuit, the incoming radio frequency signal from the antenna is mixed with a signal from a local oscillator (LO) and converted by the <b>heterodyne</b> technique to a lower fixed frequency signal called the intermediate frequency (IF). This IF is amplified and filtered, before being applied to a detector which extracts the audio signal, which {{is sent to the}} loudspeaker.|$|E
5|$|Optical <b>heterodyne</b> {{detection}} is {{an essential}} technique used in high-accuracy measurements of the frequencies of optical sources, {{as well as in}} the stabilization of their frequencies. Until a relatively few years ago, lengthy frequency chains were needed to connect the microwave frequency of a cesium or other atomic time source to optical frequencies. At each step of the chain, a frequency multiplier would be used to produce a harmonic of the frequency of that step, which would be compared by <b>heterodyne</b> detection with the next step (the output of a microwave source, far infrared laser, infrared laser, or visible laser). Each measurement of a single spectral line required several years of effort in the construction of a custom frequency chain. Currently, optical frequency combs have provided a much simpler method of measuring optical frequencies. If a mode-locked laser is modulated to form a train of pulses, its spectrum is seen to consist of the carrier frequency surrounded by a closely spaced comb of optical sideband frequencies with a spacing equal to the pulse repetition frequency (Fig.16). The pulse repetition frequency is locked to that of the frequency standard, and the frequencies of the comb elements at the red end of the spectrum are doubled and heterodyned with the frequencies of the comb elements at the blue end of the spectrum, thus allowing the comb to serve as its own reference. In this manner, locking of the frequency comb output to an atomic standard can be performed in a single step. To measure an unknown frequency, the frequency comb output is dispersed into a spectrum. The unknown frequency is overlapped with the appropriate spectral segment of the comb and the frequency of the resultant <b>heterodyne</b> beats is measured.|$|E
5|$|Optical <b>heterodyne</b> {{detection}} is {{used for}} coherent Doppler lidar measurements capable of detecting very weak light scattered in the atmosphere and monitoring wind speeds with high accuracy. It has application in optical fiber communications, in various high resolution spectroscopic techniques, and the self-heterodyne method {{can be used to}} measure the linewidth of a laser.|$|E
5|$|In {{telecommunication}} networks, heterodyning {{is used to}} move {{frequencies of}} individual signals to different channels which may share a single physical transmission line. This is called frequency division multiplexing (FDM). For example, a coaxial cable used by a cable television system can carry 500 television channels {{at the same time}} because each one is given a different frequency, so they don't interfere with one another. Continuous wave (CW) doppler radar detectors are basically <b>heterodyne</b> detection devices that compare transmitted and reflected beams.|$|E
5|$|The United States Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) and the United States Department of Defense Space Test Program (STP) {{conducted}} the Charged Aerosol Release Experiment (CARE) on September 19, 2009, using exhaust particles from a Black Brant XII suborbital sounding rocket launched from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility {{to create an}} artificial noctilucent cloud. The cloud was to be observed {{over a period of}} weeks or months by ground instruments and the Spatial <b>Heterodyne</b> IMager for MEsospheric Radicals (SHIMMER) instrument on the NRL/STP STPSat-1 spacecraft. The rocket's exhaust plume was observed and reported to news organizations in the United States from New Jersey to Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|The <b>heterodyne</b> {{technique}} {{is used for}} (1) shifting an input signal into a new frequency range as well as (2) amplifying a weak input signal (assuming use of an active mixer). A weak input signal of frequency f1 is mixed with a strong reference frequency f2 from a local oscillator (LO). The nonlinear combination of the input signals creates two new signals, one at the sum f1+f2 of the two frequencies, and the other at the difference f1âˆ’f2. These new frequencies are called heterodynes. Typically {{only one of the}} new frequencies is desired, and the other signal is filtered out of the output of the mixer. The output signal will have an intensity proportional to the product of the amplitudes of the input signals.|$|E
25|$|Shot {{noise is}} {{produced}} by electrons in transit across a discontinuity, which occurs in all detectors. Shot noise is the dominant source in most receivers. There will also be flicker noise caused by electron transit through amplification devices, which is reduced using <b>heterodyne</b> amplification. Another reason for <b>heterodyne</b> processing is that for fixed fractional bandwidth, the instantaneous bandwidth increases linearly in frequency. This allows improved range resolution. The one notable exception to <b>heterodyne</b> (downconversion) radar systems is ultra-wideband radar. Here a single cycle, or transient wave, is used similar to UWB communications, see List of UWB channels.|$|E
25|$|Synthetic array <b>heterodyne</b> {{detection}} {{offers another}} {{approach to this}} problem {{without the need for}} high dispersion.|$|E
25|$|In {{the opera}} within Girl Genius, the <b>Heterodyne</b> {{daughter}} who {{falls in love}} with the Storm King is Euphrosynia.|$|E
25|$|HIFI (<b>Heterodyne</b> Instrument for the Far Infrared): A <b>heterodyne</b> {{detector}} able to electronically separate radiation {{of different}} wavelengths, giving a spectral resolution {{as high as}} R=107. The spectrometer was operated within two wavelength bands, from 157 to 212 micrometres and from 240 to 625 micrometres. SRON Netherlands Institute for Space Research led the entire process of designing, constructing and testing HIFI. The HIFI Instrument Control Center, also {{under the leadership of}} SRON, was responsible for obtaining and analysing the data.|$|E
25|$|In Girl Genius, {{the main}} {{character}} Agatha <b>Heterodyne</b> is given a calliope to repair by a travelling circus that had been wrecked, and thought to be beyond repair, in volumes 4 and 5. In the climax of volume 6, it is revealed she had modified it to control an army of small robots.|$|E
25|$|Caroline {{returned}} on 9 March 1977 on 953kHz, actually 315 metres but {{announced as}} 319. This gave reasonable reception by day but strong <b>heterodyne</b> interference at night because the transmitter crystal was off-channel. In July Caroline {{moved to the}} adjacent channel, 962kHz (312 metres but still called 319) and reception in the UK improved. Meanwhile, Radio Mi Amigo had interference on 1562kHz and changed to 1412kHz (212 m).|$|E
25|$|One major {{disadvantage}} to the {{superheterodyne receiver}} {{is the problem}} of image frequency. In <b>heterodyne</b> receivers, an image frequency is an undesired input frequency equal to the station frequency plus twice the intermediate frequency. The image frequency results in two stations being received at the same time, thus producing interference. Image frequencies can be eliminated by sufficient attenuation on the incoming signal by the RF amplifier filter of the superheterodyne receiver.|$|E
25|$|The {{signal is}} then fed into a circuit {{where it is}} mixed with a sine wave from a {{variable}} frequency oscillator known as the local oscillator (LO). The mixer uses a non-linear component to produce both sum and difference beat frequencies signals, each one containing the modulation contained in the desired signal. The output of the mixer may include the original RF signal at fRF, the local oscillator signal at fLO, and the two new <b>heterodyne</b> frequencies fRF+fLO and fRFfLO. The mixer may inadvertently produce additional frequencies such as third- and higher-order intermodulation products. Ideally, the IF bandpass filter removes all but the desired IF signal at fIF. The IF signal contains the original modulation (transmitted information) that the received radio signal had at fRF.|$|E
25|$|Parallel or full field OCT using a {{charge-coupled}} device (CCD) camera {{has been used}} in which the sample is full-field illuminated and en face imaged with the CCD, hence eliminating the electromechanical lateral scan. By stepping the reference mirror and recording successive en face images a three-dimensional representation can be reconstructed. Three-dimensional OCT using a CCD camera was demonstrated in a phase-stepped technique, using geometric phase shifting with a Linnik interferometer, utilising a pair of CCDs and <b>heterodyne</b> detection, and in a Linnik interferometer with an oscillating reference mirror and axial translation stage. Central to the CCD approach is the necessity for either very fast CCDs or carrier generation separate to the stepping reference mirror to track the high frequency OCT carrier.|$|E
25|$|As of its {{founding}} RCA {{was the largest}} radio communications firm in the United States. However, American Marconi had been falling behind industry advances, particularly in vacuum tube technology, and GE needed access to additional patents before its new subsidiary could be fully competitive. The result {{was a series of}} negotiations and a complicated set of cross-licensing agreements between various companies. On July 1, 1920, an agreement was made with the American Telephone & Telegraph Company (AT), which purchased 500,000 shares of RCA, although it would divest these shares in early 1923. The United Fruit Company held a small portfolio of radio patents, and signed two agreements in 1921. GE's traditional electric company rival, the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Corporation, had also purchased rights to some critical patents, including one for <b>heterodyne</b> receiving originally issued to Reginald Fessenden, plus regenerative circuit and superheterodyne receiver patents issued to Edwin Armstrong. Westinghouse was able to use this to negotiate a cross-licensing agreement, effective July 1, 1921, that included a concession that 40% of RCA's equipment purchases would be from Westinghouse. Following these transactions, GE owned 30.1% of RCA's stock, Westinghouse 20.6%, AT 10.3%, and United Fruit 4.1%, with the remaining 34.9% owned by individual shareholders.|$|E
500|$|In physics, one of {{the most}} {{important}} experiments of the late 19th century was the famous [...] "failed experiment" [...] of Michelson and Morley which provided evidence for special relativity. Recent repetitions of the Michelsonâ€“Morley experiment perform <b>heterodyne</b> measurements of beat frequencies of crossed cryogenic optical resonators. Fig7 illustrates a resonator experiment performed by MÃ¼ller et al. in 2003. Two optical resonators constructed from crystalline sapphire, controlling the frequencies of two lasers, were set at right angles within a helium cryostat. A frequency comparator measured the beat frequency of the combined outputs of the two resonators. , the precision by which anisotropy of the speed of light can be excluded in resonator experiments is at the 10âˆ’17 level.|$|E
500|$|The first {{claim of}} a dust shell {{surrounding}} Betelgeuse was put forth in 1977 {{when it was}} noted that dust shells around mature stars often emit large amounts of radiation in excess of the photospheric contribution. Using <b>heterodyne</b> interferometry, it was concluded that the red supergiant emits most of its excess radiation from positions beyond 12 stellar radii or roughly the distance of the Kuiper belt at 50 to 60 AU, which depends on the assumed stellar radius. Since then, there have been studies done of this dust envelope at varying wavelengths yielding decidedly different results. Studies from the 1990s have estimated the inner radius of the dust shell anywhere from 0.5 to 1.0arcseconds, or 100 to 200AU. These studies point out that the dust environment surrounding Betelgeuse is not static. In 1994, it was reported that Betelgeuse undergoes sporadic decades long dust production, followed by inactivity. In 1997, significant changes in the dust shell's morphology in one year were noted, suggesting that the shell is asymmetrically illuminated by a stellar radiation field strongly affected by the existence of photospheric hotspots. The 1984 report of a giant asymmetric dust shell 1pc (...) [...] has not been corroborated by recent studies, although another published the same year said that three dust shells were found extending four light-years {{from one side of the}} decaying star, suggesting that Betelgeuse sheds its outer layers as it moves.|$|E
2500|$|Alternatively, difference-frequency {{generation}} (DFG) can be used. From {{light of}} {{opposite ends of}} the broadened spectrum the difference frequency is generated in a nonlinear crystal, and a <b>heterodyne</b> beat between this mixing product and light at the same wavelength of the original spectrum is measured. [...] This beat frequency, detectable with a photodiode, is the carrierâ€“envelope offset frequency.|$|E
2500|$|In the [...] "f âˆ’ 2f" [...] technique, {{light at}} the lower-energy side of the broadened {{spectrum}} is doubled using second-harmonic generation (SHG) in a nonlinear crystal, and a <b>heterodyne</b> beat is generated between that and {{light at the}} same wavelength on the upper-energy side of the spectrum. [...] This beat signal, detectable with a photodiode, includes a difference-frequency component, which is the carrierâ€“envelope offset frequency.|$|E
2500|$|Armstrong {{realized}} that this was a potential solution to the [...] "short wave" [...] amplification problem, since the beat frequency still retained its original modulation, but on a lower carrier frequency. To monitor a frequency of 1500kHz for example, he could set up an oscillator at, for example, 1560kHz, which would produce a <b>heterodyne</b> difference frequency of 60kHz, a frequency that could then be more conveniently amplified by the triodes of the day. He termed this the [...] "intermediate frequency" [...] often abbreviated to [...] "IF".|$|E
2500|$|A major area of {{research}} is to develop higher frequency rectifiers, that can rectify into terahertz and light frequencies. [...] These devices are used in optical <b>heterodyne</b> detection, which has myriad applications in optical fiber communication and atomic clocks. [...] Another prospective application for such devices is to directly rectify light waves picked up by tiny antenna, called nantennas, to produce DC electric power. [...] It is thought that arrays of nantennas could be a more efficient means of producing solar power than solar cells.|$|E
2500|$|Beat {{frequency}} oscillator (BFO) - This is an electronic oscillator {{which is only}} found in communications receivers, used in the reception of radiotelegraph (CW) or single-sideband modulation (SSB). [...] It produces a fixed frequency offset from the IF which is mixed with the IF in the demodulator. [...] The IF and BFO frequencies produce a <b>heterodyne</b> (beat) in the audio range which sounds like a musical tone in the speaker. [...] In CW the [...] "dots" [...] and [...] "dashes" [...] of the Morse code are audible as beeps.|$|E
2500|$|A {{simultaneous}} radio {{call from}} the Pan Am crew caused mutual interference on the radio frequency, which was audible in the KLM cockpit as a 3-second-long shrill sound, (or <b>heterodyne).</b> This caused the KLM crew to miss the crucial latter portion of the tower's response. The Pan Am crew's transmission was [...] "We're still taxiing down the runway, the Clipper 1736!". This message was also blocked by the interference and inaudible to the KLM crew. Either message, if heard in the KLM cockpit, would have alerted the crew to the situation and given them time to abort the takeoff attempt.|$|E
2500|$|In 1982 the Far Infrared and Sub-millimetre Telescope (FIRST) was {{proposed}} to ESA. The ESA long-term policy-plan [...] "Horizon 2000", produced in 1984, {{called for a}} High Throughput <b>Heterodyne</b> Spectroscopy mission {{as one of its}} cornerstone missions. In 1986, FIRST was adopted as this cornerstone mission. It was selected for implementation in 1993, following an industrial study in 1992â€“1993. The mission concept was redesigned from Earth-orbit to the Lagrangian point L2, in light of experience gained from the Infrared Space Observatory [...] In 2000, FIRST was renamed Herschel. After being put out to tender in 2000, industrial activities began in 2001. Herschel was launched in 2009.|$|E
2500|$|Aircraft {{communications}} {{radio operations}} worldwide use amplitude modulation, predominantly A3E double sideband with full carrier on VHF and UHF, and J3E single sideband with suppressed carrier on HF. Besides being simple, power-efficient and compatible with legacy equipment, AM and SSB permit stronger stations to override weaker or interfering stations. Additionally, this method does not {{suffer from the}} capture effect found in FM. Even if a pilot is transmitting, a control tower can [...] "talk over" [...] that transmission and other aircraft will hear a somewhat garbled mixture of both transmissions, rather than just one or the other. Even if both transmissions are received with identical signal strength, a <b>heterodyne</b> will be heard where no such indication of blockage would be evident in an FM system.|$|E
2500|$|The mixer will process {{not only}} the desired input signal at fRF, but also all signals present at its inputs. There will be many mixer {{products}} (heterodynes). Most other signals produced by the mixer (such as due to stations at nearby frequencies) can be filtered out in the IF amplifier; that gives the superheterodyne receiver its superior performance. However, if fLO is set to fRF+fIF, then an incoming radio signal at fLO+fIF will also produce a <b>heterodyne</b> at fIF; the frequency [...] fLO+fIF is called the image frequency and must be rejected by the tuned circuits in the RF stage. The image frequency is 2fIF higher (or lower) than the desired frequency fRF, so employing a higher IF frequency fIF increases the receiver's image rejection without requiring additional selectivity in the RF stage.|$|E
2500|$|An {{interesting}} {{effect was}} predicted by Lord Rayleigh {{in his classic}} book on sound: if the source is moving toward the observer at twice the speed of sound, a musical piece emitted by that source would be heard in correct time and tune, but backwards. The Doppler effect with sound is only clearly heard with objects moving at high speed, as change in frequency of musical tone involves a speed of around 40 meters per second, and smaller changes in frequency can easily be confused by changes in the amplitude of the sounds from moving emitters. [...] Neil A Downie has demonstrated [...] how the Doppler effect can be made much more easily audible by using an ultrasonic (e.g. 40kHz) emitter on the moving object. The observer then uses a <b>heterodyne</b> frequency converter, as used in many bat detectors, {{to listen to a}} band around 40kHz. In this case, with the bat detector tuned to give frequency for the stationary emitter of 2000Hz, the observer will perceive a frequency shift of a whole tone, 240Hz, if the emitter travels at 2 meters per second.|$|E
2500|$|... "Superheterodyne" [...] is a {{contraction}} of [...] "supersonic heterodyne", where [...] "supersonic" [...] indicates frequencies above {{the range of}} human hearing. The word <b>heterodyne</b> {{is derived from the}} Greek roots hetero- [...] "different", and -dyne [...] "power". In radio applications the term derives from the [...] "heterodyne detector" [...] pioneered by Canadian inventor Reginald Fessenden in 1905, describing his proposed method of producing an audible signal from the Morse code transmissions of the new continuous wave transmitters. With the older spark gap transmitters then in use, the Morse code signal consisted of short bursts of a heavily modulated carrier wave, which could be clearly heard as a series of short chirps or buzzes in the receiver's headphones. However, the signal from a continuous wave transmitter did not have any such inherent modulation and Morse Code from one of those would only be heard as a series of clicks or thumps. Fessenden's idea was to run two Alexanderson alternators, one producing a carrier frequency 3kHz higher than the other. In the receiver's detector the two carriers would beat together to produce a 3kHz tone thus in the headphones the Morse signals would then be heard as a series of 3kHz beeps. For this he coined the term [...] "heterodyne" [...] meaning [...] "generated by a difference" [...] (in frequency).|$|E
2500|$|U.S. {{patent law}} {{included}} a provision for challenging grants if another inventor could prove prior discovery. With {{an eye to}} increasing {{the value of the}} patent portfolio that would be sold to Western Electric in 1917, beginning in 1915 de Forest filed a series of patent applications that largely copied Armstrong's claims, in the hopes of having the priority of the competing applications upheld by an interference hearing at the patent office. Based on a notebook entry recorded at the time, de Forest asserted that, while working on the cascade amplifier, he had stumbled on August 6, 1912 across the feedback principle, which was then used in the spring of 1913 to operate a low-powered transmitter for <b>heterodyne</b> reception of Federal Telegraph arc transmissions. However, there was also strong evidence that de Forest was unaware of the full significance of this discovery, as shown by his lack of follow-up and continuing misunderstanding of the physics involved. In particular, it appeared that he was unaware of the potential for further development until he became familiar with Armstrong's research. De Forest was not alone in the interference determination [...] the patent office identified four competing claimants for its hearings, consisting of Armstrong, de Forest, General Electric's Langmuir, and a German, Alexander Meissner, whose application would be seized by the Office of Alien Property Custodian during World War I.|$|E

50|$|<b>Heterodyne</b> {{detectors}} are {{the most}} commonly used, and most self-build detectors are of this type. A <b>heterodyne</b> function is often also built into the other types of detector. A <b>heterodyne</b> bat detector simply shifts all the ultrasound frequencies downwards by a fixed amount so we can hear them.|$|E
5000|$|The {{following}} recording {{was made}} on a Duet combined <b>heterodyne</b> and FD detector. The <b>heterodyne</b> frequency was 53 kHz and the corresponding track sounds like this: ...|$|E
50|$|The JCMT is also {{equipped}} with three <b>heterodyne</b> receivers, which allow submillimetre spectral line observations to be made. The spectral-line mapping {{capabilities of the}} JCMT have been greatly enhanced by the commissioning of HARP-B, a 350 GHz, 16 element <b>heterodyne</b> array receiver. HARP-B, and the other <b>heterodyne</b> instruments, {{can be used in}} conjunction with the JCMT's new digital autocorrelation spectrometer, ACSIS.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{circuit designs}} often simplify this circuit {{and avoid the}} {{complexity}} of two <b>heterodyne</b> oscillators by having a single pitch oscillator, akin to the original theremin's volume circuit. This approach is usually less stable and cannot generate the low frequencies that a <b>heterodyne</b> oscillator can. Better designs (e.g., Moog, Theremax) may use two pairs of <b>heterodyne</b> oscillators, for both pitch and volume.|$|E
