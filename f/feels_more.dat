5|$|Score Entertainment {{created a}} Sonic X {{collectible}} card game for two players, released in 2005. Players battle for Chaos Emeralds; whoever gets three first wins. Each turn, both players lay out five cards face-down and flip over {{one at a}} time; whichever card has a lower number value is eliminated. Eliminating the other player's cards and combining the special abilities of one's own cards allows one to score rings; whichever player has the most rings {{at the end of}} the turn wins an Emerald. As the game does not emphasize collecting rare cards, a few booster packs are enough to build a competent deck. KidzWorld gave a positive review, praising its ease of learning, low cost, and inherent strategy, but also noting that it <b>feels</b> <b>more</b> like a generic card game with Sonic characters than like a wholly Sonic-based product.|$|E
5|$|The book is {{a fictional}} autobiography, {{describing}} the life of Maximilien Aue, a former officer in the SS who, decades later, {{tells the story of}} a crucial part of his life when he was an active member of the security forces of the Third Reich. Aue begins his narrative as a member of an Einsatzgruppe in 1941, before being sent to the doomed German forces locked in the Battle of Stalingrad, which he survives. After a convalescence period in Berlin, and a visit to occupied France, he is designated for an advisory role for the concentration camps, and visits the extermination camps. He is ultimately present during the 1945 Battle of Berlin, the Nazi regime's last stand. By the end of the story, he flees Germany under a false French identity to start a new life in northern France. Throughout the account, Aue meets several famous Nazis, including Adolf Eichmann, Heinrich Himmler and Adolf Hitler. In the book, Aue accepts responsibility for his actions, but most of the time he <b>feels</b> <b>more</b> like an observer than a direct participant.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{proposed}} study {{is to examine the}} effects of the transition into new motherhood and the differences in these effects among American and French primiparous mothers. The study establishes the societal pressures and cultural expectations placed on the motherhood role, historically and to the present day, and presents possible sources for maternal guilt, role strain, and a sense of loss of individuated self in the transition to new motherhood. This mixed methods study uses semi-structured interviews, vignettes, the Job-Family Role Strain Scale, and the Motherhood Salience Scale to determine the effects of the transition into the new mother role. American mothers, compared with French mothers, are expected to <b>feel</b> <b>more</b> societal pressure related to motherhood, practice <b>more</b> intensive mothering, <b>feel</b> <b>more</b> “Supermom” pressure, <b>feel</b> <b>more</b> role strain related to work-family balance, <b>feel</b> <b>more</b> maternal guilt, place motherhood higher on their identity salience hierarchy, and <b>feel</b> <b>more</b> of a loss of individuated self. This research may provide a fuller understanding of the motherhood role and how the shift into new motherhood is felt cross-culturally...|$|R

25|$|Maslow's {{hierarchy}} of {{needs is a}} pyramid depicting the levels of human needs, psychological, and physical.

Beyond the routine of needs fulfillment, Maslow envisioned moments of extraordinary experience, known as peak experiences, profound moments of love, understanding, happiness, or rapture, during which a person <b>feels</b> <b>more</b> whole, alive, self-sufficient, and yet a part of the world.

500|$|VanDerWerff stated {{this was}} his {{favorite}} episode of the show so far, [...] "an hour that simultaneously <b>feels</b> <b>more</b> propulsive and more relaxed than the last three." [...] He admitted that {{the better part of}} it was given to exposition, with many monologues by the characters to expose their motivations and background. In his opinion, though, it was done skillfully and efficiently. IGN's Matt Fowler wrote that it was another great, exposition-heavy episode and that the best and most natural scene happened between Viserys and Doreah in the bath.|$|E

While praising most of the game's refinements, Watters singled out the Flood as enemies he thought the original game envisioned better, saying [...] "the simplicity of the classic look <b>feels</b> <b>more</b> sinister and alien".

40|$|Three {{vignette}} studies examined {{stereotypes of}} the emotions associated with high- and low-status group members. In Study 1 a, participants believed that in negative situations, high-status people <b>feel</b> <b>more</b> angry than sad or guilty and that low-status people <b>feel</b> <b>more</b> sad and guilty than angry. Study 1 b showed that in response to positive outcomes, high-status {{people are expected to}} <b>feel</b> <b>more</b> pride and low-status people are expected to <b>feel</b> <b>more</b> appreciation. Study 2 showed that people also infer status from emotions: Angry and proud people are thought of as high status, whereas sad, guilty, and appreciative people are considered low status. The authors argue that these emotion stereotypes are due to differences in the inferred abilities of people in high and low positions. These perceptions lead to expectations about agency appraisals and emotions related to agency appraisals. In Study 3, the authors found support for this process by manipulating perceptions of skill and finding the same differences in emotion expectations...|$|R

The film was shot on a budget of £100,000 on location in Liverpool in September and October 2007 and had its world premiere at the 2009 London Film Festival. Joseph Galliano wrote in The Times that Don't Worry About Me is [...] "a very understated film and <b>feels</b> <b>more</b> like European Art Cinema."

500|$|A {{negative}} {{review of}} the film came from Manohla Dargis of The New York Times, who found it [...] "a conventional, wan affair, despite its art-cinema flourishes" [...] and thought that Anna's inability to obtain a visa was a contrived plot point that conflicted with Doremus's attempt at creating realism. The Globe and Mail Rick Groen also found Like Crazy unrealistic, giving the film 2 out of 4 stars and writing that [...] "nothing <b>feels</b> <b>more</b> false than a failed attempt at getting real". Writing for Salon, Andrew O'Hehir opined that the film was uninteresting, unmemorable, and [...] "sickly sweet".
