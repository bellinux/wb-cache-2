The question submitted to the ECJ was whether solid evidence, showing that the detention conditions in a Member State issuing a European arrest warrant (hereafter: EAW) were incompatible with fundamental rights, could allow or oblige the executing judicial authority of a requested Member State to refuse the execution of that arrest warrant. A few months later, a similar question was raised but this time in the field of International cooperation. More specifically the ECJ was asked under which conditions in terms of protection of fundamental rights Mr. Petruhhin, an <b>Estonian</b> <b>citizen</b> who had made use of his right to move freely within the EU, could be surrendered upon an extradition request by Latvia to a third country, Russia...|$|E

The scholar of Wissenschaft des Judentums, Lazar Gulkowitsch wasborn and raised in a traditional Jewish family in Zirin (Belarus), heacquired his doctoral degree in philosophy at the Albertus Universityin Königsberg, worked at Leipzig University (Germany) first asa lecturer on Late Hebrew, Jewish-Aramaic, and Talmudic Studiesat the faculty of theology and then as an associate professor of theStudy of Late Judaism at the faculty of philosophy. In 1934 – 1940 he {{was the head of the}} chair for Jewish Studies at the Universityof Tartu (Estonia). He was killed by the Nazis during the occupationof Estonia in the summer of 1941. His scholarly objective wasto capture the phenomenon of Judaism as a historical and currententity especially from the aspect of language by exploring Hebrewas a reflection of and basis for the history of Jewish ideas; outliningboth its formal-grammatical and material-conceptual aspects. Forthis purpose he applied a method based on the history of ideas (begriffsgeschichtlicheMethode), defining the central ideas of the Jewishculture (God, good, Hesed, etc.).

40|$|Extradition {{agreements}} between Member States and third States {{fall within the}} competence of Member States, but the ruling in Aleksei Petruhhin (Court of Justice, judgment of 6 September 2016, case C- 182 / 15 [GC]) shows that Member States must exercise this competence in light of EU law if extradition may affect an EU citizen’s fundamental rights protected under the Treaties and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. This can be the case if the EU citizen who is subject to extradition has exercised his right to free movement by moving from his home State to another Member State. Extradition of Petruhhin, an <b>Estonian</b> <b>citizen,</b> was requested by Russia while he was exercising his right to freedom of movement and residence in Latvia. As {{is the case in}} many States, the national law of Latvia does not extend the same level of protection against extradition to foreign citizens, as to its own nationals. The Court of Justice ruled that in such a case, extradition of an EU citizen to a third State is generally prohibited under Art. 18 TFEU and can only be justified if the prosecution in the home Member State is not possible. In addition, this case confirms earlier rulings that the extradition of an EU citizen will not be permitted if his fundamental rights under the Charter will be endangered in the requesting State. The case concerns prohibitions of absolute character, such as prohibition against torture and degrading treatment. To determine the possibility of breach of rights under the Charter, the Member State must undertake a rigorous verification of the level of protection of human rights in the relevant third State before deciding whether to grant the extradition request...|$|E
