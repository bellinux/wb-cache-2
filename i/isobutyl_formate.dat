50|$|<b>Isobutyl</b> <b>formate</b> (2-methylpropyl methanoate) is {{an organic}} ester with the {{chemical}} formula C5H10O2. It is formed by diluting isobutanol with formic acid; sulfuric acid {{can serve as}} a catalyst. It is used as a flavor and fragrance ingredient because of its odor which is sweet, ethereal, and slightly fruity.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe rate {{coefficients}} for the reactions of OH with isopropyl formate, <b>isobutyl</b> <b>formate,</b> n-propyl isobutyrate and isopropyl isobutyrate have been determined using both absolute and relative methods. The relative rate method has been also {{used to measure the}} room temperature rate coefficient for the reaction of Cl with the same esters. In addition, a series of runs conducted on the OH-initiated oxidation of isopropyl formate, <b>isobutyl</b> <b>formate</b> and n-propyl isobutyrate showed the formation of acetone from the three reactions. The formation of propanal was also observed for n-propyl isobutyrate...|$|E

40|$|The distonic radical cation HC+ (OH) OCH 2, an isomer of ionized {{methyl formate}} HC(O) OCH 3 +., has been {{generated}} from fragmentation of ionized <b>isobutyl</b> <b>formate</b> and ionized 2 -methylbutyl formate and characterized by collisional activation (CA) and neutralization-reionization (NR) mass spectrometries. A mixture of both methyl formate and distonic radical cations has been detected following ionization of methyl formate. MO calculations at the UHF/ 6 - 31 G** level {{showed that the}} distonic species is more stable its conventional isomer and that the energy difference between both isomers is essentially due to the difference of the O-H and C-H energies. status: publishe...|$|E
