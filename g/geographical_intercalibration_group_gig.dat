40|$|The {{multiple}} protocols {{that have}} been developed to characterize river hydromorphology, partly in response to legislative drivers such as the European Union Water Framework Directive (EU WFD), make the comparison of results obtained in different countries challenging. Recent studies have analyzed the comparability of existing methods, with remote sensing based approaches being proposed as a potential means of harmonizing hydromorphological characterization protocols. However, the resolution achieved by remote sensing products may not be sufficient to assess some of the key hydromorphological features that are required to allow an accurate characterization. Methodologies based on high resolution aerial photography taken from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been proposed by several authors as potential approaches to overcome these limitations. Here, we explore the applicability of an existing UAV based framework for hydromorphological characterization to three different fluvial settings representing some of the distinct ecoregions defined by the WFD <b>geographical</b> <b>intercalibration</b> <b>groups</b> (<b>GIGs).</b> The framework is based on the automated recognition of hydromorphological features via tested and validated Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Results show that the framework is transferable to the Central-Baltic and Mediterranean GIGs with accuracies in feature identification above 70 %. Accuracies of 50 % are achieved when the framework is implemented in the Very Large Rivers GIG. The framework successfully identified vegetation, deep water, shallow water, riffles, side bars and shadows {{for the majority of the}} reaches. However, further algorithm development is required to ensure a wider range of features (e. g., chutes, structures and erosion) are accurately identified.

By means of the intercalibration exercise common European boundaries are proposed for river invertebrate assessment methods, within each GIG. The {{purpose of this study is}} to validate the boundaries proposed for the formal intercalibration exercise using a benchmark dataset comprising data collected in different European countries that satisfy WFD requirements. Such data provide evidence of a high degree of comparability among countries and includes a set of reference sites. The STAR Intercalibration Common metric index (STAR_ICMi) was calculated for benchmark samples selected as the index in which national assessment boundaries are expressed for the intercalibration exercise in two GIGs. For the STAR_ICMi the coefficient of variation was also calculated, demonstrating a comparable variability with indices that are based on a species level identification. A fixed percentile of reference samples STAR_ICMi values were selected as the boundary between High and Good status. The range from this fixed percentile to the lowest possible value was divided into four equal parts in order to obtain the remaining class boundaries. The resulting High/Good and Good/Moderate boundaries were compared to the boundaries proposed by GIGs and proved to be in line with those defined in the intercalibration exercise. The process of validation explained in the present paper, or similar ones, can be an important step forward.

All methods classified soft bottom benthic macrophytes (angiosperms, seaweeds) in several sensitivity groups following {{the concept that}} “anthropogenic pressure” (stress) drives the ecosystem from a pristine state, where seagrasses are dominant, to a degraded state, where opportunistic species and phytoplankton are dominant. While Greece and Italy assessed the species abundance as coverage (%) in the laboratory, France assessed the species abundance as cover (%) in the field. A database consisting of 105 taxa abundance and pressure data from 55 shallow (depth= 1 - 3 m) and vegetated (cover > 10 %) sites (14 in France, 20 in Greece, 20 in Italy) belonging to meso-, poly- and euhaline (salinity > 5 ‰) coastal lagoons, either confined or not confined, has been created. The 3 methods used a similar scale at biological (species), spatial (site) and temporal (one sampling per year during spring-summer) level, enabling a direct comparison of the 3 indices at biological community level. A common pressure index based on expert judgment was calculated. Multivariate analyses (MDS, Cluster) indicated no biogeographical differences across the Mediterranean Sea. SIMPER analyses confirmed that reference “benchmark” sites communities (pressure index ≤ 6) were characterized by the dominance of angiosperm species (Cymodocea nodosa= 49. 9 %, Ruppia cirrhosa= 35. 67 %, Zostera noltii= 10 %), while “borderline” communities between good and moderate ecological status were dominated by macroalgae-cyanobacteria in coexistence with angiosperms.

40|$|The {{assessment}} of water quality has changed markedly worldwide {{over the last}} years, especially in Europe due {{to the implementation of}} the Water Framework Directive. Fish was considered a key-element in this context and several fish-based multi-metric indices have been proposed. In this study, we propose a multi-metric index, the Estuarine Fish Assessment Index (EFAI), developed for Portuguese estuaries, designed for the overall {{assessment of}} transitional waters, which could also be applied at the water body level within an estuary. The EFAI integrates seven metrics: species richness, percentage of marine migrants, number of species and abundance of estuarine resident species, number of species and abundance of piscivorous species, status of diadromous species, status of introduced species and status of disturbance sensitive species. Fish sampling surveys were conducted in 2006, 2009 and 2010, using beam trawl, in 13 estuarine systems along the Portuguese coast. Most of the metrics presented a high variability among the transitional systems surveyed. According to the EFAI values, Portuguese estuaries presented a "Good" water quality status (except the Douro in a particular year). The assessments in different years were generally concordant, with a few exceptions. The relationship between the EFAI and the Anthropogenic Pressure Index (API) was not significant, but a negative and significant correlation was registered between the EFAI and the expert judgement pressure index, at both estuary and water body level. The ordination analysis performed to evaluate similarities among North-East Atlantic <b>Geographical</b> <b>Intercalibration</b> <b>Group</b> (NEAGIG) fish-based indices put in evidence four main groups: the French index, since it is substantially different from all the other indices (uses only four metrics based on densities); indices from Ireland, United Kingdom and Spain (Asturias and Cantabria); the Dutch and German indices; and the indices of Belgium.

40|$|Summary. Since 2005, {{a yearly}} {{monitoring}} of macroalgae according to national WFDregulations (Water Framework Directive) has been performed. Quantitative abundance values {{were obtained by}} means of quadrat sampling within a fixed grid of stations in the northern intertidal (in the following text: N-Watt) of the northern coast of Helgoland (Bartsch et al. 2005, MMH-Report 2; Schubert et al. 2007, MMH-Report 5). Concomitantly, species richness was recorded based on the RSL-method (Wells et al. 2007), and diving transects provided sublittoral data on macroalgal abundance and depth limits since 2007. All data serve to fulfil the requirements for the component ‘Macrophytes’ within the biological package of the European WFD {{with respect to the}} coastal water body N 5 at Helgoland (Kuhlenkamp et al. 2009 a, MMH-Report 12). For this purpose, the specifically developed ‘Helgoland Phytobenthic Index’ (HPI) provides comprehensive calculations in a modular format. This leads to the normalised ecological values necessary to establish the final Ecological Quality Ratio (EQR) used for reporting to the EU (Kuhlenkamp & Bartsch 2008, MMH-Report 9; Kuhlenkamp et al. 2009 a, b, MMH-Reports 12 and 13). During the present study, sampling of the fixed grid in the N-Watt was undertaken in July 2010 and February 2011 similarly to the years before. In parallel, quadrat measurements along an additional eulittoral transect implemented by LLUR (LANU-SH) were performed in summer 2010 and results were compiled according to previous reports (Schubert 2007, MMH-Report 6; Kuhlenkamp et al. 2009 b, MMH-Report 12). If required, metric values were calculated for reporting to the national and international authorities in compliance with WFD regulations. In the following the results obtained are described and their seasonal variation depicted in detailed graphs. Descriptions of the methods have been given in Kuhlenkamp et al. (2009 b, MMH-Report 13).

40|$|The {{intercalibration}} (IC) {{exercise is}} a key element in the implementation of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) in Europe. Its focus lies on the harmonization of national classification methods to guarantee a common understanding of Good Ecological Status' in surface waters. This article defines reference conditions and sets class boundaries for deep (mean depth [15 m, IC lake type L-AL 3) and moderately deep (mean depth 315 m, IC lake type L-AL 4) Alpine lakes [0. 5 km 2. Data were collated from each of the five EU member states included in the Alpine <b>Geographical</b> <b>Intercalibration</b> <b>Group</b> (Alpine GIG: Austria, France, Germany, Italy and Slovenia). Hydro-morphological, chemical and biological data from 161 sites (sampling stations) in 144 Alpine lakes over a period of seven decades were collated in a database. Based on a set of reference criteria, 18 L-AL 3 and 13 L-AL 4 reference sites were selected. Reference conditions were defined using a combined approach, based on historical, paleolimnological and monitoring data in conjunction with trophic modelling and expert judgement. Reference values and class boundaries were set for annual mean total biomass (biovolume), and then derived for annual mean chlorophyll-a using a regression between the two parameters. In order to allow for geographical differences within the Alpine GIG and to facilitate the inclusion of the broadly defined common IC types and national lake types, ranges were defined for each reference value. Range of reference values are 0. 2 0. 3 mg l- 1 (L-AL 3) and 0. 50. 7 mg l- 1 (L-AL 4) for total biovolume and 1. 51. 9 lg l- 1 (L-AL 3) and 2. 7 3. 3 lg l- 1 (L-AL 4) for chlorophyll-a. Depending on lake type and variable, the ecological quality ratios (EQR) for setting the class boundaries lie between 0. 60 and 0. 75 for the high/good class boundary and between 0. 25 and 0. 41 for the good/moderate class boundary.

40|$|One of the {{objectives}} of the European Water Framework Directive (WFD; EU, 2000) is to attain a good status for all surface waters in the European Union by the end of 2015. To this end, the ecological status of natural surface waters should be assessed, based on a number of biological quality elements which depend on the category of surface water (rivers, lakes, transitional waters or coastal waters). For each of these elements, member states must choose or develop a classification method, taking into account a set of parameters depending on the quality element and on the surface water category (EU, 2000). The assessment system must be differentiated among the types of water bodies within a category. The method must be in agreement with an Ecological Quality Ratio (EQR) showing relative proportion of the index compared to the reference conditions. This EQR ranges from zero to one, respectively corresponding to a bad and a very good ecological status. This interval is divided into five classes reflecting bad, poor, moderate, good and high ecological status (EU, 2000). For the categories rivers and lakes, one of the relevant biological quality elements is the “benthic invertebrate fauna” (EU, 2000), commonly referred to as macroinvertebrates. For this quality element, the parameters “taxonomic composition and abundance”, “ratio of disturbance sensitive to insensitive taxa” and “diversity” should be taken into account. In Flanders, Belgium, the Belgian Biotic Index (BBI; De Pauw and Vanhooren, 1983), based on macroinvertebrates, has been applied in routine monitoring schemes by the Flemish Environment Agency (VMM) since 1989, confirming the reliability and robustness of this biological quality index. However, with respect to the application of this index for rivers and lakes within a WFD context, not all technical requirements are met by the BBI. The abundance, {{which is one of the}} relevant parameters imposed by the WFD, is not taken into account in the BBI calculation, and this index is not explicitly based on a reference condition approach. Furthermore, it is not a type-specific method, in other words, all types of rivers are evaluated by means of the same criteria, and the BBI was intended as an assessment system for watercourses only, not for lakes (De Pauw and Vanhooren, 1983). Two general problems are identified that are associated with taxonomic resolution in water quality assessment based on macroinvertebrates. These are explored by means of analysis of the BBI index calculation method. A first difficulty is caused by possible changes in taxonomy over time, giving rise to inconsistencies in index calculation. A second problem is due to the introduction of exotic species. Both problems can introduce a bias in calculation of the index. To avoid this problem in future assessment methods, it is proposed to use a taxa list to which no changes are made except for the addition of newly introduced exotic species. Since the BBI does not meet all the requirements of the WFD, a new index, the Multimetric Macroinvertebrate Index Flanders (MMIF) for assessing rivers and lakes is proposed. This index is developed using the database of macroinvertebrate samples provided by the VMM. The MMIF is calculated based on macroinvertebrate community data obtained using the same sampling and identification procedure as the BBI. The index calculation is a type-specific multimetric system based on five equally weighted metrics, which are taxa richness, number of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and/or Trichoptera taxa, number of other sensitive taxa, the Shannon-Wiener diversity index, and the mean tolerance score. The final index value is expressed as an EQR ranging from zero for bad status to one for high status. The MMIF combines the robustness of the BBI and the long-term experience in Flanders with the flexibility of multimetric indices, while at the same time taking into account the technical requirements of the WFD. To ensure that boundary values for the national biological assessment methods are comparable along all member states in Europe, regional intercalibration exercises were envisaged by the WFD for each quality element and for each category of water body. For river macroinvertebrates, the relevant regional intercalibration exercise for Flanders was coordinated by the so-called Central-Baltic <b>Geographical</b> <b>Intercalibration</b> <b>Group</b> (CB-GIG, 2006). Flanders contributed to this intercalibration exercise, using VMM sampling data, in order to compare the Flemish boundary values to those of the other participating countries and regions and, if necessary, to adjust them to ensure inclusion in the intercalibration decision of the European Commission (EU, 2007). This exercise for river macroinvertebrates essentially consisted in a regression of each participating member states’ national method against a common, generally applicable index. This regression is carried out separately by each member state using a national dataset. Based on the obtained regression equation, each country converts its national boundary values into values on the scale of the common index for subsequent comparison. The mean value of the converted national boundaries is calculated and the rescaled national boundaries should be within a certain range of this mean value in order to be considered as comparable (CB-GIG, 2006). Two major problems emerged with regard to the Flemish contribution. First, the derivation of reference values for the metrics of the common index was not possible using field data because no reference sites are present in Flanders. To overcome this problem, an alternative and transparent way of deriving reference values was used in order to have reference values comparable to those of the other member states (Gabriels, 2007). The second problem concerned the boundary values, which clearly fell below the comparability interval. Therefore, alternative boundary values were proposed. This adjustment of the MMIF class boundaries for rivers was formally accepted by the steering <b>group</b> of the <b>intercalibration</b> exercise (CB-GIG, 2007). The adjusted values were adopted in the draft version of the intercalibration decision of the European Commission (EU, 2007), of which the official publication is foreseen for the end of 2007...|$|R

40|$|This work summarises the Intercalibration Exercise (IE) {{required}} for the Common Implementation Strategy of the Water Framework Directive (WFD; 2000 / 60 /EC) that {{was carried out in}} Portugal, and applied to a coastal region. The WFD aims to achieve good ec ological status for all waters in the European Community by 2015. The Ecological Status of a water body is determined us ing a range of Hydromorphological and Physico-Chemical Quality Elements as well Biological Quality Elements (BQE). In coastal waters, the Biological Elements include Phytoplankton, Other Aquatic Flora and Benthic Inverteb rate Fauna. Good cooperation with the other Member States allowed the IE to proceed without a complete da ta set, and Portugal was ab le to intercalibrate and harmonise methods within the North Ea st Atlantic Geographica l <b>Intercalibration</b> <b>Group</b> for most of the BQE. The appropriate metrics and corre sponding methods were agreed under the framework of the RECITAL (Reference Conditions and Intercalibra tion) project, funded by the Port uguese Water Institu te, INAG. Some preliminary sampling was undertaken, but not su fficient to establish the Reference Conditions. The study area was a coastal lagoon {{in the southern part of}} Portugal. The focus was on the Phytoplankton Quality Element, but other BQE were also taken into account. Two sampli ng stations in Ria Formosa coastal lagoon were considered in this exercise: Ramalhete a nd Ponte. The metrics adopted by the <b>Intercalibration</b> Exercise <b>groups</b> were applied enabli ng the classification for the two sta tions of Good/High Status for the majority of the BQE parameters...|$|R

The following year, the <b>group</b> <b>gigged</b> intensively throughout southern Ontario and also completed sessions for an album at RCA Recording Studios in Toronto with producer George Semkiw, which was released in October 1970. That same month, the band returned to Toronto’s live scene with a show at the Night Owl, followed by an appearance at Ryerson Great Hall alongside Leigh Ashford on November 6, 1970.|$|R

40|$|Legislation in Europe {{has been}} adopted to {{determine}} and improve the ecological integrity of inland and coastal waters. Assessment is based on four biotic groups, including benthic macroinvertebrate communities. For lakes, benthic invertebrates have been recognised {{as one of the}} most difficult organism groups to use in ecological assessment, and hitherto their use in ecological assessment has been limited. In this study, we review and intercalibrate 13 benthic invertebrate-based tools across Europe. These assessment tools address different human impacts: acidification (3 methods), eutrophication (3 methods), morphological alterations (2 methods), and a combination of the last two (5 methods). For intercalibration, the methods were <b>grouped</b> into four <b>intercalibration</b> <b>groups,</b> according to the habitat sampled and putative pressure. Boundaries of the ‘good ecological status’ were compared and harmonised using direct or indirect comparison approaches. To enable indirect comparison of the methods, three common pressure indices and two common biological multimetric indices were developed for larger geographical areas. Additionally, we identified the best-performing methods based on their responsiveness to different human impacts. Based on these experiences, we provide practical recommendations for the development and harmonization of benthic invertebrate assessment methods in lakes and similar habitats. JRC.
