40|$|This {{study was}} {{completed}} using {{a sample of}} online students at a university in North Texas. The study explored leadership style as a predictor in students' ratings of overall teaching effectiveness, learning, breadth, <b>examinations,</b> <b>and</b> assignments. A Pearson product-moment correlation was conducted to examine the inter-correlations between the leadership styles, the inter-correlations between the four SEEQ factors of Learning, Breadth, <b>Examinations,</b> <b>and</b> Assignments, {{and the relationship between}} the four SEEQ factors and the leadership styles. Transformational leadership was highly correlated with transactional leadership and passive avoidant leadership style was negatively correlated with transactional leadership and transformational leadership. The inter-correlation of the SEEQ factors showed that the four factors were highly correlated. Learning and transformational leadership were positively correlated. Breadth and transformational leadership were positively correlated. <b>Examinations</b> <b>and</b> transformational leadership were positively correlated. Assignments and transformational leadership were positively correlated. Breadth and transactional leadership were positively correlated. <b>Examinations</b> <b>and</b> transactional leadership were positively correlated. Assignments and transactional leadership were positively correlated. Passive Avoidant leadership negatively correlated with all four dimensions of the SEEQ. Multiple regression indicated that transformational leadership was a predictor all 4 dimensions – Learning, Breadth, <b>Examinations,</b> <b>and</b> Assignments. Transactional leadership was a predictor for Breadth <b>and</b> <b>Examinations.</b> Student age was a predictor for three dimensions of the SEEQ – Learning, <b>Examinations,</b> <b>and</b> Assignments...|$|R

5|$|Alcoholic {{beverage}} and {{the process}} of fermentation: The earliest archaeological evidence of fermentation and the consumption of alcoholic beverages was discovered in neolithic China dating from 7000–6600 BC. <b>Examination</b> <b>and</b> analysis of ancient pottery jars from the neolithic village of Jiahu in Henan province in northern China revealed fermented residue left behind by the alcoholic beverages they once contained. According to {{a study published in the}} Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, chemical analysis of the residue revealed that the fermented drink was made from fruit, rice and honey. Elsewhere in the world, fermented beverages have been found dating from 6000 BC in Georgia, 3150 BC in ancient Egypt, 3000 BC in Babylon, 2000 BC in pre-Hispanic Mexico, and 1500 BC in Sudan.|$|E

In 1861, he achieved First Class level in the matriculation <b>examination</b> <b>and</b> then attended University College, London. However, he left later that year to work in his father's business, along with his brother, Henry. He studied music during this time and composed some pieces, which he dedicated to the actress Kate Terry. He also acted in amateur theatricals.|$|E

He carried out a very thorough <b>examination</b> <b>and</b> made a photographic record of all visible monuments, carried out some minor excavations, made paper and plaster molds of the hieroglyphic inscriptions and surveyed the principal sculptures; these molds were then shipped to the Victoria and Albert Museum, with casts being transferred to the British Museum.|$|E
