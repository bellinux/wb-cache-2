5|$|Madonna looks both {{older and}} younger than she does in the photos and the videos: a little more lined and {{possibly}} tired, but also less mature and grand. Her manner is quite teenaged, not femme fatale. She seems up for mischief, and yet quite conscious of her power. At the same time, her very frankness is almost innocent. These combinations are odd, and they give her {{the air of a}} prematurely wise child. Her current style is 1930s Hollywood meets early 1970s flash: Jean Harlow and Angie Bowie. She is not bewitching, but is certainly beautiful. She wears the nose stud that so troubled Norman Mailer in a recent interview. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> her in the street, you'd think: she looks like a girl who looks a bit like Madonna.|$|E
25|$|Feeling of Knowing (FOK) {{judgments}} {{refer to}} the predictions {{of being able to}} retrieve specific information an individual makes, regarding his or her knowledge for a specific subject, more specifically whether that knowledge exists within memory. These judgments are made either prior to the memory target being found or following a failed attempt to locate the target. Consequently, FOK judgments focus not on the actual answer to a question, but rather on whether an individual predicts that he or she does or does not know the answer (high and low FOK ratings respectively). FOK judgments can also be made regarding the likelihood of remembering information later on and have proven to give fairly accurate indications of future memory. An example of FOK is if you can't remember the answer when someone asks you what city you're traveling to, but you feel that you would recognize the name <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> it on a map of the country.|$|E
500|$|Muhammad {{ordered the}} Muslim archers to never under any {{circumstances}} leave their positions on the hill unless ordered {{to do so by}} him only, he made this order very clear by uttering these words to the archers, [...] "If you saw us prevail and start to take spoils, do not come to assist us. And <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> us get vanquished and birds eat from our heads, do not come to assist us." ...|$|E

500|$|Throughout {{the course}} of the show, Val was often played up as the good girl character. When asked about whether Val was a weak character, Van Ark said: [...] "God, no. No she wasn’t. For the very reason that she went through so much and landed on both feet. She was strong in a {{realistic}} kind of way. I do remember that TV Guide did a quote that the three of us can be compared to Earth, Wind and Fire. Michele was the Earth, I was the Wind and Donna was the Fire. I think that really captured it." [...] Van Ark was later asked about who she saw Val as today. She said, [...] "Of course the dysfunctional elements would come out. Why even bother otherwise? But of course they would persevere and still be together after all. I think Valene was headed to, and my sister’s like this, after years of doing everything for her husband and her children, Valene was going to further her achievements in the professional world. I think <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> Valene today she’d be much more accomplished as a writer and would be very successful overall." [...] The actress also said: ...|$|E
500|$|According to John Brousseau, the bad {{publicity}} led to {{reforms of the}} Hole. Its inmates were allowed to sleep in proper beds in the [...] "Berthing" [...] quarters elsewhere in the compound. Brousseau describes their new seven-days-a-week routine starting when [...] "they got up, showered, {{then went to the}} dining hall at 9:30. They had 30 minutes for breakfast. Then they walked up to the Hole. They sat down at desks. I have no clue what work they did. They worked until 12:30 or 1 pm. Then they were marched back to the dining hall and had 30 minutes for lunch. Then they were marched back to the Hole and were there until 6 pm." [...] After a 30-minute dinner, they were taken to the study hall and stayed there [...] "for two and a half hours, until about 9:30. Then they went to the Hole again to wrap up their day. At 11 or midnight, they'd get marched back to Berthing." [...] Some of the restrictions on contacting people outside the Hole were also said to have been eased. However, other Church staff were still encouraged to avoid contact with the inmates: [...] "You didn't talk to them, you looked the other way, you'd leave the area <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> them, it's like the black plague." [...] Brousseau commented: [...] "You stayed away from these people. They're considered the worst of the worst." ...|$|E
500|$|On 18 March 1941, the 2/3rd Battalion sailed from Alexandria aboard HMS Gloucester, {{arriving}} in Greece and {{landing in the}} port of Piraeus on the following day, after a 22-hour voyage during which their convoy had been attacked numerous times by Axis aircraft. After {{the invasion of the}} country on 6 April, they were moved north to attempt to turn back the German forces. The following day they occupied Veria, and on 12 April the 6th Division was grouped together with the 2nd New Zealand Division and a lone British brigade to form an Anzac Corps. This formation did not last long, however, as the Greek government requested Allied forces withdraw from Greece on 16 April before ceasing organised resistance on 18 April. Due to a series of withdrawals elsewhere, the battalion was forced to pull back from its positions at Veria and did not come into contact with the Germans until 18 April when they attempted to block passage of the Tempe Gorge. Fighting alongside the 2/2nd Battalion and New Zealanders, the rearguard action was successful and enabled the Allies to withdraw to the south. Brigadier Arthur Allen, commander of the 16th Brigade, later wrote of this encounter: [...] "it was a fantastic battle. Everyone was on top, with no time to dig in, and all in the front line, including artillery, Bren carriers and infantry, as well as headquarters, with transport only yards in the rear. Some confusion could be expected in the circumstances, with every weapon firing and aircraft almost continually strafing from above. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> it in the cinema you would say the author had never seen battle." ...|$|E
