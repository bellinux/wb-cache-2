40|$|Abstract This paper aims at {{presenting}} in some depth the “Leurré. com ” {{project and}} its first results. The project aims at deploying so-called low level interaction honeypot platforms {{all over the}} world to collect in a centralized database a set of information amenable to the analysis of today’s Internet threats. At the time of this writing, around two dozens platforms have been deployed in the five continents. The paper offers some insight into the findings that can be derived from such data set. More importantly, the design and the structure of the repository are presented and justified by means of several examples that highlight the simplicity and efficiency of extracting useful information out of it. We explain why such low cost, largely distributed system represents an important, foundational element, towards the building of <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
30|$|And from {{experience}} of the last 20  years, we – as a global community - have {{learned a great deal}} about the value of: i) understanding and assessing vulnerability and decision support needs on a scale defined by the nature of the decision question; ii) listening to and valuing the input of stakeholders in our science; iii) enhancing the local/national/regional capacity to collect and interpret their own data and applications tools; and iv) the management of these types of complex programs. As we look toward the future, there are many opportunities on the horizon, including expanding predictability to include a seamless suite of products covering multiple timescales (across weather and climate, including sub-seasonal and multi-decadal); engaging stakeholders and developing usable information and capacity in sectors such as energy planning, private sector decisions, development and adaptation; and increasing the capacity and efficacy of <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R

The way in which these three essentially different systems have been put together within ENSEMBLE is presented. Moreover the uniqueness of the ENSEMBLE system in terms of versatility, simplicity in the use and importance of the information provided is demonstrated. It is also shown that the system can serve a number of different scopes in the realm of atmospheric modeling beside nuclear emergencies, such as air quality threaten due to accidental releases or natural hazards. Among the latest developments the applicability of the system to release cases that go beyond the long range but that can span from the short to the global scale has been demonstrated and the possibility of deploying the computational domain anywhere in the world.

40|$|Extreme coastal storms have a {{destructive}} impact on coastal areas and directly affect {{people living in}} the coastal zone, being this emphasized by recent events (e. g. Katrina, Xynthia) which reminded the world of the vulnerability of coastal areas. The economic constraints and the increasing vulnerability of coastal areas (due to sea level rise and to increased occupation) make it impossible to continue with a coastal zone management strategy based solely on engineering schemes to protect vulnerable coastal areas across Europe. Development tools and methods that improve today’s forecasting, prediction and <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> capabilities in order to improve the assessment of coastal vulnerability and risks are strongly needed and should be part of future prevention, mitigation and preparedness measures. Within the MICORE project online operational storm <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> systems (CEWSs) using open-source models and tools for reliable predictions of the morphological impact of marine storm events were developed and demonstrated.

30|$|Although {{the brief}} review of the Yokohama Strategy in the first pages of the HFA reiterates the {{importance}} of “involving people {{in all aspects of}} DRR in their own local communities” (UNISDR 2005, p. 2), in the HFA there is a notable shift in language and tone. Reference to indigenous knowledge in the HFA is made in the context of incorporating it into top-down advisories. More emphasis is placed on considering cultural heritage in order to develop information appropriate for “target” audiences (UNISDR 2005, p. 9) rather than acknowledging and respecting local circumstances and understandings. HFA, of course, includes references to indigenous and traditional knowledge, but the main motivation beyond these allusions {{does not appear to be}} because of local knowledge’s own value for DRR as was the case in the Yokohama Strategy.

40|$|Iceland {{has been}} {{subjected}} to destructive earthquakes and volcanic eruptions throughout history. Such events are often preceded by changes in earthquake activity over varying timescales. Although most seismicity is confined to micro-earthquakes, large earthquakes have occurred within populated regions. Following the most recent hazardous earthquakes in 2000, the Icelandic Meteorological Office (IMO) developed an <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> and <b>information</b> <b>system</b> (EWIS) Web-site for viewing near-real-time seismicity in Iceland. Here we assess Web-site usage data in relation to earthquake activity, as recorded by the South Iceland Lowland (SIL) seismic network. Between March 2005 and May 2006 the SIL seismic network recorded 12, 583 earthquakes. During this period, the EWIS Web-site logged a daily median of 91 visits. The largest onshore event (ML 4. 2) struck 20 km from Reykjavik on 06 March 2006 and was followed by an immediate, upsurge in usage resulting in a total of 1, 173 unique visits to the Web-site. The greatest cluster of large (≥ML 3) events occurred 300 km offshore from Reykjavík in May 2005. Within this swarm, 9 earthquakes ≥ML 3 were detected on 11 May 2005, resulting in the release of a media bulletin by IMO. During the swarm, and following the media bulletin, the EWIS Web-site logged 1, 234 unique visits gradually throughout the day. In summary, the data reveal a spatial and temporal relationship between Web-site usage and earthquake activity. The EWIS Web-site is accessed immediately after the occurrence of a local earthquake, whereas distant, unfelt earthquakes generate gradual interest prompted by media bulletins and, possibly, other contributing factors. We conclude that the Internet is a useful tool for displaying seismic information in near-real-time, which has the capacity to help increase public awareness of natural hazards. 20 page(s...|$|R

40|$|As food {{security}} refers to people’s ability to access food, it {{is rooted in}} the economy of the country and should be considered as integral to the national development agenda. This is more so for the developing countries, which also manifest high levels of food insecurity, particularly in Africa. Paradoxically it is these low-income, food deficit countries (LIFDCs) that also experience high levels of conflict, resulting in complex emergencies. These countries need to adopt well-planned short-, medium- and longterm measures to improve their {{food security}} situation.

To be effective, the EWFIS should use data spanning the entire food chain, i. e. meteorological data, remote sensing imageries, agricultural statistics, commodity prices, nutritional anthropometry and food balance sheets. EWFIS is useful, not only for monitoring the food security situation to detect areas and segments of the population that are facing deteriorating food security, but also for providing relevant data (e. g. baseline data, vulnerability maps, etc.) needed for longer-term planning to move the affected populations from vulnerability to sustainable development...|$|R
40|$|The current paper {{discusses}} Q 1 {{the topic}} of marine storm impact along European coastlines, presenting results from two FP 7 Projects currently focusing on this topic, one working on the physical aspects of the problem (MICORE) {{and the other one}} on the socio-economic implications (ConHaz). The MICORE Project aims to provide on-line predictions of storm-related physical hazards (hydrodynamicaswellasmorphodynamic). The ConHazProjectaddresses thesocio-economic implications should these (or other) hazards actually materialize. Together these projects aim to deliver crucial information for emergency response efforts, while realizing the practical limitations for information processing and dissemination during crisis situations. The MICORE Project has developed and demonstrated on-line tools for reliable predictions of the morphological impact of marine storm events in support of civil protection mitigation strategies. The project specifically targeted the development of <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> and <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> to support short term emergency response in case of an extreme storm event. The current paper discusses in detail the outcome of an activity of databasing historical storm data. No clear changes in storminess were observed, except for some storm proxies (e. g. surges) and only at some locations (e. g. northern Adriatic, southern Baltic, etc.). The ConHaz Project undertook a desktop study of the methods normally used for evaluating the impact of marine storms and the associated coastal hazards considering direct costs, costs due to disruption of production processes, indirect costs, intangible costs, and costs of adaptation and mitigation measures. Several methods for cost estimation were reviewed. From the review it emerged that normally end-users only evaluate direct costs after the storms, while the cost of adaptation and mitigation measures is only done strategically in the context of Integrated Coastal Zone Management plans. As there is no standardized method for cost evaluations in this field, it is suggested that clear guidelines should be produced on the basis of simplicity for use by end-users. The integration between historical databases of the physical parameters of storms and detailed cost evaluation information would support the development of a knowledge background in end-users and justify the development of adaptation strategies...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} volcanic risk and the tourism sector in southern Iceland and the complex challenge emergency management officials face in developing effective volcanic risk mitigation strategies. An <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> system and emergency response procedures were developed for communities surrounding Katla, the volcano underlying the Mýrdalsjökull ice cap. However, prior to and during the 2007 tourist season these mitigation efforts were not effectively communicated to stakeholders located in the tourist destination of Þórsmörk despite its location within the hazard zone of Katla. The hazard zone represents the potential extent of a catastrophic jökulhlaup (glacial outburst flood). Furthermore, volcanic risk mitigation efforts in Þórsmörk were based solely on information derived from physical investigations of volcanic hazards. They did not consider the human dimension of risk. In order to address this gap and provide support to current risk mitigation efforts, questionnaire surveys were used to investigate tourists' and tourism employees' hazard knowledge, risk perception, adoption of personal preparedness measures, predicted behaviour if faced with a Katla eruption and views on education. Results indicate that tourists lack hazard knowledge {{and they do not}} adopt preparedness measures to deal with the consequences of an eruption. Despite a high level of risk perception, tourism employees lack knowledge about the <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> system and emergency response procedures. Results show that tourists are positive about receiving information concerning Katla and its hazards and therefore, the reticence of tourism employees with respect to disseminating hazard information is unjustified. In order to improve the tourism sector's collective capacity to positively respond during a future eruption, recommendations are made to ensure adequate dissemination of hazard, risk and emergency response information. Most importantly education campaigns should focus on: (a) increasing tourists' knowledge of Katla, jökulhlaup and other volcanic hazards and (b) increasing tourist and employee awareness of the <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> and <b>information</b> <b>system</b> and appropriate behavioural response if a warning is issued. Further, tourism employees should be required to participate in emergency training and evacuation exercises annually. These efforts are timely given that Katla is expected to erupt in the near future and international tourism is an expanding industry in Þórsmörk. 16 page(s...|$|R

Between 1970 and 1982, only Malawi and Swaziland have shown a per capita increase in food production. Some countries, such as Zimbabwe and Zambia, are able to export surplus maize thanks to the use of HYVs and better production prices. They are thus headed in the right direction but still import increasing quantities of other foodstuffs. Coordinated by Zimbabwe, a project on food security has been developed to encourage regional programmes involving: - technical assistance - <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> - <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> - inventories of agricultural resources - food reserves - programmes to reduce post-harvest losses - food processing technology - food marketing infrastructure - food aid - recruitment of technical staff for agriculture departments - seed production and distribution programmes, and - irrigation improvement and management plans.
