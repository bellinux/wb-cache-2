5|$|Initially making only {{tentative}} forays onto land, tetrapods {{adapted to}} terrestrial environments {{over time and}} spent longer periods away from the water. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> the adults started {{to spend some time}} on land (as the skeletal modifications in early tetrapods such as Ichthyostega suggests) to bask in the sun close to the water's edge, while otherwise being mostly aquatic.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, William {{continued}} his advancement in the kingdom. In 1169 he visited Rome, possibly to answer accusations made against him by Archbishop Frederick, although if so, {{the charge is}} unknown. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> while Frederick was away on a diplomatic mission in Europe, a problem within the diocese forced William to seek the archbishop's assistance.|$|E
5|$|Shortly afterwards, around 5 p.m., Wick's Bf 109 E-4 (Werknummer 5344 — factory number) {{was shot}} down, {{probably}} by twelve–victory ace Flight Lieutenant John Dundas of No. 609 Squadron, though <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> Wick {{fell victim to}} Pilot Officer Eric Marrs; Polish pilot Zygmunt Klein of 234 Squadron may have also scored hits on Wick's aircraft; he was also shot down and killed during the battle.|$|E

5|$|The Mercians, {{who participated}} in Edwin's defeat in 633, seem to have {{presented}} an obstacle to Oswald's authority south of the Humber, {{although it has been}} generally thought that Oswald dominated Mercia to some degree after Heavenfield. It may have been to appease Oswald that Penda had Eadfrith, a captured son of Edwin (and thus a dynastic rival of Oswald), killed, although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> Penda had his own motives for the killing.|$|E
5|$|The monarchy {{was also}} dynastic: the princes {{were to be}} elected by boyars from {{among the members of}} the ruling family, the Basarabs. The boyars were the members of the privileged landed aristocracy. However, the origin of the Romanian boyar class is problematic: it may have evolved {{naturally}} from the heads of the Vlach villages and communities, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> the princes created it by granting privileges to certain favored persons.|$|E
5|$|The rapid {{disappearance}} of the Rodrigues rail may {{have been caused by}} introduced cats, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> deforestation by tortoise hunters may have contributed significantly; from 1735, these hunters burned off forests so they could collect giant Cylindraspis tortoises for their meat and oil. The French astronomer Alexandre Guy Pingré, who visited Rodrigues to observe the 1761 transit of Venus, wrote in 1763 that the bird was extinct by the time of his visit.|$|E

5|$|The way the {{conflict}} is described, by counting only two casualties, may point {{that there was a}} duel between the nobles of the two sides. However, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> the dead among the common soldiers were not considered important to mention. Although the outcome of the battle remained unresolved, Attarsiya decided to withdraw his troops from the battlefield. After his retreat from the Anatolian mainland, Madduwatta was again installed as a Hittite vassal in the region.|$|E
5|$|A 2004 study {{into the}} effect of The Daily Show on viewers' attitudes found that {{participants}} had a more negative opinion of both President Bush and then Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry. Participants also expressed more cynical views of the electoral system and news media. Political scientists Jody Baumgartner and Jonathan Morris, who conducted the study, state {{that it is not}} clear how such cynicism would affect the political behavior of the show's viewers. While disillusionment and negative perceptions of the presidential candidates could discourage watchers from voting, Baumgartner and Morris say <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> discontent could prompt greater involvement and that by following the show, viewers may potentially become more engaged and informed voters, with a broader political knowledge.|$|E
5|$|Ain't meaning didn't {{is widely}} {{considered}} a feature unique to African American Vernacular English, although {{it can be found}} in some dialects of Caribbean English as well. It may function not as a true variant of didn't, but as a creole-like tense-neutral negator (sometimes termed generic ain't). Its origin may have been due to approximation when early African Americans acquired English as a second language; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> early African Americans inherited this variation from colonial European-Americans, and later kept the variation when it largely passed out of wider usage. Ain't is rarely attested for the present-tense constructions do not or does not.|$|E

5|$|Asser's prose {{style has}} been criticised for weak syntax, stylistic pretensions, and garbled exposition. His {{frequent}} use of archaic and unusual words gives his prose a baroque flavour that is common in Insular Latin authors of the period. He uses several words that are peculiar to Frankish Latin sources. This has led to speculation that he was educated at least partly in Francia, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> he acquired this vocabulary from Frankish scholars he associated with at court, such as Grimbald.|$|E
5|$|Based {{upon the}} {{structure}} of the bill, {{it has been suggested that}} this unique bill was used as a pincer, with the tips of both mandibles touching. The hookbill could have used this movement to pluck fruits or flowers for consumption, or it may have been used to extract snails from their shells. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> the bird could have crushed a snail shell between its mandibles and then used its tongue to ingest the meat and expel the shell out of the open sides of the beak.|$|E
5|$|Danish workers {{involved}} in the clean-up operation claimed long-term health problems resulted from their exposure to the radiation. Although they did not work at Camp Hunziker, the Danes worked at the Tank Farm where the contaminated ice was collected, in the port where the contaminated debris was shipped from, and they also serviced the vehicles used in the clean-up. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> they were exposed to radiation in the local atmosphere. Many of the workers surveyed {{in the years following}} Project Crested Ice reported health problems. A 1995 survey found 410 deaths by cancers out of a sample of 1,500 workers.|$|E

5|$|Day {{wished for}} the girls to be {{isolated}} from external influences while he educated them so, {{at the beginning of}} November 1769, he decided to move them to France. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> he did this to protect himself from the legal ramifications of his experiment, as well as societal gossip. The trio travelled over 600 miles to Avignon, renting a house in le quartier des fusteries. The girls could speak no French and Day employed no English-speaking servants, to be sure that he would be the only person to influence them.|$|E
5|$|Edmund {{was born}} either in 1015, 1016 or 1017. Edmund's mother was {{probably}} Ealdgyth, Edmund Ironside's wife; {{it is possible}} that she was only his stepmother, as the king's death in November 1016 left space of only one year for two children to be born. Although {{there is a possibility that}} Edmund was older than his brother, later known as Edward the Exile, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> they were twins. At the time, it was customary for posthumous sons to bear their father's name; thus, Edmund could have been the younger, posthumous son.|$|E

Ten crew members are known to have survived, all of whom returned to Japan. The total number of casualties is estimated at 1,620 sailors. Fusō was removed from the navy list on 31 August 1945.|$|E
