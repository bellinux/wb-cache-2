On the other hand, in the second part of the study, which covers the post-global financial recession period, the <b>independent</b> <b>float</b> regime of exchange rate has been operating. Therefore, the second part of the analysis excludes the global financial recession period for a number of reasons. During this recession, the monetary policies of numerous countries were deviated to a crisis management trail. Although the crisis impacted the national macroeconomic policies over short period, the stability of the financial system was not affected. Unlike some European countries, no banks in Sri Lanka collapsed. One of the important reasons for the minimal impact of the crisis is the capital account not being fully liberalized. However, some short-term foreign investments were withdrawn. The foreign funds invested in Sri Lankan Treasury bills and long-term bonds were also withdrawn. To rescue the economy from the impasse of the crisis, some policy measures were thus initiated, and the CBSL intervened on the foreign exchange market to prevent the depreciation of the national currency.|$|E

40|$|During the 90 s {{emerging}} markets {{have been hit}} by recurrent exchange rate crises. Almost all these countries shared a common characteristic: they adopted in previous years soft pegs, the so-called intermediate exchange rate regimes. International institutions and academic economists interpreted this intrinsic fragility of soft pegs {{as a consequence of}} the increasing international capital mobility. From this perspective, the exchange-rate regime is seen as constrained by the monetary policy trilemma, which imposes a stark trade-off among exchange stability, monetary independence, and capital market openness. Soft pegs seem incompatible with international financial integration. As a result, a new consensus appeared: the choice of domestic authorities is limited to corner solutions: hard pegs on the one side; <b>independent</b> <b>floating</b> on the other side.

40|$|IT is {{now more}} than a decade since the world {{abandoned}} the system of fixed but adjustable exchange rates which was the center-piece of the old Bretton Woods system. That system collapsed in 1973 with no official agreement on what was to replace it, and the major currencies were set afloat in world currency markets.

The new system, which some have called a "non-system", is characterized by a mix of exchange rate arrangements. Major currencies float relatively freely in world currency markets.

40|$|Although {{there seems}} to be a broad {{consensus}} among economists that purely floating or completely fixed exchange rates (the so-called corner solutions) are the only viable alternatives of exchange rate management, many countries do not behave according to this paradigm and adopt a strategy within the broad spectrum of exchange rate regimes that is limited by the two corner solutions. These intermediate regimes are characterized by significant foreign exchange market interventions of central banks and a certain degree of exchange rate flexibility. We develop a new empirical methodology that identifies three different forms of floating on the basis of a central bank's intervention activity: pure <b>floating</b> (no interventions), <b>independent</b> <b>floating</b> (exchange rate smoothing), and managed floating (exchange rate targeting). Our cross-country study shows that exchange rate targeting is at least as important as exchange rate smoothing. Subsequently we present a monetary policy framework in which central banks use the exchange rate as an operating target of monetary policy. We explain the mechanics of interventions and sterilization and we explain why a central bank has an interest in controlling simultaneously the exchange rate and the short-term interest rate.

Micro- and Nano-Electromechanical Systems (MEMS, NEMS) and micro-Electrocorticography now belong to the mainstay of neurophysiology, producing promising results in BCI applications, neurophysiological recordings and research. The miniaturization of recording and stimulation systems and the improvement of reliability and durability, decrease of neural tissue reactivity to implants, as well as increased fidelity of said systems are the current foci of this technology. Novel concepts have also begun to emerge such as nanoscale integrated circuits that communicate with the macroscopic environment, neuronal pattern nano-promotion, multiple biosensors that have been “wired” with piezoelectric nanomechanical resonators, or even “neural dust” consisting of 10 - 100 μm scale <b>independent</b> <b>floating</b> low-powered sensors.

40|$|The {{international}} capital market integration and currency crises {{of the last}} decade have renewed the debate on optimal exchange rate regimes. Research is mixed regarding what their effect has been on the system of exchange rate regimes and the anchor currencies at the centre of the system. The debate is complicated by growing empirical evidence that the de jure regimes announced by governments often differ from the de facto regimes that are actually applied. In this paper we divide the period 1990 - 2002 according to the major crises and use the generalized method of moments to identify the individual de facto regimes and relevant anchor currencies for each sub-period. We find that although intermediate regimes {{as a percentage of the}} overall database remained stable over the three periods, the type of peg and anchor currencies varied considerably. Pegs on a single currency fell from 62 % of the sample in the first period to 49 % in the second period, then rose to 66 % in the third period. Basket pegs rose from 33 % in the first period to 51 % in the second period and back to 34 % in the third period. <b>Independent</b> <b>floats</b> disappeared after the first period. When we group countries according to their access to capital markets, we find that all nine of the developed countries in the sample followed some type of intermediate regime for all three periods. We also find a trend towards hard pegs in the group of countries that has managed to increase its integration in the {{international capital}} markets. Our results also suggest that the US dollar remains the main anchor currency in the international financial system, even after the major currency crises and the rise of the euro.

40|$|The {{classical}} {{approach for}} signal conditioning individual resistance strain gages is to connect each installed gage with three lead wires {{to a set}} of three fixed completion resistors, all arranged electrically in a Wheatstone bridge circuit. An alternative approach for strain gage signal conditioning, sometimes called the Anderson loop, was developed at NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center. 1 This technique offers some significant advantages when used with the strain gage rosettes employed in experimental stress analysis. Invented 2 to eliminate the measurement uncertainties due to random electrical impedance variations in lead wires and connections found in harsh test environments, NASA's loop circuit approach delivers twice the equivalent bridge output level, and simplifies wiring, temperature compensation and data analysis as well. Circuitry The enabling technology for this technique is the dual-differential subtractor measurement circuit function defined in Fig. 1. As illustrated in eq. 1, a subtractor's output is the difference between two <b>independent</b> <b>floating</b> differential inputs. vout = A 1 v 1 – A 2 v 2 (1) The subtractor's two differential input voltages, v 1 and v 2, are processed by amplification factors A 1 and A 2, respectively, to yield an output voltage, vout. In a strain rosette application, amplification factors A 1 and A 2 are typically set to unity. Noise voltages rejected by this ideal subtractor arrangement include: all identical noise voltage components at the two inputs, the common-mode voltages, vcm 1 and vcm 2 at each differential input, and the interior-mode voltage, vim. Practical subtractors can be designed to operate with sub-microvolt stability and essentially no energy transfer with the strain gage circuitry they observe. The loop subtractors are typically connected in a Kelvin manner. That is, connected to sense only the voltage drop across each gage while carefully avoiding any voltage drops due to excitation current flowing through lead wires or connectors. v 1 v 2 vim vcm 1 vcm 2 vout v 1 v...|$|R
