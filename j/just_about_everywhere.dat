25|$|The 1982 Ford Sierra – {{replacement}} for the long-running and massively popular Cortina and Taunus models – was a style-setter {{at the time of}} its launch. Its ultramodern aerodynamic design was a world away from a boxy, sharp-edged Cortina, and it was massively popular <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>everywhere</b> it was sold. A series of updates kept it looking relatively fresh until it was replaced by the front-wheel drive Mondeo at the start of 1993.|$|E
25|$|The Central {{then turned}} to other {{carriers}} outside of the Northeast, particularly the Chesapeake & Ohio which controlled the Baltimore & Ohio and the Western Maryland. The Chesapeake & Ohio was a very profitable coal carrier that has expanded into the Midwest. The Central saw the C as the perfect merger partner. The C's coal {{would serve as a}} pillar of stability, while the Central's and B's network throughout the Midwest would add new business opportunities. On paper it was the perfect marriage. The NYC and the C/B complemented each other, whereas the NYC and PRR duplicated each other's efforts <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>everywhere.</b> Serious merger discussions were held between the NYC and the C, but those talks failed too when agreement could not be reached. With nowhere else to turn, the New York Central reluctantly restarted talks with the Pennsylvania in the early 1960s, which {{led to the creation of}} the Penn Central.|$|E
500|$|Shoe polish was to {{be found}} <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>everywhere</b> Allied troops ventured. American war {{correspondent}} Walter Graeber wrote for TIME magazine from the Tobruk trenches in 1942 that [...] "old tins of British-made Kiwi polish lay {{side by side with}} empty bottles of Chianti." [...] A story indicative of the rise in global significance of shoe polish is told by Jean (Gertrude) Williams, a New Zealander who lived in Japan during the Allied occupation straight after World War II. [...] American soldiers were then finding the dullness of their boots and shoes to be a handicap when trying to win the affections of Japanese women. U.S. military footwear of the time was produced in brown leather with the rough side out.|$|E

2500|$|Family First {{picked up}} 1.76 {{percent of the}} vote nationally. Steve Fielding, the lead {{candidate}} in Victoria, was successful in picking up the last Senate seat. Although he received a primary vote of only 1.88 percent (56,376 votes), he achieved the 14.3 percent quota required by a run of preferences including those from the Australian Labor Party. The typically apolitical psephologist Malcolm Mackerras stated [...] "The outlandish result occurred in Victoria in 2004 where the Family First party was able to gather tickets from <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>everywhere...</b> this is a fluke.

2500|$|Hughes put {{the full}} {{proposal}} to Caucus and Cabinet. He pulled {{out all the}} stops in the advocacy of his proposal, claiming that France {{was on the verge of}} collapse, Imperial forces were stretched to the limit, and Germany was winning the war <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>everywhere.</b> Furthermore, if the government could not take the steps necessary to win the war, then the public would elect an opposition who could. He claimed, amongst other things, that 80% of the population wanted conscription, and that the opposition that had emerged would be carried for the proposal by the end of the campaign. He ended his argument with the statement: [...] "Don't leave the boys in the trenches. Don't see them butchered. Don't leave them below their strength or you cover Australia with shame".|$|E
2500|$|Nemțeanu left {{numerous}} {{translations of}} Heine, many {{published in the}} Jewish community's Lumea Evree, appearing as Melodii ebraice in 1919. These Judaic-themed lieder were a sample of Nemțeanu's other such work—he was also a noted translator of Yiddish poetry by Eliezer Steinbarg and Iacob Ashel Groper. His manuscripts, including his [...] "Sanitarium Elegies", were collected and preserved by Lăzăreanu, who also published a biographical notice in Adevărul Literar și Artistic, May 1925. That issue also included a lyrical prose piece by I. Peltz, reflecting on Nemțeanu's illness and death. A full corpus of his renditions from Goethe, Schiller, Lenau, Charles Baudelaire and Victor Hugo, as well as sampled early poetry of his own, was first collected in book form posthumously, as Antologie (1926). The editor was Dragomirescu. Overall, however, [...] "his oeuvre [...] scattered <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>everywhere,</b> in various newspapers or magazines, without anyone feeling the imperious duty of collecting it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Unlike other bands {{associated}} with the 1990s alternative music movement, Primus emerged from a mostly heavy metal background, with Claypool and LaLonde previously {{a part of the}} 1980s Californian thrash metal underground. Kirk Hammett, guitarist of Bay Area thrash metal band Metallica, stated in an 1991 interview that Primus are [...] "unique, they're a square peg in a round hole". The music of Primus has been described as [...] "thrash-funk meets Don Knotts, Jr." [...] and [...] "the Freak Brothers set to music". Also, Primus has been categorized as alternative rock, alternative metal, experimental rock, funk rock, funk metal, progressive rock, and [...] "thrash-funk". Regarding the band's genre, Claypool has stated [...] "We've been lumped in with the funk metal thing <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>everywhere.</b> I guess people just have to categorise you". MTV suggests that Primus is [...] "a post-punk Rush spiked with the sensibility and humor of Frank Zappa". Les Claypool himself once described their music as [...] "psychedelic polka."

2500|$|The [...] title, won by Piquet for the Brabham team of Bernie Ecclestone, {{champion}} of the non-manufacturer teams' rights, was the first-ever won by a turbocharged engine. By 1983, the dispute between FISA and FOCA had been resolved and although FOCA emerged with the stronger hand, the teams had seen {{the writing on the}} wall. Renault had proven in 1979 and 1980 that turbo-charged engines were a more efficient means of getting more performance from the powertrain with the FIA regulations. The turbo cars were faster on almost all of the high speed (Hockenheim, Osterreichring, Monza, Silverstone) and high-altitude tracks (Interlagos, Kyalami), but by 1982, the turbo cars were fastest <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>everywhere.</b> The 1982 season made it obvious to all the competing Formula One teams that turbocharged engines were the way to go if anyone wanted to be competitive in Formula 1. By 1983, the reliability of the turbo-charged engines had been ironed out and made more reliable, and in 1984, only Tyrrell still struggled on with the old DFV engines. 1983 also saw the last non-championship Formula One race: The 1983 Race of Champions at Brands Hatch, won by reigning World Champion Keke Rosberg in a Williams-Ford/Cosworth in a close fight with American Danny Sullivan.|$|E
