2500|$|The {{wire drawing}} process is quite simple in concept. The wire is {{prepared}} by shrinking {{the beginning of}} it, by hammering, filing, rolling or swaging, {{so that it will}} fit through the die; the wire is then pulled through the die. As the wire is pulled through the die, its volume remains the same, so as the diameter decreases, the length increases. Usually the wire will require more than one draw, through successively smaller dies, to reach the desired size. The American wire gauge scale is based on this. This can be done on a small scale with a <b>draw</b> <b>plate,</b> or on a large commercial scale using automated machinery. [...] The process of wire drawing changes material properties due to cold working.|$|E
5000|$|Modern wire is {{manufactured}} {{in a different}} process that was discovered in Ancient Rome. In this process, a solid metal cylinder is pulled through a <b>draw</b> <b>plate</b> with holes of a defined size. Thinner sizes of wire are made by pulling wire through successively smaller holes in the <b>draw</b> <b>plate</b> until the desired size is reached.|$|E
50|$|A <b>draw</b> <b>plate</b> is type of die {{consisting}} of a hardened steel plate {{with one or more}} holes through which wire is drawn to make it thinner. A typical plate will have twenty to thirty holes so a wide range of diameters can be drawn.|$|E
50|$|<b>Draw</b> <b>plates</b> {{reduce the}} {{thickness}} of wire by reshaping the metal; increasing length while decreasing diameter. As such, a piece of wire will become considerably lengthened during the drawing process.|$|R
50|$|Wire {{is often}} {{reduced to the}} desired {{diameter}} and properties by repeated drawing through progressively smaller dies, or traditionally holes in <b>draw</b> <b>plates.</b> After a number of passes the wire may be annealed to facilitate more drawing or, {{if it is a}} finished product, to maximise ductility and conductivity.|$|R
50|$|The {{water tower}} was a wooden structure, 70 feet high (21 metres) {{and with an}} {{octagonal}} cross-section. It was erected in the late 17th century on a site {{at the end of}} Villiers Street, by the York Watergate, now part of the Victoria Embankment Gardens. The Survey of London includes a <b>drawing</b> (<b>plate</b> 31 in volume 18) showing the building.|$|R
50|$|With a mandrel, a <b>draw</b> <b>plate</b> {{can be used}} to draw {{tubes of}} metal. Plates are {{available}} in many different sizes and shapes for drawing different shapes of wire, including round, square, oval, half-round and hexagonal. The plate has rows of holes drilled through it which are slightly wider at the back.|$|E
5000|$|A wire is a single, usually cylindrical, {{flexible}} strand or rod of metal. Wires {{are used}} to bear mechanical loads or electricity and telecommunications signals. Wire is commonly formed by drawing the metal {{through a hole in}} a die or <b>draw</b> <b>plate.</b> Wire gauges come in various standard sizes, as expressed in terms of a gauge number. The term wire is also used more loosely to refer to a bundle of such strands, as in [...] "multistranded wire", which is more correctly termed a wire rope in mechanics, or a cable in electricity.|$|E

50|$|Wire gauges may be broadly {{divided into}} two groups, the {{empirical}} and the geometric. The first includes all the older gauge measurements, notably the Birmingham (B.W.G. or Stubs) and the Lancashire. The origin of the B.W.G. is obscure. The numbers of wire were in common use earlier than 1735. It is believed that they originally {{were based on the}} series of drawn wires, No. 1 being the original rod, and succeeding numbers corresponding with each draw, so that No. 10, for example, would have passed ten times through the <b>draw</b> <b>plate.</b> But the Birmingham and the Lancashire gauge, the latter being based on an averaging of the dimensions collated from a large number of the former in the possession of Peter Stubs of Warrington, have long held the leading position, and are still retained and used probably {{to a greater extent than}} the more recent geometrical gauges.|$|E
5000|$|Since {{it is made}} of metal, wire {{has this}} same {{hardness}} property. Most modern manufacturers of jewelry wire make the wire with a defined hardness, generally a hardness of 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Historically, these numbers {{were associated with the}} number of times that the wire was pulled through a <b>draw</b> <b>plate,</b> becoming harder or stiffer each time it was drawn through the drawplate. A hardness of 0 meant that the wire had been drawn through only once and was as soft and as pliable as possible. A hardness of 4 meant that the wire had been drawn through five or more times and the wire was as stiff and as hard as possible. Most jewelry wire that is sold now is designated dead soft, half-hard, or hard, where dead soft is wire that is manufactured with a hardness of 0, half-hard is wire manufactured with a hardness of 2, and fully hardened wire is wire with a hardness of 4.|$|E
50|$|The vapors {{from the}} top of the column are a mixture of {{hydrocarbon}} gases and naphtha, at a temperature of 120 °C-130 °C. The vapor stream associated with steam used at bottom of the column is condensed by the water cooler and the liquid collected in a vessel is known as reflux drum which is present at the top of the column. Some part of the liquid is returned to the top plate of the column as overhead reflux, and the remaining liquid is sent to a stabilizer column which separates gases from liquid naphtha. A few plates below the top plate, the kerosene is obtained as product at a temperature of 190 °C-200 °C. Part of this fraction is returned to the column after it is cooled by a heat exchanger. This cooled liquid is known as circulating reflux, and it is important to control the heat load in the column. The remaining crude oil is passed through a side stripper which uses steam to separate kerosene. The kerosene obtained is cooled and collected in a storage tank as raw kerosene, known as straight run kerosene that boils at a range of 140 °C-270 °C. A few plates below the kerosene <b>draw</b> <b>plate,</b> the diesel fraction is obtained at a temperature of 280 °C-300 °C. The diesel fraction is then cooled and stored. The top product from the atmospheric distillation column is a mixture of hydrocarbon gases, e.g., methane, ethane, propane, butane, and naphtha vapors. Residual oil present at the bottom of the column is known as reduced crude oil (RCO). The temperature of the stream at the bottom is 340 °C-350 °C, which is below the cracking temperature of oil.|$|E

5000|$|Historically, in Europe, {{from the}} pre-Roman period on, the rings {{composing}} {{a piece of}} mail would be riveted closed to reduce the chance of the rings splitting open when subjected to a thrusting attack or a hit by an arrow. Up until the 14th century European mail was made of alternating rows of round riveted rings and solid rings. Sometime during the 14th century European mail makers started to transition from round rivets to wedge shaped rivets but continued using alternating rows of solid rings. Eventually European mail makers stopped using solid rings and almost all European mail was made from wedge riveted rings only with no solid rings. Both were commonly made of wrought iron, but some later pieces were made of heat-treated steel. Wire for the riveted rings was formed by either of two methods. One was to hammer out wrought iron into plates and cut or slit the plates. These thin pieces were then pulled through a <b>draw</b> <b>plate</b> repeatedly until the desired diameter was achieved. Waterwheel powered drawing mills are pictured in several period manuscripts. Another method was to simply forge down an iron billet into a rod and then proceed to draw it out into wire. The solid links would {{have been made by}} punching from a sheet. Guild marks were often stamped on the rings to show their origin and craftsmanship. Forge welding was also used to create solid links, but there are few possible examples known; the only well documented example from Europe is that of the camail (mail neck-defence) of the 7th century Coppergate helmet. Outside of Europe this practice was more common such as [...] "theta" [...] links from India. Very few examples of historic butted mail have been found and it is generally accepted that butted mail was never in wide use historically except in Japan where mail (kusari) was commonly made from butted links.|$|E
