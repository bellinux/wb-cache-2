40|$|The {{simultaneous}} {{determination of}} the monoamines dopamine (DA), noradrenaline (NA) and serotonin (5 -HT) in in vivo microdialysis samples remains challenging because of the low extracellular neurotransmitter levels in different brain regions, specific sample characteristics, {{and the quest for}} high temporal resolution and a multi-target strategy in neuropharmacological research. A fast and sensitive microbore (1. 0  mm i. d. column) UHPLC method coupled to electrochemical detection (ECD) is developed by means of design of experiments with the emphasis on sufficient retention of NA within an acceptable total analysis time. Indeed, NA is the earliest <b>eluting</b> <b>compound</b> and often interferes with the broad solvent front originating from the sample matrix. The sensitive UHPLC-ECD assay (LLOQ of 100  pM for NA and 150  pM for DA and 5 -HT) with an analysis time of 8  min for standard solutions and 20  min for in vivo microdialysis samples originating from rat hippocampus, prefrontal cortex and striatum, is validated applying accuracy profiles.

40|$|In {{this project}} a LC-MS-method for the {{analysis}} of gamma-hydroxybutyrate, gamma-butyrolactone, 1, 4 -butanediol, amphetamine and methadone was developed. Initially, the efficiency of the ionisation of the analytes was evaluated with respect to the ionisation technique (ESI, APCI and APPI) and the composition of the mobile phase. In the next step a number of different columns was tested in order to find the one with the greatest potential for separation of the substances in question. Using the selected column, the separation was optimised by means of experimental design and the software The Unscrambler 7. 8. The parameters studied were the flow rate, the column temperature and the mobile phase composition. The response variables were the resolution between the target compounds and the retention time of the last <b>eluting</b> <b>compound.</b> These experiments showed that, in order to obtain the best ionisation, the mobile phase should consist of 5 mM formic acid in water and acetonitrile. ESI should be used in the positive mode for all analytes except gamma-hydroxybutyrate, for which the negative mode should be applied. The Hypercarb column exhibited superior retention of the analytes and was therefore selected for further optimisation. The dimensions of this column were 2. 1 x 50 mm and the particle size 5 μm, connected to a 2. 1 x 10 mm precolumn containing the same packing material. The optimum of the flow rate and the column temperature were 250 μl/min and 20 ºC respectively. For the separation of gamma-hydroxybutyrate, gamma-butyrolactone and 1, 4 -butanediol the mobile phase consisted of 100 % water with 5 mM formic acid. Thereafter a gradient, up to 70 % acetonitrile with 5 mM formic acid, was used in order to elute amphetamine and methadone. Efforts were also made to find an internal standard for the method. However, none of the compounds tested was found suitable. In order to get the method usable for routine analysis, which is the goal, further work is required.

40|$|Chromatographic {{efficiency}} can {{be defined}} as the maximal number of chromatographic peaks that can be separated within a section of a chromatogram. In isothermal gas chromatography (GC) it is usually measured by number of theoretical plates and modeled by the van Deemter equation. Number of theoretical plates is not a valid measure of efficiency in temperature programmed GC due to its variability with temperature. The van Deemter equation is also not useful since it does not account for the temperature factor. Thus the purpose of this work has been to investigate how the efficiency depends on carrier gas velocity and temperature rate in temperature programmed GC by expanding the van Deemter equation to a function that accounts for temperature rate in addition to carrier gas velocity, and to develop methodology for optimizing the separation efficiency. Fatty acid methyl esters of saturated homologous and unsaturated fatty acids were used as analytes. The study involved nine different columns of varying polarity using helium, hydrogen and nitrogen as a carrier gases. Efficiency was defined as the inverse of peak width in retention index units and thus peak width was used to measure efficiency where its minimum corresponds to maximum efficiency. Peak width was then used to model van Deemter equation where carrier gas velocity and temperature rate were varied. The data obtained from measurements at different levels of combinations of the varied factors resulted in good fit of van Deemter models at all levels of temperature rate and for all carrier gases used (overall mean R 2 = 0. 9885). Then by adding the temperature rate factor the ordinary van Deemter curve was expanded to a response surface function which explains peak width in retention index units as a function of carrier gas velocity and temperature rate. The response surface function contained main, interaction and quadratic terms. But since the interacting factors may vary and there is no theoretical basis that explains which of the terms in the response surface function are significant, a backward elimination procedure was employed to detect significant terms. The result revealed that five terms are always required to define the models obtained using each column and every carrier gas. The terms that appear significant depend on the type of carrier gas used. Experiments were carried out in general at 9 levels of carrier gas velocities and 3 levels of temperature rates. Experimental designs of full 9 x 3, 5 x 3, 3 x 3, skewed 3 x 3 and Doehlert designs of carrier gas velocity and temperature rate were compared. From comparison of predicted optimum velocity and peak width measurements the 5 x 3 design showed similar result as the full 9 x 3 design. The 3 x 3, skewed 3 x 3 and Doehlert design had lower performance than the 5 x 3 design. Nevertheless they may be good enough for practical purposes. The maximum difference in predicted optimum velocity from results of full design was 0. 98 cm/s for velocities measured in the range of 10 - 15, 20 - 30 and 30 - 40 cm/s for nitrogen, helium and hydrogen respectively whereas the difference in peak width measurements were less than 0. 0005 equivalent chain length units. In chromatography there is normally a trade-off between analysis time and separation efficiency. The time of analysis which was best represented with the retention time of the last <b>eluting</b> <b>compound</b> is related to both carrier gas velocity and temperature rate by power functions. This was taken as a basis for deriving response surface function of the retention time of the last <b>eluting</b> <b>compound,</b> which was combined with the models of efficiency. An optimum line of best time efficiency trade-off was then found by an iterative procedure from the overlapped plots and was found to lay 2 - 5 %, 3 - 6 % and 3 - 8 % above the velocity that gives the minimum in van Deemter curve in optimum velocity for helium, hydrogen and nitrogen respectively. Comparison of the carrier gases indicated that at similar efficiency with helium hydrogen as carrier gas reduces the time of analysis by 24 - 31 % whereas there is 80 - 92 % increase in retention time with nitrogen as a carrier gas. On the other hand at similar retention time with helium hydrogen gives 6 - 8 % more efficiency than helium while 12 - 18 % decreases in efficiency with nitrogen is observed. The performance of different polar columns with the right selectivity for FAME was evaluated and compared. The efficiency of the columns was found to depend on polarity of the columns. The less polar DB- 23 and BP- 20 columns are the most efficient columns whereas the more polar BPX 70 and IL 100 columns have moderate and less efficiency than the others.

40|$|Quantification {{in liquid}} {{chromatography}} (LC) is becoming very important as more researchers are using LC, {{not as an}} analytical tool itself, but as a sample introduction system for other analytical instruments. The ability of LC instrumentation to quickly separate {{a wide variety of}} compounds makes it ideal for analysis of complex mixtures. For elemental speciation, LC is joined with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to separate and detect metal-containing, organic compounds in complex mixtures, such as biological samples. Often, the solvent gradients required to perform complex separations will cause matrix effects within the plasma. This limits the sensitivity of the ICP-MS and the quantification methods available for use in such analyses. Traditionally, isotope dilution has been the method of choice for LC-ICP-MS quantification. The use of naturally abundant isotopes of a single element in quantification corrects for most of the effects that LC solvent gradients produce within the plasma. However, not all elements of interest in speciation studies have multiple naturally occurring isotopes; and polyatomic interferences for a given isotope can develop within the plasma, depending on the solvent matrix. This is the case for reverse phase LC separations, where increasing amounts of organic solvent are required. For such separations, an alternative to isotope dilution for quantification would be is needed. To this end, a new method was developed using the Apex-Q desolvation system (ESI, Omaha, NE) to couple LC instrumentation with an ICP-MS device. The desolvation power of the system allowed greater concentrations of methanol to be introduced to the plasma prior to destabilization than with direct methanol injection into the plasma. Studies were performed, using simulated and actual linear methanol gradients, to find analyte-internal standard (AIS) pairs whose ratio remains consistent (deviations {+-} 10 %) over methanol concentration ranges of 5 %- 35 % (simulated) and 8 %- 32 % (actual). Quadrupole (low resolution) and sector field (high resolution) ICP-MS instrumentation were utilized in these studies. Once an AIS pair is determined, quantification studies can be performed. First, an analysis is performed by adding both elements of the AIS pair post-column while performing the gradient elution without sample injection. A comparison of the ratio of the measured intensities to the atomic ratio of the two standards is used to determine a correction factor {{that can be used to}} account for the matrix effects caused by the mobile phase. Then, organic and/or biological molecules containing one of the two elements in the AIS pair are injected into the LC column. A gradient method is used to vary the methanol-water mixture in the mobile phase and to separate out the compounds in a given sample. A standard solution of the second ion in the AIS pair is added continuously post-column. By comparing the ratio of the measured intensities to the atomic ratio of the <b>eluting</b> <b>compound</b> and internal standard, the concentration of the injected compound can be determined...|$|E

The compounds are all approximately cylindrical in shape, but are based on octahedral coordination at the metals and are also helical. When separation has been achieved, the first eluted enantiomer has always been proven to have a negative circular dichroism (CD) signal for its longest wavelength metal to ligand charge transfer band. In order to understand the underlying basis for the elution order, gas phase molecular dynamics and snap-shot minimisations of each enantiomer with the repeat unit of cellulose, glucose, have been undertaken. For new dimetallo helicates, {{it is important to have}} a quick assessment of the enantiomeric identity of the first <b>eluted</b> <b>compound.</b> To this end, the coupled-oscillator model of CD has been applied to relate the signs of the CD signals to the identity of the enantiomers. This correlation is consistent with crystallographic data for the first eluted enantiomer of the parent compound...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method for}} the determination of reduced sulfur compounds in hydrothermal seawater and body fluids from the hydrothermal tube worm Riftia pachyptila. Sulfur is a hey component of the hydrothermal ecosystem based on chemosynthesis, Sulfur compounds were derivatized at pH 8 (4. 3 for sulfide in biological fluid) with a fluorescent reagent, monobromobimane, and separated by reverse-phase HPLC. The <b>eluted</b> <b>compounds</b> were detected by spectrofluorimetry. This method allowed: the quantitative analysis of sulfide, sulfite, thiosulfate, cysteine and glutathione in seawater, vascular blood and coelomic fluids from R, pachyptila, The detection limits were in the 0. 1 mu mol l(- 1) range with a precision lower than 10 %, The method {{has been applied to}} hydrothermal seawater. The organisms are distributed along a gradient of sulfide (produced by the vent) and thiosulfate. Analysis of biological fluid was performed with a new sample treatment allowing the analysis of total sulfide (free and bound to haemoglobin) with results comparable to published methods...|$|R
30|$|The {{endophyte}} producing Trichothecinol-A {{was identified}} as Trichothecium sp. by morphological, cultural and molecular methods. RP-HPLC analyses performed on a Waters model using a C 18 symmetry pack column with a flow rate of 0.5  ml/min and the <b>eluting</b> <b>compounds</b> were detected by a dual mode wavelength detector set at 220  nm and 240  nm. The 1 D (1 H, 13 C) and 2 D NMR (COSY, NOESY, TOCSY, DEPT, 13 C– 1 H HMBC, 13 C– 1 H HSQC), ESI-MS, HRMS, IR and UV–vis show conclusively that the isolated compound was Trichothecinol–A. One liter of Trichothecium sp. yielded 4.37  mg of Trichothecinol-A. Trichothecinol-A exhibited antifungal activity against Cryptococcus albidus (NCIM 3372) up to 20  μg/ml. Cytotoxicity studies indicate that Trichothecinol-A causes 50 % cell death at 500 nM concentration in HeLa and B 16 F 10 cells and induces apoptosis in later. Inhibition of wound migration assay performed on MDA-MB- 231 cells reveals that 500 nM of Trichothecinol-A was able to inhibit wound migration by 50 % indicating its remarkable antimetastatic property.|$|R
40|$|A simple, precise, {{accurate}} stability-indicating gradient reverse phase ultra-performance liquid chromatographic (RP-UPLC) {{method was}} developed for the quantitative estimation of purity of Telmisartan drug substance and drug products in bulk samples and pharmaceutical dosage forms {{in the presence of}} its degradation products and impurities. The present method was developed using Waters Aquity BEH C 18 (100 mm x 2. 1 mm, 1. 7 µ) column with mobile phase containing a gradient time programme of the solvents A and B. The wave length selected for monitoring <b>eluted</b> <b>compounds</b> were monitored at 290 nm, the run time was within 10 min, which Telmisartan and its seven impurities were well separated. Telmisartan was found to degrade significantly in acid stress condition when it was subjected for various stress conditions. The degradation products were well separated from main peak and its impurities, proving the stability-indication of the method. The present method was validated as per international conference on harmonization (ICH) guidelines with respect to precision, specificity, linearity, limit of detection, limit of quantification, accuracy, and robustness...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{possibilities}} of a new method development (MD) algorithm that searches the chromatographic parameter space by systematically shifting and stretching the elution window over {{different parts of the}} time-axis. In this way, the search automatically focuses on the most promising areas of the solution space. Since only the retention properties of the first and last <b>eluting</b> <b>compounds</b> of the sample need to be (approximately) known, the algorithm can be directly applied to samples with unknown composition, and the proposed solutions are not sensitive to any modeling errors. The search efficiency of the algorithm has been evaluated on an extensive set of random-generated in silico samples covering a broad range of different retention properties. Compared to a pure grid-based search, the algorithm could reduce the number of missed components by 50 % and more. The algorithm has also been applied to solve three different real-world separation problems from the pharmaceutical industry. All problems could be successfully solved {{in a very short time}} (order of 12 h of instrument time) ...|$|R
40|$|Pericarpium Citri Reticulatae (Chenpi in Chinese) {{has been}} widely used as an herbal {{medicine}} in Korea, China, and Japan. Chenpi extracts are used to treat indigestion and inflammatory syndromes of the respiratory tract such as bronchitis and asthma. This thesis will analyze chemical compositions of Chenpi volatile oil, which was performed by comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography with high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC × GC-HR-TOFMS). One hundred and sixty-seven components were tentatively identified, and terpene compounds are {{the main components of}} Chenpi volatile oil, a significant larger number than in previous studies. The majority of the <b>eluted</b> <b>compounds,</b> which were identified, were well separated as a result of high-resolution capability of the GC × GC method, which significantly reduces, the coelution. β-Elemene is tentatively qualified by means of GC × GC in tandem with high-resolution TOFMS detection, which {{plays an important role in}} enhancing the effects of many anticancer drugs and in reducing the side effects of chemotherapy. This study suggests that GC × GC-HR-TOFMS is suitable for routine characterization of chemical composition of volatile oil in herbal medicines...|$|R
40|$|In this precise, accurate, and {{specific}} liquid-chromatographic procedure for determining progesterone in serum, the serum is diluted 10 -fold with water/methanol (65 / 35 by vol), and the progesterone is {{extracted from the}} sample by passage through a column of graphitized carbon black (Carbopack B, Supelco). After washing the column, we elute the progesterone with chloroform/methanol (90 / 10 by vol), which is then evaporated. The progesterone is separated on a reversed-phase C 18 column with a mobile phase of acetonitrile/water, (46 / 54 by vol) at a flow rate of 1. 6 mL/min. The <b>eluted</b> <b>compound</b> is detected by absorbance at 242 nm. Analytical recoveries for progesterone varied from 96. 0 to 97. 8 %. Within-day and day-to-day precision, determined by analyzing pooled serum, ranged from 3. 4 to 6. 4 %, and 4. 1 to 7. 9 %, respectively. The limit of detection was about 0. 2 micrograms/L.

40|$|This work {{proposes a}} fast and simple method for {{detection}} and quantification of phenolic compounds in P. D. O. Lambrusco wines using HPLC-DAD and chemometric techniques. Samples belonging to three different varieties of Lambrusco (Grasparossa, Salamino and Sorbara) were analyzed to provide a methodology appropriate for routine analysis. Given the high complexity of the sample and the coelution among chromatographic peaks, the use of chemometric techniques to extract the information of the individual <b>eluting</b> <b>compounds</b> was needed. Multivariate Curve Resolution - Alternating Least Squares (MCR-ALS) allowed {{the resolution of the}} chromatographic peaks obtained and the use of this information for the quantification of the phenolic analytes in the presence of interferences. Use of multiset analysis and local rank/selectivity information was proven to be crucial for the correct resolution and quantification of compounds. The quantitative data provided by MCR-ALS about the phenolictargets and additional compounds present in the samples analyzed provided wine composition profiles, which were afterwards used to distinguish among wine varieties. Principal ComponentAnalysis applied to the wine profiles allowed characterizing the wines according to their varieties...|$|R
