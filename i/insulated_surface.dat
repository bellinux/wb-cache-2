40|$|The surface {{dielectric}} strength of insulating materials in a non-uniform electric field under impulse voltages is investigated with emphasis given on {{the influence of}} humidity. Research on interactions between electrical discharges and <b>insulating</b> <b>surfaces</b> is of great importance, not only from the physical but also from the applications standpoints. In addition, the surface {{dielectric strength}} of insulators determines to a great extent the reliability of high voltage systems. Outdoor insulation systems, comprising of air gaps together with ceramic or polymeric insulators, are often subject to high voltage transients, thus their efficient design requires knowledge of the surface dielectric behaviour of insulators under such conditions. Interactions between electrical discharges and <b>insulating</b> <b>surfaces</b> involve multiple physical processes many of which are not yet fully understood. Moreover, minimal data are available in literature concerning the effects of atmospheric conditions on flashover. Thus, in the present study surface impulse flashover along smooth cylindrical <b>insulating</b> <b>surfaces</b> bridging a 12 cm long rod-plane gap is investigated; the <b>insulating</b> <b>surface</b> material, the waveshape and polarity of the applied impulse voltage, as well as absolute humidity were considered as influencing parameters. The main conclusions of the thesis are summarized as follows. The initial corona in the presence of an insulator initiates earlier, under lower voltage and is associated with lower charge, because of the electric field enhancement near the rod tip. However, near threshold inception conditions the initial corona inception field decreases with the <b>insulating</b> <b>surface</b> material permittivity, a fact that can be attributed to enhanced photo-ionisation around the rod tip. Under positive lightning impulse voltages the flashover voltage is lower in the presence of an <b>insulating</b> <b>surface.</b> Flashover is closely related to secondary corona inception, the spark channel develops away from the <b>insulating</b> <b>surface,</b> a behaviour found characteristic for polymeric <b>insulating</b> <b>surfaces</b> but not for the case of porcelain. Under positive switching impulse voltages the flashover voltage is higher in the presence of an <b>insulating</b> <b>surface.</b> Flashover is closely related to streamer arrival at the earthed plane. Under positive impulse voltages, flashover voltage increases with increasing absolute humidity. The inhibitory effect of humidity on flashover voltage is similar to that observed for the pure air gap for the cases where the spark channel develops away from the <b>insulating</b> <b>surface.</b> The effect of humidity is reduced when the spark channel develops close to the <b>insulating</b> <b>surface.</b> In general, for insulating arrangements where at flashover the spark channel adheres to the insulator surface the IEC atmospheric conditions correction procedure could be optimized by considering a reduced humidity correction factor. Under negative impulse voltages, the flashover voltage is lower in the presence of an <b>insulating</b> <b>surface,</b> a fact that could be attributed to the lower average field required for surface streamers to cross the full gap. Negative corona development is favoured by the <b>insulating</b> <b>surface,</b> the spark channel adheres {{to the surface of the}} insulator. The effect of humidity on flashover voltage is minimal, the IEC atmospheric conditions correction procedure yields satisfactory results. ...|$|R

40|$|Controlling the {{dissociation}} {{of single}} water molecule on an <b>insulating</b> <b>surface</b> plays {{a crucial role}} in many catalytic reactions. In this Letter, we have identified the enhanced chemical reactivity of ultrathin MgO(100) films deposited on Mo(100) substrate that causes water dissociation.

40|$|Abstract—Heat {{radiation}} equation contains 4 th exponential {{order of}} temperature which makes mathematics analysis very complicated and troublesome. Therefore, most heat transfer experts and scholars believe, {{based on their}} own experiences, that the heat radiation effect can be ignored due to small temperature difference between insulated surfaces and surrounding to simplify analysis. Due to this reason, insulation examples shown in most heat transfer, air conditioning and refrigeration text books, and some commercial packages for the design of insulations, commonly ignore the effect of heat radiation. However, this paper demonstrates that the heat radiation effect can not be ignored in the situations of thin insulation with low ambient convective heat coefficient and a large surface emissivity.
