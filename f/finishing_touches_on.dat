5|$|Kurosawa {{nevertheless}} {{continued to}} work. He wrote the original screenplays The Sea is Watching in 1993 and After the Rain in 1995. While putting <b>finishing</b> <b>touches</b> <b>on</b> the latter work in 1995, Kurosawa slipped {{and broke the}} base of his spine. Following the accident, he would use a wheelchair {{for the rest of his}} life, putting an end to any hopes of him directing another film. His longtime wish—to die on the set while shooting a movie—was never to be fulfilled.|$|E

25|$|Never {{stopping}} his work, in 1940, {{he finished}} his memoirs. He also placed the <b>finishing</b> <b>touches</b> <b>on</b> his musical research {{on the life of}} Ludwig van Beethoven. Shortly before his death, he wrote Péguy (1944), in which he examines religion and socialism through the context of his memories. He died on 30 December 1944 in Vézelay.|$|E

25|$|Miyamoto {{has stated}} that Donkey Kong and Super Mario Bros. were not {{intended}} to be childish games, and that he hopes his works appeal {{to a wide variety of}} different people. Part of Miyamoto's development philosophy is to make his games friendly to the player; for example, the ability to save and resume one's progress. He has said that <b>finishing</b> <b>touches</b> <b>on</b> a game can make a large difference on the final product.|$|E
25|$|Departing Subic Bay on 29 January 1972, Tutuila made port at Kaohsiung on 2 February, to {{the accompaniment}} of a Chinese {{military}} band which played tunes from the dockside. For the next three weeks, final checks were undertaken to put the <b>finishing</b> <b>touches</b> <b>on</b> the transfer. Finally, by 21 February 1972, all was in readiness. On that day, Tutuila was decommissioned and struck from the Navy list. Transferred to the Nationalist Chinese Navy, she was renamed ROCS Pien Tai (ARG-516) and served as a supply ship into 1979.|$|E
25|$|From Senafe, Merewether {{sent out}} two letters from Lieutenant-General Napier: one to Emperor Tewodros, {{demanding}} {{the release of}} the hostages (which Rassam intercepted and destroyed, afraid this ultimatum might enrage Tewodros against the prisoners); the other to the people of Ethiopia, proclaiming that he was there purely to free the captives and that he had hostile intentions only towards those who sought to oppose him. Napier arrived at Zula on 2 January 1868, and put the <b>finishing</b> <b>touches</b> <b>on</b> his plan of advance before leaving on 25 January for Senafe.|$|E

25|$|Early in {{the third}} quarter, Hall kicked another field goal {{on the end of}} a drive that was set up by a 70-yard kickoff return from {{receiver}} Chad Morton. Later on, Pennington completed 5/6 passes for 59 yards on a 74-yard drive, the last one a 3-yard touchdown toss to rookie tight end Chris Baker. Then on Indy's ensuing drive, Damien Robinson intercepted a pass from Manning and returned it 24 yards to the Colts 36-yard line. New York then drove 64 yards in 13 plays, 11 of them runs by Jordan for 59 yards, including a 1-yard touchdown run to make the final score of the game 41-0. Jets linebacker James Darling then put the <b>finishing</b> <b>touches</b> <b>on</b> the win by intercepting Manning's final pass of the game.|$|E
25|$|Parker joined Pond live on drums in late 2009 {{after being}} {{recruited}} by fellow Tame Impala members Jay Watson and Nick Allbrook. Parker later joined Pond {{in the studio}} on drums for the album Beard, Wives, Denim, and also produced it, putting his distinctive production sound on the album. Cameron Avery later filled in for Parker live on Pond's 2012 tour, while Parker was putting the <b>finishing</b> <b>touches</b> <b>on</b> the second Tame Impala album, Lonerism. On 28 June 2012, Parker joined Pond for a one-off performance with legendary Can frontman Damo Suzuki. Parker played drums and later played guitar for the one-off, totally improvised performance {{with one of his}} musical idols, Suzuki. Parker also mixed the latest Pond albums, Man It Feels Like Space Again and The Weather.|$|E
25|$|Artwork, {{exterior}} details, landscaping, {{and other}} <b>finishing</b> <b>touches</b> <b>on</b> {{the construction of}} Federal Triangle occupied the period from 1938 to 1947. Landscaping issues of the Grand Plaza and Circular Plaza were considered in January 1934. To protect the Federal Triangle from flooding by the Potomac River (as had happened in 1871), {{the north and west}} grounds of the Washington Monument were raised in the summer of 1938 by about six feet (two metres) in order to form a dike against any future floodwaters. The final art installation in the complex was the Oscar Straus Memorial Fountain, designs for which were first considered in December 1933. Plans for the memorial were brought before President Roosevelt for his approval the same month. Discussion continued into 1934. The Federal Triangle project was considered complete with the installation of the Straus Memorial in 1947.|$|E
25|$|Early in {{the second}} half, Kramer {{finished}} an 80-yard drive with a 6-yard touchdown pass to Green. Then linebacker Victor Jones recovered a fumble from Aikman on the Cowboys 27, leading to Kramer's 7-yard touchdown pass to Moore. In the fourth quarter, Lions running back Barry Sanders, who had been held to just 22 rushing yards up to this point, put the <b>finishing</b> <b>touch</b> <b>on</b> Detroit's victory with a 47-yard touchdown run.|$|R
60|$|That put the <b>finishing</b> <b>touch</b> <b>on</b> the panic. Stone, Robinson, and the others, all quite decent {{punishing}} batsmen {{when their}} nerves {{allowed them to}} play their own game, crawled to the wickets, declined to hit out at anything, and were clean bowled, several of them, playing back to half volleys. Adair did not suffer from panic, but his batting was not equal to his bowling, and he had fallen after hitting one four. Seven wickets were down for thirty when Psmith went in.|$|R
5|$|With Rose {{absent in}} the United States, Windle won the 220yd, 440yd, 880yd and 1650yd {{freestyle}} at the 1963 Australian Championships, {{in times of}} 2min 2.8s, 4min 23.0s, 9min 10.5s and 17min 59.6s respectively. His quest to sweep all of the freestyle events failed when David Dickson defeated him in a <b>touch</b> <b>finish</b> in the 110yd race. The pair were neck and neck but Dickson judged the <b>finishing</b> <b>touch</b> <b>on</b> the wall better.

25|$|Belle, however, is not {{oblivious}} to her peers' views of her.

The two then put the <b>finishing</b> <b>touches</b> <b>on</b> his invention and Maurice heads off to an invention fair donning a scarf knitted for him by Belle ("No Matter What {Reprise]"), but becomes lost {{in the woods and}} attacked by a pack of wolves. After surviving a wolf attack, he enters the Beast's castle where the servants, including Lumière, a maître d' turned into a candelabra, Cogsworth, the head of household turned into a clock, Babette, a maid turned into a feather duster that still seems to retain her flirtatious tendencies, Mrs. Potts, the head of the kitchen turned into a teapot, and Chip, her son turned into a teacup. They welcome him, but the horrid Beast arrives and locks Maurice away in the dungeon for trespassing.|$|E
25|$|The film's {{special effects}} were {{completed}} by seven different visual effects houses: Digital Domain, Giant Studios, The Third Floor, MPC, Soho VFX, Rodeo FX and Hatch Productions. Creating the giants took four main steps. The {{first step was}} Pre-Capture, in which performance capture was used to capture the actor's facial and body movements and render them in a real-time virtual environment. The second step took place during principal photography, where Simulcam technology was used to help the human characters virtually interact with the giants that were rendered earlier in Pre-Capture. The third step was Post-Capture, a second performance capture shoot to adjust giants' movements to seamlessly fit the live-action performances. The final step involved putting the <b>finishing</b> <b>touches</b> <b>on</b> the giant's animation, skin, hair and clothing, and composition in the shots. Creating the beanstalk involved two main requirements: set extension for shots of the actors interacting with the beanstalk, which were shot against a bluescreen, and complete CG renderings for shots of the beanstalk growing and extending from Earth {{into the world of}} the giants.|$|E
25|$|Washington {{began its}} {{schedule}} {{of spring training}} games on February 25 with three straight road games. With construction crews still putting the <b>finishing</b> <b>touches</b> <b>on</b> the stadium during the morning, the Nationals and Astros opened the Ballpark of the Palm Beaches with their first game there on February 28, with the Nationals playing as the home team at the shared facility. Commissioner of Baseball Rob Manfred cut a ceremonial ribbon, and a helicopter flyover {{took place during the}} opening ceremonies. Before a crowd of 5,897, Nationals non-roster invitee Jeremy Guthrie threw the first pitch at 1:07p.m. EST, to Astros first baseman Marwin González, whom he eventually struck out. In the bottom of the first inning, second baseman Daniel Murphy doubled for the first hit in the ballpark′s history, and a few minutes later scored its first run when right fielder Bryce Harper doubled to drive him home. In the top of the fourth inning, Astros designated hitter Carlos Beltrán hit the stadium′s first home run, and catcher Derek Norris hit the first Nationals home run in the park′s history {{in the bottom of the}} fourth. With two outs in the bottom of the ninth, outfielder Michael A. Taylor hit a walk-off solo home run to give the Nationals a 4-3 victory in their first game at their new spring training home.|$|E

He commented on the release: [...] "Metal needs a really good old-school record again. I believe I have delivered." [...] United Abominations was the band's first album to feature Glen Drover, Shawn Drover, and James Lomenzo. It also has a newer version of [...] "À Tout le Monde" [...] entitled [...] "À Tout le Monde (Set Me Free)". The 2007 version is a duet with Cristina Scabbia of Lacuna Coil; it was recorded at a slightly faster tempo than the original and contains an extended solo.|$|E

25|$|Two years later, the two architects built {{one more}} house apiece on the block.

During the late 1920s, the four wealthy residents of the East 80th Street houses, who liked the location because {{the rise in the}} land complemented by the low houses behind them {{on the south side of}} East 79th let the sun into their gardens, bought up the lots behind them on the north side of East 79th.

500|$|While {{writing at}} his home studio, Armstrong worked on a cover of The Who's 1966 mini-opera [...] "A Quick One, While He's Away"; Green Day {{recorded}} a full-band version of the song during the album sessions. Vig noted that frustrations would sometimes cause delays in the recording process for 21st Century Breakdown. Armstrong kept his lyrics closely guarded and intentionally mixed his demos so that the vocals were low in the mix and thus unintelligible to the other band members. It was not until late 2008 that he chose to share his words with Cool, Vig, and bassist Mike Dirnt by sitting down with them and reading the entire album's lyrics aloud in order. The band members made the <b>finishing</b> <b>touches</b> <b>on</b> the album in early April 2009 and claimed that its release {{would lead to a}} [...] "kind of... post-partum depression".|$|E
500|$|From {{the moment}} Wade's arrived in Britain in July Gallows started writing new {{material}} {{to follow up}} to their 2009 album Grey Britain.

A majority of the music featured on the extended play was written by the band before Wade had joined and that they put the <b>finishing</b> <b>touches</b> <b>on</b> the record with him. Lee Barratt summarises the ep as a [...] "good release of anger" [...] and that all the band felt [...] "particularly venomous when Wade joined". Just a few months later in November the band made the announcement that the new extended play would be released in early December. After the band's infamous split from Warner Bros the band decided to work on an independent record label for the release, Thirty Days of Night whom they considered as [...] "Gallows family".|$|E
500|$|Attempting {{to perfect}} their work, Coldplay had to [...] "step it {{up a few}} notches and work hard at it to get it right". The band chose Danton Supple, who mixed the bulk of A Rush of Blood to the Head, to oversee the {{production}} of X. When January went, the band had to finish the album; they were conscious of the pressure as [...] "expectations for the record grew larger" [...] and [...] "completing it became tougher and tougher". Finally, the band was settled with the song [...] "Square One", which Martin has described as [...] "a call to arms" [...] and a [...] "plea" [...] {{to each of them}} [...] "not to be intimidated by anything or anyone else". Once finished, the band felt like they could do their own songs and not have to think of anyone else's demands. During this month, the band was into the final weeks of production and had put the <b>finishing</b> <b>touches</b> <b>on</b> the tracks.|$|E

50|$|But Jacksonville {{refused to}} give up. First, a 29-yard run by Fred Taylor set off a 64-yard scoring drive that ended on Brunell's 19-yard {{touchdown}} pass to Smith. Then linebacker Kevin Hardy forced a fumble from Jets receiver Wayne Chrebet that was recovered by Thomas on the Jets 41-yard line, setting up a field goal from Mike Hollis and bringing the Jaguars to within one touchdown, 31-24. New York responded by driving inside the Jacksonville 20-yard line. With 2:30 left in the game, rookie safety Donovin Darius intercepted a pass from Testaverde in the end zone, but instead on kneeling down for a touchback, he attempted to return the ball and was tackled at the one-yard line. Jacksonville was unable to get a first down on their ensuing drive and turned the ball over on downs. A few plays later, Hall kicked a field goal to put the game away. Johnson then put the <b>finishing</b> <b>touch</b> <b>on</b> his exceptional performance by intercepting Brunell on the next play.|$|R
