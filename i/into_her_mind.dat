25|$|Upon {{receiving}} her cash {{prize of}} P800,000 (originally P1 million minus 20% tax), Marcelo {{was able to}} buy herself a second-hand car—which was the first thing that came <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> right after winning—together with her family's needs, such as saving for her partner's college education.|$|E
500|$|After {{working at}} Amnesty International in London, Rowling and her then boyfriend {{decided to move}} to Manchester, where she worked at the Chamber of Commerce. In 1990, while she was on a four-hour-delayed train trip from Manchester to London, the idea for a story of a young boy {{attending}} a school of wizardry [...] "came fully formed" [...] <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Back at the Cullen home, Alice glimpses the future, seeing Edward and Bella {{together}} with Jacob and a fully matured Renesmee also together. Edward reads Alice's mind and feels relieved that Renesmee has Jacob to protect her. Alone in the meadow, Bella pushes her mental shield away and finally allows Edward a peek <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind,</b> showing him every precious moment she and Edward shared {{together and the}} two share a kiss after Bella telling Edward, [...] "Nobody has ever loved anybody as much as I love you", and both Edward and Bella saying they'll love and be together forever.|$|E
60|$|At {{this she}} turned around and looked at him. Even <b>into</b> <b>her</b> strong <b>mind</b> the sharp edge of {{distrust}} began to insert itself.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do let {{the matter}} drop," [...] said Lady Mountjoy, {{who had also}} seen <b>into</b> <b>her</b> husband's <b>mind,</b> and saw, moreover, that the butler had done so. [...] "A young man's dinner isn't worth all this bother." ...|$|R
60|$|Again Neale had {{penetrated}} <b>into</b> <b>her</b> close-locked <b>mind.</b> What {{she said}} astounded {{him so that}} he dropped the brush and stared at Larry. And Larry lost his grin; he {{caught a glimpse of}} her face, and his own grew troubled.|$|R
2500|$|Leonard Woolf {{wrote about}} Sackville-West, who, as an aristocrat, {{came from a}} very {{different}} world than {{he and his wife}} : [...] "She [...] belonged indeed to a world which was completely different from ours, and the long line of Sackvilles, Dorsets, Da La Warrs and Knole with its 365 rooms had put <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> and heart an ingredient which was alien to us and at first made intimacy difficult". While Sackville-West was visiting Nicholson in Tehran, Woolf wrote to her: [...] "Then there's my character (you see how egoistical I am, for I only answer questions that are about myself), I agree with the lack of jolly vulgarity. But then think about how I was brought up! No school, mooning about alone among my father's books, never a chance to pick up all that goes on in the schools-throwing balls: ragging: slang: vulgarity: scenes: jealousies: only rages with my half brothers and being walked off my legs round the Serpentine by my father". In her reply, Sackville-West wrote: [...] "But indeed, my upbringing wasn't so different from yours: I move about too, at Knole mostly, and haven't had a brother or sister to knock the corners off me. And I never went to school. If I am jolly and vulgar, you can cry quits on another count, for you have that interest in humanity which I can never manage-at least I have the interest, but not the diabolical skill in its practice which is yours. As I get older...I get more and more disagreeably solitary". Besides for having similar childhoods, both women had grown up with a profound sense of the weight of English history as Woolf's father Sir Leslie Stephen had been a leading contributor to The Dictionary of National Biography while Sackville-West had grown up at Knole House, one of the grand country houses of England. Likewise, Sackville-West had felt torn between her Spanish heritage which contrasted with the English grandeur she had been brought up in at Knole House while Woolf felt torn between the [...] "sobriety" [...] of her father's family vs. the [...] "flamboyance" [...] of her mother's family.|$|E
60|$|Then I {{returned}} to my huts to bid farewell to my wives and children, and there I found that my wife, Anadi, the mother of Moosa, my son, had fallen sick with a wandering sickness, for strange things came <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind,</b> and what came <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> that she said, being, as I did not doubt, bewitched by some enemy of my house.|$|E
60|$|Carol dropped Ruth's hand {{suddenly}} in {{the shock of}} a sudden idea that darted <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind.</b>|$|E
50|$|Morgan Grimes {{prepares to}} move in with Chuck to avoid his mother's {{relationship}} with Big Mike. However, Anna informs him that she has a new apartment for them {{to move in}}to together. Rather than tell Anna the truth, Morgan decides to annoy <b>her</b> <b>into</b> changing <b>her</b> <b>mind.</b> First, he declines spending time with her to play Wii Tennis with Jeff Barnes and Lester Patel.|$|R
5000|$|Thor makes a cameo in the X-Men {{animated}} series episode [...] "The Dark Phoenix Saga (Part 3): The Dark Phoenix", {{when the}} Phoenix rises up <b>into</b> the sky, <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> shows Thor's hammer Mjölnir reacting to her presence.|$|R
50|$|Owner Sophia (Irene Papas) {{refuses to}} allow them to stay at her inn, The Moon-Spinners, but Aunt Frances and Sophia's teenage son Alexis (Michael Davis) persuade <b>her</b> <b>into</b> {{changing}} <b>her</b> <b>mind.</b> Whilst Nicky and Aunt Frances are in their room, Sophia's brother Stratos (Eli Wallach) demands to know why they chose to stay at his sister's inn and says they should leave, but Aunt Frances insists on staying. Stratos reluctantly agrees {{to allow them}} to stay for one night.|$|R
60|$|Then {{a thought}} flashed <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind,</b> as she remembered {{what she had}} seen at the station some months ago.|$|E
6000|$|... "You had {{no right}} to listen," [...] Evelyn {{retorted}} severely; but the information sank <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind,</b> and she afterward remembered it.|$|E
60|$|The Colonel still sat {{looking up}} at her face, and {{watching}} the effect of the poison of ambition which he had artfully instilled <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind.</b>|$|E
50|$|Layla however, {{goes further}} back, where she meets {{up with her}} younger past self. After telling her all of this she {{downloads}} <b>her</b> knowledge <b>into</b> <b>her</b> past self's <b>mind</b> thus further completing the causality loop and granting her the knowledge she had to begin with.|$|R
50|$|Black Mamba {{has limited}} telepathic {{abilities}} that {{allow her to}} scan the minds of others nearby. The extent of her telepathy is unrevealed; it is unknown if she possesses other abilities possessed by most telepaths, such as mental communication. She uses this power to extract and project illusions of loved ones <b>into</b> <b>her</b> victims' <b>minds</b> while placing <b>her</b> target in a sedated trance-like state {{in which they are}} fixated upon the mental image she has created.|$|R
50|$|Later {{during the}} Infinity War when Adam Warlock's evil persona Magus {{attempted}} {{to conquer the}} universe, he used the alien species Anthropomorpho to create evil doppelgangers of Earth's heroes, Sue included. In order to subdue Susan the alien took the name Malice, and Sue was only able to defeat the doppelganger by absorbing <b>her</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> own <b>mind</b> and incorporate its evil into herself. That boost allowed the negative aspect of Malice to regain control temporarily.|$|R
6000|$|All of a sudden, {{the thought}} rushed <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind,</b> how glad Ben would be!--and Bab would feel all happy again. [...] "I must carry him home." ...|$|E
60|$|A thought {{which had}} flashed <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> gave the reply a greater decisiveness {{than it might}} {{otherwise}} have possessed. To-morrow was the day for Stephen's letter.|$|E
60|$|Katie on the {{contrary}} turned pale, for her previously expressed hope {{that there might be}} some connection between Queeker's mission and Billy Towler's troubles flashed <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind.</b>|$|E
60|$|She {{looked up}} the fawn of the red doe they had killed two nights ago, and found it. But it was lonely hunting without Andoo, and she {{returned}} caveward before dawn. The sky was grey and overcast, the trees up the gorge were black and unfamiliar, and <b>into</b> <b>her</b> ursine <b>mind</b> came a dim sense of strange and dreary happenings. She lifted up her voice and called Andoo by name. The sides of the gorge re-echoed her.|$|R
5000|$|... 1926 {{was also}} the year Dunn's film Twinkletoes was released. Dunn had tough {{competition}} for her production of Twinkletoes to be performed by famous actress Colleen Moore. Based off the Thomas Burke book Twinkletoes: A Tale of the Limehouse, Dunn had to dig deep <b>into</b> <b>her</b> creative <b>mind</b> to create a film story that fit Moore, while staying relatively true to the original narrative. After extensive hard work and creative breakthroughs, Dunn beat out the competition and production began a few weeks later.|$|R
60|$|She {{struggled}} on up {{the uneven}} slope with a tightening at her heart which was not all exhaustion. For {{the first time she}} doubted herself, but it was too late. She could not turn back. Suddenly she felt that she was on a smoother, easier course. Not to strike a stone or break a twig seemed unusual. It might be a path worn by deer going to a spring. Then <b>into</b> <b>her</b> troubled <b>mind</b> flashed the joyful thought, she had found a trail.|$|R
60|$|The blood {{crept into}} Hawtrey's face, {{for this was}} a thing he could not tell her; but a swift {{suspicion}} flashed <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> {{as she looked at}} him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Truth about me?" [...] echoed Bess, shrinkingly. She {{seemed to}} be casting back <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> for a {{forgotten}} key. Venters himself, as he saw her, received a pang.|$|E
6000|$|... "Saved your life?" [...] exclaimed Betty, {{turning to}} her brother, in surprise, while a dark red flush spread over her face. A humiliating thought had flashed <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind.</b>|$|E
60|$|During {{the night}} and storm, the little Mara had lain {{sleeping}} as quietly as if the cruel sea, that had made her an orphan from her birth, were her kind-tempered old grandfather singing her to sleep, as he often did,--with a somewhat hoarse voice truly, but with ever an undertone of protecting love. But toward daybreak, there came very clear and bright <b>into</b> <b>her</b> childish <b>mind</b> a dream, having that vivid distinctness which often characterizes the dreams of early childhood.|$|R
60|$|We changed chairs; {{the light}} now fell full on her face. Had she {{deliberately}} challenged {{me to look}} <b>into</b> <b>her</b> secret <b>mind</b> if I could? Anything like the stark insensibility of that young girl to every refinement of feeling, to every becoming doubt of herself, to every customary timidity of her age and sex {{in the presence of}} a man who had not disguised his unfavorable opinion of her, I never met with in all my experience of the world and of women.|$|R
5000|$|Amamiya {{has shown}} two techniques. One is [...] "Wired Mind Jack", where she sends a wired Trance <b>into</b> <b>her</b> enemy's <b>mind</b> and {{attempts}} to extract information. Her second technique is [...] "Mind Jack: Insanity Scythe". Amamiya creates a giant crystallization of her Trance {{in the shape of}} a scythe. When shattered, it releases quantum thought waves that cause the enemy to hallucinate. Her Nova ability allows <b>her</b> to split <b>into</b> two beings, <b>her</b> original self and Abyss. This ability allows Amamiya and Abyss to work together as a team; Amamiya reads <b>her</b> opponent's <b>mind</b> using Trance and relays information to Abyss via telepathy, allowing the latter to perform actions immediately. (Voiced by):Yui Horie in the VOMIC.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Hastings reflectively, [...] "I'm {{not sure}} that it is your duty to put ideas <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> when you can't be quite certain that she has entertained them." ...|$|E
6000|$|Fleda {{scarcely}} {{heard his}} words; something new had suddenly come <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind.</b> [...] "When {{you went to}} Waterbath after seeing me," [...] she asked, [...] "did you tell her all about that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed," [...] said Gertrude, wincing as all {{the hard}} things Trefusis had told her of herself came <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> at the heels of Erskine's unfortunate allusion to her power of enjoying herself.|$|E
60|$|In that {{unlighted}} {{room with}} the moonbeams drifting in, she sat down at Summerhay's bureau, where he often worked too late at his cases, depriving her of himself. She sat there resting her elbows on the bare wood, crossing her finger-tips, gazing out <b>into</b> the moonlight, <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> drifting on a stream of memories {{that seemed to have}} beginning only from the year when he came <b>into</b> <b>her</b> life. A smile crept out on her face, and now and then she uttered a little sigh of contentment.|$|R
5000|$|Pocky can use Player 2's {{character}} as a utility in various ways. Using [...] "magic", she can force herself <b>into</b> <b>her</b> partner's <b>mind</b> and control their body {{for a short}} time, enabling unique abilities depending on who she possesses. Additionally, she can throw her partner at enemies to attack, doing massive damage to the enemy but temporarily killing the thrown character. This exploitation of player 2 is {{a departure from the}} previous game, in which player 1 and Player 2 had similar powers and were equally valuable.|$|R
60|$|And Caroline also walked silently {{down the}} hill. She {{knew that she}} had given an {{ambiguous}} answer, and was content to let it remain so. In the silence of her chamber, she would think over this thing and make her calculations. She would inquire <b>into</b> <b>her</b> own <b>mind,</b> and learn whether she could afford to love this man whom she could not but acknowledge to be so loveable. As for asking any one else, seeking counsel in the matter from her aunt, that never for a moment suggested itself to Caroline Waddington.|$|R
