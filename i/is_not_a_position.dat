This kind of post, indeed, is generally given to a miner of experience, getting past his work--as care, attention, and knowledge are required, rather than hard work.

50|$|The word peasant, {{since the}} 14th century (or even before), has a pejorative meaning and <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> neutral term. However, it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> always that way; peasants were once viewed as pious and seen {{with respect and}} pride. Life was hard for peasants, but life was hard for everyone. As nobles {{increasingly}} lived better quality lives, there arose a new consciousness of those on top and those on bottom, and the sense that being <b>a</b> peasant <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> of equality.

Women are active and play key roles in organizing activities and administering them in the Church. Female office holders are always head of groups of women and not groups of men. A deaconess can help pastors and deacons, but cannot herself administer the sacrament.

5000|$|Within complex food-foraging groups it {{can often}} be {{possible}} to have a chieftain or headman in position of power over the other members. In the case of the ǃKung, this is a special circumstance. These San are not devoid of leadership, but neither are they dependent on it in the slightest. San groups of the Southern Kalahari have had chieftains in the past, however it is a somewhat complicated process through which these members of the group would ascertain said position. Chieftainship within these San groups <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> that has more power than the others; having the same social status as those members of [...] "aged years". [...] Naming oneself as chieftain is closer to the simple addition of a name. There are responsibilities that the chieftain assumes, such as becoming the tribe's 'logical head'. This duty entails such roles as dividing up the meat from hunter's kills and these leaders do not get a larger portion than any other member of the village.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the story}} of a winner-take-all America, the authors believe Republicans wear [...] "black hats" [...] and the Democrats [...] "gray hats". The GOP stands {{strongly}} united in favor of policies favoring the wealthy, and becoming ever more extreme through the 1990s and 2000s. Their adherence to tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans exceeds all the other problems — deficit reduction, or tax cuts for the middle- or upper-middle-class — in cases such as the negotiation of the 1997 deficit reduction budget deal. This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> Republican necessarily admit to, or are unaware of public resistance to. In 2001, internal memos told the Bush administration that `the public prefers spending on things like health care and education over cutting taxes`", but the GOP went on with a major cut — one third of which went to the richest 1% of Americans. GOP leaders [...] "appealed openly to bankers for financial support by touting their opposition to financial reform" [...] following the 2008 financial crisis, while [...] "leading GOP strategists" [...] accused Democrats of bailing out Wall Street and [...] "putting taxpayers on the hook," [...] in [...] "`populist` commercials and sound bites" [...] for voters.|$|E

5000|$|The {{controversy}} really {{begins when}} ordinary language philosophers {{apply the same}} leveling tendency to questions such as What is Truth? or What is Consciousness? Philosophers in this school would insist that we cannot assume that (for example) 'Truth' 'is' a 'thing' (in the same sense that tables and chairs are 'things'), which the word 'truth' represents. Instead, we must look at the differing {{ways in which the}} words 'truth' and 'conscious' actually function in ordinary language. We may well discover, after investigation, that there is no single entity to which the word 'truth' corresponds, something Wittgenstein attempts to get across via his concept of a 'family resemblance' (cf. Philosophical Investigations). Therefore, ordinary language philosophers tend to be anti-essentialist. Of course, this was and is a very controversial viewpoint. Anti-essentialism and the linguistic philosophy associated with it are often important to contemporary accounts of feminism, Marxism, and other social philosophies that are critical of the injustice of the status quo. The essentialist 'Truth' as 'thing' is argued to be closely related to projects of domination, where the denial of alternate truths is understood to be a denial of alternate forms of living. Similar arguments sometimes involve ordinary language philosophy with other anti-essentialist movements like post-structuralism. However, strictly speaking, this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> derived from Wittgenstein, as it still involves 'misuse' (ungrammatical use) of the term [...] "truth" [...] in reference to [...] "alternate truths".|$|E
5000|$|The {{goal of the}} Ruhi Institute courses is to [...] "evoke a {{transformative}} {{learning experience}} through a learner-centered, experiential, and collaborative approach facilitated by a tutor rather than an instructor, a teacher, or an expert." [...] Academics have identified the practice as an instance of praxeology. The tutor roles [...] "refer to functions we perform {{at a given time}} and not to positions we (sic) hold in the community.'" [...] Indeed Ruhi restructures societal norms, roles, and goals of education [...] "…to re-vision societal images and systems of education as part of the design of new systems of learning and human development that are consonant with the emerging global world-view." [...] The courses are designed to be run with organically developed groups of learners, using [...] "critical reflection, interactive thinking, activities designed to transform theory into practical action". Tutors who facilitate courses are to reflect on their motives and encouraged to perform their role as virtuous service. Tutoring <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> of authority but a service to the community - an explicit factor in training of tutors, seeking to foster “beautiful behaviors” to function as [...] "friends teaching friends". The course [...] "applies the concept of 'being and doing' and incorporates 'action and reflection' as a key learning strategy." [...] Priorities folded into the process of the courses and their refinement include [...] "Projecting a systemic, global world-view"; [...] "ensuring the right to learn and the right to know"; [...] "nurturing the development of diversity"; [...] "providing the competencies to make interdependence a social reality"; (and) [...] "providing for social and cultural evolution." ...|$|E

40|$|The authors {{review the}} {{literature}} concerning {{the possibilities of}} modifying the mechanical characteristics of the respiratory system with breathing retraining and other chest physiotherapy intervention. Breathing retraining techniques with prolonged and active expiration induce increased work of breathing and do not help diaphragmatic function. Only pursed lips breathing seems to produce some mechanical advantages. The seated and forward position with fixed arms may reduce dyspnea {{but this does not}} appear to be caused by a decrease in operating lung volumes. By contrast, the dorsal decubitus position may reduce hyperinflation, giving some mechanical advantage to the diaphragm but does not reduce dyspnea and <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> spontaneously adopted by patients. General muscular training may reduce ventilatory demand, and by reducing respiratory frequency lead to a decrease in the end expiratory lung volume; therefore inducing improvement in exercise tolerance. © 2009 SPLF.

40|$|I {{read with}} great {{interest}} and excitement Boris Wyssusek’s critical review of the Bunge-Wand-Weber (BWW) modeling ontology and its philosophical foundations. The review articulates carefully Bunge’s position on ontology and how the BWW ontology sharply deviates from it. I agree with most of Wyssusek’s criticisms leveled against Wand and Weber’s interpretation and ontologically Wand and Weber’s position is untenable and not in line with Bunge’s original definition of ontology and its scientific intentions. I even wonder whether Wand and Weber want {{to be recognized as}} ardent proponents of Bunge’s Diamat ontology. In business schools where they mostly work this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> which is esteemed or easily understood—it can even be dangerous! If one wants to reject the BWW model based on its inventors ’ misinterpretation of Bunge’s ontology, there is very little to add to Wyssusek’s conclusions. But this is not the only story that we can learn from this debate. There are additional lessons that can be garnered from the BWW ontology research.

40|$|Structural realism {{has been}} {{proposed}} as an epistemological position interpolating between realism and sceptical anti-realism about scientific theories. The structural realist who accepts a scientific theory ⊖ thinks that ⊖ is empirically correct, and furthermore is a realist about the 'structural content' of ⊖. But what exactly is 'structural content'? One proposal is that the 'structural content' of a scientific theory {{may be associated with}} its Ramsey sentence ℜ(⊖). However, Demopoulos and Friedman have argued, using ideas drawn from Newman's earlier criticism of Russell's structuralism, that this move fails to achieve an interesting intermediate position between realism and anti-realism. Rather, ℜ(⊖) adds little content beyond the instrumentalistically acceptable claim that the theory ⊖ is empirically adequate. Here, I formulate carefully the crucial claim of Demopoulos and Friedman, and show that the Ramsey sentence ℜ(⊖) is true just in case ⊖ possesses a full model which is empirically correct and satisfies a certain cardinality condition on its theoretical domain. This suggests that structural realism <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> significantly different from the anti-realism it attempts to distinguish itself from. © British Society for the Philosophy of Science 2004...|$|E
