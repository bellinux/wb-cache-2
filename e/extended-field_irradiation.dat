40|$|To {{evaluate}} the efficacy and the toxicity of prophylactic extended-field carbon-ion radiotherapy (C-ion RT, Protocol 0508) for locally advanced {{squamous cell carcinoma}} of the uterine cervix in phase I / II clinical trial. Between May 2006 and January 2012, 26 patients of Protocol 0508 were treated with C-ion RT. The numbers of patients with stage IIB, IIIB, and IVA disease were 13, 11, and 2, respectively. Twenty patients had pelvic lymph node metastases. Median tumor size was 6. 1 cm (range, 4. 0 â€“ 10. 0 cm). The treatment consisted of <b>extended-field</b> <b>irradiation</b> of 39. 0 gray equivalents (GyE) in 13 fractions, and additional 15. 0 GyE in 5 fractions {{was given to the}} gross tumor volume (GTV) and surrounding tissues. With regard to local boost, 18. 0 GyE in 2 fractions was given to GTV only. Total dose to the cervical tumor was 72. 0 GyE over 20 fractions. The median follow-up period was 37 months. Twenty-one patients had grade 1 or 2 acute gastrointestinal toxicity, but all patients completed the treatment on schedule. There were no grade 3 or higher late complications, with 8 patients having grade 1 or 2 toxicities, 1 had grade 2 gastrointestinal toxicity and 2 had grade 2 genitourinary toxicity. Four patients (15. 4 %) developed local recurrence, and 8 patients (30. 8 %) had distant metastases. The 2 -year local control rate, progression-free survival rate and overall survival rate were 83. 6 %, 61. 5 % and 73. 1 %, respectively. There were no severe acute or late complications in this trial. Prophylactic extended-field C-ion RT for locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix was a safe treatment. Although the number of patients in this study was small, the results support further investigations to confirm the therapeutic efficacy and to avoid or reduce toxicity. UMIN-CTR UMIN 000016169...|$|E
40|$|Summary. Six hundred sixty-seven {{children}} under age 16 were enrolled in 4 consecutive studies in West Germany be-tween 1978 and 1990. These trials were mainly designed to reduce the long-term sequelae of high dose <b>extended-field</b> <b>irradiation</b> {{as well as the}} late effects of chemotherapy, in the context of combined modality treatment for all stages. Treat-ment concepts and results of studies HD- 82, HD- 85 and HD- 87 are presented here. Patients with stages IA/B and I 1 A were treated with 2 cycles of OPPA (HD- 82, n- 100) or OPA without procarbazine (HD- 85, n- 53; HD- 87, n- 104), followed by involved field irradiation (IFI) using 35 Gy (HD- 82, HD- 85) or 30 Gy (HD- 87). Kaplan-Meier esti-mates (KME) for event-free survival (survival) at 4. 5 years are 99 % (100 %) in HD- 82, 85 % (98 %) in HD- 85 and 88 % (100 %) in HD- 87. Thus, 2 x OPPA is a highly effective chemotherapy eradicating occult microfoci in the non-ir-radiated adjacent fields, whereas 2 x OPA is less efficacious. Reduction of the radiation dose to 30 Gy (IFI) within the combined modality concept does not affect treatment out-come. About 30 % of the boys treated with 2 x OPPA, but none of the girls and none of the boys treated without procar-bazine (PC) showed elevated FSH-levels indicating gonadal dysfunction. No secondary leukemias and preleukemias were observed. Patients with the advanced stages 11 IB and IVA/B (plus some patients with IIE B and IIIE A/B) were treated with 6 cycles of chemotherapy: 2 x OPPA plus 4 x COPP in HD- 82 and HD- 87; 2 x OPA plus 4 x COMP (without PC, M = methotrexate) in HD- 85, followed by IFI using 25 Gy (HD- 82, HD- 85) or 20 Gy (HD- 87). Radiation doses to in-volved lungs and liver were 12 - 15 Gy. KME for event-free survival (survival) at 4. 5 years were 88 % (90 %) in HD- 82 (n = 50), 54 % (100 %) in HD- 85 (n = 24) and 91 % (95 %) i...|$|E
