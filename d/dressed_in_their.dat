5|$|He {{spent some}} {{of his time in}} Missouri visiting Dent's family and became engaged to Dent's sister, Julia, in 1844. Four years later on August 22, 1848, they were married at Julia's home in St. Louis. Grant's {{abolitionist}} father Jesse, who disapproved of the Dents owning slaves, refused to attend their wedding, which took place without either of Grant's parents. Grant was flanked by three fellow West Point graduates, all <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> blue uniforms, including Longstreet, Julia's cousin. At the end of the month, Julia was nevertheless warmly received by Grant's family in Bethel, Ohio. They had four children: Frederick, Ulysses Jr. ("Buck"), Ellen ("Nellie"), and Jesse. After the wedding, Grant obtained a two-month extension to his leave and returned to St. Louis when he decided, with a wife to support, that he would remain in the army.|$|E

The remains of the Goebbels' family, Hitler, Eva Braun, General Hans Krebs, and Hitler's dogs were repeatedly buried and exhumed. The last burial was at the SMERSH facility in Magdeburg on 21 February 1946. In 1970, KGB director Yuri Andropov authorised an operation to destroy the remains. On 4 April 1970, a Soviet KGB team used detailed burial charts to exhume five wooden boxes at the Magdeburg facility. The remains from the boxes were burned, crushed, and scattered into the Biederitz river, a tributary of the nearby Elbe.|$|E

In fact, the doctor inspected them only briefly and did not return for several days. By mid-summer doctors were examining their charges very perfunctorily, allowing them to walk past and examining the tongues of any who looked feverish. In this way, many people with latent fever were allowed to pass as healthy, only to succumb to their sickness once they had left Grosse Isle.|$|E

25|$|Unlike his {{predecessors}} Jan van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden, who typical painted exterior wings in grisaille, Memling shows the saints in a realistic manner. Although the donors in van Eyck's Ghent Altarpiece and van der Weyden's Beaune Altarpiece are also painted realistically, they are placed within architectural niches {{separate from the}} adjacent statue-like grisaille saints. Memling breaks with that tradition in these exterior panels, but the subdued palette he uses retains some sense of grisaille. The donors are <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> Augustinian habits; {{the two men in}} stark black and the two women in white on black. The saints are dressed in monochromatic clothing. St James wears a light blue cloak and St Anthony's is grey. St Agnes is dressed in drab green and St Clare is also in a dark habit. Although the figures seem to be in two niches, they are enclosed in a single shallow space, with stone walls behind, trefoil arches above, and two columns adorning the outermost edges. Where the wings open is a single column which has the appearance of two separate columns.|$|E
25|$|Participants {{are split}} into two main sections: the Guard-of-Honour contingents and the Supporting Contingents. The four Guard-of-Honour contingents {{are made up of}} members from the three arms of the Singapore Armed Forces (the Singapore Army, {{represented}} by the Best Combat Unit, for many years the 1st Commando Battalion of the Singapore Armed Forces Commando Formation; the Republic of Singapore Navy; and the Republic of Singapore Air Force) as well as the Singapore Police Force. All members of these contingents are <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> respective ceremonial uniforms, known as the No. 1 uniform. Behind the Guard-of-Honour contingents stand the Regimental Colours Party, where the 32 SAF regimental colours are held by a group of officers, known as ensigns, from the Singapore Armed Forces, with their armed escorts (until 1997 Service Regimental Colors from the SAF's three services led the colours party). The 3 State Colours are in between the Navy and Air Force Guard-of-Honour contingents, and are formed by Escorts(Specialists) and Ensigns (Junior Officers). The parade's military bands are from both the SAF and SPF, and in recent years, the marching bands of both services' cadet organizations (the NCC Band and the NPCC Band) have joined them as well. Before the 1994 creation of the SAF Bands the different service arms of the SAF fielded their own bands, and the massed bands for the parade were, insce the late 1970s, from a select band of the SAF and the Singapore Police Force Band (inter-service massed bands would only happen in 1987).|$|E
25|$|Scene Three {{takes place}} on a Saturday. A hoedown-themed wedding {{reception}} has been organized at Dino's Diner. People are <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> party best, dancing and taking photographs. But {{in the midst of}} the jollity there is an ominous mood. Both Lana and Angelo try to get close to Luca, not realizing that the two of them have each slept with him, while Dino develops an odd sense that something untoward is happening, with Luca at its center. Rita continues to pine after Angelo, but he ignores her. Smarting from Dino's attempts to assert dominance over the proceedings and especially his wife, Lana and Luca sneak off from the party for a dalliance in the garage. They are caught by Dino, who gets into a fight with Luca. Lana tries to intervene but is punched in the stomach by Dino. Luca lunges at Dino but Dino pushes him to the ground. Then Lana picks up a heavy spanner and hits Dino on the head with it. He is stunned by the blow. Lana prevails upon Luca to finish Dino off, and Luca, despite some momentary reluctance, clubs Dino one last time. Dino falls to the ground, apparently dead. Luca and Lana hear someone coming, so they drag Dino's body into his office. Unknown to them, Rita has witnessed the last part of the fight, and she hurries off to call the police. Then Angelo appears, seeking Luca. To Luca and Lana's horror, Dino is not dead – he crawls out of the office and grabs Angelo, seeking help. He then collapses on Angelo, smearing him with his blood. The commotion by Angelo and Dino causes the partygoers to run into the garage. Luca flees before the local cop, Chuck, arrives on the scene. Lana claims that Angelo murdered Dino, and pretends to cry over his dead body. Angelo, realizing his predicament too late and protesting his innocence, is arrested and taken away.|$|E

When the British envoy, Sir Edward Ramsay, arrives and gazes at them through a monocle, they are panicked by the [...] "evil eye" [...] and lift their skirts over their heads as they flee. Sir Edward is diplomatic about the incident. When the King is called away, it emerges that Sir Edward is an old flame of Anna's, and they dance in remembrance of old times, as Edward urges her to return to British society. The King returns and irritably reminds them that dancing is for after dinner.|$|E
500|$|On 28 April 1941, McKenzie {{accompanied}} 14 of her WESC trainees (twelve telegraphists and two domestic helpers).

The women were <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> green WESC uniform which had been designed by McKenzie herself – it was several months before a female Navy uniform was ready. Francis Proven became WRANS number 1. From this initial intake of 14, the WRANS ranks expanded to some 2,600 {{by the end of}} the war, representing about 10 per cent of the entire Royal Australian Naval force at the time. All told, McKenzie trained about 3,000 women, one-third of whom went into the services. Many others remained at the Clarence Street school as instructors.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Ride a White Horse" [...] was {{directed}} by Diane Martel and filmed in London, England in December 2005. The video features Alison Goldfrapp, {{dressed in a white}} dress, in multiple disturbing situations. The video begins with Goldfrapp, her back to the camera, trailing toilet paper from one of her spike heels, singing into a microphone made of a cardboard roll and aluminium foil. As she sings, footage of rotting food is displayed behind her. She is then shown eating a slice of pizza covered in cigarette butts and bottlecaps. The next scenes feature Goldfrapp pulling a large plastic dog; singing in front of a man bandaged in toilet paper eating from a garbage can; and dancing with dirty men that came out of a trashbin <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> underwear. The video concludes with Goldfrapp forcing the leg of the bandaged man into a toilet.|$|E

500|$|The band {{made three}} promotional clips for [...] "Hello, Goodbye". Filmed on 10 November 1967 at the Saville Theatre in London, the clips were {{directed}} by McCartney. The first one shows the Beatles <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> Sgt. Pepper uniforms, {{apart from a}} brief cut-away where the group are wearing their 1963-era matching collarless suits. In author John Winn's description of the three clips, this version shows the Beatles performing the song against a psychedelic backdrop, while over the coda they are joined on the stage by female hula dancers. Starr is seen playing a miniature drum kit and, unusually, Lennon appears without his granny glasses. In the second clip, the Beatles mime to the song dressed in more conventional attire and with the stage backdrop depicting a rural setting. The third version combines footage shot during these two scenes with the band playing the song before what Winn terms a [...] "glittery pastel backdrop".|$|E
500|$|Fleming House {{students}} and alumni quickly began plotting {{for the return}} of the cannon, setting up a command center in a trailer on campus and soliciting donations from alumni. Their initial plan was to use a helicopter to fly the cannon out of the MIT campus. [...] Initial arrangements were made with a helicopter company, but Federal Aviation Administration rules ultimately made this untenable. [...] The students instead decided to surreptitiously steal back the cannon under cover of darkness. [...] On the morning of April 10, about two dozen Fleming students, <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> signature red Fleming jerseys, descended upon the cannon to reclaim it and begin its journey back to Pasadena. However, MIT students had been tipped off and were waiting for the Caltech students with a friendly barbecue prepared, and played Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries, a forbidden song at Caltech due to its association with final exams, as the Flems entered. The Fleming students left a miniature toy cannon with a note reading, [...] "Here's something a little more your size." ...|$|E
500|$|In the studio, the New York Dolls <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> usual flashy clothes. Rundgren, who did {{not approve}} of their raucous sound, at one point yelled at them during the {{sessions}} to [...] "get the glitter out of your asses and play". Sylvain recalled Rundgren inviting Buell and their Chihuahua to the studio and putting the latter atop an expensive mixing console, while Johansen acknowledged that his recollections of the sessions have since been distorted by what he has read about them: [...] "It was like the 1920s, with palm tree décor and stuff. Well, that's how I remember it, anyway." [...] He also said Rundgren directed the band from the control room with engineer Jack Douglas and hardly spoke to them while they recorded the album. According to Scopa, the group's carefree lifestyle probably conflicted with Rundgren's professional work ethic and schedule: [...] "He doesn't put up with bullshit. I mean, [...] rarely started their live sets before midnight, so who knows? Todd {{was very much in}} charge in the studio, however, and I got the impression that everybody was looking to him." ...|$|E
