5|$|The prime {{motivation}} behind Magnús' {{cooperation with}} Ælfgar is uncertain. One {{possibility is that}} he was attempting to establish Norwegian authority in the west as a means to prepare an invasion of England. In so doing, Magnús may <b>have</b> <b>backed</b> the cause of a local faction that opposed Echmarcach. Certainly, the thirteenthfourteenth-century Chronicle of Mann records that Ímar's apparent son, Gofraid Crobán (died 1095)a future ruler of Dublin and the Islesbacked the Norwegian invasion of England led by Magnús' father in 1066.|$|E
5|$|If Echmarcach was {{a son of}} Ragnall mac Gofraid, this {{alliance}} with the Uí Briain {{would have been a}} continuation of amiable relations between the two families. For example, the father of Ragnall mac Gofraid appears to have combined forces with Brian Bóruma in 984, and Ragnall mac Gofraid himself is recorded to have died in Munster, the heartland of the Uí Briain. If, on the other hand, Echmarcach and Cacht were descended from the Waterford dynasty, an alliance between the Uí Briain and this family may have been undertaken {{in the context of a}} struggle between the Uí Briain and the Uí Cheinnselaig. The contemporary leader of the latter kindred was Donnchad's principal opponent, Diarmait mac Maíl na mBó, King of Leinster (died 1072). Whilst the Uí Briain certainly allied themselves to Cacht and Echmarcach, Diarmait appears to <b>have</b> <b>backed</b> the descendants of Amlaíb Cuarán, a man whose family appear to have opposed Echmarcach at a latter date.|$|E

5|$|Peckham laid {{stress on}} discipline, which often {{resulted}} {{in conflict with}} his clergy. His first episcopal act was calling a council at Reading in July 1279 to implement ecclesiastical reform, but Peckham's specifying that a copy of Magna Carta should be hung in all cathedral and collegiate churches offended the king as an unnecessary intrusion into political affairs. Another ruling was on non-residence of clergy in their livings. The only exception Peckham was prepared to make on non-residence was if the clerk needed to go abroad to study. At the Parliament of Winchester in 1279, the archbishop compromised and Parliament invalidated any regulation of the council dealing with royal policies or power. The copies of Magna Carta were taken down. One reason the archbishop may <b>have</b> <b>backed</b> down {{was that he was}} in debt to the Italian banking family of the Riccardi, who also were bankers to Edward and the pope, and Peckham was under threat of excommunication from the pope unless he repaid the loans.|$|E

According to one commonly quoted theory, in January 1879 local Irishtown tenant farmers asked Daly {{to take up}} their cause against a landowner variously referred to as 'Canon Ulick Burke' or Bourke, or 'Canon Burke' or 'Father Burke', who had inherited a property with 22 tenants, all in arrears, had increased rents and had taken legal steps to evict them. Burke is then said to <b>have</b> <b>backed</b> down after the mass meeting and decreased rents.|$|E

TFG Premier Ali Mohammed Gedi raised the claim of foreign fighters present in Somalia to 5000. ICU commander Sheikh Ahmed Hassan Abuu Rayan stated he was positioning an unspecified number more militia troops along the border with Ethiopia in Far Libah town, Hiran region. ICU forces were also said to be approaching Bardhere in Gedo province near the Kenyan border. Colonel Abdulahi Sheik Fara-Tag was named as the commander of the TFG forces defending the town from attack.|$|E
25|$|After a pro-independence {{coalition}} {{formed by}} the Junts pel Sí alliance and the Popular Unity Candidacy won a slim majority in the Parliament in the 2015 regional election, Carles Puigdemont replaced Mas as President of the Generalitat. Puigdemont promised to organise a binding independence referendum based on results from a multi-question, non-binding vote in 2014, when about 80% of those who voted were believed to <b>have</b> <b>backed</b> independence for the region, and up to 91.8% supported Catalonia becoming a state—albeit on an estimated turnout around or below 40%. The Catalan government invoked the right of people to self-determination and Catalonia's political, economical and cultural background to back up its proposal for a referendum on Catalan independence. The Government of Spain, now with Mariano Rajoy as Prime Minister, opposed such a vote, arguing that any referendum on Catalan independence would go against the country's 1978 Constitution, as it made no provision for a vote on self-determination.|$|E

500|$|Æthelbald's {{rebellion}} {{was supported}} by Ealhstan, Bishop of Sherborne, and Eanwulf, ealdorman of Somerset, even though {{they appear to have}} been two of the king's most trusted advisers. According to Asser, the plot was concerted [...] "in the western part of Selwood", and western nobles may <b>have</b> <b>backed</b> Æthelbald because they resented the patronage Æthelwulf gave to eastern Wessex. Asser also stated that Æthelwulf agreed to give up the western part of his kingdom in order to avoid a civil war. Some historians such as Keynes and Abels think that his rule was then confined to the south-east, while others such as Kirby think {{it is more likely that}} it was Wessex itself which was divided, with Æthelbald keeping Wessex west of Selwood, Æthelwulf holding the centre and east, and Æthelberht keeping the south-east. Æthelwulf insisted that Judith should sit beside him on the throne until the end of his life, and according to Asser this was [...] "without any disagreement or dissatisfaction on the part of his nobles".|$|E

The Moving Picture World stated, [...] "The dramatic qualities {{of this film}} are high, but the subject is somewhat depressing...

It ought to, at any rate, because that story is plainly wrought out and is apparent as it is possible to make it." [...] A review in The Nickelodeon offered little more than a summary of the film, but the reviewer found the subject to be enhanced by the attention to detail in the production. The reviewer was also pleased that the child was not brought in to serve as in deus ex machina role. Though Lonergan was fond of using the technique. Even The New York Dramatic Mirror gave some praise to the production, but noted that the acting of the mother's friend was the weakest because [...] " [...] man of his [...] wouldn't <b>have</b> <b>backed</b> off so quickly." [...] Overall, the reviewer found the acting to be better than the narrative itself and concluded that [...] "omething less laboredly sentimental would be much stronger." ...|$|E
