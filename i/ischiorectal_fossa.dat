40|$|The {{efficacy}} of a multimodal analgesic approach for ligation excision haemorrhoidectomy was evaluated in a prospective series of 62 patients. Opioid was given as intravenous fentanyl intra-operatively, {{as part of}} a standardised general anaesthetic technique, followed by post-operative parenteral fentanyl or oral oxycodone as required. Pre-emptive local anaesthesia was provided via <b>ischiorectal</b> <b>fossae</b> and haemorrhoid pedicle infiltration. The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug indomethacin was administered rectally at the end of surgery and regularly orally for 5 post-operative days. A wide range of pain scores was recorded post-operatively but all mean scores were between 2 and 3. Pain was highest {{at the time of the}} first bowel action but this was successfully managed in the patient's home. Patient satisfaction with their pain management was achieved in 95 % of patients. We conclude that the multimodal analgesia technique combined with pre-operative patient education leads to successful pain control following haemorrhoidectomy...|$|R
40|$|Horse-shoe Fistula {{is a big}} {{challenge}} for both Modern and Ayurvedic Surgeons. We can correlate this with ‘Shambukawarta Bhagandara’ described by Sushruta. Here, fistula forms secondary to an ischiorectal abscess and both the <b>ischiorectal</b> <b>fossae</b> are involved. Also, they open posteriorly into the anal canal, at the 6 o’clock position, and {{are associated with a}} big cavity lying superior (above the levatorani). Therefore, in such a clinical feature neither Fistulotomy (‘Wanley operation’) nor ‘Ksharasutra’ treatment alone, prove useful. After going through this, we can say that there is a definite need for newer surgical innovative techniques, to tackle this challenging disease. An integral approach of ‘Fistulectomy along the arms of the Horse-shoe fistula with Ksharasutra ligation’ in the remaining track connected to the anal canal, and drainage of the postanal space abscess, proved to be very successful. We have tried the same technique with very good results. No recurrence was found in the patients during the follow-up period of three years.

PRESENTATION OF CASEA 74 -year-old man was admitted to our institute because of a large perianal tumor. A pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an 8 cm× 7 cm× 5 cm sized encapsulated heterogeneous tumor {{on the right side}} of the <b>ischiorectal</b> <b>fossa.</b> Transsacral excision was performed under a diagnosis of liposarcoma. The tumor was partially fixed to the external sphincter and puborectalis. Therefore, the muscles were partially resected to ensure sufficient margins. Histopathological examination revealed a well differentiated liposarcoma and negative surgical margins. DISCUSSIONThe basic treatment strategy of liposarcoma is surgical resection, whereas the effects of chemotherapy or radiotherapy remain limited. Although no postoperative adjuvant therapy has been performed in our case, no recurrences have occurred for 1 year after surgery. CONCLUSIONAlthough the curative resection of large tumors located in the <b>ischiorectal</b> <b>fossa</b> is usually difficult, the complete resection of liposarcoma is the main potentially curative treatment.

Methods In eight patients, we incorporated a type III internal hemipelvectomy to achieve an en bloc R 0 resection for tumors extending through the obturator foramen or into the <b>ischiorectal</b> <b>fossa.</b> The pelvic ring was reconstructed utilizing marlex mesh. This allowed for pelvic stability and abdominal wall reconstruction with obliteration of the obturator space to prevent herniations. Results All eight patients had an R 0 resection with an overall survival of 88 % and with average follow up of 9. 5 years. Functional evaluation utilizing the Enneking classification system, which evaluates motion, pain, stability and strength of the affected extremity, revealed a 62 % excellent result and a 37 % good result.

40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONPeri-anal fistulae {{commonly}} {{present with}} collections requiring surgical intervention. The {{most common cause}} of a peri-anal mass is abscess formation secondary to anal gland sepsis. In certain patient groups such as those over 65 or with atypical presenting symptoms there are other important considerations. PRESENTATION OF CASEA 70 -year old male was referred by his general practitioner with symptoms of obstructed defaecation and a palpable mass in the <b>ischiorectal</b> <b>fossa.</b> He had previously undergone three operations for complex peri-anal fistulae in another hospital. Due to the previous history of surgery, seroma formation was considered and computed tomography guided drainage of the lesion was performed unsuccessfully. Given symptoms of obstructed defecation and need for histological diagnosis excision was undertaken. The approach was through a right pararectal incision over the bulk of the mass. Skin and pararectal tissue were divided revealing a mucinous lesion with multiple lobules adherent to pararectal tissue. Following histopathological examination a diagnosis of low grade mucinous neoplasm was made. DISCUSSIONPrimary mucinous neoplasm in the <b>ischiorectal</b> <b>fossa</b> is very rare. Diagnostic criteria for adenocarcinoma arising from perianal fistulae have previously been established by Rosser et al. but this lesion does not fall into this category. It is categorised as a mucinous cystic neoplasm of uncertain malignant potential. The differential diagnoses are discussed. CONCLUSIONConsideration should be given to a range of pathologies in cases of atypical peri-anal masses...|$|E
30|$|Tumors {{involving}} the <b>ischiorectal</b> <b>fossa</b> {{are most often}} secondary to direct extensions of primary anorectal, prostate, and sacral tumors [4]. Primary tumors are rare and diverse, benign (e.g., aggressive angiomyxomas [4 – 6], plexiform neurofibromas [4, 6], GIST [5, 6], leiomyomas [7]) to malignant (e.g., metastatic disease [4], lymphomas [5], liposarcomas [5], epithelioid sarcomas [5]). In these primary tumors, solid well-circumscribed and slow-growing tumors are often benign and tend to be followed up depending on their size. Most SFTs are also benign, but approximately 10 – 15 % of SFTs are malignant, recurring locally or as metastases [5].|$|E
30|$|The {{technique}} {{reinforces the}} uterosacral ligament by placing polypropylene tape between the perineum and the vaginal vault. A vertical incision {{is made in}} the vault and the IVS Tunneller (Tyco Health Care, USA) is used to place polypropylene tape as an inverted ‘U’ around the rectum and attach it behind the posterior vaginal wall. The tip of the tunneller is elevated and inserted into the <b>ischiorectal</b> <b>fossa</b> and through the rectovaginal fascia and into the vaginal incision. The tip of the tunnelling device is guided by a finger positioned in the vaginal incision. Vaginal and rectal examinations are performed before and after the insertion to ensure correct placement of the tape and to exclude damage to the rectum. The apical portion of the tape is anchored to each corner of the vault at the estimated insertion site of the uterosacral ligament [7].|$|E
30|$|Sensory {{supply to}} the vulvar, perineal and perianal skin, and {{subcutaneous}} tissue of the lower two-thirds of the vagina is the pudendal nerve (PN). The pudendal nerve is a sensory and somatic nerve which originates from the ventral rami of the second to fourth (and occasionally fifth) sacral nerve roots. After branching from the sacral plexus, the nerve leaves the pelvis through the great sciatic notch, re-enters the pelvic cavity through the lesser sciatic notch, and finally travels to three main regions: the gluteal region, the pudendal canal, and the perineum. It accompanies the internal pudendal vessels upward and forward along the lateral wall of the <b>ischiorectal</b> <b>fossa,</b> being contained in a sheath of the obturator fascia termed the pudendal canal (Alcock’s canal). The pudendal nerve gives off three distal branches—the inferior rectal nerve, the perineal nerve, and the dorsal nerve of the penis (in males) or the dorsal nerve of the clitoris (in females).|$|E
40|$|International audienceSince the {{implementation}} of preoperative chemoradiotherapy and mesorectal excision, the 5 -year rates of locoregional failures in T 3 -T 4 N 0 -N 1 M 0 rectal cancer fell from 25 - 30 % thirty years ago to 5 - 8 % nowadays. A critical analysis of the locoregional failures sites and mechanisms, {{as well as the}} identification of nodal extension, helps the radiation oncologist to optimize the radiotherapy target definition. The upper limit of the clinical target volume is usually set {{at the top of the}} third sacral vertebra. The lateral pelvic nodes should be included when the tumor is located in the distal part of the rectum. The anal sphincter and the levator muscles should be spared when a conservative surgery is planned. In case of abdominoperineal excision, the <b>ischiorectal</b> <b>fossa</b> and the sphincters should be included in the clinical target volume.

30|$|Typical SFTs show an {{architecture}} {{characterized by a}} combination of alternating hypocellular and hypercellular areas separated by thick bands of hyalinized, somewhat keloidal collagen and branching hemangiopericytoma-like vessels. Myxoid changes, areas of fibrosis, and interstitial mast cells are commonly observed. Some SFTs may contain mature adipocytes and/or giant multinucleated stromal cells, thus overlapping morphologically with the so-called lipomatous hemangiopericytomas and giant cell angiofibromas. Malignant SFTs are usually hypercellular lesions showing at least focally moderate to marked cytological atypia, tumor necrosis, numerous mitoses (≥[*] 4 mitoses per ten HPF) and/or infiltrative margins [8]. Tumor cells in SFTs are characteristically immunoreactive for CD 34 (90 to 95 % of cases) and CD 99 (70 %). Twenty to 35 % of SFTs are positive for EMA, BCL 2, and SMA [8]. Because of their rarity, reports detailing radiological findings of SFTs of the <b>ischiorectal</b> <b>fossa</b> are few [3, 5, 9].

30|$|During {{the last}} 6  years, we have {{performed}} more than 500 laparoscopic para-aortic and pelvic lymphadenectomies for gynecological malignancies. Our technique of laparoscopic para-aortic and pelvic lymphadenectomy {{in women with}} cervical cancer was applied as described elsewhere [4]. During all these procedures, special {{attention was paid to}} the exposure of different pelvic nerves. Since we developed the nerve-sparing modification of laparoscopic-assisted radical vaginal hysterectomy for cervical cancer [1], systematic laparoscopic exposure of different pelvic nerves during lymphadenectomy has been performed. The superior hypogastric plexus should be identified as an intricate meshwork of nerve fibers embedded in the connective/fat tissue of the mesocolon dorsal of the inferior mesenteric artery. At the level of the aortic bifurcation, the plexus diverges into both inferior hypogastric nerves, curving outwards, downwards and backwards into the mesosigmoid, ventral to Waldeyer’s fascia. The left sympathetic trunk is easily exposed lateral to the aorta, while the right trunk is covered by the inferior cave vein. By transfixing the sacral hypogastric fascia dorsal to the cardinal “ligament” and caudal to the medial rectal artery, the splanchnic pelvic nerves should be exposed. More laterally, by dividing the fibers of the isciococcygeal muscle, the <b>ischiorectal</b> <b>fossa</b> is opened and the pudendal nerve or its branches can be identified.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of Bakri balloon as a hemostatic device in severe postpartum hemorrhage due to complicated vaginal-perineal hematoma not responsive to standard surgical treatments. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The article discusses an effective and minimally invasive technique for resolving a case of massive vaginal-perineal bleeding after vaginal delivery complicated by <b>ischiorectal</b> <b>fossa</b> hematoma. A 36 -year-old primipara white woman, 41 weeks 1 day pregnant, was admitted to our unit for beginning of labor. She experienced a precipitous delivery of a healthy male baby (3. 72 kg, 51 cm in length), and spontaneous complete afterbirth of placenta and membranes. The intervention involved positioning of an hemostatic Bakri balloon device in the vagina, to compress the vaginal wall, ensuring that the draining apex was well positioned into the uterine cervix. RESULTS: The patient was discharged after having a puerperal course without further complications. CONCLUSIONS: Vaginal hemostatic Bakri balloon device shows hemostatic efficacy immediately assessable, is promptly removable, not interfering with subsequent surgical or radiological procedures, does not increase the risk of infections as other compressive procedures, allows flow of lochia, does not cause pain or discomfort in women, and permits adjustable compression when a drainage is placed during surgery.
