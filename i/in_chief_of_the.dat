As a result of his promotion, he was then the top ranking soldier of all Germany {{until the end of the}} war.

On 28 April, they ordered Thomas Fairfax, the Commander <b>in</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recently established New Model Army, to relieve the town. Fairfax marched with the whole of his army towards Taunton; the Royalists considered sending their own army to meet him before he could reach London, but Prince Rupert convinced them instead to focus on conquering the north of England. In response to the Royalist movement north, Fairfax split his own army in two, sending a force of between 6,000 and 7,000 on to Taunton under Colonel Ralph Weldon, while Fairfax led the rest north.|$|E

The following year, the Mediterranean Fleet was reorganized into three squadrons; Brennus again repeated her role as flagship, of the Third Squadron, {{under the command of}} Rear Admiral Germinet. Due to her age and condition by the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, Brennus was not mobilized and did not see action.

5|$|Defections by {{units of}} the Greek Navy to the Venizelist factions {{provoked}} a Royalist purge of Venizelist officers and men from the Greek Navy. French Admiral Fournet, the Commander <b>in</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Allied Squadron, perceived the Greek fleet as a menace to the Entente powers in the Aegean. He delivered an ultimatum to the Greeks to sequester the small ships and disable the large ones. On 19 October 1916, the breech blocks, munitions, and torpedoes were removed from Limnos and Kilkis. At the same time, the crews were reduced to one-third of normal size.|$|E

5|$|During the Bahraini {{uprising}} of 2011, the Khawalid brothers {{objected to}} {{compromise with the}} opposition and instead preferred crackdown. After a failed round of negotiations led by the CP, the Khawalid brothers led the crackdown, described as the widest in Bahrain's modern history. The Commander <b>in</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> army, Khalifa bin Ahmed, was given wide authority with the announcement of martial law; he led a main crackdown operation, presided over military courts and made several interviews with regional and local media. Another Al Khawalid involved in the crackdown was the then-director of the National Security Agency, which {{was found to be}} responsible for arbitrary arrests and systematic torture. The crackdown empowered the Khawalid brothers faction further and marginalized the CP, who found himself and allies stripped from their powers.|$|E

5|$|However, {{problems}} arose due to {{the inability}} of contemporary naval technology to simultaneously meet the requirements for weight, speed, range and armament. On 8 April 1938 German Grand Admiral Erich Raeder, the commander <b>in</b> <b>chief</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kriegsmarine, informed the Oberkommando der Marine (German Naval High Command) that the Type 1937J design work was to be stopped, and that a further eight Type 36 destroyers were to be built instead. Although no ships of the Type 1937J were ever ordered or laid down, they influenced the later project studies: the Type 1938Ac, 1938Ad, and 1938B destroyers.|$|E
