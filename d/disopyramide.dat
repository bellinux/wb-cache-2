50|$|<b>Disopyramide</b> (INN, {{trade names}} Norpace and Rythmodan) is an {{antiarrhythmic}} medication {{used in the}} treatment of ventricular tachycardia. It is a sodium channel blocker and therefore classified as a Class 1a anti-arrhythmic agent. <b>Disopyramide</b> has a negative inotropic effect on the ventricular myocardium, significantly decreasing the contractility. <b>Disopyramide</b> also has an anticholinergic effect on the heart which accounts for many adverse side effects. <b>Disopyramide</b> is available in both oral and intravenous forms, and has a low degree of toxicity.|$|E
50|$|Acute {{heart failure}} - <b>Disopyramide</b> {{should not be}} given to {{patients}} with impaired LV systolic function and low ejection fraction. Heart failure is not seen when <b>disopyramide</b> is used in patients with normal or supernormal LV systolic function.|$|E
50|$|<b>Disopyramide,</b> {{despite its}} efficacy, has one main side effect that has limited {{its use in}} the US, though it has seen wider {{application}} in Canada, UK and Japan. Vagal blockade predictably causes dry mouth, and in men with prostatism, may cause urinary retention. Teichman et al. showed that pyridostigmine used in combination with <b>disopyramide</b> substantially alleviates vagolytic side effects without compromising antiarrhythmic efficacy. This combination {{has also been shown}} to be effective and safe in obstructive HCM in a large cohort of patients. Some clinicians prescribe pyridostigmine sustained release (marketed in the US as Mestinon Timespan) to every patient begun on <b>disopyramide.</b> This combination increases acceptance of higher <b>disopyramide</b> dosing, important since there is a dose-response correlation in obstructive HCM, higher doses yielding lower gradients.|$|E

50|$|Additionally, <b>disopyramide</b> {{may enhance}} the {{hypoglycaemic}} effect of gliclazide, insulin, and metformin.|$|E
50|$|Disopyramide’s Class 1a {{activity}} {{is similar to}} that of quinidine in that it targets sodium channels to inhibit conduction. <b>Disopyramide</b> depresses the increase in sodium permeability of the cardiac Myocyte during Phase 0 of the cardiac action potential, in turn decreasing the inward sodium current. This results in an increased threshold for excitation and a decreased upstroke velocity. <b>Disopyramide</b> prolongs the PR interval by lengthening both the QRS and P wave duration. This effect is particularly well suited in the treatment of ventricular tachycardia as it slows the action potential propagation through the atria to the ventricles. <b>Disopyramide</b> does not act as a blocking agent for beta or alpha adrenergic receptors, but does have a significant negative inotropic effect on the ventricular myocardium. As a result, the use of <b>disopyramide</b> may reduce contractile force up to 42% at low doses and up to 100% in higher doses leading to heart failure.|$|E

50|$|For {{selected}} patients, a {{trial of}} oral <b>disopyramide</b> is a reasonable approach before proceeding to invasive septal reduction. Patients who respond to <b>disopyramide</b> are continued on the drug. Those who continue to have disabling symptoms or who experience side effects are promptly referred for septal reduction. Using such a stepped strategy, investigators have reported that survival does not differ from that observed in the age-matched normal United States population.|$|E
50|$|Negative inotropes improve LV {{obstruction}} by decreasing LV ejection {{acceleration and}} hydrodynamic {{forces on the}} mitral valve. Disopyramide’s particular efficacy is due to its potent negative inotropic effects; in head-to-head comparison, it is more effective for gradient reduction than either beta-blocker or verapamil. <b>Disopyramide</b> is most often administered with beta-blockade. When used in patients resistant to beta-blockade, <b>disopyramide</b> is effective in 60% of cases, reducing symptoms and gradient {{to the extent that}} invasive procedures such as surgical septal myectomy are not required.|$|E
50|$|Levites {{proposed}} a possible secondary {{mode of action}} for <b>disopyramide,</b> against reentrant arrhythmias after an ischemic insult. <b>Disopyramide</b> decreases the inhomogeneity between infarcted and normal myocardium refractory periods; in addition to lengthening the refractory period. This decreases the chance of re-entry depolarization, because signals {{are more likely to}} encounter tissue in a refractory state which cannot be excited. This provides a possible treatment for atrial and ventricular fibrillation, as it restores pacemaker control of the tissue to the SA and AV nodes.|$|E
5000|$|Medications {{which may}} be {{effective}} include: CNS stimulants fludrocortisone, midodrine, SSRIs such as paroxetine or sertraline, <b>disopyramide,</b> and, in health-care settings where a syncope is anticipated, atropine epinephrine (adrenaline).|$|E

50|$|Hypertrophic {{cardiomyopathy}} (HCM) is {{the most}} common inherited cardiac disease, occurring in 1:500 individuals in the general population. It is estimated that there are 600,000 individuals in the United States with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The most common variant of HCM presents with left ventricular (LV) intracavitary obstruction due to systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve, and mitral-septal contact, diagnosed readily with echocardiography. Pharmacologic treatment with negative inotropic drugs is first-line therapy. Beta-blockers are used first, and while they improve symptoms of shortness of breath, chest pain and exercise intolerance, they do not reduce resting LV intraventricular pressure gradients and often are inadequate to control symptoms. Many investigators and clinicians believe that <b>disopyramide</b> controlled release {{is the most}} potent agent available for reducing resting pressure gradients and improving symptoms. <b>Disopyramide</b> has been actively used for more than 30 years. <b>Disopyramide</b> administration for obstructive HCM has a IIa recommendation in the 2011 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology Foundation guidelines for treatment of obstructive HCM. A IIa treatment recommendation indicates that benefits outweigh risk, and that it is reasonable to administer treatment.|$|E
50|$|Because {{it affects}} {{voltage-gated}} ion channels, it is contraindicated {{in people with}} long QT syndrome and in people taking a drug that might prolong QT like sultopride, <b>disopyramide,</b> cisapride, domperidone, rifampicin or ketoconazol. It is also contraindicated in people with epilepsy or badly controlled asthma.|$|E
50|$|Another {{concern about}} <b>disopyramide</b> {{has been the}} {{hypothetical}} potential for inducing sudden death from its type 1 anti-arrhythmic effects. However, a multicenter registry and two recent cohort registries have largely reduced this concern, by showing sudden death rates lower than that observed from the disease itself.|$|E
50|$|Repolarization of the cardiomyocytes {{occurs in}} phases 1-3, and is caused {{predominantly}} by the outward movement of potassium ions. In Torsades de pointes, however, the repolarization is prolonged; {{this can be}} due to electrolyte disturbances (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia), bradycardia, certain drugs (<b>disopyramide,</b> sotalol, amiodarone, amitriptyline, chlorpromazine, erythromycin) and/or congenital syndromes (LQT1-LQT4 gene defect).|$|E
50|$|These {{concerns}} about the drug must be viewed from the clinical perspective that <b>disopyramide</b> is generally the last agent that is tried for patients before they are referred for invasive septal reduction with surgical septal myectomy (an open-heart operation) or alcohol septal ablation (a controlled heart attack). Both of these invasive procedures have risk of morbidity and mortality.|$|E
50|$|Moracizine, a {{phenothiazine}} derivative, undergoes extensive first-pass {{metabolism and}} is also extensively metabolized after it has entered the circulation. It may have pharmacologically active metabolites. A clinical study has shown that moracizine is slightly less effective than encainide or flecainide in suppressing ventricular premature depolarizations. Compared with <b>disopyramide</b> and quinidine, moracizine was equally or more effective in suppressing premature ventricular contractions, couplets, and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.|$|E
50|$|Class I {{agents are}} sodium (Na) channel {{blockers}} (which slow conduction by blocking the Na+ channel) and {{are divided into}} 3 subclasses a, b and c. Class Ia slows phase 0 depolarization in the ventricles and increases the absolute refractory period. Procainamide, quinidine and <b>disopyramide</b> are Class Ia agents. Class 1b drugs lengthen phase 3 repolarization. They include lidocaine, mexiletine and phenytoin. Class Ic greatly slow phase 0 depolarization in the ventricles (however unlike 1a {{have no effect on}} the refractory period). Flecainide, moricizine and propafenone are Class Ic agents.|$|E
5000|$|... 2-chloropyridine is {{primarily}} {{used to generate}} other pyridine derivatives. Some commercial products include pyrithione, pyripropoxyfen, chlorphenamine, and <b>disopyramide.</b> These reactions rely on chloride’s nature as a good leaving group to facilitate the transfer of a substrate onto the pyridine ring. [...] Pyrithione, the conjugate base of 2-mercaptopyridine-N-oxide, is a fungicide found in some shampoos. It is generated from 2-chloropyridine by reacting the N-oxide of 2-chloropyridine with Na2S in a basic solution, before adding aqueous HCl. [...] Used as an antihistamine, pheniramine may be generated via several different pathways. One synthesis is to hydroformylate functionalized olefins. This reaction proceeds by reacting phenylacetonitrile with 2-chloropyridine {{in the presence of}} a base. The resulting intermediate is then alkylated by 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl chloride and the cyano group removed.|$|E
50|$|The {{primary goal}} of {{medications}} is to relieve symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, and palpitations. Beta blockers are considered first-line agents, as they can slow down the heart rate and decrease the likelihood of ectopic beats. For patients who cannot tolerate beta blockers, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers such as verapamil can be used, but are potentially harmful in patients in a setting of low blood pressure or severe shortness of breath at rest. These medications also decrease the heart rate, though their use in patients with severe outflow obstruction, elevated pulmonary artery wedge pressure, and low blood pressures {{should be done with}} caution. Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers should be avoided in patients with evidence of obstruction. For patients whose symptoms are not relieved by the above treatments, <b>disopyramide</b> can be considered for further symptom relief. Diuretics can be considered for patients with evidence of fluid overload, though cautiously used in those with evidence of obstruction. Patients who continue to have symptoms despite drug therapy can consider more invasive therapies. Intravenous phenylephrine (or another pure vasoconstricting agent) can be used in the acute setting of low blood pressure in those with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who do not respond to fluid administration.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{efficacy}} and tolerance of <b>disopyramide</b> and mexiletine used alone and in combination were studied in 21 patients with frequent (≥ 30 /h) ventricular premature complexes. Ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring was performed at baseline and during therapy with <b>disopyramide</b> alone, mexiletine alone and {{a combination of}} <b>disopyramide</b> and mexiletine. During single drug therapy, the dose of <b>disopyramide</b> was 602 +- 152 mg/day and that of mexiletine was 738 ± 144 mg/day. During combination therapy with smaller doses of <b>disopyramide</b> (524 ± 134 mg/day) and mexiletine (652 ± 146 mg/day), no patient had side effects. At baseline before therapy, {{the mean number of}} ventricular premature complexes per hour, was 608 ± 757, of couplets per hour was 22. 4 ± 45. 8 and of episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia/ 24 h was 219. 7 ± 758. 2. The mean number of ventricular premature complexes per hour was reduced to 156 ± 217 with <b>disopyramide</b> alone, 188 ± 298 with mexiletine alone and 76 ± 144 with combination therapy (p; 83 % reduction in ventricular premature complexes and abolition of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia) was found in 5 (24 %) of 21 patients during therapy with <b>disopyramide</b> alone, in 3 (14 %) receiving mexiletine alone and in 13 (62 %) receiving combination therapy (p < 0. 05 for combination therapy versus <b>disopyramide</b> or mexiletine; p = NS for <b>disopyramide</b> versus mexiletine). Thus, the antiarrhythmic effects of <b>disopyramide</b> and mexiletine are additive. A combination of <b>disopyramide</b> and mexiletine in smaller and well tolerated doses may avoid dose-related side effects and is more effective than either drug used alone at higher doses. Therefore, when <b>disopyramide</b> or mexiletine is ineffective because dose-related side effects limit the maximal tolerated dose, combination therapy in smaller and more tolerable doses may avoid side effects and may be more effective than treatment with either drug alone at the maximal tolerated dose...|$|E
40|$|<b>Disopyramide</b> is {{a widely}} used and {{effective}} drug for treatment of ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias (1, 2).

40|$|ObjectivesIn {{this study}} we {{assessed}} the long-term efficacy and safety of <b>disopyramide</b> for patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). BackgroundIt {{has been reported that}} <b>disopyramide</b> may reduce left ventricular outflow gradient and improve symptoms in patients with HCM. However, long-term efficacy and safety of <b>disopyramide</b> has not been shown in a large cohort. MethodsClinical and echocardiographic data were evaluated in 118 obstructive HCM patients treated with <b>disopyramide</b> at 4 HCM treatment centers. Mortality in the disopyramide-treated patients was compared with 373 obstructive HCM patients not treated with <b>disopyramide.</b> ResultsPatients were followed with <b>disopyramide</b> for 3. 1 ± 2. 6 years; dose 432 ± 181 mg/day (97 % also received beta-blockers). Seventy-eight patients (66 %) were maintained with <b>disopyramide</b> without the necessity for major non-pharmacologic intervention with surgical myectomy, alcohol ablation, or pacing; outflow gradient at rest decreased from 75 ± 33 to 40 ± 32 mm Hg (p < 0. 0001) and mean New York Heart Association functional class from 2. 3 ± 0. 7 to 1. 7 ± 0. 6 (p < 0. 0001). Forty other patients (34 %) could not be satisfactorily managed with <b>disopyramide</b> and required major invasive interventions because of inadequate symptom and gradient control or vagolytic side effects. All-cause annual cardiac death rate between <b>disopyramide</b> and non-disopyramide-treated patients did not differ significantly, 1. 4 % versus 2. 6 %/year (p = 0. 07). There was also no difference in sudden death rate, 1. 0 %/year versus 1. 8 %/year (p = 0. 08). ConclusionsTwo-thirds of obstructed HCM patients treated with <b>disopyramide</b> could be managed medically with amelioration of symptoms and about 50 % reduction in subaortic gradient over ≥ 3 years. <b>Disopyramide</b> therapy {{does not appear to be}} proarrhythmic in HCM and should be considered before proceeding to surgical myectomy or alternate strategies...|$|E

Treatment was commenced with 24 hr of onset of symptoms (mean time to first dose 9 hr) and continued until discharge from hospital or 14 days, whichever came first. Nine-hundred and ninety-five patients were allocated to <b>disopyramide</b> and 990 to placebo. The overall mortality, calculated on an intention-to-treat basis, was 7. 2 % for the <b>disopyramide</b> and 5. 6 % for the placebo patients.

40|$|The {{steady state}} serum levels of <b>disopyramide</b> and its metabolite, mono-N-dealkylated <b>disopyramide</b> (MND) were {{measured}} by gas-liquid chromatography in 40 patients receiving maintenance <b>disopyramide</b> treatment.

The serum levels of anticholinergic activity varied between 0 and 6. 7 ng/ml when measured as atropine equivalent (mean 1. 88 +/- 0. 26, s. e. mean, ng/ml). After a single oral dose of <b>disopyramide</b> the serum anticholinergic activity was, however, not detectable or very low. There was a significant correlation between <b>disopyramide</b> concentrations in serum and the serum anticholinergic activity (r = 0. 655, P less than 0. 001).

40|$|SUMMARY <b>Disopyramide</b> resembles {{quinidine}} electrophysiologically, but {{its effect}} on left ventricular func-tion has not been clarified. Twelve awake dogs were instrumented for measurement of cardiac output, left ven-tricular pressure and its maximal first derivative (dP/dt max), and left atrial and aortic pressures. <b>Disopyramide</b> or quinidine at identical, clinically relevant doses (1 and 5 mg/kg i. v.) was infused over 5 minutes at each level. Peak changes after <b>disopyramide</b> I mg/kg included increases in heart rate (34 %), mean aortic pressure (24 %) and systemic vascular resistance (33 %), and decreases in stroke volume (16 %) and dP/dt max (19 %). With <b>disopyramide</b> at 5 mg/kg these changes were of greater magnitude (e. g., dP/dt- 36 %). Quinidine at both doses caused no changes except a 13 % decrease in vascular resistance at 5 mg/kg. Heart rate with <b>disopyramide</b> increased after propranolol (1 mg/kg i. v.), was unchanged after atropine (0. 1 mg/kg i. v.), and slowed after propranolol and atropine. Phenoxybenzamine (2 mg/kg i. v.) did not prevent the rise in systemic vascular resistance produced by <b>disopyramide.</b> Thus, <b>disopyramide</b> in clinical dosages exerts op-posing direct and indirect effects on cardiac pacemakers and, unlike quinidine, is a potent myocardial depres-sant and vasoconstrictor in the conscious dog. <b>DISOPYRAMIDE</b> is a recently released anti-arrhythmic agent whose direct electrophysiologi...|$|E
40|$|The plasma {{and breast}} milk were sampled {{from a woman}} who was {{breastfeeding}} whilst taking <b>disopyramide</b> (200 mg three times daily).

The estimated dose likely to be ingested by an infant is less than 2 mg kg- 1 day- 1. The active N-monodesalkyl metabolite of <b>disopyramide</b> (NMD) although present in plasma in much smaller concentrations than the parent compound, was excreted in breast milk (mean +/- s. d. milk: plasma ratio 5. 6 +/ 2. 9) in concentrations similar to those of <b>disopyramide.</b> The pharmacological and toxicological properties of the <b>disopyramide</b> metabolite need to be considered when assessing likely effects on the infant.

40|$|Safety and {{efficacy}} of propafenone and <b>disopyramide</b> for long-term maintenance of sinus rhythm after electrical cardioversion was studied in 56 patients with chronic atrial fibrillation (median arrhythmia duration, 5 months). After cardioversion, patients {{were randomly assigned to}} receive double-blind propafenone 300 mg tid (25 patients) or <b>disopyramide</b> 250 mg tid (31 patients). Downward dose adjustment was allowed in case of intolerable side effects. The endpoints were arrhythmia recurrence; and side effects not amenable to dose reduction. For patients randomized to propafenone (mean dose, 878 +/- 65 mg/day), 66 % [95 % confidence interval [(CI) 46 - 85 %] and 55 % (95 % CI, 34 - 76 %) remained in sinus rhythm at 3 and 6 months, respectively (Kaplan-Meier method). Similar figures were found with <b>disopyramide</b> (mean dose, 704 +/- 81 mg/day) : 71 % (95 % CI, 54 - 87 %) and 67 % (95 % CI, 50 - 84 %) at 3 and 6 months, respectively (p = NS). In the patients with a relapse of atrial fibrillation, the ventricular rate while still using the prophylactic agents did not increase significantly compared with precardioversion. However, one patient on <b>disopyramide</b> had an excessively high relapse heart rate (170 vs. 100 beats/min). Side effects were more frequent on <b>disopyramide.</b> Side effects necessitating drug discontinuation occurred in 12 patients: 4 patients (16 %) on propafenone and 8 (26 %) on <b>disopyramide.</b> Severe adverse effects occurred in two patients, who developed heart failure while on <b>disopyramide.</b> There were no proarrhythmic events or deaths. Thus, propafenone and <b>disopyramide</b> are equally effective for maintaining sinus rhythm after cardioversion of atrial fibrillation.

40|$|The {{electrophysiologic}} {{actions of}} <b>disopyramide</b> phosphate on reentrant ventricular tachycardia induced by premature ventricular stimuli were evaluated in conscious dogs 2 to 4 days after myocardial infarction. <b>Disopyramide</b> was administered {{as a series}} of intravenous infusions to obtain successive steady state plasma <b>disopyramide</b> concentrations of 1. 02 +/- 0. 02, 2. 05 +/- 0. 08, 3. 94 +/- 0. 09 and 7. 69 +/- 0. 18 [mu]g/ml (mean values +/- standard error of the mean). <b>Disopyramide</b> plasma concentrations of 1. 02 +/- 0. 02 [mu]g/ml produced an increase in the rate and duration of ventricular tachycardia {{as well as in the}} interval during which premature ventricular stimuli produced ventricular tachycardia. The effective refractory period of normal myocardium was decreased and conduction (activation time) was improved in ischemic myocardium. Increasing steady state plasma <b>disopyramide</b> concentrations slowed the rate of ventricular tachycardia without decreasing its duration. Slowing of the rate of tachycardia occurred simultaneously with a depression of conduction in normal and ischemic myocardium and an increase in ventricular refractoriness. Induction of ventricular tachycardia was prevented only at steady state plasma <b>disopyramide</b> concentrations of 7. 69 +/- 0. 18 [mu]g/ml.
