The thymic size at 12 months of age was not significantly different between the HIV-EU group and the control <b>infants</b> (P= 0. 56). At 4 months of age, the HIV-EU <b>infants</b> had significantly fewer infections than the control <b>infants</b> (P< 0. 001). Furthermore, in the control group, the <b>infants</b> exclusively breastfed at 4 months of age had significantly fewer infections at 8 months when compared to age-matched formula-fed <b>infants</b> (P= 0. 001). Conclusion. HIV-EU <b>infants</b> fed human donor milk have normal growth of thymus and contract fewer infections than other healthy <b>infants.</b> This finding along with fewer infections in exclusively breastfed <b>infants</b> compared to formula-fed <b>infants</b> supports the beneficial effect of human milk on the immune system.

40|$|Trisomy 21 (T 21), {{trisomy 18}} (T 18) and trisomy 13 (T 13) {{represent}} {{the most common}} autosomal trisomies detected in live-born <b>infants.</b> Previous studies have addressed interventions, morbidities and survival in term or near-term <b>infants</b> with T 21, T 18 or T 13, or were limited by {{a small number of}} patients. However, the combination of one of these chromosomal anomalies and very low birth weight (VLBW) presents greater challenges. Data from the NICHD Neonatal Research Network (NRN) and from the Vermont Oxford Network (VON) databases were used to examine the frequency, interventions, risk of mortality and neonatal morbidities, including patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), late onset sepsis (LOS), retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), among VLBW <b>infants</b> with T 21, T 18 or T 13 compared to VLBW <b>infants</b> without major birth defects (BD) and VLBW <b>infants</b> with non-chromosomal BD. Anthropometric VON charts for the assessment of birth weight for gestational age among 22 week to term <b>infants</b> with T 21, T 18 or T 13 were also developed. In the VON database (n= 539, 509), the frequency of VLBW <b>infants</b> diagnosed with T 21 was 1681 (0. 31 %), with T 18 was 1416 (0. 27 %), and with T 13 was 435 (0. 08 %). Major surgery was reported for 30. 4 % of <b>infants</b> with T 21, 9. 2 % with T 18, and 6. 8 % with T 13. In-hospital mortality occurred for 33. 1 % of <b>infants</b> with T 21, 89. 0 % with T 18, and 92. 4 % with T 13. Median survival time was 4 days (95 % CI: 3 - 4) among <b>infants</b> with T 18 and 3 days (95 % CI: 2 - 4) among <b>infants</b> with T 13. Birth weight for gestational age charts were created using VON data with a total of 5147 <b>infants</b> with T 21 aged 22 - 41 weeks, 1053 <b>infants</b> with T 18 aged 22 - 41 weeks, and 613 <b>infants</b> with T 13 aged 22 - 40 weeks. Among the three groups, <b>infants</b> with T 18 were the most likely to be growth restricted while <b>infants</b> with T 21 were the least likely to be growth restricted. The new anthropometric VON charts for <b>infants</b> with T 21 were also compared to the Lubchenco and Fenton charts and both showed frequent misclassification of <b>infants</b> with T 21 as small or large for gestational age. In the NICHD NRN database (n= 52, 259), 133 (0. 26 %) VLBW <b>infants</b> were diagnosed with T 21, 132 (0. 25 %) with T 18 and 40 (0. 08 %) with T 13. The adjusted relative risk, estimated using Poisson regression models with robust variance estimators, showed an increased risk of death, PDA, NEC, LOS, and BPD among <b>infants</b> with T 21 relative to <b>infants</b> with no BD. Relative to <b>infants</b> with non-chromosomal BD, <b>infants</b> with T 21 were at increased risk of PDA and NEC. A trend toward a lower risk of ROP was observed among <b>infants</b> with T 21 compared to <b>infants</b> with non-chromosomal BD and <b>infants</b> without major BD. <b>Infants</b> with T 13, but not <b>infants</b> with T 18, {{were less likely to be}} mechanically ventilated than <b>infants</b> with T 21 and <b>infants</b> without BD. <b>Infants</b> with T 18 had increased risk of PDA compared to <b>infants</b> with T 13, <b>infants</b> with T 21 and <b>infants</b> without BD and increased risk of BPD compared to <b>infants</b> with T 21 and <b>infants</b> without BD.

Aim To describe the defecation pattern of healthy <b>infants</b> in The Netherlands. Methods From a research population of 1175 healthy Dutch <b>infants,</b> 600 <b>infants</b> without any complaints were selected. The parents recorded details of feeding and defecation at the age of 1, 2 and 3 months using a standardised questionnaire and bowel diary. Results In breastfed <b>infants,</b> average daily defecation frequency decreased significantly during the first 3 months (from 3. 65 to 1. 88 times per day), whereas no significant changes were observed in <b>infants</b> fed standard formula or mixed feeding. At every age both the average and the range of defecation frequency of breastfed <b>infants</b> were higher than those of <b>infants</b> receiving formula feeding.
