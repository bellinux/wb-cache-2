50|$|Care must {{be taken}} not to inhibit {{preemption}} during this search. Longer critical sections should be divided into small pieces. If an interrupt occurs that makes a <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> <b>task</b> ready during the insertion of a low priority task, that <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> <b>task</b> can be inserted and run immediately before the low priority task is inserted.|$|E
50|$|Under {{the policy}} of {{priority}} inheritance, whenever a <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> <b>task</b> has to wait for some resource shared with an executing low priority task, the low priority task is temporarily assigned the priority of the highest waiting priority task {{for the duration of}} its own use of the shared resource, thus keeping medium priority tasks from pre-empting the (originally) low priority task, and thereby affecting the waiting <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> <b>task</b> as well. Once the resource is released, the low priority task continues at its original priority level.|$|E
5000|$|In some cases, {{priority}} inversion {{can occur}} without causing immediate harm—the delayed {{execution of the}} <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> <b>task</b> goes unnoticed, and eventually the low priority task releases the shared resource. However, there are also many situations in which priority inversion can cause serious problems. If the <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> <b>task</b> is left starved of the resources, it {{might lead to a}} system malfunction or the triggering of pre-defined corrective measures, such as a watchdog timer resetting the entire system.

5000|$|In {{computer}} science, priority inversion is {{a problematic}} scenario in scheduling {{in which a}} <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> <b>task</b> is indirectly preempted by a lower priority task effectively [...] "inverting" [...] the relative priorities of the two tasks.|$|E
50|$|Priority {{inversion}} {{can also}} reduce the perceived performance of the system. Low priority tasks usually have a low priority {{because it is not}} important for them to finish promptly (for example, they might be a batch job or another non-interactive activity). Similarly, a <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> <b>task</b> has a high priority because it {{is more likely to be}} subject to strict time constraints—it may be providing data to an interactive user, or acting subject to realtime response guarantees. Because priority inversion results in the execution of a lower priority task blocking the <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> <b>task,</b> it can lead to reduced system responsiveness, or even the violation of response time guarantees.|$|E
5000|$|In {{preemptive}} multitasking, {{the operating}} system kernel can also initiate a context switch to satisfy the scheduling policy's priority constraint, thus preempting the active task.

50|$|Some {{preemptive}} multitasking scheduling systems behave as run-to-completion schedulers {{in regard to}} scheduling tasks at one particular process priority level, {{at the same time}} as those processes still preempt other lower <b>priority</b> <b>tasks</b> and are themselves preempted by <b>higher</b> <b>priority</b> <b>tasks.</b>|$|R
50|$|The basic {{priority}} inheritance protocol {{promotes the}} priority of the task that holds the resource to {{the priority of}} the task that requests that resource {{at the time the}} request is made. Upon release of the resource, the original priority level before the promotion is restored. This method does not prevent deadlocks and suffers from chained blocking. That is, if a <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> <b>task</b> accesses multiple shared resources in sequence, it may have to wait (block) on a lower priority task for each of the resources. The real-time patch to the Linux kernel includes an implementation of this protocol.|$|E
50|$|In {{priority}} inversion a <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> <b>task</b> waits {{because a}} {{low priority task}} has a semaphore, but the lower priority task is not given CPU time to finish its work. A typical solution {{is to have the}} task that owns a semaphore run at, or 'inherit,' the priority of the highest waiting task. But this simple approach fails when there are multiple levels of waiting: task A waits for a binary semaphore locked by task B, which waits for a binary semaphore locked by task C. Handling multiple levels of inheritance without introducing instability in cycles is complex and problematic.|$|E
50|$|The other {{approach}} to resource sharing is for tasks to send messages {{in an organized}} message passing scheme. In this paradigm, the resource is managed directly by only one task. When another task wants to interrogate or manipulate the resource, it {{sends a message to}} the managing task. Although their real-time behavior is less crisp than semaphore systems, simple message-based systems avoid most protocol deadlock hazards, and are generally better-behaved than semaphore systems. However, problems like those of semaphores are possible. Priority inversion can occur when a task is working on a low-priority message and ignores a higher-priority message (or a message originating indirectly from a <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> <b>task)</b> in its incoming message queue. Protocol deadlocks can occur when two or more tasks wait for each other to send response messages.|$|E

50|$|The {{scheduler}} is {{the part}} of the kernel responsible for determining which task runs next. Most real-time kernels are priority based. In a priority-based kernel, control of the CPU is always given to the <b>highest</b> <b>priority</b> <b>task</b> ready to run. Two types of priority-based kernels exist: non-preemptive and preemptive. Nonpreemptive kernels require that each task do something to explicitly give up control of the CPU. A preemptive kernel is used when system responsiveness is more important. Thus, µC/OS-II and most commercial real-time kernels are preemptive. The <b>highest</b> <b>priority</b> <b>task</b> ready to run is always given control of the CPU.|$|R

50|$|They {{are used}} to perform {{scheduling}} and offload the assignment of compute queues to the ACEs from the driver to hardware by buffering these queues until {{there is at least}} one empty queue in at least one ACE, causing the HWS to immediately assign buffered queues to the ACEs until all queues are full or there are no more queues to safely assign. Part of the scheduling work performed includes prioritized queues which allow critical tasks to run at a higher priority than other tasks without requiring the lower priority tasks to be preempted to run the <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> <b>task,</b> therefore allowing the tasks to run concurrently with the high priority tasks scheduled to hog the GPU as much as possible while letting other tasks use the resources that the high priority tasks are not using. These are essentially Asynchronous Compute Engines that lack dispatch controllers. They were first introduced in the fourth generation GCN microarchitecture, but were present in the third generation GCN microarchitecture for internal testing purposes. A driver update has enabled the hardware schedulers in third generation GCN parts for production use.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a new {{approach}} to synchronization in real-time systems. Existing methods for synchronization in real-time systems are pessimistic, and use blocking to enforce concurrency control. Protocols such as the priority ceiling protocol have been proposed to reduce the priority inversion that occurs when low priority tasks block high priority tasks. However, the priority ceiling protocol still allows a low priority task to block a <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> <b>task,</b> and requires the use of a static-priority scheduler. We propose optimistic synchronization methods as an alternative to pessimistic synchronization methods. Our synchronization algorithms never allow a low priority task to block a <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> <b>task,</b> and can be used with dynamic-priority schedulers.

50|$|Consider two tasks H and L, of <b>high</b> and low <b>priority</b> respectively, {{either of}} which can acquire {{exclusive}} use of a shared resource R. If H attempts to acquire R after L has acquired it, then H becomes blocked until L relinquishes the resource. Sharing an exclusive-use resource (R in this case) in a well-designed system typically involves L relinquishing R promptly so that H (a <b>higher</b> <b>priority</b> <b>task)</b> does not stay blocked for excessive periods of time. Despite good design, however, {{it is possible that}} a third task M of medium priority (p(L) < p(M) < p(H), where p(x) represents the <b>priority</b> for <b>task</b> (x)) becomes runnable during Ls use of R. At this point, M being <b>higher</b> in <b>priority</b> than L, preempts L, causing L to not be able to relinquish R promptly, in turn causing H—the <b>highest</b> <b>priority</b> process—to be unable to run.

The occurrence of singularities, {{both of the}} kinematic and algorithmic type, may affect the correct hierarchy in task execution.
