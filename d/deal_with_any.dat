5|$|On convict ships, the convicts were {{guarded by}} {{pensioner}} guards, who were soldiers awarded pensions for their service {{in areas such}} as China, Crimea, and Afghanistan. Some remained in the military, but many opted to stay in the colony as settlers, having brought their wives and children with them.

5|$|Mathews and Cave {{also began}} to muster their forces, already {{commanding}} 900 Zanzibari askaris under Lieutenant Arthur Edward Harington Raikes of the Wiltshire Regiment who was seconded to the Zanzibar Army and held the rank of brigadier-general. 150 sailors and marines were landed from the Pearl-class protected cruiser Philomel and the gunboat Thrush, which were anchored in the harbour. The naval contingent, {{under the command of}} Captain O'Callaghan, came ashore within fifteen minutes of being requested to <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>any</b> rioting caused by the general population. A smaller contingent of sailors under Lieutenant Watson of Thrush were put ashore to guard the British consulate, where British citizens were requested to gather for protection. HMS Sparrow, another gunboat, entered the harbour and was anchored opposite the palace next to Thrush.|$|E

5|$|On the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in 1939, the animal keepers were issued with rifles to <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>any</b> dangerous animals who might escape if the gardens were bombed. A night shift was introduced to watch over the animals 24hours a day. A list of dangerous animals that was drawn up included 13lions, 6tigers, 2leopards, 1cheetah, 2tigons, 3other small cats and several bears. Although the zoo's administrators succeeded in convincing the local authorities that any danger from the animals was minimal, primarily because the perimeter walls were so high, the keepers were replaced in their sharp-shooting role by soldiers who patrolled the grounds armed with tommy guns.|$|E
5|$|Yamatos {{crew were}} at general {{quarters}} {{and ready for}} anti-aircraft action by dawn on 7 April. The first Allied aircraft made contact with the Surface Special Attack Force at 08:23; two flying boats arrived soon thereafter, {{and for the next}} five hours, Yamato fired Common Type 3 or Beehive (3 Shiki tsûjôdan) shells at the Allied seaplanes, but could not prevent them from shadowing the force. Yamato obtained her first radar contact with aircraft at 10:00; an hour later, American F6F Hellcat fighters appeared overhead to <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>any</b> Japanese aircraft that might appear. None did.|$|E
5|$|Currie {{regarded}} {{control of}} either Hill 70 or Sallaumines Hill as tactically {{more important than}} control {{of the city of}} Lens. Merely to occupy the city while the Germans held the high ground, would place the attackers in an unfavourably lower and more exposed position than the ones they occupied. At a conference of corps commanders, Currie persuaded the First Army commander General Henry Horne to make Hill 70, not Lens, the main objective of the limited offensive. Controlling Hill 70 would provide excellent observation over the German lines, in preparation for more offensives. Currie believed the Germans would attempt to counter-attack if Hill 70 were captured, largely because of its observational importance. Nevertheless, Currie believed that the advantageous observational position of Hill 70 would permit well directed artillery to effectively <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>any</b> counter-attacks. The plan was therefore to occupy the high ground quickly, establish defensive positions and utilize combined small arms and artillery fire to repel expected counter-attacks and inflict as many casualties as possible.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to prerogative orders, the equitable remedy of a declaration {{can be employed}} to control an excess of legal authority. A declaration is a pronouncement by a court stating the legal position between the parties to an action, based on the facts that have been presented to the court. In contrast to the prerogative orders which are termed public law remedies, the declaration is called a private law remedy as it was originally developed in court cases between private parties. Only the High Court may grant declarations in judicial review cases; although the Subordinate Courts are generally empowered by the Subordinate Courts Act to grant declarations, a District Court exercises no judicial review jurisdiction over acts or decisions of persons or authorities, and a Magistrate's Court cannot <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>any</b> action {{in which there is}} no claim for any sum of money.|$|E
5|$|In flashbacks, Ann is {{hired by}} a wealthy and {{sophisticated}} aristocrat (Umbers) {{to act as}} a governess for his orphaned nephew and niece who live at Bly. He tells her that he is not to be bothered in London, and that Ann is to <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>any</b> problems that may arise. Ann travels to Bly, where she meets the all-female household staff—led by Mrs Sarah Grose (Johnston), the housekeeper—and then the young Flora (Sayer), one of Ann's new pupils. Ann finds the house somewhat unnerving, and the staff standoffish and unwilling to talk. Ann subsequently receives a letter informing her that Miles (Lindsay), her other pupil, has been expelled from his boarding school, but is assured by Mrs Grose that Miles is well behaved. When he arrives at Bly, Ann finds Miles to be charming, and although he does not explain what happened at school, she does not push him. Her interactions with the children are idyllic, and they sail on Bly's lake and enjoy picnics together. Meanwhile, Ann fantasises about the Master, futilely hoping that he will visit.|$|E
5|$|Over the {{following}} weekend, some 1,000 volunteers were sworn-in {{as part of}} the Citizens' Defence Brigade, a force of special constables raised at Leane's request to augment the police in dealing with the waterfront dispute. The brigade was based at Fort Largs and was equipped with service rifles and bayonets. The men were quickly posted at the wharves to maintain law and order. During the dispute, Leane slept in an office at the port so that he was on hand to <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>any</b> emergencies. Leane's decision to arm the mostly inexperienced volunteers with bayonets was later criticised in Parliament. The dispute continued on, with major disturbances at Port Adelaide on 14 January 1929 which resulted in many injuries, and another on 17 January. A significant police presence was required at the wharves into 1930 to deal with disturbances and assaults on non-union workers, and Leane personally supervised police operations there on several occasions.|$|E
