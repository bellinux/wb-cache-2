5|$|At its founding, music {{submissions}} to {{the site}} were evaluated for inclusion solely by Lloyd, who required that all arrangements both meet his quality bar and also feature an original interpretation of the music, rather than minimally changing the original track. In early 2002, however, to better accommodate the volume of music submissions and improve selection consistency, Lloyd instituted a panel of judges, composed of accomplished artists and contributors to the community, to assist him in music selection, though he still provided an <b>initial</b> <b>evaluation</b> of all submissions for meeting a minimum quality bar. Judge Larry Oji (a.k.a.

A foundational component of these standards is the Metadata Description Language (MDL). MDL is an eXtensible Markup Language (XML) -based language for describing requirements, design choices, and configuration parameters of a Telemetry Network System (TmNS).

25|$|The {{concept of}} this method is based on Sitaras' initial {{experience}} as a fitness trainer, especially concerning {{the lack of a}} scientific approach in this field, the usual trainer has available only an empirical knowledge of a client's body status.

He further envisaged an evaluation tailored on fitness goals that could give detailed insights and help the trainer analyze the physical status of their clients for a sufficient time. This would permit to investigate what is needed by understanding better the particular case of each individual. The location and the severity of the damages or inflammations on muscles and tendons also differ between people, meaning that the required exercises should be differed.|$|E
25|$|Following this <b>initial</b> <b>evaluation,</b> {{a number}} of {{modifications}} were incorporated into the design. These included increasing engine power by use of an Astazou XVIIIA of 780kW (1,050hp), and replacement of the original rotor blades with plastic blades. Aérospatiale engineers hoped to reduce vibration and ground resonance. Thus modified, test flights resumed in May 1973, in time to present the new aircraft at that year's Paris Air Show. In the meantime, a second prototype (registration F-WSQX) joined the test programme, flying first on 29 January. At the show, the first prototype broke three world airspeed records for helicopters in the 1,750kg – 3,000kg class (FAI class E-1d). Piloted by Roland Coffignot and carrying a dummy payload to represent eight passengers, it broke the 100km closed-circuit (299km/h, 186mph), 3km straight-course (312km/h, 195mph), and 15km straight-course (303km/h, 189mph) records.|$|E
25|$|If an MI is {{presented}} with ECG {{evidence of an}} ST elevation known as STEMI, or if a bundle branch block is similarly presented, then reperfusion therapy is necessary. In {{the absence of an}} ST elevation, a non-ST elevation MI, known as an NSTEMI, or an unstable angina may be presumed (both of these are indistinguishable on <b>initial</b> <b>evaluation</b> of symptoms). ST elevations indicate a completely blocked artery needing immediate reperfusion. In NSTEMI the blood flow is present but limited by stenosis. In NSTEMI the same thrombolytics are used as for STEMI, but they are also often stabilised with antiplatelets and anticoagulants. If the condition stays stable a cardiac stress test may be offered, and if needed subsequent revascularization will be carried out to restore a normal blood flow. If the blood flow becomes unstable an urgent angioplasty may be required. In these unstable cases the use of thrombolytics is contraindicated.|$|E

500|$|Spinal cord {{injuries}} generally {{result in}} at least some incurable impairment even with the best possible treatment. The best predictor of prognosis is the level and completeness of injury, as measured by the ASIA impairment scale. The neurological score at the <b>initial</b> <b>evaluation</b> done 72 hours after injury is the best predictor of how much function will return. Most people with ASIA scores of A (complete injuries) do not have functional motor recovery, but improvement can occur. Most patients with incomplete injuries recover at least some function. Chances of recovering the ability to walk improve with each AIS grade found at the initial examination; e.g. an ASIA D score confers a better chance of walking than a score of C. The symptoms of incomplete injuries can vary {{and it is difficult to}} make an accurate prediction of the outcome. [...] A person with a mild, incomplete injury at the T5 vertebra will have a much better chance of using his or her legs than a person with a severe, complete injury at exactly the same place. Of the incomplete SCI syndromes, Brown-Séquard and central cord syndromes have the best prognosis for recovery and anterior cord syndrome has the worst.|$|E
