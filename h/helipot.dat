50|$|The {{original}} Evans balance {{was described}} by Dennis F. Evans in 1973 based on a torsional balance developed in 1937 by Alexander Rankine. Evans used Ticonal bars with cadmium plated mild steel yokes as the magnets, a Johnson-Matthey gold alloy (hence the other name of the balance)for the suspension strip, all glued together with epoxy resin onto a phosphor brown spacer. The tubes were made from NMR tubes and the current came from CdS photocells. This original was modified {{with help from the}} Johnson-Matthey company Two pairs of magnets were glued between the arms of an H-frame. The sample was placed into the gap between one pair of magnets and a small coil in the gap between the second pair of magnets. This entire construction pivoted horizontally around a torsion strip. When a sample tube was placed between the first pair of magnets, the torsional force was restored by the current passed through the coil between the second pair of magnets, giving a reading on a display instead of a <b>Helipot</b> (as was used in the original).|$|E

40|$|This {{apparatus}} {{extends the}} sensitivity of an ordinary potentiometer and galvanometer so that accurate measurements can {{be made of the}} electromotive force of a cell containing a glass electrode having a resistance of about 100 megohms. The electronic bridge serves the same purpose as other circuits which have been described; 2 its advantages are good stability, high sensitivity, and moderate cost. The bridge circuit, shown in Figure 1, is based on the use of two 959 "acorn " pentodes, as in a circuit described by Burr and Mauro. ' These tubes are employed as "space charge grid " pentodes to reduce the grid current to less than 1013 amperes; ' one tube is used actively, the other passively. The resistance arms of the bridge consist of two fixed resistors of precision type, 2, 500 ohms each, supplemented by a variable component consisting of a 20, 000 ohm <b>Helipot</b> unit shunted by a 5, 000 ohm resistor. In order to ensure maximum stability, only wire-wound resistors are used. The zero setting of the galvanometer is adjusted by the <b>Helipot...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{generator}} {{for providing}} pulses or accurately predetermined characteristics for calibration purposes is described. Possible applications {{for such a}} pulse generator include calibrating pulse analyzers, oscilloscopes, amplifiers and attenuators. Designs are possible for duplicating photomultiplier Geiger and similar pulse-forms with exponential characteristics and for use in testing and adjusting equipment used in nuclear research. This generator is similar in principle to one described by Stone, but additional construction and design details for purposes of assuring predicted accuracy are described in this report. This generator is designed to work into an impedance of 52 ohms, and to deliver a pulse which is the algebraic sum of two exponential voltage functions, one rising and the other decaying. The time constant of the rising exponential can be selected in steps of 0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 5 and 1. 0 microseconds by a switch on the front panel. The time constant of the decaying exponential is fixed at approximately 100 microseconds. A carefully measured and monitored supply voltage is compensated on each position of the rise time constant switch so that the pulse amplitude will be varied {{by means of a}} <b>Helipot</b> on the panel from zero to 50 volts. A choice of either polarity is available. Accuracy of a selected 1 % pulse amplitude and rise time constant is believed to be better than 1 %, although calculations and measurements of components were made to 0. 1 % tolerances...|$|E
