50|$|Large by the {{standards}} of UAVs, the Soar Dragon's joined wing allows for a more rigid, less flexible wing than other configurations, with benefits said to include an increased lift-to-drag ratio and less complex flight controls than a HALE UAV with a conventional wing would require. The aircraft is powered by a Guizhou WP-13 turbojet engine, a developed copy of the Soviet Tumansky R-13; it is anticipated that a newer, improved engine, will be <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> <b>production</b> aircraft.

In 1987, the Porsche 944 Turbo became the first car to have driver and passenger airbags as standard equipment, and airbags were offered as an available option on the 944 and 944S. The first airbag was also installed in a Japanese car, the Honda Legend, in 1987. In 1988, Chrysler was the first United States company to install standard driver's side air bags, in six of its passenger models. In 1989, Chrysler became the first U.S. auto manufacturer to install driver-side air bags in all its domestic-built automobiles.|$|E
50|$|Related to the 117S is the izdeliye 117 (AL-41F1), {{a highly}} {{improved}} AL-31F derivative {{designed for the}} Sukhoi Su-57 fighter. The engine features an increased diameter fan, new high and low pressure turbines, and a digital control system (FADEC). According to Sukhoi director Mikhail Pogosyan, the 117 is a new fifth generation engine built specifically for the Su-57. Though {{the specifics of the}} 117 engine remain classified, the engine's thrust was increased by 24.5 kN (5,500 lbs) over the AL-31 while the engine weight was reduced by 150 kg. The new engine produces 147 kN (33,067 lbf) of thrust in afterburner and has a dry weight of 1420 kg and thrust-to-weight ratio of 10.5:1. Like the AL-31F, the 117 has 4 low-pressure compressor (fan) and 9 high-pressure compressor stages. Mikhail Pogosyan further mentioned that the 117 engine meets the Russian Air Force requirements and will be <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> <b>production</b> Su-57 fighter which will be supplied to the Russian Air Force and prospective foreign clients.|$|E

40|$|A {{distributed}} {{temperature sensor}} (DTS) system, utilizing Raman backscattering to measure temperatures of optical fiber, {{has recently been}} <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> <b>production</b> wells at the Beowawe and Dixie Valley, NV, geothermal fields. The system {{has the potential to}} reduce the cost and complexity of acquiring temperature logs. However, the optical transmission of the initial fibers installed at Beawawe degraded over several months, resulting in temperature errors. Optical transmission spectra of the failed fibers indicate hydroxide contamination via hydrogen diffusion as a possible failure mechanism. Additional fibers with coatings designed to resist hydrogen diffusion were installed and have maintained their optical transmission over several months in the 340 - 360 F Beowawe wells. The same fibers installed in a 470 F Dixie Valley well rapidly failed. Possible methods to prevent fiber degradation include encasing the fiber in metallic buffer layer that resists hydrogen diffusion. Additional methods to correct temperature errors include using additional optical sources to measure fiber losses at the operating wavelengths. Although the DTS system is expected to have one degree F accuracy, we have observed an average accuracy of five degrees. The fiber connections appear to be the uncertainty source. Using connectors with greater stability should restore accuracy...|$|E
40|$|Objective: {{the aim of}} {{this project}} was to reduce {{environmental}} load caused by halogenated hydrocarbons by developing and researching alternative processes using aqueous solutions, and implementing these in technical systems. Results: process and system techniques for cleaning with aqueous solutions were developed for various applications, and replace previous cleaning processes using halogenated hydrocarbons without loss of quality. The emphasis of this process development laid on elaboration of methods for selecting cleaners, the examination of different rinsing and drying techniques and the influence of ultrasonics on immersion cleaning. For the purpose of quality assurance, methods were developed to determine residual dirt and to analyze cleaning solutions. Regeneration processes were tested and applied to extend the standing time of bathes. For the implementation of these cleaning processes, a cost effective concept for converting existing systems with clorinated hydrocarbons was developed and employed. Furthermore, different types of aqueous cleaning systems were conceived and <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> <b>production</b> plants. These comprise both flexible central systems for the cleaning of parts from various areas of production and cleaning systems which form part of the production flow. (orig.)

40|$|Intelligent well {{systems are}} <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> <b>production</b> or {{injection}} wells, {{to increase the}} total amount of produced hydrocarbons. An intelligent well system has the advantages of being able to set different choke openings, using hydraulic operated sleeves to regulate the flow of produced or injected fluids. The procedure of operating the choke from surface without the use of any intervention work, is both economical and less time consuming. Combining the efficiency of intelligent well systems and down hole monitoring systems, such as pressure and temperature gauges, allows for production optimisation. If the down hole monitoring system also is fitted with a multiphase flow meter, surface test separators could be unnecessary. Multilateral wells are used to reach several pay zones, either within the same reservoir or in different smaller reservoirs. A multilateral well is a single bore well, at the surface, with one or several branches going out from the main bore. This method of drilling is economical and less time consuming. The equipment costs are lower, due to the need for only one wellhead, less casing costs, lower rig charge etc. Seeing as one only have to drill one main bore, as opposed to drilling separate wells where all wells must be drilled from the seabed, the method is also time saving. Combining these two solutions, the well will produce from several zones in different reservoirs into one main bore. The production can be controlled and regulated for each zone continuously. This thesis will describe the equipment used in a combined intelligent well and multilateral solution...|$|E

In the last decade, web-based laboratories in real time {{play an important role}} in technical education. Pilot research paper represents a practical solution that allows through equipment that is relatively low cost to get quality monitoring and management systems at a distance. The basic idea is to use existing technologies available that are free to use and combined them with new solutions in this paper to make a managed system that works flawlessly. The solutions described are characterized by short response time at any moment and under any conditions. For example is taken realizing the monitoring and control of the fermentation process in existing winery. This pilot winery is operated remotely via the Internet; it is not used for special purpose equipment.
