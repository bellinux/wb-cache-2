5000|$|Five new {{buildings}} were constructed on the complex by 1907. The following year, Barber-Colman diversified to produce Milling Cutters. These {{were used by}} large mills for cutting metal. Their <b>Gear</b> <b>Hobbing</b> <b>Machine</b> came out in two sizes in 1910 and could precisely cut teeth in gears. In 1919, the company purchased {{the rights to the}} Warp Drawing Machine from the American Warp Drawing Machine Company. This machine eased the transition of switching warping patterns. In 1921, Barber-Colman introduced a High Speed Warper & Creel and Automatic Spoolers. By 1931, the company also had production facilities in Framingham, Massachusetts; Greenville, South Carolina; Munich, Germany; Chicago; Cincinnati, Ohio; Rochester, New York; and Manchester, England.Howard Colman died in a car accident in 1942. Harry Severson, one of the three original directors, took over leadership of the company. In 1953, the [...] "Park Plant" [...] was built, a one-story, 125000 sq ft building in nearby Loves Park. In 1954, the company purchased the Hendey Machine Company. By 1965, three other additions were complete on the Loves Park facility. In 1968, a 200000 sq ft facility was built just north of the original plant. By 1975, Barber-Colman employed 4000 workers among its 150 locations. The company was family-owned until the death of Walter Colman (Howard's son) in 1983. Following Colman's death, the company was sold off to various companies. Reed-Chatwood purchased the textile operations and continued to manufacture from the original factory until 2001. The machine tool division was sold to fellow Rockford company Bourn & Koch, Inc. Bourn & Koch provides parts, service and support for their machines to this day. Barber-Colman henceforth focused on cutting tools and process controls. The remaining divisions were eventually sold off. The Barber-Colman trademark is held by Eurotherm Controls, Inc. The historic complex has been vacated since Reed-Chatwood relocated in 2001. The City of Rockford currently owns the property, purchasing it for $750,000 in 2002. On August 8, 2006, it was recognized by the National Park Service with a listing on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E

50|$|A {{disadvantage}} of the herringbone gear {{is that it}} cannot be cut by simple <b>gear</b> <b>hobbing</b> <b>machines,</b> as the cutter would run into {{the other half of}} the gear. Solutions to this have included assembling small gears by stacking two helical gears together, cutting the gears with a central groove to provide clearance, and (particularly in the early days) by casting the gears to an accurate pattern and without further machining. With the older method of fabrication, herringbone gears had a central channel separating the two oppositely-angled courses of teeth. This was necessary to permit the shaving tool to run out of the groove. The development of the Sykes gear shaper made it possible to have continuous teeth with no central gap. Sunderland, also in England, also produced a herringbone cutting machine. The Sykes uses cylindrical guides and round cutters; the Sunderland uses straight guides and rack-type cutters. The W. E. Sykes Co. dissolved in 1983-84. Since then it has been common practice to obtain an older machine and rebuild it if necessary to create this unique type of gear. Recently, the Bourn and Koch company has developed a CNC-controlled derivation of the W. E. Sykes design called the HDS1600-300. This machine, like the Sykes gear shaper, has the ability to generate a true apex without the need for a clearance groove cut around the gear. This allows the gears to be used in positive displacement pumping applications, as well as power transmission. Helical gears with low weight, accuracy and strength may be 3D printed.|$|R

30|$|Further, the {{experiments}} in the hobbing process are too expensive {{as the cost of}} the hob tools or a <b>gear</b> <b>hobbing</b> <b>machine</b> is very high, and {{it is very difficult to}} measure the cutting force and temperature during the machining process. A fly hobbing experiment was designed to simulate the actual hobbing process by many authors as Rech (2006), Umezaki et al. (2012), and Stein et al. (2012). The present paper experimentally investigates applying new nanofluids to reduce the hob wear by reducing the cutting force, friction, and cutting temperature in the fly hobbing process. A fuzzy model based on the Taguchi experiment design has been used to optimize the multi-responses of the fly hobbing process. Using Minitab 16, the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios for different outputs of the fuzzy model (the total cutting force, the force ratio Fz/Fy, the cutting temperature, and the surface roughness) were calculated by the Taguchi method. Then, the S/N ratios are used to determine a resultant index (the FRTS index) for estimating the fly hobbing process by using fuzzy logic theory. These FRTS values were used for multi-response optimization and gave the optimum parameter level for the fly hobbing process. Furthermore, the optimum parameters were applied for the actual hobbing process and compared with the initial parameters.|$|E

40|$|AbstractGear hobbing {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{productive}} manufacturing processes for cylindrical gears. The quality of the gears is a result of the tool quality, the precision of the workpiece, tool clamping and kinematics of the <b>machine.</b> The dry <b>gear</b> <b>hobbing</b> process allows <b>machining</b> of gears with a quality according to the DIN standard of up to IT 5. To evaluate which gear quality is possible to machine with a given clamping and hob it is useful to simulate the process in advance. This is also an opportunity to order the required quality of the hob according to its application. The objective presented in this paper is to simulate non-ideal <b>gear</b> <b>hobbing</b> processes and to calculate the geometry and topography of the workpiece. To achieve this goal, a simulation for continuous <b>gear</b> <b>hobbing</b> was developed. By calculating planar intersections of transverse sections of both gear and tool, the resulting gear geometry is determined. Beside it is possible to calculate different characteristic values for the hobbing process such as chip thickness and cutting volume. By an evaluation of tool and clamping tolerances these deviations can be used to modify the simulation model. Afterwards a non-ideal hobbing simulation can be performed and the resulting gear geometry can be analyzed using a virtual measurement machine. An advantage of this non-ideal simulation is also the possibility of calculating the tool load taking these deviations into account and to use the results for further process designs to reduce the risk of tool failure. The virtual measurement machine analyses the geometry according to VDI/VDE  2612 / 2607 and DIN  3961. The resulting measurements of the flank and lead lines can be used for a classification of the gear quality. By using this simulation program it is possible to reduce the costs and time effort of setting up a new hobbing process...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{the process}} chain for <b>gear</b> manufacturing, <b>gear</b> <b>hobbing</b> {{is one of}} the most {{productive}} processes for soft machining of gears. To reach a high quality after the soft machining, for example in <b>gear</b> finish <b>hobbing,</b> the requirements on the hobbing process increases significantly. To get a high quality part after soft machining, the process of <b>gear</b> <b>hobbing</b> is mostly divided in a roughing and a finishing cut. In the roughing process, the most amount of the material needs to get machined. The finishing process is used to get a high quality shape of the gear and to get low surface roughness. To get low cutting forces in the finishing step, the material stock after the roughing process has to be minimized. A low amount of stock on the flank offers the possibility to use high cutting speeds. This paper deals with the investigation of the two cut processes in the <b>gear</b> <b>hobbing.</b> Especially, the tool life of different tool concepts are taken into account. The process design offers the opportunity to use the same tool for the roughing and the finishing cut or the choice of different tools.

40|$|AbstractCurrent {{processes}} for producing transmission <b>gears</b> involve <b>hobbing,</b> milling or shaping of a forged stock {{to obtain the}} gear shape. Gears are typically formed by hobbing tools made from solid tooling material, such as tungsten carbide, and have dozens of teeth. The <b>gear</b> <b>hobbing</b> process entails several teeth in cut simultaneously. Generation of in-volute tooth profiles results in varying chip loads from pass to pass. In this paper, details are provided for a finite element-based model of <b>gear</b> <b>hobbing</b> and milling processes. The model explicitly meshes gear cutter geometries with dozens of teeth. These cutters are used to simulate the complicated kinematic motion between tool and workpiece. Thermo-mechanical coupled calculations within an explicit dynamic formulation are per-formed on the tool and workpiece during chip removal. The complex geometry of involute tooth profiles results in complicated contact scenarios on the evolving workpiece geometry during tooth profile generation. Tooth-workpiece-chip contact is enforced rigorously and is particularly complicated with the confined space of <b>gear</b> <b>hobbing.</b> Advanced adaptive meshing strategies are developed and employed to maintain {{the resolution of the}} tool-workpiece interaction while multiple teeth are in contact. Cutting forces, temperatures and stresses in the tool and workpiece are predicted for steel workpiece materials. Models are validated through a set of initially simplified experiments where incremental complexity is added, allowing for direct comparison between predicted and measured forces and chip shapes...|$|R

The advantage of this machining method lies in that when the hob cuts deeper, as the both side-blades are cutting the work-piece at the same time, the thinning on both sides are quite symmetrical, and the fine symmetry remains during the uniform change of the teeth thickness.

Compared to other gear forming processes it is relatively inexpensive but still quite accurate, thus it is used for a broad range of parts and quantities.|$|R
