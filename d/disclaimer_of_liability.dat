40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to determine the design of an autonomous ferry to transport people between Ravnkloa and Fosenkaia in Trondheim. It will also be considered whether or not it will be a better solution than a bridge. The operational area of the ferry is limited to the 100 metres stretch between the two docks. The ferry should not require any personnel on board to operate, but it is assumed that a supervisor can oversee the operations from a land base. The surrounding elements of the system was outlined for easy adaptation, but not designed to full detail due to time limitations. The autonomous system itself was not considered directly as it is outside the team members area of expertise. The work in this thesis follows the System Based Ship Design (SBSD) methodology, combined with the Risk Based Ship Design (RBSD) method. In order to apply both methods simultaneously, they were slightly adapted to fit the design study. A bigger emphasis has been put on the functional analysis in the SBSD approach. This makes it easier to determine a good solution for the design. The design study initiates with the mission statement, and sets the main functional requirements for the design based on this. Both relevant generic- and safety related functional requirements were set according to the main functions. The safety related functions were determined by performing a formal safety assessment. To reveal all possible solutions to the functional requirements, a brainstorming session was performed. The alternatives were continuously evaluated against relevant framework conditions and the least relevant ones excluded, thus limiting the final solution throughout the design process. The required area and volume on board, determined using model- and life size test, determined the initial main dimensions. The final design was evaluated on technical performance, economy and safety performance. Stability- strength- and resistance calculations were used to verify the design, in addition to determining the life cycle costs (LCC). The result of this study is the design of an autonomous ferry with electrical power supply and a ramp used for mooring and entrance. The ferry is 9 m long with a beam of 4 m. The design draught of the vessel is 0. 515 m. The ferry can transport up to 12 passengers, including three wheelchairs, and 30 kg luggage per person. There is also room for twelve bicycles on board. The building material is aluminium. The ferry superstructure is semi - open with two broad pillars supporting the roof. The ferry will dock at piers separated from other docks in the area. An information poster is located at the dock to inform passengers on relevant safety issues. The registration gates lock of the docking area to the people on the dock. Entry to the dock is done using a gangway. The design ensures that the passenger comfort is sufficiently good. The ferry is able to transport all types of pedestrians, and is thus able to substitute a bridge. The weakness of the ferry option is that passengers may need to wait a few minutes to use the ferry. The ferry's life cycle costs were estimated at approximately NOK 2. 4 million over 15 years. This is significantly lower than the price tag for the bridge, estimated at NOK 42 million. Thus, the the ferry is considered a good alternative. All functional requirements set to the design are considered fulfilled to a reasonable degree. The methods applied for the design have weaknesses. Flaws in the RBSD methodology include a lack of accurate statistical information, the fact that the method is based on analysis of existing vessels, and that it is dependent on predetermined risk acceptance criteria. Flaws in the SBSD methodology include non existing statistical information on small and/or autonomous vessels. Required space for all systems was therefore set using existing equipment. Another flaw is that functional requirements may not cover all actual requirements for the vessel. For instance, bollards and ropes are required on board in case towing is necessary, but is not covered by any functional requirements. The iterative nature of the design process indicate several relevant tasks for the further project work. It will be relevant to consider all aspects set by regulations. New aspects for consideration include design of land based dock systems and determination of access restrictions, required safety level, <b>disclaimer</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> and technical requirements for autonomous vessels. Several aspects on board the vessel are also relevant. This includes heating cables in the ferry roof and main deck, verification of plate thickness, hull adaptation for welding and design of bicycle racks. The operational plan for the battery systems should be determined for the ferry operation to run as smoothly as possible. Finally, the damage stability for the vessel should be verified...|$|E
40|$|This Essay {{addresses}} {{the transformation of}} civil law that began in this country, roughly around the mid- 1960 s, from a legal system that intervened {{in the lives of}} citizens only on occasions of serious moral dereliction, to the most extensive and powerful regulatory mechanism of modern society. Prior to the 1960 s, civil law served a modest role in U. S. affairs. It enforced property rights and policed boundary disputes through property law, enforced promises as well as <b>disclaimers</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> through contract law, and provided damages for personal injury through negligence law (tort law) when an individual was injured by an egregious breach of standards of normal behavior. Though the negligence standard proved loose enough to allow substantial subsequent expansion, courts prior to the 1960 s employed this standard only where a party showed clear moral culpability that was substantially antagonistic to social norms. Standards determined by private contract were far more significant to the determination of the obligations of citizens. Since the 1960 s, however, our civil law has changed dramatically. Contract law, property law, and especially personal injury law have transformed both in function and effect. The transformation occurred through neither a sudden change in legal doctrine, nor legislative statute or popular referendum. Instead, the transformation occurred through the triumph of a set of ideas: the acceptance by the judiciary of the proposition that civil damages judgments can serve as the most effective public policy instrument for regulating the level of harm suffered by citizens in the society...|$|R

40|$|Beneficence as a {{principle}} {{is one of}} the definite jurisprudential rules and a <b>disclaimer</b> <b>of</b> civil <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> the individual in terms of the loss enforced upon others during acts of collective good. This shall necessitate that beneficence include both subjective and practical good simultaneously. As regards beneficence to an individual other, it is necessary that the act itself be wasteful or the cause be destructive; but, when the addressee is collective, neither that beneficence is by essence wasteful, nor the cause destructive. Therefore, the question is if a group of individuals suffer from a loss during the act of good, is the agent allocated a liability or not? This paper distinguishes between cases where the group is subject to beneficence as a collective whole, and those which entail submerged or alternative whole (totality). Consequently, it has been proven that {{it should be possible to}} apply the rule and disclaim the liability when the good is done to a collective mass of individuals and common good is taken into consideration. Even in that case, Kaldor-Hicks’ secular criterion was adopted in an attempt to provide a framework rule for the evaluation of common good. قاعده احسان یکی از قواعد مسلم فقهی است که رافع مسئولیت مدنی فرد در اتلافی است که در فرایند احسان به دیگران وارد می‌کند. قدر متیقن از این قاعده در جایی است که در احسان صورت گرفته حسن فاعلی و حسن فعلی توامان وجود داشته باشد. در احسان به فرد شرط است که خود احسان باید اتلاف گونه یا سبب زیان‌بار باشد؛ اما وقتی طرف احسان یک جمع است و آن احسان نیز فی‌نفسه نه اتلاف است و نه سبب زیان‌بار، این سوال مطرح است که اگر در ضمن آن برخی از افراد جمع متضرر شدند آیا به فاعل آن ضمانی تعلق می‌گیرد یا خیر؟ در این مقاله با تفکیک مواردی که جمع به صورت عام مجموعی مورد احسان قرار می‌گیرند یا عام استغراقی یا عام علی البدل، ثابت شده که در جایی که احسان به نحو عام مجموعی و با لحاظ مصلحت عمومی صورت می‌گیرد، جریان قاعده و رفع ضمان بدون اشکال است. در همین صورت نیز تلاش شده با معیار عرفی کالدور- هیکس ضابطه‌ای برای درستی مصلحت در نظر گرفته شده ارائه شود...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the problem of the {{consumer}} protection under the law of contract and the law of torts. The first part of the article contains basic informations on the consumer movement in the United Kingdom (consumer organizations, the government and the consumer, protective legislation outside the private law). The changes in the attitude towards the consumer are reflected both in legislation and case law. So far as the law of sale is concerned, the traditional common law rule was that there was no legal obligation on the vendor to inform the buyer that he was under a mistake not induced by the act of the seller. The first statutory act that limited the ill consequences of this harsh rule was introduced in 1893. By the Sale of Goods Act a condition is implied that the goods will be reasonably fit for the customers purpose, if the buyer makes known to the seller the purpose for which he requires the goods, so as to show that he relies on the seller's choice, and the goods are of a description which the seller ordinarily supplies. As a rule the consumer's rights against the seller do not extend beyond a cash compensation. There {{is no doubt that the}} right for rescission is primarily a consumer's remedy and its limitation by the Sale of Goods Act has evoked sharp criticism among legal writers. Another important statute, the acts governing hire purchase agreements lay down conditions limiting some of ill efects of modern marketing and advertising on the consumer's choice. The most important of these provisions are: the agreement must be in writing; if the contract is made at buyers home he has three days within which he can withdraw; advertisements relating to goods on hire purchase must show full details of the terms, if one or more important figure is shown (such as deposit). One of the latest examples of the evolution on the field of the law of contract is the Misrepresentation Act of 1967. Its main purpose is to give an effective remedy to the person who was induced to contract by some misleading statement. It must be emphasized that the Act has introduced several proposals made by the Commitee on Consumer Protection. The protective legislation has resulted in a widespread use of various forms of exemption clauses by mass producing and marketing enterprisers. These <b>disclaimers</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> usually appear in the printed clauses of standard forms, so called guarantees, on labels attached to goods, etc. In order to protect the consumer the case law seem to recognize the need for developing a number of restrictive rules of construction peculiar to exemption clauses. In earlier times the producer of the manufacture usually sold it to the consumer. Thus the latter, being in privity of contract with the maker, was entitled to sue the producer for losses caused by the defects of the product. The new forms of distribution of goods has changed the legal position of the buyer who is no longer in privity with the producer. Hence courts and legislators are confronted {{with the problem of}} finding a satisfactory solution of protecting the legitimate interests of the injured ultimate consumer in cases where he is unable to get recovery from the retailer. Before 1932 it was rather doubtful whether there was any liability on the part of the producer to the ultimate consumer of his product with whom there was no contractual link. But in that year the decision of the House of Lords in the most celebrated case Donoghue v. Stevenson established that the manufacturer of products owes a duty of care to the ultimate consumer or user. The principle has been gradually extended to include repairers, assemblers and builders.
