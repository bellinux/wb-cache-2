25|$|The {{piezoelectric}} effect is generally thought {{to act as}} a biological <b>force</b> <b>sensor.</b> This effect was exploited by research conducted at the University of Pennsylvania in the late 1970s and early 1980s, which established that sustained application of electrical potential could stimulate both resorption and growth (depending on the polarity) of bone in-vivo. Further studies in the 1990s provided the mathematical equation to confirm long bone wave propagation as to that of hexagonal (Class 6) crystals.|$|E
50|$|A clamp <b>force</b> <b>sensor</b> is a {{relatively}} expensive component in an EMB caliper. The cost is derived from its high unit value from a supplier, as well as marked production expenses because of its inclusion. The later emanates from the complex assembly procedures dealing with small tolerances, as well as on-line calibration for performance variability from one clamp <b>force</b> <b>sensor</b> to another. The successful use of a clamp <b>force</b> <b>sensor</b> in an EMB system poses a challenging engineering task. If a clamp forcesensor is placed close to a brake pad, {{then it will be}} subjected to severe temperature conditions reaching up to 800 Celsius that will challenge its mechanical integrity. Also temperature drifts must be compensated for. This situation can be avoided by embedding a clamp <b>force</b> <b>sensor</b> deep within the caliper. However, embedding this sensor leads to hysteresis that is influenced by friction between the clamp <b>force</b> <b>sensor</b> and the point of contact of an inner pad with the rotor. This hysteresis prevents a true clamp force to be measured. Due to the cost issues and engineering challenges involved with including the clamp <b>force</b> <b>sensor,</b> it might be desirable to eliminate this component from the EMB system. A potential opportunity to achieve this presents itself in accurate estimation of the clamp force based on alternative EMB system sensory measurements leading to the omission of a clamp <b>force</b> <b>sensor.</b>|$|E

40|$|Background The {{success of}} a telerobotic surgery system with haptic {{feedback}} requires accurate force-tracking and position-tracking capacity of the slave robot. The two-channel force-position control architecture is widely used in teleoperation systems with haptic feedback for its better force-tracking characteristics and superior position-tracking capacity for the maximum stability margin. This control architecture, however, requires <b>force</b> <b>sensors</b> at the end-effector of the slave robot to measure the environment force. However, {{it is difficult to}} attach <b>force</b> <b>sensors</b> to slave robots, mainly due to their large size, insulation issues and also large currents often flowing through the end-effector for incision or cautery of tissues. Methods This paper provides a method to estimate the environment force, using a function parameter matrix and a recursive least-squares method. The estimated force is used to feed back the force information to the surgeon through the control architecture without involving the <b>force</b> <b>sensors.</b> Results The simulation and experimental results verify the efficacy of the proposed method. The force estimation error is negligible and the slave device successfully tracks the position of the master device while the stability of the teleoperation system is maintained. Conclusions The developed method allows practical haptic feedback for telerobotic surgery systems in the two-channel force-position control scheme without the direct employment of <b>force</b> <b>sensors</b> at the end-effector of the slave robot...|$|R
