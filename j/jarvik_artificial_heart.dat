Ever heard of Dr. Robert Jarvik, the inventor of the <b>Jarvik</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>heart</b> who advertises for Lipitor? Nexium, the healing purple pill. Do these advertisements sound familiar? Consumers are constantly being bombarded with health information through magazine advertisements, television commercials, and billboards. One can not watch a television show without seeing a commercial for a prescription medication. Direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising has become a major approach pharmaceutical companies use to promote their drugs to consumers. More recently, healthcare systems have begun using the media to attract patients to their hospitals. The consumer is left with a wealth of information from these advertisements to sort through. DTC advertising has a dramatic effect not only on patients but also on physicians and healthcare systems. Patients are going to their physician to request medications for which they have seen in advertisements. Similarly, healthcare systems are competing against one another in order to attract the most patients to their hospital. DTC advertising has many implications which need to be analyzed to determine the overall effect advertising has on healthcare...|$|E

Aside from heart transplants, which are limited due to the availability of human donor <b>hearts,</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>hearts</b> are the only therapy available for terminal heart diseases. For various reasons, a total implantable <b>artificial</b> <b>heart</b> is desirable. But the limited space in the human thorax sets rigorous restrictions on the weight and dimensions of the device. Nevertheless, the appropriate functionality of the <b>artificial</b> <b>heart</b> must be ensured and blood damage must be prevented.
