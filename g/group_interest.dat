50|$|Émile Durkheim (1858-1917) saw {{the concept}} of the sacred as the {{defining}} characteristic of religion, not faith in the supernatural. He saw religion as a reflection of the concern for society. He based his view on recent research regarding totemism among the Australian aboriginals. With totemism he meant that each of the many clans had a different object, plant, or animal that they held sacred and that symbolizes the clan. Durkheim saw totemism as the original and simplest form of religion. According to Durkheim, the analysis of this simple form of religion could provide the building blocks for more complex religions. He asserted that moralism cannot be separated from religion. The sacred i.e. religion reinforces <b>group</b> <b>interest</b> that clash very often with individual interests. Durkheim held the view that the function of religion is group cohesion often performed by collectively attended rituals. He asserted that these group meeting provided a special kind of energy, which he called effervescence, that made group members lose their individuality and to feel united with the gods and thus with the group. Differing from Tylor and Frazer, he saw magic not as religious, but as an individual instrument to achieve something.|$|E

[...] In 1993, philosopher Cornel West wrote: [...] "Jews will not comprehend what the symbolic predicament and literal plight of Palestinians in Israel means to blacks.... Blacks often perceive the Jewish defense of the state of Israel as a second instance of naked <b>group</b> <b>interest,</b> and, again, an abandonment of substantive moral deliberation." [...] African-American support of Palestinians is frequently due to the consideration of Palestinians as people of color - political scientist Andrew Hacker writes: [...] "The presence of Israel in the Middle East is perceived as thwarting the rightful status of people of color. Some blacks view Israel as essentially a white and European power, supported from the outside, and occupying space that rightfully belongs to the original inhabitants of Palestine." ...|$|E

40|$|Although {{the topics}} of voting {{behavior}} and campaign strategy have vast amounts of political science literature, {{there is not much}} evidence that campaigns embrace theories of why people vote and how to get them to vote - especially at the local government level. This paper analyzes the urban voting behavior theory Kaufmann develops in The Urban Voter, <b>Group</b> <b>Interest</b> Theory, and combines with generally accepted methods of campaign strategy that produce the best outcomes. Applying this synthesis to the 2013 Boston mayoral election, the <b>Group</b> <b>Interest</b> framework does not seem to fully explain an open seat election in a rapidly changing Boston population. However, this framework does prove successful for the campaign strategies utilized in the preliminary election. Using archival research, personal interviews, and polling results, there is limited support for using the <b>Group</b> <b>Interest</b> framework and best campaign practices in being successful in an urban election...|$|E

First, we define a formal language for multi-agent deontic action logic and a class of consequentialist models to interpret the formulas of the language. Second, we define a transformation that converts any strategic game into a consequentialist model. Third, we show that an outcome is a Nash equilibrium of a strategic game {{if and only if}} a conjunction of certain conditional permissions is true in the consequentialist model that results from the transformation of that strategic game. ...|$|E
40|$|For a risk neutral lender and a {{group of}} borrowers facing {{identical}} revenue risks we compare individual loans and group lending. We stress the importance of group liquidity in defining the necessary risk premium. There are no welfare differences between the loan forms. However, the default rates and risk premia vary ambiguously between the loan forms. Simulations replicating empirical interest rates and default rates show that the <b>group</b> <b>interest</b> rate is lower for a larger group while the effect of group size on default risk is ambiguous. We then consider the case of identical correlated risks between borrowers. Positive correlation of projects gives a higher downward risk, so a higher <b>group</b> <b>interest</b> rate and a higher fraction of successes are required. Unlike independent group lending, the interest rate and the default risk are not lower in the larger group loan with correlated returns.

40|$|System {{justification}} theory (SJT) {{proposes that}} support for social inequality should be stronger among members of devalued groups than among members of higher status groups; that embracing the system in this way soothes anger and leads to a withdrawal of support for social change; and that these effects should occur when <b>group</b> <b>interest</b> is weak. We compared these SJT predictions with identity management and hope for group advancement accounts that we deduced from social identity theory (SIT) and that suggest that both system justification and support for social change will be significant when <b>group</b> <b>interest</b> is strong. Consistent with the SIT-based accounts, Study 1 (N = 116, Malaysia, Mage = 19. 09 years) showed that strong identifiers were more concerned about their ingroup’s reputation than weak identifiers, and that this concern increased system justification but only before an outgroup audience to whom a need to present one’s group in good light is normally strong. Study 2 (N = 375, Australia, Mage = 23. 59 years) conceptually replicated Study 1 ’s results and further revealed that strong identifiers justified the system due to the hope that their ingroup status would improve in the future. Finally, Study 3 (N = 132, Germany, Mage = 20. 34 years) revealed that system justification soothed anger and reduced support for social protest but only when <b>group</b> <b>interest</b> was strong (not weak).

40|$|The study {{examines}} rent seeking and <b>group</b> <b>interest</b> on petroleum income {{and the effect}} on the Nigerian economy. To achieve the objective of this paper, relevant secondary and primary data were obtained from published scholar works and questionnaires and relevant statistical models were used for analysis. The study reveals that rent seeking and <b>group</b> <b>interest</b> is a fundamental problem affecting the socio-economic and political development of Nigeria with impunity by the political class, the mafia, militants, Boko Haram and oil cabals in order to share in the resource pie {{as a result of the}} huge petroleum income accruable to the nation. It does not only penalize or disrupt productive activities, distorts the entire economy and hinders economic growth where significant percent of public funds and oil revenue are diverted into their personal accounts and private pockets. On the basis of this result, the paper concludes that for the huge amount of petroleum income in Nigeria to improve the living standards of the people, the citizens must show a high level of ethical behavior of integrity, honesty and accountability for the level of massive corruption in the country to be minimized for the citizens to benefit from the huge petroleum income in Nigeria...|$|E
