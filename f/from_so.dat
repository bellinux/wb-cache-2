5|$|Realizing {{that another}} {{rejection}} {{would not be}} politically feasible, opponents of reform decided to use amendments to change the bill's essential character; for example, they voted to delay consideration of clauses in the bill that disfranchised the rotten boroughs. The ministers {{believed that they were}} left with only one alternative: to create a large number of new peerages, swamping the House of Lords with pro-reform votes. But the prerogative of creating peerages rested with the king, who recoiled <b>from</b> <b>so</b> drastic a step and rejected the unanimous advice of his cabinet. Lord Grey then resigned, and the king invited the Duke of Wellington to form a new government.|$|E

25|$|A {{particular}} difficulty posed the logistical problems {{of handling the}} several thousand logographs whose command is required for full literacy in Chinese language.

5000|$|For the Sakya and Nyingma schools, the {{difference}} is of minor importance.

Refraining <b>from</b> doing <b>so</b> is a Prāsangika approach.|$|R

25|$|While {{the career}} field was still young {{and lacking in}} {{manpower}} <b>from</b> <b>so</b> little Army pathfinder transfers, Air Force headquarters solicited from radio maintenance career field for more Combat Controllers.

Because of their job, Combat Controllers had to have either an air traffic control AFSC or a radio maintenance AFSC in addition to jump school to become a Combat Controller. This gave rise to blousing trousers and wearing paratrooper boots, a tradition that still exists to the present.|$|E
