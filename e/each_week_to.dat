5|$|On 2 February 1996, {{the tunnel}} company had an {{agreement}} with Bru og Tunnelskelskapet, which operates the Bergen Toll Ring, to collect the tolls in the tunnel using the Autopass automatic toll collection system. A manual collection system was estimated to cost NOK1.4 million per year, while an automated system was estimated at NOK0.4 million. The tunnel opened on 7 May 1996, {{the same day the}} last ferry ran. Originally the plan was to charge tolls similar to the ferry. With a manual system, it would not be possible to charge for two-wheeled vehicles and passengers, so the fares for other vehicles were raised slightly. In 1995, it had cost NOK44 for a single passing with a car on the ferry. The tolls were set to NOK120 for all types of vehicles, except two-wheelers, and NOK72 was charged per travel with pre-paid ticket books. Bus riders had to pay for two extra zones. The toll plaza was open a few hour <b>each</b> <b>week</b> <b>to</b> allow people to purchase discounted tickets.|$|E

5|$|Hines was traumatised by his {{experiences}} during World War I. For 40 years afterwards {{he lived in}} a humpy made of cloth bags near Mount Druitt on the outskirts of Sydney, and never married. The humpy was surrounded by a fence on which he hung helmets taken from German soldiers; he became well known to locals, though school children were afraid of him. Hines was unable to find consistent work, and lived on his Army pension as well as income from odd jobs and selling his souvenirs. He gained renewed fame when the photo of him at Polygon Wood was displayed at the temporary Australian War Museum in Sydney (the predecessor of the Australian War Memorial) from 1933, and several newspapers and magazines aimed at former servicemen published profiles of him. An article in the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia's magazine Reveille in 1934 highlighted Hines' desperate living conditions and stated that he had been unemployed for four years. Several former soldiers sent money to him in response to this article. Hines' pension was also doubled, though this income made him ineligible for relief work during the Great Depression. Despite his poverty, Hines travelled to Concord Repatriation Hospital <b>each</b> <b>week</b> <b>to</b> donate a suitcase of vegetables from his garden to the former soldiers being treated there.|$|E
