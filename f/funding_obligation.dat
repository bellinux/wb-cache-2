We use a polynomial goal programming model to create optimal portfolios of hedge funds, conditional to investor preferences and diversification constraints (maximum allocation per strategy). For each portfolio we build CFO structures that have different levels of leverage, and analyze both the stand alone performance as well as potential diversification benefits (low systematic risk exposures) of investing in the Equity Tranche of these structures. We find that the unconstrained mean-variance portfolio yields a high performance, but greater exposure to systematic risk. We observe the exact opposite picture in the case of unconstrained optimization where a skewness bias is added, thus proving the existence of a trade-off between stand alone performance and low exposure to systematic risk factors. We provide evidence that leveraged exposure to these hedge fund portfolios through the structuring of CFOs creates value for the Equity Tranche investor.

40|$|Abstract. Collateralized Funds of Hedge <b>Fund</b> <b>Obligations</b> (CFOs) are rel-atively recent {{structured}} finance products {{linked to the}} performance of un-derlying funds of hedge funds. The capital structure of a CFO is similar to traditional Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs), meaning that investors are offered different rated notes and equity interest. CFOs are structured as arbitrage market value CDOs. The fund of funds manager actively manages the fund to maximize total return while limiting price volatility within the guidelines of the structure. The aim {{of this paper is to}} provide a useful framework to evaluate Collateral-ized Funds of Hedge <b>Fund</b> <b>Obligations,</b> that is pricing the equity and the debt tranches of a CFO.

The value of every tranche depends on the evolution of the collateral portfolio during the life of the contract.

While a financial liberalization yields efficiency gains, adverse macroeconomic effects can arise if the creditworthiness of the nonfinancial sector is weak. In this situation, financial liberalization may also increase the authoritiesâ€™ expected deposit insurance <b>funding</b> <b>obligations</b> even with strong prudential supervision. Moreover, given the distortions in a repressed financial system, an increase in the required bank capital-asset ratio may increase the <b>funding</b> <b>obligations</b> associated with deposit insurance, particularly when the debt-servicing capacity of nonfinancial firms is low.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{contribution}} is to provide an extension to a model developed by Tassinari and Corradi [9] to price equity and debt tranches of a Collateralized fund of hedge <b>fund</b> <b>Obligations.</b> Since the value of every tranche depends on the evolution of the collateral portfolio during the life of the contract, the idea is to evaluate each CFO liability as an option on the underlying basket of hedge funds. The proposed model is able to capture skewness, excess-kurtosis in hedge fundsâ€™ log-returns distribution and to generate a more complex dependence structure than the linear one. At the same time, this new model can be calibrated to the empirical correlation matrix. Finally, the adopted approach allows to find explicit relations among physical and risk neutral processes and distributions at both marginal and joint level...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to describe and compare mutual funds in the Czech Republic. In the theoretical part I will explain what mutual funds are, {{and how they are}} traded. I will also explain how the funds are classified, and how they are regulated by the legislation. The history of collective investing and mutual funds in the world and in the Czech Republic will be mentioned also. At the end of the theoretical part is mentioned the economic recession, which has had great effect on the mutual funds, and investing in general. The main goal of this thesis is included in the practical part, where I carefully chose a total of twenty mutual funds of the five main investment companies based in the Czech Republic. There are four kinds of funds to compare: The equity <b>funds,</b> <b>obligation</b> <b>funds,</b> mixed funds and monetary fund. The indicators that will be compared in every category of funds will be: performance, volatility and fees. There is also a comparison which analyzes what fund in each category has withstood the test of recession, and what fund has failed. The results of the comparison are commented, giving possible reasons what could have caused such a performance...|$|R
40|$|Loan spreads are {{analysed}} for {{two types of}} loans.

The parameters of the process are inferred from the option volatility surface by treating equity options as compound options with equity itself being viewed as an option on the asset value with a strike set at the debt level following Merton (1974). Using data on General Motors stock during the year 2002 / 2003, we show that the use of spectrally negative LÃ©vy processes is capable of delivering realistic spreads without inâ€¡ating debt levels, deâ€¡ating debt maturities or deviating from the estimated probability laws.
