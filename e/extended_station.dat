50|$|The third change made to The Legend was an {{extension}} of the station. Adding a second train necessitated that an independent brake zone be added. The track already had a brake zone, but it would have allowed an incoming train to get too close to a train parked in the station to be considered safe. In response, the park extended the station so that a train parked in the station would be have a buffer roughly the size of a full train.

40|$|The Fukushima Daiichi {{nuclear power}} plant {{accident}} shows that natural disasters such as earthquakes and the subsequent tsunamis can cause station blackout for several days. The electric energy required for essential systems during a station blackout is provided from emergency backup batteries installed at the {{nuclear power plant}}. In South Korea, {{in the event of}} an <b>extended</b> <b>station</b> blackout, the life of these emergency backup batteries has recently been extended from 8 hours to 24 hours at Shin-Kori 5, 6, and APR 1400 for design certification. For a battery life of 24 hours, available safety means system, equipment and procedures are studied and analyzed in their ability to cope with an <b>extended</b> <b>station</b> blackout. A sensitivity study of reactor coolant pump seal leakage is performed to verify how different seal leakages could affect the system. For simulating <b>extended</b> <b>station</b> blackout scenarios, the best estimate MARS-KS computer code was used. In this paper, an APR 1400 RELAP 5 input deck was developed for station blackout scenario to analyze operation strategy by manually depressurizing the reactor coolant system through the steam generator's secondary side. Additionally, a sensitivity study on reactor coolant pump seal leakage was carried out...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFollowing the Fukushima {{accident}} and its <b>extended</b> <b>station</b> blackout, attention {{was brought to}} the importance of the spent fuel pools' (SFPs) behavior in case of a prolonged loss of the cooling system. Since then, many analytical works have been performed to estimate the timing of hypothetical fuel uncovery for various SFP types. Experimentally, however, little was done to investigate issues related to the formation of a flammable gas mixture, distribution, and stratification in the SFP building itself and to some extent assess the capability for the code to correctly predict it. This paper presents the main outcomes of the Experiments on Spent Fuel Pool (ESFP) project carried out under the auspices of Swissnuclear (Framework 2012 – 2013) in the PANDA facility at the Paul Scherrer Institut in Switzerland. It consists of an experimental investigation focused on hydrogen concentration build-up into a SFP building during a predefined scaled scenario for different venting positions. Tests follow a two-phase scenario. Initially steam is released to mimic the boiling of the pool followed by a helium/steam mixture release to simulate the deterioration of the oxidizing spent fuel. Results shows that while the SFP building would mainly be inerted by the presence of a high concentration of steam, the volume located below the level of the pool in adjacent rooms would maintain a high air content. The interface of the two-gas mixture presents the highest risk of flammability. Additionally, it was observed that the gas mixture could become stagnant leading locally to high hydrogen concentration while steam condenses. Overall, the experiments provide relevant information for the potentially hazardous gas distribution formed in the SFP building and hints on accident management and on eventual retrofitting measures to be implemented in the SFP building...|$|E

50|$|Medium-capacity {{systems have}} {{restricted}} growth capacities as ridership increases. For example, {{it is difficult}} to <b>extend</b> <b>station</b> platforms once a system is in operation, especially for underground railway systems, since this work must be done without interfering with traffic. Some railway systems, like Hong Kong and Wuhan, may make advance provisions for longer platforms, for example, so {{that they will be able}} to accommodate trains with more, or longer cars, in the future. Taipei Metro, for example, constructed extra space for two extra cars in all its Wenhu Line stations.|$|R

40|$|The {{suppression}} pool in a BWR plant {{not only is}} the major heat sink within the containment system, but also provides major emergency cooling water for the reactor core. In several accident scenarios, such as LOCA and <b>extended</b> <b>station</b> blackout, thermal stratification tends to form in the pool after the initial rapid venting stage. Accurately predicting the pool stratification phenomenon is important because it affects the peak containment pressure; and the pool temperature distribution also affects the NPSHa (Available Net Positive Suction Head) and therefore the performance of the pump which draws cooling water back to the core. Current safety analysis codes use 0 -D lumped parameter methods to calculate the energy and mass balance in the pool and therefore have large uncertainty in prediction of scenarios in which stratification and mixing are important. While 3 -D CFD methods can be used to analyze realistic 3 D configurations, these methods normally require very fine grid resolution to resolve thin substructures such as jets and wall boundaries, therefore long simulation time. For mixing in stably stratified large enclosures, the BMIX++ code has been developed to implement a highly efficient analysis method for stratification where the ambient fluid volume is represented by 1 -D transient partial differential equations and substructures such as free or wall jets are modeled with 1 -D integral models. This allows very large reductions in computational effort compared to 3 -D CFD modeling. The POOLEX experiments at Finland, which was designed to study phenomena relevant to Nordic design BWR {{suppression pool}} including thermal stratification and mixing, are used for validation. GOTHIC lumped parameter models are used to obtain boundary conditions for BMIX++ code and CFD simulations. Comparison between the BMIX++, GOTHIC, and CFD calculations against the POOLEX experimental data is discussed in detail...|$|E
40|$|Sparse {{information}} about the wind climate of South Africa behooves {{an exploration of the}} drivers of surface wind speed, especially in the context of wind resource assessment. This work quantifies the coupling between the synoptic circulation states and station-scale flows to develop a process-based regionalisation of wind regimes over the country. A thorough inspection of available South African Weather Service (SAWS) wind records is conducted and a quality control procedure is applied. The procedure reveals {{a large proportion of the}} data are missing and existing data contain numerous errors such that only 107 of the original 960 stations passed the quality control criteria. However, data from these 107 stations only overlap temporally 2 % of the time, which makes the data inappropriate fora regionalisation procedure. To ameliorate this, a method for incorporating bias-corrected time series data from a reanalysis data set is developed. Data from the 0. 3 ◦ resolution hourly Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) be-tween 1989 - 2010 is selected to improve the temporal coverage of the station data. The raw CFSR data overestimates wind speeds and underestimates the temporal variability and long-term trends. A bias correction method based on the wind speed and direction, time of day and month of the year is developed which successfully removes the mean error on wind speed and direction and improves the correlation with station records. This is achieved without disrupting spatial correlation patterns. Corrected and extended wind time series from each station site are used for the regionalisation. The regionalisation uses a self-organising map (SOM) to define the archetypal synoptic circulation patterns in the reanalysis data set and the influence of these on the local wind climate is quantified. 12 representative atmospheric states are defined by the SOM that are consistent with the existing literature and capture the major synoptic circulation states. A hierarchical clustering is then used to define wind climate regions based on the coupling between these circulation states and the <b>extended</b> <b>station</b> data. Six relatively cohesive spatial wind-climate groupings are identified that are physically consistent with the driving synoptic environment and are characteristic in terms of terrain and response to synoptic drivers. This process-based regionalisation facilitates a future assessment of potential changes in the wind climate of South Africa as a result of a warming world...|$|E
