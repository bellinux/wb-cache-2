25|$|In early 2005, Rendell made {{statements}} {{that seemed to}} support President George W. Bush's Social Security privatization proposal. Rendell addressed this issue in later speeches, saying that he opposes social security privatization, and that his previous comments were meant to show admiration <b>for</b> <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> for taking on a politically risky subject. Nevertheless, Rendell's initial statements cost him support among Democrats who are against Social Security privatization.|$|E
500|$|Bin Laden claimed, in 2004, {{that the}} idea of {{destroying}} the towers had first occurred to him in 1982, when he witnessed Israel's bombardment of high-rise apartment buildings during the 1982 Lebanon War. Some analysts, including Mearsheimer and Walt, also claim that one motivation for the attacks was U.S. support of Israel. In 2004 and 2010, bin Laden again connected the September 11 attacks with U.S. support of Israel, although most of the letter expressed bin Laden's disdain <b>for</b> <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> and bin Laden's hope to [...] "destroy and bankrupt" [...] the U.S.|$|E

2500|$|In the November election, Hostettler was soundly defeated, taking 39 {{percent of}} the vote to Ellsworth's 61 percent. His defeat was the first {{announced}} that night. [...] The 22-point margin was the largest margin of defeat for an incumbent in the 2006 cycle, and the second-biggest margin of a defeat in a Republican-held district. Hostettler was the only incumbent in either party who did not receive 40% of the vote, although a few Senators such as Rick Santorum and Mike DeWine came close. The 8th district vote tally for Ellsworth was only 1% shy of the same district's tally <b>for</b> <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> in 2004.|$|E
2500|$|On August 13, 2009, during Netroots Nation, {{when confronted}} by LGBT activist Lane Hudson, Clinton {{explained}} {{that he had to}} sign DOMA in order to prevent a constitutional amendment that would proscribe same-sex marriage: [...] "We were attempting at the time, in a very reactionary Congress, to head off an attempt to send a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage to the states. [...] And {{if you look at the}} eleven referenda much later—in 2004, in the election—which the Republicans put on the ballot to try to get the base vote <b>for</b> <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> up, I think it's obvious that something had to be done to try to keep the Republican Congress from presenting that." ...|$|E
2500|$|On April 28, 2004, {{six days}} after Tillman's death, McChrystal {{approved}} a final draft of the Silver Star recommendation and submitted it to the acting Secretary of the Army, even though the medal recommendation deliberately omitted any mention of friendly fire, included the phrase [...] "in the line of devastating enemy fire", and was accompanied by fabricated witness statements. On April 29, McChrystal sent an urgent memo warning White House speechwriters not to quote the medal recommendation in any statements they wrote <b>for</b> <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> because it [...] "might cause public embarrassment if the circumstances of Corporal Tillman's death become public."

2500|$|After losing New Mexico to Al Gore in 2000 by just 366 votes, President Bush's reelection set its {{sights on}} {{claiming}} {{the only state}} that borders Texas not to go <b>for</b> <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> in 2000. [...] To that end, the campaign dispatched Jennings to manage its operations. [...] Jennings arrived in early 2004 to find a divided state Republican Party. [...] Shortly after his arrival, the state party chairman, State Senator Ramsay Gorham, resigned both her chairmanship and legislative seat and {{moved out of the}} state. [...] Jennings and Republican Party counterpart Jay McCleskey set about repairing the damaged party, trying to focus activists on the campaign at hand rather than the factionalism. [...] The two worked together to recruit fifteen-thousand volunteers who operated phone banks, went door to door, and executed a grassroots strategy that relied heavily on peer-to-peer, coalition-based activity. [...] The Democratic establishment spent millions of dollars in the state through the Kerry for President Campaign, the state Democratic Party, and through a host of third-party organizations such as American Coming Together and Moveon.org. [...] The Democrats relied primarily on paid workers; the Bush Campaign and Republican Party utilized mostly volunteer manpower. [...] Bush won the New Mexico election by 5,988 votes, {{making it one of the}} closest states in the nation.

2500|$|In a study {{published}} on April 18, 2007, by Yale professors Alan Gerber, Dean Karlan, and Daniel Bergan, citizens were given a subscription to either the conservative-leaning Washington Times or the liberal-leaning Washington Post to see the effect that media has on voting patterns. Gerber had estimated based on his work that the Post slanted {{as much to the}} left as the Times did to the right. Gerber found those who were given a free subscription of the Post were 7.9–11.4% more likely to vote for the Democratic candidate for governor than those assigned to the control group, depending on the adjustment for the date on which individual participants were surveyed and the survey interviewer; surprisingly, however, people who received the Times were also more likely than controls to vote for the Democrat, with an effect approximately 60% as large as that estimated for the Post. The study authors noted that sampling error might {{have played a role in}} the effect of the conservative-leaning Times, as might the fact that the Democratic candidate took more conservative-leaning positions than is typical for his party, and that [...] "the month prior to the post-election survey was a difficult period <b>for</b> <b>President</b> <b>Bush,</b> one in which his overall approval rating fell by approximately 4 percentage points nationwide. It appears that heightened exposure to both papers’ news coverage, despite opposing ideological slants, moved public opinion away from Republicans." ...|$|E
