40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{dynamics}} of evaporation <b>of</b> wetting <b>drops</b> <b>deposited</b> on textured surfaces. On top of these surfaces, a pillar array with a square pitch is deposited. The triple line dynamics and the evaporation kinetics are characterized by an interferometric method. A parametric study is realized by varying the geometrical parameters of the texture, namely the pillar radius, the pillar height and the pitch distance. The study highlights some typical evaporation dynamics according to these parameters: evaporation with a receding triple line, with a pinned triple line or with a spreading triple line. These several evaporation dynamics are qualitatively in agreement with a theoretical model, highlighting that the motor of the triple line motion during the evaporation is governed by the competition between the spreading due to the capillarity and the receding due to the evaporation. info:eu-repo/semantics/nonPublishe...|$|R
40|$|This PhD thesis {{collects}} different {{experimental studies}} {{in the field of}} wetting phenomena and open microfluidics, which analyze the behavior <b>of</b> liquid <b>drops</b> on free open surfaces. The main goal of such a research is to develop smart coatings featuring useful wetting properties (e. g. water repellent, antifogging and antireflection materials) or techniques aimed at manipulating droplets for chemical or biological applications. In particular this work considers both passive and active methods to control the statics and dynamics <b>of</b> <b>drops</b> <b>deposited</b> on an inclined plane and consequently subject to an external constant force, the gravity force. Among the passive techniques based on surface patterning, we investigated the adhesion properties of multiscale nano- and microstructured hairy surfaces made of polymers having different elasticity. Also, chemically patterned surfaces, formed by hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions of different shape (stripes, squares and triangles), have found to be an effective tool to passively tune drop sliding velocity. Chemically heterogeneous surfaces can affect not only sliding velocity, but also drop trajectory. To further investigate the deviation <b>of</b> a <b>drop</b> by means <b>of</b> a chemical pattern we considered a sample formed by only two regions featuring different wettability, i. e. a chemical step characterized by a linear interface. On the other hand, an active manipulation implies the application of an external field, as, for instance, electric, magnetic or acoustic. As active technique we considered asymmetric vibrations of the substrate, able to induce interesting and surprising dynamical behaviors: small droplets placed on a vertically oscillating inclined plane can stay pinned, slide down, but even climb up the surface against gravity. Even if the vast majority of our experiments involves ordinary liquids, in particular water and aqueous solutions, our research about sliding includes also the study of complex fluids, more precisely polymer solutions, exhibiting rheological properties (e. g. viscosity and elastic behaviors) depending on the applied stress...|$|R

The results obtained show that the coalescence rate depends mainly on three parameters: the droplets location on the insulating surface, the droplets volume and the distance between droplets. Drop-drop coalescence produces larger drop which are more sensitive to electric field. Large drop easily deforms, enabling electric current to flow between both electrodes.

40|$|The {{present study}} is an {{experimental}} investigation regarding the evaporation <b>of</b> ethanol <b>drops</b> <b>deposited</b> onto a heated substrate in a partial wetting situation. The originality of this work {{is based on the}} simultaneous observation of the kinetics of evaporation, heat and mass transfers, the triple-line dynamic, and thermal motions inside the drop. The triple line recedes during the drop evaporation and a spon- taneous development of thermal-convective instabilities driven by the evaporation are observed. These instabilities are interpreted as hydrothermal waves induced by surface tension gradient along the free surface. An infrared technique is used to inves- tigate the temporal and spatial dynamics of the hydrothermal waves.

This is lacking in literature, especially for drop impact on micro-textured surfaces. The effect <b>of</b> <b>drop</b> impact velocity and groove-texture geometry on the final shape adopted by water drops impacted on groove-textured surfaces is reported here. Water drops gently placed on groove-textured surfaces comprising trapezoidal (rectangular) pillars adopted the Wenzel (Cassie) state. Top view images of final equilibrium shape <b>of</b> water <b>drops</b> impacted on the groove-textured surfaces revealed a contrasting behavior between Wenzel and Cassie surfaces. At low impact velocity, the final drop shape on Wenzel surface is elongated more in the direction parallel to the grooves than perpendicular to grooves thereby exhibiting anisotropy whereas on Cassie surface the final drop shape is almost isotropic. As impact velocity increases, the anisotropy in final drop shape on Wenzel surface decreases whereas on Cassie surface it increases. The final drop spread factors and contact angles measured perpendicular and parallel to grooves show contrasting trends with impact velocity between Wenzel and Cassie surfaces. This is modelled through the difference between drop receding perpendicular and parallel to the grooves, resulting from a difference in liquid drop impregnation state, between the surfaces.

The answer {{is known to be}} in general a no, but we show that when the <b>density</b> <b>of</b> the <b>drop</b> is less than 1. 2 times that of the surrounding fluid, an equivalent bubble can be designed for small inertia and large surface tension.
