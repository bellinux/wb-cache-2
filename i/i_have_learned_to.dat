2500|$|... "The {{announcement}} of your eminent husband’s death comes a great shock to me. In common {{with all of}} his countrymen, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> revere him {{as one of the great}} benefactors.... and among the foremost Americans of all generations. He will be mourned and honored by human kind everywhere as one who served it greatly, untiringly and usefully"; ...|$|E
2500|$|Sabine Freudenberger, {{the first}} police officer {{to speak to}} Kampusch after her ordeal, {{said that she was}} {{astonished}} by her [...] "intelligence, her vocabulary". After two years, Přiklopil had brought her books, newspapers and a radio, which she kept tuned mainly to Ö1, an ORF station that is known for promoting education and classical music. She also states that she constantly had a feeling that she lacked something: [...] "a deficit. So I wanted to make that better and I tried to educate myself, to teach myself skills. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> knit for example." ...|$|E
2500|$|Of his fictional project, Berry has written: [...] "I {{have made}} the {{imagined}} town of Port William, its neighborhood and membership, {{in an attempt to}} honor the actual place where I have lived. By means of the imagined place, over the last fifty years, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> see my native landscape and neighborhood as a place unique in the world, a work of God, possessed of an inherent sanctity that mocks any human valuation that can be put upon it." [...] Elsewhere, Berry has said, [...] "The only thing I try to accomplish in fiction is to show how people act when they love each other." ...|$|E

60|$|As soon as <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> {{speak the}} {{language}} a little, I became greatly interested in {{the people and the}} system of government.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was given}} me long ago," [...] replied he, with a scornful {{expression}} in his eye, [...] "because <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> despise all things." ...|$|R
2500|$|Some {{critics of}} Italian fascism {{have said that}} much of the {{ideology}} was merely a by-product of unprincipled opportunism by Mussolini and that he changed his political stances merely to bolster his personal ambitions while he disguised them as being purposeful to the public. Richard Washburn Child, the American ambassador to Italy who worked with Mussolini and became his friend and admirer, defended Mussolini's opportunistic behaviour by writing: [...] "Opportunist is a term of reproach used to brand men who fit themselves to conditions for the reasons of self-interest. Mussolini, as <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> know him, is an opportunist {{in the sense that he}} believed that mankind itself must be fitted to changing conditions rather than to fixed theories, no matter how many hopes and prayers have been expended on theories and programmes". Child quoted Mussolini as saying: [...] "The sanctity of an ism is not in the ism; it has no sanctity beyond its power to do, to work, to succeed in practice. It may have succeeded yesterday and fail to-morrow. Failed yesterday and succeed to-morrow. The machine first of all must run!".|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah; well; no,--perhaps not. At any rate, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> {{forgive and}} forget. I am afraid your aunt is very ill, Miss Dorothy." ...|$|E
6000|$|Her face still brightened. [...] "Yes! yes! yes!" [...] she answered, eagerly. [...] "And you say <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> do it well, don't you?" ...|$|E
60|$|A {{few moments}} later the cone was jammed {{together}} and thrown upon the floor--a movement, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> know, that announced that the sitting was ended.|$|R
60|$|We both {{gazed out}} over the sea of gray-green, at the undulating waves of ground in the distance. On these rides with her <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> {{appreciate}} {{the beauty of the}} lonely reaches of plain.|$|R
60|$|We went to bed. Long {{after that}} I heard the swell and roar and crash and lull {{of the wind}} in the pines, a sound <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> love in Buckskin Forest with Buffalo Jones. At last I fell asleep.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Late {{enough for}} me. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> read {{and to write}} English a little at the madrissah. I shall soon be {{altogether}} a Sahib.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Lot's Wife!--Not Wife, but Mother. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> curse your {{motherhood}}, You {{pillar of}} salt accursed. I have cursed motherhood because of you, Accursed, base motherhood! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pray {{understand}} me. I am no Dives; but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> want so little, that I {{hardly know}} how to spend the little which I have." ...|$|E
5000|$|Afterward, the Russian generals {{came up to}} me, very friendly, {{and asked}} me how <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> speak Russian so fluently.... I {{explained}} that I was born in Russia, but had left there when I was twenty-two and now I was an American citizen.|$|R
5000|$|Boomer endeared {{himself to}} his {{followers}} when he wrote, [...] "Everything <b>I</b> <b>have</b> ever done in golf, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> do myself." ...|$|R
50|$|Because {{of all the}} nationalities there, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> play everything. At {{some jobs}} it was {{strictly}} German music, or Polish. Now, they used to dance and knock holes in the floor.|$|R
60|$|He {{listens to}} me with that far-away look that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> love {{and that means that}} he is {{thinking}} deeply; at times he almost seems not to hear.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] he said slowly, [...] "I cannot {{let it be}} like that. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> {{love you}} and you only, and I thought that you had known it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope I shall {{find you}} so,--always. And, of course, she is ridiculous--in your eyes. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> see it, and to regret it; but I shall never cease to love her." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{gone out}} one morning with my gun to procure a few fresh ptarmigan, {{accompanied}} by Big Otter. Our trusty Indian was beginning {{by that time}} to understand the English language, {{but he would not}} condescend to speak it. This, however, was of slight importance, as <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> jabber fluently in the native tongue.|$|R
6000|$|... "Did I do so much?" [...] {{asked the}} boy with {{innocent}} wonder; [...] "I never knew it, and always thought you had grown happier and kinder because <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> love you more. I'm very glad if I did anything for you, who do so much for us. But tell me of the book; you never would before." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes; Bishop is my name--Henry C. Bishop. It {{was this}} name which {{suggested}} the title which was playfully given to me. Before our compact was made <b>I</b> <b>had</b> told Miss Raybold all about my family. She {{did not ask}} me to do so, but I knew she desired the information, for <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> read those beautiful eyes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{the world}} says of me <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> {{disregard}} very much, Mr. Robarts. But I hope that I shall never disobey {{the authority of}} the Church when properly and legally exercised." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no, fair lady," [...] murmured he betwixt sighing and smiling; [...] "my {{taste is}} changed; <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> love what Nature makes {{better than my}} own creations {{in the guise of}} womanhood." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I might desire a cottage," [...] replied I; [...] "but I {{would have}} it founded on sure and stable truth, not on dreams and fantasies. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> look for the real and the true." ...|$|E
60|$|In a {{few minutes}} I heard {{a step in the}} hall. I knew it, and it was strange how soon <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> know it. She {{stopped in front of the}} office, then she went on towards the porch, and turning she came into the parlor, first looking towards the front of the room and then towards the place where I stood.|$|R
60|$|But I {{could not}} tell {{him that it was}} driving me out of the ship <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> love. And as I sat heavy-hearted at that parting, seeing all my plans destroyed, my modest future endangered--for this command was like a foot in the stirrup for a young man--he gave up {{completely}} for the first time his critical attitude.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr Whittlestaff, it {{does not}} signify a straw what I begrudge you." [...] Mr Whittlestaff had now come close to him, and was {{listening}} to him. [...] "Nor, as I take it, what you begrudge me. Before I left England she and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> love each other. It is so still. For the sake of her happiness, {{do you mean to}} let me have her?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To yours? No. It is {{not very}} long that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> disbelieve in that story altogether. I fancy {{it was an odd}} whim of my poor father's, and that our family were quite poor people.|$|E
6000|$|GIRL. No. They {{would not}} take a German, {{even if she was}} good. Besides, I don't want to be good any more--I am not a humbug; <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> be bad. Aren't you going to kees me, ni-ice boy? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is an {{interesting}} piece of news, David," [...] he answered, [...] "which you might have spared me. Mrs. Temple did not think herself necessary to my welfare when I was young, and now <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> live without her." ...|$|E
60|$|Some odd note in {{her tone}} troubled me, and I {{glanced at her}} quickly. She was a {{constant}} wonder and puzzle to me. After {{that night at the}} theatre my hopes had risen for the hundredth time, but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> gone to Prince George Street on the morrow to meet another rebuff--and Fitzhugh. So <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> interpret her by other means than words, and now her mood seemed reckless rather than merry.|$|R
6000|$|... "So <b>I</b> <b>have.</b> Do none confess but the guilty? What is {{all that}} we have read about the Inquisition and the old tortures? <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> that torturing <b>has</b> not gone out of the world;--that is all." ...|$|R
50|$|My goal, however, {{was not to}} make lots of money, but to {{influence}} people's thinking. To get them to think differently about waste, and give them tools to deal with it. Self-publishing my book was the way I could do that. So <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> {{be able to do}} so.|$|R
