40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to find answers to {{following}} questions: how to quantify costs of regeneration of selected <b>panel</b> <b>housing</b> estates and how to plan the process itself.

We can observe a number of deficiencies in <b>panel</b> <b>housing</b> estates (for example: lack of parking space, unsatisfactory capacity in education etc.). Postponing regeneration may cause not only higher financial demands, but also social, technical, and environmental problems, and it is therefore necessary to solve these deficiencies as soon as possible. Based on a comparison with already regenerated areas and standards for technical and civic amenities, standards of <b>housing</b> for selected <b>panel</b> <b>housing</b> estates will be defined.
