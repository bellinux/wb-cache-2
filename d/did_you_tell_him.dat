6000|$|... 'That was a {{very narrow}} escape,' said Stickly-Prickly. 'I don't rib Painted Jaguar. What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> that you were?' ...|$|E
6000|$|Cecily. [Takes {{the card}} and reads it.] 'Mr. Ernest Worthing, B. 4, The Albany, W.' Uncle Jack's brother! <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> Mr. Worthing was in town? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No {{matter what}} he's here for; he's here, and that's enough. I never knew of {{anything}} so perfectly providential. <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>TELL</b> <b>him,</b> Basil? Did you dare?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no, aunt; pray <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> first. I couldn't go to him; besides, {{he would}} <b>do</b> {{anything}} for <b>you,</b> you know. I {{want you to}} go to him--do, now, dear aunt--and tell him--not from me, but from yourself--how very, very much I--that is, how very very--but you will know what to say; only Frank must, must come back again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That he will, heartily. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> that <b>you</b> had {{a word or}} {{two with}} me here, and that I'll come up and call on him to-morrow." [...] Then he put his hand into his pocket, and {{whispering}} something, offered the lad money. But Sam turned away, and shook his head, and walked off. [...] "I don't believe that that fellow had any more to do with it than you or I," [...] said Fenwick.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, if he <b>does,</b> <b>you</b> must <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> to come up; that's all I know,' replied Nicholas. 'One of our hungry brethren, I suppose, Smike.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And what <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> in your answers? You said nothin' {{about our}} call {{down on the}} Spanish Main, {{the time you were}} left ashore, I hope, Jack?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! {{the dear}} Creature, cried I, how passionately he loves me! But dear Lady Scudamore <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> that I was totally {{dependant}} on my Uncle and Aunt?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When you {{did meet}} Mr. Fitzallen, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> nothing else except {{that you were}} engaged to me? Did you say nothing to him as to your {{feelings}} towards himself?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If," [...] said she, [...] "an ancient Briton in his skins {{came and}} contradicted me as <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> wouldn't <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> {{not to make}} an ass of himself?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I couldn't do that, Carbury. What's the use? I never write any letters, I can't <b>do</b> it. <b>You</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> that; and if {{the sale}} comes off, I'll make it straight.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>did</b> <b>you</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> that {{we found}} the skin long ago, and that the Indians must be far, far away by this time--nobody knows where?" [...] demanded Frank.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why {{the devil}} <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> I {{was on the}} Bench?' said Infant wrathfully to me. 'You know I ain't now. Why didn't he stay in his father's office? He's a raging blight!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{what did}} you give him, in return for such a compliment? <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> the Oldcastles were just so much stone, and wood, and old iron; and that, too, in a tumbledown condition?" ...|$|E
6000|$|THE FLOWER GIRL. Don't {{you be so}} saucy. You ain't {{heard what}} I come for yet. [To Mrs. Pearce, who is waiting at the door for further instruction] <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> I come in a taxi? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are right!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "Whatever he {{may have}} <b>done,</b> if <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> the truth he will give you that document. I am sure of it. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> {{know where to find}} him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At {{any rate}} I shan't try. Only {{remember}} this. Get her to {{promise to be}} firm, and then go at once to Sir Harry. Don't let there be an appearance of doubt in speaking to him. And if he <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> of the property,--angrily I mean,--then <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> of the title. Make him understand that you give {{as much as you}} get. I don't suppose he will yield at first. Why should he? You are not the very best young man about town, you know. But if you get her, he must follow. She looks like one that would stick to it, if she once had said it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Soit!" [...] he consented. [...] "For your sake, Mademoiselle, and in {{payment of}} the debt I owe you, I will go as I came. I shall not see the Citizen-marquis again. But <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> from me that if he sets any value on his life, he had best shake the dust of France from his feet. Too long already has he tarried, and at any moment those may arrive who will make him emigrate not only out of France but {{out of the world}} altogether. Besides, the {{peasantry}} that has risen once may rise again, and I shall not be here to protect him from its violence. <b>Tell</b> <b>him</b> he had best depart at once." ...|$|R
6000|$|STUDDENHAM. Harsh! [His {{eyes again}} move {{from side to}} side as if pain and anger had bewildered them. Then looking {{sideways}} at FREDA, but in a gentler voice] And when <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> about--what's come to you? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't know! Linda, that {{cannot be}} true. It {{is not yet}} half an hour since, {{and you do not}} know what Herr Molk said to you? <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> of my wish about our friend Peter?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Badgery {{held up a}} white hand. [...] "No more, no more. I find {{literature}} quite depressing enough. I {{insist that}} life at least shall be a little gayer. <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> I wanted him to paint my room?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mother, please desire Macrae to cut me {{the great}} white orchids. He won't <b>do</b> it unless <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him,</b> and I promised them for the Altar vases." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes!" [...] {{returned}} Mrs. Bowen vehemently, and arresting {{herself in}} her rapid movements. [...] "It won't <b>do</b> for <b>you</b> to <b>tell</b> <b>him,</b> and <b>you</b> won't let Mr. Colville." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Them {{other white}} man he do go dash me anyt'ing," [...] he said decisively. [...] "I savvy <b>him.</b> S'pose <b>you</b> <b>done</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>you</b> no go catch them book?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{the clerk}} says you are expecting your HUSBAND on the steamer. What does this mean? Why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> that?" [...] He {{had so far}} {{collected}} himself {{that there was a}} ring of inquisition in his voice.|$|E
6000|$|... "Edith," [...] {{she said}} in the cold, steady voice that, to those who knew her, meant {{breakers}} ahead for somebody, [...] "Mr. Spencer was here yesterday when I was riding with the Major, was he not? What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> about me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, there's nothing {{equal to}} his impudence. I do {{believe he would}} have come in here, if he hadn't seen me first. <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> when you were going back, father? Because he'd be at the train to see you off, just as sure!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What <b>did</b> Lucy <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> about <b>him?</b> She <b>did</b> {{not meet}} him!' cried Albinia, endeavouring not to betray her alarm. 'I mean, did she meet him?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then, my dear boy," [...] she began, [...] "even if <b>you</b> <b>do</b> feel <b>you</b> must <b>tell</b> <b>him,</b> {{there is}} surely {{no reason why}} it should not {{otherwise}} be kept secret." ...|$|R
6000|$|In {{answer to}} this the squire of Folking only shook his head. He would not even condescend {{to say that he}} had seen Brown, and {{certainly}} not to explain that Brown had seemed to him to be the most absurdly-cautious and courteously-dilatory man that he had ever met in his life. In Trumpington Street they parted, Mr. Caldigate proceeding at once to Folking, and Mr. Babington going to the office of Mr. Seely the attorney. 'He'll be out in a day or two,' said the man of Suffolk, again shaking his brother-in-law's hand; 'and <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> from me that I hope it won't be long before we see him at Babington. I've been true to him almost from the first, and his aunt has come over now. There is no one against him but Julia, and these are things of course which young women won't forget.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Certainly {{not before}} he comes. Mother, {{some of the}} {{wonderful}} bottle- --ay, you covetous miser of a woman, or I'll make a libation of it all. Audley, it must have wrung your father's butler's heart to have thrown away this port on a picnic. What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> to delude him?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'You {{took the}} flask out of Allan's hand,' he proceeded. 'You said to him, good-humoredly, [...] "You know you don't {{really like the}} wine, Mr. Armadale. Let me make you {{something}} which may be more to your taste. I have a recipe of my own for lemonade. Will you favor me by trying it?" [...] In those words, you made your proposal to him, and he accepted it. Did he also ask leave to look on, and learn how the lemonade was made? and <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> that he would only confuse you, and that you would give him the recipe in writing, if he wanted it?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I want {{to fasten}} {{it all in}} my mind," [...] she said [...] "before I go on. Mr. Michael Vanstone knew of the first will; he knew what {{prevented}} {{the making of the}} second will; he knew of the letter and he read the words. What did he know of besides? <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> of my mother's last illness? Did you say that her share in the money would have been left to us, if she could have lifted her dying hand in your presence? Did you try to make him ashamed of the cruel law which calls girls in our situation Nobody's Children, and which allows him to use us as he is using us now?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ach!" [...] exclaimed the German, [...] "now I know you, Mr. Brice. The {{young one}} from Boston the Judge spoke of. But <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> of your arrival." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For my father, I cannot help it. Had he not {{threatened}} me I {{should have}} told him also. As he has <b>done</b> so, <b>you</b> must <b>tell</b> <b>him.</b> But give him my kindest love." ...|$|R
60|$|FANNY [she leans across, {{puts her}} hand on his]. You're a dear, good fellow, George--always have been. I wouldn't plague you only it is {{absolutely}} necessary I should know--exactly what <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
