However, he himself thought his music too predictable, leaving him in a creative rut. He decided to write and produce his next album himself, surprising many others, given that Alun Davies, his close friend and first guitar in his backing band, and his producer, Paul Samwell-Smith in particular, were instrumental in assisting Stevens to form the <b>definitive</b> <b>signature</b> sound that had brought Stevens to {{the height of his}} stardom.

Two <b>definitive</b> <b>signatures</b> of site-specific termination [...] specific replication fork arrest and converging replication forks [...] were clearly detected at Ter sites, but not at dif.

40|$|We study {{systematically}} {{which features}} in {{the cosmic microwave background}} (CMB) and large-scale structure (LSS) probe various inhomogeneous properties of the dark sectors (including neutrinos, dark matter, and dark energy). We stress, and quantify by simple formulas, that the primary CMB anisotropies are very susceptible to the gravitational potentials during horizon entry, less at recombination. The CMB thus allows us to scan Φ +Ψ and the underlying dark kinetics for all redshifts z ∼ 1 − 10 5. LSS, on the other hand, responds strongest to Φ at low redshifts. Dark perturbations are often parameterized by the anisotropic stress and effective sound speed (stiffness). We find that the dark anisotropic stress and stiffness influence the visible species at the correspondingly early and late stages of horizon entry, and affect stronger respectively the CMB and LSS. The CMB yet remains essential to probing the stiff perturbations of light neutrinos and dark energy, detectable only during horizon entry. The clustering of dark species and large propagation speed of their inhomogeneities also map to distinctive {{features in the}} CMB and LSS. Any parameterization of the signatures of dark kinetics that assumes general relativity can effectively accommodate any modified gravity (MG) that retains the equivalence principle for the visible sectors. This implies that formally the nonstandard structure growth or Φ/Ψ ratio, while indicative, are not <b>definitive</b> MG <b>signatures.</b> The <b>definitive</b> <b>signatures</b> of MG may include the strong dependence of the apparent dark dynamics on visible species, its superluminality, and the nonstandard phenomenology of gravitational waves.

40|$|We {{describe}} a {{mechanism by which}} fermions in topologically trivial bands can form correlated states exhibiting a fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect upon introduction of strong repulsive interactions. These states are solid-liquid composites, in which a FQH liquid is induced by the formation of charge order (CO), following a recently proposed paradigm of symmetry-breaking topological (SBT) order [Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 216404 (2014) ]. We devise a spinless fermion model on a triangular lattice, featuring a topologically trivial phase when interactions are omitted. Adding strong short-range repulsion, we first establish a repulsion-driven CO phase at density ρ_CO= 2 / 3 particles per site, then dope the model to higher densities ρ = ρ_CO + ν/ 6. At ν= 1 / 3, 2 / 5 (ρ= 13 / 18, 11 / 15), we observe <b>definitive</b> <b>signatures</b> of both CO and the FQH effect [...] - sharply peaked static structure factor, gapped and degenerate energy spectrum and fractionally quantized Hall conductivity σ_H= 1 / 3, 2 / 5 [...] - over a range of all model parameters.

I generalize this result to propose that an incipient 3 D pion lattice structure may be formed during hadronization of a QGP. I then present a method to detect this structure in the transverse phase space of heavy-ion collisions which depends on local transverse Hubble flow. I also relate this correlation structure to recently proposed suppression of net charge and baryon-number fluctuations on rapidity after sudden traversal of the QCD phase boundary. The search for <b>definitive</b> <b>signatures</b> of QGP formation in heavy-ion collisions based on eventby-event fluctuation analysis is intensifying. Attention has focused on critical fluctuations (an excess) expected near the QCD phase boundary, and especially near a proposed critical end point [1].

The VERITAS array of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs), sensitive in the 0. 1 - 50 TeV regime, {{is in the process of}} completing a multi-year program aimed at detecting signatures of neutralino dark matter. This program is spread out over a range of astrophysical targets which can potentially yield <b>definitive</b> <b>signatures</b> of neutralino self-annihilation such as dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) and the center of the Milky Way galaxy. While the program is still in progress, initial results on dSphs have produced very competitive upper limits on the thermally averaged cross-section of neutralino self-annihilation as well as strongly constraining leptophillic dark matter models (such as those inferred from the PAMELA and AMS positron fraction results). As the program continues over the next 5 years, VERITAS observations will yield some of the strongest constraints available from IACTs, pushing down the limit on the thermally averaged cross-section of neutralino self-annihilation to the expected natural thermal relic scale.

40|$|A central {{tenet of}} motor {{neuroscience}} {{is that the}} cerebellum learns from sensory prediction errors. Surprisingly, neuroimaging studies have not revealed <b>definitive</b> <b>signatures</b> of error processing in the cerebellum. Furthermore, neurophysiologic studies suggest an asym-metry, such that the cerebellum may encode errors arising from unexpected sensory events, but not errors reflecting the omission of expected stimuli. We conducted an imaging study to compare the cerebellar response to {{these two types of}} errors. Participantsmade fast out-and-back reachingmovements, aiming either for an object that delivered a force pulse if intersected or for a gap between two objects, either of which delivered a force pulse if intersected. Errors (missing the target) could therefore be signaled either through {{the presence or absence of}} a force pulse. In an initial analysis, the cerebellar BOLD response was smaller on trials with errors compared with trials without errors. However, we also observed an error-related decrease in heart rate. After correcting for variation in heart rate, increased activation during error trials was observed in the hand area of lobulesV andVI. This effect was similar for the two error types. The results provide evidence for the encoding of errors resulting from either the unexpected presence or unexpected absence of sensory stimulation in the human cerebellum...|$|R

Yet, viruses such as HIV can cause chronic infections by evolving {{as quickly as the}} {{adaptive immune system}}, forming an evolutionary arms race. Here we introduce a mathematical framework to study the coevolutionary dynamics between antibodies and antigens within a host. We focus on changes in the binding interactions between the antibody and antigen populations, which result from the underlying stochastic evolution of genotype frequencies driven by mutation, selection, and drift. We identify the critical viral and immune parameters that determine the distribution of antibody-antigen binding affinities. We also identify <b>definitive</b> <b>signatures</b> of coevolution that measure the reciprocal response between antibodies and viruses, and we introduce experimentally measurable quantities that quantify the extent of adaptation during continual coevolution of the two opposing populations. Using this analytical framework, we infer rates of viral and immune adaptation based on time-shifted neutralization assays in two HIV-infected patients. Finally, we analyze competition between clonal lineages of antibodies and characterize the fate of a given lineage in terms {{of the state of the}} antibody and viral populations. In particular, we derive the conditions that favor the emergence of broadly neutralizing antibodies, which may have relevance to vaccine design against HIV...|$|R

40|$|This {{manuscript}} {{addresses the}} still popular but incorrect idea that monofractal (sometimes called “fractal” for short) structure {{might be a}} <b>definitive</b> <b>signature</b> of nonlinearity and, as a corollary, that monofractal analyses are nonlinear analyses. That this point (i. e., “fractal = nonlinear”) is incorrect remains novel to many readers. We suspect that unfamiliarity with autocorrelation has helped eclipse the linearity of fractal structure from more popular appreciation. In this paper, in order to explain the the linear nature of monofractality and its difference from multifractality, we present {{an introduction to the}} autocorrelation function and review short-lag memory, nonstationary motions, and the intermediary set of fractionally integrated processes that conventional fractal analyses quantify. Understanding from our own experiences how surprising the linearity of fractals is to accept, we attempt to make our points clear with as much graphic depiction as math.

40|$|Chirality plays a {{fundamental}} {{part in the}} activity of biological molecules and broad classes of chemical reactions, but detecting and quantifying it remains challenging 1. The spectroscopic methods of choice are usually circular dichroism and vibrational circular dichroism, methods that are forbidden in the electric dipole approximation 2. The resultant weak effects produce weak signals, and thus require high sample densities. In contrast, nonlinear techniques probing electric-dipole-allowed effects {{have been used for}} sensitive chiral analyses of liquid samples 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Here we extend this class of approaches by carrying out nonlinear resonant phase-sensitive microwave spectroscopy of gas phase samples in the presence of an adiabatically switched non-resonant orthogonal electric field; we use this technique to map the enantiomer-dependent sign of an electric dipole Rabi frequency onto the phase of emitted microwave radiation. We outline theoretically how this results in a sensitive and species-selective method for determining the chirality of cold gas-phase molecules, and implement it experimentally to distinguish between the S and R enantiomers of 1, 2 -propanediol and their racemic mixture. This technique produces a large and <b>definitive</b> <b>signature</b> of chirality, and has the potential to determine the chirality of multiple species in a mixture...|$|E

These observations reveal {{the presence of the}} high ionization [NeV] 14 µm and/or 24 µm line in 7 sources, providing strong evidence for AGNs in these galaxies. Taking into account the variable sensitivity of our observations, we find that the AGN detection rate based on mid-infrared diagnostics in optically normal late-type galaxies is ∼ 30 %, implying an AGN detection rate in late-type galaxies that is possibly 4 times larger than what optical spectroscopic observations alone suggest. We demonstrate using photoionization models with both an input AGN and an extreme EUV-bright starburst ionizing radiation field that the observed mid-infrared line ratios in our 7 AGN candidates cannot be replicated unless an AGN contribution, in some cases as little as 10 % of the total galaxy luminosity, is included. These models show that when the fraction of the total luminosity due to the AGN is low, optical diagnostics are insensitive to the presence of the AGN. In this regime of parameter space, the mid-infrared diagnostics offer a powerful tool for uncovering AGN missed by optical spectroscopy. The AGN bolometri...|$|R
40|$|For {{the search}} of Majorana fermions, we propose to employ a ramp-type Josephson edge {{junction}} between a normal metal such as Au, Ag or alloys of heavy metals and a topologically-trivial dx 2 -y 2 wave high-Tc superconductor YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7. The success in forming the elusive zero-energy Majorana bound states (MBS) at the junction relies crucially upon {{the strength of the}} Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) at the metal/superconductor interface, the tunneling direction, and the interface quality which includes a near zero tunnel barrier height. When these junction conditions are collectively satisfied, <b>definitive</b> <b>signatures</b> of Majorana fermions will emerge. After inspecting a vast amount of published data of junctions that are close to what we have proposed, we were able to find: 1) angular resonant Andreev reflection, and 2) quantized zero bias normalized differential conductance peak (ZBCP), as possible evidence for MBS formed at the junction interface. Encouraged by these findings, we have designed a MBS-supporting d-wave superconductor based pi-loop heterostructure as a qubit platform. Such pi-loops are characterized by a doubly degenerate half flux quantum vortex (HQV) and are topologically protected by a parity effect arising from an odd number of sign changes of the supercurrent circulating in the loop. The topological protection is further enhanced by the formation of RSOC induced Majorana bound states at the Josephson junction interface. The proposed MBS-plus-HQV qubit platform will be useful for demonstrating non-Abelian exchange statistics and for building a prototype topological quantum computer...|$|R

This is the first systematic mid-infrared search for weak or hidden active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in a statistically significant sample of bulgeless (Sd/Sdm) disk galaxies. Based on the detection of the high-ionization [NeV] 14. 3 µm line, we report the discovery of an AGN in {{one out of the}} 18 galaxies in the sample. This galaxy, NGC 4178, is a nearby edge-on Sd galaxy, which likely hosts a prominent nuclear star cluster (NSC). The bolometric luminosity of the AGN inferred from the [NeV] line luminosity is ∼ 8 × 10 41 ergs s − 1. This is almost two orders of magnitude greater than the luminosity of the AGN in NGC 4395, the best studied AGN in a bulgeless disk galaxy. Assuming that the AGN in NGC 4178 is radiating below the Eddington limit, the lower mass limit for the black hole is ∼ 6 × 10 3 M⊙. The fact that none of the other galaxies in the sample shows any evidence for an AGN demonstrates that while the AGN detection rate based on mid-infrared diagnostics is high (30 - 40 %) in optically quiescent galaxies with pseudobulges or weak classical bulges (Hubble type Sbc and Sc), it drops drastically in Sd/Sdm galaxies.

40|$|This {{chapter is}} a {{contribution}} to The Oxford Guide to Treaties (Duncan Hollis, ed., Oxford University Press, forthcoming 2012). Under international law, {{in order for a}} State to become a party to a treaty, it must express its consent to be bound by the treaty. Such consent can be expressed in a variety of ways, including through signature of the treaty by a proper representative of the State. Under modern treaty practice, however, States often express their consent to be bound by a separate act of ratification that is carried out after signature.

Nucleon decay, which typically appears {{within the context}} of unified theories, would provide a <b>definitive</b> <b>signature</b> of baryon number violation. In this dissertation, we report on the search results for p → e^+X, p →μ^+ (where X is an invisible, massless particle), n →νγ, p → e^+νν, p →μ^+νν, np → e^+ν, np →μ^+ν and np →τ^+ν nucleon and dinucleon decays at the Super-Kamiokande experiment. Some of these searches are novel. Using data from a combined exposure of 273. 4 kton·years and a χ^ 2 spectral fitting technique, a search for these decays yields a result consistent with no signal. Accordingly, lower limits on the partial lifetimes of τ_p → e^+ X > 7. 9 × 10 ^ 32 years, τ_n →νγ > 5. 5 × 10 ^ 32 years, τ_p →μ^+ X > 4. 1 × 10 ^ 32 years, τ_p → e^+νν > 1. 7 × 10 ^ 32 years, τ_p →μ^+νν > 2. 2 × 10 ^ 32 years, τ_np → e^+ν > 2. 6 × 10 ^ 32 years, τ_np →μ^+ν > 2. 0 × 10 ^ 32 years andτ_np →τ^+ν > 3. 0 × 10 ^ 31 years at a 90 % confidence level are obtained.

Pulsars are principal candidates for such sources, and many are expected to be detected by GLAST, some that are radio-selected, like most of the present EGRET/Comptel pulsars, and perhaps even more that are detected via independent pulsation searches. At this juncture, it is salient to outline the principal predictions of pulsar models that might aid identification of gamma-ray sources, and moreover propel subsequent interpretation of their properties. This review summarizes relevant characteristics of the polar cap model, emphasizing where possible distinctions from the competing outer gap model. Foremost among these considerations are the hard X-ray to gamma-ray spectral shape, high energy cutoffs and pulse profiles, and how these characteristics generally depend on pulsar period and period derivative, as well as observational viewing angle. The polar cap model exhibits <b>definitive</b> <b>signatures</b> that will be readily tested by the detections of GLAST and other experiments, thereby establishing cogent observational diagnostics.

40|$|Any cold, optically-thick {{matter in}} the {{vicinity}} of an accreting black hole, such as the accretion disk, can intercept and reprocess some fraction of the hard X-ray continuum emission, thereby imprinting atomic features into the observed spectrum. This process of `X-ray reflection' primarily gives rise to a broad reflection `hump' peaking at 30 keV and an iron emission line at 6. 4 keV. In this review, I briefly describe the physics of this process before reviewing the observations of these features in active galactic nuclei (AGN) and Galactic black hole candidates (GBHCs). In some AGN, Seyfert galaxies in particular, the iron line is found to be very broad and asymmetric. It is believed that such lines arise from the innermost regions of the accretion disk, with mildly-relativistic Doppler shifts and gravitational redshifts combining to produce the line profile. Hence, such lines give us a direct observational probe of the region within several gravitational radii of the black hole. The complications that plague similar studies of GBHCs, such as disk ionization and the possibly of inner disk disruption, are also addressed. I conclude with a discussion of iron line reverberation, i. e. temporal changes of the iron line as `echos' of large X-ray flares sweep across the accretion disk. It is shown that interesting reverberation effects, such as a <b>definitive</b> <b>signature</b> of extremal Kerr geometry, is within reach of high throughput spectrometers such as Constellation-X.

These include noble gas emissions from the reactors and chemical separations processes, the production of radionuclides in reactor cooling water followed by their subsequent release to the Columbia River, and the release of mildly contaminated process water from the chemical processing facilities. These signature materials are carried by both gaseous and liqid effluents and enter various compartments of the environment. The types of signature materials which {{are most likely to be}} accumulated are discussed, together with examples of the quantities which have been released during past separations. There are numerous processes by which natural uranium may be enriched to produce highly enriched U- 235. The most <b>definitive</b> <b>signature</b> of such processes is always a modification in uranium isotope ratios, and materials showing either enriched or depleted uranium in gaseous and liquid effluents provide the best indication that uramium enrichment processes are taking place. Therefore, techniques for {{sampling and}} analysis of airborne, waterborne, or deposited uranium in environmental matrices provide a means of detecting uranium enrichment which may lead to proliferation products...|$|E
40|$|Gas-phase ion/ion {{reactions}} {{involve the}} reaction of two oppositely charged ions within the mass spectrometer. There {{are two types of}} reactions that can occur during these rapid gas-phase chemistry reactions, particle transfer (e. g [...] , proton or electron transfer) and/or covalent bond formations. The area of selective covalent modification based on traditional solution-phase reactions represents a fairly new area of gas-phase chemistry. ^ The work demonstrated in this dissertation involves two gas-phase covalent modifications. The first being the reaction between carbenes generated from the singly deprotonated anion 1 -diazo- 2 -napthol- 4 -sulfonic acid and primary amines and/or hydroxyl groups. This reaction allows for more sequence information to be generated as well as represents the first gas-phase reaction with hydroxyl moieties. The second reaction involves Schiff base formation of unprotonated primary amines of peptides with the reagent anion 4 -formyl- 1, 3 -benzene disulfonic acid. Since the byproduct of a Schiff base reaction is the loss of water, and peptides are known to lose water readily in the gas-phase, there was no <b>definitive</b> <b>signature</b> for the reaction occurring. The aldehydic oxygen of the reagent anion was isotopically labelled with oxygen- 18 allowing for two distinct water losses to be observed, thus providing a signature for the covalent modification occurring. ^ Work in this dissertation also focuses on the selective gas-phase removal of alkali metal cations on peptides through ion/ion reactions with weakly coordinating anions. The carborane anion, CHB 11 Cl 11 -, was the only anion studied to show preferential removal of all alkali metal cations rather than the removal of protons. This work was expanded to be used on biopharmaceutically relevant polymers. By reacting the entire polymer distribution with the carborane anions, the spectra were able to be simplified to one singly charged, singly adducted distribution for more accurate mass determination...|$|E
40|$|We present {{mid-infrared}} spectra between 5. 2 and 38 µm for 26 disk-bearing {{members of}} the ∼ 5 Myr old Upper Scorpius OB association obtained with the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) onboard the Spitzer Space Telescope. We find clear evidence {{for changes in the}} spectral characteristics of dust emission between the early (B+A) and late-type (K+M) infrared excess stars. The early-type members exhibit featureless continuum excesses that become apparent redward of ∼ 8 µm. In contrast, 10 and 20 µm silicate features or PAH emission are present in {{all but one of the}} late-type excess members of Upper Scorpius. The strength of silicate emission among late-type Upper Scorpius members is spectral type dependent, with the most prominent features being associated with K 5 –M 2 type stars. By fitting the spectral energy distributions (SED) of a representative sample of lowmass stars with accretion disk models, we find that the SEDs are consistent with models having inner disk radii ranging from ∼ 0. 2 to 1. 2 AU. Complementary high resolution (R ∼ 33, 000) optical (λλ 4800 – 9200) spectra for the Upper Scorpius excess stars were examined for signatures of gaseous accretion. Of the 35 infrared excess stars identified in Upper Scorpius, only 7 (all late-type) exhibit <b>definitive</b> <b>signatures</b> of accretion. Mass accretion rates (˙ M) for these stars were estimated to range from 10 − 11 to 10 − 8. 9 M ⊙ yr − 1. Compared to Class II sources in Taurus-Auriga, the disk population in Upper Scorpius exhibits reduced levels of near and mid-infrared excess emission and an order of magnitude lower mass accretion rates. These results suggest that the disk structure has changed significantly over the 2 – 4 Myr in age separating these two stellar populations. The ubiquity of depleted inner disks in the Upper Scorpius excess sample implies that such disks are a common evolutionary pathway that persists for some time.

40|$|We have {{conducted}} a high-resolution spectroscopic study using Spitzer of 18 bulgeless (Sd/Sdm) galaxies that show no <b>definitive</b> <b>signatures</b> of nuclear activity in their optical spectra. This {{is the first}} systematic mid-IR search for weak or hidden AGNs in a statistically significant sample of bulgeless disk galaxies. Based on the detection of the high-ionization [NeV] line, we report the discovery of an AGN in {{one out of the}} 18 galaxies in the sample. This galaxy, NGC 4178, is a nearby edge-on Sd galaxy, which likely hosts a prominent nuclear star cluster (NSC). The bolometric luminosity of the AGN inferred from the [NeV] luminosity is ~ 8 e 41 ergs/s. This is almost two orders of magnitude greater than the luminosity of the AGN in NGC 4395, the best studied AGN in a bulgeless disk galaxy. Assuming that the AGN in NGC 4178 is radiating below the Eddington limit, the lower mass limit for the black hole is ~ 6 e 3 M_sun. The fact that none of the other galaxies in the sample shows any evidence for an AGN demonstrates that while the AGN detection rate based on mid-IR diagnostics is high (30 - 40 %) in optically quiescent galaxies with pseudobulges, it drops drastically in Sd/Sdm galaxies. Our observations therefore confirm that AGNs in completely bulgeless disk galaxies are not hidden in the optical but truly are rare. Of the three Sd galaxies with AGNs known so far, all have prominent NSCs, suggesting that {{in the absence of a}} well-defined bulge, the galaxy must possess a NSC in order to host an AGN. While the presence of a NSC appears to be a requirement for hosting an AGN in bulgeless galaxies, neither the properties of the NSC nor those of the host galaxy appear exceptional in late-type AGN hosts. The recipe for forming and growing a central black hole in a bulgeless galaxy therefore remains unknown. Comment: 17 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication in Ap...|$|R
30|$|The analyses, {{interpretation}} and synthesis of various information derived from well logs, 3 D seismic, core data {{as well as}} well test and production history data have aided the delineation of three (3) lithologic units with favorable petrophysical properties which were classified as hydrocarbon saturated clastic reservoirs. The delineated reservoir units presented characteristic serrated cylindrical and coarsening upward log motif signatures which indicate the reservoir sands to consist mainly of stacked sands and shale sequences. The <b>definitive</b> log <b>signatures</b> and lithologic distribution suggest fluvial–deltaic to barrier bar, middle–upper shoreface and tidal channel sands to open marine environments which suggest both vertical and lateral heterogeneous reservoir rocks across the Eni field. The 3 D seismic horizon mapping, especially as enhanced through reservoir property mapping, indicates the spatial distribution and variability of different petrophysical properties across each of the identified reservoir units. This implies heterogeneity which could result in some sections of the reservoir having slightly different reservoir properties than other.|$|R
