40|$|A {{barrier option}} is a {{financial}} derivative which includes an activation (or deactivation) clause within a standard vanilla option. For instance, a copper mining company could secure {{to sell in}} at least K dollars each ton of copper during the next year, by buying M European put options. However, it could purchase a less expensive derivative (a barrier option) which includes a clause which <b>deactives</b> the contract if ever the price of copper is below B dollars (for B<K) during {{the life of the}} contract. In practice, such barrier does not have to remain constant during the life of the contract. However, pricing a barrier derivative is only known for barriers that are represented by linear, quadratic, and square root functions. In this work we propose a new methodology for pricing barrier options that include a larger family of barriers not previously studied in the literature...|$|R
50|$|Gonçalo Mabunda uses Kalashnikovs, rockets, pistols, {{and shell}} casing {{in order to}} make {{anthropomorphic}} figures out of the deconstructed weapons. By turning weapons into life-like figures, Mabunda literally turns death into life. The figurines are also representative of the over 1 million people killed during his country’s civil war. Mabunda has also lost relatives during the war, which makes working with and deconstructing weapons used during the 16-year war more important for him. He is also famous for making thrones and masks out of these <b>deactived</b> weapons used during the Mozambique Civil War. The masks are based on traditional Sub-Saharan African masks, however, the original twist on the art form by creating them out of weapons is unique to Mabunda. Representing power, Mabunda’s thrones mocks how the traditional power rests on weapons. By using weapons, Mabunda’s work carries the message of how further violence can be prevented, and that destroying the weapons of war can be done in an aesthetic and artistic way. Mabunda’s art directly challenges the absurdity of war. His work has a modernist style to it and has been compared to the work of Braque and Picasso.|$|R
40|$|At {{the onset}} of the study, {{participants}} provided measures of their social support, familiarity with the environment, and emotionality. Participants then entered data daily for 2 weeks about their daily mood and the events that occurred each day. A series of multilevel random coefficient modeling analyses found that daily negative events co-varied with measures of negative affect and daily positive events co-varied with measures of positive affect, self-esteem, and depression. Participants who reported higher measures of trait-level anxiety were found to have significantly lower mean levels of daily self-esteem. Both anxiety and fearfulness were found to be negatively related to BDI measures, and negatively related to positive <b>deactive</b> affect. Anxiety was also found to be positively related to negative active affect and negative <b>deactive</b> affect. Fearfulness was negatively related to positive active affect. Sentimentality was found to be positively related to daily self-esteem, BDI scores, and positive active affect. Conversely, sentimentality was found to be negatively related to both negative active and negative <b>deactive</b> affect. Increased social support from both family and friends leads to higher average ratings of daily self-esteem. Support from friends was negatively related to depression and daily negative <b>deactive</b> affect. Family support was linked to higher average ratings of positive active affect. Familiarity with the environment was found to be predictive of measures of daily well-being. Academic adjustment was positively related to daily self-esteem and depression outcomes. Social adjustment was negatively related to depression. Personal-Emotional adjustment was positively related to self-esteem and positive active and <b>deactive</b> affect.

40|$|Complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) {{is central}} to energy {{metabolism}} in mammalian mitochondria. It couples NADH oxidation by ubiquinone to proton transport across the energy-conserving inner membrane, catalyzing respiration and driving ATP synthesis. In the absence of substrates, ‘active’ complex I gradually enters a pronounced resting or ‘deactive’ state. The active-deactive transition occurs during ischemia and is crucial for controlling how respiration recovers upon reperfusion. Here, we set a highly-active preparation of Bos taurus complex I into the biochemically-defined <b>deactive</b> state, and used single-particle electron cryomicroscopy to determine its structure to 4. 1 Å resolution. We show that the <b>deactive</b> state arises when critical structural elements that form the ubiquinone-binding site become disordered, and we propose reactivation is induced when substrate binding to the NADH-reduced enzyme templates their reordering. Our structure both rationalizes biochemical data on the <b>deactive</b> state, and offers new insights into its physiological and cellular roles...|$|E

In addition certain theoretical aspects of optimalising control are presented. Design criteria and {{details of the}} circuitry of the experimental controller, built {{as part of this}} research project, are given. The necessity to deactivate the controller, for a certain period during each cycle of operation, is shown to be a result of measurement delay in the optimalising loop, and an expression for evaluating the <b>deactive</b> time is derived. Utilising describing function techniques, the steady-state response of the control system is predicted and the results are shown to be in good agreement with the experimental results. The adaptive response of the system is investigated and it is shown that the bandwidth of the adaptive response maybe predicted from steady-state response characteristics. The limitations imposed upon both the steady-state and adaptive response, by measurement delay, are shown. With respect to the theory of optimalising control, a framework for stability analysis is developed and stability criteria for the basic optimalising control loop are derived...|$|E
40|$|Every {{day for two}} weeks, {{participants}} at four sites (2 in the US, 1 in Canada, and 1 in Japan) described their self-esteem and affect and they described the events that occurred each day. Multilevel random coefficient modeling analyses found that the self_esteem of Japanese participants changed more in reaction to daily social events (both positive and negative) than it did for North American participants. For positive social events, the Japanese were more reactive in terms of positive affect than North Americans. For negative social events, the Japanese were more reactive in terms of depressed mood (ND) and <b>deactive</b> positive affect (PD) than North Americans. In contrast, the Japanese were less reactive to negative achievement events than North Americans in terms of PA and anxious mood. The Japanese were more reactive than North Americans to positive achievement events in terms of PA and ND. The results highlight the greater sensitivity of the Japanese to social concerns compared to North Americans, and the greater affective sensitivity of North Americans to failure in achievement domains...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} hemicyanine dimers, (B 3, B 5, and B 12) whose two chromophores are linked by {{different}} numbers of methylene groups, are synthesized. Negative slovatochromic behaviors are observed, and the fluorescence quantum yield {{is sensitive to}} the polarity of solvent. In chloroform, the fluorescence intensity is much more intensive than in other polar solvents, and the decay lifetime is much longer. This fluorescence sensitivity to solvent {{is due to the}} twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) state formation, which can be blocked in weak polar solvent. The two chromophores in one dimer molecule are correlated and the TICT formation of dimer is relatively difficult compared with monomer. When the linkage is long enough, this correlation can be reduced. The dynamic fluorescence spectra of the chloroform solutions of these dyes support our assumption. The time-resolved fluorescence studies of their LB films provide a new perspective on the excited-state <b>deactive</b> process. The two-dimensional Förster energy transfer between the chromphores within monolayer is assumed {{to play an important role}} of their excited states in these LB samples. The difference of the proportions of energy transfer is supposed to be the responsible for the difference of their photoelectro conversion efficiencies. 1...|$|E
40|$|Mitochondrial complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) {{undergoes}} reversible deactivation upon incubation at 30 – 37 °C. The active/deactive transition {{could play}} an important role in the regulation of complex I activity. It has been suggested recently that complex I may become modified by S-nitrosation under pathological conditions during hypoxia or when the nitric oxide:oxygen ratio increases. Apparently, a specific cysteine becomes accessible to chemical modification only in the <b>deactive</b> form of the enzyme. By selective fluorescence labeling and proteomic analysis, we have identified this residue as cysteine- 39 of the mitochondrially encoded ND 3 subunit of bovine heart mitochondria. Cysteine- 39 is located in a loop connecting the first and second transmembrane helix of this highly hydrophobic subunit. We propose that this loop connects the ND 3 subunit of the membrane arm with the PSST subunit of the peripheral arm of complex I, placing it in a region that is known to be critical for the catalytic mechanism of complex I. In fact, mutations in three positions of the loop were previously reported to cause Leigh syndrome with and without dystonia or progressive mitochondrial disease...|$|E
40|$|For S-nitrosothiols and peroxynitrite to {{interfere}} with the activity of mitochondrial complex I, prior transition of the enzyme from its active (A) to its <b>deactive,</b> dormant (D) state is necessary. We now demonstrate accumulation of the D-form of complex I in human epithelial kidney cells after prolonged hypoxia. Upon reoxygenation after hypoxia there was an initial delay in the return of the respiration rate to normal. This was due to the accumulation of the D-form and its slow, substrate-dependent reconversion to the A-form. Reconversion to the A-form could be prevented by prolonged incubation with endogenously generated NO. We propose that the hypoxic transition from the A-form to the D-form of complex I may be protective, because it would act to reduce the electron burst and the formation of free radicals during reoxygenation. However, this may become an early pathophysiological event when NO-dependent formation of S-nitrosothiols or peroxynitrite structurally modifies complex I in its D-form and impedes its return to the active state. These observations provide a mechanism to account for the severe cell injury that follows hypoxia and reoxygenation when accompanied by NO generation...|$|E

The fluorescence decay curves of these dyes can be well fitted by {{the sum of}} several exponential decays in the shorter wavelengths and by {{the sum of the}} exponential rise(s) with decay(s) in the longer wavelengths. The fact that the values of longest lifetime component at longer wavelengths tend to be a constant proves the existence of a “sink” region on the potential energy surface of excited state. This sink region is around the TICT state, by which the nonradiative transition dominates the <b>deactive</b> decay paths of excited state. The time dependent Stokes shift function analysis of these four dye molecules in methanol indicates that the B 5 ’s unique “solvation” behavior is different from others. This difference is contributed by the increased difficulty of the TICT formation of B 5 originated from its folded conformation. The time dependent Stokes shifts of M, B 3, and B 12 are due to not only solvation dynamics but also TICT formation.

40|$|Mitochondrial complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) is a {{key enzyme}} in {{cellular}} energy metabolism and provides approximately 40 % of the proton-motive force that is utilized during mitochondrial ATP production. The dysregulation of complex I function [...] either genetically, pharmacologically, or metabolically induced [...] has severe pathophysiological consequences that often involve an imbalance {{in the production of}} reactive oxygen species (ROS). Slow transition of the active (A) enzyme to the <b>deactive,</b> dormant (D) form takes place during ischemia in metabolically active organs such as the heart and brain. The reactivation of complex I occurs upon reoxygenation of ischemic tissue, a process that is usually accompanied by an increase in cellular ROS production. Complex I in the D-form serves as a protective mechanism preventing the oxidative burst upon reperfusion. Conversely, however, the D-form is more vulnerable to oxidative/nitrosative damage. Understanding the so-called active/deactive (A/D) transition may {{contribute to the development of}} new therapeutic interventions for conditions like stroke, cardiac infarction, and other ischemia-associated pathologies. In this review, we summarize current knowledge on the mechanism of A/D transition of mitochondrial complex I considering recently available structural data and site-specific labeling experiments. In addition, this review discusses in detail the impact of the A/D transition on ROS production by complex I and the S-nitrosation of a critical cysteine residue of subunit ND 3 as a strategy to prevent oxidative damage and tissue damage during ischemia-reperfusion injury.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work {{is to determine the}} atomic structure of mammalian respiratory complex I. Mitochondrial complex I (also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) is one of the central enzymes in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. It couples electron transfer between NADH and ubiquinone to proton translocation across the inner mitochondrial membrane, contributing to cellular energy production. Complex I is the largest and most elaborate protein assembly of the respiratory chain with a total mass of 970 kilodaltons. It consists of 14 conserved ‘core subunits’ and 31 mitochondria-specific ‘supernumerary subunits’. Together they form a giant, Lshaped molecule, with one arm buried in the mitochondrial membrane and another protruding into the mitochondrial matrix. Here, a novel method for the purification of ovine (Ovis aries) complex I was developed and suitable conditions for cryo-EM imaging established, after extensive screening of detergents and additives. Cryo-EM images were acquired with the recently developed direct electron detector and processed using the latest software. This allowed the solution of the nearly complete atomic model of mitochondrial complex I at 3. 9 Å resolution. The membrane part of the complex contains 78 transmembrane helices, mostly contributed by conserved antiporter-like subunits responsible for proton translocation. These helices are stabilized by tightly bound lipids (including cardiolipins). The hydrophilic arm harbours flavin mononucleotide and 8 iron–sulfur clusters involved in electron transfer. Supernumerary subunits build a scaffold around the conserved core, strongly stabilizing the complex. Additionally, subunits containing cofactors (NADPH, zinc ion and phosphopantetheine) may play a regulatory role. Two distinct conformations of the complex are observed, which may describe the active and <b>deactive</b> states or reflect conformations occurring during the catalytic cycle of the enzyme. Currently this is the most detailed model of this molecular machine, providing insight into the mechanism, assembly and dysfunction of mitochondrial complex I. It also allows molecular analysis of numerous disease-causing mutations, and so the structure may serve as a stepping-stone for future medical developments...|$|E
40|$|With the {{increasing}} complexity of large scale Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) designs, simulation cannot {{cover all the}} corner cases in a reasonable time frame. Formal verification is emerging as a supplementary approach to main-stream simulation. Among various formal verification approaches, model checking is a fully automatic approach to verify a finite state machine against its temporal specifications. It has been successfully used in several industrial verification projects. However, its application {{is limited by the}} size of the system to be verified due to state space explosion. There are two main methods to tackle this problem: compositional verification and model reduction. Compositional verification is to verify each partition in the system separately and then derive the system specification from the partial proofs. Model reduction is to reduce the size of the system such that it can be handled by a model checking tool. In this thesis, we integrate these two approaches to perform model checking. In a compositional verification, properties are only true under certain environments. One of the problems in the compositional reasoning approach is to generate the environment assumption, i. e., stimulus for the module (partition) under verification. In our approach, we provide the environment assumptions as temporal logic formulas and then synthesize an executable hardware description language module from it. Compared with existing related work, the proposed environment has a smaller state space, which is a key factor in compositional verification. The synthesized modules are composed with the design block under verification and then fed into a model checking tool. However, in case the size of the composed module is still beyond the capability of model checking, we use a novel syntactic model reduction algorithm, which analyzes the source code and removes the redundant variables and values. The reduction we propose in this thesis is based on the static analysis of control flow diagram of the program. The values of state variables in the program are partitioned into active values, and <b>deactive</b> values according to their dependency to the properties. and thus the value domains of the variables are much smaller than the original ones. Compared with existing related work, the proposed approach is automatic and has better performance in the reduction of datapath intensive designs. In order to demonstrate the application of the proposed techniques, we verified an industrial size ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) switch fabric from Nortel Networks which complexity is beyond the capability of plain model checking tools...|$|E

Check if mobile phase is enough. - Check if the washing solvent bottle in 507 E autosampler is enough. It is recommended to use degassed methanol as washing solvent (Ref 3 : pp 2 - 9). - Wash the autosampler syringe to get rid of air bubbles. Click the button of “ 507 E wash” 2 - 3 times. - Check if the autosampler tubing is leaking. - Change to the method for use. Click “single run” botton. Check if the mobile phase line is in the right solvent bottle. - Prime the pumps (First prime lines, then prime pumps). - Check if batch file options are right.

Total PL assay 1. Check the automatic pipette before sample pipetting. Add 100 µL lymph/bile/serum with automatic pipette into a 16 × 100 mm PTFE capped test tube, wash the pipette tip with 100 µL D. I. water, and add 4 mL of CM mixture with 5 mL dispenser. - Vortex the tube vigorously. Wait at least 1 h for proteins in the sample to denature. There will be white stuff emerging gradually. - Add 800 µL D. I. water into the tube. Shake the tube upside down 3 times. Wait until there are two clear layers. Siphon off the upper layer with the negative water pressure instrument. - Evaporate the tube under a gentle stream of N 2 at 40 C. - Add 400 µL chloroform to the tube. Cap tightly. Vortex the tube with Vortex-Genie gently 3 times at # 3. - Add 100 µL chromagenic solution and shake the tube 3 times with fingers. - Cap the tube tightly. Otherwise the chloroform will evaporate and the absorbance will be very high. Boil the tube in the boiling water bath for 1 min 10 sec. Wait 5 min for the tube to cool down to room temperature. - Add 4 mL of chloroform gently into the tube and shake the tube 3 times with fingers. (Crucial point!!!) - Allow the tube to stand for 30 min at room temperature. - Take the lower solution quickly with a pasteur pipette. - Determine the absorbance at 710 nm. Use chloroform as the blank. II. PL subclasses assay 1. Prepare a set of 16 × 100 mm tubes. - Use 100 µL autopipette to add 100 µL of lymph/bile/serum. Wash the pipette tip with 100 µL of fresh D. I. water. - Add 5 mL of CM (2 : 1) mixture to the tube. Vortex vigorously. - Use multiple automatic pipette to add 25 µL of concentrated HCl to lower PH. Lower PH to separate phospholipids from proteins and <b>deactive</b> proteins. Optimum amount of concentrated HCl needs to be determined in the future studies. - After overnight deproteinization, cotton-like residue will appear. - Add 1 mL of fresh D. I. water (20 %). Shake gently upside down. Don’t vortex vigorously to break the protein residue to make sure easy separation of the residue. - Wait until two clear layers appear. - Siphon off the upper water layer. - Wait 30 min to let the leftover clear, then some white residue will appear on the surface, siphon off the residue again. - Evaporate the lower CM mixture layer. Check the temperature of the evaporator before using. - After drying, add 500 µL of inject solvent to dissolve the lipids. Methanol causes a negative peak close to PE peak. Acetonitrile causes a negative peak close to chloroform peak. - Too much chloroform is detrimental to the column and cause big solvent peaks. Small amount of chloroform is needed to dissolve the PI and PS. - To the best knowledge of this lab, acetonitrile (10) :chloroform (1) (v/v) is considered the most suitable inject solvent. - Pour the final mixture into the autosampler vials for HPLC running.
