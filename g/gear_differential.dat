50|$|Differential {{movement}} is achieved {{through the process}} of the thrust washers rotating with the ball bearings. The retaining screw is designed so the differential can be easily adjusted by tightening or loosening the screw, consequently changing force. This makes the differential more adjustable than <b>geared</b> <b>differentials,</b> but there is a lower limit since the drive is by friction so there is always some limited slip action.|$|R
50|$|Overall {{drivetrain}} reduction {{comes down}} to three basic factors: transmission <b>gearing</b> (including overdrive), <b>differential</b> <b>gearing</b> (in the axle), and tire size. The rotation speed problem comes into effect when the <b>differential</b> <b>gearing</b> is a high ratio and an overdrive is used to compensate. This may create unpleasant vibrations at high speeds and possible destruction of the driveshaft due to the centripetal forces or uneven balance.|$|R
50|$|To {{this date}} ball {{differentials}} remain {{very popular in}} the radio-controlled car market. They are used on almost every 1/12 on-road, scale touring car(although the sealed <b>gear</b> <b>differential</b> is gaining popularity in this class) and electric off-road produced by many manufacturers. In these classes they are regarded as the industry standard. Schumacher Racing Products even use ball differentials on their nitro truck range, these however use strong materials and larger and harder ball bearings.|$|E
50|$|If one axle loses grip, {{different}} rotational speeds arise {{inside the}} differential which {{result in an}} increase in axial forces that force the clutch plates to close. Once closed, the output shaft is locked resulting in the diversion {{of the majority of the}} torque to the axle achieving better traction. In the Crown <b>Gear</b> <b>differential</b> up to 85% of torque can flow to the rear, and up to 70% of torque can be diverted to the front axle.|$|E
50|$|A {{more recent}} {{exception}} to this is the Torsen differential, which uses worms and planetary worm gears {{in place of the}} bevel gearing of conventional open differentials. Torsen differentials are most prominently featured in the HMMWV and some commercial Hummer vehicles, and as a centre differential in some all wheel drive systems, such as Audi's quattro. Very heavy trucks, such as those used to carry aggregates, often use a worm <b>gear</b> <b>differential</b> for strength. The worm drive is not as efficient as a hypoid gear, and such trucks invariably have a very large differential housing, with a correspondingly large volume of gear oil, to absorb and dissipate the heat created.|$|E
40|$|<b>Differential</b> <b>gears</b> play an importat part in many {{fields and}} are widely used. Therefore, {{it is very}} {{important}} to know the dynamic behavior of <b>differential</b> <b>gears,</b> In the present paper, the dynamic behavior of <b>differential</b> <b>gears</b> were investigated by measuring the torque variations of one drive and two driven shafts under conditions where one driven shaft was rotated at a fixed speed, and the other at a variable speed by varying the speed of the drive shaft. Furtheremore, under conditions where hypoid gear was assembled with complete tooth bearing, heel tooth bearing, or hard heel tooth bearing, the dynamic behavior of <b>differential</b> <b>gears</b> was investigated by measuring the tooth root stresses of hypoid gear was and the torque variations of each shaft. In comparison with these measured data, the effect of tooth bearing on the dynamic behavior of <b>differential</b> <b>gears</b> became clear...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to standard gears, some kits include a rack, a clutch and even worm <b>gears</b> and <b>differential</b> <b>gears.</b> The original <b>differential</b> had a 28 tooth bevel gear, {{designed to be}} meshed with the 14 tooth bevel gears (replaced by the 12 tooth gears) to give 2:1 reduction. They can also be meshed with the newer double bevel gears. It {{was replaced by a}} newer design incorporating 16 tooth and 24 tooth gears {{on opposite sides of the}} casing. The casing holds three 12 tooth bevel gears inside.|$|R
40|$|Linear back-drive {{differentials}} {{have been}} proposed as alternatives to conventional <b>gear</b> <b>differentials</b> for applications {{in which there is}} only limited rotational motion (e. g., oscillation). The finite nature of the rotation makes it possible to optimize a linear back-drive differential in ways that would not be possible for <b>gear</b> <b>differentials</b> or other differentials that are required to be capable of unlimited rotation. As a result, relative to <b>gear</b> <b>differentials,</b> linear back-drive differentials could be more compact and less massive, could contain fewer complex parts, and could be less sensitive to variations in the viscosities of lubricants. Linear back-drive differentials would operate according to established principles of power ball screws and linear-motion drives, but would utilize these principles in an innovative way. One major characteristic of such mechanisms that would be exploited in linear back-drive differentials is the possibility of designing them to drive or back-drive with similar efficiency and energy input: in other words, such a mechanism can be designed so that a rotating screw can drive a nut linearly or the linear motion of the nut can cause the screw to rotate. A linear back-drive differential (see figure) would include two collinear shafts connected to two parts that are intended to engage in limited opposing rotations. The linear back-drive differential would also include a nut that would be free to translate along its axis but not to rotate. The inner surface of the nut would be right-hand threaded at one end and left-hand threaded at the opposite end to engage corresponding right- and left-handed threads on the shafts. A rotation and torque introduced into the system via one shaft would drive the nut in linear motion. The nut, in turn, would back-drive the other shaft, creating a reaction torque. Balls would reduce friction, making it possible for the shaft/nut coupling on each side to operate with 90 percent efficiency...|$|R

Trq d [...] is the difference in torque delivered to the left and right wheel. The magnitude of Trq d [...] comes from the slip-limiting mechanism in the differential and may be a function of input torque (as {{in the case of a}} <b>gear</b> <b>differential),</b> or the difference in the output speeds (as in the case of a viscous differential).|$|E
