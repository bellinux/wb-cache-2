40|$|We {{investigate}} the strategic role of correlation between disclosure error and payoff shock in affecting a firm’s {{cost of capital}} or <b>share</b> <b>price.</b> We show that the correlation affects the relationship between disclosure quality {{and the cost of}} capital or <b>share</b> <b>price.</b> The standard result where disclosure quality unambiguously lowers the firm’s cost of capital or <b>share</b> <b>price</b> can be observed only in the case where the correlation is zero. In the extreme case where the correlation is perfect, disclosure quality does not affect the cost of capital or <b>share</b> <b>price.</b> When compared to other non-perfect correlation cases, the extreme case where the correlation is perfect results in, on average, a <b>higher</b> <b>share</b> <b>price.</b> This implies that the firm can achieve a <b>higher</b> <b>share</b> <b>price</b> by influencing the correlation (i. e., making it nonzero) and suggests a new way as to how the effectiveness of a disclosure should be evaluated...|$|R

40|$|Choice {{conflict}} {{is a critical}} issue in decision making. This study adopted stock transaction as the task to explore the relation between <b>share</b> <b>price</b> level and conflict intensity that the subjects experienced in decision making, {{and the effect of}} price level on individual and group choice conflict resolution. The strategy people used to solve choice conflict and gender difference were also examined. Modes of interaction (face to face and through audio media) in group decision making were also studied. The main results are as follows: 1. In individual decision-marking, there is a significant gender effect on decision time. Female subjects will spent more time on the task than male subjects. 2. When making a choice decision, the individual experienced stronger conflict for <b>price</b> <b>shares</b> than for low <b>price</b> <b>shares.</b> The stronger the conflict level they feel, the more difficult to make the choice decision. 3. Four strategies were used to finish the task. Male subjects used simple strategies while female subjects used more complex strategies. 4. In group decision-making, <b>share</b> <b>price</b> level had a significant effect on selection time. People used longer selection time for low <b>price</b> <b>shares</b> than for <b>high</b> <b>price</b> <b>shares.</b> No significant interaction was found between <b>share</b> <b>price</b> level and Modes of interaction. 5. Modes of interaction had significant effect on satisfaction coherence of the group. Under face-to-face condition, people within one group had greater satisfaction coherence. 6. Media had no significant effect on people&# 39;s perception during the experiment. Satisfaction for cooperation, successful communication and good cooperation were correlated. Self satisfaction and satisfaction of the partners others were also correlated with the satisfaction of the whole task. 本研究以选股决策作为具体的实验任务，通过三个实验考察备择方案的效价水平与被试体验到的冲突强度之间的关系，及它对股票新手个体和二人群体解决选择冲突的影响，揭示决策冲突问题解决的策略，探讨解决股票选择冲突过程中的性别差异并研究媒体条件（面对面或音频连接）对决策冲突问题解决的影响。主要结果如下： 1. 在个体决策中，男女被试在股票的选择时间上有显著差异，女生的选择时间长于男生的选择时间。 2. 在个体决策中，被试选择高效价股票时感受到的冲突强度显著高于选择低效价股票时感受到的冲突强度。被试在选择中感受到的冲突强度越大，则感受到的做出选择的难度也越大；每对中甲乙两支股票对被试吸引度的差值越大，被试感到的选择难易度越低；被试在选择中感受到的冲突强度越低，被试对自己做出选择的满意度越高。 3. 出声思维的研究结果表明，在选股决策中四名被试共使用了“部分效价”、“倾向—验证”、“逐项比较”和“直觉选择”四种策略。相对来说，男生使用的策略较简单，女性则考虑的较为全面。 4. 在二人群体决策中，高低效价水平对选择时间有显著影响，被试对低效价水平股票的选择时间要显著长于对高效价水平股票的选择时间；媒体条件对选择时间没有显著影响；效价水平和媒体条件对股票的选择时间没有显著的交互作用。 5. 媒体条件对群体内选择结果的满意度的一致性有显著影响，在面对面条件下，同为一组的两名被试对他们做出的选择结果的满意度的一致性比在音频条件下高。 6. 媒体条件对被试在实验中的心理感受没有显著影响；被试在“合作满意度”、“交流顺利度”及“合作愉快度”三者的感受上具有较高的一致性。如果对对方的满意度和对自己的满意度都高的话，被试对整个实验任务合作的满意度也会高...|$|R

40|$|We report strong OLS and {{instrumental}} variable evidence that an overall corporate governance index {{is an important}} and likely causal factor in explaining {{the market value of}} Korean public companies. We construct a corporate governance index (KCGI, 0 ∼ 100) for 515 Korean companies based on a 2001 Korea Stock Exchange survey. In OLS, a worst-to-best change in KCGI predicts a 0. 47 increase in Tobin's q (about a 160 % increase in <b>share</b> <b>price).</b> This effect is statistically strong (t = 6. 12) and robust to choice of market value variable (Tobin's q, market/book, and market/sales), specification of the governance index, and inclusion of extensive control variables. We rely on unique features of Korean legal rules to construct an instrument for KCGI. Good instruments are not available in other comparable studies. Two-stage and three-stage least squares coefficients are larger than OLS coefficients and are highly significant. Thus, this article offers evidence consistent with a causal relationship between an overall governance index and <b>higher</b> <b>share</b> <b>prices</b> in emerging markets. We also find that Korean firms with 50 % outside directors have 0. 13 higher Tobin's q (roughly 40 % <b>higher</b> <b>share</b> <b>price),</b> after controlling for the rest of KCGI. This effect, too, is likely causal. Thus, we report the first evidence consistent with greater board independence causally predicting <b>higher</b> <b>share</b> <b>prices</b> in emerging markets.

We consider a model where the demand function for domestic shares differs between domestic and foreign investors because of dead-weight costs in holding domestic and foreign securities that depend on the country of residence of investors. We show that domestic entrepreneurs maximize firm value by discriminating between domestic and foreign investors. The model implies that countries benefiting from capital flight have binding ownership restrictions such that foreign investors pay a <b>higher</b> <b>price</b> for <b>shares</b> than domestic investors.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{different}} levels of corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosures of the largest European firms. We find that firms are more predisposed to disclose more CSR information in countries with: better investor protection, higher levels of democracy, more effective government services, higher quality regulations, more press freedom, and a lower commitment to environmental policies. Our analysis {{of the association of}} {{different levels of}} CSR disclosure with <b>share</b> <b>prices</b> indicates that a high level of CSR disclosure is associated with <b>higher</b> <b>share</b> <b>prices,</b> whereas a low level of CSR disclosure in sensitive industries is associated with lower <b>share</b> <b>prices</b> (compared to no disclosure). These results are also present when we analyse changes in CSR disclosure, and are robust to the inclusion of an accounting quality measure in our model. The overall effect of the association of higher levels of CSR disclosure with <b>higher</b> <b>share</b> <b>prices</b> is stronger in countries with more democracy, more government effectiveness, better regulatory quality, and more press freedom. Therefore, market participants find CSR disclosures more informative in countries where investors are {{in a better position to}} voice their concerns and where there is better regulation and more effective government implementation of regulations.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the value relevance of segment information for both public and private sector banks in India. In doing so, this paper examines a rapidly developing economy and perhaps its most critical sector during this period of strong economic growth. Design/methodology/approach: In this study uses the simplified Ohlson model, for a sample of 136 private sector and public sector banks for the period 2007 - 2010 in India. Findings: The paper finds that public sector banks have <b>higher</b> <b>share</b> <b>prices,</b> <b>higher</b> earnings and more equity compared with private sector banks. Segment earnings data is highly value relevant for both sectors; however, segment equity data is only marginally value relevant for Indian banks. The number of segments is also value relevant and associated with <b>higher</b> <b>share</b> <b>prices.</b> Originality/value: The results of this study contribute additional evidence to the literature on segment reporting by studying the effect of adoption of segment reporting in an emerging market. Findings from the paper are particularly relevant as India is currently in the process of changing its segment reporting requirements and moving to an IFRS-based segment standard...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the project}} was to design a {{multiple}} linear regression model and use it to predict the <b>share’s</b> closing <b>price</b> for 44 companies listed on the OMX Stockholm stock exchange’s Large Cap list. The model is intended {{to be used as a}} day trading guideline i. e. today’s information is used to predict tomorrow’s closing price. The regression was done in Microsoft Excel 2010 [18] by using its built-in function LINEST. The LINEST-function uses the dependent variable y and all the covariates x to calculate the β-value belonging to each covariate. Several multiple linear regression models were created and their functionality was tested, but only seven models were better than chance i. e. more than 50 % in the right direction. To determine the most suitable model out of the remaining seven, Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC), was applied. The covariates used in the final model were; Dow Jones closing price, Shanghai opening price, conjuncture, oil <b>price,</b> <b>share’s</b> opening <b>price,</b> <b>share’s</b> <b>highest</b> <b>price,</b> <b>share’s</b> lowest <b>price,</b> lending rate, reports, positive/negative insider trading, payday, positive/negative price target, number of completed transactions during one day, OMX Stockholm closing price, TCW index, increasing closing price three days in a row and decreasing closing price three days in a row. The maximum average deviation between the predicted closing price and the real closing price of all the 44 shares predicted were 6, 60 %. In predicting the correct direction (increase or decrease) of the 44 shares an average of 61, 72 % were achieved during the time period 2012 - 02 - 22 to 2013 - 02 - 20. If investing 50. 000 SEK in each company i. e. a total investment of 2. 2 million SEK, the total yield when using the regression model during the year 2012 - 02 - 22 to 2013 - 02 - 20 would have been 259. 639 SEK (11, 80 %) compared to 184. 171 SEK (8, 37 %) if the shares were never to be traded with during the same period of time. Of the 44 companies analysed, 31 (70, 45 %) of them were profitable when using the regression model during the year compared to 30 (68, 18 %) if the shares were never to be sold during the same period of time.

5000|$|A similar {{chartered}} company, the South Sea Company, {{was established}} in 1711 to trade in the Spanish South American colonies, but met with less success. The South Sea Company's monopoly rights were supposedly backed by the Treaty of Utrecht, signed in 1713 as a settlement following the War of the Spanish Succession, which gave Great Britain an asiento to trade in the region for thirty years. In fact the Spanish remained hostile and let only one ship a year enter. Unaware of the problems, investors in Britain, enticed by extravagant promises of profit from company promoters bought thousands of shares. By 1717, the South Sea Company was so wealthy (still having done no real business) that it assumed the public debt of the British government. This accelerated the inflation of the <b>share</b> <b>price</b> further, as did the Bubble Act 1720, which (possibly with the motive of protecting the South Sea Company from competition) prohibited the establishment of any companies without a Royal Charter. The <b>share</b> <b>price</b> rose so rapidly that people began buying shares merely in order to sell them at a <b>higher</b> <b>price,</b> which in turn led to <b>higher</b> <b>share</b> <b>prices.</b> This was the first speculative bubble the country had seen, {{but by the end}} of 1720, the bubble had [...] "burst", and the <b>share</b> <b>price</b> sank from £1000 to under £100.
