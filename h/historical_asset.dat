Besides geometrical preservation, preserving the current appearance of <b>historical</b> <b>assets</b> is an important and urgent component of our project, due to the daily decay and stain of these ancestral statues and buildings. For this purpose, we have been developing frameworks and algorithms to capture the appearance of real world objects accurately and efficiently. In this paper, we will overview several of these algorithms, namely, appearance modeling from a densely/sparsely sampled image sequence, and image-based shape modeling of transparent objects. These methods can synthesize appearance under novel viewing and lighting conditions, which becomes important when building multimedia contents of <b>historical</b> <b>assets,</b> as well as precisely preserving the appearance itself...|$|R
40|$|This article {{explains}} {{the rationale for}} the digitization of social work heritage material and the virtualization of an archived nondigital museum exhibit constructed by a Scottish Museum of Social Work. The project involved the "virtualization" of an existing social work museum exhibition on the migration of 'Home Children' from Scotland to Canada in the late 19 th and early 20 th century and the digital preservation of <b>historical</b> <b>assets</b> (both text and images) held by the contemporary social care organization involved in the migration of the children.

40|$|International audienceThe {{assessment}} of historical {{elements at risk}} from earthquake loading presents a number of differences from the seismic evaluation of modern structures, for design or retrofitting purposes, which is covered by existing building codes, and {{for the development of}} fragility curves, procedures for which have been extensively developed in the past decade. This article briefly discusses: the hazard framework for <b>historical</b> <b>assets,</b> including a consideration of the appropriate return period to be used for such elements at risk; the intensity measures {{that could be used to}} describe earthquake shaking for the analysis of historical assets; and available approaches for their assessment. We then discuss various unique aspects of <b>historical</b> <b>assets</b> that mean the characterisation of earthquake loading must be different from that for modern structures. For example, historical buildings are often composed of heterogeneous materials (e. g. old masonry) and they are sometimes located where strong local site effects occur due to: steep topography (e. g. hilltops), basin effects or foundations built on the remains of previous structures. Standard seismic hazard assessment undertaken for modern structures and the majority of sites is generally not appropriate. Within the PERPETUATE project performance-based assessments, using nonlinear static and dynamic analyses for the evaluation of structural response of <b>historical</b> <b>assets,</b> were undertaken. The steps outlined in this article are important for input to these assessments...|$|R

50|$|Derinçay (formerly Hocantı) is {{a village}} in Mut {{district}} of Mersin Province, Turkey. It is situated in the valley of Göksu River {{to the north of}} Mut. The distance to Mut is 15 km and to Mersin is 180 km. The population of the village was 201 as of 2012. The village is an old village founded by Turkmens. The oldest Ottoman documents about the village are of 15th century. Its former name Hocantı may either refer to a certain Hoca Enti, who lived in the Karamanoğlu era, or a settlement in Turkestan.

40|$|In this article, I analyse investors' welfare {{losses from}} being {{restricted}} from short-selling. To measure those losses, I use {{the concept of}} the proportionate opportunity cost along with various Constant Relative Risk Aversion (CRRA) utility functions. Two sets of asset returns are used with a Vector Autoregressive process for generating joint returns distributions: the original <b>historical</b> <b>asset</b> returns data set and the <b>historical</b> <b>asset</b> returns with extreme values exaggerated. In each case, 1000 alternative sets of assets, including one with a risk-free nominal return, are randomly made available for investment. I show that the optimal portfolio strategy with the short-selling constraint performs almost as well as the unconstrained portfolio strategy for investors with medium and high levels of risk aversion. The results, derived from the original <b>historical</b> <b>asset</b> returns data set, show that investors' welfare losses reach 12. 8 % of initial wealth when risk aversion is low and reach 13. 5 % of initial wealth with extreme returns exaggerated. The results in both cases indicate that less risk-averse investors experience greater welfare losses and that the short-selling constraint reduces the cost of sub-optimal diversification. ...|$|E
40|$|Research enquiry {{into the}} history of social work and social welfare is a vital and ongoing {{scholarly}} activity, underpinning our understanding of the past, and illuminating present day practice and policy. ‘Memory institutions’ like libraries and museums have a key role to play in preserving, and providing researchers with access to, original cultural heritage materials. Through their exhibition work curators of specialist collections also have a role in interpreting and narrating the stories of social welfare, giving voice to the recipients of social work services: the poor, the underprivileged, the dispossessed, the immigrant, and the ‘other’. In the 21 st century digital technology is transforming the work of cultural heritage institutions. This article explores a project involving the ‘virtualization’ of a social work museum exhibition on the migration of “Home Children” from Scotland to Canada in the late 19 th and early 20 th centuries; and the digital preservation of <b>historical</b> <b>assets</b> held in the archive of one of the social care organizations involved in the migration of the children. The purpose of the project was threefold: to provide public access to the <b>historical</b> <b>assets</b> for research and education; to preserve the <b>historical</b> <b>assets</b> before they were damaged any further by prolonged and sub-optimal storage conditions; and to repurpose the exhibition material to retell the story of Victorian child migration with new digital media...|$|R

40|$|Although <b>historical</b> <b>asset</b> price ‘bubbles’ {{are often}} {{attributed}} to irrationality, the empirical analysis of such episodes has been limited. The results {{presented in this}} paper suggest that during an historical price reversal, investors successfully incorporated forecasts of short-term dividend changes into their valuations, but were unable to predict longer-term changes. When short-term growth is controlled for, it appears that the railways were priced consistently with the non-railways for almost the entire episode. These findings may imply that investors had imperfect foresight, but that they acted consistently. ...|$|E

We study {{the implications of these}} results for the effect of financial institutions’ returns disclosure policy on risk-taking. We find that aggregated returns disclosure treatments do not increase portfolio allocations to equity in an experiment where—in contrast to previous experiments—subjects invest in real mutual funds over the course of one year. ...|$|E

During the "British Bicycle Mania" of 1896 - 1898, cycle share prices rose by 200 per cent before falling 76 per cent from their peak value. This paper argues that arbitrage during this episode was {{limited by the}} risk of being cornered after short selling shares. Three corners in cycle company shares occurred during the "mania", two of which resulted in substantial losses for short-sellers. The first corner corresponded with a structural break in cycle share prices, and crosssectional analysis reveals that companies for which cornering risk was greater experienced more pronounced mispricing...|$|E

40|$|Lessons {{learned from}} natural events which caused severe damage to {{existing}} constructions have repeatedly shown the high vulnerability of historically important masonry, often worsened by inaccurate or dubious applications of modern or innovative interventions. Especially {{in the field}} of new technologies and materials applied to <b>historical</b> <b>assets,</b> experimental validation integrated at multi-disciplinary level is essential, to implement correct choices able to balance the respect of tradition and the requirements of innovation. The common objective is the transmission of educational values through the conservation of the historical identity of constructions which have survived over time and are still functional today. Planning agreements among academic and industrial research, management and governing bodies constitute preconditions for selecting consistent strategies {{for the protection of the}} built environment.

40|$|Historical ‘bubbles’ {{are often}} {{attributed}} to mispricing, but the empirical analysis of such episodes has been limited. This paper examines a notable but academically neglected period, {{known as the}} British Railway Mania, using a new dataset and a cross-sectional methodology which is unique {{to the study of}} <b>historical</b> <b>asset</b> price reversals. The main finding is that the cross-sectional variation in stock prices, in every week of the sample, is explained by the cross-sectional variation in dividends, growth and risk, with {{no significant differences between the}} railways and non-railways.
