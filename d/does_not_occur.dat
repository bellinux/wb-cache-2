5|$|In the far {{future of}} the universe, {{assuming}} that proton decay <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>occur,</b> cold fusion occurring via quantum tunnelling would cause the light nuclei in ordinary matter to fuse into 56Fe nuclei. Fission and alpha-particle emission would then make heavy nuclei decay into iron, converting all stellar-mass objects to cold spheres of pure iron.|$|E
5|$|The acetyl group, {{formally}} {{derived from}} acetic acid, {{is fundamental to}} all forms of life. When bound to coenzyme A, it {{is central to the}} metabolism of carbohydrates and fats.

Mating lasts between 30min and 21hours, with spawning usually taking place in August. Females carry the eggs on their pleopods (appendages on the abdomen) until they hatch directly into juvenile crabs, having passed through the larval stages inside the egg.|$|E
5|$|Those with {{relatively}} mild visual field loss or double vision only may be managed conservatively, with close {{observation of the}} level of consciousness, visual fields, and results of routine blood tests.

If the apoplexy occurred in a prolactin-secreting tumor, this may respond to dopamine agonist treatment.|$|E

The exclusionary rule would not bar voluntary answers to such questions from being offered into evidence in a subsequent criminal prosecution. The person is not being seized if his freedom of movement is not restrained. The government may not detain an individual even momentarily without reasonable, objective grounds, with few exceptions. His refusal to listen or answer does not by itself furnish such grounds.|$|E

Aircraft pilots may also require assessment for surgery.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{is subject}} to {{predation}} and parasitism, the main threat to this species is changes in agricultural practices, which have led to population decline, some local extirpation, and range fragmentation in Europe; however, it is not threatened globally. The red-billed chough, which derived its common name from the jackdaw, was formerly associated with fire-raising, and has links with Saint Thomas Becket and Cornwall. The red-billed chough has been depicted on postage stamps of a few countries, including the Isle of Man, with four different stamps, and The Gambia, where the bird <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>occur.</b>|$|E
5|$|Archaea {{reproduce}} asexually by binary {{or multiple}} fission, fragmentation, or budding; meiosis <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>occur,</b> so if {{a species of}} archaea exists {{in more than one}} form, all have the same genetic material. Cell division is controlled in a cell cycle; after the cell's chromosome is replicated and the two daughter chromosomes separate, the cell divides. In the genus Sulfolobus, the cycle has characteristics that are similar to both bacterial and eukaryotic systems. The chromosomes replicate from multiple starting-points (origins of replication) using DNA polymerases that resemble the equivalent eukaryotic enzymes.|$|E

5|$|As {{the desert}} {{mountains}} decay, {{large areas of}} shattered rock and rubble occur. The process continues and the end products are either dust or sand. Dust is formed from solidified clay or volcanic deposits whereas sand results from the fragmentation of harder granites, limestone and sandstone. There is a certain critical size (about 0.5mm) below which further temperature-induced weathering of rocks <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>occur</b> and this provides a minimum size for sand grains.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{chemical}} similarity, lithium typically <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>occur</b> {{together with}} sodium or potassium {{due to its}} smaller size. Due to its relatively low reactivity, {{it can be found}} in seawater in large amounts; it is estimated that seawater is approximately 0.14 to 0.25 parts per million (ppm) or 25 micromolar. Its diagonal relationship with magnesium often allows it to replace magnesium in ferromagnesium minerals, where its crustal concentration is about 18ppm, comparable to that of gallium and niobium. Commercially, the most important lithium mineral is spodumene, which occurs in large deposits worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Elemental bromine is very {{reactive}} {{and thus}} <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>occur</b> free in nature, but in colourless soluble crystalline mineral halide salts, analogous to table salt. While {{it is rather}} rare in the Earth's crust, the high solubility of the bromide ion (Br−) has caused its accumulation in the oceans. Commercially the element is easily extracted from brine pools, mostly in the United States, Israel and China. The mass of bromine in the oceans is about one three-hundredth of that of chlorine.|$|E

The genitalia is similar, but a more detailed study can distinguish these features among the two ants.|$|E
