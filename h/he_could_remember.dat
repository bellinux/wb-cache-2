5|$|Coker {{grew up in}} Linden, New Jersey {{and became}} an Eagle Scout in Troop 32 of Saint Elizabeth's Catholic Church in Linden on January 27, 1959. He has stated that his passion for Scouting {{is one of the}} things that got him through his 6.5years as a POW in North Vietnam, to the point that at times all <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>remember</b> was the Scout Oath, but not the names of his family members.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} later, {{in the wake}} of the scandal, Waugh was widely jeered by an Australian crowd when he walked out to bat on the first day of the Test. In what he {{described}} as the toughest day of his career, Waugh gave an unconvincing and hesitant performance. Waugh managed only seven runs in 36 minutes before being removed by Peter Such, caught and bowled. The cricket writer Peter Roebuck opined that it was the worst home crowd reception for an Australian player that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>remember.</b> Warne was injured at the time and did not play, so he did not have to face the hostile crowd.|$|E
5|$|With only 30 minutes {{remaining}} {{before the}} ship is destroyed, Kirk considers transporting the entire crew to Caliban so they can survive. Scotty discovers Sulu's original transporter pattern, from when the warbird was destroyed. He theorizes that he could re-integrate it into the older version, resetting his memories so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>remember</b> the Romulan information and allowing him to pilot the Enterprise to safety but causing him to forget his 30 years on Caliban. Alana reassures him that she'll remind him of the man he became, but McCoy and Spock agree that leaving the rift will cause the death of Alana. Sulu draws his sword and is prepared to fight to save his daughter, but she talks him down. He strides onto the transporter pad and demands they reintegrate his pattern. As he is merged once again, Alana quotes The Tempest. The younger version of Sulu is taken to the bridge and pilots the Enterprise from the anomaly with seconds to spare, with Alana ceasing to exist as he does so. Back on the Excelsior, Captain Sulu meets with the shuttle passengers in his ready room; his daughter Demora (Mimi Chong) and is introduced to his baby granddaughter, Alana.|$|E

50|$|A hard test crash, April of 1970, {{at the old}} Texas World Speedway Texas {{left him}} disoriented. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> not <b>remember</b> fellow driver Cale Yarborough picking him up in Texas {{a few days later}} and flying him home. <b>He</b> also <b>could</b> not <b>remember</b> flying on to Martinsville, or running in the race at Martinsville.|$|R

One of his past lives, as reported by Aulus Gellius, was as a beautiful courtesan. According to Xenophanes, Pythagoras heard the cry of his dead friend in the bark of a dog.|$|E
25|$|On March 2, 2012, Odom was {{assigned}} to the Texas Legends of the NBA D-League. He had missed the prior three games due to personal reasons. His stint with the Legends was canceled on March 3, 2012 and he returned to the Mavs' active roster. On March 24, Odom did not play in a 104–87 loss to the San Antonio Spurs, the first time <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>remember</b> not playing due to a coach's decision.|$|E
25|$|The 1938 Democratic Senate primary {{featured}} {{an intense}} showdown between Barkley, liberal {{spokesman for the}} New Deal, and conservative governor Happy Chandler. The governor was a gifted public speaker, combining voice control, emotionalism, and singing with an unusual ability to personalize his speeches. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>remember</b> everyone's name, and in turn they became emotionally involved in his campaign speeches. Barkley's methodical campaigning was bolstered by President Franklin D. Roosevelt's strong endorsement. Barkley handily defeated Chandler, with 56% of the vote. Farmers, labor unions, and city machines gave Barkley his margin, a vote which reaffirmed {{the popularity of the}} New Deal in Kentucky. Only a few months later, Chandler was appointed to the state's other Senate seat upon the death of Senator Mills Logan.|$|E

25|$|The {{most famous}} case {{reported}} {{is that of}} patient Henry Molaison, known as H.M., in March 1953. Molaison's chief complaint was the persistence of severe seizures and therefore had a bilateral lobectomy (both of his MTLs were removed). As a result, Molaison had bilateral damage to both the hippocampal formation and the perirhinal cortex. Molaison had average intelligence and perceptual ability and a decent vocabulary. However, he could not learn new words or remember things that had happened {{more than a few}} minutes earlier. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>remember</b> anything from his childhood. If the memory was created from before his lobectomy, he still had the ability to retrieve it and remember. However, he was able to learn some new skills. He was the first well-documented case of severe anterograde amnesia, and was studied until his death in 2008.|$|E
25|$|As a major, {{he landed}} in France on Gold Beach on D-Day on 6 June 1944, as Deputy Assistant Quartermaster-General (DAQMG) of the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division, a first line TA formation, {{under the command}} of Major-General Douglas Graham. Macleod {{embarked}} on 1 June, ready for the invasion which was then postponed from 5 June to 6 June. The 50th Division, a highly experienced veteran formation which had fought in North Africa and Sicily, was tasked with capturing Arromanches, where the Mulberry artificial harbour was to be set up, {{and by the end of}} the day patrols had pushed to the outskirts of Bayeux. Macleod spent much of the day touring the beachhead area to check on progress, driving past enemy-held strongpoints, with Lieutenant Colonel “Bertie” Gibb. He later recorded that he had “a patchwork of memories” of D-Day. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>remember</b> what he ate but not when he ate it, or that when he went to load his revolver he found his batman had instead filled his ammunition pouch with boiled sweets. British planners had expected 40% casualties on D-Day, and Macleod later recorded that he himself had fully expected to be killed, but on realising at midnight that he had survived D-Day decided that he would survive the war and see the birth of his second child in October.|$|E
500|$|Buckles saw the war's {{impact on}} {{malnourished}} children in France, {{and more than}} 80 years later <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>remember</b> helping to feed them. After the Armistice in 1918, Buckles escorted prisoners of war back to Germany. One German prisoner gave him a belt buckle inscribed [...] "Gott mit uns" [...] (...) , which he kept {{for the rest of}} his life. Buckles was promoted to corporal on September 22, 1919. Following an honorable discharge in November 1919, he returned to the United States aboard [...]|$|E

500|$|Two live {{versions}} of the song recorded during Dylan's 1966 tour of England have been released. His performance of the song at London's Royal Albert Hall on May 26, 1966 appeared on Biograph, released in 1985. Asked by Cameron Crowe, for the liner notes for Biograph, how <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>remember</b> the words of such a complex song in live performance, Dylan responded, [...] "I could remember a song without writing it down {{because it was so}} visual." [...] A performance of the song recorded at the Manchester Free Trade Hall on May 17, 1966 was released on [...] in 1998.|$|E
500|$|Since Van Peebles did {{not have}} the money to hire a composer, he {{composed}} the film's music score himself. Because {{he did not know how}} to read or write music, he numbered all of the keys on a piano so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>remember</b> the melodies. Van Peebles stated that [...] "Most filmmakers look at a feature in terms of image and story or vice versa. Effects and music [...] are strictly secondary considerations. Very few look at film with sound considered as a creative third dimension. So I calculate the scenario in such a way that sound can be used as an integral part of the film." ...|$|E
500|$|Arthur Adams {{was born}} on April 5, 1963 in Holyoke, Massachusetts. His father was a {{loadmaster}} in the United States Air Force, and as a result, Adams frequently moved with his parents and four younger brothers to places that included West Virginia. When Adams was five years old, the family settled in Vacaville, California, near Travis Air Force Base. Adams' first exposure to superhero and monster comics came through the ones his mother would buy for him once a month at a thrift store. His enthusiasm for superhero stories by particular creators began when his father returned from an overseas trip with the first Marvel Treasury Grab-Bag, which included stories by Ross Andru, Wally Wood, and Gene Colan. He particularly liked Marvel Comics for their stories with monster-like characters like the Thing, the Hulk, and the Man-Thing. He became interested in dinosaurs and monsters like King Kong after watching Creature Features on TV every Saturday, and Universal Monster movies such as Frankenstein and Creature from the Black Lagoon. He also enjoyed superhero and science fiction programming, such as Super Friends, the 1967 Spider-Man cartoon and Star Trek. Adams enjoyed drawing frequently in his youth, {{as far back as}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>remember.</b> He discovered the work of Frank Frazetta when he was 13 or 14, which was a [...] "huge" [...] early influence on him, and attempted to mimic his style using watercolor. Adams did not consider illustration as a profession, however, as he aspired to be a paleontologist. His interest in professional paleontology waned, however, when he realized that the extreme climates of the environments in which he would be required to work were not appealing to him.|$|E

2500|$|Completed in 1861, the {{university}} {{soon became a}} tourist attraction; Anthony Trollope wrote home in 1874 that the Hall was [...] "the finest chamber in the colonies", and that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>remember</b> no college of Oxford or Cambridge which possessed a hall [...] "of which the proportions are so good".|$|E
2500|$|The intuition {{that there}} was more to the psyche than {{individual}} experience possibly began in Jung's childhood. The very first dream <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>remember</b> was that of an underground phallic god. Later in life his research on psychotic patients in Burgholzli Hospital and his own self-analysis later supported his early intuition about the existence of universal psychic structures that underlie all human experience and behavior. Jung first referred to these as [...] "primordial images" [...] – a term he borrowed from Jacob Burckhardt. Later in 1917 Jung called them [...] "dominants of the collective unconscious." ...|$|E

2500|$|Breuning was {{a lifelong}} cigar smoker, but {{says in an}} {{interview}} at age 110 that he quit in 1999 when he was 103, saying they had become too expensive. However, at the age of 108 he briefly started smoking again, encouraged by gifts of cigars {{from as far away as}} London. Breuning retained a sharp memory. For example, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>remember</b> his grandfather talking about his experiences in the American Civil War when he was three years old, and remembered the day President William McKinley was shot as the day [...] "I got my first haircut".|$|E

2500|$|Lawrence's {{most famous}} {{work in the}} Middle Ages—surviving in at least 17 {{manuscript}} copies—was the Hypognosticon (meaning, according to Lawrence, abbreviation). This he wrote during his years [...] at Bishop Geoffrey's court. It is a nine-book epic of unrhymed couplets, recounting the biblical tale of mankind from the creation to the present. Lawrence had been composing a metrical version of the Bible, though becoming {{a member of the}} episcopal court meant he was only able to compose 40 lines per day. He managed to get the work up to a good size when it disappeared one Christmas, stolen, Lawrence thought, by a maid-servant. The Hypognosticon, an improved version of what <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>remember</b> of this work, was written in the space of one month.|$|E
60|$|Yet, {{though he}} so slept, still Sir Tristram's wits in no wise {{recovered}} themselves; {{for when he}} awoke from that slumber <b>he</b> still <b>could</b> not <b>remember</b> who <b>he</b> was or whence <b>he</b> came, neither <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>remember</b> the faces of any {{of those who were}} around about him.

60|$|When men {{in books}} awake from a vision, they {{commonly}} {{find themselves in}} some place in which they might have fallen asleep; they yawn in a chair, or lift themselves with bruised limbs from a field. Syme's experience was something much more psychologically strange if there was indeed anything unreal, in the earthly sense, about the things he had gone through. For while <b>he</b> <b>could</b> always <b>remember</b> afterwards that he had swooned before the face of Sunday, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>remember</b> having ever come to at all. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> only <b>remember</b> that gradually and naturally {{he knew that he}} was and had been walking along a country lane with an easy and conversational companion. That companion had been a part of his recent drama; it was the red-haired poet Gregory. They were walking like old friends, and were in the middle of a conversation about some triviality. But Syme could only feel an unnatural buoyancy in his body and a crystal simplicity in his mind that seemed to be superior to everything that he said or did. He felt he was in possession of some impossible good news, which made every other thing a triviality, but an adorable triviality.|$|R
