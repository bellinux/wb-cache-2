5000|$|In September 1981, Fiat {{displayed}} the Ritmo Abarth 125 TC at the Frankfurt Motorshow. This model {{was not available}} for right-hand export markets because {{the position of the}} <b>exhaust</b> <b>downpipe</b> did not allow for a relocated steering column and system. The 125 TC was a modified and revised 105 TC with a 1,995 cc DOHC four with , ventilated front discs, a new five-speed ZF manual gearbox, revised suspension settings and strengthened components. Outwardly, the 125 TC differed only slightly from the 105 TC - it gained the chunky four-spoke 14 in alloys later seen on the Bertone Cabrio models, featured an [...] "Abarth" [...] red and black badge on the rear hatch, and the side badges featured the Abarth [...] "Scorpion". The 125 TC version had a top speed of 190 km/h and it could accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h in 8.7 seconds. These cars were the last ones assembled on a separate Abarth production line, following the Fiat buyout in 1971.|$|E
5000|$|The four 34 mm Mikuni constant-velocity {{downdraft}} carburettors {{are mounted}} {{in a bank}} behind and above the cylinders and feed each cylinder through short intake manifolds. Four <b>exhaust</b> <b>downpipes</b> join a box below the engine where the gases are split to exit through two silencers.|$|R
40|$|This work {{describes}} different structural {{designs of}} the exhaust manifold {{and creation of}} parametric models of <b>exhaust</b> <b>downpipes</b> of supercharged engine 1, 4 TSI. Next, the study deals with exhaust manifold’s materials and with present basic principles of thermodynamic and hydrodynamic. Then two parametric models were modelled in Solidworks software. First model was made according to existing exhaust manifold of engine 1, 4 TSI. It was symmetrical model (collector in the axis). For second parametric model the collector was moved in horizontal direction, so this model is asymmetrical. Both models were evaluated considering their complexity of structural design and their manufacturing claims. Finally the possibility of CFD analysis for evaluation of parametric models was studied...|$|R
50|$|The FJ1200 uses a four {{cylinder}} in-line {{layout and}} is air-cooled. Sixteen valves are {{operated by a}} chain-driven double overhead camshaft; valve clearances are adjusted using shims. The four constant-velocity carburettors are mounted in a bank behind the cylinders and feed each cylinder through short intake manifolds. Four <b>exhaust</b> <b>downpipes</b> join a box below the engine where the gases are split to exit through two silencers (mufflers). The crankshaft is geared directly to the clutch, no counter balancer shaft is used. Starting is by electric starter only. Lubrication is wet sump using a trochoid pump; an oil radiator assists with cooling. Both the FJ1100 and FJ1200 were fitted with an additional fuel vapour recovery system to comply with California emission regulations.|$|R
5000|$|Thermal barrier ceramic {{coatings}} {{are becoming}} more common in automotive applications. They are specifically designed to reduce heat loss from engine exhaust system components including exhaust manifolds, turbocharger casings, <b>exhaust</b> headers, <b>downpipes</b> and tailpipes. This process {{is also known as}} [...] "exhaust heat management". When used under-bonnet, these have the positive effect of reducing engine bay temperatures, therefore reducing the intake air temperature.|$|R
50|$|Exhausts emit a {{large amount}} of heat into the engine bay, which can have a {{negative}} effect on engine performance by raising the underhood temperatures. As a result, high temperature insulation is used, more commonly known as heat barriers, for exhaust heat management. Thermal barrier ceramic-coatings are specifically designed to reduce heat loss from engine exhaust system components including exhaust manifolds, turbocharger casings, <b>exhaust</b> headers, <b>downpipes</b> and tailpipes. When used under-bonnet, these have the positive effect of reducing engine bay temperatures, therefore lessening the intake temperature. As well as providing thermal protection, these coatings are also used to prevent physical degradation of the composite due to frictional processes. This is possible because when applied, the ceramic material bonds with the composite (instead of merely sticking on the surface with paint), therefore forming a tough coating that doesn't chip or flake easily.|$|R
5000|$|Mechanically, the Coupé quattro {{depended}} {{on a combination}} of components from the GT and the Audi 80 quattro. The quattro permanent four-wheel drive drivetrain was almost identical to that used on the Ur-Quattro - the main differences being the use of the Coupé GT front struts, smaller 256 mm diameter front brake disks, and lower ratios in the gearbox and rear differential. The damper and spring rates were also different from the Ur-Q. It was thus largely identical to the Audi 90 quattro and the North American Audi 4000 quattro. Roadwheels were 6.0Jx14", with steel or aluminium alloy rims dependent on the market. 7.0Jx15" [...] Ronals, almost identical to the Ur-Quattro wheels, were also available. The CQ/90Q/4000Q also received their own <b>exhaust</b> manifold and <b>downpipe</b> (5-3-1, while FWD versions were 5-2-1).|$|R
