5|$|It {{is fairly}} easy to grow in areas with a Mediterranean climate, but <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> well in areas with high summer humidity. It {{requires}} a sunny position in well-drained soil, and tolerates at least moderate frost. It should be pruned lightly, not below the green foliage, as it tends to become straggly with age otherwise. Seeds do not require any treatment prior to sowing, and take 21 to 35 days to germinate.|$|E

Regina arrives to place flowers on her father's grave and is furious to find them there.|$|E

According to these theories, changes in information processing mechanisms, such as speed of processing and working memory, are responsible for ascension from stage to stage. Moreover, differences between individuals in these processes explain why some individuals develop faster than other individuals (Demetriou, 1998).|$|E
25|$|Riepe {{states that}} the Ajivikas belief in predeterminism {{does not mean that}} they were pessimistic.

25|$|However, making {{cotton and}} {{textiles}} fair trade {{does not always}} benefit laborers. Burkina Faso and Mali export the largest amount of cotton in Africa. Although many cotton plantations in these countries attained fair trade certification in the 1990s, participation in fair trade further ingrains existing power relations and inequalities that cause poverty in Africa rather than challenging them. Fair trade <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> much for farmers when it does not challenge the system that marginalizes producers. Despite not empowering farmers, the change to fair trade cotton has positive effects including female participation in cultivation.|$|E
25|$|One {{problem the}} extreme {{southern}} part of the state has had in the past decade is the contamination of water from the drainage of the Valley of Mexico.

The state is negotiating federal and other help to treat and recycle this water so that it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> further damage to state agriculture and environment.|$|E
