40|$|The <b>game</b> <b>of</b> <b>LOTTO</b> is {{the most}} common form of lottery {{participation}} in the U. S. Participation in LOTTO requires the purchase of a six-number lottery ticket. Individuals are allowed to select their ticket numbers, or they are assigned a randomly selected set of numbers. However, regardless of their historical persistence and geographic availability, lotteries continue to generate significant criticism and concern. Two issues dominate most public policy debate. Who plays the lottery, and why do they play? Traditionally, these questions are addressed using individualist models of social action. Such models assume that psychological internal states, such as attitudes, beliefs and processes of rationality are the primary mechanisms that facilitate participation. In contrast, structural models of social action suggest that networks of social relations, and the information and resources that flow through such relations are the primary mechanisms that facilitate participation. Using self-report survey data obtained from 245 randomly selected adults, as well as ethnographic data, I operationalize individualist and social network models, and examine two central issues: who participates in lotteries, and why do they participate. Three findings are particularly noteworthy. First, the empirically measured psychological internal states that many individual's possess about lottery participation appear inconsistent with several assumptions of the individualist model. Second, lottery participation appears to build solidarity between many participants and the members of their primary network of social relations through discussions about winning. Third, for most people the attraction of participation appears to be affective in nature rather than economic. Thus, lottery participation induces a state of positive anticipation. Further, the socially organized process that individual's initiate in order to induce this affective state is similar to, but quite different than the process of "emotion work. " Thus, I label this process "emotion play. ...|$|E

40|$|To {{what extent}} {{individual}} choices {{are influenced by}} media exposure? We try to provide evidence on this issue considering how the sales <b>of</b> <b>lotto</b> tickets {{are determined by the}} size of the top prize (the jackpot) compared to the amount of attention that media devote to the game. We use data on the Italian SuperEnalotto (2003 - 2010) and estimate tickets sales in relation to the jackpot size and to several measures <b>of</b> <b>lotto</b> media coverage. To take into account that media attention may be affected by the amount of tickets sold we instrument media coverage with the availability of other newsworthy material (sport events and disasters). It emerges that media attention to the game is inversely related to the availability of other news. Two-Stage-Least Squares Estimations show that, given the jackpot size, players spend more on lotto when media attention to the game is higher.

40|$|This chapter {{provides}} an outline to the statistical, economic, and practical considerations relevant to designing lottery games. The {{focus is on}} <b>lotto</b> but some <b>of</b> the issues apply more generally. We illustrate the analysis using an estimated statistical model of the determinants <b>of</b> <b>lotto</b> sales, that builds on recent research on horsetrack betting, to simulate {{the way in which}} changing the design <b>of</b> <b>lotto</b> <b>games</b> might affect their sales using data for the UK. The research complements recent lottery research that models the proximate determinants of sales, such as jackpot size, by exploiting changes induced by rollovers as a source of natural experiments. The approach pursued here assumes that what matters for sales is the shape of the prize distribution and this shape is summarized by the first three moments of the prize distribution (mean, variance, and skewness). The methodology builds on the characteristics approach to demand analysis that was pioneered by Lancaster. The approach has the advantage that {{it can be used to}} simulate the effects of hypothetical changes in the shape of the prize distribution that come about because <b>of</b> <b>game</b> design variation. We estimate the model, taking account of the endogeneity of the moments, and use the estimates to simulate how sales would evolve if game design were changed...|$|R
