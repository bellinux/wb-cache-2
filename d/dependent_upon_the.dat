5|$|Historically, Sarawak's {{economy was}} {{stagnant}} during {{the rule of}} previous three white Rajahs. After the formation of Malaysia, Sarawak GDP growth rate has risen due to increase in petroleum output and the rise in global petroleum prices.

5|$|In {{the early}} years in western Virginia, pioneer {{settlers}} were primarily concerned with providing defense from Native American attacks, so little emphasis was placed upon education.

With the growth of settlement in Pearsall's Flats, and later Romney, the need for educational facilities became apparent and the community began plans for the establishment of schools and churches.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to the criticism that NPC behavior had been too simplistic in Morrowind, Bethesda developed the Radiant A.I. system for Oblivion. NPCs were designed to make choices, rather than complete scripted routines, to achieve predetermined goals. The manner in which goals such as eating, sleeping, reading, and speaking to others are fulfilled is <b>dependent</b> <b>upon</b> <b>the</b> environment, the choices of other NPCs, and programmed personality values. For example, an NPC whose goal is to find food may eventually resort to stealing from others, if they are given the opportunity {{and if it is}} in their character. These development mechanics allowed Bethesda to create NPCs who could engage in complex activities.|$|E

5|$|Like other mouse lemurs, {{the gray}} mouse lemur uses {{what has been}} {{described}} as a harmonic whistle call that is lower in frequency and shorter in duration than its close relative, the brown mouse lemur. In addition, it has been found that the types of vocalizations emitted by the gray mouse lemur can be <b>dependent</b> <b>upon</b> <b>the</b> environment. In the more open dry forest habitats favored by the gray mouse lemur, trill calls are more common and effective since they carry faster and are less likely to be masked by the wind, while chirp calls are more common in the brown mouse lemur, which favors closed rain forest habitats.|$|E
5|$|The Texian {{army was}} {{a force of}} 810 volunteers and staff at this point, but few had any {{military}} training and experience. Faced with past desertions, discipline flaws, and individual indecisiveness of volunteers in training, Houston knew they were {{not yet ready to}} engage the Mexican army. Compounding the situation were the civilian refugees <b>dependent</b> <b>upon</b> <b>the</b> army for their protection. The news of Fannin's capture, combined with his doubts about the readiness of the Texian army, led Houston to order a retreat on March 26. Some of the troops viewed the decision as cowardice with Sesma sitting just {{on the other side of}} the Colorado, and several hundred men deserted.|$|E
5|$|Variation of {{the wing}} beat may also occur, not just amongst {{different}} species, but even among individuals at different times. In general, the frequency is <b>dependent</b> <b>upon</b> <b>the</b> ratio between the power {{of the wing}} muscles and the resistance of the load. Large-winged, light-bodied butterflies may have a wing beat frequency of 4–20 per second whereas small-winged, heavy-bodied flies and bees beat their wings more than 100 times a second and mosquitoes can beat up to 988–1046 times a second. The same goes for flight; though it is generally difficult to estimate the speed of insects in flight, most insects can probably fly faster in nature than they do in controlled experiments.|$|E

5|$|Every {{participant}} at the Paralympics {{has their}} disability grouped {{into one of}} five disability categories; amputation, the condition may be congenital or sustained through injury or illness; cerebral palsy; wheelchair athletes, there is often overlap between this and other categories; visual impairment, including blindness; Les autres, any physical disability that does not fall strictly {{under one of the}} other categories, for example dwarfism or multiple sclerosis. Each Paralympic sport then has its own classifications, <b>dependent</b> <b>upon</b> <b>the</b> specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. Some sports, such as athletics, divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities, other sports, for example swimming, group competitors from different categories together, the only separation being based on the severity of the disability.|$|E
5|$|The 1910 general {{elections}} {{had left the}} Liberals as a minority government <b>dependent</b> <b>upon</b> <b>the</b> support of Irish Nationalists. As desired by the Nationalists, Asquith introduced legislation that would give Ireland Home Rule, but the Conservatives and Unionists opposed it. As tempers rose over the Home Rule Bill, which {{would never have been}} possible without the Parliament Act, relations between the elderly Knollys and the Conservatives became poor, and he was pushed into retirement. Desperate to avoid the prospect of civil war in Ireland between Unionists and Nationalists, George called a meeting of all parties at Buckingham Palace in July 1914 in an attempt to negotiate a settlement. After four days the conference ended without an agreement. Political developments in Britain and Ireland were overtaken by events in Europe, and the issue of Irish Home Rule was shelved.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} and political differences between western and eastern Virginia began to grow. Following Virginia's secession from the Union in 1861, the Restored Government of Virginia was established at Wheeling during the American Civil War. Despite West Virginia receiving Union statehood on June 20, 1863, sympathies and loyalties within the state's borders remained divided, especially within areas economically <b>dependent</b> <b>upon</b> <b>the</b> plantation system. However, slaveowners in western Virginia tended to own fewer slaves {{than their counterparts in}} eastern Virginia and many did not support Virginia's secession. In Mason County, where small farms were reliant upon slavery, its residents overwhelmingly supported the Union cause. During the war, many plantations in West Virginia served as preferred venues for military headquarters and meeting places for both Union and Confederate military officers due to their adequate accommodations and resources. Altona near Charles Town was utilized as a military headquarters and meeting place for Union generals Philip Sheridan and Ulysses S. Grant, with Sheridan making use of the farm's horses and carriage. Other plantations, like Mill Island and Willow Wall near Moorefield, and Elmwood near Shepherdstown, were utilized as hospitals for wounded soldiers and irregulars.|$|E
