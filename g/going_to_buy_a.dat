500|$|Dean Field found a {{love for}} travel with his Model T. He took {{it all the way}} to California for {{seminars}} on mathematics and education. However, in 1927 rumors began to abound campus that Field was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> Model A. Field quelled the rumors with a personal interview in the last issue of the 1927 Technique. By September 1928, Field felt he could not travel as much with the dilapidated Model T. To the dismay of the student body the vehicle was discarded by Dean Field in 1928 and a Model A was purchased. Field's Model A lasted until 1934 in which he bought a Ford V8. He would drive over [...] in all three cars during his Georgia Tech tenure of 1900–1945.|$|E
500|$|According to Rob Kay, the game's Lead Designer, {{the idea}} of Guitar Hero was {{directly}} inspired by Konami's Guitar Freaks arcade game, where the player used a guitar-shaped controller {{to interact with the}} game. At the time, GuitarFreaks had not seen much exposure in North America. [...] RedOctane was making dance pads for games like Dance Dance Revolution for home consoles and also operated an online video rental service similar to Netflix. [...] RedOctane's Kai and Charles Huang recognized the popularity of GuitarFreaks in Japan through their rental service, and planned to create guitar controllers to bring the game to North America. [...] The Huangs raised $1.75million for the effort, despite being turned down by some investors who [...] "thought [...] was too weird". Greg Fischbach, {{one of the founders of}} Acclaim Entertainment, noted, regretfully several years later, they had passed on Guitar Hero, questioning [...] "Who's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> peripheral like that?" [...] The Huangs approached Harmonix, who had previously made music video games such as Frequency, Amplitude and Karaoke Revolution about making a guitar-based video game for those controllers. With a budget of about one million dollars (which Kay noted was [...] "pretty tiny for a video game"), the two companies worked together to develop Guitar Hero. Kay noted that [...] "No one had any notions about it being a massive success; we all just thought it would be fun to do." [...] Harmonix's president Alex Rigopulos also claims that former Microsoft vice-president of game publishing Ed Fries indirectly influenced the game's creation, who had previously told Harmonix when they were pitching Frequency to Microsoft that no music-rhythm game would succeed without custom hardware for it, prompting Rigopulos to investigate the Guitar Hero opportunity when it arose.|$|E

I do not think that if I would have looked into a Magic Eight-ball, I could have predicted all the changes that I have seen or that they would have happened this fast.
