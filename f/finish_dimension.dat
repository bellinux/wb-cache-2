50|$|Roller {{burnishing}} is {{a method}} of cold working metal surfaces to induce compressive residual stresses and enhance surface roughness qualities. The tooling typically consists of a hardened sphere or cylindrical roller. These tools are pressed onto/across the part being processed. The part (or the tool in some applications) must be moving at a constant rate of speed, for example {{in the case of}} roller burnishing a part on a lathe, the part is spinning and the burnishing tool is moved across the surface as a constant rate; therefore, producing a very consistent finish across the part. Another application is thrust bearing surfaces of some production crankshafts. A dual roller (cylindrical) tool is moved into the thrust bearing journal of a crankshaft, while the crankshaft is spinning the tool is indexed (so each roller is perpendicular to the thrust surface while backing each other up) deforming the surfaces. So the diameters of each roller added together (compensated for elastic deformation) equals the <b>finish</b> <b>dimension</b> of the thrust bearing.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. During {{the last}} 90 years, {{a lot of}} works have been {{published}} about rolling theories for the two-roll rolling process (2 RP). In the last decades, the three-roll process (3 RP) has become a significant technique {{in the production of}} wire rod and bars, as it allows to cover a wide range of <b>finished</b> <b>dimensions</b> with one pass design, or to realize very close tolerances, depending on the pass design method used (free size rolling or high precision rolling). Horihata and Motomura [2] made use of the upper bound theorem to construct a method for spread calculation, but up to now, a straightforward mathematical method for calculation of stress distribution, roll forces, torques and forward slip is still missing. The present paper aims at a transfer of the slab method, which is well-known and established for the 2 RP, to the 3 RP. After the rolling theory for flat passes is introduced, Lendl’s equivalent pass method is transferred to the 3 RP, which allows the calculation of section passes. Computational results show, that roll forces, torques and forward slips can be calculated under inclusion of elastic stand feedback and interstand tensions. Therefore the model can be used for roll speed set-up to minimize interstand tensions, which is of great importance for the rolling industry...|$|R

40|$|A log {{breakdown}} model, SAW 3 D, {{was developed}} to optimize lumber recovery from logs of any shape in 3 -dimensional space. The program uses a polygonal cross section representation of logs; three nested dynamic programming (DP) algorithms to optimize log breakdown, flitch and cant edging, and trimming operations; and a simple heuristic search method {{to find the best}} position combinations. After receiving the log scanning data, the program mathematically rotates the log and skews it horizontally. Then the log is sawn into slabs, flitches or cants using the first level DP algorithm. For each piece cut from the log, the program orients it and then edges it into untrimmed lumber using the second level DP algorithm.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to provide an {{overview}} of the use of prefabricated panels in external building retrofitting. Building retrofit represents a pivotal point in terms of energy efficiency, as stressed by the European Directives EPBD 2002 / 91 /EC, EED 2012 / 27 /EU, 2009 / 28 /EC, 2010 / 31 /EU as well as by Horizon 2020, that also underlines the relevance of prefabrication as a primary retrofit strategies. Prefabrication can help overcoming the issues connected to traditional retrofit and provides advantages in terms of standardization in construction, a certain flexibility in architecture and the combination with conventional retrofit options; European projects, research works and architects designs have resulted in several proposals mainly focusing on residential context. The review of the state of the art shows several approaches in terms of prefabricated panels: large modules, small modules, structural steel modules and partially prefabricated modules. The main challenges are linked to design, fabrication, transport and installation: the classification is based on those parameters, identifying the most promising innovation fields to be further investigated. The building envelope represents a critical element to reach the 2050 decarbonisation goals; prefabrication in retrofit is expected to become a major tool to reach these goals.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this experimental study is {{the determination of the}} flexural properties of reinforced and unreinforced glued-laminated beam. Why reinforcing glulam beam? Reinforced glulam beams cost less because the use of reinforcement will reduce the need of a top grade laminate on the extreme tension face (less high grade material can be used); moreover the volume of wood is reduced. Also, reinforced glulam beams have lower product variability, they are not affected by natural growth characteristics, and the manufacture of reinforcement is consistent and controlled. Two types of reinforcement were investigated: steel plate and carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP). The wood part of all the beams were made by laminating three wood beams of 6 by 3. 6 by 176 cm. The unreinforced beams are made only from wood having a <b>finished</b> <b>dimension</b> equal to 6 by 11 by 176 cm. The steel reinforced beams were glulam wood beams fully covered on one side using steel plate of thickness equal to 1. 5 mm. The CFRP reinforced beams were glulam wood beams covered with CFRP of thickness of 1. 2 mm and width of 5 cm and the length of 176 cm. The results indicate that the behavior of reinforced beams is totally different from that of unreinforced one. The reinforcement has changed the mode of failure from brittle to ductile and has increased the load-carrying capacity of the beams. PublishedN/...|$|R

500|$|Experiments {{are being}} {{performed}} on the Avogadro Project's silicon spheres to determine whether their masses are most stable when stored in a vacuum, a partial vacuum, or ambient pressure. However, no technical means currently exist to prove a long-term stability any better {{than that of the}} IPK's because the most sensitive and accurate measurements of mass are made with dual-pan balances like the BIPM's FB2 flexure-strip balance (see External links, below). Balances can only compare the mass of a silicon sphere to that of a reference mass. Given the latest understanding of the lack of long-term mass stability with the IPK and its replicas, there is no known, perfectly stable mass artifact to compare against. Single-pan scales, which measure weight relative to an invariant of nature, are not precise to the necessary long-term uncertainty of [...] parts per billion. Another issue to be overcome is that silicon oxidizes and forms a thin layer (equivalent to [...] silicon atoms) of silicon dioxide (quartz) and silicon monoxide. This layer slightly increases the mass of the sphere, an effect that must be accounted for when polishing the sphere to its <b>finished</b> <b>dimension.</b> Oxidation is not an issue with platinum and iridium, both of which are noble metals that are roughly as cathodic as oxygen and therefore don't oxidize unless coaxed {{to do so in the}} laboratory.

Determination of the full stress tensor is briefly described, and alternate mechanical, magnetic, and ultrasonic methods of residual stress measurement are compared. Sources of error arising in practical application are described. Subsurface measurement is shown to be necessary to accurately determine the stress distributions produced by surface finishing such as machining, grinding, and shot peening, including corrections for penetration of the x-ray beam and layer removal. Current applications of line broadening for the prediction of material property gradients such as yield strength in machined and shot peened surfaces, and hardness in steels are presented. The development of models for the prediction of thermal, cyclic, and overload residual stress relaxation are described. X-RAY DIFFRACTION (XRD) STRESS MEASUREMENT {{can be a powerful}} tool for failure analysis or process development studies. Quantifying the residual stresses present in a component, which may either accelerate or arrest fatigue or stress corrosion cracking, is frequently crucial to understanding the cause of failure. Successful machining, grinding, shot peening, or heat treatment may hinge upon achieving not only the appropriate surface <b>finish,</b> <b>dimensions,</b> case depth or hardness, but also a residual stress distribution producing the longest component life.

The mechanical properties of the sections were determined as a function of extrusion conditions; these properties are sensitive to the choice of extrusion temperature, presumably reflecting a tendency for residual work hardening to increase at the lower extrusion temperatures...|$|R
