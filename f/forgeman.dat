50|$|Hot short iron can {{be worked}}, {{but it has}} to be worked at low {{temperatures}}. Working at lower temperatures requires more physical effort from the smith or <b>forgeman.</b> The metal must be struck more often and harder to achieve the same result. A mildly sulfur contaminated bar can be worked, but it requires a great deal more time and effort.|$|E
5000|$|Released half a {{year after}} the campaign, the free Sorrow's Furnace {{expansion}} returned players to the Shiverpeak mountains, specifically to the caverns underneath it. There, they participate in a sequence of quests with the final goal of defeating the Iron <b>Forgeman,</b> an immense automaton used by the Stone Summit dwarves to drive their war effort. Sorrow's Furnace introduced [...] "unique items" [...] to Guild Wars: these are items of set stats dropped by bosses. This model was repeated and expanded in the following Factions, Nightfall and Eye of the North releases.|$|E
5000|$|In the 18th century, Powell's Pool (then {{known as}} New Forge Pool) near Boldmere Gate {{was the site}} of the mill used by John Wyatt to {{experiment}} with mechanised cotton spinning. Along with Lewis Paul, he developed the roller spinning machine and the flyer-and-bobbin system (Paul patented the former on 24 June 1738). In 1750, the mill was used by William Powell to manufacture spades (using locally-grown ash wood for the handles). It is believed that the first steel garden fork was manufactured at the mill. [...] The building was later used to produce steel for the production of pen nibs. The Ordnance Survey's First Series map (1834) identifies a forge in this area, of which John Willets (a <b>forgeman),</b> John Page (a spade maker), and John Harris (a saw maker) have all been identified as proprietors.|$|E
50|$|Many of the {{ironworks}} {{were founded}} by Louis de Geer and other Dutch entrepreneurs {{who set up}} ironworks in Sweden in the 1610s and 1620s, with blast furnaces and finery forges. Most of the early <b>forgemen</b> were also from Wallonia.|$|R

5000|$|By 1863 {{there were}} 3,600 {{employees}} at the works including 1,993 miners, 420 furnacemen, 770 <b>forgemen</b> and 323 engineers.In 1864 a second steam hammer with an 8-ton ram was installed for heavy forgings. In 1871 a third steam hammer of 7 tons was installed. New rolling mills were also built to meet demand for iron plates in shipbuilding, supplied by slabs forged in the works. By 1867 there were about 4,000 employees. An description of the works at that time said ...|$|R
50|$|Construction of {{the plant}} began in June 1790, {{including}} blast furnaces and casting shops.The furnaces had square bases, tapering as they rose to about 50 ft in height. The two furnaces were blown in on 13 August 1791 and the first casting {{was made by the}} <b>forgemen</b> three days later.At first the works produced domestic goods, but soon began producing industrial products including parts for steam engines.In 1795 the company won contracts to provide guns, shot and shells to the government, which had been at war with revolutionary France since 1793. By 1799 the works were producing about 2,000 tons of pig iron per year, from which iron goods were made that ranged from columns used in mill construction to garden furniture.|$|R
50|$|Iron {{is said to}} {{have been}} worked in the {{vicinity}} of Bradford in Roman times. The monks of Rievaulx Abbey to the east were working iron on land owned by their monastery in 1150, and <b>forgemen</b> are mentioned in 1358.Surface coal was being extracted from outcrops and shallow pits by 1360, and coal mines were worked by 1502.The Bowling Ironworks were established in the 1780s to smelt and forge iron from the Black Bed ironstone deposits using coal from the Better Bed seam, both of which lay under the site.The ironstone yields about 32% iron.The Better Bed coal is free of sulfur, making it ideal for furnaces used in smelting, puddling and forging.The Black Bed coal, nearer to the surface, could be sold or used for firing boilers and other purposes.|$|R
