60|$|The {{next moment}} <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cold, {{glittering}} salon, with porcelain stove, unlit, and gilded ornaments, and polished floor. A pendule on the mantel-piece struck nine o'clock.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pas du tout," [...] d'Alcacer {{assured her}} with {{whimsical}} gravity. [...] "I felt nothing. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> state of blessed vacuity. I believe I was the happiest of us three. Unless you, too, Mrs. Travers. [...] ." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Anyhow, {{it was a}} {{road and}} <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> wagon," [...] Carrie rejoined. [...] "When the road stopped and we hit the real wild country, I got frightened, like a child. What use is there in {{starting}} out, if you can't go on?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>in</b> <b>a</b> beam of {{sunlight}} filtered through {{a sheet of}} factory cotton hung against a frosted skylight.|$|R
5000|$|Edwards omitted Reich's orgone therapy {{from the}} Encyclopedia article because, he said, [...] "it {{is of no}} {{philosophical}} interest." [...] But <b>in</b> <b>a</b> BBC interview he said somewhat more: [...] "I concede that Reich had no real competence as a physicist... At the same time I am quite convinced that the orgone theory cannot be complete nonsense. For a number of years, largely out of curiosity, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> orgone accumulator once a day." ...|$|R
60|$|I did {{not enter}} the big, lonely room. I went to my own chamber, which, I had just been informed, was the best <b>in</b> the house. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>in</b> <b>an</b> easy-chair by the open window. I looked up to the {{twinkling}} stars.|$|R
60|$|I {{reached the}} house of the Greenes and dumped the head of Louis Devoe into the basket that still hung by the nail in the door-jamb. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> chair under the awning and waited. The sun was within two hours of setting. Chloe came out and looked surprised.|$|E
60|$|At the word, with a small, sudden motion, {{she clung}} near to me. I raised {{her face to}} mine, I kissed it, and she bowed her brow upon my bosom, {{clasping}} me tight. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> mere whirl like a man drunken. Then I heard her voice sound very small and muffled in my clothes.|$|E
60|$|Poor little Mowcher turned so chilly {{after all}} her crying and fretting, that she turned round on the fender, putting her poor little wet feet {{in among the}} ashes to warm them, and sat looking at the fire, like a large doll. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> chair {{on the other side}} of the hearth, lost in unhappy reflections, and looking at the fire too, and {{sometimes}} at her.|$|E
60|$|There is nothing, however, {{like taking}} things philosophically; so, after venting my spite {{at the weather}} {{in one or two}} short grumbles, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{passable}} state of equanimity to breakfast. During the meal I discussed with Mr Stone the prospects of the impending journey, and indulged <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few excursive remarks upon snow-shoe travelling, whilst he related a few incidents of his own eventful career in the country.|$|R
60|$|I {{found the}} fire burning clear enough {{in my room}} by this time, and the {{curtains}} drawn before the windows and round the bed, giving it a very snug appearance. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>in</b> <b>a</b> great chair upon the hearth to meditate on my happiness; and had enjoyed the contemplation of it for some time, when I found a likeness of Miss Dartle looking eagerly at me from above the chimney-piece.|$|R
40|$|Last week, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> old house, {{at a long}} planked table, with a {{plate of}} salad and humus and my friend Karen Swallow Prior, and we lingered and laughed too loud, till Karen had to leave for a doctor’s {{appointment}} that involved some anxious test results. Who knew how this was really going to go — was it {{the beginning of a}} completely unwanted life detour? How would the day, this story end? Living {{in the middle of a}} story can be unspeakably hard. So we circled round Karen and enfolded her in vulnerable prayer… and waited to know the next page…Karen may be an author, a Professor of English at Liberty University, a contributing writer for The Atlantic. com and for Christianity Today, and a Research Fellow with the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, but she’s mostly the realest, most down to earth, transparent, thoughtful woman — and it’s a grace to welcome the wise vulnerability of my friend Karen Swallow Prior — to the farm’s front porch today...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have struggled," [...] he continued, [...] "to adopt a {{charitable}} view of your profession. I {{know that the}} world changes quickly, while we, who prefer to remain outside its orbit, of necessity lose touch with its new ideas and new fashions. So I said to myself {{that there should be}} no mistake. For that reason <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> theater last night almost for the first time in my life. I saw you act." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{sat down}} on the place which she had occupied. She had looked at me for one moment when she kissed my hand. I forgot Ambrose and his confession; I forgot the coming trial; I forgot my {{professional}} duties and my English friends. There <b>I</b> <b>sat,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> fool's elysium of my own making, with absolutely nothing in my mind but the picture of Naomi's face at the moment when she had last looked at me! ...|$|E
60|$|I {{could have}} shouted with joy at her control. She {{finished}} the concluding stanza without faltering {{and then slowly}} guided the conversation into less perilous channels. And all the while <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> half-daze, the drunken riot of the steerage breaking through the bulkhead, the man I feared and the woman I loved talking on and on. The table was not cleared. The man who had taken Mugridge’s place had evidently joined his comrades in the forecastle.|$|E
5000|$|Recollecting his {{experience}} {{during the trial}} of the coup, Obasanjo says “My saddest day was when <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> front of <b>a</b> military panel set up by late former Head of State, Sani Abacha to try me over a phantom coup, and sentenced to death and later commuted to 30 years imprisonment.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I saw her. The dining-room {{doors were}} thrown open; and, {{as it was}} Christmas-time, the {{servants}} were allowed to assemble in the hall, to {{hear some of the}} ladies sing and play. Mr. Rochester would have me to come <b>in,</b> and <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>in</b> <b>a</b> quiet corner and watched them. I never saw a more splendid scene: the ladies were magnificently dressed; most of them--at least most of the younger ones--looked handsome; but Miss Ingram was certainly the queen." ...|$|R
60|$|We lunched {{with the}} other three at Romsey. Then <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> front for <b>a</b> little while {{to talk to my}} Malachi. When I looked back, Shend was solidly asleep, and stayed so for the next two hours, while Leggatt chased Attley's fat Daimler along the green-speckled hedges. He woke up when we said good-bye at Mittleham, with {{promises}} to meet again very soon.|$|R
6000|$|A laugh went up, and then, {{at sight}} of Mrs. Makely heading our little party, the people round Homos civilly made way for us. She rushed upon him, and seized {{his hand in}} both of hers; she dropped her fan, parasol, gloves, handkerchief, and vinaigrette in the grass to do so. [...] "Oh, Mr. Homos," [...] she fluted, and the tears came into her eyes, [...] "it was beautiful, beautiful, every word of it! <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> perfect trance from {{beginning}} to end, and I {{felt that it was}} all as true as it was beautiful. People all around me were breathless with interest, and I don't know how I can ever thank you enough." ...|$|E
60|$|On {{the morning}} of the third day, when we had been forty-eight hours in the Cage, I awoke with a great relief of spirits, very weak and weary indeed, but seeing things of the right size and with their honest, {{everyday}} appearance. I had a mind to eat, moreover, rose from bed of my own movement, and as soon as we had breakfasted, stepped to the entry of the Cage and sat down outside {{in the top of the}} wood. It was a grey day with a cool, mild air: and <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> dream all morning, only disturbed by the passing by of Cluny's scouts and servants coming with provisions and reports; for as the coast was at that time clear, you might almost say he held court openly.|$|E
6000|$|I {{have had}} a good {{deal to do with}} Jews {{in the course of my}} life, {{although}} I never borrowed any money of them. Once <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> coach opposite a Jew--a symbol of old clothes' bags--an Isaiah of Hollywell Street. He would close the window; I opened it. He closed it again; upon which, in a very solemn tone, I said to him, [...] "Son of Abraham! thou smellest; son of Isaac! thou art offensive; son of Jacob! thou stinkest foully. See the man in the moon! he is holding his nose at thee at that distance; dost thou think that I, sitting here, can endure it any longer?" [...] My Jew was astounded, opened the window forthwith himself, and said, [...] "he was sorry he did not know before I was so great a gentleman." ...|$|E
40|$|<b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> {{chilling}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> tea shop <b>in</b> India, <b>a</b> man {{ran from}} store to store yelling “he is here. ” My friend, the shop owner, quickly gathered and dispatched his cash. The local early-warning-system {{for the tax}} collector had been activated. The tax auditor was making the rounds. The first few businesses audited take a hit, but the neighbourhood watch made sure the majority evaded taxes. Conservative estimates suggest that for every rupee collected in taxes in India, at least two rupees remain outstanding. Compare this to $ 2 evaded for every $ 10 collected in the U. S...|$|R
40|$|It {{was late}} afternoon, <b>I</b> was <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> stylish seminar {{room on the}} seventh floor of the new science {{building}} of the University of Barcelona, listening to a presentation about the city’s Fourth Strategy for economic regeneration, when a flash of lightening and an almighty crack of thunder heralded a tremendous down-pour. Torrential rain cascaded down the windows as the presenter tried to ignore the storm in the streets. “How do I compete with that? ” I thought to myself. There have been two Public Art Observatory (PAO) workshops and another sym-posium since I presented “O Brave New World”: <b>A</b> Change <b>in</b> the Weather ” at th...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then. I {{had come}} home to dinner {{particularly}} tired after a long day. <b>I</b> had <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> attic {{the greater part of}} the afternoon (a case of top story valvular trouble) and had had to sit <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cramped position which practically forbade sleep. I was feeling, therefore, none too well pleased, when a little while after dinner the bell rang and Simmons brought word to the library that there was <b>a</b> client <b>in</b> the consulting-room. I reminded the fellow that I could not possibly consider a case at such an advanced hour unless I were paid emergency overtime wages with time and a half during the day of recovery." ...|$|R
60|$|As Wemmick and Miss Skiffins sat side by side, and as <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> shadowy corner, I {{observed}} {{a slow and}} gradual elongation of Mr. Wemmick's mouth, powerfully suggestive of his slowly and gradually stealing his arm round Miss Skiffins's waist. In course of time I saw his hand appear {{on the other side}} of Miss Skiffins; but at that moment Miss Skiffins neatly stopped him with the green glove, unwound his arm again as if it were an article of dress, and with the greatest deliberation laid it on the table before her. Miss Skiffins's composure while she did this was one of the most remarkable sights I have ever seen, and if I could have thought the act consistent with abstraction of mind, I should have deemed that Miss Skiffins performed it mechanically.|$|E
60|$|MRS YELVERTON BARRY: (In lowcorsaged opal balldress and elbowlength ivory gloves, {{wearing a}} sabletrimmed brickquilted dolman, a comb of brilliants and panache of osprey in her hair) Arrest him, constable. He wrote me an {{anonymous}} letter in prentice backhand {{when my husband}} was in the North Riding of Tipperary on the Munster circuit, signed James Lovebirch. He {{said that he had}} seen from the gods my peerless globes as <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> box of the Theatre Royal at a command performance of La Cigale. I deeply inflamed him, he said. He made improper overtures to me to misconduct myself at half past four p.m. on the following Thursday, Dunsink time. He offered to send me through the post a work of fiction by Monsieur Paul de Kock, entitled The Girl with the Three Pairs of Stays.|$|E
6000|$|While Dr. Bretton listened, {{and waited}} {{an opening in}} the magic circle, his glance restlessly {{sweeping}} the room at intervals, lighted by chance on me, where <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> quiet nook not far from my godmother and M. de Bassompierre, who, as usual, were engaged in what Mr. Home called [...] "a two-handed crack:" [...] what the Count would have interpreted as a tête-à-tête. Graham smiled recognition, crossed the room, asked me how I was, told me I looked pale. I also had my own smile at my own thought: it was now about three months since Dr. John had spoken to me-a lapse of which he was not even conscious. He sat down, and became silent. His wish was rather to look than converse. Ginevra and Paulina were now opposite to him: he could gaze his fill: he surveyed both forms--studied both faces.|$|E
60|$|I was of {{a serious}} mind to take the advice. To prove this I called for my wrap-rascal and cane, and for a fellow with a {{flambeau}} to light me. But just then the party arrived from the assembly. I was tempted, and <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down again <b>in</b> <b>a</b> corner of the room, resolved to keep a check upon myself, but to stay awhile.|$|R
60|$|I procured, therefore, such goods as were {{suitable}} for the places I intended to visit, and embarked {{for the second time}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> good ship with other merchants whom I knew to be honourable men. We went from island to island, often making excellent bargains, until one day we landed at a spot which, though covered with fruit trees and abounding in springs of excellent water, appeared to possess neither houses nor people. While my companions wandered here and there gathering flowers and fruit <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>in</b> <b>a</b> shady place, and, having heartily enjoyed the provisions and the wine I had brought with me, I fell asleep, lulled by the murmur of a clear brook which flowed close by.|$|R
60|$|Presently I {{came to a}} low brush fence running zigzag {{through the}} woods, with snares set every few yards in the {{partridge}} and rabbit runs. At the third opening a fine cock partridge swung limp and lifeless from a twitch-up. The cruel wire had torn his neck under his beautiful ruff; the broken wing quills showed how terrible had been his struggle. Hung by the neck till dead!--an atrocious fate to mete out to a noble bird. I followed the hedge of snares {{for a couple of}} hundred yards, finding three more strangled grouse and a brown rabbit. Then <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>in</b> <b>a</b> beautiful spot to watch the life about me, and to catch the snarer at his abominable work.|$|R
60|$|Clad in my plain black robe, I {{sat in the}} guest-chamber of {{the house}} that had been made ready for me. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> carven lion-footed chair, and looked upon the {{swinging}} lamps of scented oil, the pictured tapestries, the rich Syrian rugs--and, amidst all this luxury, bethought me of that tomb of the Harpers which is at Tápé, and of the nine long years of dark loneliness and preparation. I sat; and crouched upon a rug near to the door, lay the aged Atoua. Her hair was white as snow, and shrivelled with age was the wrinkled countenance of the woman who, when all deserted me, had yet clung to me, in her great love forgetting my great sins. Nine years! nine long years! and now, once again, I set my foot in Alexandria! Once again in the appointed circle of things I came forth from the solitude of preparation to be a fate to Cleopatra; and this second time I came not forth to fail.|$|E
60|$|New York, {{always a}} congenial place to gentlemen of {{vitality}} and means and influential connections, had never {{appeared to me}} more sparkling, more inspiring. Winter had relented, spring had not as yet begun. And as <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> corner of the dining-room of my hotel looking out on the sunlit avenue I was conscious of partaking of the vigour and confidence of the well-dressed, clear-eyed people who walked or drove past my window with {{the air of a}} conquering race. What else was there in the world more worth having than this conquering sense? Religion might offer charms to the weak. Yet here religion itself became sensible, and wore the garb of prosperity. The stonework of the tall church on the corner was all lace; and the very saints in their niches, who had known martyrdom and poverty, seemed to have renounced these as foolish, and to look down complacently on the procession of wealth and power.. Across the street, behind a sheet of glass, was a carrosserie where were displayed the shining yellow and black panels of a closed automobile, the cost of which would have built a farm-house and stocked a barn.|$|E
6000|$|Whilst I took my observation, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> high chair, {{made for}} that purpose, with a {{convenience}} before {{you to hold}} the glass. I soon found the cathedral, and then I could not help saying I have been several times up to the stone gallery, but not quite so often up to the iron gallery. Then I brought my eye to the Monument, and was obliged to confess I knew it to be such. The gentleman then moved the glass and desired me to look, which doing, I said, [...] "I think I see Whitehall and St. James's Park, and I see also two great buildings like barns, but I {{do not know what}} they are." [...] "Oh," [...] says the gentleman, [...] "they are the Parliament House and Westminster Abbey." [...] "They may be so," [...] said I; and continuing looking, I perceived the very house at Kensington which I had lived in some time; but of that I took no notice, yet I found my colour come, to think what a life of gaiety and wickedness I had lived. The gentleman, perceiving my disorder, said, [...] "I am afraid I have tired your ladyship; I will make but one remove, more easterly, and then I believe you will allow the place we see to be London." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{easier than}} ye would think," [...] said Alan. [...] "A bare {{hillside}} (ye see) is like all one road; if there's a sentry at one place, ye just go by another. And then the heather's a great help. And everywhere there are friends' houses and friends' byres and haystacks. And besides, when folk {{talk of a}} country covered with troops, it's but {{a kind of a}} byword at the best. A soldier covers nae mair of it than his boot-soles. I have fished a water with a sentry {{on the other side of}} the brae, and killed a fine trout; and <b>I</b> have <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> heather bush within six feet of another, and learned a real bonny tune from his whistling. This was it," [...] said he, and whistled me the air.|$|R
50|$|The Fokker D.XIV was {{a fighter}} {{aircraft}} {{developed in the}} Netherlands in the mid-1920s but which was only produced as a single prototype. It was a low-wing, cantilever monoplane with fixed tailskid undercarriage, the basic concept of which {{was derived from the}} Fokker V.25 that had been developed during World War <b>I.</b> The pilot <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> open cockpit aft of the wing's trailing edge. Flight testing revealed excellent performance, but development was ceased when the prototype crashed, killing the test pilot.|$|R
60|$|Being now in {{possession}} of the secret, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>in</b> <b>a</b> corner, and watched the process of this book manufactory. I noticed one lean, bilious-looking wight, who sought none but the most worm-eaten volumes, printed in black letter. He was evidently constructing some work of profound erudition, that would be purchased by every man who wished to be thought learned, placed upon a conspicuous shelf of his library, or laid open upon his table--but never read. I observed him, now and then, draw a large fragment of biscuit out of his pocket, and gnaw; whether it was his dinner, or whether he was endeavoring to keep off that exhaustion of the stomach, produced by much pondering over dry works, I leave to harder students than myself to determine.|$|R
