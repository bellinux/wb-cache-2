25|$|Trolls are {{the least}} {{intelligent}} of the non-magical creatures. Most of their decisions are based on their instincts. They are quick for their size and have large serrated tusks which produce a narcotic venom which renders the prey mindlessly—and defenselessly—happy. If they can, their preferred kill tactic is to slip their claws under the rib cage and pop the heart out before the muscles have time to tense up, rendering the meat mostly unharmed and tender. They have an extreme aversion to light, noise, and water. The largest pack of trolls were seen in the Eleven Wonders of the World Exhibit in a run-down part of Haven. Very few people have ever managed to single-handedly down a troll. Holly Short once <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> her helmet's eight-hundred-watt high beams, {{the shock of the}} light rendering the troll unconscious.

Kimberly Peirce, {{at the time a}} Columbia University film student, became {{interested}} in the case after reading a 1994 Village Voice article by Donna Minkowitz.

[...] She admired Brandon's audacity, ability to solve complicated problems, and what she perceived as the sense of fantasy invoked by his personality.|$|E

[...] "The flag of the late lamented AAFC flies high, and Paul Brown has the last laugh", the Plain Dealers editorial page proclaimed. Brown said his was [...] "the greatest football team a coach ever had, and there was never a game like this one." [...] In 16 seasons, Brown had led his teams to 12 championships.

Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Munro, the Company's district collector at Mysore, was critical of the high proportion of casualties and questioned Wellesley's decision not to wait for Stevenson. He wrote to Wellesley: [...] "I am tempted {{to think that you}} <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> a view of sharing the glory with the smallest numbers". In response, Wellesley politely rebuffed Munro's accusations and defended his action as necessary because he had received and acted upon incorrect intelligence regarding the Maratha position. Assaye was 34-year-old Wellesley's first major success and despite his anguish over the heavy losses, it was a battle he always held in the highest estimation. After his retirement from active military service, the Duke of Wellington (as he later became known) considered Assaye the finest thing he ever did in the way of fighting even when compared to his later military career.|$|E

500|$|The Sword of Shannara {{has drawn}} {{extensive}} criticism from critics {{who believe that}} Brooks derived too much of his novel from Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. In 1978, American fantasy editor Lin Carter denounced The Sword of Shannara as [...] "the single most cold-blooded, complete rip-off of another book that I have ever read". Elaborating on his disapproval of the book, Carter wrote that [...] "Terry Brooks wasn't trying to imitate Tolkien's prose, just steal his story line and complete cast of characters, and [...] <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> such clumsiness and so heavy-handedly, that he virtually rubbed your nose in it." [...] Roger C. Schlobin was kinder in his assessment, though he still thought that The Sword of Shannara was a disappointment because of its similarities to The Lord of the Rings. Brian Attebery accused The Sword of Shannara of being [...] "undigested Tolkien" [...] which was [...] "especially blatant in its point-for-point correspondence" [...] with The Lord of the Rings. In an educational article on writing, author Orson Scott Card cited The Sword of Shannara as a cautionary example of overly derivative writing, finding the work [...] "artistically displeasing" [...] for this reason.|$|E

The grunt Scully utters when thrown through a table was insisted on by Standards and Practices, giving the reasoning that the show needed to make it clear for the viewers that she was not dead. According to executive producer Frank Spotnitz it was an [...] "arcane, bizarre logic that you have to deal with when you're putting a show on network television." [...] As director Rob Bowman was dissatisfied with the first take of Skinner shoving X against the elevator wall, Mitch Pileggi and Steven Williams decided to do the stunt for real, and Pileggi <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> so much strength that it broke the back of the elevator scenery.

[...] During the 1997 season, when the long-departed Jackie Robinson's number 42 was being retired throughout baseball, and the still-living Doby was being virtually ignored by the media, an editorial in Sports Illustrated pointed out that Doby had to suffer the same indignities that Robinson did, and with nowhere near the media attention and implicit support. Scoop Jackson in 2007 wrote, {{in response to the}} tradition of MLB players wearing jerseys in homage of Robinson, [...] "Second place finishers in America are suckers. And so are those who make the story of history less simple than it needs to be. This happens sometimes in America. Those who don't come first or don't do things a certain way get lost. They disappear." [...] "Jackie got all the publicity for putting up with it (racial slurs). But it was the same thing I had to deal with. He was first, but the crap I took was just as bad.

[...] Despite praising Pegg, the theme of [...] "media control," [...] and the Jagrafess, they criticised it for [...] " [...] to capture the imagination" [...] because there was [...] "no real palpable sense of threat" [...] and that human culture looked identical to modern day. Rupert Smith of The Guardian wrote, [...] "Anything that satirises the profession of journalism is all right with me, but this <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> style." [...] Arnold T Blumburg of Now Playing gave [...] "The Long Game" [...] a grade of B-, describing it as [...] "entertaining" [...] and a welcome throwback to the classic series. However, he questioned the developing tradition of the Doctor not being {{the hero of the}} episode and noted that there were some dangling threads. Reviewing the episode in 2013, Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times was more positive, writing that it [...] "acts brilliantly as a satire of the media." [...] He also praised the guest cast and characters and Adam's departure.

There is another reference to [...] "Justify My Love" [...] {{at one point during}} the intermediate bridge."Veni Vidi Vici" [...] appears next, and is a rap [...] "origin story song" [...] with its lyrics built around Madonna's songs: [...] "I expressed myself, came like a virgin down the aisle / Exposed my naked ass, and I <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> a smile / And when it came to sex, I knew I walked the Borderline / and when I struck a pose, all the gay boys lost their minds". Madonna sings the chorus over simple guitar beats, uttering [...] "I came, I saw, I conquered", the English translation of the song's title. Nas appears for a guest verse talking about his own life as Diplo backs it with shotgun and crunching horn sounds. [...] "S.E.X." [...] is the next track where Madonna asks sarcastically [...] "tell me what you know about sex" [...] over sounds of bass, synths and a string arpeggio. Near the end she lists a number of bondage items like: [...] "Twisted rope, handcuffs, blindfold, string of pearls". Described as both an embodiment and critique of act, [...] "S.E.X." [...] talks about the lack of intimacy with Madonna rapping in a [...] "dispassionate" [...] voice; she purposely made it sound like she had a lisp in her articulation of the words.|$|E
