These were the colors of Sam Houston's ancestor, Sir Hugh, and were adopted by UH {{at the same time}} as the official seal. Scarlet red symbolizes courage or inner strength to face the unknown, and white symbolizes the <b>goodness</b> <b>and</b> purity of spirit embodied in helping one's fellow man.|$|E

5|$|Because {{evolutionary}} naturalism proposes {{an empirical}} account of morality, {{it does not}} require morality to exist objectively; Linville considers the view that this will lead to moral scepticism or antirealism. C. S. Lewis argued that, if evolutionary naturalism is accepted, human morality cannot be described as absolute and objective because moral statements cannot be right or wrong. Despite this, Lewis argued, those who accept evolutionary naturalism still act as if objective moral truths exist, leading Lewis to reject naturalism as incoherent. As an alternative ethical theory, Lewis offered a form of divine command theory which equated God with <b>goodness</b> <b>and</b> treated goodness as an essential part of reality, thus asserting God's existence.|$|E
5|$|The medieval {{doctrine}} of divine simplicity also poses problems for religious language. This suggests that God has no accidental properties– these are properties that a being can have {{which do not}} contribute to its essence. If God has no accidental properties, he cannot be as he is traditionally conceived, because properties such as goodness are accidental. If divine simplicity is accepted, then to describe God as good would entail that <b>goodness</b> <b>and</b> God have the same definition. Such limits can also be problematic to religious believers; for example, the Bible regularly ascribes different emotions to God, ascriptions which would be implausible according to the {{doctrine of}} divine simplicity.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Aquinas, a thirteenth-century {{scholastic}} {{philosopher and}} theologian {{heavily influenced by}} Augustine, proposed a form of the Augustinian theodicy in his Summa Theologica. Aquinas began by attempting to establish the existence of God, through his Five Ways, and then attested that God is good and must have a morally sufficient reason for allowing evil to exist. Aquinas proposed that all goodness in the world must exist perfectly in God, and that, existing perfectly, God must be perfectly good. He concluded that God is <b>goodness,</b> <b>and</b> {{that there is no}} evil in God.|$|E
5000|$|Socrates' {{main concern}} {{was that he did}} not want his {{followers}} to place <b>Goodness,</b> Knowledge, <b>and</b> Truth all on the same level.

50|$|An {{assumption}} of longevity <b>and</b> <b>goodness</b> {{are part of}} the status quo bias. People treat existence as a prima facie case for <b>goodness,</b> aesthetic <b>and</b> longevity increases this preference.The status quo bias affects people's preferences; people report preferences for what they are likely rather than unlikely to receive. People simply assume, with little reason or deliberation, the goodness of existingstates.|$|R
25|$|Some {{theories}} describe {{no higher}} collective value {{than that of}} maximizing pleasure for individual(s). Some even define <b>goodness</b> <b>and</b> intrinsic value as the experience of pleasure, and bad as the experience of pain. This view is called hedonism, a monistic theory of value. It has two main varieties: simple, and Epicurean.|$|E
25|$|Culture is {{understood}} as the sphere in which the human being is educated and knows himself, in which values are formed, in which he recognizes and appreciates truth, <b>goodness,</b> <b>and</b> beauty. It is a fundamental area of apostolate for the Sodalitium, which understands it as a school of humanity, {{and at the same}} time a space for human fulfillment.|$|E
25|$|In religion, ethics, and philosophy, <b>goodness</b> <b>and</b> evil, {{or simply}} good and evil, {{is the concept}} of all human desires and {{behaviors}} as conforming to a dualistic spectrum—wherein in one direction are aspects that are wisely reverent of life and continuity ("good"), and in the other are aspects that are vainly reverent of death and destruction ("evil").|$|E
40|$|The Beauty-is-Good {{stereotype}} {{refers to}} the assumption that attractive people possess sociably desirable personalities and higher moral standards. The existence of this bias suggests that the neural mechanisms for judging facial attractiveness <b>and</b> moral <b>goodness</b> overlap. To investigate this idea, we scanned participants with {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} while they made attractiveness judgments about faces <b>and</b> <b>goodness</b> judgments about hypothetical actions. Activity in the medial orbitofrontal cortex increased as a function of both attractiveness <b>and</b> <b>goodness</b> ratings, whereas activity in the insular cortex decreased with both attractiveness <b>and</b> <b>goodness</b> ratings. Within each of these regions, the activations elicited by attractiveness <b>and</b> <b>goodness</b> judgments were strongly correlated with each other, supporting the idea of similar contributions of each region to both judgments. Moreover, activations in orbitofrontal and insular cortices were negatively correlated with each other, suggesting an opposing relationship between these regions during attractiveness <b>and</b> <b>goodness</b> judgments. These findings have implications for understanding the neural mechanisms of the Beauty-is-Good stereotype...|$|R

25|$|By prayer one {{acknowledges}} God's {{power and}} <b>goodness,</b> <b>and</b> one's own neediness and dependence.

Prayer presupposes faith in God and hope in his goodness. By both, God, to whom one prays, moves the individual to prayer.|$|E
25|$|Theodicy {{can be said}} to be {{defense of}} God's <b>goodness</b> <b>and</b> omnipotence in view of the {{existence}} of evil. Specifically, Theodicy is a specific branch of theology and philosophy which attempts to reconcile belief in God with the perceived existence of evil. As such, theodicy {{can be said to}} attempt to justify the behaviour of God (at least insofar as God allows evil).|$|E

25|$|As souls are immortal, those lacking bodies patrol all {{of heaven}} {{so long as}} their wings are in perfect condition.
