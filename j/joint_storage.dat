The unified supply system allows member companies to concentrate on only publication planning, which in turn allows the supply of books to readers, helping create higher earnings. Furthermore, books are also supplied to bookstores {{doing business with the}} nationwide cooperatives in addition to the direct-dealing of books of the member companies through general distribution services. In 2008, the cooperative signed an MOU with the Seoul Metropolitan Rapid Transit Corporation to operate seven Happy Bookstores in subway lines 5, 6, 7 and 8.

In recent years, flash {{memories}} have become a very important family of such memories. A flash memory cell has q states—state 0. 1 [...] . q- 1 - and can only transit from a lower state to a higher state before the expensive erasure operation takes place. We study rewriting codes that enable the data stored in a group of cells to be rewritten by only shifting the cells to higher states. Since the considered state transitions are irreversible, the number of rewrites is bounded. Our objective is to maximize the number of times the data can be rewritten. We focus on the <b>joint</b> <b>storage</b> of data in flash memories, and study two rewriting codes for two different scenarios. The first code, called floating code, is for the <b>joint</b> <b>storage</b> of multiple variables, where every rewrite changes one variable. The second code, called buffer code, is for remembering the most recent data in a data stream. Many of the codes presented here are either optimal or asymptotically optimal. We also present bounds to the performance of general codes. The results show that rewriting codes can integrate a flash memory’s rewriting capabilities for different variables to a high degree...|$|E

Anticipating continued reduction {{in the cost of}} electricity storage, we look into the potential opportunity in electrical power system where consumers share storage with each other. We consider two different scenarios. In the first scenario, consumers are assumed to already have individual storage devices and they explore cooperation to minimize the realized electricity consumption cost. In the second scenario, a group of consumers is interested to invest in <b>joint</b> <b>storage</b> capacity and operate it cooperatively. The resulting system problems are modeled using cooperative game theory. In both cases, the cooperative games are shown to have non-empty cores and we develop efficient cost allocations in the core with analytical expressions.

In the delivery phase, each user connects randomly to any ρ servers {{out of a total}} of P servers. Thanks to the availability of multiple servers, which model small base stations with limited storage capacity, user demands can be satisfied with reduced storage capacity at each server and reduced delivery rate per server; however, this also leads to reduced multicasting opportunities compared to a single server serving all the users simultaneously. A <b>joint</b> <b>storage</b> and proactive caching scheme is proposed, which exploits coded storage across the servers, uncoded cache placement at the users, and coded delivery; and it is shown that the achievable average sum delivery rate is comparable to that achieved by a single server, while the gap between the two depends on ρ, the available redundancy across servers. It is also shown that the gap can be reduced by increasing the storage capacity at the SBSs. Comment: Currently submitted to WCNC 2018 for revie...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Network coding {{provides}} elegant {{solutions to}} many data transmission problems. The usage of coding for distributed data storage {{has also been}} explored. In this work, we study a <b>joint</b> <b>storage</b> and transmission problem, where a source transmits a file to storage nodes whenever the file is updated, and clients read the file by retrieving data from the storage nodes. The cost includes the transmission cost for file update and file read, {{as well as the}} storage cost. We show that such a problem can be transformed into a pure flow problem and is solvable in polynomial time using linear programming. Coding is often necessary for obtaining the optimal solution with the minimum cost. However, we prove that for networks of generalized tree structures, where adjacent nodes can have asymmetric links between them, file splitting — instead of coding — is sufficient for achieving optimality. In particular, if there is no constraint on the numbers of bits that can be stored in storage nodes, there exists an optimal solution that always transmits and stores the file as a whole. The proof is accompanied by an algorithm that optimally assigns file segments to storage nodes. I...|$|E
40|$|We {{focus in}} this paper on dataset {{reduction}} techniques for use in k-nearest neighbor classification. In such a context, feature and prototype selections have always been independently treated by the standard storage reduction algorithms. While this certifying is theoretically justified {{by the fact that}} each subproblem is NP-hard, we assume {{in this paper}} that a <b>joint</b> <b>storage</b> reduction is in fact more intuitive and can in practice provide better results than two independent processes. Moreover, it avoids a lot of distance calculations by progressively removing useless instances during the feature pruning. While standard selection algorithms often optimize the accuracy to discriminate the set of solutions, we use in this paper a criterion based on an uncertainty measure within a nearest-neighbor graph. This choice comes from recent results that have proven that accuracy is not always the suitable criterion to optimize. In our approach, a feature or an instance is removed if its deletion improves information of the graph. Numerous experiments are presented in this paper and a statistical analysis shows the relevance of our approach, and its tolerance in the presence of noise.

40|$|Abstract—Recent {{technological}} advances have rendered storage a cheap and at large scale available resource. Yet, there exist only few examples in networking that consider storage for enhancing data transfer capabilities. In this paper we study networks with time varying link capacitiy {{and analyze the}} impact of node storage on their capability to convey data from source to destination. We show that storage capacity is quite beneficial {{in terms of the}} amount of data that can be pushed from the source to the destination within a given time horizon. Equivalently, storage can be used to reduce incurred delay for the delivery of a certain amount of data. For linear networks, we show that this performance improvement depends on the relative patterns of link capacity variations. We extend our study to general networks and we use a novel method that iteratively updates the minimum cut of the time expanded graph, in a constructive manner, in the sense that during the process, the storage capacity allocation in the network is shown. Next, we incorporate routing in our methodology and derive a <b>joint</b> <b>storage</b> capacity management and routing policy to maximize the amount of data transferred to the destination. This policy stems from the solution of the maximum flow problem defined for the dynamic network over a certain time period, by using the -relaxation solution method. The later is amenable to distributed implementation, which is a very desirable property for the large scale modern networks which operate without central control. I...|$|E

We report the use of intrathecal (IT) recombinant human N-acetylgalactosamine 4 -sulfatase (arylsulfatase B, or ASB) in a MPS VI child with spinal cord compression whose parents initially refused the surgical treatment. Assessments were performed at baseline, with clinical, neurological and biochemical evaluations, urodynamic studies and MRI of the CNS. Changes on these parameters were evaluated after IT infusions of ASB administered monthly via lumbar puncture (LP) in a IV ERT naive patient. To our knowledge, this was the first MPS VI patient who received IT ERT. Despite significant urodynamic improvement and some neurological amelioration, the patient developed worsening of walking capacity. After IV ERT was started, the patient presented with a generalized hypotonia and a life-saving surgical fixation of the neck was then performed. the results observed on this MPS VI patient suggest that instability of the cervical vertebrae could be unmasked by IV ERT as <b>joint</b> <b>storage</b> is reduced, and the decrease in neck stiffness and stability could confound the expected improvement of SCC manifestations following IT ERT. the study of further patients, if possible in a clinical trial setting, is needed to evaluate the potential of a non-surgical IT ERT treatment of SCC for MPS VI.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we present}} a saline aquifer {{showcase}} model from the North German Basin, predicting the regional pressure impact of a small industrial scale CO 2 storage operation on its surroundings. The static model is based on real geology while the injection program is fictitious. We simulated a rate controlled injection of 2. 5  Million tons CO 2 per year through a single vertical well into the structural top of a dome shaped anticline, {{over a period of}} 10 years. The target is a 20 m thick sandstone layer intercalated in low permeability claystone sequences. We used ECLIPSE 300 with its CO 2 storage module and MUFTE-UG to predict pressure {{at the top of the}} target sandstone layer in 1, 5, 10, and roughly 31  km distance to the injection point. The farthest point represents the structural top of a neighbouring anticlinal dome, another favourable potential storage site. We varied the model’s boundary conditions, permeability, permeability anisotropy, rock compressibility, and injection temperature. A total of nine model scenarios were run, five with MUFTE-UG and another four with ECLIPSE. Comparison of reference scenarios showed that the results of both simulators match well. In the open boundary model, pressure increase is lowest and dissipates back to the pre-injection state within 30 years after injection shutdown. In the fully closed models, pressure peaks are high, equilibrating to a remnant, model-wide overpressure several decades after the end of injection. In the distance, this equilibrated, model-wide overpressure is the actual maximum pressure. In the model scenarios which are laterally half open, half closed, pressure relief is seriously retarded in comparison to the fully open model. In all cases, the pressure maximum arrives at the neighbouring structure (31  km distance) years after the actual injection shutdown. Rock compressibility impacts both the peak pressure and the speed of the pressure build-up and relief. High permeabilities are more important in the immediate injection area than for the regional footprint. In all of our fully closed (i. e. the most pressurized) models, the remnant regional overpressure amounted to about 9 bars. If 10 bars are taken as the maximum tolerable overpressure, then the volumetric storage capacity of the target structure itself is not affected. However, injection into the target structure does affect the storage capacity of the neighbouring site. While a purely volumetric approach yields a cumulative storage capacity of roughly 175  Mt for both structures, a tolerable regional overpressure of 10 bars lowers the <b>joint</b> <b>storage</b> capacity to about 32  Mt CO 2. Exactly what regional pressures are tolerable for a given aquifer, however, needs to be determined on a site specific base...|$|E

The main objective is to enable the residential units (RUs) {{to decide on the}} fraction of their ES capacity that they want to share with the SFCs of the community in order to assist them storing electricity, e. g., for fulfilling the demand of various shared facilities. To this end, a modified auction-based mechanism is designed that captures the interaction between the SFCs and the RUs so as to determine the auction price and the allocation of ES shared by the RUs that governs the proposed joint ES ownership. The fraction of the capacity of the storage that each RU decides to put into the market to share with the SFCs and the auction price are determined by a noncooperative Stackelberg game formulated between the RUs and the auctioneer. It is shown that the proposed auction possesses the incentive compatibility and the individual rationality properties, which are leveraged via the unique Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) solution of the game.
