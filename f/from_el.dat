5|$|Coinciding {{with the}} National Hurricane Center's first {{advisory}} on Isis, {{the government of}} Mexico issued a tropical storm warning from Dolores to Puerto Cortés along the Baja California Peninsula. This helped some of the residents get an early start.Early on September 2, the warning was extended from Santa Rosalía to Punta Abreojos, while an additional tropical storm warning was issued <b>from</b> <b>El</b> Dorado to Guaymas. After Isis became a hurricane, officials issued a hurricane warning from Dolores to Punta San Gabriel on the Baja California Peninsula and <b>from</b> <b>El</b> Dorado to Bahía Kino on the mainland.|$|E

5|$|By {{the evening}} of 20 September, Chauvel's {{communications}} with his cavalry divisions, were limited to wireless and aircraft. The last aerial reconnaissance on 20 September reported three large fires burning at Nablus railway station, fires burning at the Balata dumps, and the whole Ottoman front line <b>from</b> <b>El</b> Lubban to the Jordan alarmed.

5|$|Chauvel's {{force had}} left El Arish the {{previous}} night, carrying one water bottle per man. Additional water was organised by Desert Column staff and sent <b>from</b> <b>El</b> Arish to Lahfan, and a water convoy from Lahfan, ordered {{to move to}} Magdhaba at 15:10 {{on the day of}} battle, was reported to be on its way at 15:20.|$|E
5|$|In Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, {{across the}} U.S. border <b>from</b> <b>El</b> Paso, Texas, {{rainfall}} from the storm's remnants flooded 20neighborhoods, downed power lines, {{and resulted in}} several traffic accidents.

5|$|The {{series of}} six well-situated and {{developed}} redoubts {{making up the}} strong Ottoman garrison position at Magdhaba reflected considerable planning; the redoubts were almost impossible to locate on the flat ground {{on both sides of}} the Wadi el Arish. Clearly, the move of the Ottoman garrison <b>from</b> <b>El</b> Arish had not been a sudden, panicked reaction; indeed it was first noticed by Allied aerial reconnaissance planes as early as 25 October.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} find a trading partner Bodeck was sent on a {{diplomatic}} mission <b>from</b> <b>Elbing</b> throughout Europe. During that time he wrote liber amicorum, which is now studied by musicologists. During his diplomatic tour Bodeck visited the Netherlands, France, Switzerland, and England, where he attended the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge. He attended the funeral ceremony for Queen Elizabeth I of England and the coronation of the new English king, James I. The council of Elbing had sent two delegates with dual missions: firstly, to pay its respects to the new king and secondly to oppose the transfer of English trade <b>from</b> <b>Elbing</b> to nearby Danzig.|$|R
50|$|Later {{that year}} Bodeck left for Paris and met Count Christopher von Dohna, a nobleman of Prussia, who lived 15 km <b>from</b> <b>Elbing.</b> Bodeck then became the {{chancellor}} to Elector Joachim Frederick of Brandenburg. He died in 1658.|$|R

5|$|Another novel {{aspect of}} the {{offensive}} used by the attackers, which was extensively commented upon by American journalist Timothy Turner who was observing the battle <b>from</b> <b>El</b> Paso, was the rotation of troops that the rebels employed. Rather than attacking en masse with the whole army, Villa and Orozco had their soldiers engage the enemy for a few hours, {{then go back to}} secure positions to sleep, while other rebels took their place. As a consequence the rebel troops were always rested while the less numerous defending federal troops were forced to remain sleepless and ever vigilant.|$|E

5|$|Four pilosity {{patterns}} (patterns of hair-like setae) {{are known}} to occur within Tatuidris collections. Pilosity pattern A consists of a mix of both long flexuous and short appressed setae. This {{is the most common}} pilosity pattern and the one that most resembles the type specimens <b>from</b> <b>El</b> Salvador and the gyne from Otongachi, Ecuador. Pilosity pattern B is characterized by very short, fully appressed, and regular spaced setae arrayed homogeneously and equidistantly on the head, mesosoma, petiole, postpetiole and gaster. Pilosity pattern C is characterized by dense lanose-looking setae. Pilosity pattern D consists of short and uniform decumbent (strongly inclined but not fully appressed) setae scattered throughout the body.|$|E
5|$|The 2nd Light Horse Brigade and Patiala Infantry, (Chaytor's Force) {{advanced}} on 20 September eastwards {{across the}} Jordan Valley toward the strongly entrenched Shunet Nimrin position, and Derbasi on the Ottoman left flank. The 6th Light Horse and 7th Light Horse Regiments, {{with a company}} of Patiala Infantry, were shelled by guns <b>from</b> <b>El</b> Haud {{in the foothills of}} Moab as they moved across the valley. Positions east of the Jordan River, including Mellaha, continued to be strongly held by Fourth Army units.|$|E
5|$|A {{road from}} Julian to Kane Springs was {{completed}} in 1925. Efforts to include this road extending to Brawley into the state highway system date back from 1927, {{in order to receive}} state funding for the road. Plans for a cross-country road through Borrego Springs were being discussed by county government officials in 1927, as there were no east–west state highways in between Mountain Springs and Riverside. Those living in Calipatria and Westmorland supported the prospect of the road to Julian being improved, and included in the state highway system. In 1928, state assembly member Myron Witter {{wrote a letter to the}} San Diego County Board of Supervisors to suggest that the highway be incorporated as a second entrance to the county from the east, and that it would not detract from the progress of the other highway <b>from</b> <b>El</b> Centro; however, the county wanted to prioritize the paving over the designation. Chambers of commerce in the Imperial Valley generally agreed with Witter, proposing that the El Centro–Calexico road be made a part of the state highway system, and the Kane Springs–Julian road be given second priority for inclusion.|$|E

5|$|Activity {{after the}} caldera's {{formation}} created lava domes and rhyolitic lava flows along its ring faults. One flow was dated at 1,090,000 ± 110,000 years old, and the domes are 1.4 to 1.2 million years old. La Reforma eruption products were later partially buried by activity <b>from</b> <b>El</b> Aguajito, where volcanic activity had migrated to. Basaltic cones which erupted 600,000 {{years ago on}} the caldera's flanks despite their location {{are not part of the}} La Reforma volcano; like Isla Tortuga and Tres Virgenes, they are controlled by the tectonic processes that accompanied the rifting of the Sea of Cortez. Also, rivers deposited sediments inside the caldera itself. Seismic activity still occurs at Tres Virgenes volcano. La Reforma could still experience large scale explosive volcanism, especially in its southwestern part.|$|E
5|$|All of {{the heads}} are realistic, unidealised and frank {{descriptions}} of the men. It is likely that they were portraits of living (or recently deceased) rulers well known to the sculptors. Each head is distinct and naturalistic, displaying individualised features. They were once thought to represent ballplayers although this theory is no longer widely held; it is possible, however, that they represent rulers equipped for the Mesoamerican ballgame. Facial expressions depicted on the heads vary from stern through placid to smiling. The most naturalistic Olmec art is the earliest, appearing suddenly without surviving antecedents, with a tendency towards more stylised sculpture as time progressed. Some surviving examples of wooden sculpture recovered <b>from</b> <b>El</b> Manatí demonstrate that the Olmecs {{are likely to have}} created many more perishable sculptures than works sculpted from stone.|$|E
5|$|In November 1909, Crowley and Neuburg {{travelled}} to Algeria, {{touring the}} desert <b>from</b> <b>El</b> Arba to Aumale, Bou Saâda, and then Dā'leh Addin, with Crowley reciting the Quran {{on a daily}} basis. During the trip he invoked the thirty aethyrs of Enochian magic, with Neuburg recording the results, later published in The Equinox as The Vision and the Voice. Following a mountaintop sex magic ritual, Crowley also performed an invocation to the demon Choronzon involving blood sacrifice, considering the results to be a watershed in his magical career. Returning to London in January 1910, Crowley found that Mathers was suing him for publishing Golden Dawn secrets in The Equinox; the court found in favour of Crowley. The case was widely reported in the press, with Crowley gaining wider fame. Crowley enjoyed this, and played up to the sensationalist stereotype of being a Satanist and advocate of human sacrifice, despite being neither.|$|E
