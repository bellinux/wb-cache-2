50|$|Biparental {{inheritance}} {{occurs in}} <b>extranuclear</b> <b>genes</b> when both parents contribute organellar DNA to the offspring. It {{may be less}} common than uniparental extranuclear inheritance, and usually occurs in a permissible species {{only a fraction of}} the time. An example of biparental mitochondrial inheritance is in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. When two haploid cells of opposite mating type fuse they can both contribute mitochondria to the resulting diploid offspring.|$|E
50|$|Uniparental {{inheritance}} {{occurs in}} <b>extranuclear</b> <b>genes</b> when only one parent contributes organellar DNA to the offspring. A {{classic example of}} uniparental gene transmission is the maternal inheritance of human mitochondria. The mother's mitochondria are transmitted to the offspring at fertilization via the egg. The father's mitochondrial genes are not transmitted to the offspring via the sperm. Very rare cases which require further investigation have been reported of paternal mitochondrial inheritance in humans, in which the father's mitochondrial genome is found in offspring. Chloroplast genes can also inherit uniparentally during sexual reproduction. They are historically thought to inherit maternally, but paternal inheritance in many species is increasingly being identified. The mechanisms of uniparental inheritance from species to species differ greatly and are quite complicated. For instance, chloroplasts {{have been found to}} exhibit maternal, paternal and biparental modes even within the same species.|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{evolutionary}} dynamics of <b>extranuclear</b> <b>genes</b> {{taking into account}} simple kinds of selection, two modes of inheritance and the multiplicity of genomes within a cell. Particular {{attention was paid to}} the accumulation of advantageous or deleterious mutations in an extranuclear genome. Within-generation drift due to multiplicity of genome and non-Mendelian segregation promotes the fixation of advantageous mutations and prevents deleterious mutations from accumulating. We show also that the extent of paternal contribution makes little difference in the rate, but, in contrast, the configuration of the genome and the mode of transmission both makes a large difference. These results are compatible with what is known about extranuclear genomes...|$|E
40|$|A ‘two locus two allele’ {{model is}} {{developed}} with special {{reference to the}} introgression of extranuclear genomes between two species of finite size. The model assumes that one locus, coded by a nuclear genome, causes the reproductive barrier while the other locus, coded by an extranuclear genome, causes nucleo-cytoplasmic incompatibility in particular genotypes. To fully study this model, simulations are conducted, and a diffusion equation is derived when introgression or <b>extranuclear</b> <b>gene</b> flow occurs in one direction. It is shown that although selection against the nuclear genome can reduce the levels of <b>extranuclear</b> <b>gene</b> flow and retard the introgression process, the dynamics {{are very similar to}} those without such selection. In contrast, the nucleo-cytoplasmic incompatibility directly affects the dynamics of introgressing extranuclear genomes: in large populations the ability of incompatibility to overcome <b>extranuclear</b> <b>gene</b> flow is conspicuous, but in small populations it is overshadowed by random sampling drift. Paternal leakage of extranuclear genomes, if present, is of evolutionary importance only when the male 2 ̆ 7 s migration rate is much larger than the female 2 ̆ 7 s. When the sizes of two populations are unequal, the introgression is most likely to occur from the larger population to the smaller one in the absence of mating preferences of backcross progeny. Recent observations on interspecific mitochondrial transfer in various species do not support the ubiquitousness of nucleo-cytoplasmic incompatibility as an efficient reproductive barrier...|$|R
40|$|Strains of {{the yeast}} Kluyveromyces lactis that produce killer-toxin {{have been found}} to contain two linear dsDNA plasmids, k 1 (8. 9 Kb) and k 2 (13. 4 Kb). The four {{transcribed}} open reading frames of plasmid k 1 contain no recognisable yeast nuclear expression signals. Moreover, a toxin subunit gene fused with the lacZ gene of Escherichia coli is not detectably expressed when introduced to K. lactis or Saccharomyces cerevisiae on a nuclear vector, even when native k 1 and k 2 are present in the cell. This and other evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that k 1 and k 2 reside in an extranuclear location, and do not utilise the nuclear RNA polymerases I, II or III for transcription of their genes. Sequencing of plasmid k 2, which is thought to encode factors necessary for the maintenance or expression of k 1, reveals an open reading frame predicted to encode a 974 amino acid polypeptide with homology to several DNA-directed RNA polymerases. We suggest that this is a component of a novel plasmid-specific <b>extranuclear</b> <b>gene</b> expression system...|$|R
50|$|While CMS is {{controlled}} by an <b>extranuclear</b> genome, nuclear <b>genes</b> may {{have the capability to}} restore fertility. When nuclear restoration of fertility genes (“Rf”) is available for a CMS system in any crop, it is cytoplasmic - genetic male sterility; the sterility is manifested by the influence of both nuclear (with Mendelian inheritance) and cytoplasmic (maternally inherited) genes. There are also restorers of fertility (Rf) genes that are distinct from genetic male sterility genes. The Rf genes have no expression of their own unless the sterile cytoplasm is present. Rf genes are required to restore fertility in S cytoplasm that causes sterility. Thus plants with N cytoplasm are fertile and S cytoplasm with genotype Rf- leads to fertiles while S cytoplasm with rfrf produces only male steriles. Another feature of these systems is that Rf mutations (i.e., mutations to rf or no fertility restoration) are frequent, so that N cytoplasm with Rfrf is best for stable fertility.|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} the genetic constitution of extranuclear or non-Mendelian genes, several formulas for {{the variance of}} linkage disequilibrium (nonrandom association of linked genes) were derived under the neutral mutation hypothesis. Two kinds of the variances are mainly considered. One is the variance for the entire population {{and the other is}} the variance within a single germ cell. At equilibrium, both variances differ from that of a Mendelian population with the same parameters. In particular, when the cytoplasmic contribution from a male gamete β is small, as is found in most organisms, the effect of recombination between <b>extranuclear</b> <b>genes</b> is weak because of low within-cell heterogeneity. Then, the total variance for the entire population is large. Other important quantitites determining the variances are the number of extranuclear genomes per cell, n, and the number of cell divisions in a germ cell line per generation, λ. Unless β = 0, even a small contribution from a male gamete becomes significant depending on n and λ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Open land, called cerrado, almost {{occupies}} one {{fourth of}} Brazilian territory and {{is characterized by}} acid soils with high aluminum saturation. The productivity of non-naturalized plants is reduced since growth of roots is greatly restrained. The use of aluminum-tolerant genotypes together with liming is a very promising strategy for the agricultural use of open land. Knowledge of inheritance mechanisms of aluminum-tolerance contributes towards obtaining of tolerant and productive genotypes. The aim {{of this research was}} to investigate the hypothesis of maternal effect on aluminum tolerance of maize inbred lines. Seedlings from six pairs of reciprocal crosses, produced by two tolerant and three non-tolerant inbred lines, were evaluated. Seminal root growth rates in presence of aluminum were similar among all progenies derived by reciprocal crosses. The results demonstrated the control of aluminum tolerance by dominant nuclear alleles in maize, without any detectable effect of <b>extranuclear</b> <b>genes.</b> Key words: aluminum-tolerance, maize, maternal effect.

40|$|SIRT 1 and PGC- 1 α are two {{nutrient}} sensing master regulators {{of cellular}} metabolism and their upregulation is often linked to increased lifespan. SIRT 1 and PGC- 1 α modulate {{the expression of}} a set of nuclear genes controlling many metabolic pathways. In recent years mounting evidence has indicated the implication of these proteins in several mitochondrial diseases including neurodegenerative disorders, myopathies and Type II diabetes mellitus. Recently, these proteins have been localized in cytoplasm and mitochondria wherein they target novel substrates opening new insight into their possible function in modulating <b>extranuclear</b> <b>genes</b> and proteins. This review will firstly summarize the nuclear function of SIRT 1 and PGC- 1 α. Then, data from papers demonstrating the presence of SIRT 1 and PGC- 1 α in the cytoplasm and in mitochondria will be outlined so that these extranuclear forms do not remain out of sight. Finally, very recent evidence of the alteration of the pathways governed by SIRT 1 and PGC- 1 α in human mitochondrial diseases will be described and the possible role of their mitochondrial forms will be briefly discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{mitochondrial}} DNA {{from the}} colourless alga Prototheca wickerhamii contains two mosaic genes as was revealed from complete sequencing of the circular <b>extranuclear</b> genome. The <b>genes</b> {{for the large}} subunit of the ribosomal RNA (LSUrRNA) {{as well as for}} subunit I of the cytochrome oxidase (coxI) carry two and three intronic sequences respectively. On the basis of their canonical nucleotide sequences they can be classified as group I introns. Phylogenetic comparisons of the coxI protein sequences allow us to conclude that the P. wickerhamii mtDNA is much closer related to higher plant mtDNAs than to those of the chlorophyte alga C. reinhardtii. The comparison of the intron sequences revealed several unusual features: (1) The P. wickerhamii introns are structurally related to mitochondrial introns from various ascomycetous fungi. (2) Phylogenetic analyses indicate a close relationship between fungal and algal intronic sequences. (3) The P. wickerhamii introns are located at positions within the structural genes which can be considered as preferred intron insertion sites in homologous mitochondrial genes from fungi or liverwort. In all cases, the sequences adjacent to the insertion sites are very well conserved over large evolutionary distances. Our finding of highly similar introns in fungi and algae is consistent with the idea that introns have already been present in the bacterial ancestors of present day mitochondria and evolved concomitantly with the organelles...|$|R
40|$|Although {{only about}} 3 {{years have passed}} since the {{preparation}} of the original manuscript of this book for the Russian edition, the number of successful experiments on somatic hybridization of higher plants has doubled. Although the main inferences of the first edition still remain in force, most of them have received conclusive experimental support and, moreover, some new con­ clusions have been drawn. It can be expected that these inferences and conclusions will constitute a more or less durable foundation for somatic cell genetics of higher plants. We thus hope this book will also remain useful over the next years, in spite of the rapid progress of experiments and {{the increase in the number}} of scientific reports in this field. Though it might appear strange to an uninvolved observer, the principal progress in hybridization of somatic cells of higher plants has been due to plant physiologists (who entered the field by elaborating methods and techniques for plant cell and, later, for isolated protoplast culture) rather than plant geneticists. However, further qualitative improvement in this field is inconceivable without the instillation of genetic ideology and the strict logic of genetic experiments. The main purpose ofthis book is the attempt to organize the available experimental data in terms and cate­ gories of genetic analysis. For this reason, this book lays no claim on being a comprehensive treatise on somatic hybridization. 1 Introduction. - 2 Techniques of Parasexual Hybridization. - 2. 1 Culture Techniques. - 2. 1. 1 Culture of Isolated Plant Protoplasts. - 2. 1. 2 Culture of Single Cells and Protoplasts. - 2. 2 Isolated Protoplast Stage and Plant Cell Engineering. - 2. 2. 1 Protoplast Fusion. - 2. 2. 2 Cell Reconstruction Involving Fusion of Subprotoplasts. - 2. 2. 3 Cell Modification Through Uptake of Isolated Cell Organelles by Plant Protoplasts. - 2. 3 Problems of Genetic Variability. - 2. 3. 1 Genetic Variability Associated with in Vitro Manipulation of Plant Cells. - 2. 3. 2 Genetic Changes in Cells Induced During the Stage of Isolated Protoplasts. - 3 Protoplast Fusion and Parasexual Hybridization of Higher Plants. - 3. 1 Perspectives. - 3. 1. 1 Terminology. - 3. 1. 2 History of Parasexual Hybridization of Higher Plants. - 3. 2 Methods of Screening for Parasexual Hybrids. - 3. 2. 1 Introduction. - 3. 2. 2 Genetic Complementation. - 3. 2. 3 Physiological Complementation. - 3. 2. 4 Restoration of Growth Capacity in Hybrids Upon Fusion of Inactivated Cells. - 3. 2. 5 Mechanical Isolation. - 3. 2. 6 Physical Enrichment. - 3. 3 Frequency of Formation of Parasexual Hybrids. - 3. 4 Protoplast Fusion and the Bypassing of Sexual Barriers. - 3. 5 Analysis of the Parasexual Hybridization Process and the Genetic Composition of Plant Forms Arising from Protoplast Fusion. - 3. 5. 1 General Guidelines. - 3. 5. 2 Genetic Methods of Analysis. - 3. 5. 2. 1 Hybrid Crosses. - 3. 5. 2. 2 Cloning. - 3. 5. 2. 3 Cytogenetic Studies. - 3. 5. 2. 4 Cytophotometric Measurement of Nuclear DNA Content. - 3. 5. 3 Biochemical Analysis. - 3. 5. 3. 1 Multiple Molecular Forms of Enzymes. - 3. 5. 3. 2 Analysis of Fraction I Protein. - 3. 5. 3. 3 Restriction Endonuclease Analysis of Chloroplast and Mitochondrial DNA. - 3. 5. 3. 4 Molecular Hybridization of Nucleic Acids. - 3. 5. 3. 5 Analysis of Low Molecular Weight Substances. - 4 Transmission Genetics of Parasexual Hybridization in Closely Related Crosses. - 4. 1 General Considerations. - 4. 1. 1 Perspectives and Philosophy of Analysis of Transmission Genetics. - 4. 1. 2 Initial Experiments on Transmission Genetics of Parasexual Hybrids. - 4. 1. 3 Hybridization of More Than Two Parental Cells. - 4. 2 Fate of Extranuclear Genetic Determinants. - 4. 2. 1 Perspectives. - 4. 2. 2 Protoplast Fusion and the Formation of Cytoplasmic Heterozygotes. - 4. 2. 3 Mitotic Segregation of Plasmagenes and the Sorting Out of Parental Genotypes. - 4. 2. 4 Recombination of Plasmagenes. - 4. 3 Fate of Nuclear Genes in the Process of Somatic Hybridization. - 4. 3. 1 Segregation of Nuclei. - 4. 3. 2 Chromosome Sets of Hybrid Cells. - 4. 4 Transmission Genetics in Hybridization Systems Utilizing Parental Cell Inactivation. - 4. 4. 1 Consideration of Animal and Bacterial Systems. - 4. 4. 2 Treatment with Iodoacetate. - 4. 4. 3 Irradiation. - 4. 5 Genetic Diversity of Hybrid Plants Obtained by Protoplast Fusion. - 5 Protoplast Fusion and Hybridization of Distantly Related Plant Species. - 5. 1 Introduction. - 5. 2 Initial Stages of Culture of Hybrid Cells of Distantly Related Plant Species. - 5. 3 Interfamily Cell Hybrids of Higher Plants. - 5. 4 Intertribal Hybrids of Higher Plants. - 5. 4. 1 Hybridization of Cruciferae Species. - 5. 4. 2 Hybridization of Distantly Related Members of the Solanaceae and Other Families. - 5. 4. 3 General Conclusions of Results Obtained with Intertribal Hybrids of Higher Plants. - 5. 5 Intergeneric Hybrids. - 5. 6 Influence of Physical and Chemical Factors on the Fate of Genetic Material in Distantly Related Species Combinations. - 5. 6. 1 Introduction. - 5. 6. 2 Irradiation and the Induction of Genetic Asymmetry. - 5. 6. 3 Induction of Mitotic Chromosome Segregation by Chemical Agents. - 6 Use of Somatic Hybridization. - 6. 1 Genetic Analysis Using Parasexual Hybridization. - 6. 1. 1 Introduction and Perspective. - 6. 1. 2 Analysis of the Nature of Inherited Traits. - 6. 1. 3 Analysis of Nuclear Genes. - 6. 1. 3. 1 Resistance to 5 -Methyltryptophan. - 6. 1. 3. 2 Resistance to S-(2 -Aminoethyl) -L-Cysteine. - 6. 1. 3. 3 Resistance to Cycloheximide. - 6. 1. 3. 4 Resistance to Azetidine- 2 -Carboxylate. - 6. 1. 3. 5 Additional Complementation Studies. - 6. 1. 4 Cosegregation of <b>Extranuclear</b> <b>Genes.</b> - 6. 1. 5 Analysis of Mitotic Cycle Mechanisms. - 6. 1. 6 Analysis of the Mechanisms of Differentiation and Morphogenesis. - 6. 2 Practical Use of Somatic Cell Hybridization. - 6. 2. 1 Introduction. - 6. 2. 2 Bypassing of Incompatibility in Interspecific Hybridization. - 6. 2. 3 Reconstruction of Cytoplasmic Genomes. - 6. 2. 4 Transfer of Cytoplasmic Genomes and Cytoplasmic Male Sterility. - 7 Conclusion. - References...|$|E
