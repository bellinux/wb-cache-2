5|$|The Moon and {{the planets}} are Yin; they have shape but no light. This they receive {{only when the}} Sun <b>illuminates</b> them. The former masters {{regarded}} the Sun as round like a crossbow bullet, and they thought the Moon had {{the nature of a}} mirror. Some of them recognized the Moon as a ball too. Those parts of the Moon which the Sun <b>illuminates</b> look bright, those parts which it does not, remain dark.|$|E

These areas are described in turn below.|$|E
5|$|Portrait of a Lady (or Portrait of a Woman) {{is a small}} oil-on-oak panel {{painting}} executed around 1460 by the Netherlandish painter Rogier van der Weyden. The {{composition is}} built from the geometric shapes that form {{the lines of the}} woman's veil, neckline, face, and arms, and by the fall of the light that <b>illuminates</b> her face and headdress. The vivid contrasts of darkness and light enhance the almost unnatural beauty and Gothic elegance of the model.|$|E

5|$|R Coronae Australis is an {{irregular}} variable star ranging from magnitudes 9.7 to 13.9. Blue-white, {{it is of}} spectral type B5IIIpe. A very young star, it is still accumulating interstellar material. It is obscured by, and <b>illuminates,</b> the surrounding nebula, NGC 6729, which brightens and darkens with it. The nebula is often compared to a comet for its appearance in a telescope, as its length is five times its width. S Coronae Australis is a G-class dwarf in the same field as R and is a T Tauri star. Nearby, another young variable star, TY Coronae Australis, <b>illuminates</b> another nebula: reflection nebula NGC 6726–7. TY Coronae Australis ranges irregularly between magnitudes 8.7 and 12.4, and {{the brightness of the}} nebula varies with it. Blue-white, it is of spectral type B8e. The largest young stars in the region, R, S, T, TY and VV Coronae Australis, are all ejecting jets of material which cause surrounding dust and gas to coalesce and form Herbig–Haro objects, many of which have been identified nearby. Lying adjacent to the nebulosity is the globular cluster known as NGC 6723, which is actually in the neighbouring constellation of Sagittarius and is much much further away.|$|E
5|$|The Eye's {{importance}} {{extends to}} the afterlife as well. Egyptian funerary texts associate deceased souls with Ra in his nightly travels through the Duat, {{the realm of the}} dead, and with his rebirth at dawn. In these texts the Eye and its various manifestations often appear, protecting and giving birth to the deceased as they do for Ra. A spell in the Coffin Texts states that Bastet, as the Eye, <b>illuminates</b> the Duat like a torch, allowing the deceased to pass safely through its depths.|$|E
5|$|The east face of {{the eastern}} wing has four bays with canted bay windows, shaped end gables and a central cartouche. In {{the centre of the}} {{northern}} (garden) face is a large bow window, originally Jacobean, which <b>illuminates</b> the chapel; it has stone panels decorated with cartouches below arched stained glass lights. This face otherwise reverses the main façade, with the addition of mezzanine windows.|$|E

5|$|The gatehouse's eastwards-facing tower {{contains}} the chapel, an unusual arrangement {{driven by a}} lack of space, with a recently restored east window of reset 15th-century glass designed by Nicola Hopwood, which <b>illuminates</b> the priest's seat, or sedile. The 15th-century window frame itself replaced an even taller, earlier 13th-century window. The chapel's west window is modern, and commemorates British servicemen who died between 1936–76 in radar development. The altar itself is particularly old, possibly pre-dating the castle.|$|E
5|$|Dark Forces {{gameplay}} expands on the FPS {{standards set}} by Doom in 1993, and features gameplay elements that are now common in the FPS genre. These include the ability to look up and down, duck, and jump. A variety of power-ups are {{made available to the}} player, including health, shields, weapons and ammunition. The game also features several non-combat items to aid the player. The head lamp <b>illuminates</b> the area in front of the player, but will reveal the player's position to enemies in dark rooms. Ice cleats provide traction in icy areas, and an air mask protects the player from areas with toxic atmosphere. Many inventory items are powered by batteries (separate from weapon ammunition types) which can be found around the levels.|$|E
5|$|Le Père Goriot, {{especially}} in its revised form, marks an important early instance of Balzac's trademark use of recurring characters: persons from earlier novels appear in later works, usually during significantly {{different times of}} life. Pleased with the effect he achieved {{with the return of}} Rastignac, Balzac included 23 characters in the first edition of Le Père Goriot that would recur in later works; during his revisions for later editions the number increased to 48. Although Balzac had used this technique before, the characters had always reappeared in minor roles, as nearly identical versions of the same people. Rastignac's appearance shows, {{for the first time in}} Balzac's fiction, a novel-length backstory that <b>illuminates</b> and develops a returning character.|$|E
40|$|Shadowed {{contour lines}} vary line width. <b>Illuminated</b> contour lines {{additionally}} vary color {{based on an}} angle of illumination. <b>Illuminated</b> and shadowed contour lines {{date back to the}} midnineteenth century, but their effectiveness compared to conventional contour lines has not been fully examined. Currently, <b>illuminated</b> and shadowed contour lines are not widely used in computer-based cartography because they are not included in most GIS apmaking software. This article introduces improvements to existing algorithms for creating <b>illuminated</b> and shadowed contour lines from digital elevation data. A software package is made available to allow mapmakers to more easily make customized <b>illuminated</b> and shadowed contour maps. A user study comparing <b>illuminated</b> and shadowed contour lines to conventional contour lines and shaded relief with approximately 400 participants was conducted. Results indicate that map-readers can interpret relative height differences between points better and quicker with <b>illuminated</b> contour lines than regular contour lines or shaded relief. Study participants were able to select absolute maxima on an unlabeled <b>illuminated</b> contour map and a labeled regular contour map with equal accuracy and speed. These findings suggest that <b>illuminated</b> contour lines could be used more frequently for improved visualization of terrain and other surface data on maps...|$|R

Plasma forms an impassable wall that no unit can cross, and is generated by Meteors. Once a Meteor is destroyed, any Plasma in contact with it disappears, allowing units to pass. Plasma that is not in contact with a meteor cannot be destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The divine {{represented}} by light is a motif {{in keeping with}} the sentiment of both the Latin text on the hem of Mary's dress (which compares her beauty and radiance to that of divine light) and on the frame. A separate source of light, which also behaves as if from a divine rather than natural source, <b>illuminates</b> her face. The two pools of light behind her have been described as lending the painting a mystical atmosphere, indicating the presence of God. In the niche behind her, the statues are lit by two candles - symbols of the incarnation, whereas she is bathed in natural light. The artificial light adds to the overall illusion of the interior of the church, which Pächt views as achieved mainly through colour.|$|E

(Units sold in South Korea and later revisions do not support GameCube discs.) The blue light in the disc slot <b>illuminates</b> briefly when the console is turned on, and pulses when new data is received through WiiConnect24. After the update (including System Menu 3.0), the disc-slot light activates whenever a Wii disc is inserted or ejected. When there is no WiiConnect24 information, the light stays off. The disc-slot light remains off during game play or when using other features. Two USB ports are located at its rear. An SD-card slot is located behind the cover on the {{front of the}} console.|$|E

5|$|With two exceptions, the naves {{and eastern}} {{arms of the}} cathedrals have single lower aisles on either side with a {{clerestory}} that <b>illuminates</b> the central space. At Bristol the aisles are {{at the same height}} as the medieval choir like some German cathedrals, and at Chichester there are two aisles {{on either side of the}} nave like some French cathedrals. At a number of the cathedrals where the transepts are large they also have aisles, either on the eastern side as at Peterborough, Durham, Lincoln and Salisbury or both, as at Winchester, Wells, Ely and York.|$|E
5|$|Depth and {{dimension}} are rendered {{by the use}} {{of linear}} perspective, by the overlapping of the layers of shapes, and in particular, as stated by Clark, through the use of tone. This compositional element operates within the picture in a number of ways. First, there is the appearance of natural light within the painted room and beyond it. The pictorial space in the midground and foreground is lit from two sources: by thin shafts of light from the open door, and by broad streams coming through the window to the right. The 20th-century French philosopher and cultural critic Michel Foucault observed that the light from the window <b>illuminates</b> both the studio foreground and the unrepresented area in front of it, in which the king, the queen, and the viewer are presumed to be situated. For José Ortega y Gasset, light divides the scene into three distinct parts, with foreground and background planes strongly illuminated, between which a darkened intermediate space includes silhouetted figures.|$|E

5|$|Temples {{were built}} {{throughout}} Upper and Lower Egypt, {{as well as}} at Egyptian-controlled oases in the Libyan Desert as far west as Siwa, and at outposts in the Sinai Peninsula such as Timna. In periods when Egypt dominated Nubia, Egyptian rulers also built temples there, as far south as Jebel Barkal. Most Egyptian towns had a temple, but in some cases, as with mortuary temples or the temples in Nubia, the temple was a new foundation on previously empty land. The exact site of a temple was often chosen for religious reasons; it might, for example, be the mythical birthplace or burial place of a god. The temple axis might also be designed to align with locations of religious significance, such as the site of a neighboring temple or the rising place of the sun or particular stars. The Great Temple of Abu Simbel, for instance, is aligned so that twice a year the rising sun <b>illuminates</b> the statues of the gods in its innermost room. Most temples were aligned toward the Nile with an axis running roughly east–west.|$|E
5|$|The oceans {{are home}} to a diverse {{collection}} of life forms that {{use it as a}} habitat. Since sunlight <b>illuminates</b> only the upper layers, the major part of the ocean exists in permanent darkness. As the different depth and temperature zones each provide habitat for a unique set of species, the marine environment as a whole encompasses an immense diversity of life. Marine habitats range from surface water to the deepest oceanic trenches, including coral reefs, kelp forests, seagrass meadows, tidepools, muddy, sandy and rocky seabeds, and the open pelagic zone. The organisms living in the sea range from whales 30 meters (100ft) long to microscopic phytoplankton and zooplankton, fungi, bacteria and viruses, including recently discovered marine bacteriophages which live parasitically inside bacteria. Marine life plays an important part in the carbon cycle as photosynthetic organisms convert dissolved carbon dioxide into organic carbon and it is economically important to humans for providing fish for use as food.|$|E
5|$|The second {{generation}} Mac Pro has a redesigned configuration of ports.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 9 - 10) This {{study was}} designed to compare the <b>illuminated</b> surface areas of HID and tungstenhalogen low-beam headlamps in the U. S. A sample of 20 tungsten-halogen lamps and 17 HID lamps for model year 2000 vehicles in the U. S. was examined. The <b>illuminated</b> surface area was determined using a modified version of an ECE method for evaluating the <b>illuminated</b> surface of signaling devices. The main finding is that the HID low beams generally have smaller <b>illuminated</b> surface areas than do the tungsten-halogen low beams. Because smaller light sources result in more discomfort glare (presumably via greater luminance), the present finding suggests that the smaller <b>illuminated</b> area is one reason for drivers reporting more discomfort from HID lamps. An implication is that the increased discomfort from HID lamps could be reduced by increasing their <b>illuminated</b> surface area...|$|R
