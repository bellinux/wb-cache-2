30|$|A {{predominant}} morphological {{style of}} the surface rupture was a near-vertical free face of thick unconsolidated sediments and/or soil units involving a tensile (opening) component of up to ~ 1  m and occasionally with a colluvial wedge present. Tilted trees and meter-scale local landslides triggered by fault slip were commonly observed along the rupture zone. Since most of the surface breaks are located on steep slopes in the deep forest and ranches (Fig.  4), we measured vertical offsets using a measuring tape, folding ruler, leveling staff and/or <b>hand-level,</b> which includes approximately ± 10 -cm measurement errors. At key locations, we measured vertical separation by taking surface profile using a laser distance meter (Laser Technology TruPulse 200 X) and a target prism that gives a measurement accuracy of ± 4  cm. There were few observations of man-made features as piercing points, and hence, we could not measure the amount of slip more accurately, in particular lateral slip. The maximum vertical slip of ~ 2.0  m was measured at a 6.7 -km mark (Fig.  3), gradually tapering toward the west and east (Fig.  3 b). But it is comprised of several triangle slip distributions corresponding to several subsections. The throw averages 0.7  m, approximately equivalent to the average right-lateral slip in the strike-slip zone.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} image display location on endoscopic task performance in endoscopic surgery. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The image display system is the only visual interface between the surgeon or interventionist and the operative field. Several factors influence the correct perceptual processing and endoscopic manipulation from images. One of these is location of the image display {{with respect to the}} surgeon and to the operative site. The present study was conducted to investigate whether endoscopic task performance improves under two conditions: when the surgeon-to-monitor visual axis is aligned with the forearm-instrument motor axis and when the image display is close to the operator's manipulation workspace. METHODS: An endoscopic task (tying an intracorporeal surgeon's knot) was performed under standardized conditions except for varying monitor locations. These altered the direction of view [...] in front of, to the left, and {{to the right of the}} operator's head and hands. In each of these view directions, the monitor was placed at the surgeon's eye level and lower down, at the level of the operator's hands. The outcome measures were the execution time, knot quality score and performance quality score. RESULTS: Task performance was better with frontal view direction: execution time was shorter (p < 0. 0001) and the performance score was higher (p < 0. 005) than with side viewing, with no significant difference between right and left viewing directions. With frontal view direction, <b>hand-level</b> "gaze-down" viewing resulted in a shorter execution time (p < 0. 01) and a higher performance score (p < 0. 01) than eye-level viewing. CONCLUSIONS: Task performance improves when the image display is placed in front of the operator, at a level below the head and close to the hands...|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} old monuments of the Nankaido tsunamis of Hoei (Oct. 28, 1707) and the 2 nd Ansei (Dec. 24, 1854) along the Osaka and Wakayama coasts, Western Japan. Most of these monuments were built {{just after the}} {{earthquakes}} to pray for the repose of the tsunami victims or to sound a warning to inhabitants. In this paper, the tsunami monuments are illustrated. Based on descriptions on the monuments, adding new data collected from the present field investigation, inundation heights of the 1707 Hoei and 1854 Ansei tsunamis along the Wakayama coast are surveyed by <b>hand-level.</b> Behaviors (inundation height and area) of the two historical tsunamis are {{compared with those of}} the 1946 Nankaido tsunami (Dec. 21, 1946). Inundation heights of the 1854 Ansei tsunami along the Wakayama coast, {{the west side of the}} Kii Peninsula, are 4. 8 meters on the average and are 1. 2 times as large as those of the 1946 Nankaido tsunami. The estimated heights of the 1707 Hoei tsunami are 5 meters with the localized run-up maximum of 6 to 7 meters. Along the Wakayama coast, the patterns of height distribution of the two historical tsunamis are similar to that of the 1946 Nankaido tsunami. However, the inundation heights of the 1707 Hoei and 1854 Ansei tsunamis along the coast in Osaka Bay are three times as large as those of the 1946 tsunami. Osaka suffered severe damage and many persons were drowned by the two tsunamis of 1707 and 1854. Estimated heights were about 3 meters. It suggests that the wave periods of the two historical tsunamis were longer than those of the 1946 tsunami. Although the source dimensions of the two historical tsunamis are similar to the 1946 tsunami (The source areas of three tsunamis extend 250 km along the Nankai trough), the rise times of crustal deformation for the two historical earthquakes differ significantly from the 1946 earthquake...|$|E
