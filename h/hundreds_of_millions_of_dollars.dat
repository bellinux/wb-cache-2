The most serious damage would be due to rains rather than winds or storm surge, although distant hurricanes may still create heavy surf, possibly injuring or killing people. Nora caused millions in damage and skirted extreme southeastern California.|$|E

In 2005, Primedia redeemed KKR's preferred stock in the company but KKR was estimated to have lost <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> on its common stock holdings {{as the price of}} the company's stock collapsed.|$|E

As of now, massive evidence of the dam's construction still remain in the North Fork American River canyon, specifically the excavations for the abutments and spillway, with the consequences of increased erosion.|$|E
5|$|Zimbabwe {{maintained}} positive {{economic growth}} throughout the 1980s (5% GDP growth per year) and 1990s (4.3% GDP growth per year). The economy declined from 2000: 5% decline in 2000, 8% in 2001, 12% in 2002 and 18% in 2003. Zimbabwe's involvement from 1998 to 2002 {{in the war}} in the Democratic Republic of the Congo drained <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> from the economy. From 1999–2009, Zimbabwe saw the lowest ever economic growth with an annual GDP decrease of 6.1%.|$|E

5|$|South Dakota summers bring {{frequent}} thunderstorms {{which can}} be severe with high winds, thunder, and hail. The {{eastern part of the}} state is often considered part of tornado alley, and South Dakota experiences an average of 29 tornadoes per year. Winters are somewhat more stable, although severe weather in the form of blizzards and ice storms can occur during the season. Severe weather in the state can occasionally turn deadly. Between 1950 and 1994, 11 people were killed by tornadoes in the state, and the 1972 Black Hills flood tore through central Rapid City, killing 238 people and causing <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> in damage.|$|E
5|$|The 1997 Pacific {{hurricane}} season {{was a very}} active {{hurricane season}}. With hundreds of deaths and <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> in damage, this season {{was one of the}} costliest and deadliest Pacific hurricane seasons. This was due to the exceptionally strong 1997–98 El Niño event. The 1997 Pacific hurricane season officially started on May 15, 1997, in the eastern Pacific, and on June 1, 1997, in the central Pacific, and lasted until November 30, 1997. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when almost all tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Rosa was {{the only}} Pacific {{hurricane}} to make landfall during the above-average 1994 Pacific hurricane season. It killed at least 4 people in Mexico. Moisture from the hurricane {{was a factor in}} widespread flooding in the U.S. state of Texas that killed 22 people and caused <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> in damage in October 1994. The pre-Rosa tropical depression formed on October 8 before degenerating the next day. It reformed on October 10 and steadily strengthened as it approached Mexico. Ultimately peaking as a Category2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale right before landfall, Rosa was the final hurricane, nineteenth tropical storm, and second-last tropical cyclone of the 1994 Pacific hurricane season.|$|E

On October 31, 2011, trading was halted on shares of MF Global prior to the market opening, and soon thereafter MF Global announced that it had declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Shortly afterwards, federal regulators began an investigation into <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> in missing customer funds. Corzine resigned as CEO on November 4, 2011, after having retained the services of defense attorney Andrew J. Levander. It was reported that Corzine declined a severance package worth $12.1 million. MF Global's collapse {{was one of the}} ten biggest bankruptcies in U.S. history.|$|E
5|$|The flood had {{a massive}} effect on Fairbanks. Four people were killed, {{and the damage}} ran into the <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars.</b> It helped push the city's {{remaining}} farm, Creamer's Dairy, into bankruptcy, and it forced the closure of St. Joseph's Hospital. Fairbanks residents responded to the problems with aplomb. The annual Tanana Valley State Fair was postponed but not canceled. Seven thousand dollars were raised to buy Creamer's Dairy {{and turn it into}} a bird sanctuary. KTVF, one of the few town businesses to have flood insurance, rebuilt its studio and became the first Fairbanks TV station to broadcast in color, four months after the flood. When two bond measures to build a government-run hospital were turned down by Fairbanks voters, residents raised $2.6 million from private contributions and $6 million from the state and federal government to build Fairbanks Memorial Hospital.|$|E
5|$|The {{tracks of}} this station {{continue}} {{south of the}} station, down to 25th Street, to allow trains to be stored south of the station during off-peak hours; the tail tracks are seven blocks long, enough to store two 11-car trains each, since the delivery of the R188 train cars was to add 66 more cars to the fleet of the 7 service. There are also two diamond crossovers, one north and one south of the station. The storage tracks at this location were constructed due to the Corona Yard in Queens lacking any space to hold any more trains, and expanding the yard is very difficult due to its location next to the Flushing River. A new storage yard elsewhere would be prohibitively expensive, as it would cost <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1963 and 1964 the Egyptians {{had five}} squadrons of {{aircraft}} in Yemen at airfields near San'a and Hodeida. They were using Yak-11 piston-engined fighters, MiG-15 and MiG-17 jet fighters, Ilyushin Il-28 twin-engined bombers, Ilyushin Il-14 twin-engined transports and Mil Mi-4 transport helicopters. They were also flying four-engined Tupolev bombers from bases in Egypt, such as Aswan. All the air crew were Egyptian, {{except for the}} Tupolev bombers which were thought to have mixed Egyptian and Russian personnel. The Ilyushin transports flying between Egypt and Hodeida had Russian crews. Throughout the war, the Egyptians relied on airlift. In January 1964, when royalist forces placed San'a under siege, Egyptian Antonov heavy-lift cargo planes airlifted tons of food and kerosene into the region. The Egyptians estimate that <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> were spent to equip Egyptian and republican Yemeni forces, and in addition, Moscow refurbished the Al-Rawda Airfield outside San'a. The politburo saw a chance to gain a toehold on the Arabian Peninsula and accepted hundreds of Egyptian officers to be trained as pilots for service in the Yemen War.|$|E
