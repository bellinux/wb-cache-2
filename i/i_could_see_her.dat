25|$|So I {{turned around}} and there's this {{beautiful}} Indian woman walking up; a Native American. She said 'Are you Glen Keane? The animator that's going to do Pocahontas?' I said 'Well, yeah.' And then from behind another tree another woman came up and she said, 'Well, my name is Shirley Little Dove, {{and this is my}} sister Devi White Dove, and we are descended from Pocahontas.' And as they stood there, I mean I took a picture of both of them, and between their faces was Pocahontas' face in my mind â€“ <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
60|$|She came nearer: <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> shadow {{through my}} fingers; then {{her face and}} wistful, {{compassionate}} eyes.|$|E
60|$|Lady Malvern {{looked at}} Jeeves, then at me, then at Jeeves again. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> {{struggling}} with the thing.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> by <b>her</b> {{manner that}} {{something}} had agitated or frightened her.|$|R
60|$|Grace turned pale, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>her</b> sweet countenance became {{thoughtful}} and repentant.|$|R
60|$|We {{were with}} our {{backs to the}} light, so that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>her</b> face.|$|R
60|$|She went on {{painting}} in silence. From where I stood <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> profile. Her chin was tilted. Her expression was determined.|$|E
6000|$|He {{knew from}} her voice {{that this was}} final. The {{irrelevant}} thought flashed through him: 'Well, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> there.' But he said: ...|$|E
60|$|I {{was better}} {{used to the}} dim light now. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> hollow eyes fixed upon me. I could see how {{emaciated}} she was.|$|E
6000|$|... "Them roses put {{me so much}} in mind {{of little}} Joscelyn," [...] she said softly. [...] "She loved them so. If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only <b>see</b> <b>her!</b> Oh, Jordan, if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only <b>see</b> <b>her!</b> Maria says it's terrible childish to be always harping on that string, and mebbe it is. But--oh, Jordan, there's such a hunger in my heart for her, such a hunger!" ...|$|R
60|$|Miss Havisham sat {{listening}} (or {{it seemed}} so, for <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>her</b> face), but still made no answer.|$|R
60|$|Aunt Philippa {{looked so}} determinedly grim that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> almost <b>see</b> <b>her</b> with a spade in her hand. I laughed aloud {{at the picture}} summoned up.|$|R
60|$|My dearie stood {{straight}} up and the trembling left her. She stepped back, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> face, white as the dead, but calm and resolved.|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{no longer}} any {{question}} about it. She avoids me. She continually excuses herself. If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her,</b> if I could speak to her only a moment--but this suspense--" ...|$|E
6000|$|We stood {{so close}} {{to each other in the}} dark {{anteroom}} that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> biting her lower lip to suppress a dry sob. After a short pause she said-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No lad, it {{was when}} she spoke of you comin' back; but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>her</b> good spirits was partly put on {{to keep up the}} old woman." ...|$|R
6000|$|As <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>her</b> face, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not {{determine}} what answer I should make to this remark, and she continued, {{as she turned}} over the sheets:-- ...|$|R
60|$|The {{old woman}} looked at Marble intently. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> by <b>her</b> countenance that the off-hand, sincere, earnest {{manner of the}} mate had taken some unusual hold of her feelings.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I know that," [...] said Tedham. [...] "That is {{the reason}} why I should like to see Mrs. March. I believe that if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her,</b> I could {{convince}} her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, me! how can I {{ever get}} on without Phebe? Couldn't she stay, just so <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her?</b> I'd pay her board {{rather than have}} her go, I'm so fond of her." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{could hear}} a gown-skirt {{rustling}} [...] Before <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> shape, Rustling through the heather [...] That wove the common's drape, On that evening of dark weather [...] When I hearkened, lips agape.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good-bye," [...] {{answered}} Maqueda in a brave voice; <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>her</b> {{face in the}} darkness. [...] "Presently, I am sure, {{you will}} return with your brother." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why?" [...] I asked, turning cold in my limbs, for {{although}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>her</b> face {{because of}} a hood she wore, now I began to be afraid.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, ma'am," [...] said she; but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> by <b>her</b> {{face that}} she didn't believe luggage would be luggage unless you could lug it, but was too respectful to say so.|$|R
60|$|We {{sat down}} on a bench in a retired par t of the Gardens, near a little fountain. A row of lighted lamps ran round the outer rim of the basin. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> plainly.|$|E
6000|$|To die--that {{does not}} disturb me; we {{of the service}} never care for death. But if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> once more! if I could hear her bugle sing again and say, [...] "It is I, Soldier--come!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And she him," [...] I added; [...] "look how {{she leans}} her head towards {{him as if}} she were conversing confidentially; I wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> face; I have never had a glimpse of it yet." ...|$|E
6000|$|Non. But my child's dishonour {{troubles}} me the most. If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> but <b>see</b> <b>her</b> well married, before I underwent {{the labour}} and peril of child-bearing!--What would you advise, niece? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What do {{you think}} of his condition?" [...] she asked me, after the second day was over. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> by <b>her</b> own grave face that she had already formed her own conclusions.|$|R
60|$|Then, from {{a little}} doorway in the {{opposite}} end of the structure, a girl was led into the arena. She was at a considerable distance from me. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>her</b> features.|$|R
60|$|Etienne began {{it after}} supper. Miss Adams had {{suddenly}} displayed a lively {{interest in the}} kitchen layout and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> in there, chatting brightly at George--not with him--the while he ducked his head and rattled his pans.|$|E
60|$|He {{gave her}} one awful shake, dropped his hands, then raised them {{as though to}} strike her. She {{looked him in the}} eyes; his hands dropped, and he too groaned. As far as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> <b>her</b> face never moved.|$|E
60|$|I did {{not disturb}} her. The minutes passed, the light waned until <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> no longer, and yet I {{knew that she}} had not moved. The strange sympathy between us kept me silent until I heard her voice calling my name.|$|E
60|$|She {{spoke quietly}} {{and looked at}} the {{wilderness}} of sand and mist with steady, thoughtful eyes. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>her</b> mind was too much occupied to feel the dreary impressions from without which had fastened themselves already on mine.|$|R
60|$|We three {{sat there}} and talked {{for half an hour}} or so. Then Chloe looked out yearningly and almost piteously across the ocean. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> in <b>her</b> sea-blue eyes some deep and intense desire. Devoe, curse him! saw it too.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, you met Madeline at Cannes, did you? By Jove, Bertie," [...] {{said the}} poor lizard devoutly, [...] "I wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> at Cannes. How {{wonderful}} {{she must have}} looked in beach pyjamas! Oh, Bertie----" ...|$|R
