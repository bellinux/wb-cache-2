50|$|Classical Isosteres are {{molecules}} or ions {{with the}} similar shape and often electronic properties. Many definitions are available. but {{the term is}} usually employed {{in the context of}} bioactivity and drug development. Such biologically-active compounds containing an <b>isostere</b> is called a bioisostere. This is frequently used in drug design: the bioisostere will still be recognized and accepted by the body, but its functions there will be altered as compared to the parent molecule.|$|E
50|$|The <b>isostere</b> {{concept was}} {{formulated}} by Irving Langmuir in 1919, and later modified by Grimm. Hans Erlenmeyer extended the concept to biological systems in 1932. Classical isosteres {{are defined as}} being atoms, ions and molecules that had identical outer shells of electrons, This definition has now been broadened to include groups that produce compounds that can sometimes have similar biological activities. Some evidence for the validity of this notion was the observation that some pairs, such as benzene and thiophene, thiophene and furan, and even benzene and pyridine, exhibited similarities in many physical and chemical properties.|$|E
50|$|Keto-ACE {{was used}} {{as the basis for the}} design of ketomethylene derivates. Its analogues contain a ketomethylene <b>isostere</b> {{replacement}} at the scissile bond that is believed to mimic the tetrahedron transition state of the proteolytic reaction at the active site. The focus was on a simple tripeptide Phe-Ala-Pro, which in earlier enzyme assays has shown inhibition activity. Replacement of alanine with glycin gave a tripeptide with 1/14th of the inhibition activity of Phe-Ala-Pro. The benzoylated derivative of Phe-Gly-Pro, Bz-Phe-Gly-Pro, was twice as active. To reduce the peptidic nature of ketomethylene inhibitors the P1’ and P2’ substituent may be cyclized to form a lactam, where there is a correlation between the inhibitory potency and the ring size. In 2001 it was postulated that a substitution α to nitrogen and making of 3-methyl-substituted analog of A58365A, a pyridone acid isolated from the fermentation broth of the bacterium Streptomyces chromofuscus with ACE inhibitory activity, might influence the level of biological activity by steric or hydrophobic effect, and/or by preventing reactions at C3. Also it was noticed during the synthetic work on A58365A that potential precursor were sensitive to oxidation of the five-membered ring and so the 3-methyl analogue might be more stable in this respect.|$|E

30|$|To reduce harmful sulfur {{content in}} {{lubricant}} additives, {{making use of}} isosterism {{has been shown to}} be an effective strategy. When thiobenzothiazole compounds were used as templates, the exchange of sulfur atoms in the thiazole ring with oxygen atoms and NH groups produced twelve <b>isosteres.</b> Similarly, 2 -benzothiazole- S-carboxylic acid esters were used as template molecules to produce six <b>isosteres.</b> About 30 % of the <b>isosteres</b> exhibited a satisfactory deviation of ± 5 % relative to the template, ignoring the specific changes in the base oils, the differences in molecular structure, and the friction or wear properties. The template molecules and <b>isosteres</b> in triisodecyl trimellitate exhibited better tribological properties than in trimethylolpropane trioleate or bis(2 - ethylhexyl) adipate. Comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA)- and comparative molecular similarity index analysis (CoMSIA)-quantitative structure tribo-ability relationship (QSTR) models were employed to study the correlation of molecular structures between the base oils and additives. The models indicate that the higher the structural similarities of the base oils and additives are, the more synergetic the molecular force fields of the lubricating system are; the molecular force fields creating synergistic effects will improve tribological performance.|$|R

40|$|The {{effective}} {{prevention and}} treatment of infections caused by microorganisms are increasingly threatened by antimicrobial resistance. b-Lactam antibiotics {{have been used for}} many decades to cure bacterial infections. However, the prolonged and widespread use of these drugs has made them less effective against various bacterial strains and raises significant questions about their future usefulness. The most common cause of bacterial resistance to b-lactam antibiotics is expression of b-lactamase enzymes. Extended spectrum b-lactamases (ESBLs) and some other enzymes in this family confer broad spectrum antibiotic resistance to most of the current b-lactams including the third generation, posing serious therapeutic challenges. It is therefore crucial to develop new potent drug candidates as antibacterial agents and broad spectrum b-lactamase inhibitors. Given the structural resemblance of cyclobutanone to the β‐lactam ring system, it was envisioned that the biosynthetic pathway to penicillin might be diverted to deliver cyclobutanone analogues of penicillins in a chemo-enzymatic approach. This would afford a series of analogues in which the classic b-lactam ring is replaced with a cyclobutanone <b>isostere.</b> Previous studies on cyclobutanone analogues of b-lactams have demonstrated b-lactamase inhibitory properties, but comprehensive investigation has been hampered by difficulties in synthesizing biologically relevant motifs. Thus a chemoenzymatic approach is proposed, in which isopenicillin N synthase (IPNS), the key enzyme in penicillin biosynthesis, would be induced to build the cyclobutanone analogue of penicillin. To this end, an analogue of linear tripeptide d-(L-a-aminoadipoyl) -L-cysteinyl-D-valine (ACV) has been designed as a substrate to undergo oxidative cyclization by IPNS to generate the ‘cyclobutanone-penicillin’ framework. Two pathways have been investigated towards the target compound. Pathway A involves a key metathesis step to build a cysteinyl-valine (CV) <b>isostere,</b> which would undergo coupling with a suitably protected L-a-aminoadipic acid to generate the tripeptide analogue. This approach involves synthesis of a vinyl ketone viaa Weinreb amidefrom N­-Boc-S-benzyl-L-cysteine in 4 steps. The vinyl ketone was subjected to cross metathesis with several coupling partners towards an unsaturated derivative of the target CV <b>isostere.</b> The alternative Pathway B utilizes a Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons (HWE) reaction strategy to build a key a,b-unsaturated ketone. Michael addition then introduces the “valinyl” isopropyl group to generate the CV <b>isostere</b> for coupling with L-a-aminoadipic acid. Two variations of this approach have been developed. The first starts with S‐(para‐methoxybenzyl) ‐L‐cysteine methyl ester to assemble the enone. Michael addition using an organozinc reagent, gold(III) chloride and designer solvent TPGS (a-tocopherol methoxypolyethylene glycolsuccinate) in aqueous medium afforded a diastereomeric mixture of the CV <b>isostere.</b> The second variation of the HWE route uses an aziridine derived from L-serine methyl ester, from which the HWE reaction afforded an enone. Michael addition followed by ring-opening of the aziridine with a thiol nucleophile yielded the CV <b>isostere</b> as a mixture of diastereomers. Selective N-deprotection of the dipeptide analogue was performed using para-toluenesulfonic acid, followed by coupling to doubly-protected L-a-aminoadipic acid to give the tripeptide <b>isostere</b> in protected from. Deprotection of the final tripeptide <b>isostere</b> was not possible due to time constraints. In a different approach to combating resistant bacteria, a series of cyclam derivatives and related compounds with an amide link has been synthesized. This strategy was inspired by recent results demonstrating that azamacrocycle derivatives of this ilk display promising antibiotic activity against several species of Mycobacteria. A synthetic route to cyclam-based naphthalimideand naphthalene compounds were developed, from di-Boc protected cyclam diacid employing a Staudinger ligation strategy. A similar protocol was utilised to synthesise pyridine-based naphthalimide and naphthalene compounds from pyridine- 2, 6 -dicarboxylic acid. Thus compounds have been investigated, which bear naphthalimide, naphthalene and cyclobutanone groups appended to azamacrocycle cyclam via an amide or click derived triazole linker. Extending this approach, a family of mono- and bis-amides has been synthesized from pyridine- 2, 6 -dicarboxylic acid and picolinic acid.
