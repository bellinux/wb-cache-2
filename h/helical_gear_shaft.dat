This paper takes a <b>helical</b> <b>gear</b> <b>shaft</b> as {{research}} subject and discusses the main structural parameters {{to see how}} it would affect natural frequency sensitivity. The parametrical model of <b>helical</b> <b>gear</b> <b>shaft</b> is created by using software PROE 3. 0. The natural frequencies and vibration shapes are calculated by the modal analysis. The relationship between the structural parameters and the natural frequency sensitivity can be obtained by means of ANSYS. The result shows that the structural parameters can affect the natural frequency sensitivity. The variation in low order natural frequency is similar to that in high order natural frequency. The effect of module on the natural frequency sensitivity is more remarkable comparing with pressure angle, modification coefficient and helical angle. Selecting structural parameters reasonably may reduce vibration and noise of the <b>helical</b> <b>gear</b> <b>shaft</b> effectively...|$|E

40|$|In the {{currently}} booming market of wind turbines, a clear focus {{is put on}} the design of reliable and cost-effective subsystems, such as the gearbox. A requirement for reliable gearbox design calculations is accurate load data and sufficient insight in the dynamics of the entire wind turbine drive train. To ensure this, considerable research effort is spent in advanced modelling and simulation techniques. The steadily increasing size of wind turbine gearboxes results in an increase of the influence of component flexibility. Therefore simulation models should accurately represent these. In this work the flexibile multibody modelling technique is used, as it directly includes the components’ flexibilities. A generic gearbox consisting of one planetary and two <b>helical</b> <b>gear</b> stages is modelled. A detailed estimation of the influence of the flexibility of <b>helical</b> <b>gear</b> stage <b>shafts</b> on the overall modal behaviour of the gearbox is discussed. The vibration modes are classified into global modes, planetary modes and helical modes. Rigid and flexible multibody models of the generic gearbox are compared. All comparisons show significant influence of the components’ flexibilities. Results are compared with results from previous work investigating the effect of flexibility on the modal behaviour of wind turbine gearboxes. status: publishe...|$|R

25|$|Hobbing uses a {{hobbing machine}} with two skew spindles, one mounted {{with a blank}} {{workpiece}} {{and the other with}} the hob. The angle between the hob's spindle (axis) and the workpiece's spindle varies, {{depending on the type of}} product being produced. For example, if a spur gear is being produced, then the hob is angled equal to the helix angle of the hob; if a <b>helical</b> <b>gear</b> is being produced then the angle must be increased by the same amount as the helix angle of the <b>helical</b> <b>gear.</b> The two <b>shafts</b> are rotated at a proportional ratio, which determines the number of teeth on the blank; for example, for a single-threaded hob if the gear ratio is 40:1 the hob rotates 40 times to each turn of the blank, which produces 40 teeth in the blank. If the hob has multiple threads the speed ratio must be multiplied by the number of threads on the hob. The hob is then fed up into the workpiece until the correct tooth depth is obtained. Finally the hob is fed through the workpiece parallel to the blank's axis of rotation.|$|R

Cold rolling is an {{advanced}} splinterless processing method, {{which has been}} applied to process many parts, like spur <b>gears,</b> <b>helical</b> <b>gears,</b> spline <b>shaft</b> and ballscrew, etc. Ballscrew which determines the motion characteristics has been used as key transmission part of ballscrew pair. According to differential geometry and meshing theory, the mathematic model of ballscrew manufactured by cold rolling is built, and the normal section equation of ballscrew is derivated in this paper. The cold forming principle of ballscrew is investigated; the meshing model, the contact line and theoretical errors of the ballscrew are constructed. The objective moving laws between roller and workpiece are revealed by analyzing the meshing model and the contact line, the processing method of cold-rolling is considered as the generating method which can lay the foundation for roller design by analyzing forming principle. By analyzing the profile error and the error of the actual helix of the centrode of ball, the error generation causes are discovered, and the calculation methods of the profile error and the spiral error of ballscrew are proposed. By analyzing the error evolution and taking a certain type of ballscrew for example, the results indicate that the profile error is brought by roller designing, and the spiral error is caused by discontinuous contact...|$|R

Because the {{curvature}} is close to each other, the strength also increased and thus, it is often used in heavily-loaded workplaces. The national standard for double circular-arc <b>helical</b> <b>gear</b> (ex., GB 12759 - 91) {{is based on the}} size of the gear module to design its tooth profile. This shows that tooth geometric-related designs are quite complicated. If the effect of the different pressure angle parameter is considered, we would be unable to conduct relevant studies for the original standard formula with a double circular-arc <b>helical</b> <b>gear</b> set at a pressure angle of 24 °.

In this paper, a new concept of Root Mean Square (RMS) value calculation using angle domain signals within small angular ranges is proposed. With this concept, a new diagnosis algorithm based on the time pulses of an encoder is developed to overcome the difficulty of fault diagnosis for <b>helical</b> <b>gears</b> at low rotational speeds. In this proposed algorithm, both acceleration signals and encoder impulse signal are acquired at the same time. The sampling rate and data length in angular domain are determined based on the rotational speed and size of the gear. The vibration signals in angular domain are obtained by re-sampling the vibration signal of the gear in the time domain according to the encoder pulse signal. The fault features of the <b>helical</b> <b>gear</b> at low rotational speed are then obtained with reference to the RMS values in small angular ranges and the order tracking spectrum following the Angular Domain Synchronous Average processing (ADSA).
