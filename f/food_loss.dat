40|$|Packaging {{has been}} on the {{environmental}} agenda for decades. It has been discussed and debated within the society mainly as an environmental problem. Production, distribution and consumption of food and drinks contribute significant to the environmental impact. However, consumers in the EU waste about 20 % of the food they buy. The function of packaging in reducing the amount of <b>food</b> <b>losses</b> is an important but often neglected environmental issue. This thesis focuses on the functions of packaging {{that can be used to}} preserve resources efficiently and reduce the environmental impact of the food-packaging system. The service perspective is used to increase knowledge about consumer interaction with packages. Fifteen packaging attributes, for example, ‘easy to empty’, ‘hygienic’ and ‘contain the right quantity’, were identified as influencing the amount of <b>food</b> <b>losses</b> at the consumer. The result showed that there are potentials to both increase consumer satisfaction and decrease the environmental impact of the food-packaging system, when new packaging design reduces <b>food</b> <b>losses.</b> A model was developed that calculates the balance of environmental impact between reduction of <b>food</b> <b>losses,</b> and more packaging material. The result showed that it can be environmentally motivated to increase the environmental impact of packaging, if the amount of <b>food</b> <b>losses</b> is reduced. This is especially true for food items with high environmental impact, e. g. meat and dairy products, and for food items that have a high share of loss, e. g. bread. I have also explored to what extent packaging can influence <b>food</b> <b>losses</b> in households. The study showed that about 20 % to 25 % of household food waste was related to packaging. The households noted three packaging attributes as the main causes for food losses; ‘too big packaging’, ‘difficult to empty’ and ‘best-before-date’. Finally there is a discussion of packaging research in the context of sustainability principles, and suggestions for further research.

The present communication focuses on meat of Gallus species, i. e. meat of chicken and culled laying hens. In the present study, <b>food</b> <b>losses</b> were defined as product discard from human consumption due to sanitary reasons: mortality between harvesting and stunning and condemnation at slaughter house. Food waste was defined as {{any part of the}} animal which is edible or could, after processing, be eaten by humans yet which is used for other purposes, such as for pet food. The study drew in diagrams the different technical tracks from the live animal to the end product, with the various associated by-products coming out along the slaughter and processing lines, and their valorisation. Determinants for <b>food</b> <b>losses</b> and waste were found to be either technical, such as technical characteristics of processing tools, economical, such as the market demand side, regulatory or organizational, such as shelf management at retail with respect to products’ expiry dates. Quantification of <b>food</b> <b>losses</b> and waste is difficult to perform due to the confidential character of business data.

Thus, one objective {{of this study is to}} contribute to the quantification of <b>food</b> <b>losses</b> between field and retail, where the main focus is set on potatoes, apples, carrots, strawberries and asparagus. Furthermore, neither reasons why products are removed from the supply chains nor their alternative uses are fully examined yet. This is why, the study takes a look on those issues, too. Results are based on data from an online survey among producers of fruits, vegetables and potatoes in North-Rhine Westphalia, Germany and on interviews with producers and other supply chain experts. Findings suggest that the products’ size and form, their storage capabilities and food safety issues have big impacts on <b>food</b> <b>losses.</b> Despite a small sample size, these findings are in line with recent studies...|$|R

She headed off in search of new beginnings, legal anonymity and maybe love, but what she found was a very different story. The satirical show explored <b>food,</b> <b>loss,</b> death, requited and unrequited love, and the gentle art of condom shopping in a foreign land. The Show included the cooking of a traditional Italian dish. It starred Klara McMurray and Bom and was directed by: Suzan Alexopolous.|$|E
50|$|Another {{very common}} long term problem {{which is now}} more {{appreciated}} is gastroparesis. Gastroparesis affects millions of individuals and is often never suspected and most patients have a delay in diagnosis. Basically in gastroparesis, the stomach motility disappears and food remains stagnant in the stomach. The {{most common cause of}} gastroparesis is diabetes but it can also occur from a blockage at the distal end of stomach, a cancer or a stroke. Symptoms of gastroparesis includes abdominal pain, fullness, bloating, nausea, vomiting after eating <b>food,</b> <b>loss</b> of appetite and feeling of fullness after eating small amounts of food.|$|E
50|$|Habitat {{conservation}} {{is important in}} maintaining biodiversity, {{an essential part of}} global food security. There is evidence to support a trend of accelerating erosion of the genetic resources of agricultural plants and animals. An increase in genetic similarity of agricultural plants and animals means an increased risk of <b>food</b> <b>loss</b> from major epidemics. Wild species of agricultural plants {{have been found to be}} more resistant to disease, for example the wild corn species Teosinte is resistant to 4 corn diseases that affect human grown crops. A combination of seed banking and habitat conservation has been proposed to maintain plant diversity for food security purposes.|$|E
40|$|AbstractAn {{assessment}} of post-harvest handling practices and <b>food</b> <b>losses</b> in a maize-based farming system in semi-arid areas of Central and Northern Tanzania {{was carried out}} in 2012. Seventeen crops were mostly cultivated by the farmers in the surveyed areas; maize (32 %), sunflower (16 %) and pigeon peas (12 %) were the most cultivated while maize was the most stored. There are at least 7 months between two harvest seasons of each crop; while farmers sold the crops soon after harvest to cater for household expenditure (54 %) and school fees (38 %), the market prices increased significantly (P ≤  0. 05) within six months of storage. Most processing activities (winnowing, dehulling, drying, sorting and shelling) were carried out manually, almost entirely by women, but mechanized processing for maize, sunflower, millet, and sorghum were commonly practiced. Quantitative post-harvest losses of economic importance occur in the field (15 %); during processing (13 – 20 %), and during storage (15 – 25 %). The main storage pests responsible for the losses are larger grain borers (Prostephanus truncatus), grain weevils (Sitophilus granarius) and, the lesser grain borer (Rhyzopertha dominica). Most of the farmers considered changes in weather (40 %), field damage (33 %), and storage pests (16 %) as the three most important factors causing poor crop yields and aggravating <b>food</b> <b>losses.</b> However, survey results suggest that the farmers' poor knowledge and skills on post-harvest management are largely responsible for the <b>food</b> <b>losses.</b> 77 % of the surveyed farmers reported inadequate household foods and 41 % received food aid during the previous year. Increasing farmers' technical know-how on adaptation of the farming systems to climate variability, and training on post-harvest management could reduce <b>food</b> <b>losses,</b> and improve poverty and household food security...|$|R
