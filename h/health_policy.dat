40|$|Public <b>health</b> <b>policies</b> {{must address}} {{multiple}} goals and complex community health needs. Recently, management control practices have emerged {{to provide a}} broader type of information for evaluating the effectiveness of healthcare policies, and relate activities and processes to multiple strategic outcomes.

5|$|A {{number of}} {{medications}} are being studied for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, including bedaquiline and delamanid.

However, existing data suggest that patients taking bedaquiline in addition to standard TB therapy are five times more likely to die than those without the new drug, which has resulted in medical journal articles raising <b>health</b> <b>policy</b> questions about why the FDA approved the drug and whether financial ties to the company making bedaquiline influenced physicians' support for its use.|$|E

Jones then reversed course and signed it. Among the reforms included in the bill were a mechanism making the policies of all companies uniform and the creation of a <b>Health</b> <b>Policy</b> Board to regulate rate increases. It ensured that insurance companies could not deny coverage because of a pre-existing condition and allowed workers to retain their insurance after changing jobs.|$|E

5|$|The act of premastication is {{commonly}} found in all human societies and populations, although it is less prevalent in some than others. The evolution and selective advantage of premastication behaviours is that it supplements the infant diet of breast milk by providing access to more macro- and micro-nutrients. Although disease can be transmitted through saliva in the pre-chewed foods, the benefits conferred outweighed any risks of the practice during the evolution of human behaviour. Furthermore, discouraging premastication as prevention to disease transmittion may prove as disastrous an infant public <b>health</b> <b>policy</b> as when infants breastfeeding was discouraged in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In the end, the potential benefits and pitfalls of this practice greatly depend on the dietary and medical circumstances of the mother and child. The true scope {{of the benefits of}} premastication and its prevalences in differenct societies is still under active research, though there appears to be some consensus on the nutritional benefits of the practice.|$|E
5|$|London's dead had {{traditionally}} been buried {{in and around}} local churches, and with {{a limited amount of}} space for burials, the oldest graves were regularly exhumed to free space for new burials. In {{the first half of the}} 19thcentury the population of London more than doubled, from a little under a million people in 1801 to almost two and a half million in 1851. Despite this rapid growth in population, the amount of land set aside for use as graveyards remained unchanged at approximately 300acres (0.5sqmi; 1.2km2), spread across around 200 small sites. Graveyards became very congested. Decaying corpses contaminated the water supply and the city suffered regular epidemics of cholera, smallpox, measles and typhoid. Public <b>health</b> <b>policy</b> at this time was generally shaped by the miasma theory (the belief that airborne particles were the primary factor in the spread of contagious disease), and the bad smells and risks of disease caused by piled bodies and exhumed rotting corpses caused great public concern. A Royal Commission established in 1842 to investigate the problem concluded that London's burial grounds had become so overcrowded that it was impossible to dig a new grave without cutting through an existing one.|$|E

40|$|Objectives Although ‘integrated’ public <b>health</b> <b>policies</b> {{are assumed}} to be the ideal way to {{optimize}} public health, it remains hard to determine how far removed we are from this ideal, since clear operational criteria and defining characteristics are lacking. Methods A literature review identified gaps in previous operationalizations of integrated public <b>health</b> <b>policies.</b> We searched for an approach that could fill these gaps. Results We propose the following defining characteristics of an integrated policy: (1) the combination of policies includes an appropriate mix of interventions that optimizes the functioning of the behavioral system, thus ensuring that motivation, capability and opportunity interact {{in such a way that}} they promote the preferred (health-promoting) behavior of the target population, and (2) the policies are implemented by the relevant policy sectors from different policy domains. Conclusion Our criteria should offer added value since they describe pathways in the process towards formulating integrated policy. The aim of introducing our operationalization is to assist policy makers and researchers in identifying truly integrated cases. The Behavior Change Wheel proved to be a useful framework to develop operational criteria to assess the current state of integrated public <b>health</b> <b>policies</b> in practice.

40|$|To date, since health {{problems}} are becoming critical {{to human beings}} all over the world, workplace health promotion (WHP) has gained more and more attention. However, few studies have tested its effects on employees’ work-related behaviors such as job satisfaction, organizational commitment; especially, few relative studies have been found done {{in the context of}} Chinese organizations. In this research, the influence of employees’ attitude towards their organization’s workplace <b>health</b> <b>policies</b> on their organizational commitment and job satisfaction were examined in a China-based company with data collected from 123 workers and managers. The main hypotheses were that employees’ attitude towards WHP were associated with (a) their job satisfaction, (b) and organizational commitment. Support was obtained for each hypothesis.
