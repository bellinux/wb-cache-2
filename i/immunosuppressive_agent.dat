A prominent consequence of the development in posttransplant immunosuppressive regimens is the reduced incidence of acute rejections, from 30 % to 40 % to approximately 15 % or even lower (Gjertson, Clin Transpl 2000 : 467 - 80), although it still remains an important risk factor compromising long-term renal allograft survival. The acute and chronic nephrotoxicity of <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>agents,</b> notably calcineurin inhibitors, have attracted increasing attention, and the reduction of these untoward effects has constituted an important theme of clinical research in transplantation.
