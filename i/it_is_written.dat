5|$|In formal competition, {{each player}} {{is obliged to}} record each move as it is played in a chess {{notation}} in order to settle disputes about illegal positions, overstepping time control, and making claims of draws by the fifty-move rule or repetition of position. Algebraic chess notation is the accepted standard for recording games today. There are other systems such as ICCF numeric notation for international correspondence chess and the obsolete descriptive chess notation. The current rule is that a move must {{be made on the}} board before <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>written</b> on paper or recorded with an electronic device.|$|E
5|$|In {{parallel}} with the efforts of Pierce, Silcott's lawyers had requested access in November 1990 to his original interview notes, so that the seven pages from his crucial fifth interview – the notes he said were fabricated– could be submitted for an electrostatic detection analysis (ESDA). The test can identify a small electrostatic charge left on a page when the page above <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>written</b> on; in this way, the test's developers say, the chronological integrity of interview notes can be determined.|$|E
5|$|It also liberally uses loanwords {{from the}} Tulu and Kannada languages. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>written</b> in the Kannada script. The dialect does not {{distinguish}} between the nouns of Kannada and Konkani and has developed into a language that is very practical for business. Some Kannada rootwords which have disappeared from the Goan dialects due {{to the influence of}} Portuguese have re-entered the Mangalorean lexicon. 350–400 Portuguese lexical items are found in the Mangalorean Catholic dialect, of which more than half are related to religious terminology. The influence of Portuguese syntax is only found in some sets of phrases and prayers which have come down from the pre-migration era.|$|E

5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>written</b> in {{the same}} style as the Tory {{publications}} that attacked Dissenters, and was assumed by some people to be a genuine vindication of their view. The pamphlet raised embarrassing questions about {{the handling of the}} issue by the Tory ministry, and led to Defoe's arrest for seditious libel. His imprisonment, during which he fell into bankruptcy, was to have a lasting influence on his subsequent writings. In the years after his release, Defoe published several pamphlets that attempted to explain its purpose and his own views.|$|E
5|$|Of all {{the strains}} in the piece, the final D strain {{is perhaps the}} most interesting. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>written</b> in B-flat minor. When Joplin used minor keys in the {{previous}} sections, he used the relative key of G minor (i.e., relative to the main key of B-flat major). However, in this fourth section, he instead used the parallel key. This strain also features sections where the right hand and left hand play notes in unison, and in which the standard 2/4 time left-hand beat is noticeably absent.|$|E

50|$|There {{has been}} much {{diversity}} of sentiment on the question when this Epistle <b>was</b> <b>written.</b> That <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>written</b> at Rome, and when the apostle was imprisoned there, is the unanimous opinion of all who have written on the Epistle, and indeed is apparent {{on the face of}} it; see 2 Timothy 1:8, 2 Timothy 1:16; 2 Timothy 4:6. But whether <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>written</b> during his first imprisonment there, or during a second imprisonment, is a question, on which critics even now are by no means agreed. If the supposition of a second imprisonment at Rome, during which this Epistle <b>was</b> <b>written,</b> <b>is</b> correct, then <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>written</b> probably not far from the year AD 65. Lardner, however, who supposes <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>written</b> during the first imprisonment, places its date in May, AD 61; Hug, also, in the same year.|$|R

5|$|Inside No. 9 is a British dark comedy {{anthology}} {{television programme}} that first aired in 2014. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>written</b> by Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton and {{produced by the}} BBC. Each half-hour episode is a self-contained story with new characters and a new setting, and all star at least one (usually both) of Pemberton and Shearsmith. Aside from the writers, each episode has a new cast, allowing Inside No. 9 to attract a number of well-known actors. The stories are linked only {{by the fact that}} each takes place at a number 9, with settings including a suburban house, a gothic mansion and a barn. Pemberton and Shearsmith took inspiration for Inside No. 9 from an episode of Psychoville, a previous project, which was filmed in a single room. This episode was, in turn, inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's Rope. Inside No. 9 was also a reaction to Psychoville, which featured a long overarching story realised over multiple series.|$|E
5|$|The Apologetic Summary History of the People of These Indies (Spanish Apologética historia summaria de las gentes destas Indias) {{was first}} written as the 68th {{chapter of the}} General History of the Indies, but Las Casas changed it into a volume of its own, {{recognizing}} that the material was not historical. The material contained in the Apologetic History is primarily ethnographic accounts of the indigenous cultures of the Indies – the Taíno, the Ciboney, and the Guanahatabey, but it also contains descriptions {{of many of the}} other indigenous cultures that Las Casas learned about through his travels and readings. The history is apologetic because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>written</b> as a defense of the cultural level of the Indians, arguing throughout that indigenous peoples of the Americas were just as civilized as the Roman, Greek and Egyptian civilizations—and more civilized than some European civilizations. It was in essence a comparative ethnography comparing practices and customs of European and American cultures and evaluating them according to whether they were good or bad, seen from a Christian viewpoint.|$|E

5|$|The Sanskrit name of Tulsidas can be transliterated in two ways. Using the {{original}} Sanskrit, {{the name is}} written as Tulasīdāsa. Using the Hunterian transliteration system, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>written</b> as Tulsidas or Tulsīdās reflecting the vernacular pronunciation (since the written Indian languages maintain the vestigial letters that are no longer pronounced). The lost vowels are {{an aspect of the}} Schwa deletion in Indo-Aryan languages and can vary between regions. The name is a compound of two Sanskrit words: Tulasī, which is an Indian variety of the basil plant considered auspicious by Vaishnavas (devotees of god Vishnu and his avatars like Rama), and Dāsa, which means slave or servant and by extension, devotee. Tulsidas, which means a servant of the plant Tulsi.|$|E
5|$|Warriors is {{a series}} of novels {{published}} by HarperCollins; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>written</b> by authors Kate Cary, Cherith Baldry, Tui Sutherland, with the plot developed by editor Victoria Holmes, who collectively use the pseudonym Erin Hunter. The series follows the adventures of four Clans of wild cats—ThunderClan, ShadowClan, WindClan, and RiverClan —in their forest and lake homes, who look up to StarClan, their warriors ancestors, and spirits in the stars, who guide the four clans. SkyClan, the long-forgotten fifth Clan of the forest, is later introduced in the stand-alone novel Firestar's Quest. It receives additional focus in the novel SkyClan's Destiny, the manga trilogy SkyClan and the Stranger, and the 2013 novella Cloudstar's Journey.|$|E
