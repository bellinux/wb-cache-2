String theory relates classical black-hole type solutions of Einstein-like equations (e. g. axidilaton gravity) to the string vacuum. Several such solutions are proposed and their properties are investigated, including their behavior under supersymmetry transformations. ^ A general feature of all possible quantum theories of gravitation is that they lead to a field theory description at low (as compared to the Planck mass) energies. The theoretical consistency, uniqueness and consequences of such an effective theory are investigated. I show that a power counting theorem allows for the momentum expansion that defines the effective theory even {{in the presence of}} large masses.

30|$|Our {{results should}} be {{interpreted}} cautiously for several reasons. First, all participants were in remission and followed in a specialized bipolar disorder care (Vieta et al. 2011). Additionally, many of the patients had previously received psychoeducation which may have increased their daily activity regularity. Second, although the BRIAN is an interviewer-administered instrument, it is also based on patients' self-report, which may have influenced the results. Further studies are needed to investigate the possible correlations between subjective (BRIAN) and objective measures (e.g., polysomnography). Third, this is a cross-sectional study which does not allow us to determine the direction of the relationship between circadian abnormalities and mood symptoms. Longitudinal studies are needed to clarify this issue. The use of more objective assessment tools (actigraphy) should be considered, although this technique is not <b>free</b> <b>of</b> <b>potential</b> biases, especially regarding the evaluation of sleep (Spruyt et al. 2011).|$|E

25|$|Aside from 5Î±-reductase, {{aromatase}} may inactivate testosterone signaling in {{skeletal muscle}} and adipose tissue, so AAS that lack aromatase affinity, {{in addition to}} being <b>free</b> <b>of</b> the <b>potential</b> side effect <b>of</b> gynecomastia, might be expected to have a higher myotrophic-androgenic ratio in comparison. In addition, DHT is inactivated by high activity of 3Î±-HSD in skeletal muscle (and cardiac tissue), and AAS that lack affinity for 3Î±-HSD could similarly be expected to have a higher myotrophic-androgenic ratio (although perhaps also increased long-term cardiovascular risks). In accordance, DHT, mesterolone (1Î±-methyl-DHT), and mestanolone (17Î±-methyl-DHT) are all described as very poorly anabolic due to inactivation by 3Î±-HSD in skeletal muscle, whereas other DHT derivatives like oxandrolone, oxymetholone, drostanolone, and stanozolol are all poor substrates for 3Î±-HSD and are described as potent anabolics.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: It was {{to report}} on Brazilian cases of {{neurological}} complications from bariatric surgery. The literature on the subject is scarce. METHOD: Cases attended by neurologists in eight different Brazilian cities were collected and {{described in the present}} study. RESULTS: Twenty-six cases were collected in this study. Axonal polyneuropathy was the most frequent neurological complication, but cases of central demyelination, Wernicke syndrome, optical neuritis, radiculits, meralgia paresthetica and compressive neuropathies were also identified. Twenty-one patients (80 %) had partial or no recovery from the neurological signs and symptoms.

40|$|Xenotransplantation using pig cells, {{tissues and}} organs may be {{associated}} with the transfer of porcine infectious agents, which may infect the human recipient and in the worst case induce a disease (zoonosis). To prevent this, a broad screening program of the donor animals for putative zoonotic microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, fungi and others, using sensitive and specific detection methods has to be performed. As long as it is still unknown, which microorganism represents a real risk for the recipient, experience from allotransplantation should be brought in. Due to the fact that pigs can be screened long before the date of transplantation, xenotransplantation will become eventually safer compared with allotransplantation. Screening and selection of animals <b>free</b> <b>of</b> <b>potential</b> zoonotic microorganisms, Caesarean section, vaccination and/or treatment with chemotherapeutics are the strategies of choice to obtain donor animals not transmitting microorganisms.

40|$|To {{reduce the}} {{frequency}} and severity of bacterial infection, selective antimicrobial modulation (SAM) was applied in 39 patients with severely decreased host defense mechanisms. The objective was to eliminate potentially pathogenic aerobic microorgan-isms with minimal disturbance of the normal anaerobic bacterial flora. Elimination of potentially pathogenic aerobic microorganisms was easily accomplished in patients not infected at hospitalization. The anaerobic flora seemed to be undisturbed, and selection of or overgrowth with resistant microorganisms did not occur. The microbiologic results of the SAM regimen correlated with the incidence of infection. Only three major infections occurred in 23 patients who were free of potentially pathogenic microorgan-isms; 10 major infections occurred in 16 patients who were not <b>free</b> <b>of</b> <b>potential</b> pathogens.

40|$|These {{guidelines}} describe technical {{procedures that}} {{minimize the risk}} of pest introductions with movement of cacao germplasm for research, crop improvement, plant breeding, exploration or conservation. The recommendations made in these guidelines are intended for small, specialized consignments used in research programmes, e. g. for collection, conservation and utilization for breeding of plant genetic resources. These guidelines are not meant for trade and commercial consignments concerning export and import of germplasm or cocoa beans. The conservation and utilization of plant genetic resources and their global distribution are essential components of research activities underpinning improvement programmes. Inevitably, the movement of germplasm involves a risk of accidentally introducing pests along with the host plant. To minimize such risks, preventive measures and effective testing procedures are required to ensure that distributed material is <b>free</b> <b>of</b> pests <b>of</b> <b>potential</b> phytosanitary importance.
