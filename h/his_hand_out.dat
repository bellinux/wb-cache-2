25|$|On February 28, 2016, {{after winning}} the Folds of Honor QuikTrip 500 at Atlanta Motor Speedway, during his victory lap, driver Jimmie Johnson held <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>out</b> of his window, with three fingers {{extended}} in tribute to Earnhardt. This was following Johnson's 76th Cup Series win, which tied the career mark of Earnhardt's. This is also the track where Earnhardt claimed his sixth Winston Cup Series title.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the opening}} match, AAA paid {{homage to the}} promotion's founder, Antonio Peña, while the ring crew set up a steel cage for the second match of the evening, a four-way Parejas Suicidas match, {{featuring}} the teams of Chessman and Juventud Guerrera, Extreme Tiger and Halloween, Jack Evans and Teddy Hart, and Joe Líder and Psicosis. The match was contested under escape rules, with all eight participants starting inside the cage and after only one is left inside, that person will then wrestle his partner in a Lucha de Apuestas. Psicosis allowed Halloween to {{climb to the top}} of the cage, believing that he was going to dive back in onto his opponents, but instead Halloween betrayed his Perros del Mal stablemate and became the first man to escape the cage. Extreme Tiger and Jack Evans, former AAA World Tag Team Champions, worked together against Psicosis and Teddy Hart, the other two Perros del Mal members in the match, but were then attacked by Juventud Guerrera, swinging a garbage can. Guerrera then became the second man to escape the cage and was followed shortly afterwards by Tiger, who dove from the top of the cage outside onto Halloween and Guerrera. This meant that the former La Familia de Tijuana was the first team to successfully avoid the Lucha de Apuesta. This was followed by Psicosis turning on and attacking Líder, who had publicly announced prior to the event that he hoped to lose the Parejas Suicidas match to get a shot at Psicosis' hair, before escaping the cage. Evans was the next to escape the cage, after avoiding Teddy Hart's attempts to stop him. Hart then climbed on top of the cage and dove onto Chessman and Líder with a moonsault, before climbing back up and escaping, saving himself and Evans from a Hair vs. Hair match and leaving only Chessman and Líder inside. Psicosis, realizing he was in danger of being forced to a Hair vs. Hair match, climbed up the cage and put <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>out</b> to Líder, offering to help him up. Líder grabbed the hand and started to climb, but was dropped to the mat following a kick from Chessman, who then climbed {{to the top of the}} opposite side of the cage to become the last escapee, meaning that the former La Hermandad 187 partners were forced to a Lucha de Apustas later in the event. As Chessman celebrated at the top of the cage, the lights in the arena suddenly went out, leading to Vampiro making a surprise appearance and pushing his rival down from the top of the cage, dropping him through a set of tables on the floor of the Arena Ciudad de México. Afterwards, Chessman was stretchered out of the arena, while Vampiro showed his support for Líder in his upcoming match.|$|E
2500|$|In July of {{that year}} he signed Larry Doby, the first black player {{to play in the}} American League. Doby's first game was on July 5 and before the game, Doby was {{introduced}} to his teammates by player-manager Lou Boudreau. [...] "One by one, Lou introduced me to each player. 'This is Joe Gordon,' and Gordon put <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>out.</b> 'This is Bob Lemon,' and Lemon put <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>out.</b> 'This is Jim Hegan,' and Hegan put <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>out.</b> All the guys put their hand out, all but three. As soon as he could, Bill Veeck got rid of those three", Doby said. The following year later Veeck signed Satchel Paige to a contract, making the hurler the oldest rookie in major league history.|$|E

2500|$|The African press named Uruguay {{public enemy}} No.1 and {{described}} them as cheats. Suárez was unapologetic about his handball, stating [...] "I {{made the best}} save of the tournament." [...] Suárez boasted after the match of his handball save, claiming that [...] "The 'Hand of God' now belongs to me," [...] {{a reference to the}} handball goal scored by Diego Maradona in the 1986 World Cup. Ghana's coach Milovan Rajevac argued that Suárez's actions were [...] "really shocking," [...] describing the result as a [...] "football injustice." [...] Uruguay's coach Óscar Tabárez defended Suárez: [...] "Saying we cheated Ghana is too harsh a word to use...We also abide by what the referee did. It could have been a mistake. Yes, he stuck <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>out,</b> but it's not cheating. What else do you want? Is Suárez also to blame for Ghana missing the penalty? We try to be dignified, and if we lose a match, we look for the reasons for it. You shouldn't look to third parties." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Sammartino {{was about}} 51 years old, he was {{involved}} in a backstage fight with a former football player. Six men were backstage at a wrestling show in an area that was restricted, and when Sammartino spotted the men, he told them that if security saw them in this area, they might get in trouble. Dave [...] "Rooster" [...] Fleming, a former CFL player with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, stuck <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>out</b> to Sammartino. When Sammartino went to shake his hand, Fleming began to squeeze hard, and Sammartino asked him what he was doing, to which Fleming replied, [...] "You're nothing but a washed up old man". Sammartino responded, [...] "Not too washed up to take care of you". Upon hearing that, Fleming took a swing at Sammartino, but Sammartino blocked it and knocked him down with a punch. Sammartino soon found himself fighting the other five men at once. At this time, The Iron Sheik was in the showers after his match and heard the commotion. He immediately jumped in next to Sammartino and the two wrestlers proceeded to [...] "clean house".|$|E
2500|$|The film then rolls {{into the}} song “A World Without” as a grief-stricken Charlie {{and several other}} mourners, {{some of whom are}} clearly played by Queensrÿche's band members, attend Cathy’s funeral. The priest begins his eulogy but then appears to be {{laughing}} and pointing at Charlie, as do everyone else in attendance except for La Torre, who looks at Charlie with a serious face, as Charlie clutches his child wrapped in a blanket. Brian is also shown to be laughing and pointing but his appearance {{as well as the other}} mourners’ cruelty is revealed to be happening merely inside Charlie’s head, coinciding with the lyric [...] "what is real and what is fantasy". The song continues playing as Charlie is seen sitting beside a crib and drinking heavily while a baby is heard crying. He has a vision of Cathy picking up their child from the crib, and recalls the look on Brian’s face that day when he finked on him. Charlie then proceeds to pull a gun from a drawer and point it at his head but the vision of Cathy returns to assure him that she is there with him. Four years later, Charlie is seen working at his desk and smiling at a picture that his daughter drew for him. As he leaves his desk, the camera zooms in on a photograph of his now four-year-old daughter. Charlie heads toward the garage where he finds his brother waiting for him by the car. Without saying a word, Brian nervously holds <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>out</b> to Charlie who happily embraces him, and the two of them reconcile. During the end credits, the track [...] "X2" [...] is played.|$|E
