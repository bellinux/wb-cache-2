The organization highlights the Chernobyl nuclear disaster of 1986 and Fukushima nuclear disaster of 2011 {{as evidence of the}} risk nuclear power can pose to peoples lives, the environment and the economy. Greenpeace views the benefits of nuclear power to be relatively minor in comparison to its major problems and risks, such as environmental damage and risks from uranium mining, nuclear weapons proliferation, and unresolved questions concerning nuclear waste. The organization argues that the potential of nuclear power to mitigate global warming is marginal, referring to the IEA <b>energy</b> <b>scenario</b> where an increase in world's nuclear capacity from 2608 TWh in 2007 to 9857 TWh by 2050 would cut global greenhouse gas emissions less than 5% and require 32 nuclear reactor units of 1000MW capacity built per year until 2050. According to Greenpeace the slow construction times, construction delays, and hidden costs, all negate the mitigation potential of nuclear power. This makes the IEA scenario technically and financially unrealistic. They also argue that binding massive amounts of investments on nuclear energy would take funding away from more effective solutions.

40|$|<b>Energy</b> <b>scenarios</b> are an {{important}} element in the discussion about the future of energy supply. In describing possible future developments and their dependence on specific constraints they make a contribution to decision-making processes in the field of energy policies. The demand for objective assessment in this field is an expectation which <b>energy</b> <b>scenarios</b> have to satisfy. However, due to several reasons it is unclear to which extent <b>energy</b> <b>scenarios</b> can meet these expectations, especially because they generally depend on assumptions that are based on scientific knowledge as well as on energy-political arguments. Another difficulty in terms of objectiveness results from the fact that these studies are typically conducted on behalf of political institutions. Therefore not only the author, but also the client has a designing impact on the scenario. The paper at hand presents a research project which approaches the problem of objectiveness of <b>energy</b> <b>scenarios</b> mainly in an empirical manner.

The underlying assumption is that for an analysis of <b>energy</b> <b>scenarios</b> in terms of objectiveness profound knowledge of the formation conditions and their influence on the results is crucial. As major parts of this process, the direct designing impact of the author in modelling the energy system and the indirect impact of the client is examined.

40|$|SUMMARY During the 1970 s, many <b>energy</b> <b>scenarios</b> {{about future}} <b>energy</b> demand and supply appeared. This can be {{attributed}} to various developments, like the increased environmental awareness, the oil crisis of the year 1973, and the introduction of the computer which gave a boost to the forecasting discipline. Over time, energy models evolved from simple extrapolations studying only a single energy carrier or industry, to ambitious and complex models that draw upon a wide variety of fields. Nowadays, energy modeling is widely practiced and is of great value for policymakers, planners and the private sector in making policy, planning and investment decisions. These decisions also often have long-term consequences. However, the practice and value of <b>energy</b> <b>scenarios</b> is subject of discussion in scientific literature. Accordingly, it is useful and important to assess energy studies by looking back and to compare the forecasts with reality. Various studies have examined energy forecasts retrospectively, and found that almost all long-term energy forecasts about future energy use and the energy mix do not match real developments. These evaluations have been performed for global, European and US <b>energy</b> <b>scenarios,</b> but not for Dutch <b>energy</b> <b>scenarios.</b> Besides, like forty years ago, in recent years many <b>energy</b> <b>scenarios</b> are presented, containing forecasts about future energy use and the energy mix. Therefore, the main research question is: “What lessons can be learned from the past 40 years of Dutch energy forecasts, and {{what are the implications of}} these lessons for current and future Dutch energy scenarios”. Hence, this research is twofold: after a study of the literature about energy forecasting and the evaluation of these forecasts, the Dutch case is analyzed by comparing the various past energy studies with actual developments. Second, the results of the first part are used to assess current scenarios and to construct alternative forecasts of total energy use and the share of renewables. The results of this research can be reflected by two main conclusions. The first main conclusion is that energy forecasting is difficult. This is comprehensible, since the energy system is part of a larger complex societal system. Moreover, how to improve energy models and whether these are getting better over time is also difficult to indicate. It is recommended to use a simple and conservative approach, to combine scenarios, and to take long-term trends as a starting point. In addition, a standard procedure can be developed to Dutch evaluate <b>energy</b> <b>scenarios.</b> Similar to other global, EU and US energy forecast evaluations, the comparison of past Dutch <b>energy</b> <b>scenarios</b> with actual developments identified the following: a mean absolute percentage error of 36 %, an average overestimation of total domestic energy use with 28 %, large offsetting errors with respect to energy use per sector and per source, the use of wrong assumptions, and a large influence of prevailing conditions and short-term trends. The second main conclusion is that the energy transition takes time. The energy system is slowly changing and a lot of factors (social, institutional, technological, environmental and economic) influence the transition process. Like the ‘old’ <b>energy</b> <b>scenarios</b> were too optimistic about the contribution of renewable energy, the alternative forecasts indicate that also the current <b>energy</b> <b>scenarios</b> are optimistic about the future share of renewables. On average, the alternative forecasts predict 25 % renewable energy in the year 2050, which is lower than the 40 % of the current <b>energy</b> <b>scenarios.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Background The {{focus of}} the paper is on {{scenario}} studies that examine energy systems. This type of studies is usually based on formal energy models, from which energy policy recommendations are derived. In order to be valuable for strategic decision-making, the comprehensibility of these complex scenario studies is necessary. We aim at highlighting and mitigating the problematic issue of lacking transparency in such model-based scenario studies. Methods In {{the first part of}} the paper, the important concept of transparency in the context of energy scenarios is introduced. In the second part, we develop transparency criteria based on expert judgement. The set of selected criteria is structured into ‘General Information’, ‘Empirical Data’, ‘Assumptions’, ‘Modeling’, ‘Results’, and ‘Conclusions and Recommendations’. Based on these criteria, a transparency checklist is generated. Results The proposed transparency checklist is not intended to measure the quality of <b>energy</b> <b>scenario</b> studies, but to deliver a tool which enables authors of <b>energy</b> <b>scenario</b> studies to increase the level of transparency of their work. The checklist thus serves as a standardized communication protocol and offers guidance for interpreting these studies. A reduced and a full version of the checklist are provided. The former simply lists the transparency criteria and can be adopted by authors with ease; the latter provides details on each criterion. We also illustrate how the transparency checklist may be applied by means of examples. Conclusions We argue that transparency is a necessary condition for a reproducible and credible scenario study. Many <b>energy</b> <b>scenario</b> studies are at present characterized by an insufficient level of transparency. In essence, the checklist represents a synthesizing tool for improving their transparency. The target group of this work is experts, in their role of authors and/or readers of <b>energy</b> <b>scenario</b> studies. By applying the transparency checklist, the authors of <b>energy</b> <b>scenario</b> studies signal their commitment to a high degree of transparency, in consonance with scientific standards...|$|E
40|$|<b>Energy</b> <b>scenarios</b> link {{long-term}} {{policy goals}} to near-term decisions and may thus guide {{the transition to}} more sustainable energy systems. Yet, systematic empirical analyses of how <b>energy</b> <b>scenarios</b> are understood and used by relevant actors are rare. This working paper addresses the situation in Switzerland, where several com-peting public <b>energy</b> <b>scenarios</b> have been developed by different organisations {{in reaction to the}} government’s decision to phase out nuclear power. The analysis focuses on the energy research community, which has a dou-ble role in the dissemination of scenario-based insights: On the one hand, researchers develop <b>energy</b> <b>scenarios</b> which may in turn be used by decision-makers in policy and industry to create or assess action alternatives. On the other hand, many researchers are scenario users themselves. We conducted 13 structured in-depth inter-views with energy researchers. The sample covers a wide scope of institutions and disciplinary backgrounds, including economics, engineering, geography, sociology, and law. We find that while most researchers do use <b>energy</b> <b>scenarios,</b> there are, essentially, two contrasting types of scenario use among them: One group of researchers, which we labelled divers, is interested in very specific data and assumptions that it wants to fully understand. A second group, which we labelled sailors, refers to the results of a scenario analysis in a more general manner. We identified different interpretations of scenario content be-tween sailors and divers. These discrepancies are a result of the highly specialised modelling activities on which <b>energy</b> <b>scenarios</b> are based. Implicit knowledge that is generated during the process of developing energy sce-narios is inaccessible to most scenarios users. We therefore conclude the study with a discussion about the usefulness of participative stakeholder involvement and scenario documentation that is adjusted to the interests and competencies of its users. Because energy sce-narios increasingly serve as a scientifically derived information basis for societal debates about energy transitions, their use needs to be studied more extensively...|$|R
