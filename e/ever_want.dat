500|$|Cillian Murphy as Robert Michael Fischer, {{the heir}} to a {{business}} empire and the team's target. [...] Murphy said Fischer was portrayed as [...] "a petulant child who's {{in need of a}} lot of attention from his father, he has everything he could <b>ever</b> <b>want</b> materially, but he's deeply lacking emotionally". The actor also researched the sons of Rupert Murdoch, [...] "to add to that the idea of living in the shadow of someone so immensely powerful".|$|E
500|$|Stewart hated his {{nickname}} of [...] "Black Jack", as {{he believed it}} made him {{out to be a}} dirty player. Hockey Hall of Fame defenceman King Clancy agreed he was not dirty, but stated he was the [...] "roughest son of a gun you'd <b>ever</b> <b>want</b> to meet." [...] Stewart's style of play resulted in numerous injuries; he had dozens of scars and required over 200 stitches to close various cuts during his career. At one point he played a full season with a broken hand using a cast formed to hold his stick.|$|E
500|$|The {{movie and}} Close were praised by The New York Times: [...] "Ms. Close, lean and more mature, hints that {{a touch of}} desperation lies in Nellie's cockeyed optimism." [...] The review also commented that the movie [...] "is beautifully produced, better than the stagy 1958 film" [...] and praised the singing. Kenrick, however, dislikes the adaptation: [...] "You {{certainly}} won't <b>ever</b> <b>want</b> to put this disaster in your player, {{unless you want to}} hear the sound of Rodgers and Hammerstein whirling in their graves. Glenn Close is up to the material, but her supporting cast is uniformly disastrous. [...] A pointless and offensive waste of money, time and talent." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, a new feature film {{based on the}} Diabolik comics to be {{directed}} by Christophe Gans and starring Mark Dacascos and Monica Bellucci was in the planning stages. Gans opined that: [...] "The Bava film is unique and I'd never, <b>ever</b> <b>want</b> to copy it. But let's see where we can take Diabolik today for a totally new and different Pop art experience." [...] The film has not gone into production. In 2002, screenwriter Mario Gomboli announced a French production of Diabolik was to be made with a contemporary setting and a script written by Carlo Lucarelli and Giampiero Rigosi. A script was completed in April 2007, with filming set to begin in January 2008, but the production stalled.|$|E
500|$|The Beatles signed Epstein's first {{management}} contract, but Epstein did not. He {{later told}} Taylor, [...] "Well, if they <b>ever</b> <b>want</b> {{to tear it}} up, they can hold me but I can't hold them". (Note: English law would have enforced the contract through the doctrine of part performance). The contract stated that Epstein would receive a management commission of 25 per cent of the group's gross income after a certain financial threshold had been reached. The Beatles argued for a smaller percentage, but Epstein pointed {{out that he had}} been paying their expenses for months without receiving anything in return. On 1 October 1962, four days before the release of [...] "Love Me Do", Epstein signed Lennon and McCartney to a three-year NEMS publishing contract.|$|E
500|$|Before Barnette {{traveled}} upriver {{with the}} Isabelle, he met Judge James Wickersham in St. Michael. Wickersham was the judge {{for the federal}} Third Judicial District, which stretched from the North Slope to the Aleutian Islands. Wickersham was impressed with Barnette and his plan to establish a trading post at Tanacross. He suggested Barnette name his settlement Fairbanks, after Charles W. Fairbanks, the senior Senator from Indiana. Barnette liked the idea and later said, [...] "If we should <b>ever</b> <b>want</b> aid at the national capital, we would have the friendship, at least, of someone who could help us." [...] When Barnette heard of Pedro's gold strike, he transferred the name for his planned Tanacross store to the settlement on the Chena River and convinced the people with him to accept the name.|$|E

500|$|Between series one and two, Wood {{said she}} thought {{it was a mistake to}} do another As Seen On TV series, and had {{attempted}} to write a play instead: [...] "I've been seeking to branch out, but it hasn't happened. I wanted to do something different before I went back on TV." [...] However, she soon decided that the play was [...] "too Alan Ayckbourn", threw it away and began writing the second run instead. [...] She aimed to write 18 minutes of script a week. In the end it took six months to complete, an experience she did not enjoy.

[...] His captain for Australia and New South Wales, Richie Benaud said that he was [...] "one of the greatest entertainers we've had in Australian cricket".

500|$|Released on {{theaters in}} 1975, Jaws became the highest-grossing film ever at the time, a record it held {{for two years}} until the release of Star Wars. Benchley was {{satisfied}} with the adaptation, noting how dropping the subplots allowed for [...] "all the little details that fleshed out the characters". The film's success lead to three sequels, which Benchley had no involvement despite drawing on his characters. According to Benchley, once his payment of the adaptation-related royalties got late, he called his agent and she replied that the studio was arranging a deal for sequels. Benchley disliked the idea, saying, [...] "I don't care about sequels; who'll <b>ever</b> <b>want</b> to make a sequel to a movie about a fish?" [...] He subsequently relinquished the Jaws sequel rights, aside for a one-time payment of $70,000 for each one.|$|E

500|$|... "Cherry on Top" [...] is a pop and R {{track with}} a {{duration}} of three minutes and 48 seconds. Unlike the majority of Oh Land's songs, it is not an uptempo track. Instead, it contains [...] "piano instrumentals" [...] and [...] "light background harmonies". It features lyrics with a [...] "relatable" [...] message and [...] "figurative imagery". Oh Land herself stated that the song is about [...] "always going for the win, always focusing on the result and sometimes missing the process because you're such a perfectionist". According to Paul MacInnes from The Guardian, the lyrics serve as a [...] "plea to a lover about the pitfalls of excess"; the song opens with Oh Land singing, [...] "Small boy, big dreams / Going in for a bite", which is [...] "sublimely literal". She proceeds in the chorus: [...] "You can have it all but you never stop / 'Cause all you <b>ever</b> <b>want</b> is the cherry on top" [...] / [...] "And all you ever dreamed of, it ain't enough / You'll never fill that hole with the cherry on top".|$|E
500|$|After {{leaving the}} Secret Agent Corrigan daily strip, he {{illustrated}} the Marvel Comics adaptation of The Empire Strikes Back with Carlos Garzon, {{as well as}} the 50th issue of the monthly Star Wars comic. Williamson was Lucasfilms' first choice as illustrator for the Star Wars newspaper comic strip, a project Williamson had been offered years earlier but had declined to take on at the time. He was offered the Empire Strikes Back adaptation upon Lucasfilm's specific request, as George Lucas had an appreciation of Williamson's EC Comics and Flash Gordon work. Writer Archie Goodwin cited [...] "the comfort of knowing that I would be working with Al Williamson, an old friend that I've worked with over the years. He was absolutely the best Star Wars artist you could <b>ever</b> <b>want</b> to have. That makes it easier because you feel that whatever you do as a writer, you have an artist that will make it look great. He's also an artist that Lucasfilm kind of begged and pleaded for and always wanted to have do Star Wars material. There was that comfort factor in it as well." ...|$|E

In contrast, Poniewozik wrote {{that it was the}} one song choice he didn't like, feeling that it is overused, thus diminishing its impact. Abrams deemed Rachel's solo performance at sectionals [...] "amazing", and Flandez recommended: [...] "Watch it again if you <b>ever</b> <b>want</b> to take back three minutes of your life that you’ve wasted on something else." [...] Pardue called the group performance of [...] "You Can't Always Get What You Want" [...] "energetic [...] casual [...] and very Glee", but felt it [...] "would have been nice" [...] to feature different singers. Dan Snierson for Entertainment Weekly similarly noted that he would have preferred [...] "more vocal interplay between all group members". In December 2012, TV Guide named the rendition of [...] "Don't Rain on My Parade" [...] one of Glee best performances, commenting: [...] "Glee has done Broadway many times, but rarely better than this." ...|$|E

500|$|After being {{reminded}} {{to pick up}} Meg at {{the local}} roller rink, Peter and his friends decide to go skating. At the roller rink scene, the 1976 disco song [...] "A Fifth of Beethoven" [...] is featured, performed by Walter Murphy. This is a tongue-in-cheek gag, as Murphy {{is also one of}} the composers for Family Guy. After returning home without Meg, the Griffin family are shown watching a Pepperidge Farm commercial on their television. Immediately afterwards, Meg enters her home, and begs her parents to get buy her a new vehicle. Reluctant to do so, Peter informs Meg that plenty of people are able to get around without a car, including the fictional Marvel Comics superhero Iceman. Finally deciding to give in and purchase a vehicle for Meg, the Griffin family head to the local car dealership. While there, Brian notices a large amount of Hummers, and questions who would <b>ever</b> <b>want</b> to drive one. A cutaway then shows a loud, obnoxious man driving a yellow Hummer, who goes on to brag about being able to watch the 2005 film Madagascar while driving, and proceeds to destroy two vehicles in the process while yelling the name of former United States Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld.|$|E
500|$|Beginning in April 2008, {{the media}} {{reported}} growing speculation that Chris Matthews, news commentator {{and host of}} MSNBC's Hardball with Chris Matthews, might run in the 2010 Democratic primary for the United States Senate Pennsylvania seat then occupied by the Republican Arlen Specter. In an interview with The New York Times Magazine, Matthews said that he believed Specter {{had been in the}} Senate for too long, but that running for Senate would mean giving up a career he loved. Mark Leibovich, author of the article, wrote, [...] "Matthews has been particularly obsessed with Pennsylvania of late, devoting hours on and off the air to the state's upcoming Democratic primary, staying in close contact with the state's party apparatus". Speculation was further fueled by Matthews' appearance on an April 14 episode of The Colbert Report. Host Stephen Colbert asked Matthews about the rumors and prodded him to make a public announcement, to which Matthews replied, [...] "Did you <b>ever</b> <b>want</b> to be something your whole life? ... When you grow up, some kids want to be a fireman. I want to be a Senator. But I have to deal with these things as they come." [...] Matthews declined to directly answer questions about his possible candidacy when pressed by the media, but did not deny the possibility.|$|E
500|$|Kiedis' {{feelings}} of alienation from his bandmates {{led him to}} feel that the city of Los Angeles was his only companion: [...] "I felt an unspoken bond between me and my city. I'd spent so much time wandering through the streets of L.A. and hiking through the Hollywood Hills that I sensed there was a nonhuman entity, maybe the spirit of the hills and the city, who had me in her sights and was looking after me." [...] The lines [...] "Sometimes I feel like / My only friend / Is the city I live in / The City of Angels / Lonely as I am / Together we cry" [...] show a direct link to Kiedis' isolation and sense of susceptibility. Despite these emotions, Kiedis believed that his life was better without drugs, telling Rolling Stone that [...] "no matter how sad or lonely I got, things were a million percent better than they were two years earlier when I was using drugs all the time. There was no comparison." [...] The optimistic ideology gave birth to the chorus of the song: [...] "I don't <b>ever</b> <b>want</b> to feel / Like I did that day / Take me to the place I love", [...] "the place" [...] meaning his bandmates, friends, and family.|$|E
