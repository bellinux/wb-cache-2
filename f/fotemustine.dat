40|$|<b>Fotemustine</b> is a {{clinically}} used DNA-alkylating 2 -chloroethyl-substituted N-nitrosourea, {{which sometimes}} {{shows signs of}} haematotoxicity and reversible liver and renal toxicity as toxic side-effects. Mechanistic data on these side-effects are scarce and incomplete. In this study, firstly the cytotoxicity of <b>fotemustine</b> in freshly isolated rat hepatocytes was investigated and secondly the metabolism of <b>fotemustine</b> and possible mechanisms involved in the observed cytotoxicity. <b>Fotemustine</b> caused concentration and time-dependent cytotoxic effects in rat hepatocytes. Extensive GSH-depletion and formation of GSSG were first observed, followed by lipid peroxidation and finally by cell death measured as LDH-leakage. 2 -Chloroethyl analogues of <b>fotemustine,</b> {{which in contrast to}} <b>fotemustine</b> have no carbamoylating potency, were not toxic to rat hepatocytes. The data suggest that the cytotoxicity of <b>fotemustine</b> is resulting from its reactive decomposition product, DEP-isocyanate, GSH-conjugation of DEP-isocyanate was shown to protect against the cytotoxicity of <b>fotemustine,</b> however, only temporary and not completely. Synthetical DEP-SG, the GSH-conjugate of DEP-isocyanate, was also toxic to rat hepatocytes, albeit to a significantly lesser extent than <b>fotemustine.</b> In rat liver microsomes, no fotemustine-induced LPO was observed, suggesting that reactive decomposition products of <b>fotemustine</b> do not directly cause peroxidation of cellular membranes. <b>Fotemustine</b> did not affect the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase, catalase, GSH-peroxidase, GSSG-reductase and GSH S-transferases. Thus, direct effects on these antioxidant enzymes are not likely to explain the cytotoxic effects of <b>fotemustine</b> in hepatocytes. In conclusion, it is proposed that the cytotoxicity of <b>fotemustine</b> in rat hepatocytes is caused by rapid and extensive depletion of GSH by DEP-isocyanate, a reactive decomposition product of <b>fotemustine,</b> consequently hampering the endogenous protection against its own toxicity.

40|$|<b>Fotemustine</b> is a {{relatively}} novel DNA-alkylating 2 -chloroethyl-substituted N-nitrosourea (CENU) drug, clinically used {{for the treatment of}} disseminated malignant melanoma in different visceral and non-visceral tissues. Thrombocytopenia has been observed in patients treated with <b>fotemustine</b> and liver and renal toxicities as well. In this study, firstly the metabolism of <b>fotemustine</b> was investigated in vitro and secondly the undesired cytotoxicity of <b>fotemustine</b> as well as different ways of protection against it. In rat hepatocytes, chosen as a model system, <b>fotemustine</b> was shown to cause lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage, glutathione (GSH) depletion, GSSG-formation and lipid peroxidation (LPO). A reactive metabolite, DEP-isocyanate, is most likely responsible for these undesired cytotoxic effects. Based on the observed cytotoxicity mechanisms, chemoprotection with several sulfhydryl-containing nucleophiles and antioxidants was investigated. The sulfhydryl nucleophiles; GSH, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and glutathione isopropylester (GSH-IP) protected almost completely against fotemustine-induced LDH-leakage and LPO. NAC and GSH protected partly against fotemustine-induced GSH-depletion. The antioxidant, vitamin E protected completely against fotemustine-induced LPO, but only partly against fotemustine-induced LDH-leakage and not against GSH-depletion. Ebselen, a peroxidase-mimetic organoselenium compound, did not show protective effects against the cytotoxicity of <b>fotemustine,</b> possibly because GSH is required for the bioactivation of ebselen. It is concluded that co-administration of sulfhydryl nucleophiles, in particular NAC and GSH-IP, possibly in combination with antioxidants, such as vitamin E, are effective against the toxicity of <b>fotemustine</b> in vitro.

Also, the impact of O 6 -methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status on <b>fotemustine</b> activity has never been explored in the clinical setting. Methods 40 patients with recurrent pretreated MG were identified as being treated with <b>fotemustine</b> at doses ranging from 65 mg/m 2 to 100 mg/m 2. Patients were classified into 3 groups according to the dose of <b>fotemustine</b> received, from the lowest dosage received in group A, to the highest in group C. Analysis of MGMT promoter methylation in tumor tissue was successfully performed in 19 patients. Results Overall, 20 % of patients responded to treatment, for a disease control rate (DCR, responses plus stabilizations) of 47. 5 %. Groups A and B experienced a response rate of 40 % and 26. 5 % respectively, while the corresponding value for group C was 10 %. Out of 19 patients, MGMT promoter was found methylated in 12 cases among which a DCR of 66. 5 % was observed. All 7 patients with unmethylated MGMT promoter were progressive to <b>fotemustine.</b> Conclusion Low-dose <b>fotemustine</b> at 65 – 75 mg/m 2 (induction phase) followed by 75 – 85 mg/m 2 (maintenance phase) has an activity comparable to that of the conventional schedule.

40|$|Malignant melanomas {{are highly}} {{resistant}} to chemotherapy. First-line chemotherapeutics used in melanoma therapy are the methylating agents dacarbazine (DTIC) and temozolomide (TMZ) and the chloroethylating agents BCNU and <b>fotemustine.</b> Here, we determined {{the mode of}} cell death in 11 melanoma cell lines upon exposure to TMZ and <b>fotemustine.</b> We show {{for the first time}} that TMZ induces apoptosis in melanoma cells, using therapeutic doses. For both TMZ and <b>fotemustine</b> apoptosis is the dominant mode of cell death. The contribution of necrosis to total cell death varied between 10 and 40 %. The O 6 -methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) activity in the cell lines was between 0 and 1100 [*]fmol[*]mg− 1 protein, and there was a correlation between MGMT activity and the level of resistance to TMZ and <b>fotemustine.</b> MGMT inactivation by O 6 -benzylguanine sensitized all melanoma cell lines expressing MGMT to TMZ and fotemustine-induced apoptosis, and MGMT transfection attenuated the apoptotic response. This supports that O 6 -alkylguanines are critical lesions involved in the initiation of programmed melanoma cell death. One of the cell lines (MZ 7), derived from a patient subjected to DTIC therapy, exhibited a high level of resistance to TMZ without expressing MGMT. This was related to an impaired expression of MSH 2 and MSH 6. The cells were not cross-resistant to <b>fotemustine.</b> Although these data indicate that methylating drug resistance of melanoma cells can be acquired by down-regulation of mismatch repair, a correlation between MSH 2 and MSH 6 expression in the different lines and TMZ sensitivity was not found. Apoptosis in melanoma cells induced by TMZ and <b>fotemustine</b> was accompanied by double-strand break (DSB) formation (as determined by H 2 AX phosphorylation) and caspase- 3 and - 7 activation as well as PARP cleavage. For TMZ, DSBs correlated significantly with the apoptotic response, whereas for <b>fotemustine</b> a correlation was not found. Melanoma lines expressing p 53 wild-type were more resistant to TMZ and <b>fotemustine</b> than p 53 mutant melanoma lines, which is in marked contrast to previous data reported for glioma cells treated with TMZ. Overall, the findings are in line with the model that in melanoma cells TMZ-induced O 6 -methylguanine triggers the apoptotic (and necrotic) pathway through DSBs, whereas for chloroethylating agents apoptosis is triggered in a more complex manner...|$|E

Primary endpoint was the best overall response rate; other endpoints were toxicity, time to progression (TTP), and overall survival (OS). Serum cytokines, angiogenesis, and lymphangiogenesis factors were monitored by multiplex arrays and by in vitro angiogenesis assays. Effects of <b>fotemustine</b> on melanoma cells, in vitro, on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) -C release and apoptosis were assessed by ELISA and flow cytometry, respectively. Results: One complete response, 2 partial responses (PR), and 10 patients with stable disease were observed. TTP and OS were 8. 3 and 20. 5 months, respectively. Fourteen patients experienced adverse events of toxicity grade 3 - 4. Serum VEGF-A levels in evaluated patients (n 15) and overall serum proangiogenic activity were significantly inhibited. A significant reduction in VEGF-C levels was found in several post-versus pretherapy serum samples. In vitro, <b>fotemustine</b> inhibited VEGF-C release by melanoma cells without inducing significant cell death.

These results (mean overall response rate 27 %) compared with reference regimes, demonstrate that DTIC is able to increase the alkylating power of fotemustine: same range of response rate with {{only half of the}} two drug doses compared to an alternated combination, high activity rate especially in lung metastases (10 / 42 complete responses + 13 / 42 partial responses), different pattern for haematotoxicity, and occurrence of a new side-effect: acute lung toxicity as adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This lung toxicity was totally unexpected since several hundreds of patients had been so far treated with <b>fotemustine</b> as single agent or in other combinations with DTIC without any case of acute or delayed lung toxicity.

40|$|Purpose: Uveal {{melanoma}} (UM) {{is associated}} with a high risk of metastases and lack of efficient therapies. Reduced capacity for apoptosis induction by chemotherapies is one obstacle to efficient treatments. Human UM is characterized by high expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl- 2.

In this aim, we have investigated the efficacy of the Bcl- 2 /Bcl-XL inhibitor S 44563 on 4 UM Patient-Derived Xenografts (PDXs) and derived-cell lines. Experimental Design: Four well characterized UM PDXs were used for in vivo experiments. S 44563 was administered alone or combined with <b>fotemustine</b> either concomitantly or after the alkylating agent. Bcl- 2, Bcl-XL, and Mcl- 1 expressions after S 44563 administration were evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Results: S 44563 administered alone by at 50 and 100 mg/kg i. p. induced a significant tumour growth inhibition in only one xenograft model with a clear dose effect. However, when S 44563 was concomitantly administered with <b>fotemustine,</b> we observed a synergistic activity in 3 out of the 4 tested models. In addition, S 44563 administered after <b>fotemustine</b> induced a tumour growth delay in 2 out of 3 tested xenografts. Finally, IHC analyses showed that Bcl- 2, Bcl-XL, and Mcl- 1 expression were not modified after S 44563 administration. Conclusion: The novel anti-apoptotic experimental compound S 44563, despite a relative low efficacy when administere...|$|E
40|$|Background: The DNA repair protein O 6 -alkylguanine-DNA alkyl {{transferase}} (AT) mediates {{resistance to}} chloroethylnitro-soureas. Agents depleting AT such as DTIC and its new analogue temozolomide (TMZ) can reverse resistance to chloro-ethylnitrosoureas. We report {{the results of}} a dose finding study of TMZ in association with <b>fotemustine.</b> Patients and methods: Twenty-four patients with metastatic melanoma or recurrent glioma were treated with escalating dose of oral or intravenous TMZ ranging from 300 to 700 mg/m 2, divided over two days. <b>Fotemustine</b> 100 mg/m 2 was given intravenously on day 2, 4 hours after TMZ. AT depletion was measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and in selected cases in melanoma metastases and was compared to TMZ pharmacokinetics. Results: The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of TMZ was 400 mg/m 2 (200 mg/m 2 /d) when associated with <b>fotemustine</b> the 2 nd day with myelosuppression as dose limiting toxicity. The decrease of AT level in PBMCs was progressive and reached 34 % of pretreatment values on day 2. There was however wide interindividual variability. AT reduction was neither dose nor route dependent and {{did not appear to be}} related to TMZ systemic exposure (AUC). In the same patients, AT depletion in tumour did not correlate with the decrease of AT observed in PBMCs. Conclusions: PBMCs may not be used as a surrogate of tumour for AT depletion. Further study should concentrate on the pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic relationship in tumour to provide the basis for individually tailored therap...|$|E
40|$|Aim: To test if <b>fotemustine</b> {{administrated}} at low doses {{during the}} maintenance phase of gioblastoma therapy could improve the toxicity profile, without reducing progression-free survival at six months (PFS- 6). Patients and Methods: Patients enrolled {{were affected by}} recurrent glioblastoma multiforme, proven by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), {{at least six months}} after radiochemotherapy completion. <b>Fotemustine</b> was administered at an induction dose of 100 mg/m(2) followed by a maintenance dose of 75 mg/m(2). Results: All 15 patients completed the induction phase. Eight patients began maintenance-phase therapy and received a median of three cycles (range= 2 - 6). Grade 3 or more haematological toxicity was not documented. The PFS- 6 was 5115 and the median overall survival was 7. 5 months. Conclusion: Haematological toxicity compares favourably with trials using the conventional scheme: no grade 3 - 4 adverse effects were recorded. This low-dose approach could be considered a compromise treatment whilst waiting for definitive standardization of second-line therapy, in order to reduce severe hematological toxicity...|$|E
40|$|Alkylating agents, such as {{temozolomide}} (TMZ) and <b>fotemustine</b> (FTM) {{are widely}} used in recurrent glioblastoma (GBM) regimes. Several strategies have been proposed to prevent resistance to these agents, by combining or sequencing them. We report {{the results of a}} pilot study of patients with refractory GBM receiving a regime of twice-daily dosing of temozolomide administered on day 1, (with an initial oral dose of 200 mg/m(2) and a second oral dose of 75 mg/m(2) 12 h later), followed by <b>fotemustine</b> in a single i. v. infusion at 75 mg/m(2) on day 2, repeated every four weeks. Enrolment was stopped at 15 patients due to lack of effectiveness of this schedule for patients with GBM. Toxicity was mild, with no grade 4 side effects reported. Results indicate that our temozolomide -FTM combined schedule is not effective, although well tolerated, in non responsive patients with GBM. Further strategies are required to improve the outcome of these patients...|$|E
40|$|Summary There is {{increasing}} experimental {{evidence to suggest}} that expression of 06 -alkylguanine-DNAalkyltransferase (ATase) is a major factor in resistance to dacarbazine (DTIC). We recently demonstrated a progressive ATase depletion in human peripheral lymphocytes with nadir levels occurring at 4 - 6 h after DTIC administration (Lee et al., 1991). Therefore in an attempt to improve the clinical response rate of DTIC, <b>fotemustine</b> was administered 4 h after DTIC administration; since in the case of <b>fotemustine,</b> ATase removes the chloroethyl lesions from the 06 -position of guanine, thereby preventing the formation of the cytotoxic cross-links. Sixty patients with widely metastatic melanoma received DTIC at 400, 500 or 800 mg m- 2 followed by <b>fotemustine</b> (100 mg m') at 4 h after DTIC administration. Treatment was repeated every 28 days with a total of 169 cycles of chemotherapy administered; 75, 57 and 37 treatment cycles with 400, 500 and 800 mg m 2 DTIC groups respectively. Eighteen of the 60 patients responded (with three complete response); response rates were linearly related to dose, being 24 %, 30 % and 40 % in patients receiving 400, 500 and 800 mg m- 2 of DTIC respectively and the overall response rate was 30 %. Median survival was 3. 6 months (range, 1 - 15 months) with no statistically significant difference between the different DTIC treatment groups (P = 0. 67). Nine patients are alive at 5 to 26 months (median 10 months); three patients with no tumour and five patients with stable disease. A statistically significant relationship was seen between the development o...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: Ocular {{melanoma}} {{is characterized}} by a high rate of liver metastases and is associated with a median survival time less than 5 months. There is no standard treatment available. Treatment strategies have, without success, relied on the experience with metastatic cutaneous melanoma. The only effective treatment is chemoembolization using cisplatin and polyvinyl sponge, which has never become accepted on a large scale. The objective {{of the study was to}} establish prospectively the efficacy and toxicity of hepatic intraarterial <b>fotemustine,</b> a third-generation nitrosourea, in patients with liver metastases from ocular melanoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-one patients were subjected to laparotomy to place a totally implantable catheter into the hepatic artery and received <b>fotemustine</b> 100 mg/m 2 as a 4 -hour infusion, first once a week for four times and then, after a 5 -week rest period, every 3 weeks until progression or toxicity. Cox regression models were used to assess the prognostic role of patient survival characteristics. RESULTS: Objective responses were observed in 12 of 30 assessable patients (40 %; 95 % confidence interval, 22 % to 59 %). The median duration of response was 11 months and the median overall survival time, 14 months. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) appeared to be the strongest prognostic factor for survival. Toxicity was minimal and treatment could be administered on an outpatient basis. CONCLUSION: The results of hepatic arterial chemotherapy with <b>fotemustine</b> produced a high response rate and survival similar to chemoembolization therapy. It involves no major toxicity and preserves the quality of life. To assess further its effectiveness, a randomized study to compare hepatic intraarterial versus intravenous chemotherapy is being planned...|$|E
40|$|Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), {{the highest}} grade {{malignant}} glioma, {{is associated with}} a grim prognosis— median overall survival is in the range 12 – 15 months, despite optimum treatment. Surgery to the maximum possible extent, external beam radiotherapy, and systemic temozolomide chemotherapy are current standard treatments for newly diagnosed GBM, with intracerebral delivery of carmustine wafers (Gliadel). Unfortunately, the effectiveness of chemotherapy can be hampered by the DNA repair enzyme O 6 -methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT), which confers resistance both to temozolomide and nitrosoureas, for example <b>fotemustine</b> and carmustine. MGMT activity can be measured by PCR and immunohistochemistry, with the former being the current validated technique. High-dose chemotherapy can deplete MGMT levels in GBM cells and has proved feasible in various trials on temozolomide, in both newly diagnosed and recurrent GBM. We here report the unique case of a GBM patient, with high MGMT expression by immunohistochemistry, who underwent an experimental, high-dose <b>fotemustine</b> schedule after surgery and radiotherapy. Although treatment caused two episodes of grade 3 – 4 thrombocytopenia, a complete response and survival of more than three years were achieved, with a 30...|$|E
40|$|Background: Melanoma {{remains largely}} {{resistant}} to currently available chemotherapy, and new strategies {{have been proposed}} to flank standardized therapeutic protocols {{in an effort to}} improve efficacy. Such an approach requires good knowledge of the mechanisms involved in the resistance and survival of melanoma cells. In this context, the SLUG gene has recently been characterized as a major regulator of melanocytes and melanoma cell survival. Methods: We tested the hypothesis that an oligonucleotide-based short interfering RNA (siRNA) directed against the SLUG gene increases the susceptibility of melanoma cells to drugs such as cisplatin and <b>fotemustine,</b> which are frequently used to treat this cancer. Results: It was found that SLUG siRNA increased cisplatin-induced cell death and rendered the drug active in vitro at half its plasmatic peak concentration. Such activity was correlated with an upregulation of the pro-apoptotic gene, PUMA. Furthermore, SLUG siRNA increased the capacity of <b>fotemustine</b> to elicit cell death and induced p 21 WAF 1 upregulation, resulting in cell cycle arrest. Interestingly, this pathway did not require functional p 53. Conclusion: These findings suggest that SLUG siRNA enhances the efficacy of two of the most widely used drugs to treat melanoma...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Isolated limb {{infusion}} (ILI) is {{a simple}} yet effective alternative to conventional isolated limb perfusion {{for the treatment of}} advanced melanoma of the extremities. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study group comprised 13 patients with very advanced limb disease who had failed to achieve a satisfactory response to one or more ILIs with melphalan, and in whom amputation was the only other realistic treatment option. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of ILI with <b>fotemustine</b> after systemic chemosensitisation with dacarbazine (DTIC). RESULTS: Complete remission was achieved in four patients and partial remission in eight patients, with a median response duration of 3 months. Limb salvage was achieved in five of 12 assessable patients (42 %). Limb toxicity peaked 9 days after ILI; two patients experienced Wieberdink grade IV (severe) toxicity and four patients had grade V toxicity (requiring early amputation). CONCLUSIONS: ILI with <b>fotemustine</b> after DTIC chemosensitisation can be successful when gross limb disease has not been controlled by one or more ILIs with melphalan. However, it cannot be recommended as a routine method of treatment for advanced melanoma of the extremities because of the high incidence of severe limb toxicity...|$|E
40|$|Background: In uveal {{melanoma}} (UM) with {{metastatic disease}} {{limited to the}} liver, the effect of an intrahepatic treatment on survival is unknown. We investigated prospectively the efficacy and toxicity of hepatic intra-arterial (HIA) versus systemic (IV) <b>fotemustine</b> in patients with liver metastases from UM. Patients and methods: Patients {{were randomly assigned to}} receive either IV or HIA <b>fotemustine</b> at 100 mg/m 2 on days 1, 8, 15 (and 22 in HIA arm only) as induction, and after a 5 -week rest period every 3 weeks as maintenance. Primary end point was overall survival (OS). Response rate (RR), progression-free survival (PFS) and safety were secondary end points. Results: Accrual was stopped after randomization of 171 patients {{based on the results of}} a futility OS analysis. A total of 155 patients died and 16 were still alive [median follow-up 1. 6 years (range 0. 25 - 6 years) ]. HIA did not improve OS (median 14. 6 months) when compared with the IV arm (median 13. 8 months), hazard ratio (HR) 1. 09; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 79 - 1. 50, log-rank P = 0. 59. However, there was a significant benefit on PFS for HIA compared with IV with a median of 4. 5 versus 3. 5 months, respectively (HR 0. 62; 95 % CI 0. 45 - 0. 84, log-rank P = 0. 002). The 1 -year PFS rate was 24 % in the HIA arm versus 8 % in the IV arm. An improved RR was seen in the HIA (10. 5 %) compared with IV treatment (2. 4 %). In the IV arm, the most frequent grade ≥ 3 toxicity was thrombocytopenia (42. 1 %) and neutropenia (62. 6 %), compared with 21. 2 % and 28. 7 % in the HIA arm. The main grade ≥ 3 toxicity related to HIA was catheter complications (12 %) and liver toxicity (4. 5 %) apart from two toxic deaths. Conclusion: HIA treatment with <b>fotemustine</b> did not translate into an improved OS compared with IV treatment, despite better RR and PFS. Intrahepatic treatment should still be considered as experimental. © The Author 2014. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the European Society for Medical Oncology.

40|$|There is {{increasing}} experimental {{evidence to suggest}} that endogenous expression of O 6 -alkylguanine-DNA-alkyltransferase (ATase) is a major factor in cellular resistance to certain chemotherapeutic agents including dacarbazine (DTIC). We have recently shown wide interindividual variation in the depletion and subsequent regeneration of ATase in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMCs) following DTIC and this has now been extended to ascertain whether or not depletion is related to dosage of DTIC used and repeated treatment cycles of chemotherapy. ATase levels were measured in three groups of 25 patients (pts) up to 24 h after receiving DTIC at 400 mg m- 2, 500 mg m- 2 or 800 mg m- 2. Each group also received <b>fotemustine</b> (100 mg m- 2), 4 h after DTIC. The lowest extent of ATase depletion (highest nadir ATase) was seen in patients receiving 400 mg m- 2. The mean nadir ATase, expressed as a percentage of pre-treatment ATase, was respectively 56. 3 %, 26. 4 % and 23. 9 % for 400 mg m- 2, 500 mg m- 2 and 800 mg m- 2. The median nadir of ATase activity for pts receiving 800 mg m- 2 pts was at 4 - 6 h and for pts given lower doses it was at 2 - 3 h. In addition, repeated measures analysis of variance of observations before chemotherapy, then at 2, 3, 4, 6 and 18 h after chemotherapy provides some evidence that ATase was depleted to a lesser extent after cycle 1 than after subsequent cycles (P = 0. 025). It also provides evidence that the change in ATase activity over time varied with dose and cycle. The findings can be interpreted {{on the basis of a}} dosage-dependent metabolism of DTIC to an agent capable of methylation of DNA and subsequent depletion of PMC ATase: with higher DTIC doses, the extent of ATase depletion may be limited by the pharmacokinetics of DTIC metabolism. PMC ATase was measured in another group of 8 pts at various times after receiving only <b>fotemustine</b> (100 mg m- 2) and in contrast to DTIC, no ATase depletion was seen suggesting that insufficient concentrations of <b>fotemustine</b> and/or its metabolites were available to react with DNA to produce a depletion of PMC ATase activity...|$|E

A statistically significant relationship was seen between the development of severe haematological toxicity (WHO > or = 3) with increasing dosage of DTIC and significant subclinical pulmonary damage was seen in 11 patients where the lung function was monitored during the course of treatment. In conclusion, it appears that with this small group of patients, escalation of DTIC dosage might not significantly affect response rates but does increase haematological toxicity. The present study provides a framework for other studies in an attempt to modulate ATase-mediated drug resistance in tumour tissues but the associated toxicity will need careful monitoring...|$|E
