Monetary policy in a simplified analysis amount to the determination of the optimal quantity of money or in a "dynamic" sense, the optimal rate of growth money stock in an economy. But there is more to monetary policy than the impact of monetary policy on macroeconomic outcome in Nigeria, so as to draw useful lessons from her inception. In demonstrating the application of ordinary least square method, the multiple linear regression analysis will be used with gross domestic product, inflation rate while exchange rate, interest rate and money supply as the explanatory variables. The data for the study was therefore obtained form the Central Bank of Nigeria publications.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we first analyze {{theoretically}} how the <b>investment</b> <b>climate</b> {{can affect the}} impact of corporate taxation on investment in a simple tax competition model where the corporate tax revenues are used to improve the <b>investment</b> <b>climate.</b> We find that an improvement of the <b>investment</b> <b>climate</b> increases the sensitivity of capital to the tax rate if the <b>investment</b> <b>climate</b> is very {{effective at enhancing the}} productivity of capital or if the <b>investment</b> <b>climate</b> enhances the productivity of capital much more when the initial <b>investment</b> <b>climate</b> is unattractive than when the initial <b>investment</b> <b>climate</b> is already attractive. As a result, the model calls for the estimation of an investment equation where the tax variable is moderated by an <b>investment</b> <b>climate</b> variable. We estimate such an investment equation using a unique panel dataset of effective corporate tax rates of 80 countries, including countries with an unattractive and countries with an attractive <b>investment</b> <b>climate,</b> for the period 2005 - 2008. We find two important results. First, a better <b>investment</b> <b>climate</b> increases the sensitivity of FDI to the tax rate. Second, in the worst <b>investment</b> <b>climate</b> countries, FDI reacts not negatively to a rise in the tax rate. These results have important policy implications. For bad <b>investment</b> <b>climate</b> countries it is ineffective to lower the tax rate to compensate for the bad <b>investment</b> <b>climate.</b> Instead, these countries should focus on improving the basic <b>investment</b> <b>climate.</b> tax competition, <b>investment</b> <b>climate,</b> developing countries, Foreign Direct Investment, corporate tax...|$|R

40|$|Judging by the {{provisions}} of its investment code and the apparent stability of the macro-economy, Ethiopia seems to offer a <b>favourable</b> <b>investment</b> <b>climate</b> for the private sector. However, Ethiopian manufacturing has experienced a declining rate of investment since the mid 1990 s. Like other Sub-Saharan African countries, {{more than half of}} manufacturing firms in Ethiopia have zero investment episodes; episodes that have become more persistent over time. This contrasts badly with high average profit rates in African manufacturing relative to average profit rates in OECD countries. Rather than being smooth and continuous, firm level investment in Africa is less frequent and lumpy. While this pattern of capital adjustment is not unique to Africa, the discontinuity and lumpiness is starker than what is observed in developed countries. The evidence in this paper suggests that such discontinuity and the lacklustre investment performance {{have more to do with}} uncertainty and irreversibility. The paper shows that uncertainty, proxied by the volatility of profits, undermines mainly the likelihood rather than the rate of investment.
