25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} types <b>of</b> <b>grants</b> <b>of</b> representation, each one designed to cover a particular circumstance. The most common cover the two most common situations—either the deceased died leaving a valid will or they did not. If someone left a valid will, {{it is more than}} likely that the grant is a <b>grant</b> <b>of</b> <b>probate.</b> If there was no will, the grant required {{is likely to be a}} <b>grant</b> <b>of</b> administration. There are many other grants that can be required in certain circumstances, and many have technical Latin names, but the general public is most likely to encounter <b>grants</b> <b>of</b> <b>probate</b> or administration. If an estate has a value of less than £5,000.00 or if all assets are held jointly and therefore pass by survivorship, for example to a surviving spouse, a grant is not usually required.|$|R
25|$|Only the executor(s) of a Will {{can apply}} for a <b>Grant</b> <b>of</b> <b>Probate.</b> It {{is the duty of}} the executor(s) of the will to obtain probate in a timely manner.

50|$|Malory died on 14 March 1471 and {{was buried}} in Christ Church Greyfriars, near Newgate Prison.

50|$|Shee opened Richard's case by {{presenting}} {{the background of}} the Roupell family property, William's financial difficulties and the alleged facts of the frauds and forgeries. Shee argued that the will must be a forgery as, purporting to be witnessed by William, William could not have been present to witness its execution on the said date. Shee called William who admitted the frauds and forgeries and his own perjury in the <b>grant</b> <b>of</b> <b>probate</b> <b>of</b> his father's estate. It was to have been Waite's defence that William was colluding with his brother Richard, possibly in return for some compensation, but the defence was never heard as the case settled, dividing the value of the estate between Waite and Richard Roupell.|$|R

50|$|A {{stamp duty}} was first {{introduced}} in England in 1694 following the Dutch model as An act for granting to Their Majesties several duties on Vellum, Parchment and Paper for 10 years, towards carrying on the war against France (5 & 6 Will. & Mar. c. 21). The duty ranged between 1 penny to several shillings {{on a number of}} different legal documents including insurance policies, documents used as evidence in courts, <b>grants</b> <b>of</b> honour, <b>grants</b> <b>of</b> <b>probate</b> and letters <b>of</b> administration.

2500|$|The {{persons who}} are {{actually}} given the job {{of dealing with the}} deceased's assets are called [...] "personal representatives" [...] or [...] "PRs".

So, executors obtain a <b>grant</b> <b>of</b> <b>probate</b> that permits them to deal with the estate and administrators obtain a <b>grant</b> <b>of</b> administration that lets them do the same. Apart from that distinction, the function of executors and administrators is exactly the same.|$|R

25|$|The <b>granting</b> <b>of</b> <b>probate</b> is {{the first}} step in the legal process of {{administering}} the estate of a deceased person, resolving all claims and distributing the deceased person's property under a will. A probate court decides the legal validity of a testator's (deceased person's) will and grants its approval, also known as granting probate, to the executor. The probated will then becomes a legal instrument that may be enforced by the executor in the law courts if necessary. A probate also officially appoints the executor (or personal representative), generally named in the will, as having legal power to dispose of the testator's assets in the manner specified in the testator's will. However, through the probate process, a will may be contested.|$|R
