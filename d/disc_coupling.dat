Couplings in this category were retrofitted on two compressor trains at a large ethylene plant. The couplings were a 44, 000 hp multiple convolution flexible <b>disc</b> <b>coupling</b> and a 25, 000 hp bolted disc pack flexible <b>disc</b> <b>coupling.</b> The installations were retrofits, as part of a program to uprate the compressor trains beyond the original mechanical ratings, at a minimum cost and with limited machine downtime. The user had overall engineering responsibility for selection of the type of coupling, and performance of the total installation. Selection of the coupling type, coordination meetings, design audits, quality control and installation procedures, and contingency plans were done with the full cooperation of the coupling, compressor, and turbine vendors. This resulted in uprating the trains with a high degree of reliability made possible by the careful application of these types of couplings. Based on experience gained from these installations, the following are problem areas: ? Multi-convolution coupling application ? Disc pack coupling application ?

40|$|LecturePg. 67 - 78 A case is {{presented}} where significant unacceptable vibration levels were encountered during mechanical testing {{of a single}} stage overhung radial compressor used in a mechanical vapor recompression process. The contract high performance <b>disc</b> <b>coupling</b> (modified for use between a test gearbox and the overhung compressor) {{was one of the}} main focuses of attention in arriving at a solution to the problem. Presented is the logic and courses of action taken to eliminate the coupling as the cause of the excessive vibration, and the analysis used to modify the coupling to make it the major part of the solution. This resolution involved significantly increasing the coupling's weight to change the critical speeds of the compressor rotor/bearing/coupling system, while at the same time improving the damping and stability in the coupling end bearing; enough to allow the train to run successfully. However, this extra weight coupling solution was not normal, and, except for time considerations, would not have been attempted. So, also discussed is how the actual problem (running at a critical speed without adequate damping) could have been discovered in the design stage or, once the problem occurred, been solved more easily if API procedures and guidelines had been referenced and used...|$|E
40|$|When {{the cold}} {{accretion}} <b>disc</b> <b>coupling</b> between neutral gas and {{a magnetic field}} is so weak that the magnetorotational instability is less effective or even stops working, it is of prime interest to investigate the pure hydrodynamic origin of turbulence and transport phenomena. As the Reynolds number increases, {{the relative importance of}} the non-linear term in the hydrodynamic equation increases. In an accretion disc where the molecular viscosity is too small, the Reynolds number is large enough for the non-linear term to have new effects. We investigate the scenario of the `weakly non-linear' evolution of the amplitude of the linear mode when the flow is bounded by two parallel walls. The unperturbed flow is similar to the plane Couette flow, but with the Coriolis force included in the hydrodynamic equation. Although there is no exponentially growing eigenmode, because of the self-interaction, the least stable eigenmode will grow in an intermediate phase. Later, this will lead to higher-order non-linearity and plausible turbulence. Although the non-linear term in the hydrodynamic equation is energy-conserving, within the weakly non-linear analysis it is possible to define a lower bound of the energy (alpha A(c) (2), where A(c) is the threshold amplitude) needed for the flow to transform to the turbulent phase. Such an unstable phase is possible only if the Reynolds number >= 10 (3 - 4). The numerical difficulties in obtaining such a large Reynolds number might be the reason for the negative result of numerical simulations on a pure hydrodynamic Keplerian accretion disc...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} first {{study of the}} effect of local photoionising {{radiation}} on gas cooling in smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of galaxy formation. We explore the combined effect of ionising radiation from young and old stellar populations. The method computes the effect of multiple radiative sources using the same tree algorithm used for gravity, so it is computationally efficient and well resolved. The method foregoes calculating absorption and scattering in favour of a constant escape fraction for young stars to keep the calculation efficient enough to simulate the entire evolution of a galaxy in a cosmological context to the present day. This allows us to quantify the effect of the local photoionisation feedback through the whole history of a galaxy`s formation. The simulation of a Milky Way like galaxy using the local photoionisation model forms ~ 40 % less stars than a simulation that only includes a standard uniform background UV field. The local photoionisation model decreases star formation by increasing the cooling time of the gas in the halo and increasing the equilibrium temperature of dense gas in the <b>disc.</b> <b>Coupling</b> the local radiation field to gas cooling from the halo provides a preventive feedback mechanism which keeps the central disc light and produces slowly rising rotation curves without resorting to extreme feedback mechanisms. These preliminary results indicate that the effect of local photoionising sources is significant and should not be ignored in models of galaxy formation.

40|$|Active pre-main-sequence {{binaries}} with separations {{of around}} ten stellar radii present {{a wealth of}} phenomena unobserved in common systems. The study of these objects is extended from Classical T Tauri stars to the Herbig Ae star HD 104237. Spectro-interferometry with the VLTI/AMBER is presented. It is found that the K-band continuum squared visibilities are compatible with a circumbinary disc with a radius of 0. 5 AU. However, a significant fraction (50 per cent) of the flux is unresolved and not fully accounted by the stellar photospheres. The stars probably don't hold circumstellar discs, {{in addition to the}} circumbinary disk, due to the combined effects of inner magnetospheric truncation and outer tidal truncation. This unresolved flux likely arises in compact structures inside the tidally disrupted circumbinary disc. Most (≳ 90 per cent) of the Br gamma line emission is unresolved. The line-to-continuum spectro-astrometry shifts in time, along the direction of the Ly alpha jet known to be driven by the system. The shift is anti-correlated with the Br gamma equivalent width. It is shown that the unresolved Br gamma emission cannot originate in the jet but instead is compatible with stellar emission from the orbiting binary components. The increase in the absolute value of the equivalent width of the line takes place at periastron passage; it could arise in an accretion burst, a flare or in the increase in effective size of the emission region by the interaction of the magnetospheres. The binary longitude of the ascending node is found to be Ω=(235 ± 3) and the orbit retrograde. The origin of the jet is revisited. The tidal disruption of the circumstellar disks creates difficulties to ejection models that rely on stellar magnetosphere and <b>disc</b> <b>coupling.</b> A scenario of a stellar wind collimated by a circumbinary disc wind is suggested.

40|$|Abstract: With the {{worldwide}} trend {{of controlling the}} utilization of fossil fuels inducing global climate change, many efforts {{will have to be}} made on securing a sustainable energy supply. Tidal current is a concentrated form of gravitational energy, its resource is significant, but limited locations. To effectively capture tidal cur-rent energy from the sea, a group of tidal turbines should be formed and positioned with optimal size and spacing for absorbing from multiple points. Thus, the flow field including turbines becomes a huge domain, a so-called tidal farm. It can be very convenient technically and economically if a whole turbine farm is simu-lated by means of actuator disc thoery. So, the analysis method using actuator <b>discs</b> <b>coupled</b> with a solution of Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations is adopted for actual tidal turbines. Actuator discs have regions where similar forces imposed by actual turbines are applied to a flow. As working in group for-mation, turbines naturally have interaction effects on one another. Therefore, the present paper investigate the evaluation on the operating performance of tidal farm in terms of the mutual influence among turbine units with various lateral and longitudinal spacing. Authors expect that {{results of the present study}} contribute to the development of tidal farm for the future potential energy...|$|R

40|$|The early {{recording}} of Maltese folk and popular {{music in the}} interwar period is a largely forgotten, yet significant part of local, musicological and socio-political history. Almost erased from local memory, through the gradual demise of the obsolete playback machines and the shellac and vinyl records, is a story of music and musicians, who along with local agents and international record labels, made history by documenting local music in the vernacular, or local dialect prevalent at the time. The impetus to record Maltese music came in early 1931, when the music establishments in Valletta were thriving businesses. At the time, music played back on 78 rpm records and gramophones was a popular pastime. The music on the Maltese records attests to a vibrant musical activity present in Malta at the time. The local journals and newspapers gave witness to an unfolding phenomenon, which would entertain the people for decades to come.

40|$|We {{formulate}} a general, steady-state {{model for the}} torque on a magnetized star from a surrounding accretion disc. For the first time, we include the opening of dipolar magnetic field lines due to the differential rotation between the star and disc, so the magnetic topology then depends {{on the strength of}} the magnetic <b>coupling</b> to the <b>disc.</b> This <b>coupling</b> is determined by the effective slip rate of magnetic field lines that penetrate the diffusive <b>disc.</b> Stronger <b>coupling</b> (i. e., lower slip rate) leads to a more open topology and thus to a weaker magnetic torque on the star from the disc. In the expected strong coupling regime, we find that the spin-down torque on the star is more than an order of magnitude smaller than calculated by previous models. We also use our general approach to examine the equilibrium (`disc-locked') state, in which the net torque on the star is zero. In this state, we show that the stellar spin rate is roughly an order of magnitude faster than predicted by previous models. This challenges the idea that slowly-rotating, accreting protostars are disc locked. Furthermore, when the field is sufficiently open (e. g., for mass accretion rates > 5 x 10 ^{- 9 } M_sun / yr, for typical accreting protostars), the star will receive no magnetic spin-down torque from the disc at all. We therefore conclude that protostars must experience a spin-down torque from a source that has not yet been considered in the star-disc torque models [...] possibly from a stellar wind along the open field lines.

The gas disc is threaded across by a vertical magnetic field B_z with a constant dimensionless isopedic ratio λ≡ 2 π√(G) Σ^(g) /B_z of surface gas mass density Σ^(g) to B_z with G being the gravitational constant. Our exploration {{focuses on the}} relation between λ and the dark matter amount represented by a ratio f≡Φ̅/Φ in order to sustain stationary perturbation configurations, where Φ̅ is the gravitational potential of a presumed axisymmetric halo of dark matter and Φ is the gravitational potential of the composite disc matter. High and low λ values correspond to relatively weak and strong magnetic fields given the same gas surface mass density, respectively. The main goal of our model analysis is to reveal the relation between isopedic magnetic fields and dark matter halo in spiral galaxies with globally stationary perturbation configurations. Our results show that, fairly strong yet realistic magnetic fields require a considerably larger amount of dark matter in aligned and unaligned cases than weak or moderate magnetic field strengths. We discuss astrophysical and cosmological implications of our findings. For examples, patterns and pattern speeds of galaxies may change {{during the course of}} galactic evolution.

The emission has a ring-like morphology, with a peak at ∼ 30 - 50 au and an inferred column density of ∼ 3 - 6 × 10 ^ 12 cm^- 2. A low CH_ 3 OH fractional abundance of ∼ 0. 3 - 4 × 10 ^- 11 (with respect to H_ 2) is derived, depending on the assumed vertical location of the CH_ 3 OH molecular layer. In this study, we use a thermo-chemical model of the TW Hya <b>disc,</b> <b>coupled</b> with the ALCHEMIC gas-grain chemical model, assuming laboratory-motivated, fast diffusivities of the surface molecules to interpret the CH_ 3 OH detection. Based on this disc model, we performed radiative transfer calculations with the LIME code and simulations of the observations with the CASA simulator. We found that our model allows to reproduce the observations well. The CH_ 3 OH emission in our model appears as a ring with radius of ∼ 60 au. Synthetic and observed line flux densities are equal within the rms noise level of observations. The synthetic CH_ 3 OH spectra calculated assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) can differ by up to a factor of 3. 5 from the non-LTE spectra. For the strongest lines, the differences between LTE and non-LTE flux densities are very small and practically negligible. Variations in the diffusivity of the surface molecules can lead to variations of the CH_ 3 OH abundance and, therefore, line flux densities by an order of magnitude.
