From this aspect, it is aimed at this research that to evaluate {{the effects of}} the <b>economic</b> <b>freedoms</b> on the long termed economic growth performances and income level differences of EU and COMCEC countries which have different statuses in terms of <b>economic</b> <b>freedoms</b> and income level indicators.

Moreover, the existence of a one-way causality relation operates from <b>economic</b> <b>freedoms</b> to the <b>economic</b> growth in EU countries is specified while there is any causality link found between these <b>freedoms</b> and the <b>economic</b> growth for the countries in COMCEC group. All these results indicate that also the <b>economic</b> <b>freedoms</b> besides the physical human capital accumulation, in other words, whether the EU and COMCEC countries have a market economy adopts outward-oriented liberal fiscal policies plays a major role in differentiating the income levels or the economic growth performances. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} impact of bank consolidation (market power) and country-level institutional development on macroeconomic performance. In general, the empirical results from a sample of commercial banks in 11 Asian countries over the period 2002 - 2007, show that greater bank market power enhances macroeconomic performance, which {{would not be the}} case as <b>economic</b> <b>freedoms</b> increase. If we consider different economic sectors, greater bank market power only enhances tradable sector growth, but impedes non-tradable sector growth. On the contrary, as <b>economic</b> <b>freedoms</b> increase, greater bank market power deteriorates tradable sector growth, but boosts non-tradable sector growth. In countries with higher <b>economic</b> <b>freedoms,</b> therefore, enhancing bank competition is necessary, since greater bank market power impedes productive growth through tradable sector and spurs booms in non-tradable sector, which may result in an increase in speculations. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the author {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} fundamental rights and <b>economic</b> <b>freedoms</b> {{in the light of}} Article 6 TEU, in particular after the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union was given binding legal effect equal to the one of the Treaties. The author underlines the fact that striking a balance between <b>economic</b> <b>freedoms</b> and fundamental rights is not a recent development in European Union law; on the contrary, such a delicate question is often raised before the European Court of Justice since its earliest decisions. Never the less, the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, by recognizing the importance of non-economic values in the European Union, may suggest new solutions to old problems. The author distinguishes between two categories of ECJ decisions: in the first one, the protection of fundamental rights prevails over measures which are adopted by Member States and are in breach of the <b>economic</b> <b>freedoms</b> granted by the Treaties (ERT, Carpenter); on the other hand, the protection of fundamental rights is used ’as a shield’ by Member States, in order to justify restrictions to the <b>economic</b> <b>freedoms</b> guaranteed by the Treaty (Omega). Furthermore, this paper also points out that the search for a balance between <b>economic</b> <b>freedoms</b> and fundamental rights is crucial not only in the provisions of the Treaties themselves and in the decisions of the Court, but also in the process of adoption of secondary European law. Some examples are given by reference to directives adopted in different sectors falling under the competence of the E...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the role of}} economic development in curbing corruption by focusing on political and <b>economic</b> <b>freedoms</b> for a sample of Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) countries over the period 1984 - 2013.

The results reveal that the interactive relationship between <b>economic</b> and political <b>freedoms</b> and government size leads {{to a reduction in}} corruption. Furthermore, our results show robust support to suggest that an increase in income increases corruption in natural-resource-rich countries.

40|$|ABSTRACT. This article {{shows how}} the {{substantive}} bias {{at the core of}} the present socio-economic constitution of the European Union is directly related to the characterization of <b>economic</b> <b>freedoms</b> (crucially, the right to freedom of establishment of corporations and the free movement of capital) as the key yardstick of European constitutionality. An empirically grounded reconstruction of the way in which the European Court of Justice applies the proportionality principle shows that the Luxembourg judges (1) assign the argumentative benefit to the holders of <b>economic</b> <b>freedoms,</b> (2) construct all other constitutional goods in the semblance of <b>economic</b> <b>freedoms,</b> and (3) use asymmetric proof standards when having to justify the adequacy and necessity of <b>economic</b> <b>freedoms</b> and other constitutional goods. As a result, under the cloth of projecting the way in which national constitutional courts review the constitutionality of legislation to the supranational level, the European Court of Justice has radically altered the substance of European constitutional law. In particular, the right to private property and entrepreneurial freedom (as operationalized through the four <b>economic</b> <b>freedoms</b> and the principle of undistorted competition) have been assigned an abstract and a concrete constitutional weight that places key public policies (social policies, tax policies, regulatory policies) off the realm of what is constitutionally possible. As a result, some of the collective goods {{at the core of the}} Democratic and Social Rechtsstaat have become extremely vulnerable. Focusing on the proportionality as practice by the European Court of Justice does not only provide us with insights into the nature and substance of European law, but also contributes to the general theoretical understanding of the principle of proportionality itself, in particular to a more detailed reconstruction of the relevant steps in proportionality review...|$|R
