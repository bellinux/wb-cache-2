40|$|Since its {{introduction}} a century ago, isotope dilution analysis {{has played a}} central role in developments of analytical chemistry. This method has witnessed many elaborations and developments over the years. To date, we have single, double, and even triple isotope <b>dilution</b> <b>methods.</b> In this manuscript, we summarize the conceptual aspects of isotope <b>dilution</b> <b>methods</b> and introduce the quadruple dilution and the concept of exact matching triple and quadruple dilutions. The comparison of isotope <b>dilution</b> <b>methods</b> is performed by determination of bromide ions in groundwater using novel ethyl-derivatization chemistry in conjunction with GC/MS. We show that the benefits of higher-order isotope <b>dilution</b> <b>methods</b> are countered with a greater need for careful experimental design of the isotopic blends.

50|$|Single <b>dilution</b> <b>method</b> {{requires}} {{the knowledge of}} the isotopic composition of the isotopically-enriched analyte (RB) and the amount of the enriched analyte added (nB). Both of these variables are hard to establish since isotopically-enriched substances are generally available in small quantities of questionable purity. As a result, before isotope dilution is performed on the sample, the amount of the enriched analyte is ascertained beforehand using isotope dilution. This preparatory step is called the reverse isotope dilution and it involves a standard of natural isotopic-composition analyte (denoted as A*). First proposed in the 1940s and further developed in the 1950s, reverse isotope dilution remains an effective means of characterizing a labeled material.|$|E

In addition, unlike traditional analytical methods which rely on signal intensity, isotope dilution employs signal ratios. Owing to both of these advantages, the method of isotope dilution is regarded among chemistry measurement methods of the highest metrological standing.|$|E
