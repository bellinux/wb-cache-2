40|$|A large {{literature}} examines men s {{unemployment and}} their wives labor-market participation. In response to her <b>husband</b> <b>s</b> unemployment, a woman may adjust her labor supplied to household production {{as well as to}} the market. This article tests for this effect and measures its impact using the U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Cost of Living survey of 1917 1919. Households altered both household-production decisions and the wife s labor supplied to the market in response to the <b>husband</b> <b>s</b> unemployment. But the household-production-response effect was smaller than the added-worker effect, in terms of women s labor hours and household consumption. ...|$|R

40|$|Among other things, the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s {{decision}} in Morrison v.

Prior to the 1980 s the constitutionality of the independent agencies had generally been thought secure on the strength of Humphrey 2 ̆ 7 s Executor. Despite recurrent criticism of that decision, there was no basis to think it was especially vulnerable. The Court 2 ̆ 7 s recent fascination with separation of powers, however, invited speculation about some radical reconstruction in administrative law, notably ineluding deconstruction of the independent agencies...|$|R

40|$|A {{successful}} {{execution of}} a Business Process (BP) is possible only if the proper coordination exists between (1) BP 2 ̆ 7 s execution policy, (2) BP 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>authorization</b> policy, and (3) the authorization policies of BP 2 ̆ 7 s resources. Hence, {{there is a need}} of an effective authorization model that brings all types of policies together for a BP executing successfully without breaking any authorization and business rules. This paper proposes a Petri-Net process model, Process-Aware Service-Oriented Authorization Control Net (PASOAC-Net). PASOAC-Net is developed based on the conceptual model PASOAC, an extension of Role Based Access Control (RBAC), which takes both resources and users into account. A set of authorization constraints is designed in PASOAC to coordinate the user access and the resource support in a process environment. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012...|$|R
