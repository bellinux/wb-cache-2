5|$|A diver {{missing a}} {{required}} decompression stop {{increases the risk}} of developing decompression sickness. The risk is related to the depth and duration of the missed stops. The usual causes for missing stops are: not having enough breathing gas to complete the stops, or accidentally losing control of buoyancy. An aim of most basic diver training is to prevent these two faults. There are also less predictable causes of missing decompression stops. <b>Diving</b> <b>suit</b> failure in cold water may force the diver to choose between hypothermia and decompression sickness. Diver injury or marine animal attack may also limit the duration of stops the diver is willing to carry out.|$|E
5|$|In Washington, Walter Skinner tells agent Dana Scully {{that the}} FBI's {{investigation}} into her sister's murder {{has been made}} inactive, despite the evidence that had been recovered. Fox Mulder tells Scully about the Piper Maru, which had laid anchor at the same coordinates as another ship believed to have salvaged a UFO; when the Piper Maru came to port in San Diego, her crew was found suffering from radiation burns. Aboard the ship, the agents find traces of the black oil on Gauthier's <b>diving</b> <b>suit.</b> Upon viewing a video of the dive, Scully identifies the sunken plane as a P-51 Mustang. Meanwhile, Gauthier returns home and searches for something. When his wife Joan arrives, the black oil passes itself along to her.|$|E
5|$|A scuba diver moves {{underwater}} {{by using}} fins {{attached to the}} feet; external propulsion can be provided by a diver propulsion vehicle, or a towboard pulled from the surface. Other equipment includes a diving mask to improve underwater vision, a protective <b>diving</b> <b>suit,</b> equipment to control buoyancy, and equipment related to the specific circumstances and purpose of the dive. Scuba divers are trained in the procedures and skills appropriate to their level of certification by instructors affiliated to the diver certification organisations which issue these diver certifications. These include standard operating procedures for using the equipment {{and dealing with the}} general hazards of the underwater environment, and emergency procedures for self-help and assistance of a similarly equipped diver experiencing problems. A minimum level of fitness and health is required by most training organisations, and a higher level of fitness may be needed for some applications.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Diving</b> <b>suits</b> can {{be divided}} into two classes: [...] "soft" [...] or ambient {{pressure}} <b>diving</b> <b>suits</b> - examples are wetsuits, dry suits, semi-dry <b>suits</b> and <b>dive</b> skins, and [...] "hard" [...] or atmospheric pressure <b>diving</b> <b>suits</b> - armored suits that keep the diver at atmospheric pressure at any depth within the operating range of the suit.|$|R

5|$|Alan regains {{consciousness}} a week later, apparently having driven his car off the road, {{but with}} no memory of how he got there. He starts to head back towards town, but his progress is hampered by shadowy figures that try to kill him. He observes a strange figure in a <b>diving</b> <b>suit</b> who reminds him of his earlier dream and how to fight the shadows with light. Alan fights through the shadows while finding pages of a manuscript titled Departure with {{his name on the}} by-line, a work he had not written. Eventually making it to town, Alan tries to alert Sheriff Sarah Breaker of his wife's disappearance, but Sarah states that there has been no island or cabin in Cauldron lake for years after it sunk following a volcanic eruption years prior. Sarah contacts the FBI to investigate Alice's disappearance, while Alan arranges for Barry to come and help.|$|E
5|$|Michelle {{undergoes}} a session of regression hypnosis, where she {{claims to be}} twenty-four years old. She suddenly starts screaming in panic about someone trying to kill her, and the session is ended. Mulder reviews the video of the session, and {{is convinced that the}} girl is the reincarnation of Morris, having been conceived right around the time the detective was murdered. The tape contains a brief section of static noise just before Michelle begins screaming, which Mulder has an expert clean up. The noise is found to contain a grainy image of {{what appears to be a}} fish tank ornament of a man in an atmospheric <b>diving</b> <b>suit.</b> Meanwhile, Scully has tracked down Morris' autopsy findings, which show the presence of salt water in his respiratory tract, indicating he died of drowning. The agents realise from these findings that Morris was drowned in the exotic fish tank in Fiore's house.|$|E
5|$|Calculus' shark-shaped {{submarine}} was visually {{based on}} a real American submarine; Hergé had seen a picture of this in a German newspaper. The <b>diving</b> <b>suit</b> worn in the story was also based on clippings that Hergé had accumulated. Similarly, the dockside bar depicted by the cartoonist was {{based on a}}n illustration that he had collected. The shop where Haddock and Tintin buy the diving equipment, including the suit, was inspired from a picture of a bar which was featured in the German magazine, Berliner Illustrirte Zeitung. The tribal effigy found on a Caribbean island by Sir Francis Haddock was based on a Bamileke tribal statue from Cameroon that Hergé saw in a museum. The Sirius, which had appeared before in The Shooting Star, was named after the SS Sirius, the first ship to cross the Atlantic Ocean solely under steam power, but was visually based upon the design of a trawler, the John-O.88. Hergé had sketched this ship in Ostend docks before obtaining both detailed plans of the trawler from the builders, Jos Boel & Son, and a small-scale model of it from a collector. The undersea wreck of the Unicorn was loosely inspired by images of the wreck of a 17th-century Swedish vessel, the Vasa, which Hergé had collected. The instance in the story in which a shark swallows a large box (that the characters hope contains the treasure) is based on a real account of a shark that swallowed a camera from the American underwater photographer Otis Barton, which Hergé had encountered in a French illustrated magazine.|$|E

25|$|A <b>diving</b> <b>suit</b> is {{a garment}} or device {{designed}} to protect a diver from the underwater environment. A <b>diving</b> <b>suit</b> may also incorporate a breathing gas supply (i.e. Standard diving dress or atmospheric <b>diving</b> <b>suit).</b> {{but in most cases}} applies only to the environmental protective covering worn by the diver. The breathing gas supply is usually referred to separately. There is no generic term for the combination of suit and breathing apparatus alone. It is generally referred to as diving equipment or dive gear along with any other equipment necessary for the dive.|$|E

25|$|While Leonardo {{was working}} in Venice, he drew a sketch for an early <b>diving</b> <b>suit,</b> {{to be used in}} the {{destruction}} of enemy ships entering Venetian waters. A suit was constructed for a BBC documentary using pigskin treated with fish oil to repel water. The head was covered by a helmet with two eyeglasses at the front. A breathing tube of bamboo with pigskin joints was attached to the back of the helmet and connected to a float of cork and wood. When the scuba divers tested the suit, they found it to be a workable precursor to a modern <b>diving</b> <b>suit,</b> the cork float acting as a compressed air chamber when submerged.|$|E
25|$|A belt made {{of rubber}} with {{traditional}} pin buckle {{is called a}} Marseillaise belt. These belts are popular with freedivers as the rubber contracts on descent as the <b>diving</b> <b>suit</b> and lungs are compressed, keeping the belt tight throughout the dive.|$|E

25|$|In the 1830s the Deane {{brothers}} asked Siebe {{to apply}} his skill {{to improve their}} underwater helmet design. Expanding on improvements already made by another engineer, George Edwards, Siebe produced his own design; a helmet fitted to a full length watertight canvas <b>diving</b> <b>suit.</b> The real success of the equipment was a valve in the helmet.|$|E
25|$|Ankle weights, {{which are}} {{typically}} about 1lb./0.5kg of shot, {{are used to}} counteract the positive buoyancy of <b>diving</b> <b>suit</b> leggings, made worse in drysuits by the migration of the internal bubble of air to the feet, and positively buoyant fins. Some divers prefer negatively buoyant fins. The additional effort needed when finning with ankle weights or heavy fins increases the diver's gas consumption.|$|E

25|$|The {{atmospheric}} <b>diving</b> <b>suit</b> {{is a small}} one-man submersible of anthropomorphic {{form with}} elaborate pressure joints to allow articulation while maintaining an internal pressure of one atmosphere. Although atmospheric suits were developed during the Victorian era, none of these suits were able to overcome the basic design problem of constructing a joint which would remain flexible and watertight at depth without seizing up under pressure.|$|E
25|$|The first <b>diving</b> <b>suit</b> designs {{appeared}} in the early 18th century. Two English inventors developed the first pressure-proof diving suits in the 1710s. John Lethbridge built a completely enclosed suit to aid in salvage work. It consisted of a pressure-proof air-filled barrel with a glass viewing hole and two watertight enclosed sleeves. This suit gave the diver more maneouverability to accomplish useful underwater salvage work.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, Andrew Becker created a leather-covered <b>diving</b> <b>suit</b> with a windowed helmet. The suit used {{a system of}} tubes for inhaling and exhaling, and Becker {{demonstrated}} his suit in the River Thames, London, during which he remained submerged for an hour. These suits were of limited use as {{there was still no}} practical system for replenishing the air supply during the dive.|$|E
