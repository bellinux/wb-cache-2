The two companies had spent about US$1.5 million (about $ today) <b>in</b> <b>legal</b> <b>fees</b> fighting each other in various contractual, trademark and patent infringement lawsuits since 1905, but, {{on the advice of}} investors, the two companies merged in 1925 to form the Caterpillar Tractor Co. , Caterpillar Inc. was the 229th largest company in the world.|$|E

5|$|Still, Finley & Figg {{remains in}} bad shape. The Krayoxx affair has left them deep in debt {{instead of the}} {{expected}} big profit, their office building – the firm's sole asset – heavily mortgaged and the two partners ailing, in bad shape physically and mentally. Meanwhile, David manages to complete his lead poisoning product liability case, finding that the destructive toys were imported from China by a subsidiary of Sonesta Games, the third-largest toy producer in the U.S. Unlike the Krayoxx case, this provides David with an air-tight case. A jury seeing the poor child, completely disabled as a direct provable result of using the toy, would be certain to grant a high sum in compensations. Knowing this, the Sonesta CEO and his senior executives hasten to meet with David, seeming to show genuine remorse, aside from being aware of the grave damage which the publicity around such a case could cause their corporation. They readily agree to give David's clients, the child's Burmese immigrant parents $5 million in out-of-court compensation, provided that the case remain secret. David insists, however, that $1.5 million <b>in</b> <b>legal</b> <b>fees</b> would not {{come out of his}} clients' compensation but be paid separately by Sonesta; knowing himself to have the upper hand, Zinc is a tough negotiator and the Sonesta directors {{have no choice but to}} agree to pay a total of $6.5 million. In parting, a Sonesta executive discreetly slips Zinc an unmarked envelope with information on lead poisoning caused by the products of Sonesta's competitors.|$|E

25|$|Second, such {{critics argue}} that {{comprehensive}} campaigns waste valuable union resources by engaging in costly litigation.

In an era in which the employer's primary advantage over the union is financial, critics say, shifting the focus of the organizing drive to the courts exposes the union to high legal costs. In the Food Lion comprehensive campaign, for example, the UFCW paid over $1 million <b>in</b> <b>legal</b> <b>fees</b> litigating its two class-action suits.|$|E

50|$|On January 11, 2014, {{following}} a lengthy arbitration process, the suspension was upheld. However, since Rodriguez {{was allowed to}} play during the appeal process, this effectively reduced the suspension to 162 games - {{the entirety of the}} 2014 regular-season schedule. Because Rodriguez was on the restricted list on midnight of August 31, the suspension would have included the postseason if the Yankees qualified. He subsequently issued a statement saying he would be challenging the decision in federal court. On February 7, 2014 Rodriguez announced that he was dropping his lawsuit and accepting his suspension for the 2014 season. In March 2014, multiple sources reported that Rodriguez was refusing to pay the balance of his <b>legal</b> <b>fees</b> for his defense, which amounted to over $3 million.
