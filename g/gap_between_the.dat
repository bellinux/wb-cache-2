5|$|A single {{mandible}} from Porto Spanjo (one of {{the sites}} where fossils of A.donovani have been found), without preserved molars, differs from all Agathaeromys dentaries and is thought to represent an unknown different sigmodontine rodent. This jaw is more slender than A.donovani dentaries, has a shorter diastema (<b>gap)</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> incisors and molars, has the incisor less shifted lingually relative to the molars, and has more roots under the molars, {{as shown by the}} preserved alveoli.|$|E
5|$|As is {{characteristic}} of apeomyines, Apeomyoides was a large eomyid with high-crowned cheekteeth and a large <b>gap</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> incisors and cheekteeth. Furthermore, the cheekteeth—premolars and molars—approach a bilophodont pattern, with two distinct lobes. Other features distinguish Apeomyoides from other apeomyines, including the rectangular shape of the cheekteeth. The fourth lower premolar (p4) {{is larger than the}} molars behind it and has two roots, while the lower molars have three.|$|E

5|$|By 1962, {{both the}} United States and the Soviet Union had flown two solo spaceflights in the Space Race. There was a {{widespread}} perception, however, that the United States was falling behind; its two missions had been suborbital and had {{lasted only a}} few minutes. The Soviet missions had both orbited the Earth, and the second, Vostok 2, had remained in orbit for a full day.

The <b>gap</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two sections of SH-74 was widened on March 3, 1975, when the route was eliminated through Cleveland County and much of Oklahoma City, bringing SH-74 to its present-day termini.|$|E

The upper and lower masseteric ridges, which are located on the outer side of the jaw and anchor some of the chewing muscles, meet at the m1.

5|$|Microgale macpheei is an extinct shrew tenrec from southeastern Madagascar.

M.macpheei has a broad rostrum (front part of the skull) and, like M.brevicaudata, lacks a diastema (<b>gap)</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> premolars.
