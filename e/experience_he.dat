5|$|Dioscorides then {{describes}} {{how to tell}} a good from a counterfeit preparation. He mentions the recommendations of other physicians, Diagoras (according to Eristratus), Andreas, and Mnesidemus, only to dismiss them as false and not borne out by <b>experience.</b> <b>He</b> ends {{with a description of}} how the liquid is gathered from poppy plants, and lists names used for it: chamaesyce, mecon rhoeas, oxytonon; papaver to the Romans, and wanti to the Egyptians.|$|E

5|$|Discovered by Alex Gordon as an unproduced {{screenplay}} by Hollywood writer Frank Quattrocchi, The Projected Man {{was directed by}} Ian Curteis; {{it would be the}} first theatrical film that he would direct. However, due to his lack of <b>experience,</b> <b>he</b> ran into several problems during filming.

Producer John Croydon replaced him; however, Croydon remained uncredited as the producers did not wish to publicise the problems which had occurred on set.|$|E
5|$|From 1924 to 1928 he {{attempted}} without success to find employment {{as a civil}} engineer in California, where his father was now stationed.

5|$|George Meyer {{obtained}} {{inspiration for}} the scene toward {{the beginning of the}} episode where Rainier Wolfcastle is taunting the children from an <b>experience</b> <b>he</b> had with Arnold Schwarzenegger.

5|$|In 1880, Selfe became vice {{president}} of the School of Arts. He supported the school's Working Men's College, but felt a more thorough focus on practical skills was needed. He rejected the non-technical, non-practical approach of the school's model and campaigned instead {{for the establishment of a}} proper institute of technical education, where instructors would be skilled tradesmen with practical industrial <b>experience.</b> <b>He</b> also pushed for the expansion of technical education facilities into the suburban and regional districts.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1871, U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant had named Hall as overall {{commander}} of the expedition, and he was being referred to as Captain. Though Hall had abundant Arctic <b>experience,</b> <b>he</b> had no sailing experience, and so the title was purely honorary. In selecting the officers and seamen, Hall relied heavily on whalers with experience in the Arctic. This was markedly different from the polar expeditions of the British Admiralty, which tended to use naval officers and highly disciplined crews.|$|E
5|$|Many readers {{praised the}} series for its {{attention}} to detail and realism {{in the area of}} military tactics and procedures. Much of this was due to Hama's military <b>experience</b> (<b>he</b> was drafted into the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers during the Vietnam war), but he also did a large amount of research in order to be as up-to-date as possible. He frequented Sky Books, a military-oriented bookstore in New York, and read many U.S. Army field manuals and technical manuals, and also credits his friend Lee Russel, a military historian, for helping him with research.|$|E

5|$|Morton asked Harrison if {{he could}} help recruit a regiment, {{although}} he would not ask him to serve. Harrison recruited throughout northern Indiana to raise a regiment.

Governor Morton commissioned Harrison as a colonel on August 7, 1862, and the newly formed 70th Indiana was mustered into Federal service on August 12, 1862. Once mustered, the regiment left Indiana to join the Union Army at Louisville, Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the things}} that Spector wanted to achieve in Deus Ex was to make JC Denton a cipher for the player, {{in order to create a}} better {{immersion}} and gameplay <b>experience.</b> <b>He</b> did not want the character to force any emotion so that whatever feelings the player may be experiencing comes from themselves rather than from JC Denton. To do this, Spector instructed voice actor Jay Anthony Franke to record his dialogue without any emotion but in a monotone voice, which is unusual for a voice acting role.|$|E
5|$|Opinion of the Rivadavia {{government}} was {{divided between the}} two ideologies. For Unitarians like Sarmiento, Rivadavia's presidency was a positive <b>experience.</b> <b>He</b> set up a European-staffed university and supported a public education program for rural male children. He also supported theater and opera groups, publishing houses and a museum. These contributions were considered as civilizing influences by the Unitarians, but they upset the Federalist constituency. Common laborers had their salaries subjected to a government cap, and the gauchos were arrested by Rivadavia for vagrancy and forced to work on public projects, usually without pay.|$|E
50|$|Narendra felt amazed as {{this was}} the first time he was meeting someone who could say that he had met or <b>experienced</b> God. <b>He</b> also {{understood}} those were not mere words, but words uttered from deep inner <b>experiences.</b> <b>He</b> left Dakshineswar and came back to Calcutta in a highly puzzled and bewildered state of mind.|$|R
