40|$|A common {{list of the}} paradoxes of {{material}} implication include the following argument forms: 1 1) p ⊃ (q ⊃ p) 2) p ⊃ (q ⊃ q) 3) (p & ~p) ⊃ q 4) p ⊃ (q v ~q) 5) p ⊃ (~p ⊃ q) I will first argue that truth table analysis shows that forms three and four are impossible logical sentences. Indeed, I will maintain that truth table analysis clearly shows that no single logical operator may join a variable and it's negation, such as (p&~p), (~p ⊃ p) and even (p v ~p). I will contend that the remaining argument forms can not properly be understood as forms {{that are capable of}} expressing full entailment where the truth or falsity of the consequent is determined by logical rules alone. The error which gives rise to the paradoxes lies not in logic but with the logician for trying to insist they must somehow express entailment. To see why this is so, a detailed analysis of the truth table is required. 2. The truth table The foundation of a truth table rests on two important assumptions. The first is the bivalence of the variables, and the second is the independence of the variables. From this, the truth table is grounded in the listing of all possible combinations of truth values for the variables in the given argument. I will call this exhaustive combination the foundation of the truth table. Let us examine the foundation of a common truth table, expressed in the familiar way, except where the customary t's and f's are replaced by p, ~p, q, ~q. The reason for this will become apparent <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> A truth table with two variables would look like this...|$|E

Sixteen healthy female cats undergoing elective ovariohysterectomy and received as premedication dexmedetomidine (2. 5 ?g/kg), methadone (0. 5 mg/kg) and ketamine (0. 5 mg/kg) administrated at intramuscular rote. After 15 minutes, the animals were allocated into two groups : Fixed Rate (GFR), which received propofol 4 mg/kg, followed by continuous infusion (CI) at the rate of 0. 3 mg/kg/min for 60 minutes; and Variable Rate (GVR) receiving the same induction protocol exchange with the IC starting at 0. 3 mg/ kg/min for 10 minutes, 0. 25 mg/kg/min up to 25 minutes, 0. 2 mg/ kg/min up to 45 minutes and 0. 15 mg/kg /min to 60 min of infusion based on simulation STAMPUMP®. We evaluated the cardiac frequency (HR), respiratory rate (RR), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and maintenance of anesthesia during 60 minutes of infusion, as well as time to extubation, sternal recumbency and to full recovery. We observed similar anesthesia in both groups, but the GVR was used propofol least 30 % for maintenance anesthesia. There was a reduction of HR and f in both groups after induction, with one animal the GFR developed apnea during all periods evaluated. Decreased SBP in GFR at all times in relation to the baseline, as the GVR, SBP decreased <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> There {{was no significant difference between}} groups with respect to time to extubation (GFR 43. 2 ± 19. 5 min and 30. 7 ± 13. 2 min GVR), deambulation (GFR 60. 7 ± 29. 6 min and 41. 6 ± GVR 17. 2 min) and total recovery (GFR 136 ± 34. 3 min and 101. 5 ± 29. 6 min GVR).

The Quetta earthquake, as it was named, completely devastated the city of Quetta, more than 35, 000 – 60, 000 people were buried under the debris {{of the city and}} beside the high death toll thousands were injured and a similar number rendered homeless and destitute. This loss can never be forgotten, as 11 people were killed in the brutal natural hazard, their names are still written in the memorial at Jinnah Road Quetta, in 18 th Jan 2011 an earthquake generated from Dalbandin attenuated to Quetta city in late hours at night and people of the area were horrified and were forced to vacate their homes in cold weather, about 200 homes were recorded destroyed and wide cracks appeared on buildings, adding up to the high damage potential caused by earthquakes 29 th Oct, 2008 Ziarat Earthquake cannot be forgotten, registering 6.4 magnitude on the Richter scale, <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> 166 people were killed, 322 people injured, 7612 houses destroyed, and over 68, 000 people were rendered homeless (Bhatti 2016). Loss of such amplitude can also be seen in different areas of Pakistan, the Makran coast earthquake of magnitude 8.0 in 1945, Pattan earthquake of magnitude 6.0 in 1974 and Muzaffarabad earthquake of magnitude 7.5 in 2005 bears testimony to the active seismicity of the area (Bhatti 2013 a). The 1925 Santa Barbra earthquake (M 6.2) which caused 13 deaths raised the need for earthquake engineering and strong motion observation. In 1931, on the other hand earthquakes of large magnitudes more commonly occurred in countries like Japan, Taiwan, and USA, etc., where the death toll seldom crosses double figures. The obvious difference lies in preparedness to face earthquakes. Preparedness can be improved by constantly updating building codes, design standards, construction practices and of course by social awareness. Rehabilitation of the affected areas is still in progress by local and foreign agencies, cautious and detailed work is required to resist the damage potential of the area.|$|E
40|$|Handbook of Formulas in Chinese Medicine is a concise, visual {{reference}} to over 180 {{of the most}} important herbal formulas in Chinese medicine.

On the left is a drawing of a person showing an aspect that is typical of the type of patient for whom the formula might be prescribed. The drawing is labelled with key symptoms. Under the drawing is a list of ingredients followed by basic information: actions, main pattern, key and secondary symptoms, tongue, pulse and abdomen. This can be absorbed <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments.</b> Additional detail is set forth in clinical notes, and other formulas with similar indications are discussed for purposes of comparison.

40|$|Prior {{to the war}} in Georgia in August 2008, Russia’s {{efforts to}} {{maintain}} and strengthen its influence in the ‘near abroad’ had been challenged by its competitors. Hence, the war in Georgia over South Ossetia came <b>just</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> right <b>moment</b> for Russian leadership to strongly reassert the presence of Russia’s exclusive interests in the ‘near abroad’. In this study, the war in Georgia is treated as an event not being a total game-changer but an event capable of having important geopolitical implications in the ‘near abroad’. Thus, the article argues that Russia’s reaction to Georgia aimed to carry out what it had already been doing politically and economically, now in a heightened alert with multifarious tools to enhance Russian national interests in the ‘near abroad’. Despite harsh criticism and some measures taken particularly by the US and the EU, Russia has largely succeeded in taking the ‘near abroad’ back into its influence. Russia has been doing this through a number of methods showing the very bases of Russia’s pre-Georgian war realism. After identifying Russian conception of ‘near abroad’ before the War, the study will delve into four policy areas through which Russia’s geopolitical re-claim in the same region is thought to be best identified: Russia curbing the US and the EU, Collective Security Treaty Organization for deepening security space, Shanghai Cooperation Organization for widening security space and energy pipelines for making Russia ‘great’ again...|$|R
