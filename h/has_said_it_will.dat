25|$|On 31 March 2014, {{a lesbian}} couple {{applied for a}} {{marriage}} license in San Francisco de Campeche but were denied in April 2014 based on a decision that same-sex couples must join via the state's civil union provisions. In July 2014, Mexico's Supreme Court declared that the current marriage laws were unconstitutional and told the local government that they must modify their Civil Code to allow same-sex marriages. It was later announced that the couple could marry after a district judge granted them an injunction, but the law must still be revised. PAN <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> abide by the ruling. The couple married on 30 August 2014. In September 2014, the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) announced that 16 persons, 10 from San Francisco de Campeche and 6 from Ciudad del Carmen have filed for injunctions and that analysis of changing the marriage statues is in progress.|$|E

25|$|On 10 July, Egypt's {{parliament}} convened despite dissolution, but {{the session}} was adjourned by Speaker Saad al-Katatni after {{the members of}} parliament approved Katatni's proposal that the parliament seek legal advice from the Court of Cassation on how to implement the supreme court's ruling. Thousands gathered in Cairo in protest of a ruling by Egypt's Supreme Constitutional Court to freeze the decree issued by President Mohamed Morsi to reinstate the Islamist-led parliament. While the Supreme Constitutional Court ruled that Morsi {{did not have the}} right to reconstitute the body, it also threatened the new president with the equivalent of contempt of court if he continued to reject its decisions. Parliament asked Egypt's Court of Cassation to essentially overrule the aspect of the Supreme Constitutional Court's decision holding that the whole Parliament must be immediately dissolved because of flaws in the electoral system used to fill a third of the seats. The Administrative Court (whose function is the review of executive actions), besides the Supreme Constitutional Court (whose function is the review of statutes) and Court of Cassation (whose function is the handling of appeals of lower court rulings) one of the three highest Courts in Egypt, is also weighing that question and <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> issue its own ruling on 17 July.|$|E

2500|$|Following {{the result}} in the Senate, the Government {{initially}} said it had [...] "no plans to take any other measures on this issue", however pressure to change policy and allow a free vote in the parliament grew over several months. By August 2017, several Liberal Party MPs were attempting to change party policy in favour of a free vote and revealed they would consider crossing the floor to suspend standing orders and bring on debate on a bill against the government's wishes. Consequently, at a Liberal party room meeting on 7 August 2017, the government resolved to re-submit the plebiscite legislation to the Senate once more and, if that failed (which occurred on 9 August 2017), seek to hold a voluntary postal survey on the matter later in the year. The survey did not require legislative approval by the Parliament and despite being legally challenged, was upheld by the High Court. The survey was held between 12 September and 7 November 2017 and if it returns a majority [...] "Yes" [...] response, the government <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> facilitate {{the passage of a}} private member's bill legalising same-sex marriage in the Parliament. The results of the survey will be released on 15 November 2017.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2010, the vetting process used {{to approve}} history text books came into {{question}} over a fourth grade book entitled Our Virginia: Our Past and Present by Joy Masoff. Masoff {{is not a}} trained historian, but had previously published Oh Yikes! History's Grossest Moments. [...] Her text, which had {{been approved by the}} State Department of Education, claims that thousands of slaves fought for the South during the Civil War. [...] Most historians disagree with that view. [...] Although Virginia is one of 20 states that have a state-level process for approving text books, the book had been reviewed by a committee that did not include any trained historians. [...] Virginia's curriculum requires that the African-Americans' role in the Civil War be covered, including their work on plantations and on the sidelines of battles. So Masoff conducted internet research on the topic and found three references derived from the Sons of Confederate Veterans, who believe that slavery was not the main cause of the American Civil War. [...] The Department of Education <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> contact school divisions and advise against teaching the passage. On October 21, the publisher of Our Virginia: Our Past and Present, which Masoff owns, announced that it will distribute sticker labels {{that can be used to}} cover the disputed paragraph.|$|E
