50|$|Around 1374 Ipstones married Elizabeth Corbet, who was {{probably}} 16 or 17 {{years of age}} at the time. She {{was the daughter of}} Thomas Corbet, who was heir to the very large estates of Sir Robert Corbet of Moreton Corbet and Wattlesborough. However, Thomas had died long before his parents. Around 1363 they had initiated a series of property transactions, using the device of fine of lands, with the aim of keeping most of the <b>estates</b> <b>in</b> <b>tail,</b> to exclude Elizabeth and other female heirs, to the advantage principally of their surviving sons, Sir Fulk and Sir Roger. The devices they used were poorly drafted and self-contradictory, and were to lead to years of litigation and decades of bitterness among the Corbet family.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the passing}} of the statute, an estate given to a man and the heirs of his body has been known as an estate <b>tail,</b> or an <b>estate</b> <b>in</b> fee <b>tail</b> (feudum talliatum). The word tail is derived from the French tailler, to cut, the {{inheritance}} being by the statute cut down and confined to the heirs of the body.|$|R
50|$|Roger Corbet had {{two older}} brothers, Thomas and Fulk, {{as well as}} a younger brother, John, and a sister, Joan. He {{inherited}} most of the family estates only because of a complex series of arrangements made by his parents. As the eldest son, Thomas, predeceased his parents, they were concerned to keep the <b>estates</b> <b>in</b> the Corbet family by preventing their going to Elizabeth, Thomas's daughter, who had married Sir John Ipstones, later twice MP for Staffordshire. Hence they initiated a series of transactions, some involving their daughters, intended to put most of the <b>estates</b> <b>in</b> <b>tail,</b> and favouring <b>in</b> particular Fulk and Roger. However, some of the provisions were mutually-contradictory, generating the disputes Roger pursued in the 1380s and 1390s. In fact, litigation began even before the death of Sir Robert. In 1374 Elizabeth and Ipstones went to the Court of Common Pleas to try to get possession of the manor of Braunstone in Leicetershire, which had been given to Thomas Erdington, the son of Roger's sister, Margaret.|$|R

The other two thirds were held, in 1784, by William Richard Wilson and Jane Anne Eleanor, his wife, who appear to have given up their share to Henry Greswolde Lewis. He was succeeded in 1829 by his , Edmund Meysey Wigley, who assumed the name Greswolde and died unmarried in 1833. On his death, Henry Wigley, who also assumed the name Greswolde, became tenant for life under the will of Henry Greswolde Lewis, {{and he and his}} son, Edmund Greswolde, who was tenant in line, barred the <b>estate</b> <b>in</b> <b>tail</b> and conveyed the estates to the use of Henry Greswolde for life, with remainder to Edmund Greswolde in fee simple.

25|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{his life}} Cokayne was preoccupied by {{questions}} of inheritance and the consequent family disputes. He was possibly aware of his impending death when in the Spring of 1438 he levied a fine of lands to compel the tenants of his manors of Calton, Staffordshire, and Ballidon, Derbyshire, to recognise the rights of Isabel, his second wife, as joint landholder. He had conditionally leased Ballidon to John and Robert Taylor, two local men, the previous year, probably in preparation for this legal stratagem. Similarly Calton was leased to Richard Bingham and Richard Bromley, who agreed to recognise John and Isabel as joint holders of the estate. Bingham and John Manchester were similarly used as lessees to levy fines on other Derbyshire and Warwickshire properties. The aim seems to have been to speed Isabel's succession on Cokayne's death but to secure the <b>estates</b> <b>in</b> <b>tail</b> male, thus avoiding losses due to his heir's minority.|$|R

50|$|Andrew's father, Vincent Corbet, had {{inherited}} vast estates when his brother Richard died in 1606: 12,600 acres in Shropshire, concentrated mainly between the county town and Market Drayton, on the north-western edge, {{as well as}} 7,000 acres in Buckinghamshire, Northamptonshire and Oxfordshire. However, there were major problems. Richard's debts were huge, and he left the new Elizabethan building at Moreton Corbet Castle, begun by Robert, still unfinished after a quarter century or more in construction. Although most of the <b>estates</b> were <b>in</b> fee <b>tail</b> male, preventing their dispersal, substantial lands were not. This meant that Robert Corbet's surviving daughter, Elizabeth, and her husband, Sir Henry Wallop could mount claims to them, {{and in some cases}} had already taken possession. Most pressing of all, Richard's widow, Judith Austin, a forceful woman, thrice-married and very wealthy, held large estates as her jointure. Worse still, Judith had potential claims on more, as the improvident Richard had made up her jointure in questionable ways, acknowledging as much in his rambling will.|$|R
50|$|At {{some time}} shortly before 1500 the overlordship had been inherited, with Umberleigh, Heanton Punchardon {{and many other}} estates, by the Basset family of Whitechapel, Devon, and Tehidy, Cornwall, co-heirs of the Beaumonts. The Bassets made great efforts to recover the lease from the Coffin family, which {{struggle}} is mentioned in the Lisle Papers. The legal dispute forms {{the subject of a}} surviving holograph letter dated 28 February 1539 written by the North Devon lawyer George Rolle (died 1552) to Viscountess Lisle (formerly Lady Basset):"Right honourable and my singular good lady, my duty remembered, I have me humbly recommended unto your good ladyship and to my good Lord Lyle advertising your ladyship that I received your ladyship's letter by which ye willed me to speak with my Lady Coffyn for her title in East Haggynton in the county of Devon who had one <b>estate</b> <b>in</b> <b>tail</b> to him (i.e. her husband Sir William Coffyn) and to his heirs of her body begotten; and now he is dead without issue of his body so that the reversion should revert to Mr John Basset and to his heirs so there be no let nor discontinuance of the same made by Sir William Coffyn in his life.

50|$|Lady Corbet (one of the {{recipients}} of the estate after Ann Bold's death) settled her fourth part of Shelvock estate on her grandson Corbet Kynaston and in 1702 her sisters Beatrice Thornes and Francis Ironsides transferred their shares (subject to their life interests) to her. In 1707, the remaining fourth was bought from John Price by Corbet Kynaston's trustees for £400. Another deed of family arrangement was executed on August 7, 1707, conveying the manor and manor house of Shelvock and its demesnes to Corbet Kynaston, and other pieces of land nearby to the Bolds and others in fee. Corbet Kynaston became sole owner of Shelvock {{on the death of}} the Bolds some time between 1707 and 1738, when he executed a deed barring his <b>estate</b> <b>tail</b> <b>in</b> a part of the property. He died unmarried June 17, 1740. He left all his real estates, including Sundorne (inherited from his father) and Shelvock, to Andrew Corbet, whose grandmother was his great-aunt; but Andrew Corbet died April 15, 1741 without issue, and was succeeded by his brother John Corbet.|$|R

His eldest daughter married Sir Duncumbe Colchester of Westbury, Gloucestershire; the second, Edward Nosworthy of Devon; the third, Thomas Legh of Adlington Hall, Cheshire; and the fourth, Sir Edward Gresham, Bt. Maynard survived all his children, except his youngest daughter, and devised his <b>estates</b> <b>in</b> trust for his granddaughters and their issue <b>in</b> <b>tail</b> by a will so obscure that to settle the disputes to which it gave rise a private act of parliament was passed in 1694, notwithstanding which it was made the subject of litigation in 1709.|$|R
5000|$|When James's brother John Harrington fell at Wakefield, he left as his heirs his two daughters, Elizabeth and Anne, {{who were}} {{four and five}} {{years old at the}} time, which meant their {{wardship}} was automatically {{in the hands of the}} Crown to dispense. Edward duly did so, to Thomas, Lord Stanley in November 1461, but James and his brother Robert, in attempt to keep the inheritance for the family, effectively disallowed the King's grant and imprisoned (or, kept in custody) the two girls, as Anthony Goodman noted, [...] "contrary to their will, in divers places." [...] Along with the girls, Sir James also seized Hornby castle, Lonsdale, which was the chief residence contained in the inheritance, but which also included Brierley, and some manors originally granted him by his father's feoffees, including George Neville, in 1463. The dispute was more complicated than merely theft and kidnapping. Harrington claimed that, in law, his father's <b>estates</b> were held <b>in</b> <b>tail</b> male, <b>in</b> which case they could only be passed through the male line and the actions of Sir Thomas's feoffees would be illegal, and the inheritance remain with him; Stanley, however, claimed them to be held in fee simple, viz through the female line as well. In October 1466, Stanley obtained a grant to sue in the King's Court, but the matter was not dealt with until 1468, when a commission found against Harrington and he and his brother were committed- [...] "temporarily", Ross noted- to the Fleet Prison.|$|R
