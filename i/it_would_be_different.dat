500|$|Finally, on May 19, Giuliani held what The New York Times again {{described}} as [...] "an emotional, riveting news conference" [...] that [...] "reached {{a new level}} of introspection" [...] to announce that he was dropping out of the senate race: [...] "This is not the right time for me to run for office. If it were six months ago or it were a year from now or the timing were a little different, maybe <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>different.</b> But it isn't different and that's the way life is." [...] He added that, [...] "I used to think the core of me was in politics, probably. It isn't. When you feel your mortality and your humanity you realize that, that the core of you is first of all being {{able to take care of}} your health." [...] He said that he would instead devote the remainder of his mayoralty trying to overcome the hostile relations he had with many of the city's minority groups.|$|E
500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and appeared later at a press conference. Franchitti was happy with the victory, saying {{that he did not}} think that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>different</b> to win at the track but that it was [...] "very, very special". He said that after his first pit stop he did not think that {{he would be able to}} win the race, and praised his team for their work. Da Matta stated that he was worried about his advantage in the points standings and felt he had the car which could win the event. He added that he could not relax because other drivers still had a mathematical chance of clinching the championship, but he was pleased with the result. Third-place finisher Carpentier said he was happy with his position and that it was a good day for his team. He revealed that changes made to his aerodynamic setup worked on the rolling restarts although it slowed him on the backstraight. Franchitti's race engineer Allen McDonald praised his driver, saying his first victory on an oval track was one that he would remember and that it was an [...] "unbelievable day".|$|E
500|$|When Swift {{was first}} signed to Big Machine Records, {{it was a}} new and {{extremely}} small record label, the smallest in Nashville, Tennessee, that consisted of approximately twelve employees and her as the only signed artist. At some point, Swift realized that it would be more difficult for her to achieve success through a small label, than in a larger label, constricting their contacts and making it nearly impossible to embark on concert tours and have presenter or performer slots on award shows. In addition, as the only signed artist, she could not ask for favors and only had herself to encourage the hope that scenarios would eventually change. Swift described the scenario as an [...] "uphill climb" [...] and said, [...] "There was this moment where I sat there and was like, ‘When {{are we going to get}} a fighting chance? We’re the smallest record label in Nashville, but we want this really bad.’" [...] After reassuring to herself that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>different</b> in the future, she wrote the beginning of [...] "Change". She let the track sit for a while, waiting for a remarkable event to trigger its completion. She then completed the track the day after she won the Horizon Award at the 2007 Country Music Association Awards and saw Scott Borchetta, the president of Big Machine Records, crying. [...] "That’s when I finished , because I knew I couldn’t finish it until something like that happened. It was absolutely the most amazing night of my life, getting to see the emotion of all the people who worked so hard for me." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{losing to}} Manchester United in the semi-final of the 2007–08 Champions League, Rijkaard {{was asked whether}} he would quit {{at the end of}} the season, since he had not won {{anything}} for two successive seasons. He replied, [...] "I have no intention of leaving. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>different</b> if the players were saying it is time for me to go but that is not the case." [...] On 1 May 2008, it was reported that Rijkaard allegedly confided to a colleague that he would be stepping down as Barcelona manager {{at the end of the}} season, but 24 hours later, he stated in a press conference that he had no intention of leaving the club.|$|E

6000|$|Appleby smiled curiously. “I {{had decided}} to go, anyway, and I haven’t a friend who would worry about me except yourself, and perhaps Miss Wayne. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> very <b>different</b> with you. Now, don’t waste a minute, Tony. I have made my mind up.” ...|$|R

[...] "All that I know <b>is</b> that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a <b>different</b> world, one shaped upon a new plan, {{governed by}} untried laws and seeking other ends.

6000|$|... "I don't {{think it}} so strange, after all, on that account," [...] said Flask. [...] "If his leg were {{off at the}} hip, now, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a <b>different</b> thing. That would disable him; but he has one knee, and {{good part of the}} other left, you know." ...|$|R
60|$|Ida {{at first}} {{could hardly believe}} it.

6000|$|... "If I knew I'd been robbed, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>different,</b> but I don't, and if I blamed {{people who}} {{were found to be}} innocent, I'd only make matters worse for myself." ...|$|E
