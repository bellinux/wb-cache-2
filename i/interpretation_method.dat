5000|$|Optimal and {{reliable}} results require controlling several variables, such as incubation times, {{red blood cell}} concentration, and type of red blood cell. [...] Non-specific factors in the sample can lead to interference and incorrect titer values. For example, molecules in the sample other than virus-specific antibodies can inhibit agglutination between virus and RBC’s, as well as potentially blocking antibody from binding to virus. Receptor-destroying enzymes (RDE) are commonly used to treat samples prior to analysis to prevent non-specific inhibition. [...] Analysis of the HA or HI results relies on a qualified individual to read the plate and determine the titer values. The manual <b>interpretation</b> <b>method</b> introduces more opportunities for discrepancies in the assay because results can be subjective and the agreement between human readers is inconsistent. Also, there is no digital record of the plate or titer determinations so the initial interpretation is tedious and commonly done in replicates. The range of potential variables and differences between expert readers can make comparing inter-laboratory results difficult.|$|E

Interpretation of these dissipation tests is however often based on various simplifYing assumptions and has not been extensively calibrated against experimental or numerical results.

The effectiveness of the two widely used <b>interpretation</b> <b>methods</b> of Teh & Houlsby (1991) and Sully & Campanella (1994) is studied.

40|$|The main {{stages of}} the {{developed}} technology of forest inventory by <b>interpretation</b> <b>method,</b> named «From survey – to project», {{with the use of}} modern aerial survey data, special software and hardware are discussed in the paper. A need for development of high-end technology of forest inventory is due to increasing demands of state, business, and civil community for actual and correct information about forests. The tasks of research were: integration software and hardware into single technology, testing on the real object, and development of recommendations for introduction into production and forming of system of preparing specialists for forest interpretation. Positive results of experimental works by measurement and analytical forest interpretation in stereo regime on base of photogrammetric software were obtained by specialists from Russia, Croatia, Belarus, and Sweden. In the technology «From survey – to project», the following instruments are used: photogrammetric complex Vision Map A 3, digital photogrammetric system Photomod, program «ESAUL», GIS ArcGIS, special hardware for stereo visualization. Results of testing this technology are shown on example of model territory. Comparison of results of forest inventory obtained by <b>interpretation</b> <b>method</b> and results of control inventory obtained by enumeration method demonstrated that errors of determination of main forest inventory characteristics do not exceed the norms. The advantages of practical use of the technology are shown. It has been noted that forest inventory by <b>interpretation</b> <b>method</b> is a complex psychophysiological process and it requires an attraction of specialists with high qualification on base of special training.

The interpretation methods for interwell tracer test considering the geologic model have three kinds: analytic method, numerical simulation method, semi-analytic method.

The migration mechanism of numerical simulation <b>interpretation</b> <b>method</b> to interwell tracer test can’t be described accurately, the workload is big, and the solution stability is bad. From the angle of the reservoir engineering, based on the flow line method and not stable filtrate field, a more perfect semi-analytic method system for output concentration calculation of interwell tracer was build in this paper. It included pressure field resolution, particle tracing method, and the flow field decomposition method, which made a three-dimensional problem solving process become a combined form of solutions for linear dimension. The interpretation software for interwell tracer test was developed, based on the system of streamline solving method, and a practical and reliable <b>interpretation</b> <b>method</b> for interwell tracer test was formed.

40|$|Fundamental rights {{provisions}} {{are known for}} their relatively vague and general formulation. As a result, judges dealing with these {{provisions are}} confronted with many and often controversial interpretative choices. These interpretative choices already present judges operating in a national context with difficulties, but that is even more so for European judges operating in a multilevel context. The European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) and the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) are often criticized for delivering judgments that contain debatable choices and do not offer sufficient insight into the reasons which have led the courts to make these choices. Especially in a multilevel context where the cooperation of national authorities plays an important role as regards the effectiveness of the European courts, it is important that <b>interpretation</b> <b>methods</b> and principles are used in a transparent manner so that the reasons that justify a specific interpretative choice are clear. This book analyses the use of a selected number of <b>interpretation</b> <b>methods</b> and principles in the fundamental rights case law of the ECtHR and the CJEU. The use of teleological, comparative, evolutive and autonomous interpretation by the ECtHR and the CJEU are elaborately discussed on the basis of both legal theoretical literature and case law. The legal theoretical analysis provides the basis for various relevant questions, hypotheses and (analytical) suggestions, that are further studied in the subsequent case law analysis. This leads to a thorough overview of the role of these <b>interpretation</b> <b>methods</b> and principles and the possibilities for improvement. Promotor: J. H. GerardsWith Summary in DutchNW...|$|R
