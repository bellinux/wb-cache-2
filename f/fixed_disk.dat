25|$|A {{hard disk}} drive, or hard drive, hard disk, or <b>fixed</b> <b>disk</b> drive, is a {{non-volatile}} storage device which stores digitally encoded data on rapidly rotating platters with magnetic surfaces. The {{hard disk drive}} was invented by Reynold Johnson and commercially introduced in 1956 with the IBM 305 RAMAC computer.|$|E
25|$|In 1819 an {{improved}} siren {{was developed and}} named by Baron Charles Cagniard de la Tour. De la Tour's siren consisted of two perforated disks that were mounted coaxially at the outlet of a pneumatic tube. One disk was stationary, while the other disk rotated. The rotating disk periodically interrupted the flow of air through the <b>fixed</b> <b>disk,</b> producing a tone. De la Tour's siren could produce sound under water, suggesting a link with the sirens of Greek mythology; hence {{the name of the}} instrument.|$|E
25|$|With {{the advent}} of larger {{removable}} and <b>fixed</b> <b>disk</b> drives, disk de-blocking formulas were employed which resulted in more disk blocks per logical file allocation block. While this allowed for larger file sizes, it also meant that the smallest file which could be allocated increased in size from 1KB (on single-density drives) to 2KB (on double-density drives) and so on, up to 32KB for a file containing only a single byte. This made for inefficient use of disk space if the disk contained {{a large number of}} small files.|$|E

50|$|A {{number of}} {{manufacturers}} have combined DVD recorders with mechanical hard disk drive-based digital video recorders, allowing for recording to large <b>fixed</b> <b>disks,</b> {{and the ability}} to view these recordings off the hard disk at a later date.|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} configuration included 128 or 256 KB core memory, tape puncher, two RK-05 removable 2.5 MB disks and two RK-05F <b>fixed</b> <b>disks,</b> two TU-10 drives and Videoton VDT-340 terminals (VT52 non-compatible). The SM-4P processor operated at 800,000 operations per second.|$|R
25|$|A {{hard disk}} drive (HDD), hard disk, hard drive or <b>fixed</b> <b>disk</b> is a data storage device that uses {{magnetic}} storage to store and retrieve digital information using one or more rigid rapidly rotating disks (platters) coated with magnetic material. The platters are paired with magnetic heads, usually arranged on a moving actuator arm, which read and write data to the platter surfaces. Data is accessed in a random-access manner, meaning that individual blocks of data can be stored or retrieved in any order and not only sequentially. HDDs are a type of non-volatile storage, retaining stored data even when powered off.|$|E
500|$|The {{need for}} such {{software}} was first recognized in 1989 at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, resulting {{in the creation of}} IMDUMP (by Michael White) and in 1990, SafeBack (developed by Sydex). Similar software was developed in other countries; DIBS (a hardware and software solution) was released commercially in the UK in 1991, and Rob McKemmish released <b>Fixed</b> <b>Disk</b> Image free to Australian law enforcement. [...] These tools allowed examiners to create an exact copy of a piece of digital media to work on, leaving the original disk intact for verification. By the end of the 1990s, as demand for digital evidence grew more advanced commercial tools such as EnCase and FTK were developed, allowing analysts to examine copies of media without using any live forensics. [...] More recently, a trend towards [...] "live memory forensics" [...] has grown resulting in the availability of tools such as WindowsSCOPE.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the design}} of the PC, the memory below 640 KB was for random-access memory on the {{motherboard}} or on expansion boards. The 384 KB above was reserved for system use and optional devices. [...] This upper portion of the 8088 address space was used for the ROM BIOS, additional read-only memory, BIOS extensions for <b>fixed</b> <b>disk</b> drives and video adapters, video adapter memory, and other memory-mapped input and output devices.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Fixed</b> hard <b>disk</b> image: a {{file that}} is {{allocated}} {{to the size of}} the virtual <b>disk.</b> <b>Fixed</b> VHDs consist of a raw disk image followed by a VHD footer (512 or formerly 511 bytes).|$|R
5000|$|... 86-DOS did {{not offer}} any {{specific}} support for <b>fixed</b> <b>disks</b> by itself, but third-party solutions in form of hard disk controllers and corresponding I/O system extensions for 86-DOS were available from companies like Tallgrass, making hard disks accessible similar to superfloppies within the size limits of the FAT12 file system.|$|R
2500|$|Transistorized {{electronics}} improved {{not only}} the CPU (Central Processing Unit), but also the peripheral devices. The second generation disk data storage units were able to store {{tens of millions of}} letters and digits. [...] Next to the <b>fixed</b> <b>disk</b> storage units, connected to the CPU via high-speed data transmission, were removable disk data storage units. A removable disk pack can be easily exchanged with another pack in a few seconds. Even if the removable disks' capacity is smaller than fixed disks, their interchangeability guarantees a nearly unlimited quantity of data close at hand. Magnetic tape provided archival capability for this data, at a lower cost than disk.|$|E
2500|$|Between 1864 and 1880, W. T. B. Holtz {{constructed}} and described {{a large number}} of influence machines which were considered the most advanced developments of the time. In one form, the Holtz machine consisted of a glass disk mounted on a horizontal axis which could be made to rotate at a considerable speed by a multiplying gear, interacting with induction plates mounted in a <b>fixed</b> <b>disk</b> close to it. In 1865, August J. I. Toepler developed an influence machine that consisted of two disks fixed on the same shaft and rotating in the same direction. In 1868, the Schwedoff machine had a curious structure to increase the output current. Also in 1868, several mixed friction-influence machine were developed, including the Kundt machine and the Carré machine. [...] In 1866, the Piche machine (or Bertsch machine) was developed. In 1869, H. Julius Smith received the American patent for a portable and airtight device that was designed to ignite powder. Also in 1869, sectorless machines in Germany were investigated by Poggendorff.|$|E

5000|$|The buyer had {{the choice}} between a floppy disk model and a <b>fixed</b> <b>disk</b> (hard disk) model. The floppy disk model had one or two 360 KB drives, so that the user could run MS-DOS {{programs}} on the primary drive and work with files on the secondary drive, if equipped. [...] The <b>fixed</b> <b>disk</b> model had one 360 KiB floppy drive and either a 10 MB, 20 MB, or 30 MB hard disk. The model with the 20 MB <b>fixed</b> <b>disk</b> was initially released in February 1986 {{at a cost of}} $1,895. Leading Edge dealers had difficulty keeping the 20MB model in stock. At the time, a Tandy 1200 equipped with a 10MB drive sold for $1999.|$|E

5000|$|DL is {{supported}} by IBM BIOSes {{as well as most}} other BIOSes. The Toshiba T1000 BIOS is known to not support this properly, and some old Wyse 286 BIOSes use DL values greater or equal to 2 for <b>fixed</b> <b>disks</b> (thereby reflecting the logical drive numbers under DOS rather than the physical drive numbers of the BIOS). USB sticks configured as removable drives typically get an assignment of DL = 80hex, 81hex, etc. However, some rare BIOSes erroneously presented them under DL = 01hex, just as if they were configured as superfloppies.|$|R
50|$|Although M-JPEG {{became the}} {{standard}} codec for NLE {{during the early}} 1990s, it had drawbacks. Its high computational requirements ruled out software implementations, leading to the extra cost and complexity of hardware compression/playback cards. More importantly, the traditional tape workflow had involved editing from tape, often in a rented facility. When the editor left the edit suite, they could take their confidential video tapes with them. But the M-JPEG data rate was too high for systems like Avid on the Mac and Lightworks on PC to store the video on removable storage, so these used <b>fixed</b> hard <b>disks</b> instead. The tape paradigm of keeping your (confidential) content with you was not possible with these <b>fixed</b> <b>disks.</b> Editing machines were often rented from facilities houses on a per-hour basis, and some productions chose to delete their material after each edit session, and then recapture {{it the next day}} to guarantee security of their content. In addition, each NLE system had storage limited by its hard disk capacity.|$|R
5000|$|IBM {{introduced}} the 5362 or [...] "Compact 36" [...] in 1984 {{as a system}} targeted {{at the lower end}} of their market. It had a deskside tower form factor (albeit a bulky one). It was designed to operate in a normal office environment, requiring little special consideration. It differed from the 5360 in by having a more limited card cage, capable of fewer peripherals. It used 14" [...] <b>fixed</b> <b>disks</b> (30 or 60MB) and could support up to two; RAM (main storage) ranged from 128KB to 512 KB. [...] One 8" [...] floppy diskette drive was built in.|$|R

50|$|The machine rests upon a footed walnut base. A column {{horizontally}} {{supports the}} axis of rotation. Two thin, shellacked, parallel glass disks in close proximity {{one to the other}} are vertically hinged to this axis. The larger of the two (the rear one), is a <b>fixed</b> <b>disk</b> and rests on the base along the groove of an ebonite insulation disk; the other (the front one), is a smaller mobile disk and rotates by means of a crank that controls a pair of pulleys connected by a cord. On its outer side, the <b>fixed</b> <b>disk</b> carries the inductors, two strips of tinfoil glued in the middle of two, broad paper shields placed diametrically, one beside the other.|$|E

50|$|For mass storage, the System/3 {{used the}} IBM 5444 single-platter disk, {{roughly the size}} of a large pizza; {{initially}} each platter held 2.5 MB of data. Standard configuration for storage was one or two <b>fixed</b> <b>disks,</b> each in a separate pull-out drawer, which typically held the operating system and user-developed programs. Additionally, each fixed disc could have a removable cartridge disk attached; these typically contained the data-files associated with various applications, for example Payroll, and users frequently had a number of them. Thus the low-end systems could support a maximum of 10 MB of online storage (two fixed, 2 removable), although in practice this was very expensive and not common.|$|R
50|$|In {{most modern}} BIOSes, the boot {{priority}} order of all potentially bootable devices can be freely configured {{by the user}} through the BIOS configuration utility. In older BIOSes, limited boot priority options are selectable; in the earliest BIOSes, a fixed priority scheme was implemented, with floppy <b>disk</b> drives first, <b>fixed</b> <b>disks</b> (i.e. hard disks) second, and typically no other boot devices supported, subject to modification of these rules by installed option ROMs. The BIOS in an early PC also usually would only boot from the first floppy disk drive or the first hard disk drive, {{even if there were}} two drives of either type installed. All more advanced boot priority sequences evolved as incremental improvements on this basic system.|$|R
50|$|The Trofimoff {{piston valve}} {{consisted}} of two fixed discs secured to the valve spindle, and two junk rings, each carrying a bull ring and four valve rings and both free to move longitudinally on the spindle. When the regulator is opened, steam forces the loose valve bodies against their respective fixed discs and they then act as units, similar to ordinary piston valves. When steam is shut off, the loose valve heads become detached from their respective discs and remain in their idle positions near {{the centre of the}} steam chest, while the valve spindle and <b>fixed</b> <b>disks</b> continue their reciprocating motion with the spindle sliding freely through the now stationary loose valve heads, and with the steam and exhaust ports now in communi&shy;ca&shy;tion. With both ends of the cylinders now in communication, the use of ordinary by-bass or snifting valves became unnecessary.|$|R
