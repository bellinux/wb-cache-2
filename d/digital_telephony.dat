25|$|Timestamp: (32 bits) Used {{to enable}} the {{receiver}} to play back the received samples at appropriate intervals. When several media streams are present, the timestamps are independent in each stream, {{and may not be}} relied upon for media synchronization. The granularity of the timing is application specific. For example, an audio application that samples data once every 125µs (8kHz, a common sample rate in <b>digital</b> <b>telephony)</b> would use that value as its clock resolution. The clock granularity is one of the details that is specified in the RTP profile for an application.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the effects of within and between {{standards}} competition and competition between firms on the performance of an emerging new technology, digital mobile telecommunication (2 G). Our empirical exploration provides a more complete picture of the market dynamics of <b>digital</b> mobile <b>telephony</b> than the previous studies that have typically estimated econometric models that ignore the role of endogenous decisions of service providers in the observed market behaviour. The incorporation of endogenous supply side decisions regarding market entry and pricing to the model explaining the diffusion of <b>digital</b> mobile <b>telephony</b> allows us to distinguish the effects of within-standard and within-firm competition on the observed diffusion phenomenon. We use data from 32 industrialized countries over the 1992 1999 time period. It appears that incorporating the timing of market entry to the econometric model explaining 2 G diffusion and service prices is, indeed, critically important. Controlling for entry provides more accurate estimates of the coefficients of the explanatory variables and also affects conclusions to be made concerning the policy variables o...|$|R
