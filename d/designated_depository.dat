As Buckley has had the opportunity of expressing his views on the subject in his paper in this issue of Library Trends, a summary of Brock‘s thinking along these lines will be given here. In his recent article “Implementing the Depository Law,”l Brock discusses certain deficiencies of the Federal Depository Library Act of I 962 (Public Law 87 - 579), and proposes a substitute program which he feels would avoid most of the problems, would cost less, and would achieve the essential objectives of the law. The following requirements, he feels, are unsatisfactory: Sec. 1. Government publications, except those determined by their issuing components to be required for official use only or those required for strictly administrative or operational purposes which have no public interest or educational value and publications classified for reasons of national security, shall be made available to depository libraries through the facilities of the Superintendent of Documents for public information. Sec. 5. Upon request of the Superintendent of Documents, the components of the Government which order the printing of publications shall either increase or decrease the number of copies of publications furnished for distribution to <b>designated</b> <b>depository</b> libraries and State libraries so that the number of copies delivered to the Superintendent of Documents shall be equal to the number of libraries on the list [...] The Superintendent of Documents shall currently inform the components of the Government which order the printing of publication...|$|E
