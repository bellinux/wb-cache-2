Here, we report the concentrations of 24 persistent organic pollutants (POPs), in 10 pools of human milk samples, collected at 2 - 6 weeks postpartum from 238 primiparous women living in Hong Kong and south China, {{who participated in the}} 2002 - 2003 WHO exposure study. Residues were determined by gas chromatography with electron capture detector and confirmed by gas chromatography with mass spectrometry. The mean levels of alpha-HCH (mean 0. 6 ng <b>g</b> - 1 <b>fat),</b> beta-HCH (940 ng <b>g</b> - 1 <b>fat),</b> gamma-HCH (1. 8 ng <b>g</b> - 1 <b>fat),</b> dieldrin (1. 0 ng <b>g</b> - 1 <b>fat)</b> and HCB (21. 8 ng <b>g</b> - 1 <b>fat)</b> were much lower than the 1985 estimates. Mean levels of alpha-HCH, gamma-HCH, dieldrin, cis-heptachlor-epoxide (0. 7 ng <b>g</b> - 1 <b>fat),</b> sum-chlordane (6. 1 ng <b>g</b> - 1 <b>fat),</b> trans-nonachlor (12. 0 ng <b>g</b> - 1 <b>fat),</b> BDE 47 (1. 9 ng <b>g</b> - 1 <b>fat)</b> and sum PBDE (3. 4 ng <b>g</b> - 1 <b>fat)</b> were comparable to the international median levels of the 15 other countries participating in the 2002 - 03 WHO exposure study. Hong Kong had the highest level of beta-HCH, possibly a residual effect of previous high exposures in the 1970 s. Body loads of beta-HCH and chlordane were lower among mothers with younger age while mothers born in mainland China had lower levels of beta-HCH, cis-heptachlor-epoxide, oxy-chlordane and trans-nonachlor. Levels of toxaphene, endrin, endosulfan, bromcyclene and nitrofen were not detected in all or almost all of the milk pools. Continuous monitoring of POPs in human milk, especially beta-HCH, is needed for surveillance and interpretation of time trends, and for linkage to strict enforcement of agricultural regulations. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Human milk {{samples were}} {{collected}} from 50 breast-feeding mothers in Shijiazhuang, 60 in Tianjin and 48 in Yantai from November 2006 to April 2007. The three areas are located in northern China. We selected randomly 20 samples from each area for detection of polychlorinated dibenzodioxins/frans (PCDD/Fs), polycholorinated biphenyls (dl-PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) by high-resolution gas chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRGC/HRMS). Our results show the average concentrations of PCDD/Fs plus dl-PCBs were 6. 24 TEQ pg <b>g</b> 1 <b>fat,</b> 7. 54 TEQ pg <b>g</b> 1 <b>fat</b> and 6. 69 TEQ pg <b>g</b> 1 <b>fat</b> in human milk from Shijiazhuang, Tianjin and Yantai, respectively.

Among congeners of PBDEs, {{the high and low}} brominated congeners BDE 209, BDE 207, BDE 197, BDE 153, BDE 15, BDE 28 and BDE 47 were the predominant PBDE congeners, accounting for 91 %, 90 % and 84 % of total PBDEs in samples from Shijiazhuang, Tianjin and Yantai, respectively. Based on the results of an in-person interview of mothers using a questionnaire, freshwater fish consumption was found to correlate with total mono-ortho dl-PCBs (mo-PCBs) and sea fish consumption was found to correlate with total non-ortho dl-PCBs (no-PCBs) of human milk in these areas. However, no correlation was found between concentrations of total PBDEs and total TEQ of PCDD/Fs plus dl-PCBs and food consumption. Continuous surveillance on dioxins and dl-PCBs levels in human milk is needed to correctly evaluate both the environmental impact and human health risk in China. No Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} organic {{system on the}} fatty acid profile of milk and CLA content was {{evaluated}} using 30 pregnant pluriparous goats, divided into two homogeneous groups (S and O) of 15 goats each. Group S was housed in a stable and received alfalfa hay as forage, while group O was raised according EC Regulation 834 / 2007 and led to pasture. After the kids weaning, goats were milked twice a day for 5 months. Daily milk yield was recorded and, monthly, representative milk samples from the two daily milkings were analysed for chemical and fatty acid profile. Average milk yield did not differ statistically between the groups. The goats of the O group had significantly higher fat content in milk than those of group S (65. 9 g/day vs. 54. 3 g/day, P < 0. 01). Among milk fatty acids, organic system significantly affected the percentages of C 18 : 1 c 9, C 18 : 1 t 11, linoleic acid, alpha-linolenic acid, monounsaturated fatty acid and polyunsaturated fatty acid. Organic system highly influenced the c 9 t 11 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) (0. 810 g/ 100 <b>g</b> of <b>fat</b> vs. 0. 542 g/ 100 <b>g</b> of <b>fat,</b> for groups O and S, respectively, P < 0. 01), t 10 c 12 CLA (0. 041 g/ 100 <b>g</b> of <b>fat</b> vs. 0. 024 g/ 100 <b>g</b> of <b>fat,</b> for groups O and S, respectively, P < 0. 01) and ∑CLA (0. 87 g/ 100 <b>g</b> of <b>fat</b> vs. 0. 58 g/ 100 <b>g</b> of <b>fat</b> for groups O and S, respectively, P < 0. 01) concentrations of milk...|$|R
