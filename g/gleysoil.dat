40|$|In this work, {{using the}} EPR spectroscopy, we {{analysed}} the thermal stability of some organic-mineral compounds {{found in a}} <b>Gleysoil</b> from Rio Janeiro. It was observed a complete disappearance of the EPR signal around 600 °C for the < 2 µm fraction and a residual EPR signal of semiquinone free radical for the 2 - 20 µm and 20 - 53 µm fractions at the same temperature. Also, the experiments showed that the 2 - 20 µm fraction had a larger concentration of semiquinone free radical per g of carbon and a smaller line width indicated a larger humification of this fraction. This is an evidence that the soil organic matter of this fraction (2 - 20 µm) is more stable than the other ones...|$|E

40|$|In this work, seven {{samples of}} humic acids {{extracted}} from <b>gleysoils</b> were investigated. These studies, using NMR CP/MAS 13 C techniques, {{did not show}} significant correlation between the E 4 /E 6 ratio {{and the degree of}} aromaticity. However, dipolar dephasing (DD) measurements of condensed aromatic or substituted carbons showed a negative correlation of 0. 94. Also, there was a good correlation between the amount of semiquinone free radicals measured by the EPR technique and condensed aromatic rings measured by NMR CP/MAS 13 C with the DD technique. The content of semiquinone free radicals was quantified by EPR spectroscopy and was correlated with the humification (degree of aromaticity) of the humic substances. The results indicated that the E 4 /E 6 ratio identifies the degree of aromatic rings condensation. It was also found that the degree of aromaticity, measured by NMR, as frequently presented in the literature (by conventional CP/MAS), underestimates aromatic rings in condensed structures...|$|R
40|$|The {{soil survey}} was to obtain {{data on the}} {{community}} of Didam, because of agricultural, economic and social problems (many smallholders) and to find the possibility of extending horticulture. Other studies were of pleistocene cover sands and holocene geology, soil formation, vegetational and occupational history since palaeolithic times. The soil map consists of physiographic units, an old reclamation sand landscape, a recent reclamation landscape and a river-clay landscape. Each of these soil landscapes was classified into soil series and types, based on thickness of topsoil, depth of gleying and mechanical composition, all of direct value for agriculture. The old reclaimed sand landscape was, for example, classified into old arable sand soils (plaggen soils) and old grassland soils (Humic <b>Gleysoils).</b> Some trial samples were taken to compare the productivity of the soil types. It was concluded that agricultural crops showed more pronounced differences than grassland, because also management played an important part. Horticulture might be improved {{by taking advantage of}} natural circumstances (soil, water control). A remarkable fact, studied in this area, was the deposit of iron ochre in many subsoils, caused by seepage water from the hills of Montferland. It consisted chiefly of goethite (α-FeOOH) and affected growth of crops. <p/...|$|R
40|$|The Brazilian System of Soil Classification (SiBCS) is a taxonomic system, {{open and}} in {{permanent}} construction, as new knowledge on Brazilian soils is obtained. The {{objective of this}} study was to characterize the chemical, physical, morphological, micro-morphological and mineralogical properties of four pedons of Oxisols in a highland toposequence in the upper Jequitinhonha Valley, emphasizing aspects of their genesis, classification and landscape development. The pedons occupy the following slope positions: summit - Red Oxisol (LV), mid slope (upper third) - Yellow-Red Oxisol (LVA), lower slope (middle third) - Yellow Oxisol (LA) and bottom of the valley (lowest third) - "Gray Oxisol" ("LAC"). These pedons were described and sampled for characterization in chemical and physical routine analyses. The total Fe, Al and Mn contents were determined by sulfuric attack and the Fe, Al and Mn oxides in dithionite-citrate-bicarbonate and oxalate extraction. The mineralogy of silicate clays was identified by X ray diffraction and the Fe oxides were detected by differential X ray diffraction. Total Ti, Ga and Zr contents were determined by X ray fluorescence spectrometry. The "LAC" is gray-colored and contains significant fragments of structure units in the form of a dense paste, characteristic of a <b>gleysoil,</b> in the horizons A and BA. All pedons are very clayey, dystrophic and have low contents of available P and a pH of around 5. The soil color was related to the Fe oxide content, which decreased along the slope. The decrease of crystalline and low- crystalline Fe along the slope confirmed the loss of Fe from the "LAC". Total Si increased along the slope and total Al remained constant. The clay fraction in all pedons was dominated by kaolinite and gibbsite. Hematite and goethite were identified in LV, low-intensity hematite and goethite in LVA, goethite in LA. In the "LAC", no hematite peaks and goethite were detected by differential X ray diffraction. The micro-morphology indicated prevalence of granular microstructure and porosity with complex stacking patterns [...] The soil properties in the toposequence converged to a single soil class, the Oxisols, derived from the same source material. The landscape evolution and genesis of Oxisols of the highlands in the upper Jequitinhonha Valley are related to the evolution of the drainage system and the activity of excavating fauna...|$|E
40|$|O presente trabalho foi conduzido em casa-de-vegetação do Departamento de Ciência do Solo da Universidade Federal de Lavras, no período de fevereiro a junho de 2002, com os objetivos de avaliar para o arroz (Oriza sativa L. cv. Jequitibá), cultivado em solos de várzea inundados, a resposta à adubação potássica e a contribuição das formas de K na nutrição, e estimar os níveis críticos do nutriente nos solos e na planta. O delineamento {{experimental}} utilizado foi o inteiramente casualizado, em esquema fatorial 4 x 5, com quatro repetições, sendo quatro solos de várzea [Neossolo Flúvico (RU), Gleissolo Háplico (GX), Gleissolo Melânico (GM) e Organossolo Mésico (OY) ] e cinco níveis de saturação por K da CTC potencial (natural, 4, 6, 8 e 10 %). As saturações naturais foram de 1, 49, 1, 65, 1, 30 e 1, 55 % para os solos RU, GX, GM e OY, respectivamente. Inicialmente, amostras suficientes de 4 dm³ dos solos receberam correção com calcário para elevar a V a 50 % e incubados por 30 dias. Em seguida, amostras de 3 dm³ dos solos receberam os tratamentos com potássio e uma adubação básica com macro e micronutrientes e foram incubados por mais 30 dias em vasos com capacidade para 5 dm³. No final desse período, os solos foram inundados onde se cultivaram duas plantas de arroz por vaso, nas quais avaliaram-se os teores foliares de K no florescimento e a produção de grãos no final do ciclo. Em subamostras obtidas dos solos dos vasos antes e após o cultivo, analisaram-se as formas de potássio: K total (Ktot), K não-trocável (Knt), K trocável (Ktr), K em solução (Ksol) e K disponível pelo extrator Mehlich 1 (K M 1). Pelos resultados, verificou-se que o arroz respondeu em produção de grãos à adubação potássica em todos os solos estudados. Houve aproveitamento do Knt pela cultura, embora o Ktr tenha sido a forma que mais contribuiu no suprimento do nutriente. As saturações críticas por K para 90 % da produção máxima foram 4, 0, 8, 1, 7, 8 e 4, 4 % para os solos RU, GX, GM e OY, respectivamente. Da mesma forma, os níveis críticos foliares de K foram 9, 6, 11, 1, 10, 2 e 11, 5 g kg- 1. The present {{work was}} conducted in a greenhouse at the Department of Soil Science of the Federal University of Lavras, Minas Gerais State, Brazil, {{in the period of}} February to June 2002, to investigate the response to potassium fertilization by rice plants (Oriza sativa L. cv. Jequitibá) cultivated in flooded soils, the contribution of the K form on their nutrition, and to estimate the critic levels of the nutrient in the soils and in the plants. The experimental design utilized was the totally randomized, in the 4 x 5 factorial scheme, with four replications. Four flooded soils (Mesic Organosoil - OY, Melanic <b>Gleysoil</b> - GM, Haplic <b>Gleysoil</b> - GX, and Fluvic Neosoil - RU) and five levels of potassium saturation of the potential CEC (natural content, 4, 6, 8 and 10 % of the pH - 7. 0 CEC saturated with K) were used. Natural soil K saturations (percentage of pH- 7. 0 CEC) were 1. 55 for the OY soil, 1. 30 for the GM soil, 1. 65 for the GX soil, and 1. 49 for the RU soil. Initially, sufficient samples of 4 dm³ for all soils received limestone to elevate the V to 50 % and were incubated for 30 days. Following that, samples of 3 dm³ received the potassium treatments and a basic fertilization with macro and micronutrients and were incubated for more 30 days, in vases with capacity for 5 dm³. In the end of this period, the soils were flooded, to receive two rice plants per vase, on which were measured the leaf content of potassium at the flowering period and the yield {{at the end of the}} cycle. In sub-samples obtained from the soils of the vases before and after cultivation, the forms of potassium total K (Ktot), nonexchangeable K (Kne), exchangeable K (Ke), K in solution (Ksol) and available K by the Mehlich- 1 extractant were measured. From the results, it was verified that the plants responded in grain yield to the potassium fertilization in all the studied soils. There was uptake of Kne by the crop, however, it was the Ke form that contributed most to the supply of the nutrient. The critic saturation values of K to obtain 90 % of the maximum production were 4. 0, 8. 1, 7. 8, and 4. 4 % for the RU, GX, GM and the OY soils, respectively. On the same way, the critic leaf levels of K were 9. 6, 11. 1, 10. 2 and 11. 5 g kg- 1...|$|E
