Our sources of intelligence are such as cannot, by any possibility, be made public--and, indeed, such as no other London or European journal could, by any chance, acquire. But this we are free to say, that the very earliest information connected with the movement of English and Continental politics will be found only in the columns of the Pall Mall Gazette, The Statesman and the Capitalist, the Country Gentleman and the Divine, will be amongst our readers, because our writers are amongst them. We address ourselves to the higher circles of society: we care not to disown it--the Pall Mall Gazette is written by gentlemen for gentlemen; its conductors speak to the classes in which they live and were born. The field-preacher has his journal, the radical free-thinker has his journal: why should the Gentlemen of England be unrepresented in the Press?'" ...|$|E

Thai foreign policy has been viewed as a reactive, simplistic response to outside forces. The verification of two assumptions examined in this study indicate that Thai foreign policy has been complex, rational, and anticipatory; and that the values and attitudes of career Thai diplomats may have been more influential than previously thought. The first assumption contends that the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs evolved from a traditional structure with a rational, defined function: the systematic regulation of foreign nationals and Thai international commerce. This system, labeled the Krom Tha system, integrated all foreigners into the nai/phrai system. It also protected the domestic economy from world market forces. The Krom Tha system was the focal issue that nineteenth century Westerners challenged and sought to change. The second assumption contends that the Krom Tha system was managed from its inception almost continuously for three hundred years by the Bunnak family. The Bunnaks met the challenge of nineteenth century Western demands for free, unrestricted trade while preserving the principles of the Krom Tha system and their own fiscal and political interests. The Bunnaks were unable to develop a structure that could accommodate both the principles of the Krom Tha system and modern, Western diplomatic practice. This was accomplished by the Brahmin/Chakri Family which had been contending with the Bunnaks for control over the Krom Tha system since the late seventeenth century. Under the leadership of Prince Thewawong Thewakun, Bunnak control was gradually by-passed. After Prince Thewawong took control of the Foreign Ministry, he modernized its structure along the lines of Western ministries and he promoted the development of a professional diplomatic corps. A Senior <b>Diplomatic</b> <b>Circle,</b> dominated by his sons, evolved. The prestige and professionalism of the Circle allowed it to command influence over foreign policy. They were strong enough to perpetuate their ideals through a conservative policy of personnel recruitment and promotion.
