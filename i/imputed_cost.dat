50|$|In economics, an {{implicit}} cost, also called an <b>imputed</b> <b>cost,</b> implied cost, or notional cost, {{is the opportunity}} cost equal to what a firm must give up {{in order to use}} a factor of production for which it already owns and thus does not pay rent. It is the opposite of an explicit cost, which is borne directly. In other words, {{an implicit}} cost is any cost that results from using an asset instead of renting it out or selling it. The term also applies to foregone income from choosing not to work.|$|E
40|$|The study {{estimates}} {{the cost of}} production, yield, farm inputs, net revenue, economic and business profit of BT cotton cultivators in district Multan of Punjab province (Pakistan). This study uses the comprehensive survey from Multan district to analyze the profitability level by collecting data on different variables. The study shows that farmers grow BT cotton because it provides resistance against cotton bollworms infestations and gives higher yields. The study {{estimates the}} impacts of BT cotton adoption on producer benefits, returns and also adoption status which is classified into small, medium and large farmers. Economic profit and gross margin depict the farmer’s economic conditions. In the study area large farmers of Multan district having more net revenue and gross margin as compared with Medium and small farmers of Multan district because of more inputs induction {{for the sake of}} more profitability. The analysis of Benefit Cost Ratio (BCR) depicts that BCR with <b>imputed</b> <b>cost</b> is less than one in all the cases i. e. small, medium and large while it is more than one without <b>imputed</b> <b>cost.</b> It means that farmers do not get profit if <b>imputed</b> <b>cost</b> is included in total cost. BCR is highest for small farmers followed by large farmers in case of without <b>imputed</b> <b>cost</b> estimation. It may be due to engagement of all family members in all the operations of crop cultivation. So they save labor expenses...|$|E

The valuation of travel time derived here appears to reflect more the opportunity cost of foregone hunting than the opportunity cost of foregone work.

40|$|The Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) is a longitudinal, {{multipurpose}} panel {{survey of}} a nationally {{representative sample of}} Medicare beneficiaries sponsored by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The MCBS serves as a comprehensive data source on self-reported health and socioeconomic status, health insurance, healthcare utilization and costs, and patient satisfaction. CMS uses Medicare claims data to validate self-reported Medicare Fee-For-Service (FFS) utilization. Because the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) does not bill for services, CMS <b>imputes</b> VHA <b>costs.</b> This article addresses {{the quality of the}} MCBS dataset for conducting research on Medicare-eligible veterans by addressing the sample's representativeness, quality of self-reported data, and accuracy of <b>imputed</b> VHA <b>cost</b> estimates. We compared demographic data from the 1992 and 2001 National Survey of Veterans (NSV) with the MCBS 1992 and 2001 Cost and Use files. We compared self-reported VHA utilization and CMS's <b>imputed</b> <b>costs</b> with VHA administrative datasets. The VHA's Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM) database is available from fiscal year (FY) 1999 onward, and the VHA Health Economics Resource Center's (HERC) Average Cost datasets are available from FY 1998 onward. While the samples were comparable in terms of age, sex, and race, the MCBS respondents were in better health, less likely to be married, and more likely to be widowed than NSV respondents. MCBS underreporting rates were higher for VHA than Medicare outpatient events. Underreporting and differences between CMS's and HERC's costing methodologies contributed to lower MCBS versus VHA administrative person- and event- level costs. Alternatively, average annual VHA prescription costs per capita were higher in the MCBS than in the PBM data. Differences in socioeconomic characteristics of the NSV and MCBS samples may be attributable to differences in sampling methodologies. Higher underreporting rates for VHA versus Medicare FFS outpatient events are likely due to systemic differences between the VHA and private healthcare sectors. While VHA formulary discounts may not be reflected in MCBS's VHA prescriptions costs, lower PBM prescriptions costs are also due to deficient indirect cost data. Since reliable VHA utilization and cost data existed in either FY 1998 or FY 1999 onward, study goals include estimating the relative share and/or cost of care provided by Medicare and the VHA. Researchers with access to VHA datasets should consider merging them into the MCBS and replacing self-reported utilization and CMS's <b>imputed</b> <b>costs</b> with VHA administrative data. This replacement would significantly improve the accuracy, quality, and usefulness of the MCBS dataset for policy research...|$|R

40|$|Lot {{streaming}} is {{a technique}} used to split a processing batch into several transfer batches. In this way, overlapping operations can be performed in different manufacturing stages, and production can be accelerated. This paper proposes two cost models for solving lot streaming problems in a multistage flow shop. The purpose {{is to determine the}} optimal processing batch size and the optimal number of transfer batches that minimize the total annual cost in each model. In the first model, a more complete and accurate method is developed to compute the costs of raw materials, work-in-process, and finished-product inventories. The total cost includes the setup cost, the transfer batch movement cost, the three-type inventory holding cost, and the finished-product shipment cost. The second model contains not only the four costs in the first model, but also the <b>imputed</b> <b>cost</b> associated with the makespan time. The total annual cost functions in both models are shown to be convex, and two solution approaches are suggested. An experiment consisting of three phases was conducted to explore the effect on the optimal solution when changing the value of one parameter at a time. The results indicate that three parameters have significant effects on the optimal solution. Lot streaming Processing batch Transfer batch Multistage flow shop Cost model...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} the order-fulfillment process of a supplier producing a customized capital good, such as production equipment, commercial aircraft, medical devices, or defense systems. As {{is common in}} these industries, prior to receiving a firm purchase order from the customer, the supplier receives a series of shared forecasts, which are called "soft orders. " Facing a stochastic internal manufacturing lead time, the supplier must decide at what time to begin the fulfillment of the order. This decision requires a trade-off between starting too early, leading to potential holding or cancellation costs, and starting too late, leading to potential delay costs. We collect detailed data of shared forecasts, actual purchase orders, production lead times, and delivery dates for a supplier-buyer dyad in the semiconductor equipment supply chain. Under {{the assumption that the}} supplier acts rationally, optimally balancing the cancellation, holding, and delay costs, we are able to estimate the corresponding <b>imputed</b> <b>cost</b> parameters based on the observed data. Our estimation results reveal that the supplier perceives the cost of cancellation to be about two times higher and the holding costs to be about three times higher than the delay cost. In other words, the supplier is very conservative when commencing the order fulfillment, which undermines the effectiveness of the overall forecast-sharing mechanism.

For example, in the Posole gang injunction case in San Diego, ten murders occurred over the two-year period before the injunction was implemented, whereas no murders occurred during the four years following the implementation and enforcement of the injunction. No other suppression was noted by the Oceanside Police besides the injunction. Assuming that the decline in crime was caused by the gang injunction and that the decline would not have occurred in the injunction's absence, the $20,000 cost of implementing the injunction was significantly less than the expected cost of alternatives, according to estimates by the National Institute of Justice.|$|R

Psychosocial factors appear to be of importance in the transition of acute to chronic LBP. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the cost-effectiveness of an intervention aimed at psychosocial factors to usual care in patients with (sub) acute LBP. The study design was an economic evaluation alongside a cluster-randomized controlled trial, conducted from a societal perspective with a follow-up of 1  year. Sixty general practitioners in 41 general practices recruited 314 patients with non-specific LBP of less than 12 weeks’ duration. General practitioners in the minimal intervention strategy (MIS) group explored and discussed psychosocial prognostic factors. Usual care (UC) was not protocolized. Clinical outcomes were functional disability (Roland–Morris Disability Questionnaire), perceived recovery and health-related quality of life (EuroQol). Cost data consisted of direct and indirect costs and were measured by patient cost diaries and general practitioner registration forms. Complete cost data were available for 80 % of the patients. Differences in clinical outcomes between both the groups were small and not statistically significant. Differences in cost data were in favor of MIS. However, the complete case analysis and the sensitivity analyses with <b>imputed</b> <b>cost</b> data were inconsistent with regard to the statistical significance of this difference in cost data.

40|$|Hospitals are labor {{intensive}} facilities based on highly skilled employees. A merger of hospitals {{is an effort}} to increase and rationalize this production. Decisions behind a merger are made at the top leadership level. How this might be done is demonstrated by examples from a 36 bed acute psychiatric facility. The aim {{of the study was to}} calculate the hidden costs of fragmented destruction of parts of a total hospital supply to patients after a merger. Fragmented destruction is the deliberate stopping of activities deemed not part of the core activities of the hospital without due consideration of the impact on core activities. The proposed changes to operational expenses at a single acute psychiatric hospital were materials for the study. The changes included activities as a reduction in local laboratory service, cleaning services, closure of physiotherapy unit, closing of cultural activities and reduced productivity. The selected activities are calculated as giving an imputed gain of € 630, 000 as indicated by the leadership. The not calculated costs of reducing or removing the selected activities are estimated at € 1, 955, 640. The cost of staff disappointment after a merger is difficult to assess, but is probably higher than assumed in the present calculations. <b>Imputed</b> <b>cost</b> containment is not attained. The calculations indicate that implemented changes may increase cost, contrary to the belief of the leadership at both the hospital level and further up in the hospital trust. Arguments in favor of a merger have to be scrutinized thoroughly for optimistic neglect of uncalculated costs of mergers. Future hospital mergers and selected fragmentation of productive tasks at ward or hospital levels should include calculations of unavoidable costs as shown in the present paper...|$|E

40|$|AbstractEnteric methane {{emission}} {{is a major}} greenhouse gas from livestock production systems worldwide. Dietary manipulation may be an effective emission-reduction tool; however, the associated costs may preclude its use as a mitigation strategy. Several studies have identified dietary manipulation strategies for the mitigation of emissions, but studies examining the costs of reducing methane by manipulating diets are scarce. Furthermore, the trade-off between increase in dietary costs and reduction in {{methane emission}}s has only been determined for {{a limited number of}} production scenarios. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop an optimization framework for the joint minimization of dietary costs and methane emissions based on the identification of a set of feasible solutions for various levels of trade-off between emissions and costs. Such a set of solutions was created by the specification of a systematic grid of goal programming weights, enabling the decision maker to choose the solution that achieves the desired trade-off level. Moreover, the model enables the calculation of emission-mitigation <b>costs</b> <b>imputing</b> a trading value for methane emissions. Emission <b>imputed</b> <b>costs</b> can be used in emission-unit trading schemes, such as cap-and-trade policy designs. An application of the model using data from lactating cows from dairies in the California Central Valley is presented to illustrate the use of model-generated results in the identification of optimal diets when reducing emissions. The optimization framework is flexible and can be adapted to jointly minimize diet costs and other potential environmental impacts (e. g., nitrogen excretion). It is also flexible so that dietary costs, feed nutrient composition, and animal nutrient requirements can be altered to accommodate various production systems...|$|R

DESIGN: Multivariate regression models {{using data from the}} 1993 Asset and Health Dynamics Study, a {{nationally representative}} survey of people aged 70 and older (N = 7, 443). SETTING: Community-dwelling older people. PARTICIPANTS: National population-based sample of community-dwelling older people. MEASUREMENTS: Weekly hours of informal caregiving, and <b>imputed</b> <b>cost</b> of caregiver time, for community-dwelling older people who reported (1) no unintended urine loss, (2) incontinence that did not require the use of absorbent pads, and (3) incontinence that required the use of absorbent pads. RESULTS: Thirteen percent of men and 24 % of women reported incontinence. After adjusting for sociodemographics, living situation, and comorbidities, continent men received 7. 4 hours per week of care, incontinent men who did not use pads received 11. 3 hours, and incontinent men who used pads received 16. 6 hours (P <. 001). Women in these groups received 5. 9, 7. 6, and 10. 7 hours (P <. 001), respectively. The additional yearly cost of informal care associated with incontinence was $ 1, 700 and $ 4, 000 for incontinent men who did not and did use pads, respectively, whereas, for women in these groups, the additional yearly cost was $ 700 and $ 2, 000. Overall, this represents a national annual cost of more than $ 6 billion for incontinence-related informal care. CONCLUSIONS: The quantity of informal caregiving for older people with incontinence and its associated economic cost are substantial. Future analyses of the costs of incontinence, and the cost-effectiveness of interventions to prevent or treat incontinence, should consider the significant informal caregiving costs associated with this condition...|$|E
40|$|The Federal Reserve System is an {{important}} participant in the nation's payments system, which is the infrastructure used for transmitting and settling payments between individuals, firms, and government entities. For example, {{as reported in the}} Federal Reserve System's 2004 annual report, the twelve Federal Reserve Banks processed about 16 billion checks, or about 45 %, of the 37 billion checks written in 2003. In addition, the Federal Reserve provides fully electronic payments services, such as automated clearing house services. Since the Federal Reserve is required to charge fees for these services, they are known collectively as "priced services. " Private sector firms, including some large banking organizations, also provide certain of these priced services, such as check processing.; To promote efficiency and competition in the national payments system for these priced services, Congress passed the Monetary Control Act (MCA) of 1980, which requires the Federal Reserve Banks to set fees that, over the long run, recover all the direct and indirect costs of providing those services. In addition, the MCA requires that those fees recover imputed costs, such as taxes and a cost of capital, that would be incurred if the services were provided by a private firm. These imputed costs are known collectively within the Federal Reserve System as the private sector adjustment factor (PSAF).; The methodology underlying the computation of the PSAF is reviewed periodically to ensure that it is appropriate and relevant in light of Reserve Banks' price services activities as well as current accounting standards, finance theory, and regulatory and business practices. Such a review was conducted and changes implemented in 2005 starting with the 2006 PSAF calculations; see Board of Governors (2005). In this Economic Letter, we focus specifically on the current decision to set the Reserve Banks' <b>imputed</b> <b>cost</b> of equity equal to that of the overall stock market.

3000|$|The {{different}} {{characteristics of}} utilization and progress {{decisions in the}} domain of time lead us to derive separate hypotheses for the impact of the time delay between subsequent decisions on the sunk-cost effect. Again, we first focus on utilization decisions. Prelec and Loewenstein (1998) integrate Thaler’s (1980, 1985) idea of mental accounts in an evaluation of consumption and payment events. They specify that consumers feel the pain of paying at the time of product purchase, which must be deducted from the pleasure of consumption. Their model comes with two main assumptions: prospective accounting and coupling. Prospective accounting postulates that consumers mentally depreciate past payments, but consider future payments in their full amount. In coupling, individuals create a psychological link between the payment and the consumption of a transaction. In line with their argumentation, coupling moderates the impact of payment on consumption such that the pain of paying attenuates consumption utility and the consumption pleasure buffers the pain of paying. The <b>imputed</b> <b>costs</b> are the highest right after payment and decrease over time. Gourville and Soman (1998) label this gradual adaptation to sunk costs {{with the passage of time}} as payment depreciation. Consequently, the sunk-cost effect should be more present in temporal proximity to the payment. Therefore, we propose the following hypothesis: [...]...|$|R

The program, which is co-administered by the Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Customs and Border Patrol (CBP), has a gap for several reasons: 1) APHIS's authority does not permit it to charge all persons seeking entry to the United States (e. g., pedestrians) and does not permit it to charge the costs of those inspections to others; 2) APHIS has chosen not to charge some classes of passengers, citing administrative fee collection difficulties; 3) CBP does not charge a portion of all primary inspections to agriculture functions, as required by CBP guidance; 4) APHIS does not consider all <b>imputed</b> <b>costs</b> (that is, costs incurred by other agencies {{on behalf of the}} AQI program) when setting fees; and 5) the allowable rates for overtime services are misaligned with the personnel costs of performing those services. APHIS is considering fees that would better align many, but not all, AQI fees with related inspection activity costs. APHIS and CBP can take additional steps to better align fees with costs; however, additional authority will be needed to fully recover all program costs. ...|$|R
40|$|If {{we review}} the {{literature}} of the 1970 s, it is possible to discern two strands which have been very influential in the formulation of policies towards the financial sector of LDC economies. The first is a degree of antipathy to informal finance, exemplified by Rozental's complaint that: [Moneylenders in the unorganized sector] create a pattern of interest rates which weigh heavily on those least able to bear the explicit or <b>imputed</b> <b>costs</b> of borrowing [...] . they perpetuate forms of behaviour not conducive to social discipline and responsibility (Rozental 1970 : 18). The second is the notion that economic development can be encouraged by promoting financial develop-ment. This was presumably the intent of the ILO's recommendation that: [...] . the total scale of financial resources in the organized sector must be greatly expanded so that those who are at present using the unorganized system, and those who have had to rely on self-finance, can be accom-modated (ILO 1974 : 242). Both these views suffered from tunnel vision. Those who criticized informal finance either were not aware of, or simply chose to ignore, the wide variety of financing arrangements which characterized it [...] preferring instead {{to think in terms of}} the harsh moneylender stereotype. They complained about "exorbitant " interest rates, but failed to consider the actual costs of lending—the high transactions costs inherent in small-scale loans, the costs of additional services sometimes provided by lenders (including risk-sharing, in some cases) ...|$|R

We measure the amount of reallocation using data on flows of capital across firms and the benefits to capital reallocation using several measures of the cross sectional dispersion of the productivity of capital. We then study a calibrated model economy where capital reallocation is costly and <b>impute</b> the <b>cost</b> of reallocation. We find that the cost of reallocation needs to be substantially countercyclical to be consistent with the observed joint cyclical properties of reallocation and productivity dispersion.

40|$|The Accelerated Wheat Production Programme (AWPP) is Nigeria's latest {{effort to}} attain {{self-sufficiency}} and self-reliance in wheat production after {{the ban on}} importation of wheat and wheat-related produets in 1986. The programme aims at mobilising the indigenous small-scale farmers, using small irrigation pumps, the provision of the necessary farm inputs at subsidised rates, extension services and attractive commodity prices. This paper exarnines {{the economics of the}} AWPP in Kano and Kaduna States, Nigeria. 1 The research methodology is based on a farm budget/input-output analysis. Data on farming operations and crop yields were collected during the 1989 / 90 cropping season, then collated and analysed. <b>Imputed</b> <b>costs</b> were used in the case of services that were not purchased directly in the open market. First, the results indicate that wheat produetion is more profitable in Kano State where an average 26 per cent profit margin per hectare was achieved, but was less attractive in Kaduna state where farmers were unable to cover their operation costs. Secondly, while the current price incentive for wheat was found to be sufficiently attractive to induce farmers to remain in production, it was far from being alright for the Nigerian Flour Millers Association and, inevitably, the consumers who cannot afford the price of wheat bread. Thirdly, this inefficient pricing system has paradoxically created some marketing problems in the country. Factors responsible for the low profit margin were identified as being extremely low yields; inadequacy of water supply; inappropriate farming and irrigation management practices; inefficient and ineffective extension services; and a poor input delivery system. This and other problems of wheat produetion in Nigeria are discussed in this paper...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{efficiency}} {{in the public}} sector. It argues that the habit of relating efficiency to public spending, as is generally done, may give wrong results when, {{as is often the}} case, public institutions use public assets (land, buildings, etc.) without <b>imputing</b> a <b>cost</b> for that use. The paper argues that, because of lack of incentives, governments are often wasteful in their use of publicly held assets. It recommends the creation of “cadastres” of publicly owned assets {{that could be used for}} several purposes including increasing public sector efficiency.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In 2005, we {{presented}} {{for the first}} time overall estimates of annual costs for brain disorders (mental and neurologic disorders) in Europe. This new report presents updated, more accurate, and comprehensive 2010 estimates for 30 European countries. METHODS: One-year prevalence and annual cost per person of 19 major groups of disorders are based on 'best estimates' derived from systematic literature reviews by panels of experts in epidemiology and health economics. Our cost estimation model was populated with national statistics from Eurostat to adjust to 2010 values, converting all local currencies to Euros (euro), <b>imputing</b> <b>cost</b> for countries where no data were available, and aggregating country estimates to purchasing power parity-adjusted estimates of the total cost of brain disorders in Europe in 2010. RESULTS: Total European 2010 cost of brain disorders was euro 798 billion, of which direct health care cost 37 %, direct non-medical cost 23 %, and indirect cost 40 %. Average cost per inhabitant was euro 5. 550. The European average cost per person with a disorder of the brain ranged between euro 285 for headache and euro 30 000 for neuromuscular disorders. Total annual cost per disorder (in billion euro 2010) was as follows: addiction 65. 7; anxiety disorders 74. 4; brain tumor 5. 2; child/adolescent disorders 21. 3; dementia 105. 2; eating disorders 0. 8; epilepsy 13. 8; headache 43. 5; mental retardation 43. 3; mood disorders 113. 4; multiple sclerosis 14. 6; neuromuscular disorders 7. 7; Parkinson's disease 13. 9; personality disorders 27. 3; psychotic disorders 93. 9; sleep disorders 35. 4; somatoform disorder 21. 2; stroke 64. 1; and traumatic brain injury 33. 0. CONCLUSION: Our cost model revealed that brain disorders overall are much more costly than previously estimated constituting a major health economic challenge for Europe. Our estimate should be regarded as conservative because many disorders or cost items could not be included because of lack of data...|$|R
40|$|In {{a rapidly}} {{developing}} country without an adequate mortgage market, {{it is difficult}} to <b>impute</b> the <b>cost</b> of owning a home and, as a result, this cost is often omitted from the Consumer Price Index (CPI). To resolve this difficulty, by using an intertemporal consumption allocation model, this paper develops a method for deriving the user cost of owner-occupied housing which is in turn incorporated in the so-called True Cost of Living Index (TCLI). When applied to Korea as an example, the statistical results show substantially higher inflation than previously assumed, indicating the importance of homeownership cost in measuring the standard of living for a developing country. Thus, in both theory and practice, our TCLI based on the Diewert-superlative chain index is superior to the conventional fixed weight CPI, indicating its usefulness not just for Korea but also for other countries [C 43, D 11, O 53]...|$|R
