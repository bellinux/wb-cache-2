We describe a real-time and online optimization technique based on genetic algorithms (GA) for print factory workflow optimization. We have simulated digital-print factory manufacturing activities as a heterogeneous, concurrent and integrated system. The simulation {{is based on}} a virtual print factory, which incorporates real factory characteristics such as successive order acceptances, diverse production lines, various resource types and quantities, and stochastic machine malfunctions. The optimization objective is {{to reduce the number of}} orders that miss deadlines, balance resource utilization, and ensure <b>just-in</b> <b>time</b> <b>production.</b> The optimization technique has been integrated into the virtual factory as a factory scheduler and resource assignment engine. Significant improvements have been achieved using the GA heuristic compared to baseline methods that are currently implemented in an actual industrial setting...|$|E

The need of a common framework is even more acute in modern organizations, where knowledge management and competence development become impossible to circumvent. In this paper, we introduce our solution to manage organizational knowledge through the creation and management of an ontology-based Organizational Memory (OM).

They wonder to what extent MRP can provide support for JIT production. This paper describes how JIT can be embedded into MRP. A three-step framework is described which makes use of MRP's backflushing and phantom features, and permits JIT principles to be used to the furthest extent possible. The JIT benefits that will be reported by MRP, as well as those that remain hidden because of MRP, are outlined. Observations from work with North American and Western European manufacturers are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{aimed at}} {{designing}} {{and developing a}} system that can a) infer individuals’ need for a break from sedentary behaviour in the workplace, and b) persuade them {{to take a break}} through the use of different techniques from persuasive psychology. We postulated three variables, namely, individuals’ posture, stress levels and involvement in their computer mediated activity. We developed and field-studied a system that could infer these using a web camera and a key presses and mouse clicks log. We found that the system could predict posture from viewing depth and stress from the movement detected. We then created a general formula that predicts individuals’ need for a break using only the posture and stress predictors. Once the first objective was set, we built and field-studied a system that used three ways to communicate a recommendation for a break to a user: implicit, <b>just-in</b> <b>time</b> and ambient feedback. The implicit feedback was operationalized through changes in the users’ computer wallpaper that provided subtle visual cues. The <b>just-in</b> <b>time</b> feedback employed prompting at the bottom right side of the user’s screen. In addition, we implemented an intuitive behind-screen interaction technique where people can snooze a notification using simple gestures. The ambient feedback mechanism employed an origami sculpture sitting on the user’s desk. This prototype was continuously reflecting the user’s posture and performed rhythmic movements when to recommend breaks. A field study demonstrated the overall success of the system, with 69 % of the break recommendations received by users were accepted. The study further revealed {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the three persuasive mechanisms...|$|R

Before the assessment, the teacher defines the specific observables to be evaluated {{through the use of}} the tool. Once the observables are identified, four levels of achievement for each observable are described in the tool. The # 5 c 21 tool allows a pre-test, post-test or <b>just-in</b> <b>time</b> teacher-based assessment or learner self-assessment which aims at collecting the level of achievement in each observable for the activity. At the end of {{a certain period of time}} (e.g., session and academic year) the teacher can generate reports showing the evolution in learners’ CT assessment.|$|R

40|$|Learning {{design is}} part of the {{multifaceted}} role of the university teacher. However, very few university teachers have expertise in this field. The Educational Design Team at Monash University is addressing this need by developing a suite of digitally enabled capacity-building resources to support teachers at their point of need as they work towards enhancing teaching and learning practice. These resources, known as the BLT (Better Learning and Teaching) Bytes, provide just-in-time answers whilst also enabling and enhancing further understanding of the learning design process. These self-access digital resources are designed to support individuals and foster the development of communities of practice. This paper addresses the rationale for a <b>just-in</b> <b>time</b> approach to professional learning in the higher education context.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between just-in-time technique and manufacturing performance of some selected Nigerian companies. <b>Just-in</b> <b>time</b> {{was considered to be}} an overall organisational phenomenon. Data were obtained through a structured questionnaire from a sample size of 300 knowledgeable employees to test the developed model and formulated hypotheses that cover both just-intime and the supporting infrastructures. Bivariate correlation analysis was used to test the three hypotheses. The results showed that: (1) there was a significant relationship between total quality management (supporting infrastructure) and just-in-time practices; (2) Human resources management (supporting infrastructure) was positively related to just-in-time practices; (3) there was a positive significant relationship between Just-in-time practices and manufacturing performance. These results demonstrate that justin- time practices can be successfully implemented if certain supporting infrastructures are provided, and also support the notion that just-in-time should be practiced at all levels and departments of the organisation, rather than viewing it strictly for shop floor workers...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to review {{possibilities}} for how Lean principles could be applied for university education and research – Lean Higher Learning and Lean Research. The Lean movement originating from Toyota Production Systems has inspired many different types of businesses and organisations including service and public organisations. Until now the Lean concept has not yet become widely used in university education. Universities could be facing strong competition from novel ways of teaching and learning – if the web offers lectures from Nobel Prize winners for free, why pay money to the local university to listen to a mediocre lecturer? If research proposals can be assessed and validated via a web site linking to acknowledged scholars, why wait for slow research journals? Possibly, Lean principles such as <b>just-in</b> <b>time</b> could be applied for better learning and research quality. This paper studies how traditional university education and research are performing compared to Lean principles with focus on value flow analysis. ...|$|R
40|$|Manufacturing {{organizations}} {{around the}} globe are now leaning towards <b>just-in</b> <b>time</b> or customized <b>production</b> {{in order to gain}} competitive advantage in an ever more intense marketplace. The problem with customized or variant production is that, organizations have to track the different product parts precisely {{in order to ensure that}} the right part is at the right place in the right amount at the right time, to deliver customized products to their customers. Due to this reason, companies are now increasingly using RFID technology to track production in real-time. The wide spread deployment of RFID technology for production monitoring and tracking is impeded by the fact that the technology is inherently unreliable and RFID readers suffer from errors such as duplicate, false, missed and out of order readings. In this work we have presented algorithms to a) enable real-time tracking and monitoring of product parts on the production lines, b) provide probabilistic guarantees to the real-time product parts that are being tracked c) enable the RFID readers to self-calibrate their reader probabilities so that the readings that they generate are highly reliable at all times d) generate complex manufacturing events and provide probabilistic guarantees for the accuracy of these complex manufacturing events. In particular the following contributions are made in this thesis. As a first contribution, we developed a consistency stack that conceptually divides the different consistency/reliability issues in production monitoring into separate layers. In addition to this we have built a consistency management framework to ensure consistent real-time production monitoring, using unreliable RFID devices. Secondly, we deal with the problem of detecting object sequences by a set of unreliable RFID readers that are installed along production lines. We propose a probabilistic sequence detection algorithm that assigns probabilities to objects detected by RFID devices and provides probabilistic guarantees regarding the real-time sequences of objects on the production lines. Thirdly, we developed a probabilistic model to assign probabilities to the RFID readers and to the product part detections. We also present a probability self-calibration algorithm that automatically adapts the probabilities of RFID readers to better reflect their performance at current instance of time. This would ensure that unreliable RFID devices would have little or no say in the overall production monitoring and tracking within the production environment. The use of RFID technology in manufacturing and production is still limited because of the non-availability of middleware solutions to transform raw RFID data into higher level meaningful information. So as our fourth contribution, we present a complex event processing framework that can be deployed in manufacturing environments. The framework is capable of processing raw RFID events to generate complex manufacturing events that are of relevance to the production operations. The framework assigns probabilities to each complex event, which are continuously updated as more information is made available regarding these events. This provides a measure to the higher level applications about how accurate or inaccurate a certain complex event really is...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} cache {{performance}} of Java {{programs in the}} interpreted and <b>just-in</b> <b>time</b> (JIT) modes by analyzing memory reference traces of the SPECjvm 98 applications with the Latte JVM. Specifically, we study the cache performance of the different components of the JVM (class loader, the execution engine and the garbage collector). Poor data cache performance in JITs is caused by code installation, and the data write miss rate can {{be as high as}} 70 % in the execution engine. In addition, this code installation also causes deterioration in performance of the instruction cache during execution of translated code. We also believe that there is considerable interference between data accesses of the garbage collector and that of the compiler-translator execution engine of the JIT mode. We observe that the miss percentages in the garbage collection phase are of the order of 60 % for the JIT mode; we believe that interference between data accesses of the garbage collector and the JIT execution engine lead to further deterioration of the data cache performance wherever the contribution of the garbage collector is significant. We observe that an increase in cache sizes does not substantially improve performance in the case of data cache writes, which is identified to be the principal performance bottleneck in JITs...|$|R
40|$|Abstract OnlyConsumers {{all over}} the world have a strong {{preference}} for fresh newly harvested fish, which is reflected in a higher market value compared to most other preserved and processed fish products. The perishability of the fresh fish and the distribution distance drive in contrary the fish value chains into preservation like freezing, salting, drying, canning etc. This paper reports findings from a research project where a new Coolnova <b>just-in</b> <b>time</b> (JIT) marketing concept has been unveiled. This concept opens a new window of opportunity for marketing fresh quality previous frozen thawed fish on daily basis just-in -time for consumption with a quality appearance like fresh fish. The fresh appearance is protected in a humid atmosphere consisting of small fog droplet which is speeding up the freezing and thawing process without any risk of dehydration or microbe degradation of the product and without any loss of drip and weight which is normal for fish frozen and thawed in traditional ways. Application of the Coolnova JIT logistic concept has the potential to revolutionize the way we are marketing fresh quality seafood, satisfying the consumer preferences for fresh fish and food welfare. The fishers’ opportunities to add value of fresh caught fish may thus be increased when the fresh quality is protected in a value chain and when the barriers that today exist in the fresh seafood distribution chains are removed by the Coolnova JIT system...|$|R
40|$|Transport {{of goods}} {{accounts}} for a third of Sweden's energy consumption, and consists to 90 % of fossil fuels. When transporting goods {{there is a major}} focus on ensuring quick and inexpensive transports. However, recently additional focus has been placed on the environmental effects of these transports. Since a lot of companies are working on a <b>just-in</b> <b>time</b> basis, there is a trend today toward postponement of the ordering of gods and transportation until the need for the products arises. This creates difficulties in keeping the environmental impact to a minimum without increasing cost or time. This report used a case study to look at a small company in the importing industry to see how and if they can influence themselves and their carriers to perform more environmentally friendly when it comes to transports. Questionnaires and interviews were conducted with freight forwarders to provide a picture of the situation today and find opportunities for improvement. The results show that both shippers and freight forwarders believe that it is the other party that choose the conditions. With regards to costs and environmental impact, results show that it, in this given situation, would be better to move a larger portion of the loads on to train from truck. Ships may be a better option from an environmental perspective and carry such volumes the freight still {{take a lot of time}} that it is rarely a feasible alternative...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The aims were to (1) {{identify}} {{barriers and}} facilitators related to integration of {{clinical decision support}} (CDS) into workflow and (2) develop and test CDS design alternatives. Scope: To better understand CDS integration, we studied its use in practice, focusing on CDS for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening and followup. Phase 1 involved outpatient clinics of four different systems— 120 clinic staff and providers and 118 patients were observed. In Phase 2, prototyped design enhancements to the Veterans Administration’s CRC screening reminder were compared against its current reminder in a simulation experiment. Twelve providers participated. Methods: Phase 1 was a qualitative project, using key informant interviews, direct observation, opportunistic interviews, and focus groups. All {{data were analyzed using}} a coding template, based on the sociotechnical systems theory, which was modified as coding proceeded and themes emerged. Phase 2 consisted of rapid prototyping of CDS design alternatives based on Phase 1 findings and a simulation experiment to test these design changes in a within-subject comparison. Results: Very different CDS types existed across sites, yet there are common barriers: (1) lack of coordination of “outside” results and between primary and specialty care; (2) suboptimal data organization and presentation; (3) needed provider and patient education; (4) needed interface flexibility; (5) needed technological enhancements; (6) unclear role assignments; (7) organizational issues; and (8) disconnect with quality reporting. Design enhancements positively impacted usability and workflow integration but not workload. Conclusions: Effective CDS design and integration requires: (1) organizational and workflow integration; (2) integrating outside results; (3) improving data organization and presentation in a flexible interface; and (4) providing <b>just-in</b> <b>time</b> education, cognitive support, and quality reporting...|$|R

30|$|As {{illustrated}} in Figure  2, the basic logic {{for the establishment}} of Cyber-Physical System is the connecting of real and virtual production. It is developed based on the establishment of virtual system with real time information (shown as in the left side of Figure  2), and goes beyond the scope of IoT. In others words, Cyber-Physical System is the sublimation for the application of IoT. General focus for the usage of Cyber-Physical System lies not only on the gathering of real time data from the physical environment to the digital system, but more on the structure analysis of data sources for (partly) autonomous and self-organized processes. Thus, the back-loops of virtual information system to the operation and controlling of physical processes is considered as the spirit of Cyber-Physical Systems. And with the establishment of Cyber-Physical Systems, Smart Factory is enabled to be possible in companies. Here, Smart Factory “constitutes - key features of Industrie 4.0 ” [7]. And under the Smart Factories, “in addition to condition monitoring and fault diagnosis, components and systems are able to gain self-awareness and self-productiveness, which will provide management with more insight on the status of the factory. Furthermore, peer-to-peer comparison and fusion of health information from various components provides a precise health prediction in component and system levels and force factory management to trigger required maintenance at the best possible <b>time</b> to reach <b>just-in</b> <b>time</b> maintenance and gain near zero downtime” [15]. Taken together, it is of great importance for the realization of Industrie 4.0 in companies. And in order to provide an in-depth insight on the possible solutions on the application of Industrie 4.0, experiences with applied cases will be worked out as in the following stages.|$|R
