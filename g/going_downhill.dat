25|$|Vehicles {{using two}} freewheels. A freewheel, as {{used on a}} pedal bicycle for example, allows a road wheel to rotate faster than the {{mechanism}} that drives it, allowing a cyclist to stop pedalling while <b>going</b> <b>downhill.</b> Some early automobiles had the engine driving two freewheels, one for each driving road wheel. When the vehicle turned, the engine would continue to drive the wheel {{on the inside of}} the curve, but the wheel on the outside was permitted to rotate faster by its freewheel. Thus, while turning, the vehicle had only one driving wheel. Driving in reverse is impossible as is engine braking due to the freewheels.|$|E

A Holden Frontera 4WD vehicle then approached Seascape along the road. Those in the vehicle saw Bryant with his gun, but believed him to be rabbit hunting and actually slowed down as they passed him. Bryant fired into the car; the first bullet hit the bonnet and broke the throttle cable. He fired at least twice more into the car as it passed, breaking the windows. One bullet hit the driver, Linda White, in the arm. The car was <b>going</b> <b>downhill</b> so it was able to roll down the road out of sight around a corner. White swapped seats with her boyfriend, Michael Wanders, who attempted to drive the car, but was unable to, because of the broken throttle cable.|$|E

A nationalistic spirit was aroused; the London Evening News called for the story to be read to schoolchildren throughout the land, {{to coincide with the}} memorial service at St Paul's Cathedral on 14 February. Robert Baden-Powell, founder of the Boy Scouts Association, asked: [...] "Are Britons <b>going</b> <b>downhill?</b> No!... There is plenty of pluck and spirit left in the British after all.

500|$|While {{the first}} unit shot at Piz Gloria, the second unit, led by John Glen, started filming the ski chases. The {{downhill}} skiing involved professional skiers, and various camera tricks. Some cameras were handheld, with the operators holding {{them as they}} were <b>going</b> <b>downhill</b> with the stuntmen, and others were aerial, with cameramen Johnny Jordan – who had previously worked in the helicopter battle of You Only Live Twice — developing a system where he was dangled by an [...] long parachute harness rig below a helicopter, allowing scenes to be shot on the move from any angle. The bobsledding chase was also filmed {{with the help of}} Swiss Olympic athletes, and was rewritten to incorporate the accidents the stuntmen suffered during shooting, such as the scene where Bond falls from the sled. Blofeld getting snared with a tree was performed at the studio by Savalas himself, after the attempt to do this by the stuntman on location came out wrong. Glen was also the editor of the film, employing a style similar to the one used by Hunt in the previous Bond films, with fast motion in the action scenes and exaggerated sound effects.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{cancellation}} of Star Trek, Roddenberry felt typecast as a producer of science fiction, despite his background in Westerns and police stories. He later described the period, saying, [...] "My dreams were <b>going</b> <b>downhill</b> because I could not get work after the original series was cancelled." [...] He {{felt that he was}} [...] "perceived as the guy who made the show that was an expensive flop." [...] Roddenberry had sold his interest in Star Trek to Paramount Studios in return for a third of the ongoing profits. However, this did not result in any quick financial gain; the studio was still claiming that the series was $500,000 in the red in 1982. He wrote and produced Pretty Maids All in a Row (1971), a sexploitation film directed by Roger Vadim, for MGM. The cast included Rock Hudson, Angie Dickinson, Telly Savalas, and Roddy McDowall alongside Star Trek regular James Doohan, and William J. Campbell, who had appeared as a guest in two Star Trek episodes, [...] "The Squire Of Gothos" [...] and [...] "The Trouble With Tribbles". Variety was unimpressed: [...] "Whatever substance was in the original [...] or screen concept has been plowed under, leaving only superficial, one-joke results." [...] Herbert Solow had given Roddenberry the work as a favor, paying him $100,000 for the script.|$|E

500|$|In 2009 Frank {{responded to}} what he called [...] "wholly {{inaccurate}} efforts by Republicans to blame Democrats, and [...] in particular" [...] for the subprime mortgage crisis, which {{is linked to the}} financial crisis of 2007–2009. He outlined his efforts to reform these institutions and add regulations, but met resistance from Republicans, with the main exception being a bill with Republican Mike Oxley that died because of opposition from President Bush. The 2005 bill included Frank objectives, which were to impose tighter regulation of Fannie and Freddie and new funds for rental housing. Frank and Mike Oxley achieved broad bipartisan support for the bill in the Financial Services Committee, and it passed the House. But the Senate never voted on the measure, in part because President Bush was likely to veto it. [...] "If it had passed, that would {{have been one of the}} ways we could have reined in the bowling ball <b>going</b> <b>downhill</b> called housing," [...] Oxley told Frank. In an op-ed piece in the Wall Street Journal, Lawrence B. Lindsey, a former economic adviser to President George W. Bush, wrote that Frank [...] "is the only politician I know who has argued that we needed tighter rules that intentionally produce fewer homeowners and more renters." [...] Once control shifted to the Democrats, Frank was able to help guide both the Federal Housing Reform Act (...) and the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act (...) to passage in 2007. Frank also said that the Republican-led Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act of 1999, which repealed part of the Glass–Steagall Act of 1933 and removed the wall between commercial and investment banks, contributed to the financial meltdown. Frank stated further that [...] "during twelve years of Republican rule no reform was adopted regarding Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In 2007, a few months after I became the Chairman, the House passed a strong reform bill; we sought to get the [...] administration's approval to include it in the economic stimulus legislation in January 2008; and finally got it passed and onto President Bush's desk in July 2008. Moreover, [...] "we were able to adopt it in nineteen months, and we could have done it much quicker if the [...] administration had cooperated." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A {{new method}} {{to analyze the}} seismic {{stability}} of the cut soil slope is suggested in this study. In the method, the limiting equilibrium theory and the stress analyzing method are used. The stress acceptability criterion {{is based on the}} limited strength of soil. Two basic assumptions are given in the method. One is that the slip surface can be replaced by a series of straight lines. The other is that the interslice boundary is an inclined plane. Three balance equations for any slice, which are two for force equilibrium and one for moment equilibrium, are proposed. An iterative method, which solves the balance equations from the first slice to the last slice, is also suggested. In the new method, the slip surface is not predefined, but is obtained slice by slice <b>going</b> from <b>downhill</b> to uphill in terms of the force and moment balance equations of the slice...|$|R

It was as still as it was dark, and though there was a cold wind blowing up the hill-face, the rustle of grass, the soughing of the boughs that should have accompanied it, were absent. He could hear, therefore, if he could not see, that the hillside upon which he stood was rocky and desolate. The green grew brighter every moment, and as it did so a faint, transparent blood-red mingled with, but did not mitigate, the blackness of the sky overhead and the rocky desolations about him. Having regard to what follows, I am inclined to think that that redness may have been an optical effect due to contrast. Something black fluttered momentarily against the livid yellow-green of the lower sky, and then the thin and penetrating voice of a bell rose out of the black gulf below him. An oppressive expectation grew with the growing light.|$|R

40|$|The {{evolutionary}} annealing-simplex {{algorithm is}} a probabilistic heuristic global optimisation technique that joins ideas from different methodological approaches, enhancing them with some original elements. The main concept {{is based on}} a controlled random search scheme, where a generalised downhill simplex methodology is coupled with a simulated annealing procedure. The algorithm combines the robustness of simulated annealing in rugged problems, with the efficiency of hill-climbing methods in simple search spaces. The following-up procedure {{is based on a}} simplex-searching scheme. The simplex is reformulated at each generation <b>going</b> either <b>downhill</b> or uphill, according to a probabilistic criterion. In the first case, it moves towards the direction of a candidate local minimum via a generalised Nelder-Mead strategy. In the second case, it expands itself along the uphill direction, in order to escape from the current local minimum. In all possible movements, a combination of deterministic as well as stochastic transition rules is applied. The evolutionary annealing-simplex algorithm was first examined in a variety of typical benchmark functions and then it was applied in two global optimisation problems taken from water resources engineering, the calibration of a hydrological model and the optimisation of a multiple reservoir systems' operation. The algorithm has been proved very reliable in locating the global optimum, requiring reasonable computational effort...|$|R

A combination of radial basis functions and low order polynomials is used to create the interpolation space between example motions. Inverse kinematic constraints are used to augment the interpolations in order to avoid, for example, the feet slipping on the floor during a support phase of a walk cycle.
