5|$|Given this, it <b>is</b> <b>unfortunate</b> <b>that</b> the Cypria—the {{part of the}} Epic Cycle {{that covers}} {{the period of the}} Trojan War of Troilus' death—does not survive. Indeed, no {{complete}} narrative of his story remains from archaic times or the subsequent classical period (479–323 BC). Most of the literary sources from before the Hellenistic age (323–30 BC) that even referred to the character are lost or survive only in fragments or summary. The surviving ancient and medieval sources, whether literary or scholarly, contradict each other, and many do not tally with the form of the myth that scholars now believe to have existed in the archaic and classical periods.|$|E
25|$|The IRA gave clear {{reasons for}} the execution. I think it <b>is</b> <b>unfortunate</b> <b>that</b> anyone has to be killed, but the furor created by Mountbatten's death showed up the hypocritical {{attitude}} of the media establishment. As {{a member of the}} House of Lords, Mountbatten was an emotional figure in both British and Irish politics. What the IRA did to him is what Mountbatten had been doing all his life to other people; and with his war record I don't think he could have objected to dying in what was clearly a war situation. He knew the danger involved in coming to this country. In my opinion, the IRA achieved its objective: people started paying attention to what was happening in Ireland.|$|E
25|$|Goryeo (Koryo) {{architecture}} {{is defined as}} the period between the 10th century and the 14th century. Much of the architecture in this period was related to religion and influenced by political power/ kingdom. Many buildings such as magnificent Buddhist temples and pagodas were developed based on religious needs, as Buddhism {{played an important role in}} the culture and society at the time. It <b>is</b> <b>unfortunate</b> <b>that</b> little has survived to the present day, since most of the architecture from this period was built of wood. Also, the capital of the Goryeo dynasty was based in Gaesong, a city in modern-day North Korea. Its location has made it difficult for many historians in South Korea to study and analyze the architecture of this era.|$|E

25|$|Bhishma {{is often}} {{considered}} as {{a great example of}} devotion and sacrifice. His name itself is an honour to him - Bhishma which means severe because he took a severe vow to remain celibate for life and Pitamah which means Grandfather. Bhishma {{was one of the greatest}} Bramhacharis of all time. Accumulation of Ojas due to his Bramhacharyam made him the strongest warrior of the era. He had stature and personality that in those times were fit for kings. He was a true Kshatriya as well as a disciplined ascetic - a rare combination. Like a true Kshatriya, he never unnecessarily exhibited passion and anger. A symbol of truth and duty, the benevolent Bhishma was in all senses a true human. It <b>is</b> <b>unfortunate</b> <b>that</b> a person as noble as Bhishma saw a life full of loneliness, frustration and sadness. But that was how Vashishta's curse was supposed to unfold. Bhishma's human birth was destined to be marked with suffering, and that was how his life transpired right till the last moment; even his death was very painful. But the strong as steel character which he possessed ensured that he never shied away from his duty, and never stopped loving those dear to him.|$|E
500|$|The committee, which met in private, heard {{numerous}} theories as to {{the causes}} of the fire, including the lax attitude of plumbers working in the Lords, carelessness of the servants at Howard's Coffee House—situated inside the palace—and a gas explosion. Other rumours began to circulate; the Prime Minister received an anonymous letter claiming that the fire was an arson attack. The committee issued its report on 8 November, which identified the burning of the tallies as the cause of the fire. The committee thought it unlikely that Cross and Furlong had been as careful in filling the furnaces as they had claimed, and the report stated that [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>unfortunate</b> <b>that</b> Mr Weobley did not more effectively superintend the burning of the tallies".|$|E

FinMkt claimed that Albright regretted having sold NowStreet for only $5,000, and {{that as a result}} of the deal FinMkt owned a third of Lendit. Albright filed a countersuit denying FinMkt's ownership of NowStreet and claiming she had been “fraudulently induced” to sell. “It <b>is</b> <b>unfortunate</b> <b>that</b> we were forced to file this action,” said Cox. “We intend to let the facts speak for themselves, and we have the utmost confidence the courts will rule in our favor." ...|$|E

500|$|Erotica {{remains the}} most rampantly {{misrepresented}} Madonna album with the biggest backlash of her career. Taraborrelli commented that it <b>is</b> <b>unfortunate</b> <b>that</b> Erotica has to be historically linked to other less memorable ventures in Madonna's career at this time. However, he quipped that the album should be considered on its own merits, not only as one linked {{to the other two}} adult-oriented projects, because it has true value. When asked to name her biggest professional disappointment, Madonna answered, [...] "The fact that my Erotica album was overlooked because of the whole thing with the Sex book. It just got lost in all that. I think there's some brilliant songs on it and people didn't give it a chance." [...] Brian McNair observed that Madonna took a financial risk with the album and it was not until Ray of Light (1998) that her record sales recovered to pre-Erotica levels. He further asserted that [...] "what she lost in royalty payments, however, Madonna more than made up for in iconic status and cultural influence." ...|$|E

Jocelyn Vena of MTV News said, [...] "There {{comes a time}} in every pop princess' career when she must throw a sexy dance party and {{proclaim}} her womanhood. Back in 2001 Britney Spears did as much in 'I'm a Slave 4 U,' and this week, Miley Cyrus {{is doing the same}} in the video for her club-ready track 'Who Owns My Heart.'" [...] Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly assumed the theme of the video were the divergent hairstyles, but acclaimed the video for its fun. [...] Stransky said the sultry aspect of the video added to its frothy, [...] "thumpa-thumpa deliciousness". Edith Zimmerman of New York magazine viewed it as [...] "awkward". Megan Vick of Billboard thought the video followed the same steps as the video for [...] "Can't Be Tamed" [...] — dark lighting, lots of bare Cyrus parts and writhing around on flat surfaces. Vick recalled Amy Winehouse's [...] "Rehab" [...] video when seeing the bathroom scene and viewed the ending as a relief. Tim Winter, president of the Parents Television Council, criticized the video for its suggestiveness and sexual elements. Winter continued, [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>unfortunate</b> <b>that</b> she would participate in such a sexualized video like this one. It sends messages to her fanbase that are diametrically opposed to everything she has done up to this point. Miley built her fame and fortune entirely on the backs of young girls, and it saddens us that she seems so eager to distance herself from that fanbase so rapidly." ...|$|E
