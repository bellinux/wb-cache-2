500|$|Pamela and Bobby's {{relationship}} {{changed significantly}} {{as the show}} went on and began to progress. In order to create conflict, the producers brought in actors Priscilla Presley (Jenna Wade) and John Beck (Mark Graison) to cause drama for the couple. Eventually, the two characters divorced one another and went their separate ways. After becoming involved with Ewing oil, Bobby tended to put Pam on the backburner with the company coming first. In an interview with People, Principal said: [...] "I wouldn't {{put up with the}} way Pam is treated by Bobby." [...] She also added, [...] "Our marriage just doesn't work anymore and I want a divorce." [...] With the impending couple doomed, Pamela began a newfound relationship with Mark Graison (played by John Beck). The producers of Dallas were faced with the obstacle of getting the audience to root for a new love interest in Pam's life. When asked about the reception of his characters relationship with Pamela, Beck commented: [...] "It was always set up that way from the beginning, so it was quite a task and of course they came back together in the long run. I was just <b>hoping</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>best.</b> I never got an extraordinary reaction from the public but it was everywhere, so constant recognition. It was pretty amazing but I never saw it the way he sees it but I can see his point of view. I never really looked at it like that." ...|$|E
2500|$|After a problem-filled {{practice}} drill on September 13, 1944, {{three days}} before the opening game, head coach Fritz Crisler noted that he did not harbor any illusions about his 1944 squad and added: [...] "I'm <b>hoping</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>best,</b> fearing the worst and expecting almost anything." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Keep <b>hoping</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>best,</b> {{that will}} help you, Jo. Soon your mother will be here, and then {{everything}} will be all right." ...|$|E
60|$|I'm {{bound to}} say the problem {{absolutely}} baffled me. The only thing seemed to be to leave the parcel in <b>the</b> drawer and <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>best.</b>|$|R
60|$|MRS. P.--Ah, madam, don't say so! Let us <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>best.</b> Master George's high temper will subside when certain {{persons who}} pet him are gone away.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let us <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>best,</b> Mrs. Rogers," [...] said Beth. [...] "Somehow, I {{have an idea}} {{this trouble}} will all turn out well in the end." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Or {{that part}} of her brain will be more or less {{permanently}} affected. However, I am <b>hoping</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>best.</b> Thank heavens you're on the spot!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he said. [...] "Heaven only. And now, Vrouw Botmar, go {{and rest}} awhile, <b>hoping</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>best,</b> for {{you will hear}} him if he wakes up, but he will not wake, since the sleep-draught that I gave him holds him fast." ...|$|E
60|$|A sharp spasm {{shook him}} from base to apex. The beetle, which, {{during the recent}} exchanges, had been {{clinging}} to his head, <b>hoping</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>best,</b> gave it up at this and resigned office. It shot off and was swallowed in the night.|$|E
6000|$|... "He is by {{no means}} out of danger," [...] {{announced}} the physician. [...] "But let us <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>best.</b> I think his parents ought to be notified." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Who can tell? One strives and <b>hopes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>best.</b> It is {{all that}} is possible. Some day, perhaps, comes a small {{instalment}} of what one fights for." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will try}} to think as you do, Mr. Pendril--I {{will try to}} <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>best.</b> Shall we be left long in {{suspense}} before the decision reaches us?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I know I can, for we {{love one}} another, {{and that makes}} all the rest easy to bear. I have my duty, also, and my work. I couldn't enjoy myself if I {{neglected}} them even for you, so there's no need of hurry or impatience. You can do your part out West, I can do mine here, and both be happy <b>hoping</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>best,</b> and leaving the future to be as God wills." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm afraid your jolly old father doesn't {{appreciate}} me. But I'm <b>hoping</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>best.</b> If I can rope in that rummy-looking little china {{thing that}} Jo-Jo the dog-faced boy is showing the customers, {{he will be}} all over me. I mean to say, you know, he's got another like it, and, {{if he can get}} a full house, as it were, I'm given to understand he'll be bucked, cheered, and even braced." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{had no such}} intention, so far as his {{profession}} meant getting up at three o’clock {{in the morning to}} assuage the ills of humanity; but here, as before, the touch of such a question instantly stiffened him. “Oh, my profession! I rather wince at that grand old name. I’ve neglected my work so scandalously that I scarce know on what terms with it I shall be—though <b>hoping</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> when once I’m right there again.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{most that}} we can do is to <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> till we know the worst. Of course we shall make <b>the</b> <b>best</b> of <b>the</b> worst when it comes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let us <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>best.</b> It is {{too late}} at any rate to think about that, and {{as it is to}} be done, I have come to tell you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm afraid there is, {{but we must}} <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>best,</b> so don't cry, dear." [...] And Laurie put his arm {{about her}} with a brotherly gesture which was very comforting.|$|R
6000|$|... "O Lionel, dear Lionel," [...] and she {{sprang to}} him, {{to lead him}} back to his seat, but he still {{retained}} his hold of the lock and would not move; [...] "you know"--her tears were flowing--"you know how I grieve for you; but if you are in trouble, that ought not to make you do wrong," [...] He was turning the lock, and hardened his face, but Marian went on, [...] "Don't go, Lionel, only hear me. Mrs. Lyddell is very unhappy about you, and I am sure you must see yourself, that if she blames herself for any want of care, her only comfort must be in <b>hoping</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>best,</b> making the most of this little ray." ...|$|E
60|$|Since {{you left}} Atlanta, no very great {{progress}} has been made here. The enemy has been closely watched though, and prevented from detaching against you. I think not one man has gone from here, except some twelve or fifteen hundred dismounted cavalry. Bragg has gone from Wilmington. I am trying to take advantage of his absence to get possession of that place. Owing to some preparations Admiral Porter and General Butler are making to blow up Fort Fisher (which, while <b>hoping</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>best,</b> I do not believe a particle in), there is a delay in getting this expedition off. I hope they will be ready to start by the 7th, and that Bragg will not have started back by that time.|$|E
60|$|One {{gleam of}} hope alone {{presented}} itself. Like baseball, this pastime of cricket was apparently affected by rain, {{if there had}} been enough of it. He had an idea {{that there had been a}} good deal of rain in the night, but had there been sufficient to cause the teams of Surrey and Kent to postpone the second instalment of their serial struggle? He rose from the table and went out into the hall. It was his purpose to sally out into Grosvenor Square and examine the turf in its centre with the heel of his shoe, in order to determine the stickiness or non-stickiness of the wicket. He moved towards the front door, <b>hoping</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>best,</b> and just as he reached it the bell rang.|$|E
6000|$|... "None at all, I {{am sorry}} to say, Mills! Still, we must <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>best.</b> I dare say {{that some of these}} camps are not so bad as we imagine." ...|$|R
60|$|MR MARCH. It's {{rather a}} weight on my wife's, I'm afraid. But we must <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>best.</b> <b>The</b> country wants rain, but--I doubt if we shall get {{it with this}} Government.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, well, I don't {{know for}} certain, you know," [...] she smiled, [...] "but I <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>best.</b> And anyhow there'll be no rent {{to pay and}} no novelettes to write." ...|$|R
60|$|As he journeyed northward Dane {{had much}} to ponder over. He regretted {{that he had been}} unable to secure a closer view of Rideau or his dusky follower. He fancied he once heard the Frenchman's voice raised angrily in an altercation with Dom Pedro; but he could learn nothing about the tall negro, who had {{vanished}} mysteriously. When the journey was almost accomplished, and he was recovering strength again, there was added another subject for consideration. Searching for the map Maxwell had given him, he failed to find it; but, after the first shock of dismay had passed, he was almost thankful that time and distance prevented his returning to the factory in search of it. Dane, remembering the surgeon's narrative, felt himself unequal to the task of asking Miss Castro what she had done with it. He pushed on, <b>hoping</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>best,</b> and that Maxwell might not ask too many questions.|$|E
6000|$|... "Buck up, old horse," [...] said Ukridge encouragingly. He had {{a painful}} habit of {{addressing}} all and sundry by that title. In his school-master days--at one period of his vivid career he and I had been {{colleagues on the}} staff of a private school--he had made use of it interviewing the parents of new pupils, and the latter had gone away, as a rule, with a feeling that this must be either the easy manner of Genius or due to alcohol, and <b>hoping</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>best.</b> He also used it to perfect strangers in the streets, and on one occasion had been heard to address a bishop by that title, rendering that dignitary, as Mr. Baboo Jaberjee would put it, sotto voce with gratification. [...] "Surprised to find me married, what? Garny, old boy,"--sinking his voice to a whisper almost inaudible {{on the other side of}} the street--"take my tip. Go and jump off the dock yourself. You'll feel another man. Give up this bachelor business. It's a mug's game. I look on you bachelors as excrescences on the social system. I regard you, old man, purely and simply as a wart. Go and get married, laddie, go and get married. By gad, I've forgotten to pay the cabby. Lend me a couple of bob, Garny old chap." ...|$|E
60|$|By Sakr-el-Bahr's orders {{these were}} dragged {{forth from the}} {{blackness}} into {{which they had been}} flung. The Muslimeen upon discovering that they had fallen into the hands of their own people and that their slavery was at an end, broke into cries of delight, and fervent praise of Allah than whom they swore there was no other God. The three Jews, lithe, stalwart young men in black tunics that fell to their knees and black skull-caps upon their curly black locks, smiled ingratiatingly, <b>hoping</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> since they were fallen into the hands of people who were nearer akin to them than Christians and allied to them, at least, by the bond of common enmity to Spain and common suffering at the hands of Spaniards. The two heretics stood in stolid apathy, realizing that with them it was but a case of passing from Charybdis to Scylla, and that they had as little to hope for from heathen as from Christian. One of these was a sturdy bowlegged fellow, whose garments were little better than rags; his weather-beaten face was of the colour of mahogany and his eyes of a dark blue under tufted eyebrows that once had been red--like his hair and beard--but were now thickly intermingled with grey. He was spotted like a leopard on the hands by enormous dark brown freckles.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am ready}} to depart this instant. The letter you sent by the physician, had {{prepared}} me to <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>best,</b> and I have every thing arranged <b>for</b> flight, at <b>the</b> shortest warning." ...|$|R
6000|$|Sir John whistled. [...] "Oh, indeed. Certainly, that's awkward. Well, we must <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>best,</b> and, {{look you}} here, when a fellow {{calls out to}} you another time just you stop to listen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No. Should think not. He didn't see us properly. Anyhow, he was {{interfering with}} {{an officer in}} the {{performance}} of his duty. So were we, I suppose. Well, let's <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>best.</b> Hullo!' ...|$|R
50|$|It {{also offers}} a {{panorama}} of the Police career, from the beginning until the moment they retire and cease to exercise the function from so many years. Each of them {{is part of a}} family, always <b>hoping</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> to happen.|$|E

5000|$|Rick L. Blalock from Terror Hook.com {{awarded the}} film {{a score of}} 2 / 10 stating, [...] "Well, I can't say I am {{surprised}} by how much I didn't like this film - I kind of expected it but was <b>hoping</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>best.</b> This film to be honest is one slasher film I found myself bored with rather quickly".|$|E
6000|$|... "Some one ill, I fancy? I'm {{sorry to}} hear it, but you must <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>best,</b> you know," [...] replied Mr. Fletcher, really quite exerting himself to {{remember}} and present this well-worn consolation.|$|R
6000|$|... 'His opinions, my child; {{but we must}} <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>best.</b> He seems {{moral and}} well inclined, and really desirous of doing good in his way; and so {{successful}} in the House, too, I hear.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “We must <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>best,</b> Don Filippo,” Stephen replied. “I do not blind {{myself to}} the fact that my {{position}} is not free from danger, but I confide in the honour of your countrymen.” ...|$|R
