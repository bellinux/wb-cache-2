Based on the report, the <b>Health</b> <b>Care</b> <b>Financing</b> <b>Administration</b> fined the HHC $3,050 per day for every day the former residents remained in sub-par housing, totaling $450,000. In December 1998, a portion of the complex, the Neponsit Adult Day Health Care which provided outpatient physical therapy, was relocated to the gymnasium of the Young Israel of Far Rockaway synagogue in Far Rockaway. A second court ruling on October 29, 1999, stated that the HHC overextended its authority when evacuating the facility, and blocked demolition. Despite this, the Giuliani administration continued to try and demolitish the building. In March 2000, a structural evaluation was conducted by the New York City Council, finding the three Neponsit buildings to be in good condition, with repairs estimated at $600,000.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Tobacco smoke {{exposure}} may {{be associated}} with increased breast cancer risk, although the evidence supporting the association is inconclusive. We conducted a case-control study in Delaware, incorporating detailed exposure assessment for active and secondhand smoke at home and in the workplace. Methods Primary invasive breast cancer cases diagnosed among female Delaware residents, ages 40 – 79, in 2000 – 2002 were identified through the Delaware cancer registry (n = 287). Delaware drivers license and <b>Health</b> <b>Care</b> <b>Finance</b> <b>Administration</b> records were used to select age frequency-matched controls for women Results A statistically significant increased risk of breast cancer was observed for ever having smoked cigarettes (odds ratio = 1. 43, 95 % confidence interval = 1. 03 – 1. 99). However, {{there was no evidence of}} a dose-response relationship between breast cancer risk and total years smoked, cigarettes per day, or pack-years. Neither residential nor workplace secondhand smoke exposure was associated with breast cancer. Recalculations of active smoking risks using a purely unexposed reference group of women who were not exposed to active or secondhand smoking did not indicate increased risks of breast cancer.

40|$|As part of {{an ongoing}} multi-year project {{investigating}} hospital-based clinical pharmacy services, the variation in clinical pharmacy services among hospitals with various teaching affiliations was studied. Survey documents, completed by the director of pharmacy, were completed for 1597 hospitals, representing 43 percent of the nation’s acute care general medical surgical hospitals. Hospitals were grouped according to their affiliation with colleges of pharmacy degree programs and other <b>health</b> <b>care</b> teaching programs. Clear differences were observed in the types of clinical pharmacy services among: PharmD affiliated hospitals, hospitals affiliated with BS pharmacy programs only, hospitals affiliated with nonpharmacy teaching programs, and hospitals without any involvement in <b>health</b> <b>care</b> education. Both BS and PharmD program affiliated hospitals were most likely to be nonprofit nongovernment hospitals. Only 10 percent of college of pharmacy affiliated hospitals were for-profit institutions. PharmD programs had a greater mix of small, medium and large-sized affiliated hospitals; whereas BS pharmacy programs were commonly affiliated with small and medium-sized hospitals.

40|$|An {{experienced}} SAS coder can tackle {{almost any}} situation. However, there are occasions when a dance, not a tackle, is in order. The CALL MODULE routine {{is a great}} dance partner. A prominent healthcare data analysis firm needed to assign Diagnostic Related Group codes (DRGs) to the claims in their data warehouse. Information and instructions on assigning DRG codes is publicly available, and the firm has SAS coders that could implement the metrics. But the most beneficial solution did not involve writing SAS code to assign the DRGs. Instead, a low-cost module (a C-callable shared object) was purchased from a third party provider in the DRG data processing marketplace. The CALL MODULE routine allowed SAS to use the methods in the object like a data step function. This paper will explain how to call an external module from SAS on the Linux platform, and will share the lessons learned in implementing the selected DRG grouper. DRG DRGs (Diagnosis-Related Groups) were developed originally at Yale University in the 1960 s for monitoring quality of care and utilization of services in an inpatient setting.

Controls were age- and county-frequency matched, selected from New York State driver's license records (for those less than age 65 years) and from <b>Health</b> <b>Care</b> <b>Finance</b> <b>Administration</b> Records (for those age 65 or more). Included were women {{with at least one}} livebirth (253 premenopausal and 367 postmenopausal cases and 266 premenopausal and 427 postmenopausal controls). Breast cancer risk was very weakly associated with long duration of lactation among premenopausal women; the odds ratio for at least 20 months lifetime lactation was 0. 50 < 95 % confidence interval 0. 21 - 1. 12). Among postmenopausal women, the protective effect of lactation was restricted to women with first lactation before age 25 years (odds ratio = 0. 67, 95 % confidence interval 0. 46 - 0. 95). However, age at first birth was highly correlated with age at first lactation. Neither insufficient milk as a reason for not breastfeeding nor having received medication to stop milk flow was associated with increased risk.

40|$|The doctor-patient relationship, so {{important}} in all of medical practice, has been destroyed in much of American public psychiatry. That destruction should serve as an important negative lesson for a medical care system facing reorganization. The desirability of having the same psychiatrist caring for a patient both in the mental hospital and after discharge—continuity of care—should have been obvious, but its significance was not defined explicitly, to this author's knowledge, until about 1979. White's demonstration that the therapeutic relationship's positive impact seems to “account for {{about half of the}} benefits” associated with medical and similar ministrations underlines its importance. Continuity of competent public psychiatric care, and its therapeutic effectiveness, have been impeded by the harmful attitudes and actions of American psychiatry and the care-fragmenting acts of public officials. Soon after the continuity concept was informally presented in 1979, official American psychiatry, increasingly influenced by drug companies, began denying the importance of a physician's continuing care by redefining “continuity” as though public mental <b>health</b> <b>care</b> had to be fragmented. Specific policy decisions by officials are also largely responsible for the destruction of good public psychiatric care. This in turn has produced gross overuse of medications and the near disappearance of competent public psychiatric leadership and effective therapeutic relationships. An example from the federal <b>Health</b> <b>Care</b> <b>Finance</b> <b>Administration</b> shows how comparably harmful bureaucratic decisions concerning <b>health</b> <b>care</b> can also be made on the federal level.

40|$|Aim To analyze use and {{distribution}} of resources by otolaryngology (ENT) hospital wards in Romania between 2003 and 2008, in order to plan the improvement of patient access to <b>health</b> <b>care</b> services and <b>health</b> <b>care</b> services’ financial performance. Methods Clinical electronic records were searched for all patients discharged from all public hospitals funded on a per-case basis by the government between January 2003 and September 2008. Adult and pediatric ENT wards, as well as ENT wards from different counties, were compared. Results The number of ENT hospital beds {{and the number of}} specialists decreased from 2003 to 2004, the number of specialists declined, and specialists were distributed unevenly among the hospitals and counties. The total number of ENT wards was over 100 for almost the entire study period, but there were only about 15 pediatric ENT wards in all 42 counties. ENT wards recorded more cases and hospitalization days than oral-maxillofacial surgery and neurosurgery wards, but fewer cases than general surgery or obstetrics wards. ENT wards had the lowest mortality rates. Until the second half of 2007, adult ENT wards had a lower surgical index, higher complexity of cases, and longer average length of stay than pediatric ENT wards (P < 0. 001, t-test). After 2007, pediatric ENT wards treated more complex cases (P = 0. 004, t -test) that were less surgical in nature; this result was due to the shift from the <b>Health</b> <b>Care</b> <b>Finance</b> <b>Administration</b> classification diagnostic-related group (DRG) system to the Australian Refined DGR system, as well as to improper use of codes. ENT wards in different counties differed in the number of cases, average length of stay, and case mix index.

40|$|There {{are many}} reasons {{for us to be}} {{concerned}} about the changes in the health-care system and how they are affecting us. At the federal level, we have the impending reforms of the Medicare and Medicaid pro-grams, the proposed cuts in funding for research and graduate medical education, and the continuing regula-tory constraints from the Federal Trade Commission, the Food and Drug <b>Administration,</b> and the <b>Health</b> <b>Care</b> <b>Finance</b> <b>Administration.</b> State and local concerns center on the continuing growth and evolution of managed care and the local consequences of Medicare and Med-icaid reforms. These changes are having a significant impact on our ability to deliver quality care because of the overriding focus on the bottom line, the loss of phy-sician control of clinical decision-making, the limitations in the access of patients to our care, and indeed the viability of our practices and our specialty. These concerns are becoming so overwhelming that there seems to be a growing sense of despair that there is little, if anything, that we as individuals or as an Acad-emy can do about them. The changes are being cost-driven by forces of immense power- the federal and state governments and big business. Individual ortho-paedists are vulnerable if they directly attempt to ad-dress problems associated with managed care. We have concerns that too many orthopaedists are being pro-duced, but antitrust laws and the Federal Trade Com-mission limit our ability to act as groups of individuals or as an organization. Finally, federal and state legisla-tors have little or no interest in what we think because they see us as being self-serving and as merely trying to preserve our incomes.

40|$|While {{addressing}} the Medicare financing problem, Congress wrestled with rising <b>health</b> <b>care</b> {{costs in the}} private sector and the need to balance the budget. Between 1994 and 1998 Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs) emerged as a controversial policy option. This thesis examines the evolution of MSAs from their inception to legislation introducing them to the private sector and then to Medicare. Data was obtained from congressional reports, periodicals and telephone conversations with a <b>Health</b> <b>Care</b> and <b>Finance</b> <b>Administration</b> (HOFA) analyst. The thesis explains how MSAs became available as an option to Medicare beneficiaries via the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. It details the legislative history of MSAs, identifies the key players involved and explains their incentives. The primary findings were that MSAs are supported by congressional Republicans as a way to reduce Medicare costs by allowing beneficiaries to manage their own <b>health</b> <b>care,</b> <b>financed</b> by a fixed annual contribution from Medicare. The President and many congressional Democrats opposed them because of lost tax revenues and possible damage to the existing <b>health</b> <b>care</b> system. The critical first step to Medicare MSAs was congressional approval of tax free NSAs for small employers via a four year demonstration project in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. Medicare MSAs were delayed because insurers failed to file applications to provide them in time. In 1998, MSA supporters failed in their attempt to extend the small empoyer MSA demonstration and to expand MSAs to the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. NAU. S. Navy (U. S.

Second, total family charges for <b>health</b> <b>care</b> reflect the quantity of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> received by families, and it is important to know whether the determinants of total charges are principally the need for <b>health</b> <b>care,</b> or involve other factors less related to need. In this report, the determinants of total charges and their importance are identified principally through multiple regression analysis. Total charges are defined as the full amount charged for all types of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> for all family members regardless of whether these amounts are paid out of pocket, paid by insurance (or public <b>health</b> <b>care</b> coverage programs), or go unpaid. The data used are from the family data files of the 1980 National Medical Care Utilization and Expenditure Survey (NMCUES). This report presents data on the approximately 5, 000 multiple-person families inter-viewed in this year-long longitudinal survey. The report provides a separate analysis for each of three socioeconomic family populations that have consistently been of interest to policymakers. These are (1) older families (defined for this report as all U. S. multiple person families with a member 65 years of age or over); (2) younger, lower income families (all U.
