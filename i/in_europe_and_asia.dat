5|$|One {{explanation}} for these genetic findings is that common ravens settled in California {{at least two}} million years ago and became separated from their relatives <b>in</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>Asia</b> during an ice age. One million years ago, a group from the California clade evolved into a new species, the Chihuahuan raven. Other members of the Holarctic clade arrived later in a separate migration from Asia, perhaps {{at the same time}} as humans.|$|E
5|$|Several {{airlines}} have also {{pulled out of}} Zimbabwe. Australia's Qantas, Germany's Lufthansa, and Austrian Airlines {{were among the first}} to pull out and most recently British Airways suspended all direct flights to Harare. The country's flagship airline Air Zimbabwe, which operated flights throughout Africa and a few destinations <b>in</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>Asia,</b> ceased operations in February 2012.|$|E

5|$|Strobilurus tenacellus is a {{saprobic}} wood-rotting fungus. It fruits singly or {{in small}} groups on fallen and often partially buried cones of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), European black pine (Pinus nigra) and sometimes spruce (Picea) in coniferous and mixed forests. It is found <b>in</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>Asia,</b> {{where it has been}} recorded in Japan and Jordan. In Europe, the fungus usually fruits from March to June. Its occurrence is occasional.|$|E
5|$|The {{black bean}} aphid may have {{originated}} <b>in</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>Asia</b> {{but it is}} now one of the most widely distributed species of aphids. It is found throughout temperate areas of Western Europe, Asia and North America and in the cooler parts of Africa, the Middle East and South America. In the warmer parts of its range, apterous individuals can survive the winter and they may continue to reproduce asexually all year round.|$|E
5|$|Many fossil sites {{worldwide}} contain beetles {{from the}} Cretaceous. Most are <b>in</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>Asia</b> and {{belong to the}} temperate climate zone during the Cretaceous. Lower Cretaceous sites include the Crato fossil beds in the Araripe basin in the Ceará, North Brazil, as well as overlying Santana formation; the latter was near the equator at that time. In Spain, important sites are near Montsec and Las Hoyas. In Australia, the Koonwarra fossil beds of the Korumburra group, South Gippsland, Victoria, are noteworthy. Major sites from the Upper Cretaceous include Kzyl-Dzhar in South Kazakhstan and Arkagala in Russia.|$|E

5|$|The {{findings}} indicate that based on mitochondrial DNA, common ravens {{from the rest of}} the United States are more closely related to those <b>in</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>Asia</b> than to those in the California clade, and that common ravens in the California clade are more closely related to the Chihuahuan raven (C. cryptoleucus) than to those in the Holarctic clade. Ravens in the Holarctic clade are more closely related to the pied crow (C. albus) than they are to the California clade. Thus, the common raven species as traditionally delimited is considered to be paraphyletic.|$|E
5|$|The ruff breeds <b>in</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>Asia</b> from Scandinavia and Great Britain {{almost to}} the Pacific. In Europe it is found in cool {{temperate}} areas, but over its Russian range it is an Arctic species, occurring mainly north of about 65°N. The largest numbers breed in Russia (more than 1 million pairs), Sweden (61,000 pairs), Finland (39,000 pairs) and Norway (14,000 pairs). Although it also breeds from Britain east through the Low Countries to Poland, Germany and Denmark, there are fewer than 2,000 pairs in these more southerly areas.|$|E
5|$|To contain Germany, the United Kingdom, France and Italy {{formed the}} Stresa Front in April 1935; however, that June, the United Kingdom made an {{independent}} naval agreement with Germany, easing prior restrictions. The Soviet Union, concerned by Germany's goals of capturing vast areas of Eastern Europe, drafted a treaty of mutual assistance with France. Before taking effect though, the Franco-Soviet pact {{was required to}} go through the bureaucracy of the League of Nations, which rendered it essentially toothless. The United States, concerned with events <b>in</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>Asia,</b> passed the Neutrality Act in August of the same year.|$|E

5|$|With the {{situation}} <b>in</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>Asia</b> relatively stable, Germany, Japan, and the Soviet Union made preparations. With the Soviets wary of mounting tensions with Germany and the Japanese {{planning to take}} advantage of the European War by seizing resource-rich European possessions in Southeast Asia, the two powers signed the Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact in April 1941. By contrast, the Germans were steadily making preparations for an attack on the Soviet Union, massing forces on the Soviet border.|$|E
5|$|The BSA {{charters}} two councils for American Scouts living overseas, {{largely on}} military bases <b>in</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>Asia.</b> The Transatlantic Council, headquartered in Livorno, Italy, serves BSA units {{in much of}} Europe, and the Far East Council, headquartered in Japan, serves units in the western Pacific areas. The Direct Service branch makes the Scouting movement available to US citizens and their dependents living in countries outside these jurisdictions or in isolated areas. The Aloha Council in Hawaii also serves BSA units in the American territories of American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands and in the sovereign countries of the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} partly migratory, northernmost populations deserting their {{breeding}} areas in winter. Birds winter <b>in</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>Asia</b> {{south of the}} breeding range. Birds in northern Fennoscandia and Russia vacate their territories between late August and early November, with most leaving in late September to mid-October as the first cold weather arrives. Adverse conditions may lead to disorientation, large numbers gathering on ships on overcast or wet nights. Large influxes include 15,000 birds on the Isle of May in October 1982, and nearly 21,000 birds through a single site in Latvia during September and October 1983. Spring migration is complete by late March on the Mediterranean islands, but continues to late April or early May in northern Europe. The spring passage is much lighter than in autumn, suggesting high mortality on migration.|$|E

5|$|As {{both sides}} {{failed to reach}} an agreement, the NBA {{canceled}} the preseason and all games through December. On November 14, the players dissolved the union, allowing them to file antitrust lawsuits against the league. On November 26, both sides reached a tentative agreement to end the lockout. The new CBA calls for a revenue split of 49-to-51.2% and a flexible salary cap structure with harsher luxury tax. After the tentative deal was reached, owners allowed players to have voluntary workouts at team sites starting December 1. After the deal was ratified on December 8, training camps, trades and free agency began the next day. During the lockout, some players signed contracts to play in other countries, mostly <b>in</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>Asia,</b> with most of them having the option to return upon the lockout's conclusion. The lockout also affected the economy due largely to NBA cities losing revenue generated by games as well as television networks losing ratings and advertisement revenue.|$|E
5|$|Clandestine {{trade with}} other nations continued, {{initially}} at a reduced level; among other things, Portugal illicitly labelled unsold Rhodesian tobacco as Mozambican product, then sold it on Salisbury's behalf <b>in</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>Asia.</b> Through this {{and a series of}} similar sanction-busting operations Rhodesia avoided the economic cataclysm predicted by Wilson, and, with the help of South Africa and Portugal, gradually became more self-sufficient. Aiming to directly cut off the main supply lines of oil to Rhodesia, namely the Portuguese Mozambican ports at Beira and Lourenço Marques, Wilson set up the Beira Patrol, a Royal Navy squadron based in the Mozambique Channel, in March 1966. This blockade was endorsed the following month by UN Security Council Resolution 221. Too small to cover both Beira and Lourenço Marques, and unable to legally fire on tankers once they were in Portuguese waters, the patrol met with little success, but it endured regardless for nearly a decade.|$|E
5|$|Many {{mushroom}} {{species are}} poisonous to humans, with toxicities ranging from slight digestive problems or allergic reactions {{as well as}} hallucinations to severe organ failures and death. Genera with mushrooms containing deadly toxins include Conocybe, Galerina, Lepiota, and, the most infamous, Amanita. The latter genus includes the destroying angel (A.virosa) and the death cap (A.phalloides), {{the most common cause}} of deadly mushroom poisoning. The false morel (Gyromitra esculenta) is occasionally considered a delicacy when cooked, yet can be highly toxic when eaten raw. Tricholoma equestre was considered edible until it was implicated in serious poisonings causing rhabdomyolysis. Fly agaric mushrooms (Amanita muscaria) also cause occasional non-fatal poisonings, mostly as a result of ingestion for its hallucinogenic properties. Historically, fly agaric was used by different peoples <b>in</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>Asia</b> and its present usage for religious or shamanic purposes is reported from some ethnic groups such as the Koryak people of north-eastern Siberia.|$|E

5|$|The corn crake, {{corncrake}} or landrail (Crex crex) is {{a bird in}} {{the rail}} family. It breeds <b>in</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>Asia</b> as far east as western China, and migrates to Africa for the northern hemisphere's winter. It is a medium-sized crake with buff- or grey-streaked brownish-black upperparts, chestnut markings on the wings, and blue-grey underparts with rust-coloured and white bars on the flanks and undertail. The strong bill is flesh-toned, the iris is pale brown, and the legs and feet are pale grey. Juveniles are similar in plumage to adults, and downy chicks are black, as with all rails. There are no subspecies, although individuals from {{the east of the}} breeding range tend to be slightly paler than their western counterparts. The male's call is a loud krek krek, from which the scientific name is derived. The corn crake is larger than its closest relative, the African crake, which shares its wintering range; that species is also darker-plumaged, and has a plainer face.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, the hotel's {{first floor}} held its {{reception}} rooms, parlors, dining rooms, library, and a lounge area called the Dutch kitchen. The library was adjacent to {{and north of}} the large dining room. The ballroom had classical fluted Ionic columns and Italian marble walls. Thomas Edison was honored there in 1909. The Dutch kitchen had decorations and furnishings from Holland and {{was based on a}} restaurant in Edam. It had rough adze-hewn timbers, a hipped ceiling, etchings from England, and European and American oil paintings. Much of the furniture was purchased from Law's former employer, home furnishings pioneer W. & J. Sloane. Art and decorations throughout the building were largely were sourced from markets <b>in</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>Asia,</b> and included expensive paintings, bronzes, marble sculptures, rare books, and carved antique furniture. The hotel also had a Chinese tea room and a dark room for amateur photographers. The kitchen was kept clean (such that it was proposed to serve lunches in the kitchen). It was reported to be of elegant design, utilizing white tile and marble. The kitchen equipment was of white porcelain and aluminum, and included numerous glass-lined refrigerators. It sourced its milk, butter, eggs, and vegetables from Briarcliff Farms. The kitchen's trash was frozen to prevent odors before its eventual removal; the lodge also had an ice-producing plant that used sterilized well water.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1938, {{when there}} was a pending hearing and lawsuit alleging unfair labor {{practices}} by the studios against directors, Briskin was chosen to be one of three producers representing the studios, alongside Darryl Zanuck and E. J. Mannix. Sitting across the table were W. S. Van Dyke, Howard Hawks, and Briskin's friend, Frank Capra. In 1939, Briskin was once again involved in potential legal proceedings, being {{one of a number of}} producers who were called to testify before the National Labor Relations Board, regarding alleged infractions by the studios against the Screen Writers Guild (SWG). During the hearings, it was alleged that Briskin had opposed the proposed merger between the SWG and the Authors Guild. After the outbreak of hostilities <b>in</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>Asia</b> at the beginning of World War II, AMPAS created the Motion Picture Defense Committee, which was a sub-committee of the organization's Research Council. Headed by the council's chairman, Darryl F. Zanuck, Briskin was one of several producers named to the committee. The group was formed to advise various arms of the U.S. government in the creation and production of training films. Shortly after the committee's formation, it was decided that the facilities of Hollywood film studios would be made available to the army to use for filming and production. In mid-November 1940 Briskin, along with the committee's chair Major Nathan Levinson, participated in interviews with members of the Screen Writers Guild, in order to select writers to go to Monmouth, New Jersey to work with army personnel on developing scripts for training films.|$|E
