40|$|Harold Wheeler, in the 1940 s developed, in {{a simple}} form, the {{principles}} of double-tuned <b>impedance</b> <b>matching.</b> These relationships are not well known. They are very useful for the antenna designer in providing a structured approach to obtain near maximum bandwidth for narrowband and moderate-band antennas with a specified VSWR limit using a practical arrangement of tuning elements. Wheeler first developed relationships for single-tuned <b>impedance</b> <b>matching,</b> which relate the fractional bandwidth to the antenna Q and the maximum permissible reflection-coefficient magnitude (or VSWR). He used the results of single-tuned <b>impedance</b> <b>matching</b> to derive the relationship for double-tuned <b>impedance</b> <b>matching.</b> Wheeler’s double-tuned <b>impedance</b> <b>matching</b> relationship is the best overall measure of the achievable fractional bandwidth for an antenna. Double tuning is practical and provides {{more than double the}} fractional bandwidth of single-tuned <b>impedance</b> <b>matching.</b> One example of double-tuned <b>impedance</b> <b>matching</b> is presented. A comparison to recently published results for single-tuned <b>impedance</b> <b>matching</b> verifies that double tuning more than doubles the fractional bandwidth of single-tuned <b>impedance</b> <b>matching...</b>|$|R

40|$|This thesis proposes {{parasitic}} aware design {{techniques for}} concurrent Multi-Band <b>impedance</b> <b>matching</b> networks. Different concurrent L-matching networks are analyzed and the substantial impact of component non-idealities on matching performance is addressed. To counter these impacts, the design methodology is modified and the improvement is verified for different concurrent dual-band networks. The same techniques are extended for quad band concurrent L-matching networks. The proposed parasitic aware methods are validated through practical components from Coilcraft and Murata libraries (offchip) and UMC 0. 18 _um RFCMOS technology (on-chip). The results show considerable improvement in both off-chip and onchip scenarios. Hence, the proposed method is much useful in low power concurrent multi band RF circuit design. The new methodology for broadband <b>impedance</b> <b>matching</b> has been discussed.

The {{equation}} describing {{the effect of}} load impedance variation on the <b>impedance</b> <b>matching</b> performance is derived. The deviation from perfect match {{is proportional to the}} variation in load reflection coefficient. However, if the load impedance is too large or too small, resulting in a large reflection coefficient, the solution to the <b>impedance</b> <b>matching</b> problem will have poorer quality in term of variability. The variability factor increases rapidly when the load reflection coefficient is larger than 0. 7. A small variation in the load impedance will cause a large deviation from perfect match.

In order to guarantee this condition low losses systems are designed; these losses can be classified in dissipation losses and mismatch losses. There are different classic methods for <b>impedance</b> <b>matching,</b> but they reach the <b>impedance</b> <b>matching</b> in a very narrow bandwidth, whereas the bandwidth used in different applications is generally greater {{in accordance with the}} quantity of information to be transmitted. A solution proposed in this paper to reach an <b>impedance</b> <b>matching</b> into a wider bandwidth is through the connection of various stub lines in parallel all along the transmission line, so we can have a multiple variables system, with more grades of liberty. A software that automatizes the calculations to reach the <b>impedance</b> <b>matching</b> was programmed, by using the minimum squares and Nelder-Mead methods. Once the user introduces the data of Standing Wave Ratio (SWR) and bandwidth desired, the load impedance and the work frequency of the system, the program determines the minimum number of stubs necessary to match the system, and the longitudes and distances along the line where they should be located.
