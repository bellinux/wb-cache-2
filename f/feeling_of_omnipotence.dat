Bergler considers the behavior of parents largely irrelevant to this conflict. Homosexuality is an unconscious response to the difficulty children experience in reconciling their objective dependence on their mothers with their subjective <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>omnipotence,</b> derived from the experience of life in the womb, where they felt entirely self-sufficient. While most children resolve this conflict, which inevitably ends in a recognition of dependence on the mother, without suffering permanent psychological damage, those who become homosexual do not, perhaps because of their greater inherited megalomania. They begin to hate themselves because of their physical inability to express their aggression, and their attempts to cope with the resulting pain lead to psychic masochism. When they later become physically able to express aggression, they continue to experience frustration because of the punishment they receive, which causes guilt and further reinforces the psychic masochism.|$|E

Para os entrevistados, o atendimento de usuários da Rede revela a emergência de novos processos de subjetivação. Estes, no entanto, por serem em grande parte desconhecidos, ainda não podem ser integrados em um modelo que defina a subjetividade contemporânea. Segundo os entrevistados, é possível, contudo, identificar algumas características subjetivas comuns aos pacientes usuários da Internet. São elas: o prazer derivado do uso da Rede como um novo espaço de vida, o sentimento de onipotência originado na experiência online, as relações estabelecidas com seus corpos e os excessos vividos no espaço virtual. Finalmente, o exame destas características e dos resultados de outras pesquisas gera uma interessante convergência que fornece pontos de partida para uma reflexão teórica sobre a subjetividade contemporânea.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} in the form of {{literature}} review. It deals with the development of understanding of the power and the responsibility of the children and the modern concept of education through which the parents try to influence their children so that they would be capable of socialization and long-term functioning in everyday life without conflict with the generally accepted patterns of coexistence. The most important groups influencing social development of individuals are defined in the introduction. I mention briefly below the overall moral development of children, because the control of desire for power and awareness of the responsibilities is included in the overall understanding of the basic principles of human behavior in society. The next section is already about development of application of own power, finding of limits for speeches and actions in contact with other people, and the gradual awareness of the responsibility for own actions. In the connection with the power, It is impossible not to mention the aggression that occurs among children more often nowadays and it is very difficult to solve it. The paper describes the difficulties with which parents can meet during the education. I suggest gradually approaches that help parents in ensuring that children get rid of a <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>omnipotence</b> and superiority appearing in the vast majority of them and understand that It is important to be responsible. At the end, I briefly notice when a child is seen as a responsible user of her own rights and obligations in terms of the Act. The aim of this thesis was to show that the initial prehension of power and responsibility by children is incompatible with the standards for normal life in society. Parents have to lead children with focused and persistent education to behavior modification and shift the understanding of these concepts...|$|E
40|$|Discourses on {{trauma in}} the South African Police Service (SAPS) focus {{primarily}} {{on the experience of}} traumatic events as the primary reason for the emotional difficulties that members experience. This study questions this dominant discourse and examines additional discourses that may contribute to {{a deeper understanding of the}} dynamics of trauma in the SAPS. The research entailed a qualitative analysis of 15 essays written by members of the SAPS, with the aim of exploring alternative discourses on the experience of trauma by police officers. The participants included fifteen male, officers from three units in the Gauteng region. The data were analysed within a psychodynamic frame, and findings suggest that police officers’ reactions to trauma are significantly influenced by factors other than mere exposure to traumatic events. The history of psychological trauma indicates that constructions of traumatic stress are strongly connected with cultural, social and political circumstances. Current psychodynamic thinking emphasises the meaning of the real traumatic occurrence, which causes trauma by changing a person’s experience of the self in relation to selfobjects. The research results suggest that the sociohistorical circumstances in South Africa, the transformation effected in the police service, and political and structural uncertainty play an important role in contributing to an overwhelming sense of loss and uncertainty. Perceived losses include the loss of the supportive police subculture, loss of meaning in their work, loss of a sense of masculinity as well as loss of a sense of competence and agency. Findings further reveal that officers’ experience a sense of being overwhelmed, powerless and helpless in the face of these historical and organisational changes. These feelings generate significant anxiety and impact negatively on officers’ self-esteem. <b>Feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>omnipotence</b> and invulnerability, which are necessary for effective coping in the policing environment, are negatively affected.

40|$|Orientation: This study explores {{individual}} {{stories of}} tramna and their dissonance with the official, dominant discourse on trauma in the South African Police Service (SAPS) from a systems psychodynamic perspective. Research purpose: The {{purpose of the}} research was, firstly, to explore how trauma experienced by South African Police Service members is constructed or 'talked about' and made sense of. Questions and issues that are considered relevant to the primary purpose are: which aspects of the working environment do members {{consider to be the}} most stressful, tramnatic and difficult to cope with, and what is the effect of the change and transition processes on members' working experiences? Motivation for the study: The authors set out to explore the role of systems psychodynamics in the experience of trauma and stress in the SAPS. Research design, approach and method: Through this qualitative, explorative, social phenomenological study, contributing circumstances and processes are included as additional discourses in an attempt to deepen understanding. The epistemology viewpoint of the study is found in the social constructionism and the data comprise 15 essays by members of the SAPS, all of which have been analysed from the perspective of systems psychodynamics. Main findings: Although the effect of tramna on police officers can never be negated, {{the way in which they}} deal with trauma seems to be different from what was initially believed. Further, their experience of stress is not solely the result of traumatic experiences but rather the result of traumatic experiences and systems psychodynamics operating within their organisation - which includes both organisational stressors or dynamics and transfonnation dynamics. Practical/managerial implications: The history of psychological trauma indicates that constructions of traumatic stress are strongly related to cultural, social and political circumstances. Current psychoanalytic thinking emphasises the meaning of the real occurrence, which causes trauma by changing the person's experience of the self in relation to self-objects. Practical implications are the loss of the supportive subculture of the police, the loss of masculinity, as well as the loss of the power to be competent and meaningful. Furthermore, <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> being overwhelmed, powerless and helpless generate anxiety and may have a significant impact on officers' self-esteem and impede their <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>omnipotence</b> and inv ulnerability, which are necessary to cope in the policing environment. Contribution/value-add: Tite current study found various traumatic and systemspsychodynamic factors and processes to be anxiety-provoking as a result of exposure to tramna.

40|$|The paper {{reports the}} {{research}} project "Small_Nature Design". It’s about the contemporary need of natural spaces, within the unhealthy urban habitats characterized by pollution, waste and physical density. This statement {{has been an}} important suggestion for this research, to define a different design approach able to overcome the futility of contemporary needs of societies and to understand the real desires. While designing small and big objects, we suggested new contexts and new uses, without any pretence to be the primary force behind social and individual well being. We considered as a starting point the definition of Design as “accelerator”, answering to human demands related to the environmental and social contexts. This definition takes a particular meaning within the current unstoppable progress, often perceived so intrusive to generate a double <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>omnipotence</b> and frustration. The omnipotence - to overcome our physical and cognitive limits - improves human quality of flexibility, which is able to adapt innovations according to our rhythms and goals. The frustration – to feel us victims of the technological hyper-stimulation – pushes people’s consciences towards more sustainable and human ways of life. Design to these conditions reacts on two levels: the first pushes towards the exploration of all possible interactions between man and technology (according to Design of Interaction); the second, on the opposite, pushes towards the resolution of more urgent failures of contemporary mature society (according to Design for Sustainability). But, within that practical relationship between men and objects called consumption, this disciplinary dichotomy becomes a mixed condition informed by a “fuzzy” logic. According to this, it has been defined a different design approach within those opposite approaches. The methodological result is a different design role, considered as “creative receiver” and able to redefine the relationship between consumption and production, while amplifying human activities according to a conscious innovation...|$|E
40|$|With the ‘positivist’ slogan of ‘Better City, Better Life’, China {{has invited}} {{the world to}} share his faith in the {{possibilities}} of growth and improvement for the future. But since 2002, when Shanghai was selected to host the Expo, to 2010, which is {{the year of the}} Expo opening, the socio-economic worldwide scenario underwent substantial transformations. Therefore many of the certainties {{at the base of the}} cultural project of the Shanghai Expo, seemed no more incisive, necessary and perhaps possible. It is in such circumstances that next International Expo (in 2015 in Milan) has been announced, passing from the motto of Shanghai ‘Better City – Better Life’ to the motto of Milan ‘Feeding the Planet – Energy for Life’: from the euphoric <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>omnipotence</b> of the emerging countries, to the sense of frustration of the West which recognizes their limitations, but without knowing if and how to overcome them. Within the Design debate, these two feelings – of omnipotence and frustration – are not only the results of contemporary society, but also the boundaries of an operational space where the extremes are: the exploration of all possible interrelations between man/nature and technology, and the correction of all the failures caused by the mature capitalist processes of production. According to a design vision, the two Expos, the one of Shanghai and the one of Milan, both embody such extremes: each one heads towards a sort of utopia – according to the etymological meaning of ‘non place’ (to go!) The feeling for designers (and also for those who produce, manage, consume) is to be in a kind of ‘operating’ void, waiting for a possible drift towards one or the other utopia. Such feeling is well expressed in the last Biennale of Architecture in Venice (2012) : its special theme – proposed and implemented by the curator David Chipperfield – was precisely the search for a possible ‘Common Ground’ for sharing ideas and actions away from any dichotomy, as well as from absolutism and singularity (and thus from the extremes). Among all, the Pavilion which could be considered more emblematic of this approach was perhaps the one of the United States entitled ‘Spontaneous Interventions: Design Actions for the Common Good’. The exhibition collected 124 projects by architects, designers, artists and ‘ordinary citizens’, whose theme was the objective of a positive change in (local) urban environments, through the direct participation of the users. This project fully embodies the reading that Jean Baudrillard did of North American society (1986) as the place of the achieved utopia. The described projects tell about a simple and (apparently) e≠ective design approach, which doesn’t need to be justified by any upstream theoretical construct. And, overall, they describe a dfferent way of conceiving Design, embodying two emblematic contemporary trends: participation and self-production. In particular, ‘participation’ is developed within the broadcasting of information technologies: where the web has changed the concept of community, making it not anymore related to a physical place, but to an homogeneous group of people sharing knowledge (as interests, culture, activities). It is still the web to determine the process of ‘rhizomatic’ dissemination of knowledge, in accordance with a linear and horizontal generation, where there isn’t any chance to locate the source. According to this, it is rising not only a di≠erent practice – where the ‘knots’ can be potentially (and simultaneously) designers, manufacturers, operators and users of knowledge – but also, it is being generated a different ethics (and aesthetics). Anderson (2012) describes this occurrence as the third revolution of the makers. Within such horizontal processes, what is the role of designers? What is the possible disciplinary autonomy of Design? While recognizing that the ‘places of spontaneity’ can be also the ‘places of opportunity’, such questions also introduce a challenge to design and overcome that ‘operative void’ opened between the two great visions/utopias generated by the feeling of ‘omnipotence’ and the feeling of ‘frustration’...|$|E

There are three main subjects of debate on the power of God (gods). First, how to precisely define omnipotence, in philosophically as well as theologically adequate way, by using correct terms. This task has two sides, semiotic and the corresponding metaphysical one – how should we correctly understand the very nature of God’s power. The second topic, or rather set of topics is to map the scope <b>of</b> <b>omnipotence</b> up and delineate its limits. And the last, third subject concerning omnipotence is to establish the relation <b>of</b> <b>omnipotence</b> to others attributes as well as to the God’s nature as such. All the issues are placed in the context of historical and actual debates. The paper distinguish with some detail different subtopics connected with each main issues. The problem of correct, adequate main term used in definiens of God’s power definition and task to detect paradoxes <b>of</b> <b>omnipotence,</b> to find it’s sources, and remove them, if it is possible are connected with first. It includes the task of distinguishing of different kinds of God’s power. In the second group of topics the paper lists nine different questions concerning the scope and limits of power of God, for example some connected with the ways of acting of God in the world, the relations between power of God and human freedom, God’s omnipotence and evil, with possibility of creating of different world or world with different value status or even with different moral laws.
