500|$|The story's central {{location}} {{was set at}} Steventon rectory where Austen was raised. While it had been demolished in 1824, Jarrold and his crew [...] "fortunately found a wonderful house that was very like the original... We honed the script as well {{to make it as}} practical as possible." [...] Stewart believed that the Austen house expressed their status and wealth, [...] "I think that you will lose the central thrust of the story unless you understand the status of the Austen's and that they are pretty poor. Jane spent all her formative years there and that was the place that influenced her view of the world. You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the family live in that house because that is a crucial piece of the jigsaw." [...] Scenes at Steventon rectory were filmed in Higginsbrook House, a few miles off Trim in County Meath. Later in fall 2006, it appeared again as the house of the Morlands in Northanger Abbey.|$|E
500|$|Writers Glen Morgan and James Wong {{developed}} the episode specially for Kristen Cloke, both for her experience as {{the protagonist of}} their series , to translate Morgan's feelings as his friendship with Cloke became an emotional relationship, and for showcasing her acting. Morgan stated, [...] "I knew she {{did a lot of}} characters and voices, so I wanted to incorporate that ... I wanted to write something for her that challenged her". Cloke did research on multiple personality disorders before filming, and based the various personalities on people she knew. Morgan also stated that he [...] "wanted to write something for David Duchovny that challenged him." [...] When pitching the idea to director Rob Bowman, the writers stated they wanted [...] "this episode to feel like the part in Ken Burns' Civil War documentary where they read the Sullivan Ballou letter." [...] Michael Massee wanted his characterization of Ephesian to be [...] "normal looking" [...] and [...] "nondemonic", explaining, [...] "You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> he believes his own rap. When he speaks, he's just explaining that 'this is the way it is' – and that's when it gets very scary." [...] The name [...] "Vernon" [...] comes from cult leader David Koresh's real name, and [...] "Ephesian" [...] is taken from one of the books of the Bible.|$|E
500|$|Nikita and Maggie Q's {{portrayal}} of the character was met with generally positive reactions from television critics. Nikita was included in TV Guides lists of [...] "TV's Sexiest Crime Fighters" [...] and [...] "TV's Toughest Ladies". Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times felt that Q was suited for the role, stating [...] "she has a solemn, exotic beauty and hauteur that echo the heroine's self-possession and cool relentlessness," [...] adding [...] "Nikita is noticeably more hard-boiled and less girlish than the undercover agent played by Jennifer Garner on Alias, or the C.I.A. rookie that Piper Perabo plays on Covert Affairs." [...] Troy Patterson of Slate felt that [...] "Ms. Q's Nikita is only half so crush-worthy as Bionic Woman's Jaime Sommers or Dollhouse's what's-her-name, but her predicament is no less tasty." [...] Robert Bianco of USA Today believed Q's performance was [...] "a fairly sizable incentive" [...] to watch the show, adding she [...] "combines stunt-fighting chops and lithe beauty with an unusual-for-the-genre air of somber intelligence. Her Nikita is not above cracking a joke, but it's clear from Q's eyes and bearing that she has suffered {{at the hands of}} evil men, and she's {{not going to take it}} anymore." [...] Alan Sepinwall of HitFix believed that Q [...] "carries herself in a way that makes it believable she could be a hard-core killer, and she has the requisite dramatic chops and charisma for the part." [...] Maureen Ryan of AOL TV said [...] "Maggie Q, has real charisma and presence; she invests Nikita's drive to bring down the secretive Division with potent energy. You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Nikita would devote her life to wreaking vengeance on the people she views as her former captors, and you also have to buy her as a butt-kicking, gun-toting action heroine who also looks great in a cocktail gown. Maggie Q makes all those things look easy." ...|$|E

2500|$|Chief Justice Rehnquist, {{joined by}} Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy, and Justice Thomas, argued the Law School's admissions policy {{was an attempt}} to achieve an unconstitutional type of racial balancing. [...] The Chief Justice {{attacked}} the Law School's asserted goal of reaching a [...] "critical mass" [...] of minority students, finding the absolute number African-American, Hispanic, and Native American students varied markedly, which is inconsistent with the concept in that one would think the same size critical mass would be needed for all minority groups. [...] He noted that [...] "rom 1995 through 2000, the Law School admitted... between 13 and 19... Native American, between 91 and 108... African American, and between 47 and 56... Hispanic... One would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the objectives of 'critical mass' offered by respondents are achieved with only half the number of Hispanics, and one-sixth the number of Native Americans as compared to African Americans." [...] Citing admissions statistics, the Chief Justice noted the tight correlation between the percentage of applicants and admittees of a given race and argued that the numbers were [...] "far too precise to be dismissed as merely the result of the school paying 'some attention to [...] numbers.'" ...|$|E

60|$|If it {{be assumed}} that the {{characteristic}} differences between the various domestic races are due to descent from several aboriginal species, we must conclude that man chose for domestication in ancient times, either intentionally or by chance, a most abnormal set of pigeons; for that species resembling such birds as Pouters, Fantails, Carriers, Barbs, Short- faced Tumblers, Turbits, etc., {{would be in the}} highest degree abnormal, as compared with all the existing members of the great pigeon family, cannot be doubted. Thus we should <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> man not only formerly succeeded in thoroughly domesticating several highly abnormal species, but that these same species have since all become extinct, or are at least now unknown. This double accident is so extremely improbable that the assumed existence of so many abnormal species would require to be supported by the strongest evidence. On the other hand, if all the races are descended from C. livia, we can understand, as will hereafter be more fully explained, how any slight deviation in structure which first appeared would continually be augmented by the preservation of the most strongly marked individuals; and as the power of selection would be applied according to man's fancy, and not for the bird's own good, the accumulated amount of deviation would certainly be of an abnormal nature in comparison with the structure of pigeons living in a state of nature.|$|E
60|$|This was {{a prodigious}} number of itself, but if I should add the reasons which I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> this account was {{deficient}}, and how deficient it was, you would, with me, make no scruple {{to believe that}} there died above ten thousand a week for all those weeks, one week with another, and a proportion for several weeks both before and after. The confusion among the people, especially within the city, at that time, was inexpressible. The terror was so great at last that the courage of the people appointed to carry away the dead began to fail them; nay, several of them died, although they had the distemper before and were recovered, and some of them dropped down when they have been carrying the bodies even at the pit side, and just ready to throw them in; and this confusion was greater in the city because they had flattered themselves with hopes of escaping, and thought the bitterness of death was past. One cart, they told us, going up Shoreditch was forsaken of the drivers, or being left to one man to drive, he died in the street; and the horses going on overthrew the cart, and left the bodies, some thrown out here, some there, in a dismal manner. Another cart was, it seems, found in the great pit in Finsbury Fields, the driver being dead, or having been gone and abandoned it, and the horses running too near it, the cart fell in and drew the horses in also. It was suggested that the driver was thrown in with it and that the cart fell upon him, by reason his whip was seen to be in the pit among the bodies; but that, I suppose, could not be certain.|$|E
60|$|If, however, every {{resemblance}} proved between B and A, in {{any point}} {{not known to}} be immaterial with respect to m, forms some additional reason for presuming that B has the attribute m; it is clear, è contra, that every dissimilarity which can be proved between them furnishes a counter-probability of the same nature on the other side. It is not, indeed, unusual that different ultimate properties should, in some particular instances, produce the same derivative property; {{but on the whole}} it is certain that things which differ in their ultimate properties, will differ at least as much in the aggregate of their derivative properties, and that the differences which are unknown will, on the average of cases, bear some proportion to those which are known. There will, therefore, be a competition between the known points of agreement and the known points of difference in A and B; and according as the one or the other may be deemed to preponderate, the probability derived from analogy will be for or against B’s having the property m. The moon, for instance, agrees with the earth in the circumstances already mentioned; but differs in being smaller, in having its surface more unequal, and apparently volcanic throughout, in having, at least on the side next the earth, no atmosphere sufficient to refract light, no clouds, and (it is therefore concluded) no water. These differences, considered merely as such, might perhaps balance the resemblances, so that analogy would afford no presumption either way. But considering that some of the circumstances which are wanting on the moon are among those which, on the earth, are found to be indispensable conditions of animal life, we may conclude that if that phenomenon does exist in the moon (or at all events on the nearer side), it must be as an effect of causes totally different from those on which it depends here; as a consequence, therefore, of the moon’s differences from the earth, not of the points of agreement. Viewed in this light, all the resemblances which exist become presumptions against, not in favor of, the moon’s being inhabited. Since life can not exist there {{in the manner in which}} it exists here, the greater the resemblance of the lunar world to the terrestrial in other respects, the less reason we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> it can contain life.|$|E

6000|$|... 3. That man doth act {{from a legal}} spirit who maketh the {{strictness}} of his {{walking the}} ground of his assurance for eternal life. Some men, all the ground they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> they shall be saved, {{it is because they}} walk not so loose as their neighbours, they are not so bad as others are, and therefore they question not but that they shall do well. Now this is a false ground, and a thing that is verily legal, and savours only of some slight and shallow apprehensions of the old covenant. I call them shallow apprehensions, because they are not right and sound, and are such as will do the soul no good, but beguile it, in that the knowledge of the nature of this covenant doth not appear to the soul, only some commanding power it hath on the soul, which the soul endeavouring to give up itself unto, it doth find some peace and content, and especially if it find itself to be pretty willing to yield itself to its commands. And is not this the very ground of thy hoping that God will save thee from the wrath to come? If one should ask thee what ground thou hast to think thou shalt be saved, wouldst thou not say, Truly, because I have left my sins, and because I am more inclinable to do good, [Do not think that I am against the order of the Gospel]. and to learn, and get more knowledge; I endeavour to walk in church order, as they call it, and therefore I hope God hath done a good work for me, and I hope will save my soul. Alas, alas! this is a very trick of the devil to make souls build the ground of their salvation upon this their strictness, and abstaining from the wickedness of their former lives, and because they desire to be stricter and stricter. Now, if you would know such a man or woman, you shall find them in this frame--namely, when they think their hearts are good, then they think also that Christ will have mercy upon them; but when their corruptions work, then they doubt and scruple until again they have their hearts more ready to do the things contained in the law and ordinances of the Gospel. Again, such men do commonly cheer up their hearts, and encourage themselves still to hope all shall be well, and that because they are not so bad as the rest, but more inclinable than they, saying, I am glad I am not as this publican, but better than he, more righteous than he (Luke 18:11).|$|E
